    "the _ hst _ wfpc2 images of hh30  irs ( burrows et al . 1996 ) revealed the characteristic scattered light pattern of an edge - on disk in a classical t  tauri system : two almost parallel nebulae separated by an opaque dust lane ( e.g. , whitney & hartmann 1992 ) .",
    "detailed modeling of the wfpc2 images enabled burrows et al . to constrain the size , shape , and optical depth of the disk .",
    "in addition , their best model images were constructed using dust grains with a scattering phase function which is more forward throwing than typical interstellar medium ( ism ) grains , indicative of grain growth within the disk ( hansen & travis 1974 ) .",
    "wood et al .",
    "( 1998 ) presented scattered light models of edge - on disks showing that the width of the dust lane decreases towards longer wavelengths where the dust is less opaque ( assuming a wavelength dependence for absorption and scattering of typical ism dust grains ) .",
    "they predicted that the hh30  irs nebulosity should appear almost pointlike at the @xmath7 band .",
    "however , the new nicmos observations of cotera et al .",
    "( 2001 ) show a distinct dust lane even at the longest nicmos wavelength .",
    "cotera et al .",
    "used the nicmos images to study the near - ir wavelength dependence of the circumstellar dust opacity .",
    "they modeled the nicmos images using a dust size distribution that has a smaller near - ir opacity and a shallower wavelength dependence than ism dust .",
    "their modeling showed that the extinction through the disk to the central source is @xmath8 .",
    "the derivation of this extinction requires detailed radiation transfer modeling , since the _ hst _ images are dominated by scattered light so standard reddenning estimates are not applicable .",

    "( 1998 ) , and cotera et al .",
    "fit the width of the dust lane , from which they derive @xmath9 . as noted by burrows et al .",
    ", what is really determined from scattered light modeling is the equatorial optical depth in the disk midplane , @xmath10 . the mass determination is therefore very uncertain since it depends on the adopted grain size distribution and opacity .",

    "however , dalessio , calvet , & hartmann ( 2001 ) have shown that the edge - on disk of hk  tau / c may be modeled with a massive disk , @xmath12 , in which the maximum grain size is 1  meter .",
    "their results also demonstrate the utility of long wavelength observations for distinguishing between a low mass disk with ism grains and a massive disk with a population of much larger grains .",
    "it is difficult to draw firm conclusions on circumstellar dust properties since the often unknown inclination and disk geometry lead to degeneracies in sed models .",
    "however , for hh30  irs scattered light modeling provides the disk geometry and inclination",
    ". therefore the circumstellar grain properties may be studied through detailed modeling of its sed which covers the range @xmath13 mm ( stapelfeldt & moneti 1999 ) .",
    "this paper presents model seds for hh30  irs that highlight the differences between ism and larger dust grain models .",
    "our modeling adopts the disk structure derived from fitting _ hst _ images and calculates the radiative equilibrium sed from a star plus disk system .",
    "we use our new monte carlo radiative equilibrium code for the calculations and show sed models at different inclination angles ranging from almost edge - on ( appropriate to hh30  irs ) to pole - on viewing of the star  +  disk system .",
    "section  2 presents the hh30  irs sed taken from the literature ,  3 describes the radiation transfer , disk model , and dust opacity , and  4 presents sed models for a passive reprocessing disk and also the effects of including viscous accretion luminosity .",

    "the _ iso _ data were also presented by brandner et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and their reduction produced slightly larger fluxes than that of stapelfeldt & moneti ( 1999 ) .",

    "the fluxes in fig .  1 were not taken simultaneously and hh30  irs is known to vary in the optical by up to 1.4mag at @xmath14 , but this amplitude decreases towards longer wavelengths ( wood et al .",
    "consequently , this variability will not affect our dust size distribution modeling since the different dust models are discriminated at long wavelengths ( @xmath20 ) where any variability is expected to be small .",
    "although the @xmath21 m and @xmath19 m data are upper limits , the sed shows the characteristic double - peaked spectrum of an edge - on disk : the direct starlight is obscured by the disk , the near - ir peak arises from scattered light , and the far - ir peak is due to reprocessing of stellar radiation in the disk and possibly the liberation of disk accretion luminosity ( e.g. , sonnhalter , preibisch , & yorke 1995 ; boss & yorke 1996 ; menshchikov & henning 1997 ; dalessio et al .",

    "a calculation of the hydrostatic disk structure ( e.g. , dalessio et al .",
    "1999 ) can be included in the monte carlo technique , but this would require an iterative scheme .",

    "grain growth within protoplanetary disks has been inferred from mm observations and the slope of long wavelength seds  mm fluxes are larger and the sed slopes are shallower than predicted from ism grains ( e.g. , beckwith et al .",
    "1990 ; beckwith & sargent 1991 ) . in order to examine the possibility of grain growth within the hh30 disk as well as the potential characteristics thereof , we construct models with several different dust size distributions : a standard ism mixture and several distributions with larger grains including both simple power - laws and power - laws with an exponential cutoff .    for the ism dust ,",
    "we adopt the size ( mass ) distribution of kim , martin , & hendry ( 1994 ; kmh ) for the canonical diffuse interstellar sightline ( i.e , @xmath51=3.1 ) . in addition",
    ", we also reproduce the model of cotera et al .",
    "the interested reader is referred to these two works for specific details of the models .    for our `` larger grain '' dust models",
    ", we combine a `` power - law with exponential cutoff '' ( e.g. , kmh ) for components of amorphous carbon and astronomical silicates with solar abundance constraints for carbon and silicon ( c / h @xmath52 and si / h @xmath53 , respectively ; anders & grevesse 1989 ; grevesse & noel 1993 ) . the primary motivation for introducing an additional complexity onto a simple power - law ( one with a single exponent , e.g. dalessio et al .",
    "2001 ) is that it is not expected to apply over such a large range of grain sizes .",
    "this has been indicated in analyses of both ism and circumstellar dust grains ( e.g. , kmh ; jones , tielens , & hollenbach 1996 ; witt , smith , & dwek 2001 ; suttner & yorke 2001 ) .",
    "in addition , rather than joining two separate power - laws ( i.e. , witt , smith , & dwek 2001 ) , we adopt a distribution that provides a smooth transition between two different regimes and that can reproduce the general behavior of a large range of interstellar sight lines ( e.g. , kmh ) .",

    "of course , a simple power - law corresponds to the case of @xmath58 .",
    "@xmath59 is set by requiring the grains to completely deplete a solar abundance of carbon and silicon",
    ". the subscript `` @xmath60 '' refers to the different components of the dust model : amorphous carbon and silicate ( see table  1 ) .",
    "this function is essentially the `` modified gamma distribution '' found in atmospheric and planetary science literature .",
    "the end - points of the size integration , @xmath61 and @xmath62 , are also parameters .",
    "not surprisingly , models with finite values of @xmath57 are insensitive to the exact value of @xmath62 as long as it is @xmath63 .",
    "the opacity of the dust grains is modelled under the assumption of two separate populations of homogeneous , spherical particles . in general , we use published dielectric functions for astronomical silicate ( weingartner & draine 2001 ) and amorphous carbon ( be type , zubko et al . 1996 ) .",
    "however , our desired wavelength range extends longward of both sets of dielectric functions and slightly shortward of the amorphous carbon values ( i.e. , 100 - 500   not in published set ) .",
    "we use a subtractive kramers - kronig analyis ( cf .",
    "ahrenkiel 1971 ; routine kindly supplied by k. snook ) , specifying the imaginary index of refraction in the regions of interest .",
    "this approach also requires specification of the real index of refraction at some reference point ; we use a value of the real refractive index at a wavelength adjacent to the missing range from the published data . for the long wavelength extension ,",
    "we use the approximation that imaginary index is proportional to @xmath64 ( e.g. , pollack et al . 1994 ) : @xmath65 for the silicates and @xmath66 for the amorphous carbon .",
    "the latter choice departs from the recommendation of pollack et al . for metals ( @xmath67 ) , but is a much better match for the slope of the published data in the far - ir region .",
    "fortunately , our model fits are fairly insensitive to the exact choice of @xmath68 . for the short wavelength extension",
    ", we use the imaginary index of the be1 of rouleau & martin ( 1991 ) scaled to match smoothly with that of zubko et al .",
    "the scattering properties are calculated using a combination of mie series solution and geometrical optics algorithms . for the former ,",
    "we employ the code of wiscombe ( 1996 ) while the latter regime is handled with the code of macke and collaborators ( _ rt - ellipsoid _ ,",
    "i.e. , macke & mishchenko 1996 ) . the transition point between the two algorithms is made at a size parameter of 20,000 . though this choice is somewhat arbitrary , at this point",
    "the forward scattering properties as calculated by each algorithm differ at a level below 1% ( the phase matrix elements are in agreement at the 5 - 10% level ) .",
    "this is also true at a size parameter of 10,000 , but we chose the larger value in order to allow the phase functions in the visible and nir to be calculated entirely by the mie algorithms ; this avoids introducing the small - scale ( @xmath69 10% outside the central diffraction peak ) high - frequency oscillations produced by the geometrical optics algorithm .",
    "figures  2 and 3 show the spectral shape of the opacity , albedo , and cosine asymmetry parameter ( i.e. , @xmath70 ) for the various dust models we consider .",
    "the size distribution parameters are listed in table  1 .",
    "although we use mie theory for calculating the scattering properties , in the radiative equilibrium calculation we adopt a simple heyney - greenstein scattering phase function characterized by the single parameter , @xmath70 ( heyney & greenstein 1941 ) .",
    "a tentative spectral type of m0 for the illuminating source of hh30  irs was assigned by kenyon et al .",
    "however , because the central star is totally obscured by the disk at optical and near - ir wavelengths , the spectral type is very uncertain .",
    "scattered light models indicate @xmath2 , so we adopt @xmath71k ( kurucz model atmosphere , kurucz 1994 ) and @xmath72 .",
    "the distance to hh30  irs is taken to be 140pc .",
    "the following sections show the resulting seds for different dust models , starting with a purely passive reprocessing disk . for each dust model",
    "we adopt the disk size and structure described in  3.2 and determine the disk mass from fitting the nicmos f160w image .",
    "we then calculate the model sed for comparison with the data presented in figure  1 .",
    "figure  4 shows the nicmos f160w image and scattered light model fits for the five dust types described in  3.4 and summarized in table 2 .",
    "the @xmath73 values in this table are calculated differently than those presented by cotera et al .",
    "we have simply integrated through the disk along a viewing angle of @xmath74 , whereas cotera et al .",
    "measured how much light escapes in the monte carlo simulation to get an effective @xmath73 .",
    "the width of the dust lane in the scattered light images is sensitive not only to the disk mass ( and therefore @xmath75and @xmath76 ) , but also to the scattering phase function .",
    "if @xmath70 were the same for all models then @xmath76 would be the same also .",
    "however , as the phase function becomes more forward throwing for the larger dust grain models ( i.e. , @xmath70 increases ) , a larger optical depth is required to obtain the same width of the dust lane .",
    "figures  5 and 6 show the hh30  irs data and model seds ( for @xmath74 derived from scattered light models ) for the dust types described in  3.4 and summarized in table  1 .",
    "the models show the characteristic double peaked seds of highly inclined disks .",
    "the disk mass has been chosen so that each model matches the nicmos f160w image ( cotera et al .",
    "the different dust models are distinguished from one another at longer wavelengths . although the ism grains and the cotera et al .",
    "grains produce similar mm fluxes , they differ in the @xmath77 range where the ism grains have a steeper wavelength dependent opacity that yields too narrow a dust lane in nicmos scattered light images .",
    "the mm fluxes are best reproduced with larger grain size distributions .",
    "our pure reprocessing disk models yield a rather low flux in the @xmath78 range and  4.3 shows models including accretion luminosity that provide a better fit to this spectral regime .",
    "the different models , disk mass estimates , midplane optical depths ( @xmath75 ) , and extinction to the star for @xmath74 are summarized in tables  1 and 2 .",
    "the simple power - law size distributions can have very large mm optical depths .",
    "while dust size distributions with small @xmath62 can be used to fit individual scattered light images , the mm fluxes are best fit with the large grain models .",
    "these models require very different masses and our sed models show that they may be distinguished in the mid to far - ir measured by _",
    "sirtf _ and in the sub - mm measured by _",
    "sma _ and _ alma_. that is to say , although a simple power - law is not physically plausible in objects like hh30  irs , the issue of whether it adequately reproduces the sed can be determined with sufficient observation coverage .",
    "scattered light modeling of hh30  irs indicates that we are seeing a classical t  tauri star viewed almost edge - on .",
    "whitney & hartmann ( 1992 ) presented scattered light disk models for a range of viewing angles showing that edge - on disks , where the central star is obscured , will be most easily detectable .",
    "our edge - on sed models agree well with the current hh30  irs data and fig .",
    "7 shows model seds at a range of viewing angles .",
    "as expected , for viewing angles where the central source is unobscured , our hh30  irs models do indeed resemble the sed of a classical t  tauri star .",
    "the silicate features at @xmath79 and @xmath80 are most prominent in the ism dust model . as the grain size increases and the opacity",
    "is dominated by larger grains , the relative strengths of the silicate features decrease ( fig .  2 ) .",
    "this is reflected in the seds with the @xmath81 size distribution showing a very smooth sed across the silicate features .",
    "however , at present our models do not allow for different dust compositions at different locations within the disk as required for a detailed investigation of the disk chemistry and mineralogy through analysis of crystalline features ( e.g. , chiang et al .",

    "1995 ) , presumably driven by accretion luminosity .",
    "the low disk mass for hh30  irs derived using ism dust models is unlikely to support a large accretion rate in the context of @xmath36 disk theory",
    ". therefore the larger disk masses we derive are more appealing as they allow for significant accretion rates .",
    "figure  8 shows models which include disk heating from viscous accretion for model  1 , which has @xmath82 .",

    "a larger accretion luminosity produces too much @xmath87 emission compared to the observations .",
    "figure  8 also shows models in which the accretion luminosity is lower ( @xmath88% , 2% ) .",
    "pole - on viewing yields typical near - ir excesses arising from accretion disks .",
    "the large uncertainties in the @xmath78 fluxes in addition to the unknown @xmath89 and @xmath43 preclude an accurate determination of the accretion rate . however , the accretion rate we derive is comparable to the total outflow rate in the jets , @xmath90 estimated by bacciotti , eisloffel , & ray ( 1999 ) . the combination of sed models of more accurate _ sirtf _ fluxes and spectral line accretion diagnostics ( e.g. , gullbring et al .",
    "1998 ) are required for a more accurate determination of the accretion rate .",
    "a feature of monte carlo radiation transfer is that we may track the history of each individual photon packet within the simulation and determine the relative contributions to the total sed of direct , scattered , reprocessed , and accretion luminosity .",
    "figure  9 shows model seds for dust model  1 at inclinations @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 , and @xmath74 along with their component parts .",
    "the scattered light comprises stellar photons that have been ( multiply ) scattered ; thermal photons are stellar photons that have been absorbed , reprocessed , and possibly scattered by the disk ; accretion photons are those that initiated as accretion luminosity , but may have subsequently been scattered or absorbed and re - radiated .    for pole - on viewing , the sed is dominated by direct starlight at optical wavelengths and thermal ( i.e. , reprocessed ) disk emission at long wavelengths .",
    "accretion luminosity contributes significantly at near and mid - ir wavelengths , while scattered starlight contributes a few percent of the sed in the optical and near - ir and much less at longer wavelengths .",
    "scattering will always yield an excess above the photospheric level ( see also whitney & hartmann 1992 ) . for edge - on viewing ,",

    "our model comprises a central stellar source surrounded by a circumstellar disk whose structure was derived from modeling _ hst _ images .",

    "( 1998 ) using ism grains .",
    "the derived disk mass is a lower limit , since the sed is not very sensitive to large particles , such as rocks and planetesimals .",
    "estimations of disk mass from mm observations are uncertain due to the poorly known opacity at mm wavelengths . for hh30 s disk , reipurth et al .",
    "( 1993 ) estimated @xmath97 if @xmath98 or @xmath99 if @xmath100 .",
    "the opacity for our grain size distribution is @xmath101 , again demonstrating the sensitivity of the disk mass estimate to the adopted mm opacity .",
    "observations with _ sirtf _ and at sub - mm wavelengths will give a more complete picture of the sed of hh30  irs and other edge - on disks , allowing us to further constrain the dust size distribution and ascertain the extent of the grain growth within the disk .",
    "in particular , the sed in the @xmath102 range will discriminate between the dust model with exponential cut - off ( corresponding to @xmath82 ) and the single power - law size distributions which require much more massive disks ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "grain growth in protoplanetary disks has been inferred from observations : e.g. , shallower slopes of the long wavelength seds and larger mm fluxes compared with those expected for ism dust parameters ( beckwith et al .",
    "1990 ; beckwith & sargent 1991 ) ; the observed wavelength dependence of dust lane widths in near - ir images of hh30  irs ( cotera et al . 2001 ) .",

    "although the current implementation of our code adopts the same grain size distribution throughout the disk , our sed modeling is consistent with grain growth to larger than @xmath0 , even in the upper layers of the disk atmosphere that dominate the infrared sed .",
    "the mass that we derive for hh30 s disk is more appealing than the low disk mass derived from ism dust models which are unlikely to support large accretion rates .",
    "more massive disks support larger accretion rates and for hh30  irs we infer an accretion luminosity of @xmath106 .",
    "our derived accretion rate , @xmath85 , is uncertain as it depends on the unknown @xmath89 and @xmath43 viscosity parameter and the accurate determination of @xmath42 requires spectral line observations in addition to sed modeling .",
