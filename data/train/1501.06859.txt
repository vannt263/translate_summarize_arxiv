    "liquid crystal elastomers are rubber - like solids that display unusual mechanical properties like soft elasticity and develop fine - scale microstructure under deformation .",
    "this material consists of cross - linked polymer chains where rigid rod - like elements ( mesogens ) are either incorporated into the main chain or are pendent from them .",
    "these mesogens have temperature - dependent interaction which results in phases of orientational and positional order @xcite .",
    "we refer to two phases : a high temperature _ isotropic _ phase , where thermal fluctuations thwart any attempt at order and a _",
    "phase , where the mesogens have a characteristic orientation but no positional order .",
    "this average orientation of the mesogens in the nematic phase is represented by a director .",
    "nematic - elastic coupling is a key feature of these materials @xcite .",
    "the isotropic to nematic phase transformation is accompanied by a very significant distortion of the solid : typically elongation along the director and contraction transverse to it .",
    "further , the director can rotate relative to the polymer matrix .",
    "this novel mechanism induces a degeneracy in the low energy states associated with the entropic elasticity of the polymer network , whereby the material has a non - trivial set of nearly stress - free shape changing configurations .",
    "this degeneracy can lead to fine - scale microstructure like stripe domains where the director alternates between two orientations in alternating stripes .",
    "together , all of this gives rise to soft - elasticity @xcite .",
    "a theory of nematic elastomers , and specifically the entropic elasticity associated with it , was formulated in warner et al .",
    "@xcite , and was used to show the emergence of stripe domains and soft - elasticity .",
    "mathematically , the energy functional is not weakly lower - semicontinuous resulting in possible non - existence of minimizers : briefly minimizing sequences develop rapid oscillations that result in lower energy than its weak limit .",
    "these rapid oscillations are interpreted as the fine - scale microstructure in the material .",
    "desimone and dolzmann @xcite computed the relaxation wherein the energy density is replaced with an effective energy density that accounts for all possible microstructures .",
    "the effective energy does indeed show soft elasticity , and can be used as by conti et al .",
    "@xcite to explain complex deformation patterns in clamped stretch experiments on nematic elastomer sheets @xcite .",
    "experiments on nematic elastomers , like the one highlighted , have largely been performed on thin sheets or membranes .",
    "these structures typically have instabilities such as wrinkling , and consequently membranes of usual elastic materials are unable to sustain compression and the state of stress is limited to uniaxial and biaxial tension .",
    "thus elastic membranes have been described heuristically by theories like the tension field theory of mansfield @xcite , and such theories have been obtained systematically from three - dimensional theories @xcite .    the goal of this work is to derive an effective theory of thin membranes of liquid crystal elastomers that accounts not only for the formation of fine - scale microstructure but also instabilities like wrinkling .",
    "an important insight that results from this is the possible states of stress in these materials .",
    "we find that like usual elastic membranes , membranes of liquid crystal elastomers are also incapable of sustaining compression , and the state of stress is limited to uniaxial and biaxial tension .",
    "importantly , due to the ability of these materials to form microstructure , there is a large range of deformation gradients involving unequal stretch where the state of stress is purely equi - biaxial .",
    "consequently , a membrane of this material has zero shear stress even when subjected to a shear deformation within a certain range .",
    "we start with a three dimensional variational model of liquid crystal elastomers , derive the effective behavior of a membrane  a domain where one dimension is small compared to the other two  as the @xmath0limit of a suitably normalized functional as the ratio of these dimension goes to zero following ledret and raoult @xcite and others @xcite .",
    "our variational model is based on a helmholtz free energy density that has two contributions .",
    "the first contribution captures the elasticity associated with the polymer matrix .",
    "developed by bladon , terentjev and warner @xcite , it is a generalization of the classical neo - hookean model to account for the local anisotropy due to the director . the second contribution following frank @xcite penalizes the spatial non - uniformity of directors , and has been widely used in the study of liquid crystals . in the context of liquid crystal elastomers ,",
    "this penalizes domain walls ",
    "narrow regions that separate domains of uniform director .",
    "the competition between entropic elasticity and frank elasticity , precisely the square - root of the ratio of the moduli @xmath2 of the frank elasticity to @xmath3 of the entropic elasticity",
    " introduces a length - scale .",
    "it turns out ( e.g. @xcite ) that @xmath4 .",
    "note that the thickness @xmath5 of a realistic membrane is on the order of @xmath6 depending on the application .",
    "thus , one has two small parameters , and one needs to study the joint limit as both @xmath7 and @xmath5 go to zero , but at possibly different rates .",
    "we do so by setting @xmath8 and studying the limit @xmath9 .",
    "we find in theorem [ 1407251605 ] that the @xmath0limit and thus the resulting theory is independent of the ratio @xmath10 .",
    "this is similar of the result of shu @xcite in the context of membranes of materials undergoing martensitic phase transitions . in other words ,",
    "the length - scale on which the material can form microstructure does not affect the membrane limit as long as it is small compared to the lateral extent of the membrane .",
    "consequently , the @xmath0limit we obtain coincides with the result of conti and dolzmann @xcite who studied the case @xmath11 . in fact",
    ", our proof draws extensively from their work .",
    "specifically , their result provides a lower bound and our recovery sequence is adapted from theirs .",
    "the @xmath0limit is characterized by an energy per unit area that depends only on the tangential gradient of the deformation .",
    "it is obtained from the density of the entropic elasticity by minimizing out the normal component followed by relaxation or quasi - convexification .",
    "we compute this by obtaining upper and lower bounds , and provide an explicit formula in theorem [ 1407231520 ] ( also shown schematically in figure 1 ) .",
    "it is characterized by four regions depending on the in - plane stretch : @xmath12 a solid region where there is no relaxation , @xmath13 a liquid region where wrinkling and microstructure formation drive the effective energy to zero , @xmath14 a wrinkling region where wrinkling relaxes the energy and @xmath15 a microstructure region where stripe domains relaxe the energy .",
    "the techniques employed here are in the same spirit as those employed by desimone and dolzmann @xcite in three dimensional nematic elastomers .",
    "we also study the oscillations related to the relaxation by characterizing the gradient young measures associated with the minimizing sequences in theorem [ th : char ] .",
    "we show that the oscillations in the region @xmath16 are necessarily planar oscillations of the nematic director and involve no out of plane deformation while those in the region @xmath17 are characterized by uniform nematic director and wrinkling .",
    "we use the characterization of the gradient young measure to define the effective state of stress , and show that this coincides with the derivative of the effective or relaxed energy in theorem [ stresstheorem ] .",
    "the cauchy stress is given in ( [ eq : memstress ] ) : it is general biaxial tension in @xmath18 , zero in @xmath19 , uniaxial tension in @xmath20 and equi - biaxial tension in @xmath21 . as described above",
    ", the unique attributes of liquid crystal elastomers give rise to this region of equi - biaxial tension compared to membranes of usual elastic materials .",
    "this paper is organized in the following manner : in section [ 1407231507 ] , we fix some notation and comment on background results which are used throughout the paper . in section [ modnem ] , we describe our model for nematic elastomers , a model which incorporates the entropic elasticity of the polymer matrix and an elastic penalty on the spatial gradient of the director . in section [ memtheory ] , we derive our effective theory for nematic elastomer membranes based on a notion of @xmath22-convergence . in section [ effen ]",
    ", we provide an explicit formula for the energy density in our effective theory . in section [ micro ]",
    ", we characterize the microstructure in the aforementioned regions @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "finally , in section [ stress1 ] , we conclude with a notion of stress in this effective theory and its physical implications .",
    "we gather here the notation and some background results which we use throughout the paper .",

    "it follows that @xmath54 later in this paper we label the norm of @xmath55 , with @xmath44 a @xmath56 matrix , with @xmath57 .",
    "furtheremore , we simply write @xmath58 both when dealing with the adjugate of @xmath59 and @xmath56 matrices .    finally , we state a version of the polar decomposition theorem : given any @xmath60 and any rectangular cartesian basis , there exist @xmath61 such that @xmath62 for @xmath63 in fact , @xmath64 are the principle values of @xmath44 .",
