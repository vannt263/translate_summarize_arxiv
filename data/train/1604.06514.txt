    "we find that coupling between these elements can be well - controlled by changes in circuit parameters set with lithographic precision .",
    "finally , we integrate this system with millisecond 3d cavities and show that the combined systems remain highly coherent . in the near - term , this platform allows for significantly more complex many - resonator , many - qubit circuits .",
    "when combined with more advanced techniques for fabricating 3d enclosures using lithography and multi - wafer bonding@xcite , the coax - line provides an attractive route towards long - term scaling .",
    "we design and measure circuits placed in 3d enclosures that avoid many common forms of loss in systems .",
    "a seamless circular waveguide forms the package enclosure and acts as a ground plane ( figure  [ design]a ) .",
    "circuit elements are patterned on a sapphire substrate to define each mode of the device . deposited and machined metals are both chosen to be aluminum . where no metal is present on - chip , the waveguide attenuates signals below its cutoff frequency ( typically 40ghz ) .",
    "the chip is suspended within the enclosure by clamps at each end , where the fields from critical circuit elements are exponentially attenuated .",
    "we evaluate device performance beginning with one simple element : a resonator . choosing a quasi - stripline architecture",
    ", we pattern a @xmath3 resonator on the substrate and position it near the center of the enclosure .",
    "the resonant frequency is primarily determined by the length of the conducting strip , but also depends on chip size , chip placement , and enclosure diameter .",
    "inspired by the robust coupling method used in 3d cavities , we introduce input and output signals using two evanescently - coupled pins within sub - cutoff waveguides that intersect the primary waveguide enclosure .",
    "pins are recessed to an adjustable depth within each coupling enclosure , located above each end of the stripline .",
    "both pins are used in transmission measurements ( figure  [ design]b ) .",
    "just one pin can be used to measure in reflection or feedline - coupled transmission@xcite . as described later",
    ", this approach yields predictable couplings that can be varied over a wide dynamic range without compromising package integrity .",
    "resonant mode . dashed arrows indicate the input and output paths used in transmission measurements . coupling pins ( gold ) , recessed within two smaller waveguides that intersect the primary enclosure , couple evanescently and carry signals to external connectors .",
    "( b ) the configuration of couplers in a symmetric transmission experiment . ]    to verify that these devices are suited to complex experiments , we first demonstrate long lifetimes .",
    "for resonators , this requires achieving a high internal quality factor ( @xmath4 ) at sufficiently weak coupling ( high coupling quality factor @xmath5 ) .",
    "we measure these parameters by cooling coax - line resonators to @xmath6 20mk and exciting single - photon - or - less circulating power .",
    "the devices are connected in a feedline - coupled configuration and transmission coefficient @xmath7 is measured using a .",
    "coupling parameters are extracted from fits to @xmath7 ( figure  [ spurious]a inset ) .",
    "measurements are usually performed in an undercoupled configuration ( @xmath8 , with @xmath5 up to @xmath9 ) so that the total quality factor @xmath0 ( @xmath10 ) is a direct measure of the internal losses .",
    "the best reported @xmath4 for lithographically - defined aluminum - on - sapphire resonators fabricated under similar conditions ( e - beam evaporation , no substrate annealing ) is @xmath61  million@xcite .",
    "we observe @xmath4 as high as @xmath11 at single - photon power , surpassing this by about an order of magnitude .",
    "this suggests that quality factors in lithographic devices are not solely dependent on materials or fabrication methods , but are also affected by package contributions .    by restricting wave propagation to seamless waveguides with cutoffs far above the operating frequency , we demonstrate that mode coupling can be made arbitrarily weak without additional structures or filtering@xcite . by varying the coupling attenuation distance and measuring @xmath5",
    ", we see good agreement with the expected exponential scaling over six decades with no observed upper limit ( figure  [ spurious]b ) .",
    "control over a large dynamic range in coupling strengths is possible by simply modifying pin length .",
    "therefore , we can achieve very strong coupling ( @xmath12 ) to some elements used for measurement or readout , at the same time as weak couplings ( @xmath13 ) used to excite and control long - lived memory elements .",
    "another critical requirement of a properly - designed package is to prevent spurious electromagnetic modes . using stronger coupling and a symmetric transmission configuration , we measured @xmath7 to determine the spectral `` cleanliness '' over a large range .",
    "because the enclosure should attenuate any modes below its cutoff frequency in the absence of package seams , we expect the measured background to be low , dominated by the noise of other elements in the measurement chain .",
    "figure  [ spurious]c shows a calibrated @xmath7 trace within the measurement bandwidth of our amplifier . aside from the fundamental ( @xmath3 ) and first harmonic ( @xmath14 ) modes arising from the stripline resonator ,",
    "no other modes are observed .",
    "this confirms that good mode control can be achieved using a coax - line architecture .        as the next step in increasing complexity , we pattern a transmon qubit alongside the resonator@xcite .",
    "we characterize the system s coherence and compare measured parameters to simulation .",
    "we control the qubit using a weakly - coupled port and read out through the resonator and its more strongly coupled port .",
    "these qubits exhibit 3080@xmath2s lifetimes , near to the state of the art values for transmon @xmath15 s ( figure  [ highq]a ) .",
    "this is equivalent to quality factors @xmath16 million , not far from those of resonators .",
    "undercoupled resonators had equally high @xmath4 with and without qubits .",
    "important system parameters , such as mode frequencies and qubit anharmonicity , were found to agree well with predictions from finite - element simulations of the design@xcite .",
    "this is the first indication that additional complexity can be added to a coax - line device without decreasing control over parameters or coherence values .",
    "the presence of a lithographic resonator - qubit system enables us to test whether on - chip element coupling follows the same waveguide - attenuated behavior as external coupling .",
    "we expect that by varying the distance @xmath17 between element ends ( figure  [ highq]b inset ) , the chip enclosure will exponentially attenuate electric field @xmath18 .",

    "a full system finite - element simulation ( solid blue line ) predicts similar scaling . ]",
    "the lifetimes of resonators and qubits in this system can be understood by examining the spatial participation of each mode in dissipative dielectrics and conductors .",
    "the large resonator mode volume dilutes lossy material participation  the same effect that increases coherence of 3d cavities relative to traditional planar circuits . by measuring resonators in waveguide enclosures with different diameters , we find that higher @xmath4 generally corresponds with larger diameter@xcite .",
    "this scaling behavior is consistent with loss originating from waveguide surface resistance , a waveguide dielectric layer , or on - chip dielectric layers , but does not distinguish between these mechanisms .    even though the enclosure body is seam - free",
    ", we can evaluate whether seams at each end introduce dissipation .",
    "we predict their effect using a model of seam loss as a distributed admittance@xcite applied to simulation .",
    "the simulation places a conservative bound , @xmath29 , on typical designs separated 7 mm from the waveguide end . positioning striplines @xmath6 3 mm from one end of an enclosure produced an immeasurable effect on @xmath4 , thereby raising this bound . since typical devices see significantly greater isolation from end seams , they appear unlikely to affect performance . therefore , coax - line devices are well - positioned to act as a testbed for alternative loss mechanisms .",
    "further studies will be required to pinpoint the dominant sources of loss , but the coherence levels already achieved allow us to increase the system s complexity further .",
    "many circuit elements must be integrated within a single enclosure to allow more versatile , hardware - efficient experiments . to demonstrate an instance of a long - lived element in the presence of significant complexity",

    "these qubit lifetimes are among the best measured in 3d cavities , and the coaxial stub resonator @xmath26 does not decrease when a qubit is added .",
    "this suggests that no additional sources of dissipation are introduced when these elements are combined into a single , seamless package .",
    "integration with 3d cavities is not strictly necessary to produce a module with many coherent circuit elements . in an all - lithographic system on a single chip",
