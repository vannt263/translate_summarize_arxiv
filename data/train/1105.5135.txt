    "the large hadron collider ( lhc ) has embarked on a broad campaign to discover weak scale supersymmetry ( susy , see  @xcite for a review ) .",
    "many susy searches are now underway , in hopes of discovering energetic jets , leptons , and/or photons produced by the decays of superpartners .",
    "a common feature of most susy searches  @xcite is that they demand a large amount of missing transverse energy @xmath3 as a strategy to reduce standard model ( sm ) backgrounds .",
    "this approach is motivated by @xmath0-parity , which , if preserved , implies that the lightest superpartner ( lsp ) is stable and contributes to missing energy . in this paper",
    ", we introduce a new class of susy models that preserve @xmath0-parity , yet lack missing energy signatures .",
    "these models of _ stealth supersymmetry _ will be missed by standard susy searches .",
    "even when @xmath0-parity is preserved , the lightest sm ( ` visible ' sector ) superpartner ( lvsp ) can decay , as long as there is a lighter state that is charged under @xmath0-parity .",
    "this occurs , for example , when susy is broken at a low scale ( as in gauge mediated breaking , reviewed by  @xcite ) , and the lvsp can decay to a gravitino , which is stable and contributes to missing energy . here",
    ", we consider the additional possibility that there exists a new hidden sector of particles at the weak scale , but lighter than the lvsp .",
    "if susy is broken at a low scale , it is natural for the hidden sector to have a spectrum that is approximately supersymmetric , with a small amount of susy breaking first introduced by interactions with sm fields .",
    "the generic situation described above is all that is required to suppress missing energy in susy cascades .",
    "the lvsp can decay into a hidden sector field , @xmath4 , which we take to be fermionic , and heavier than its scalar superpartner , @xmath5 .",
    "then , @xmath4 decays to a stable gravitino and its superpartner , @xmath6 , and @xmath5 , which is even under @xmath0-parity , can decay back to sm states like jets , @xmath7 .",
    "because the spectrum in the hidden sector is approximately supersymmetric , the mass splitting is small within the @xmath5 supermultiplet , @xmath8 .",
    "therefore , there is no phase space for the gravitino to carry momentum : the resulting gravitino is soft and missing energy is greatly reduced .",
    "we illustrate the spectrum , and decay path , in figure  [ fig : schema ] , where @xmath5 and @xmath4 correspond to a singlet and singlino .",
    "we emphasize that this scenario requires no special tuning of masses .",
    "the approximate degeneracy between @xmath5 and @xmath4 is enforced by a symmetry : supersymmetry !    ]    two assumptions can be relaxed .",
    "first , a fermion other than the gravitino can end the cascade , if its mass fits in the small available phase space : we can generalize to @xmath9 for a variety of light neutral fermions @xmath10 . because gravitino couplings are @xmath11-suppressed , such decays are often preferred if available .",
    "then , we need not assume low - scale susy breaking ; gravity mediation can also give rise to this scenario , if a suppressed susy - breaking splitting between @xmath12 and @xmath5 is natural .",
    "this calls for sequestering , an idea that already plays a key role in such scenarios as anomaly mediation  @xcite .",
    "a hidden sector may therefore eliminate missing energy , making the susy searches ineffective at the lhc .",
    "moreover , the lep and tevatron limits on supersymmetry mostly rely on missing energy , and do not apply to these models .",
    "this raises the interesting possibility of _ hidden _ susy : superpartners may be light enough to have been produced copiously at lep and the tevatron , yet missed , because their decays do not produce missing energy .",
    "our proposal is morally similar , but more far reaching , than the idea that the higgs boson may be light , but hidden from lep by exotic decay modes ( see the references within  @xcite , and more recently  @xcite ) .",
    "it also has a great deal in common with susy models containing hidden valleys  @xcite , though in previous discussions @xmath13 has been suppressed by longer decay chains , rather than supersymmetric degenerate states .",
    "fortunately , there are a number of experimental handles that can be used to discover stealth supersymmetry . possible discovery modes that we emphasize in this paper include highly displaced vertices , triple resonances such as @xmath1 , and the presence of a very large number of @xmath2-jets .",
    "there are many possible implementations of stealth susy . to illustrate the simplicity of our idea , we present two minimal models , where the hidden sector consists of one singlet chiral superfield , @xmath14 , with a supersymmetric mass , @xmath15 . in the first example , @xmath14 couples to sm higgses , @xmath16 , and sees susy breaking at tree - level . in the second example , @xmath14 couples to a messenger field , @xmath17 , charged under the sm gauge symmetries , @xmath18 , and experiences susy breaking at one - loop .",
    "we add a singlet chiral superfield @xmath14 , as in  @xcite , but suppose it feels susy breaking only through interactions with the mssm higgs : @xmath20 in the limit of small @xmath21 , the model has vacua near @xmath22 and @xmath23 , either of which can be lower depending on the parameters . given small @xmath21 and @xmath24 , the mass splitting in @xmath14 is @xmath25 .",
    "the lightest field in the @xmath14 multiplet can be the scalar @xmath26 or pseudoscalar @xmath27 , depending on regions of parameter space considered .",
    "the ( pseudo)scalar decays dominantly to @xmath28 through mixing with the higgs . a benchmark point is shown in table  [ tab : shuhd ] .",
    "@xmath29 & @xmath30 + @xmath31 & @xmath32 + @xmath33 & @xmath34 + @xmath35 & @xmath36 + @xmath37 & @xmath38 + @xmath39 & @xmath40 + @xmath41 & @xmath42 +      this scenario involves two more chiral supermultiplets @xmath17 and @xmath44 in the @xmath45 and @xmath46 of @xmath47 .",
    "we consider a superpotential : @xmath48 here @xmath49 and @xmath50 are supersymmetric masses , with @xmath51 tev and @xmath52 gev .",
    "soft masses @xmath53 for the @xmath54 and @xmath55 in @xmath17 ( and equal ones for @xmath56 ) are generated by gauge mediation and through rg running lead to a negative soft mass - squared for the scalar @xmath26 @xmath57 for @xmath58 tev ) , this leads to splittings of order 10 gev or less with reasonable choices of couplings and scales .    integrating out @xmath17 and @xmath44 at one loop yields operators such as @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "these interactions would induce decays of the gluino to singlino plus gluon and of the scalar @xmath26 to gluons , as in fig .",
    "[ fig : schema ] .",
    "similar operators between @xmath14 and other sm vector multiplets exist , which allow decays of neutralinos ( charginos ) to singlino plus @xmath61 ( @xmath62 ) and of @xmath26 to two @xmath63 s .",
    "a benchmark point is shown in table  [ tab : syy ] .",
    "finally we comment that the supersymmetric mass of @xmath14 could arise dynamically through retrofitting , which can also be related to the susy - breaking scale  @xcite .",
    "global symmetries can be arranged to forbid large susy breaking for @xmath14 that would spoil our picture .",
    "@xmath64 & @xmath65 + @xmath66 & @xmath67 + @xmath68 & @xmath69 + @xmath70&@xmath71 + @xmath72 & +      similar spectra and phenomenology could be achieved in many other models .",
    "one next - to - minimal possibility is to add to the mssm a vector superfield @xmath73 , which is associated with a @xmath74 spontaneously broken at the weak scale .",
    "sm fields transforming under the @xmath74 would transmit the susy breaking to @xmath73 .",
    "like the @xmath75 model , the mass splitting is of order @xmath76 ( 10 gev ) .",
    "a similar generalization could involve supersymmetric vectorlike confinement  @xcite .",
    "even the mssm may include a form of stealth susy , if there is an approximate degeneracy between the right - handed stop and top masses .",
    "the stop can decay to a top plus a soft gravitino or light bino , which may obscure light susy in top backgrounds .",
    "this scenario is natural when @xmath77 and the stop mixing is small .    as mentioned in the introduction",
    ", we can relax the gravitino lsp assumption .",
    "an sm singlet chiral superfield @xmath78 kept light by a symmetry , with @xmath79 in the superpotential , allows @xmath80 .",
    "such generalizations allow for prompt decays even when the susy breaking scale is not small .",
    "extending to gravity mediation requires sequestering of @xmath81 corrections to @xmath82 , which is a model - building complication we leave for future work .",
    "the decay width of @xmath83 ( at @xmath84 and neglecting mixings ) is given by  @xcite : @xmath85 for susy breaking scale @xmath86 , @xmath87100 gev and @xmath88 90 gev , the decay length is 8 cm .",
    "in addition to the @xmath89 suppression of any decay to gravitino , the small mass splitting further suppresses the two - body decay while it enhances the branching ratio of the three - body decay through an off - shell @xmath5 , @xmath90 , which has differential width  @xcite : @xmath91 where @xmath92 for a decay through a yukawa coupling @xmath93 , whereas @xmath94 for @xmath5 decaying through an operator @xmath95 . in this case",
    ", the missing energy could be increased . however , as we show in figure  [ fig : threebody ] , as long as @xmath96 is small , the two - body decay will always dominate .",
    "can become important if @xmath97 is small and @xmath96 is not too small .",
    "the solid line is for @xmath5 decaying through a yukawa coupling , whereas the dashed line is for @xmath5 decaying to gauge bosons.[fig : threebody ] ]",
    "missing energy is dramatically reduced by small mass splittings .",
    "the gravitino lsp , in the rest frame of a decaying singlino , has momentum @xmath98 , implying a smaller @xmath13 in the lab frame .",
    "figure  [ fig : metdemo ] shows the @xmath13 distributions for a 300 gev gluino decaying in a standard susy scenario to a stable 100 gev bino , versus decaying through a 100 gev singlino with the singlet at various masses .",
    "this simulation used pythia 6.4  @xcite , bridge  @xcite , and pgs as a simple detector model  @xcite .",
    "a splitting of 10 gev reduces the @xmath13 by an order of magnitude , while a 1 gev splitting saturates the @xmath13 reduction , as jet mismeasurement becomes the dominant effect . for longer lifetimes , an additional source of @xmath13",
    "arises when the momentum and the vector from the origin to the calorimeter are no longer aligned .",
    "we modeled this effect and found that it adds to the tail of @xmath13 distributions , but is a very small effect for 10 cm lifetimes and only moderately important at 50 cm lifetimes .",
    "we have modeled several atlas and cms searches  @xcite , and present the strongest estimated limits on @xmath99 production with @xmath100 , @xmath101 in fig .  [",

    "[ fig : schema ] .",

    "the region above the curves is excluded .",
    "the curves are labeled by singlino mass and begin where @xmath103.[fig : metdemo ] ]",
    "while standard missing @xmath104 searches overlook stealth susy , a variety of experimental handles exist .",
    "the small width ( eq .  [ eq : smallwidth ] ) gives rise to displacements of millimeters , centimeters , or more in stealth susy events .",
    "high multiplicity final states can also be an interesting general search strategy  @xcite .",
    "other signatures are more model - dependent . in the @xmath105 model",
    ", @xmath26 dominantly decays to @xmath28 , so that most events will include at least four @xmath2 s . because the singlino mixes with higgsinos , other decays like @xmath106 can occur to produce more @xmath2 s .",
    "in fact , a chain @xmath107 can produce as many as 12 @xmath2 s in a single event !",
    "the displaced vertex and @xmath2-jet signatures of stealth susy resemble aspects of hidden valley phenomenology  @xcite . in the @xmath108 model , the colored @xmath17 fields may decay only through gut - suppressed operators , opening the possibility of long - lived , @xmath0-hadron - like phenomenology  @xcite .",
    "the uncolored fields in @xmath17 could be a candidate for dark matter , if direct detection through a @xmath109 is forbidden by an inelastic splitting  @xcite .",
    "because the gravitino is soft , invariant masses made of visible particles may reconstruct peaks for @xmath0-odd particles .",
    "for instance , the decay chain @xmath110 will have @xmath111 and @xmath112 .",
    "we advocate searching for resonances composed of a gauge boson ( @xmath113 ) and a pair of jets , to reconstruct bino and wino ( co-)lvsps .",
    "( a @xmath1 resonance has been discussed in pure - glue hidden valleys  @xcite . ) a gluino decay chain , @xmath114 , can lead to a 3-jet resonance , which strongly resembles the @xmath115 decay in r - parity violating susy with @xmath116 couplings .",
    "an approach to overcoming combinatorics to find @xmath117 resonances based on cuts in the @xmath118 plane has been pursued by cdf and cms  @xcite .",
    "our simulations show that these techniques have similar reach for our gluino lvsp case .     for all triplets passing a cut on mass relative to @xmath119 .",
    "note the peak at the bino mass of 300 gev and the falling feature near the squark mass of 500 gev .",
    "green , dashed : @xmath120 for jet pairs tagged as an @xmath26 decay via vertexing , together with each photon ( no cut on @xmath119 is applied).[fig : photonjet ] ]    we have studied squark pair production , with decays as in eq .  [",
    "eq : squarkchain ] , in more detail .",
    "we fix a benchmark point : @xmath121 gev for @xmath122 and @xmath123 with other squarks decoupled , @xmath124 gev , @xmath125 gev , and @xmath126 gev .",
    "we generate events with pythia and a modified decay table , and reconstruct jets using fastjet s anti-@xmath127 algorithm ( @xmath128 )  @xcite . studies of @xmath129 backgrounds ( using madgraph 4  @xcite with mlm matching  @xcite , pythia , and comparisons to a recent cms study  @xcite that measured @xmath130 distributions ) show that requiring two photons with @xmath131 gev and @xmath132 , along with at least two jets with @xmath133 gev and @xmath134 gev , reduces the background below the signal .",
    "the challenge is then combinatorics .",
    "we apply the technique of refs .",
    "@xcite : we find that forming all @xmath135 triplets and requiring @xmath136 gev brings out features from the combinatoric background .",
    "the distribution is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : photonjet ] ; its broad outline would become apparent with around 1 fb@xmath137 of data , while several fb@xmath137 would be needed to make the structure clear .",
    "the expected feature is present at the bino mass , @xmath138 gev , but there is also an apparent edge or endpoint near the squark mass , @xmath139 gev .",
    "in fact , we find that many jets have substructure from @xmath140 reconstructed as one jet , a  singlet jet . \" with sufficient data ( tens of fb@xmath137 ) the bino is also visible in @xmath141 for massive jets .",
    "this resembles using substructure to reconstruct neutralinos and squarks in r - parity violating susy  @xcite . in the @xmath142 model , the  singlet jet \" contains two @xmath2 subjets which could be searched for by the same techniques as proposed to discover a boosted light higgs  @xcite .",
    "we also show in fig .",
    "[ fig : photonjet ] that if displaced vertices are used to select jet pairs from the same decay , combinatoric effects can be greatly reduced .",
    "we leave more detailed studies of event reconstruction and jet substructure for future work .",
    "stealth susy gives a natural escape for supersymmetry from @xmath13 searches , but it can be detected through displaced vertices , @xmath2-jet multiplicities , and mass peaks reconstructed from gauge bosons and jets .",
    "measurements of such events could reveal the existence of a nearly degenerate fermion and boson .",
    "( the idea that supersymmetry may first be discovered in a hidden sector appears in  @xcite . )",
    "one simple example is production of a sbottom lvsp in the @xmath105 model . the techniques of  @xcite plus @xmath2-tagging could find 3@xmath2 resonances , but with a production cross section consistent with a colored scalar at the measured mass .",
    "( tagging of @xmath2 jets is complicated by the fact that even non-@xmath2 jets will be displaced in these models , but soft lepton tags could still be useful on a subset of events . ) the inconsistency between the apparent production of a scalar and a measured fermionic final state would be a strong signal that a soft fermion has escaped .",
    "we will take a closer look at techniques for confirming the spins of @xmath143 and @xmath26 and establishing this smoking gun for supersymmetry in future work .",
