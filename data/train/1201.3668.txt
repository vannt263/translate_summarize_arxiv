    "the most recent measurement of the forward - backward asymmetry , @xmath0 , in top quark pair production at the tevatron  @xcite was performed by the cdf collaboration using a data sample with 5.3 fb@xmath1 of integrated luminosity  @xcite .",
    "after background subtraction , the value of @xmath0 in the center - of - mass ( cm ) frame of the top quarks is @xmath2 which constitutes about two standard deviations above the next - to - leading - order ( nlo ) standard model ( sm ) prediction  @xcite @xmath3 despite the discrepancy in @xmath0 , the total @xmath4 production cross section is in good agreement with the sm prediction . in fact , with 4.6 fb@xmath1 collected luminosity , the top quark pair production cross section  @xcite yields the result @xmath5 for a top quark of mass 172.5 gev , which is in good agreement with the theoretical prediction  @xcite @xmath6 where mcfm stands for monte carlo for femtobarn processes  @xcite . measurements of the @xmath7 differential cross section with the @xmath7 invariant mass ( @xmath8 ) , @xmath9 were also performed by the cdf collaboration  @xcite . with an integrated luminosity of 2.7 fb@xmath1 cdf has tested the @xmath10 spectrum for consistency with the sm .",
    "the results are presented in table [ tab : invmass ] .",
    "they have concluded that there is no evidence of non - sm physics in @xmath10 distributions .",
    "whatever new physics explains the forward - backward asymmetry in @xmath7 production , it has to comply with all other measurements that are in agreement with the sm .",
    "finally , measurements of the asymmetry for two regions of the top - antitop rapidity difference ( @xmath11 ) and for two regions of the invariant mass ( @xmath12 ) were performed by the cdf collaboration in  @xcite .",
    "the results are presented in table  [ tab : ymass ] together with the theoretical predictions .",
    "the asymmetry at high mass is 3.4 standard deviations above the nlo prediction for the charge asymmetry of qcd .",
    "recently the electroweak contributions to the asymmetry were re - analysed  @xcite just to conclude that the observed mass - dependent forward - backward asymmetry still shows a 3@xmath13 deviation in the high mass region .",
    "inclusion of corrections beyond nlo does not change this picture as well  @xcite .",
    "the separate results at high mass and large @xmath11 contain partially independent information on the asymmetry mechanism .",
    "therefore , a total of 14 observables were measured at the tevatron .",
    "this set of experimental values will be used to investigate whether the complete set of effective dimension six operators is able to describe the possible new physics responsible for the observed discrepancies while retaining the measurements in agreement with the sm . recently",
    "@xcite has measured @xmath0 with 5.4 fb@xmath1 of collected luminosity . as discussed in  @xcite",
    ", their analysis does not observe a significant rise of the `` folded '' detector level asymmetry with respect to @xmath14 and @xmath11 . until these results are unfolded they",
    "can not be directly compared to the cdf ones , even if at the detector level they appear to be consistent within errors .",
    "we did not use the results  @xcite in our analysis .",
    ".cdf measurements of @xmath15  @xcite ( integrated in each bin ) .",
    "we bin - wise scale our sm result ( at lo ) to match the sm - nlo result to emulate a @xmath8 dependent @xmath16-factor for fitting .",
    "the sm - nlo values are extracted from the plot in  @xcite .",
    "[ tab : invmass ] [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     in table .",
    "[ tab:4f ] , we show the best fit point along with @xmath17 and @xmath18 bcis .",
    "the best fit point is the one with least @xmath19 .",
    "as seen in figure  [ fig:4f3 ] , only @xmath20 operators have relevant contributions to both the asymmetries and the cross sections .",
    "the weak operators , @xmath21 do not interfere with the sm diagrams , contributing therefore more to the cross sections and much less to the asymmetries .",
    "thus , they are strongly constrained through the measured values of the cross sections .",
    "the @xmath22 operators contribute only to the cross sections and consequently are also strongly constrained and irrelevant as possible new physics contributions .",
    "again , due to the negative correlations between the cross section and the asymmetries , there is a slight tension in the fits .",
    "this leads to a mild preference for lower values of the total cross section .",
    "the asymmetries , on the other hand , are reasonably well reproduced .",
    "we note that , @xmath23 prefers to be positive with 4f operators .",
    "in this section we discuss all possible bounds on the dimension six effective operators described in the previous sections .",
    "our goal is to ascertain whether the values of the couplings multiplying each operator , that could explain the measured asymmetry discrepancy , are still allowed by the available experimental data .",
    "we start by considering the dimension six fcnc operators . in section iii b",
    "we have concluded that only effective operators stemming from the electroweak sector were likely to fit the tevatron data on the top quark better than the sm .",
    "in fact , it is the sizeable contributions from the @xmath24 operators that lead to the reduction in the @xmath25 for our fits .",
    "we again note that the combination @xmath26 with @xmath27 cl , it is almost certainly non - zero .",
    "therefore , we have now to focus on the bounds for operators @xmath28 to @xmath29 to understand if such a high value of the constants is not in contradiction with experimental data from other sources .",
    "a very complete analysis on the electroweak fcnc operators was performed in  @xcite using not only all available data from b physics but also the data from direct fcnc top decays ( the later will be updated in this work ) .",
    "the bounds obtained on the operators taken one at a time are  @xcite @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 while the best bound on @xmath33 was shown to come from the direct constraint on @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "therefore , to satisfy @xmath26 one needs @xmath36 .",
    "however , such a value of @xmath33 would imply that @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "the most recent direct bounds on @xmath39 and @xmath34 are the ones from the tevatron , @xmath40  @xcite and from the lhc , @xmath41  @xcite , respectively .",
    "hence , it is clear that such high values of @xmath33 are disallowed by tevatron and lhc data on the direct searches for fcnc top decays with a photon or a z - boson in the final state .",
    "furthermore , indirect bounds from hera , where bounds on cross sections are converted on bounds on the branching ratio , set a limit @xmath42  @xcite . also , a combine study on b physics and tevatron data on top quark production cross section places an indirect bound on the sum of the fcnc branching ratios forcing them to be below the percent level  @xcite . in conclusion , experimental data from very different sources constrain the operators that could explain the asymmetry in such a way that we consider that it is very unlikely that the observed discrepancy could be explained by these operators .",
    "contrary to the the dimension six fcnc operators , there are no useful bounds on the four fermion operators involving two top quarks and this is even more so if the top is right - handed .",
    "therefore , only the lhc could place constraints on these operators .",
    "however the values of the constants @xmath43 and @xmath44 that could help explain the discrepancy give an extra cross section that is always below 10 pb even for @xmath45 tev .",
    "hence , given the error of @xmath7 production cross section it is very unlikely that these operators will be constrained in the near future .",
    "in this work we have used a dimension six lagrangian with fcnc interaction together with four - fermion operators to gain some insight in understanding the discrepancy between the experimental values obtained for the top pair production asymmetry and the corresponding sm predictions .",
    "we have build a minimal set of operators and we have used an mcmc approach to find the best simultaneous fit of all independent operators to the available data .",
    "our conclusions regarding which operators give the best fit are as follows    * strong fcnc operators with coefficients @xmath46 are most likely close to zero ; * regarding electroweak fcnc operators with coefficients @xmath28 to @xmath29 we conclude that one of them must be non - zero ; * electroweak fcnc operators with coefficients @xmath47 are not relevant ; * bounds on electroweak fcnc operators reveal that it is very unlikely that the asymmetry can come from new physics described by these operators ; * four - fermion operators with coefficients @xmath20 contribute to the asymmetries as the ones with coefficients @xmath21 give small contributions ; the 4f combinations @xmath48 contribute to the asymmetries ; * four - fermion operators with coefficients @xmath22 contribute to the cross sections only ; * there is in all cases some tension between cross section and asymmetries when a simultaneous fit to all observables is performed ; * the contribution of 4f operators to the cross - section at lhc7 is of the order @xmath49 pb , which is allowed by the present estimates of the cross - section  @xcite .",
    "it is important to ask how do we figure out which operators are actually responsible for the asymmetry . to that end",
    "we note that the asymmetry , although called forward - backward , is actually a @xmath50-odd and for @xmath51 conserving interaction that can therefore be created by @xmath52-odd interactions as well .",
    "further , our operators contribute to the asymmetry in two ways : kinematically and dynamically .",
    "the @xmath53-channel diagrams with fcnc interaction naturally originate more top quarks in the direction of the incoming @xmath54-quark leading to a positive asymmetry as measured by the cdf collaboration .",
    "this coupling does not need to be chiral to produce the required asymmetry , although our operators are chiral . for the 4f case ,",
    "there is no such kinematical asymmetry generation and it is dominantly generated by the unbalance between left and right chiral operators interfering with the sm contribution .",
    "thus , in both cases , we have the presence of chiral interaction , which also incarnates in the form of polarization of the produced top - quark .",
    "hence , a study of such polarization effects  @xcite as a function of rapidity will be able to provide a probe of possible new physics .",
    "further , our operators are also constrained by the b - physics observables and for simplicity we have not accounted for them in our mcmc .",
    "we have nevertheless used the constraints from b - physics to conclude that fcnc operators are unlikely to account for the measured asymmetry at the tevatron    to conclude , we remark that the @xmath55observed at cdf can be casted in terms of dimension - six operators and we need more observables , from top - polarization and b - physics , to constrain them due to the multitude of these operators .",
    "we thank rohini godbole and saurabh rindani for useful discussions in the beginning of the collaboration .",
    "we also thank the whepp - xi organizers for their kind hospitality and for providing a great atmosphere that was the seed of the work presented in this paper .",
