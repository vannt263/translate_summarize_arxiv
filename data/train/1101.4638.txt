    "in a recent article @xcite we extracted the shear viscosity to entropy density ratio @xmath5 of the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) created in heavy - ion collisions at rhic by comparing experimental data for the eccentricity - scaled elliptic flow @xmath6 with calculations performed with vishnu  @xcite , a hybrid model that describes the qgp stage of the expansion of the collision fireball macroscopically with viscous hydrodynamics ( in which @xmath5 enters as an input parameter ) but switches to a microscopic description in the late hadronic phase where we solve the boltzmann equation with urqmd@xcite . an important step in this analysis was to ensure that ,",
    "as we compared theoretical curves for different @xmath5 values with the experimental data in order to find the value preferred by nature , we maintained a good description of the total charged hadron multiplicity and the hadron transverse momentum spectra as a function of collision centrality . that this was indeed achieved was announced in ref .",
    "@xcite and will be documented in this companion article .",
    "we then proceed to demonstrate that , with the qgp shear viscosity extracted in @xcite , vishnu  provides a good description of all single - particle aspects of soft hadron production in 200@xmath0gev au+au collisions for which accurate measurements exist , over the entire range of collision centralities .",
    "the various components of the viscous hydrodynamics+boltzmann hybrid code vishnu  have been described in ref .",
    "@xcite ( see also @xcite ) to which we refer the reader interested in technical details . for the qgp fluid we approximate @xmath1 in the temperature range @xmath7 by a constant @xcite .",
    "we switch from a hydrodynamic description of the qgp to the microscopic hadronic rescattering code urqmd at temperature @xmath8mev , adjusted to reproduce the chemical freeze - out temperature measured in rhic collisions @xcite ; as shown in @xcite , this is at the same time the _ highest _",
    "@xmath9 for which we have a valid microscopic description and the _ lowest _ @xmath9 for which the macroscopic hydrodynamic approach can be trusted .    as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , the qgp shear viscosity @xmath5 extracted from the experimentally measured elliptic flow depends on the initial fireball eccentricity @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 label the coordinates along the short and long major axes of the fireball in the plane transverse to the beam direction .",
    "( this definition of @xmath11 , together with the beam direction @xmath13 , define the `` participant plane '' , reflected in the subscript . ) with presently available tools this initial eccentricity can not be directly measured , and theoretically we have limited control over it .",
    "we here use initial entropy density profiles from two popular geometric models for the initial particle production in high - energy heavy - ion collisions , the monte carlo glauber model ( mc - glauber @xcite ) , in a version @xcite that uses finite size nucleons , and the monte carlo fkln ( mc - kln ) model @xcite .",
    "these models give initial eccentricities that differ ( depending on centrality ) by up to 25% which we hope to cover the physically reasonable range of uncertainty .",
    "we showed in @xcite that this uncertainty in the initial eccentricity completely dominates the present error range in the phenomenological extraction of @xmath5 , and that future improvements in the accuracy of the experimentally extracted value of @xmath5 can not be achieved without obtaining better ( experimental and/or theoretical ) control over the initial fireball eccentricity .",

    ", we use a monte carlo sampling procedure to generate from the glauber and fkln models a large number of initial entropy density distributions whose shape and orientation fluctuate from event to event , recenter and rotate each distribution around the beam direction such that its short major axis @xmath11 aligns with the direction of the impact parameter @xmath17 , sort them into centrality bins by @xmath18 ( the number of wounded nucleons ) , and then superimpose the distributions to obtain a smooth average density that has the correct average eccentricity for collisions in this centrality class . strictly speaking ,",
    "this procedure yields @xmath19 where @xmath20 denotes the expectation value taken with the averaged entropy density obtained by superimposing many recentered and rotated monte carlo events ; this is not identical with , but numerically very close to the ensemble - averaged participant eccentricity @xmath21 where for each event @xmath22 is computed as the analogous expectation value taken with the entropy density of that event . ]",
    "the elliptic flow resulting from the vishnu  evolution of this initial profile is interpreted as the event - average @xmath23 for the selected centrality class .",
    "the ensemble - averaged initial entropy density is normalized such that , after evolution with vishnu , it reproduces the measured final charged hadron rapidity density @xmath24 in the most central collisions @xcite ; due to viscous entropy production this is an iterative process , requiring two or three iterations .",
    "after normalization in central collisions , the centrality dependence of the initial entropy production is taken directly from the model ( mc - glauber or mc - kln ) ; for the mc - glauber model we follow @xcite and assume a two - component ( soft+hard ) model with a small hard fraction ( @xmath25 @xcite ) for the entropy production . in @xcite",
    "this fraction was fixed within a hydro+boltzmann hybrid approach using ideal fluid dynamics for the qgp ; taking the same fraction in our viscous hydro+boltzmann code ignores the centrality dependence of viscous heating .",
    "we have checked that its effects on the centrality dependence of the final @xmath24 are negligible relative to experimental uncertainties .",
    "let us now begin discussing our results .",
    "all experimental data and theoretical calculations are for 200@xmath0gev au+au collisions .",
    "figure  [ f1 ] shows pion and proton transverse momentum spectra from the star @xcite and phenix @xcite collaborations for the whole range of collision centralities , separated by multiplicative factors of 10 for clarity .",
    "the lines show vishnu  calculations for different values of @xmath5 in the qgp phase , using either mc - kln ( solid ) or mc - glauber ( dashed ) initial conditions . when changing @xmath5 we have to ( i ) renormalize the initial entropy density profiles by a ( @xmath27-independent ) constant factor to account for the change in viscous entropy production , and ( ii ) adjust @xmath28 to account for the additional radial acceleration caused by the transverse shear pressure gradients .",
    "the latter increase with @xmath5 , leading to more radial flow and flatter @xmath2-spectra unless we compensate by increasing the starting time for the hydrodynamic evolution accordingly .",
    "the curves shown in fig .  [ f1 ] correspond to the following parameter pairs @xmath29 : ( 0,0.4fm ) , ( 0.08,0.6fm ) , ( 0.16,0.9fm ) , and ( 0.24,1.2fm ) .",
    "we stop at @xmath30 since we will see that larger qgp shear viscosities are excluded by the elliptic flow data .    except for very peripheral collisions , the different lines in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] overlap almost perfectly and thus are hard to distinguish optically .",
    "this is intentional since it shows the approximate equivalence of the different parameter pairs as far as the quality of the theoretical description of the measured @xmath2-spectra goes .",
    "differences between theory and data are generally less than between data sets from the different experiments .",
    "we note that the theoretical proton spectra are uniformly about 50% larger than the phenix data but agree nicely with their slope ; their normalization agrees somewhat better with the star data . due to limited event statistics ,",
    "vishnu  does not include protons from weak decays ; in fig .",
    "[ f1]b we therefore compare with experimental data that have been corrected to eliminate feeddown protons . however , the feeddown correction methods used by phenix and star differ @xcite , and systematic uncertainties arising from the feeddown correction are large . keeping the differences between the experimental data sets in mind ,",
    "vishnu  provides a very acceptable compromise description .",
    "we do note in passing that in the most peripheral bins a viscous treatment of the qgp appears to work better than treating it as an ideal fluid ; assuming zero viscosity for the qgp gives too little radial flow and results in @xmath2 spectra for both pions and protons that are slightly too steep .",
    "figure  [ f2 ] shows the differential elliptic flow @xmath4 for charged hadrons from au+au collisions at different centralities .",
    "experimental data from the star collaboration obtained with the event - plane method @xcite are compared with vishnu   calculations for different qgp shear viscosities .",
    "@xmath31 receives positive contributions from event - by - event flow fluctuations and non - flow effects @xcite .",
    "the latter can be minimized by trying to decorrelate the determination of the event plane from the measurement of @xmath32 , e.g. by employing a large rapidity gap between these measurements .",
    "fluctuation effects can not be eliminated from the measurement , but both non - flow and fluctuations can be corrected for @xcite . in @xcite",
    "we used such corrected data to extract @xmath5 ; in figure  [ f2 ] we show the uncorrected @xmath31 data directly as measured . to account for the fluctuation contribution we normalize them by @xmath33 @xcite where the exponent @xmath34 depends on the experimental event - plane resolution @xmath16 and on details of the @xmath32 extraction method @xcite . in table",

    "[ f3 ] the same comparison with phenix data for @xmath31 @xcite where the event plane was determined with counters several units of rapidity away from the central region where @xmath32 was measured .",

    "@xmath5 values for central collisions than in the other centrality bins .",
    "figure  [ f4 ] shows that this results from    a disagreement between the two data sets in near - central collisions : while the two data sets overlap excellently for centralities @xmath47 , they increasingly diverge at small centralities , with a 30% difference between star an phenix in the @xmath48 centrality bin .",
    "it has been pointed out that the excess of the star over the phenix data is uniform in @xmath2 and could be explained by a 2% shift in the centrality definitions between the experiments @xcite .",

    "figure  [ f5 ] demonstrates that the agreement of vishnu  using the phenomenologically extracted @xmath5 values from ref .",
    "@xcite with the measured differential elliptic flow carries over from all charged hadrons to identified pions and protons .",
    "data for protons that have sufficient statistical precision to discriminate between different @xmath5 values exist only for the mid - centrality range @xmath49 . in very peripheral collisions ( @xmath50 centrality )",

    "the pion elliptic flow data in the left column reveal that for both mc - glauber and mc - kln initial conditions this agreement breaks down if @xmath5 is increased by @xmath41 above the preferred value . for protons",
    "the calculation of @xmath4 is numerically costly ( the elliptic flow signal and the number of protons per event are both small ) , and we have therefore not done any calculations for other than the preferred @xmath5 values",
    ". however , the proton data for these bins are precise enough that they would again reject @xmath5 values that differed by more than @xmath51 from the values shown .",
    "the comparisons between theory and data discussed above prove that we can extract the qgp shear viscosity from the centrality dependence of the _ @xmath2-integrated @xmath32 _ for charged hadrons and then use this value to obtain a very good overall description of the _ @xmath2-differential @xmath32_. this works not only for the sum of all charged hadrons , but also for individual identified hadronic species , and it carries over from @xmath32 to their @xmath2-spectra which are nicely described over the entire range of collision centralities , except perhaps the most peripheral collisions .",
    "we do not recommend to try to extract @xmath5 directly from the @xmath2-differential elliptic flow , for the following reasons .",
    "the main effect of shear viscosity that we exploit when extracting it from experiment is that it inhibits the hydrodynamic conversion of spatially anisotropic pressure gradients within the collision fireball into momentum anisotropies . as emphasized by ollitrault @xcite , heinz @xcite , and recently by teaney @xcite , the @xmath2-integrated elliptic flow - weighted elliptic flow @xmath52 , rather than @xmath53 .",
    "] of the sum of all hadrons is the observable that has the most direct relationship with the hydrodynamically generated total momentum anisotropy .",
    "hence it is _ the total charged hadron @xmath32 _ that is controlled by @xmath1 . how the hydrodynamically generated total momentum anisotropy is distributed among the different hadron species and in @xmath2",
    "depends on the chemical composition and @xmath2 distributions of the hadrons @xcite .",
    "the correct theoretical description of the differential elliptic flow @xmath4 of individual identified hadron species thus depends on the accurate reproduction of their yields and @xmath2 spectra which show much stronger sensitivities to details of the hydrodynamic simulation ( such as initial conditions and shape of the initial density profiles ) than the total momentum anisotropy itself .",
    "for example , in a purely hydrodynamic approach with cooper - frye freeze - out , even at extremely high collision energies where the total momentum anisotropy has time to fully saturate before freeze - out , lower freeze - out temperatures will lead to more radial flow ; this affects the slope of the single - particle spectra , causing a concomitant change in the slope of @xmath4 which is solely controlled by the fact that , after integration over @xmath2 , the same total charged hadron elliptic flow must be reproduced as for a higher freeze - out temperature . in a hybrid approach such as ours ,",
    "the cooper - frye procedure used to convert the hydrodynamic output into particle distributions involves a so - called `` @xmath54 correction '' @xcite describing the deviation from local equilibrium on the conversion hypersurface ; its form is presently not precisely known @xcite . for a given total charged hadron @xmath32 , different parametrizations for @xmath54 lead to different shapes of identified hadron spectra and @xmath4 .",
    "bulk viscosity has very little effect on the total momentum anisotropy ( and thus on the total charged hadron @xmath32 ) but affects the radial flow and hence the slopes of @xmath2 spectra and @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "these interdependencies between the hadron @xmath2-spectra and their @xmath2-dependent elliptic flow make it hazardous to extract @xmath5 from @xmath4 .",
    "with such an approach it is rather difficult to arrive at a uniformly good description of all soft hadron characteristics , and one easily ends up with different @xmath5 values extracted from the elliptic flow of different hadron species or from collisions at different centralities .",
    "when using the @xmath2-integrated charged particle elliptic flow to extract @xmath5 one must , however , pay attention to the fact that the measured elliptic flow fluctuates from event to event and may be contaminated by non - flow contributions .",
    "this was emphasized in ref .",
    "@xcite where we therefore used elliptic flow data that had been corrected for non - flow effects and event - by - event fluctuations . in the remainder of this article we elaborate on how the @xmath2-integrated charged hadron elliptic flow @xmath23 from the dynamical model vishnu , calculated with the @xmath5 values extracted in @xcite , compares directly with various experimental measurements that have not been corrected for fluctuation and non - flow effects .",
    "the trends exposed in this comparison provide useful insights .    without the ability of doing event - by - event hydrodynamic simulations @xcite",
    ", we can at this moment account for event - by - event fluctuations of the initial fireball density distribution only on average , in one of two ways : either we recenter and rotate each monte carlo event , in order to align their major and minor axes , before averaging the density distributions ( this produces an average density profile @xmath55 in the `` participant plane '' , characterized by its average eccentricity @xmath56 ( see footnote [ fn1 ] ) ) , or we superimpose the densities without recentering and rotating ( producing a smooth average density profile @xmath57 in the `` reaction plane '' , with `` standard '' eccentricity @xmath58 where ( in contrast to footnote [ fn1 ] ) the expectation values in numerator and denominator are taken with @xmath57 ) . both of these methods incorporate ( in different ways ) the effect of event - by - event fluctuations of the shape and orientation of the collision fireball on the average initial eccentricity , but do not dynamically propagate event - by - event fluctuations of the value of this eccentricity . as a result ,",
    "the hydrodynamic evolution produces a non - fluctuating elliptic flow , and while the urqmd  afterburner produces event - by - event @xmath32 fluctuations , they are only due to finite number statistics and not related to event - by - event fluctuations of the initial eccentricity @xmath59 .",
    "various experimental techniques measure different varieties of @xmath32 which are affected in different ways by event - by - event flow fluctuations ( driven by event - by - event variations of the initial eccentricity ) and non - flow effects .",
    "hydrodynamic simulations with smooth ( non - fluctuating ) initial conditions indicate a linear relationship @xmath60 for not too large eccentricity @xcite . on @xmath59 for small @xmath32 . ] if @xmath60 , the probability distribution of the final @xmath32 is directly related to that of the initial @xmath59 .",
    "for example , a measurement of @xmath61 would yield values that are proportional to @xmath62 , with the same proportionality constant as between @xmath23 and @xmath63 @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , quantities like @xmath64 and @xmath65^{1/4}$ ] that control the fluctuation contributions to @xmath66 and @xmath67 @xcite , have a different centrality dependence than the average eccentricities @xmath14 and @xmath68 that characterize our hydrodynamic initial conditions .",
    "for this reason it has been suggested in @xcite to make comparisons between theory and experiment only with appropriately normalized elliptic flows . in the absence of non - flow contributions and for a linear mapping between @xmath59 and @xmath32 in each event",
    ", one has @xmath69 where the first ratio can be calculated in a single - shot hydrodynamic evolution of an average initial profile whereas the other two ratios can be measured if the initial eccentricity and its fluctuations are known from a model .    for gaussian fluctuations , @xmath70 $ ] ,",

    "( in fact , we can write in general @xmath73^{1/4}$ ] in terms of the difference between two positive definite quantities which , for non - gaussian distributions , can become negative , in which case @xmath74 is not defined . )",
    "it has been observed in @xcite that , for models where @xmath22 shows bessel - gaussian fluctuations @xcite , @xmath74 agrees exactly with the reaction plane eccentricity @xmath75 , and in @xcite that @xmath67 is insensitive to two - particle non - flow contributions . for these reasons ,",
    "the authors of @xcite used hybrid model simulations with reaction - plane averaged initial conditions for direct comparison with rhic au+au and recent lhc pb+pb data @xcite .",
    "the validity of the assumption of ( bessel)-gaussian eccentricity and flow fluctuations has been challenged in @xcite but was recently validaded for the mc - glauber and mc - kln models for au+au collisions at centralities of up to about 40% @xcite ; for more peripheral collisions , the assumption breaks down .",
    "we here compare results obtained from both participant - plane and reaction - plane averaged initial conditions with @xmath2-integrated @xmath67 data .    in fig .",
    "[ f6 ] we compare vishnu  results with star and phenix data for the integrated charged hadron elliptic flow as function of collision centrality . the star and phenix data are integrated over slightly different @xmath2 ranges ; correcting the phenix data for the somewhat smaller lower @xmath2 cutoff used by star and in the calculations would move them slightly down . in the absence of non - flow contributions and the limit of small fluctuations , @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "non - flow effects would push @xmath31 further up but leave @xmath67 unchanged .",
    "calculations with reaction - plane averaged initial conditions of eccentricity @xmath14 ( fig .",
    "[ f6]a ) should thus fall between @xmath31 and @xmath67 , perhaps a bit closer to @xmath67 if the @xmath31 data are affected by non - flow .",
    "the star @xmath31 data lie above those of phenix , consistent with the expectation that the phenix data should have less non - flow contributions ( if any at all ) , but some of the difference between the data set ( especially at small centralities ) may also originate from a shift in the centrality definition @xcite . except for the most peripheral centralities ,",
    "our calculations lie above the phenix and roughly on the star @xmath31 data and overpredict the star @xmath67 data .",
    "this indicates that the chosen @xmath5 values ( 0.08 for mc - glauber and 0.16 for mc - kln initial conditions ) are slightly too small ( but not by much , as seen by the fact that increasing @xmath5 by 0.08 leads to a strong underprediction of all data sets ) , and that the slightly larger values of 0.10 for mc - glauber and 0.20 for mc - kln extracted in @xcite from fluctuation - corrected @xmath32 data would give better agreement here , too .",
    "[ f6]b shows that with reaction - plane averaged initial conditions the vishnuresults agree very well with the @xmath67 data , supporting the argument @xcite that @xmath78 provides a good substitute for @xmath74 .",
    "again , using the slightly larger @xmath5 values from @xcite would further improve the agreement .",
    "we note the inability of vishnu  to describe the elliptic flow in the most peripheral collisions where the experimentally measured values remain large whereas the theoretical predictions decrease rapidly with increasing impact parameter .",
    "this drop is related to the decreasing lifetime of the fireball ( which is even shorter for runs with mc - kln initial conditions than for glauber profiles , due to the sharper edges of the mc - kln profiles which lead to faster radial acceleration ) .",
    "shorter lifetimes leave less time for generating elliptic flow in the fluid dynamic qgp stage , and the highly dissipative hadronic stage can not compensate for this .",
    "calculations with an ideal hydro+cascade model that use a different hadronic rescattering algorithm ( jam instead of urqmd ) appear to share this feature @xcite .",
    "the fact that the @xmath67 data do not show this decrease indicates that non - flow contributions ( which are not included in the model ) are not to blame .",
    "we do not know how to obtain larger @xmath32 values from the model at large impact parameters .",
    "we have utilized the recently developed hybrid code vishnu , which couples a relativistic viscous fluid dynamical description of the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) with a microscopic boltzmann cascade for the late hadronic rescattering stage , to calculate charged and identified hadron spectra and elliptic flow measured in 200@xmath0gev au+au collisions at the relativistic heavy - ion collider ( rhic ) .",
    "we find that , after suitable readjustments of initial conditions , the @xmath2 spectra of identified hadrons ( pions and protons ) are rather insensitive to the choice of the value of the specific shear viscosity @xmath1 , whereas the eccentricity - scaled elliptic flow @xmath6 shows strong sensitivity to @xmath1 . using initial conditions that incorporate event - by - event fluctuations in the initial shape and orientation of the collision fireball and values @xmath5 for the specific shear viscosity of the quark - gluon plasma that were recently extracted from the measured centrality dependence of the eccentricity - scaled ,",

    "we add a few aspects that , due to space limitations , were left out from the discussion in ref .",
    "@xcite of the almost universal dependence of the eccentricity - scaled elliptic flow @xmath6 on the charged hadron multiplicity density @xmath81 on which our extraction of the qgp shear viscosity @xmath5 from rhic data was based .",
    "specifically , we show that the universality of this dependence ( i.e. the feature that it only depends on @xmath5 but not on any details of the initial conditions for the hydrodynamic evolution which affect the initial eccentricity @xmath59 and transverse area @xmath82 of the expanding fireball ) holds not only for the participant - plane averaged fluctuating initial profiles used in @xcite but also for the reaction - plane averaged profiles used here in fig .",
    "furthermore , it is insensitive to the smearing area @xmath83 used in the mc - glauber model of ref .  @xcite that describes the width of the transverse distribution of matter created in each nucleon - nucleon collision . however , the source eccentriciy @xmath59 itself depends on this smearing area , and hence the @xmath5 value extracted by comparing the universal theoretical @xmath6 vs. @xmath81 curves for different @xmath1 with a given set of experimental @xmath32 vs. @xmath24 data also depends on this parameter .",
    "in the traditional mc - glauber model , one samples the positions of nucleons according to the nuclear density distributions of the two colliding nuclei and calculates the participant eccentricity from the transverse positions of the wounded nucleons and/or binary collision points , described by @xmath84-functions in the transverse plane .",
    "hirano and nara @xcite pointed out that , since the measured nuclear density distribution represents a folding of the distribution of nucleon centers with the finite size of each nucleon , the nuclear distribution used for sampling the positions of the nucleon centers must be described by different woods - saxon parameters than the measured nuclear density .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite , we therefore use for the distribution of nucleon centers in a au nucleus a woods - saxon distribution with radius @xmath85fm and surface thickness @xmath86fm ( instead of the frequently used parameters @xmath87fm and @xmath88fm that describe the measured nuclear density distribution of au ) .",
    "we then distribute the entropy of particles emitted by a wounded nucleon or created in a binary nucleon - nucleon collision homogeneously in a cylinder of radius @xmath89 ( where @xmath83 is the so - called `` transverse smearing area '' ) , centered at the position of the wounded nucleon or the collision point and aligned with the beam direction .",
    "( the same procedure was used in ref .",
    "@xcite without , however , first correcting the woods - saxon parameters of the distribution of nucleon centers for the finite nucleon size . )    the value of the smearing area @xmath83 is not known _ a priori _ since it depends on unknown aspects of pre - thermal decoherence and entropy production processes .",
    "theoretically , it is limited from below by the uncertainty principle which does not permit localization of the production points of secondary particles with average transverse momentum @xmath90 to an average distance @xmath91 from the classical collision point .",
    "we explore the choices @xmath92 mb @xcite and 4.2 mb .",
    "the smaller value is an approximation to pointlike secondary particle production ( our code for calculating the participant - plane averaged initial density requires a non - vanishing @xmath83 ) ; theoretically , it is disfavored by the above uncertainty argument .",
    "figure  [ f7 ] shows the eccentricity ( panel ( a ) ) and transverse area ( panel ( b ) ) of the participant - plane averaged initial entropy density distribution as a function of the number @xmath18 of participant ( `` wounded '' ) nucleons in au+au collisions , for two values of the smearing area @xmath83 .",
    "we see that a smaller smearing area ( more pointlike particle production ) leads to larger initial fireball eccentricities @xmath22 and smaller transverse areas @xmath82 .",
    "while the effect of varying @xmath83 on @xmath82 is simply an offset , for @xmath22 it leads to a change in the slope of its centrality dependence : changing @xmath83 affects @xmath22 more strongly in peripheral collisions ( where the nuclear overlap region is small and strongly deformed ) than in central ones @xcite .",
    "figure  [ f8 ] illustrates that changing the smearing area in the mc - glauber model has no effect on the centrality depenence of the produced charged hadron multiplicity ( panel ( a ) ) nor on the universality of @xmath6 vs. @xmath81 ( panel ( b ) ) . in fig .",
    "[ f8]b one sees ( see solid brown line without symbols for @xmath39 ) that , for smaller @xmath93 mb , the reduced fireball area shown in fig .",
    "[ f7]b shifts the entire curve towards the right .",
    "the shift is , however , not horizontal but rather diagonal such that , where they overlap , the shifted curve lies on top of the line for the larger value @xmath92 mb .",
    "the upward component of the shift of the @xmath93 mb line arises from an increased qgp lifetime , due to the larger initial entropy density resulting from the smaller initial area @xmath82 ; a longer qgp lifetime in turn results in a larger momentum anisotropy at the beginning of the hadronic stage , since at rhic energies the qgp never lives long enough for the fireball eccentricity to completely decay before hadronization .",
    "larger momentum anisotropy at the beginning of the hadronic rescattering stage leads to more elliptic flow for the finally emitted hadrons .    in figure  [ f8 ]",
    "we also show curves obtained from vishnu  using reaction - plane averaged ( rp ) initial profiles instead of participant - plane averaged ( pp ) ones .",
    "one sees that the centrality - dependence of the final charged multiplicity per participant ( panel ( a ) ) and the dependence of @xmath6 on the multiplicity density @xmath81 are insensitive to how we average the fluctuating initial profiles from the mc - kln and mc - glauber models when constructing the smooth initial entropy density profile for the hydrodynamic evolution .",
    "due to numerical cost we here show only curves for shear viscosity @xmath40 for both mc - glauber and mc - kln models .",
    "we have made spot checks to convince ourselves that the scaling shown in figure  [ f8 ] also works for other choices of @xmath5 .",
    "figure  [ f9 ] is a modified version of fig .",
    "2b in @xcite which was used to extract the preferred value of @xmath5 from experimental data by comparing them with vishnu  calculations using participant - plane averaged initial conditions from the mc - glauber model .",
    "we remind the reader that , even though theoretically the dependence of @xmath6 on @xmath81 is universal ( at least at a fixed collision energy @xcite ) and depends only on a single parameter , @xmath5 , but not on the initial profile , we do not know the correct initial profile that drives the generation of elliptic flow in the actual experiments .",
    "since different initial conditions have different eccentricities , the same set of experimental @xmath32 and @xmath24 data yields different @xmath6 and @xmath81 when normalized by @xmath59 and @xmath82 from different initial state models , resulting in different extracted values for @xmath5 from a comparison with the universal theory curves .",
    "the larger eccentricities and smaller overlap areas resulting from a mc - glauber initialization with reduced smearing area @xmath93 mb lead to smaller @xmath6 and larger @xmath81 values ( green circled data in fig .  [ f9 ] ) than for the mc - glauber model with standard smearing ( @xmath92 mb , black squares ) .",
    "this results in a larger preferred value @xmath5 ( closer to 0.16 than the value of 0.08 we obtained when postulating mc - glauber initial conditions with standard smearing ) .",
    "furthermore , normalization of the experimental data with mc - glauber ( @xmath94 ) values for reduced smearing changes the slope of the dependence of @xmath6 on @xmath81 , and it no longer agrees with the slope of the universal theoretical curves . we conclude that the comparison of experimental data with vishnu  results disfavors the hypothesis that the experimentally measured elliptic flow is generated by initial conditions that can be described by a mc - glauber model with almost pointlike secondary particle production .",
    "this conclusion aligns nicely with the theoretical prejudice against such a model on the basis that it would violate the uncertainty principle , as discussed above .",
