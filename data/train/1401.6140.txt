    "moreover , for @xmath448 , @xmath449    in order to verify ( v ) , we remark that @xmath450 this inequality , combined with fubini s theorem , leads to the result .",
    "indeed , @xmath451    it remains to compute the objective value or @xmath452 ; for this , we apply fubini s theorem once more : @xmath453    [ rem - sphere ] taking @xmath454 , and @xmath455 , defines a graph @xmath456 homogeneous under the action of the orthogonal group that fits into our setting .",
    "moreover , up to a suitable rescaling , this graph is an induced subgraph of the unit distance graph .",
    "so , theorem [ theorem 5 ] can be applied to compute tight bounds for @xmath457 , which in turn may be used in theorem [ theorem - general ] , suggesting an inductive method to calculate better upper bounds for @xmath12 .    in the remaining of this section",
