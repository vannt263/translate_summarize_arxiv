    "electrons in a two - dimensional layer continue to be of interest in physics since they exhibit nonclassical behavior and are readily realizable in semiconductor heterostructures @xcite . nowadays",
    "research investigations on two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) systems are aimed at understanding the plateaus in the quantum hall conductance @xcite and the de haas - van alphen effect or the magnetization oscillations @xcite .",
    "the smooth drop of the plateaus and the extrema of the oscillations reveal broadened energy levels , that is , a finite density of states ( dos ) @xcite between eigenvalues @xmath0 .",
    "these @xmath0 , known as landau levels , are the quantized energy spectrum ( @xmath1 ) obtained when a strong magnetic field ( @xmath2 ) is applied perpendicular to the system s plane @xcite or in a tilted direction relative to it @xcite .",
    "the striking behavior of @xmath0 broadening , from which other exotic features arise , has been attributed to disorder due to the presence of impurities , defects and other inhomogeneities in the system @xcite .",
    "ideally , the dos of a noninteracting 2deg in a perpendicular @xmath2 is given as a series of delta functions @xcite , that is , @xmath3 here @xmath4 is the electron charge , @xmath5 is planck s constant and @xmath6 is the @xmath7th landau energy level .",
    "the latter depends on @xmath2 through the cyclotron frequency @xmath8 for a given effective mass @xmath9 .",
    "such a dos structure can be used to model actual materials with a very narrow distribution of energy carriers @xcite .",
    "usually , the actual shape of the density of states of a 2deg is determined by making theoretical fits to the heat capacity data from experimental measurements .",
    "this procedure made on a 2deg in gaas - gaalas multilayers",
    "@xcite , for instance , yields a dos with gaussian peaks on a flat background .",
    "many experimental and theoretical studies on the thermodynamic and magnetic properties of 2deg systems , therefore , use a form of dos based on a gaussian function @xcite such as @xmath10\\ ; , \\label{eq : gaussian}\\ ] ] where the broadening is taken into account by the parameter @xmath11 .    in one study using this dos , the authors of ref .",

    ", the authors will show that a closed form expression of @xmath17 is obtained for a 2deg system when the chemical potential @xmath23 does not vary with @xmath14 .",
    "the latter condition is satisfied at a finite non - zero @xmath14 when the last occupied landau level is half - filled , that is , the last occupied energy level is filled to half its degeneracy .",
    "particular interest has been devoted to @xmath24 and other half - filled states since no plateau of the hall resistance is observed unlike other fractional @xmath18 with an odd denominator @xcite . at half - filling ,",
    "the chemical potential is right at the center of the landau level where extended states are located @xcite .",
    "there is an absence of a gap at this @xmath18 and some experiments have observed features of a fermi - liquid state @xcite .    here a detailed derivation will be presented of @xmath17 at @xmath25 ( where @xmath26 is an odd integer ) for a spinless 2deg having a delta - shaped or a gaussian dos in the presence of a perpendicular applied magnetic field .",
    "the exact relations for the specific heat as obtained for the first time in this work serve as a basis that characterizes the underlying density of states of an electron gas .",
    "in addition , the condition at which the heat capacity is a maximum is established for both cases including the actual nature of its dependence on @xmath11 .",
    "this will be particularly useful for the design of devices that are intended to resist changes in temperature .",

    "this signifies that the @xmath23 behavior and , consequently , the specific heat nature of 2deg systems at the non - half - filled states can be considered as deviations from their behavior at half - filling .",
    "in fact , the @xmath23 saturates to its half - filling value as @xmath14 increases . treating the @xmath23 as @xmath14-independent is a valid approximation even for non - half - fillings albeit limited only at high @xmath14 .",
