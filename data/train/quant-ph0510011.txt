    "the internet is currently the main communication vehicle for citizens in general , banks and e - commerce .",
    "protocols based on mathematical complexities strive to offer a secure internet while hackers attempt to break in for profits . as a matter of fact ,",
    "the existing internet offers only tenuous security .",
    "while a few security providers offer reasonable service within the current technological landscape , they are vulnerable to technological advances .",
    "a search for new paradigms to establish a secure internet but not sensitive to technological or mathematical advances is ongoing .",
    "this paper describes how to implement a practical secure communication system for the internet while avoiding altogether protocols based purely on mathematical complexities .",
    "this noise - encryption system relies on laws of nature but also avoids single - photon state protocols such as bb84 @xcite .",
    "single - photon protocols can not be amplified and therefore do not work for the long - haul communications necessary for the internet .",
    "furthermore , signals from single - photon protocols can not be converted from optical to electrical and back to optical without loss of security . nor they are practical for wavelength multiplexing ( wdm ) .",
    "these steps are necessary to the internet .",
    "alternative systems such as those using discrete or continuous variable processes and relying on homodyne measurements ( e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) are very sensitive to noise , which leads to low key rate transfer , and can not work in the naturally disturbed and complex internet networks .    in the proposed implementation of a secure internet deterministic ciphered signals",
    "go through arbitrary communication channels .",
    "they are ciphered by random signals from physical sources in nonorthogonal @xmath2-ry bases .",
    "this system has evolved from a key distribution system recently proposed @xcite(see also @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "this secure internet distributes deterministically random sequences of bits to be utilized in a fast `` one - time - pad '' scheme .",
    "a simplified but imperfect illustration of this system based on physical noise would be a public radio station emitter a that changes its carrier frequency in a very fast and truly random way .",
    "a user b who possesses a perfect knowledge of this random variation could set his tuner to automatically lock onto it .",
    "a clear sound or message would result . to an intruder who does not possess any information on the carrier variations , only noise will be detected .",
    "actually , the presented cryptographic system does not rely on frequency variations but on random jumps among distinct nonorthogonal phase bases where the bits are inscribed .",
    "this is as far as this analogy goes .",
    "the security of the key distribution provided by this system relies on a few points : 1 ) a shared secrecy by a and b on a starting key sequence @xmath0 and 2 ) a bit - by - bit uncertainty nature - made noise @xmath3 associated to each bit @xmath4 and recorded on a interleaved @xmath2-ry nonorthogonal basis .",
    "knowledge of @xmath0 gives for the legitimate users the mapping of the bases jumps in the emitter and thus the bit @xmath4 inscribed on each basis .",
    "privacy amplification procedures statistically exclude the eventually compromised fraction of shared bits .",
    "the sequences of random bits @xmath4 will be generated by a truly random process and sent one - by - one between users a ( alice ) and b ( bob ) . the batch of shared secret bits @xmath4 will be used subsequently in one - time - pad ciphering .",
    "the noise @xmath3 protects each bit @xmath4 from the attacker e ( eve ) and provides the information security level associated with all shared @xmath4 .",
    "while this noise - secured internet is logically equivalent to the optical system discussed on refs . @xcite and @xcite it has a major distinctive feature : in ref .",
    "@xcite the noise arises as part of the signal measurement by the attacker and is inherent to the optical field in a fiber channel . here",
    "the signal sent over the network is a recorded signal and , as such , it is deterministic but contains bit information @xmath4 and the associated noise @xmath3 .",
    "this is equivalent to recording the results of an exceedingly noisy experiment and giving them to two researchers for interpretation : one that knows how to subtract the noise and the other one , the attacker , that can not get rid of the inherent noise .",
    "the signals are created by a physical random generator ( phrg ) .",
    "the noise @xmath3 associated with the bit @xmath4 inscribed onto the @xmath2-ry nonorthogonal basis ( @xmath5 ) produces the uncertainty measured by the attacker .",
    "this implies that the the emitter has to be equipped to detect and record the signals generated by the phrg . in other words ,",
    "the definition of the measuring system is made by the emitter , not the attacker .",
    "the signal sent is the signal controlled and measured by the emitter with a detection system of his choice .",
    "no restrictions are placed on the attacker to obtain the exchanged signals on a public channel .",
    "she may obtain perfect copies of the transmission .",
    "the signals emitted by the legitimate user obey constraints imposed to provide full security . among the advantages of the proposed system",
    "are : 1 ) any public channel may be used for transmission ( optical fibers , tv , microwave , and so on ) ; 2 ) the deterministic signals can be amplified with no security loss ; 3 ) signals can be converted from electromagnetic to electrical and back to electromagnetic with no security loss ; 4 ) wavelength multiplexing is allowed on the network ; 5 ) current network and ip protocols can be used with no modifications for users in any ip classes .",
    "[ internetblock ] shows a block diagram for one cycle of the key distribution system .",
    "it describes how legitimate users a and b distribute or transfer fresh random key bits generated by a phrg ( to be described ahead ) .",
    "just to be more general , a description starting with a @xmath6ry system of levels will be presented . at the end",

    "these @xmath7 bits are divided into blocks of size @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) and each block defines randomly a basis @xmath10 over a nonorthogonal set of bases on a ciphering wheel ( # 3 ) with @xmath2 bases , where @xmath11 .",

    "the signal to be sent over the generic internet communication channel ( # 8 ) ( network and servers ) is @xmath21 .",

    "he subtracts this value from @xmath23 and obtains @xmath24 ( # 10 ) and obtain signals in _",
    "binary _ bases ( single @xmath25 value ) .",
    "the effect of the noise @xmath16 on bob s _ binary _ basis is negligible because @xmath18 and his decision on the bit value is easy ; therefore , he obtains @xmath15 ( # 6 ) . from the received sequence @xmath4 he forms bit blocks of length @xmath8 and constructs a new base sequence @xmath26 .",
    "the next steps are similar to the first ones .",

    "the signal @xmath29 is sent over the communication channel ( # 8) .",
    "the bit value @xmath27 is hidden by the overall noise @xmath30 ( # 15 ) . from her knowledge of @xmath15 ( # 6 ) and ,",
    "therefore , @xmath26 ( # 14 ) , alice subtracts @xmath26 from @xmath31 and obtains @xmath32 ( # 16 ) . on her _ binary _ basis she easily obtains @xmath33 ( # 13 ) .",
    "the first cycle is complete .",
    "a and b continue to exchange random sequences as in the first cycle .",
    "the shared sequences ( @xmath34 ) , after a privacy amplification process , are the random bits to be subsequently utilized for one - time - pad cipher .",

    "this frustrates several correlation attacks .",
    "security analyses were presented for the purely optical counterparts of this @xmath2-ry key distribution system for internet and are equally valid here .",
    "@xcite presented a bit - by - bit analysis and @xcite showed that the attacker s initial uncertainty on the whole sequence of shared bits is equal to her uncertainty of the starting shared sequence @xmath0 .",
    "this dependence on the first key shared key sequence @xmath0 can be seen from the mutual information , defined by @xmath42 @xmath43 is used to write the difference between the mutual information between b and e in one cycle of length @xmath7 : @xmath44-\\left[h(r)-h(r|y_e(r))\\right]\\nonumber\\\\ & = & h(r|y_e(r))-h(r|y_b(r))\\:\\:.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] eve s uncertainty on @xmath1 given @xmath45 is maximal ( @xmath46 ) while bob may obtain the whole sequence @xmath1 from @xmath47 : @xmath48 .",

    "the noise level superposed to the bits sent are designed to hide each @xmath55 from the attacker .",

    "[ phrg ] shows basic parts to be considered . for secure transmission of signals",
    "the physical randomness is necessary as no known mathematical algorithm has been proven to generate true random numbers .",
    "several physical sources may be used alternatively such as optical or thermal sources . however",
    ", optical sources can be much faster than the thermal ones and are therefore necessary when speed is required .",
    "a phrg can be seen as modulus that can be hooked ( internally or externally ) to a computer linked to the internet either in dedicated use or open to users such as in a cybercafe . in such a public system users may generate and record on portable memories a batch of secure keys or use them to exchange one - time - pad ciphered information .",
    "one may also wonder about the cost of a brute force attack to determine the starting key @xmath0 from the transmitted signals . under the assumption that the uncertainty presented to the attacker",
    "covers @xmath20 bases , the attacker would know that the basis @xmath25 used in a given transmission is around a given region within the uncertainty @xmath20 . for a @xmath2-ry system of uniformly spaced bases",
