    "there are reasons not to do that at the present time .",
    "one of them is that many of the present lattice simulations use large pion masses where the decay channels would be blocked , but even there they can assess the existence of a bound state of @xmath80 nature .",
    "the second reason is that in present lattice simulations , even using unquenched calculations , levels tied to channels that couple to certain quantum numbers do not show up unless explicit interpolators for this particular channel are explicitly used as interpolators .",

    "the argument has stronger weight for the decay channels of resonances with a small width , like the present one with @xmath84 mev .",
    "obviously , there would be problems in the interpretation of the levels if these depend on the interpolators used , but the idea is to use interpolators with maximum overlap with the actual states , and there the effective field theories that we are using are of much help since they are telling the nature of the states under consideration .",
    "then we suggest using interpolators that accommodate this structure , and in the present case these would be @xmath80 interpolators .    it is true that the consideration of the decay channels of the particles involved in a problem leads to changes in the spectrum  @xcite and that to get the proper spectrum multihadron interpolators should be used  @xcite , but also , as mentioned in ref .",
    "@xcite , one can and must restrict oneself to lower energies if the interpolators accounting for the inelastic spectrum are not used . concerning the present case we can use the analogy of this work , where we have @xmath80 and the @xmath85 can decay to @xmath86 , and the case of ref .",

    "<S> lattice qcd simulations provide a promising way to disentangle different interpretations of hadronic resonances , which might be of particular relevance to understand the nature of the so - called @xmath0 particles . </S>",
    "<S> recent studies have shown that in addition to the well - established naive quark model picture , the axial - vector meson @xmath1 can also be understood as a dynamically generated state built upon the @xmath2 interaction . in this work , </S>",
    "<S> we calculate the energy levels of the @xmath2 system in the @xmath1 channel in finite volume using the chiral unitary approach . </S>",
    "<S> we propose to calculate the loop function in the dimensional regularization scheme , which is equivalent to the hybrid approach adopted in previous studies . </S>",
    "<S> we also study the inverse problem of extracting the bound state information from synthetic lattice qcd data and comment on the difference between our approach and the l \" uscher method . </S>"
