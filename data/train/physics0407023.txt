    "a molecule in a liquid undergoes random frequency fluctuations due to the stochastic forces imparted by the surrounding medium .",
    "the correlation between this frequency fluctuations results in vibrational dephasing .",
    "the problem has received wide attention both from theoretical and experimental point of view over the last couple of decades . several approaches to understand the basic nature of vibrational dephasing",
    "have been made .",
    "these include notably binary collision theory @xcite in which fluctuations are taken into account in terms of collisional events , hydrodynamic model @xcite relating random force and shear viscosity of the liquid , hamiltonian theory @xcite in terms of normal mode analysis and numerical simulations @xcite using various molecular potentials .",
    "a key element of these formulations is the realization that vibrational dephasing owes its origin to cubic anharmonicity of the vibrational potential . in the present paper",
    "we attempt to explore further this issue within a quantum mechanical content .",
    "a good number of approaches to vibrational dephasing make use of generalized langevin equation that governs the dynamics of the system by an infinite number of harmonic oscillators coupled linearly to the system .",
    "very recently based on a coherent state representation of noise operator and a positive definite wigner canonical thermal distribution @xcite of bath oscillators a c - number quantum langevin equation @xcite in the context of rate theory and stochastic processes has been proposed .",
    "an important offshoot of this formulation is that it takes care of quantum correction due to nonlinearity of the system potential order by order .",
    "it would thus seem that one should be able to analyze the vibrational dephasing rate quantum mechanically for arbitrary noise correlation and temperature and explore the role of this quantum correction to anharmonicity .",
    "this is the main purpose of this paper . in what follows",
    "we construct a c - number hamiltonian within a normal mode description and estimate the dephasing rate by calculating the effective correlation between the relevant c - number co - ordinates of anharmonic origin . since for a small diatomic molecule like @xmath0 , the fundamental vibrational frequency @xmath3 is so high ( @xmath4 ) that the ratio @xmath5 is as large as @xmath6 even at , say , @xmath7 , it is imperative that quantum nature of the oscillator molecule is significant in estimating the dephasing rate in the harmonic as well as in the anharmonic regime . with this end in view",
    "we examine the vibrational dephasing rate to estimate the anharmonic quantum correction to this rate and its variation with temperature away from critical or triple point for three widely studied diatomics @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 to allow ourselves a fair comparison with experiments @xcite .",
    "the outlay of the paper is as follows : in sec.ii we introduce the quantum langevin equation and its hamiltonian counterpart within a c - number normal mode description . since the cubic nonlinearity gives rise to a leading order contribution to dephasing rate we estimate the quantum vibrational dephasing rate for a cubic oscillator in sec.iii .",
    "the quantum corrections due to nonlinearity of the system potential is calculated explicitly in sec.iv .",
    "sec.v is devoted to the results obtained theoretically for three diatomics @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 which are compared with experiments .",
    "the paper is concluded in sec .",
    "we consider a particle of mass @xmath8 coupled to a medium comprised of a set of harmonic oscillators with frequency @xmath9 .",
    "this is described by the following hamiltonian @xcite :    @xmath10    here @xmath11 and @xmath12 are co - ordinate and momentum operators of the particle and the set @xmath13 is the set of co - ordinate and momentum operators for the reservoir oscillators of mass @xmath14 coupled linearly to the system through their coupling coefficients @xmath15 .",

    "the co - ordinate and momentum operators follow the usual commutation relations [ @xmath17 = @xmath18 and [ @xmath19 = @xmath20 .    eliminating the reservoir degrees of freedom in the usual way we obtain the operator langevin equation for the particle ,    @xmath21    where the noise operator @xmath22 and the memory kernel @xmath23 are given by    @xmath24\\ ] ]    and    @xmath25    the eq.([2 ] )",
    "is the well known exact quantized operator langevin equation for which the noise properties of @xmath22 can be derived by using a suitable initial canonical distribution of the bath co - ordinate and momentum operators at @xmath26 as follows ;    @xmath27    where @xmath28 refers to quantum statistical average on bath degrees of freedom and is defined as    @xmath29    for any operator @xmath30 where @xmath31 at @xmath26 . by trace",
    "we mean the usual quantum statistical average .",
    "eq.([6 ] ) is the fluctuation - dissipation relation with the noise operators ordered appropriately in the quantum mechanical sense .    to construct a c - number langevin equation @xcite",
    "we proceed from eq.([2 ] ) .",
    "we first carry out the _ quantum mechanical average _ of eq.([2 ] )    @xmath32    where the quantum mechanical average @xmath33 is taken over the initial product separable quantum states of the particle and the bath oscillators at @xmath26 , @xmath34 . here",

    "it is important to note that @xmath43 of eq.([8 ] ) is a classical - like noise term which , in general , is a non - zero number because of the quantum mechanical averaging and is given by @xmath44 ;    @xmath45\\ ] ]    it is convenient to rewrite the @xmath46-number equation ( [ 8 ] ) as follows ;    @xmath47    to realize @xmath48 as an effective c - number noise we now introduce the ansatz @xcite that the momenta @xmath49 and the shifted co - ordinates @xmath50 , @xmath51 of the bath oscillators are distributed according to a canonical distribution of gaussian form as    @xmath52 } { 2 \\hbar m_j \\omega_j \\left ( \\bar{n}_j(\\omega_j ) + \\frac{1}{2 } \\right ) } \\right \\}\\ ] ]    so that for any function of the quantum mechanical mean values of the bath operator @xmath53 the statistical average @xmath54 is    @xmath55    here @xmath56 indicates the average thermal photon number of the @xmath57-th oscillator at temperature @xmath58 and @xmath59 $ ] and @xmath60 is the normalization constant .",
    "the distribution ( [ 11 ] ) and the definition of statistical average ( [ 12 ] ) imply that @xmath48 must satisfy    @xmath61    and    @xmath62    that is , @xmath46-number noise @xmath48 is such that it is zero - centered and satisfies the standard fluctuation - dissipation relation ( fdr ) as expressed in eq.([6 ] ) .",
    "it is important to emphasize that the ansatz ( [ 11 ] ) is a canonical thermal wigner distribution @xcite for a shifted harmonic oscillator which remains always a positive definite function .",
    "a special advantage of using this distribution is that it remains valid as pure state non - singular distribution function at @xmath63 .",
    "furthermore , this procedure allows us to _ bypass the operator ordering _ prescription of eq.([6 ] ) for deriving the noise properties of the bath in terms of fluctuation - dissipation relation and to identify @xmath48 as a classical looking noise with quantum mechanical content .",
    "the procedure has been used by us in several recent contexts @xcite .",
    "we now return to eq.([10 ] ) to add the force term @xmath64 on both sides of eq.([10 ] ) and rearrange it to obtain    @xmath65    where we put @xmath66 and @xmath67 for notational convenience and    @xmath68    represents the quantum correction due to the system degrees of freedom . eq.([16 ] ) offers a simple interpretation .",
    "this implies that the quantum langevin equation is governed by a @xmath46-number quantum noise @xmath48 originating from the heat bath characterized by the properties ( [ 13 ] ) and ( [ 14 ] ) and a quantum fluctuation term @xmath69 characteristic of the non - linearity of the potential .",

    "this aspect of temperature independence of the width of the transition from the ground state had been noted earlier in ref.[5 ] .",
    "the origin of the temperature independence in @xmath175 and the nature of dephasing may be traced to the second term in eq.([45 ] ) which results from the third term of the normal mode hamiltonian eq.([39 ] ) .",

    "first , it is well known that classical dephasing rate ( _ i.e. _ @xmath176 in the classical limit ) is higher than the corresponding quantum rate @xmath176 .",
    "this is somewhat reminiscent of the quantum supression of classical values of rate co - efficient for the thermally activated processes for shallow cubic potentials @xcite .",
    "second , it is evident that just as in the classical theory , anharmonicity contributes significantly to the total quantum dephasing rate . in case of @xmath0",
    "it is as large as @xmath188 percent of total dephasing rate .",
    "the dephasing time thus calculated corresponds fairly to that obtained from experiments .",
    "third , the quantum effects due to heat bath appears quite significantly through the integrals in @xmath176 .",
    "this is because , the frequency dependence of the integrand is quite sharp at around @xmath3 as a result of the the frequency denominator @xmath189 and @xmath190 for these molecules .",
    "therefore the diatomic oscillator behaves more closely as a quantum oscillator rather than its classical counterpart .",
    "the temperature dependence of the dephasing rate according to eq.([65 ] ) has been compared for the set of parameter values mentioned in the table 1 to that obtained from experiments @xcite in fig.1 for the molecules @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "while the experimental results span a wide range of temperatures covering triple point and critical point , we confine ourselves in the region away from the points of phase transition , since the present theory is outside the scope of phase transition .",
    "we find a linear dependence of dephasing rate on temperature which is a fair agreement with experimental observations @xcite .",
    "based on a quantum langevin equation and the corresponding hamiltonian formulation within a c - number description , we have calculated quantum vibrational dephasing rate for a cubic oscillator system using first order perturbation technique and compared the results with experiments .",
    "it is shown that the vibrational dephasing rate comprises of two terms .",
    "the first term is the standard expression obtained earlier by several workers using independent approaches and is reduces to its classical limit as @xmath191 .",
    "this term is responsible for finite temperature dependence of the dephasing rate .",
    "the second term , an essential content and offshoot of the present theory , is a leading quantum correction due to nonlinearity of the system potential which contributes quite effectively to the total dephasing rate .",
