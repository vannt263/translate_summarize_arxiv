    "this gives us to two very nice m - morsifications with @xmath37 critical points and @xmath4 boundary points .",
    "hence , we associate to each of the components of the boundary caustics a couple of components of very nice m - morsifications with maximal or minimal critical values .    finally , consider a component of very nice m - morsifications with @xmath37 critical points and @xmath4 boundary points with one critical value greater than all boundary values .",

    "the first possibility is if we obtain a function with double critical point . in this case",
    "we replace a double point by a new boundary point @xmath67 .",
    "the second possibility is if we obtain a function having one critical point coinciding with one boundary point .",
    "we act in the same way for the case of a critical value being less then a ; ; boundary values .",
    "the above observations prove the following identity : @xmath70 now we apply lemmas  [ l - a1 ] and  [ l - a2 ] : @xmath71 therefore , @xmath10 this concludes the proof of theorem  [ t - a1 ] .    in conclusion of this section",
