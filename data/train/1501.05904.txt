    "after decades of human exploration of space , it appears that there have been no visitors to the solar system from other star systems .",
    "this is in sharp contrast to the ( perhaps naive ) view that , with hundreds of billions of stars in the milky way galaxy , the likelihood of finding habitable planets around many of these stars , and the possibility of life arising on a good proportion of these planets  as evidenced by the seeming rapidity of life developing on the young earth  there should be a large number of technological civilizations , and at least one of these should have developed spacecraft capable of reaching the solar system .",
    "the variance between this supposition , and the lack of evidence for any visitations , is known as the fermi paradox  @xcite .",
    "its resolution has vexed many minds over the decades , although at this point , empirical data sufficient to address the question is lacking .",
    "this has not stopped the development of theoretical models whose intent is to provide insight into the fermi paradox .",
    "an as example appropriate to our discussion , landis  @xcite originally developed a model of interstellar colonization processes as a simple percolation model , where each settled system has a given probability @xmath1 of colonizing all of its neighboring systems ; since the model was simulated on a cubic lattice , this fixed the number of such neighbors to be six for every single star system .",
    "a generalization of this model was given by hair and hedman  @xcite , where the cubic lattice was still used , but colonization along diagonal connections was allowed ",
    "so each system had up to 26 neighboring systems  and @xmath1 was the probability for each neighboring system ( rather than all ) to be colonized by a neighbor . however , neither model used the actual  geography \" of star systems ; this aspect was included in the model developed by cartin  @xcite . there a percolation model was also used , but instead of a fixed lattice , the observed positions of all known star systems within 40 parsecs ( pc ) of the solar system were taken as colonization sites .    the main focus of ref .",
    "4 was the following question : _ supposing each star system is the point of origin for a space - faring civilization with a given sociological drive and technological prowess , how many could reach the solar system with their colonization process ? _ to codify this , the two parameters of the model were a probability @xmath1 for a given settled system to colonize a particular neighboring stellar system ( `` sociological drive '' ) , and the maximum travel distance @xmath2 that its spacecraft can travel , which thus determines adjacency ( `` technological prowess '' ) .",
    "the monte carlo simulations of these percolation processes allowed the calculation of the number of systems originating colonization programs that could reach the solar system as a function @xmath3 .",
    "in other words , @xmath3 is a correlation function reflecting whether the solar system and any other given star system are in the same cluster of systems colonized by a given interstellar civilization .",
    "this paper asks a different question , namely : _ for this calculated function @xmath3 and the evident lack of visitors to the solar system , what are the upper limits on the likelihood of spacefaring life originating on a given habitable planet , as a function of @xmath1 and @xmath2 ? _ the number of interstellar civilizations reaching the solar system must be the number of stellar origin sites for colonization efforts could possibly reach us , multiplied by the probability of a star - faring civilization arising at each star system . from the self - evident lack of visitors  meaning the number of colonizing efforts reaching the solar system is less than one  the probability of a species willing and able to execute a colonization program must be simply the inverse of the probability of such civilizations evolving in a given star system .",
    "section [ constraint ] develops this idea further , by using an equation for the expected number of interstellar civilizations based on a break - down of the various relevant factors in a manner similar to the drake equation , and solving for the probability of a spacefaring species arising on a given habitable world in terms of current constraints on such exoplanets . as with ref .",
    "4 , all types of stellar systems are lumped into three broad categories  bright single stars , dim single stars , and multiple star systems . specific forms of @xmath4 are obtained by fitting the results of the simulations in ref .",
    "4 to a modified power law , where @xmath5 runs over the three system types . using these fitting functions ,",
    "an example case is shown for a choice of habitable planet occurrence rates around various star system types , and the maximum possible probability of a spacefaring species arising within the local solar neighborhood are calculated as a function of @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "these results are summarized and discussed in section [ conclusions ] .",
    "as mentioned in section [ intro ] , this work begins with an equation based on the drake equation , which parametrizes the number of extraterrestrial civilizations in the milky way galaxy from a combination of astrophysical , biological , technological and sociological inputs , with an eye towards estimating the total number of civilizations which are available for radio or other communications .",
    "a similar idea is useful in estimating the possibility of direct contact with an alien civilization .",
    "specifically , such visits are only possible if ( 1 ) a potentially space - faring civilization arises in another star system , and ( 2 ) this civilization has the willingness and technology to reach the solar system , possibly after colonizing one or more star systems along the way .",
    "it is now possible to make educated guesses on the likelihood of the first point .",
    "the result of this computation is a variable @xmath6 $ ] , for a star system @xmath7 , where @xmath8 denotes the probability of an interstellar civilization arising in star system @xmath7 .",
    "note that we use the term `` system '' here , since we include the possibility of space - faring species originating within a multiple star system .",
    "the second is an appropriate setting for the percolation model developed earlier in ref .",
    "4 . the results calculated in that paper implicitly give a correlation function between the solar system and all other systems in question , e.g. the probability that the solar system and another given system are both within the same colonization cluster , based on a choice for colonization probability @xmath1 and travel distance @xmath2 .",
    "for a stellar system @xmath7 , this correlation probability is denoted @xmath9 .",
    "then the expected number @xmath10 of civilizations visiting the solar system is given by @xmath11 we can parametrize @xmath8 much like the drake equation to get @xmath12 where the parameters @xmath13 and @xmath14 , for each stellar system @xmath7 , are defined in table [ def ] .",
    ".[def]definitions of parameters used in equation ( [ fermi - drake - eqn ] ) for the expected number @xmath10 of interstellar civilizations reaching the solar system .",
    "the total probability @xmath8 of a space - faring civilization arising in a given star system is the product @xmath15 . [",
    "cols=\"^,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     as a specific instance of the use of this model , values for the parameters are chosen based on a geometric mean of results given in the literature , cited by winn and fabrycky  @xcite .",
    "specifically , the occurrence rates from table 2 of that work are used , where the three listings for m stars are used for dim stars , the four entries for fgk are combined with the gk entry for bright stars , and the occurrence rate for habitable planets in multiple star systems is chosen as 75% of that for bright stars .",
    "this gives the parameter choices of @xmath16    \\\\              & = & ( 0.0232 , 0.309 , 0.0174)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the maximum possible values of @xmath17 are then calculated , and a contour plot showing the results is given in figure [ bioprob ] .",
    "we now discuss the results shown in this figure ; these comments relate specifically to the choice of @xmath18 used here , but the broad outline remains the same regardless of what values are chosen .    * interstellar civilizations capable of making longer journeys between star systems ( higher @xmath2 ) , and more likely to begin these journeys ( larger @xmath1 ) , have a higher chance of reaching the solar system .",
    "thus , the empirical fact that visiting spacecraft of this type are not observed places stronger limits on @xmath17 , and so the upper limit of this product decreases in size as we move towards the upper - right hand corner of figure [ bioprob ] .",
    "* specifically , the maximum range of travel distances for interstellar colonizers studied in this research was chosen to be 7.0 pc .",
    "if such a civilization always colonized its neighbors ( @xmath19 ) , then the upper limit on the probability of such a species arising within a biosphere less than 40 pc away from the solar system is @xmath20 . in other words , at most only one of out every 585 habitable planets within the local solar neighborhood could be the cradle of an interstellar civilization in order not to have evidence of their spacecraft in our solar system .",
    "* there is a relatively large regime of colonization probabilities @xmath1 and maximum travel distances @xmath2 where interstellar civilizations would never reach the solar system , even if technological civilizations capable of star travel arose on every single earth - like planet in the solar neighborhood .",
    "the reach of these interstellar civilizations could be quite sizable , as seen in ref .",
    "4 . however , the practical effect here is that there is a region in @xmath21 space where @xmath22 regardless of the value of @xmath17 .",
    "recall that the product @xmath17 deals with the chances of an interstellar civilization arising on a given habitable planet , where we have estimated values for the expected number of such planets per stellar system ( as divided between bright and dim stars , and multiple systems ) . since the latter is on the order of 1 - 10% , then the most stringent limit on the probability of a space - faring species evolving within any star system is around @xmath23 .",
    "relative changes in the sizes of @xmath18 for the three different system types @xmath5 may change the shapes of the contours given in figure [ bioprob ] , but the upper limit values for a given @xmath1 and @xmath2 will be altered only for absolute changes in the order of magnitude for the number of habitable planets per system , regardless of system type .",
    "in this paper , the model of interstellar colonization as a percolation process , originally developed by landis and applied to the physical positions of all star systems within 40 pc , is used to develop upper limits on the probability of an interstellar civilization arising on an earth - like planet , and spacecraft of that civilization reaching the solar system .",
    "the model was parametrized in a manner similar to the drake equation , with coefficients giving the fraction @xmath24 of stars with planets , and the number of those planets @xmath25 within the habitable zone of each stellar system , the fraction of habitable planets @xmath26 that actually develop life , and finally the fraction of those biospheres @xmath14 which originate a space - faring civilization . at this point in our knowledge",
    ", there are now empirical constraints on the first two parameters , but the latter are more or less free .",
    "the philosophy of this paper is to use a simple model in order to place some upper limits on those values dealing with the origin of life and interstellar civilizations , since there is currently no observational data on these issues . our ignorance of many of the processes involved in the evolution of a technological species , and the likelihood of that species choosing to develop interstellar settlements leads to the choice of the simple model given here , with as few parameters as possible to give a reasonable look at the question at hand .",
    "however , in some sense we have just moved our ignorance  instead of leaving @xmath26 and @xmath14 open , this work puts upper limits on those values at the expense of two new coefficients , the probability @xmath1 of a space - faring species to colonize one of its neighboring star systems , and the maximum distance @xmath2 that can be considered `` neighboring '' . yet",
    "this shift in focus may be helpful , in that it puts a different light on questions relating to the fermi paradox .",
    "indeed , as shown elsewhere  @xcite , a maximum travel distance @xmath2 of about 3 pc is sufficient to allow effective interstellar travel , i.e. actual travel paths are less than twice the shortest distance between end points , with the benefit of passing through intermediate star systems , allowing for replenishment and refit . as for the colonization probability @xmath1 , as yet humanity itself has not taken this step , but it is for each of us to evaluate the likelihood of this happening when technology has reached the point where this question is a viable one .",
    "the percolation model presented here , however , only includes nodes representing all star systems with 40 pc of the solar system , and thus does not account for the possibility of interstellar civilizations arising outside of that volume .",
    "indeed , it is perfectly conceivable that a galaxy - wide colonization effort may have started from any point within the milky way , as long as the colonization probability @xmath1 is large enough , leading to much smaller upper bounds on @xmath17 . to truly study this issue",
    ", the percolation model would also have to be extended onto the galactic scale . the stellar number density  the expected number of star systems found inside a cubic parsec of volume , for example  is not constant over the milky way , but varies according to both distance away from the center of the galaxy , as well as scale height away from the galactic plane  @xcite .",
    "thus , the study of percolation clusters using a physically realistic distribution of simulated stellar systems would not correspond to previous models from statistical mechanics .",
    "said in a different way , the critical probability @xmath27 , i.e. the probability to have a galaxy - spanning cluster , needed as a function of @xmath2 is currently unknown .",
    "thus , the size of the largest cluster , corresponding to the interstellar civilization with the greatest reach , as a function of the colonization probability @xmath1 and the maximum travel distance @xmath2 between two adjacent systems , remains a problem to be studied in future simulations .",
    "however , having a relatively low value of @xmath27 would imply that the upper limits on @xmath17 would be very small , or else a galactic civilization would have arisen and easily reached out solar system , contrary to observation .",
    "another important caveat for the work here is that none of the relative motion of star systems in the solar neighborhood is taken into account .",
    "this motion leads to changes in positioning over periods of only @xmath28 yr  @xcite .",
    "the monte carlo simulations used to model the percolation process in ref .",
    "4 are `` timeless '' , in the sense that all systems are static , and the speed of colonizing spacecraft is not considered .",
    "it is likely this time scale is roughly the same as the process for a newly settled star system from an interstellar civilization to built its own colonizing spacecraft , and then this craft reaching a new system , so the dynamical changing of available star systems for a star - faring species would definitely affect the results presented here ; this also is an issue for further work ."
