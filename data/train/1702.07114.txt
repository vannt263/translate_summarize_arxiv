    "these applications are closely associated with the presence of dirac electrons in free - standing silicene predicted from theory  @xcite . although free - standing silicene possess dirac cone band structures , the existence of dirac cones in supported silicene is heavily under debate in experiment , especially for the most common system experimentally probed : silicene synthesized on ag(111 ) ( abbreviated as si / ag hereafter )  @xcite .",
    "several experiments including scanning tunneling spectroscopy ( sts )  @xcite and angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) studies  @xcite suggest that the dirac cone structure is preserved in si / ag .",
    "in contrast , density functional theory ( dft ) and other experimental studies  @xcite claim that the opposite is true : the dirac cone is absent in si / ag , due to the strong si - ag interaction and significant charge transfer between si and ag layers .",

    "_ recently reported novel type dirac cone pairs in si / ag  @xcite . in their arpes measurements ,",
    "six pairs of dirac cones [ fig .",
    "[ fig : model ] ] are observed at the edge of the ag(1@xmath21 ) brillouin zone ( bz ) [ fig .  [ struct_and_bz](c ) ] .",
    "the dirac cone pairs sustain even with the presence of the ag substrate .",
    "this study not only proposes a new recipe to achieve silicene - based high speed electronic devices , but also raises new mechanisms for the formation of dirac cone electronic structures .",
    "unfortunately , the authors pointed out that the experimental observation can not be explained in terms of existing band structure calculations .",
    "in addition , the underlying mechanism for the formation of novel dirac cone structures in si / ag is still illusive . in the present work",
    "we reproduce the arpes observation of dirac cones based on first - principles dft calculations combined with orbital - selective band unfolding techniques .",
    "we demonstrate the presence of six pairs of dirac cones near the boundary of the brillouin zone ( bz ) of ag(1@xmath21 ) .",
    "our theoretical results are highly consistent with experimental data presented in the arpes study , except that we find evidences for the upper branches of dirac cones being absent in both intact and doped systems .",
    "we find the dirac cones are not the intrinsic properties of either silicene itself or the underlying ag slab . instead",
    ", these dirac cones are induced by the strong interface si - ag hybridization , mainly composed of si @xmath3 orbitals and ag @xmath4 bands , which are radically different from the dirac cones of the freestanding silicene .",
    "to reveal the key factors beneath the arpes experiments , first - principles dft calculations are performed to reproduce the arpes spectra .",
    "we note that the energy bands from regular dft calculations are different from the arpes spectra in three aspects : + ( i ) for the systems containing translational symmetry breaking , e.g. reconstructions or impurities , a supercell ( sc ) approach is usually adopted in dft band calculations",
    ". then dft bands are folded into the supercell brillouin zone , namely the brillouin zone associated with the supercell symmetry , while the arpes measurements still span over the primitive cell ( pc ) brillouin zone .",
    "+ ( ii ) the dft bands are often referred to the energy dispersion relation @xmath5 .",
    "however the arpes spectra are related to the spectral function @xmath6 , which is reduced to @xmath5 only in the picture of single - particle green function .",
    "+ ( iii ) the dft bands always comprise all electronic states of the cell under computation , including contributions from both the surface and the underlying substrate .",
    "by contrast , arpes is mainly a surface sensitive technique , only the electronic states near the surface contribute to the arpes spectra .    to bridge the gap between dft bands and",
    "measured arpes spectra , band unfolding is used to calculate the effective band structure ( ebs ) of the sc  @xcite , in response to statement ( i ) and ( ii ) . with respect to ( iii ) , an extra weight function @xmath7 is invoked to realize the orbital selection rules . via selecting the orbitals of surface atoms",
    ", we obtain the ebs originated from the selected surface atoms , which are directly comparable to the measured arpes spectra .",
    "we rewrite the electronic wavefunction @xmath8 from sc calculations in the basis of pc wavefuncitons @xmath9 . here",
    "we use capital letters to denote quantities associated with sc and lowercase letters for quantities associated with pc : @xmath10 where @xmath11 denotes the band index and @xmath12 ( @xmath13 is the reciprocal vector of sc ) . using the blch theorem and the plane - wave basis ,",
    "@xmath9 and @xmath8 can be written as : @xmath14\\exp(i\\mathbf{k}_i\\cdot\\mathbf{r } ) , \\end{split}\\ ] ] @xmath15\\exp(i\\mathbf{k}\\cdot\\mathbf{r } ) , \\end{split}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 is the blch function , @xmath17 is the coefficient of the bloch function on the plane - wave basis .",

    "details can be found in ref  @xcite . since only @xmath20 is need in eq .",
    "[ probability ] , only the sc wavefunction is calculated . to achieve selection of orbitals from specific atoms , we introduce an extra weight function @xmath7 in calculating the spectral function , which is modified as @xmath21 in principle , the choice of @xmath7 is arbitrary . here , we set @xmath7 to be the projected density of states ( pdos ) of certain orbitals @xmath22 .",

    "we use a k - point mesh @xmath24 for structural optimization and @xmath25 in the self - consistent calculations . using the conjugate gradient method ,",

    "[ struct_and_bz ] , we model silicene supported on ag(111 ) with a four - layer ag slab covered by a monolayer silicene .",
    "after geometry relaxation , the si layer on ag slab exhibit the @xmath0 periodicity with respect to free standing silicene @xmath26 structure with atomic reconstructions .",
    "the average si - ag bond distance is about 2.7   , lying in between the values for the ag - ag bond length of 2.92  and si - si bond length of 2.36   .",
    "it indicates that a strong si - ag interaction could take place once si atoms is deposited onto ag(111 ) .",
    "thus , three major ingredients can alter the electronic properties in si / ag as compared to freestanding silicene : ( i ) the @xmath0 reconstruction of silicene ; ( ii ) the electron transfer between si layer and ag substrate ; and ( iii ) the orbital hybridization between si and ag atoms .",
    "this complexity leads to the possibility of forming dirac cones of different origins : ( i ) dirac cones coming from the bare reconstructed silicene with possible doping ; ( ii ) from bare ag substrate ; ( iii ) from band renormalization induced by strong si - ag hybridization .    to explore the underlying mechanism of the novel dirac cone pairs observed in arpes , we first isolate the contributions of si and ag to the band structure of the composite system , through projecting the ebs on different layers of si / ag and comparing to those for isolated silicene and the ag(111 ) slab .",
    "the ebs of si / ag are projected on the si layer , the 1st layer and the 4th layer of the ag(111 ) slab , respectively , as shown in fig .  [ struct_and_bz](c ) . here",
    "we denote the ebs of @xmath27 ( @xmath28 si / ag , silicene , or ag slab ) projected onto the @xmath29 atomic layer ( @xmath30 si , ag 1st layer , or ag 4th layer ) as ebs(@xmath29@@xmath27 ) .",
    "the difference between ebs(si layer@si / ag ) and ebs(silicene ) is that the former includes the influence from the ag substrate while there is none in the latter .",
    "similarly , the comparison between ebs(ag layer@si / ag ) and ebs(ag slab ) reveals the effect of si layer on the ag slab .",
    "the cone pairs reported in arpes locate at the edge of the bz of ag(@xmath26 ) , which can be measured directly along cut a and b in fig .",
    "[ struct_and_bz](c ) , the same cut as those used in the experiment .",
    "the ebs along cut a and b are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cone ] .",
    "figure  [ fig : cone](a ) and ( f ) shows the ebs(si layer@si / ag ) along cut a and cut b , respectively .",
    "the spectra simulated for the ebs(si layer@si / ag ) using band unfolding techniques described above show an excellent agreement with the experimental arpes spectra .",
    "both theoretical and experimental spectra show an evident peak - valley - peak feature in fig .",
    "[ fig : cone](a ) .",
    "the peaks are claimed to come from a pair of dirac cones in the arpes measurement  @xcite .",
    "the novel dirac cones in silicene / ag(111 ) are radically different from the dirac cones in free - standing silicene in two major aspects .",
    "firstly , these cones in si / ag are not strictly linear in energy dispersion , which is akin to a gapped cone .",
    "nevertheless , the effective electron masses near the cones are calculated to be very small , only @xmath31 fitted to the data in fig .",
    "[ fig : cone](a ) , where @xmath32 is the mass of a free electron . with the presence of such low - mass quasiparticles ,",
    "it is a promising material to build high - speed electronic devices .",
    "secondly , the upper branches of the cones are absent . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cone](a - f ) , the upper branch of the dirac cones brought by strong si - ag hybridzation is not clearly visible in our theoretical band analysis . it might be shifted to higher energy above the fermi level or is further mixed with other si / ag bands , thus being hidden in the background of unoccupied effective bands .. we also dope one potassium atom in the si(@xmath0)/ag(@xmath1 ) supercell , while the ebs is only downshifted by 0.15  ev without modifications on its overall shape [ fig .",
    "[ fig : doping ] ] .",
    "thus , strictly speaking , these dirac cones are dirac - like gapped half cones .",
    "to reveal their origin , we find that the dirac cone features in the ebs plot of si / ag come from strong si - ag hybridization . since the weight function in eq .",
    "[ spacial_band_unfolding ] is the pdos of the selected orbitals , the similarity between ebs(si layer@si / ag ) and ebs(ag 1st layer@si / ag ) indicates a strong hybridization between the si layer and the 1st ag layer .",
    "the dirac cones become less obvious in the ebs(ag 4th layer@si / ag ) , which is similar to ebs(ag slab ) , due to the weaker interaction between the si layer and the 4th ag layer .",
    "our detailed analysis also indicate that the dirac cones are primarily contributed by si @xmath3 orbitals and its hybridization with ag @xmath4 orbitals  [ fig .",
    "[ fig : orbital ] ] .",
    "in addition , we note that the ebs(ag slab ) is largely upwards shifted for comparison , which indicates a strong electron transfer from si layer to ag slab in the supported monolayer silicene on ag(111 ) .",
    "therefore , the observed dirac cones in si / ag is the combined result of hybridization and electron transfer between si layer and ag layer .",
    "these dirac cones do not originate solely from bare silicene or bare ag slab .",
    "firstly , since the intrinsic dirac cone is folded onto @xmath33 point in bz of si(@xmath0 ) , it is counter - intuitive that only six pairs of dirac cones are observed at the edge of ag(@xmath26 ) bz , instead of at the edge / center of the bz for si(@xmath26 ) or si(@xmath0 ) .",
    "it is predictable that there are gapped cones in ebs(silicene ) at the the middle of cut b , the m and m@xmath34 along cut e , and at k@xmath34 along cut f. our calculations of ebs(silicene ) verify this prediction [ fig .",
    "[ fig : cone](j ) and [ fig : cross](e)(j ) ] .",
    "however , strongly influenced by the ag slab , no dirac cone is observed at these points in both experimental and our simulated arpes spectra .",
    "we note ebs(si layer@si / ag ) are radically different from ebs(silicene ) . at @xmath35 of cut",
    "b , ebs(si layer@si / ag ) is valley - like while ebs(silicene ) presents a peak - like feature .",
    "this dirac cones at m , m@xmath34 and k@xmath34 point are also absent in ebs(si layer@si / ag ) .",
    "thus , the cones in ebs(si layer@si / ag ) are different from the gapped cone in ebs(silicene ) .",
    "secondly , there is no cone in ebs(ag slab ) along cut a and b. only the valley at @xmath36 is observed for cut a , while only the valley at @xmath37 is observed for cut b. thus , the cones in ebs(si layer@si / ag ) are absent in ebs(ag slab ) .",
    "moreover , the ag slab has a strong signal near the fermi level along cut e and f. ebs signals are weak in ebs(si layer@si / ag ) , and become stronger when the ag contribution increases ( ag 4th layer@si / ag layer ) .",
    "these bands are similar to the ebs of bare silver slab .",
    "the similarity between the ebs of si / ag and the bare ag slab shows that the ebs of si / ag are dominated by the ag substrate , but also being strongly modified by the presence of si layer .",
    "the screening of the si layer explains the obscure signals along cut e in experimental arpes results .",
    "using the density functional theory combined with the orbital - selective band unfolding technique , we study the effective band structures ( ebs ) of si(@xmath0)/ag(@xmath1 ) .",
    "consistent with the arpes measurement recently reported by feng _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , we observe six pairs of dirac cones near the boundary of the brillouin zone ( bz ) of ag(1@xmath21 ) , while no dirac cone is observed inside the bz .",
    "we find that dirac cones are not the intrinsic properties of the silicene or the ag slab ; instead , these dirac cones are emergent phenomena induced by the strong si - ag hybridization , mainly composed by si @xmath3 orbitals and ag @xmath4 orbitals , radically different from the dirac cones of the freestanding silicene .",
