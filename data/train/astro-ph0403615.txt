    "to study agn spectra , one has to deal with many emission features as well as continuum .",
    "simple statistics often can not handle the large number of measured parameters efficiently , therefore , a multivariate analysis is needed . principal component analysis ( pca )",
    "is one such powerful tool ( see also boroson 2004 ) .",
    "suppose we have @xmath0 agns in a sample , each has @xmath1 measured parameters @xmath2 .",
    "we can write @xmath3 @xmath2 are unit vectors and @xmath4 are data .",
    "pca defines a set of new orthogonal variables , principal components @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) , which are linear combinations of the original variables + ( 1 ) + an easy way to understand pca is to consider it from the geometrical point of view ( francis & wills 1999 ) .",
    "pca aims to define orthogonal principal axes in a multi - dimensional space , as shown in fig .  1 , where a correlation exists between measured parameters @xmath7 and",
    "@xmath8 , and two principal components ( pcs ) are defined .",
    "pc1 ( or @xmath9 ) accounts for most variance ( the correlation ) , pc2 ( or @xmath10 ) is small and can be ignored .",
    "pca can be applied to agn spectra directly ( francis et al . 1992 ; shang et al . 2003 ) . in this spectral principal component analysis ( spca ) , each spectrum is divided into small wavelength bins , and the flux in each bin ( e.g. , @xmath11 ) is an input variable .",
    "( 1 ) can be written as + ( 2 ) + the result principal components can then be also represented as spectra , @xmath12 $ ] , namely , the spectral principal components ( spcs ) .",
    "an original spectrum can be reconstructed by adding the weighted principal component spectra to the mean spectrum , +   + where @xmath13 are calculated from eq .  2 for each object @xmath14 , and are referred as the weights ( or scores ) of @xmath15 . in other words ,",
    "all original spectra are made from the principal component spectra .",
    "this implies that a limited number of spcs can be used to measure spectra in large samples ( see also yip et al .",
    "if there are strong linear relationships among the original variables ( or wavelength bins ) , each of these relationships will be represented by a principal component .",
    "fewer principal components may be required to describe the total variation of a sample , thus providing a simpler description of the dataset ( francis et al .",
    "any principal component accounting for a significant fraction of the total sample variance might be related to one or more underlying fundamental physical parameters , giving some physical insight into the cause of the variations ( boroson & green 1992 , boroson 2002 ) .",
    "however , pca is only a statistical tool and it is still up to the investigators to judge whether the resulting pcs have any physical meanings .",
    "pca is a linear analysis .",
    "if there are strong non - linear relationships involved , pca is not able to identify them directly and there will be crosstalk among the resulting principal components .",
    "when a non - linear part of a relationship is not strong , pca is still able to follow the `` linear '' trend of the relationship . in spca ,",
    "good redshifts are needed because line shifts can cause strong non - linear effects .",
    "line width change also introduces non - linear relationships among binned fluxes , so caution is needed in interpreting spca results .",
    "shang et al .  ( 2003 ) show the power of spca in analyzing a small sample of qsos .",
    "spca decomposes the qso spectra into three independent , significant principal components ( fig .",
    "spc1 represents the baldwin effect , but only line - cores are involved . by using spc1 instead of integrated line ew , the scatter in the luminosity relationship is reduced .",
    "spc2 shows changes of uv - optical continuum slope , due to intrinsic qso continuum slope variation and/or reddening .",
    "spc3 extends boroson & green s eigenvector 1 relationship ( boroson & green 1992 ) , to include many uv line properties and line - width changes .",
    "one of the advantages of spca is that correlations can be investigated without parameterizing the line profiles or defining the continua .",
    "therefore , it is especially useful for analyzing large samples .    also unlike the `` composite spectrum analysis '' , spca analysis keeps the information for individual objects , e.g. , the weights of the principal component spectra for each object , which can be used to correlate with other non - spectral properties , such as black hole mass etc .",
    "spca has also been used for classifying agn spectra ( e.g. , francis et al .",
    "1992 , boroson 2002 ) .    to demonstrate its use for large samples",
    ", we applied spca to the sdss dr1 qso spectra in the region of ly@xmath16-civ - ciii ] .",
    "we choose only 771 objects with high redshift - confidence ( @xmath17 ) ( stoughton et al .",
    "2002 ) . for a sample with uniform spectral properties ,",
    "the distribution of the weights of spcs should be random and centered at the origin . however , there are outliers in the distribution of the weights of spc1 and spc2 ( fig .  3 , left ) , indicating that these spectra are peculiar ( fig .  3 ,",
    "right ) .",
    "we are interested in the spectral properties of the majority of the sample , so after excluding the peculiar spectra , spca is applied to the remaining 639 spectra .",
    "4 ( left ) shows the first three principal components which can be used to classify the spectra and investigate the correlations among the spectra properties .",
    "spc1 shows that the line - cores are correlated with each other , similar to the spc1 in sec . 2 , but the expected baldwin effect has large scatter ( fig .  4 , right ) .",
    "spc2 shows line - width change : strong - spc2 objects have narrow ly@xmath16 .",
    "spc3 shows absorptions ( or line shifts ) in ly@xmath16and civ ; strong - spc3 objects have ly@xmath16  and civ  absorptions .",
