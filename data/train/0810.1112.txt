    "given possible applications in heavy ion collision experiments  @xcite , the last 20 years have seen a huge amount of phenomenological work on the properties of heavy quarkonium at temperatures just above the deconfinement crossover ( for a recent review , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . during the last couple of years",
    ", these phenomenological works have been complemented by more theoretical investigations , aiming at a qcd - based approach to the problem .",
    "the purpose of this talk is to distill a basic message from some of the latter studies  @xcite@xcite .",
    "let us start by defining the observables we are interested in .",
    "the heavy quark contribution to the spectral function of the electromagnetic current can be written as _",
    "-^ t ^3 * x * e^i qx 12 [ ^(x ) , _ ( 0 ) ] , where @xmath4 ; @xmath5 is the heavy quark field operator in the heisenberg picture ; @xmath6 $ ] is the thermal expectation value ; @xmath7 is the inverse temperature ; and we assume the metric convention ( @xmath8@xmath9@xmath9@xmath9 ) .",
    "this spectral function determines the production rate of muon  antimuon pairs from the system  @xcite , = ( 1 + ) ( 1 - ) ^12 n_(q^0 ) _",
    "v(q ) , where @xmath10 is the heavy quark electric charge in units of @xmath11 , and @xmath12 is the bose - einstein distribution function . in the following we assume , largely for notational simplicity , that the muon ",
    "antimuon pair is at rest with respect to the thermal medium , i.e.  @xmath13 .",
    ", with @xmath14 , the main modification would be a shift of the two - particle threshold , from @xmath15 to @xmath16 ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) . ]",
    "furthermore , @xmath1 denotes the heavy quark ( charm , bottom ) pole mass .",
    "= 6.0 cm   = 6.0 cm    the ultimate goal of the study would then be to compute @xmath17 and @xmath18 in a certain energy range around the two - particle threshold , say @xmath19 , and in a certain temperature range , say @xmath20  gev .",
    "the phenomenological interest of the problem lies in the fact that the observables mentioned are believed to undergo a qualitative change in this temperature range , thus constituting a sensitive `` thermometer '' for the system ; examples of possible patterns are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : phen ] .",
    "now , given that we are interested in fairly low temperatures and that the charm quark mass is fairly moderate compared with the qcd scale , it would be interesting to tackle the problem with lattice techniques ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "unfortunately , lattice methods are euclidean , and even for a perfectly known euclidean correlator @xmath21 , @xmath22 $ ] , it is strictly speaking not possible to invert the relation to @xmath17 , _ viz .",
    "_ g_v ( ) = _ 0^ _ v ( ) , without inserting further input ( for instance , in momentum space , one must set @xmath23 in order to get the correct analytic continuation from @xmath24 to @xmath25 ) .",
    "another possible strong coupling method , an analysis through a gravity dual ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) , is not available for qcd . in the following we therefore resort to the weak - coupling expansion , which at least is a theoretically consistent framework ; in fact , particularly for the bottomonium system , experience from zero temperature ( see , e.g. , ref .  @xcite )",
    "suggests that numerical convergence could be reasonable as well .",
    "a systematic weak - coupling computation can be carried out once the scales that enter the problem have been identified . in the heavy quark - mass and high - temperature limit , the qcd coupling constant",
    "@xmath2 is small , and the quarkonium states resemble non - relativistic systems such a positronium . thereby we treat the heavy quark mass @xmath1 as the `` hard '' scale ; the inverse bohr radius , or relative momentum @xmath26 as the `` soft '' scale ; and the binding energy @xmath27 as the `` ultrasoft '' scale .",
    "we assume the qcd scale to be at most as large as the ultrasoft scale .",
    "the energy scale with which we probe the system , @xmath25 , could in principle be anything .",
    "however , conceivably the most interesting range is @xmath28 , i.e. deviations from the two - particle threshold by at most the binding energy ; this is where the quarkonium resonance is to be found . in the following ,",
    "we concentrate on this regime .    finally , we need to decide how temperature relates to the zero - temperature scales .",
    "maybe quarkonium melts when @xmath29 , given that then hard particles from the plasma have enough momentum to kick constituents out of the bound state ?",
    "however , such a temperature can not be high enough , since kicking happens through interactions , and those are suppressed by @xmath2 . on the other hand , increasing the temperature just a little bit , to @xmath30 , is certainly enough to dissociate the bound state , given that then even the coulomb binding gets debye screened .",
    "in fact , removing completely the coulomb binding is an overkill , since a finite width could arise already earlier on .",
    "to summarise , the relevant range is somewhere between these two limits , @xmath31  @xcite .",
    "therefore we now assume the equivalent hierarchy m t >",
    "g^4 m , and integrate out the hard scales one - by - one .",
    "integrating out the hard scale @xmath1 yields an effective theory called nrqcd  @xcite .",
    "the topic is very well developed by now , and we only list some basic steps here ; many details and references can be found , e.g. , in the review  @xcite .    starting from the qcd lagrangian , @xmath32 , one can first carry out a foldy - wouthuysen transformation : | (    c + -    ) ^ ( - ) , ( ) (    c +    ) , where @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 are two - component spinors . expanding in @xmath36 and dropping total derivatives , this yields _ & = & ^ ( id_0 - m + ) + ^ ( id_0 + m - ) & + & ( ^g*e * - ^g*e * ) + ( ) + _ .",
    "the heavy masses on the first row can be shifted away by @xmath37 , @xmath38 .",
    "the mixed terms on the second row become rapidly oscillating after this shift , @xmath39 , and describe hard reactions ; such oscillations can be integrated out yielding four - fermion operators . finally , at the loop level , we need to correct for the local expansion through matching coefficients , which concerns both parameters , e.g.@xmath40 , as well as composite operators , e.g.   |^k = ( 1 - + ... ) .",
    "the next step is to integrate out the hard thermal scale @xmath0 . in the heavy - quark sector",
    ", this does nothing dramatic , just corrects the parameters .",
    "in fact , since the thermal loops can be computed within nrqcd , all effects are power - suppressed in mass , e.g.  @xcite m = . in the gauge field sector",
    ", the same step yields nothing but the hard thermal loop effective theory  @xcite : @xmath41 .",
    "the crux of the problem is the integration out of the scale @xmath42 , yielding an effective theory called pnrqcd  @xcite .",
    "( to be more precise , all gluons of energy or momentum @xmath43 are integrated out , while the composite quarkonium fields left over as dynamical degrees of freedom can still have relative momentum @xmath43 ; it is only their energy that is small , @xmath44 . )",
    "although well established , this step is in many ways more delicate than the previous ones ; we only outline the basic ideas here ( for reviews , see refs .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the pnrqcd setup is special in that in only applies to particular green s functions ; in the thermal context , we can say that the thermal expectation value is restricted to the quark ",
    "antiquark sector of the fock space , @xmath45 \\to   \\tr[p_{{\\bf 3^ * } \\otimes { \\bf 3 } } ( ... ) \\exp(-\\beta\\hat h)]$ ] . thereby exponentially small effects @xmath46 are omitted . for the quark ",
    "antiquark pair , were represent colour as @xmath47 , and space coordinates as @xmath48 , @xmath49 .",
    "the singlet field , @xmath50 , is diagonal in colour - space , @xmath51 , while the octet field is traceless , @xmath52 , where @xmath53 defines the generator normalization through @xmath54 = t_f \\delta^{ab}$ ] .",
    "the interpolating operators for the component fields @xmath55 can be chosen as ^(*x*_2,t)w_*x*_2,*x*_1 ( * x*_1,t ) & & z_s^12(*r * ) s(*x*,*r*,t ) , + ^(*x*_2,t)w_*x*_2,*x * t^a w_*x*,*x*_1 ( * x*_1,t ) & & z_o^12(*r * ) o^a(*x*,*r*,t ) , where @xmath56 is a straight wilson line .",
    "subsequently a general lagrangian is written for the fields @xmath57 as well as the ultrasoft gauge fields , respecting gauge invariance and expanded in @xmath36 , @xmath58 : & & \\ { ^ + .",
    "v_(r ) + } + ( r^2 , ) , where @xmath59 is the covariant derivative in the adjoint representation , i.e.   @xmath60 $ ] .",
    "as indicated , gauge fields only depend on the center - of - mass coordinates @xmath61 , whereas dependence on @xmath62 can be taylor - expanded .",
    "as far as the structure on the second row is concerned , we remark that at leading order @xmath63 , as can be inferred from a tree - level matching of a three - object vertex to nrqcd , on which side the covariant derivative can be expanded as @xmath64",
    ". now , the effective theory contains many `` potentials '' , @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , which are to be treated as matching coefficients .",
    "they can be computed from various wilson loops with @xmath70 ( since @xmath71 ) , i.e. in the static limit .",
    "we return to the determination of @xmath72 presently .    for the computation of the spectral function @xmath17 , a representation of the vector current within pnrqcd is also needed .",
    "the vector current is a local object , corresponding to @xmath73 . at zero distance , @xmath74 , and",
    "the relation between pnrqcd and nrqcd fields becomes unambiguous .",
    "in addition , spin indices , which have been suppressed in the discussion above , can be added in a trivial way .",
    "thereby the spectral function can indeed be computed within pnrqcd ( for a concise yet explicit presentation at zero temperature , see ref .",
    "even though our ultimate goal is to treat the situation @xmath76 , in which case the scale @xmath75 is integrated out within pnrqcd , it will be illuminating to start by considering the case @xmath77 .",
    "indeed the scale @xmath75 can then be integrated out together with the scale @xmath78 , and the problem boils down to determining the potentials of the previous section in the presence of non - zero debye screening ( since @xmath79 ) .",
    "luckily , this problem was considered already in ref .",
    "@xcite . in that paper",
    "the result was called a `` real - time static potential '' , and was in general denoted by @xmath80 ; the potential @xmath81 equals the infinite - time limit thereof , @xmath82 . thereby  @xcite",
    "v_s^(0)(r ) & = & - , + v_s^(0)(r ) & = & - ( m_r ) , where @xmath83 is the debye mass , @xmath84 , and ( x ) 2 _ 0^ .",
    "let us comment , in passing , on the existence of an imaginary part in the potential . for @xmath85 ,",
    "the real part becomes a constant , corresponding to twice the thermal heavy quark mass shift  @xcite ; in complete analogy , the imaginary part at @xmath86 equals  @xcite twice the known heavy quark width  @xcite . in some sense ,",
    "the physics of the imaginary part is also closely related to ( single ) heavy quark energy loss / drag force / diffusion coefficient , on which a lot of work has been carried out recently ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) : in fact the essential graph can be depicted in the same way ,       2ex6ex    but the integral over the spatial momentum of the gluon is weighed differently .",
    "what we really wanted to do in this section , however , was to integrate out the scale @xmath75 for @xmath76 .",
    "one possibility would now be just to expand the previous potential in @xmath87 .",
    "it is illuminating , however , to really derive the result in two separate steps , like the effective theory setup requires ; the imaginary part turns out to have an @xmath88 divergence , and it is a nice crosscheck to see that this cancels in the end  @xcite .",
    "the first step consists of the computation of the potential @xmath72 but with @xmath89 , where @xmath90 is the gluon momentum .",
    "thereby we are advised to expand the static limit of the time - ordered htl gluon propagator , i d^t_00(0,*p * ) = - i , to leading non - trivial order in @xmath91 , and the imaginary part becomes _",
    "g^2 m v_s^(0)(r ) & = & ... + ig^2 c_f m_^2 t + & = & ... + ig^2 c_f m_^2 t , where @xmath92 is the scale parameter of the @xmath93 scheme .    in the second step ,",
    "the scale @xmath75 is integrated out within the pnrqcd effective theory .",
    "the effect comes from a loop where the singlet splits into an octet and a colour - electric field .",
    "this is mediated by the vertex containing the potential @xmath67 ( which , as mentioned , equals unity at leading order ) . for the loop momenta relevant for the integration ,",
    "the octet propagator is @xmath94 , so again the static limit of the ( colour - electric ) gluon propagator is needed .",
    "this leads to _",
    "g t v_s^(0)(r ) & = & ... - ig^2 c_f m_^2 t 12 + & = & ... - ig^2 c_f m_^2 t .",
    "summing the two parts together , we arrive at  @xcite v_s^(0)(r ) & = & - + ... , + v_s^(0)(r ) & = & - ( - _ + 43 ) + ... .",
    "having integrated out all but the ultrasoft scale , let us now inspect the singlet propagator at the lowest energies .",
    "we can expect a resonance to melt once the width appearing in the propagator becomes as large as the binding energy .",
    "of course , this condition can not be posed in an exact way , and for real - world applications we would indeed be interested in computing @xmath17 in some macroscopic energy and temperature range ; nevertheless , for the purposes of this talk , we restrict to the task of estimating the melting temperature .",
    "parametrically ( omitting @xmath96 and numerical factors ) , the equality of the binding energy and width from the end of the previous section reads ~g^2",
    "t m_^2 r^2 . inserting @xmath97 and @xmath83",
    ", we get g^4 m^3 ~t^3 . for small enough @xmath2",
    "this can be solved in a leading - logarithmic approximation , yielding t ~g^43 ( ) ^-13 m .",
    "this result was first obtained ( without the logarithm ) in ref .",
    "@xcite , and it indeed lies within the range @xmath31 discussed in sec .  [ se : scales ] , as must be the case  @xcite .",
    "the main purpose of this talk has been to underline the question posed by the title . indeed",
    ", it appears that quarkonium physics at high temperatures is important enough phenomenologically to deserve some theoretically - minded consideration as well .",
    "as far as an answer to the question is concerned , we have tried to obtain one within the framework of the weak - coupling expansion . the most important point",
    "to realise is that a hierarchy can be found between the different dynamical scales affecting the problem .",
    "in fact , supplementing the discussion so far with the non - perturbative colour - magnetic scale @xmath98 , the hierarchy relevant for the melting of quarkonium can be written as m t > g^2 m > gt >",
    "g^2 t > g^4",
    "m .    furthermore ,",
    "for energies around the two - particle threshold , @xmath99 , we have argued that the way to exploit the scale hierarchy is to generalize the effective theories known as nrqcd and pnrqcd to finite temperatures  @xcite . as a result of such an analysis , it can be argued that quarkonium melts at @xmath100  @xcite .",
    "we find it comforting that the phenomenon of melting can thus be confirmed model - independently .    for practical applications of the effective theory setup , the issue of the convergence of the weak - coupling series must be addressed . for this purpose",
    ", it would be helpful to use the framework to compute higher order corrections to the quarkonium spectral function .",
    "also , the influence of the colour - magnetic scale @xmath101 needs to be estimated  @xcite .",
    "it appears reasonable to expect that as a result of such work , at least the study of the bottomonium resonance can ultimately be promoted to a quantitative level .",
    "finally , irrespective of the numerical convergence of the weak - coupling expansion , it is perhaps useful to emphasize the new qualitative features that this approach has unveiled .",
    "in particular , the fact that the real - time static potential has an unsuppressed @xmath62-dependent imaginary part at finite temperatures should in our opinion be taken into account also in phenomenological potential model studies .",
