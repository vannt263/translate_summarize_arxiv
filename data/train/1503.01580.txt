    "syntrophy plays a pivotal role in these feeding webs : degradation of compounds like propionate and phenol is only sustainable if their degradation products , hydrogen and acetate , are removed by methanogens .",
    "the thermodynamic rational behind syntrophy is well understood , but its kinetic framework is less established .",
    "this raises questions about the stability of these feeding chains and the factors that govern them . as a first step towards answering these questions a simple mathematical model",

    "mathematical analysis of the model indicated that the system was always stable : there were no conditions where the populations of the two organisms oscillate or show other forms of emergent behaviour .",
    "the objective of the present paper is to introduce an additional organism into a similar feeding chain and evaluate its effect on stability and potential emergent behaviour of the resulting ` food web ' .",
    "the organism of choice is a chlorophenol - dechlorinating bacterium .",
    "the other two organisms are a phenol degrader and a hydrogenotrophic methanogen .",
    "the complete removal of phenolic compounds from the system is hereby referred to as chlorophenol mineralisation . the salient feature of the chlorophenol degrader here is that production of phenol is coupled to consumption of hydrogen by hydrogen cycling .",
    "thus , as a hydrogen consumer , the dechlorinator competes with the methanogen for hydrogen  @xcite .",
    "the working hypotheses are ( i ) that the dechlorinator can ( partially ) replace the methanogen as the syntroph in a phenol - degrading consortium , and ( ii ) that introduction of this organism can potentially lead to unexpected emergent behaviour related to the intricacies of the multi - species relationships .",
    "it has been shown that deterministic modelling of biological systems , typically through a system of coupled ordinary differential equations ( odes ) , provides important understanding of these often complex processes , specifically in determining changes to the system behaviour given perturbations in the inputs . for anaerobic digestion ,",
    "higher dimensional models are useful for capturing the phenomenological behaviour of the multi - step processes and are often the de - facto method for understanding plant operation  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "simplified or reduced models have received more attention in process monitoring , control design  @xcite , and optimisation  @xcite .",
    "simplified models have also been applied to determine the global  @xcite or local  @xcite stability of the system under investigation .",
    "typically , these are two - species models , whereas here we present a case considering a three - species food web .    whilst a strictly analytical approach is not possible",
    "given the dimensions of the ensuing model , the approach taken here derives analytic expressions for all steady - states , supported by numerical simulations to determine the regions of local stability within sensible operating conditions . as such , it is possible to gain a formal understanding of the emergent properties of all states .",
    "the model developed here is based on anaerobic digestion model no .",

    "the general model here has six components , three substrate and three biomass variables , from which a sub - model describing phenol degradation and the extension of the full model to include addition of extraneous substrates , are formed and described in the relevant sections .",
    "the chlorophenol degrader utilises both chlorophenol and hydrogen for growth , producing phenol as a product .",
    "phenol is consumed by the phenol degrader forming hydrogen , which also is inhibitory to its growth .",
    "the methanogen scavenges this hydrogen and acts as the primary syntroph .",

    "as can be seen , four steady - states ( ss3 - 6 ) are affected by increasing concentrations of hydrogen . at very low hydrogen concentration addition ( fig .",
    "[ whydr ] ( a ) ) , ss3 is stable in the region between ( 0,0 ) and ss2 ( ss1 is not shown as it remains fixed at @xmath110 , where @xmath111 is the non - dimensionless form of @xmath78 ) .",
    "moreover , at lower dilution rates , the system has two observable bistable conditions : 1 ) between ss3 and ss6 at the lowest dilution rates ; and 2 ) between ss3 and ss4 , before ss3 becomes the single stable steady - state at higher dilution rates .",
    "this can be rationalised as follows :    * the chlorophenol degrader can outcompete the methanogen for the additional hydrogen in the system .",
    "depending on the initial biomass concentrations , this can result in complete washout of the phenol degrader and methanogen at low dilution rates .",
    "however , at higher chlorophenol concentrations , the system can be in stable equilibrium with all organisms present ; * as the dilution rate increases , the methanogen is washed from the system as the chlorophenol degrader outcompetes it to become the sole hydrogen scavenger , as seen in fig .",
    "[ sm_num ] ; * eventually at higher dilution rates , the phenol degrader is washed out and full chlorophenol mineralisation is no longer possible . nevertheless , beyond the theoretical @xmath112 , the methanogen is able to grow again ( ss2 ) , as there is a constant supply of substrate without an active competitor .    with increasing hydrogen addition interesting phenomena",
    "are observed ( fig .",
    "[ whydr ] ( b)-(d ) ) .",
    "firstly , the bistability between ss3 and ss6 is replaced by a single steady - state , in which all organisms are present .",
    "similarly , the ss3-ss4 bistability is replaced by only ss4 , although this requires greater hydrogen concentrations at higher chlorophenol input .",
    "a new steady - state also begins to emerge ( ss5 ) , starting at low chlorophenol input , which eventually subsumes the other two varying steady - states ( ss3 and ss4 ) at high hydrogen concentrations .",
    "the understanding from this is that at dilution rates higher than the upper boundary of ss6 and below the lower boundary of ss2 , the phenol degrader is naturally washed out , but the presence of increasing amounts of hydrogen allows the methanogen to exist whilst in competition with the chlorophenol degrader .",
    "most importantly , the extent of ss6 is also observed to increase below a specific @xmath6 , with the additional hydrogen resource stabilising the methanogen population at higher dilution rates , limited now only by its maximum growth rate ( @xmath113 ) . above this dilution rate , as with the three - tiered model , the production of phenol is limited by the stoichiometry of chlorophenol degradation .",
    "this restriction results in a limited supply of phenol under these operating conditions , which can not produce enough growth in the phenol degrader to sustain its population .",
    "however , the increasing abundance of additional hydrogen leads to the establishment of a two - species trophic level with no intermediary organism ( ss5 ) .",
    "nevertheless , the ability to extend the stable region of ss6 with addition of hydrogen is of note , particularly for practitioners .",
    "it has been shown that the inclusion of hydrogen addition in the three - tiered system can lead to an increase in the stable region for full chlorophenol mineralisation with regard to standard operating parameters . however",
    ", this is limited to a defined operating range . at lower @xmath6",
    "there is washout of phenol degraders and establishment of methanogens at increasing hydrogen concentrations .",
    "it appears that a form of competitive exclusion occurs at certain ( @xmath114 ) .",
    "however , unlike the classical case , here the exclusion principle dictates that consumer a ( @xmath21 ) is never excluded and either consumer b ( @xmath115 ) or producer a ( @xmath116 ) are washed from the system .",
    "this can be seen in the system simulation shown in fig .",
    "[ hydeff ] , which considers a single operational point ( @xmath117 , @xmath118 ) , with increasing @xmath8 .    at low hydrogen addition , the concentration is not enough to sustain the methanogen population whilst a small population of dechlorinators are present ( @xmath119 ) .",
    "the hydrogen not utilised by the chlorophenol degrader reaches an equilibrium that inhibits the phenol degraders and they are washed out of the system and , thus , ss3 is the dominant steady - state under these conditions for the initial conditions tested . as hydrogen addition",
    "is increased , an interesting property of the system emerges .",
    "again , the chlorophenol degrader is able to utilise the extra hydrogen to produce more biomass and more phenol . however , the concentrations of additional hydrogen are not enough to sustain the methanogen population and the equilibrium concentration returns to a value approximate to the previous case . whilst this exerts an inhibitory effect on the phenol degraders ,",
    "the additional phenol substrate availability is enough to maintain a population in the system ( steady - state not shown in fig .",
    "[ hydeff ] ) , which switches the system to ss4 . in the final case , hydrogen addition",
    "is further increased , allowing chlorophenol degraders to utilise most of the available chlorophenol and reach close to its maximum growth . as this growth is asymptotic , and",
    "because of the surplus hydrogen available , the methanogens are now able to utilise the remaining concentrations to maintain their population in the system .",
    "this results in an increased hydrogen equilibrium that exerts a greater inhibition on the phenol degraders , to such an extent that the additional phenol availability is not enough to avoid washout and the system moves to ss5 .",
    "it can be seen that this situation is fairly complex and is dependent on a number of factors .",
    "principally , the equilibrium concentration of hydrogen is determined by the dilution rate , which in turn limits the growth of either producer a or consumer b.      for such a non - linear system the addition of hydrogen could lead to deleterious and potentially unexpected behaviour , especially given its inhibitory effect on the phenol degraders .",
    "it is therefore useful to examine the effect of adding phenol to the system , both as a sole exogenous substrate , but also in combination with hydrogen addition . in this way",

    "figure  [ phvsh2 ] shows the steady - state plot for varying concentrations of hydrogen and phenol addition for two distinct operating conditions observed previously to give rise to ss6 with addition of an extraneous substrate .",
    "figure  [ phvsh2 ] ( a ) demonstrates that both hydrogen and phenol addition can transform the system from undesirable bistability to a stable process with all three organisms present .",
    "indeed , it is shown here that addition of either substrate can lead to ss6 under relatively high chlorophenol input conditions .",
    "an alternative situation under low chlorophenol addition is shown in figure  [ phvsh2 ] ( b ) . here",
    ", it is clear that phenol addition at concentrations above @xmath146 provides the necessary conditions for full chlorophenol mineralisation , irregardless of hydrogen addition .",
    "although it can also be seen that hydrogen addition does have some effect within a very small range of phenol concentration between about @xmath147 and @xmath146 , allowing for stability of the methanogenic population and moving the steady - state from ss4 to ss6 , it is relatively negligible given the influence of phenol with these operating parameters .",
    "throughout section  [ results ] , numerous regions of bistability were observed between ss3-ss4 ( fig .",
    "[ whydr ] ( a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) ) , ss3-ss6 ( fig .  [ whydr ] ( a ) and ( b ) ) and ss1-ss6 ( fig .  [ phenola ] ) . in this section , these bistable regions are investigated in order to provide a more in - depth description and understanding . through analysis of these results ,",
    "the steady - state having the larger basin of attraction is determined , i.e. the most likely outcome for a range of initial conditions .",
    "note that the other four steady - states , even when meaningless or unstable , are still present mathematically and can impact on the overall dynamics of the system .",
    "firstly , the region of bistability between ss3 and ss4 was considered .",
    "figure  [ bistability ] shows the final stable steady - states ( ss3 or ss4 ) achieved for a range of initial conditions .",
    "note that for ss3 or ss4 , @xmath148 and does not deviate from this value throughout , which simplifies the analysis required here .",
    "when @xmath21 is small , the system is likely to head towards ss3 where washout of @xmath116 occurs .",
    "otherwise , the system achieves ss4 .",
    "very similar results were obtained for biologically meaningful substrate initial conditions between @xmath149 and @xmath150 for @xmath151 , @xmath152 and @xmath153 for @xmath154 and @xmath155 and @xmath156 for @xmath157 ( @xmath158 ) .",
    "these results suggest that as long as sufficient dechlorinating biomass is present in the system , the most likely outcome is for both @xmath21 and @xmath116 to be present over time .",
    "thus , the basin of attraction for ss4 is larger than that for ss3 .",
    "in addition , changing the dilution rate @xmath9 , @xmath6 , or @xmath8 within the bistable region once again leads to similar results .    , @xmath159 , @xmath160 and @xmath161 and parameters @xmath162 and @xmath163 ( all @xmath164.,scaledwidth=48.0% ]    a similar analysis of the bistable regions for ss3-ss6 and ss1-ss6 give a more dramatic outcome .",
    "if any of the three organisms , @xmath165 , @xmath166 or @xmath167 , are initially zero , ss6 is not obtained .",
    "if all of these are present , even in tiny quantities , ss6 will be reached .",
    "it is known that ss1 is always meaningful , thus a steady - state always occurs at the origin , be it stable or unstable . in the case of bistability , ss3-ss4 or ss3-ss6 ,",
    "the unstable steady - state is closer to ss3 rather than ss4 or ss6 , respectively .",
    "this instability thus forces the dynamics away from the total washout and towards the state with the least washout .",
    "this analysis highlights how not only the main parameters of the system can impact the final stable state , but also the importance of initial conditions .",
    "in this work , a mathematical analysis of a three - tiered ` food web ' comprising three organisms with hydrogen addition and inhibition has been presented . although mechanistic models of microbial interactions are somewhat ubiquitous , analytical approaches have been limited to simple two - species systems  @xcite .",
    "more recently , attempts at analysing more complete systems , such as the anaerobic digestion process , have been performed with some degree of rigour  @xcite , however the practicality of these approaches is limited by the need for generalisation and increasing numbers of assumptions to allow for mathematical tractability .",
    "although the three - tiered system is considered only a sub - process of anaerobic digestion and the analysis limited to a specific compound , the approach is general enough to provide information about the characteristics of such a process and allows for the possibility of extending the work to other systems and other compounds .",
    "indeed the results shown here point to the fact that biological knowledge can inform mathematical approaches , whilst mathematical models can indicate or confirm biological properties of a system , succinctly and rationally .    here",
    ", four models were analysed by a combination of analytical and numerical techniques to obtain information regarding the extent and characteristics of system stability in a three - organism process anaerobically degrading chlorophenol . in this case , only the hydrogen part of the pathway was considered , with acetate being excluded from the analysis .",
    "the simple two - tiered food chain considering only phenol degradation with two species was shown to have the same characteristics observed as a previously studied system investigating propionate  @xcite ; three steady - states and always stable .",
    "a second model introduced chlorophenol as the primary substrate and a dechlorinating organism forming a tri - culture that resulted in the emergence of bistable conditions between the complete washout steady - state and the two other viable states .",
    "analysis of these bistabilities has shown that the desired operating condition ( ss6 ) has the strongest basin of attraction such that complete washout can only occur when the initial condition for one of the biomass concentrations is zero .",
    "although it is interesting to see the extent under which full chlorophenol mineralisation can occur using this standard model , of greater interest from an engineering perspective is the possibility of driving the system towards its limits of operational viability without compromising its function . with this in mind , the inclusion of additional input terms for hydrogen and phenol was undertaken , and corresponding stability analysis performed . in the case of hydrogen addition , it was expected that this would lead to a wider region of stability for the methanogen and , thus , extend the operational domain for ss6 .",
    "indeed , this was the case under relatively high concentrations of chlorophenol input , under which the methanogen population was maintained up to a theoretical maximum , dictated by its maximum growth rate .",
    "however at low chlorophenol input ( @xmath168 ) , the nature of the resource competition between the dechlorinator and methanogen is such that a switching of behaviour occurs in localities not conducive to stability of all three organisms .    under the standard three - tiered chlorophenol model",
    ", resource competition dictates that the dechlorinator is able to utilise the available hydrogen for growth more readily than the methanogen and under ss4 a competitive exclusion principle occurs and the latter is washed out . with hydrogen addition , however , an abundance of this resource allows the methanogen to access enough hydrogen to maintain a population at steady - state .",
    "however , below a threshold concentration and under specific dilution rates , an excess of hydrogen leads to inhibition of the phenol degrader and washout . in effect , the addition of hydrogen at this threshold results in a switching between ss4 and ss5 , rather than a stabilisation at ss6 .",
    "the addition of phenol , however , under specific operational conditions can result in the emergence of ss6 under low chlorophenol input conditions . here , a specific form of competition between the dechlorinator and methanogen occurs ( as with ss6 in the standard model ) ,",
    "by which both organisms benefit from the production of hydrogen by the intermediate phenol degrader , whilst the phenol degrader is stabilised by the syntrophic hydrogen removal . in other words ,",
    "the presence of the chlorophenol degrader allows for the production of phenol , which benefits both the phenol degrader and , indirectly , the methanogen .",
    "the presence of the methanogen reduces the inhibition on the phenol degrader , thus allowing the hydrogen resource to be maintained for both hydrogenotrophic populations .",
    "this can be seen as a form of mutualism rather than competition .",
    "the phenol addition plays a significant role under conditions where the chlorophenol degrader can not produce enough phenol to maintain the phenol degraders , and under such conditions it is possible to achieve full chlorophenol mineralisation beyond the standard model system .",
    "a schematic of these models and their interactions for the low chlorophenol input condition is shown in fig .",
    "[ schematic ] .",
    "although higher dimensional systems are analytically restricted and lack generality , the work reported here for a three - tiered food web underlines the potential for applying localised stability analysis within meaningful operating and parameter ranges , to identify properties of the system that both increase fundamental understanding of the behaviour of such microbial systems , but also guide thought on ways to manipulate or control them for potential process improvement .",
    "further work will include a thermodynamic rather than a kinetic inhibition term for the effect of hydrogen on the syntroph , and the extension of the model to polychlorinated phenols .",
    "this work was funded by the biotechnology and biological sciences research council uk ( bb / k003240/2 engineering synthetic microbial communities for biomethane production ) and by the institute of sustainability , newcastle university .",

    "<S> anaerobic digestion enables the water industry to treat wastewater as a resource for generating energy and recovering valuable by - products . </S>",

    "<S> however , this complexity makes it intractable to pin - point stability and emergent behaviour . here , the widely used anaerobic digestion model no . </S>",
    "<S> 1 ( adm1 ) has been reduced to its very backbone , a syntrophic two - tiered microbial ` _ _ food chain _ _ ' and a slightly more complex three - tiered microbial ` _ _ food web _ _ ' , with their stability analysed as function of the inflowing substrate concentration and dilution rate . </S>",
    "<S> parameterised for phenol and chlorophenol degradation , steady - states were always stable and non - oscillatory . </S>",
    "<S> low input concentrations of chlorophenol were sufficient to maintain chlorophenol- and phenol - degrading populations but resulted in poor conversion and a hydrogen flux that was too low to sustain hydrogenotrophic methanogens . </S>",
    "<S> the addition of hydrogen and phenol boosted the populations of all three organisms , resulting in the counterintuitive phenomena that ( i ) the phenol degraders were stimulated by adding hydrogen , even though hydrogen inhibits phenol degradation , and ( ii ) the dechlorinators indirectly benefitted from measures that stimulated their hydrogenotrophic competitors ; both phenomena hint at emergent behaviour .    </S>",
