    "the price @xmath3 is optimal here , achieving a mean revenue of @xmath4 , but it yields zero revenue with probability @xmath5 .",
    "prices lower than @xmath5 reduce the expected revenue , but increase the certainty with which positive revenue is obtained .    a systematic and standard ( cf .",
    "stiglitz and rothschild  @xcite ) way to express a bidder s trade - off between the magnitude and riskiness of revenue is to endow the seller with a concave utility function @xmath6 and seek to maximize the seller s expected utility .",

    "_    a useful byproduct of such a guarantee is that we do not need to know the seller s utility function in order to deploy the mechanism .",
    "this is useful when the auctioneer is conducting the auction on behalf of a seller ( as in the case of ebay ) , when the seller does not know its utility function precisely , or when the seller s risk attitude changes with time .",

    "lowering the price to @xmath22 improves the second seller s utility to @xmath23 , but reduces the first seller s utility from @xmath4 to @xmath23 .",

    "more precisely , for each risk - averse seller , the truthful mechanism @xmath40 that maximizes the seller s expected utility is a benchmark against which we measure our proposed mechanism ( say @xmath9)we quantify the goodness of this mechanism for this seller by the approximation ratio @xmath41 , where @xmath42 denotes the expected utility of mechanism @xmath43 .",
    "the goodness of the mechanism is then the worst - case approximation ratio over all concave utility functions , i.e. @xmath44 ; in this case , we will say that the mechanism is a universal @xmath45-approximation .",

    "many important distributions are regular and m.h.r , including uniform , exponential , normal , while other distributions such as some power - law distributions are regular but not m.h.r .",
    "@xcite .    to justify our use of the regularity assumption , the following example shows that no universal constant factor approximation is possible without assumptions on the distribution @xmath39 .",
    "recall the utility functions @xmath59 and @xmath60 defined in the introduction . define @xmath46 as @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , and let @xmath46 be linear in all four intervals between these five points ; here @xmath22 refers to the quantity in the definition of @xmath60 ( see introduction ) .",

    "consider a single bidder whose valuation function is drawn from @xmath39 , which is clearly an irregular distribution .",
    "thus to achieve a constant fraction of optimal utility for @xmath59 means that we have to sell with a probability in the range of @xmath65 $ ] , i.e. , at a price of at least @xmath5 , which implies that we get at most @xmath66 utility for @xmath60 .",
    "we first show that the virtual value based approach employed by myerson  @xcite for the risk - neutral case extends to risk - averse single - item auctions , but not ( to the best of our knowledge ) to auctions of two or more items ( see section  [ sec : benchmark ] ) .",
    "we then present three results .",
    "first , when the supply is unlimited ( or equivalently , the number of items @xmath26 is equal to the number of bidders @xmath24 ) , we identify a mechanism called the hedge mechanism that is a universal @xmath5-approximation ( see theorem  [ thm : unlimited ] ) .",
    "the ratio improves to nearly @xmath67 with the assumption that the distribution satisfies a standard hazard rate condition .",
    "the hedge mechanism is a posted - price mechanism , which offers every bidder a take - it - or - leave - it offer @xmath1 in a sequential order so long as supply lasts .",
    "we choose the price @xmath1 to be less than the optimal price for a risk - neutral seller so as to guarantee a good probability of sale to any bidder at a good revenue level .",
    "moreover , this mechanism is the best possible in the sense that no mechanism can be a universal @xmath45-approximation for @xmath68 ( see theorem  [ thm : lb ] ) .",
    "this impossibility result identifies a certain heavy - tailed regular distribution , called the left - triangle distribution that exhibits the worst - case trade - off between riskiness and magnitude of revenue over all regular distributions .",
    "second , when the supply is limited ( number of items @xmath26 is less than the number of bidders @xmath24 ) , we identify a sequential posted - price mechanism that gives a universal @xmath69-approximation by modifying the hedge mechanism to handle the supply constraint ( see theorem  [ thm : limited - regular-1 ] ) .",
    "the key to this modification is to use a certain limited supply auction to guide the choice of the posted price .",
    "third , we will show that the vcg mechanism @xcite yields a universal approximation ratio close to @xmath4 under moderate competition , i.e. , when @xmath24 is a reasonable multiple of @xmath26 ( see theorem  [ thm : vcg ] ) .",
    "recall that for a @xmath26-item auction the vcg mechanism is a @xmath70-st price auction , in which the top @xmath26 bidders win and get charged the @xmath70-st highest bid .",
    "we prove our result by establishing a probability bound for the @xmath70-st order statistic of @xmath24 i.i.d",
    ".  draws from a regular distribution .",
    "myerson  @xcite identifies the optimal single - item mechanism for a risk - neutral seller and has inspired a large body of work ( cf .",
    "chapter 13 from  @xcite ) .",
    "there is some work that deals with risk in the context of auctions .",
    "eso  @xcite identifies an optimal mechanism for a risk - averse seller , which always provides the same revenue _ at every _",
    "bid vector by modifying myerson s optimal mechanism ; unfortunately , this mechanism does not satisfy ex - post ( or even ex - interim ) individual rationality , and charges bidders even when they lose .",
    "maskin and riley  @xcite identifies the optimal bayesian - incentive compatible mechanism for a risk - neutral seller when the _ bidders _ are risk - averse . in our model , we identify mechanisms that are ex - post incentive compatible .",
    "so the buyers optimize their utility bidding truthfully for every realization of the valuations , and thus have no uncertainty or risk to deal with .",
    "hu et al .",
    "@xcite studies risk - aversion in single - item auctions .",
    "specifically , they show for both the first and second price mechanisms that the optimal reserve price reduces as the level of risk - aversion of the seller increases .",
    "in contrast , we identify the optimal truthful mechanism for a risk - averse seller in a single - item auction in section  [ sec : benchmark ] ( it happens to be a second price mechanism with a reserve ) , study auctions of two or more items and identify mechanisms that are simultaneously approximate for all risk - averse sellers .    an alternative simpler model of risk different from the one we adopt is to optimize for a trade - off between the mean and the variance of the auction revenue , i.e. , @xmath71 - t \\cdot var[r]$ ] .",
    "however , as section 2a in stiglitz and rothschild  @xcite shows , this approach does not capture all the types of behavior intuitively consistent with risk - aversion , because this approach restricts the form of seller utility functions .",
    "our model of risk - aversion is inspired in part by stiglitz and rothschild  @xcite .",
    "there is significant literature on prior - free optimal auctions ( see chapter 13 from  @xcite ) . in this framework ,",
    "the benchmark ( in the unlimited supply case , the revenue from the optimal price for that bid vector constrained to serve at least @xmath72 bidders ) is defined independently for each bid vector , and the performance of the mechanism is measured worst - case over all bid - vectors .",
    "in contrast , in our framework , as in all bayesian auction theory , the mechanism s performance is measured in expectation over the distribution of the bids . however , we believe that it is worth investigating the risk properties of the mechanisms proposed in this literature , which ought to yield universal constant factor approximations in several auction settings .    finally , we mention papers that inspire our proof techniques .",
    "chawla et al .",
    "@xcite proposes posted - price mechanisms , and it uses myerson s mechanism to guide the selection of the prices .",
    "we use a similar idea in section  [ sub : limited ] .",
    "bulow and klemperer  @xcite shows that the vcg mechanism with @xmath26 extra bidders yields better expected revenue than the optimal mechanism so long as the bidder valuations are drawn i.i.d .  from a regular distribution .",
    "dughmi et al .",
    "@xcite extends the result of bulow and klemperer  @xcite to matroid settings , and introduces the problem of designing markets with good revenue properties .",
    "we use ideas from these papers to bound the performance of the vcg mechanism in section  [ sec : vcg ] .",
    "the characterization of regular distributions in terms of concave revenue functions is implicit in myerson  @xcite , and is used explicitly in chawla et al .",
    "@xcite and dhangwatnotai et al .",
    "recall from the introduction that we would like to design mechanisms that yield a good approximation of the optimal expected utility for each concave utility function .",
    "our _ benchmark _ for a specific utility function @xmath11 is the truthful individually rational mechanism that maximizes the expected utility w.r.t .",
    "@xmath11 . in this section",
    "we focus on getting a handle on such a mechanism for a _ fixed _ utility function @xmath11 .",
    "we show that the result of myerson  @xcite can be extended to identify the optimal mechanism for the single item case , but not for auctions of two or more items . for the rest of the paper , we use the stronger simpler benchmark from fact  [ fact : upperbound ] .",
    "myerson s characterization says that the _ expected revenue _ of _ any _ truthful mechanism equals the expected total virtual valuation served by the mechanism .",
    "it generates a prescription for the allocation and payments of the optimal _ risk - neutral _ truthful mechanism on a specific input bid vector . in the single - item case , to generalize myerson s characterization to auctions with risk - averse sellers , we generalize the notion of virtual valuation to take risk - aversion into account : given a distribution @xmath39 and a concave utility function @xmath11 , we define the _ virtual utility _ function as @xmath73 . as in the case of virtual valuations ,",
    "the virtual utility @xmath74 is the derivative @xmath75 of the expected utility from a bid - independent take - it - or - leave - it offer @xmath56 to a single bidder .",
    "we then have the following :    [ lem : virtual_utility]in a single - item auction , for any mechanism @xmath76 and concave utility function @xmath11 , the expected utility of the mechanism , @xmath12 $ ] , is equal to the expected virtual valuation served @xmath77 $ ] .",
    "the expected utility of the mechanism is : @xmath78 & = & e_{\\mathbf{v}}[u(\\sum_{i}p_{i}(\\mathbf{v}))]\\\\   & = & \\sum_{i}e_{\\mathbf{v}_{-i}}[e_{v_{i}}[u(p_{i}(\\mathbf{v}))]]\\\\   & = & \\sum_{i}e_{\\mathbf{v}_{-i}}[e_{v_{i}}[\\phi_{f}^{u}(v_{i})\\cdot x_{i}(\\mathbf{v})]]\\\\   & = & e_{\\mathbf{v}}[\\sum_{i}\\phi_{f}^{u}(v_{i})\\cdot x_{i}(\\mathbf{v})]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    here the second equality holds because we sell to at most 1 bidder .",
    "the third equality holds because when @xmath79 is fixed , the mechanism induces a fixed offer price , say @xmath80 , for bidder @xmath27 . so @xmath81",
    "= u(p ' ) \\left(1-f(p ' ) \\right)$ ] , which is equal to @xmath82 , which is @xmath83 $ ] , the expected virtual utility we get from bidder @xmath27 .",
    "we can now use the lemma to show that the optimal mechanism for a seller with utility function @xmath11 is a second price auction with a reserve price  a mechanism that is well - known to be truthful . consider the second price mechanism with a reserve @xmath84 , where @xmath84 solves that @xmath85 .",
    "when the distribution is regular , the virtual utility function is nondecreasing in the valuation ( see lemma  [ lem : u - regular ] in the appendix ) .",
    "so the above mechanism allocates the item to the bidder with the highest virtual utility , so long as there is at least one bidder with non - negative virtual utility .",
    "( when the distribution is not regular , and in particular when the virtual utility function is not monotone , one can apply the ironing procedure of myerson to identify the optimal mechanism as the one that maximizes the total ironed virtual utility served . )    in section  [ sec : vcg ] we will present another application of the above characterization that shows that the single - item vickrey auction has good revenue properties",
    ". however , this characterization does not extend to auctions where more than one items are for sale .",
    "the first step of the proof of lemma  [ lem : virtual_utility ] , which sums the contributions of the bidders independently , only works because a single - item auction sells to and charges at most one bidder . when there are more than one items for sale , that step is still sound if the utility function is linear ( the risk - neutral case ) , but it does not work for strictly concave utility functions .",
    "we now identify an upper bound on the expected utility of utility - optimal mechanism that applies to auction settings beyond single - item auctions .",
    "we will use this upper bound as a benchmark for analysis . for any mechanism @xmath9 and concave utility function @xmath11 ,",
    "the expected utility of the mechanism @xmath12 $ ] is upper - bounded by the utility function applied to the expected revenue @xmath86)$ ] by jensen s inequality , which is then upper - bounded by the utility function applied to the expected revenue of myerson s revenue - optimal mechanism @xmath87 , @xmath88)$ ] , because a utility function is monotone .",
    "so we have the following :    [ fact : upperbound ] for any mechanism @xmath9 , and any concave utility function @xmath11 , the expected utility of @xmath9 is upper - bounded by the utility function applied to the expected revenue of myerson s mechanism , i.e. , @xmath12\\leq u(e_{\\mathbf{v}}[rev(mye,\\mathbf{v})])$ ] .",
    "in this section we propose sequential posted - price mechanisms ( or spm in short ) for multi - unit auctions . in an spm , a take - it - or - leave - it price is offered to each bidder one by one in arbitrary order , as long as supply lasts .",
    "an obvious advantage of such mechanisms is that they can be applied to both offline and online settings and are collusion - resistant in the sense of goldberg and hartline  @xcite .",
    "fix a regular distribution @xmath39 from which the valuations are drawn i.i.d .",
    "we now identify an spm that offers every bidder the same take - it - or - leave - it offer @xmath1 , and show that this mechanism is universally @xmath5-approximate for all regular distributions , and @xmath89-approximate for all m.h.r .  distributions .",
    "let @xmath90 is the optimal price that maximizes @xmath91 , and @xmath92 . setting the offer price @xmath1 to be @xmath90 yields the optimal expected revenue , but the probability of sale for each bidder can be very low . intriguingly , we find that reducing the offer price to @xmath93 is optimal , i.e. , the discount factor is precisely the probability of sale at the optimal price for a risk - neutral seller in a single item - single bidder auction .",
