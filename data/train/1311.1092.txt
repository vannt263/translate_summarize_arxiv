    "with the recent discovery @xcite of a new resonance with properties similar to the standard model ( sm ) higgs particle , one of the greater concerns when studying the ultraviolet ( uv ) behavior of the sm has become whether or not its ground state is stable all the way to the planck scale @xcite .",
    "if unstable this might indicate the need for new physics to occur to stabilize the theory . at the planck scale and beyond unknown gravity corrections could ensure the stability of the theory at those energies .",
    "indeed , it was proposed in @xcite that gravity can be directly responsible for a vanishing quartic higgs coupling at the planck scale .",
    "this uv constraint leads to the prediction for the higgs mass of about @xmath2 gev .",
    "however with the recent higher loop refinements of the high energy behavior of the sm potential it is clear that the higgs quartic coupling does not stay positive till the planck scale .",
    "instead the potential develops a second minimum at high field values , making the electroweak vacuum , at best , metastable @xcite .",
    "these findings do not automatically imply that the sm holds an inconsistency by itself , but this behavior is not in line with the asymptotically safe gravity scenario .",
    "in addition , the sm is already known to be incomplete and it is now particularly timely to investigate minimal extensions of the sm featuring new sectors , possibly relevant for the dark matter problem . here",
    "we investigate dark matter motivated extensions @xcite of the sm , where dark matter is magnetically interacting . here , for the first time we investigate their possible simultaneous ability to save the electroweak vacuum from being metastable , provide a dark matter candidate , and their compatibility with the asymptotically safe gravity framework @xcite .",
    "the new sector consists of a vectorlike heavy electron ( @xmath3 ) , a complex heavy scalar electron ( @xmath4 ) and a sm singlet dirac fermion ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "the associated renormalizable lagrangian is @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the sm higgs doublet and @xmath8 , with @xmath9 the hypercharge coupling and @xmath10 denoting the hypercharge of @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "we assume the new couplings @xmath11 and @xmath12 to be real and the bare mass squared of the @xmath4 field , @xmath13 , to be positive so that electroweak symmetry breaks via the higgs doublet .",
    "the interactions among @xmath5 , our potential magnetic dark matter candidate , and the sm fields occur via loop - induced processes involving the @xmath14-operator .",
    "the scalar electron @xmath4 has properties reminiscent of a selectron except that it is vectorlike , and therefore only the scalar field @xmath4 feels the higgs directly .",
    "this is true provided we do not mix the new electron with the sm leptons via generalized yukawa interactions . due to this property and the requirement of the renormalizability of the theory ,",
    "the @xmath4 sector is a portal sector and can be probed directly using processes involving the higgs .",
    "the phenomenological signatures of this model were studied in ref .",
    "@xcite , where it was constructed in the search for a theory that is able to alleviate the tension between the different direct - detection dark matter searches @xcite .",
    "this model , without the explicit mass parameters , was also recently considered as a _ perturbatively natural conformal _ extension of the sm @xcite , where electroweak symmetry breaking is generated via the coleman - weinberg mechanism without any quadratic divergences to the perturbative order considered .",
    "this scenario , in fact , predicts the mass of @xmath4 to be around @xmath15   gev , close to the benchmark value used in @xcite .",
    "a more detailed analysis of the dark matter properties and constraints of these theories appeared in @xcite .",
    "here it was shown that the basic model is constrained dominantly by direct detection experiments and its parameter space can be nearly entirely covered by up - coming ton - scale direct detection experiments .",
    "it is clear that adding the vacuum stability analysis and the interplay with gravitational interactions allows us to get one step closer to a more complete extension of the sm .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in section [ rg ]",
    "we show that it is possible to achieve electroweak vacuum stability . here",
    "we also determine the regions , in coupling space , of instability , metastability and stability of the theory .",
    "we study the gravitational transition in section [ uvcompletion ] by adding at the expected gravitational corrections to the beta functions of the theory .",
    "due of the nature of these corrections the scalar couplings and their beta functions are expected to vanish at the transition scale , in absence of the gravitational corrections .",
    "we show that it is possible to abide to these conditions , but that generally they tend to bring these extensions towards the region of metastability .",
    "we offer our conclusions in section [ conclusions ] .",
    "we will first investigate the sm vacuum stability and finiteness of the running couplings as functions of the renormalization group ( rg ) energy scale @xmath16 .",
    "this will give us a better understanding of the uv behaviour of the sm under the influence of the dark sector .",
    "the following set of couplings are relevant to consider : the gauge couplings @xmath17 and @xmath18 , associated to the @xmath19 and @xmath20 gauge symmetry respectively , as well as the top yukawa coupling @xmath21 , the yukawa coupling of the dark sector @xmath22 , and the three quartic couplings @xmath23 , and @xmath24 .    without gravitational corrections , i.e. in the low - energy region , their respective beta functions",

    "perturbative couplings of the new sector are compatible with the phenomenological constraints presented in @xcite , and therefore this set of beta functions can be applied around the fermi scale .",
    "we will assume , that the dm candidate @xmath5 has a mass around @xmath26 gev , and that the mass of the scalar and vector like electron have masses @xmath27 gev .",
    "due to the decoupling theorem , the sm couplings will run as in the sm , until the mass scale @xmath28 of the new scalar @xmath4 ( and electron @xmath3 ) is reached .",
    "to lowest order in perturbation theory , there is no threshold effects on the couplings at this scale , since the vacuum expectation value of @xmath4 is at the origin . beyond the @xmath28",
    "scale the running couplings are influenced by the new sector .",
    "in particular , at one loop , the beta function for the @xmath29 gauge coupling , @xmath9 , is modified since the new scalar @xmath4 appeaars in the loop corrections to the @xmath9 coupling , and the beta function for the higgs self - coupling @xmath30 receives corrections from the portal coupling , @xmath31 . defining values of @xmath24 , @xmath31 and @xmath22 at the @xmath28 scale as well as choosing a value for the hypercharge @xmath10 ,",
    "will then uniquely dictate the evolution of the theory , at least until gravitational corrections should be taken into account .    in order to constrain the parameter space of the theory",
    ", we will look for fixed point structures in the new sector . upon inspection of and",
    ", we find that the ratio @xmath32 has an _ approximate _ ir fixed point , which reads : @xmath33 assuming that @xmath34 reaches small values in the ir of order @xmath9 ( i.e. at the @xmath28 scale ) , we can expect that the ratio of these couplings in the ir is close to this value .",
    "we impose this assumption in our analysis to determine @xmath35 from @xmath36 .",
    "furthermore , the beta function of @xmath24 in eq .",
    "is , except a pure @xmath37 term , only dependent on the couplings @xmath24 and @xmath22 , when replacing @xmath9 with the above constraint .",
    "there is a fixed point in @xmath24 , which we can express in terms of the ratio @xmath38 after replacing @xmath9 , reminiscent of the quartic - gauge approximate fixed point of the sm .",
    "if @xmath31 at low energies is of the order of @xmath39 and we keep @xmath40 , then after having defined @xmath41 we have : @xmath42 the leading estimate varies between 0.42 and 0.32 for any value of @xmath10 .",
    "thus , as before , by assuming @xmath24 to reach small values in the ir of order @xmath43 , we can expect this ratio to be fulfilled at the @xmath28 scale .",
    "we impose also this assumption to simplify the rg analysis .",
    "the remaining parameters of the model that needs to be specified are @xmath10 and @xmath44 . in the analysis below",
    "we require absolute stability of the electroweak vacuum at least up to the planck scale .",
    "thus , for a specific value of @xmath10 we analyze the running couplings and the effective potential , and set a lower limit on @xmath44 that ensures absolute stability .",
    "* we deduce from eq .   and that @xmath45 , and @xmath46 up to corrections from @xmath31",
    ". the smallest value for @xmath31 that ensures stability of the electroweak vacuum is @xmath47 .",
    "a nonzero value of @xmath31 leads , in the full analysis , to a slightly smaller @xmath48 .",
    "the running couplings are shown in figure [ fig : ir_qd1 ] .",
    "the quartic couplings run to large values around the planck scale .",
    "thus the lower boundary on the coupling @xmath31 corresponds to a landau pole close to the planck scale . for higher values of @xmath31 the landau pole",
    "is shifted toward lower energy scales .",
    "* we have @xmath49 and the lower boundary on @xmath31 is slightly lowered ; with @xmath50 . the landau pole ,",
    "however , is also lowered to around the value @xmath51  gev .",
    "for even higher values of @xmath10 this trend continues and the value of @xmath52 quickly becomes non - perturbative . *",
    "i.e. for millicharged dark scalar and electron , the trend goes in the opposite direction ; the lower bound becomes @xmath53 with @xmath54 and @xmath55 and the landau pole moves beyond the planck scale .    ,",

    "the electroweak vacuum is not stable if the higgs self - coupling @xmath30 runs to negative values .",
    "we can , however , distinguish metastability from instability .",
    "this is done by considering the probability of tunneling to the true vacuum during the evolution of the universe .",

    "the literature on the subject is vast and we refer to @xcite for a review . to determine the gravitational corrections we follow @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the authors in @xcite noticed an intriguing feature of the sm when assuming the electroweak vacuum to be the true vacuum ; i.e. they showed that a lower bound on the higgs mass consistent with asymptotic safe gravity is @xmath70  gev .",
    "these results seem to imply that the electroweak scale is somehow determined by planck scale physics .    here",
    "we test whether this picture survives , when including the effects of the candidate dark @xmath71 sector . denoting collectively the set of dimensionless couplings by @xmath72 it follows from pure dimensional grounds that the gravitational contribution , @xmath73 , to the beta function of @xmath72 reads :",

    "the full one loop beta functions for the couplings @xmath72 thus read : @xmath81    the corrections to the beta functions from gravity are negligible until we reach @xmath82 .",

    "<S> we investigate the vacuum stability as well as the gravitational corrections in extensions of the standard model featuring a new complex scalar , and two dirac fermions for different choices of the hypercharge of the scalar and one of the two fermions . </S>",
    "<S> the neutral fermion acquires loop - induced magnetic interactions with the standard model and could be identified with a dark matter candidate . to the lowest order in perturbation theory </S>",
    "<S> we show that these extensions can save the electroweak vacuum from being metastable . </S>",
    "<S> we then add the gravitational corrections to the different beta functions and discover that the models can be compatible with the asymptotically safe gravity scenario at the price of a heavier higgs and lighter top mass . </S>",
