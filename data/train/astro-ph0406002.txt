    "it is generally believed that the dwarf galaxies we observe in the local universe are survivors of the hierarchical growth of massive galaxies .",
    "while present - day dwarf galaxies may somehow be different from the majority of proto - galactic fragments which coalesced into larger objects , the formation of stars in the smallest survivors are an important test of our understanding of galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "if star - formation quickly follows the gravitational collapse of the initial density perturbations in the early universe , we might expect the stars in dwarf galaxies to be quite old because their halos should be among the first objects to form .",
    "dwarfs in large - scale over - densities destined to become clusters and groups should collapse and form stars at earlier times than galaxies formed in under - dense regions ( tully et al .",
    "2002 ) . yet",
    "star - formation must not proceed too quickly , otherwise the baryons in the universe would become locked up in stellar remnants , leaving no fuel for the star - formation we see locally ( e.g. kauffmann , white , & guiderdoni 1993 ) .",
    "dwarf elliptical galaxies ( and their low - mass local group analogues , dwarf spheroidals or dsphs ) are an obvious place to look for ancient stars and to track early star - formation .",
    "dsphs and des in the local group are almost completely free of gas and typically dominated by stars older than several billion years .",
    "these objects range from des with @xmath5 and total masses @xmath6 down to dsphs with @xmath7 and total masses @xmath8 . while the smallest dsphs have masses and luminosities comparable to massive star clusters , they are physically different entities .",
    "dwarf galaxies sit inside the gravitational potential wells of dark matter halos , and the kinematics of their stars are increasingly dominated by this underlying dark matter halo ( e.g. aaronson 1983 ; but see geha , guthathakurta , & van der marel 2002 ) , whereas star clusters do not have associated dark matter halos ( pryor et al .",
    "1989 ; moore 1996 ) .",
    "massive globular clusters are compact , high - surface brightness objects , while de / dsphs are diffuse and extended with decreasing surface - brightnesses with decreasing luminosities ( kormendy 1985 ) .",
    "most star clusters consist of a single population of stars with uniform age and chemical composition . on the other hand , studies of the color - magnitude diagrams and spectroscopic abundances of individual stars in local group",
    "des / dsphs show surprisingly complex star - formation and chemical enrichment histories in even the faintest galaxies ( e.g. carigi , hernandez , & gilmore 2002 ; grebel 1997 ; smecker - hane et al .",
    "1994 ) .",
    "the complex star - formation histories of the nearest des / dsphs are probably regulated by a number of mechanisms . because of their low masses and shallow gravitational potential wells , dwarf galaxies are potentially fragile systems .",
    "the radiation , stellar winds , and supernovae produced by the first generations of stars can photo - dissociate , shock - heat , and expel much of the remaining gas , thereby suppressing future star - formation .",
    "dekel and silk ( 1986 ) and later work by dekel & woo ( 2003 ) showed that the onset of supernovae - driven winds could explain the observed scaling relations of metallicity and mass - to - light ratio with total luminosity for galaxies less massive than @xmath9 .",
    "external heating by the high background of ultraviolet photons prevalent at early times in the universe ( the epoch of re - ionization ) can photo - ionize and even photo - evaporate small gaseous halos and prevent star - formation altogether ( efstathiou 1992 ; babul & rees 1992 ; bullock , kravtsov , & weinberg 2000 ) . dwarf halos with virial velocities @xmath10 km s@xmath11 which collapse after re - ionization may never accrete gas or form stars and remain dark ( bullock et al . 2000 ) , while more massive halos and those which collapse prior to re - ionization in over - dense regions may produce some stars , albeit very inefficiently ( dong , murray , & lin 2003 ) .",
    "dwarf halos may also be rejuvenated by accreting new gas and/or cooling sufficiently to form stars after the uv - background has sufficiently cooled at @xmath12 ( babul & rees 1992 , efstathiou 1992 ) .",
    "finally , star - formation in dwarf galaxies may be strongly dependent on their environments and interactions with other galaxies .",
    "des are found exclusively as the satellites of massive galaxies or in rich clusters of galaxies .",
    "the rich cluster environment can ram - pressure strip accreted field dwarfs of their gas ( lin & faber 1983 ) and transform or tidally destroy dwarfs via multiple encounters with more massive galaxies ( moore , lake , & katz 1998 ; kravtsov , gnedin , & klypin 2004 ) .",
    "disentangling the effects of these different processes on the evolution of des is challenging . in the local group",
    ", we have the advantage of proximity and can resolve the stars in @xmath13 des / dsphs .",
    "the color - magnitude diagrams and spectroscopic abundances of these stars can then be used to trace the star - formation and chemical enrichment histories of the dsph ( eg .",
    "grebel 1997 ) .",
    "in the virgo and fornax clusters are thousands of des , but because of their distances , current ( largely ground - based ) studies of these objects have been limited to the integrated colors and spectra . in this study of leo , virgo and fornax cluster des , we still can not examine the properties of their individual stars . however , with hst resolution , we can distinguish their bright star clusters and nuclei from the stellar envelopes of field stars and use the colors of these three sub - populations to constrain the evolution of cluster des .",

    "high - resolution numerical simulations of the collapse of dwarf - sized @xmath17 dark matter halos predict the formation of dense @xmath18 star clusters within dwarf halos at redshifts greater than 10 ( bromm & clarke 2002 ) .",
    "however , the origin of metal - poor globular clusters as `` pre - galactic '' ( peebles & dicke 1968 ; burgarella et al . 2001 ; beasley et al . 2003 ) or associated with galaxy formation and assembly ( searle & zinn 1978 ; cote et al .",

    "the nature and formation of the de nuclei are poorly understood .",
    "the fraction of nucleated virgo des increases with both de luminosity ( binggeli & cameron 1991 ) and position within the cluster ( ferguson & sandage 1989 ) .",
    "in dense environments such as the centers of clusters of galaxies , the pressure from the surrounding inter - galactic medium may allow dwarf galaxies to retain their gas during star formation and produce multiple generations of stars ( babul & rees 1992 ) , forming nuclei in the process .",
    "spectroscopy of several bright fornax de nuclei show balmer lines stronger than the metal - rich globular cluster 47 tuc ( held & mould 1994 ; brodie & huchra 1990 ) , and ngc 205 s nucleus is very blue and has strong balmer line absorption ( jones et al . 1996",

    "these examples suggest that the stars in many de nuclei may have formed quite recently . however , sagittarius s probable nucleus is the massive , old , and metal - poor globular cluster m54 ( sarajedini & layden 1995 ) . the expected dynamical friction timescales for massive globular clusters in the low - density des is quite short , therefore many nuclei could simply be bright clusters that have spiraled into the center ( lotz et al .",
    "2001 ; oh & lin 2000 ; hernandez & gilmore 1998 ) , and contain predominately old and metal - poor stars .    the integrated colors and spectral features of the field stars in nearby cluster des are consistent with the intermediate and old mean ages ( @xmath19 gyr ) and intermediate metallicities ( @xmath20 [ fe / h ] @xmath21 0 ) derived for most local group de / dsphs ( e.g. rakos et al .",

    "1997 for discussion of globular cluster candidate color and size selection ) .",
    "compact background galaxies and foreground stars within our color criteria may be mistaken for globular cluster candidates , and there may exist intergalactic globular clusters which are not bound to the des .",
    "we must correct for this contamination when estimating the number of globular clusters associated with each de and examining their colors .",
    "in tables [ nde_tab ] and [ nonde_tab ] , we have assumed that objects meeting our candidate criteria on wf chips 2 and 4 and outside of an elliptical aperture centered on the de with semi - major axis length equal to 5 times the de s exponential scalelength are background contaminants ( figure [ vcc940 ] ) .",

    "the hst snapshot observations are not well suited to measuring the total galaxy luminosities .",

    "for these two galaxies , we masked out the nuclei and re - measured the stellar envelope color .",
    "we found no change in the color of fcc46 , while vcc1254 became 0.05 magnitudes redder .",
    "given that the errors on the galaxy colors are @xmath46 , we expect that the rest of the nuclei will have a negligible effect on the de halo colors .",
    "the measured galaxy colors were transformed to the johnson - cousins photometric system using the same equations as the globular clusters ( holtzman et al .",

    "we generally find less than 20 gccs above the background counts for each de ( tables [ nde_tab ] and [ nonde_tab ] ) . because of the relatively high fraction of background contamination ( @xmath51 ) , determining the mean color and the color distribution for each de globular cluster system is impossible without spectroscopic confirmation of the globular cluster candidates .",
    "instead , we have constructed _ composite _ cluster color distributions for all the des within a given absolute magnitude range . by binning the globular cluster candidates by host galaxy luminosity",

    "a @xmath0 color histogram is created for all of the gccs for the des within a luminosity range and normalized to the total area of the galaxies sampled ( left of figure [ vihist ] ) .",

    "we detect very few globular cluster candidates bluer than @xmath52 .",

    "we have compared the faint ( @xmath88 ) nuclei colors to those of the de globular cluster candidates with the same range of absolute magnitudes .",
    "we find no color difference between the de nuclei and globular clusters at fixed nucleus / cluster luminosity , suggesting that the faint nuclei are indistinguishable from bright globular clusters .",

    "the integrated @xmath0 color of a stellar population is primarily a function of the temperature of the stellar population s red - giant branch , which becomes hotter and bluer with younger ages as well as lower metallicities . therefore with a single optical color , it is impossible to distinguish between a young , metal - rich stellar population and an old , metal - poor stellar population",
    ". nevertheless , we attempt to place some reasonable constraints on the relative ages and metallicities for the de stellar populations given the observed @xmath0 and what we know about local de / dsph systems . using the bruzual & charlot ( 2003 ) population synthesis models for a single starburst with a salpeter stellar initial mass function and the padova 1994 isochrones , we have plotted the range of possible ages and metallicities for the de stellar halos ( @xmath90 ) and de globular clusters ( @xmath91 ) in figure [ mods ] . in these plots ,",
    "the dashed lines are lines of constant @xmath0 color , and the shaded regions show the range of observed colors and possible ages and metallicities for each de stellar population .",

    "2003 ; see also table 5 ) .",
    "the bluer colors of the globular clusters ( and nuclei ) give much weaker constraints , but are consistent with [ fe / h ] @xmath94 observed for old dsph gcs ( table 5 ) . the bruzual & charlot ( 2003 ) tracks for the colors of the gcs in the faintest des ( @xmath95 ) imply that these clusters are younger than 8 gyr .",
    "( however , the older bruzual & charlot models allow for ages greater than 8 gyr if [ fe / h ] @xmath96 and @xmath97 . also , several milky way globular clusters have integrated @xmath95 , @xmath98[fe / h ] @xmath99 , and ages @xmath100 gyr . )",
    "the model tracks also require that the two nuclei with @xmath83 are younger than 1 gyr .",
    "the color offset between the de stellar halos and their globular cluster systems requires that the bulk of the de field stars are either significantly more metal - rich or older than their globular clusters .",
    "if the de globular cluster systems were bluer because they were several gyr younger than the de field stars , one may expect them to be @xmath101 magnitudes brighter than old milky way globular clusters of the same mass and color .",
    "however , initial estimates of the composite de globular cluster luminosity function ( gclf ) indicate that its characteristic luminosity is identical to that of the milky way ( @xmath102 ; miller 2003 ) . given that local group de / dsph globular clusters systems are more metal - poor than their hosts field stars and that the de gclf is indistinguishable from that of the milky way , we will assume that our sample of de gcs is dominated by old and metal - poor globular clusters for the rest of this discussion .",
    "this implies either separate star - formation epochs for the de gcs and field stars , or a strong metallicity gradient for de stars with the destruction of the inner and more metal - rich clusters and the inward migration of the outer , more metal - poor clusters .",
    "most de nuclei span a similar color range as the de gcs , and therefore could be coeval with the de gcs .",

    ", we discuss the possible formation histories of these three de sub - populations ( clusters , field stars , and nuclei ) and the constraints on the evolution of the des .      the observed correlations between de gc colors and host de luminosities is strong evidence that the gcs knew about the gravitational potentials of their host des during their formation and were not accreted by the des at a later time .",
    "this rules out a primordial or pre - galactic origin for the globular clusters in des ( peebles & dicke 1968 ) . if the majority of the de globular clusters are old and roughly coeval , the observed mean gcs color- host galaxy luminosity relation suggests a mean gcs metallicity - host galaxy luminosity correlation of @xmath103 assuming the @xmath104 [ fe / h ] calibration of kissler - patig et al .",

    ", the observed increasing color dispersion also implies an increasing dispersion in metallicity .",
    "the simple model of galactic chemical evolution is the zeroth order model against which to compare the metallicity ( and color ) distribution of a stellar population ( tinsley 1975 ) , or , because each globular cluster is a chemically homogeneous population , the metallicity distribution of a system of globular clusters .",
    "the simple model assumes that 1 ) the galaxy is a `` closed box '' with no inflow or outflow of gas ; 2 ) the metals are well mixed ; 3 ) the galaxy is initially pure gas with primordial abundances ; and 4 ) the nucleo - synthetic yields of stars are constant for `` primary elements '' ( elements created directly from hydrogen and helium ) . the metallicity distribution of stars @xmath107 for a simple model is @xmath108 where @xmath109 and @xmath110 is the effective chemical yield .",
    "in figure [ simple ] , we have fit simple model metallicity distributions to the @xmath0 color distributions , again assuming the kissler - patig et al .",
    "( 1998 ) color - metallicity calibration .",
    "( strictly speaking , the simple model distribution applies only to primary elements which follow the instantaneous recycling approximation , but may be applied to iron ( fe ) if we assume the ratio of primary elements to fe is constant ) .",
    "the background - corrected gc color distributions for the entire sample of de gcc are well - fit by the simple model , as are the gcc distributions for des brighter than @xmath111 , with effective yields @xmath112 ( @xmath113 ) the simple model does poorly for fainter des ( @xmath114 ) , although the numbers are small .",
    "the comparison of the implied metallicity distributions of the de globular cluster systems to simple closed - box chemical evolution models suggests that a significant amount of metals is lost or unavailable for star - formation during the period of globular cluster formation . in closed systems ,",
    "the effective yield is expected to reach the true chemical yield of supernovae .",
    "the low effective yield may be the result of a homogeneous wind , where gas and metals are lost proportionally to the star formation rate ( hartwick 1976 ) .",
    "fainter , less massive des would be more likely to experience a terminal wind in which all of the galaxy s gas is expelled at a particular time ( for example , via supernovae `` blow - out '' ; arimoto & yoshii 1987 ) , and results in a sharp cutoff at higher cluster metallicities .",
    "for such cases where the gas is removed on very short timescales , the steep metallicity - luminosity scaling relation observed for the stellar halos of local group dsphs is expected ( @xmath77 ; dekel & silk 1986 ) .",
    "we are unable to conclusively determine whether the field star colors of our des are more consistent with a @xmath77 and @xmath115 correlation because of the large scatter in the de color - magnitude relation .    if the implied correlation between globular cluster metallicity and de host galaxy luminosity is confirmed by more reliable metallicity estimates , and if the metallicity- luminosity relation of the de field stars is like that of the local group des / dsphs , then the gas heating mechanism or timescales regulating the chemical evolution of de globular clusters must be markedly different from that regulating the chemical evolution of de field stars .",
    "we note that for slower adiabatic winds where the gas is removed on timescales comparable to the crossing time of the system , a metallicity - host galaxy luminosity scaling relation similar to that observed for the globular cluster systems is derived ( @xmath116 ; dekel & silk 1986 ) .",
    "the gc formation model of kravtsov & gnedin ( 2003 ) , which predicts too strong of a gc metallicity - host galaxy luminosity relationship , produces gcs during and after re - ionization in relatively massive halos ( @xmath117 ) .",
    "smaller halos , however , may be unable to efficiently cool and form the dense molecular clouds needed for gc production after re - ionization and/or the on - set of supernovae - driven winds .",
    "gc formation in dwarfs prior to re - ionization would not be subject to the heating effects of a high uv - background , and therefore dwarf halos may initially lose metals more gradually than at later times .",
    "it is impossible to determine from the @xmath0 colors alone if de globular clusters were formed before or after the epoch of re - ionization .",
    "globular clusters formed before re - ionization at redshifts @xmath118 would be @xmath119 gyr old , while clusters formed after the inter - galactic uv background had cooled at redshift @xmath85 would be @xmath120 8 gyr old . one possible way to distinguish between these two formation epochs is to examine the chemical abundance patterns in de globular clusters .",
    "globular clusters do not have primordial abundances , therefore at least some stars must have formed and enriched the gas in des before the globular clusters were produced .",
    "chemical enrichment of the stellar halo would happen quite quickly , as massive stars have lifetimes less than @xmath121 years .",
    "assuming stars in the early universe evolve with the same timescales and nuclear processes as stars formed at later times ( qian & wassberburg 2002 ) , stars in des formed before the epoch of re - ionization would show enrichment patterns enhanced in @xmath22 elements ( relative to the sun ) created by massive , short - lived stars , as there would not be enough time prior to re - ionization for lower mass , primarily iron - producing stars to enrich the interstellar medium .",
    "the @xmath22-element abundance ratios of de globular clusters are unknown , but spectroscopic observations of a small number of des suggest that their field stars are _ not _ alpha - element enhanced ( thomas et al .",
    "2003 ; geha et al .",
    "2003 ) , and therefore the majority of de stars did not form prior to re - ionization .",
    "another possibility is that the de field stars and globular clusters did not form in separate events , but rather a combination of strong metallicity gradients in the globular cluster populations and the preferential destruction of clusters with higher metallicities has produced the metallicity offset observed today .",
    "this might arise naturally if inner , more metal - rich clusters were destroyed via disk - shocking or dynamical decay into the de centers , while outer , more metal - poor clusters migrated inwards . however , destruction of more metal - rich clusters via dynamical friction would produce de nuclei with colors more like the de field stars , which is not observed .",
    "also , there is little evidence for strong metallicity gradients between the inner and outer regions of de . most de",
    "show either no color gradients or bluer centers ( stiavelli et al . 2001 ; jerjen , binggeli , & freeman 2000 ) .",
    "spectroscopic estimates of any abundance gradients in the de field star populations as well as the @xmath22-element ratios of de gcs would help resolve this issue .",
    "the @xmath0 colors of the des are @xmath4 magnitudes redder than their globular clusters , and therefore the majority of the de field stars probably did not form in the same event as their globular clusters",
    ". the majority of de stars can not be the remnants of a disrupted gc population ( fall & rees 1977 ) , nor were the virgo and fornax de stellar populations formed in a single starburst ( e.g. dekel & silk 1986 ) .",
    "given the ages and metallicities derived for nearby dsphs / des and their gcs , it is most likely that the de stars are more metal - rich , and possibly several gyr younger than their gcs .",
    "an offset in metallicity suggests that the bulk of de stars were formed after a period of ism chemical enrichment , perhaps by the massive stars in the gcs .",
    "the initial epoch of globular cluster formation must have input a significant amount of energy into the dwarf s remaining gas in the form of uv radiation and supernovae - driven winds , as would background uv radiation during the epoch of re - ionization ( e.g. babul & rees 1992 , efstathiou 1992 ) .",
    "while the feedback from young clusters and a strong uv - background could have halted star - formation temporarily , it must not have been enough to completely `` blow - away '' or `` photo - evaporate '' the remaining gas , and therefore later generations of stars could have formed in the halo once the gas had cooled sufficiently .",
    "the observed solar and sub - solar @xmath22-element ratios in the de stellar halos ( geha et al .",
    "2003 ; thomas et al .",
    "2003 ) require field star - formation during or after a period of extended chemical enrichment , implying either a @xmath16 1 gyr age difference between the de field stars and their gcs or a @xmath16 1 gyr age spread in the de field stars . as we discussed above",
    ", the difference between the metallicity - host galaxy luminosity relations observed for the de gcs and field stars suggests that different mechanisms regulated the chemical enrichment during each star - formation episode . later star - formation events must have been much less efficient at forming massive , tightly bound gcs which could survive to present - day .",
    "( only a few intermediate - age gcs have been found in local group dsph ; van den bergh 2000 . )",
    "the different star - formation regulating mechanisms may have also lowered the star - formation efficiency below that required to create gravitationally - bound clusters ( kroupa et al .",

    "we find evidence for a marginally significant color - luminosity trend in the de , n that is not detected in des without nuclei .",

    "the nuclei of des are significantly bluer than their associated stellar halos , unlike the nuclei and bulges of spirals and giant ellipticals .",
    "the nuclei have colors similar to the globular cluster systems and are as compact as the globular cluster candidates .",

    "2001 , oh & lin 2001 , hernandez & gilmore 1998 ) . both nuclear formation scenarios are consistent with the correlations of nuclear color and luminosity with host galaxy luminosity .",
    "brighter des have deeper central potential wells , and thus would be better able to accrete and retain gas to form brighter and more metal - rich nuclei .",
    "brighter des also have redder and larger globular cluster populations from which their nuclei could coalesce .",
    "two des possess very blue nuclei which require ages @xmath122  gyr , as does ngc 205 , a de satellite of m31 ( jones et al .",
    "if many nuclei are relatively young compared to typical globular clusters , they could trace a third star - formation episode , after both the globular cluster and de halo formation events .",
    "the trend of bluer nuclei in fainter de hosts might then imply that the nuclei in fainter des are typically younger than the nuclei in brighter des .",
    "however , the two very blue nuclei are in des brighter than @xmath123 .",
    "spectroscopic line indices are needed to place stronger constraints on the ages , metallicities , and formation scenarios for the de nuclei .",

    "this is contrary to the igm pressure - induced star - formation model of babul & rees ( 1992 ) , which predicts that nuclei formed in the densest regions of the cluster undergo the most intense and rapid starbursts and should be significantly older , more metal - rich and redder than de nuclei formed in the outskirts of the cluster .",
    "this also contradicts the infall model for de formation , in which nucleated des are the stripped remnants of disk galaxies that experience a central starburst upon accretion ( moore , lake , & katz 1998 ) .",
    "conversely , the nuclei are typically bluer and fainter than the ultra - compact galaxies observed in the fornax cluster with @xmath124 ( karrick et al .",
