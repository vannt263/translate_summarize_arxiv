    "the equation of state ( eos ) , which gives the density dependence of the binding energy per nucleon for a given nucleus , has been one of the most importance issues in nuclear many - body problems . there is a great amount of different theoretical approaches in trying to describe the eos and , clearly , we can mention only some of few representatives  @xcite . in general , those approaches and corresponding representatives",
    "can be classified into three classes as microscopic many - body approaches  @xcite , effective field theories  @xcite , and phenomenological methods  @xcite .",
    "these works for many - body problems provide very useful tools for understanding properties of dense and hot matter .",
    "on the other hand , the skyrme model  @xcite also presents a simple but good framework for investigating bulk properties of nuclear matter . in general , one can classify various skyrmion approaches into two subclasses : in the first one investigations are mainly devoted to the classical crystalline structure and its behavior under the extreme conditions  @xcite . in the second approach the properties of exotic many - baryon systems were treated  @xcite .",
    "there are also some early attempts to explain many - body systems within the skyrme model  @xcite , considering the single skyrmion in hypersphere .",
    "moreover , there is an another alternative way to examine properties of nuclear matter within the skyrme model , i.e. to study the properties of the single skyrmion in nuclear matter  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the medium - modified skyrme model  @xcite , in connection with quantum - mechanical variational methods  @xcite ( like the hartree - fock method ) , can be applied to the analysis of the bulk properties of nuclear matter  @xcite . to perform this analysis , it is essential to know the properties of the single hadron and the @xmath0 interaction in a symmetric  @xcite as well as asymmetric  @xcite ) nuclear environment .",
    "consequently , the behavior of the hadrons in nuclear medium must be taken into account .",
    "however , the variational calculations can only estimate the upper boundary value of minimized quantities .",
    "thus , one may still consider how to improve the results .    as a more realistic approach",
    ", the in - medium modified skyrme model  @xcite itself can be used so as to reproduce the properties of the single hadron in nuclear matter as well as those of matter in bulk .",
    "this is the aim of the present work . to carry out the proposed goal , we consider not only the changes of the kinetic and mass terms of the standard skyrme lagrangian as done in ref .",
    "@xcite but also possible modifications of the skyrme term .",
    "it is well known that skyrme s quartic stabilizing term may be related to vector mesons  @xcite that can be realized in implicit gauge symmetry of the nonlinear sigma model lagrangian  @xcite . in this sense",
    ", the modification of the skyrme parameter may be pertinent to the changes of the vector mesons in nuclear matter .",
    "the present work is organized as follows : in the next section , we explain how the original skyrme model can be modified in medium . in section iii , we present the corresponding numerical results and discuss them .",
    "in particular , we show that the quartic skyrme term can be modified in such a way that it minimizes the binding energy per nucleon .",
    "we discuss the changes of the mass splitting of the nucleon and the @xmath1 isobar and those of the @xmath2 coupling constant .",
    "we also estimate the symmetry energy in the weizscker - bethe - bacher formula .",
    "the last section is devoted to summary and outlook of this work .",
    "@xcite , the in - medium modified skyrme lagrangian was presented , the mass term being modified based on the phenomenology of low - energy pion - nucleus scattering .",
    "the modified mass term leads also to the changes of the kinetic term . in the present work ,",
    "we additionally consider the modification of the skyrme stabilizing term . the resulting lagrangian is given as follows : @xmath3 ^ 2\\cr & & + \\frac{f_\\pi^2m_\\pi^2}{16}\\,\\alpha_s({\\bm r}){\\rm tr}(u+ u^\\dagger-2)\\ , , \\label{eq : lag}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath4 denotes the pion decay constant , @xmath5 is the skyrme parameter , and @xmath6 stands for the pion mass .",
    "the medium functionals @xmath7 and @xmath8 are written in the following forms @xmath9 which represent the influence of the surrounding environment on the properties of the single skyrmion .",
    "these parameters are related respectively to the corresponding phenomenological @xmath10- and @xmath11-wave pion - nucleus scattering lengths and volumes , i.e. @xmath12 and @xmath13 , and describe the pion physics in a baryon - rich environment  @xcite .",
    "the density of the surrounding nuclear environment is given by @xmath14 , @xmath15 denotes the lorentz - lorenz or correlation parameter , @xmath16 represents the kinematical factor , and @xmath17 is the nucleon mass in free space .",
    "in addition to these changes of the mass and kinetic terms done in ref .",
    "@xcite , we introduce the new density - dependent functional @xmath18 which provides the in - medium dependence of the skyrme parameter , i.e. @xmath19 . as mentioned in introduction , this medium modification can be related to the density dependence of vector meson properties . furthermore , to fix this additional dependence in the present work",
    ", we will concentrate on the bulk properties of infinite and homogenous nuclear matter with constant density ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "note that the lagrangian ( [ eq : lag ] ) is modified in such a way  @xcite that at zero density it reduces to the original lagrangian of the skyrme model and at the linear approximation it reproduces the well - known equation of the pion fields in nuclear medium  @xcite .",
    "in order to analyze the field equation for the classical pion field in homogenous nuclear matter one can choose the spherically symmetric ",
    "hedgehog \" form for the boson field @xmath21 , where @xmath22 denotes the unit vector in coordinate space , @xmath23 are the usual pauli matrices , and @xmath24 stands for the profile function of the pion field .",
    "the pertinent field equation , which is given as @xmath25 is obtained by minimizing the medium - modified mass of the static skyrmion @xmath26 in the last two expressions , we have introduced the dimensionless variable @xmath27 and the new constant @xmath28 .",
    "the collective quantization of the classical skyrmion  @xcite yields the in - medium modified nucleon mass and the corresponding @xmath29 mass splitting respectively as @xmath30 where @xmath31 denotes the in - medium moment of inertia of the skyrmion .",
    "the meson - baryon vertices in nuclear matter can be derived by calculating the in - medium modified @xmath2 form factor  @xcite @xmath32 where @xmath33 , @xmath34 is the spherical bessel function with order 1 and @xmath35 is defined as @xmath36    using the lagrangian given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : lag ] ) , one can calculate the in - medium modifications of the single nucleon properties and the pion - nucleon coupling constant .",
    "note that the parameters of the model are fitted to be @xmath37  mev and @xmath38 so as to reproduce the experimental values of the nucleon and @xmath1 in free space .",
    "consequently , the pion mass is also fixed to be its experimental value for the neutral pion , i.e. @xmath39  mev .",
    "a set of values of parameters in the medium functionals  ( [ medfunc ] ) are taken from the analysis of phenomenological data for pion - nucleus scattering  @xcite .",
    "as is clear from the discussions in the previous section , if the modification of the skyrme term is ignored , the values of all input parameters are fitted to the phenomenology or taken from it .",
    "when , however , the skyrme term is modified , we introduce one additional functional @xmath40 which , in general , may be related to the vector meson properties in nuclear matter .",
    "one can also note that the lessening value of the skyrme parameter in nuclear medium may correspond to a decrease of the @xmath41 coupling and , therefore , to the change of the rho meson width in nuclear matter or to a diminishing value of its mass in medium , i.e. @xmath42 . there are experimental indications to those changes of the @xmath14 meson properties  @xcite and the theoretical predictions  @xcite .",
    "following the ideas presented in those theoretical approaches , one may be able to fit @xmath43 .",
    "however , it is still under debate how the properties of the @xmath14 meson undergo in medium both theoretically and experimentally , and model - dependent .",
    "thus , in the present work , we will proceed to fit the form of the functional @xmath43 to the bulk properties of nuclear matter rather than following a specific model .    as a first step , we explicitly choose its form to reproduce the first coefficient ( volume term ) in the semiempirical weizscker - bethe - bacher mass formula . then the binding energy per nucleon at a given density",
    "can be defined simply as @xmath44 this is somehow a crude approximation but a comprehensive one .",
    "one could even fit the form of @xmath43 by investigating different terms in the mass formula and by examining the interplay between them .",
    "however , within the present work , the approximation defined in eq .",
    "( [ be ] ) will be enough for the qualitative analysis of the changes due to the modification of the skyrme parameter .    in the present calculation",
    "we have tried various forms of the dependence of @xmath43 on the nuclear density @xmath14 such as linear , quadratic , polynomial , exponential forms , etc .",
    "it turns out that the best fit to the ground state of nuclear matter is achieved by the following form @xmath45 where @xmath46 and @xmath47 are variational parameters .    .",
    "the solid curve ( left scale ) corresponds to the parametrization of @xmath43 in eq .",
    "( [ gamma ] ) , with @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath11-wave scattering volume @xmath50 used .",
    "the dashed one ( left scale ) draws the case when @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath11-wave scattering volume @xmath53 .",
    "@xmath10-wave scattering length is fixed at @xmath54 and the correlation parameter has value @xmath55 .",
    "the dotted one ( right scale ) shows the case that skyrme term intact in nuclear matter and consequently @xmath56 .",
    "the normal nuclear density is given as @xmath57 . ]",
    "let us first discuss the behavior of the binding energy when the skyrme term is intact in nuclear matter , i.e. @xmath56 . the corresponding binding energy is depicted as the dotted curve in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] with the energy scale drawn at the right vertical axis .",
    "one can note that in this case the binding energy monotonically falls off as the density increases . in the language of the single skyrmion",
    ", it indicates that the skyrmion swells to a larger volume and all skyrmions of the system start to overlap .",
    "thus , the density of the system continuously increases .",
    "this is not surprising , because the medium modification in this case can be simply related to that of the pion decay constant @xmath58 .",
    "for the moment , one can ignore the explicit chiral symmetry breaking term in the lagrangian , because its influence to the stability is rather small in comparison with the effects coming from the first two terms .",
    "the decreasing value of the pion decay constant changes the contribution from the nonlinear kinetic term . as a result",
    "the skyrmions swell to the larger volume and it is necessary to prevent this by some mechanism .",
    "it implies that one must introduce either strong repulsive @xmath0 interactions at short distances or some mean - field mechanism as in the walecka model  @xcite",
    ". however , one interesting way to avoid this collapse may be to modify the skyrme term and it is also physically motivated as discussed at the beginning of this section .",
    "moreover , it is much simpler and transparent to consider the modification of the skyrme term .",
    "we also present two different results with the modified skyrme term in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] : the solid and dashed curves draw the parametrization of eq .",
    "( [ gamma ] ) with the energy scale depicted at the left vertical axis .",
    "note that the values of the variational parameters , @xmath46 and @xmath47 , are chosen in a such way that the minimum of the binding energy occurs at the normal nuclear matter density and reproduces correctly the first coefficient in the empirical formula for the binding energy .",
    "the difference between these two curves is due to the fact that we use two different values of the @xmath11-wave scattering length , i.e. @xmath50 for the solid curve and @xmath53 for the dashed one .",
    "the results show that the dependence on the density is rather insensitive to the changes of input parameters from pion - nucleus scattering phenomenology and moreover the effect of the changes in @xmath12 is even milder .    in order to see the validity of eq .",
    "( [ gamma ] ) , it is of great importance to examine the changes of other physical observables .",
    "let us first discuss thermodynamic properties of nuclear matter .",
    "the pressure is given by the following formula @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the total binding energy of nuclear matter per unit volume .",
    "it vanished naturally at the equilibrium point and for the parametrization of eq .",
    "( [ gamma ] ) . we want to emphasize that the pressure is always decreasing with the skyrme term intacted .",
    "another important quantity is the compressibility of nuclear matter expressed as @xmath61\\right\\},\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the corresponding results are listed in table  [ tab1 ] with two different values of the @xmath10-wave scattering length @xmath12  @xcite used .",
    ".compressibility of nuclear matter @xmath62 and an effective @xmath1-nucleon mass difference @xmath63 at the normal nuclear matter density @xmath57 .",
    "the variational parameters @xmath46 and @xmath47 are fitted to reproduce the minimum of the binding energy per nucleon @xmath64  mev at the normal nuclear matter density .",
    "the correlation parameter is taken to be @xmath55.[tab1 ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the results show that the compressibility of nuclear matter and the effective @xmath65 mass difference are rather stable under the change of @xmath12 .",
    "on the contrary , they are quite sensitive to the value of @xmath11-wave scattering volume @xmath13 . at the empirical value of @xmath50",
    ", the compressibility turns out to be very large ( @xmath66  mev ) in comparison with those obtained in relativistic dirac - brueckner - hartree - fock approaches  @xcite and in the walecka model  @xcite .",
    "we find that as lower values of @xmath13 are used @xmath62 is noticeably decreased .",
    "for example , for @xmath53 the compressibility is already consistent with that of the walecka model ( @xmath67  mev ) .",
    "if one uses even a smaller value of @xmath13 such as @xmath68 , the result of @xmath62 is further brought down to be comparable with that in dirac - brueckner - hartree - fock approaches ( @xmath69  mev ) , which is close to the empirical value .",
    "it indicates that the present work prefers smaller values of @xmath13 than that used in the pionic atom analysis as far as the compressibility is concerned .",
    "note that a similar conclusion about @xmath13 was drawn from the analysis of an effective axial - vector coupling within the original medium - modified skyrme model  @xcite .",
    "we remind that @xmath62 is sensitive to the position of the saturation point .",
    "fitting the saturation point at slightly lower densities , we see that the compressibility decreases drastically",
    ". however , the situation may change if one considers a more accurate approximation with the surface and symmetry energy terms explicitly taken into account in eq .",
    "( [ be ] ) .    in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] , the dependence of the @xmath29 mass difference on the nuclear matter density is drawn .",
    "mass difference in nuclear matter .",
    "the notations and input parameters are the same as those in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] . ]",
    "the results show that the modified skyrme term leads to rather different results from that without the modification . with the skyrme term modified ( see solid and dashed curves ) , the results of @xmath70 fall off faster as the density increases in comparison with that with the original skyrme term ( see dotted curve ) .",
    "of course , this is due to the explicit density dependence of the moment of inertia  ( [ inmom ] ) through the additional density functional @xmath43 .",
    "it implies that it is easier to make the nucleon excited to the @xmath1 state in nuclear matter , which seems more realistic than that without the modification of the skyrme term .    in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] , the changes of the @xmath2 coupling constant are depicted .",
    "coupling constant on the density .",
    "notations are similar to those in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] . ]    here the modifications of the skyrme term bring about more dramatic results .",
    "when the skyrme term is intact , i.e. @xmath71 , @xmath72 monotonically decreases as the density increases ( see the dotted curve in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] ) .",
    "however , when one introduces the density dependence of the skyrme term , the results are noticeably changed . using the parametrization of eq .",
    "( [ gamma ] ) with the different values of input parameter @xmath13 , we find that the @xmath2 coupling in medium changes drastically .",
    "for example , with the value of @xmath53 the in - medium pion - nucleon coupling constant @xmath73 starts to increase monotonically up to high ( @xmath74 ) densities as drawn in the dashed curve .",
    "the @xmath73 with @xmath53 will disappear at around @xmath74 . on the other hand ,",
    "if one uses @xmath50 , it is getting increased up to the normal nuclear matter density and stays more or less constant .",
    "then it slowly falls off as the density increases .",
    "when it approaches the critical point @xmath75 , it drops sharply and goes to zero ( see the solid curve in fig .  [ fig:3 ] ) . above the critical point ( @xmath76 )",
    ", the skyrmion does not exist .",
    "it is not surprising , because the sign of the combination @xmath77 in eq .",
    "( [ feq ] ) is changed and therefore there is no stable solitonic solution anymore .",
    "let us draw the attention again to the bulk properties of nuclear matter in order to understand the modifications of the skyrme term better .",
    "following klebanov  @xcite , after quantizing and using the formula presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , one can estimate the symmetry energy in the semiempirical formula for the nuclear binding energy : @xmath78 this crude formula of the symmetry energy already provides the enlightening results .",
    "for example , @xmath43 parameterized as in eq .",
    "( [ gamma ] ) , @xmath79  mev for @xmath53 whereas @xmath80  mev for @xmath50 .",
    "these results for the symmetry energy must be compared with the experimental one @xmath81  mev .",
    "the order of the symmetry energy calculated within the skyrme model is comparable to the experimental data . to estimate the symmetry energy more accurately ,",
    "however , one should consider the minimization of the whole binding energy taking into account the interplay between the different terms in the mass formula as we stated already .",
    "moreover , one should consider the effects of finite nuclei and explicit isospin - breaking effects and so on .",
    "we want to mention that this is also possible within the in - medium modified skyrme model and can be done as in refs .",
    "@xcite , an additional modification of the skyrme term being performed as was done in the present work .",
    "in the present investigation , we aimed at studying the modifications of the quartic term in the skyrme model .",
    "the results from this work shows that the additional modifications change dramatically the whole picture and allows one to understand the role of the modifications in a more comprehensive way .",
    "one can note that an alternative approach to many - body systems within the skyrme model  @xcite points to the changes of the input parameters ( so called `` calibration '' ) according to the number of baryons in the system . within our approach",
    "these changes were shown in a more realistic and transparent way and were treated not only at the level of the system but also at the level of its constituents .    from the previous studies we know that the large renormalization of the nucleon mass in nuclear medium causes one of the difficulties to bind the infinite nuclear matter  @xcite and to reproduce the correct values of the nolen - schiffer anomaly in mirror nuclei within the in - medium modified skyrme model  @xcite .",
    "the relatively small change of the nucleon mass in nuclear matter within the present approach is an interesting result , which can be used to reproduce the correct value of the nolen - schiffer anomaly .",
    "in addition to the small nucleon mass renormalization , the dramatic changes in the pion - nucleon coupling constant gives the opportunity to revise the previous investigation on nuclear matter related to the quantum - mechanical many - body problems  @xcite .",
    "more completely , one can improve the present approach by treating the density of the system in a fully consistent way .",
    "since it is a sum of the single skyrmion densities in a given initial configuration and one can study the equilibration of the matter to its ground state , taking into account the deformation effects on the properties of its constituents  @xcite .",
    "having considered the modification of the skyrme term , we assert that the present approach is self - consistent : it treats the single hadron properties , the hadron - hadron interactions and the bulk matter properties on an equal footing .",
    "moreover , it is closely related to phenomenological low - energy data at the single - hadron level as well as at the level of hadronic systems .",
    "the present approach can be extended to the studies of the properties of finite nuclei and its constituents .",
    "the authors are grateful to h.k .",
