    "moreover , we can require that @xmath6 has series expansion @xmath9 normalized in this way @xmath6 is unique and is said to be _ hydrodynamically normalized_. the function @xmath10 is positive , continuous and strictly increasing : it is called the _ half - plane capacity _ of @xmath11 $ ] .",
    "thus we can reparameterize @xmath12 such that @xmath13 for all @xmath14 , we will call this _ parameterization by half - plane capacity_. with this normalization and parameterization , the function @xmath6 satisfies the differential equation ( where @xmath15 denotes differentiation with respect to @xmath16 and @xmath17 denotes differentiation with respect to @xmath14 ) : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is a continuous real - valued function .",
    "this is the _ chordal loewner differential equation _ ; @xmath20 is called the _ driving function _ of the slit @xmath12 .",
    "the converse is also true : given a measurable function @xmath21 , the differential equation ( [ hatton ] ) with initial condition @xmath22 has solution @xmath6 which is a conformal map from @xmath7 into itself ( although @xmath23 is not necessarily a slit domain ) .",
    "chapter 3 and 4 of @xcite gives full details of this construction .",
    "since schramm s discovery of stochastic loewner evolution in 1999 ( see @xcite ) , there has been huge interest in the chordal loewner differential equation and its variants .",
    "but the relationship between the slit in @xmath7 and its resulting driving function is not well understood .",
    "there are a few papers that relate the behaviour of the slit with the behaviour of the driving function e.g. @xcite,@xcite ; also , the paper @xcite calculates the slit arising from a few driving functions . in this paper , we will obtain a first order differential equation for @xmath21 ( which we can then solve numerically ) that allows us to calculate the driving function @xmath21 in the case where the curve @xmath12 is a trajectory arc of a certain type of quadratic differential .",
    "we will show that this includes , for example , the case when @xmath12 is a path on the square / triangle / hexagonal lattice in the upper half - plane or indeed , in any domain whose boundary lies on such a lattice .",
    "so for example , figure [ fig1 ] plots the driving function of a path on the hexagonal lattice in the upper half - plane and figure [ fig3 ] plots the driving function of a path on the square lattice in the upper half - plane .",
    "we also note that we can obtain equivalent results for other variants of the loewner differential equation for example , in the radial version or with multiple slits .",
    "we will discuss this in the paper as well .",
    "the proof of our formulae uses a generalization of schwarz - christoffel mapping to domains bounded by trajectory arcs of rotations of a given quadratic differential .",
    "we also mention that , currently , the common method used to find the driving function of a given slit is to use the zipper algorithm discovered independently by d. e. marshall and r. khnau to approximate the function @xmath6 which can then be used to determine the driving function .",
    "the zipper algorithm can be viewed as a discrete version of the loewner differential equation and hence is well suited to studying growth processes .",
    "it also has the advantage of being very fast .",
    "see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "to state our main results , we have to provide some background in the theory of quadratic differentials . note that not all the terms used here are standard in the literature .",

    "the `` 4 '' in the definition ensures that the degree is conformally invariant in a way which we will make precise later .",

    "hence , a @xmath52-trajectory arc is simply a trajectory arc and we call a @xmath53-trajectory arc an _ orthogonal trajectory arc_. it is clear that these definitions are invariant under reparameterization of @xmath12 so we will often call the point set of @xmath12 a trajectory arc or @xmath49-trajectory arc .",
    "we call a maximal trajectory arc a _ trajectory _ and similarly , a maximal @xmath49-trajectory arc is called a _ @xmath49-trajectory_. for example , if we consider the quadratic differential @xmath54 in @xmath55 , then the @xmath49-trajectories are the straight lines with gradient @xmath56 .",

    "note that each derivative of @xmath21 is finite for @xmath4 since @xmath293 then @xmath21 is smooth implies that @xmath294 are also smooth .",
    "theorem [ gammadot ] then follows from corollary [ qdscslit ] and theorem [ qddriving ] :     + first note that , by the definition of @xmath49-trajectory arcs , @xmath295 always exists and is never 0 . also by corollary [ qdscslit ] , @xmath296",
    "; thus the right hand side of ( [ erdei ] ) always exists since , by definition , @xmath12 avoids poles and zeroes of @xmath171 .",

    ", we will demonstrate how we can use ( [ wright ] ) to calculate numerically the driving function of a given slit that consists of @xmath72-trajectory arcs of a given quadratic differential .",

    ", we obtain an approximation of @xmath21 at the points @xmath321 .",
    "so clearly what we need to do now is find the starting values @xmath313 and @xmath314",
    "so we can apply the above method .",
    "but because @xmath21 is not differentiable at @xmath52 , we can not use the formula ( [ castillo ] ) with @xmath322 .",

    ". then we also have @xmath332 and also , @xmath333 are approximately the two preimages of @xmath106 under @xmath334",

    "then we note that the 2 preimages of @xmath106 under @xmath341 can be determined explicitly ( see @xcite ) .",
    "this obviates the need to numerically invert @xmath336 .",
    "+ another difficulty is that , in general , given a slit , we can not parameterize it by half - plane capacity so it would be difficult , for example , to know at which @xmath14 one should stop . most formulae for calculating half - plane capacity of some compact set @xmath317 rely on knowing the conformal map @xmath342 of @xmath7 onto @xmath343 ( normalized hydrodynamically ) .",
    "one possibility would be to use the probabilistic definitions of half - plane capacity given in @xcite .",
    "we will use the fact that theorem [ gammadot ] and corollary [ smoothxi ] imply that we can give all derivatives of @xmath344 in terms of @xmath345 and the exponents @xmath346 so if we know these , we can also use ( [ castillo ] ) to approximate @xmath12 .",
    "this in turn allows us to calculate the length of the slit @xmath12 .",
    "thus if we know beforehand length of our slit , we can calculate at what value of @xmath14 we stop .",
    "we now have everything we need in order to use ( [ castillo ] ) to calculate the driving function numerically of any slit that is made up of @xmath72 trajectory arcs of a quadratic differential @xmath171 .",
    "we will demonstrate how this is done in the following example :      suppose that @xmath347 is a piecewise linear arc parameterized by half - plane capacity that satisfies :    * @xmath348 . * from @xmath322 to @xmath349 , @xmath12 is the straight line arc from @xmath52 to @xmath350 ; call this @xmath351 .",

    "as mentioned previously , there is no easy way to know beforehand what @xmath360 are . for simplicity",
    ", we will only use @xmath361 in ( [ castillo ] ) i.e. @xmath362 and fix a large @xmath317 .",

    "now note that @xmath369 makes an angle of @xmath372 with the positive real axis . and hence @xmath373 since @xmath317 is large .",
    "we can then use newton s method to find the preimages under the above approximation of @xmath374 of the points @xmath375 and the 2 preimages of zero to get the points @xmath376 and hence , using ( [ toney ] ) , we can find @xmath377 .",
    "then inserting this into ( [ castillo ] ) , as detailed above we can also find @xmath378 and @xmath379 ; also , by theorem [ gammadot ] , we can find @xmath380 if we let @xmath381 then @xmath382 for @xmath317 large .",

    "we insert these into the formula iteratively to get @xmath397 and @xmath398 until @xmath399 .",
    "thus the end result is that we found the driving function of the first 3 steps of the slit given in figure [ fig2 ] .",
    "of course , our calculation of @xmath21 will be more accurate by taking larger @xmath317 .",
    "+ for example , we can use the above method to calculate the driving function of any path on the square / triangle / hexagonal lattice on @xmath7 starting from some point in @xmath152 .",

    "moreover , @xmath415 is a crosscut of @xmath7 with one end point at @xmath20 and the other end point in @xmath152 such that either @xmath416 or @xmath417 is contained in the closure of the bounded component of @xmath418 . without loss of generality ,",
    "assume it is @xmath416 .",
