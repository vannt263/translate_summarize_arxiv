    "the conductance @xmath1 of an aharonov - bohm ( ab ) ring oscillates with magnetic field @xmath2 with a period @xmath3 determined by the area @xmath4 between two interfering paths @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the flux quantum .",
    "the combination of the ab ring with a quantum dot ( qd ) in one of its arms gives the opportunity to measure the phase of transmission amplitude through the qd .",
    "@xcite the dot , tuned to a transmission resonance , sustains coherent transport all over the width of the resonance peak .",
    "so far this was realized in different groups by recording ab oscillations as a function of the magnetic field and tracing their phase with respect to the energy of the resonant state , which was controlled by a plunger gate .",
    "@xcite fano resonances were observed in ref .  , while other works @xcite show the phase evolution of ab oscillations while scanning through each coulomb peak in energy changing the plunger gate . here",
    "a slip by @xmath0 was seen , what can be explained in a single particle picture . for the observed @xmath0-jump between two coulomb peaks@xcite a theory involving many particles",
    "is needed .",
    "besides the phase of the transmitted current also the phase of the reflected current was probed @xcite , which showed similar results . in order to determine the energy - dependence of the phase , it was necessary to record many @xmath7-traces differing in plunger gate , each resulting , in a single point in the phase evolution .",
    "the question arises , whether one could directly measure the phase in an interferometer , when the qd crosses a resonance .",
    "this has two attractive advantages .",
    "first the measurement process speeds up , because information about phase is acquired in a single sweep of the plunger gate .",
    "second , with such a fast measurement process , one could think about detection of the charge state for the qd by measuring its transmission ( reflection ) phase .",
    "the latter can be important for building charge qubits based on double quantum dot system .",
    "however in conventional ab interferometers , the small interference contrast ( typically 10% ) and signal noise makes this task difficult.@xcite in this work we report on measurements of qd transmission phase with an electronic mach - zehnder interferometer.@xcite the electronic mach - zehnder interferometer employs edge channels of a two dimensional electron system in the quantum hall regime and quantum point contacts as beam splitters .",
    "the interference contrast can be very large , up to 80  % , at temperatures near 20 mk.@xcite",
    "the interferometer ( see fig .  1 ) was fabricated on the basis of a modulation doped gaas / ga@xmath8al@xmath9as heterostructure containing a two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) 90  nm below the surface . at  4  k ,",
    "the unpatterned 2deg density and mobility were @xmath10=2.0@xmath1110@xmath12  m@xmath13 and @xmath14=206  m@xmath15(vs ) , respectively .",
    "the details of fabrication procedure can be found in ref .  .",
    "each arm of the mzi was approximately 9  @xmath14 m long and the gap between the tips of quantum point contacts was 400  nm .",
    "this interferometer showed a maximum visibility of 56% and an area of 25  @xmath16 between interfering paths , found from the period of aharonov - bohm oscillations . a standard lock - in technique ( @xmath17300  hz ) with 1  @xmath14v excitation at terminal s and detection at terminal d2 was employed ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "all measurements were performed at a temperature below 50  mk .",
    "the horizontal line denotes half transmission of the qpc which should in a single particle picture correspond to the highest visibility .",
    "( b ) visibility of aharonov - bohm oscillations , experimentally measured ( thick red line ) and calculated from transmission of qpc2 ( thin black line ) , versus qpc2 gate voltage ( @xmath18 , see eq .",

    "in many experiments , the transmission characteristics of the qpcs , in high perpendicular magnetic field exhibit resonances superimposed on the conductance steps [ fig .",
    "2(a ) , see also @xcite ] .",
    "as we will show below , our data suggest that this originates from the coulomb blockade of a quantum dot formed inadvertently by the disorder potential in the vicinity of the qpcs .",
    "the interference contrast was highest for the outer edge channel .",
    "to record the characteristics in fig .",
    "2(a ) , ( i ) the magnetic field was set to 4.6  t ( filling factor 1.6 ) , ( ii ) qpc0 was adjusted to transmit only the outermost channel , and ( iii ) the gate voltage for qpc2 was swept to negative voltages , while keeping qpc1 open [ see also fig .",
    "3(a ) ] . a sequence of peaks ( marked by letters a , b , c in fig .",
    "2(a ) in the gate characteristics of qpc2 appears at transmissions less than 1 .",
    "it is of interest to check if any peak structure can be found in the dependence on a magnetic field .",
    "the magnetic field dependence of current transmitted through qpc2 is plotted in fig .",
    "while sweeping the magnetic field , the data was recorded after adjusting qpc0 to reflect the half - filled upper landau level , opening qpc1 , and tuning the gate voltage of qpc2 at the maximum of peak `` a '' ( @xmath20 ) ( @xmath2=4.6 t ) .",
    "the average current in fig .",
    "3(c ) corresponding to @xmath21 at @xmath2=4.8 t increases to the left from that point , reaching @xmath22 at @xmath2=3.8 t , and decreases to the right approaching value @xmath23 .",
    "this occurs because of the change of energy for the lowest landau subband . in other words",
    "the potential barrier adjusted at @xmath2=4.8 t decreases and disappears to the left from this point and grows to the right as function of @xmath2 .",
    "we find that this current has oscillatory components , which are not expected for a single barrier but could easily appear in a device with two and more barriers .",
    "fourier analysis reveals two frequencies in @xmath2 , corresponding to periods of 0.27 and 0.18  t , and their higher harmonics . when interpreted as aharonov - bohm oscillations ( @xmath24 ) these two periods correspond to areas enclosed by circumference with diameter @xmath25 of 140 and 170  nm .",
    "this is well compatible with the lithographic gap between qpc tips ( 400 nm ) and with the spatial variation of the disorder potential near 100 nm measured , e.g. , in ref .   for 2deg structure with parameters similar to ours .",
    "aharonov - bohm oscillations induced by potential fluctuations in single qpc in high magnetic field was reported before .",
    "@xcite in addition , we found that the resonances in fig .",
    "2(a ) are also dependent on cooling cycle , i.e. the shape of the resonances is unique for each cool down .",
    "this indicates that charging of donor atoms in the doping layer plays a role in the resonance formation .",
    "next , we discuss the response of the mzi interference near the resonances in the transmission of qpc2 . to investigate this ,",
    "first , the qpc1 must be set to half transmission , generating two interfering paths as shown in fig .",
    "second , the interference signal must be measured as a function of the qpc2 gate voltage . here",
    "two possibilities arise depending on the regime for a modulation gate voltage @xmath26 which is normally used to observe interference by shifting the phase of one arm with respect to other . these are i ) sweeping @xmath26 simultaneously with the qpc2 gate voltage ; and ii ) keeping @xmath26 constant .",
    "the former allows to determine the interference contrast as function of @xmath27 ( or @xmath28 ) and was demonstrated before [ ref .  , fig .",
    "1(c ) ; fig .",
    "in contrast , the latter is sensitive to any phase gain during a change of the qpc2 gate voltage .",
    "we explore both of these opportunities starting from the measurement of the span for ab oscillation vs. @xmath27 . the relative amplitude of oscillations is called visibility @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and is plotted in fig .",
    "here one sees that the visibility @xmath29 peaks at the transmission resonances `` a '' , `` b '' and `` c '' .",
    "qualitatively , this is explained by the fact that the visibility has a maximum when both arms carry equal current , i.e. at @xmath31 ( a quantitative analysis follows below ) .",
    "therefore the closer @xmath32 is to @xmath33 , the higher is the visibility .",
    "the phase information does not show itself in this experiment , but it does when the modulation gate voltage @xmath26 is kept constant [ fig .",
    "we focus on the resonances `` b '' and `` c '' where an abrupt change of the current is observed . some traces show at `` b '' and `` c '' a clear alternation between a peak and a dip structure .",
    "that means if the ab oscillations are adjusted to a maximum with mg , it changes abruptly to a minimum , when passing the resonance .",
    "this implies a phase change of @xmath0 at the resonance .",
    "now we address quantitatively the results in fig .  2 in the framework of a model assuming noninteracting particles .",
    "this model predicts the mzi transmission coefficient @xcite @xmath34 here @xmath35 are transmission and reflection amplitudes of qpcs and @xmath36 is the phase difference between the interferometer arms . from this formula one can easily find the expression for the visibility as function of one of the qpc transmission , namely , @xmath37    where the factor @xmath38 accounts for the decoherence at finite temperature . using this expression and the measured transmission values for @xmath28 in fig .",
    "2(a ) , we calculate the dependence of visibility @xmath39 and compare it with the experimental one . the black , thin line in fig .",
    "2(b ) shows the result , which agrees in general well with the experiment .",
    "there are two regions of deviation from the simple model of eq .",
    "[ t ] , marked by arrows in fig .",
    "2(b ) , and peak `` b '' is within one of those .",
    "in contrast to this the peak `` c '' , with small transmission value , is well described by the model , as well as the region with transmission close to 1 ( @xmath40651  mv ) and the one on the right wing of the peak `` a '' ( @xmath41708  mv@xmath42678  mv ) .",
    "= 0.4 , 0.8 , 1.2 and 2.0  mv changing from bottom to top .",
    "( b ) the same for the peak `` b '' in fig .",
    "2(c ) . the curves in ( a ) , ( b ) shifted for clarity except lowest one .",
    "( c ) the phase shift between interferometer arms , found from the fit to the resonances `` b '' and `` c '' , plotted as function of @xmath26 .",
    "the full lines in ( c ) are expected slopes resulted from ab period @xmath43=1.6  mv in @xmath26 .",
    "the phase evolution for the resonance `` a '' was evaluated by procedure described in the text.,width=321 ]    following the noninteracting particle approach from ref .",
    "we add a quantum dot to the above mentioned mzi , whose transmission properties are modelled by the breit - wigner formula .",
    "we replace transmission and reflection amplitudes of qpc2 by those of the quantum dot .",
    "the dot transmission amplitude has a phase which must be added to the cosine argument in eq .",
    "then the coherent component in mzi transmission is proportional to @xmath44 $ ] where @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 stand for the transmission ( reflection ) amplitude of qd and the phase of qd respectively .",
    "the breit - wigner formula for the selected state with the energy @xmath48 @xmath49 with @xmath50 $ ] and relation @xmath51 were applied for the simulation of experimental curves [ in fig .  4 ] .",
    "this model rather well describes the interference resonances `` b '' and `` c '' . the peak `` a '' was analyzed below only qualitatively , because it deviates over a wide range from eq .",
    "the resonance `` c '' was matched well by calculated curves [ fig .",
    "4(a ) ] with resonance width of @xmath52=1.9  mv determined from fit by lorentzian the peak in the qpc2 transmission in fig .",
    "therefore the only fitting parameter for this interference resonance was the phase shift @xmath36 . for peak `` b '' [ fig .",
    "4(b ) ] an effective transmission resonance , of smaller amplitude and width [ @xmath53=2.5  mv instead 3.4  mv in fig .",
    "2(a ) ] , matching the experimental visibility in the fig .",
    "2(b ) , was used .",
    "in addition to the good matching of the experimental curves in fig .",
    "4(a , b ) to eq .",
    "[ bw ] , the validity of our interpretation is supported by the correlation between the phase set by the modulation gate voltage and that determined from the best fit to experimental data in fig .",
    "4a and b with eq .",
    "the period of ab oscillations in @xmath26 was found to be 1.6  mv , which corresponds to phase change of 2@xmath0 . in the fig .",
    "4(c ) we plot the phase found from fitting as function of modulation gate voltage @xmath54 for the peaks `` c''(squares ) and `` b '' ( circles ) , and from these graphs extract the slope @xmath55 of @xmath56 .",
    "we find @xmath57  mv , which is in perfect agreement with the the period @xmath26 extracted from the interference pattern @xmath58 .",
    "the phase shift @xmath36 of peak `` a '' can only be determined qualitatively as mentioned above . from figures 4(a ) and ( b ) one can see , that a peak in the interference resonance corresponds to @xmath59 , the dip to @xmath0 , combination left peak / right dip to @xmath60 , and left dip / right peak to @xmath61 . comparing this with the shape of the interference resonance of peak `` a '' we can deduce an approximate phase shift .",
    "it is interesting to investigate the direction of the phase evolution in fig .",
    "4(c ) @xmath54 for the neighboring peaks `` a '' and `` b '' , and peak `` c '' .",
    "as a result , peak `` a '' shows the same direction of phase evolution as `` b '' [ fig .",
    "4(c ) , triangles ] .",
    "on the other hand , the phase evolution of peak `` c '' goes into the opposite direction .",
    "this discrepancy may originate from the variability of two barriers , since the dot is defined by the single qpc2 gate and the disorder potential .",
    "tuning the gate potential of qpc2 changes simultaneously the two barrier heights of the qd and its well depth .",
    "the largest of the two barriers must be the branching point of the interferometer path .",
    "if the barriers interchange their height , the branching point will interchange its location as well . in this case",
    "the @xmath0 phase shift from the quantum dot may contribute either to the upper arm or to the lower one [ fig .",
    "3(b ) ] , and depending on this , gain its different sign in the paths phase difference .",
    "in summary we have shown that the frequently observed transmission resonances in quantum point contacts within an electronic mach - zehnder interferometer stem from inadvertent quantum dots formed by the disorder potential in high magnetic field and measured the phase of the transmission amplitude through a quantum dot .",
    "we propose to utilize this effect for the detection of the state of charge qubits in the vicinity of a mach - zehnder interferometer via their reflection phase .",
    "such a dispersive read - out may allow more sensitive and less invasive detection than the currently used quantum point contacts .",
