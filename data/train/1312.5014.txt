    "quantum control is a coherent or incoherent process to steer a quantum system to a given target state @xcite .",
    "it is significant in many fields of quantum physics , especially in the quantum computation and quantum information processing @xcite .",
    "various notations in classical control theory were generalized to the quantum control , such as open and closed control , optimal control @xcite , controllability @xcite , feedback control @xcite and so on . for incoherent control the quantum system is controlled by its interaction with a quantum accessor rather than classical fields @xcite . typically one first models the controlled system and examine its controllability which is relevant to the system hamiltonian and interaction hamiltonian with control fields . then one needs to design classical fields to interact with the controlled system to steer the system to the given target state , which is referred to as the control protocol and is the issue we would like to address in this paper .",
    "some approaches , such as using the cartan decomposition of lie groups [ 13 ] , were proposed on this issues .    in a previous paper [ 14 ] , we proposed an explicit control protocol of finite dimensional quantum system using time - dependent cosine classical field , where we have to use the rotating wave approximation to drop the high oscillating terms in the interaction hamiltonian . in this work , we will use the alternating square pulses with positive and negative parts in each period , to control the finite quantum systems .",
    "advantage of using square pulses is that we can find an invariant space in which the interaction hamiltonian and time evolution operator can be explicitly treated without using rotating wave approximation . on the other hand , except the system with equal energy gaps except the first we considered before , we mainly consider the systems with multiple transitions in a cycle , especially the one with all equal adjacent energy gaps of dimension three .",
    "the relationship between probability amplitudes of target states and control parameters , the number of pulses and the difference between positive and negative amplitudes of the pulses , is analytically established .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we formulate the controlled system and control protocol , and derive the time evolution operators .",
    "we present control protocols of systems with equal energy gaps except the first one , four dimensional system with equal first and third energy gaps and different second energy gap , and system with equal energy gaps of dimension three in sections iii , iv , and v , respectively .",
    "we draw our conclusion in sec.vi .    throughout this paper",
    "we use @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "consider an @xmath2-dimensional non - degenerate quantum system with eigenenergy @xmath3 and corresponding eigenstate @xmath4 , described by the hamiltonian @xmath5 our aim is to develop control protocols to drive the system to an arbitrary target states from an initial state , or in other words , to design classical fields to interact with the system such that the system is driven to a required target state within finite time .",
    "for this purpose , we should keep in mind that    * as there are @xmath6 independent real parameters in the target states ( @xmath7 real probability amplitudes and @xmath7 relative phases ) , we need to supply @xmath6 real control parameters in the control protocol ; * one needs to establish relationship between control parameters and probability amplitudes of the target states such that one can design the control fields and its coupling with the controlled systems ; * in each cycle the control operation should be easily complemented in the laboratory .",
    "the simplest protocol is that one can control transition only between two energy levels in each cycle , for example , the system ( system i ) with all equal energy gaps except the first one @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the energy gap , and the system with all distinct adjacent energy gaps @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) , considered in ref .",
    "however , this is not always possible , for example , the 4-dimensional system with @xmath12 as shown in fig.[tang2 - 4d - system](a ) ( system ii ) . in this case , the control field with frequency @xmath13 cause transition form @xmath14 to @xmath15 and from @xmath16 to @xmath17 simultaneously and the interaction hamiltonian is written as @xmath18 fortunately , its time evolution operator can be factorized . in particular , for some special initial state such as @xmath14 , if we arrange this control process as the first cycle , the states @xmath16 and @xmath17 keep unchanged and mathematically equivalent to only transition between @xmath14 and @xmath15 occurs .",
    "we will investigate control protocol of this system in sec.[section-4dimensional ] .",
    "however , for systems with all equal adjacent energy gaps , the time evolution operator is difficult to treat explicitly . for 3-dimensional system as shown in fig.1(b ) , the hamiltonian in the cycle 1 is @xmath19.\\ ] ] although the time evolution operator can be generally factorized in the form @xmath20,\\ ] ] where @xmath21 s are a basis of lie algebra @xmath22 ( or su(3 ) if @xmath23 is traceless ) , according to wei - norman theorem @xcite , the functions @xmath24 satisfy a set of non - linear equations and are difficult to find explicitly . in sec.v , we present an explicit approach to obtain the time evolution operator .",
    "( system ii ) , and 3-dimensional system with equal energy gaps ( system iii ) . here",
    "the arrows represent transitions caused by control field and the numbers in circles are labels of cycle . , width=264 ]      in this paper , we shall use square pulses to control the quantum systems .",
