    "the suita conjecture @xcite asks about the precise relations between the bergman kernel and the logarithmic capacity . for potential - theoretically hyperbolic riemann surfaces ,",
    "it is conjectured that the gaussian curvature of the suita metric is bounded from above by @xmath0 .",
    "the relations between the suita conjecture and the @xmath1 extension theorem were first observed in @xcite and later contributed by several mathematicians .",
    "the suita conjecture proves to be true for potential - theoretically hyperbolic riemann surfaces ( see @xcite ) , and it might be interesting to generalize similar results to potential - theoretically ` non`-hyperbolic cases . in this direction , for general compact riemann surfaces",
    "we have the following result .",
    "[ compact ] let @xmath2 be a connected compact riemann surface of genus @xmath3 let @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 be its bergman kernel , arakelov - green function and arakelov metric , respectively",
    ". in the local coordinate @xmath7 , write @xmath8 and @xmath9 . finally let @xmath10 then , for any @xmath11 , it follows that @xmath12    on the one hand , this result indicates an upper bound of the arakelov metric s gaussian curvature .",
    "for the genus one case the author in @xcite computed via elliptic functions the above left hand side and obtained a sharp positive lower bound which is less than @xmath13 . on the other hand , for a once - punctured complex torus which is a typical example of potential - theoretically parabolic riemann surfaces , we construct the so - called evans - selberg potential and therefore derive the fundamental metric .",
    "[ punctured ] let @xmath14 be a once - punctured complex torus .",
    "let @xmath15 and @xmath16 be its bergman kernel and fundamental metric , respectively . in the local coordinate @xmath17 ,",
    "write @xmath18 and @xmath19 . then",
    ", as @xmath20 , it follows that @xmath21    moreover , we study the degenerate case when a once - punctured complex torus becomes a singular curve and obtain the following result .",
    "[ degenerate ] under the same assumptions as in theorem 1.2 , as @xmath22 it follows that @xmath23    either theorem 1.2 or theorem 1.3 implies that the gaussian curvature the of fundamental metric on @xmath24 can be arbitrarily close to @xmath25 , which is different from the potential - theoretically hyperbolic case .",
    "the gaussian curvature of the fundamental metric on a once - punctured complex torus can not be bounded from above by a negative constant .",
    "let @xmath2 be a connected compact riemann surface of genus @xmath26 whose bergman kernel in the local coordinate @xmath7 is written as @xmath8 .",
    "then the arakelov - green function @xmath27 on @xmath2 with a pole @xmath17 satisfies the equation @xcite @xmath28    with the above notations , the arakelov metric on @xmath2 under the local coordinate @xmath17 is defined as @xmath29    the arakelov metric has a characterizing property that its gaussian curvature form is proportional to the bergman kernel @xcite .",
    "next , we recall the definition of the so - called fundamental metric , which is a non - compact counterpart of the arakelov metric . for a potential - theoretically hyperbolic riemann surface ,",
    "the fundamental metric is just the suita metric .    on a potential - theoretically parabolic riemann surface @xmath30 ,",
    "the fundamental metric under the local coordinate @xmath7 is defined as @xmath31 where @xmath32 is an evans - selberg potential on @xmath30 with a pole @xmath17 .    for general potential - theoretically parabolic riemann surfaces ,",
    "it is known ( see @xcite ) that the gaussian curvature form of the fundamental metric is @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the coefficient of the bergman kernel @xmath35-form under the local coordinate @xmath7 . for a compact complex torus @xmath36 , where @xmath37 and @xmath38 , its bergman kernel by definition is @xmath39 where @xmath7 is the local coordinate induced from the complex plane @xmath40 .",
    "a once - punctured complex torus @xmath14 is an open riemann surface obtained by removing one single point @xmath41 from a compact complex torus @xmath42 .",
    "[ a complex torus ] the arakelov - green function on a complex torus @xmath42 defined as above with a pole @xmath17 satisfies the equation @xmath43 and can be expressed via the theta function as @xmath44 here @xmath45 and @xmath46 for @xmath47 . in this case",
    ", it is possible to compare the bergman kernel and the arakelov metric .",
    "instead of using programming to numerically approximate the lower bound as in @xcite , the gaussian curvature of the arakelov metric can be computed by _ mathematica _ ( version 10.3 ) .    [",
    "proof of theorem 1.1 ] the argument follows almost the same as berndtsson - lempert s method @xcite by taking sub - level sets of the arakelov - green function and consider variations of the bergman kernels .",
    "specifically , for any fixed @xmath11 consider @xmath48 and denote the bergman kernel on @xmath49 by @xmath50 near the pole @xmath17 . using the semipositivity properties of the direct image bundles and combining the asymptotics at @xmath51 , one gets that @xmath52 is a convex increasing function in @xmath53 and then @xmath54 holds for all @xmath55 in particular , ( 3.3 ) is true for @xmath56 and @xmath57    in general , the right hand side of can be smaller than @xmath13 , if @xmath58 , i.e. the arakelov - green function can be positive at some cases .",
    "this is different from the potential - theoretically hyperbolic case where the green function is always less than @xmath59 in the interior .",
    "for the same reason , it is not clear how to apply berndtsson - lempert s method to the potential - theoretically parabolic case , since an evans - selberg potential tends to @xmath60 near the boundary .",
    "recently , the author was kindly notified by guan that the bergman kernel for ` pluri`-canonical bundles and the arakelov metric on compact riemann surfaces could be compared by @xmath1 extension theorems ( see @xcite ) .",
    "as a typical example of potential - theoretically parabolic riemann surfaces , @xmath24 admits an evans - selberg potential and we have indeed constructed it .",
    "there exists an evans - selberg potential on @xmath14 with a pole @xmath17 given by @xmath61 for @xmath62    _ proof . _",
    "we see that the two terms on the right hand side of are responsible for the two terms on the right hand side of , respectively . keeping this in mind",
    ", we can construct the evans - selberg potential by attaching physics meanings .",
    "we regard the potential as an electric flux generated at the pole @xmath17 and terminates at the boundary point @xmath41 ( see @xcite for detailed physics explanations ) .",
    "therefore , the evans - selberg potential @xmath63 with a pole @xmath17 satisfies that @xmath64 and can be expressed via the theta function as @xmath65    there exists a fundamental metric @xmath16 on @xmath14 under the local coordinate @xmath17 given by @xmath66    _ proof .",
    "_ this can be verified by definition , since @xmath67    by the second equality above , @xmath16 has the following asymptotic behavior , which will yield theorem 1.2 for any fixed @xmath68 .    under the same assumptions as in theorem 4.2 , as @xmath20 , it follows that @xmath69",
    "by studying the asymptotic behaviors of the fundamental metric under degeneration with respect to the complex structure , we will prove theorem 1.3 .",
    "relating theorem 1.3 with , we further get corollary 1.4 .",
    "[ proof of theorem 1.3 ] let @xmath22 and @xmath70 will tend to @xmath59 .",
    "then , it has @xmath71 therefore , it follows that @xmath72 since the denominator is uniformly bounded by @xmath13 for any fixed @xmath17 .    on the one hand , at the degenerate case of potential - theoretically hyperbolic riemann surfaces , we are not sure whether gaussian curvatures of the suita metrics are still bounded from above by @xmath0 . on the other hand , for a compact complex torus ,",
    "the gaussian curvature of the arakelov metric is always @xmath59 by the genus reason , although our earlier result in @xcite shows that as @xmath22 it has @xmath73          , _ intersection theory of divisors on an arithmetic surface _ ,",
