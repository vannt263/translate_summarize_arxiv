    "neutron stars are at the intersection of astrophysics , gravitational physics and nuclear physics and are thus excellent laboratories for investigating strong gravitational fields and the behavior of matter at very high densities .",
    "isolated neutron stars or binary systems can be a testbed for general relativity ( gr ) and other alternative theories of gravity in the strong field regime , while their oscillations , and binary inspiral and merger phases are central to the current efforts in gravitational wave detection .",
    "successful detections may allow tighter constraints on the equation of state ( eos ) of nuclear matter .",
    "the properties of neutron stars , their spacetime curvature and gravitational wave emission , are ultimately connected to their internal structure . however , at present there are still large uncertainties regarding the properties of matter at very high densities .",
    "some information on the eos can be indirectly extracted from the characteristics of events on the surface of neutron stars and their exterior spacetime using astrophysical observations .",
    "steps in this direction are being taken ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) and future observations of x - ray busters and the properties of accretion disks in low - mass x - ray binaries may allow the determination of the radius of neutron stars with an accuracy of about @xmath7 .",
    "on the other hand , observations of millisecond pulsars in binary systems may allow the measurement of their moment of inertia with similar accuracy ( see * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "furthermore , gravitational wave observations of the inspiral of binary neutron star systems will allow for the measurement of their tidal deformability ( see @xcite and @xcite ) .    in most cases ,",
    "such astrophysical measurements are eos dependent .",
    "this prevents us from accurately determining neutron star properties , such as mass , radius and moment of inertia , or distinguishing between neutron stars and strange stars .",
    "the eos uncertainty does not allow for accurate tests of alternative theories of gravity when the deviations from general relativity are of the same order as the deviations induced by different eos .",
    "the gravitational wave observations of binary inspirals also face certain problems because of the degeneracy between the spins and the quadrupole moments of the neutron stars .",
    "a welcome development in these fields has been the recent discovery of relations between ( normalized expressions of ) the moment of inertia @xmath0 , the quadrupole moment @xmath1 and the tidal love number , by @xcite ( see also @xcite,@xcite ) , which are practically eos independent .",
    "however , these relations were derived only for non - magnetized stars in the slow - rotation and small tidal deformation approximations , and the question of their general validity remained open .",
    "the small tidal deformation approximation was later relaxed by @xcite .",
    "they derived similar universal relations for the different phases of neutron star inspirals and concluded that these relations do not deviate significantly from the small tidal deformation approximation . on the other hand ,",
    "it was shown recently by @xcite , that the universality of the @xmath5love@xmath6 relations is broken for strongly magnetized neutron stars with low rotational frequencies .    here ,",
    "we investigate the effect of rapid rotation on the universality of the @xmath5love@xmath6 relations , by computing the @xmath2 relation for rapidly rotating relativistic stars ( up to the mass - shedding limit ) for a number of different eos .",
    "we show that the eos universality breaks down at fast rotation rates , such as those encountered for the fastest known millisecond pulsars , and the @xmath2 relation departs significantly from its slow rotation limit .",
    "we should note that other universal relations were derived very recently by @xcite which are nearly eos independent for all rotational rates of neutron stars within general relativity .",
    "the eos independence is obtained when using a normalized angular momentum , instead of the spin frequency .",
    "the metric of a stationary and axisymmetric spacetime can be written in the following form : @xmath8 the multipole moments of the spacetime are encoded in the asymptotic expansion ( at large @xmath9 ) of the metric functions @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 . to leading orders : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the gravitational mass",
    ", @xmath16 is the angular momentum , and @xmath17 is a legendre polynomial , while @xmath18 and @xmath19 are expansion coefficients .",
    "the moment of inertia for a uniformly rotating star is @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the angular frequency .",
    "the relativistic quadrupole moment is given by : @xmath22 where @xmath23 .",
    "a detailed derivation of the above formula is given in the book by @xcite and also in the papers by @xcite .",
    "our numerical computation was checked against previous results by @xcite .",
    "we consider models of uniformly rotating stars , obtained with the rns code @xcite .",
    "two classes of eos are examined : hadronic eos , describing neutron stars and the mit bag model of self - bound strange quark matter , describing strange stars .",
    "we choose six representative neutron star eos , which are all in agreement with the observational constraint of a two solar mass static model , and two strange star eos which also nearly or easily satisfy the two solar mass constraint , respectively .",
    "our representative set of hadronic eos are : @xcite ( wff2 ) ; @xcite ( apr ) ; @xcite ( gcp ) and @xcite ( hlps ) , where the @xcite crust eos is used .",
    "furthermore , we include eos l by @xcite , which is one of the stiffest proposed eos , and the zero - temperature limit of the eos by @xcite .",
    "the two strange star eos are taken from @xcite ( denoted by sqsb40 and sqsb60 therein ) .",
    "in accordance with @xcite and @xcite we plot the normalized moment of inertia @xmath24 as a function of the normalized quadrupole moment @xmath25 where @xmath26 . notice that we are using the gravitational mass @xmath15 , which is the natural choice for fast rotating stars . using the mass @xmath27 of a corresponding nonrotating model , as was done by @xcite , might also be relevant for some astrophysical applications , because several empirical relations are available that connect the properties of fast rotating neutron stars ( such as the spin frequency at the mass - shedding limit or the moment of inertia ) to the masses and radii of a nonrotating star ( see * ? ? ?",
    "but , we verified that the latter choice leads to considerably larger deviations from universality for different eos in the rapidly rotating case .",
    "[ fig : i(q)_yy ] summarizes our results for all hadronic eos and for different rotational frequencies @xmath28 .",
    "different colors correspond to different fixed rotational frequencies , while the universal numerical fit ( valid at slow rotation ) derived by @xcite is shown as a solid black line .",
    "the deviations of the numerical results from a fourth - order fit is shown in the lower panel for two representative rotational frequencies  in the slow rotation limit @xmath29 and for @xmath30 , which is only somewhat larger than the spin frequency of the fastest known millisecond pulsar @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "the maximum value of @xmath32 is 0.7 for the whole sample of models shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : i(q)_yy ] .",
    "several qualitative conclusions can be drawn , based on fig .",
    "[ fig : i(q)_yy ] .",
    "most importantly , the @xmath33 relation changes considerably with increasing rotation rate , even for moderately fast rotating neutron stars , such as the fastest rotating millisecond pulsar currently known .",
    "the deviation from universality is thus significant and can reach approximately @xmath3 for the selected hadronic eos for slowly and rapidly rotating models with a fixed value of @xmath34 . ] . on the other hand , even though a universal @xmath33 relation does not exist for rapidly rotating neutron stars , we can consider sequences of fixed rotational frequency . whereas the @xmath33 relation is practically independent of the eos in the slow rotation limit ( less than 160 hz in fig .",
    "[ fig : i(q)_yy ] ) , for higher rotational frequencies the relation becomes more and more eos dependent , and the eos universality is completely lost at rapid rotation .",
    "_ the spread of the data due to different eos is comparable to the spread due to rotation _ and the deviation from a fourth order fit @xmath35 can reach @xmath36 for millisecond pulsars ( lower panel of fig . [",
    "fig : i(q)_yy ] ) .",
    "there is one additional qualitative feature of our results worth mentioning . as we can see in fig .",
    "[ fig : i(q)_yy ] , the spread of the dependences for different equations of state decreases for lower values of @xmath37 and @xmath34 .",
    "also , the differences between the dependences for different rotation rates is smaller in that case .",
    "this is an expected effect , since smaller values of the normalized quantities @xmath37 and @xmath34 correspond to larger masses and compactness , which loosely speaking means that we are approaching the black hole limit , where the @xmath33 relation is independent of the internal structure , as commented by @xcite .     and @xmath38.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]",

    "[ fig : i(q)_fit ] shows that this is indeed the case and the results in table 1 can be used in practice to accurately obtain the @xmath33 dependence ( [ eq : fit ] ) for our _ restricted _ sample of eos at different rotation rates .",
    "the deviation from these approximate fits , defined as @xmath35 , reaches roughly 2% for all frequencies below 500hz and it increases up to 4.5% for the higher rotational rates .",
    "the deviations for the slowly rotating models are mostly due to the error in the approximate fitting formulae ( [ eq : fit ] ) and ( [ eq : fitcoeff ] ) we derive , while for rotational frequencies above a few hundred hz it is caused mainly by the spread of the different eos .",
    "in general the least massive models for each frequency , lead to the largest deviations from the approximate fits .",

    "the relations for neutron stars and for both strange star eos are similar , in accordance with the results in @xcite . however ,",
    "for rapid rotation the deviations from the neutron star case become significant as fig .",
    "[ fig : om_all_qs_multiple ] shows . the two strange star eos lead to very different @xmath33 relations ( distinct data lines of the same color correspond to the two difference strange star eos ) and the deviation of the @xmath33 relation from its slow - rotation limit reaches approximately @xmath4 . as a result ,",
    "it is not possible to derive a single fit of the form given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : fit ] ) ( at a fixed rotation rate ) that would be valid for all strange star eos .",
    "another qualitative difference between neutron stars and strange stars is the following : as we commented above , for neutron star masses near or above @xmath54 the deviation from universality of the @xmath33 relation decreases significantly , i.e. the relation becomes relatively insensitive to the rotational frequency and to the internal structure .",
    "but this is not the case for strange stars  even for masses above @xmath54 , the @xmath33 relations are quite different for different values of @xmath28 , even though they become more insensitive to the strange matter eos .",

    "we have calculated the @xmath33 relation for rapidly rotating neutron stars and strange stars and showed that it differs significantly from the eos - independent relation in the slow - rotation limit found by @xcite .",
    "the deviation from universality can reach about @xmath3 for hadronic eos and about @xmath4 for strange matter eos , and for the fastest spinning pulsars currently known , the deviation is around @xmath55 for the two classes of eos .",
    "the eos - independence of the @xmath56love@xmath57 relations is broken when rapid rotation is considered , because the deviations due to different eos are comparable to the deviations induced by rotation if one considers sequences with fixed rotational frequency . only for a _ restricted _ set of eos , that do not include models with extremely small or large radii ,",
    "were we still able to find relations that are roughly eos - independent at _ fixed rotational frequencies _ , which can be accurately represented by 2nd - order fits .",
    "in addition , we find that the complete rotational dependence of the @xmath33 relation can be well captured , if the coefficients in the 2nd - order fits are represented as a 3rd - order polynomial expansion in the rotational frequency @xmath28 .",
    "one should keep in mind that these fits are valid for our chosen restricted set of eos and if one includes eos that reach more extreme values of the radii , then the relations would change .    for strange stars ,",
    "we find that rapid rotation leads to a completely different @xmath33 relation for different choices of the strange matter eos , thus prohibiting more general fits , such as those for neutron stars",
    ".    our results do not affect the applicability of the @xmath0-love-@xmath1 relations in cases where the slow - rotation approximation is sufficient , such as the inspiral phase of binary neutron star mergers or for the case of some relativistic binaries where the moment of inertia could be measured .",
