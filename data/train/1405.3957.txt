    "physicists are widely convinced now that they have discovered what closely resembles the higgs boson  @xcite postulated in the standard electroweak model ( sm )  @xcite . along with widespread exhilaration",
    ", such a development brings in questions on whether this particle carries some signature of physics beyond the standard model .",
    "many studies in this direction have appeared  @xcite in the context of the large hadron collider ( lhc ) where the data available so far still allow some departure from sm behaviour .",
    "even a finite invisible branching ratio ( @xmath6 ) for the higgs can not , at the moment , be ruled out  @xcite .",
    "the issue can be probed through careful measurements of the couplings of the higgs ( or higgs - like scalar ) to various pairs of sm particles . among them , the couplings to pairs of vector bosons ( @xmath7 ) are measured in a relatively more reliable manner .",
    "this possibility has been explained in the context of an @xmath8 collider too  @xcite .    in view of the cumulative demand for a closer probe on the @xmath7 couplings ( and of course",
    "the couplings to other sm particles ) , the most desirable endeavour , however , is to build an electron - positron collider which provides a clean environment for precise measurements of higgs interaction strengths .",
    "the first step is of course to develop a higgs factory ( at @xmath9 250 - 300 gev ) .",
    "such a machine will not only produce the higgs boson copiously near resonance , but is also the first step before an @xmath0 machine at even higher energies is developed . in this paper , we incorporate some observations regarding the signatures of anomalous @xmath7 couplings , manifest through higher dimensional operators ( hdos ) , at a higgs factory .",
    "other studies performed for an @xmath10 machine can be found in  @xcite .",
    "if the couplings arise through physics at a scale higher than that of electroweak symmetry breaking , then the resulting higher - dimensional effective interactions are expected to be gauge invariant .",
    "such interactions have not only been identified , but constraints on their coefficients have also been obtained from the lhc data  @xcite . in view of such analyses ,",
    "the coefficients are often restricted to such values where many cherished kinematic distributions may fail to reveal their footprints . in the current study",
    ", we point out some features which influence the detectability ( or otherwise ) of the higher - dimensional couplings at a higgs factory . at the same time",
    ", we emphasise some possible measurements that can elicit their signatures even for relatively small coefficients of such operators .",
    "we concentrate on two higgs production channels , namely , @xmath11 ( the @xmath2-channel process ) and @xmath12 ( the @xmath3-channel process , which we separate with the help of a simple kinematic cut around the higgs boson energy ) . in principle",
    ", the hdos that will constitute our report can influence the rates in both channels .",
    "in contrast , the most obvious kinematic distributions , namely , those based on the angular dependence of matrix elements , drawn with moderate values of their coefficients do not show a perceptible difference with respect to the sm situation . keeping this in view ,",
    "we underscore the following points here :    1 .",
    "the @xmath2-channel process has substantial rates at @xmath13 300 gev or thereabout .",
    "we show , through an analysis of the production amplitude squared , why one can not expect significantly different angular distributions in this channel at such energies , if one uses moderate values of the operator coefficients .",
    "2 .   the @xmath3-channel process can have appreciable production rates at high energies ( @xmath14 a tev ) , too .",
    "because of the production of two neutrinos in the final state , this process provides limited phase - space for the exploration of the tensor structure of the @xmath5 coupling .",
    "here it is attempted to exploit the full kinematics of the higgs boson by means of a correlated two - dimensional likelihood analysis .",
    "3 .   we show that , given such impediment , it is possible to uncover signatures of the aforementioned bsm operators through measurements of rates at two different energies , which also cancels many systematic uncertainties . in general ,",
    "the energy dependence of the rates can be sensitive to anomalous couplings .",
    "the very fact that the additional operators should be electroweak gauge invariant imply not only higher - dimensional @xmath7 interactions ( @xmath15 ) but also anomalous @xmath16 interactions ( @xmath17 ) whose strengths are related to the former . we show that the concomitant variations in higgs production and w - pair production at higgs factories may elicit the presence of such bsm interactions .",
    "we also show that if the centre - of - mass energy ( cme ) of the colliding particles is @xmath18 gev or more , then even moderate values of the operator coefficients can show some differences in the kinematic distributions . 6 .",
    "lastly , we perform the analysis in a framework that allows one to retain all the gauge - invariant operators at the same time .",
    "we summarise the gauge invariant couplings in the next section , and subsequently point out the ` phenomenological ' anomalous couplings they lead to . in section  [ sec : pheno ] , we take up the @xmath2 and @xmath3-channel higgs production cross - sections in turn , and explain why one can not expect too much out of kinematic distributions at higgs factory energies , so long as the bsm coupling coefficients are subject to constraints imposed by the lhc data . their detectable signatures through event ratios at two energies , and also via the simultaneous measurement of @xmath4-pair production",
    "are predicted in section  [ sec : pheno ] .",
    "a likelihood analysis and some related issues , mostly in terms of the phenomenological forms to which all new couplings reduce , are found in section  [ sec : likelihood ] .",
    "we summarise our conclusions in section  [ sec : disc ] .",
    "in this paper , we adopt two types of effective lagrangian parametrizations which are commonly used in the literature to probe the anomalous @xmath7 ( where @xmath19 ) interactions . in one parametrization , we take the most general set of dimension-6 gauge invariant operators which give rise to such anomalous @xmath7 interactions . in the other one , we parametrize the @xmath7 vertices with the most general lorentz invariant structure .",
    "although , this formalism is not the most transparent one from the viewpoint of the gauge structure of the theory , it is rather simple and more experiment - friendly . both formalisms modify the @xmath7 vertices by introducing non - standard momentum - dependent terms .",
    "we assume that the sm is a low - energy effective theory of a more complete perturbation theory valid below a cut - off scale @xmath20 . in the present study",
    ", we are concerned mainly with the higgs sector .",
    "the first order corrections to the higgs sector will come from gauge invariant dimension 6 operators as there is only one dimension-5 operator which contributes to the neutrino masses .",
    "the relevant additional lorentz structures in @xmath7 interactions are necessarily of dimensions higher than four .",
    "if they arise as a consequence of integrating out physics at a higher scale , all such operators will have to be invariant under @xmath21 .",
    "a general classification of such operators is found in the literature  @xcite .",
    "the lowest order cp - conserving operators which are relevant for higgs phenomenology are    * the operators containing the higgs doublet @xmath22 and its derivatives : @xmath23 * the operators containing the higgs doublet @xmath22 ( or its derivatives ) and bosonic field strengths : @xmath24 @xmath25    where @xmath26 and @xmath27 and @xmath28 , @xmath29 are respectively the @xmath30 and @xmath31 gauge couplings .",
    "@xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "the higgs doublet is denoted by @xmath22 and its covariant derivative is given as @xmath35 .",
    "following are the properties of the aforementioned hdos :    * @xmath36 : does not preserve custodial symmetry and is therefore severely constrained by the @xmath37-parameter ( or equivalently the @xmath38 parameter ) .",
    "it modifies the sm @xmath39 and @xmath5 couplings by unequal multiplicative factors .",
    "* @xmath40 : preserves custodial symmetry and modifies the sm @xmath39 and @xmath5 couplings by multiplicative factors .",
    "this operator modifies the higgs self - interaction as well . *",
    "@xmath41 : modifies only the higgs self - interaction .",
    "* @xmath42 : introduces @xmath43 coupling which is same in structure as the sm effective @xmath43 coupling .",
    "since our discussion is limited to the context of an @xmath10 collider and as we will also not consider the gluonic decay mode of the higgs , we will not discuss this operator any further .",
    "* @xmath44 : drives the tree - level @xmath45 mixing and is therefore highly constrained by the electroweak precision test ( ewpt ) data  @xcite .",
    "* @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 : modifies the @xmath7 couplings by introducing new lorentz structure in the lagrangian .",
    "they are not severely constrained by the ewpt data@xcite .",
    "hence for the higgs sector , we will choose our basis as @xmath50 .",
    "in the presence of the above operators , the lagrangian is parametrised as @xmath51    where @xmath52 is the scale factor of the sm - like coupling , something which needs to be accounted for when considering bsm physics .",
    "@xmath53 is a dimensionless coefficient which denotes the strength of the @xmath54 operator and @xmath20 is the cut - off scale above which new physics must appear .",
    "we keep @xmath52 to be the same for the @xmath5 and @xmath39 couplings so that there is no unacceptable contribution to the @xmath38-parameter .",
    "another operator considered in this work is @xmath55 $ ] .",
    "this only affects the triple gauge boson couplings and does not affect the higgs sector .",
    "+ the effective lagrangian which affects the higgs sector is @xmath56 where @xmath57 with @xmath58 being the sine ( cosine ) of the weinberg angle .",
    "the operators @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 contribute to the anomalous triple gauge boson interactions .",
    "the interactions can be summarised as @xmath62 where @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 with @xmath67    the limits on these operators have been derived in many references .",
    "the most comprehensive of these are listed in references  @xcite .",
    "these operators , even within their current limits , have been shown to modify the efficiencies of the various selection cuts for the relevant final states in the context of the lhc  @xcite .",
    "all of the aforementioned hdos lead essentially to one effective coupling ( each for @xmath5 and @xmath39 ) , when @xmath68-violation is neglected .",
    "these can be alternatively used in a phenomenological way for example , the @xmath69 vertex can be parametrised as @xcite : @xmath70 where deviations from the sm form of @xmath71 would indicate the presence of bsm physics .",
    "these bsm deviations , including @xmath68-violating ones ( not considered among the gauge invariant operators ) , can be specified as @xmath72,\\ ] ] where @xmath73 and @xmath74 are the effective strengths for the anomalous cp - conserving and cp - violating operators respectively .",
    "precise identification of the non - vanishing nature of @xmath75 is a challenging task .",
    "if ever accomplished , it can tell us whether the modification in @xmath7-couplings are @xmath68-conserving or @xmath68-violating in nature and , if both are present , what their relative proportion is .",
    "here we analyse the process @xmath76 and see if there is any bsm physics involved by incorporating a likelihood analysis of the sm hypothesis tested against bsm hypotheses .",
    "a few comments are in order on the two ways of parametrizing the anomalous higgs couplings .",
    "the latter , of course , encapsulates all possible modified lorentz invariant couplings in the lowest possible order , including both @xmath68-conserving and @xmath68-violating ones , in the coefficients @xmath77 and @xmath78 respectively .",
    "all of the anomalous @xmath5 and @xmath39 couplings listed in the gauge - invariant formulation reduce basically to one term if one confines oneself to a @xmath68-conserving scenario .",
    "thus we can say that the latter parametrization shows us a rather ` economic ' way of relating the anomalous @xmath7 interactions to collider phenomenology .",
    "on the other hand , the process of relating the anomalous couplings to specific effective interactions is more transparent from the viewpoint of gauge structures when one uses the gauge invariant hdos .",
    "it paves an easier path towards understanding the ultraviolet completion of the scenario .",
    "in addition to this , the formulation in terms of gauge - invariant operators relates the anomalous @xmath5 and @xmath39 interactions .",
    "one finds , in this way , a pattern in the departure of the @xmath79 and @xmath80 final state production rates from the corresponding sm prediction . finally , some of the gauge - invariant operators lead simultaneously to anomalous triple gauge boson interactions",
    ". there is thus an associated variation in the @xmath79 , @xmath80 and @xmath81 production rates as well as in the kinematic distributions associated with each final state .",
    "such an association enables one to use various pieces of data to determine each new operator .",
    "in this section , we discuss various important higgs production mechanisms through @xmath7 vertices at an @xmath10 collider . for the collider phenomenology , we have implemented the lagrangians of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : laghvv ] )  and  ( [ eq : lagwwv ] ) in ` feynrules `  @xcite to generate ` universal feynrules model ( ufo ) `  @xcite files suitable for interfacing with ` madgraph `  @xcite .",
    "we also use ` form `  @xcite to compute many cross - sections analytically .",
    "we concentrate on two main higgs production mechanisms _ viz .",
    "_ @xmath82 and @xmath83 , at an @xmath10 collider with energies ranging from 250 gev to 500 gev .",
    "the @xmath82 channel includes only the @xmath2-channel processes ",
    "@xmath84 ( shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fd](a ) ) .",
    "whereas @xmath85 includes both the @xmath2-channel processes , @xmath86 as well as the @xmath3-channel process @xmath87",
    "( @xmath88 fusion process as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fd](b ) ) .",
    "the @xmath2 and @xmath3-channel processes have different kinematics and hence are affected differently by the inclusion of the hdos .",
    "moreover , the @xmath3-channel process allows us to explore the tensor structure of the @xmath5 vertex alone , free from any contamination from the @xmath39 and @xmath89 vertices . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath2-channel process is free from any contamination due to the @xmath5 vertex .",
    "hence , the measurement of the @xmath2-channel contribution will shed light on the tensorial nature of the @xmath39 and @xmath89 vertices .",
    "we , therefore , analyse the @xmath2 and @xmath3-channel processes separately to shed more light on the anomalous behaviour of the @xmath7 vertices .",
    "we separate the @xmath2-channel ( @xmath3-channel ) contribution from the @xmath90 events by applying a simple kinematic cut on the higgs energy ( @xmath91 ) as follows : @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the cme of the two colliding @xmath10 beams and @xmath94 is an energy - window around @xmath91 . here , @xmath95-cut is complementary to the @xmath91-cut .",
    "we use @xmath96 gev throughout our analysis   can be estimated from the energy uncertainties of the @xmath97-jets coming from the higgs decay . the jet energy uncertainty @xmath98 ( 1@xmath99 ) of a jet having energy @xmath100 are related as , @xmath101 at the ilc  @xcite .",
    "for example , if there are two @xmath97-jets each with energy 100 gev , the total uncertainty in their energy measurement is @xmath102 gev ( added in quadrature ) . ] .",
    "we must mention here that for the rest of this paper the @xmath2-channel process will be studied at the @xmath79 level without any cuts , unless otherwise specified .",
    "one can easily get an estimate of the cross - section for any decay modes of @xmath103 by multiplying the appropriate br .",
    "this is because for the @xmath104 channel , a simple invariant mass cut on the two leptons about the @xmath103 boson mass will separate the @xmath2-channel to a very high degree . for @xmath105 , on the other hand , the cut on @xmath91 separates the @xmath2 and @xmath3-channels . the @xmath2-channel contribution surviving the cut",
    "is found to be very close to what one would have found from the rate for @xmath106 , through a scaling of brs .",
    "one is thus confident that the @xmath91-cut is effective in minimising mutual contamination of the @xmath2 and @xmath3-channel contributions .",
    "it should also be mentioned here that the effects of beam energy spread are not taken into account in eq .",
    "[ eq : stcut ] for simplification .",
    "while we present the basic ideas of distinguishing anomalous interactions of the higgs , the relevant energy window for precision studies has to factor in the effects of bremsstrahlung as well as beamstrahlung ( depending on whether the higgs factory is a circular or a linear collider ) .",
    ".[tab : sigst ] we show the total @xmath80 cross - section ( @xmath107 ) , only @xmath2-channel cross - section ( @xmath108 ) , only @xmath3-channel cross - section ( @xmath109 ) and their interference contribution ( @xmath110 ) for the sm ( @xmath111 ) and for hdo benchmark point bp1 ( @xmath112 ) for two different cmes .",

    "all the numbers have been multiplied by @xmath122 .",
    "we see that the effects of the invariant mass selection cuts on the signal cross - sections are negligible whereas these are very effective in reducing the backgrounds almost completely .",

    "shower , hadronization and detector effects are expected to have an impact on the effective cross - sections reported in table  [ tab : bkg ] .",
    "that said , these effects will not change the conclusions of the paper .",
    "the kinematics of the final state associated to the @xmath2-channel production has been studied extensively in the past . as pointed out in section  [ sec : intro ] , the @xmath3-channel production provides limited phase - space because the momenta of the outgoing neutrinos can not be disentangled experimentally .",
    "this leaves the higgs boson kinematics as the only handle to explore the nature of the @xmath5 coupling .",
    "studies are documented in the literature with the use of the higgs boson momentum as a means to gain sensitivity . here",

    "<S> probing signatures of anomalous interactions of the higgs boson with pairs of weak vector bosons is an important goal of an @xmath0 collider commissioned as a higgs factory . </S>",
    "<S> we perform a detailed analysis of such potential of a collider operating at @xmath1 gev . mostly using higher dimensional operators in a gauge - invariant framework , </S>",
    "<S> we show that substantial information on anomalous couplings can be extracted from the total rates of @xmath2-and @xmath3-channel higgs production . </S>",
    "<S> the most obvious kinematic distributions , based on angular dependence of matrix elements , are relatively less sensitive with moderate coefficients of anomalous couplings , unless one goes to higher centre - of - mass energies . </S>",
    "<S> some important quantities to use here , apart from the total event rates , are the ratios of event rates at different energies , ratios of @xmath2-and @xmath3-channel rates at fixed energies , and under some fortunate circumstances , the correlated changes in the rates for @xmath4-boson pair - production . </S>",
    "<S> a general scheme of calculating rates with as many as four gauge - invariant operators is also outlined . at the end </S>",
    "<S> , we perform a likelihood analysis using phenomenological parametrization of anomalous @xmath5 interaction , and indicate their distinguishability for illustrative values of the strength of such interactions . </S>"
