    "according to the standard unification model , seyfert 1 and 2 galaxies ( sy1s and sy2s hereafter ) are intrinsically the same objects and the absence of broad lines in sy2s is ascribed to the obscuration by a pc - scale dusty torus oriented along the line of sight ( see the reviews by antonucci @xcite and vron - cetty & vron @xcite ) .",
    "the observational evidence for this model includes the detection of polarized broad emission lines in some seyfert 2 galaxies ( antonucci & miller @xcite ; tran @xcite ; moran et al .",
    "@xcite ) , the detection of broad lines in the infrared spectrum of some sy2s ( ruiz et al",
    ". @xcite ; veilleux et al . @xcite ; rix et al .",
    "@xcite ) and the detection of a prominent photoelectric cutoff in the x - ray spectra of sy2s indicating the presence of large columns of gas along the line of sight ( koyama et al .",

    "the spectropolarimetric observations of different samples of seyfert 2 galaxies indicate that _ only _ about 40 % of sy2s show broad lines in their polarized spectra ( eg .",
    "heisler et al .",
    "@xcite ) , although such surveys are probably biased since pre - selection was done according to the broad - band polarization .    according to the suggestion of heisler et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , the detectability of a hidden blr through spetropolarimetry in sy2s is related to the inclination of the torus which , in turn , is related to the 60 @xmath1 m to 25 @xmath1 m flux ratio , @xmath2 .",
    "more specifically , in those sy2s showing polarized broad lines ( pbl ) the torus should be oriented more face - on so that the scattering medium is less obscured by the torus itself .",
    "this model would also explain the correlation between ir colors ( @xmath2 ) and detectability of the pbl .",
    "in particular , when the torus is observed close to pole - on , the pbl should be more easy to detect and the ir color should be hotter since we are observing the hotter dust emitting region , in agreement with what is observed .    however , more recently alexander ( @xcite ) compared the absorbing column densities inferred from the hard x - rays with the detectability of the pbl and found no correlation .",
    "this result is in contrast with heisler s et al .",
    "( @xcite ) model , which would predict a higher absorbing column for sy2s without pbl .",
    "alexander ( @xcite ) suggests that the relation between detectability of the pbl and ir colors is indirect : the contribution from the host galaxy would both make the ir color cooler and would also dilute the nuclear optical spectrum making more difficult the detection of scattered polarized light .",
    "the simple model of the obscuring torus has been subject to various modifications . in particular , while the pc - scale torus is probably responsible for the huge absorbing columns ( @xmath0  @xmath3 @xmath4 ) observed in several sy2s , observational evidence was also found for a larger scale ( @xmath5 100 pc ) obscuring medium with lower absorbing column density ( @xmath0  @xmath5 a few times @xmath6 @xmath4 , granato et al .",

    "we expand the work done by alexander ( @xcite ) by enlarging the sample of sy2s for which information on both the absorbing @xmath0  and on the detection of pbl is available .",
    "we also seek additional constraints on the nature of the circumnuclear scattering and absorbing medium by comparing the mid- and far - ir colors with @xmath0  and the detectability of pbl with the nuclear morphology and with the radio power .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we present our sample of seyfert 2 galaxies with spectropolarimetric observations , the results are given in section 3 .",

    "we show the histogram distribution of column densities for sy2s without and with pbl in figs . 1a and 1b , respectively .",
    "since there are 6 censored data ( lower limits ) among sy2s with pbl and 11 among sy2s without pbl , we need to use the survival analysis methods ( asurv rev 1.2 , isobe , feigelson & nelson @xcite ) to study the similarity of these two samples .",
    "we find that the probability for these two samples to be extracted from the same parent population is about 12 % , and the mean values of log  @xmath0  ( in units of @xmath4 ) are 23.6 @xmath28 0.2 and 24.2 @xmath28 0.2 , respectively .",
    "this result suggests that sy2s with pbl are affected by lower obscuration than sy2s without pbl , but the statistical significance of the result is not high , and therefore not conclusive .      in figure 2",

    "however , we do not find any correlation between the @xmath29 color and the absorbing @xmath0 , at variance with what is expected from the model proposed by heisler et al .",

    "3 is a plot similar to fig .  2 , but where the ir color is sampled at shorter wavelengths and , more specifically , the ratio @xmath29 is replaced by @xmath31 .",
    "this ratio should be more sensitive to absorption of the inner ( hotter ) dust component . in this case",
    "there is a marginal evidence that sy2s with @xmath0  @xmath32 @xmath4 have warmer colors .",
    "yet , the relation between @xmath31 color and @xmath0  is not the one expected from the absorption by a dusty screen associated to the gaseous column observed in the x - rays , assuming a galactic gas - to - dust ratio and extinction curve .",
    "such a relation is given by the following formula :    @xmath33    where @xmath34 is the intrinsic color prior to absorption and where we assumed    @xmath35    and @xmath36    ( bohlin et al .",
    "@xcite ) . to estimate the intrinsic @xmath31 color",
    ", we selected all of the seyfert 1 galaxies listed in the vron - cetty & vron ( @xcite ) catalog with available iras fluxes and we derived a mean value of @xmath37 . therefore , within the framework of the unified model we assigned this value to @xmath38 in equation 1 .",
    "the resulting curve is shown in fig .  3 with a dot - dashed line , which may match the observational data for low @xmath0  ( @xmath39 @xmath4 ) , but fails to account for the majority of the sources at higher columns .",
    "this finding indicates that the observed distribution of ir colors is not to be ascribed to different degrees of absorption ( at least for @xmath0  @xmath40 @xmath4 ) .",
    "hst images of a large sample of seyfert galaxies have shown that seyfert 2 galaxies are characterized by dust lanes or irregular dust distribution crossing the nuclear region more often than sy1s .",
    "based on these results , malkan et al .",
    "( @xcite ) suggested that 100pc - scale dusty structures may play a role in the obscuration that generally affects sy2s .",
    "as summarized in maiolino ( @xcite ) the presence of a 100pc - scale obscuring medium in sy2s is supported by various pieces of evidence , but most likely such a large scale medium contributes to the absorption only with `` moderate '' gas columns ( less than a few times 10@xmath41 @xmath4 ) .    among all of the seyfert 2 galaxies imaged by malkan et al .",
    "( @xcite ) we searched those observed in spectropolarimetry and found 32 of them .",
    "out of these 32 sy2s , 12 have pbl and 20 do not have pbl .",
    "30% of the sy2s without pbl are characterized by ( large scale ) dust lanes crossing the nuclear region or irregular nuclear dust distribution ( according to the classification given in malkan et al .",
    "@xcite ) while none of the sy2s with pbl show evidence for dusty nuclear features .",
    "this suggests that , at least in some cases , obscuration due to 100pc - scale dusty structures is responsible for hiding the mirror which reflects the broad lines .",
    "it is well known that a tight correlation exists between radio and far - ir ( fir ) emission for normal , starburst and seyfert galaxies ( the latter with larger scatter ) ( helou et al .",
    "@xcite ) . more recently ,",
    "( @xcite ) have studied the radio  fir relation of liners and found that the agn and starburst  supported liners can be distinguished on this diagram , with the agn  dominated ones being scattered in the region with higher radio fluxes with respect to the starburst / normal galaxies correlation . in fig .",
    "4 we show the radio vs. fir diagram for the sy2s observed in spectropolarimetry .",
    "the sy2s with pbl are spread mostly above the standard starburst correlation ( dashed line ) , indicating the presence of an extra contribution to the radio emission due to the agn . instead ,",
    "sy2s without pbl follow more tightly the starburst correlation , suggesting that in these objects the starburst component dominates both the fir and the radio emission .",
    "our finding that the absorbing column density ( @xmath0 ) is marginally lower in sy2s with pbl than in sy2s without pbl is tentatively in favor of heisler s et al .",
    "( @xcite ) model , which associates the visibility of the pbl with the amount of obscuration along the line of sight , though the statistical significance of the result is not high .",
    "yet , the interpretation of the correlation between detectability of pbl and ir colors given by heisler et al . is not supported by our results .",
    "they ascribe the colder ir colors observed in objects without pbl to the larger obscuration affecting the mid - ir emitting region .",
    "the mismatch between the expected and the observed ir colors in figs .",
    "23 indicates that the ir colors are unrelated to the obscuration affecting the active nucleus .",
    "there are various possible scenarios ( not necessarily alternative ) to explain such a mismatch . for a galactic gas - to - dust ratio and extinction curve , at 12@xmath1 m the extinction implied by a column larger than @xmath42 @xmath4 is higher than 2 mag , implying that in this case the 12@xmath1 m radiation is heavily suppressed and , therefore , the observed radiation is probably dominated by the host galaxy ( especially in the large iras beam ) .",
    "it is worth noting that at @xmath0  @xmath43 @xmath4 the 25@xmath1m/12@xmath1 m color is lower ( i.e. hotter ) and follows the relation expected by the reddened sy1 curve ( dot - dashed curve in fig .",
    "3 ) . indeed",
    ", in this range of low @xmath0   the absorbing medium is more transparent to the 12@xmath1 m radiation and might well dominate over the emission from the host galaxy . at longer wavelengths ( 25@xmath1 m and 60@xmath1 m )",
    "the dust extinction is much reduced and the emitting region is much more extended . in particular , at large gaseous columns",
    "( @xmath0  @xmath3 @xmath4 ) the medium responsible for absorption must be very compact ( @xmath44 10 pc ) , not to violate constraints on the gas mass given by the dynamical mass ( risaliti et al .",
    "@xcite , maiolino @xcite ) ; as a consequence , in many cases ( at least in the compton thick sources ) the obscuring medium is smaller than the dusty emitting region responsible for the 25@xmath1 m and 60@xmath1 m radiation ( 10 - 100 pc ) .",
    "therefore , the scatter in the 60@xmath1m/25@xmath1 m color probably reflects mostly variations in the relative contribution of the agn ( hotter ) and starburst / galactic ( colder ) component to the ir radiation , as suggested by alexander ( @xcite ) , although some obscuration effect on the 25@xmath1 m emission might be present .",
    "these findings confirm and strengthen the result obtained by alexander ( @xcite ) that the relation between visibility of pbl and ir colors is mostly due to the relative dominance of agn and starburst / galactic component ; in the sense that the latter both makes the ir colors cooler and dilutes the optical light making more difficult the detection of the pbl .",
    "this scenario is further supported by the finding that sy2s without pbl follow the same radio - fir correlation as starbursts ( sect.3.4 ) .",
    "yet , we find that , although the relation between pbl detectability and ir colors is mostly related to the relative contribution of the starburst / galactic component , the detectability of the pbl is also affected , to a lower extent , by the obscuration toward the nuclear region .",
    "this is indicated by the larger average @xmath0   and by the higher incidence of nuclear dusty features in sy2s without pbl .",
    "given the limited statistical significance of these findings ( @xmath5 90% for the difference in @xmath0  distribution ) it is not surprising that such a trend was not found by alexander ( @xcite ) which used a much smaller sample of objects .    within the context of the relation between detectability of pbl and dominance of the starburst component ,",
    "there is a possible explanation , alternative to the dilution of the optical light by the host galaxy suggested by alexander ( @xcite ) , and which might apply to some of the objects without pbl .",
    "some authors have suggested the existence of a dichotomy in sy2s where , at variance with the commonly accepted unified scenario , a fraction of the sy2s do not host a hidden sy1 nucleus but are intrinsically different , such objects would be `` pure '' seyfert 2 galaxies ( hutchings & neff @xcite ; neff & hutchings @xcite ; heckman et al .",
    "@xcite ; dultzin@xmath45hacyan et al .",
    "@xcite ; gu et al .",
    "@xcite ) . in particular",
    "the finding that the bolometric luminosity of some objects with a sy2 spectrum is dominated by a nuclear starburst prompted heckman et al .",
    "( @xcite , @xcite ) to argue that some extreme starburst population might mimic the narrow line spectrum of agns ( partly supporting the model of terlevich et al .",
    "@xcite ) . within this scenario ,",
    "the relation between detectability of pbl and ir colors is trivial : some of the sy2s with starburst - like cooler ir colors do not show evidence for pbl because the broad line region is absent .",
    "in this paper , we collect 40 seyfert 2 galaxies having both spectropolarimetric observations and a measure of the absorbing @xmath0  obtained by means of their x - ray spectrum . out of these 40 objects",
    "22 show broad lines in polarization ( most likely ascribed to scattering of the broad line region ) and 18 do not . for these objects we also analyzed the relation of @xmath0  and detectability of the broad lines with the mid- and far - ir colors .",
    "we confirm previous claims that sy2s without polarized broad lines have cooler ir colors .",
    "we studied additional diagrams to test two scenarios proposed to explain such a correlation and that , more specifically , ascribe this effect either to obscuration of the nuclear region or to the contribution / dilution from circumnuclear starburst activity and from the host galaxy .",
    "we found a marginal evidence for sy2s showing broad lines in polarization to have lower @xmath0  .",
    "we also find that about 30% of the sy2s without polarized broad lines show dust lanes crossing the nucleus , while none of the sy2s with polarized broad lines show evidence for such nuclear dusty structures .",
    "these results suggest that the obscuration towards the nuclear regions ( hence towards the scattering mirror ) plays a role in hiding the polarized broad lines , at least in some objects .    on the other hand",
    ", we find that the absorbing column density does not correlate with the ir colors and , in particular , these quantities do not follow the relation expected in the case of absorption of the ir emitting region by the dust associated to the observed @xmath0 , therefore indicating that the distribution of ir colors is not to be ascribed to obscuration effects .",
    "also , we find that sy2s without detection of polarized broad lines follow the same radio  fir relation as normal and starburst galaxies , at variance with sy2s with polarized broad lines which tend to spread towards higher radio luminosities .",
    "these findings support previous claims that the relation between far - ir colors and detectability of the polarized broad lines in sy2s is mostly related to dilution of the ir and optical light by a circumnuclear starburst or by the host galaxy .    summarizing ,",
    "our results indicate that the lack of broad lines in the polarized spectrum of sy2s is mostly due to the contribution / dilution from the stellar component , though at a lower extent the obscuration towards the nuclear region also plays a role .",
