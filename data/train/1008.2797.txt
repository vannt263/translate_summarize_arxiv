    "discovering this warm - hot intergalactic medium ( whim ) is one of the main science drivers for the _ cosmic origins spectrograph _ ( cos ) on @xmath17 @xcite .    currently , uv absorption line spectroscopy is the most promising observational technique for detecting the component of the whim with @xmath14  k. among metal lines ,   are the most sensitive for observations of high ionization gas , due to the high cosmic abundance of oxygen and the large values of oscillator strengths of the @xmath27   and @xmath28   resonant lines . under collisional ionization equilibrium conditions , ionization fraction reaches its peak value of @xmath29 at @xmath30  k @xcite .",

    "detailed ionization modeling with tight constraints on column densities , doppler widths and velocities of , and other metal ions are necessary to understand the ionization mechanism in each absorption system and its physical origin @xcite .    an alternative to using highly ionized metals is to search for absorption from the trace amounts of atomic hydrogen ( ionization fraction , @xmath35 ) present in the warm - hot gas . at @xmath36  k ,",

    "accurate measurements of such broad lines in the quasar spectrum require high @xmath1 , well - determined continua , and a good understanding of the fixed - pattern noise .",
    "broad absorbers ( blas ) in the @xmath19 universe were discovered in the existing archive of @xmath17/stis quasar spectra @xcite .",
    "the most serious systematic uncertainty associated with these bla measurements is whether the observed broad line width of is dominantly thermal . due to the shallow and broad shape of the absorption profile ,",
    "particularly when the column is low , it is often difficult to rule out , from moderate @xmath1 spectra , the possibility of line blending or turbulence contributing to line width .",

    "the g130 m and g160 m cos gratings were chosen to obtain spectra in the far ultraviolet bands .",

    "all exposures were obtained in the time - tagged , photon - counting mode .",
    "the different grating central wavelength configurations resulted in photons of the same wavelength getting recorded at different regions of the detector which subsequently reduced the effect of fixed pattern noise in the final coadded spectrum .",
    "this set up also helped to cover the @xmath54   wavelength gap between segments a and b of the fuv detector for the various central wavelength settings .",
    "the reduction of the raw frames into 1d spectra was carried out using the cos pipeline software calcos ( v2.11 ) with the appropriate calibration reference files .",

    "the reduction of these data sets was carried out using version 2.4 of the @xmath18 calibration pipeline .",

    "once the velocity shifts were applied to each observation , the data in the lif1a and lif2b channels of the detector were combined together to produce the final spectrum .",
    "at a heliocentric velocity of @xmath67  , the @xmath5 absorber is one of the nearest extragalactic absorption systems .",
    "it was discovered by wakker & savage ( 2009 ) in the @xmath18 spectrum of mrk  @xmath68 through the identification of  @xmath69   line .",
    "the detection was claimed as _ uncertain _ since the red member of the doublet is confused with the galactic  @xmath70   line .",

    "the for this absorber was outside the @xmath18 spectral window , and the at this velocity suffers from galactic contamination . nonetheless , @xcite reported the @xmath72 absorption detected at @xmath73   as  @xmath69   after ruling out the possibility of the identified line being interstellar absorption or higher order lyman lines along this sight line .",
    "the detection of in the cos g130 m spectrum at @xmath0 confirms the @xcite identification of this absorption system .",
    "in figures 1a - 1b we show the continuum normalized profiles of and on a velocity scale centered at @xmath5 .",
    "also displayed are regions of the spectrum where absorption from other prominent ionic species are expected .",

    "the contribution to the total column density from such a shallow component is going to be marginal ( @xmath80  m , log  @xmath75 \\lesssim 13.0 $ ] ) when compared with the contributions from the two stronger components at @xmath81   and @xmath82   respectively .",
    "the @xmath83   doppler width for the @xmath78   component suggests that this is a broad absorber ( from here on , we often refer to this component in as the bla ) .",
    "if the line is purely thermally broadened , then @xmath83   line width implies a gas temperature of t = @xmath84  k. the most significant systematic uncertainty that could affect a @xmath85-measurement is blending of closely separated kinematic components .",
    "the residual absorption in the blue wing of the bla suggests some kinematic complexity .",
    "however , the bla and the @xmath82   components of the profile appear highly symmetric suggesting very little influence of this low column density component on the measured @xmath85 values .    we take note of the fact that the profile could be subjected to saturation that is unresolved by cos ( fwhm  @xmath86  ) .",
    "the presence of instrumentally unresolved saturation becomes evident when apparent column density profiles of different electronic transitions from the same energy level in an ion are compared @xcite .",

    "it is evident that the absorption is kinematically well aligned with the bla ( i.e. , the @xmath78   component ) .",
    "the formal velocity difference between the line centers is @xmath99  .",

    "the galaxy has an estimated isophotal major diameter of @xmath131  kpc , and is one of the largest spiral galaxies in the nearby universe @xcite .",
    "although the impact parameter is large , the small velocity separation and the large size of the galaxy makes it possible for the absorber to be in some way related to ngc  @xmath123 s circumgalactic environment .",
    "such an inference is consistent with statistical results from a number of past absorber - galaxy surveys where @xmath132 galaxies were found within @xmath133  kpc of absorbers @xcite and also with results from cosmological simulations of galaxies and absorbers @xcite .",

    "no published spectrum is available for this galaxy . in figure 4b",
    ", we display the orientation of the galaxy with respect to the quasar sight line .",
    "the large impact parameter of the absorber with respect to the galaxy disk results in low surface flux of uv photons from the galaxy incident on the absorber .",
    "thus , we do not expect the galaxy s radiation field to significantly influence the ionization of hydrogen or metals in the absorber @xcite .",
    "ngc 5987 also does not appear in the rosat all - sky survey bright source catalogue @xcite and therefore is unlikely to harbor an active agn that could photoionize the surrounding intergalactic gas .",
    "given the significant excess of galaxies with @xmath140   in the field around mrk  290 , and the pencil beam size region probed by the bla - system ( @xmath67  ) , it will be difficult to conclude whether the absorption is tracing the gaseous halo of one or the other galaxy in the filament , or an intergalactic gas cloud that is part of the large - scale filament .",
    "we return to this discussion in sec 5 .",
    "understanding the ionization , physical conditions and metalicity in the absorber is crucial to discriminate between the different possible explanations for its astrophysical origin .",
    "we explore a range of parameter space in both photoionization and collisional ionization models and assess whether the models are physically realistic .",
    "we focus our modeling on the @xmath81   bla component of the absorption which has detected at the same velocity .",
    "no metals are detected for the other component at @xmath82   and therefore useful constraints on the physical parameters can not be obtained for this component from ionization modeling .",
    "the @xmath7  k temperature implied by the different bla and line widths is much higher than the kinetic temperature expected for a purely photoionized gas .",
    "nonetheless , to elaborate on the difficulties associated with photoionization in explaining the origin of these lines , we investigate some best - fit photoionization models and their predictions .",
    "we use the photoionization code cloudy [ ver.c08.00 , @xcite ] to solve for equilibrium models that reproduce @xmath141 and the limits on all the other ions .",
    "the source of ionization is assumed to be dominated by the extragalactic background radiation at @xmath87 whose shape and intensity is as modeled by @xcite .",
    "the uv background spectrum used has contributions from quasars and from the population of high-@xmath20 young star forming galaxies .",
    "the photoionization models are calculated for different ionization parameters log  @xmath142  ev to the hydrogen density , @xmath143 , metallicity and the observed @xmath144   in the broad component at @xmath145  . the @xmath146   and the limiting column density ratios of @xmath147 , @xmath148 , @xmath149 and @xmath150",
    "serve as additional constraints for the models . in the models , we assume the revised solar elemental abundance ratios of [ c / h]@xmath151 = -3.57  dex , [ o / h]@xmath151 = -3.31  dex , [ n / h]@xmath151 = -4.17  dex and [ si / h]@xmath151 = -4.49  dex given by asplund ( 2009 )    shown in figure 5 are the photoionization model predictions for column densities of the various ionic species , as a function of the ionization parameter .",
    "the observed @xmath147 and @xmath148 limiting ratios restrict the ionization parameter to log  @xmath152 , corresponding to @xmath153   and metallicity to -1.8 dex of solar .",
    "the @xmath144   and the log  @xmath142 dependent ionization fraction of @xmath154 implies an absorbing region with a total baryonic column density of @xmath155  . the very low density and high total hydrogen column density results in a line of sight thickness of @xmath156  mpc for the absorbing structure .",
    "if the absorber is unvirialized , the large path length would result in lines with @xmath157   width due to hubble flow , which is inconsistent with the observed and velocity widths .",
    "if the absorbing structure is well within the virialized halo of ngc  @xmath123 , it would have decoupled from cosmic expansion .",
    "the kinematic properties of the bla would then largely depend only on the internal velocity field along the line of sight and the rotational velocity of the galaxy halo",
    ". it would be remarkable for a megaparsec scale absorbing region to not have any velocity field capable of inducing asymmetry or kinematic complexity in the line profiles .",
    "to the contrary , we find no such evidence in the observed line profiles of the bla and which appear kinematically simple , symmetric and gaussian .",
    "the predictions of the models are further complicated by the fact that the photoionization equilibrium temperature of @xmath158  k is significantly smaller than the @xmath7  k given by the different bla and line widths .",
    "thus photoionization does not appear as a dominant process controlling the ionization state .",
    "we therefore turn to the alternate scenario of collisional ionization .",
    "the temperature suggested by the observed line widths is consistent with collisional ionization conditions .",
    "first we consider the simplest scenario of collisional ionization equilibrium ( cie ) in which at a constant kinetic temperature the fraction of ions remain time - independent . in figure 6 , we compare observations with column density predictions from cie models of @xcite for a metallicity of 1/10 solar .",
    "we find that cie models fail to explain all observed high ion column density limits simultaneously for acceptable temperatures .",
    "the predicted @xmath141 is greater than @xmath159 and @xmath160 for @xmath161  k , which is higher than the temperature given by the line widths of the bla and . between the temperature range of @xmath30",
    "k , where the ionization fraction peaks and @xmath162  k , the fraction declines rapidly by a factor of @xmath163  dex .",
    "thus , at @xmath7  k , 0.1z@xmath151 metallicity and @xmath144  , the cie predicted @xmath141 is a factor of @xmath164  dex smaller than the measured value and the @xmath159 and @xmath160 are significantly overproduced for solar relative elemental abundances .      even when conditions are favorable for collisional processes to dominate the ionization state , a realistic modeling of absorption systems should take into account the effect of uv metagalactic flux from quasars and star forming galaxies on the absorber @xcite .",
    "we therefore compute a series of hybrid models using cloudy , allowing both collisional and photoionization reactions to contribute to ion fractions .",
    "the temperature in cloudy is set to @xmath7  k given by the different bla - line widths .",
    "the model that cloudy would converge on will have the ionization and recombination in equilibrium even though the heating and cooling rates are out of balance , due to the fixed temperature .",
    "in figure 7 we show the column density predictions for these hybrid models at @xmath7  k and different log  @xmath142 .",
    "the density of the absorber in these models is determined by the input number density of hydrogen ionizing photons and the ionization parameter .",
    "the hybrid models that reproduce the measured @xmath141 and the column density ratios of with and require [ z / h ] @xmath165  dex , log  @xmath166 , @xmath167  , @xmath168   and thus absorber path lengths @xmath169  mpc .",
    "the expected line width from hubble broadening for such a large path length is incompatible with the observed and line widths and therefore a cie - photoionization hybrid model can be rejected .",
    "the temperature @xmath170  k implied by the data is in the regime where radiative",
    "cooling is efficient .",

    "the changes perceived for the ion ratios in these hybrid models can be used to estimate how the ion ratios would be affected in a noneq - ci cooling gas scenario when photoionization is included .",

    "the prediction is already consistent with the upper limit given by the data , whereas is overproduced by a small amount ( 0.1  dex higher ) , and underproduced by @xmath188  dex . in the hybrid model shown in the _ left panel _ of figure 9 , we can see that the ionization fraction is enhanced from noneq - ci by @xmath188  dex for log  @xmath189 , whereas the ionization fraction is diminished by @xmath190  dex , making both column density predictions consistent with the measurements . however , the density @xmath191  , and total hydrogen column density of @xmath192   corresponding to this ionization parameter implies a line of sight of @xmath193  mpc through the absorbing region .",

    "the above _ hybrid _ model also has the limitation that it does not take into account the enhanced metal line cooling due to the increase in line emissions from excess produced by photoionization .",
    "a @xmath164  dex increase in the column density could lower the cooling time scales thereby altering the ionization states of and . a more accurate treatment of the _ hybrid _ model",
    "should incorporate photoionization by external radiation into the @xcite ionization calculations and subsequently follow the ion fractions as the gas cools from @xmath171  k. this is a computationally elaborate task and is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "in contemplating the nature of this bla - absorber , we are guided by two key insights , namely ( 1 ) the absorption is produced by gas at @xmath7  k whose ionization is likely governed by both collisional non - equilibrium and photoionization reactions ( 2 ) the absorbing structure is part of a large - scale filament of galaxies with several luminous galaxies within a @xmath13  mpc projected distance . in view of these , a few different scenarios are possible for the origin of the bla - absorption . the information obtained from probing a pencil beam region of the absorber may not be sufficient to discriminate between these different physical scenarios . given the uncertainties encountered in the ionization models , we treat the inferences from the models as secondary to what the data is directly suggesting .",
    "starburst driven outflows with large velocities from galaxies can shock - heat and increase the ionization of the surrounding gas to produce @xcite .",
    "observationally such a physical scenario is supported by the detections of systems with [ o / h ] @xmath213  dex in the galactic halo as well as the extended halos of other galaxies within @xmath133  kpc @xcite",
    ". however , gas associated with chemical feedback from star - formation typically have metallicity higher than the @xmath8  dex given by the noneq - ci and photoionization _ hybrid _ models for the bla - absorber .",
    "a shock - heated origin for was suggested by @xcite . in their sample of absorbers and galaxies , @xmath214% ( 16/37 ) of the absorbers",
    "were associated with pairs of clouds within @xmath215   of each other . both the and the absorptions [ @xmath216  ] were also within @xmath217  kpc of @xmath218 and 100  kpc of 0.1  @xmath218 galaxies .",
    "about half of these in pairs were also found associated with galaxy groups .",

    "several galaxies with impact parameters ranging from 144 kpc to 3.1 mpc were also identified within @xmath223   of the absorber implying that the sight line was intercepting a galaxy group @xcite .",
    "collisional ionization was inferred as the likely mechanism for the ionization in the - bla gas phase in that system @xcite .",
    "the @xmath87 absorber is also associated with a pair of absorbers separated by @xmath224  .",
    "gas clouds moving at those relative velocities , colliding with one another , can shock - heat gas to temperatures of @xmath225  k ( assuming @xmath226 * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , consistent with the temperature for the bla - gas phase .",
    "shocks can therefore be one of the mechanisms for the ionization in the absorber .    in a study of absorbers and galaxies along select quasar fields , chen & mulchaey ( 2009 ) find some absorbing galaxies with disturbed morphologies indicating past events of mergers or interactions .",
    "they argue that such galaxies likely have a higher cross - section for absorption due to tidally stripped gas contributing to the halo gas content .",
    "the bla - absorber is also in a galaxy excess environment ( @xmath22 galaxies within @xmath227  mpc projected distance ) where the probability of galaxy pair interactions is high .",
    "consequently , it is plausible that the absorption is from a shock - heated fragment of gas tidally stripped by ngc  5987 from one of the smaller galaxies in the large - scale filament . the oxygen abundance in the ism of low - mass irregular galaxies is found to be low ( @xmath228 , * ?",

    "the tidally stripped interstellar gas of such a dwarf satellite would be consistent with the low - metallicity for the bla - absorber given by the _ hybrid _ models .",

    "such inflows of matter from whim are expected in the cold gas accretion models of galaxy formation @xcite .",
    "the presence of paired absorbers , and an origin in a galaxy filament , makes the absorber an excellent candidate for shock - heated whim @xcite .",
