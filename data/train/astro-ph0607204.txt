    "constraints on the dependence of @xmath17 and @xmath1 on galaxy properties and redshift hence afford unique insight into the formation and evolution of galaxies in a cosmological context .",
    "for example , evolution of @xmath1 provides constraints on the evolution of star formation efficiency in galaxies .",
    "yet there are surprisingly few direct constraints on @xmath17 or @xmath1 .",
    "since dark matter extends far beyond the visible components of a galaxy , it is in practice difficult to probe the halo mass on large scales ( i.e. , @xmath18 @xmath19 kpc ) due to a lack of luminous tracers .",
    "the halo masses of clusters of galaxies can be estimated by strong and weak gravitational lensing , the tight relationship between the x - ray temperature of the diffuse intracluster medium and the dark matter halo , the sunyaev - zeldovich effect , and by measuring the velocity dispersion of the cluster galaxies themselves , under the assumption that the cluster galaxies are tracing out the dark matter halo potential ( see * ? ? ? * for a recent review ) .    probing the halos of isolated galaxies",
    "is more difficult .",
    "the only methods that are currently capable of directly probing the halo mass of isolated @xmath2 galaxies to large radii are weak lensing @xcite and satellite dynamics @xcite , which utilizes satellite galaxies as test particles that trace out the dark matter halo velocity field out to several hundred kiloparsecs .",
    "one limitation of both techniques is that they must `` stack '' many isolated galaxies in order to build up a robust signal .",
    "both methods have yielded similar results ;",
    "e.g. , each finds a positive correlation between galaxy luminosity and the virial mass of its dark matter halo .",
    "the evolution in the virial mass - to - light ratios of bright isolated galaxies is only poorly constrained .",
    "@xcite measured the weak lensing signal for early - type @xmath2 galaxies from @xmath20 to @xmath21 .",
    "they found little evolution in the halo mass of @xmath22 galaxies , though their formal errors on the halo mass at @xmath23 were @xmath24% .",
    "furthermore , that work assumed that @xmath25 did not evolve with redshift and that halo mass was proportional to the square root of galaxy luminosity .",
    "most recently , utilizing stellar masses and weak lensing data from combo-17 and gems , @xcite find no significant evolution in the virial - to - stellar mass ratios of bright galaxies to @xmath23 ( though constraints are weak ; they find that the ratio decreases by no more than a factor of @xmath26 at @xmath27 ) .",
    "using the first @xmath28% of the recently completed deep2 redshift survey , which has now collected spectra for @xmath29 galaxies at @xmath30 , @xcite used the dynamics of satellite galaxies to measure the halo mass for bright isolated galaxies with satellites ( referred to as `` host '' galaxies ) and compared their derived @xmath31 to measurements from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) at @xmath4 .",
    "however , the small sample size and differences in selection effects between deep2 and sdss meant that all claims in that work had to be highly qualified .",
    "this study presents a much more detailed comparison between host - satellite systems identified in the completed deep2 redshift survey and systems found in a consistent way from the fourth public data release of the sdss .",
    "the increased data sample at @xmath3 , combined with a careful handling of the different selection effects between the two surveys , allows a robust determination of the evolution in the @xmath6-band virial mass - to - light ratio and the virial - to - stellar mass ratio of @xmath2 host galaxies from @xmath32 to @xmath33 .",
    "the classic tully - fisher relation is also capable of constraining the halo mass of isolated disk - dominated galaxies , though the steps required to convert the observed rotation speed into a dark matter halo virial mass is more model dependent than either weak lensing or satellite dynamics .",
    "@xcite . in particular",
    ", this method must extrapolate the rotation curve far beyond the region covered by observations and/or requires knowledge of the relative contribution of baryonic and dark matter to the observed rotation curve as a function of scale ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the use of satellite dynamics for extracting mass estimates of their host galaxies is motivated by a scenario in which a bright galaxy resides at rest at the center of its dark matter halo , has no other bright companions , and is surrounded by faint satellites that are bound to the host halo and orbit within it .",

    "we then search for companions of the isolated galaxies that are within the search cylinder defined by @xmath53 and @xmath57 , and are fainter than the isolated galaxy by at least @xmath52 magnitudes .",

    "we use the search parameters listed in table [ t : params ] ; the same parameters are used to extract systems from both the deep2 and sdss surveys , and our fiducial set of parameters is sample @xmath58 . in appendix [ s : test_mass ] we show that our results are unchanged within @xmath27 when adopting different search parameters",
    ".    however , the recovered satellite velocity dispersion ( see below ) can become sensitive to @xmath53 ( the maximum velocity separation between host and satellite ) when the contribution from the true satellite dispersion is significant even at the edge of the @xmath60 distribution ( the window defined by @xmath61 ) .",
    "this problem is alleviated simply by increasing the @xmath53 parameter for brighter host galaxies ( which have larger satellite dispersions ) .",
    "indeed , tests with simulations have shown that scaling the @xmath53 parameter with host galaxy luminosity more robustly recovers the true satellite dispersion at large host luminosities @xcite .",
    "hence for the highest host galaxy luminosity and stellar mass bins at @xmath4 and @xmath3 , we increase @xmath53 by increments of @xmath62 km s@xmath40 until the measured dispersion has converged ( the satellite dispersion for fainter samples had already converged using sample @xmath58 parameters ) .",
    "convergence is achieved when using @xmath63 km s@xmath40 for all of these bins except for the highest stellar mass bin at @xmath4 ; there the dispersion converges at @xmath64 km s@xmath40 . has been increased to @xmath65 km s@xmath40 since it is conceptually awkward for @xmath53 to be larger than @xmath50 . ]",
    "this section describes in detail how to estimate the dark matter halo mass of host galaxies .",
    "this procedure can be conceptually separated into three steps : identifying host - satellite systems in a galaxy catalog ; reconstructing the line - of - sight velocity dispersion profile of their satellites ; and converting the dispersion profile into a mass . once",
    "host - satellite systems are found , the velocity dispersion profile of the host galaxy dark matter halo can be estimated from the distribution of velocity differences between host and satellite galaxies , @xmath66 , in bins of projected distance from the host galaxy , @xmath67 .    in an ideal world there would exist hundreds of sufficiently luminous satellite galaxies per host galaxy , and the task of measuring a velocity dispersion profile would be comparatively straightforward .",
    "unfortunately , in practice there are on average only @xmath68 satellites per host galaxy , due to the magnitude limit of the redshift surveys used here ( most isolated galaxies possess _ no _ identifiable satellites ) . in order to build up a dispersion profile",
    "we must combine satellites from many host galaxies and construct an average profile around an average host ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "assuming that host galaxy properties such as luminosity are tightly correlated with their dark matter halo mass , then by stacking host galaxies in bins of luminosity we can recover the average underlying halo mass @xcite .",
    "weak lensing studies rely on the same stacking procedure , since the lensing signal from individual isolated galaxies is very weak ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "naively , one might expect the velocity distribution of satellites , @xmath69 , to be approximately gaussian with @xmath70 given by the velocity dispersion of satellite galaxies associated with the host galaxy @xcite .",
    "in fact , there is a significant contribution to the @xmath60 distribution from so - called `` interloper '' galaxies .",
    "interlopers are galaxies that are classified as satellites in projection but are in fact not true satellites , i.e. , they are not physically associated with the host galaxy .",
    "previous authors ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have modeled the effect of interlopers as a constant contribution to @xmath69 at all velocities .",
    "tests with simulations have confirmed that modeling interlopers in this way results in a robust recovery of the underlying mass distribution ( see appendix [ s : appraisal ] ) .",
    "however , @xcite and @xcite found that in mock galaxy catalogs interlopers do not have a constant @xmath60 distribution but rather have a velocity structure somewhat similar to true satellites ( though in the mock catalogs the width of the interloper distribution does not appear to scale with host galaxy luminosity ) . despite this ( or perhaps _ because _ of this ) , these authors found that modeling the interloper distribution as a constant component to the @xmath60 distribution does yield an accurate recovery of the velocity dispersion profile as well as the underlying halo mass , in agreement with previous work .",
    "hence @xmath69 is modeled as a gaussian distribution plus a constant component : @xmath71 subject to the following normalization condition : @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the fraction of interlopers within @xmath74 and @xmath75 is the line  of  sight satellite dispersion .",
    "we use a maximum  likelihood method to fit this gaussian  plus  constant function to the observed distribution of @xmath60 for pairs in some bin of projected separation @xmath67 . we maximize the likelihood function : @xmath76 =     \\sum_i \\lambda_i\\ , \\mathrm{ln}\\big[f(dv_i ; \\ , \\eta , \\sigma_{\\rm{los}})\\big]\\ ] ] over a dense grid in @xmath75 and @xmath73 , where @xmath77 is the @xmath60 value for the @xmath78th satellite  host galaxy pair , which is given weight @xmath79 ( see below ) .",
    "since we only use @xmath77 values for pairs in some bin of projected separation , the parameters @xmath73 and @xmath75 are implicit functions of @xmath67 .    in the following analysis satellite @xmath78 is assigned a weight @xmath79 according to the inverse number of satellites associated with the host of satellite @xmath78 .",
    "this weighting scheme ensures that host galaxies that have a large number of satellites ( and are hence likely to be more massive than the average host ) do not dominate the likelihood .",
    "van den bosch et al .",
    "( 2004 ) compared weighting by host galaxies ( the scheme employed here ) to weighting by satellite galaxies ( which would be equivalent to setting @xmath80 for all satellites ) in simulations and found that the recovered velocity dispersion differs between these two schemes as a function of host luminosity .",
    "weighting by host galaxy more fairly represents the average mass of host galaxies within a given luminosity or stellar mass bin .",
    "the resulting fit yields not only a measurement of the velocity dispersion but also an estimate of the interloper fraction .",
    "marginalizing the likelihood over @xmath73 provides an estimate of the @xmath27 errors on the velocity dispersion .",
    "redshift uncertainties are accounted for by subtracting in quadrature the rms redshift error , @xmath81 , from the measured velocity dispersion , @xmath75 : @xmath82 the redshift uncertainty enters twice because we are subtracting two velocities , the host from the satellite .",
    "the resulting velocity dispersion , @xmath83 , is then our best estimate of the true dispersion . for the range of velocity dispersions probed here , folding redshift errors from the deep2 and sdss surveys ( @xmath84 km s@xmath40 ) into our measured dispersion changes results by only a few percent . in the following sections we simplify our notation to @xmath85 for brevity .    with an estimate of the velocity dispersion of the host galaxy dark matter halo we can , with additional assumptions ,",
    "extract the virial mass of the halo .",
    "we follow the procedure of @xcite and @xcite in converting velocity dispersions to virial masses .    the density profile of a dark matter halo is parameterized using the nfw @xcite model : @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the present critical density , @xmath88 , and @xmath89 where @xmath45 is defined as the radius where the mean interior density is @xmath44 times the critical density .",
    "the concentration , @xmath90 , is inversely related to the mass of a dark matter halo , and , at fixed mass , scales with redshift as @xmath91 @xcite ; concentrations for dark matter halos hosting galaxies or clusters range from @xmath92 . in our analysis",
    "we fix @xmath93 , which is consistent with the concentration of a @xmath94 @xmath95 halo at @xmath96 , and scale @xmath90 by @xmath91 for higher redshift samples .",
    "however , as demonstrated below , the density profile depends only weakly on concentration over the scales probed ( @xmath97 @xmath19 kpc ) , and hence the assumed concentration has little effect on the resulting mass estimates ( cf .",
    "appendix [ s : test_mass ] ) .",
    "throughout we assume that the satellite galaxies follow the radial profile of the dark matter .",
    "the effect of a spatial bias between satellites and dark matter on the recovered mass have been show by @xcite to be at the few percent level ( see also appendix [ s : appraisal ] ) .",
    "we then determine the radial velocity dispersion profile by integrating the jeans equation , which relates the density profile and gravitational potential to the radial velocity dispersion , using equation [ eqn : nfw ] to specify the potential .",
    "finally , we integrate along the line - of - sight . both integrations require knowledge of the velocity anisotropy , @xmath98 , of the satellite population .",
    "fortunately the line - of - sight velocity dispersion profile depends only weakly on @xmath99 @xcite . in appendix",
    "[ s : test_mass ] we explore both an isotropic distribution ( @xmath100 ) and an anisotropy parameterization suggested by @xcite , and confirm that the derived mass is robust to assumptions about @xmath99 .",
    "below we set @xmath100 .    given these assumptions , there remains only one free parameter , the normalization of the dispersion profile , which is related to the mass within @xmath45 , denoted @xmath46 , of the dark matter halo .",
    "the normalization is obtained via @xmath101 minimization using the measured @xmath102 points .",
    "the majority of the analysis below uses only one velocity dispersion measurement to derive a virial mass . in appendix",
    "[ s : test_mass ] we demonstrate that estimating virial masses with only one dispersion measurement does not bias the recovered mass .",
    "including more velocity dispersion measurements in finer projected separation bins simply has the effect of decreasing the error on the recovered mass ( if there are sufficient numbers of satellites to increase the number of radial bins , which is not the case in deep2 ) .",

    "[ f : host_colors ]      every galaxy survey is unique ; unfortunately , that makes comparison between surveys difficult . in our case , there are two separate effects that must be taken into account in order to compare the deep2 and sdss galaxy surveys fairly .",
    "the first issue is the differing sampling rates ; this is trivial to resolve , however .",
    "as mentioned in previous sections , the completeness of the deep2 and sdss surveys are @xmath148% and @xmath118% , respectively .",
    "this difference , if not accounted for , would result in a much larger fraction of falsely isolated host galaxies in the deep2 sample ( i.e. , galaxies that appear isolated in the spectroscopic catalog but are not truly isolated ) and could bias the resulting satellite velocity dispersion profile with respect to the sdss sample .    in order to mitigate this difference",
    "we randomly dilute the sdss redshift catalog to the same completeness as deep2 ( that is , @xmath149% of sdss galaxies are randomly removed from the catalog ) .",
    "extensive tests with mock catalogs have confirmed that for the deep2 survey the incompleteness is very close to uniform as a function of @xmath150-dimensional galaxy over - density @xcite , hence this simple random dilution is sufficient for our purposes . as shown in appendix [",
    "s : contam ] , this dilution results in a @xmath134% _ increase _ in the estimated virial masses of host galaxies compared to the complete ( undiluted ) sdss .",
    "this should be kept in mind when considering the results in @xmath36[s : results ] .    the second effect primarily impacts the satellite population .",
    "while both surveys select targets that are brighter than an _ apparent _ @xmath151-band magnitude limit , in the deep2 survey this selection corresponds to an approximately _ restframe _ @xmath6-band selection at @xmath152 and approximately _ restframe _ @xmath153-band at @xmath3 , while in the sdss this selection corresponds closely to restframe @xmath151-band .",

    ", the apparent deep2 @xmath151-band magnitude limit can be modeled by a broken line in the color - magnitude diagram ( cf .",
    "figure [ f : cmr ] here and figure 4 in @xcite ; see also @xcite for a more detailed discussion of this effect ) .",
    "in particular , the broken line in figure [ f : cmr ] can be used to define a volume limited sample at @xmath155 that uniformly samples color - magnitude space ; when selecting such samples we use only deep2 galaxies with @xmath155 and include only galaxies that are brighter than this line in color - magnitude space . note that the broken line is a function of redshift .",
    "moreover , the dearth of faint red galaxies in the bottom panel is attributable to this @xmath151-band selection effect . for the sample at @xmath4 the broken line",
    "is shifted according to the observed evolution in the @xmath6-band luminosity function , @xmath156 , which is approximately independent of color @xcite .",
    "thus , selecting galaxies brighter than this broken line ensures that sdss and deep2 are similarly complete _ relative to @xmath157 _ as a function of both luminosity and color at all redshifts @xmath155 .    for host galaxies",
    "this selection effect is not particularly important because host galaxies are all rather luminous ( by definition , since these galaxies must be bright enough to have satellite galaxies that are at least @xmath52 magnitudes fainter ) . for such bright galaxies both very red and very blue host galaxies",
    "are included in both surveys over the full redshift ranges we consider .",
    "this is apparent in figure [ f : cmr ] , where nearly all of the blue / black points in both panels ( representing host galaxies ) are to the left of the broken dashed line .",
    "unfortunately , accounting for the apparent @xmath151-band selection effect drastically reduces the number of available satellite galaxies , as can been seen in figure [ f : cmr ] , where most of the green / grey points ( representing satellite galaxies ) are to the right of the broken dashed line . in order to increase our statistics , when measuring velocity dispersions in @xmath36[s : results ]",
    "we do not account for this selection effect in the manner mentioned above .",
    "assuming that the measured velocity dispersion does not depend on _ satellite _ properties , then the velocity dispersion should be insensitive to this selection effect , since including this effect will only decrease the total number of host galaxies but will not preferentially select one type of host galaxy ( e.g. , bright or red ) over another @xcite , though the signal is not large for the types of systems explored here .",

    "it is evident that host galaxies have a distribution in @xmath15 colors comparable to all galaxies at the same luminosity at both @xmath3 and @xmath4 , and that host galaxies at @xmath4 are redder than host galaxies at @xmath3 only insofar as the overall galaxy population is redder at @xmath4 compared to @xmath3 .",
    "one can also clearly see the growth in the abundance of red galaxies between @xmath3 and @xmath4 , as noticed in previous studies @xcite .",
    "the samples used in figure [ f : host_colors ] have the @xmath151-band cut taken into account . however , the full samples ( neglecting the @xmath151-band cut ) display nearly identical host @xmath15 color distributions when compared to the @xmath151-band cut samples .",
    "this indicates that the full samples , which are used in @xmath36[s : results ] , do not contain any _ artificial _ changes in the @xmath15 color distribution of galaxies with time .",
    "generating a fair comparison sample is a requisite for interpreting the distribution of colors of host galaxies .",
    "since host galaxies are in general much brighter than an average galaxy ( i.e. , a galaxy drawn at random from the full survey ) , without a fair comparison sample we would have falsely concluded that host galaxies are redder than the average galaxy .",
    "these selection effects are exacerbated in the deep2 sample , where the red galaxy population is a strong function of redshift due both to the apparent @xmath151-band limit of the survey and to evolution in red number density , but are effectively mitigated with a proper comparison sample .",

    "we conclude from these distributions that the average host galaxy at @xmath3 has fainter satellites than an average host galaxy at @xmath4 .",

    "the average @xmath160 for each sample reflects this difference as well , though less strikingly : at @xmath3 @xmath161 while at @xmath4 @xmath162 .",
    "note that since these distributions of @xmath158 are normalized to the total number of satellites at each redshift , these results are insensitive to the presence of interlopers unless interlopers have a @xmath160 distribution that varies with redshift .",
    "although such a scenario seems particularly nefarious , it can not explicitly be ruled out .",
    "in addition we have investigated the sensitivity of these results to our assumed evolution in the luminosity function . throughout",
    "we have assumed that the characteristic scale of the luminosity function evolves as @xmath163 independent of color @xcite .",
    "the evolution in the luminosity function is important here because it determines how the dashed line in figure [ f : cmr ] evolves with redshift , which in turn defines the samples used in this section .",
    "if the amount of evolution in @xmath157 is varied by @xmath164 ( which is the @xmath27 uncertainty in the evolution of @xmath157 as reported by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the qualitative result of figure [ f : dm ] , namely that deep2 satellites are on average fainter with respect to their host luminosities than sdss satellites , remains unchanged .",
    "however , the case of maximal evolution , where @xmath157 evolves by @xmath165 magnitudes per unit redshift , results in a significantly less striking difference at large @xmath160 , for the obvious reason that this maximal evolution in @xmath157 allows many more faint satellite galaxies to be included in the sample at @xmath4 ( in essence , the dashed line in the top panel of figure [ f : cmr ] moves to the right ) .",
    "thus , if the difference in satellite properties seen in figure [ f : dm ] is not real , then evolution in @xmath157 is even stronger than found by @xcite .",
    "moreover , dynamical friction acting on the @xmath3 host - satellite population would tend to produce a trend _ opposite _ to what is observed here .",
    "because dynamical friction is most efficient when it acts between objects of comparable mass , it will cause the brightest satellites to sink toward the host preferentially , resulting in comparably _ more _ fainter satellites at @xmath4 than at @xmath3 , contrary to our observations .    in figure",
    "[ f : nsat ] we plot the fraction of host galaxies with at least @xmath166 satellites , @xmath167 , as a function of @xmath166 , both at @xmath3 ( dashed line ) and @xmath4 ( solid line ) .",
    "errors reflect poisson uncertainties .",
    "it is evident that , when comparing volume limited samples at @xmath3 and @xmath4 which are similarly complete in color - magnitude space , host galaxies at high redshift are associated with more satellites than host galaxies at low redshift ( although the difference is weak , see below ) .",
    "this is illustrated alternatively by considering the average number of satellites per host galaxy : @xmath168 at @xmath3 and @xmath169 at @xmath4 .    in this case interlopers",
    "have a more direct impact . in @xmath36[s : results ] we show that the interloper fraction decreases from @xmath170% at @xmath3 to @xmath171% at @xmath4 ( so that within @xmath27 the interloper fraction is constant with redshift ) . therefore , the changes in the average number of satellites per galaxy could be due to changes in interloper contamination with @xmath108 at @xmath172 .",
    "uncertainties in the evolution of @xmath157 from @xmath3 to @xmath4 also strongly impact the results shown in figure [ f : nsat ] because a larger / smaller evolution in @xmath154 than what is assumed here will result in more / less faint galaxies in the @xmath4 `` @xmath151-band cut '' sample , which will in turn result in more / less satellites at @xmath4 compared to @xmath3 . in short , these results are unfortunately too sensitive to various assumptions and uncertainties to provide robust conclusions regarding the differential evolution in satellite numbers between @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",

    "these efficiency factors are bracketed by values of @xmath384 derived from the global baryonic mass function @xcite and various weak - lensing studies , which find @xmath385 @xcite .",

    "one should keep in mind that there are numerous details which make a one - to - one comparison between the stellar mass tfr and our results complicated .",
    "for example , the relation between internal galaxy kinematics ( e.g. the maximum circular velocity of the disk ) and dark matter halo kinematics is non - trivial , and likely changes with time .",

    "the quenching of star formation within these dark matter halos provides a natural , qualitative , explanation for the observed growth in @xmath1 with time .",
    "the quenching of star formation in these massive systems implies that their star formation efficiency decreases with time since new gas that comes into these halos is prevented from condensing to form new stars .",
    "the observed increase in @xmath1 between @xmath3 and @xmath4 for these systems corresponds to a decrease in efficiency from @xmath387% to @xmath150% between these epochs .",

    "in particular , host galaxies are required to not have any comparably bright companions within a search cylinder .",

    "however , these selection effects may also account for part of the observed increase in @xmath1 between @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "due to the continual merging of galaxies within halos over time , galaxies can enter the host galaxy sample between @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "in particular , objects within groups and clusters of galaxies at @xmath3 , which are in halos that are more massive than the average host galaxy dark matter halo , may not be classified as host galaxies due to their bright companions , but can _ turn into _ what we would call host galaxies at late times . as groups and clusters at @xmath3 evolve , dynamical friction will cause some fraction of bright companion galaxies to merge with the central galaxy .",
    "those systems in which only one luminous galaxy remains within a massive dark matter halo will be similar to so - called `` fossil groups '' ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the increase of fossil groups between @xmath3 and @xmath4 is a possible explanation for the increase in @xmath1 for high - stellar - mass host galaxies .",
    "this mechanism will likely not affect the evolution of @xmath1 at smaller host stellar masses because the merging of @xmath2 galaxies in massive halos will generate massive red galaxies @xcite , not lower - mass , blue galaxies .",
    "the stellar mass and redshift dependence of the virial - to - stellar mass ratio of host galaxies is reproduced qualitatively in the millennium run semi - analytic model @xcite .",
    "in particular , this model manages to capture the stellar mass dependence of @xmath1 at @xmath3 quite well . at @xmath4 this model reproduces the observed _ shape _ of the @xmath326 relation , though with a lower normalization .",
    "the millennium run , and models like it , are particularly useful for interpreting these results because these semi - analytic models track the _ evolutionary history _ of mock galaxies . hence , for example , we are capable of directly confronting the explanations presented above with a self - consistent model",
    ". we can ask where host galaxies at @xmath3 end up at @xmath4 and , conversely , where @xmath4 host galaxies were at @xmath3 .",
    "such a comparison will be the focus of future work .",
    "evolution in the relation between host galaxy virial mass and @xmath6-band absolute magnitude is more difficult to interpret because @xmath154 can both increase , due to recent episodes of star - formation and mergers , and decrease , due to fading in the stellar population .",
    "although it was demonstrated earlier that our results as a function of @xmath154 are consistent with the average host galaxy @xmath154 fading by one magnitude from @xmath3 and @xmath4 while its dark matter halo does not evolve , our results as a function of stellar mass cast this simple interpretation into doubt . in particular , evolution in the @xmath1 relation strongly suggests that the average halo mass of host galaxies is increasing from @xmath3 to @xmath4 , since the stellar mass of host galaxies is most likely increasing with time ( and , moreover , all currently favored cosmological models indicate that halos grow in mass with time ) .",
    "if halo mass increases significantly , host galaxies at @xmath3 must fade by less than one magnitude ( i.e. fading by less than @xmath25 between these epochs ) in order to reach the @xmath4 @xmath0 relation ( cf .",

    "we summarize our main results and conclusions :    * the @xmath15 color distribution of satellite host galaxies is indistinguishable from the colors of all galaxies ( of similar luminosities ) , at both @xmath3 and @xmath4",

    "this contamination fraction depends mildly on host luminosity , with sub - samples of brighter hosts having a lower contamination fraction than sub - samples of fainter hosts .",
    "this trend reflects the fact that brighter galaxies tend to be found in denser environments , so they are more likely to still have bright companions after dilution .",

    "we have selected one sample at @xmath4 and one at @xmath3 to illustrate our results ( see table [ t : tt ] ) , and the @xmath4 sample has been diluted to match the completeness of the sample at @xmath3 , as mentioned previously .",
    "our fiducial set of assumptions and parameters are an isotropic velocity distribution ( @xmath100 ) , an nfw concentration of @xmath93 , a bin in projected separation between satellite and host of @xmath258 $ ] @xmath19 kpc , and search criteria @xmath58 .",
    "we begin by testing assumptions that affect the measurement of velocity dispersions ( and through this , the derived masses ) . in table",
    "[ t : tt ] we show the change in the derived virial mass when we use different search criteria and different radial bins .",
    "the primary effect of changing search criteria is that the number of satellites changes , which in turn alters the errors on the recovered velocity dispersion and virial mass .",
    "for example , using search criteria @xmath6 or @xmath59 at @xmath3 results in only @xmath408 and @xmath409 satellites within @xmath258 $ ] @xmath19 kpc , respectively , for the luminosity bins we consider in table [ t : tt ] ; hence the velocity dispersions and masses estimated for these samples are rather unstable . as can be gleaned from the table ,",
    "changing the search criteria or varying the radial binning results in changes in the recovered masses within @xmath27 of our fiducial estimates .",
    "note also that using search criteria @xmath6 at @xmath3 and @xmath59 at @xmath4 amounts to using consistent isolation criteria in _ comoving _ coordinates ( because in this case the projected separation scales as @xmath91 ) , and hence we conclude that using such coordinates , as opposed to physical coordinates , results in no significant change in our results .",
    "we now test the impact on @xmath70 of using relatively bright satellites , i.e satellites that are only one magnitude fainter than their host galaxy .",
    "one might expect more massive ( brighter ) satellites to be out of virial equilibrium with the host galaxy since dynamical friction acts more efficiently on these satellites compared to less massive satellites . using the complete sdss sample",

    "we now test assumptions that only affect the conversion between velocity dispersion and mass . in table",
    "[ t : tt ] we show the effects of varying the concentration , @xmath90 , or velocity anisotropy , @xmath99 , on the recovered virial mass .",
    "we use concentrations of 5 , 10 , and 15 , which span the range of typical concentrations for @xmath418 @xmath10 dark matter halos for @xmath419 .",
    "we test two forms of the velocity anisotropy , the isotropic case ( @xmath100 ) , and a form suggested by @xcite that is a good fit to a compilation of anisotropies derived from clusters within @xmath338-body simulations : @xmath420 where @xmath421 .",
    "this functional form has not been tested in galaxy - sized halos , though see the discussion in appendix [ s : appraisal ] .    at first glance",
    "it seems somewhat remarkable that the derived virial mass is almost independent of the concentration and velocity anisotropy parameters over the range tested .",
    "as it turns out , the line - of - sight velocity dispersion profile in the regime @xmath422 @xmath19 kpc , which encompasses most of the satellites we use , is almost completely insensitive to concentration and anisotropy , while on both smaller and larger scales their effects are quite noticeable .",
    "we are , by necessity if not luck , probing a `` sweet spot '' in the velocity dispersion profile .",
    "in addition , we have tested the sensitivity of the derived virial mass to the number of radial bins used to measure velocity dispersions .",
    "we can only perform this test for the sdss sample due to the limited size of the deep2 sample .",
    "we have measured the velocity dispersion in three bins of projected separation , @xmath423 , [ 100 - 200],$ ] and @xmath424 $ ] @xmath19 kpc , for the sdss sample used in table [ t : tt ] .",
    "we find a best fit virial mass of @xmath425 @xmath10 , which is within @xmath27 of the values quoted in table [ t : tt ] using only one radial bin .",
    "furthermore , rebinning the _ undiluted _ sdss sample results in a mass of @xmath426 @xmath10 .",
    "while we see a decline in the velocity dispersion profile for the undiluted sample in agreement with @xcite , we see no decline for the diluted sample .",
    "this is likely due to the fact that the @xmath427% of host galaxies in the diluted sample that are not truly isolated introduce noise into the dispersion measurement on large scales .",
    "finally , we turn to our assumption of an nfw @xcite characterization of the density profile .",
    "recently , @xcite have detected a decline in the satellite velocity dispersion profile with increasing distance from the host galaxy at @xmath4 .",
    "this decline distinctly favors an nfw density profile over an isothermal distribution .",
    "however , we can not distinguish between these and other density distributions at @xmath3 because there are an insufficient number of satellites , making it difficult to bin more finely in radius and probe the velocity dispersion _",
    "profile_.    we are motivated to choose the same parameterization of the density profile at @xmath3 and @xmath4 because it seems unphysical for the density profile to drastically change , e.g. from isothermal to nfw , over this interval .",
    "furthermore , an nfw - like density profile ( notwithstanding minor deviations ) appears to be a generic feature of hierarchical clustering , and is not sensitive to initial conditions or cosmological parameters ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "note that our conclusions regarding the dependence of the satellite velocity dispersion on host luminosity and redshift are completely independent of density profile considerations .",
    "we identify three main assumptions inherent in using satellite galaxies to probe the virial dark matter mass of their hosts : 1 ) there is little scatter between host galaxy luminosity and dark matter halo virial mass , 2 ) satellites are fair tracers of the underlying dark matter velocity field , and 3 ) the velocity difference distribution of satellites and interlopers can be modeled as a gaussian and a constant , respectively .",
    "these assumptions are well motivated both observationally and theoretically",
    ".    the first assumption ( low scatter between mass and luminosity ) must hold for our stacking procedure to work ; it is motivated by the tully - fisher relation for disk - dominated galaxies and the faber - jackson relation for bulge - dominated galaxies .",
    "these relations have only a modest amount of scatter ; typically @xmath428 magnitudes at fixed velocity .",
    "the scatter is even smaller when these relations are quoted as a function of stellar mass or total baryonic mass @xcite .",
    "these tight correlations , with the assumption that the velocity measured probes the underlying halo mass , suggest that the scatter between halo mass and galaxy luminosity is not large , and hence that our stacking procedure is valid .",
    "in addition , models with a tight relation between galaxy luminosity and halo mass successfully reproduce a wide variety of observations ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .    under the assumption that satellite galaxies can be identified with subhalos in dissipationless @xmath338-body simulations ,",
    "these simulations support our second assumption , that satellites are fair tracers of the underlying mass distribution .",
    "a number of studies have looked for a `` velocity bias '' between dark matter and subhalos .",
    "recent work has suggested that such a bias , defined as the ratio between the velocity dispersion of subhalos and dark matter , is about @xmath191% when averaged over entire clusters @xcite . in fact , when @xcite identify subhalos in a simulated cluster in such a way that their spatial distribution matches observed galaxies , they find no velocity bias . although no study has systematically investigated the velocity bias in galaxy - size halos , @xcite showed that subhalos identified in a simulated galaxy - sized halo accurately reflect the underlying mass distribution . admittedly , the velocity bias of the most massive subhalos , which should correspond to the satellites studied here ( since we use relatively bright satellites , which are likely associated with the most massive subhalos ) , has not been adequately investigated .",
    "nevertheless , we conclude that satellite galaxies , should be fair tracers of the underlying dark matter halo mass to @xmath429% or better .",
    "the second and third assumptions have been tested in conjunction by a number of authors .",
    "@xcite identified satellite galaxies with subhalos in dissipationless @xmath338-body simulations , and artificially added in interloper galaxies uniformly in phase space .",
    "they found that for an isolated milky - way sized dark matter halo , the gaussian plus constant parameterization accurately recovers the velocity dispersion profile of subhalos , which in turn accurately reflects the underlying dark matter halo mass .",
    "@xcite also tested these assumptions using cosmological mock galaxy catalogs at @xmath4 , and found that the simple gaussian plus constant parameterization accurately recovers the velocity dispersion of host galaxies as a function of galaxy luminosity .",
    "these authors additionally investigated the impact of orbital anisotropy and a spatial ( anti- ) bias of the satellite galaxies , and found the resulting effects on the recovered dispersion to be minimal .",
    "specifically , when using satellites within one - third of the virial radius from the host galaxy , they found that if @xmath99 changes from @xmath430 to @xmath346 then the velocity dispersion changes by @xmath431% .",
    "these assumptions have also been tested at @xmath3 by @xcite who used cosmological simulations into which mock galaxies were inserted using a halo model approach ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for details concerning these mock catalogs ) .",
    "these authors found that the velocity dispersion profile of mock galaxies accurately reflects the underlying halo mass , and that interlopers can be effectively modeled as a constant component to the velocity difference distribution .",
    "consistency between weak - lensing and satellite measurements of @xmath17 in past studies gives further confirmation that satellites are fair tracers of the underlying dark matter velocity field ( unless both satellite dynamics and weak lensing measurements are biased in a similar way ) .",
    "@xcite compared the dependence of the mass - to - light ratio on luminosity derived from both satellite dynamics and weak lensing measurements , and found agreement within @xmath27 .",
    "furthermore , both weak lensing studies @xcite and satellite dynamics @xcite have found that the derived virial mass scales with host luminosity as @xmath432 with @xmath433 .",
    "the range in @xmath434 can be at least partially explained by the different regimes ( isolated galaxies vs. groups and clusters ) and photometric bands probed ."
