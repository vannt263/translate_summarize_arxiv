    "the last few years have seen numerous experiments examining the magnetic properties of the doped copper - oxide compounds in some detail .",
    "however , our theoretical understanding has not kept in step , partly due to the numerous competing effects and ensuing complexity of these materials : at low temperatures the effects of disorder are paramount , and at larger doping there is the onset of superconductivity .    on the theoretical side , a popular model for investigating the interplay of doping and antiferromagnetic spin correlations",
    "has been the @xmath2-@xmath3 model .",
    "numerical and high temperature series studies of this model have been especially valuable as a testing ground for various theoretical ideas . in an important advance ,",
    "shraiman and siggia  @xcite ( ss ) proposed a phenomenological description of the long - wavelength interplay between spin and charge transport in this model .",
    "there are numerous theoretical reasons for believing that their long - wavelength model is a correct description of the @xmath2-@xmath3 model at low temperatures .",
    "it is expected that the ss model is quite robust , especially at low doping concentrations , and will describe a whole class of doped antiferromagnets , not just the @xmath2-@xmath3 model . however , at sufficiently large doping , an approach based upon long - wavelength distortions of the background antiferromagnetic order must eventually become invalid ; the mechanism of this break - down of the ss model is not understood and remains an important open problem .",
    "this paper shall examine the ss model in a new approach which is designed to explicate the nature of the quantum - disordered phases _ i.e. _ the phases with no long - range magnetic order .",
    "these phases appear at a reasonably small doping concentration , where it is expected , though not certain , that the mapping between the ss and @xmath2-@xmath3 models is still valid .",
    "we will also discuss the relationship of our results to other theoretical work and some experiments in section  [ conc ] .",
    "we begin by writing down a simplified version of the action @xmath4 of the shraiman - siggia model : @xmath5,\\ ] ] with @xmath6 the matsubara time , @xmath7 the spatial co - ordinates , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 the absolute temperature , the first part , @xmath10 describes fluctuations of the antiferromagnetic order parameter @xmath11 . here",
    "@xmath11 is a 3-component vector and is taken to have unit length @xmath12 we then have @xmath13 with @xmath14 the bare spin stiffness and @xmath15 the bare spin - wave velocity .",
    "the momentum of the @xmath11 field is restricted to be smaller than an ultraviolet cutoff @xmath16 , which is also the scale at which the coupling constant are defined .",
    "the action of the fermionic dopant holes is given by @xmath17 .",
    "the holes are describes by fermionic spinor fields @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the spin index , and @xmath20 is ` valley ' index .",
    "the valleys are regions in the brillouin zone around the minima of the fermion dispersion spectrum . for the square - lattice @xmath2-@xmath3 model",
    "there is a great deal of evidence that there are two vallleys centered at the points @xmath21 in the reduced brillouin zone  @xcite .",
    "we will rotate our co - ordinate system from the conventional one , so that our @xmath22-axis is at an angle of @xmath23 degrees to the axes of the square lattice , and the principal axes of the valleys are along the new @xmath22 and @xmath24 axes ; the index @xmath20 will therefore take the values @xmath25 .",
    "further , we will measure momenta from the center of the valleys . with these conventions ,",
    "the fermionic action @xmath17 is @xmath26 where @xmath27 , @xmath28 are the light and heavy masses of the hole .",
    "it is important to realize that there is no simple relationship between the bare fermionic field @xmath29 of the @xmath2-@xmath3 model ( @xmath30 is the site index ) and the continuum fields @xmath31 of the hydrodynamic ss model . crudely speaking",
    ", one may consider this field transmutation as a form of spin - charge separation in which the spin-1/2 , charge @xmath32 @xmath29 fermionic field has separated into the spin-1 , charge 0 , bosonic @xmath11 quanta and the spin-1/2 , charge @xmath32 , @xmath18 fermions .",
    "finally , we will consider only the leading term in the coupling , @xmath33 between the holes and the @xmath11 field , which is responsible for inducing local incommensurate spin correlations .",
    "it is expected that the remaining terms in the ss model are innocuous and do not change the results of this paper qualitatively .",
    "we have @xmath34 where @xmath35 are three pauli matrices , and @xmath36 is a coupling constant .",
    "a crucial feature of the ss model is that there is no three - body coupling like @xmath37 between the fermions and @xmath11 quanta  @xcite : such a term is forbidden by a sublattice interchange symmetry of the ss model  @xcite under which @xmath11 change sign while the @xmath18 remain invariant .",
    "other models of nearly antiferromagnetic fermi liquids  @xcite posses such a term and as a result , have quantum disordered phases with rather different properties .",
    "we wish to clarify a crucial point about our particular form of @xmath4 at the outset .",
    "ss have shown that there is a mapping , in principle exact , to an alternative form of @xmath4 in which the degrees of freedom are a spin-1/2 , charge 0 , complex scalar @xmath38 with @xmath39 and _ spinless _ , charge @xmath32 fermions @xmath40 where @xmath41 is a sublattice index .",
    "the @xmath42 fields are related to the @xmath43 fields by @xmath44 note that there is a @xmath45 gauge transformation on the @xmath43 fields which leaves the @xmath42 fields invariant : @xmath46 where @xmath47 has an arbitrary dependence on spacetime",
    ". the action in terms of the @xmath43 will therefore also have to be invariant under the gauge transformation ; there is no such restriction on the action in the @xmath42 variables .",
    "this latter absence of gauge restrictions , and associated long - range gauge forces will be quite useful to us in our analysis .",
    "ss go on to state that equivalent results are obtained in computations using either choice of fields . in principle , this statement is correct . in practice , however , one is usually restricted in the analysis to perturbation theory , in which the quantum numbers of the low - lying excitations are essentially identical to those of the degrees of freedom in the action .",
    "equivalent results in both theories have been obtained in the vicinity of magnetically ordered states , where one is performing a small fluctuation , spin - wave analysis . on the other hand ,",
    "the choice of fields is expected to have dramatic consequences in a quantum - disordered state .",
    "al . _ and others  @xcite made a choice of fields equivalent to the @xmath48 formulation of the ss model .",
    "thus , not surprisingly , their schwinger - boson mean - field theory yielded a quantum disordered phase with deconfined , spin-1/2 , charge 0 , bosonic spinons ( the @xmath38 ) and spinless , charge @xmath32 fermions ( @xmath40 ) .    in this paper",
    ", we use another approach and shall examine the phases of the ss model which are obtained naturally in the @xmath49 formulation .",
    "some of the results of our calculations were noted some time ago  @xcite .",
    "while , in the end , we have no formal justification for claiming that the @xmath42 formulation is more accurate than the @xmath43 approach , we can offer the following motivations .",
    "the @xmath11 field formulation has been quite successful in describing the undoped , frustrated antiferromagnet .",
    "the long wavelength action of the undoped antiferromagnet  @xcite is simply the @xmath1 sigma model , @xmath10 , and it is expected to display a quantum - disordered phase in which massive @xmath50 quanta form the lowest excitations and carry spin 1  @xcite .",
    "consistent with this , recent investigations of the quantum - critical behavior in these systems have argued for the superiority of the @xmath50-field based approach , and have successfully explained a number of experimental and numerical computations on the square lattice antiferromagnet  @xcite .",
    "further , careful analysis of fluctuations  @xcite in the @xmath38-based theories of the undoped antiferromagnet has yielded quantum disordered phases in which the quantum numbers of the low - lying excitations are identical to those @xmath50-field , which means that fluctuations in fact confine bosonic spinons into @xmath51 particles .",
    "it is then natural to explore the consequences of doping in a model in which the correct physics in the limit of zero doping is captured most directly _ i.e. _ in the @xmath42 approach .",
    "we shall argue later in this paper , that the results of such an investigation are consistent with the available numerical and experimental data on doped antiferromagnets .",
    "we now discuss the main results of our calculations .",
    "we will distinguish the quantum phases by the properties of the equal - time @xmath11 correlator @xmath52 as @xmath53 , as a function of the momentum @xmath54 .",
    "we emphasize that @xmath55 is _ not _ the full structure factor @xmath56 measured in neutron scattering experiments ; @xmath56 will contain additional terms involving the contribution of the spin-1/2 @xmath18 fields .",
    "phases with magnetic long - range order have a delta function term in @xmath55 at @xmath57 ; this delta function is at @xmath58 in the commensurate long - range - ordered phase ( hereafter referred to as clro ) and at @xmath59 for the case of incommensurate long - range - order ( ilro ) ( @xmath54 is measured from ( @xmath60 ) ) .",
    "the quantum disordered phases have no delta - function terms at @xmath57 , but only a peak of finite , though possibly small , width .",
    "this peak is at @xmath58 in the commensurate quantum - disordered phase ( cqd ) and at @xmath59 in the incommensurate case ( iqd ) . in agreement with the ss analysis  @xcite and experimental results  @xcite ,",
    "the peak in the ilro and iqd phases was found to occur along the conventional @xmath61 and @xmath62 axes of the square lattice ( these are the @xmath63 and @xmath64 axes in our rotated co - ordinate system ) .",
    "we will have little to add here to existing studies  @xcite of the properties of the magnetically - ordered phases ( clro and irlo ) : their low - lying excitations are spin - waves involving long - wavelength deformations of the ordered state .",
    "our focus will mainly be upon the new quantum - disordered phases ( cqd and iqd ) and their unusual properties .",
    "the @xmath11 quanta in both phases were found to be fully gapped .",
    "the low - lying excitations in the @xmath11 sector consist of a triply - degenerate spin-1 particle with a finite energy .",
    "however , the spin-1/2 @xmath18 particles continue to form a fermi sea which possesses gapless fermionic excitations with charge @xmath32 and spin-1/2 . despite the presence of these gapless excitations ,",
    "the @xmath11 gap is robust as there is no term in the ss model which permits the decay of a @xmath11 quantum to a fermion particle - hole pair .",
    "the importance of the absence of the three - body term noted above , is now evident . taken as a whole , the model thus only has a pseudo - gap to spin excitations in the cqd and iqd phases .",
    "one of the consequences of the presence of the gapless spin-1/2 fermions is that the uniform spin susceptibility of the cqd and iqd phases will be finite at @xmath57 due to the pauli contribution  @xcite .",
    "we also note , that our calculation has completely neglected the effect of berry phases ; in the context of undoped antiferromagnets it has been argued  @xcite that berry phases should induce spin - peierls long - range order in the cqd phases .",
    "it is possible that such spin - peierls order will also exist in the cqd phase of the doped antiferromagnet .",
    "we undertook a partial numerical survey of the phase diagram of the ss model as a function of @xmath14 , @xmath36 and the hole density .",
    "parameters were always chosen so that the zero doping state was clro .",
    "this clro state was always found to be stable over a small , but finite , doping concentration . over some of the regime",
    "examined , the sequence of phases with increasing doping was clro - cqd - iqd .",
    "we studied the @xmath57 quantum transition between the clro and cqd phases and will present evidence indicating that it has dynamic critical exponent @xmath0 and the same leading critical behavior as the transition in the pure @xmath1 sigma model ; however , the corrections to scaling in the two models were found to be quite different .",
    "the boundary between the cqd and iqd phases is an example of a disorder line  @xcite : our calculation only found a non - analyticity in the dependence of the structure factor on the bare coupling constants at the disorder line , but no strong long - wavelength fluctuations .    in a region of the phase diagram with @xmath36 large",
    ", we found the sequence clro - ilro with increasing doping . in principle",
    ", there should eventually be a ilro to iqd transition , but for the parameters examined , we did not find one before a doping level where the incommensuration wavevector was almost as large as the momentum upper cutoff .",
    "we will argue from the above numerical results , and from theoretical considerations , that there is a lifshitz point in the @xmath14 , @xmath36 plane where all the four phases - clro , ilro , cqd , iqd - meet .",
    "some properties of this multicritical point will be discussed .",
    "we also have extensive results on the temperature dependence of equal - time correlation functions in the various phases .",
    "in particular , the temperature dependences in the spin correlation length and the structure factor are quite instructive , and will be described later .",
    "for the case of the undoped antiferromagnet , the @xmath65 expansion on the @xmath66 non - linear sigma model offers a convenient and accurate method for exploring properties in the vicinity of @xmath57 quantum transitions  @xcite .",
    "the extension of the @xmath65 expansion to the doped antiferromagnet is however not straightforward because of the presence of the third - rank @xmath67 tensor in @xmath33 ( eqn .",
    "( [ sc ] ) ) , which is special to the case @xmath68 .",
    "even with this complication , it is still possible to justify perturbative 1/n calculations , although in a rather inelegant way : after the fermions have been integrated out , the coupling @xmath36 in the effective action of the @xmath50 field has be to scaled by @xmath69 where @xmath70 . not much is learned from this extension to general @xmath71 , and we will therefore spare the reader the details .",
    "we will be satisfied , instead , in restricting our discussion to the special case of @xmath68 , and viewing our @xmath65 calculation as a physically motivated , self - consistent , interacting magnon approximation .",
    "the magnon - magnon interactions are computed in a manner which is directly inspired by the @xmath65 expansion of the undoped antiferromagnet  @xcite .",
    "an important property of our approach is that spin - rotation invariance is explicitly preserved at all stages of the calculation .",
    "this is crucial for a proper study of the quantum disordered phases of the model , especially when the @xmath50 quanta acquire a gap .",
    "we thus expect our approximations to work best in the quantum - disordered phase , at the @xmath57 quantum transition , and in the intermediate temperature quantum - critical region  @xcite . at the same time , the low temperature properties in a region with magnetic long - range order ( the renormalized classical region  @xcite ) in the ground state , may not be well described . even in the undoped antiferromagnet ,",
    "the @xmath65 expansion is singular in the renormalized - classical region , and a careful interpretation of the results is required  @xcite .",
    "we therefore will focus below here will be mainly on the quantum - disordered phases phases .",
    "we begin by expressing the action in suitable dimensionless parameters .",
    "we rescale lengths such that the upper - cutoff in momentum space for the @xmath50 field is 1 ; thus @xmath72 similarly , the times @xmath6 are rescaled so that the bare spin - wave velocity of the @xmath50 field is unity : @xmath73 after rescaling the temperature @xmath74 we then have the following modified form of @xmath10 @xmath75 where the dimensionless coupling constant @xmath76 is given by @xmath77 the fermionic action will retain its form after rescaling the field @xmath78 and rescaling to the dimensionless effective masses @xmath79 finally in @xmath33 we replace @xmath80 .",
    "we will impose the constraint ( [ const ] ) by a lagrange multiplier field @xmath81 .",
    "thus we need to evaluate the functional integral @xmath82    it is now possible to set up a rotationally - invariant , diagrammatic expansion of all observables associated with @xmath83 .",
    "we will work at finite @xmath9 , and so no breaking of spin rotation invariance can occur ; the properties of the ground state will be elucidated by taking the @xmath53 limit .",
    "we treat the @xmath81 field in much the same way as in the undoped system  @xcite .",
    "we assume that fluctuations of @xmath84 occur about a saddle point value @xmath85 ; we therefore write @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the fluctuating part of @xmath81 .",
    "the value of @xmath85 is to be determined at the end of the calculation to satisfy the constraint ( [ const ] ) .",
    "the diagrammatic expansion now has three bare propagators : the conventional green s function of the fermions @xmath88 , the propagator , @xmath89 , of the @xmath11 field @xmath90 ( @xmath54 is the wavevector and @xmath91 is a matsubara frequency ) and the propagator @xmath92 of @xmath87 , with  @xcite @xmath93 there are two interaction vertices : the four - body @xmath94 coupling in @xmath33 and a three - body @xmath95 vertex with the value @xmath96 .",
    "finally , there is a rule to prevent over - counting : no @xmath87 propagator can be followed by a bubble consisting just of two @xmath89 propagators .",
    "we may now write the fully - renormalized correlator of the @xmath50 field in the form @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the self energy and the ` mass ' @xmath99 is given by @xmath100 the lowest order contributions to @xmath98 from magnon - magnon ( @xmath101 ) and magnon - fermion ( @xmath102 ) interactions are shown in fig  [ feyn ] , and their values are @xmath103 where @xmath104 is polarization of the fermion in valley @xmath20 .",
    "we used the following expression , appropriate for an elliptical fermi surface : @xmath105^{1/2 } } \\right)\\ ] ] and similarly for @xmath106 .",
    "the fermi velocity @xmath107 , the fermi wavevector @xmath108 and the doping concentration @xmath109 are related by the equations @xmath110 and the polarization is taken to vanish unless @xmath111 the prefactor @xmath112 we chose as the compressibility of a free fermi gas at a temperature @xmath9 : @xmath113    our approach consisted of using the above approximation for @xmath98 and then solving the constraint equation ( [ const ] ) , or @xmath114 for the value of @xmath115 ( or equivalently @xmath85 ) .",
    "the dependence of @xmath98 on @xmath116 was made partially self consistent by replacing @xmath85 by @xmath115 in ( [ g0 ] ) , thus using @xmath117 in ( [ pi ] ) and ( [ sigma ] ) . a fully self - consistent approach",
    "would require we replace @xmath89 by @xmath118 in these equations ; this is computationally much more difficult and was not numerically implemented .",
    "our approximation thus amounts to replacing @xmath89 by @xmath118 , but then ignoring the momentum and frequency dependence of the self energy in @xmath118 . for the most part",
    ", this omission is not expected to be serious , as corrections can be organized order by order in @xmath36 .",
    "however , we can not rule out the possibility , especially in the quantum - disordered phases , that there is some entirely different , possibly gapless , solution of the fully self - consistent equations ; such a solution will clearly be non - perturbative in @xmath36 .",
    "we also note here that in our analytical considerations below of the boundaries between the phases , we will include the full @xmath118 in ( [ sigma ] ) .",
    "the numerical determination @xmath115 as a function of @xmath119 was carried out on a hp - risc workstation .",
    "a meaningful solution always existed at all finite @xmath9 , with no phase transitions as a function of @xmath9 or @xmath109 .",
    "phase transitions are however present at @xmath57 , and were examined by studying the @xmath53 limit of our solutions . the computations required about 3 weeks of computer time .",
    "we now describe the results of our numerical calculations .",
    "the nature of the ground state can be determined from the values and @xmath9 dependences of @xmath120 and @xmath121 where @xmath122 is the location of the maximum of @xmath123 , and @xmath124 it is easy to see from ( [ gfunc ] ) that @xmath121 is roughly the inverse correlation length ( ` roughly ' because this neglects @xmath125 ; including this term yields corrections of the order of unity which are not strongly @xmath9 dependent ) .",
    "the various phases can be identified by studying the @xmath9 dependence of @xmath121 as @xmath53 , as will be described below .",
    "the values of @xmath120 were approximately @xmath9 independent and distinguish between commensurate and incommensurate phases .",
    "two samples of our results are contained in figs .",
    "[ mbar1 ] and  [ mbar2 ] which plot the @xmath9 and doping dependence of @xmath121 for two sets of coupling constants . for completeness",
    "we also show in figs  [ m1 ] and  [ m2 ] the values of @xmath99 for the same samples .",
    "we will now describe the properties of the phases in these figures and follow that up with some general discussion on the nature of the quantum transitions between them .",
    "the states with magnetic order are expected to have @xmath126 as @xmath53 . in particular ,",
    "the low @xmath9 dependence should be  @xcite @xmath127 where @xmath128 is the fully renormalized spin stiffness .",
    "numerical solutions at very lower @xmath9 took longer times to converge , so it was difficult to see this exponential behavior in some of the doped samples .",
    "we simply identified the samples in which @xmath121 vanished with an upward curvature as @xmath129 , as possessing magnetic long - range order .",
    "further states with @xmath130 ( @xmath131 ) were identified as clro ( ilro ) .",
    "these states have @xmath121 saturating at a finite value as @xmath53 , which is roughly the gap , @xmath132 , in the @xmath50 sector .",
    "again , the value of @xmath120 distinguishes between the cqd and iqd states .",
    "we examine the nature of the spin correlations at a point in the iqd phase by plotting the @xmath50 field contribution to the structure factor , @xmath133 , @xmath134 in fig .",
    "notice that there is strong overlap between the peaks at high temperature . upon lowering the temperature ,",
    "the peaks first sharpen considerably , but then their width saturates .",
    "let us discuss the form of the @xmath50 spectrum at @xmath57 in the cqd phase .",
    "we will focus on real frequencies , @xmath135 just above the gap @xmath136 , and small momenta @xmath54 .",
    "the magnon contribution to the self energy , @xmath101 in ( [ sigma ] ) does not acquire an imaginary part until @xmath137 and can therefore be completely ignored .",
    "the damping from the fermion particle - hole continuum , @xmath102 is however not so innocuous .",
    "we find  @xcite @xmath138 and @xmath139 .",
    "the @xmath50 spectral weight is then given by @xmath140 from the above results it follows that at @xmath58 we have @xmath141 for some constants @xmath142 .",
    "thus there is a sharp spin-1 quasiparticle peak , and a second background term which is a direct consequence of the coupling of the @xmath50 quanta to the particle - hole continuum . at small , but finite @xmath54",
    ", the sharp peak moves to @xmath143 and acquires a finite width ; there is absorption at all frequencies greater than @xmath136 .",
    "the spectral properties of the iqd phase are essentially identical except that the role of the point @xmath58 is replaced by @xmath122 ; in obtaining this result it is , of course , necessary to replace @xmath89 by @xmath118 in ( [ sigma ] ) .      our results in figs .",
    "[ mbar1 ] and  [ mbar2 ] show two sequences of quantum transitions with increasing doping : clro - cqd - iqd and clro - ilro . in the second case there",
    "should eventually be a ilro to iqd transition , but for the parameters examined , we did not find one before a doping level where the incommensuration wavevector was almost as large as the momentum upper cutoff .",
    "we now present a theoretical analysis of some issues raised by the existence of these quantum transitions .",
    "an important ingredient in determining the universality class of this transition is the analytic structure of the @xmath50 field self - energy @xmath102 as @xmath144 in the nel phase and the quantum - critical point .",
    "we consider ( [ sigma ] ) in the limit @xmath145 , and @xmath144 when the frequencies become continuous variables , and the matsubara summations can be converted to integrations .",
    "it is evident that @xmath146 is an even function of @xmath135 .",
    "moreover , it is not difficult to show that there are no infra - red divergences in either @xmath147 or @xmath148 .",
    "this implies that for @xmath149 small we have @xmath150 thus the gapless fermion particle - hole sea has not induced any non - analyticities in @xmath102 to this order .",
    "there are indeed non - analytic terms present at higher order in @xmath102 which are signaled by infra - red divergences in higher derivatives of @xmath102 ; we will discuss the form of such terms below .",
    "for our purposes , it is sufficient to note here that all such higher gradient terms are expected to be irrelevant at the clro to cqd transition .",
    "thus the gapless fermion particle - hole excitations have had a relatively innocuous effect : they have mainly lead to renormalizations of the spin - wave velocity and spin stiffness .",
    "the universality class of the clro - cqd transition is thus expected to be the same as that in the undoped sigma model .",
    "this is a transition with dynamic critical exponent @xmath0 and its leading universal properties have been discussed in some detail by chubukov _ et .",
    "all of the scaling functions of chubukov _ et . al . _",
    "@xcite should therefore also apply to the present doped antiferromagnet .",
    "the main effect of the fermions has been to change the value of the effective coupling constant and renormalize the spin - wave velocity .",
    "consistent with this identification , observe the linear dependence of @xmath121 with @xmath9 in fig .",
    "[ mbar1 ] at @xmath151 over a wide temperature region .",
    "this value of @xmath108 places the system quite close to the quantum - critical point as the value of @xmath136 is very small . at the quantum - critical point of the sigma model",
    ", it is predicted that @xmath152 with @xmath153 a universal number .",
    "the slope of @xmath99 versus @xmath9 at @xmath151 in fig .",
    "[ mbar1 ] is about @xmath154 - this matches with the expected result if there is renormalization of spin - wave velocity @xmath155 .",
    "a renormalization of the spin - wave velocity of order unity is to be expected , as the fermionic polarization @xmath156 in ( [ chival ] ) is not suppressed by a factor that vanishes as @xmath157",
    ". differences between the quantum transition in the doped and undoped antiferromagnet do however show up at the correction to scaling level .",
    "the higher - order non - analytic terms in @xmath102 will have a form which is quite specific to the doped model .",
    "one such term can be obtained by analytically continuing to real frequencies and computing @xmath158 at the critical point .",
    "we find @xmath159      the existence of a direct clro to ilro transition in fig .",
    "[ mbar2 ] has a strong consequence for the phase diagram of the ss model .",
    "as both phases can be transformed into their quantum - disordered partners simply by increasing the value of @xmath76 , we conclude that there must be a point in the phase diagram where all the four phases - clro , cqd , irlo , and iqd - meet .",
    "such a point is called a lifshitz point  @xcite .",
    "lifshitz points have so far been studied primarily in the context of thermal transitions in classical spin systems  @xcite .",
    "an important result is that such points can exist only above a lower critical dimension determined as follows  @xcite : a system in @xmath160 dimensions , with incommensurate instabilities in @xmath99 of those dimensions , has lower critical dimension @xmath161 .",
    "this result appears to be in conflict with our results here for the doped antiferromagnet .",
    "for we have incommensuration in @xmath162 spatial dimensions , giving a lower critical dimensionality equal to the spacetime dimension @xmath163 .",
    "so how can a lifshitz point exist ?",
    "the answer to this apparent inconsistency lies in the form of @xmath102 . at the lifshitz point",
    "we clearly have @xmath164 .",
    "thus the leading @xmath54 dependence of @xmath165 at small @xmath54 will come from higher - order terms in @xmath102 .",
    "let us assume that @xmath166 at the lifshitz point . inserting this fully renormalized @xmath118 in the result ( [ sigma ] ) for @xmath102 we find by power",
    "counting @xmath167 consistency now demands that @xmath168 which yields @xmath169 .",
    "this differs from the value @xmath170 use in classical spin systems  @xcite . with this modified form of @xmath118",
    "we may repeat the calculation of grest and sak  @xcite and verify that spacetime dimension @xmath163 is above the lower critical dimension which is @xmath171 .",
    "thus it is possible to have a lifshitz point in @xmath163 .",
    "finally we note that a point where clro , ilro , cqd , and iqd phases meet was also found in the large @xmath71 , @xmath172 theory of frustrated , two - dimensional quantum heisenberg antiferromagnets  @xcite .",
    "the nature of this point appears to be quite different from the lifshitz point in the present theory .",
    "in particular , the iqd phase of the @xmath172 frustrated antiferromagnets  @xcite contains deconfined , bosonic , spin-1/2 spinons , while here we have found massive , triply - degenerate @xmath50 quanta . perhaps related to this difference",
    "is the fact that the large @xmath71 @xmath172 theory  @xcite finds no softening in the spinon spectrum at the cqd - iqd boundary .",
    "instead , at the boundary the parabolic spinon spectrum splits into two parabola with minima at incommensurate points ; the curvature at the minima of the parabola always remains finite .",
    "contrast this with the behavior of the @xmath50 spectrum found here : the curvature at the minimum of the @xmath50 spectrum vanishes at the cqd - iqd boundary leading to double minima at incommensurate points in the iqd phase .",
    "the most notable features of our results on lightly - doped antiferromagnets are the quantum disordered phases with a spin pseudo - gap .",
    "these phases posses fully - gapped , triply - degenerate , spin 1 magnons , and gapless , spin-1/2 , charge @xmath32 fermions .",
    "several other investigators  @xcite have also recently explored models of the normal state of the lightly - doped cuprates which have spin gaps / pseudo - gaps .",
    "this interest in pseudo - gaps is of course motivated by numerous experiments on the underdoped cuprates showing gap - like features in the normal state .",
    "@xcite there are also interesting trends in the doping and temperature dependence of uniform spin susceptibility of the cuprates  @xcite .",
    "for completeness we review some of the previous theoretical results , and point out the differences to our results .",
    "a number of the models  @xcite are related to resonating - valence - bond type mean - field theories  @xcite ; there is a bcs - like pairing of spin-1/2 , neutral spinons in the normal state at low - doping , leading to a gap - like feature in the spectrum at finite temperature .",
    "however , unlike our results , this state extrapolates to a true gap at @xmath57 .",
    "an extension of these models to a three - band , @xmath173 layer model  @xcite did posses gapless , spin-1/2 , charge @xmath32 fermionic excitations on the oxygen sites .",
    "however the above - gap spectrum in all of these models  @xcite consists of unbound spin-1/2 , neutral fermions ; in contrast , the spin spectral weight above the gap of our model is dominated by a spin-1 , bosonic magnon .",
    "millis and monien have attributed the gaps to interlayer couplings in the yttrium based cuprates  @xcite .",
    "the recent work of sokol , pines and collaborators  @xcite is perhaps closest in spirit to ours , although their scenario for the mixing between the @xmath50 quanta and the fermions appears to be somewhat different .    also relevant to our result",
    "is the recent high temperature series analysis of the clro to cqd transition in the @xmath174 model  @xcite .",
    "this work provides some evidence in support of our result that @xmath0 at this transition .",
    "finally , if our model is to provide a complete picture of the cuprates , it should also explain the nature of the photo - emission spectrum  @xcite .",
    "for this one needs to understand better the connection between the bare electron ejected in the photo - emission and the @xmath175 fields .",
    "this problem is currently under investigation .",
    "the research was supported by nsf grant no .",
