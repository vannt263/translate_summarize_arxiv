    "from a multitude of experimental observations , quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) has emerged as the well - established theory of strong interactions .",
    "however , the smallness of cp violation in strong interactions has been a puzzle in particle physics since the 1970s when it was realised that the qcd lagrangian violates cp due to instanton effects @xcite . the cp violation in strong interactions",
    "is described by the strong cp phase @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the coefficient of @xmath7 , @xmath8 is the field strength tensor of qcd , @xmath9 its dual , and @xmath10 is the contribution from the quark masses . while @xmath6 and @xmath11 are transformed into each other via a chiral transformation , the combination @xmath12 stays invariant .",
    "the most stringent limits originate from experimental bounds on the electric dipole moment of the neutron and result in @xmath13  @xcite , which is much smaller than the jarlskog invariant , @xmath14  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the strong cp problem is the question why the two contributions to @xmath12 sum up to such a small number .",
    "there are three main ideas to explain the smallness of strong cp violation .",
    "the first and simplest solution is that one of the quarks is massless @xcite . in this case",
    "the strong cp phase @xmath15 is unphysical , since it can be absorbed in the massless quark by a phase transformation .",
    "however , recent data strongly suggests that all quarks are massive @xcite .",
    "the second very popular solution is the axion solution @xcite where @xmath12 is promoted to a dynamical degree of freedom which is set to small values by a potential . this solution is very elegant but albeit there have been extensive searches for axions there have been no experimental hints for their existence so far @xcite .",
    "the third approach solves the strong cp problem by breaking parity ( or cp ) spontaneously . as the topological term @xmath7 violates parity ( as well as cp ) , there are two possibilities to forbid it by either imposing parity and/or cp , which we will briefly discuss in the following .",
    "\\(i ) left - right symmetric theories naturally conserve parity and therefore predict @xmath16 .",
    "this has been pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite and further developed in ref .",
    "although the yukawa couplings are hermitian , a solution to the strong cp problem requires that the breaking of parity does not introduce a complex phase in the mass matrices via a complex phase of a vacuum expectation value ( vev ) .",
    "however , there are several viable models in the literature .",
    "see , e.g. , @xcite for non - supersymmetric models and ref .",
    "@xcite for a supersymmetric ( susy ) model .",
    "\\(ii ) promoting cp to a fundamental symmetry of the lagrangian sets @xmath17 . in order to explain the cp violation in weak processes , cp has to be broken spontaneously  @xcite in such a way that @xmath18 stays sufficiently small , while the cp violation in weak interactions is large . the most popular class of models accommodating this are the nelson - barr models @xcite .",
    "see , for instance , ref .",
    "@xcite for a minimal implementation as well as ref .",
    "@xcite for an implementation within susy . in supersymmetry",
    "the smallness of the strong cp phase is further protected by the non - renormalization theorems  @xcite .",
    "this has been used in the susy model of ref .",
    "@xcite , where a large ckm phase is generated by renormalization group running .",
    "obviously , it is also possible to invoke parity as well as cp conservation to address the strong cp problem , which has been used in an extra - dimensional model with split fermion profiles in ref .",
    "recently , fong and nardi  @xcite showed that by promoting the yukawa couplings to spurions of the maximal @xmath19 flavour symmetry , the spurion potential results in a real determinant and therefore a solution of the strong cp problem .",
    "nevertheless , the class of models proposed here is based as well on spontaneous cp violation , but different to the previously mentioned class of models by using a specific texture of quark mass matrices . as we will discuss in the next section , where we outline our strategy ,",
    "our class of models is based on a sum rule for the phases in the ckm matrix @xcite suggesting a simple structure for quark mass matrices with either real or purely imaginary elements @xcite .",
    "see , for example , @xcite for an incomplete list of models with different mass matrix textures .",
    "this simple structure finds a natural realisation in flavour models based on non - abelian discrete family symmetries where the cp symmetry is spontaneously broken with a method dubbed discrete vacuum alignment @xcite .",
    "this method was previously used in various flavour models @xcite .    before presenting the details ,",
    "let us highlight the main ingredients and achievements : ( i ) we use non - abelian discrete family symmetries , which allow an implementation of our solution to the strong cp problem in successful models of flavour .",
    "this is the first paper addressing the strong cp problem with non - abelian discrete family symmetries to our knowledge .",
    "( ii ) it uses the discrete vacuum alignment mechanism  @xcite , which also predicts the cp phases of the vevs up to a discrete choice .",
    "( iii ) the implementation in a susy theory protects the smallness of the strong cp phase by the non - renormalization theorems  @xcite .",
    "( iv ) the main prediction of our toy model , besides the smallness of the strong cp phase , is the correct prediction of the ckm phase , while all other flavour parameters in the quark sector can be accommodated .",
    "our paper is organised as follows .",
    "after presenting the general strategy for our solution to the strong cp problem in sec .",
    "[ sec : strategy ] , we discuss several contributions to the strong cp phase @xmath15 from susy breaking in sec .  [",
    "sec : susybreaking ] . in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] , we discuss a model of quark flavour , which implements our solution to the strong cp problem and compare it to models based on spontaneous breaking of cp in sec .  [",
    "sec : nelsonbarr ] . finally , we conclude in sec .  [",
    "sec : conclusions ] .",
    "in this paper we present a solution for the strong cp problem based on spontaneous cp violation .",
    "if cp is a fundamental symmetry of the lagrangian , the strong cp phase @xmath15 will vanish .",
    "however , in order to explain cp violation in weak interactions , the spontaneous breaking of cp has to explain the large value of the ckm phase , while the strong cp phase @xmath12 vanishes or is tiny enough to be in agreement with experimental data .    in other words",
    "we have to look for a texture with @xmath20 and a realistic value for the ckm phase . furthermore",
    ", if we do not want to assume cancellations between the phases in the up and the down sector @xmath21 and @xmath22 should be real and positive by itself already .",
    "one possible choice is , for instance , that @xmath23 is completely real and has negligible 1 - 3 mixing , and that @xmath24 where @xmath25 are some real entries .",
    "the only non - trivial complex phase appears in the 2 - 2 element of @xmath26 and the determinants of both mass matrices are real .",
    "note that for simplicity we assume here both signs of the determinants to be positive .",
    "if this structure of the mass matrices can be realised from the spontaneous breaking of cp we would indeed have a solution for the strong cp problem .",
    "and furthermore this very simple structure can also correctly reproduce the right quark unitarity triangle , as it was demonstrated in @xcite , since it satisfies the phase sum rule @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the angle of the ckm unitarity triangle measured to be close to @xmath29 @xcite and @xmath30 are the phases of the complex 1 - 2 mixing angles diagonalizing the quark mass matrices ( for the conventions used , see @xcite ) .",
    "now any model , which generates such a structure can do the trick , but the question is , whether such models exist .    before we will discuss a toy model in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] we outline how this could be achieved in the context of discrete family symmetries which have gained a lot of attention for describing the mixing in the lepton sector .",
    "suppose we have a family symmetry @xmath31 with triplet representations ( we will use later on @xmath32 , but @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , etc .",
    "would work equally well ) .",
    "see ref .",
    "@xcite for a recent review on flavour symmetries",
    ". then we assume the right - handed down - type quarks to transform as triplets under @xmath31 while all other quarks are singlets .",
    "the rows of @xmath26 are then proportional to the vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) of family symmetry breaking higgs fields , the so - called flavon fields , which are triplets under @xmath31 .",
    "@xmath23 is generated by vevs of singlet flavon fields .    introducing four flavon triplets with the following alignments in flavour space @xmath36 which can be achieved by standard vacuum alignment techniques we can reproduce the desired structure for @xmath26 .",
    "note that we have explicitly written out any complex phases ( we assume @xmath37 , @xmath38 , to be real while only @xmath39 is purely imaginary ) .",
    "indeed it is not quite trivial to fix the phases of these vevs .",
    "the method described in @xcite , which we want to sketch here for a singlet flavon field @xmath40 , is one possibility to achieve it .",
    "suppose @xmath40 is charged under a discrete @xmath41 symmetry and apart from that neutral then we can write down a superpotential for @xmath40 @xmath42 where @xmath43 is a total singlet and @xmath44 and @xmath45 mass scales .",
    "we have dropped prefactors for brevity and since we assume fundamental cp symmetry these prefactors and the mass scales are real .. it agrees with the ordinary cp transformation for real representations of @xmath32 .",
    "see @xcite for a recent discussion of generalised cp in the context of non - abelian discrete symmetries . ] without loss of generality we assume the prefactors and @xmath46 to be positive : a possible relative sign can be absorbed by changing @xmath47 to @xmath48 . from the potential for @xmath40 , @xmath49 the vev of @xmath40 has to satisfy @xmath50 and hence @xmath51 here the phases of the vevs do not depend on potential parameters , a situation which has been dubbed calculable phases in the literature@xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite this phenomenon was interpreted as the result of an accidental cp symmetry of the potential .",
    "the same discussion applies here . for a real coupling , the potential ( [ eq : w - strucutre ] ) is invariant under the cp transformation @xmath52 with @xmath53 .",
    "this generalized cp transformation emerges as an accidental symmetry of the potential but will be explicitly broken elsewhere ( e.g. in the couplings to the matter sector ) .",
    "if the whole lagrangian was invariant under this cp transformation , then there would be no cp violation in physical observables .",
    "we furthermore note that it is necessary to break cp with two different fields  @xcite , such that it is impossible to define a cp transformation , which is left invariant by the vevs , and cp is spontaneously broken .",
    "the interplay between the different flavon fields will ensure that cp is broken in our model , as will be discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : model : symmetries ] .    using these ingredients",
    "we will present in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] a consistent flavour model with spontaneous cp violation for the quark sector which resembles a real @xmath23 and the structure of @xmath26 from eq .  .    due to the stringent constraints on @xmath12 , special care needs to be taken with corrections to this parameter",
    "the most important corrections are :    * higher dimensional contributions to the superpotential that would spoil the structure of the mass matrices . *",
    "corrections which are induced from susy breaking terms .    in the following we will discuss these corrections . the first point will be addressed by introducing shaping symmetries fixing the phases of the flavon vevs as well as by specifying the messenger sector which gives us full control over all higher order operators .",
    "even a small higher order contribution @xmath54 would contribute to @xmath12 as @xmath55 which has to be smaller than @xmath56 .",
    "the same applies to corrections coming from the susy sector of the theory which we discuss in the upcoming section .",
    "there are two important consequences when a solution to the strong cp problem is applied to a susy model : on the one hand , as long as susy is unbroken , non - renormalisation theorems guarantee that @xmath12 will not be generated radiatively at any loop order . on the other hand ,",
    "the susy breaking sector can in principle also introduce new sources of cp violation , which can then have an impact on @xmath12 ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "before we turn to the construction of an example flavour model where our strategy of sec .",
    "[ sec : strategy ] is realised , let us therefore discuss the possible corrections to @xmath12 from susy breaking .",
    "we note that although our general strategy applies also to non - susy models , our example model will be formulated in a susy framework and also our method to fix the phases of the flavon vevs , and thus the phases of the mass matrix entries , relies on susy .",
    "to illustrate the possible effects of susy breaking on @xmath12 , we start by noting that with a general complex gluino mass parameter @xmath57 , @xmath12 would get an additional contribution of the form @xmath58 .",
    "furthermore , there is a contribution from susy loop corrections to the quark mass matrices and the gluino mass , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : susytheta ] . in general",
    "these corrections depend on plenty of susy breaking parameters , for instance , on the trilinear couplings .",
    "explicit formulae can be found , e.g.  in @xcite .",
    "also in the mssm with complex parameters the higgs vevs @xmath59 and @xmath60 can become complex and may in principle introduce additional cp violating phases .",
    "however , fortunately , many of these potential sources of corrections to @xmath12 are safely under control . due to our assumption that the fundamental theory conserves cp",
    ", one could easily imagine that the susy breaking potential by itself does not introduce cp breaking .",
    "then , parameters like @xmath57 and the @xmath61 parameter are real and various potential corrections to @xmath12 vanish .",
    "5 cm @xmath62    5 cm @xmath63    in this case , the discussion of corrections from susy breaking boils down to the question of how well the conventional susy flavour and cp problem is solved . in this paper",
    ", we will not construct an explicit susy breaking sector , but rather refer to the discussion on this issue which already exists in the literature , and add some remarks on the connection to non - abelian family symmetries : to start with , it has been discussed , e.g.  in @xcite , that anomaly mediation or gauge mediation can in principle provide useful frameworks . in the context of flavour models with abelian symmetries , a solution by `` flavour alignment '' has been suggested by nir and seiberg in ref .",
    "@xcite and a discussion in the context of solutions to the strong cp problem can be found in @xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "flavour models with non - abelian family symmetries by themselves can provide promising frameworks for solving the susy flavour problem ( see , e.g. @xcite ) . with the three families of matter fields embedded into triplet representations of a non - abelian family symmetry group @xmath31 ,",
    "the soft terms are universal before family symmetry breaking , and non - universalities only get induced after spontaneous @xmath31 breaking .",
    "this allows to control the flavour ( and cp ) structure of the susy breaking terms in explicit `` susy - flavour '' models .",
    "when constructing a `` susy - flavour '' model of this type , care has to be taken of the contributions to the soft terms from flavon @xmath64-terms @xcite .",
    "these contributions are especially relevant , because if cp symmetry is broken by the flavon vevs , their @xmath64-terms can in principle generate a cp violating non - universality in the @xmath65-terms and might thereby introduce a sizeable contribution to @xmath12 , e.g.  via the diagrams in fig .",
    "[ fig : susytheta ] . in a supergravity scenario with sequestered khler and superpotential ( as , e.g.  in @xcite ) , universalities in the @xmath65-terms would only stem from the flavon @xmath64-terms , so controlling them is crucial . in @xcite",
    "it has been argued that their size is typically of the order @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is the gravitino mass and @xmath68 is a flavon vev , which could easily spoil the solution to the strong cp problem .",
    "however , it has been shown in @xcite that the flavon @xmath64-terms are strongly suppressed for flavon superpotentials with driving fields , as we are going to use in this paper , by powers of @xmath69 , with @xmath45 being the messenger scale of the flavour model .",

    "such a suppression would render them harmless to the solution of the strong cp problem . without going into further details ,",
    "we conclude that models of the class we propose in this paper , amended by a suitable susy breaking sector , have the potential to be safe from dangerously large corrections to @xmath12 .",
    "in this section we aim to flesh out the preceding discussion by constructing an explicit model which conforms to the general strategy discussed in section  [ sec : strategy ] and assume a susy breaking sector along the lines of the discussion in the preceding section .",
    "while the model presented here only discusses the quark sector , it employs model building techniques that were primarily used to describe the lepton sector .",
    "there , it has been long known to be useful to assign the left - handed lepton doublets to three - dimensional irreducible representations of some non - abelian flavour group .",
    "after the discrete flavour symmetry is broken in carefully chosen directions in flavour space ( usually corresponding to invariant subgroups of named groups ) , mixing angles can be predicted ( see , for example , @xcite for an overview ) .      for our model we will use the group @xmath70 , the smallest discrete group with a three - dimensional irreducible representation @xmath71 in the basis which is sometimes called the ma - rajasekaran@xcite basis .",
    "we follow an approach to flavour model building which employs three scalar fields ( flavons ) @xmath72 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 transforming as triplets and breaking the group @xmath32 via the vevs @xmath75 down to the subgroups generated by @xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 , respectively .",

    "we can repeat the same analysis here .",
    "it can easily be checked that as the messengers only produce operators where the fields @xmath94 appear squared , the relevant accidental symmetry @xmath95 of table  [ tab : acc - symm ] that enforces the vev directions is left - unbroken by the additional higher - dimensional operators .",
    "there are thus no corrections to the leading - order vev structure ( their magnitude might of course be slightly corrected ) . also the accidental cp transformation of eq .",

    "finally , let us briefly comment on the effects anomalies might have on our results .",
    "the gauge symmetries remain anomaly free ( after adding the leptons ) , because we do not add new chiral fermions , which are charged under the standard model gauge group .",
    "in addition , as we do not introduce non - trivial singlet representations of @xmath32 , the @xmath32 group is anomaly free , but some of the auxiliary @xmath41 symmetries appear to be anomalous .",

    ", we can not make definite statements about anomalies but we assume that the effects of anomalies are either cancelled in the complete theory or sufficiently small .",
    "in this section we want to discuss how our class of models is related to other models explaining the smallness of the strong cp phase by a spontaneous breaking of cp .",
    "we will especially focus on the nelson - barr models of spontaneous cp violation @xcite being the first and most studied models .",
    "although there are certain similarities , our model , for instance , does not fulfil the barr criteria @xcite :    he classified the fields in two sets , the low energy fermions @xmath64 and heavy vector - like fermions @xmath103 .",
    "then , there are two sufficient conditions for a solution of the strong cp problem :    1 .   at the tree level",

    "in such a setup the determinant of the mass matrices is real and the anomalous contribution to @xmath12 hence vanishes .    in our class of models ,",
    "the @xmath64 fields are the ordinary quark fields and the @xmath107 fields are the heavy messenger fields , see sec .",
    "[ sec : messenger ] . as all messengers carry a non - vanishing @xmath108 charge , there are no @xmath109 mass terms .",
    "furthermore since the only allowed yukawa coupling on a renormalisable level is the ( real ) top yukawa coupling , condition 2 is fulfilled as well .",
    "however , there are couplings of the @xmath64 fields to @xmath105 as well as @xmath104 and therefore condition 1 is not satisfied .",
    "let us now have a closer look at the mass matrices in the full theory following ref .",
    "@xcite to understand why the strong cp phase vanishes .",
    "it is straightforward to see that the determinant of the up - type quark mass matrix is real , since all couplings are real due to the imposed cp symmetry and the only flavon with a complex vev , @xmath96 , does not couple to the up sector .",
    "therefore , it remains to study the mass matrix @xmath110 in the down - type sector , where in our case @xmath111 with flavour index @xmath38 .",
    "note that we have labelled here the components of the messengers with the same @xmath112 as the down - type quarks with the same letter as the fields before symmetry breaking for the sake of simplicity .",
    "we find then @xmath113 where we have dropped order one coefficients and note that the matrix is not quadratic because we have not expanded all flavour indices .    in the nelson - barr models",
    "the entries above the messenger masses or left of the messenger masses vanish , which is not satisfied in our model . and in fact , calculating the determinant naively and using arbitrary complex vevs for the flavons the determinant would be complex and the strong cp problem would not be solved .",
    "however , inserting the alignment of the flavon vevs we find for the determinant @xmath114 where we have again dropped ( real ) order one coefficients .",
    "all flavon vevs in eq .",
    "are real due the flavon vev alignment mechanism and hence the determinant is real . together with the real determinant of the up - type quark mass matrix , the total anomalous correction of the quarks and heavy messengers to @xmath12 vanishes .",
    "the main difference to other models based on spontaneous breaking of cp as solution are the textures of the quark mass matrices .",
    "for example , the models in ref .",
    "@xcite rely on triangular quark mass matrices .",
    "as long as the vevs of the higgs coupling to the diagonal do not receive a complex vev , the determinants are real and hence @xmath16 . the solution proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite by masiero and yanagida relies on the generation of hermitian quark mass matrices using flavon fields in the adjoint representation of the family symmetry @xmath115 . this is similar to the solution in left - right symmetric models .",
    "in this work we have studied a novel approach to solve the strong cp problem in the context of spontaneous cp violation without the need for an axion .",
    "we assume cp to be a fundamental symmetry of nature and use discrete , abelian and non - abelian ( family ) symmetries to break it in such a way that the anomalous contribution to the cp violating qcd parameter @xmath12 from the quark mass matrices vanishes at tree - level . simultaneously the ckm phase is predicted to have its observed large value in a natural way",
    ".    an essential ingredient of this approach is that the phases of the symmetry breaking vevs are fixed to certain discrete values with either being real or purely imaginary in the simplest possible setup . in our toy model",
    "we have used for this purpose the discrete vacuum alignment method proposed in @xcite .",
    "this method is based on supersymmetry and hence the class of models which we propose here is supersymmetric although in principle a non - supersymmetric version reproducing the texture from eq .",
    "could do the same trick .",
    "but in fact , supersymmetry does not only help to fix the flavon vev phases but it also forbids via the non - renormalisation theorem the appearance of new , unwanted operators in the superpotential from loop corrections , which could spoil our solution for the strong cp problem .",
    "in fact , as long as susy remains unbroken @xmath12 remains zero on the perturbative level .",
    "furthermore , if the susy breaking sector itself conserves cp and respects the discrete ( family ) symmetries the strong cp phase can still be expected to be small enough to be in agreement with experimental data .",
    "this remains true even after inclusion of supergravity effects which are known to possibly cause a sizeable misalignment for the trilinear susy breaking couplings compared to the yukawa couplings .    to demonstrate that our suggested class of models is in principle realistic ,",
    "we present an explicit supersymmetric toy flavour model for the quark sector based on the family symmetry @xmath32 with an @xmath116 symmetry and the shaping symmetry @xmath117 . the shaping symmetry does not only forbid unwanted operators in our superpotential but also provides a mechanism to fix the phases of the flavon vevs via the discrete vacuum alignment method .",
    "we present an uv completion of the model in that sense that we give a list of heavy messenger fields which generate the desired effective operators after being integrated out .",
    "this uv completion is very predictive because it defines in combination with the symmetries the set of allowed operators up to an arbitrary mass dimension .",
    "hence , we can show explicitly that our solution for the strong cp problem is not affected by higher order corrections ( ignoring non - perturbative and susy breaking effects ) .",
    "finally , we discuss the relation between our novel class of models to the well known nelson - barr models @xcite as well as other models which also solve the strong cp problem in terms of spontaneous cp violation . in the nelson - barr models direct couplings between the light sector and the heavy sector",
    "are partially forbidden in such a way that the total mass matrix exhibits a special block structure .",
    "this is different in our class of models , where all light fields can couple to all heavy messenger fields in principle .",
    "the determinant of the total mass matrix in their case is real due to the mentioned block structure , while in our case it is real due to our vacuum alignment ( including phases ) .",
    "the class of models presented here casts new light on an old problem , the strong cp problem .",
    "there have been several previous attempts to solve it in terms of spontaneous cp violation in combination with flavour symmetries but our strategy differs significantly from the other approaches .",
    "most notably , we simultaneously have large cp violation in the ckm matrix with a right - angled unitarity triangle in a natural way , without any contribution to @xmath12 from the quark mass matrices .",
    "furthermore , the techniques to handle the symmetry breaking of discrete non - abelian family symmetries , like in our example model @xmath32 , was first developed in the context of the large leptonic mixing angles and finds here an unexpected new application .",
    "also the method to fix the flavon vev phases was developed to give a dynamical explanation for the phase sum rule but was then in succeeding papers used in the lepton sector as well .",
    "of course , as a next step , it will be interesting , for instance , to study the embedding of this mechanism in a gut context and the consequences for cosmology , e.g.  for baryogenesis via the leptogenesis mechanism .",
    "the work of m.  spinrath was supported by the erc advanced grant no .",
    "267985 `` damesyfla '' , by the eu marie curie itn `` unilhc '' ( pitn - ga-2009 - 237920 ) and the european union fp7 itn invisibles ( marie curie actions , pitn - ga-2011 - 289442-invisibles ) .",
    "the work of s.  antusch was supported by the swiss national science foundation .",
    "this work was supported in part by the australian research council .",
    "to fix the phases of the flavon vevs we have introduced a generic driving field @xmath43 .",
    "but in fact , we need as many copies of @xmath43 as phases we want to fix . in the appendix of @xcite , it was explicitly shown for two flavon and @xmath43 fields how this form can be achieved after a suitable basis choice for the @xmath43 fields . here",
    "we want to extend the discussion to the case of an arbitrary number of fields .",
    "say we have a theory with @xmath119 flavon fields @xmath120 out of which we can form @xmath121 ( @xmath122 ) total singlet operators @xmath123 of order @xmath124 and @xmath125",
    ". we can then introduce ( at least ) @xmath121 fields @xmath126 with r - charge @xmath127 couple to the operators @xmath128 . ] .",
    "the @xmath116 symmetric superpotential involving the @xmath126 fields is given by @xmath129 where @xmath130 is a real ( because of cp ) and invertible matrix and @xmath131 is real ( again , because of cp ) with either sign .",
    "the @xmath121 f - term conditions @xmath132 give the @xmath121 conditions @xmath133 on the phases .",
    "invertability of @xmath134 implies @xmath135 for all @xmath136 , or @xmath137 note that the @xmath138 are integer valued and bounded by @xmath139 , the maximal considered operator dimension . to determine all phases of the @xmath94",
    "the number of operators @xmath121 should be larger or equal to @xmath119 , the number of fields .    in any case , the preceding discussion shows that one can always introduce fields @xmath43 such that the conditions @xmath140 are enforced .",
    "a concrete implementation of the p sector is therefore not necessary as long as the operator @xmath128 set is specified and our discussion in the main part of the text goes through . in our case",
    "the operator set consists of ( to leading order ) @xmath119 operators of the form @xmath141 , @xmath142 .",
    "because of this construction , we can predict non - trivial phases .",
    "the very same arguments apply for the fields @xmath143 , @xmath74 and @xmath97 because there are no higher - dimensional operators correcting their phases .",
    "we can decouple them from the other flavons in the above mentioned way and we find the quoted phases for them .",
    "it is slightly more complicated for the other fields because the higher - dimensional operators introduce some mixing between the flavons and it is not possible to go to the convenient basis for the @xmath43 fields .",
    "however the additional terms can not alter our alignment and phases because they preserve the accidental @xmath95 and cp symmetry of the superpotential without higher order corrections , as we discussed in section [ sec : messenger ] .",
    "alternatively one could expand the vevs around their real leading order values and show that they remain real to all orders by choosing appropriate signs and moduli of the couplings of the higher - dimensional operators .",
