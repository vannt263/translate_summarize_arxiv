    "since the seminal work of murakami  @xcite , a bilayer ( bl ) of bismuth in the ( 111 ) orientation is theoretically considered  @xcite as one of the few two - dimensional ( 2d ) electron systems , besides hgte/(hg , cd)te quantum wells  @xcite , which should show the quantum spin hall effect , and enter the quantum anomalous spin hall phase by magnetic doping  @xcite . the experimental realization of the bi bl as a 2d topological insulator ( ti ) in a solid state environment remains challenging because of the need to find a suitable substrate which ( i ) enables epitaxial growth of the bi bl and ( ii ) sufficiently decouples the electronic states of the bl from the substrate electrons in order to protect the predicted 1d topological state ( ts ) at the edges of the bl .",
    "recently , it was experimentally shown that an epitaxial bl can be grown on the 3d tis bi@xmath0te@xmath1  @xcite and bi@xmath0se@xmath1  @xcite .",
    "scanning tunneling spectroscopy ( sts ) showed indications for the survival of the 1d ts at the edges of bl islands grown on te terminated surfaces of binary  @xcite and ternary @xcite bi - chalcogenides .",
    "however , the edge state s energetic position is still controversial  @xcite , partly because the band structure is complicated by the complex coexistence of the 1d bi bl edge state and the 2d ts of the hybrid bi bl - substrate system  @xcite .    here",
    ", we experimentally investigate the band structure and scattering of the electron system of a bi bl grown on bi@xmath0se@xmath1  by observation of the quasi - particle interference ( qpi )  @xcite via fourier - transform sts ( ft - sts )  @xcite .",
    "the ft - sts images are interpreted with the help of the joint - density of states ( jdos ) approach , which has been used successfully to help the interpretation of ft - sts images for high temperature superconductors @xcite , quantum - hall electron phases in semiconductors  @xcite , and , more recently , in the field of tis  @xcite .",
    "the jdos method is usually applied with a spectral function @xmath2 determined from angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) .",
    "deducing @xmath3 from arpes presents three major inconveniences : ( i ) a limitation to the occupied states .",
    "( ii ) very high quality arpes data , which is needed in order to disentangle the spectral features , is often hindered by the challenge of obtaining a high quality crystal surface over micro meter distances .",
    "( iii ) in systems with multiple bands in a small energy and momentum range , the interpretation of arpes data can be problematic due to matrix element effects . instead , here",
    ", a semi - theoretical approach is developed , determining @xmath3 from a density functional theory ( dft ) calculation of the band structure as input for the jdos simulation , where the structural parameters have been optimized in order to fit the arpes - measured band structure .",
    "the jdos approach , in comparison to the more rigorous stationary phase approach  @xcite or transfer matrix method  @xcite , bears sufficient simplicity in order to easily investigate the effects of different spin - dependent scattering matrices @xmath4 on the simulated qpi patterns . on the other hand ,",
    "the `` on - shell '' assumption used in the jdos approach has been shown to be a sufficiently accurate simplification by comparison between jdos and transfer matrix results for high - temperature superconductors  @xcite .",
    "the first objective of this paper is to demonstrate that the spin - dependent jdos method using the dft - calculated surface - localized spectral function applied here , can serve to interpret the complex ft - sts measured qpi patterns of bi bl on bi@xmath0se@xmath1 , involving up to three scattering vectors at a given energy .",
    "the second objective is the experimental investigation of the band structure and electron scattering in this ti .",
    "it is shown that the 2d ts of this system coexists over a large energy range with rashba spin - split quantum well states in the conduction band ( cb ) and valence band ( vb ) of the substrate .",
    "the band gap of the bi bl which hosts the 1d edge state is relocated several hundred mev above the fermi level by charge transfer , and thus may be accessible to transport experiments only after further surface doping of the bl .",
    "scanning tunneling microcopy ( stm ) and spectroscopy ( sts ) experiments were performed in a multi - chamber ultrahigh - vacuum ( uhv ) system with a base pressure below @xmath5 using a home - built variable temperature stm similar to the one described in ref . [ ] . both the tip , electrochemically etched from polycrystalline w wire , and sample were cooled by a continuous flow he cryostat to @xmath6 .",
    "constant current stm images were taken in constant current mode at a tunneling current @xmath7 with the bias voltage @xmath8 applied to the sample .",
    "maps of the differential conductance @xmath9 , called sts images in the following , were measured with closed feedback in constant current mode via lock - in technique with a small modulation voltage @xmath10 added to @xmath8 .",
    "such maps are closely related to the local electron density of states ( ldos ) of the surface at an energy @xmath11 with respect to the fermi energy @xmath12 .",

    "the growth temperature was optimized for a smooth growth of a closed ( 111 ) bl .",
    "the coverage of bi was calibrated using stm images of well - known ( 111 ) bl islands on bi@xmath0te@xmath1  @xcite and is given in fractions of a ( 111 ) bl in the following . for the arpes measurements",
    ", the samples were annealed after the growth at @xmath20 for 10 min in order to increase the size of the bl islands in these samples .",

    "compared to the height of the bi bl grown on si(111 ) of only @xmath27  @xcite which fits with the bulk bi lattice constant along the trigonal c axis , this indicates a large van der waals gap between the bl and the bi@xmath0se@xmath1 substrate of roughly @xmath28 .",
    "there are only few defects at the surface of the bl which appear as atomic size depressions [ see inset of fig .  [",

    ", there are qpi patterns centered mostly around the surface defects , which result from the scattering of the electrons at these defects . the dispersion of the qpi patterns visible in the sts images taken as a function of bias voltage @xmath8 ( b - i ) shows a complex behaviour indicating the contribution of more than one electron band .",
    "in addition to the rather weak @xmath9 corrugation due to qpi , there is a rather strong long range contrast which inverts between @xmath30 and @xmath31 , and again between @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "this contrast reveals potential disorder on a length scale of @xmath34 which is probably caused by donor- or acceptor like subsurface defects  @xcite .        in order to deduce the origin of the electrons contributing to the qpi , the 2d fast fourier - transformations of the sts images in fig .",

    "the following commonly used  @xcite image processing steps have been done , in order to reduce the noise in the ft - sts images : first , the sts images have been smoothened by using a median filter with 5 pixel averaging along the slow scan direction .",
    "second , in order to suppress effects due to the infinitely sharp edges of the sts image on the ft , the images have been processed using a window filter with a smooth transition to zero intensity at the rim on a length of about @xmath43 .",
    "third , the calculated ft - sts image is symmetrized accoring to the pseudo sixfold symmetry of the underlying bandstructure .",
    "finally , the ft - sts images have been smoothened using a gaussian filter .",
    "the ft - sts images resulting from the sts images in fig .  [ fig : figure2 ]  ( b - i ) are shown in ( j - q ) . upon the first inspection",
    ", there are two dominant features : below the fermi energy @xmath44 the ft - sts signal has a hexagonal rim with the flat side along @xmath45-@xmath46 , which disperses to smaller @xmath47 values for increasing energy . above @xmath44 , the hexagon gets increasingly warped and finally transforms into a star - like shape with the six arms along @xmath45-@xmath46 . upon further inspection , there are additional features of smaller size inside the outer hexagon and star , which also disperse as a function of energy , indicating the contribution of two to three bands to the observed qpi throughout the energy window .",
    "we took particular care , that these features we analyzed in the following , were not artificially introduced by the image processing steps described above , but are already visible in the raw 2d fast fourier - transformations of the raw sts images .",
    "moreover , we observed the same energetic evolution of ft - sts features on five sample areas from different cleaves .",

    "a similar charge transfer effect was already proposed for the bi bl grown on bi@xmath0te@xmath1  and was attributed to the difference in work function between the film and the substrate  @xcite . consequently , there is a strong electric field in the first layers of the substrate leading to a downwards band - bending induced quantum well hosting a two - dimensional electron system ( 2des ) of the bi@xmath0se@xmath1  cb in light blue and vb in dark blue , which reveal a similar shape as the respective bands observed for bi@xmath0se@xmath1  covered with dilute amounts of adsorbates  @xcite .",

    "in contrast , the edge state is expected to be positioned in the original band gap between vb and cb of the bl at about @xmath73 above @xmath44 .        in order to take into account the spin texture of the rashba - split bands and of the ts , the spin - dependence of the matrix elements @xmath4 is considered to lowest approximation ,",

    "the average value of the cross correlation between the experimental ft - sts and the simulated jdos images defined by @xmath96}{\\sqrt{\\sum\\limits_{i , j}(i_{\\mathrm{exp}}(i , j)-<i_{\\mathrm{exp}}>)^2}\\cdot\\sqrt{\\sum\\limits_{i , j}(i_{\\mathrm{sim}}(i , j)-<i_{\\mathrm{sim}}>)^2}}\\ ] ] where @xmath7 are the intensities at point @xmath97 of the images and @xmath98 denote their mean intensity values , amounts to 80% , with a variation of @xmath99% across the whole investigated energy range .",
    "figure  [ fig : figure5 ] nicely illustrates , that the intraband scattering inside the ts is strongly suppressed by time reversal symmetry due to its peculiar spin texture over a large energy range .",
    "nevertheless , _ interband _ scattering between the ts and the bi bl band is allowed .",
    "the approximate linearity of @xmath94 , @xmath100 , and @xmath95 , taking into account the inversion symmetry of the band structure with respect to @xmath45 , experimentally proves the presence and linear dispersion of the ts .",
    "this holds even in the energy range where the ts is almost degenerate with the substrate vb .",
    "this extraordinary property of the particular ts in bi bl / bi@xmath0se@xmath1  is caused by its localization in the bi bl which suppresses hybridization with bulk vb states in contrast to other 3d tis .",
    "however , the observed interband scattering from the ts into the bi bl vb excludes the possibility of using this ts for carrying dissipationless spin currents on the surface .",
    "on the other hand , there are obvious discrepancies between the ft - sts and jdos images shown in fig .",

    "[ fig : figure4 ]  ( d , e , i , j , n , o ) ] , in the ft - sts images might be explained by the sensitivity of sts to the vacuum density of states whereas , the jdos approach considers the density of states _ in _ the surface . the vacuum density of states is dominated by states with small @xmath40 , damping qpi patterns involving large @xmath36 . by switching off the @xmath81 scattering channel in the jdos simulations a very good agreement with the ft - sts image is found .",
    "another explanation for the missing bi@xmath0se@xmath1  cb intraband scattering vectors is spin selection , which may be oversimplified in the jdos approach , in particular for the strongly anisotropic cb where the constraint to in - plane components of the spin breaks down .",
    "the inclusion of a more rigorous treatment of the electron spin in the matrix elements is beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "the experimentally determined band structure substantiates that the original band gap of the bi bl is moved up to @xmath101 above @xmath44 .",
    "this doping effect comes about by the charge transfer from the bl to the substrate , which is also responsible for the rashba spin - split substrate cb 2des states visible in the band structure of fig .",
    "[ fig : figure5 ]  ( b ) .",
    "the strong rashba splitting has been recently observed for bi bl grown on a single quintuple layer of bi@xmath0se@xmath1(or bi@xmath0te@xmath1 )  @xcite , although , there , it does not coexist with a ts .",
    "it remains to be experimentally studied , whether the energetic position of the topological edge state of the bl is in the bl band gap , as predicted theoretically  @xcite , and thus not accessible to transport experiments .",
    "in this case , it might be possible to shift the edge state to @xmath44 by surface doping using decoration of the bl with alkali adatoms  @xcite .",
    "finally , our paper illustrates a methodology for the analysis of ft - sts images by dft - based spin - dependent jdos simulations enabling to pin point the origin of very complex qpi interference patterns which stem from the electrons in several energetically degenerate bands .",
