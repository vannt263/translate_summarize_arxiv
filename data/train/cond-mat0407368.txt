    "several recent studies have produced a variety of models that exhibit quantum number fractionalization in two dimensions and in the absence of magnetic fields.@xcite it has been appreciated for some time that similar fractionalization phenomenon can occur also in three dimensions , and can take novel forms not possible in 2d.@xcite in particular , so called coulomb phases have recently been demonstrated in 3d bosonic models . in these coulomb phases",
    "the fractionalized degrees of freedom interact with a gapless emergent @xmath1 gauge field .",
    "the gauge excitations describe , at low energies and long distances , a linear dispersing transverse mode which has been dubbed an ` artificial photon ' .",
    "the adjective ` artificial ' refers to the fact that this photon really corresponds to some collective excitation of the boson system and has nothing directly to do with the true electromagnetic photon .",
    "in particular the ` artificial photon ' in the fractionalized 3d coulomb phases arises even in microscopic models of correlated bosons with purely short - ranged interactions .",
    "the coulomb phase also contains additional gapped excitations that may be identified with magnetic monopoles of the internal gauge field .",
    "the possibility of such dynamical generation of ` light ' was noted more than two decades ago in ref .  .",
    "in the case of fractionalization in 2d bosonic systems , a very fruitful perspective is obtained by departing from a superfluid state and considering nearby mott insulator phases as vortex condensates.@xcite conventional insulating states of bosons , with possibly charge or bond order , can be understood in these terms . the same perspective also naturally predicts occurrence of a @xmath2 fractionalized state when the superfluidity is destroyed by the condensation of doubled vortices while single ones remain gapped .",
    "the unpaired single vortex survives in the resulting insulating phase as a gapped excitation that retains a @xmath2 quantum number ( only the oddity of vorticity remains well defined )  this is the @xmath2 vortex or vison excitation of this fractionalized insulator .    turning to 3d systems ,",
    "we envisage a similar perspective on insulating states as vortex condensates , except that vortex excitations in the superfluid are now lines instead of point particles . for example , a @xmath2 fractionalized insulator is obtained by destroying the superfluid order by pairing and condensing vortex lines .",
    "the goal of the present paper is to develop a similar intuition for the 3d coulomb phase ( also dubbed @xmath1 phase ) . in particular , we want to understand the genesis of the excitation structure of this phase in an approach that departs from the superfluid state .",
    "we note that the excitation structure of the coulomb phase consists of gapped charge-@xmath0 chargons that are minimally coupled to an emergent gapless `` photon '' mode .",
    "in addition , there is another gapped excitation that may be viewed as a `` magnetic monopole '' that acts as a source of the emergent magnetic flux .",
    "the picture that appears from the present study is that physics inside vortex cores is intimately involved in producing the @xmath1 phase .",
    "we thus have a rather unusual but very interesting situation when we can not ignore the microscopics of the vortex core when describing the relationship of the superfluid phase to the nearby insulating states .",
    "the main idea is very simply illustrated by considering bosons on a three - dimensional cubic lattice and at an average filling of one half boson per site . in some semiclassical description ,",
    "there are two simple phases that might be imagined for the bosons .",
    "first , there is a translationally invariant superfluid phase .",
    "second , there is a mott insulator in which the bosons preferentially occupy sites on one or the other of the two sublattices .",
    "clearly , such a mott insulating ground state is two - fold degenerate corresponding to the two possible states of boson charge ordering .",
    "the superfluid phase possesses vortices which are extended line defects .",
    "the superfluid order parameter will be suppressed in the core of such a vortex line . if the vortex core size is larger than the lattice spacing ( as might well happen )",
    "it makes sense to ask about what ` phase ' is obtained in the core .",
    "an immediate guess is that the core is simply the checkerboard charge - ordered mott insulating state as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : cdw ] . however the checkerboard state breaks a symmetry ( that of sublattice interchange ) , and is two - fold degenerate .",
    "we are then led to conclude that there will be two kinds of vortices depending on which sublattice has higher boson density in the core .",
    "this simple - minded discussion on the structure of vortices will be modified once we take quantum fluctuations into account more seriously in the vortex core .",
    "in particular , as the core has finite radius , it essentially behaves as a one dimensional system .",
    "quantum fluctuations will tend to restore the broken symmetry in the core and produce a unique vortex line .",
    "however , as the broken sublattice symmetry is discrete , it is natural to expect that the symmetry breaking will be stable to weak quantum fluctuations .",
    "thus there will be some range of parameters in which there will be two distinct kinds of vortex lines with symmetry broken cores .",
    "in other range of parameters a unique vortex with no symmetry breaking in the core may well result .",
    "the change between the two parameter ranges involves no ground state phase transition but only a change in the nature of the excited states .",
    "now consider disordering the superfluid by proliferating and condensing vortex line loops .",
    "clearly , the insulating phase that obtains will depend on the structure of the vortices that are actually proliferating .",
    "consider the situation where the vortices have ordered cores . if we preferentially condense one or the other kind of vortex , we will clearly induce checkerboard charge order in the insulator .",
    "but what if we condense both species of vortices with equal amplitude ?",
    "we argue that the resulting phase is the coulomb fractionalized insulator .",
    "we show how the excitations of this exotic insulator may be understood in terms of the various excitations of the superfluid when it has ordered vortex cores .",
    "consider a vortex line .",
    "it is still possible for the core order to change from one state to the other somewhere along the line as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mnpl_roton ] , but there is a gap for such a domain wall excitation .",
    "we expect this gap to remain when such vortices proliferate while retaining their order .",
    "when both vortex species proliferate , the domain wall excitations become point particles which we identify with the monopoles of the coulomb phase .",
    "the appearance of the artificial photon is more subtle , but is also a consequence of proliferating two species of vortices . to explain this , it is useful to recall what happens in the more familiar situation of particle condensates .",
    "when the particle that is condensing is ` neutral ' ( in the sense of having only short ranged interactions ) , the resulting condensate supports gapless goldstone excitations . on the other hand ,",
    "if it is charged ( in the sense of having long ranged interactions ) , there are no gapless excitations associated with the condensation ( the anderson - higgs phenomenon ) .",
    "consider now the dual description of bosonic mott insulators in three spatial dimensions as ` condensates ' of extended vortex loops .",
    "for such a line condensate we may again expect that if the vortices have long ranged interactions then the resulting condensate supports only gapped excitations .",
    "however , consider now the situation envisaged above where there are two vortex species ( distinguished by the ordering in the core ) which both condense .",
    "we may form a ` roton ' line from these two species by bringing together a vortex with one ordered core and an antivortex with the other core , and this is pictured in fig .",
    "[ fig : mnpl_roton ] . such objects have no net vorticity , and therefore only short ranged interactions with one another .",
    "when both vortex species condense such roton loops condense as well . by analogy to particle condensates we may expect then to find gapless excitations",
    ". we will show in this paper that this is indeed the case , and that the resulting gapless modes may be identified with the photon of the coulomb phase .",
    "more precisely , we will argue that the roton lines described above may be viewed as the magnetic field lines of the emergent deconfined @xmath1 gauge field that obtains in the coulomb phase .",

    "it is useful to point a connection with a recent study@xcite of so called deconfined critical points in two dimensions such as separating a superfluid and a bond density wave insulator of bosons at half - filling on a square lattice . in 2d , a vortex is a point particle , and because of the quantum tunneling events we expect a unique physical vortex in the superfluid phase . in other words ,",
    "generically the two different ordering patterns in the core will tunnel into each other at a finite rate in @xmath4 .",
    "however , at the critical point at which vortices proliferate , the tunneling becomes irrelevant.@xcite we may then effectively speak of two vortex species .",
    "the tunneling becomes again relevant in the vortex condensate , and produces a particular insulating state which in this example has bond density wave order .",
    "however , as elaborated in ref .",
    "there is a large intermediate region of length scales in the insulator ( close to the critical point ) which may be described as a two - dimensional version of the coulomb phase .",
    "the ( intermediate ) long wavelength physics of this region is again described in terms of a gapless excitation which may be regarded as the two - dimensional version of the photon . in three dimensions , having an ordered vortex core is a stable possibility in the superfluid . as mentioned in the previous paragraph",
    ", proliferating both vortex species with equal amplitude then leads to a stable insulating phase which has a gapless photon excitation  precisely the coulomb state at the focus of the present study .",
    "the primary purpose of this paper is to develop the physical picture sketched above for the excitations of the coulomb phase in some detail .",
    "this goal is strongly aided by a formal dual description of three - dimensional bosonic systems in terms of extended fluctuating vortex loops .",
    "this duality transformation  a generalization to ( 3 + 1)d of the familiar boson - vortex duality in two spatial dimensions  has been available in the literature for many years , and is reviewed in section  [ sec : dual ] . here",
    "we will use this and further develop it extensively to obtain a dual description of the phases of various three - dimensional bosonic systems which puts meat into the physical pictures .",
    "in the course of these studies , we develop a description of bosons at half - filling on a three - dimensional cubic lattice that is capable of describing all the insulating phases discussed above  the coulomb phase , the checkerboard charge ordered phase , and also different bond density wave ordered phases .",
    "this gives a three - dimensional generalization of the corresponding development in ref .  .",
    "boson systems at half - filling are closely related to spin-@xmath0 quantum magnets .",
    "thus some of our results have direct implications for quantum spin systems on cubic lattices as well .",
    "indeed we will borrow from techniques familiar from studies of quantum antiferromagnets in two spatial dimensions , and generalize them in discussing the structure of the bond ordered insulating phases of bosons at half - filling    the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec",

    "this provides a good starting point for the discussion of the relationship of the @xmath1 state to other phases .",

    "precise duality analysis is presented in section  [ sec : dual ] , where we first review the conventional boson - vortex duality in ( 3 + 1)d from a modern perspective , and then describe how to include the physics of two vortex species in the dual description ( the details of the derivation are given in appendix  [ app:2ch ] ) . in appendix",

    "much further insight is obtained when we consider vortices in the superfluid phase from the point of view of the phenomenological theory .    a precise topological characterization of the coulomb phase is provided by the existence of the gapped monopole excitation .",

    "the domain walls will then proliferate inside the core leading to the destruction of the vortex core order so that there will then be a unique vortex for any given physical vorticity .",

    "consider now what happens when we have two domain wall band minima inside the vortex core in the superfluid phase , and the domain wall gap goes to zero .",
    "one possibility motivated by our analysis in the next section is that domain wall proliferation leads to a vbs order inside the core . in this case , while the fields @xmath156 and @xmath157 are locked , there can be several degenerate ways for this to happen corresponding to the number of favorable vbs states inside the core ( we need to be even more careful here since e.g. for the columnar order the favorable states likely depend on the vortex line orientation ) .",
    "this would mean that our choice of the basic fields @xmath156 and @xmath157 is not a very good one , and the analysis needs to be reconsidered , perhaps introducing different vortex fields . when a single such vortex condenses , the corresponding vbs state results , but it may be also possible to condense several such vortices simultaneously possibly leading to new exotic states .",
    "even more exotic possibility is for the domain walls to become critical inside the core , which might occur due to the one - dimensionality of the setting.@xcite in the present work , we have only touched upon these possibilities and have not pursued any systematic studies .",
