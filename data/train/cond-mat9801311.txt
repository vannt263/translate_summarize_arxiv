    "the recent discovery of colossal magnetoresistance ( cmr)@xcite in mixed - valence compounds of the form @xmath0 , ( where @xmath1 can be ca , sr or ba ) has revived the interest in these materials with perovskite structure .",
    "the interest is focused on the phase diagram and the magneto - transport properties .",
    "both features have been determined experimentally@xcite . for @xmath2 and low temperatures",
    "the system is metallic and presents ferromagnetic order . as the temperature increases the system becomes insulator and paramagnetic .",
    "the ferro - paramagnetic transition occurs at an @xmath3 dependent critical temperature @xmath4 .",
    "the colossal magnetoresistance effects are observed for temperatures close to @xmath5 . for @xmath6 and low temperatures",
    "the system is a layer antiferromagnetic with ferromagnetic coupling inside planes .    in these compounds",
    "the electronically active orbitals are the @xmath7 @xmath8 orbitals .",
    "the number of @xmath8 electrons per @xmath7 is @xmath9 , namely , four electrons per @xmath10 and three per @xmath11 . the cubic symmetry and the strong hund s rule coupling make that three electrons get trapped in the @xmath12 states and therefore these electrons become electrically inert , forming a core spin @xmath13 of magnitude @xmath14 .",
    "the rest of the electrons go to the @xmath15 orbitals and they get strongly coupled to @xmath13 by the hund s rule coupling .",
    "consequently , all the spins on each @xmath7 prefer to be parallel . for small values of @xmath3 ,",
    "the perovskites show a long range jahn - teller order which selects a preferred @xmath8 orbital and therefore it is possible to assume that the electrons move only through one @xmath8 orbital .",
    "the double exchange ( de ) mechanism developed by zener @xcite , explains the existence of ferromagnetism and metallic behavior at low temperatures . in this model ,",
    "the electrons get mobility between the manganese ions using oxygen , which is magnetically inert , as an intermediate . as a consequence",
    ", the tunneling takes place between two configurations in which the @xmath7 ions of different charge ( @xmath16 and @xmath17 ) interchange their valence states .",
    "this conduction process is proportional to the electron transfer integral @xmath18 if the core spins of @xmath16 and @xmath17 are aligned .",
    "otherwise , the transfer integral is inversely proportional to the hund s rule coupling energy , which for the @xmath7 ions is much larger than @xmath18 . in the de model",
    "the ferromagnetism is then induced via this electron conduction process .    in the limit of large hund s coupling the spin of",
    "the electron in the active @xmath8 orbital is parallel to the local core spin @xmath19 , which is treated as a classical rotator with the normalization @xmath20 and characterized by the angles @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "then , semiclassically , the effective hopping hamiltonian is    @xmath23    here @xmath24 creates an electron at site @xmath25 with spin parallel to @xmath19 , @xmath26 denotes the nearest - neighbor pairs , which are only counted once , and the hopping amplitude acquires a berry s phase and it becomes a complex number given by@xcite , @xmath27 this complex hopping appears after rotating the conduction electron spins so that the spin quantization axis at site @xmath25 is parallel to @xmath19 , and then project onto the spin parallel to @xmath28 . in this paper",
    "we will call complex de ( cde ) model the system governed by the hamiltonian ( [ hcomplex ] ) with the hopping given by ( [ tcomplex ] ) .    for topologies where electrons close paths do not occur , it is possible to choose wave functions phase factors such that    @xmath29    being @xmath30 the angle between the semiclassical spins @xmath19 and @xmath28 .    in this work",
    "we will use the name de model for the system controlled by equation ( [ hcomplex ] ) with the hopping ( [ treal ] ) .",
    "this is the hamiltonian proposed by anderson and hasegawa@xcite as a generalization of the hamiltonian describing the tunneling between two fixed sites @xmath25 and @xmath31 .",
    "de gennes@xcite and kubo and ohata@xcite calculated , in a mean field theory approximation , the magnetic phase diagram of the de model .",
    "their results show a ferro - paramagnetic phase transition at a critical temperature @xmath32 this transition is accompanied by a change in the temperature dependence of the resistivity . in equation ( [ tmf ] )",
    ", @xmath33 means the expectation value of the operator @xmath34 at zero temperature .    however , recently it has been pointed out@xcite that the critical temperatures predicted by the mean field theory of the de model is much bigger than the observed experimentally .",
    "furthermore , the resistivity implied by the hopping ( [ treal ] ) is incompatible with many aspects of the experimental information .",
    "et al_@xcite proposed that in addition to the de mechanism a strong electron - phonon interaction plays a crucial role in these perovskites .",
    "the interplay between these two effects could reproduce the experimental critical temperature and the observed behavior of the resistivity at the magnetic transition temperature@xcite .    on the other hand , yunoki _",
    "et al_@xcite claim that the inclusion of the phase in the hopping term can lower the critical temperature down to the experimental values .",
    "also , for large but finite hund s coupling , they obtain that at low concentrations phase separation between hole - poor antiferromagnetic and hole - rich ferromagnetic regions occurs .",
    "the existence of phase separation is also obtained by solving the de model plus an antiferromagnetic coupling between next neighbors core spins@xcite .    in this paper",
    "we are interested in two points ; first , in comparing the magnetic phase diagram of the two de models , equations ( [ tcomplex ] ) and ( [ treal ] ) , and second , in obtaining an approximated expression for the de energy which allows us to perform monte carlo calculations in bigger unit cells and to obtain accurate values of the magnetic critical temperature . the main results of our calculations are shown in fig.[tc ] . here",
    "we show the critical temperature versus concentration , for the complex de model and for the real de model , in the case of a unit cell of size @xmath35 .",
    "we obtain that there is not big difference between the critical temperatures of both models .",
    "this result indicates that the contribution to the partition function of electronic configurations in which fermions move on closed loops in real space can be neglected . in fig.[tc ] we also show monte carlo results obtained by using an approximated expression for the electron kinetic energy .",
    "we have checked in small systems that this approximation is realistic . from our results",
    "we obtain that the critical temperature of the de model is in the range of the experimental one@xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section ii we describe briefly the monte carlo algorithm we use and in section iii we present the results obtained for the cde and de hamiltonians . in section",
    "iv we introduce an approximation to the de energy which allows us to perform monte carlo simulations in bigger systems .",
    "section v is devoted to show the results obtained in the frame of this approximation .",
    "finally , we present the conclusions in section vi .",
    "for calculating the magnetic phase diagrams , we have performed classical monte carlo ( mc ) simulations on the classical core spin angles .",
    "the simulations are done in @xmath36 cubic lattices with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "although the localized spins are considered classical , the kinetic energy of the conduction electrons is calculated by diagonalizing the de hamiltonian because we consider it as a quantum quantity .",
    "the standard metropolis algorithm@xcite was used in the mc simulations .",
    "the sites to be considered for a change in the spin orientation are randomly chosen .",
    "once a site is selected for a spin reorientation , the angle associated with an attempted change of the spin is chosen at random from within a specified range@xcite .",
    "then the energy change , @xmath37 , associated with the attempted update , is calculated .",
    "if the quantity @xmath38 is smaller than a random number between @xmath39 and @xmath40 , the change is allowed , otherwise , it is rejected .",
    "typically , 5000 - 7000 mc steps per spin are used for equilibration and 3000 - 5000 steps for spin are used for calculating averages .    in the simulations we calculate the average of the internal energy , @xmath41 , and the average of the absolute value of the magnetization , @xmath42 , @xmath43 @xmath44 where @xmath45 denotes statistical average .",
    "since the mc updating procedure generates uniform rotations of the spin system , a calculation of the mc average of the direction of the magnetization is not meaningful .",
    "also we calculate the average value of the width of the density of states , @xmath46 , and the value of the chemical potential , @xmath47 , measured with respect to the bottom of the density of states , @xmath48 where @xmath49 and @xmath50 are the minimum and the maximum energies obtained from diagonalizing the electron hamiltonian , and @xmath51 is the higher energy of the occupied states .",
    "in order to obtain the internal energy in each of the monte carlo steps , it is necessary to diagonalize the electronic hamiltonian .",
    "the diagonalization is very expensive in terms of cpu time , and therefore we can only study small size systems . here",
    "we present the results obtained for a cubic unit cell of size @xmath52 and for the electron concentrations @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 .    in figure",
    "[ de - cde ] , it is presented , for the de and the cde hamiltonians , the magnetization , @xmath42 , as a function of the temperature , @xmath56 . due to the finite size of the unit cells used in the simulations",
    ", @xmath42 is different from zero at any temperature , and we define the critical temperature , @xmath57 , as the point where the second derivative of @xmath42 with respect @xmath56 changes sign .",
    "this way of obtaining the critical temperatures , implies uncertainties of around @xmath58 of the value of @xmath57 . in any case",
    "we obtain that the critical temperatures of the de and the cde hamiltonians are practically the same . in figure [ e - t ]",
    "we plot the internal energy @xmath41 as a function of @xmath56 .",
    "note that the difference between the internal energies obtained by using the cde and using the de hamiltonians is rather small .",
    "that is the reason why both models give very similar magnetic critical temperatures .",
    "these results imply that in order to calculate total kinetic energies the close paths are almost irrelevant .    in figure [ w - mu - t ]",
    "we plot , as a function of the temperature , the width of the density of states @xmath46 and the chemical potential @xmath47 , for the de case .",
    "note that at temperatures close to @xmath57 , the bandwidth and the chemical potential have a value bigger than the obtained in the fully disordered case , @xmath59 .",
    "this is because in the de models the ferromagnetic to paramagnetic transition is a second order phase transition , and therefore the internal energy is continuous at the critical temperature .",
    "moreover , the bandwidth and the chemical potential present a continuous behavior near @xmath57 . in the de models",
    "we do not observe any change in the electronic states at the ferro - paramagnetic critical temperature .",
    "in the mc calculations of the de models , the size of the matrix to diagonalize impose a restriction on the dimension of the unit cell used in the simulation . in order to be able to perform simulations in bigger systems ,",
    "we have developed a second order perturbation theory for obtaining an expression for the electron kinetic energy in a background of randomly oriented core spins .",
    "we start writing the hamiltonian ( [ hcomplex ] ) in the form , @xmath60 with    @xmath61    being @xmath62 the average of the absolute value of the hopping amplitude , @xmath63 and @xmath64 here @xmath65 is the total number of @xmath7 ions in the system . note that since the hamiltonian is hermitic , @xmath62 is a real quantity .",
    "given a disordered system , characterized by a set of @xmath66 , we want to obtain the expectation value of @xmath67 .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath68 can be diagonalized by using the bloch states , @xmath69 where @xmath70 represents the atomic orbital at site @xmath25 , @xmath71 are the lattice vectors and @xmath72 is a wave vector in the first brillouin zone .",
    "the energy of the state @xmath73 is @xmath74 being @xmath75 the lattice parameter . in function of these eigenvalues ,",
    "the expectation value of @xmath68 is , @xmath76 where the sum is over the occupied states . from the value of @xmath77",
    "we can obtain the expectation value of @xmath78 , @xmath79 which is independent of the value of @xmath80 .    to obtain the expectation value of @xmath81",
    ", we first notice that since the set @xmath82 are randomly distributed , @xmath83 , and it is necessary second order perturbation theory in order to get a correction to the expectation value of @xmath68 , @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the green function of the perfect crystal .",
    "because the values @xmath82 are not correlated , it is easy to obtain the expression , @xmath86 with @xmath87    adding @xmath77 and @xmath88 , we obtain the following expression for the energy of the system , @xmath89    in figure [ coef ] we plot @xmath90 and @xmath91 as a function of the electron density @xmath3 . the first term in the above expression is a ferromagnetic coupling for the core spins and the second term is an antiferromagnetic coupling .",
    "note that @xmath90 is only linear on @xmath3 at small values of the electron concentration .",
    "in figure [ de - cde ] we plot , for @xmath53 , @xmath92 and @xmath93 , the absolute value of the magnetization , @xmath42 , as a function of the temperature , @xmath56 , for the case where the internal energy is obtained by using the approximated de energy , equation ( [ energy - approx ] ) , for comparing with the case in which it is obtained by diagonalizing the de hamiltonian . the difference between both curves",
    "is very small , and the corresponding critical temperatures are practically the same , see figure [ tc ] .",
    "therefore we conclude that equation ( [ energy - approx ] ) is a good approximation for the energy of the de model .",
    "using equation ( [ energy - approx ] ) , for the de energy , we can perform mc simulations in much bigger systems , and obtain more precise values of the critical temperatures . in figure [ n=20 ]",
    "we plot the magnetization as a function of the temperature for a sample of size @xmath94 . for this size",
    "the critical temperature is obtained with a big precision .",
    "we have checked that for @xmath94 the values of the critical temperatures are accurate in two digits and that it is not worthwhile to increase more the size of the system .",
    "we have performed mc simulations for different values of the electron concentration and , in figure [ tc ] , we have plotted the magnetic phase diagram .",
    "kubo and ohata@xcite have developed an expression for the de energy which coincides with @xmath77 . in order to know the importance of @xmath88 in the calculation of the value of the critical temperature , we have also computed the value of @xmath42 as a function of @xmath56 by using only @xmath77 for the internal energy , see figure [ n=20 ] . comparing these results with the ones obtained with the approximated de energy , @xmath95 , we estimate that the inclusion of @xmath88 in the internal energy lowers the critical temperature more than a 20@xmath96 .    in fig.[tprome ] , we plot for different values of the concentration @xmath3 , the statistical average of the absolute value of the hopping amplitude , @xmath97 , as a function of the temperature .",
    "this quantity is proportional to the electron bandwidth .",
    "we find that @xmath98 is a continuous function of @xmath56 , and there are not signals of any change in the electronic structure near @xmath57 .",
    "the bandwidth near @xmath57 is around 1.15 times bigger than the bandwidth in the @xmath59 limit .",
    "et al_@xcite have obtained that in the @xmath59 limit of the cde model , only @xmath99 of the electron states are localized . in order to know the difference between the density of states at @xmath100 and at @xmath59 , we have calculated the statistical average of the electron density of states .",
    "we find that the number of electron states with energies between @xmath101 and @xmath102 is less than @xmath103 of the total number of states .",
    "therefore , even if all these states were localized , the percentage of localized states near @xmath57 is not larger than @xmath104 .",
    "we conclude that in the de models it is not possible to relate the metal - insulator transition with the ferro - paramagnetic one .",
    "the critical temperatures we obtain are around 1.5 times smaller than the obtained in mean field theory by kubo and ohata@xcite .",
    "however , it is around 8 times smaller than the obtained by millis _",
    "et al._@xcite using also a mean field approximation .",
    "we think that the difference occurs because they use a lineal dependence , see fig .",
    "[ coef ] , of the kinetic electron energy which overestimate the value of @xmath105 , and therefore the value of @xmath57 .    from kubo and ohata model ( [ tmf ] ) ,",
    "it is clear that @xmath57 scales with @xmath106 and the magnetization versus @xmath107 curve is independent of the electron concentration x. but there is no reason to think that this must be the case when the second term , @xmath88 , of our approach is included in the calculations .",
    "however , we have found that the @xmath42 versus @xmath107 curves almost coincide ( see fig.[n=20 ] ) .",
    "this fact is not only found in the frame of our approximation to the de energy but also when the de and cde hamiltonians are diagonalized .",
    "the presented results are in qualitatively agreement with those obtained by dagotto _",
    "et al_@xcite .",
    "however our estimations of @xmath57 are @xmath108 times bigger .",
    "the discrepancy is due to the difference in the criterion used to obtain @xmath57 . in reference @xcite the @xmath57 is defined as the temperature where the spin - spin correlation function in real space becomes zero at the maximum distance available in the unit cell .",
    "they used a unit cell of size @xmath109 .",
    "our criterium is based in the change of sign of the second derivative of @xmath42 with respect to @xmath56 .",
    "we have checked that both criteria give the same @xmath57 in big unit cells , but the criterium based on the correlation function underestimate @xmath57 in small unit cell calculations .",
    "this is clear in fig.[correlation ] where we plot the spin - spin correlation function versus distance for several temperatures and for two unit cells with @xmath110 and @xmath111 .",
    "the electron concentration is @xmath112 to compare with the results presented in reference @xcite . in the case of @xmath110",
    "it seems that the critical temperature is smaller than @xmath113 , because the correlation function is zero at a separation of 8@xmath75 .",
    "however , when @xmath111 it is clear that the ferromagnetic correlation at @xmath113 is not zero at 8@xmath75 , and in fact it seems that at this temperature the system is still ferromagnetic . on the other hand ,",
    "our criterium overestimate the @xmath57 for small unit cells and the possibility of increasing the size leads to more realistic values of the critical temperature .    to compare with the experimental critical temperatures ,",
    "it is necessary an estimation of @xmath114 .",
    "the experimental bandwidth is around 1 - 4ev@xcite , and therefore the value of @xmath114 is around 0.08 - 0.3ev . with this result",
    "our estimate of the critical temperature is between 150k and 500k at @xmath115 .",
    "this value of @xmath57 is in the range of the observed experimentally .",
    "using monte carlo techniques , we have obtained the magnetic phase diagram of the double exchange hamiltonian . comparing the results obtained from the double exchange hamiltonian with a complex hopping ( cde ) and with its absolute value ( de ) we have found that the berry phase of the hopping has a negligible effect in the magnetic critical temperature .",
    "this implies that it is possible to choose wave functions phase factors that counteract the phase of the hopping such that it is not relevant in the mc calculations . to avoid the limitations on the size of the systems studied",
    "we have developed a second order perturbative approach to calculate the electron kinetic energy without diagonalizing the hamiltonian . within this approach",
    "we have calculated the critical temperature for a bigger size of the system ( @xmath94 ) and , consequently , more accurately .",
    "the values of @xmath57 obtained are in the range of the experimental ones and in qualitative agreement with those in ref .",
    "neither the average of the electron density of states nor the kinetic energy reveal any strange behavior near the magnetic critical temperature .",
    "we conclude that , in order to understand the metal - insulator transition which occurs in the manganites , another effects , not included in the double exchange hamiltonian , should be taken into account .    _",
