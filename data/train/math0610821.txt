    "computing networks consist of hardware devices ( hosts , routers , end terminals , etc ) , together with a collection of connections between pairs of such devices , along which packets of information are passed .",
    "this rudimentary structure is readily modeled by a graph @xmath6 where the vertex set @xmath7 represents hardware devices and the edge set @xmath8 represents direct connections between devices . if , in addition to the underlying graph structure , parameters are associated to vertices and edges , it is possible to produce a more accurate model of a given computing environment . when the parameters defining the model ( including the underlying graph ) are dynamic , network performance can be expected to vary , and network control and/or predictability become issues of serious consequence . for real world applications ,",
    "the first step in addressing such issues involves the accurate monitering of the parameters which define the network .    for networks modeled as above ,",
    "it is often the case that direct monitering of system parameters is impossible and one must rely on inference methods to produce reliable estimates for parameter values ( cf @xcite for a recent survey ) .",
    "the search for good estimates provides a rich source of challenging inverse problems ( for related work see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and references therein ) . in this paper",
    "we formulate and solve one such problem .    the problems in which we are interested involve a fixed network topology in which one designated device can send packets to a collection of endusers and monitor packet arrival at enduser positions , but can not directly observe any behavior for devices between packet origin and packet collection .",
    "we are interested in using packet arrival times to determine network parameters associated to devices which are not directly observable .",
    "thus , we are interested in a type of _ network tomography _ problem . to concisely state our results , we begin by formalizing the discussion .",

    "at each terminal vertex of @xmath12 glue on a finite linear tree with vertex set of size at least 2 ( the size of the linear chain is determined by the geometry of @xmath12 and the terminal vertex in question : see section 2 ) .",
    "call the resulting graph , denoted @xmath13 an _ augmentation of @xmath12 _ and note that @xmath12 is naturally embedded in @xmath14 note that since each terminal vertex of @xmath12 has in effect been replaced by a linear segment of length at least 2 , it is possible to identify `` two layers of boundary in @xmath14 '' more precisely , denote the outer boundary layer of @xmath15 by @xmath16 and denote the inner boundary layer of @xmath12 by @xmath17    to each internal vertex of @xmath12 associate the transition probabilities of a simple nondegenerate markov chain .",

    "the transition probabilities associated to the internal vertices of @xmath12 together with the transition probabilities associated to the vertices of @xmath15 which are not internal vertices of @xmath12 suffice to define a simple markov chain on @xmath15 ( killed upon reaching the outer boundary of @xmath15 ) .",
