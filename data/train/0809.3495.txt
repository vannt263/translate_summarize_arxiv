    "diffuse x - ray emission extending over several to tens pc has been reported in many massive star - forming regions , such as ngc 2024 @xcite , the orion nebula @xcite , the rosette nebula , @xcite , m17 @xcite , rcw 38 @xcite , ngc 6334 @xcite , the carina nebula @xcite , w49 @xcite , ngc 3603 @xcite , the arches cluster @xcite , and the quintuplet cluster @xcite .",
    "this diffuse component contributes a considerable fraction of the total x - ray emission and shows different spectral characteristics among these regions . diffuse x - ray emission can be roughly classified into three types : thin - thermal plasma emission with a temperature @xmath6 0.11 kev , higher - temperature plasma emission with @xmath6 210 kev , and possibly non - thermal emission with a photon index of 1 - 1.5 .",
    "these phenomena can be explained by plasma heating and particle acceleration in strong shocks by fast stellar winds from young ob stars @xcite and/or past supernova remnants ( snrs ) @xcite .",
    "the precise origin of diffuse x - ray emission , however , is often unclear .",
    "recently @xcite suggest that the origin of diffuse x - ray emission can be constrained by plasma diagnostics or measurements of elemental abundances .",
    "while main - sequence late - o to early b stars have nearly solar abundances ( e.g. , @xcite ) , evolved stars show non - solar elemental compositions due to the cno cycle .",
    "for instance , the plasma will be overabundant in nitrogen if its origin is the wind from a nitrogen - rich wolf - rayet star .",
    "on the other hand , the plasma will be overabundant in oxygen , neon , and silicon if it is produced by a type ii snr ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the low - temperature ( @xmath60.11 kev ) type of diffuse x - ray emission is ideal for such diagnostic studies , because a variety of k - shell lines exist in the 0.22 kev range .",
    "the carina nebula is an excellent site to investigate plasma diagnostics of diffuse x - ray emission . at a distance of 2.3 kpc ,",
    "it is one of the most active massive star forming regions in the galaxy .",
    "it contains eight massive stellar clusters : trumpler 14 , 15 , 16 , collinder 228 , bochum 10 , 11 , ngc 3293 , and ngc 3324 . in total , there exist more than 64 o stars @xcite , including the extreme - type luminous blue variable @xmath5 car and four wolf - rayet stars .",
    "the age of the nebula is estimated to be @xmath7 myr based on the most evolved stars and the size of the hii region @xcite .",
    "the young massive stars that are still enshrouded in gas and dust have been observed in optical , infrared , and radio wavelengths ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the number counts of the most massive o stars , e.g. , o3 stars , suggest that the star - formation activity of the carina nebula rivals those of the most active regions , such as ngc 3603 at @xmath8 kpc and w49 at @xmath9 kpc .",
    "the proximity of the carina nebula , compared with ngc 3603 and w49 , makes it the best target to study diffuse x - ray emission resulting from star - forming activities .",
    "seward et al .  ( 1979 ) first suggested the existence of possible diffuse soft x - ray emission in the carina nebula with a luminosity of @xmath1010@xmath11 erg s@xmath1 and a spatial extent of several pc , using einstein observations .",
    "although the limited energy and spatial resolution of einstein hindered the determination of precise plasma parameters and the contribution from point sources , @xcite postulated that the extended x - rays were from hot gas with @xmath12 k. with chandra , evans et al .",
    "( 2003 ) confirmed the existence of diffuse x - ray emission near @xmath5 car in addition to point sources ; however , the limited photon statistics and high background prevented detailed spectral analysis .",
    "hamaguchi et al .  (",
    "2007 ) obtained spectra of the diffuse x - ray emission around @xmath5 car with suzaku .",
    "owing to the good low - energy response and the low background of the x - ray ccd onboard suzaku , the spectra extracted from the regions north and south of @xmath5 car can be modeled with high precision ; both spectra are best represented by three - temperature plasma models with @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 kev . analyzing the suzaku data in conjunction with xmm - newton and chandra data , hamaguchi et al .",
    "( 2007 ) concluded that the 0.2 kev and 0.6 kev components most likely originated from diffuse plasma , but the 5 kev component could not be easily distinguished from the unresolved point sources .",
    "they found that the iron and silicon abundances were significantly different in the north and south regions , and that the nitrogen - to - oxygen abundance ratios in both regions were far lower than those of stellar winds from evolved massive stars such as @xmath5 car and wr25 in this field . from these results",
    ", they concluded that the diffuse x - ray emission near @xmath5 car originated from one or multiple snrs .",
    "we have studied extended x - ray emission from an eastern tip region of the carina nebula .",
    "located @xmath10 30@xmath16 ( @xmath10 20 pc ) from @xmath5 car , this region is less contaminated by x - ray emission from ob stars than the regions near @xmath5 car .",
    "previous einstein observations have revealed strong extended x - ray emission in this region , although no massive stars earlier than b3 are known here @xcite .",
    "it is not known whether this emission is truly diffuse and , if so , whether its origin is similar to that of the regions near @xmath5 car . in this paper",
    "we report the first detailed spectral analysis of the extended x - ray emission in this eastern tip region of the carina nebula using suzaku observation . to augment the limited angular resolution of suzaku ,",
    "the analysis also made use of xmm - newton data .",
    "suzaku is the 5th japanese x - ray observatory @xcite .",
    "it carries four scientific instruments ; x - ray optics or the x - ray telescope ( xrt : @xcite ) ; an x - ray calorimeter ( xrs : @xcite ) ; four x - ray ccds ( xis : @xcite ) ; and a hard x - ray detector ( hxd : @xcite ) .",
    "the xis consists of three front - illuminated ( fi ) ccds ( xis0 , 2 , and 3 ) and one back - illuminated ( bi ) ccd ( xis1 ) . due to the low - earth orbit of suzaku and the large effective area ,",
    "the xis has the lowest particle backgrounds among all x - ray ccds in currently available x - ray observatories .",
    "furthermore , the xis has good energy resolution and superior low - energy response with negligible low - energy tails , compared to the other x - ray ccds onboard xmm - newton and chandra .",
    "we observed the eastern tip region of the carina nebula with suzaku on 2006 june 5 . during the observation",
    ", the xis and hxd were operated in the normal mode . in the present paper ,",
    "we use only the xis data because we are interested in the spectral analysis of the soft extended x - ray emission .",
    "the data reduction was performed on the version 1.2.2.3 screened data provided by the suzaku processing facility , using the heasoft analysis package ver 6.1.1 .",
    "no background flares were seen in the data .",
    "the net exposure of each fi and bi chip was 77 ks . for spectral fits , we generated response matrices and auxiliary files with xisrmfgen and xissimarfgen released on 2006 october 26 .",
    "the in - flight gradual degradation of energy resolution and absorption due to xis contamination were considered in these softwares .",
    "figure [ fig : overview]a shows the location of our observation ( top left box ) on an msx 8.28 @xmath17 m image of the carina nebula retrieved from the nasa / ipac infrared science archive .",
    "this mid - ir image is dominated by cationic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon emission in photodissociation regions @xcite and traces the surface of molecular clouds that are ionized by stellar winds and ultra - violet radiations from ob stars .",
    "a curved mid - infrared filament runs across the xis field - of - view ( fov ) .",
    "figure [ fig : overview]b shows an x - ray overview of the same area with xmm - newton mos . in x - rays , there exists patchy extended soft x - ray emission whose distribution roughly follows the mid - infrared filament .",
    "this suggests that the x - ray emission contributes to the ionization of the molecular cloud and that the emitting hot gas is in contact with the surface of the molecular clouds .",
    "we created suzaku xis images in 0.22 and 210 kev bands , as shown in figure [ fig : xisimage ] .",
    "the vignetting in the images has been corrected by dividing the observed images by model xis images produced with the xrt@xmath18xis simulator * xissim * for a uniform surface brightness . in simulations , we assumed monochromatic x - rays of energy 1.49 kev and 8.05 kev , since the vignetting is best studied in these energies @xcite . a blob - like extended x - ray emission is clearly detected in the soft x - ray band .",
    "no significant x - ray emission is seen in the hard x - ray band , which is consistent with the xmm - newton image ( figure  [ fig : overview ] b ) .    to evaluate the significance of the extended x - ray emission , we defined a region named blob , as shown in figure  [ fig : xisimage ] .",
    "the total area of the blob region is 234 arcmin@xmath19 , or 105 pc@xmath19 .",
    "we extracted the xis0 - 3 spectra from this region . to evaluate the background",
    ", we utilized spectra accumulated from observations of the night side of the earth , as the night earth backgrounds reproduced well all the observed spectra above @xmath106 kev , where the instrumental background dominated .",
    "the background - subtracted xis1 ( bi ) and xis@xmath20 ( fi ) spectra are shown in figure [ fig : xisdiffspec]a , and their 0.25 kev count rates with 1@xmath21 uncertainties are @xmath22 ( bi ) and @xmath23 ( fi ) counts s@xmath1 , respectively .",
    "the emission is highly significant and shows a number of emission lines such as o vii , o viii , ne ix , ne x , mg xi , si xiii , and s xv .",
    "lines from these ions in different ionization states , such as o vii and si xiii , suggest that the extended x - rays are from not a single - temperature but multi - temperature plasma .",
    "we extracted spectra from two surrounding regions named east and nw , as shown in figure  [ fig : xisimage ] .",
    "the areas of the east and nw regions are 47 arcmin@xmath19 ( or 21 pc@xmath19 ) and 21 arcmin@xmath19 ( or 9.3 pc@xmath19 ) , respectively .",
    "we again used the night earth spectra at the respective detector positions as backgrounds .",
    "the background - subtracted spectra are shown in figures [ fig : xisdiffspec]b and c. although their surface brightnesses are an order - of - magnitude lower than that in the blob region , there exist signs of emission lines from o vii , ne ix , ne x , mg xi , and si xiii .",
    "thus extended x - ray emission appears to be present over the entire fov .",
    "the surface brightness below 0.3 kev and above 2 kev is similar in all three regions .",
    "therefore , in addition to the plasma emission that is dominant between 0.3 and 2 kev , there must be additional x - ray sources .",
    "plausible candidates are the local hot bubble ( lhb ) , the cosmic x - ray background ( cxb ) , the galactic ridge x - ray emission ( grxe ) , and point sources .",
    "lhb and cxb are uniform and common background sources existing in all x - ray observations .",
    "grxe is also a uniform x - ray background and must contribute to the emission because the observational fov is located in the galactic plane ( @xmath24 , @xmath25 , see figure  [ fig : overview]a ) .",
    "the point sources , on the other hand , are position - dependent .",
    "contamination from these astrophysical backgrounds and point sources needs to be carefully considered in order to characterize the possible diffuse emission from the carina nebula .",
    "to quantify the contribution from point sources , we analyzed the xmm - newton data .",
    "xmm - newton observed this region on 2004 december 7 for 27 ks .",
    "the european photon imaging camera ( epic ) provided ccd imaging spectroscopy with one pn camera @xcite and two mos cameras @xcite .",
    "the medium optical blocking filter was used .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : overview]b , the fovs of mos cover the entire fov of the xis .",
    "we analyzed the archival processed data using sas ( science analysis software ) version 7.0.0 , following the sas user s guide .",
    "the event files were time - filtered to exclude periods of high background , during which the count rate from the entire ccd area at energies @xmath2610 kev is more than 1.2 times the average rate for each mos and pn observation .",
    "this removed @xmath101 ks from each observation , and yielded 22 and 26 ks[line - through]*ec * of usable exposure for pn and each mos , respectively .",
    "source detection was accomplished with the sas program edetect_chain .",
    "images in 8 bands ( 0.20.5 , 0.52.0 , 2.04.5 , 4.57.5 , 7.512.0 , and 0.212.0 kev ) were utilized , in order not to miss very soft or very hard sources .",
    "the resulting source list was checked manually for spurious detections and missed sources . as a result",
    ", 10 sources have been detected , among which 5 sources were within the fov of the xis .",
    "the locations of these x - ray point sources are marked by circles in figure [ fig : overview]b .",
    "for each individual point source , we extracted counts using a circular region of a 30 arcsec radius centered at the source .",
    "background counts were extracted from an adjacent annular region with an outer radius of 1 arcmin . in the case",
    "that the annular region included other sources , the background was then extracted from a nearby circular source - free region . to identify counterparts of these x - ray point sources in other wavelengths , we searched the 2@xmath17 m all sky survey catalog ( 2mass ) and the axaf guide and acquisition star catalog ( agast ) for candidates within 10 arcsec , the angular resolution of xmm - newton . in cases where multiple candidates exist , we chose the closest one as the most plausible counterpart . among the 10 x - ray sources ,",
    "9 have counterparts in 2mass and 1 has a counterpart in agast .",
    "the properties of these individual sources are summarized in table [ tbl : srclist ] .",
    "we examined the 10 sources for possible temporal variations . for each source",
    ", we produced pn and mos x - ray light curves in the 0.410 kev band using a binning size of 512 s bin@xmath1 .",
    "the light curves were examined against a constant hypothesis in terms of @xmath27 statistics . if the @xmath28 probability of constancy became less than 4% , at least in one detector , we regarded the source as variable .",
    "only the source no.3 has been found to be variable .",
    "it showed a factor of about 5 increase in the first 5 ks of the observation , decreased in the next 5 ks , and stayed constant in the rest .",
    "such rapid temporal variations strongly suggest that no.3 is a young low - mass star .",
    "we also conducted spectral analysis for 4 bright sources ( no.1 , 2 , 4 , and 7 ) that had @xmath29 counts in the pn observation .",
    "we analyzed only the pn spectra because of the limited statistics of mos .",
    "the sas tasks rmfgen and arfgen were utilized to generate response matrix files and auxiliary files for each source .",
    "we fitted the spectra using a thin - thermal plasma emission model in collisional equilibrium ( the apec mode ; @xcite ) convolved with the interstellar absorption .",
    "such models , with abundances fixed at 0.3 solar , are commonly used in x - ray spectral analyses of star - forming regions ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we found that all the spectra except that of no.1 were well represented by this simple model .",
    "for the no.1 spectrum , we tried a two - temperature plasma emission model with a common absorption , and were able to find acceptable fits .",
    "the fitting results are summarized in table [ tbl : srcfit ] and figure [ fig : xmmsrcspec ] .",
    "source no.1 has a very hard continuum without any sign of emission lines , thus it may be a background active galactic nucleus .",
    "source no.2 may be an embedded young low - mass star because it has a large absorption column density and a moderate temperature , while source no.4 may be a foreground star because of its small absorption column and moderate temperature .",
    "source no.7 is peculiar with a low temperature and possibly high luminosity .",
    "its position is within 8 arcsec from the x - ray source no.78 in an xmm - newton observation of @xmath5 car reported by @xcite .",
    "further optical spectroscopic study is needed to identify the nature of this source .",
    "we estimated x - ray fluxes of the other 6 sources assuming a thin - thermal plasma model and convolving it with an estimated interstellar absorption of @xmath30 cm@xmath2 .",
    "we adopted a temperature of 3 kev and a metal abundance of 0.3 solar that are typical of emission from young stars ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "webpimms was used to convert the pn count rates to x - ray fluxes .",
    "the results are shown in table [ tbl : srclist ] .",
    "the fluxes range from 2@xmath3210@xmath33 to 4@xmath3210@xmath34 erg s@xmath1 cm@xmath2 .",
    "we proceeded to estimate contribution to the observed x - ray emission by lhb , cxb , grxe , and point sources .",
    "for the lhb , cxb , and grxe , we assumed the same models in @xcite : the raymond - smith thin - thermal plasma model with @xmath35 kev and a surface brightness of @xmath36 counts s@xmath1 arcmin@xmath2 for lhb based on @xcite , the model id1 in table 2 of @xcite for cxb , and the free abundance model in table 8 of @xcite with the x - ray flux of @xmath37 erg cm@xmath2 s@xmath1 deg@xmath2 ( 320 kev ) for grxe .",
    "we used the same spectral parameters except for the normalization to fit , which was adjusted . to estimate the x - ray fluxes from these components with different spatial distribution",
    ", we prepared an arf file for the uniform emission ( lhb , cxb , and grxe ) by using the xissimarfgen program , while we created an arf file for each point source .",
    "we used the best - fit models in table [ tbl : srcfit ] for the bright point sources and assumed the typical spectral model of young low - mass stars for the other faint point sources ( @xmath38 kev and @xmath30 cm@xmath2 ) using the apec emission code .    in figure",
    "[ fig : bgdest]a , we plot the estimated contamination from lhb , cxb , grxe , and point sources in the blob region . below 0.3 kev , lhb accounts for the x - ray emission , while x - rays above 2 kev can be explained by the sum of cxb , grxe and point sources .",
    "this makes a sharp contrast to the @xmath5 car region where a residual hard x - ray emission is seen above 2 kev .",
    "the excellent fit of these sources to the spectrum below 0.3 kev and above 2 kev supports the validity of our estimation .",
    "thus , almost all the excess counts in 0.32 kev can be considered to be truly diffuse plasma emission .",
    "this conclusion is also supported by the clear spectral differences between the diffuse plasma and point sources .    in the same way ,",
    "we estimated the x - ray contamination in the east and nw regions as shown in figures [ fig : bgdest]b and c. in both regions , lhb , cxb , grxe , and point sources explain all the emission in @xmath39 and @xmath40 kev as well as in the blob region , but there are still excesses in 0.32 kev . therefore , diffuse soft x - ray emission exists in these fields , too .",
    "the nature of the diffuse x - ray emission is investigated through spectral analysis .",
    "we simultaneously fitted the 0.25 kev xis bi and fi spectra of the blob region .",
    "we created xis arf files using xissimarfgen , assuming the 0.42 kev xmm mos image in figure [ fig : overview]b as spatial distribution of the diffuse x - ray emission . in single or two - temperature plasma models utilized below",
    ", we allow the abundances of the noticeable elements ( o , ne , mg , si , s , and fe ) to vary , while those of the other elements were fixed at 0.3 solar value , which is generally seen in low - resolution ccd spectra of young stars .",
    "in addition to the plasma model for the diffuse x - ray emission , we introduced a thin - thermal plasma model and a power - law model to reproduce the lhb , cxb , grxe , and point source contributions (  [ sec : contami ] ) .",
    "for the plasma model of lhb , we fixed the temperature at 0.1 kev and the abundances at 1 solar , but allowed the normalization to vary .",
    "for simplicity , the cxb , grxe , and point sources were together approximated by a single power - law model with the photon index fixed at 1.5 and convolved with the same absorption of the diffuse x - ray emission . to take into account possible uncertainties in the energy scale calibration",
    ", we introduced two additional fitting parameters , gain and offset . throughout the fittings below",
    ", the best - fit energy scale and offset values were @xmath411 % and @xmath416 ev , respectively , consistent with the current calibration uncertainties .",
    "we first tested a single - temperature thin - thermal plasma model convolved with an absorption .",
    "this simple model yielded an unacceptable best fit for the spectra with @xmath27/d.o.f .",
    "of @xmath42 .",
    "the best - fit temperature , @xmath43 = 0.59 kev , was too high to reproduce the significant ovii and neix lines .",
    "we then tried a commonly - absorbed two - temperature plasma model as shown in figure [ fig : fit12]a and table [ tbl : fit1 ] ( model 1 ) .",
    "this model represents the data far better ( @xmath27/d.o.f . of @xmath44 ) .",
    "a small discrepancy of the fit to the data at 0.50.8 kev and 1.11.2 kev may be caused by inaccuracy of the fe l - shell emission line model and calibration uncertainty near the mirror au l edges , respectively .",
    "indeed , similar discrepancies at 0.50.8 kev can be seen in other suzaku xis spectral fits ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , we think the best - fit two - temperature model represents the data well , although the @xmath27 is still not above the 90% confidence level .",
    "similar to the analysis of the blob region , we fitted the east and nw spectra with a two - temperature plasma model . since no evident spatial structures were seen in these regions ( figure [ fig : xisimage ] )",
    ", we created arf files assuming a uniform emission .",
    "we did not use the additional fitting parameters gain and offset because the photon statistics were limited .",
    "the results are shown in figures [ fig : fit12]b and c , and table [ tbl : fit1 ] . in both regions ,",
    "the fits are acceptable and all resulting parameters except the surface brightness are consistent with those in the blob region , although the uncertainties are large .",
    "as expected from figure [ fig : xisimage ] , the surface brightness of the east and nw regions is a factor of @xmath105 lower than that in the blob region .",
    "we also tried a single - temperature plasma model and obtained acceptable fits in both regions , but the best - fit column densities were small , @xmath45 cm@xmath2 , and the best - fit temperatures were high , @xmath100.6 kev .",
    "such a large variation in the column density within the xis fov is inconsistent with the co map ( figure [ fig : overview]a ) , although the co gas can lie behind the x - ray emitting gas .",
    "there is also a hint of ovii k emission in both spectra ( figures [ fig : xisdiffspec ] b and c ) that can not be reproduced by this best - fit single - temperature model .",
    "therefore , it is likely that the east and nw spectra are also best fitted by a two - temperature plasma model .",
    "we also analyzed the xmm - newton observations of the blob region with the same data used in the point source analysis (  [ sec : ps ] ) .",
    "we used only the mos data with relatively low particle background events , whose background spectrum during the observation can be easily estimated from the esas package .",
    "we used sas version 7.0.0 and esas version 1.0 for the analysis , and generated response matrices using the rmfgen and arfgen .",
    "we found that the two - temperature plasma model well represents the mos spectra , as was the case for the suzaku xis spectra .",
    "figure [ fig : fit3 ] and table [ tbl : fit3 ] show the fitting result .",
    "since there can be c k@xmath46 emission around 0.4 kev , we allowed the c abundance to vary .",
    "the energy band of 1.161.28 , 1.41.6 , and 1.71.8 kev are omitted in order to exclude the instrumental emission lines from mg k@xmath46 , al k@xmath46 , and si k@xmath46 . because the low energy tail of the mos response prevents the distinction between the diffuse low temperature plasma component and the lhb , only an upper limit",
    "is obtained for the lhb .",
    "alternatively the best - fit column density becomes somewhat lower than that in table [ tbl : fit1 ] ( model 1 ) , to compensate the decreased low energy counts by the lhb component .",
    "the other two - temperature plasma parameters such as temperatures and abundances are surprisingly similar to those in table [ tbl : fit1 ] ( model 1 ) .",
    "the only difference is the higher power - law component flux .",
    "this may be caused by the relatively higher background of xmm - newton observations and their higher uncertainty .",
    "we thus conclude that the xis and mos data are consistent with each other and the fitting result of the xis data is reliable .",
    "we investigated extended x - ray emission in the eastern tip region of the carina nebula with suzaku xis . for the first time",
    ", we conducted detailed spectral analysis of the x - ray emission and found that there is indeed diffuse x - ray emission , even considering lhb , cxb , grxe , and point sources .",
    "the diffuse x - ray emission is well represented by a two - temperature plasma model with @xmath43 @xmath100.25 and @xmath100.55 kev . emission measures and abundances of o ,",
    "ne , mg , si , s , and fe are well constrained owing to the good photon statistics and the excellent energy response of xis .",
    "below we estimate plasma properties based on the spectral fitting and then compare the spectral parameters such as absorption column density , temperature and abundance to those in the @xmath5 car region , in order to assess the origin of the diffuse plasma .",
    "high signal - to - noise xis spectra enable us to accurately constrain the parameters of the diffuse plasma in the eastern tip region of the carina nebula . the best - fit column density of @xmath47@xmath48 cm@xmath2 and also the temperatures of @xmath130.3 kev and 0.40.6 kev in the blob , east and nw regions agree very well with those in the @xmath5 car regions ( see the medium - temperature components of the @xmath49",
    ", @xmath43 tied model in table 2 of @xcite or hereafter h2007 model ; @xmath50 cm@xmath2 , @xmath13 kev and @xmath51 kev ) .",
    "although the high - temperature component represented by a hot plasma model with @xmath52 kev in the h2007 model is not seen in the eastern tip region , this is thought to be a composite of diffuse hard x - ray emission and contaminations from cxb , grxe , and point source , and hence can be ignored .",
    "this similarity in basic plasma parameters provides strong evidence that the diffuse plasma in the vicinity of the carina nebula has the same origin .",
    "the continuous distribution of the diffuse x - ray emission over the carina nebula , as shown in figure [ fig : overview ] , supports this hypothesis .",
    "thus , we can draw a scenario that the x - ray emitting diffuse plasma generated by stellar winds from ob stars and/or snrs forms hot bubbles with the size of several tens of pc and ionizes ambient molecular clouds which can be seen in the mid - infrared emission . to investigate the origin of the diffuse plasma",
    ", we estimate physical properties of the plasma in the blob region .",
    "we assume that the plasma in the blob region have a prolate ellipsoidal shape with the major and minor axis lengths of 8 and 3 pc , respectively .",
    "following the plasma analysis by @xcite , we estimate the electron density , the pressure , the total energy content , the cooling time and the mass of the plasma from the observed x - ray luminosity , temperatures , and the assumed volume .",
    "we derived two sets of plasma parameters for the two - temperature components from model 1 in table [ tbl : fit1 ] .",
    "the derived parameters are summarized in table [ tbl : plasma ] .",
    "below we examine the two interpretations , i.e. , stellar winds from ob stars and snrs , based on these derived parameters . because there are no massive ob stars in the eastern tip region , we must consider the massive stellar clusters in the central part of the carina nebula for the former scenario .",
    "the estimated plasma pressure @xmath53 is on the order of @xmath1010@xmath54 k @xmath55 and should be larger than that of the surrounding gas in the eastern tip region since both the co and radio continuum intensities are weak in the vicinity of the blob region @xcite .",
    "this means that diffuse plasma in the eastern tip region could flow from its neighbor .",
    "if we consider that the plasma originated in stellar winds from ob stars near @xmath5 car and has been propagated to this region at the plasma sound velocity , the crossing time will be 0.1 myr . because this time scale is much shorter than that of the radiative cooling timescale , @xmath56 @xmath261 myr ,",
    "the plasma temperatures can be held constant .",
    "ob stars are able to continuously produce the plasma during 0.1 myr since their typical life time is at least ten times longer .",
    "the snr interpretation is also possible in terms of the pressure if one or multiple snrs occurred in these regions .",
    "the total thermal energy of the plasma , @xmath57 = @xmath58 ergs , is marginally lower than the total kinetic energy supplied by the stellar wind from a single massive star within @xmath59 myr , @xmath60 ergs @xcite .",
    "as the carina nebula contains @xmath2664 ob stars , the observed thermal energy can be easily supplied by the mechanical energy of the stellar winds from the @xmath2664 ob stars , @xmath61 ergs .",
    "if all the diffuse x - ray emission observed with einstein has the same origin , the total plasma energy will be about 10 times larger , i.e. , @xmath62 ergs . assuming that the stellar winds from these @xmath63 ob stars ( @xmath61 ergs ) are responsible for the hot plasma , the kinetic - to - thermal energy conversion efficiency will be @xmath415% . according to @xcite , the thermal energy in the shocked stellar wind is 5/11 of the total stellar wind kinetic energy .",
    "thus , this conversion efficiency may be doubled , @xmath4110 % , which is comparable to that in m17 ( @xmath1010% , @xcite ) and larger than that in the orion nebula ( @xmath64% , @xcite ) . in the snr case",
    ", we can also explain the energy by only one canonical supernova ( @xmath65 ergs ) even if we must explain all the diffuse x - ray emission in the entire carina nebula .",
    "the mass of the plasma , @xmath66 @xmath67 , needs at least four typical ob stars assuming a typical mass loss rate of stellar winds of 10@xmath68yr@xmath1 in 1 myr .",
    "if we consider the whole carina nebula , about @xmath2680 ob stars are necessary for the entire diffuse plasma mass .",
    "the known number of ob stars is thus marginal . on the other hand",
    ", one snr again can supply this mass ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , although both the stellar - wind and snr interpretations are possible , snr(s ) can explain the derived plasma parameters such as the total plasma energy and the plasma mass , more easily .",
    "as suggested by @xcite , the existence of the carina flare supershell @xcite validates the snr scenario .",
    "if true , the observed plasma temperatures of 0.3 and 0.6 kev limit the snr age to less than @xmath1010@xmath69 yr , since an older snr would be in the radiative phase and efficiently cool down to less than 0.1 kev .",
    "the abundance pattern of the x - ray emitting plasma provides another key piece of information to constrain its origin .",
    "we showed abundance patterns of the blob region and that of the @xmath5 car regions in figures [ fig : abd ]  a and b , respectively . since @xcite divided the @xmath5 car region into the north and south regions and fitted the two spectra simultaneously with tied column density and temperatures in the h2007 model , two sets of abundances are shown .",
    "all the metal abundances in the blob region ( model 1 , black ) are significantly higher than those in the @xmath5 car regions .",
    "this may strengthen the result of @xcite that the metal abundances of the diffuse x - ray emission show spatial variations . however , there is a possibility that the fixed abundances of c , n , al , ar , ca and ni in table [ tbl : fit1 ] influence the other metal abundances .",
    "thus , we refitted the blob region spectra with different fixed abundance sets .",
    "firstly we tested one solar for the fixed abundances . in model 1 , we implicitly assumed 0.3 solar for them because the value is generally used for young stars in star - forming regions .",
    "however , since any mixing of the plasma generated by either stellar winds or snr(s ) interacting with the ambient molecular clouds contains processed stellar material and may have higher abundances , it is thus worth considering the solar abundances in modeling the diffuse emission .",
    "the results are summarized in figure [ fig : abd ]  a and table [ tbl : fit1 ] ( model 2 ) .",
    "the @xmath27 was comparable to that of model 1 and all the abundances increased by a factor of @xmath102 , while the emission measures of the two plasma components decreased by about the same amount , to balance the increased line intensities . since the snrs with an age around 10@xmath69 yrs , like the cygnus loop or vela ,",
    "globally show no strong deviation from solar abundances @xcite , this fitting result allows the snr interpretation .",
    "next we assumed the abundances of the h2007 model in which all the abundances were allowed to vary and constrained with good photon statistics .",
    "we used two sets of fixed abundances corresponding to the north and the south fits .",
    "the results are summarized in figure [ fig : abd ]  a and table [ tbl : fit1 ] ( models 3 and 4 ) . in both cases",
    ", the fittings were acceptable and all the free abundances were significantly decreased .",
    "these changes were caused by the decreased n and ni fixed abundances that influence the others via the nv k and ni l emission lines .",
    "for instance , when we used the abundances for the north region ( model 3 ) , the n abundance changes from 0.3 to 0 solar and to compensate for the decreased photon counts in the 0.50.6 kev band , the normalization of the lower - temperature component ( @xmath70 kev ) increases and the abundances of the other elements are suppressed .",
    "when the abundances for the south region ( model 4 ) are utilized , the ni l lines in the 0.81.4 kev range increases and the abundances of the other elements related to this energy band decreases .",
    "the abundances of the blob region approaches to those of the @xmath5 car region ( figure [ fig : abd ]  b ) if we use these abundance sets .",
    "the abundance values are therefore strongly influenced by the fixed abundances . in model 2 , all the abundances are around one solar , while in model 1 , 3 and 4 , the best - fit metal abundances are far less than one .",
    "this is due to the fact that the metal abundance and emission measure are coupled with each other . to decouple these parameters , we need more precise spectral measurements with x - ray microcalorimeters in future missions . in spite of the difficulty to determine the absolute abundances , abundance patterns of the blob region in models 1 - 4 are similar to those in the @xmath5 car regions .",
    "this similarity is another line of evidence that the diffuse x - ray emission in the eastern tip region and the @xmath5 car region has the same origin .",
    "because the abundance patterns are rather independent of the fixed abundances , we can also evaluate the abundance ratio of different elements .",
    "importantly , there is no significant overabundance in nitrogen to oxygen that is expected from the optical , uv and x - ray spectroscopy of @xmath5 car and wr 25 @xcite .",
    "this result agrees with that in the @xmath5 car region @xcite and suggests that , if stellar winds produced the diffuse x - ray plasma , the main drivers of the winds are main - sequence ob stars , and not evolved massive stars .",
    "also the observed fe / o ratio of 1.31.9 is too high compared to that of a type - ii supernova , 0.5 @xcite .",
    "although the fe / o ratio increases up to 1 in type - ii snrs for less massive stars ( @xmath71 , table 1 in @xcite ) , this contradicts the fact that the more massive stars evolve faster and explode earlier .",
    "we note that similar situations exist in other massive star forming regions .",
    "for example , detailed spectral study of the diffuse x - ray emission has been conducted with suzaku in m17 @xcite .",
    "we plot the abundance pattern of the diffuse plasma in m17 in figure [ fig : abd ]  c. as is the case for the carina nebula , it shows a high fe / o ratio and not enhanced n - to - o ratio , the latter of which may be natural because m17 contains no wr stars @xcite .",
    "its subsolar abundances may be affected by the fixed values at 0.3 solar .",
    "thus , both the stellar - wind and snr interpretations are possible in terms of the absolute abundances .",
    "the abundance pattern may favor plasma heating by winds from main - sequence ob stars .",
    "another possibility is a mixture of stellar winds and snrs . also , since hot shocked gas by stellar winds and/or",
    "snrs mix up interstellar gas , we may only see the interstellar abundances rather than stellar and/or snr abundances .",
    "further studies are necessary from both observational and theoretical aspects .      the x - ray spectrum above 2  kev can be explained by contribution of cxb , grxe and known point sources .",
    "this means that the residual hard x - ray emission , seen around @xmath5  carinae @xcite , localizes within @xmath1030@xmath16 from @xmath5  car .",
    "the scale size is consistent with an apparently extended hard x - ray emission discovered with the ginga satellite @xcite though the ginga result did not count out emission from known point sources .",
    "because soft ( @xmath412  kev ) diffuse x - ray spectra of the eastern tip region and the southern part of the @xmath5  car region are almost identical , the diffuse plasma would not relate to the residual hard x - ray emission .",
    "probably , the residual emission originates from a large number of low mass young stars embedded in the cloud around @xmath5  car , which are too faint to be detected individually .",
    "in the present paper , we have investigated the properties of diffuse x - ray emission associated with the eastern tip region of the carina nebula using the suzaku and xmm - newton data .",
    "our conclusion is as follows .",
    "\\(1 ) strong extended x - ray emission was detected from the entire field - of - view of suzaku with a 0.25 kev surface brightness of 0.7@xmath104@xmath72 erg s@xmath1 arcmin@xmath2 .",
    "comparisons with the estimated contamination from astrophysical backgrounds and point sources suggest that most of the emission is diffuse in nature .",
    "\\(2 ) the observed absorption column density and temperature are consistent with those in the @xmath5car region , suggesting the same origin as the diffuse x - ray emission in the vicinity of the carina nebula .",
    "\\(3 ) estimated physical properties of the plasma such as pressure , total energy , and mass can be explained by stellar winds from ob stars in the carina nebula or young snr(s ) with the age less than @xmath1010@xmath69 yr . the snr interpretation can provide the necessary energy and mass more easily .",
    "\\(4 ) absolute abundance values are strongly affected by abundances of metals fixed in spectral fits , allowing both the stellar - wind and snr interpretations .",
    "the low nitrogen - to - oxygen and high iron - to - oxygen ratios derived from the spectral fits may support that the diffuse plasma heated up by stellar winds from main - sequence ob stars .",
    "the abundance ratios can be produced by a mixture of stellar winds and snrs , as well .",
