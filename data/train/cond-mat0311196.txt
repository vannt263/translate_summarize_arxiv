    "magnesium diboride ( @xmath6 ) appears to be a rather `` unconventional '' conventional superconductor @xcite .",
    "two band effects observed as deviations of conventional bcs  include : anomalous specific heat @xcite and two gaps features ( including double peaked tunneling conductance spectra ) @xcite .",
    "the superconductive mechanism , nevertheless seems to be conventional phonon bcs - like @xcite . in this short communication",
    "we present a two band model based on the classical work by suhl et al . @xcite and on an extension of the latter applied to high @xmath5 compounds @xcite .",
    "we mention other multiband models in the literature @xcite , and some calculations and fittings within a multiband and strong coupling context include ref . .",
    "in section ii we introduce a two band model @xcite and within the usual bcs scheme we compute the mean field expressions for the free energy , entropy , critical field , conductance , and the selfconsistent equations for the gaps functions . in particular we consider the simplest case : solely interband pairing coupling via phonons . in section iii",
    "we compare our simple model with some experimental results for the case of @xmath6 @xcite , indicating that the interband pairing mechanism is somehow relevant . finally in section",
    "iv we present some concluding remarks and future work .",
    "our model follows ref . , with the hamiltonian    @xmath7    where the @xmath8 s are the usual creation operators , @xmath9 are the bands dispersion ( @xmath10 ) , @xmath11 are the positive pairing coefficients @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "we have defined @xmath14 @xmath15 , @xmath16 is the number of sites and the last summation is with the usual energy cutoff @xmath17 .",
    "the order parameters @xmath18 are defined as the expectation values    @xmath19    the effective hamiltonian is given by ( within the hartree fock scheme for anomalous pairing , see ref . )",
    "@xmath20    where    @xmath21    and @xmath22 , @xmath23 are the usual pauli matrices@xmath24 the free energy per site @xmath25 is given by    @xmath26    @xmath27    where @xmath28 @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 the relative free energy @xmath32 , the thermodynamic critical field @xmath33 , entropy ( per site ) and specific heat are given , respectively by    @xmath34    @xmath35    @xmath36    the condensation energy is given by    @xmath37    and the superconductor- normal tunneling differential conductance ( conveniently scaled ) is defined by    @xmath38    @xmath39    minimization of the free energy with respect to the gaps functions@xmath40 yields a coupled nonlinear system of integral equations for the gaps , to be solved selfconsistently , and given by    @xmath41    where    @xmath42    and with @xmath43 the density of states associated to the respective band .",
    "the transition temperature is the highest temperature @xmath44 solution of    @xmath45",
    "we compute the observables presented in the previous section .",
    "in particular we consider only interband scattering @xmath46 @xmath47 , the simplest relevant case @xcite .",
    "we consider two flat symmetric bands , with @xmath48 .",
    "the gaps equations ( [ self ] ) now read    @xmath49    @xmath50    * at zero temperature * the gaps equations are given by ( in convenient units )    @xmath51    where @xmath52 and @xmath53 satisfies a selfconsistent equation .",
    "an excellent approximate solution is given by    @xmath54    with    @xmath55    notice that all the above mentioned observables will yield the standard bcs expressions @xcite in the limit @xmath3 .",
    "the critical temperature is given by @xmath56    we label the bands such that @xmath57 if we consider @xmath6 , from ref .",
    "we have @xmath58 @xmath59 , @xmath60 yielding @xmath61 . from ref .",
    "we approximate @xmath62 @xmath63 @xmath64 @xmath65 yielding @xmath66 .    in figure 1",
    "we plot the normalized gaps @xmath67 at zero temperature , eq.([gaps ] ) , and ( minus ) the condensation energy @xmath68 eq.([cond ] ) , both as function of @xmath69 the condensation energy is normalized to the bcs reference state @xmath70 @xmath71 ( see eq.[obs1 ] ) .",
    "the chosen normalization yields the standard bcs ( weak coupling ) value of unity for the gaps and the condensation energy .",
    "as @xmath1 is varied away from zero the condensation energy is less than the standard bcs .",
    "one gap will depart from weak to ` a medium coupling regime ' ( @xmath72 ) , conversely the other gap will dive towards ` a less than weak coupling regime ' ( @xmath73 ) , with the geometrical average @xmath74 always in the standard weak coupling regime .",
    "these features seem consistent as we fit the parameter @xmath1 with experimental data @xcite-@xcite .    in order to solve for the gaps , eq.([self ] ) , we can use the available low temperature and near the critical temperature expansions @xcite .",
    "these allow us to nicely interpolate , for the full temperature regime @xmath75 .",
    "once this is done we can readily compute the specific heat , eq.([obs3 ] ) , entropy , eq.([obs2 ] ) , and the thermodynamic critical field , eq.([obs1 ] ) .    in figure 2",
    "we plot the specific heat @xmath76 ( normalized to the normal state value at @xmath5 ) versus the temperature @xmath77 for several values of @xmath69 the standard bcs result is represented by the curve @xmath78 the anomalous behavior of @xmath76 consists in going under the bcs  value in the region @xmath79 , and going over the bcs value in the region @xmath80 this feature is in very good agreement with ref . .",
    "in figure 3 we plot the entropy @xmath81 ( normalized to the normal state value at @xmath5 ) versus the temperature @xmath77 for several values of @xmath69 the standard bcs result is represented by the curve @xmath78 as @xmath1 departs from zero ( bands are less ` identical ' ) the system increases its entropy . in figure 4 we plot the thermodynamic critical field ( normalized to the reference state @xmath3 , @xmath82 ) versus the temperature @xmath77 for several values of @xmath69 the standard bcs result is again represented by the curve @xmath78 as @xmath1 increases the critical field is reduced when compared to the bcs value .",
    "this is in agreement with experimental results @xcite .    in figure 5",
    "we plot the conductance , eq.([conduc ] ) versus applied voltage , for a fixed value of @xmath83 , and for several temperatures , and where a small dispersion is included , @xmath84 mev @xcite.the double peaked form is in very good agreement with observations ( see for example ref . ) .",
    "we presented the simplest relevant two band model for superconductivity , based on a standard bcs - like pairing mechanism .",
    "we computed the gaps equations at zero temperature . also the specific heat , entropy , critical field and conductance as function of temperature .",
