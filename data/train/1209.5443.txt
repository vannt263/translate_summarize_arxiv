    "the nuclear starburst region has relatively higher @xmath0 than the surrounding areas .",
    "the highest temperature in the nuclear region ( yellow in the figure ) is elongated in a roughly nw to se direction nearly perpendicular to the bar and extending to the nw .",
    "this extension to the northwest is also seen in the _ xmm - newton _  image presented in @xcite .",
    "however , there is no large difference in temperature among these regions overall , which is also consistent with what has previously been found in the other star - forming galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "interestingly , the temperature along the ( northern ) bar decreases whereas the surface brightness remains roughly constant .",
    "the temperature is higher to the northwest of the northern bar ( within the s - shape ) .",
    "the measured @xmath19  is in the range of ( 2@xmath78@xmath2210@xmath23  @xmath24 , which is much larger than the galactic @xmath19  value of 3@xmath510@xmath25  @xmath24 @xcite along the line of sight .",
    "in fact , this is larger than the intrinsic @xmath19  value for ngc  2903  of @xmath15@xmath510@xmath25  @xmath24 derived from the hi nearby galaxy survey data @xcite estimated using their equation  ( 5 ) .",
    "we note that applying a single temperature model to the multi - temperature gas seen in galaxies often tends to result in a higher column density because of the need to suppress low - energy emission in the model ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "however , the spectral properties , both @xmath19  and @xmath27 , along the south side of bar does not show a correlation with the underlying galactic structures , similar to the lack of correlation with these features in the x - ray surface brightness .    the x - ray electron density , @xmath20 , is estimated from the model fit parameters in the following way . the spectral model normalization , @xmath28 ,",
    "is related to the emission integral , @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the x - ray emitting volume and @xmath31 is a volume filling factor .",
    "this volume filling factor represents the fraction of the volume actually occupied by x - ray emitting gas .",
    "we assume that the number densities of ions , @xmath32 , and electrons are equal .",
    "this is a reasonable assumption for hydrogen dominated plasma .",
    "the electron number density , then , can be estimated as @xmath33 .    in order to derive an electron density map , we assume that the hot gas fully occupies ( @xmath34 ) a cylindrical volume represented by a scale height , @xmath35  pc , of the disk .",
    "the electron density then scales linearly with @xmath36 .",
    "this is , of course , not the only possible scenario ; the gas ( or some fraction of the gas ) may extend above the disk in the form of an outflow .",
    "this possibility is examined further in   [ sec : dis ] .    using the derived @xmath20 and the flux - weighted mean x - ray temperature @xmath37 ,",
    "the hot gas pressure @xmath38 can be derived .",
    "the pressure is also highest in the nuclear region , approaching 25 @xmath510@xmath39  k  @xmath40 , and is more centrally - peaked than either the temperature or the electron density alone .",
    "the pressure distribution is smoother beyond the nuclear region approaching a roughly constant value of ( 5@xmath77 ) @xmath510@xmath39  k  @xmath40 .    in summary ,",
    "figure  [ f : tmap ] shows that the highest density , temperature , and pressure region is the nuclear starburst region .",
    "this is also the highest surface brightness region ( figure  [ f : xdiff ] ) .",
    "the density is relatively high in the region along and to the northwest of the northern portion of the stellar bar .",
    "we do not see an analogous feature corresponding to the south side of the bar .",
    "lastly , the pressure map indicates that only the nuclear starburst region is highly pressurized if we assume an equal scale height for all the regions .",
    "in fact , it is possible that the hot gas is flowing out into a low density halo region , which would imply a different morphology of the gas volume than considered here .",
    "we point out that the fitted column density and temperature parameters are often anti - correlated .",
    "there are low column density ( blue ) regions , where the temperature is high ( yellow and orange regions west of the nucleus ) . also , the temperature is lower ( red ) where the column density is higher ( yellow ) .",
    "another , though weaker , positive correlation sometimes occurs between column density and electron density ( proportional to the square root of the model normalization ) in these single - temperature models .",
    "we show the column density of all the pixels in the map against their corresponding temperature to examine this behavior in figure  [ f : banana ] .",
    "the left panel of figure  [ f : banana ] clearly shows that most regions follow the anti - correlation with higher @xmath19  values tending to correspond to lower temperatures .",
    "these regions are located in the bottom left side of the figure .",
    "there are also regions that do not follow this trend , spreading into the top right of the plot .",
    "we selected three groups in this parameter space as indicated by lines in the left panel of figure  [ f : banana ] based on the grouping of the regions apparent to the eye .",
    "the right panel of figure  [ f : banana ] shows the spatial map of the corresponding groups defined in this way .",
    "as anticipated , the nuclear region corresponds to the top right group consisting of the hottest , most heavily absorbed gas with clearly different properties than the other two regions .",
    "the middle and bottom left groups also show strong spatial correlations .",
    "the middle group regions are located to the east and the bottom left group are located primarily to the west of the nuclear region .",
    "although these regions were found using solar abundances , we note that similar structures are evident when changing abundances to a different value , such as @xmath41 . in order to understand",
    "why these regions are different , we analyze the x - ray spectra extracted from these three groupings , or zones , where we are able to apply more complex models in the next section .",
    "we have shown in the previous section , using detailed maps of the thermodynamic state of the hot , x - ray - emitting gas , that the spatial complexity observed at other wavelengths is clearly present at x - ray energies .",
    "on the other hand , there are no strong correlations between the x - ray morphology and the underlying galactic structure with the notable exception of the nucleus .",
    "there is a general trend of lower temperature and lower column density to the west of the nuclear region relative to east of the nuclear region . in this section",
    ", we will analyze in greater detail the spectral properties of three zones : the @xmath115  nuclear starburst region , and the two extended diffuse emission regions to the east and to the west of the nucleus .",
    "we performed x - ray spectral analysis of the diffuse nuclear emission defined as the light gray zone of figure  [ f : banana ] from the @xmath42  correlation .",
    "this zone is roughly 15  ( 650  pc ) in radius .",
    "we first fit the same absorbed thermal model using the same energy range ( 0.5@xmath72.0  kev ) as before to validate the results in our thermodynamic maps .",
    "we obtained @xmath19  = 5.8@xmath4310@xmath23  @xmath24 , and @xmath0=0.22@xmath44  kev , which is consistent with the results from the maps .",
    "however , with many more counts in the source spectrum , this simple absorbed thermal model with a solar abundance is not well fitted to the data ( @xmath45 ) .",
    "in fact , there are enough counts to extend the model fit to higher energies , 0.5@xmath76.0  kev , resulting in 2205 @xmath2648 net counts after background subtraction .",
    "the same local background , taken from outside the @xmath12 isophote , that was used for creating the thermodynamic map was used here .",
    "the spectrum was grouped to contain at least 40 counts in each spectral bin , and the @xmath46 statistic was used for determining the goodness of fit .    including the higher energy photons resulted in raising the temperature ( @xmath0=0.5 ) and lowering the column density ( 2@xmath510@xmath23  @xmath24 ) of the best - fitting single - temperature model but the fit is unacceptable ( @xmath47 ) .",
    "next , we allowed the elemental abundances in the mekal model component to vary keeping their ratios fixed to the solar ratios given by @xcite .",
    "this dramatically improved the fit to @xmath481.9 with one fewer degree of freedom and resulted in raising the best - fitting temperature to @xmath0=0.58  kev and lowering @xmath19  to 3@xmath510@xmath25  @xmath24 .",
    "the resulting abundances were subsolar , @xmath41 , which is inconsistent with the _ xmm - newton_/rgs result @xcite and is problematic if the hot gas originates from @xmath16-element - rich core - collapse supernovae as expected . on the other hand ,",
    "the widely - applied weaver model @xcite of hot bubble formation predicts the majority of hot gas is mass - loaded from the surrounding cold clouds rather than coming from the metal - rich shocked supernovae gas .",
    "it is also known that a simplistic model sometimes gives very low abundances when applied to the relatively low ccd resolution imaging spectra @xcite .",
    "hence , we do not argue strongly that the resultant abundance estimate is realistic and decided to fix abundances at the solar value , consistent with @xcite , in the remainder of our analysis .",
    "the fitting residuals indicate that the single - temperature model best fits the data only between 0.7 and 1.2  kev .",
    "therefore , we added a second model component , either a power - law component or a second thermal model , to account for the softer and harder emission .    adding",
    "a power - law model resulted in a significantly improved fit statistic ( @xmath491 ) .",
    "the power - law index is @xmath50=2.65 .",
    "this value is similar to that found in the nuclear starburst regions of ngc  1365 @xcite and ngc  5135 @xcite .",
    "these authors interpreted this hard emission as unresolved point sources ; however , the power - law slope is much steeper than the slope of the detected point sources in ngc  2903  ( @xmath511.95 ; see the appendix ) .",
    "also , fitting only the data in the range 2 and 6  kev gives an even steeper index of @xmath14 .",
    "we argue that the harder x - ray emission is unlikely to come from unresolved point sources and is instead a hotter thermal component .    adding a second thermal component instead of a power law results in a @xmath492 , but not yet an acceptable fit .",
    "the two temperature model results in a second temperature of @xmath13  kev , which may be interpreted as shocked gas directly associated with a `` wind fluid '' as observed in powerful starbursts like m82 @xcite .",
    "this is a more realistic interpretation than the unresolved point source ( power law ) interpretation of the hard emission for the nuclear region of ngc  2903 . to obtain a better fit statistic , however ,",
    "a third thermal component is required .",
    "the resultant fitting parameters are tabulated in table  [ t : diffusefits ] where the errors are quoted at the 1@xmath11 ( 68% confidence level ) .",

    "part of the reason is that ngc  2903  is viewed at an inclination of 60  compared to the edge - on orientation of m82 but the wind power ( or , equivalently , mass loss rate ) is apparently much weaker in ngc  2903  compared to m82 .",

    "there are too few net x - ray source counts detected from ngc  2903  to quantify any underlying non - thermal emission component or to use emission lines from highly - ionized metals to better constrain the thermal component of the hard emission as @xcite were able to do for m82 .",
    "the hard continuum emission temperature from m82 measured by @xcite is @xmath13.6  kev .",
    "this is the same hard - component temperature we found for the nuclear starburst region in ngc  2903 .",

    "following the notation of @xcite , we define the thermalization efficiency , @xmath120 , as the fraction of mechanical energy from star formation that is imparted to ( heats ) the surrounding gas ( the remainder is lost radiatively ) and the mass - loading factor , @xmath121 , as the ratio of the total mass of heated gas to the mass directly ejected by supernovae and stellar winds .",

    "this implies the hot wind fluid present in the nuclear region of ngc  2903  dominates the energetics of the flow as is implicit in the original @xcite model on which the work of strickland & heckman ( 2009 ) is based .",

    "there is soft diffuse x - ray emission with characteristic temperature 0.2@xmath70.6  kev extending beyond the central starburst with a morphology that does not closely match the underlying structures seen at other wavelengths (  [ sec : multi ] ) .",
    "much of this gas probably originated from supernovae and stellar winds from massive young stars distributed throughout the stellar disk of ngc  2903 .",
    "its relatively soft spectrum is likely due to dilution of hotter gas by thermal evaporation of surrounding cold ism as in the standard model for the formation of interstellar bubbles @xcite .",
    "however , a portion of this soft x - ray emission may come from a galactic wind , also diluted through mass - loading and further cooled by adiabatic expansion , but lying above the disk of the galaxy .",
    "based on the thermodynamic maps analyzed in ",
    "[ sec : tmaps ] , the soft diffuse x - ray emission can be divided into three distinctive zones , the nuclear , west and east zones .",
    "we note that the hydrogen column density is lower in the west than in the east zone and lowest in the nuclear zone .",
    "this may suggest the geometry of the hot gas : in the nuclear zone , the gas extends into the lower density halo .",
    "the gas in the east zone is mostly confined to within the disk . because the galaxy is tilted so that the east side is closest to us , any emission from a galactic wind along a line of sight through the east zone would be attenuated by the disk giving the higher @xmath19  value .",
    "conversely , the hot gas observed along lines of sight through the west zone is likely either ( also ) from the disk or from the wind located above the disk resulting in a relatively lower absorption column density .",
    "this geometry naturally also explains the higher x - ray surface brightness to the west ( figure  [ f : xdiff ] ) but does not easily explain the observed hot gas morphology ; the shape of the soft diffuse x - ray emission does not approximate the bi - conical outflow seen in m82 , for instance .    in any case , the x - ray ccd data alone do not give accurate kinematic information of hot gas .",
    "the kinematics of an outflowing gas can be obtained from high - resolution spectroscopic measurements of warm ionized gas .",
    "in fact , @xcite argue that h@xmath121 line structures and properties measured from some nuclear star clusters are akin to those of h@xmath16  emission in ngc  1569 investigated by @xcite who concluded that these features are indicative of an outflow . mapping the warm ionized gas in the central region of ngc  2903 will constrain whether or not the hot gas is escaping from the galaxy .",
    "there is no compact source detected coincident with the position of the mass center in ngc  2903 .",
    "this is consistent with the lack of any agn signature visible at other wavelengths .",
    "we place an upper limit of @xmath202 = ( 1@xmath72 ) @xmath510@xmath6  erg  s@xmath3 to any undetected point - like nuclear source .",
    "we can infer the mass of the central object from the @xmath203 relation @xcite .",
    "the observed stellar velocity dispersion in the nuclear region of ngc  2903 listed in the hyperleda database @xcite is 101.1@xmath266.8  km  s@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "this implies a black hole mass of 10@xmath11710@xmath119  @xmath101   @xcite .",
    "therefore , we take 10@xmath119  @xmath101   as an upper limit to the mass of the nucleus .",

    "we emphasize that this accretion rate only accounts for accretion of the hot phase of gas in the nuclear region .",
    "we define the dimensionless accretion parameter , @xmath206 , as @xmath207 , where @xmath208 is the accretion rate and @xmath209 is the accretion rate that would produce the eddington luminosity in a radiatively efficient case . for the ngc  2903 nucleus ,",
    "we obtain @xmath206 = 2@xmath510@xmath210 . in such low radiative efficiency regime , accretion is likely to be advection dominated . from the self - similar solution of @xcite ,",
    "the bolometric luminosity is estimated as @xmath211 , where @xmath212 is the radiative efficiency .",

    "the predicted x - ray luminosity can be a factor of 10 lower than the bolometric luminosity for a supermassive black hole @xcite , resulting in @xmath21510@xmath216  erg  s@xmath3 .",
    "a similar @xmath217 value is also obtained from the @xmath217@xmath206 relation derived by @xcite for advection models ( taking into account that the alternative definition of @xmath218 is used in their paper . )",
    "the hot gas component alone can only provide enough accretion to produce @xmath21510@xmath216  erg  s@xmath3 .",
    "in general , nuclear black holes in nuclear starburst galaxies are much more active than in ngc  2903 because cold gas is also accreted onto the black hole .",
    "there is a tight correlation between nuclear sfr and black hole accretion rate ( bhar ) found in seyfert galaxies @xcite .",
    "the sfr - bhar suggests that external cold gas triggers star formation and agns or nuclear star formation fuels subsequent agn activity .",
    "the sfr measured from hydrogen recombination lines in the central 15  ( 650  pc ) region in ngc  2903  is 0.7  @xmath101  yr@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "for such an sfr , we would expect @xmath208 @xmath1 0.010.1  @xmath101  yr@xmath3 for the seyfert galaxies studied by @xcite because the sfr corresponds to a cold gas inflow @xmath208 .",
    "however , given the upper limit to the x - ray luminosity , the cold gas @xmath208 in ngc  2903 must be much lower , @xmath21910@xmath220  @xmath101  yr@xmath3 , and is inconsistent with the sfr - bhar correlation , even considering systematic uncertainties among different methods to derive sfrs and accretion rates .    @xcite estimated an h@xmath221 mass of 1.8@xmath510@xmath222  @xmath101 , corresponding to a surface density of 160  @xmath101  pc@xmath223 in the nuclear region of ngc  2903 .",
    "moreover , the recent high resolution co image shows a gas structure swirling into the center ( p .- y .",
    "hsieh , private communication ) .",
    "therefore , there is enough material available in the central region to accrete on to a central massive object in ngc  2903 .",
    "we point out that only a small fraction ( @xmath1 10% ) of gas fueling nuclear sfr is needed in order to trigger a nuclear activity as luminous as in seyfert galaxies . in ngc  2903 ,",
    "the 10% of cold gas inflow may be also consumed in the nuclear starburst , heated by massive stars and supernovae , and/or ejected in a galactic outflow .",

    "we note that estimating flux using individual response and effective area files for each source gives more accurate value .",
    "however , pimms estimation is reasonable here due to low s / n for the most of sources ; therefore , the statistical uncertainties are larger than the systematic uncertainties due to differences in the response matrices implemented in pimms than those of the actual observation .    here , the x - ray spectra of the five highest - count sources are analyzed .",
