    "the most important galactic calibrators for the cepheid period - luminosity ( pl ) relation are long - period pulsators , which are less frequently found in open clusters than their short - period cousins ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "such objects are massive and young enough , however , to belong to older portions of ob associations , which can often be delineated by photometric or spectroscopic methods .",
    "that philosophy initiated a program by sidney van den bergh thirty years ago to identify associated young b - type stars in the vicinity of bright southern hemisphere long - period cepheids @xcite , with offshoots involving studies of potential coincidences of long - period cepheids with open clusters @xcite .",
    "the present study involves the 29@xmath4.97 cepheid aq puppis ( @xmath19 , @xmath20 ) , which presents unique complications arising from the high degree of differential reddening by interstellar dust along its line of sight .",
    "the rediscovery of cepheids in galactic open clusters by irwin in 1955 @xcite was accompanied by additional , independent searches for cepheid - cluster coincidences @xcite .",
    "a later study by @xcite with an updated cluster database revealed the spatial coincidence of aq pup with the coronal region of the cluster ruprecht 43 , but without further follow - up , possibly because of an uncertain nature for the cluster .",
    "a possible association of aq pup with pup ob2 at @xmath21 kpc was studied by @xcite , but without definitive conclusions .",
    "@xcite took a more positive view of the same data while revising the distance of pup ob2 to 2.9 kpc , subsequently confirmed by @xcite . an alternate possibility for an association of aq pup with pup ob1 at @xmath22 kpc",
    "was suggested by @xcite , although @xcite argued that the cepheid appeared unlikely to be a member of either association .",
    "star counts in the immediate vicinity of the cepheid did reveal a slight density enhancement ( turner , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , suggesting the possibility that the region near aq pup might contain the sparse remains of an uncatalogued open cluster or association , now designated as turner 12 @xcite . a preliminary assessment @xcite designated the group as pup ob3 , for lack of a more definitive term .",
    "the present photometric survey of the field explores the preliminary findings further to reveal the possible open cluster connection that exists .",
    "subsequent to the original data collection and measurement an additional cepheid was found to lie in the survey field , the @xmath23.59 cepheid v620 puppis ( @xmath24 , @xmath25 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , originally nsv 03832 but recognized as a classical cepheid from the asas-3 survey @xcite . by happy circumstance v620 pup appears to lie in a previously unrecognized sparse open cluster , so is itself a potential calibrator for the short - period end of the pl relation .",
    "the present study also discusses the independent case for its cluster membership .",
    "there is another long - period cepheid in the region of aq pup , namely the 14@xmath4.15 variable ls pup .",
    "however , it falls just west of the surveyed region , so is not discussed here .",
    "this is the final study in a series that was initially based on photographic photometry tied to skeleton photoelectric sequences .",
    "it has been a very large project that has by necessity extended over a number of decades . for the sake of homogeneity",
    "it was necessary to use the same techniques ( e.g. , iris photometry ) for all program fields , although there have been improvements to the original methodology , such as incorporating additional photoelectric standards , refining the iris photometry techniques to improve the precision of the results , and completing more comprehensive analyses of interstellar reddening , particularly differential reddening , which has been ubiquitous in all survey fields .",
    "the introduction of ccd detectors in the intervening years has changed the nature of photometric surveys .",
    "greater precision could be achieved at present through use of a ccd detector , although mosaicing would be needed to cover the fields studied .",
    "accurate corrections for the effects of interstellar reddening is also best achieved using _ ubv _ photometry , which can be a challenge to achieve with the panchromatic response of most ccd devices ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in the end",
    "what counts is the result obtained , not the technique used , as the present study demonstrates .",
    "the data for the present study include photoelectric _ ubv _ photometry of 14 stars in the field of aq pup from observations obtained with the cerro tololo 1.5-m telescope in march 1979 and the university of toronto s helen sawyer hogg 0.6-m telescope in march 1976 and january 1987 , when it was located on cerro las campanas , chile .",

    "a small proportion of stars in the aq pup field are unreddened late - type stars ; none are o - type stars . however , there are many b - type , a - type , and f - type stars of various reddenings present throughout the region .",

    "that is consistent with what was found previously by @xcite and @xcite for distances to the dust clouds in this direction .",
    "it appears that the galactic plane along the line of sight is relatively dust - free for about 1.8 kiloparsecs , beyond which varied and occasionally substantial extinction arises .    the small density enhancement of stars denoted as turner  12 at the center of the survey field of fig .

    "if the stars are post main - sequence objects rather than dwarfs , then they must have luminosities of bright giants or supergiants if reddened by extinction arising in the main dust complex 1.8 kpc distant .",

    "[ fig8 ] for an intrinsic distance modulus of @xmath50 derived for 6 stars that appear to lie on the zams .",
    "there is a reasonably good fit of the data to a model isochrone for @xmath51 taken from @xcite .",
    "the implied distance of @xmath15 kpc requires confirmation from a deeper survey , and might be too small .",
    "the reality of the cluster , designated here as turner  13 , also needs to be confirmed by star counts and radial velocities .",
    "the field immediately surrounding v620 pup does appear to contain an above average number of faint , reddened , blue stars , despite the relatively high reddening for the cluster , and that and the data of fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] are presently the only evidence for the cluster s existence .",
    "two of the red stars near the cepheid may be red giant ( gk - type ) members of the cluster .",
    "they fit the @xmath52 isochrone reasonably well .",
    "the mean reddening of stars lying close to v620 pup is @xmath14 s.e . , which corresponds to a field reddening for the cepheid of @xmath13 .",

    "[ fig9 ] for the distance modulus derived in fig .",
    "although differential reddening is very clearly present in the region of this group of stars , designated here as turner  14 , the mean reddening of stars near the cluster core is @xmath54 s.e .",
    "the reality of the cluster is indicated by an increase in the density of faint blue stars in the core regions of turner  14 , despite a rather large reddening .",
    "the identification of possible cluster members on the basis solely of reddening and location in the color - magnitude diagram of fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] is difficult .",
    "the large apparent redward spread in the evolved portion of the cluster main sequence is an effect seen in other intermediate - age clusters ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and may have a similar explanation in terms of circumstellar reddening for stars of large rotational velocity .    additional members of turner  14 can be found in the region surrounding aq pup , as shown in fig .",
    "the identification of several of the stars as potential cluster members is motivated by the possibility that rapid rotation is inherent to many stars on the cluster main sequence .",
    "if that is incorrect , then 67 of the stars could be removed from the sample as likely foreground dwarfs . as noted in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , the mean reddening of stars lying within @xmath55 of aq pup is @xmath6 s.e . ,",
    "equivalent to a space reddening for the cepheid of @xmath5 .",
    "differential reddening is quite strong near the cepheid and accounts for the large uncertainty in the results . the data for possible cluster members identified in fig .",

    "in a simulation of period changes for long - period cepheids tied to stellar evolutionary models , @xcite argues , from only 5 observed times of light maximum , that the period of aq pup does not appear to be changing .",
    "such a conclusion emphasizes the importance of studying cepheid period changes observationally using lengthy and rich temporal samples of light curve data .",
    "period changes for aq pup were established here from examination of archival photographic plates of the variable in the collection of the harvard college observatory , as well as from an analysis of new and existing photometry for the star .",
    "a working ephemeris for aq pup based upon the available data was : @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the number of elapsed cycles .",
    "an extensive analysis of all available observations produced the data summarized in table  [ tab3 ] , which lists results for 79 different epochs of light maximum derived from the complete light curves using hertzsprung s method @xcite , the type of data analyzed ( pg = photographic , vis = visual telescopic observations , b = photoelectric _ b _ , and v = photoelectric _ v _ ) , the number of observations used to establish the observed light maxima , and the source of the observations , in addition to the temporal parameters .",

    "[ fig10 ] .",
    "the parabolic trend corresponds to a rapid period increase of @xmath62 s yr@xmath12 , a value representative of the most rapid rate of period increase for cepheids of comparable pulsation period .    in their study of cepheid period changes",
    ", @xcite noted that the observed rates of period change were consistent with predictions from evolutionary models for stars in the first , second ( period decreases ) , and third crossing of the instability strip , despite a wide range in predicted rates .",
    "the observed rates for the luminous , long - period variables also exhibited a smaller dispersion than that derived from various published models , and it was speculated that the cepheid sample was dominated by stars in the second and third crossings of the strip , which are the slowest . some older models , such as those of @xcite for example , predicted fourth and fifth crossings for stars in the thick helium - burning shell phase , which occurs at a more rapid rate than second and third crossings for stars of the same mass . @xcite therefore speculated that the main sample of cepheids consisted of second and third crossers , with a smaller group of putative fourth and fifth crossers exhibiting period changes at rates an order of magnitude larger than those of other cepheids of similar period .",
    "as indicated in fig .",

    "possibly there was an error in the original coordinates cited for the cluster ?",
    "there is also an overlooked faint cluster of stars located closer to aq pup at j2000.0 coordinates 07:59:19 , 28:58:00 , designated here as turner - majaess  1 .",

    "they were not derived using best - fitting procedures , although it is noteworthy that the data for both clusters are a reasonably good match to the adopted values .",
    "such good agreement argues that ruprecht 43 and turner - majaess  1 probably lie at roughly the same distance as aq pup and turner  14 , suggesting that they belong to the same star complex .",
    "deeper photometry is required to explore that conclusion further .",
    "absolute magnitudes have been derived for aq pup and v620 pup under the assumption that they are members of the clusters in their vicinity .",
    "the case for aq pup seems reasonably strong , and the cepheid appears to be in the third or possibly fifth crossing of the instability strip . its rapid rate of period increase might also be indicative of rapid mass loss . v620 pup is curious , given that the cluster match implies it is in the first crossing of the instability strip .",
    "but it has completely different characteristics from other putative first - crossers @xcite , with a very skewed light curve and a sizeable light amplitude of @xmath96 , more like that of second or third crossers . further study of the cepheid and the cluster surrounding it appears to be essential .",

    "<S> a photometric _ ubv _ survey is presented for 610 stars in a region surrounding the cepheid aq puppis and centered southwest of the variable , based upon photoelectric measures for 14 stars and calibrated iris photometry of photographic plates of the field for 596 stars . </S>",
    "<S> an analysis of reddening and distance for program stars indicates that the major dust complex in this direction is @xmath0 kpc distant , producing differential extinction described by a ratio of total - to - selective extinction of @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> zero - age main - sequence fitting for the main group of b - type stars along the line of sight yields a distance of @xmath2 kpc ( @xmath3 s.e . ) . </S>",
    "<S> the 29@xmath4.97 cepheid aq pup , of field reddening @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) , appears to be associated with b - type stars lying within @xmath7 of it as well as with a sparse group of stars , designated turner  14 , centered south of it at j2000.0 = 07:58:37 , 29:25:00 , with a mean reddening of @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> aq pup has an inferred luminosity as a cluster member of @xmath9 and an evolutionary age of @xmath10 yr . </S>",
    "<S> its observed rate of period increase of @xmath11 s yr@xmath12 is an order of magnitude larger than what is observed for cepheids of comparable period in the third crossing of the instability strip , and may be indicative of a high rate of mass loss or a putative fifth crossing . </S>",
    "<S> another sparse cluster , designated turner  13 , surrounds the newly - recognized 2@xmath4.59 cepheid v620 pup , of space reddening @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) , distance @xmath15 kpc ( @xmath16 s.e . ) , evolutionary age @xmath17 yr , and an inferred luminosity as a likely cluster member of @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> v620 pup is tentatively identified as a first crosser , pending additional observations . </S>"
