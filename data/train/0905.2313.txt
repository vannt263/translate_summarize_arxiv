    "the theory of random matrices is a field of its own , but whenever it comes to applications , the driving idea is almost always that although it is very difficult to exhibit matrices having specified properties , a suitably chosen random matrix will have very similar properties as the original matrix with a high probability .",
    "this idea has been used successfully for example in operator algebra with the theory of free probability .    in 2007 for the first time , a similar leitmotiv was used with success by hayden in @xcite and hayden - winter in @xcite to disprove the rnyi entropy additivity conjecture for a wide class of parameters @xmath0 . a proof for the most important case @xmath1 was even announced by hastings in @xcite with probabilistic arguments of different nature .",
    "this is arguably the most important conjecture in quantum information theory , and the random matrix models introduced by hayden and their modifications due to hastings seemed very new from our random matrix points of view .",
    "this paper is therefore an attempt to understand these matrix models with random matrix techniques . for this purpose",
    ", we introduce a formalism that is very close to that of planar algebras of jones @xcite , and we suggest that the language of quantum gates and planar algebras should be considered as very closely related to each other .    our paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : weingarten ] we recall known facts about integration over unitary groups and their large dimension asymptotics .",
    "this is nowadays known as weingarten calculus . in section [ sec : graphic - model ] , we introduce a graphical model to represent ( random ) matrices arising in random quantum calculus .",
    "section [ sec : planar - expansion ] gives a theoretical method for computing expectations with our graphical model and in the last two sections we give explicit applications of these techniques to random quantum channels .",
    "more precisely , in section [ sec : product_independent ] we investigate tensor products of two independent quantum channels and in section [ sec : product_conjugate ] we look at a product of a random channel @xmath2 with the channel @xmath3 defined by the conjugate unitary @xmath4 .    limit theorems presented in this paper are just a sample of what we can be accomplished with the calculus developed in section [ sec : planar - expansion ] .",
    "new results will be given in the forthcoming papers @xcite .",
    "this section contains some basic material on unitary integration and weingarten calculus .",
    "a more complete exposition of these matters can be found in @xcite .",
    "we start with the definition of the weingarten function .",
    "the unitary weingarten function @xmath5 is a function of a dimension parameter @xmath6 and of a permutation @xmath7 in the symmetric group @xmath8 .",
    "it is the inverse of the function @xmath9 under the convolution for the symmetric group ( @xmath10 denotes the number of cycles of the permutation @xmath7 ) .",
    "notice that the function @xmath11 is invertible as @xmath6 is large , as it behaves like @xmath12 as @xmath13 .",
    "if @xmath14 the function is not invertible any more , but we can keep this definition by taking the pseudo inverse and the theorems below will still hold true ( we refer to @xcite for historical references and further details ) . we shall use the shorthand notation @xmath15 when the dimension parameter @xmath6 is obvious .",
    "the function @xmath16 is used to compute integrals with respect to the haar measure on the unitary group ( we shall denote by @xmath17 the unitary group acting on an @xmath6-dimensional hilbert space ) .",
    "the first theorem is as follows :    [ thm : wg ] let @xmath6 be a positive integer and @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 be @xmath0-tuples of positive integers from @xmath22 . then @xmath23    if @xmath24 then @xmath25    since we shall perform integration over large unitary groups , we are interested in the values of the weingarten function in the limit @xmath26 .",
    "the following result encloses all the data we need for our computations about the asymptotics of the @xmath16 function ; see @xcite for a proof .",
    "[ thm : mob ] for a permutation @xmath27 , let @xmath28 denote the set of cycles of @xmath7",
    ". then @xmath29 and @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the @xmath32-th catalan number .",
    "a shorthand for this theorem is the introduction of a function @xmath33 on the symmetric group , invariant under conjugation and multiplicative over the cycles , satisfying for any permutation @xmath27 : @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the _ length _ of @xmath7 , i.e. the minimal number of transpositions that multiply to @xmath7 .",
    "we refer to @xcite for details about the function @xmath33 .",
    "we finish this section by a well known lemma which we will use several times towards the end of the paper .",
    "this result is contained in @xcite .",
    "[ lem : s_p ] the function @xmath36 is an integer valued distance on @xmath8 . besides , it has the following properties :    * the diameter of @xmath8 is @xmath37 ; * @xmath38 is left and right translation invariant ; * for three permutations @xmath39 , the quantity @xmath40 has the same parity as @xmath41 ; * the set of geodesic points between the identity permutation @xmath42 and some permutation @xmath27 is in bijection with the set of non - crossing partitions smaller than @xmath43 , where the partition @xmath43 encodes the cycle structure of @xmath7 .",
    "moreover , the preceding bijection preserves the lattice structure .",
    "we end this section by the following definition which generalizes the trace function .",
    "for some matrices @xmath44 and some permutation @xmath27 , we define @xmath45 we also put @xmath46 .      in quantum information theory ,",
    "quantum channel _ is the most general transformation of a quantum system .",
    "quantum channels generalize the unitary evolution of isolated quantum systems to _ open quantum systems_. mathematically , we recall that a quantum channel is a linear completely positive trace preserving map @xmath47 from @xmath48 to itself .",
    "the trace preservation condition is necessary since quantum channels should map density matrices to density matrices .",
    "the complete positivity condition can be stated as @xmath49    the following two characterizations of quantum channels turn out to be very useful .",

    "a similar result holds for the number of kraus operators : one can always find a decomposition with @xmath61 operators .    in the final two sections of the paper we study a model of _ random quantum channels _ originating from the stinespring dilation formula ( [ eq : stinespring_form ] ) .",
    "we shall be interested in the spectral properties of the elements in the image of such random channels .",
    "quantum channels will be the main field of application of the graphical calculus we develop in the next two sections , our aim being the treatment of some additivity problems in quantum information theory .",
    "in this section , we lay out the foundation for the graphical calculus we shall develop later . we introduce a graphical formalism for representing tensors and tensor contractions that is adapted to quantum information theory .",
    "we start at an abstract level , with a purely diagrammatic axiomatization and then we study the hilbert representations , where graph - theoretic objects shall be associated with concrete elements of hilbert spaces .",
    "our starting point is a set @xmath62 endowed with an involution without fixed point @xmath63 .",
    "the set @xmath62 splits as @xmath64 according to the involution .",
    "elements of @xmath62 are called _",
    "decorations_.    a _ diagram _ is a collection of decorated _ boxes _ and possibly _ wires _ ( or strings ) connecting the boxes along their decorations according to rules which we shall specify . in terms of graph theory ,",
    "a diagram is an unoriented ( multi-)graph whose vertices are boxes , and whose edges are strings .",
    "each vertex comes with a ( possibly empty ) @xmath6-tuple of indices ( or decorations or labels ) in @xmath65 .",

    "each decoration is thought as having potentially up to two _",
    "attachment points_. an _ inner _ one ( which is attached to the box it belongs to ) and an _ outer _ one , which we shall allow to be attached to a string later on .    ]",
    "given a family of existing diagrams ( e.g. boxes ) there exists several ways of creating new diagrams .    1",
    ".   one can put diagrams together , i.e. take their disjoint union ( when it comes to taking representations in hilbert spaces , this operation will amount to tensoring ) .",
    "one diagram can be viewed as a box .",

    "this axiom and the previous one ( together with evident relations such as @xmath77 which we do nt enumerate in detail ) endow the set of identically decorated diagrams with a structure of a complex vector space .",
    "4 .   one can add _ wires _ to an existing diagram ( or between two diagrams that have been put together ) .",
    "a wire is allowed between the outer attachment of two decorations only if the decorations have the same shape and different shadings .",
    "such a wire can be created if and only if the two candidate decorations have their outer attachments unoccupied .",
    "there exists an anti - linear _ involution _ on the diagrams , denoted by @xmath63 .",
    "this operation does nothing on the wires . on the boxes",
    ", it reverts the shading of the decorations .",
    "the involution @xmath63 is conjugate linear .",
    "we shall now consider a concrete representation of the diagrams introduced above as tensors in hilbert spaces .",
    "we start by assuming that the set @xmath71 of full ( or black ) decorations corresponds to a collection of finite dimensional hilbert spaces @xmath78 .",
    "an important fact that will be useful later is that each hilbert space @xmath79 comes equipped with an orthonormal basis @xmath80 .",
    "our aim is to define a @xmath63-linear map @xmath81 between the diagrams and tensors in products of hilbert spaces in the above class and their duals . by duality",
    ", white decorations correspond to dual spaces @xmath82 . with these conventions ,",
    "boxes can be seen as tensors whose legs belong to the vector spaces corresponding to its decorations . in a diagram ,",
    "symbols of the same shape denote isomorphic spaces , but the converse may be false .",
    "a particular space @xmath79 ( or @xmath83 ) can appear several times in a box .",
    "the reader acquainted with quantum mechanics might think of white shapes as corresponding to ` bras ' and black shapes corresponding to ` kets ' , but we shall get back to quantum mechanical notions later .    to a box @xmath66",

    "our calculus is mainly inspired by bob coecke s _ kindergarten quantum mechanics _",
    "however we choose not to orient the strings ; rather , we separate with color ( black / white ) the vector spaces and their duals , therefore there is only one possible pairing .",
    "a common feature of the two calculi is the central place occupied in the formalisms by bell states .",
    "jones s theory of planar algebras @xcite is also connected to our graphical calculus .",
    "one of our diagrammatic axioms is the existence of a bell state .",
    "this is very closely related to the axioms of temperley lieb algebras and the diagrammatic for a jones projection .",
    "most of our calculus could take place in jones _ bipartite graph planar algebra_.",
    "in this section , we consider diagrams that may contain random matrices .",
    "this is where probability theory comes into play ; we focus on the case where the random elements appearing in the diagrams are random unitary haar - distributed on some finite dimensional unitary group .",
    "our task is to compute expectation values @xmath138 of diagrams @xmath95 containing boxes associated with random unitary operations .",
    "we shall write @xmath138 as a weighted sum of some diagrams obtained from @xmath95 that to not contain anymore random tensors .",
    "suppose we have a diagram @xmath95 that has boxes of two types : either boxes of type @xmath114 , @xmath139 , @xmath140 or @xmath141 where @xmath114 is a unitary random variables in a fixed space of type @xmath142 , distributed according to the haar measure on the unitary group @xmath17 on this space , or other boxes which are independent ( as classical random variables ) from @xmath114 ( this includes deterministic boxes or tensors ) .",
    "we shall now present an algorithm for computing the expectation of such a diagram with respect to the probability law of @xmath114 . before describing the algorithm ,",
    "let us note that if a diagram contains several _ independent _ haar unitary matrices , one can recursively apply the algorithm to compute the expectation over all the random unitary matrices appearing in the diagram .",
    "the first step in our algorithm is to ensure that @xmath95 contains only boxes of type @xmath114 and @xmath143 .",
    "this can be done by using the transposition transformation via bell states , and replacing @xmath141 boxes by @xmath114 boxes with the opposite shading of the decorations and @xmath139 boxes by @xmath4 boxes .",
    "next , we introduce a concept of _ removal _ of boxes @xmath114 and @xmath4 . a removal @xmath144 is a procedure which transforms a diagram @xmath95 into a new diagram @xmath145 which does not contain neither @xmath114 nor @xmath4 boxes . in other words , @xmath144 is a way to remove random unitaries @xmath114 from a diagram @xmath95 .",

    "[ thm : wg_diag ] the following holds true : @xmath157",

    "one can check directly that the order of the induction does not change the final result .",

    "the purpose of such a substitution is purely practical : later in the removal procedure , we pair decorations of _ the same color_. if we should have decided to work with @xmath114 and @xmath139 boxes , one should always pair decorations of different colors , and this can turn out to be rather cumbersome when doing combinatorics . on the other hand , each time we replace a @xmath139 box by a @xmath4 box , we introduce two more bell states into our diagram ( see figure [ fig : bell_transposition ] ) ; although we decided not to display such states and rather to allow wires connecting decorations of the same color , this operation increases in some sense the `` complexity '' of the diagram .    in the next sub - section we present a warm - up toy example of theorem [ thm : wg_diag ] .",

    "independently on the choice of @xmath360 and @xmath55 , the value that we obtain almost surely for the largest eigenvalue in theorem [ thm : product - channel ] improves strictly the lower bound for the largest eigenvalue obtained in lemma [ lem : hayden ] , as @xmath372 .    for fixed @xmath360 ,",
    "the relative improvement @xmath373 becomes small as @xmath55 becomes big . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath374 , the lemma [ lem : hayden ] does not bring new information , as the largest eigenvalue is always at least @xmath375 , whereas theorem [ thm : product - channel ] brings new information .",
    "so , the relative improvement is optimal for @xmath376 .",
    "this heuristic study leads us to think that it is possible to improve known counterexamples about the various entropy additivity conjectures , and this is the object of study of our second paper @xcite .",

    "<S> we develop a graphical tool that allows us to compute the expected moments of the output of a random quantum channel .    as an application , we study variations of random matrix models introduced by hayden @xcite , and show that their eigenvalues converge almost surely .    in particular we obtain for some models sharp improvements on the value of the largest eigenvalue , and this is shown in a further work to have new applications to minimal output entropy inequalities . </S>"
