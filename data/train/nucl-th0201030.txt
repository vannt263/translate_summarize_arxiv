    "a detailed description of the familiar ( isovector , @xmath5 ) giant dipole resonance in medium - heavy mass nuclei is a long - standing theoretical problem .",
    "a number of macroscopical , semiclassical and microscopical approaches have been used to describe the photoabsorption cross section , the latter being proportional to the energy - weighted isovector dipole strength function @xcite .",
    "crpa - based microscopical approaches have been developed during the last two decades to describe the e1 strength function @xcite@xcite . however ,",
    "partial photonucleon reactions accompanied by the gdr excitation have not been studied in these approaches .",
    "experimental data on these reactions ( mainly on the neutron radiative capture ) are usually described within the dsd - model ( the model of direct+semidirect capture ) .",
    "the model was originally proposed by brown  @xcite and substantially extended by the lublyana group ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) . within the model",
    "a number of phenomenological quantities are used to parameterize the energy - averaged reaction - amplitude and , in particular , a rather large imaginary part of the gdr form factor is used without a clear physical understanding of the origin of this part .",
    "partial photonuclear reactions accompanied by gdr excitation are closely related to gdr direct decay into the respective nucleon channels and carry information on the gdr structure .",
    "therefore , the crpa - based microscopical approaches , which are able to describe direct nucleon decays of the gdr ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) , can be extended to describe the partial photonucleon reactions .",
    "an attempt to use the crpa - based semimicroscopical approach to describe partial photonucleon reactions accompanied by the gdr excitation was undertaken in ref .",
    "@xcite . later the approach was extended and applied by urin and coworkers for describing the direct - nucleon - decay properties of a number of charge - exchange ( isovector ) and isoscalar giant resonances ( see refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite , respectively ) .",
    "the ingredients of the semimicroscopical approach are the following :    * the phenomenological isoscalar part of the nuclear mean field ( including the spin - orbit term ) and the momentum - independent landau - migdal particle - hole interaction , together with some partial self - consistency conditions ; * a phenomenological account for the spreading effect ( that is due to coupling of particle - hole - type doorway states to many - quasiparticle configurations ) in terms of an energy - dependent smearing parameter .",
    "however , it was found in ref .",
    "@xcite that the gdr energy and also the photoabsorption cross section integrated over the gdr region , @xmath6 , are noticeably underestimated in the calculations as compared with the respective experimental values  @xcite .",
    "the experimental value of @xmath6 , which exceeds the trk sum rule , @xmath7 mev@xmath8 mb , can be reproduced in selfconsistent calculations provided momentum - dependent forces are taken into account . in ref .",
    "@xcite we provided a satisfactory description of the experimental gdr energy in @xmath3pb and some partial @xmath3pb@xmath0-reaction cross sections in the gdr region by incorporating separable isovector momentum - dependent forces with the intensity normalized to describe the experimental @xmath6 value and without the use of additional adjustable parameters .    in the present work",
    "we extend the approach of ref .  @xcite as follows .",
    "first , we use a simplier phenomenological realization for the spreading effect by introducing an energy - dependent smearing parameter directly into the crpa equations .",
    "secondly , we take into consideration also the isoscalar part of momentum - dependent forces in terms of an effective nucleon mass .",
    "thirdly , the photonucleon - reaction cross sections are calculated for a number of nuclei and the results are compared with available experimental data .",
    "we make also predictions for several partial @xmath9-reaction cross sections in the vicinity of the gdr in @xmath3pb and , consequently , calculate partial direct - neutron decay branching ratios for this gr .",
    "the total branching ratio is also evaluated for the gdr in @xmath10 and compared with recent @xmath11-reaction data @xcite .",
    "the crpa equations are given below in the form adopted from the migdal s finite- fermi - system theory  @xcite .",
    "similar to refs .",
    "@xcite,@xcite , the isobaric structure of the gdr can be simplified by using the quantity @xmath12 , with @xmath13 as the z - projection of the dipole operator in the limit @xmath14 .",
    "the photoabsorption cross section , @xmath15 ( @xmath16 is the gamma - quantum energy ) , is then proportional to the dipole strength function @xmath17 : @xmath18 with @xmath19  . within the crpa the strength function",
    "is determined by the effective dipole operator @xmath20 , which differs from @xmath21 due to polarization effects caused by the particle - hole interaction @xmath22 .",
    "together with the momentum - independent isovector part of the landau - migdal interaction , @xmath23 , we also use translationally invariant separable momentum - dependent forces : @xmath24 where , @xmath25 is the nucleon mass , @xmath26 is the number of nucleons , and @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the isoscalar and isovector strengths of the momentum - dependent forces , respectively . the approximate equality in eq .",
