    "= 12 cm    statistical analysis of clusters and groups of galaxies are among the most powerful tools for the study of large scale structure . in the hierarchical clustering scenario , these objects form by the gravitational amplification of primordial density fluctuations , so that they can be used to characterize the spatial distribution of the peaks of the density field .",
    "besides , as they are the largest gravitationally bound objects and span a wide range of masses , they can be used as laboratories to determine the role of the different astrophysical processes that govern galaxy formation .    the first statistical analysis on this type of objects where based on cluster catalogues constructed by visual identification ( abell , 1958 ; abell , olowin & corwin , 1989 ) .",
    "the cluster - cluster correlation function @xmath8 has been the preferred tool for such analysis , providing a simple and convenient statistical tool to characterize their spatial distribution and place constraints on cosmological models ( bahcall & soneira 1983 ; klypin & kopylov 1983 ; peacock & west 1992 ; postman , huchra & geller 1992 ) . nonetheless , clear evidence of inhomogeneities and line - of - sight projection effects was found ( lucey 1983 ; sutherland 1988 ) , which where responsible for part of the observed amplitude of the angular correlation .",
    "the situation improved with digitized cluster surveys like the edinburgh / durham cluster catalogue ( nichol et al .",
    "1992 ) and the apm survey ( dalton et al 1992 , 1994 ; croft et al 1997 ) .",
    "although these where more homogeneous , systematics due to projection effects are inherent to cluster identification based on angular positions in the sky ( padilla & lambas , 2003 ) .    in recent years , x - ray information has been used to construct new cluster samples .",
    "this method of identification has several advantages with respect to the use of optical data .",
    "the x - ray emission is a strong signature of a gravitational potential well since there is a strong relation between the x - ray luminosity @xmath1 and mass ( reiprich & bhringer 2002 ) .",
    "besides the emissivity of thermal bremsstrahlung radiation is proportional to the square of the electron density thus it provides clear evidence of a mass concentration which is not strongly affected by projection effects .",
    "furthermore , the x - ray emission from the clusters is concentrated towards the dense central core giving an improved angular resolution compared to the one obtained using galaxy concentrations , also helping to reduce the possibility of projection effects .",
    "the rosat - eso flux limited x - ray ( reflex ) cluster survey ( bhringer et al . 2004 ) , comprising 447 objects , is the largest statistically complete x - ray selected sample .",
    "it has been previously used to analyse the large scale structure through its power spectrum ( schuecker et al . 2001 ) and its correlation function ( collins et al . , 2000 ) .",
    "although schuecker et al .",
    "( 2001 ) found a systematic increase of the amplitude of the power spectrum with limiting x - ray luminosity , collins et al .",
    "( 2001 ) results lack such a trend in the correlation function , characterized by an approximate power - law with correlation length @xmath9 .    on the other hand , since the advent of large galaxy redshift surveys a reliable identification of groups of galaxies has been possible using not only angular positions , but also the complete redshift information , avoiding in this way a strong contamination by projection effects .",
    "the first algorithms designed for this task where developed by huchra & geller ( 1982 ) and nolthenius & white ( 1987 ) .",
    "these methods where based on the friends - of - friends algorithm used in numerical simulations with a redshift dependent linking length parameter .",
    "a variety of group catalogues where constructed using this algorithms : merchn et al .",
    "( 2000 ) used the updated zwicky catalogue ( falco et al .",
    "1999 ) , giuricin et al .",

    "( 2000 ) extracted a group sample from the las campanas redshift survey ( shectman et al .",
    "1996 ) , and ramella et al .",
    "( 2002 ) used the information of the updated zwicky catalogue and the southern sky redshift survey ( da costa et al .",
    "recently , the 100k public data release of the 2df galaxy redshift survey ( 2dfgrs , colles et al .",
    "2001 ) has been used by merchn & zandivarez ( 2002 ) to construct one of the largest group catalogues using a slight modification of the huchra & geller ( 1982 ) algorithm .",
    "the large scale redshift space distribution of this sample has been studied by zandivarez , merchn & padilla ( 2003 ) .",
    "they showed that the redshift space correlation function has a power law behavior with a correlation length of @xmath10 .",
    "the cluster and group catalogues identified by x - ray information or three dimensional percolation algorithms , represent different types of objects . in order to be able to confront the results obtained for these samples with the predictions of theoretical models ,",
    "a complete understanding of the differences in the statistical properties of the samples is crucial .",
    "one of the most important possible comparisons is the analysis of the clustering of galaxies , selected in different wave - bands , around these objects and how it depends on the properties like x - ray luminosity or virial mass .",
    "the best statistical tool for such analysis is the two - point cluster - galaxy cross - correlation function @xmath0 , which is a measure of the mean radial density profile around clusters .",
    "the first measurement of this correlation function was performed by seldner & peebles ( 1977 ) , who studied the angular cross - correlation of abell clusters and lick galaxies .",
    "they found that @xmath0 was very large and positive out to scales as large as @xmath11 but they where contradicted by lilje & efstathiou ( 1988 ) who did not find any strong evidence of clustering beyond @xmath12 arguing that part of the signal detected by seldner & peebles ( 1977 ) was a consequence of artificial surface density gradients in the lick catalogue . at smaller scales ,",
    "lilje & efstathiou ( 1988 ) found that @xmath0 was well fitted by a power law with @xmath13 . later works ( dalton 1992 ; mo , peacock & xia 1993 ; moore et al .",
    "1994 ) found similar results based on direct measurements from redshift surveys of galaxies and clusters .",
    "they found that @xmath0 has a similar shape to @xmath14 and @xmath15 but with an amplitude approximately equal to their geometric mean .",
    "croft et al .",
    "( 1999 ) estimated @xmath0 in real and redshift - space from the apm galaxy and cluster surveys and found that its shape can not be described by a single power law and that its amplitude is almost independent of cluster richness and the limiting magnitude of galaxies .    in this paper we compute @xmath0 using a sample of groups derived from the final version of the 2dfgrs and the reflex cluster survey , and the galaxies from the 2mass ( skrutskie et al .",

    "3 we describe the method used to obtain the 3d real space cluster - galaxy cross - correlation function from the projected cross - correlation function . in ",

    "our data set was selected from the public full - sky extended source catalogue ( xsc ; jarret et al .",
    "2000 ) which contains over 1.1 million extended objects brighter than @xmath19mag .",
    "the raw magnitudes where corrected for galactic extinction using the ir reddening map of schlegel , finkbeiner & davis ( 1998 ) .",
    "there is a strong correlation between dust extinction and stellar density , which increases exponentially towards the galactic plane .",
    "stellar density is a contaminant factor of the xsc since the reliability of separating stars from extended sources is very sensitive to this quantity ( jarret et al . 2000 ) . in order to avoid contamination from stars",
    "we have constructed a mask for the 2mass survey using a @xmath20 ( gorski et al .",
    "1999 ) map with @xmath21 and excluding those pixels where the @xmath17 band extinction @xmath22 and @xmath23 which reduces galactic contaminant sources to @xmath24 ( maller et al . , 2003 ) .",
    "we also followed maller et al .",
    "( 2003 ) and imposed a cut at @xmath25 mag in the corrected magnitudes .",
    "figure 1 shows an aitoff projection of the final sample obtained with these restrictions , which contains 397447 galaxies .",
    "we also used information from the apm galaxy survey ( maddox et al .",
    "1990 ) , which is based on 185 uk iiia - j schmidt photographic plates each corresponding to a @xmath26 @xmath27 on the sky limited to @xmath28 and with a mean depth of @xmath29 for @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "we selected our galaxy sample from the apm survey imposing the cut @xmath32 . the sub - sample with @xmath33 is also shown in figure 1 .",
    "galaxy @xmath17 luminosity is less sensitive to dust and stellar populations than the @xmath34 band , providing a more uniform survey of the galaxy population .",
    "the @xmath17 band also gives a better measure of the stellar mass content than the @xmath34 band .",
    "then , the variations of the correlation function of samples selected in these bands can give us valuable information on the dependence of galaxy bias on the various properties of galaxies and then shed some light in their formation and evolution .",
    "in our analysis we used information of the rosat - eso x - ray flux limited ( reflex ) cluster survey ( bhringer et al . , 2004 ) .",
    "the geometry of the survey is described by the southern hemisphere with @xmath35 excluding the zone where @xmath36 and the small and the large magellanic clouds , covering an area of 4.24sr .",
    "the sample has a nominal flux limit of @xmath37 within the rosat energy band ( 0.1 - 2.4)kev and comprises 447 clusters .",
    "figure 1 shows an aitoff projection of the 422 clusters inside the 2mass mask described in section 2.1 .",
    "we also used a group catalogue ( hereafter the 2df galaxy group catalogue , 2dfggc ) constructed from the final version of the 2df galaxy redshift survey ( 2dfgrs , colless et al .",
    "2001 ) , using the same technique used by merchn & zandivarez ( 2002 ) to construct the group catalogue of the 2dfgrs 100k release ( folkes et al .",
    "this sample comprises 5568 groups for which virial mass , velocity dispersion and virial radius have been determined .",
    "these samples where determined using very different types of information .",
    "the strong relation between @xmath1 and @xmath38 ( see e.g. reiprich & bhringer , 2002 ) indicates that x - ray selected clusters samples are close to be basically selected by mass .",
    "the situation is very different for optically selected groups and clusters where the selection criteria is based on richness , which is not a good mass indicator .",
    "the study of the differences in the way in which galaxies cluster around them can be very important to improve our knowledge of this type of objects and to understand their overall statistical properties .",
    "figure 2 shows the redshift distribution of the samples analysed in this work .",
    "the distribution for 2mass galaxies was obtained by maller et al .",
    "( 2004 ) by matching it with sdss early data release ( stoughton et al . 2002 ) and the 2dfgrs 100k release ( colles et al .",
    "2001 ) . for apm galaxies we used the fit from baugh & efstathiou ( 1993 ) .",
    "it can be seen that the distribution for the reflex cluster survey peaks at approximately the same redshift as 2mass galaxies .",
    "as we measure the projected cross - correlation function ( see section 3 ) , the largest contribution to this function will come for cluster - galaxy pairs laying at similar redshifts , which enhances our signal , on the other hand the differences with the distribution of apm galaxies will cause a lower amplitude in the projected correlations .",
    "= 12 cm    the spatial cluster - galaxy cross - correlation function @xmath0 is defined so that the probability @xmath39 of finding a galaxy in the volume element @xmath40 at a distance @xmath41 from the center of a cluster is @xmath42 dv ,   \\label{definicion}\\]]where @xmath43 is the mean space density of galaxies .",
    "we only have information on the distance ( redshifts ) of the clusters and not on the individual galaxies in the 2mass and apm catalogues .",
    "then , in order to obtain @xmath0 we first determine the projected cross - correlation function @xmath44 , defined by lilje & efstathiou ( 1988 ) , where @xmath45 is the projected separation between a cluster at redshift @xmath46 and a galaxy at angular distance @xmath47 from its centre . to determine this quantity from our data we used the estimator @xmath48where",

    "when the angle @xmath54 rad , that is , the distance @xmath55 to the cluster centre is much larger than the projected cluster - galaxy separation , the projected correlation function is related to the spatial correlation function by the simple integral equation ( saunders , rowan - robinson & lawrence , 1992 ) @xmath56 the constant @xmath34 regulates the amplitude of the correlation function taking into account the differences in the selection function of clusters and galaxies and can be calculated by ( lylje & efstathiou 1988 ) @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the selection function of the galaxy survey , @xmath59 is the distance to cluster @xmath60 and the sums extends to all clusters in the sample .    equation [ integral ] can be easily solved analytically if we perform a linear interpolation of @xmath61 between its values at the measured @xmath62 s . with this approach",

    "the error bars where obtained by the bootstrap re - sampling technique .",
    "specially for 2df groups , the shape of this function is different from a simple power law as it shows an increment in small scales that can be associated to the inner profile of the groups and clusters .

    "tables 1 and 2 show the results of power - law fits of the form @xmath70 to the inner and outer regions for the different samples analysed .",
    "it can be clearly seen that the correlation function is nearly independent of the magnitude limit imposed to the galaxy sample showing only small variations in the best fit power - law parameters .",

    "our results for the two lower values of the threshold mass show that , at large scales , @xmath5 is consistent with a constant of order @xmath108 for apm galaxies and slightly higher for 2mass , which shows that 2mass galaxies are more biased tracers of the mass distribution than optically selected galaxies . on smaller scales ( @xmath109 )",

    "this scale would correspond to the onset of non - linearities , where @xmath0 becomes steeper and virialization takes place .",
    "a constant bias is a feature characteristic of linear theory and then it is not surprising that it does not hold as well in the non - linear regime .",
    "another reason that may add to the anti - bias in the cluster and infall regions is the change in the galaxy types .",
    "the dense environments contain galaxies with older stellar populations with less light per baryonic mass .",
    "then , cluster regions are down - weighted by this effect .",
    "it is very important to note that these results are independent of the limiting values of mass , x - ray luminosity and magnitude used to construct the clusters and galaxy samples , which shows that this is not a property of a given galaxy type , but a generic feature of the processes that control the efficiency of galaxy formation and evolution .",

    "we have also presented the first calculation of this statistical measure for a galaxy group sample from the 2dfgrs .",
    "these two samples span a wide range of masses and so they allow us to analyse the dependence of @xmath0 on @xmath2 .",
    "our results for the different sub - samples of galaxies from 2mass or apm with different limiting magnitudes show that @xmath0 is almost independent of galaxy properties and that its shape is determined almost exclusively by the criteria used to define the cluster sample .    in agreement with previous works ( croft et al .",
    "1999 ) we found that the shape of @xmath0 can not be described by a single power law at all scales . instead",
    ", it shows two regimes with a clear transition , one for the larger scales , and a steeper one at smaller scales showing the inner profiles of the distribution of galaxies around cluster centres .",
    "we have used our results to check the @xmath83 relation of reiprich & bhringer ( 2002 ) .",
    "we have found that the correlation functions obtained using 2df groups with a given lower mass limit and reflex clusters with the corresponding limit on @xmath1 are in complete agreement showing the validity of this relation .",
    "the comparison of our results with those obtained for the halo - mass cross - correlation function in a @xmath3cdm n - body simulation shows that the observational results are consistent with a constant bias on large scales of order unity for apm galaxies and slightly higher for 2mass galaxies . on smaller scales our results",
    "suggests that there is a substantial anti - bias ( @xmath4 ) . in all cases",
    "the transition scale between the two regimes corresponds to the onset of non - linearities , where the correlation functions becomes steeper .",
