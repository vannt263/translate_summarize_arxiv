    "the origin of the initial mass function ( imf ) is a long - standing issue in modern astrophysics .",

    "an explanation of the imf is one of the key goals of star formation ( sf ) research .",
    "it should reflect not only the variety of initial conditions in sf sites but implement complex and intertwined physical processes like gravitational collapse and fragmentation , turbulent motions , shock waves , accretion and protostellar outflows .",
    "the extensive photometric and spectroscopic studies of the milky way and some nearby galaxies over the last two decades led to reliable determination of the imf in the range from @xmath9 ( brown dwarfs , bds ) up to @xmath10 .",
    "the high - mass part of the imf ( @xmath11 ) is nowadays firmly established to be a power - law function @xmath12 . the universality of its ` salpeter slope ' @xmath13 @xcite is confirmed by infrared observations of the arches cluster @xcite although @xmath14 could vary ( @xmath15 ) in some regions of active star formation ( see elmegreen 2009 for a review ) .",

    "it could be represented with a power - law fit with much shallower slope @xcite or with a lognormal function @xcite .",
    "significant uncertainties remain regarding the bd range of the imf .",
    "for instance , @xcite demonstrate sensible discontinuity at @xmath17 in several young galactic clusters .",

    "one current theory describes the sf process as being controlled by supersonic turbulence @xcite .",
    "this process is often referred to as _",
    "gravoturbulent fragmentation_. the physics of turbulence is still quite poorly understood , because of the great mathematical complexity of the fluid equations ( see e.g. lesieur 1997 ) and the issue of how turbulence is driven remains under debate @xcite .",
    "numerical simulations show that although supersonic turbulence can provide global support , it produces density enhancements in molecular clouds ( mcs ) that allow for local collapse - gravitationally bound clumps of a few hundred solar masses contract and fragment with formation of compact protostellar cores @xcite .",
    "if such forming clusters are gas - rich , _ competitive accretion _ is another crucial factor for the origin of the imf ",
    "it determines the final mass of each protostellar core , depending on its initial mass and the properties of the surrounding turbulent flow @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "winds from the most massive stars play a crucial role for the energetic balance in the ism of the cluster .",
    "numerical simulations have also confirmed that radiation feedback from young protostars can also help shape the cluster imf , by setting a lower limits to the jeans mass in the ambient gas ( e.g. offner et al .",
    "effects of accretion and energetic feedback from winds are implemented in a model of the cluster imf of @xcite .    to sum up",
    ", current theories of the imf describe the latter as the combined result of gravoturbulent mc fragmentation and competitive accretion , offering different scenarios , responsible for its substellar part @xcite . in this paper",
    "we present a semi - analytical model that implements these two basic physical mechanisms and is in agreement with the generalised multipart power - law form of the observational imf @xcite .",
    "the ` backbone ' of our model is the mass distribution of gravitationally unstable , star - forming clumps which is linked to the probability density function ( pdf ) of the density field at different scales in mcs .",
    "the most successful ( semi-)analytical imf models of @xcite ( hereafter : pn02 ) and of @xcite ( hereafter : hc08 ) are based on the pdf of the density field , resulting from supersonic turbulence .",
    "the distribution of the density @xmath3 per unit volume is lognormal and the position of the maximum is a function of the standard deviation ( stddev ) @xmath18 : @xmath19 @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 is mean density in the considered volume .",
    "the stddev depends on the mach number @xmath23 for supersonic flows @xcite : @xmath24    in the semi - analytical model of pn02 , the pdf of the density field is transformed into a distribution of jeans masses .",
    "this approach serves for the probabilistic evaluation of the local collapse conditions for dense cores and hence to set up a low - mass cut - off of the imf ( see formula ( 24 ) in pn02 ) .",
    "the cores themselves are identified as fragments of layers or filaments , formed by shocks in the supersonic turbulent flow .",
    "their mass distribution is derived from the mhd shock jump conditions , whereas their number is controlled by a natural assumption for turbulent flows : self - similarity at different scales ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "more recently , @xcite extended the model of pn02 , including dynamical evolution of the prestellar cores and their coalescence and collapse .",
    "the main criticisms to pn02 model concern the implementation of the geometry of the post - shock structures @xcite and of turbulent and magnetic support in the collapse conditions ( hc08 ) .",
    "the mass of a formed dense core should also influence the suggested jeans mass distribution .",
    "the extensive analytical model of hc08 is an attempt to refine the physical description of collapsing structures in the framework of @xcite .",
    "a density threshold is imposed for collapsing clumps while turbulent and magnetic support are implemented in the threshold conditions  through dependence of the turbulent jeans mass from the mean turbulent velocity @xmath26 and a modification of the mach number in the mhd case , respectively .",
    "scale dependence of the pdf width is introduced in the natural limits between injection and dissipation in a turbulent cascade process .",
    "accretion onto the dense prestellar cores is assumed to happen only within the initial gravitationally unstable regions and not from external sources . that arises consistently from the picture of fragmentation in collapsing structures with power - law density profile @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "no further fragmentation during the core collapse is assumed .",

    "our semi - analytical model attempts to combine some of the mentioned ideas about the origin of the imf with several refined physical assumptions about sf process :    * starting point is a turbulent cascade process in the ism , which for simplicity we assume to be isothermal at @xmath32 at all scales .",
    "it leads to the formation of clumps at different scales @xmath0 , beginning at an injection scale @xmath37 and proceeding downwards to @xmath38 .",

    "steeper slopes are obtained as @xmath175 is increasing .",
    "that is understandable , because decreasing of the initial gas mass @xmath227 in the clumps minimises the role of accretion on the protostellar cores in reshaping their mass distribution .",
    "* intermediate - mass imf with shallow ( negative ) slope and a mass range within an order of magnitude ( @xmath228 ) is derived mainly for solenoidal turbulent forcing .",
    "compressive forcing ( @xmath229 ) tends to produce a narrow imf , with a peak shifted toward the bd mass range .",
    "the apparent exception is the case @xmath6 : both extreme regimes of forcing yield an imf in a good agreement with observations . *",

    "different considerations of the clump energy budget yield a variety of mass - density relationships , with @xmath234 , as we intend to demonstrate in a forthcoming paper .",

    "[ acc_descr ] ) also fits the current state of the theory .",
    "numerical simulations of accretion in protostellar clusters by @xcite show that most of the gas is exhausted at @xmath242 .",
    "this sets up only a lower limit of @xmath211 since feedback from massive stars and magnetic fields were neglected in their work but is an appropriate reference value in view of the description of accretion we adopted . in our model",
    ", the majority of the unstable clumps at all scales that have given birth to larger clusters ( @xmath243 cores ) have consumed the remainining gas at @xmath214 .",
    "thus the shape of the imf is practically finished at timescales about @xmath214 ( fig .",
    "[ imf_025 ] , top pannels ) and further accretion does not influence it significantly .",
    "an apparently realistic imf is derived from models with @xmath240 and @xmath241 and higher pcfe ( fig .",
    "[ imf_050 ] and [ imf_097 ] , bottom panels ) .",
    "however , such values of the exponent @xmath5 can not be substantiated theoretically and lead to clump mass - size relationships in drastic contradiction both with present observational studies and numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "moreover , these models fail to reproduce the substellar imf  discontinuity in that mass range is about an order of magnitude larger than found by @xcite in young galactic clusters .",
    "accretion on protostellar cores plays a significant role for shaping the final imf in our model .",
    "therefore it is instructive to make a brief comparison with the recent work of @xcite in which accretion is also one of the key factors and the imf is also derived from a sum of local core mass distributions . without going into details ,",
    "we stress the important conceptual differences . the model of @xcite is aimed at _ reproduction of the imf in young clusters _ where the sf process has been rapid .",
    "the ` building blocks ' in their approach are the prestellar core mass distributions derived through the formalism of pn02 for different locations within a protocluster clump .",
    "subsequent accretion is also described locally : on cores , injected in the protocluster at a uniform rate and in different epochs , until the gas in the protocluster is dispersed by stellar winds from massive stars .",
    "our model of the imf is aimed to be _ representative of star formation in galaxies _ , in a wider range of timescales ( cf .",
    "[ m_tau ] ) , and its building blocks are unstable clumps generated through a turbulent cascade spanning a range of 3 orders of magnitude in spatial scales .",
    "their fragmentation into prestellar cores proceeds in a self - similar way , depending on the local jeans mass .",
    "the time evolution of the imf in our model is based on the assumption that the clump population is constantly replenished ( sect .",
    "[ treat_timescale ] ) . unlike the model of @xcite",
    ", accretion is spatially averaged for the clump in consideration and feedback from newly formed massive stars is neglected . in view of the large clump statistics assumed in our model ,",
    "such approach would not affect significantly the predicted imf although refinements are necessary when the sf process is described specifically at the protocluster scale .",
    "in this work we developed a semi - analytical model of the imf that takes into account the basic mechanisms in the sf process : gravoturbulent fragmentation and subsequent accretion on the prestellar cores .",
    "it is based on the idea of a turbulent cascade that starts from large injection scales @xmath244 and transfers energy down to dissipation scales below @xmath245 .",
    "turbulence is essentially supersonic at all scales which results in network of interacting shocks and formation of condensations ( clumps ) with lognormal distribution of densities .",
    "the main assumption in our model is the existence of a power - law relation between the clump mass and the clump density @xmath246 , where @xmath5 is a scale - free parameter .",
    "it leads to lognormal clump mass distribution and to a scale - dependent critical mass that determines the fraction of gravitationally unstable clumps ( if any ) at given scale .",
    "summation of their mass distributions over all scales yields their composite cmf : asymmetric with shallow power - law part ( slope @xmath247 ) , for @xmath248 , and steeper , with a salpeter - like slope ( @xmath249 ) , for @xmath144 .",
    "the fragmentation of unstable clumps is assumed to produce a lognormal mass distribution of prestellar cores , centred around the clump jeans mass .",
    "adopting constant core formation efficiency @xmath175 , we let the rest of the clump mass @xmath250 to be distributed on the formed cores through competitive accretion .",
    "the duration of this process is within @xmath251 clump free - fall times @xmath252 as the gas density in the protocluster approaches an @xmath253 profile .",
    "eventually , the imf is derived through summation over all clumps with halted accretion , build at all scales , and allowing constant replenishment of clumps with faster evolution .",
    "the free parameters of the proposed imf model are the exponent @xmath5 in the clump mass - clump density relation , the turbulent forcing parameter @xmath60 and the core formation efficiency @xmath175 .",
    "models with @xmath6 and low @xmath175 turn out to be consistent with the observational imf .",
    "the physics behind the proposed relation @xmath254 is to be substantiated .",
    "fragmentation of unstable clumps is another element of the model that needs further elaboration .",
    "as demonstrated by @xcite , it depends on the turbulent injection scale and hence may yield a variety of mass distributions of dense cores . eventually , we point out that the implemented description of competitive accretion within a fragmented clump gives only general estimates .",
    "accurate modelling of this complex process is practically impossible in an analytical or semi - analytical framework .    to conclude , the proposed model reproduces correctly the effects of gravoturbulent fragmentation and competitive accretion on the imf at galactic scales .",
    "it is based on reasonable physical assumptions about the sf process and should be considered as a first step toward a more extensive theoretical framework .",
