    "the creation of top quarks in @xmath2 collisions offers a unique test of pair - production in quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) at very large momentum transfer as well as a promising potential avenue for the observation of new physical phenomena .",
    "given the very large mass of the top quark , exotic processes may couple more strongly to top quarks than to the other known fundamental particles , and possible hints of new interactions could be first observed in top - quark production . in particular , asymmetries in @xmath0 production",
    "could provide the first evidence of new interactions , such as @xmath0 production via a heavy axial color octet or a flavor - changing @xmath11 boson , that might not be easily observed as excesses in the top quark production rate or as resonances in the @xmath0 invariant mass distribution .",
    "the cdf and d0 collaborations have previously reported on forward - backward asymmetries ( @xmath1 ) in @xmath12 production at @xmath3  tev at the fermilab tevatron . in the standard model ( sm ) , the @xmath0 production process is approximately symmetric in production angle , with a @xmath13(7% ) charge asymmetry arising at next - to - leading order ( nlo ) and beyond  @xcite . using a sample corresponding to @xmath14 of integrated luminosity ,",
    "cdf measured a parton - level asymmetry @xmath15  @xcite in the lepton+jets decay channel ( @xmath16  @xcite ) , and very good agreement was found by the d0 measurement @xmath17  @xcite in a lepton+jets sample corresponding to @xmath18 .",
    "cdf and d0 have also performed simple differential measurements using two bins each in the top - antitop rapidity difference @xmath8 and the top - antitop invariant mass @xmath7 .",
    "the two experiments agreed on a large @xmath8 dependence .",
    "cdf also saw a large @xmath7 dependence , and while that observed at d0 was smaller , the cdf and d0 results were statistically consistent",
    ". one of the aims of this paper is to clarify the @xmath8 and @xmath7 dependence of the asymmetry using the full cdf data set .",
    "the @xmath19 results have stimulated new theoretical work , both within and outside the context of the sm .",
    "the sm calculation has been improved by calculations of electroweak processes that contribute to the asymmetry , studies of the choice of renormalization scale , and progress on a next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) calculation of the asymmetry  @xcite .",
    "the new calculations result in a small increase in the expected asymmetry , but not enough to resolve the tension with observation .",
    "other work has focused on the dependence of the asymmetry on the transverse momentum of the @xmath0 system  @xcite , on which we report here .    a number of speculative papers invoke new interactions in the top sector  @xcite to explain the large asymmetry . in one class of models ,",
    "@xmath0 pairs can be produced via new axial @xmath20-channel particles arising from extended gauge symmetries or extra dimensions .",
    "for these models , the asymmetry is caused by interference between the new @xmath20-channel mediator and the sm gluon .",
    "in other models , light @xmath21-channel particles with flavor - violating couplings create an asymmetry via a @xmath22 , @xmath23 flavor change into the forward rutherford - scattering peak .",
    "all potential models of new interactions must accommodate the apparent consistency of the measured cross section and @xmath7 spectrum with the sm predictions .",
    "tevatron and lhc searches for related phenomena , such as di - jet resonances , same - sign tops , and other exotic processes , can provide additional experimental limits on potential models .",
    "measurements by the lhc experiments of the top - quark charge asymmetry @xmath24 , an observable that is distinct from @xmath1 but correlated with it , have found no significant disagreement with the sm  @xcite ; however , any observable effect at the lhc is expected to be small , and the nature of the relationship between @xmath1 and @xmath24 is model - dependent  @xcite . a more precise measurement of the tevatron forward - backward asymmetry and its mass and rapidity dependence may help untangle the potential new physics sources for @xmath1 from the standard model and from each other .",
    "this paper reports on a study of the asymmetry in the lepton+jets topology , with several new features compared to the previous cdf analysis in this channel  @xcite .",
    "we use the complete tevatron run  ii data set with an integrated luminosity of @xmath25 .",
    "we additionally expand the event selection by including events triggered by large missing transverse energy and multiple hadronic jets , increasing the total data set by approximately @xmath26 beyond what is gained by the increase in luminosity .",
    "in total , the number of candidate events in this analysis is more than twice the number of events used in ref .",
    "an improved nlo monte carlo generator is used to describe the predicted @xmath0 signal , and we also add small corrections reflecting new results on the electroweak contributions to the asymmetry  @xcite .",
    "finally , parton - level shape corrections utilize an improved algorithm which yields binned parton - level measurements of the rapidity and mass dependence of the asymmetry .",
    "we also study the dependence of the asymmetry on the @xmath0 transverse momentum , @xmath27 , showing that the modeling of this quanity is robust , and that the excess asymmetry above the sm prediction is consistent with being independent of @xmath27 .",
    "the asymmetry is measured using the difference of the @xmath21 and @xmath28 rapidities , @xmath29 , where the rapidity @xmath30 is given by      with @xmath32 being the total top - quark energy and @xmath33 being the component of the top - quark momentum along the beam axis as measured in the detector rest frame .",
    "@xmath34 is invariant to boosts along the beamline , and in the limit where the transverse momentum of the @xmath0 system is small , the forward - backward asymmetry      is identical to the asymmetry in the top - quark production angle in the experimentally well - defined @xmath0 rest frame .",
    "the standard model predictions for the top - quark asymmetry referenced in this paper are based on the nlo event generator powheg  @xcite , using the cteq6.1 m set of parton - distribution functions ( pdfs ) , validated by comparing powhegto the nlo generator mc@nlo",
    "@xcite as well as the nlo calculation of mcfm  @xcite .",
    "we find good consistency overall , as shown in table  [ mc : tab : predictions ]  @xcite .",
    "sources of asymmetry from electroweak processes in the standard model that are not included in the powhegcalculations  @xcite lead to an overall increase of the asymmetry by a factor of 26% of the qcd expectation .",
    "this is included in all the predictions shown in table  [ mc : tab : predictions ] and in all predicted asymmetries and @xmath34 distributions in this paper .",
    "the electroweak asymmetry is assumed to have the same @xmath7 and @xmath34 dependence as the qcd asymmetry , and we apply a simple 26% rescaling to the powheg predictions there as well . following ref .",
    "@xcite , we include a @xmath26 uncertainty on all theoretical predictions for the sm asymmetry due to the choice of renormalization scale .",
