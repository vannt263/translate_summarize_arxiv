    "once planetary embryos are as large as 10 earth masses , the embryos start rapid gas accretion , which results in gas giant planets @xcite .",
    "a swarm of planetesimals produces planetary embryos through runaway growth @xcite and the embryos grow further through the accretion of remnant planetesimals , which is called oligarchic growth @xcite . however , the stirring by embryos is so strong that collisions between planetesimals are destructive .",

    "reduce the solid surface density of bodies surrounding planetary embryos , so that the growth of the planetary embryos is stalled @xcite .",
    "the collisional outcomes for kilometer - sized or larger planetesimals are determined by re - accretion of collisional fragments that result from shattering ; therefore , the effective collisional strength is mainly controlled by self - gravity , so that larger planetesimals are collisionally stronger .",
    "larger planetesimals can avoid a reduction of the solid surface density due to collisional fragmentation , which results in the formation of more massive planetary embryos .",
    "on the other hand , the timescale for planetary embryo formation through runaway and oligarchic growth is longer for larger planetesimals .",
    "therefore , @xcite found that the formation of 10  earth mass cores inside 10au within 10myr requires moderate - sized planetesimals at the onset of runaway growth ( @xmath6 km in radius ) in a massive disk ( @xmath7 solar masses ) .",
    "dust particles grow to meter - sized pebbles via collisions in a protoplanetary disk .",
    "pebbles lose substantial angular momentum due to gas drag because of the sub - keplerian rotational velocity of gas and spiral onto the central star .",
    "if pebbles are compact , then radial drift is too rapid to grow to planetesimals @xcite .",
    "however , successive collisions of dust produce highly porous aggregates @xcite",
    ". icy porous aggregates that consist of a number of spherical sub - micron particles do not suffer from catastrophic disruption unless the impact velocities exceed 6090 m/s @xcite .",
    "@xcite investigated the collisional evolution of the mass and porosity of icy dust aggregates , whereby icy fluffy dust aggregates were determined to grow into planetesimals faster than they drift .",
    "the filling factor of the aggregates becomes as low as @xmath8 when radial drift is most effective .",
    "since the compaction of aggregates by ram pressure and self - gravity is effective with the growth of aggregates , the filling factor of kilometer - sized or larger planetesimals increases up to @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "the critical collisional velocity that inhibits collisional growth is @xmath9 m/s for icy dust aggregates @xcite .",
    "such a high critical velocity means that icy planetesimals can be formed through collisions .",
    "silicate dust aggregates may be destroyed at @xmath10 m/s if the surface energy @xcite .",

    "@xmath12 of the particles is @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite pointed out that the surface energy of silicates depends on the outermost layer of absorbed water on the surfaces of dust particles .",

    "therefore , here we consider planetesimal formation via the collisional coagulation of dust aggregates , while we ignore the alternative paths for planetesimal formation , such as streaming instability @xcite .",
    "the collisional growth of porous aggregates overcomes the drift barrier and the subsequent compaction of aggregates produces planetesimals with low porosity , which then grow further via collisions . once gravitational focusing and dynamical friction",

    "the lifetime of the surrounding planetesimals due to collisional fragmentation depends on their size @xcite .",
    "thus , the size of planetesimals at the onset of runaway growth affects the growth of planetary embryos .    gravitational focusing and dynamical friction are effective if @xmath17 , where @xmath0 is the relative velocity between planetesimals and @xmath1 is the mutual surface escape velocity of the planetesimals ; however , runaway growth is suppressed if @xmath18 @xcite . in protoplanetary disks , turbulent stirring due to",
    "hydrodynamical gas drag accelerates @xmath0 , which is effective for bodies smaller than @xmath19 m . on the other hand , the density fluctuation caused by turbulence results in significant perturbation that effectively increases the random velocities of kilometer - sized or larger planetesimals @xcite .",
    "stirring by the density fluctuation in a turbulent disk suppresses the runaway growth of such kilometer - sized or larger planetesimals .",
