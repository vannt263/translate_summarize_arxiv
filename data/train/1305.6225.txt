    "the characterization of entanglement in many - body strongly correlated systems has been a very active research area in the last decade ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite for a review ) .",
    "entanglement is expected to be particularly relevant in quantum phase transitions ( qpt ) and , in order to gather valuable insight , ground states of paradigmatic spin chain models have been exhaustively analyzed .",
    "first , it was shown in refs .",
    "@xcite that for the ising chain in a transverse field , pairwise entanglement measured by the concurrence between nearest ( and next - to nearest ) neighbors signals the position of the critical point ( but does not display critical behavior ) while is strictly zero otherwise .",
    "the conjecture that , near criticality , entanglement should be present at all length - scales led to the concept of localizable entanglement , which was introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite . for a given @xmath0-partite state @xmath1",
    ", the localizable entanglement is the maximum average entanglement that can be made available to two pre - determined parties ( say , spins 1 and 2 ) , by performing general local measurements on the rest of the system .",
    "if the correlation length diverges at criticality , so does the length of localizable entanglement .",
    "however , the converse is not necessarily true  @xcite .",
    "a quite different approach was considered in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the scaling of the entanglement between a given block of spins and the rest of a chain was analyzed against the size of the block itself . in such cases , the entanglement between two blocks can be fully determined simply by considering the von neumann entropy of a block ( also termed entanglement entropy ) . in this approach ,",
    "contrary to the pairwise case , entanglement is clearly related to critical behavior .",
    "away from criticality , the entanglement entropy reaches a constant value and shows logarithmic divergence with the size of the block when approaching the critical point .",
    "conformal field theory was used to relate such divergence to the central charge of the corresponding effective theory , thus linking entanglement and the universality class of the corresponding qpt .",
    "remarkably , both the entanglement entropy as well as the renyi entropies are functions of the eigenvalues of the reduced density matrix of the block .    while all previous studies concern exclusively bipartite entanglement ( either pairwise or block - block ) a full description of many - body strongly correlated systems should include multipartite entanglement .",
    "indeed , multipartite entanglement has been demonstrated in certain spin models  @xcite and its role in qpt has been long discussed ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "however , the study of multipartite entanglement is presently much less developed in light of its daunting nature and the lack of appropriate tools .",
    "in fact , we even lack general measures of entanglement for mixed states of three spins and it is not possible to extend the concept of entanglement entropy to more than two blocks .    in this paper",
    "we analyze long range multipartite entanglement in the vicinity of quantum phase transitions providing a general method that relies only on three - point correlators only .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : rotinv ] we briefly review rotationally invariant states that will be used as the starting point for the construction of a family of entanglement witnesses ( i.e. , observables ) in sec . [",
    "sec : witness ] .",
    "we provide a sufficient condition to assess genuine tripartite entanglement in the ground state of a many - body system . by relying on the availability of three - point correlation functions only",
    ", our approach does not depend on the hamiltonian properties ( type and range of the interactions , symmetries of the model , lattice geometry ) , its dimensionality or the actual choice of the subset of three spins picked from the lattice . with such tools at hand ,",
    "we demonstrate that genuine multipartite entanglement ( gme ) is highly sensitive to quantum phase transitions . in order to provide a significant context where our formalism can be applied , we focus on the spin-@xmath2 xxz chain . in sec .",
    "[ sec : xxz ] we first shortly review the properties of the model . then we consider the transition from the xy critical phase to the ferromagnetic one .",
    "it is known that as the critical point is approached pairwise bipartite entanglement becomes independent of the distance between the spins  @xcite . here",
    "we show that also long range multipartite entanglement emerges in the vicinity of the the critical point . in this sense",
    "we provide a finer - grained entanglement structure than previous analysis based on collective operators @xcite by proving that entanglement extends far beyond the nearest - neighbor scale .",
    "we summarize our results in sec . [",
    "sec : summary ] .",
    "our analysis stems from rotationally invariant states of three qubits , whose entanglement properties have been unambiguously characterized in ref .",
    "@xcite through a set of scalar inequalities . by projecting a generic state onto its rotationally invariant subspace",
    ", we can also address gme in non - rotationally invariant states .",
    "equivalently , one can detect gme by constructing suitable rotationally invariant entanglement witnesses .    before proceeding",
    "further we review , for completeness , the characterization of rotationally invariant states .",
    "we then provide a geometrical description of such space and construct a family of entanglement witnesses .",

    "@xmath4 acts trivially in the two subspaces of total angular momentum @xmath2 and the one of @xmath8 .",

    "each class embraces those that are lower in the hierarchy , i.e. @xmath50 . the distinction between the w - type states and the ghz - type ones arises from the fact that for , three qubits , there are two non - equivalent classes of genuinely entangled states with representative elements being precisely the w state @xmath51 , and the ghz state @xmath52",
    ". elements of one class can not be inter - converted into elements of the second one using stochastic local operations and classical communications .",
