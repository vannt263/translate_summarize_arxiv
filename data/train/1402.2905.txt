    "understanding the behavior of complex traits involves modeling a web of interactions among the effects of genes , environmental conditions and other covariates . ignoring one or more of these factors may substantially impact the accuracy and the generality of the conclusions that can be drawn from the model @xcite , both in the context of genome - wide association studies ( gwas ) and genomic selection ( gs ) .",
    "indeed a lot of attention has been devoted in recent literature to improving traditional additive genetic models , which were originally defined using only allele counts ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , by supplementing them with additional information .",
    "some examples include marker - based kinship coefficients @xcite , spatial heterogeneity and dominance @xcite , and gene expression data @xcite .    however , most studies in plant and animal genetics still focus on a single phenotypic trait at a time despite the availability of a set of simultaneously measured traits for each genotyped individual",
    ". models for analyzing multiple traits have been available since @xcite introduced the multivariate extension of the genetic best linear unbiased prediction ( gblup ) models , and have been investigated as recently as @xcite in the context of gwas .",
    "more recent additions include structural equation models ( sem ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , a bayesian extension of seemingly unrelated regression ( sur ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the multiphen ordinal regression @xcite and spatial models @xcite .    in this paper we will use bayesian networks ( bns ; * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to build a multivariate dependency model that accounts for simultaneous associations and interactions among multiple single nucleotide polymorphisms ( snps ) and phenotypic traits .",
    "bns have been applied to the analysis of several kinds of genomic data such as gene expression @xcite , protein - protein interactions @xcite , pedigree analysis @xcite and the integration of heterogeneous genetic data @xcite .",
    "their modular nature makes them ideal for analyzing large marker profiles .",
    "as far as snps are concerned , bns have been used to investigate linkage disequilibrium ( ld ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and epistasis @xcite , and to determine disease susceptibility for anemia @xcite , leukemia @xcite , and hypertension @xcite .",
    "the same bn can simultaneously highlight snps potentially involved in determining a trait ( e.g. for association purposes ) and be used for prediction ( e.g. for selection purposes ) : a network capturing the relationship between genotypes and phenotypes can be used to compute the probability that a new individual with a particular genotype will have the phenotype of interest @xcite .",

    "commonly used additive genetic models for quantitative traits ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we make some further assumptions on the bn :    1",
    ".   each variable @xmath8 is normally distributed , and @xmath6 is multivariate normal ; [ pt1 ] 2 .",
    "stochastic dependencies are assumed to be linear ; [ pt2 ] 3 .",
    "traits can depend on snps ( i.e. @xmath10 ) but not vice versa ( i.e. not @xmath11 ) , and they can depend on other traits ( i.e. @xmath12 ) ; [ pt3 ] 4 .",
    "snps can depend on other snps ( i.e. @xmath13 ) .",
    "[ pt4 ]    we also assume that dependencies between traits broadly follow the temporal order in which they are measured ; for instance , traits that are measured when a plant variety is harvested can depend on those that are measured while it is still in the field ( and obviously on the markers as well ) , but not vice versa . in other words , assumptions [ pt3 ] and [ pt4 ] define bns that describe the dependencies of phenotypes on genotypes in a _",
    "prognostic _ model , as opposed to a _ diagnostic _ model in which genotypes depend on phenotypes .",
    "the latter is often preferred over the former because it results in simpler models when the @xmath8 are discrete @xcite ; in that setting , the number of parameters grows exponentially with the number of parents of each node .",
    "however , this is not the case here due to assumptions [ pt1 ] and [ pt2 ] . under these assumptions ,",
    "the local distribution @xmath14 of each trait is a linear model of the form @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the identity matrix .",
    "snps will typically be coded using their allele counts ( @xmath17 ) , although extensions to multiallelic snps and to account for dominance are trivial .",
    "the local distribution @xmath18 of each snp is @xmath19 therefore , each parent only adds one parameter to a local distribution .    the regression parameters in ( [ eq : trait ] ) and ( [ eq : snp ] ) can be estimated in different ways . when @xmath0 is sparse , ordinary least squares ( ols ) are often used because each local distribution is estimated independently and contains few regressors .",
    "otherwise , penalized estimators such as ridge regression ( rr ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) can be used when @xmath0 is dense .",
    "the resulting bn can then be considered a flexible implementation of multivariate ridge regression , which has a number of of desirable properties over ols @xcite .",
    "equivalently , we can describe a bn using its global distribution , denoted with @xmath20 in ( [ eq : markov ] ) .",
    "following assumption [ pt1 ] , @xmath6 has a multivariate normal distribution , say @xmath21 .",
    "in addition , by definition graphical separation of two nodes @xmath8 and @xmath22 in @xmath0 implies the conditional independence of the corresponding variables given the rest . as a result",
    ", some elements of the precision matrix @xmath23 will be equal to zero and some will be strictly positive according to the structure of @xmath0 .",

    "the residual variance @xmath43 is also specific to each trait .",
    "the two traits depend directly on each other because of the covariances @xmath44 ; and indirectly through the covariance structure of the snp effects @xmath39 . if we denote @xmath45^t)$ ] as @xmath46 and @xmath47^t)$ ] as @xmath48 , we can write @xmath49\\right )    =    \\left [     \\begin{array}{c|c }       \\mathbf{z}_{\\mathbf{s } } \\mathbf{g } \\mathbf{z}_{\\mathbf{s}}^t + \\mathbf{r } &       \\mathbf{z}_{\\mathbf{s } } \\mathbf{g } \\\\       \\hline       ( \\mathbf{z}_{\\mathbf{s } } \\mathbf{g})^t &       \\mathbf{g }     \\end{array }    \\right]\\ ] ] which is the covariance matrix of the global distribution .",
    "the structure of the bn defined over @xmath50 and corresponding to the multivariate gblup in ( [ eq : multiblup ] ) arises from @xmath23 as discussed above .",
    "finally , it is important to note that even though gblup does not model the snp effects using the allele counts directly as in ( [ eq : trait ] ) and ( [ eq : snp ] ) , when @xmath51 and @xmath52 have the form @xmath53 the linear dependence on @xmath54 can be equivalently expressed as a random regression in the allele counts @xcite .",
    "the form of @xmath55 determines how the allele counts are scaled or weighted in the regression .",
    "this formulation of gblup results in a more natural interpretation of snp effects , which is in fact analogous to the interpretation they are given in a bn @xcite .",
    "another interesting property of the bn defined above is that the covariance matrix of the snp genotypes , which is a submatrix @xmath56 of @xmath57 ( the global covariance matrix ) , is used in computing @xmath28 and determines which arcs are present in @xmath0 between the snps .",
    "furthermore , @xmath56 encodes the ld patterns between the snps as measured by the squared allelic correlation @xmath58 .",
    "this has been shown to be useful in exploring complex ld patterns in an inbred holstein cattle population , albeit with a discrete bn @xcite and measuring ld in a way that is closer to @xmath59 and @xmath60 @xcite .",
    "such patterns are reflected in the bn through @xmath28 , providing an intuitive representation of ld as well as of genetic effects on phenotypes as a single , coherent whole .",
    "bns present two other advantages over classic multivariate regression models such as multivariate gblup and ridge regression .",
    "firstly , there is a vast literature on performing causal modeling with bns from both experimental and observational data @xcite .",
    "given the lack of a formal distinction between response and explanatory variables in bns , the same algorithms can be used for inference on the traits based on the genotypes and vice versa .",
    "the former includes the estimation of phenotypic ebvs , which is the basis of genomic selection ; the latter can be used for association mapping in polygenic traits and when the desired phenotype is a combination of conditions on several traits .",
    "secondly , the fundamental properties of bns do not depend on the distributional assumptions of the data .",
    "therefore , accommodating heterogeneous traits ( discrete , ordinal and continuous ) in the model only requires to specify the form of the local distributions .    estimating a bn from data is typically performed as a two - step process .",
    "the first step consists in finding the graph @xmath0 that encodes the conditional independencies present in the data , and is called _",
    "structure learning_. this can be achieved using conditional independence tests ( _ constraint - based learning _ ) , goodness - of - fit scores ( _ score - based learning _ ) or both ( _ hybrid learning _ ) to identify statistically significant arcs .",
    "the second step is called _",
    "parameter learning _ and deals with the estimation of the parameters of the local distributions ; @xmath0 is known from the previous step and defines which variables are included in each one .",
    "in addition , we propose to use structure learning to retain in the bn only those snps that are required to make inference on the traits and that make the remaining snps redundant . for each trait , such a subset",
    "is called the _ markov blanket _ ( @xmath61 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and includes the parents , the children and the other nodes that share a child with the trait .",
    "therefore , we can disregard all the snps that are not part of any such markov blanket and reduce drastically the dimension of the model .",
    "we have shown in previous work @xcite how markov blankets are effective when used in this setting .",
    "from these considerations , we used the r packages * bnlearn * @xcite and * penalized * @xcite to implement the following hybrid approach to bn learning .    1",
    ".   * structure learning . * 1 .   for each trait @xmath62 , use the si - hiton - pc algorithm @xcite to learn the parents and the children of the trait ; this is sufficient to identify @xmath61 because the only nodes that can share a child with @xmath62 are other traits or snps that are parents of other traits due to assumption [ pt3 ] .",
    "the choice of si - hiton - pc is motivated by its similarity to single - snp analysis , which is improved on with a subsequent backward selection to remove false positives .",
    "dependencies are assessed with student s @xmath63-test for pearson s correlation @xcite and @xmath64 .",
    "2 .   drop all the markers which are not in any @xmath61 .",
    "3 .   learn the structure of the bn from the nodes selected in the previous step , setting the directions of the arcs according to the assumptions [ pt3 ] and [ pt4 ] .",
    "we identify the optimal structure as that which maximizes the _ bayesian information criterion _ ( bic ; * ? ? ?",
    "* parameter learning . *",
    "learn the parameters of the local distributions using ols and rr .    for comparison",
    ", we also fitted an elastic net ( enet ) model @xcite and a univariate gblup individually on each trait and on all the available snps using the * glmnet * @xcite and * synbreed * @xcite r packages .",
    "since we have shown bns to be equivalent to a multivariate gblup , we did not fit the latter as a separate model .",
    "we investigated the properties of the resulting models using , in each case , @xmath65 runs of @xmath65-fold cross - validation .",
    "predictive power was assessed by averaging the cross - validated correlations arising from the @xmath65 runs and computing confidence intervals as in @xcite . in the case of bns",
    ", predictions in the cross - validation folds were performed jointly on all traits , and in two different ways : by conditioning only on the snps in the bn , to provide a measure of _ genetic predictive ability _",
    "( @xmath66 ) and a fair comparison with single - trait models ; and by conditioning on the parents of each trait , which may in turn be traits themselves , to provide a tentative measure of _ causal predictive ability _ ( @xmath67 ) .    in order to perform inference",
    ", we produced an averaged bn using the @xmath68 networks we obtained in the course of cross - validation .",
    "first , we created an averaged network structure using their graphs as in @xcite : we kept only those arcs that appear with a frequency higher than a threshold estimated from the graphs themselves .",
    "snps which ended up as isolated nodes ( i.e. they were not connected to any other snp or trait ) were dropped .",
    "we then estimated the parameters of the averaged bn with rr using the whole data set .",
    "we used the resulting bn to generate samples of @xmath69 random observations from the conditional distributions of various traits and snps with either logic sampling or likelihood weighting @xcite , in order to explore their properties and interplay under different conditions .",
    "statistics estimated from such a big sample are very precise and can capture even small differences reliably .",
    "we based our analysis on a winter wheat population produced by the uk national institute of agricultural botany ( niab ) comprising @xmath70 snps for @xmath71 genotypes .",
    "seven traits were measured : yield ( yld ; t / ha ) , flowering time ( ft ; @xmath72 , aggregate of 5 scores taken at 3 - 7 day intervals ) , height ( ht ; cm ) , yellow rust in the glasshouse ( yr.glass ; @xmath73 ) and in the field ( yr.field ; @xmath73 ) , fusarium ( fus ; @xmath73 ) and mildew ( mil ; @xmath73 ) .",
    "disease scores from @xmath74 to @xmath75 reflect increasing level of infection , and flowering time scores from @xmath76 to @xmath77 increasing lateness in flowering .",
    "the population was created using a multiparent advanced generation inter - cross ( magic ) scheme .",
    "such a scheme is designed to produce a mapping population from several generations of intercrossing among @xmath78 founders , and has the potential to improve quantitative trait loci ( qtl ) mapping precision ( for more details see * ? ? ?",
    "the use of multiple founder varieties results in a population which is segregating for more qtls and traits than a biparental population ; and the balanced crossing used in each generation reduces ld and family structure by ensuring each founder has an equal opportunity to contribute to each genotype .",
    "snps were preprocessed by removing those with minor allele frequencies @xmath79 and those with @xmath80 missing data .",
    "missing data in the remaining snps were imputed using the * impute * r package @xcite .",
    "other widely used imputation methods in genetics , such as that implemented in mach @xcite , could not be used because of the lack of precise mapping information at the time of the analysis ; a 90k consensus map has just been submitted for publication @xcite .",
    "subsequently , we removed one snp from each pair whose allele counts have correlation @xmath81 to increase the numerical stability of the models . in the end , @xmath82 snps were left for analysis .",
    "phenotypes were adjusted for kinship using a univariate blup model for each trait based on pedigree information , thus accounting for population structure .",
    "individuals with missing pedigree information or phenotypes were dropped from the analysis , leaving @xmath83 individuals with complete records .",
    ".genetic ( @xmath66 ) and causal ( @xmath67 ) predictive correlations for the @xmath84 traits and for single - trait elastic net ( enet ) , single - trait gblup and bns estimated with @xmath64 and rr .",
    "standard deviations computed as in @xcite is @xmath85 for all correlations .",
    "traits are yield ( yld ) , flowering time ( ft ) , height ( ht ) , yellow rust in the field ( yr.field ) and in the glasshouse ( yr.glass ) , mildew ( mil ) , and fusarium ( fus ) . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the averaged bn for @xmath86 is shown in figure [ fig : averaged ] ; it has @xmath87 nodes and @xmath88 arcs .",
    "for ease of plotting , the snp names corresponding to the labels used in the figure are reported in table [ tab : averaged ] .",
    "the dimension of the bn is comparable to that obtained for @xmath89 ( @xmath90 nodes , @xmath91 arcs ) and @xmath92 ( @xmath91 nodes , @xmath93 arcs ) . in all three cases",
    "the threshold for arc inclusion estimated as in @xcite is @xmath94 , which is close to the intuitive choice of including in the averaged bn those arcs that appear in more than half of the bns obtained during cross - validation .",
    "all snps in the averaged bn are linked with at least one trait , with the exception of g1789 ( d_contig28346_467 ) .",
    "their minor allele frequencies range from @xmath95 ( g2208 ; iaav1322 ) to @xmath96 ( g1945 ; excalibur_c29304_176 ) . furthermore",
    ", the bn is small enough that rr and ols parameter estimates are practically equivalent .",
    "as far as phenotypic traits are concerned , the averaged bn captures several known relationships .",
    "yr.field is influenced by ft ( ft @xmath97 yr.field in figure [ fig : averaged ] ) ; early flowering genotypes will have their leaves exposed to the pathogens for a longer time than later genotypes , resulting in higher yellow rust scores even if they have the same level of true disease resistance .",
    "this is substantiated by the posterior distribution of the disease score conditional on flowering time being in the bottom quartile ( @xmath98 $ ] ) or in the top quartile ( @xmath99 $ ] ) : it has mean @xmath100 in the first case and @xmath101 in the second .",
    "standard deviation is @xmath96 in both cases . the same is true for yr.glass , which has means @xmath102 and @xmath103 for early and late flowering genotypes ; standard deviation is @xmath104 .",
    "the network structure suggests that the yr.glass is not influenced directly by ft ( _ i.e. _ there is no ft @xmath97 yr.glass arc ) .",
    "the two yellow rust scores ( yr.glass @xmath97 yr.field ) are positively correlated ( @xmath105 ) , likely because of durable resistance .",
    "in addition , we note that yr.field summarizes adult resistance to a mixed population of pathotypes , which may include the specific pathotype used to measure juvenile resistance in yr.glass .",
    "we can also see from figure [ fig : averaged ] that yld depends directly on both ht ( ht @xmath97 yld ) and ft ( ft @xmath97 yld ) ; but it is affected only indirectly by all the disease scores except yr.glass .",
    "conditional on the combinations of bottom and top quartiles for ft and ht ( @xmath106 $ ] and @xmath107 $ ] ) , the expected yield is @xmath108 , @xmath109 , @xmath110 and @xmath111 respectively .",
    "standard deviation is @xmath96 in all four scenarios .",
    "therefore , we observe a marginal increase in yld of about @xmath112 when comparing short and tall genotypes , and a marginal decrease of about @xmath113 when comparing early and late flowering genotypes ; this is consistent with @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the interplay between ht and ft appears to be negligible in determining yield .",
    "conditioning on the bottom and top quartiles of the disease scores , we see a difference in the mean yld of @xmath114 ( fus ) , @xmath115 ( mil ) , @xmath116 ( yr.glass ) and @xmath117 ( yr.field ) .",
    "the apparent increase in yld associated with high fus scores is the result of the confounding effect of ht , which is directly linked to both variables in the bn ( fus @xmath118 ht @xmath119 yld ) .",
    "this is expected because susceptibility to fusarium is known to be positively related to ht @xcite , which in turn affects yld .",
    "conditional on each quartile of ht , fus has a negative effect on yld ranging from @xmath120 to @xmath121 .",
    "the last interaction between phenotypes in the bn is between mil and yr.glass ( mil @xmath97 yr.glass ) .",
    "this can be explained by the increased susceptibility to one disease in genotypes that are weakened by the onset of the other , by disease resistance being controlled by shared regions in the genome @xcite and to a lesser extent by the influence of weather conditions @xcite .",
    "the bn in figure [ fig : averaged ] identifies @xmath75 snps that are linked to at least one of mil and yr.glass , and may possibly be tagging pleiotropic qtls for disease resistance . by contrasting low and high level of both diseases ( scores @xmath122 and @xmath123 , respectively )",
    ", we can infer which allele may be linked with resistance to both diseases using the conditional expected allele counts , @xmath124 and @xmath125 . for @xmath126 of the @xmath75 genes",
    "the difference between the two is marked : g418 ( bobwhite_c5756_516 ; @xmath127 , @xmath128 ) , g311 ( bobwhite_c37358_208 ; @xmath129 , @xmath130 ) and g1217 ( bs00062679_51 ; @xmath131 , @xmath130 ) .",
    "the 90k consensus map in @xcite locates g418 in chromosome 2d along with other snps conferring resistance to yr.glass . the same is true also for g311 in chromosome 2b , and for g2127 in chromosome 2a . as for the other @xmath76 snps , @xmath132 , which suggests that their individual effects are small and that they might work in concert with other genes producing polygenic effects .",
    "similar analyses on the other traits identify two more snps with @xmath133 that may be tagging known genes .",
    "g1896 ( excalibur_c19078_210 ) has @xmath134 , @xmath135 when contrasting top and bottom quartiles for ht ; and has @xmath136 , @xmath130 when contrasting the bottom quartile of ht and @xmath137 with the top quartile of ht and @xmath138 .",
    "the latter pair of scenarios is motivated by the fact that taller plants are less susceptible to fusarium than shorter plants .",
    "the ld analysis in @xcite suggests that this snp is located in chromosome 4d in this population , and that it may be tagging _",
    "rht - d1b _ , a dwarfing gene which is also closely associated with resistance to fusarium @xcite .",
    "in addition , g266 ( bobwhite_c30043_150 ) appears to be located in chromosome 2d and to be tagging _",
    "ppd - d1 _ , which controls photoperiod response .",
    "contrasting the bottom quartiles of both ft and ht with the top quartiles we have @xmath139 and @xmath131 .",
    "modeling multiple quantitative traits simultaneously has been known to result in better predictive power than targeting one trait at a time in the context of additive genetic models @xcite .",
    "bns provide a general framework to estimate and analyze such models .",
    "they also provide an accompanying graphical representation that is intuitive yet rigorous ; a plot such as that in figure [ fig : averaged ] can be very useful for exploratory analysis , to disseminate results and to motivate further quantitative and qualitative analyses in gwas and gs studies .    from a theoretical point of view , bns are more versatile than additive models in common use . by assuming variables are normally distributed",
    ", we have shown that bns are in fact equivalent to multivariate gblup and , by extension of single - trait gblup .",
    "furthermore , the separation between structure and parameter learning makes it possible to accommodate different parametric assumptions with relatively few changes , and subsume models such as univariate and multivariate ridge - regression @xcite .",
    "as far as inference is concerned , several established methods from the literature can be used to predict traits from snps and vice versa ; two examples are logic sampling and likelihood weighting @xcite . both allow to explore complex scenarios of practical relevance by estimating informative statistics from the corresponding conditional distributions of traits and snps .",
    "this is made easier by the lack of a formal distinction between response and explanatory variables in the bn , which is central in traditional linear models . as a result",
    ", bns can be used for association studies as well as genomic prediction . in the former , we can condition on some complex combination of traits and predict the expected allele counts of snps .",
    "such an approach has the potential of detecting which snps tag relevant qtls and which of their alleles are favourable .",
    "in the latter , we have shown that bns are competitive with a state - of - the - art model such as single - trait enet when predicting traits from snps , and that they outperform single - trait gblup for the population analysed in this paper . as evidenced by the difference between @xmath66 and @xmath67 , using bns as a multi - trait model and performing predictions based on those variables identified as putative causal for each trait outperforms enet as well by leveraging pleiotropic effects @xcite .",
    "this shows it is possible to improve genomic selection for traits that are expensive to measure by incorporating cheaper ones in the predictions .",
    "clearly , the impact of correlated phenotypes on the predictive power of bns depends on the strength of their correlation .    based on the bn in figure [ fig : averaged ]",
    ", we can also observe some interesting properties of bns as genetic models .",
    "firstly , the difference in the number of snps included in the bns compared to the enet models can be attributed to the limited ability of bns to capture small epistatic effects @xcite .",
    "consider , for instance , a polygenic effect in which two snps are jointly associated with a trait but in which each snp is not significant on its own .",
    "such an effect will not be captured because both snps will be discarded by the single - snp screening performed at the beginning of feature selection .",
    "as observed in other studies , this does not have a significant impact on predictive ability if a large enough @xmath140 threshold is used , as markov blankets are very effective at feature selection @xcite .",
    "secondly , snps with pleiotropic effects are included in the bn even when association with a single phenotype is detected ; at that point they can be linked to all relevant phenotypes .",
    "this is the case of the snps controlling resistance to both mildew and yellow rust discussed above .",
    "furthermore , direct and indirect effects of such snps and of traits are correctly separated for the observed traits , as in the case of the fusarium effect on yield .",
    "magic populations provide an ideal starting point for fitting bns . on the one hand , the particular pattern of crosses used to produce a magic population results in a very low population structure .",
    "this reduces the confounding effect of relatedness on the estimation of snp effects @xcite and on mapping approaches based on ld @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the size of of the population is large enough to detect weak associations and associations with rare variants . both are in fact present in the averaged bn , which includes snps with minor allele frequencies as low as @xmath95 and snps which are significant ( e.g. for mil and yr.glass ) only when considering multiple traits at the same time .",
    "finally , snps of interest can be made to segregate in the population by choosing the founders appropriately , since balanced crosses ensure opportunities for recombination among the founders .",
    "this is particularly important in modeling multiple phenotypes , as we need to ensure as many relevant qtls and genes as possible are tagged to correctly dissect their genetic layout .",
    "the work presented in this paper forms part of the midrib project , which is funded by the uk technology strategy board ( tsb ) and biotechnology & biological sciences research council ( bbsrc ) , grant ts / i002170/1 .",
    "the magic population was developed within bbsrc crop science initiative project bb / e007201/1 .",
    "field trials and snp genotyping were funded by the niab trust ."
