    "throughout the previous decades experimental cosmology has benefited from accurate measurements of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) .",
    "the data have determined constraints on several cosmological parameters to remarkable accuracy and the ability to constrain new physics with the cmb continues to improve .",
    "future cmb experiments might even be able to measure b - mode polarization and distinguish between neutrino hierarchy models . however , when constraining new parameters one must be careful when constraints depend on assumptions about the underlying cosmology .",
    "for example , a correlation between the neutrino properties and the curvature of the universe is clearly expected since , a higher number of neutrino species or large mass would introduce pre - recombination effects , shifting the positions of the peaks in the angular cmb spectrum ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) .    here",
    "we present an update on the constraints of the number of neutrino species @xmath0 and the sum of neutrino masses @xmath9 in the framework of non - flat universes with @xmath10 combining the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) 7-year  @xcite , south pole telescope ( spt )  @xcite and atacama cosmology telescope ( act )  @xcite datasets .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : theory ] we give theoretical arguments for why the @xmath0 and @xmath2 parameters should be correlated . in section  [ sec : method ] we discuss our method of constraining the parameters @xmath0 , @xmath9 , and @xmath2 .",
    "we present the results of the analysis in section  [ sec : imp ] .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : conclusion ] we conclude and discuss the implications of assuming flatness in neutrino cosmology .",
    "the effective neutrino number @xmath0 is defined as the contribution of neutrinos to the relativistic degrees of freedom @xmath11 . in a standard physics scenario the particles contributing to the total value of @xmath12 are electrons , three neutrinos ( and their antiparticles ) , and photons .",
    "any extra relativistic degrees of freedom can be parameterized in terms of an excess with respect to the standard effective neutrino number @xmath13 ( which more precisely is @xmath14 after accounting for qed corrections and non - instantaneous decoupling of neutrinos )  @xcite .",
    "the neutrino energy density is : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the energy density of photons . a first effect of @xmath0 is related to the primordial helium abundance @xmath17 .",
    "changing @xmath0 affects the freeze - out temperature @xmath18 during bbn and therefore the final neutron to proton ratio @xmath19  @xcite .",
    "larger @xmath0 means earlier freeze - out , larger @xmath19 , and larger @xmath20 .",
    "the effect of @xmath0 on cosmological observables ( e.g. cmb anisotropy power spectrum and galaxy power spectrum ) is emphasized by the epoch of matter - radiation equality @xmath21 . in particular , for what concern the cmb , an increase in @xmath21 changes the extent of the early integrated sachs - wolfe effect .",
    "the relation between @xmath21 and @xmath0 is given by equating energy densities : @xmath22 this shows a linear relationship for @xmath23 , which transfers to the baryon to photon ratio at equality  @xcite : @xmath24 the presence of baryons in the relativistic cosmic fluid slows down the sound speed according to the definition , @xmath25 and so this quantity is also affected at equality by the effective neutrino number .",

    "more exotic solutions may include arguments supporting modified dark energy models  @xcite . in this work",
    "we explore possible overlooked parameter degeneracies that could still favor the standard model without the introduction of new physics . in  @xcite",
    "the authors provide qualitative arguments for how changing the number of allowed neutrinos affects the observed values of parameters .",
    "one example which we use is the relative dependence of distance measurements on the hubble constant .",
    "in fact , the sound horizon at recombination scales as @xmath61 while the distance a photon typically diffuses prior to its last scattering goes as @xmath62 .",
    "this is significant because the response of the radiation relative to matter determines the degree of damping prior to recombination .",
    "in other words , with @xmath63 fixed by observation , the angular diameter distance , @xmath64 , must also decrease as @xmath65 which is more rapid than @xmath66 .",
    "thus , the damping increases according to @xmath67  @xcite .",
    "if these distances vary according to @xmath68 then they also vary according to any parameter correlated with @xmath68 . in an open universe with nonzero curvature",
    "the effective neutrino number is slightly reduced .",
    "the theory confirms this because as stated above @xmath69 is constrained by observation which means if @xmath0 is reduced and @xmath70 then @xmath29 and @xmath64 both increase ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : rsneff ] ) .",
    "however , if the parameter space favors a closed universe then there will appear to be a higher number of effective neutrinos .",

    "we conclude this section by stating our purpose further constrain the neutrino mass and investigate the effect of curvature on this parameter . finally , we acknowledge that there are many papers on the subject of constraining neutrino parameters .",

    "in order to fit cosmological models to data we use a modified version of the publicly available cosmomc software package  @xcite . this uses a monte carlo markov chain analysis on calculations of the lensed cmb power spectrum made with the camb package .",
    "our analysis combines the following cmb anisotropy datasets : wmap 7-year  @xcite , spt  @xcite , and act  @xcite . including bao+@xmath30 simply means we are using the baryon acoustic oscillation ( bao ) data of percival _ et al . _",
    "@xcite and impose a prior on the hubble parameter based on the last hubble space telescope observations  @xcite .",
    "we integrate spectral data out to @xmath71 .",
    "we sample from the following parameters : the baryon  @xmath72 , cold dark matter  @xmath36 , and dark  @xmath41 energy densities , the scalar spectral index  @xmath45 , the optical depth to reionization  @xmath26 , the hubble parameter  @xmath30 , and the amplitude of sz spectrum  @xmath73 .",
    "we also consider the effective neutrino number  @xmath0 , spatial curvature  @xmath2 , and the sum of neutrino masses  @xmath1 .",
    "finally , we make decisions specific to the high multipole mode data .",
    "we consider purely adiabatic initial conditions . when the background data are taken to small enough scales the spectra from infrared source emission must be taken into account .",
    "the ir spectra is dominated by poisson power partially from source emission clustering at the smallest scales .",
    "thus , a model for such effects must be subtracted out from the cmb power spectra .",
    "the resulting adaptations are representative of the considerations made during the process of checking the code for consistency with established results .",
    "it is also important to include a big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) consistency check during the sampling in order to provide analysis consistent with helium abundance measurements , as proposed in refs .",
    "we remark that the act collaboration did not include the same bbn consistency condition used by spt and our analysis .",
    "this explains why we find a slightly better constraint on @xmath0 than ref .",
    "@xcite .",

    "[ fig : omkvneff ] demonstrates the correlation between @xmath2 and @xmath0 , which agrees with the prediction from section  [ sec : theory ] .",
    "interestingly , the effect of the additional cmb datasets ( act and spt ) increases the correlation between these parameters with respect to wmap 7-year data alone .",
    "this may be due in part to the considerable improvement in @xmath0 whereas the uncertainty in the curvature is not noticeably improved by the addition of small scale anisotropy measurements .",
    "these results suggest that an open universe with fewer neutrinos would look similar to a flat universe with more neutrinos .",
    "we also note that when including @xmath0 as a free parameter in the @xmath80cdm+@xmath2 model , the @xmath81 constraint of @xmath82 found in ref .",
    "@xcite does not deteriorate significantly for the same combination of datasets ( i.e. wmap+bao+@xmath30 ) .",
    "this is due to the presence of the bao data and the @xmath30 prior in the analysis , since both probes are sensitive to the geometry of the universe .",

    "furthermore , the degeneracy considerably increases the uncertainty in the sum of the neutrino masses .",
    "in fact , with @xmath10 the @xmath6 upper limit on @xmath1 more than doubles with respect to the flat case : with @xmath8 ev for the model assuming only three massive neutrinos and @xmath125 ev for @xmath116 . the strong correlation between curvature and mass",
