    "<S> these branes have very rich inner structure . in this paper , by presenting the mass - independent potentials of kaluza  </S>",
    "<S> klein ( kk ) modes in the corresponding schrdinger equations , we investigate the localization and mass spectra of fermions on the symmetric and asymmetric thick branes in an ads background . in order to analyze the effect of gravity - fermion interaction ( i.e. , the effect of the inner structure of the branes ) and scalar - fermion interaction to the spectrum of fermion kk modes , we consider three kinds of typical kink - fermion couplings . </S>",
    "<S> the spectra of left chiral fermions for these couplings are consisted of a bound zero mode and a series of gapless continuous massive kk modes , some discrete bound kk modes including zero mode ( exist mass gaps ) and a series of continuous massive kk modes , infinite discrete bound kk modes , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the structures of the spectra are investigated in detail . </S>"
