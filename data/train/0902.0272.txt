    "although with high @xmath0 , the plasma contribution is small comparing to the force - free part , making the overall solution near force - free .",
    "the reason for this near force - free solution to confine plasmas is that it relies basically on the tensional force of the magnetic field line curvature , not the scalar magnetic pressure , to balance the plasma pressure .",
    "this curvature is evident because the magnetic axis where @xmath71 is significantly displaced from the maximum of @xmath82 .",
    "for this reason , the magnetic field profile remains near force - free , while plasmas are confined .",
    "such strong curvature is inherent from low aspect ratio plasmas .",
