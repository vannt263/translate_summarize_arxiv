    "the existence of an initial singularity in the standard cosmological model is one of the most important problems to be treated by a theory of gravity .",
    "this problem comes together with the existence of singularities in the spherical solutions of general relativity ( gr ) , connected with the notion of black holes .",
    "but , while in the black hole case the singularity is covered by an event horizon , being inaccessible to an external observer , the cosmological singularity does not have such kind of protection , and the emergence of the universe from a singular state renders the initial conditions of the universe quite arbitrary and , strictly speaking , unpredictable .",
    "the existence of singularities in general relativity is related to the so - called energy conditions @xcite that any ordinary matter should satisfy .",
    "classically , the initial cosmological singularity can be avoided by introducing ad - hoc fluids that violate the energy conditions .",
    "this may even imply to consider a phase where the total energy density is negative ( violation of the weak energy condition ) or a negative pressure such that @xmath0 ( violation of null energy condition ) .",
    "another possibility is a modified theory of gravity , like scalar - tensor theories or non - linear lagrangians .",
    "quantum effects may lead to the appearance of negative energy states , as it happens in the casimir effect @xcite .",
    "such fact gives the hope that the construction of a quantum theory of gravity may solve the singularities problem of general relativity .",
    "one possible modification of the classical theory of gravity is given by rastall s theory @xcite .",
    "in this theory the usual conservation law represented by the zero divergence of the energy - momentum tensor is given up ; instead , the divergence of the energy - momentum tensor is related to the ricci curvature scalar .",
    "the main argument in favor of such proposal is that the usual conservation laws connected with the divergence of the energy - momentum tensor are tested only in the minkowski space - time ( more specifically , in a weak field limit ) . even if rastall s theory is incomplete , in the sense that it lacks a lagrangian formulation ( at least in the context of the riemaniann geometry )",
    ", it has an interesting feature : it reproduces in a quite phenomenological way , but in an explicit covariant form , a distinguishing property of quantum effects in gravity systems , the violation of the classical conservation laws @xcite . in this way",
    ", rastall s theory may be viewed as a classical , phenomenological way to implement some concepts that are typical of a quantum theory of gravity . while rastall s theory has already been studied in the context of the present evolution of the universe @xcite , its application to the primordial universe is still lacking .",
    "it is generally expected that quantum effects may lead to the avoidance of the initial singularity through , for example , a bounce phase which may connect the present expansion phase of the universe to a primordial contracting phase .",
    "such bouncing solutions appear in the context of string theory @xcite and quantum cosmology @xcite .",
    "loop quantum cosmology is one of the most interesting proposal in the direction of applying quantum gravity to cosmology @xcite .",
    "one of its main results is the modification of friedmann s equation leading to , @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the hubble parameter , @xmath3 is the density , and @xmath4 is a constant characteristic density that defines a possible bounce .",
    "this last term is absent in the usual friedmann s equation and formally it corresponds to the effect of negative energy densities .",
    "this structure must , in principle , lead to singularity - free model .",
    "a class of oscillating , non singular solutions has been determined , for example , in reference @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we intend to study a rastall s primordial universe model that can mimic the effects represented in eq .",
    "( [ qe ] ) .",
    "this can be achieved by considering a specific equation of state in the context of rastall s theory .",
    "we show that bouncing solutions do emerge , but other possible scenarios appear .",
    "we will try to classify all possible solutions , by explicit integration of the equations , using a dynamical system approach .",
    "this work may be understood as a first step in verifying if rastall s theory may lead to consistent cosmological scenarios , which can be tested against observations as it has been done with string effective action @xcite .",
    "more fundamentally , such analysis , complemented by a perturbative study , may shed light if indeed rastall s theory can be considered as a classical , effective formulation of quantum cosmological models resulting from loop quantum cosmology , as we have freely speculated above .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : presprobl ] , we present rastall s cosmology and introduce a suitable equation of state for the primordial phase . in sec .  [",
    "sec : intpartcas ] , we find explicit solutions for the scale factor and the energy density , for some particular combinations of the parameters of theory which render the equations exactly solvable . in sec .",
    "[ sec : dynsist ] , we perform a dynamical system analysis of the bounce solution . finally , we present our conclusions in sec .  [",
    "sec : concl ] .",
    "rastall s theory is based on the following coupled equations @xcite : @xmath5 i.e. einstein equations properly modified in order to account for a non - conservation of the stress - energy tensor ( recall that bianchi identities are still valid ) . for @xmath6 ,",

    "hereafter , we suppose a flat universe @xmath10 in order to simplify the calculations .",
    "observation also supports a flat or nearly flat universe @xcite .",

    "this result is quite curious , because such behavior does not depend on @xmath33 or @xmath34 , which are free parameters .    as for the sign in the parenthesis of eq .  , considering @xmath35 , there are three possibilities : @xmath36 with the minus sign ; @xmath14 with again the minus sign and @xmath14 with the plus sign ( @xmath36 with the plus sign would result in a negative energy density ) . in the first situation ,",

    "it is important to realize that , since @xmath62 , here we can not obtain the gr limit , since it would require @xmath63 .",
    "there are two main cases :    1 .",
    "if @xmath59 , then @xmath57 and @xmath34 are positive . in this case , the scale factor decreases with time and vice - versa the density increases with time .",
    "note that if @xmath64 , in order to have a positive energy density we must have @xmath65^{\\gamma - 1}$ ] , which is impossible from eq .  .",
    "therefore , the case @xmath64 is excluded . on the other hand , if @xmath66 , the scale factor varies from infinity ( @xmath67 ) to zero at a certain finite time .",
    "correspondingly , the density is always positive and grows from @xmath68 to infinity .",
    "this behavior is somehow reverted with respect to the one of standard cosmology .",

    "correspondingly , the energy density varies from zero ( @xmath67 ) to zero ( @xmath71 ) , with a maximum value @xmath84 at @xmath85 .",
    "+ if @xmath80 , but @xmath14 , then the range @xmath86 is no more allowed because it would correspond to an imaginary scale factor and density .",
    "there are two disconnected evolution : in the first @xmath12 varies from minus infinity to the negative value which nullifies the expression between parenthesis in eq .",

    "2 .   if @xmath87 , then @xmath88 , but @xmath89 is negative . if @xmath14 there is no way out , the scale factor and the density become imaginary .",
    "therefore , we can only consider @xmath36 .",
    "the time @xmath12 can not go to @xmath90 , but only varies between the roots ( finite ) of the expression between parenthesis in eq .  .",

    "correspondingly , the energy density varies from infinity to infinity with a minimum @xmath84 at @xmath85 .",
    "3 .   if @xmath35 , then @xmath57 and @xmath89 are positive . if @xmath14 , the scale factor varies from infinity ( @xmath67 ) to infinity ( @xmath71 ) with a minimum value @xmath91^{\\gamma - 1}$ ] and the energy density from zero to zero with a maximum value @xmath92 .",
    "this is a proper bouncing cosmology , connecting two asymptotic minkowski universes .",
    "if @xmath36 , we have again two disconnected evolutions . in the first @xmath12",

    "the scale factor varies from zero to infinity and the energy density from infinity to zero .",
    "note that in order to have a bouncing solution it is necessary a very strict relation between the constants @xmath33 ( which comes from the equation of state ) and @xmath93 ( which is a parameter of rastall s theory ) .",
    "it can be interpreted as a dependence of the violation of the conservation law on the fluid properties . in the scenario of point 3 above , after the bounce the universe starts to expand with a positive second time derivative of the scale factor ( i.e. the expansion is accelerated ) , see eq .  .",
    "this is an inflationary phase which resembles power law inflation models . for bouncing models of the universe",
    ", inflation is not in general necessary since , for example , there is no causality problem , being the universe eternal . on the other hand ,",
    "the behavior of quantum fluctuations during this period and their link with the emerging primordial matter power spectrum are complicated issues which deserve more profound investigation .",
    "see also @xcite .      if @xmath95 , then the first term in eq .",
    "( [ g2 ] ) disappears , and thus , it simplifies to @xmath96 it is interesting to notice that this equation may be seen as a particular case of eq .",
    "( [ c41 ] ) when @xmath97 . in spite of that",
    ", there is no bouncing behavior in the present situation , since the supposition that @xmath19 was crucial in order to obtain the result in the case @xmath98 .",
    "this means that case @xmath99 may be considered as a degenerate form of case @xmath98 .",
    "it should be noticed that , from the results of cases @xmath100 and @xmath99 , the scale factor behaves according to @xmath101 whenever @xmath97 , independently on @xmath33 e @xmath34 ( that means , independently on the behavior of the fluid ) .",
    "this fact is even more curious because it coincides with the evolution of the scale factor in standard cosmology for a radiation - dominated universe ( this could be explained by the fact that in both cases the trace of the stress - energy tensor is vanishing ) .",
    "however , the density will behave differently , depending on whether @xmath19 or @xmath23 .      in this case , eq .",

    "<S> rastall s theory is a modification of einstein s theory of gravity where the covariant divergence of the stress - energy tensor is no more vanishing , but proportional to the gradient of the ricci scalar . </S>",
    "<S> the motivation of this theory is to investigate a possible non - minimal coupling of the matter fields to geometry which , being proportional to the curvature scalar , may represent an effective description of quantum gravity effects . </S>",
    "<S> non - conservation of the stress - energy tensor , via bianchi identities , implies new field equations which have been recently used in a cosmological context , leading to some interesting results . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we adopt rastall s theory to reproduce some features of the effective friedmann s equation emerging from loop quantum cosmology . </S>",
    "<S> we determine a class of bouncing cosmological solutions and comment about the possibility of employing these models as effective descriptions of the full quantum theory . </S>"
