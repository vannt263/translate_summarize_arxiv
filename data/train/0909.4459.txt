    "massive stars are the main contributors to the input of ionizing photons , energy , and momentum into the interstellar medium and are responsible for a significant fraction of the chemical enrichment of their host galaxy .",
    "evolutionary models predict the existence of a short - lived , transitional stage , usually referred to as the luminous blue variable ( lbv ) phase @xcite , characterized by a high mass - loss rate ( @xmath7 @xmath8 ) . in the current picture of stellar evolution ,",
    "lbvs are rapidly - evolving massive stars in the transitory phase from being an o - type star burning hydrogen in its core to becoming a wolf - rayet ( wr ) type , helium core - burning star @xcite .",
    "there is strong evidence that very massive stars lose the bulk of their mass through giant outbursts during the lbv phase @xcite , similar to the one that occurred in eta carinae in the 1840 s .",
    "surprisingly , recent works suggest that some core - collapse supernovae ( sne ) have lbv progenitors ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which not only dramatically enhances the cosmological importance of lbvs but also poses a great challenge to the current paradigm of massive star evolution .",
    "lbvs are rare : only a dozen or so are known in the galaxy , and roughly only three of them , namely ag carinae , hr carinae , and wra 751 , are confirmed strong - variable lbvs @xcite .",
    "these stars have been observed for a sufficiently long time to establish a record of strong photometric and spectroscopic variability which shows , undoubtedly , that both strong s dor - type variability and a circumstellar nebula are present .",
    "the spectroscopic and photometric behavior of these strong - variable lbvs are markedly different compared to other stars which are usually regarded as dormant lbvs , such as p cygni and eta carinae @xcite .",
    "ag car , hr car , and wra 751 are unstable and present cyclical strong s dor - type variability characterized by irregular visual magnitude changes on timescales of decades , with a typical amplitude of @xmath9 mag , and corresponding changes in effective temperature and hydrostatic radius @xcite . during visual minimum ,",
    "the star is typically hot , while at visual maximum , a cooler effective temperature is obtained ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "how the s dor - type variability relates to the powerful giant eruptions is not clear , although it could be possible that a relatively large amount of stellar mass , which is not ejected from the star , is taking part in the s dor - type variability ( @xcite ; hereafter ghd09 ) .",
    "this would suggest that the s dor - type variability is a _ failed _ giant eruption .",
    "at least for ag car , two additional pieces of the puzzle are known : a significant reduction ( @xmath10 ) in the inferred bolometric luminosity from visual minimum to maximum has been determined , and a high rotational velocity has been obtained during minimum ( @xcite ; hereafter ghd06 ) . whether the same is true for other bona - fide lbvs , such as hr car , still remains to be seen .",
    "in this letter we report photometric and spectroscopic observations of the bona - fide lbv hr car obtained during 2009 (   [ hrcobs ] ) , showing that the star has entered a visual minimum phase of the s - dor cycle .",
    "more importantly , we detected absorptions related to the high - excitation lines of  @xmath040884116 in hr car .",
    "the results of our non - lte spectroscopic modeling using the radiative transfer code cmfgen are presented in   [ modres ] .",
    "they suggest a photospheric nature for these lines , that hr car has high rotational velocity ( @xmath6 ) , and that @xmath6 is very high compared to the critical rotational velocity for break - up ( @xmath4 ) . in   [ disc ] we discuss the importance of such a detection for understanding the lbv phase and the subsequent evolution of very massive stars .",
    "optical ccd @xmath11-band photometry of hr car was compiled from the asas-3 database @xcite and averaged in bins of 15 days , with only high - quality ( grade a ) data being used .",
    "the asas-3 magnitudes were measured using a large aperture ( 75 ) , but hr car is by far the dominant source of light in the field .",
    "we estimate that the typical error of the 15-day averaged @xmath11-band magnitude is 0.03 mag .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] presents the @xmath11-band lightcurve of hr car from 20012009 , showing that a significant increase of 1.5 mag occurred in this time span and that hr car has entered a visual minimum phase of the s - dor cycle .",

    "high - resolution spectra ( @xmath14 ) were gathered using the fiber - fed extended range optical spectrograph ( feros ; @xcite ) mounted on the 2.2-m telescope of the max - planck - gesellschaft / european southern observatory ( mpg / eso , chile ) .",

    "in the case of the prototypical lbv ag car , the relatively broad absorptions due to @xmath12 are caused by the extremely fast rotation , @xmath16 .",
    "here we also use these lines to derive the rotational velocity of hr car , performing a detailed spectroscopic analysis similar to , using the radiative transfer code cmfgen @xcite and the two - dimensional ( 2-d ) code of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter bh05 ) .",
    "cmfgen solves the statistical equilibrium equations simultaneously to the radiative transfer in the co - moving frame of the outflow , in spherical symmetry , and assuming steady state .",
    "the code computes line and continuum formation in the non - lte regime , and each model is specified by the stellar luminosity @xmath17 and effective temperature @xmath18 ) . ] , the wind mass - loss rate @xmath19 , volume filling factor @xmath20 , and terminal velocity @xmath21 , and the chemical abundances @xmath22 of the included species .",
    "since the momentum equation of the wind is not solved , a beta - type velocity law is adopted and modified at depth to smoothly match a hydrostatic structure at @xmath23 .",
    "the hydrostatic equation is iterated in order to produce a quasi - hydrostatic structure which extends inwards until the inner boundary of the model ( at a rosseland optical depth of 100 ) .",
    "line blanketing is fully taken into account , and our models include tens of thousands of spectral lines in non - lte . the atomic model used for hr car is similar to the one used for ag car and included lines of h , he , c , n , o , na , mg , al , si , cr , mn , fe , co , and ni .    we assumed a depth - independent turbulent velocity of 20kms@xmath24 in the computation of the observed spectrum , which is an upper limit , since a higher turbulent velocity would yield a detectable redshift , which is not observed , of the emission lines with high opacity , such as the stronger lines of and .",
    "therefore , microturbulence can not explain the broadening seen in the high - ionization @xmath0 40884116 lines , and we suggest these lines to be rotationally broadened ( note that other broadening mechanisms , such as convection or other kind of surface activity , have yet to be detected in lbvs and , thus , are not expected to be present in ag car , although our data do not rule them out ) .",
    "the effects of rotation on the line profiles were investigated using the code , which allows the computation of the spectrum in 2-d geometry for a given inclination angle @xmath25 .",
    "no equatorial or polar density enhancements were taken into account , since our goal was to investigate the broadening of the photospheric lines .",
    "therefore , we computed a grid of synthetic line profiles with a stellar rotational velocity ranging from 0 to @xmath26 in increments of 5  @xmath27 , and a best fit was obtained by visual inspection .",
    "we assume that the stellar rotational axis of hr car is aligned with the polar axis of its bipolar nebula , which is inclined at @xmath28 @xcite .    in a dense stellar wind ,",
    "ionization stratification occurs , and lines from ions of different ionization potentials will form at different distances @xmath29 from the star .",
    "the @xmath12 lines are the highest ionization lines present in the optical spectrum of hr car and , therefore , should be formed closest to the stellar photosphere . since the azimuthal velocity component is proportional to @xmath30 ,",
    "@xmath12 are ideal for deriving the rotational velocity of hr car .",
    "our modeling shows that other optical lines which are ocasionally seen in absorption in lbv spectra , such as @xmath31 and @xmath32 , are actually formed in the wind of hr car , far from the stellar photosphere . as a consequence ,",
    "their broadening is dominated by the wind velocity field ( see discussion in and ) .",
    "figure [ fig3 ] compares the absorption profiles of @xmath0 40884116 observed in 2009 may 03 ( which has the highest signal - to - noise ratio and spectral resolution of our sample ) with our best cmfgen model , which has the following parameters : @xmath33 ( assuming a@xmath34 and @xmath35  kpc , @xcite ) , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , he / h=@xmath39 ( by number ) , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 . in a forthcoming full paper",
    "we will present the results of the detailed spectroscopic analysis of hr  car during minimum , including diagnostics for each of the parameters assumed above . nevertheless , for reasonable changes in the above parameters , the derived rotational velocity of hr  car changes only slightly and the conclusions of this letter remain valid .",
    "similar to ag car , the observed absorption profiles of both lines are significantly broader and shallower than the non - rotating model .",
    "our model predicts that the lines are formed very close to the stellar photosphere , where the wind is still accelerating and , therefore , the line broadening caused by the wind velocity field is negligible .",
    "consequently , most of the line broadening should be due to rotation . according to our rotating models computed with the code , a rotational velocity of @xmath1",
    "is required to reproduce the observed shape of the @xmath040884116 lines in hr car ( fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) .    how does the rotational velocity of hr car compare to its critical velocity for break - up ?",
    "an estimation of @xmath4 can be calculated following @xcite once the stellar mass @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and the eddington parameter @xmath47 are known .",
    "the critical parameter for obtaining a precise value of @xmath48 is @xmath44 , which can be estimated based on the evolutionary models from @xcite .",
    "such models predict that , based on our derived value of @xmath33 , the initial mass of hr car should have been roughly @xmath49 .",
    "while there are no evolutionary models available in the literature specifically for @xmath50 , we estimate that stars such as hr car will reach the lbv phase with @xmath51 , since evolutionary models predict that a @xmath52 star reaches the lbv phase with 20  @xmath53 , while a @xmath54 star reaches the lbv phase with @xmath55 @xcite .",
    "assuming an admittedly uncertain @xmath56 , our cmfgen model of hr car predicts @xmath57 , and we derive @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "therefore , similar to ag car , hr car is also likely rotating very close to , if not _ at _ , its critical velocity for break - up .",
    "several theoretical works have long predicted that lbvs should have high rotational velocities ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but direct observational detection through the broadening of spectral lines has been elusive until recently , in particular because high - resolution observations of lbvs in the blue part of the optical spectrum are scarcely available during visual minimum .",
    "the detection of high rotational velocity in two of the most variable lbvs in the galaxy , ag car and now hr car (   [ modres ] ) , raises the obvious question : _ are all lbvs fast rotators ? _    the presence of fast rotation in two out of three of the galactic bona - fide lbvs that have a circumstellar nebula and strong s dor - type variability is probably not a coincidence , and _ we suggest that fast rotation is typical in such stars . _ perhaps , fast rotation might even be a key ingredient for the instability that causes the s - dor cycles in lbvs . if that is true , we should expect that fast rotation is also present during visual minimum in extragalactic lbvs , such as r127 and s doradus in the lmc .",
    "an obvious test case for such a hypothesis would be r127 , which has been undergoing a visual minimum phase since 2007 @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig4 ] presents the position of ag car and hr car in the hr diagram based on their updated stellar parameters obtained in and in this work .",
    "previous works have recognized that , during visual minimum , lbvs are located in a well - defined region of the hr diagram , the so - called  lbv minimum instability strip \" @xcite .",
    "our results suggest that the lbv minimum instability strip is considerably steeper than previously determined , being characterized by @xmath60 - 13.61 ( red dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) . _",
    "more importantly , we suggest that the lbv minimum instability strip corresponds to the region where critical rotation is reached for lbvs with strong s - dor type variability . _",
    "when lbvs are evolving towards maximum , the star moves far from the lbv minimum instability strip ( to the right in the hr diagram ) , and @xmath48 decreases considerably .",
    "the region in the hr diagram on the left side of the lbv minimum instability strip would be populated by unstable lbv stars with @xmath61 , which would make it a  forbidden region \" for lbvs .",
    "indeed , no confirmed strong - variable lbv is seen in this region @xcite .",
    "a corollary of the relationship between s dor - type instability and fast rotation that we suggest in this letter regards sne which likely had an lbv progenitor . some of these lbvs showed evidence for s dor - type variability before exploding as a sn , such as the progenitors of sn 2001ig , sn 2003bg @xcite , and sn 2005gj @xcite .",
    "it could be very likely that these massive stars were fast rotators before exploding .    what about dormant lbvs which have not presented evidence for strong s dor - type variability for a century or more ? from these",
    ", only eta car has shown indirect evidence of fast rotation , through the presence of a latitude - dependent wind @xcite .",
    "interestingly , at least two other confirmed lbvs that do not show s dor - type variability appear to rotate slowly .",
    "p cygni has evidence of a relatively low rotational velocity of @xmath62 @xcite @xcite .",
    "note that this assumption is not crucial for the results of this paper .",
    "] , a property also shared by hd 168625 , for which we measured @xmath63 based on optical photospheric lines and a similar methodology as in the present work ( j. h. groh 2009 , in preparation ) . assuming @xmath64 @xcite",
    ", we obtain @xmath65 . for both p cygni and hd 168625 ,",
    "the critical velocity for break - up should be of the order of 150200  @xmath27 , meaning that @xmath48 should be @xmath660.3 for these stars .",
    "we suggest that lbvs , at least in our galaxy , can be separated into two groups : group i , comprised of fast - rotating , strong - variable lbvs such as ag car and hr car , and group ii , composed of slow - rotating , weak variable lbvs such as p cygni and hd 168625 .",
    "while an lbv can in principle migrate from one subgroup to the other , for instance after a giant eruption , these lbv groups might also follow different evolutionary paths during and after the lbv phase , possibly yielding significantly different sn progenitors .",
    "in particular , fast - rotating lbvs might struggle to lose enough angular momentum through winds and giant eruptions .",
    "fast - rotating stars are supposed to have a latitude - dependent , polar - enhanced wind @xcite which , depending on the mass - loss rate , will not remove as much angular momentum as in the case of a spherical wind ( see discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , lbvs might not lose enough angular momentum during giant outbursts , similar to the one that occurred in eta car in the 1840 s , since almost 75% of the mass was lost at latitudes higher than @xmath67 @xcite .",
    "although current evolutionary models predict that fast - rotating lbvs should spin - down @xcite , the models do not include angular momentum and mass losses through a giant outburst , which is a key factor during the lbv phase @xcite . in the galaxy , there are at least three examples of stars which had a giant eruption , lost significantly amounts of mass ( several @xmath53 ) , but are still currently fast rotators : eta car @xcite , ag car @xcite , and hr car ( this work ) .    as a consequence ,",
    "if fast - rotating lbvs are to evolve to wr stars without losing enough angular momentum , they would produce a population of significantly fast - rotating wr stars , which is yet unseen in the galaxy for the wn5 star hd 193077 , based on broad absorptions due to high balmer and lines .",
    "however , @xcite proposed that hd193077 is a wr+o binary and that the broad absorption lines are formed in the o star .",
    "even if the absorption lines were formed in the wr wind , they should be formed sufficiently far from the hydrostatic core that the broadening would be dominated by the wind acceleration . ] and not predicted by evolutionary models @xcite .",
    "an alternative evolutionary path would be that lbvs could fail to lose an additional significant amount of mass and thus , instead of becoming a wolf - rayet star , would dramatically explode as a core - collapse supernova anytime during the lbv phase ( e.g , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we suggest that the potential difficulty of fast - rotating galactic lbvs to lose angular momentum is an additional evidence that lbvs such as ag car and hr car could explode during the lbv phase .",
