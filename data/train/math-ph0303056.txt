    "in the mathematical framework of quantum information theory @xcite , all admissible devices are modelled by the so - called quantum operations @xcite  that is , completely positive linear contractions on the algebra of observables of the physical system under consideration .",
    "thus it is of paramount importance to have at one s disposal a good analysis toolkit for completely positive ( cp ) maps .",
    "there are many useful structure theorems for cp maps .",
    "the two best known ones , due to stinespring @xcite and kraus @xcite , are _ de rigueur _ in virtually all quantum information - theoretic treatments .",
    "these theorems are significant because each of them states that a given map is cp if and only if it is expressible in a certain canonical form . however ,",
    "in many applications we need to consider whole families of cp maps .",
    "this necessitates the introduction of comparison tools for cp maps , e.g. , when the family of cp maps in question admits some sort of ( partial ) order .",
    "mathematically , the set of all cp maps between two algebras of observables is a cone that can be partially ordered in the following natural way . if @xmath1 and @xmath0 are two cp maps , we write @xmath3 if @xmath4 is cp as well .",
    "this partial order comes up in , e.g. , the problem of distinguishing between two known cp maps with given _ a priori _ probabilities under the constraint that the average probability of error is minimized @xcite .",
    "a typical way of dealing with partially ordered cones is to exhibit a correspondence between the cone s order and a partial order of some `` simpler '' objects .",
    "this is accomplished by means of theorems of the radon - nikodym type , as in the case of , e.g. , partial ordering of positive measures or positive linear functionals .",
    "there are a number of radon - nikodym theorems for cp maps ( see , e.g. , the work of arveson @xcite , belavkin and staszewski @xcite , davies @xcite , holevo @xcite , ozawa @xcite , and parthasarathy @xcite ) that differ widely in scope and in generality .",
    "thus , the results of davies , ozawa , and holevo have to do with radon - nikodym derivatives of cp instruments @xcite with respect to scalar measures .",
    "on the other hand , ideas common to the arveson and belavkin - staszewski theorems , with further developments by parthasarathy , are directly applicable to the partial ordering of cp maps described above , and will therefore be the focus of the present article . more specifically , we will demonstrate that certain problems encountered in quantum information - theoretic settings that involve characterization and comparison of cp maps , are best understood in this radon - nikodym framework .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we summarize the salient facts on cp maps and quantum operations in section [ sec : prelims ] . in section [ sec : rnt ]",
    "we review the arveson - belavkin - staszewski formulation of the radon - nikodym theorem for cp maps and state several alternative , but equivalent , versions .",
    "the radon - nikodym machinery is then applied to the following problems : partial ordering of quantum operations ( section [ sec : poqo ] ) , characterization of quantum operations by means of positive operators ( section [ sec : cqopo ] ) , and estimating norms of differences of cp maps ( section [ sec : norms ] ) . finally some concluding remarks are made in section [ sec : rems ] .",

    "since all ( bounded ) operators on a finite - dimensional hilbert space are trace - class , @xmath73 trivially extends to a cp map from @xmath583 into @xmath17 .",
    "in this article we have shown that the radon - nikodym theorem for completely positive maps @xcite is an extremely powerful and versatile tool for problems involving characterization and comparison of quantum operations .",
    "the upshot is that if @xmath584 is the canonical stinespring dilation of a cp map @xmath0 , then the set of all cp maps @xmath1 for which @xmath2 is also cp ( we say that @xmath1 is _ completely dominated _ by @xmath0 ) is in a one - to - one correspondence with the positive contractions @xmath585 on @xmath30 , given explicitly by @xmath231 .",
    "as we have demonstrated , this correspondence brings many seemingly unrelated problems into a common framework .    however , many important questions still remain unanswered . for instance , it is not difficult to convert the above `` stinespring form '' of the radon - nikodym theorem into an equivalent `` kraus form '' ( cf .",
    "[ ssec : rnkra ] ) .",
    "the kraus decomposition of a cp map @xmath0 involves at most countably many terms , and all maps @xmath1 completely dominated by @xmath0 can be characterized in terms of positive - definite kernels on the corresponding indexing set . however , it is not clear how to apply this theorem directly to cp maps given in terms of a `` continual '' kraus decomposition ( as in , e.g. , the quantum operational model of gaussian displacement noise @xcite ) .",
    "for example , if @xmath586 is a strongly continuous unitary representation of a compact topological group @xmath250 on a hilbert space @xmath18 , how do we describe all cp maps completely dominated by the channel @xmath587 where @xmath278 is the ( normalized ) haar measure on @xmath250 , in terms of @xmath588 ?",
    "a partial step in this direction has been taken by parthasarathy @xcite , who constructed a stinespring dilation of @xmath0 in terms of @xmath588 under the assumption that these operators are linearly independent @xmath278-almost everywhere , i.e. , @xmath589 for any @xmath590 . however",
