    "in 1970 , vishveshwara found that there exist complex frequency modes in perturbations of schwarzschild black holes@xcite , which are called quasi - normal modes ( qnms ) .",
    "qnms play an important role in the physics of black holes@xcite , where many works have been done@xcite .",
    "various aspects of qnms continue to be uncovered in recent years .",
    "actually , there have been some nice reviews of this subject , describing the methods to calculate qnms and introducing the developments of qnms : ref.@xcite shows some properties of eigenfrequencies and potential applications of qnms to gravitational wave asteroseismology ; ref.@xcite introduces some analysis about the application of qnms to relativistic stars and the detection of qnms ; ref.@xcite discusses the applications of qnms in the ads / cft duality and to astrophysical black holes ; ref.@xcite discusses the gravitational instabilities in higher than four dimensions and the ads / cft interpretation of qnms .",
    "the semi - classical interpretation of qnms is particularly interesting . in 1984 ,",
    "ferrari and mashhood@xcite found that the quasi - normal frequency in schwarzschild black hole can be written as @xmath0 when @xmath1 . here",
    "@xmath2 is the frequency of circular photon orbits and @xmath3 is the lyapunov exponent of the orbits which describe how quickly the cross section of the null geodesic congruence changed under infinitesimal radial perturbations . in the eikonal limit , the authors of @xcite studied the qnms by the wkb approximation and obtained the expression of the imaginary part of the quasi - normal frequency .",
    "the relationship between the qnms and the circular null geodesics was then studied in @xcite , which showed that the qnms of black holes in any dimensions are determined by the parameters of the circular null geodesics .",
    "recently , the authors of @xcite made a detailed study of the geometric interpretation of the qnms of massless scalar field in general kerr black holes by the wkb approximation .",
    "usually , people may think that the charge effect is unimportant since most celestial bodies are electroneutral .",
    "but things are not always like that .",
    "recently , some super - chandrasekhar white dwarfs have been found@xcite and this phenomenon can be explained by the charge effect@xcite . even if the particle is uncharged , the behaviors of its trajectories near the singularity of schwarzschild and reissner - nordstrom ( rn ) black holes are quite different . for the rn black hole ,",
    "the singularity is untouchable by geodesics , but this phenomenon does not occur for the schwarzschild black hole . furthermore , when the matter fields or perturbations in kerr - newman ( kn ) black hole are charged , the interaction between matter fields and electromagnetic field in the kn black hole will have significant influence on the qnms , which has been studied in , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "so it is interesting to study the geometric interpretation of qnms of the charged scalar field in the kn black hole , which is the main motivation of this paper . in order to achieve this geometric interpretation",
    ", we also need the behavior of particle motion in the kn spacetime , which can be found in @xcite , and generalize the method in @xcite to explore the geometric correspondence between the qnms and spherical orbits of charged particles for the kn black hole , where special attention is paid to the non - geodesic nature of these orbits .",
    "it is shown that , noting the @xmath4 gauge invariance of physical quantities , the qnms have perfect geometric interpretation by means of the non - geodesic world line congruence .",
    "the influence of charge of the particle is also addressed .",
    "we organize the rest of the paper as follows . in sec .",
    "[ particle ] we will investigate the hamilton - jacobi formalism of particle motion and study the geometric correspondence of qnms .",
    "we can verify that those relationships@xcite also hold : in the leading order , the real part of quasi - normal frequency corresponds to the energy @xmath5 , the azimuthal quantum number corresponds to the angular momentum @xmath6 , and the real part of angular eigenvalue corresponds to the carter constant @xmath7 ; in next - to - leading order , the imaginary part of quasi - normal frequency corresponds to the lyapunov exponent @xmath3 of radial motion , and the next - to - leading order correction of the angular eigenvalue corresponds to the imaginary part of the carter constant . in sec .",
    "[ further ] we obtain the geometric correspondence by some specific example and study the influence of charge .",
    "we also study and find the condition of the zero damping modes in extreme kn black hole .",
    "we can observe that the imaginary part of the quasi - normal frequency will approach to zero under this condition . in sec .",
    "[ conclusion ] we conclude with some discussion .",
    "we consider the charged massive scalar field @xmath8 in kn spacetime in boyer - lindquist coordinate system : @xmath9 with @xmath10 is the mass of black hole , @xmath11 is the angular momentum of black hole , @xmath12 is the black hole charge , @xmath13 , @xmath14 and the four potential @xmath15 $ ] .",
    "the equation of motion of @xmath8 is the klein - gordon(kg ) equation with charge in curved spacetime : @xmath16 with @xmath17 is the charge of the scalar field , @xmath18 is the mass of the field .",
    "we can obtain that @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 under this gauge .",
    "we can separate the scalar field as : @xmath23 and obtain the radial equation and the angular equation as : @xmath24 @xmath25 with @xmath26 , @xmath27 is the angular eigenvalue of the angular equation and depend on quantum number @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "this is the teukolsky equation(@xcite ) with spin @xmath30 and source are zero .      under the transformation",
    "@xmath31 namely @xmath32 , the angular eigenvalue equation ( [ theta1 ] ) can be written as @xmath33 with @xmath34 .",
    "we can see that the influence of mass can be reflected in @xmath35 .",
    "we assume that @xmath36 and the condition @xmath37 holds in the following discussion .",
    "since the quasi - normal frequency is complex with @xmath38 , the angular value @xmath27 is also complex : @xmath39 we can use the wkb analysis to deal with this equation , the approximate solution is @xmath40 where @xmath41 and @xmath42 is the turning point of @xmath43 , i.e. @xmath43 is equal to zero at these two points .",
    "the wave propagates in the region @xmath44 and decay to zero when @xmath45 .",
    "the bohr - sommerfeld condition is @xmath46 with @xmath47 .",
    "we define @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 .",
    "we can treat @xmath52 as a small parameter and expand this integration to obtain @xmath53 using the facts that @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 ( see @xcite ) , we obtain that @xmath57",
    ". then we can use the perturbation theory of eigenvalue equation@xcite , which leads to the next - to - leading - order correction of @xmath27 : @xmath58_{z = a\\omega_r}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] finally we can obtain the approximate expression of @xmath27 in eikonal limit ( @xmath1 ) as @xmath59.\\ ] ]      we define @xmath60 and @xmath61+\\left(\\omega-\\frac{ma+qqr}{r^2+a^2}\\right)^2\\ ] ] with @xmath62 .",
    "then the radial eq.([radial1 ] ) can be transformed as @xmath63 in the condition of eikonal limit ( @xmath1 ) , we can neglect the terms @xmath64 in the expression of the effective potential @xmath65 , we rewrite the effective potential as @xmath66 ^ 2-\\delta ( a_{lm}+a^2\\omega^2 - 2ma\\omega+\\mu_\\star^2r^2)}{(r^2+a^2)^2}.\\ ] ] under this transformation , when @xmath67 , we have @xmath68 and the effective potential @xmath69 ; when @xmath70 , we have @xmath71 and @xmath72 . in order to obtain qnms",
    ", we require that the wave is outgoing at @xmath68 and ingoing at @xmath71 . by comparing handling with the stationary schrodinger equation , we know that boundary condition require that there is a point @xmath73 such that the effective potential @xmath65 is zero here",
    ". we can expand effective potential @xmath65 here as @xmath74 with @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 . taking this taylor expansion into radial equation and using the result of schutz and will@xcite as well as boundary conditions",
    ", we can obtain @xmath79    due to the spirit of qnms , we write @xmath38 , where the imaginary part is a small parameter in contrast to the real part .",
    "when we take this into ( [ xb ] ) and @xmath75 , and expand with respect to @xmath80 , we obtain @xmath81 in other words , there is a radius @xmath82 such that @xmath83 @xmath84 then we can use ( [ ddsb ] ) to calculate the position of apex of effective potential and the real part of frequency , and obtain the imaginary part of frequency .",
    "the massive charged scalar field in curved spacetime satisfy the kg equation @xmath85 we assume that the wave function can be expressed as @xmath86 when we taking this formula ( [ formu1 ] ) into the kg equation.([kgeq1 ] ) and define @xmath87 , the leading order equation is @xmath88 and the next - to - leading order equation is @xmath89 we know that the mechanical moment @xmath90 is how wave propagate in curved background from leading order [ leadingorder1 ] and we note @xmath91 to represents the four - velocity .",
    "the electromagnetic field makes particle s worldline no longer geodesic and that the phase will change along the particle s worldline : @xmath92    furthermore , we can obtain @xmath93 from the leading order , that is the equation of motion of a charged massive particle in a curved spacetime with a electromagnetic field .",
    "it is interesting to know that the mechanical moment @xmath94 is different from the canonical momentum @xmath95 .",
    "as we all know that the electromagnetic field is gauge field and possesses the @xmath4 gauge invariance , when we do the gauge transformation @xmath96 then the phase of wave function will changed correspondingly : @xmath97 and the canonical momentum will change like the following : @xmath98 we can obtain that the wave front will change under gauge transformation but the four velocity will invariant @xmath99 .",
    "the next - to - leading order equation ( [ nextleading1 ] ) gives rise to @xmath100 similar to @xcite , this equation is related to the fluid expansion equation @xmath101 with @xmath102 represents the area of cross section of the congruence .",
    "so the right hand side of above equation shows the change rate of cross section along the worldline . after comparing these two equations",
    "we have @xmath103 so @xmath104 it is well - known that the square of the length of amplitude represents the probability of the appearance of particle , this result tells us that the more the area of cross section of congruence , the less the probability of the appearance of particle .      we will use the hamilton - jacobi formalism to study the motion of charged massive particle : @xmath105 with @xmath106 represents the hamilton principal function . with two killing vector fields @xmath107 and @xmath108 , s can be written into the following form : @xmath109 where @xmath5 represents the total energy of particle with gravitational as well as electromagnetic energy , @xmath6 represents the z - directed specific angular momentum .",
    "the property of timelike and axial killing vectors ensure us that @xmath5 and @xmath6 are conserved constants .",
    "and @xmath110 is the proper time of particle .",
    "the angular and radial equations are @xmath111 @xmath112 where @xmath113 represents derivative with respect to @xmath114 and @xmath115 with respect to @xmath116 , @xmath7 is carter constant which is the third conserved quantity .",
    "we can see how the charge and mass influence the radial equation ( @xmath117 and @xmath118 ) , but there is no charge influence in angular equation .",
    "we define @xmath119 @xmath120 then we have @xmath121 @xmath122 so the hamilton principal function has the form @xmath123    from @xmath124 and @xmath125 , we can obtain @xmath126 @xmath127 taking derivatives of these two equations with respect to @xmath128 : @xmath129 we have @xmath130 @xmath131 we assume the second eq.([radial3 ] ) is equal to @xmath132 and take it into the first equation.([radial4 ] ) , we can obtain that @xmath133",
    ". then these two equations will be recast into @xmath134 @xmath135    from @xmath136 and @xmath137 , we have @xmath138 @xmath139 when we derivative these two equations with respect to @xmath128 we can obtain @xmath140 @xmath141 based on the above two equations , the mass of the particle plays no role but the charge of the particle will have physical effects .      based on the wkb method , the phase of the wave function corresponds to the hamilton principal function , the leading order approximation of wave equation corresponds to hamilton - jacobi equation .",
    "so the wave function has the following form : @xmath142 by comparing to the preceding equations of qnms , we can still find that the conserved particle energy @xmath5 corresponds to the real part of quasi - normal frequency @xmath143 , the z - directed angular momentum @xmath6 corresponds to the azimuthal quantum number @xmath29 .",
    "when we regard @xmath144 as @xmath145 , we can obtain @xmath146 .",
    "these is the same as what we get in kerr back ground .",
    "however we can not get the damping behaviour in leading order . in the next section",
    "we will discuss the next - to - leading order behaviour .        in last section",
    "we show that the conserved quantities of particle orbit ( @xmath147 ) correspond to the real part of parameters of a qnms @xmath148 .",
    "they are the leading order behaviour .",
    "the damping behaviour of qnms will appear in the next - to - leading order . in this section",
    "we will discuss this phenomenon . by the symmetry ,",
    "we can obtain that there should not be any correction in @xmath149-direction .",
    "qnms tell us that the correction of @xmath150- direction will decay .",
    "then we write the wave function as@xcite @xmath151    we define @xmath152 . then the next - to - leading order condition [ nextleading1 ] gives rise to @xmath153 with @xmath110 the affine parameter .",
    "we should note that @xmath154 which is different from @xmath155 .",
    "the transformation @xmath156 can change the left hand side of this equation as : @xmath157    the expression of @xmath158 can be separated into two part : one is only depend on @xmath116 and another on @xmath114 : @xmath159 with @xmath160 is the function of @xmath116 and @xmath161 is the function of @xmath114 .",
    "+ we assume that @xmath162 is a good function near @xmath163 or analytic , then we have @xmath164 around @xmath82 with n is a integer .",
    "then we can obtain @xmath165 where @xmath166 .",
    "the physical interpretation here is that the motion in the @xmath114-direction is independent of @xmath116 .",
    "then we can choose a worldline congruence whose @xmath116-value is a little bigger than @xmath82 but very different @xmath114 .",
    "when they return their respective initial value of @xmath114 , the change of radial @xmath116 @xmath167 is far less than @xmath82 .",
    "and we have that motion along a period of @xmath114 : @xmath168 with right side will approach to a constant.as we all know the definition of lyapunov exponent : @xmath169 with @xmath170 represents the interval between two paths at initial time in phase space , @xmath171 represents the interval between these two paths after time @xmath150 . under these circumstances ,",
    "one path is a unstable circular orbit which the initial radial position is @xmath82 and will be at @xmath82 after a period @xmath172 of @xmath114 motion , the initial position of another path is a little bigger than @xmath82 , for example @xmath116 , and will be at @xmath173 after @xmath172 . by the definition of lyapunov exponent , we have : @xmath174 so the physical meaning of @xmath3 is the lyapunov exponent of radial motion .",
    "the comparison between the circular orbit and the orbit around it tell us that the worldline will return their initial @xmath114 position after a period of @xmath114 motion .",
    "the @xmath149-direction is killing direction , this symmetry guarantee that the @xmath149-direction of congruence will not change .",
    "then the area of cross - section @xmath102 only depends on the radial direction : @xmath175 .",
    "base on the definition @xmath176 of the lyapunov exponent , we can obtain @xmath177 so we have : @xmath178    in the following we consider a worldline whose initial coordinates are @xmath179 and will be @xmath180 after a period of @xmath114 . in this process , the condition @xmath136 and @xmath125 implies @xmath181=\\delta t;\\ ] ] @xmath182=0.\\ ] ] with : @xmath183 due to the radial @xmath116 is near @xmath82 and will change little , then the integral with respect to @xmath184 can be changed as the product of integrand and @xmath167 . using the bohr - sommerfeld condition @xmath185 and",

    "we can see that this is equivalent with the expression of imaginary part of quasi - normal frequency .",
    "at last we can sum up what we have done : the imaginary part of massive charged quasi - normal frequency of kn black hole is respond to the lyapunov exponent of radial motion of massive charged particle of kn spacetime . the imaginary part of frequency represents the damping behaviour of wave and the lyapunov exponent of particle represent the expansion of the cross section of the worldline congruence around the unstable circular orbits .",
    "based on the expression ( [ gamma ] ) , since @xmath189 and @xmath190 both depend on @xmath17 , the charge of the particle plays an important role in the motion .",
    "we can see that the carter constant corresponds to the real part of angular eigenvalue:@xmath191 from the leading order equation , and we know that @xmath27 is complex",
    ". we can guess that the carter constant can be complex and this equation can still be hold . as we can see that particle charge does not appear in @xmath192 , so does the angular amplitude correction @xmath193 , so charge will not affect the correction . although @xmath192 depends on the particle mass , it does not have essential effect on the correction .",
    "then the meaning of complex @xmath27 can also be explained by the complex carter constant .    from eq.([ampltude1],[ampltude2],[ampltude3],[ampltude4 ] ) , we can obtain the correction : @xmath194\\left(is_{\\theta}\\right)\\right)}{\\sqrt{\\sin\\theta\\sqrt{\\theta}}}.\\ ] ] all the @xmath7 and @xmath5 previous are real number and in next part we will mark them as @xmath195 and @xmath196 and let @xmath7 and @xmath5 be complex , namely @xmath197 and @xmath198 .",

    "in fact , the equation of motion @xmath93 has a scaling symmetry defined by @xmath217 and @xmath218 .",
    "the energy of the massless particle is @xmath219 , so the parameter @xmath220 is a scaling - invariant ratio .",
    "then from the particle point of view , it is the conserved qualities and @xmath221 that make sense .",
    "this is different from that in the qnm analysis , where the frequency , the counterpart of energy , is vital .    due to the correspondence , we know that @xmath222 and @xmath223 corresponds to @xmath224 and @xmath225 in the qnm analysis , respectively .",

    "so unlike kerr case , when the massless scalar fields are uncharged and the angular momentum @xmath289 of nearly extreme kn black hole is larger than @xmath290 , the imaginary part of quasi - normal frequency of scalar field will approach to zero with @xmath258 .",
    "another case is that when @xmath291 , we can obtain that @xmath257 is limited in the range from @xmath292 to @xmath293 by eq.([chargedmuc ] ) , so when black hole turn to extreme rn black hole ( @xmath294 , @xmath295 ) , the qnms of charged massless field in rn have zero damping modes ( see @xcite ) .      in this section",
    "we will mainly focus on the effects of field charge .",
    "firstly , we want to see the influence in non - extreme kn black hole .",
    "we can observe that the real and imaginary parts of the frequency become greater while the apex of effective potential become smaller when the field charge changes from @xmath296 to @xmath297 from fig.[fig : tfsb1 ] , fig.[fig : tfxb1 ] and fig.[fig : tfdd1 ] .",
    "when the field charge is opposite to the charge of the black hole , the electromagnetic force is attractive like gravity , these perturbations are located at high orbits and possess relatively smaller energy which contain the gravitational and electromagnetic energy .",
    "the electromagnetic forces change from attraction to repulsion when the field charge changes from @xmath296 to @xmath297 , then these perturbations need stronger gravity to balance the electromagnetic force , so they are located at positions closer to the horizon and possess relatively higher energy .",
    "+    as we know , the particle orbits that have the maximal and minimal radii locate at the equator , of which the carter constant is zero .",
    "we can rewrite the equation @xmath298 as @xmath299 then we substitute this into @xmath300 and obtain @xmath301=\\pm2ra-\\frac{(r-1)r^2}{a\\pm a}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] when we draw the @xmath220-@xmath116 picture , we find that we should choose `` @xmath302 '' . for example , see fig.[fsigma1 ] ( @xmath303 , @xmath304 ) .",
    "fig.[fsigma1 ] shows that the range of @xmath220 has an upper bound @xmath305 , which is saturated as @xmath306 .",
    "actually , when we set @xmath220 to be @xmath305 in this kn black hole , we can draw the apex of the effective potential ( fig.[tfdd11 ] ) in the qnm analysis and obtain that the apex will approaches the horizon when @xmath247 approaches 1 .",
    "when the orbit of particle does not totally lying on the equator , or in other words , the carter constant is not zero , we can not use this method and obtain the range of @xmath220 easily . in this case , the behaviour of the worldline is much more complicated , and will be considered in future works .      in this section",
    "we analyse the qnms and their geometric correspondence when black hole approach to extreme .",
    "influence of charge of black hole    we can also obtain the phenomenon of vanishing imaginary part of frequency when black hole approaches to extreme with @xmath307 and black hole angular momentum @xmath303 , which is shown in fig.[fdjdd1 ] .",
    "( the reasons why we set @xmath307 and @xmath303 are that we want get the charge effects and there exists zero damping modes in this case . )",
    "the phenomenons of real part of frequency , the apex and the inclination angle of spherical orbit are the same like in fig.[nteu1 ] .",
    "one of main differents is the position of turning point . from the previous equation of @xmath257 ( [ chargedmuc ] ) we have derived",
    ", we can obtain that @xmath308 when @xmath303 and @xmath307 , fig.[fdjdd1 ] also shows us that when @xmath309 , the imaginary part of frequency approach zero .",
    "the second different is that when the field has the same charge like black hole , the real part of quasi - normal frequency(fig.[fdjsb1 ] ) will be larger than that of uncharged field(fig.[fig : wdfdjsb1 ] ) and the apex of effective potential(fig.[fdjdd1 ] ) is less than that of uncharged field(fig.[fig : wdfdjdd11 ] ) .",
    "the explanation is that the electromagnetic force is repulsion and need more gravity to balance .",
    "so the charged perturbations will be located near black hole and possess higher total energy than that of uncharged perturbations .",
    "influence of angular momentum of black hole    when we set a fixed @xmath307 and black hole charge @xmath310 and let kn black hole approach to nearly extreme(fig.[fixedcharge1 ] ) , we can obtain the phenomenon of vanishing of imaginary part of quasi - normal frequency in ne kn(@xmath311 ) . when @xmath312 and @xmath313 from fig.[fdjxb3 ] , that correspond to what we have gotten by equation.[chargedmuc ] .",
    "disappearance of zero damping modes in nekn    when we use eq.([chargedmuc ] ) to calculate the turning point when @xmath286 , @xmath314 with @xmath315 , we get @xmath316 , however , when we choose @xmath317 , @xmath318 with @xmath315 , we get @xmath319 .",
    "we can obtain that there is no zero damping modes in nearly extreme kn black hole of the last case in fig.[xb4 ] .",
    "considering the variety of nekn which is different from kerr case , we show the imaginary part of quasi - normal frequency with fixed @xmath320 and @xmath315 in fig.[xb5 ] .",
    "we can obtain that there are zero damping modes in a fraction of nekn , but another fraction of nekn do not have these modes when @xmath321 . in the latter case , the angular drag effect of the rotating black hole is not strong enough , so the gravity and the attractive electromagnetic force will pull the particle into black hole , resulting in no circular orbits or zero damping modes .",
    "so the angular momentum of black hole has a more important role to zero damping modes .",
    "when the angular momentum is not big enough under extreme case , the imaginary part of quasi - normal frequency will not approach to zero(see [ xb5 ] ) .",
    "in this paper , we utilize the method of ref.@xcite to study the qnms of charged massive scalar field in kn spacetime .",
    "we analyse the qnms by wkb method in eikonal limit(@xmath1 ) and get the expression of imaginary part of quasi - normal frequency first",
    ". then we study the hamilton - jacobi equations .",
    "the charge of particle make the world line congruence be non - geodesic , but we can also find the geometric - optic correspondence under this non - geodesic case and obtain the corresponding relationships between the parameters of qnms and the conserved qualities of particle in leading order and next - to - leading order by identifying terms in the hamilton - jacobi equations and teukolsky equations .",
    "we use these results to study the influence of charge in details .",
    "we can observe the phenomenon of vanishing imaginary part of quasi - normal frequency in extreme kn black hole by numerical method and then we obtain the expression of turning point by analytical method .",
    "the expression of turning point which depends on the parameters of black hole as well as charge of field gives us the range of zero damping modes .",
    "we also obtain a rough range of the charge of field about when qnms can exist in kn black hole .    under the geometric - optics correspondence",
    ", the massive scalar field should correspond to timelike worldlines , instead of null ones , so the behaviour will be more complicated .",
    "furthermore , in the case with the massive scalar field , the black hole will in general develops a super - radiant instability ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , but it is not yet clear how ( if possible ) to see signals of such instability in the wkb approximation .",
    "this is also an interesting topic and should be considered in future .",
