    "the presence of uncorrelated spatial disorder in one - dimensional linear wave equations results in the localization of their normal modes ( nms ) .",
    "this is the well - known phenomenon of anderson localization @xcite and has been experimentally observed in a variety of systems , including as examples light @xcite and matter @xcite waves .",
    "understanding the effect of nonlinearity on the localization properties of wave packets in disordered systems is a challenging task , which , has attracted the attention of many researchers in recent years .",
    "several numerical studies of wave packet propagation in different models showed that the second moment @xmath5 of norm / energy distributions grows subdiffusively in time following a power law of the form @xmath6 @xcite .    in @xcite",
    "the mechanisms of spreading and localization were studied for the disordered discrete nonlinear schrdinger equation ( dnls ) @xmath7 and the quartic klein - gordon lattice ( kg ) of anharmonic oscillators with nearest neighbor coupling .",
    "the exponent @xmath3 was numerically found to be close to @xmath8 and a theoretical explanation of this value was provided .    applying the same theoretical argumentation to a generalized dnls ( gdnls ) model @xmath9 with @xmath1 being a positive integer ,",
    "the dependence of @xmath3 on @xmath1 was predicted in @xcite .",
    "the validity of this estimation has not been analyzed in detail .",
    "mulansky @xcite presented numerical simulations of the gdnls model for a few integer values of @xmath1 .",
    "in @xcite numerical simulations of the gdnls model were performed for non integer values of @xmath1 on rather short time scales , leaving the characteristics of the asymptotic ( @xmath10 ) evolution of wave packets aside and open .    the main scope of the present work is to verify the validity and the generality of the theoretical predictions presented in @xcite for one - dimensional disordered nonlinear chains as a function of @xmath1 . in particular , we choose to perform numerical simulations for the generalized kg ( gkg ) model instead of the gdnls system .",
    "this choice was done for two reasons .",
    "firstly , it allows us to test whether the estimations obtained in @xcite hold irrespectively of the presence of a second integral of motion ( the norm @xmath11 ) performed in @xcite it was observed that the kg model requires less cpu time than the dnls system in order to be integrated up to the same time with the same precision . since in our study we are mainly interested in the characteristics of the asymptotic dynamical behavior of wave packets , the gkg model was preferred , as it permits long integrations of large lattice sizes within feasible cpu times .",
    "the hamiltonian of the gkg model is @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the lattice site index , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are respectively the generalized coordinates and momenta , @xmath1 defines the order of the nonlinearity , @xmath16 denotes the disorder strength and @xmath17 are chosen uniformly from the interval @xmath18 $ ] .",
    "the case @xmath19 corresponds to the standard kg model , which exhibits a similar dynamical behavior with the dnls model @xcite .",
    "the equations of motion are @xmath20 and yield @xmath21    hamiltonian ( [ h_kg ] ) is a conservative system and its total energy @xmath22 is preserved and serves as a control parameter of the nonlinearity strength .",
    "equations ( [ h_em ] ) become linear by neglecting the nonlinear term @xmath23 or in the limit @xmath24 ( i.e.  @xmath25 ) where @xmath26 .",
    "then the ansatz @xmath27 reduces them to the linear eigenvalue problem @xmath28 the normalized eigenvectors @xmath29",
    "( @xmath30 are the nms of the system with the corresponding eigenvalues @xmath31 . the width of the squared eigenfrequency @xmath32 spectrum is @xmath33 with @xmath34 $ ]",
    ".    the asymptotic spatial decay of an eigenvector is given by @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the localization length @xcite .",
    "the spatial extend of a nm can be characterized by the average localization volume @xmath37 , with @xmath5 being its second moment @xcite .",
    "@xmath38 for @xmath39 , and @xmath40 for @xmath41 .",
    "the average spacing of squared eigenfrequencies of nms within the range of a localization volume is @xmath42 for @xmath41 and @xmath43 for @xmath44 .",
    "the squared frequency shift of a single - site oscillator induced by the nonlinearity is @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the energy of the oscillator ( see appendix [ ap : shift ] ) . for @xmath19 in eq .",
    "( [ dl ] ) it follows @xmath47 @xcite .    in our study @xmath48 and",
    "we follow the evolution of single site excitations for long times and for @xmath49 .",

    "@xcite with some particularities @xcite .    in our computations the number of lattice sites @xmath58 and the integration time step @xmath59 varied between @xmath60 to @xmath61 and @xmath62 to @xmath63 , in order to exclude finite size effects in the wave packet evolution and allow long integrations up to @xmath64 time units . in all our simulations",
    "the relative energy error was kept smaller than @xmath65 .    following the methodology of @xcite we order the nms in space by increasing value of their center - of - norm coordinate @xmath66 .",
    "we consider normalized energy density distributions @xmath67 with @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is the amplitude of the @xmath70th nm and @xmath71 the corresponding squared eigenfrequency . in our analysis",
    "we use the second moment @xmath72 ( @xmath73 ) , which quantifies the wave packet s degree of spreading , the participation number @xmath74 , which measures the number of the strongest excited modes in @xmath75 , and the compactness index @xmath76 , which quantifies the sparseness of a wave packet , since @xmath77 decreases as the wave packet becomes more sparse ( see @xcite for more details ) .",
    "different dynamical regimes have been discussed in recent publications @xcite . in a recent paper one of us presented a coherent interpretation of collected numerical data within a simple framework which uses two averaged parameters of an initial wave packet as essential control parameters for the dynamical evolution : the average norm or energy density in a packet , and its typical size @xcite . according to these results",
    ", a wave packet can be selftrapped ( see also @xcite ) in a regime of strong nonlinearity .",
    "this happens when nonlinear frequency shifts are larger than the width of the spectrum of the linear equations .",
    "if the nonlinearity is weak enough to avoid selftrapping , the wave packet will spread either in an intermediate regime of strong chaos , followed by an asymptotic regime of weak chaos , or the strong chaos regime is skipped , and spreading starts in the regime of weak chaos and stays there .",
    "the outcome depends on the ratio of the nonlinear frequency shift of the wave packet after spreading into the full localization volume and the average spacing @xmath78 . here",
    "we will adapt these arguments to the study of single site excitations .",
    "then the three possible regimes are : @xmath79 wave packets in the strong chaos regime spread faster than in the weak chaos case ( see also sect .",
    "[ sec : theory ] below ) .",
    "the location of the three different dynamical regimes in the parameter space of the system s energy @xmath80 and the order @xmath1 of the nonlinearity is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_param_sp ] . for @xmath4",
    "the regime of strong chaos is absent ( in the sense that if at all , it will coexist with selftrapping ) .",
    "therefore , if not selftrapped , the wave packet is expected to spread in the asymptotic regime of weak chaos . following anderson s definition of localization @xcite",
    ", we measure the fraction @xmath81 of the wave packet energy in a localization volume @xmath82 around the initially excited site . for",
    "a localized state this fraction should asymptotically tend to a nonzero constant .",
    "we find that in the weak chaos regime ( lower inset of fig .",
    "[ fig_param_sp ] ) the fraction continuously drops down in time , indicating complete delocalization .",
    "contrary , in the strong nonlinear regime of selftrapping ( upper inset of fig .",
    "[ fig_param_sp ] ) the fraction appears to tend towards a nonzero constant .",
    "these behaviors are also clearly seen in fig .",

    "starting from the outer , most extended wave packet we plot distributions for @xmath87 ( black curves ) , @xmath88 ( magenta curves ) , @xmath89 ( red curves ) , @xmath90 ( blue curves ) , @xmath19 ( green curves ) and @xmath91 ( brown curves ) .",
    "all wave packets were considered for the same disorder realization but at different times of their evolution when they have the same value of second moment @xmath92 .",

    "[ fig_s_2_05 ] , when @xmath100 wave packets remain localized for very large time intervals before they start to spread .",
    "this is why for @xmath87 the second moment becomes @xmath92 at a larger time than in cases with @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "[ ( bl ) black ; ( m ) magenta ; ( r ) red ; ( b ) blue ; ( g ) green ; ( br ) brown ] at times @xmath101 respectively",

    "[ profiles ] we see that for large enough values of @xmath1 ( @xmath104 ) , the distributions on a logarithmic scale have a chapeau - like shape consisting of a highly excited central part and exponential tails having practically the same slope .",
    "contrarily , the distributions for @xmath105 and @xmath87 become more extended having different slopes in the tails .",
    "a characteristic of the nm space distributions in fig.[profiles ] for @xmath106 is that they exhibit very large value fluctuations ( up to 10 - 15 orders of magnitude ) in their tails , contrarily to the corresponding distributions in real space .",
    "tail nms are driven by the core of the wave packet , and may also interact with neighboring tail nms .",
    "the presence of large tail amplitude fluctuations signals that neighboring tail nms do not interact significantly ( otherwise we would expect a tendency towards equipartition ) .",
    "tail nms are then excited only by the core ; the further away they are , the weaker the excitation . but within a small tail volume , nms with larger localization length will be more strongly excited than those with smaller localization length , hence the large observed fluctuations , which on a logarithmic scale are of the order of the relative variation of the localization length . therefore anderson localization is preserved in the tails of the distributions over very long times ( essentially until the given tail volume becomes a part of the core ) .",
    "but the nm space distributions for @xmath87 and @xmath105 exhibit less fluctuations in their tail values with respect to the other distributions in the upper plot of fig .  [ profiles ] , implying that tail nms are now interacting with each other on comparatively short time scales and reach a visible level of local equipartition .",
    "therefore we observe for these cases a destruction of anderson localization even in the tails of the spreading wave packets .",
    "the assumption that all nms in a wave packet are chaotic leads to a power law increase of @xmath5 whose exponent @xmath3 is given by eq .",
    "( [ alpha_deph ] ) . in order to check the validity of this prediction we enhanced the wave packet chaoticity by a periodic dephasing of its nms .",
    "every 100 time units on average 50% of the nms were randomly chosen and the signs of their momenta were changed . in this way a faster spreading of the wave packet , with respect to its normal evolution , was achieved .",
    "we also note that @xmath1 has a similar effect on the shape of wave packets as in the case of normal evolution without dephasing , because energy distributions in nm and in real space for the same @xmath5 values and different @xmath1 values have similar profiles to the ones shown in fig .",
