    "the static abrikosov flux lattice has been experimentally observed since sixties by great variety of techniques and lateral correlations have been clearly observed recently up to tens of thousands of lattice spacings lieber .",
    "the remarkable advances in decoration , small - angle neutron scattering and muon spin rotation techniques allowed recently direct glimpse into the structure of the moving abrikosov vortex systems yaron , kes , pardo , forgan .",
    "it shows that at small flux flow velocitiesvortices move in channels as predicted in @xcite .",
    "when the flux flow velocity increases beyond the one corresponding to the critical current , one observes a relatively well correlated hexagonal lattice .",
    "the channels and the plastic flow at relatively low velocities are explained by influence of pinning on the basis of theoretical arguments @xcite and confirmed by numerous simulations @xcite . at high velocity of the moving lattice ( corresponding to high electric field )",
    ", the influence of disorder is expected to diminish and a moving bragg glass  appears giamarchi , koshelev .",
    "indeed bragg peaks roughly at positions of the hexagonal lattice were observed @xcite recently .    since the theoretical prediction of the moving bragg glass exhibiting transverse peak effect @xcite",
    ", a lot of effort has been put into the simulation of the high driving force phase of the moving vortex system @xcite . in particular",
    "it was found reichhardt that as the driving force increases ( or disorder decreases ) the vortex lattice suddenly changes orientation for a period of time and then returns to a regular  drift mode .",
    "the main emphasis in these studies mentioned above is still the effects of pinning on the moving lattice .",
    "experiments at low ( below @xmath3 ) magnetic field and slow flux moving velocity ( of order @xmath4 ) showed that the orientation of the moving vortex lattice is tied to the direction of motion , namely , when nearly hexagonal lattice is observed , one always observes the orientation depicted on fig .",
    "1a , never the rotated  one of the fig.1b @xcite . here the effect of pinning can not be ignored and plays an important role in the orientation of the vortex lattice .",
    "however the most recent small - angle neutron scattering and muon spin rotation experiment can probe the moving lattice at much higher velocities of order @xmath5 or even higher .",
    "the results about the orientation of the moving lattice obtained in @xcite seem to be different from the case at low magnetic field and slow flux moving velocity .",
    "the effect of pinning is expected to be smaller at higher velocities .",
    "alternatively one can ask what happens in very clean materials .",
    "a recent experiment in @xmath6 seems to belong to this category @xcite .",
    "as the pinning influence diminishes with increasing flux velocity , it is natural to ask what happen in the limit of the highest possible flux velocity ( of course , eventually the electric field destroys superconductivity , so that the mathematical limit of the infinite driving force is unphysical ) disregarding pinning altogether .",
    "the question of the orientation of the vortex lattice usually does not arise in the static case . without external electric field singling out a particular direction one has a complete degeneracy of possible orientations of the hexagonal vortex lattice .",
    "this is not surprising for a sufficiently symmetric material ( like @xmath7 frequently used in experiments belongs to this category ) : the rotational symmetry ensures that the free energy is independent of the hexagonal lattice orientation .",
    "the rotational symmetry is broken by the motion of fluxons as was confirmed experimentally pardo , andrei .",
    "naturally one could ask whether the particular lattice orientation observed for example in @xcite is necessarily tied to pinning or might appear in clean superconductors as well . furthermore , the lattice also can be deformed though the deformation apparently is very small ( see fig.1c , d in @xcite ) .",
    "is there a deformation even before pinning centers disorder the lattice ?",
    "it would be difficult to address the question of the moving vortex lattice structure using phenomenological models like the elastic medium giamarchi ( in which individual vortices are simply not seen )  or approximating vortices in the london approximation by interacting lines or points @xmath8 in 2d @xcite . to give an example of the problems in the london limit ,",
    "let us consider equations of motion for vortices .",
    "the driving force @xmath9 is the lorentz force and the dynamics is assumed overdamped : @xmath10where @xmath11 is the inter - vortex repulsive potential .",
    "the solution of these equations in the absence of pinning is obvious :  the boostedhexagonal lattice of any orientation irrespective of the direction of @xmath12 .",
    "thus the orientation of the lattice depends solely on initial conditions , at least in the clean case .",
    "therefore the approximations made in the above phenomenological approaches are too strong .    in this paper",
    "we use the time dependent ginzburg - landau ( tdgl ) model to study the vortex motion and structure .",
    "the tdgl approach has been remarkably successful in describing various thermodynamical and transport properties @xcite .",
    "progress in obtaining the theoretical results from the model can be achieved only when certain additional assumptions are made .",
    "one of the often made additional assumption is that only the lowest landau level ( lll ) significantly contributes to physical quantities of interest .",
    "the lll approximation is valid for @xmath13 in the static limit lihll .",
    "although most of the experiments concerning moving lattice were performed at field far below the static @xmath14 , it has been shown long time ago @xcite that in the presence of electric field @xmath15 the effective @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the velocity of fluxons and @xmath1 is the inverse diffusion constant setting the time scale in tdgl approach .",
    "this field @xmath18 could be much smaller at not very small fluxon velocities ( electric field suppresses superconductivity even more effectively than the magnetic field ) .",
    "therefore effectively one can move into the region of validity of the lll approximation at sufficiently large currents .",
    "moreover one expects that , even beyond the region of validity of the lll approximation , physics is qualitatively the same .",
    "we solve tdgl equations for a moving vortex solid without disorder and find the vortex structure to which the moving lattice relaxes irrespective of initial conditions @xcite .",
    "it turns out that the preferred lattice is rhombic .",
    "the distortion is velocity dependent .",
    "remarkably the orientation is the same as on fig.1a , namely agrees with experiments only at velocities exceeding the critical one ( of order of @xmath19 for superconducting type ii low @xmath20 metals ) .",
    "below it the orientation is rotated by @xmath21 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "model is described , symmetries analyzed and perturbative mean field solution developed in section ii .",
    "the general formalism is developed to treat the non hermitian part of the equation .",
    "the shape and the orientation of the vortex lattice and the reorientation transition are described in section iii .",
    "then in section iv we calculate corrections due to higher landau levels and derive general expression for conductivity .",
    "it is compared with a recent experiment .",
    "section v is a summary .",
    "our starting point is the tdgl equation @xcite @xmath22the static gl free energy is : @xmath23 are phenomenological parameters , @xmath1 is the inverse diffusion constant which controls the scale of dynamical processes via dissipation . as usual",
    "the magnetic induction is @xmath24 and electric field @xmath25 it should be supplemented by amphere s law @xcite@xmath26where the first term is the contribution of the normal liquid in the framework of the two liquid model and the second term is the supercurrent @xmath27tensor @xmath28 is the normal state conductivity .",
    "we assume that the coefficient of the covariant time derivative term @xmath1 in eq.(fulltdgl ) is real although a small imaginary ( hall ) part is always present @xcite . the general case will be discussed in section v.    we make several approximations ( identical to those made in @xcite and major parts of @xcite ) so that the problem becomes manageable .",
    "the physical conditions allowing those approximations are the following .",
    "temperatures and magnetic fields are close enough  to @xmath14 . under this assumption",
    "the order parameter @xmath29 is suppressed compared to its meissner value . in this paper",
    "we will also assume strongly type ii superconductivity @xmath30 ( @xmath31 @xmath32 ) .",
    "magnetic field is very homogeneous since the vortices overlap .",
    "characteristic length describing the inhomogeneity of the electric field was identified in @xcite : @xmath33 and since typically  @xmath34 , thus @xmath35 and the electric field is assumed homogeneous .",
    "therefore the maxwell type equations for electromagnetic field are not considered .",
    "the time independent vector potential will be taken in landau gauge @xmath36 and describes a nonfluctuating magnetic field in the direction @xmath37 .",
    "the scalar potential is also independent of time @xmath38 and describes the electric field oriented along negative @xmath39 axis .",
    "the vortices are therefore moving along the @xmath40 direction .",
    "we neglect thermal fluctuations and disorder on the mesoscopic scale .    throughout most of the paper",
    "we will use the following physical units .",
    "unit of length is the coherence length @xmath41 , unit of magnetic field is @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and the unit of energy ( temperature ) is @xmath44 . in these units the magnetic field",
    "is denoted by @xmath45 .",
    "the asymmetry of masses between the @xmath46 direction and the @xmath47 plane can be removed by rescaling coordinates and time : @xmath48 .",
    "the tdgl equations , after the order parameter field is rescaled as well @xmath49 is:@xmath50 -a ,   \\notag\\end{aligned}\\]]where @xmath51 @xmath52is scaled vortex velocity ( in units of @xmath53 ) and covariant derivatives are defined by @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "since @xmath56 commutes with @xmath57 , the equations are invariant under the @xmath46 translations , the @xmath46 dependence of the solutions decouples and is generally a plane wave .",
    "it is easy to see that the relevant solution does not break this symmetry and is therefore constant with respect to @xmath46 .",
    "consequently we consider the problem as a 2 + 1 dimensional one ( note however that if the 3d disorder or thermal fluctuations are included one can not ignore the @xmath46 coordinate as the configuration of disorder can destroy the translational symmetry along the @xmath46 direction ) .",
    "the line  in parameter space ( @xmath58 ) , which separates the normal region in which the only solution is @xmath59 from the flux flow nontrivial solution region , has been found by hu and thompson @xcite .",
    "we will construct a perturbative solution of the tdgl equations near the mixed state - normal phase transition line analogous to the one in statics @xcite .",
    "the range of applicability and precision of the lll approximation at large @xmath60 in statics was explored recently @xcite .",

    "<S> for relatively velocities @xmath0 where @xmath1 is inverse diffusion constant in time dependent ginzburg - landau equation , vortex lattice has  a different orientation than for @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the two orientations can be described as motion `` in channels '' and motion of \" lines of vortices perpendicular to the direction of motion . </S>",
    "<S> although we start from the lowest landau level approximation , corrections to conductivity and the vortex lattice energy dissipation from higher landau levels are systematically calculated and compared to a recent experiment . </S>"
