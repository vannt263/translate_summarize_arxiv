    "the traditional notion of a polaron corresponds to a quasiparticle formed from the interactions between an impurity and its many - body surrounding medium , as first discussed by landau and pekar in 1948 @xcite .",
    "polaron physics plays , for instance , an important role in the theory of superconductors with strong interactions , where the carriers are small lattice polarons and bipolarons @xcite .",
    "there is also strong evidence that polarons play a role in the mechanism for some high - temperature superconductors @xcite . in magnetic systems ,",
    "a spin polaron can be formed by the interaction of an impurity spin with the spins of the surrounding magnetic ions @xcite .",
