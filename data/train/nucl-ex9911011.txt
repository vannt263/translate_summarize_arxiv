    "have mainly been studied in the canonical and grand - canonical ensemble . in order to obtain the level density ,",
    "the inverse transformation @xmath42 is normally used .",

    ", an expansion of the exponent in the integrand to second order around the equilibrium point and subsequent integration , have been used widely . for the ideal fermi gas , this gives the following density of states @xmath44 where @xmath45 in nuclear physics is a factor typically of the order @xmath46 with dimension mev@xmath47 , @xmath32 being the mass number of a given nucleus .",
    "ideally , the experiment should provide the level density as function of excitation energy and thereby the full partition function for the microcanonical ensemble . in the microcanonical ensemble we could then extract expectation values for thermodynamical quantities like temperature @xmath40 , or the heat capacity @xmath48 .",
    "the temperature in the microcanonical ensemble is defined as @xmath49 it is a function of the excitation energy , which is the relevant variable of interest in the microcanonical ensemble . however , since the extracted level density is given only at discrete energies , the calculation of expectation values like @xmath40 , involving derivatives of the partition function , is not reliable unless a strong smoothing over energies is performed .",
    "this case is discussed at large in ref .",
    "@xcite and below .",
    "another possibility is to employ the laplace transformation of eq .",
    "( [ eq : zactual ] ) in order to evaluate various thermodynamical quantities in the canonical ensemble . as an example",
    ", we can evaluate the entropy in the canonical ensemble using the definition of helmholtz free energy @xmath50 note that the temperature @xmath40 is now the variable of interest and the energy @xmath14 is given by the expectation value @xmath51 as function of @xmath40 .",
    "similarly , the entropy @xmath52 is also a function of @xmath40 .    in this section",
    ", we extract the exact level density from a simple theoretical model .",
    "the hamiltonian we use to obtain the eigenvalues and the level density @xmath53 is the simple pairing hamiltonian @xmath54 where @xmath55 and @xmath45 are fermion creation and annihilation operators , respectively .",
    "the indices @xmath56 and @xmath57 run over the number of levels @xmath8 , and the label @xmath58 stands for a time - reversed state .",
    "the parameter @xmath59 is the strength of the pairing force while @xmath60 is the single - particle energy of level @xmath56 .",
    "we assume that the single - particle levels are equidistant with a fixed spacing @xmath61 such that eq .",
    "( [ eq : pairhamiltonian ] ) becomes @xmath62 moreover , in our simple model , the degeneracy of the single - particle levels is set to @xmath63 , with @xmath64 being the spin of the particle .",
    "introducing the pair - creation operator @xmath65 and @xmath66 one can rewrite the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ eq : pair1 ] ) as @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the number operator . the latter commutes with the hamiltonian @xmath69 . in this",
    "model quantum numbers like seniority @xmath70 are good quantum numbers , and the eigenvalue problem can be rewritten in terms of blocks with good seniority . loosely speaking ,",
    "the seniority quantum number @xmath70 is equal to the number of unpaired particles , see ref .",
    "@xcite for further details .",
    "the reason why we focus on such a simple model is twofold .",
    "firstly , we expect the ground state of nuclei to be largely dominated by pairing correlations .",
    "this is mainly due to the strong singlet @xmath71 state in the nucleon - nucleon interaction , see e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite . for even - even systems this",
    "is typically reflected in an energy gap between the ground state and the first excited state , a gap that is larger than that seen in odd nuclei .",
    "this is taken as an evidence of strong pairing correlations in the ground state .",
    "more energy is needed in order to excite the system when all fermions are paired , i.e. when we have a system with an even number of particles .",
    "since pairing correlations are important in nuclear systems , we expect the above model to exhibit at least some of the properties seen in finite nuclei .",
    "secondly , for particle numbers up to @xmath72 , the above model can be solved exactly through numerical diagonalization , since seniority is a good quantum number .",
    "this means that we can subdivide the full eigenvalue problem into minor blocks with given seniority and diagonalize these separately . in our case",
    "we use for the even system @xmath73 particles which are distributed over @xmath74 two - fold degenerate levels giving a total of @xmath75 states . of this total , for @xmath70 @xmath76 , i.e. no broken pairs , we have @xmath77 states . since the hamiltonian does not connect states with different seniority @xmath70 , we can diagonalize a @xmath78 matrix and obtain all eigenvalues with @xmath70 @xmath76 . similarly , we can subdivide the hamiltonian matrix into @xmath70 @xmath79 , @xmath70 @xmath80 , ... and @xmath70 @xmath81 ( all pairs broken ) blocks and obtain _ all _ @xmath82 eigenvalues for a system with @xmath74 levels and @xmath73 particles .",
    "as such , we have the _ exact density of levels _ and can compute observables like the entropy , heat capacity etc .",
    "this numerically solvable model enables us to compute exactly the entropy in the microcanonical and the canonical ensembles for systems with odd and even numbers of particles . in addition , varying the level spacing @xmath61 and the pairing strength @xmath59 , may reveal features of e.g. , the entropy which are similar to those of the experimentally extracted entropy . recall that the nuclei studied represent both even - even and even - odd nucleon systems .",
    "here we study two systems in order to extract differences between odd and even systems , namely by fixing the number of doubly degenerated single - particle levels to @xmath74 , whereas the number of particles is set to @xmath83 and @xmath73 .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] pictures the ground state of these systems and possible excited states .",
    "these two systems result in a total of @xmath84 eigenstates . in the calculations ,",
    "we choose a single - particle level spacing of @xmath85 , which is close to what is expected for rare earth nuclei . in this sense , if we are to assign energies with dimension mev , our results may show some similarity with experiment .",
    "we select three values of the pairing strength , namely @xmath86 and @xmath87 , resulting in the ratio @xmath88 , @xmath89 and @xmath90 , respectively .",
    "the first case represents a strong pairing case , with almost degenerate single - particle levels .",
    "the second is an intermediate case where the level spacing is of the order of the pairing strength , while the last case results in a weak pairing case . as shown below",
    ", the results for the latter resemble to a certain extent those for an ideal gas .",
    "the calculational procedure is rather straightforward .",
    "first we diagonalize the large hamiltonian matrix ( which is subdivided into seniority blocks ) and obtain all eigenvalues @xmath14 for the odd and even particle case .",
    "this defines also the density of levels @xmath53 , the partition function and the entropy in the microcanonical ensemble .",
    "thereafter we can obtain the partition function @xmath91 in the canonical ensemble through eq .",
    "( [ eq : zactual ] ) .",
    "the partition function @xmath91 enables us in turn to compute the entropy @xmath92 using @xmath93 since this is a model with a finite number of levels and particles , unless a certain smoothing is done , the microcanonical entropy may vary strongly from energy to energy .",
    "this is seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] , where we plot the entropy for the odd ( upper part ) and even ( lower part ) system using @xmath94 .",
    "the entropy is given by discrete points , since we do not have eigenvalues at all energies .",
    "however , we can also perform a moderate smoothing which conserves the basic features of the model , namely an increase in entropy when pairs are broken .",
    "this was performed with a gaussian smoothing @xmath95 where @xmath96 and @xmath97 are the entropies and energies from the diagonalization of the pairing hamiltonian .",
    "@xmath98 is the smoothed entropy . with a smoothing parameter of",
    "@xmath99 we see that the smoothed entropy still keeps track of the points where the entropy experiences an increase due to breaking of pairs .",
    "figure  [ fig : fig3 ] clearly reveals the energies where two , three , four and so forth quasi - particles are created , i.e. , where sudden increases in entropy take place . for the even system with the ground state at @xmath100 , the first seniority @xmath101 @xmath79 ( formation of two quasi - particles ) state appears at an excitation energy of @xmath102 , the first @xmath101 @xmath80 state appears at @xmath103 and the first @xmath101 @xmath104 state is at @xmath105 .",
    "note well that in the figures of calculations we do not show the absolute energies .",
    "if we wish to employ dimensions in mev , the first excited state for the even system would be close to what is expected experimentally .    for the odd system , the first excited states are just one - quasi - particle states , i.e. , excitations of the last and least bound single - particle . since the level spacing is much smaller around the ground state energy for the odd case ( with energy @xmath106 ) , these states appear rather close to the ground state .",
    "when a pair is broken , we create a three - quasi - particle state ( one broken pair plus a quasi - particle ) , or seniority @xmath101 @xmath107 state .",
    "this appears at an excitation energy of @xmath108 , whilst the seniority @xmath101 @xmath109 state ( two broken pairs plus one quasi - particle ) appears at @xmath110 .",
    "we note from fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] that at an energy of @xmath111 , the entropy starts decreasing ( population inversion ) , reflecting thereby the limited size of our model .    for @xmath112 , where the single - particle spacing is only half the pairing strength ,",
    "the energy eigenvalues are fairly well distributed over the given energy range .",
    "if we decrease @xmath113 however , we approach the degenerate limit , and the eigenvalues and the entropy are sharply concentrated around those eigenvalues where pairs are broken .",
    "this is seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] for @xmath114 for the even case with @xmath73 .",
    "the odd case with @xmath83 exhibits a similar behavior .",
    "clearly , if we wish to evaluate the temperature according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : temp ] ) for @xmath114 , even with a strong smoothing , we can not obtain reliable values for e.g. , @xmath40 .",
    "thus , rather than performing a certain smoothing , we will choose to present further results for the entropy in the canonical ensemble , using the laplace transform of eq .",
    "( [ eq : zactual ] ) .",
    "the results for the entropy in the canonical ensemble as functions of @xmath40 for the above three sets of @xmath115 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5 ] .",
    "for the two cases with strong pairing , we see a clear difference in entropy between the odd and the even system .",
    "the difference in entropy between the odd and even systems can be easily understood from the fact that the lowest - lying states in the odd system involve simply the excitation of one single - particle to the first unoccupied single - particle state , and is interpreted as a single - quasi - particle state .",
    "these states are rather close in energy to the ground state and explain why the entropy for the odd system has a finite value already at low temperatures ( recall also the discussion in connection with fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] ) .",
    "higher lying excited states include also breaking of pairs and can be described as three- , five- and more - quasi - particle states . for @xmath116 , the odd and even systems merge together already at low temperatures , indicating that pairing correlations play a negligible role . for small single - particle spacing ,",
    "also the difference in energy between the first excited state and the ground state for the odd system is rather small .    for our choice of @xmath61",
    "we observe that the maximum entropy is of the order of @xmath117 in the canonical ensemble , whereas in the microcanonical ensemble , see figs .  [",
    "fig : fig3 ] and [ fig : fig4 ] , the maximum value is @xmath118 . obviously , when performing the transformation to the canonical ensemble , since we have a small system , there may be larger fluctuations in expectation values like the entropy . in the limit @xmath119 , the two ensembles should result in equal values for @xmath40 , @xmath14 and @xmath52 , see ref .",
    "@xcite for an in depth discussion .",
    "for @xmath112 we note that at a temperature of @xmath120 , the even and odd system approach each other and @xmath14 . ] .",
    "the temperature where this occurs corresponds to an excitation energy @xmath51 in the canonical ensemble of @xmath121 .",
    "recalling fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] , this corresponds to excitation energies where we have @xmath122 quasi - particles , seniority @xmath101 @xmath123 , in the even system and @xmath124 quasi - particles , seniority @xmath101 @xmath125 , in the odd system .",
    "the almost merging together of the even and odd systems at these temperatures , can be retraced to the features seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] . for higher excitation energies in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] , we saw that higher seniority values show less marked bumps in the entropy , indicating that the level density at higher excitation energies contains many more states and that we are getting closer to a phase where pairing plays a less significant role .    for small systems like finite nuclei , where the size of the system is not large compared to the range of the strong interaction ,",
    "the entropy is not an extensive quantity , i.e. , it does not scale with the size of the system @xcite .",
    "however , if we assume that the entropy is an extensive quantity , then @xmath126 , with @xmath127 the number of particles and @xmath128 the single - particle entropy in the canonical ensemble . in our case @xmath128 should correspond to the single - quasi - particle entropy .",
    "if we label the entropy excess @xmath129 as the difference between the odd and even entropies , namely @xmath130 with @xmath131 and @xmath132 , we can in turn define the number of quasi - particles in the odd and even systems as @xmath133 respectively .",
    "the odd system has one more quasi - particle than the even system , i.e. , @xmath134 .",
    "[ fig : fig6 ] shows the number of quasi - particles in the odd and even systems for the three values of @xmath113 using the definition in eq .",
    "( [ eq : quasi - particle ] ) .",
    "we note that for all cases the differences between the odd and even systems remain equal and close to one , demonstrating that the entropy is an extensive quantity as function of the number of quasi - particles .",
    "furthermore , for @xmath112 ( central panel ) , we see that the excitation energies where @xmath135 quasi - particles appear , agree with the results discussed in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] in the microcanonical ensemble . to give an example , for the odd system , three quasi - particle appear at an energy of @xmath136 , which should be compared with the exactly calculated one in the microcanonical ensemble of @xmath108 .",

    "the agreement for the even case is slightly worse . for @xmath114 , the strong pairing case",
    ", we note that more energy is needed in order to create @xmath138 and @xmath139 quasi - particles in the even and odd systems , respectively .",
    "this agrees also with the microcanonical result of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] . for the weak pairing case @xmath116",
    ", higher seniority states appear already at low excitations energies , indicating that pairing plays a minor role , as expected .",
    "[ fig : fig6 ] carries also an interesting message .",
    "if one can extract the number of quasi - particles as function of excitation energies , the steepness of the curve provides useful information about the relation between the single - particle spacing and the pairing strength .    in summary , varying @xmath113 , allows us to extract qualitative informations about thermodynamical properties such as the entropy and the number of quasi - particles in even and odd systems .",
    "especially , two properties are worth paying attention to concerning the discussion in the next section .",
    "firstly , for the two cases with strong pairing ( @xmath114 and @xmath112 ) , fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5 ] tells us that at temperatures where we have @xmath122 quasi - particles in the even system and @xmath124 quasi - particles in the odd system , the odd and even system tend to merge together .",
    "this reflects the fact that pairing correlations tend to be less important and we approach the non - interacting case . for the weak pairing case , @xmath116 , the odd and even systems yield similar results at much lower temperatures . in a simple model with just pairing interactions",
    ", it is thus easy to see where , at given temperatures and excitation energies , certain degrees of freedom prevail . for the experimental results in the next section",
    ", this may not be the case since the interaction between nucleons is much more complicated .",
    "the hope however is that pairing may dominate at low excitation energies and that the features seen in e.g. , fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5 ] are qualitatively similar to the experimental ones .",
    "secondly , we can read from fig .",
    "[ fig : fig6 ] the excitation energy where different numbers of quasi - particles appear . with a realistic value for the level spacing ,",
    "a comparison with experiment may tell us something about the strength of the pairing force .",
    "the experimental level density @xmath53 at excitation energy @xmath14 is proportional to the number of levels accessible in @xmath9-decay . for the present reactions",
    "the spin distribution is centered around @xmath140 4.4 @xmath141 with a standard deviation of @xmath142 2.4 @xmath141 @xcite .",

    "] can be deduced within the microcanonical ensemble , using @xmath144 where @xmath145 is the number of levels in the energy bin at energy @xmath14 .",
    "the normalization factor @xmath146 can be determined from the ground state band in the even - even nuclei , where we have @xmath147 1 within a typical experimental energy bin of @xmath16 0.1 mev .",
    "the extracted entropies for the @xmath2dy and @xmath3yb nuclei are shown in figs .",

    "( 21 ) with @xmath148 3 mev@xmath47 .",
    "the entropy curves are rather linear , but with small oscillations or bumps superimposed .",
    "the curves terminate around 1 mev below their respective neutron binding energies due to the experimental cut excluding @xmath9-rays with @xmath149 1 mev .",
    "all four curves reach @xmath150 13 @xmath4 , which by extrapolation correspond to @xmath150 15 @xmath4 at the neutron binding energy @xmath37 .",
    "this is the maximum entropy that a nucleus in this mass region can reach before neutron emission .    the calculations for odd and even systems ( see fig .",
    "3 ) show clear increases in the entropy at the excitation energies where cooper pairs are broken .",
    "this behavior is not very pronounced in the experimental data , probably due to residual couplings in real nuclei . in particular , our pairing model excludes collective excitations , which are known to contribute strongly at low excitation energy . for @xmath6yb in fig .",
    "8 one can identify bumps at 1.5 mev and 2.8 mev of excitation energy , that could be interpreted as increased entropy due to the breaking of two and four quasi - particles , respectively .",
    "for the odd system the valence particle ( or hole ) is expected to perform blocking , and indeed the calculations of fig .  3 reveal effects of smearing out the entropy structures as function of excitation energy .",
    "the smoother experimental entropy curves for @xmath151dy and @xmath152yb ( see figs .  [",
