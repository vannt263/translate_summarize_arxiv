    "the study of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) is a fundamental tool for understanding the universe we live in .",
    "a very important link from the study of the cmb to parameters describing our universe is the power spectrum @xmath0 of the anisotropies in the cmb ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "it is hence very important to accurately measure the spectrum @xmath0 , which is obtained via measuring the temperature of the sky , which in turn has contaminating foregrounds .",
    "the main contaminants on larger scales are extended foregrounds ( diffuse galactic emissions ) while on small scales , extra - galactic point sources are the main contaminants ( see for instance @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite or @xcite ) .",
    "the most accurate ( meaning high resolution and high signal - to - noise ratio ) publicly available measurements of the cmb anisotropies we have up to today are from the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) @xcite .",
    "clearly , measuring the cmb and its anisotropies accurately also implies correcting accurately for the contaminants . in @xcite",
    ", we presented a new way to disentangle the point source signal from the cmb and other foregrounds obtaining a new and extended catalogue of extragalactic sources .",
    "the novelty of our approach was the use of needlet transforms ( see @xcite or @xcite and references therein ) and internal templates ( @xcite ) to enhance the signal - to - noise ratio of the point source signal .",
    "the point sources contribute to the spectrum mainly at large multipoles @xmath1 and correcting the power spectrum from the bias that they introduce is crucial for accurately estimating the cosmological parameters .",
    "this can be done in two ways : the standard approach is to mask the observed map with a point source mask and then compute the spectrum ( see ( @xcite ) ) .",
    "another approach is to remove the best model estimates of the point sources in the map and then compute the power spectrum , which to our knowledge has been considered in only a very few papers ( see @xcite or @xcite ) .",
    "the advantage of the standard approach is that it has no dependence on whether the source is modelled correctly , but each source is masked with a rather large disc depending on the beam of the experiment and some data are lost .",
    "another disadvantage with this approach is that analysis methods applying filters ( for instance wavelets ) to the map may contaminate an even larger part of the filtered map in the area of the point source holes ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "the alternative approach depends on modelling the source correctly , but less data are masked and filtered maps will not be contaminated by point source holes . in this paper",
    "we use both approaches in order to compare them .",
    "even if we increased substantially the number of detected point sources , there are still unresolved point sources which contribute to estimate of the spectrum @xmath0 .",
    "we use the approach first presented in @xcite by the wmap - team to correct for it . in short",
    ", this method consists in using the cmb power spectrum ( containing the unresolved point sources contribution ) obtained at different frequencies and the known frequency dependency of the flux densities of the point sources ( see for instance @xcite or @xcite ) in order to make a fit of the amplitude of the unresolved point sources .",
    "the scope of this paper is threefold :    1 .   to compare the effect of masking point sources versus removing best - fitting source models when estimating the cmb power spectrum .",
    "we do this by running a large number of simulations with point sources and compare the mean of the estimated spectra using each of the two procedures . since the wmap team used only the v and w channels to estimate the power spectrum and to save cpu time , we simulate only the v and w channels .",
    "2 .   to compare the power spectrum in the wmap 7-year data using the two different approaches above as well as to see the effect of masking / removing all the additional point sources detected in @xcite on the power spectrum .",
    "3 .   to compare the masking and removing approach on the skewness of needlet coefficients .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows : in  [ sec : meth ] we present the methods both for creating simulations (  [ sec : create_sims ] ) as well as the method to estimate the power spectrum @xmath0 (  [ sec : method ] ) . in  [ sec : results ] we present the results both for simulations (  [ sec : sim_res ] ) and wmap 7-year data (  [ sec : realdata ] ) . in  [ sec : skew ] we present the results of the skewness analysis .",
    "finally , in  [ sec : concl ] we present our conclusions .",
    "to fulfill goals 1 and 3 above , we need to generate an ensemble of realistic simulations of cmb , noise and point sources for the v and w channels . to generate the point source simulations we draw the flux densities from a flux density distribution in the v - channel and transform to other channels drawing from a spectral index distribution . for the v - channel ,",
    "we sample flux densities @xmath2 from the distribution for the differential number counts @xmath3 found in @xcite , @xmath4    we chose to sample flux densities in a range with lower bound @xmath5 jy ( in analogy to @xcite ) , well below the detection limit , up to @xmath6 jy , where @xmath7 is the mean of the error on the estimated flux densities in the v channel . above @xmath8",
    "we do not sample flux densities from the distribution for the differential number counts given above , but we use the actual flux densities estimated in the wmap 7-year data .",
    "this choice is motivated by the fact that the point sources with high flux densities are well known in real data ( and their number count is complete ) ; if we were to simulate sources above @xmath8 , there being only a few ( being at the tail of the distribution ) the resulting simulated sky would look very different from the measured one .",
    "we normalize the distribution function @xmath9 ( giving the number of sources per jy per steradian ) , where @xmath10 is the normalization constant .",
    "this constant is obtained from the number of detections of point sources in real data ( v - band ) which have flux densities above @xmath11 , which we found to be 103 detections @xcite ,    @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the kept sky - fraction . the total number n of sources above @xmath14 for the full sky",
    "is then determined by integrating @xmath15 eventually this gives 2955 simulated flux densities being @xmath16 .",
    "we then use the actual flux densities of the point sources being @xmath17 in the v channel and the flux densities estimated in the v - channel of the sources which are @xmath18 in channel w but @xmath19 in the v - channel ( which add up to 113 sources ) .",
    "we thus obtain a set of 3068 realistic values of flux densities of point sources at frequency v of which 2955 are drawn from the distribution of the differential number counts and 113 are flux densities of strong sources from real data .    in order to obtain realistic values of flux densities in the w - channel , we scale the flux densities @xmath16 in the v - channel with a spectral index distribution having mean @xmath20 and a dispersion of 0.65 .",
    "the mean value is chosen half way from the mean spectral index obtained by @xcite ( namely @xmath21 ) and the wmap - team @xcite ( namely @xmath22 ) , while for the dispersion we took the bigger one of the two , i.e. from @xcite .",
    "we therefore sample 2955 values of spectral indices from a gaussian distribution with mean @xmath20 and dispersion 0.65 and rescale the simulated flux densities for the v - channel with these spectral indices to simulated flux densities in the w - channel .",
    "similarly to the approach in the v - channel we use the 113 actual flux densities from real data which are bigger then @xmath23 in one of the two channels .    except for the 113 strong sources , for which we use amplitude and position estimated from real data , the position of the remaining sources are simulated randomly across the full sky . since in @xcite",
    "we identify two point source as the same if their separation is less than @xmath24 , we simulate all those sources which are stronger than the smallest detected flux density in v - band wmap data at least @xmath24 from each other ( but there is no such condition with respect to weaker sources ) .    in order to get a good estimate on the uncertainty of estimated power spectra",
    "we create 10000 realisations , for both the v and w channel , of cmb fluctuations ( based on the wmap best - fitting @xmath0 , @xcite ) , noise and then add the ( same ) pure point source map obtained as explained above .",
    "the basic idea is to estimate and compare the power spectrum @xmath0 obtained by either removing or masking detected sources .",
    "we will estimate the two autospectra vv and ww , the cross - spectrum vw as well as the optimal noise - weighted co - added combination of the autospectra .",
    "our procedure will be applied to the full ensemble of simulated maps as well as to the actual wmap7 data .",
    "note that some steps are slightly different when using real data rather than simulations .",
    "when this is the case it will be shown in the step - by - step description in the following paragraph .",
    "the reason for these differences is the need to save cpu time .    given that we have a set of simulated or actual maps for the v- and w - band , step - by - step our procedure is :    1 .",
    "use the detection algorithm presented in @xcite to detect point sources : + simulations : : :    sources are counted as detected in the v - band if    +    * they are found at @xmath25 directly in v.    * they are found at @xmath25 in w : in this case we    search in v in a disc of radius @xmath26 around the    position in w and if a source at @xmath27 is found , it    is counted as detected in v. this is different from the approach used    in @xcite where we tested for @xmath25 in the internal    templates and then searched for @xmath27 in the given    band ( note that the radius of the disc to search was defined from the    error bars on the position of the source , this is what we have used to    obtain @xmath26 in the present case ) .",
    "since we only    simulate the v and w channels , we only have one single internal    template available with a small frequency difference making the    internal template approach inefficient .",
    "+    we use the same approach to define detected sources in the w - band .",
    "wmap 7-year data : : :    we use the 665 point sources detected in the q , v and w channel as    presented in @xcite .",
    "we use both the point sources which were    detected at @xmath28 in the channels and those detected    using the internal template approach as described in the preceding    paragraph .",
    "2 .   construct the co - added map defined as the noise - weighted sum of the two frequency bands : @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the combine map , @xmath31 the map at channel @xmath32 and the weights @xmath33 are given by:@xmath34 with @xmath35 being the rms in pixel @xmath36 of the instrumental noise in channel @xmath32 and the sum is over all pixels @xmath36 .",
    "3 .   multiply the maps @xmath37 , @xmath38 and the co - added map @xmath30 with the kq85y7 galactic mask ( we would like to stress _ galactic _",
    ", no point sources at all are masked in this step ) .",
    "simulations : : :    remove the best - fitting models of the detected sources in each channel    to create the maps @xmath39 , @xmath40 and    @xmath41 .",
    "wmap 7-year data : : :    remove the 665 detected point sources for which we have flux density    estimates both from the band - averaged q , v and w channels as well as    from the 8 individual differencing assemblies ( das ) q1 until w4 .",
    "the    different da - maps are needed for better estimation of the unresolved    point source amplitude .",
    "we also would like to point out that we only    estimate the power spectrum in the v- and w - band , so in principle the    q - band is not needed .",
    "however , to estimate the contribution of    unresolved sources in real data , we also need the q - band to get    smallest possible error bars ( note that we need the q - band only to    obtain the contribution from unresolved sources , it is not used    further ) .",
    "this is the reason why we also need to remove sources in the    q - band and q - das .",
    "simulations : : :    create a mask which masks the detected sources in each channel with    radius of @xmath42 .",
    "then we    multiply the 3 maps with point sources with the mask obtaining    @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "wmap 7-year data : : :    create a mask which masks the 665 detected sources in each channel    with radius of @xmath42 .",
    "in addition , we also use    different masking schemes , as will be described in detail in     [ sec : realdata ] and like in the preceding step we mask both the    band - averaged channels and the das .",
    "6 .   estimate the power spectrum @xmath0 using the master algorithm @xcite with different channel - combinations obtaining : @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 .",
    "estimate also the cross - power - spectra @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "note that for multipoles @xmath54 we use inverse - noise weighting , like it was done by the wmap - team in the 7-year analysis , see @xcite .",
    "correct for a small bias in the power spectrum introduced by the residuals of the removed sources . we know",
    "that at the position of a removed source , there is a residual source with mean zero and standard deviation given by the error bar on the amplitude of the source .",
    "furthermore , this residual sources have a slightly asymmetric form due to the uncertainty in the estimated position .",
    "+ simulations : : :    correct for this residual source bias in the power spectrum by taking    the mean spectrum of 1000 source subtracted simulated maps where we    subtract the pure cmb power spectrum .",
    "we use the same approach to    check if there are residuals outside the point source holes when    masking , but find that the correction in this case is negligible .",
    "wmap 7-year data : : :    in the v and w channels we use the same procedure as for the    simulations , but the flux densities of the input sources used in the    simulations of 1000 source subtracted maps for the bias estimation    were all taken from actual values estimated in real data . as explained    in step 4 , we also need the q - band for estimating the unresolved point    source amplitude to higher precision . in order to save cpu time and    avoid having to run full simulations for the q - band to obtain the    residual source correction , we run simplified simulations which we    have verified give consistent values for the unresolved source    contributions .",
    "this consists of pure source simulations where we    subtract random model sources based on the standard deviations of the    estimated amplitudes and positions .",
    "the only difference with the full    approach used for the v- and w - band is that the correlation between    estimated amplitude and the background cmb and noise is missing .",
    "correct for the contribution of the unresolved point sources contribution following the method of the wmap team , first presented in @xcite .",
    "some simplifications were made with respect to the procedure of @xcite .",
    "namely : * we use the following power spectra of the cmb obtained in different bands : + simulations : : :    the band - average ( not the different das per band ) spectra and the only    three available spectra ( vv , vxw and ww ) are used , hence we are also    using auto - spectra wmap 7-year data : : :    all 28 da cross combinations ( eg .",

    "a bit more in detail , we compute the standard deviation of the estimated power spectrum @xmath57 of the 10000 simulations",
    ". then we obtain @xmath56 from : + @xmath58 + where @xmath0 is the best - fitting power spectrum from wmap ( input in the simulations ) and @xmath59 is the noise power , computed with the appropriate mask . *",
    "define the covariance matrix @xmath55 , where @xmath60 and @xmath61 are channel combinations ( for simulations : vv , vxw or ww , for wmap 7-year data : the 28 da cross combinations ) , with @xmath56 and @xmath59 obtained as described above . * the uncertainty on the estimated amplitude @xmath62",
    "is given by : + simulations : : :    the standard deviation of @xmath62 of the 9000 simulations    ( only 9000 , because we used 1000 simulations for estimating the bias    of the residuals ) .",

    "the results in the following section show though that the two approaches are consistent , making it possible to estimate the power spectrum using only a galaxy mask .",
    "in figs . [ fig : clr_sim ] ( removed point sources ) and [ fig : clm_sim ] ( relative difference between masked and removed ) we show the average spectra obtained from the 9000 simulations from the combined map @xmath30 .",
    "the results are very similar for the vv , ww autospectra and vxw cross - spectrum , thus , we only show the co - added v+w results here . in the top plot of the first figure",
    "we show the whole @xmath1-range before and after the correction of unresolved point source contribution , while in the bottom plot we show the high multipole range ( 600 to 1000 ) .",
    "we also show the size of the bias introduced by the point source residuals ( difference between top black curve and grey curve ) .",
    "as one would expect it becomes non - negligible only at high multipoles ( @xmath63 ) .",
    "with respect to the relative difference between the two approaches , see fig .",
    "[ fig : clm_sim ] , one can remark that they are in very good agreement , having a maximal relative difference smaller than 0.1% .",
    "we would like to point out that in some of the autospectra a small bias , below 1% , is present at high multipoles , which disappears if we redo the simulations with constant spectral index .",
    "the reason for this small bias is that the method for subtracting unresolved point sources @xcite assumes a constant spectral index and we found that this bias appears in the realistic case with varying spectral index .",
    "this bias is present at the same level for both source removal and source masking .",
    "one of the reasons why we try two approaches ( masking and removing ) is that if one removes the point sources instead of masking them one uses a bigger part of the sky ( and hence more information ) to compute the cmb power spectrum .",
    "one would therefore expect that the standard deviation of the power spectrum found in the 9000 simulations is smaller when we remove the point sources instead of masking them .",
    "this is indeed the case as we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : stdev_sim ] , where we see the relative difference between the standard deviation of the power spectrum of the masking approach @xmath64 and the removing approach @xmath65 normalized to the ( standard ) masking approach .",
    "we also plotted a curve where we removed the cosmic variance s contribution to the standard deviation ; one can deduce from that that the difference in noise between the two methods is small but non - negligible being at maximum @xmath66 . the increase in accuracy is expected to become substantial for the multipoles which are close in angular extension to the size of the holes ( the point sources are masked with a hole of radius 0.6@xmath67 ) and fig .",
    "[ fig : stdev_sim ] shows that this is indeed the case .",
    "note that in some realistic experiments , beam asymmetries may be so large that systematic errors in the point source removal procedure may partially cancel the decrease in error bars due to increased sky fraction .    .",
    "the horizontal black line represents zero .",
    "nb : for visibility , not all bins below multipole 20 are shown . ]     when masking or removing , normalised to the standard deviation of the standard approach ( i.e. masking , black curve ) .",
    "the grey curve is relative difference of the standard deviations with the cosmic variance contribution removed .",
    "based on 9000 simulations . ]",
    "as opposed to simulations , we do not only remove or mask , but ( both when removing and masking ) we use different kinds of masks .",
    "first of all we use the kq85y7 mask ( galaxy and point sources mask ) to check whether we obtain the same value of the unresolved point source contribution amplitude as the wmap - team , obtaining : @xmath68 [ @xmath69 .",
    "this is in good agreement with the value obtained by the wmap team : @xmath70 [ @xmath69 ( @xcite ) .",
    "we point out that the uncertainty on @xmath62 is now calculated the same way as by the wmap team ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the reason that the error on the estimated @xmath62 we obtain is bigger than the one of the wmap team is due to a combination of having a different @xmath56 and having a different noise power entering the covariance matrix @xmath55 making the estimator slightly non - optimal .",
    "these simplifications which lead to slightly larger error bars do not compromise the results of this paper",
    ".    then we use the following masking schemes :    basic mask : :    we only remove respectively mask the 665 detected point sources ( for    which we have flux densities ) from the maps in the channels or    @xmath28 in the template and @xmath71 in the    channel ) in at least q , v or w band , not forcefully in all 3 channels ,    when masking we mask all 665 independently of the channel . ] and use    the galaxy mask to obtain the amplitude @xmath62 and the    combined spectra +    @xmath72 @xmath73 and    @xmath74 respectively @xmath75    and @xmath76 with @xmath60 being a    combination of channels or das ; extended mask : :    we check for any coefficients of the needlet transform of respectively    the q- , v- and w - band maps still at @xmath25 after    removing or masking the point sources and extend the galactic mask    with a disc of @xmath42 around these pixels .",

    "we also would like to stress that when only removing the detected point sources and not using any additional masking ( a part of the galactic mask ) we are able to obtain consistent results ( see for instance , figures [ fig : exple ] ) . hence making it possible to estimate the power spectrum @xmath0 without any point source masking !",
    "if there were no point sources ( resolved or unresolved ) or other foregrounds in the sky maps , one would expect the skewness to be zero ( with the exception of tiny deviations expected from a non - zero value of the @xmath106 parameter , see for instance @xcite , where they conclude that wmap 7-year data are consistent with @xmath107 to 95% cl ) .",
    "the presence of point sources , though , introduces a positive skewness in the maps , since they give a positive contribution to the map , which does not have a negative counterpart . in order to test our approach of removing point sources we",
    "therefore are interested in how much ( if at all ) the skewness changes after point source removal .",
    "we do this for 10000 simulations in both v and w channels .    in analogy",
    "to @xcite we define the skewness @xmath108 at frequency @xmath109 as : @xmath110    where :    * @xmath111 is the needlet coefficient at frequency @xmath109 and pixel @xmath112 , multiplied by the galactic mask ; * @xmath113 is the number of pixels outside the mask ; * @xmath114 is the standard deviation of the needlet coefficients , defined as : @xmath115    the first step in our skewness analysis is to get the uncertainty ( in terms of the standard deviation ) of the estimated skewness @xmath108 .",
    "we do this by computing the skewness for 10000 simulated maps ( in both the v and w channel ) with cmb and noise , but no point sources , obtaining @xmath116 .",
    "we also check how much and at which frequency @xmath109 of the needlet skewness is introduced ( in average ) when there are point sources present .",
    "we therefore compute the average skewness @xmath117 of 10000 maps with noise , cmb and point sources .",
    "the next step is to see what the skewness becomes when there are only unresolved sources .",
    "we simulate 10000 maps per channel with only unresolved sources , cmb and noise but no sources above the detection limit .",
    "we then calculate the average skewness @xmath118 of these 10000 maps .",
    "the last step is to check whether the removal of point sources changes the skewness . in order to do this ,",
    "we compute the average skewness @xmath119 for 10000 maps with the noise , cmb , unresolved point sources and the detected point sources removed using best - fitting models .    in figures [ fig : skew_onlyu ]",
    "we show the average skewnesses @xmath117 ( black line , stars ) , @xmath118 ( black line , squares)and @xmath119 ( black line , plus - signs ) for the two needlets we use in the simulations , namely for v standard needlets with @xmath120 and for w mexican needlets with @xmath121 and @xmath122 .",

    "@xmath117 ) is only @xmath127 for needlet coefficients",
    "@xmath128 with frequencies @xmath109 corresponding to small angular resolution .",
    "for instance , for the standard needlets ( see top figure of plots [ fig : skew_onlyu ] ) there is a skewness @xmath129 only for frequencies @xmath130 $ ] , which correspond to @xmath1-ranges - range seen by a needlet at frequency @xmath109 is given by @xmath131 $ ] . ] [ 128,512 ] and [ 256,1024 ] , which in turn corresponds to angular extensions of @xmath132 $ ] and @xmath133 $ ] degrees .",
    "this shows why there is no visible skewness at frequencies @xmath109 smaller than 8 , since it would imply that the point source is visible over an angular extension bigger than approximately 1 degree .",
    "there is no substantial difference of the skewness of the maps where we simulated and then removed the detected point sources ( @xmath119 ) and the maps where we only simulated unresolved point sources ( @xmath118 ) .",
    "it follows directly that point source removal does not introduce any skewness . if this were not the case , it would mean that our estimate of the amplitude of the point sources is biased .",
    "this skewness analysis hence consolidates the point source removal approach .",
    "in this work we have studied ( 1 ) whether masking all the additional wmap point sources reported in @xcite changes the wmap estimate of the power spectrum compared to the spectrum obtained using the wmap point source mask with much less point sources masked and ( 2 ) whether removing best - fitting source models instead of masking the detected point sources yields consistent results .",
    "we compared the masking and removing approaches by making realistic simulations of 9000 maps with cmb , noise and point sources in each of the v and w channels ( see  [ sec : create_sims ] ( creating simulations ) and  [ sec : sim_res ] ( analysis of simulations ) ) . in figs .",
    "[ fig : clr_sim ] ( removed point sources ) and [ fig : clm_sim ] ( difference between masked and removed point sources ) we show that when estimating the @xmath0 both approaches give consistent results .",
    "when computing the standard deviation ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : stdev_sim ] ) we see that , as expected since there is more information , the standard deviation of the estimated power spectrum when removing the point sources is smaller than when they are masked .",
    "we remark though that when removing point sources one has to account for the bias introduced by the uncertainty on estimating the point source position and amplitude .",
    "when considering wmap 7-year data (  [ sec : realdata ] ) we also compare the two approaches estimating the cmb power spectrum .",
    "but additionally we also use different masks removing different fractions of the 2102 point sources detected in @xcite . after removing respectively masking with the different masks ( and correcting for the bias introduced by residual sources in case of removing ) , the two approaches and different masks give rise to different values of the amplitude @xmath62 of the unresolved point source contribution ,",
    "the values are summarized in table [ tab : aps ] .",
    "we remark that when using the mask of all 2102 point sources detected at @xmath28 in either channels or templates , our estimate of @xmath62 is substantially smaller than the estimate from the wmap - team : @xmath134 ( removing and masking ) and @xmath135 ( only masking ) versus @xmath136 from the wmap - team with the kq85y7 mask ( all amplitudes @xmath62 in units of @xmath137 $ ] ) .",
    "hence this new mask presents a big improvement , with less contamination by unresolved point sources .",
    "we found that the power spectrum obtained when removing the 665 detected sources for which we have flux density estimates and using only the galactic mask ( no point source mask ) , is fully consistent with the power spectrum obtained when masking all the 2102 detected sources as well as those from the kq85y7 point source mask .",
    "the consistency amongst different masking schemes and methods to obtain the power spectrum was tested with a @xmath102 test , yielding values of @xmath102 for real data , well between @xmath102 values obtained from corresponding simulations ( see  [ sec : realdata ] for numbers ) .",
    "this shows ( 1 ) that it suffices to take into account only the sources detected by the wmap team and correct for the remaining sources through the unresolved source correction and ( 2 ) that removing the best - fitting source models works as well as masking them .",
    "the advantage of removing is that for some cmb analysis methods ( especially wavelet / filter based methods ) , the point source holes reduce significantly the sky fraction which can be used on the filtered maps .",
    "note however , that in the case of point source removal , the appropriate correction for residual sources has to be applied .",
    "the removing approach is also verified with respect to skewness , where we showed that the fact of removing point sources does not introduce any form of skewness , showing that the removal of point sources is an unbiased approach .",
    "the different masks , the different pure point source maps for each da ( which can be used to remove sources in temperature maps to obtain clean maps ) and the residual power corrections are available on : ` http://folk.uio.no/frodekh/ps_catalogue/ `    ssc would like to thank s.k .",
