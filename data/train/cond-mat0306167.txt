    "the interplay between spin models and percolation has been put into evidence since the fundamental work of fortuin and kasteleyn @xcite , where it is shown that percolation is the limit for @xmath0 of the random cluster representation of q - states potts model . this representation , as already pointed out in @xcite , is very general and can be performed on any discrete structure , i.e. on graph .",
    "a further step has been the result proven in @xcite , showing that , on lattices , the existence of percolation implies potts transition for any value of @xmath1 .",
    "the main purpose of this work is the extension of the result to generic networks .",
    "an important issue in this direction has been a mathematical paper @xcite proving that potts model has more than one gibbs measure if it is defined on graphs showing percolation .",
    "the multiplicity of gibbs measures is the most used definition of symmetry breaking in mathematical literature .",
    "however , it does not always correspond to the thermodynamic concept of phase transition .    indeed , in the study of the thermodynamic properties of physical systems , we are interested in the free energy and its derivatives such as the average magnetization , the susceptibility , the specific heat , which are typical average extensive quantities . on the other hand ,",
    "the existence of a single gibbs measure , as explained in @xcite , depends on a local parameter , that is the magnetization of a site of the graph . on lattices",
    ", translation invariance implies that local and average quantities coincide ( the proof of @xcite depends on this fact ) .",
    "however , for inhomogeneous structures the results can be different in the two cases .",
    "for example , on the brush graph ( see figure 1 ) as we will prove in detail , there is not a single gibbs measure , but the thermodynamic functions do not present discontinuities and the spontaneous magnetization is zero .    a generalization of the result @xcite , which takes into account the thermodynamic behaviour of the system , requires the introduction of the new problem of percolation on the average . a graph @xmath2 is said to present percolation on the average if the average , over all sites , of the probability of belonging to a cluster of size greater than @xmath3 remains positive when @xmath4 .",
    "we will prove that the q - states potts model on a graph @xmath2 is spontaneously magnetized if and only if @xmath2 presents percolation on the average .",
    "therefore , the study of spin models with discrete symmetry leads to a classification of graph topology which can be formulated in terms of a purely combinatorial problem .",
    "an analogous result @xcite has been previously obtained for classical spin models with continuous symmetry , where the thermodynamic behaviour depends on a different combinatorial problem , i.e. random walks . in particular ,",
    "the models present spontaneous magnetization if and only if the graph is transient on the average @xcite ( i.e. a graph where the average probability for a random - walk of ever returning to the starting site is smaller than 1 ) .",
    "this two classifications are different , indeed , it is well known that lattices presenting percolation ( i.e. lattices with dimension @xmath5 ) are transient on the average only if @xmath6 . in recent works @xcite",
    ", it has been proved that the `` anomalous '' behaviour of presenting average percolation in a recurrent on the average structure is typical not only of two dimensional lattices , but also of low dimensional networks , such as the sierpinski carpet .",
    "therefore , a general result clarifying the relation between the two classifications is still lacking .",
    "furthermore , up to now we do not know if percolation on the average is related to graph topology by a simple parameter , as it is the spectral dimension @xcite in the case of transience on the average .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we introduce the potts model and percolation on graph , we define percolation on the average and we state the main result of the paper , i.e. potts model is spontaneously magnetized if and only it is defined on a graph presenting percolation on the average . in the last 2 sections we prove the theorem .",
    "a graph @xmath2 ( see e.g. @xcite for an introduction to graph theory ) is a countable set @xmath7 of vertices or sites @xmath8 connected pairwise by a set @xmath9 of unoriented edges or links @xmath10 .",
    "connected sites are called nearest neighbours and we denote with @xmath11 the connectivity ( number of neighbours ) of the site @xmath8 .",
    "a path is a sequence of consecutive links @xmath12 .",
    "the chemical distance @xmath13 is the length ( number of links ) of the shortest path connecting the sites @xmath8 and @xmath14 .",
    "the van hove sphere @xmath15 of center @xmath16 and radius @xmath17 is the set of the sites of @xmath2 such that @xmath18 .",
    "we will call @xmath19 the set of all @xmath20 such that @xmath21 , @xmath22 the set of the vertices of @xmath23 connected with the rest of the graph and we denote with @xmath24 the cardinality of a set .",
    "let @xmath25 be a real function of the sites of an infinite graph , the average in the thermodynamic limit @xmath26 is @xmath27 interesting properties of the thermodynamic average , such as the independence of the choice of the center @xmath16 , are proved in @xcite .",
    "therefore , in the following we will drop the index @xmath16 .",
    "the measure @xmath28 of a subset @xmath29 of @xmath7 is the average value @xmath30 of its characteristic function @xmath31 defined by @xmath32 if @xmath33 and @xmath34 if @xmath35 .",
    "important constraints on graph topology follow from the requirement to describe a physical network .",
    "real systems , indeed , have bounded local energy and they are embedded in a finite dimensional space .",
    "therefore , we will consider only connected graphs with bounded connectivity ( @xmath36 @xmath37 ) and such that : @xmath38    the definition of the q - states potts model ( see e.g. @xcite for a review ) on an infinite graph @xmath2 first requires to introduce the model on the van hove spheres @xmath39 .",
    "for each site @xmath40 @xmath41 is a q state function @xmath42 and the hamiltonian is given by : @xmath43 where the kronecker delta - function is @xmath44 if @xmath45 and @xmath46 otherwise .",
    "notice that the case @xmath47 is the ising model . in the canonical ensemble",
    "the partition function @xmath48 is given by the sum of the boltzmann weight @xmath49 over all possible configurations @xmath50 ; @xmath51 represents the inverse temperature of the system .",
    "thermodynamic properties of statistical models are described by extensive order parameters , in this case the average magnetization : @xmath52 where @xmath53 denotes the thermal average .",
    "the potts model on @xmath2 presents spontaneous magnetization if it exists @xmath54 such that for all @xmath55 @xmath56 the existence of the thermodynamic limit @xmath57 is always assumed in this article .",
    "percolation ( see e.g. @xcite for a mathematical and a physical treatment ) is defined by introducing a probability @xmath58 , @xmath59 and each link @xmath20 is declared to be open with probability @xmath58 and closed with probability @xmath60 independently .",
    "the cluster @xmath61 containing the site @xmath8 is the set of all the sites connected with @xmath8 by a path of open links .",
    "the i - size of the cluster @xmath61 is the maximum chemical distance from @xmath8 of the sites of @xmath61 .",
    "we call @xmath62 the probability for @xmath8 to belong to a cluster of i - size @xmath63 .",
    "a graph @xmath2 is said to present ( local ) percolation if it exists a probability @xmath64 such that @xmath65 . on a graph with bounded connectivity",
    "this property is independent of @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "a graph presents percolation on the average if it exists a probability @xmath58 such that @xmath66 percolation on the average is a new combinatorial problem and it gives rise to a graph classification which turns out to be fundamental for understanding the thermodynamic behaviour of physical models on graph . in the main theorem of the paper , indeed , we prove that the q - states potts model is spontaneously magnetized if and only if it is defined on a graph presenting percolation on the average , obtaining a generalization to inhomogeneous structures of the classical result for lattices by aizenman et al .",
    "the proof is mainly inspired by @xcite and @xcite .    first , following @xcite , we introduce a representation of the q - states potts model in terms of the q - random cluster model on the supplemented graph @xmath67 .",
    "then , from an important property of the random cluster stated in @xcite , we get an inequality between the local magnetization and the percolation probability on the supplemented graph : this is an extension of @xcite to the case @xmath68 . in the second part of the proof",
    "we take the thermodynamic average and we show that the physical requirements on the graph allow to formulate the inequality for the average magnetization in terms of average percolation on @xmath2 .",
    "the theorem directly follows from this inequality .",
    "let us first show that local and average percolation define different classifications of inhomogeneous networks . in particular , the brush graph ( figure 1 ) presents local percolation but no percolation on the average .",
    "if we choose @xmath58 larger than the threshold of the two - dimensional percolation and we call @xmath17 the distance of @xmath8 from the plane of the brush , we have that @xmath69 ( @xmath70 is the probability that a site of a two - dimensional lattice belongs to a cluster of size @xmath71 ) and then @xmath72 . on the other hand for all the sites of the brush at a distance from the plane greater than @xmath3 we have @xmath73 , @xmath74 is the probability for a site of a linear chain to belong to a cluster of i - size greater than @xmath3 .",
    "we call @xmath75 the subset of the brush graph given by the sites whose distance from the plane is smaller than @xmath3",
    ". we have @xmath76 and @xmath77 therefore , on the brush graph the q - states potts model does not have a single gibbs measure @xcite , however the system is not spontaneously magnetized and the thermodynamic functions are analytical .",
    "let us define the supplemented q - random cluster model @xcite .",
    "we call @xmath67 the graph obtained by adding to @xmath2 a supplementary site @xmath16 connected by a new link to each site of @xmath2 .",
    "the supplemented spheres are obtained by adding to the spheres @xmath39 the new vertex @xmath16 and the relevant edges .",
    "we will call @xmath78 and @xmath79 the set of sites and the set of links of the supplemented sphere . the configurations @xmath80 of the supplemented random cluster model on @xmath78",
    "are obtained by declaring each link of @xmath81 open or closed .",
    "the supplemented q - random cluster model @xcite is defined by choosing each configuration according the probability distribution : @xmath82 where @xmath58 , @xmath83 and @xmath1 are real parameters of the model ( @xmath84 , @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "@xmath87 is the number of open links in @xmath88 , @xmath89 the number of open links connecting @xmath16 to @xmath39 and @xmath90 the number of clusters in the configuration ( @xmath91 and @xmath92 are respectively the cardinality of @xmath39 and @xmath88 ) . for @xmath93 and @xmath94",
    "the random cluster model is exactly the percolation model restricted to the sphere @xmath39 .",
    "as already pointed out in the original work by fortuin and kasteleyn @xcite , q - states potts model and q - random cluster model are equivalent on any graph @xmath2 .",
    "indeed if we fix @xmath95 and @xmath96 , their partition functions coincide and @xmath97 where @xmath98 if @xmath99 and @xmath100 otherwise .",
    "then , @xmath101 represents the probability for the site @xmath8 to belong to the same cluster of the supplemented site @xmath16 .",
    "the space of configurations of the random - cluster model is equipped by the partial order : @xmath102 if the set of open links in @xmath80 is included or equal to the set of open links in @xmath103 .",
    "we will say that the probability distribution @xmath104 stochastically dominates the probability distribution @xmath105 ( @xmath106 ) if : @xmath107 for all increasing function @xmath108 .",
    "in @xcite it is proved that important inequalities for the probability distributions follow from fkg @xcite theorem .",
    "these inequalities can be easily generalized to the case of supplemented graph , obtaining : @xmath109 where @xmath110 and @xmath111 .    since @xmath112 is an increasing function , from ( [ pottsrndclus ] ) and ( [ ineq1 ] ) we have :",
    "@xmath113 ( [ ineq2 ] ) is an extension to the case @xmath68 of the inequality for local magnetization proved in @xcite .",
    "let us first take the average of ( [ ineq2 ] ) over all the sites of the sphere @xmath39 .",
    "we obtain latexmath:[\\[\\label{ineq3 }     provide upper and lower bounds for the magnetization of the potts model in terms of the percolation model defined on the supplemented sphere @xmath78 .",
    "let us reformulate these bounds in terms of the percolation on @xmath2 .",
    "first we prove a property of graphs with bounded connectivity and satisfying ( [ isop ] ) . in the probability measure defined on @xmath39 by ( [ defrc ] ) with @xmath93 and @xmath94 , we call @xmath115 the probability for the site @xmath8 to belong to a cluster of i - size greater than @xmath3 .",
    "let us show that in the thermodynamic averages one can substitute @xmath115 with the probability defined on the infinite graph @xmath62 .",
    "we will call @xmath116 the subset of @xmath39 of all the sites @xmath8 such that the distance of @xmath8 from the border @xmath117 is larger than @xmath3 and @xmath118 its complementary in @xmath39 . for the sites",
    "@xmath119 all the clusters @xmath61 of i - size smaller than @xmath3 are included in @xmath39 , then the probability of belonging ( or not belonging ) to one of these clusters is equal in percolation on @xmath2 and in percolation on @xmath39 .",
    "furthermore we have that : @xmath120 where we used ( [ isop ] ) and the boundedness of the coordination number .",
    "then @xmath115 and @xmath62 differ only on a set of zero measure and in the thermodynamic averages we can exchange one for the other .",
    "let us now prove the main theorem of the paper . from the boundedness of the correlation number and the independence of percolation probabilities ,",
    "one gets the inequality : @xmath121 indeed @xmath122 is the maximum number of sites in a cluster of i - size @xmath123 and then @xmath124 is an upper bound on the probability that a site of the cluster is connected to @xmath16 . from ( [ ineq3 ] ) and ( [ ineq4 ] ) taking the thermodynamic limit @xmath125 we have : @xmath126 letting @xmath127 , since also @xmath128 , we get @xmath129 now we have to consider the first inequality in ( [ ineq3 ] ) . from the probability independence in percolation , we get @xmath130 here @xmath131 is the minimum number of sites in a cluster of i - size @xmath63 , and then @xmath132 is a lower bound on the probability that a site of the cluster is connected to @xmath16 . taking the thermodynamic average we have @xmath133 letting first @xmath134 and then @xmath135 we have @xmath136 finally , from ( [ ineq6 ] ) and ( [ ineq9 ] ) one has @xmath137",
    "if the graph presents percolation on the average , it exists a probability @xmath138 such that @xmath139 and then the first inequality in ( [ ineq10 ] ) implies that the model for @xmath140 is magnetized . on the other hand , if @xmath141 for all values of @xmath58 , the second inequality in ( [ ineq10 ] ) implies that the magnetization of the system is zero for all temperatures and this concludes the proof .",
    "the result can be easily generalized to potts models with disordered ferromagnetic couplings described by the hamiltonian @xmath142 with @xmath143 for all @xmath144 .",
    "on the other hand an important open question is the possibility to extend the proof to different ferromagnetic spin models with discrete symmetry , such as the clock model .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , another basic problem is a better understanding of the relation between percolation on the average , transience on the average and graph topology .",
