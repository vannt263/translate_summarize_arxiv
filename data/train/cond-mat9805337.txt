    "the spin 1/2 xxz spin chain @xmath7 was first exactly studied by bethe @xcite in 1931 for @xmath8 extensively investigated for @xmath9 in 1960 by lieb , schultz and mattis @xcite and studied for general values of @xmath10 in 1966 by yang and yang @xcite-@xcite . since these initial studies",
    "the thermodynamics have been extensively investigated @xcite and by now are fairly well understood .",
    "the spin - spin correlations , however , are much more difficult to study and even the simplest of the equal time correlations @xmath11 is only partially understood after decades of research @xcite-@xcite . in this note",
    "we extend these investigations of @xmath12 for @xmath13 by means of an exact computer diagonalization of chains of @xmath0 and @xmath1 spins for @xmath14 our results are presented below in tables 1 - 7 and figs . 1 and 2 . in the remainder of this note",
    "we discuss the significance and the interpretation of these results .",
    "the correlation @xmath15 for the case @xmath9 was exactly computed long ago @xcite to be @xmath16 ^ 2&if $ n$ is odd\\cr \\delta_{n,0}&if $ n$ is even . } \\label{zerocor}\\ ] ] this correlation is manifestly never positive for @xmath17 when @xmath18 it simplifies to @xmath19 in the scaling limit where @xmath20 we have @xcite @xmath21    in the general case @xmath22 the nearest neighbor correlation at @xmath18 @xmath23 is obtained from the derivative of the ground state energy @xcite with respect to @xmath3 this correlation is negative for @xmath24 and is plotted in fig . 3 of ref@xcite .",
    "for large @xmath25 the behavior of @xmath26 at @xmath18 has been extensively investigated and for @xmath27 we have @xcite for @xmath28 @xmath29 where from ref.@xcite @xmath30 we note that @xmath31 and vanishes at the ferromagnetic point @xmath32 at @xmath9 we have @xmath33 and ( [ corra ] ) reduces to the exact result ( [ corr ] ) . for other values of @xmath10 only the limiting value as @xmath34 is known @xcite .    when @xmath13 the correlations decay exponentially for large @xmath25 instead of the algebraic decay ( [ corra ] ) of @xmath35 for @xmath36 it is known @xcite that for small fixed positive @xmath37 the large @xmath25 behavior of @xmath12 is @xmath38 in order to smoothly connect to the @xmath18 result ( [ corra ] ) we need @xmath39 but this has not yet been demonstrated .",
    "we note that for positive values of @xmath10 the exact nearest neighbor correlation at @xmath18 is negative and the leading term in the asymptotic behaviors ( [ corra ] ) and ( [ corrb ] ) oscillates as @xmath40 both of these facts are consistent with antiferromagnetism .    for negative values of @xmath41",
    "however , the situation is somewhat different . the nearest neighbor correlation at @xmath18 is negative and , indeed , since @xmath42 we see from ( [ corra ] ) that the asymptotic values of @xmath26 are also negative and there are no oscillations",
    ". this behavior can not be called antiferromagnetic because there are no oscillations but neither can it be called ferromagnetic because the correlations are negative instead of positive .    in order to further investigate the regime @xmath4 we have computed the correlation function @xmath12 by means of exact diagonalization for systems of @xmath0 and @xmath43 spins . our results for @xmath43 with @xmath44 and @xmath45 are given in tables 1 - 4 where we give @xmath12 for @xmath46 and @xmath47 for @xmath48 the factor of @xmath49 for @xmath50 is used because for @xmath51 there are two paths of equal length joining @xmath52 and @xmath25 in the finite system whereas for the same @xmath25 in the infinite size system there will be only one path of finite length . to estimate the precision with which the @xmath43 system gives the @xmath53 correlations we give in table 5 the correlation for @xmath0 and @xmath54 we see here that for @xmath55 the @xmath43 correlations are virtually identical with the @xmath0 correlations .",
    "even for @xmath56 and @xmath57 the @xmath43 data should be qualitatively close to the @xmath58 values .",
    "the tables 1 - 5 reveal for @xmath59 the striking property that @xmath60 which is always negative at @xmath61 becomes positive for fixed",
    "n at sufficiently large @xmath62 we study this further in table 6 where we list the values @xmath63 where @xmath64 this table indicates that @xmath65 we denote this limiting temperature by @xmath6 and note that this implies that in the expansion of @xmath12 obtained from the quantum transfer matrix formalism @xcite @xmath66 we have @xmath67 if , for large @xmath68 we retain only the first two terms in the expansion , ignore the @xmath37 dependence of @xmath69 and @xmath70 and write @xmath71 we see that the large @xmath25 behavior of @xmath63 may be estimated as @xmath72 where @xmath73 and @xmath74 in fig . 1 plot",
    "the data of table 6 versus a least squares fit using ( [ fit ] ) and find that the fit is exceedingly good even for small @xmath75 the values of the fitting parameters are given in table 7 for @xmath76 and @xmath6 is plotted in fig .",
    "the existence of this @xmath77 for @xmath4 is quite different from the case @xmath36 where for all temperatures the sign of @xmath12 is @xmath40    to interpret the property of changing sign we note that , when the hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) is written in terms of the basis where @xmath78 is diagonal @xmath79 the term @xmath80 is a kinetic energy term which translates a down spin one step whereas the term @xmath81 is a potential energy term which is diagonal in the basis of eigenstates of @xmath82 in classical statistical mechanics the static expectation values of position dependent operators are independent of the kinetic energy and depend only on the potential energy .",
    "if we further expect that at high temperatures the system should behave in a classical fashion we infer that at high temperatures for @xmath83 the correlation @xmath12 should be ferromagnetically aligned ie .",
    "@xmath84 this is indeed what is seen in tables 1 - 5 .",
    "however at low temperatures the quantum effects of the kinetic term can not be ignored .",
    "when @xmath9 there is no potential energy so all the behavior in @xmath15 can only come from the kinetic terms and hence the behavior given by ( [ zerocor ] ) in which @xmath15 is never positive for @xmath5 must be purely quantum mechanical .",
    "consequently it seems appropriate to refer to the change of sign of the correlation @xmath12 as a quantum to classical crossover .",
    "the low temperature behavior of the correlation function is determined by conformal field theory .",
    "in particular we consider the scaling limit ( [ scaling ] ) and define the scaling function @xmath85 the prescription of conformal field theory is that this scaling function is obtained from the large @xmath25 behavior of the @xmath18 correlation given by the first term of ( [ corra ] ) by the replacement [ page 513 of ref.@xcite ] @xmath86 where the decay constant @xmath87 can be obtained by use of the methods of ref .",
    "this replacement is obtained by combining the conformal field theory results on finite size corrections @xcite with the field theory relation of finite strip size to nonzero temperature @xcite .",
    "this prescription clearly leads to a correlation which is always negative and does not show the sign changing phenomena seen in the tables 1 - 5 .",
    "however , this result is only a limiting result as @xmath88 the results of this paper indicate that there is further physics in the high temperature behavior of the xxz chain where @xmath89 which is not contained in this conformal field theory result .",
