    "two - dimensional ( 2d ) electron gases are ubiquitous in modern semiconductor devices .",
    "surprisingly , however , there remain significant gaps in our knowledge of the properties exhibited by these fascinating systems . in recent years",
    "experimentalists have realized increasingly high - quality ( low - disorder ) 2d homogeneous electron gases ( hegs ) at low densities in quantum - well structures@xcite and field - effect transistors.@xcite as the density is lowered , correlation effects play an ever more important role , and it is hoped that the resulting exotic behavior could be exploited in a new generation of electronic and spintronic devices . at very low densities",
    "the coulomb repulsion between the electrons dominates , and the heg forms a wigner crystal.@xcite at higher densities the kinetic energy dominates and the electrons form a fermi fluid , in which most properties are qualitatively ( and at high densities , quantitatively ) similar to those of a free - electron gas . _",
    "_ fermi liquid theory__@xcite is the phenomenological framework within which the normal behavior of fermi fluids is understood .",
    "according to fermi liquid theory , low - lying excitation energies in hegs are free - electron - like , and the effects of interactions are encapsulated in ( i ) a renormalization of the electron mass ( the quasiparticle effective mass ) and ( ii ) a set of parameters describing the interaction of pairs of excited quasiparticles . in this work",
    "we use quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) methods to determine the quasiparticle effective mass by calculating single - particle excitation energies as differences in the total energy when electrons are either added to or removed from the ground state .    in our calculations",
    "we have used the variational monte carlo ( vmc ) and diffusion monte carlo ( dmc ) methods.@xcite in vmc we take the expectation value of the many - electron hamiltonian with respect to a slater - jastrow - backflow trial wave function,@xcite which is optimized by minimizing first the variance of the energy,@xcite then the energy expectation value@xcite with respect to free parameters in the wave function . in dmc@xcite",
    "we simulate a population of `` walkers '' whose dynamics are governed by the schrdinger equation in imaginary time in order to project out the ground - state component of an initial wave function .",
    "the fixed - node approximation@xcite is used to impose fermionic antisymmetry .",
    "all our qmc calculations were performed using the casino code.@xcite    in ref .",
    "we presented a dmc calculation of the 2d heg single - particle energy band , enabling us to predict the quasiparticle effective mass . in the present work we have had access to the jaguar machine at oak ridge leadership computing facility , enabling us to achieve higher accuracy in our dmc calculations , and leading to a refinement of our earlier work .",
    "the rest of this paper is structured as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : landau_e_fnal ] we give an overview of the relevant aspects of fermi liquid theory . in sec .",
    "[ sec : qmc_calcs ] we describe our computational approach .",
    "our results are presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] . finally , we draw our conclusions in sec .  [",
    "sec : conclusions ] .",
    "we use hartree atomic units , in which the dirac constant , the electronic charge and mass , and @xmath0 times the permittivity of free space are unity ( @xmath1 ) , throughout .",
    "according to fermi liquid theory the total energy of a heg in a particular excited state is given by the landau energy functional@xcite @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the change to the ground - state quasiparticle occupation number for wavevector @xmath4 and spin @xmath5 , and @xmath6 is the ground - state energy .",
    "the energy band @xmath7 is the energy of an isolated quasiparticle . near the fermi surface",
    ", the energy band may be assumed to be linear and hence we may write @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the fermi energy , @xmath10 is the fermi wavevector , and @xmath11 is the quasiparticle effective mass .",
    "the landau interaction function @xmath12 describes energy contributions arising from pairs of quasiparticles , and will not be considered further in this paper .",
    "the goal of this work is to obtain accurate values for the 2d heg quasiparticle effective mass @xmath11 in the thermodynamic limit at different densities and for different spin polarizations , giving us the most important contribution to the landau energy functional .",
    "both theoretical work@xcite and experimental studies@xcite have shown that the quasiparticle effective mass has a significant dependence on the spin polarization of the heg .",
    "we have calculated the effective mass for both paramagnetic and ferromagnetic ( fully spin - polarized ) hegs .",
    "fully spin - polarized hegs are experimentally relevant because they may be created by applying an in - plane magnetic field to a 2d electron system .",
    "differences in the quasiparticle effective masses of ferromagnetic and paramagnetic hegs result in differences in the transport properties , which could be exploited in electronic or spintronic applications , e.g. , in devices that use the spin - coulomb - drag effect.@xcite      the 2d hegs encountered in real devices are sufficiently large that they can be regarded as being of essentially infinite extent . in qmc simulations we can only study small numbers of electrons , however . for a heg in a finite simulation cell subject to periodic boundary conditions",
    ", momentum quantization limits the available wavevectors @xmath13 to a discrete lattice .",
    "furthermore , long - range coulomb and correlation effects can not be treated exactly in a finite cell,@xcite giving rise to finite - size errors in the energy band and hence effective mass .",
    "fermi liquid theory is only valid for excitations near the fermi surface : in this region the quasiparticle lifetime becomes large and hence the quasiparticle momentum occupancies are good quantum numbers.@xcite the energy band is defined by the landau energy functional at all @xmath4 , but does not correspond to the quasiparticle band except in the vicinity of the fermi surface . in the infinite - system limit ,",
    "the exact energy band is smooth in general and , if the quasiparticle effective mass is well - defined , the band must be at least differentiable at the fermi surface .",
    "in all our calculations the simulation cell was square and the simulation - cell bloch vector@xcite was @xmath14 .",
    "the number of electrons in the ground state was chosen to give a closed - shell configuration in each case .",
    "for ferromagnetic hegs , our calculations were performed with @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 electrons in the ground state . for paramagnetic hegs",
    "our calculations were performed with @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 electrons in the ground state .",
    "the simulation cell was identical for all excitations of a given heg ; hence the electron density increased when electrons were added and decreased when electrons were removed from the ground - state configuration .",
    "this procedure results in zero finite - size error for a free - electron gas .",
    "we use real , single - determinant trial wave functions for the closed - shell ground states , which is a computationally efficient approach that facilitates the optimization of the wave function . in our qmc calculations we used slater - jastrow - backflow trial wave functions .",
    "the jastrow factors consisted of polynomial and plane - wave expansions in the interelectron distances,@xcite while the backflow functions consisted of polynomial expansions in the interelectron distances.@xcite the polynomial expansions were cut off smoothly at the radius of the largest circle that could be inscribed in the simulation cell . the jastrow factor and backflow function contained a total of 35 and 17 free parameters , respectively , for paramagnetic hegs , and 27 and 8 free parameters , respectively , for ferromagnetic hegs .",
    "extrapolation of the vmc energy with different trial wave functions to zero energy variance@xcite suggests that our dmc calculations retrieved more than 99% of the correlation energy .    for each density , system size , and spin polarization",
    "the wave function was optimized in the ground state and the resulting jastrow factor and backflow function were used in all the excited states , with the exception of a couple of test cases , as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : wf_reopt ] .",
    "the dmc time steps used in our calculations were @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 a.u .  at @xmath25 , 5 , and 10 , respectively , for paramagnetic hegs , and @xmath26 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 a.u .  at @xmath25 , 5 , and 10 , respectively , for ferromagnetic hegs .",
    "it was verified that halving the time step had a negligible effect on the energy band : leading - order time - step errors cancel out of the total - energy differences involved .",
    "the target population exceeded 1200 configurations in each case , ensuring that population - control bias is negligible .",
    "the number of equilibration steps discarded from the start of each dmc calculation was sufficiently large that the root - mean - square distance diffused by each electron in the equilibration period exceeded the linear size of the simulation cell .",
    "the dmc energy band of the paramagnetic 2d heg , obtained with a slater - jastrow - backflow trial wave function , is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : para_energy_bands ] .",
    "analogous results for a fully ferromagnetic heg are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ferro_energy_bands ] .",
    "the energy bands calculated in this work at any given system size are in agreement with those calculated in ref .  , but the statistical error bars in the present work are very much smaller due to the considerably larger computational resource available .",
    "furthermore , the random noise in the trial wave function due to optimization by energy minimization with a finite sampling of configuration space is greatly reduced because of the enormous numbers of configurations that were used in the optimizations . as a result",
    "it is now possible to discern a systematic trend in the energy band with system size , with the bandwidth tending to increase with system size @xmath27 .",
    "this in turn leads to a reduction in the predicted quasiparticle effective mass in the thermodynamic limit , as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : qem ] .     for paramagnetic 2d hegs of density parameter ( a ) @xmath25 , ( b ) @xmath28 , and ( c ) @xmath29 at different system sizes @xmath27 . for the curves labeled `` reopt ,",
    "'' the wave function was optimized separately in the ground state and excited states .",
    "the free - electron and hartree - fock bands have been offset so that they coincide with the dmc bands at @xmath10 .",
    "the inset to panel ( a ) shows the energy band around @xmath30 in greater detail .",
    "[ fig : para_energy_bands],scaledwidth=40.0% ]    , but for ferromagnetic hegs .",
    "[ fig : ferro_energy_bands],scaledwidth=40.0% ]      the excitation of a single electron or pair of electrons has no effect on the optimal jastrow factor or backflow function in the thermodynamic limit ; hence the fact that the jastrow factor and backflow function can be reoptimized in an excited state in a finite cell is simply a manifestation of finite - size error . reoptimizing the wave function when an electron was subtracted from @xmath30 in a 26-electron heg at @xmath25 lowered the dmc energy by @xmath31 a.u . , reducing the dmc bandwidth and hence increasing the finite - size error , as can be seen for @xmath18 in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : para_energy_bands](a ) . in our calculations",
    "we therefore optimized the trial wave function in the ground state and then continued to use the same jastrow factor and backflow function in our excited - state calculations .        at each density , spin polarization , and system size a quartic function",
    "@xmath32 was fitted to the dmc energy - band values .",
    "the effective mass [ defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : qem_defn ] ) ] was then calculated as @xmath33    we have investigated the dependence of the estimate of the effective mass on the range of energy - band data used to perform the fit .",
    "figures [ fig : para_qem_v_deltak ] and [ fig : ferro_qem_v_deltak ] show the effective mass as a function of the range @xmath34 about the fermi wave vector over which we perform the fit .",
    "the figures also show the effective mass when energy - band data from within @xmath35% of @xmath10 are excluded from the fit .",
    "it is clear that the effective mass becomes pathological when @xmath34 becomes small ( i.e. , only excitations in the vicinity of @xmath10 are considered ) , for the reasons discussed briefly in sec .",
    "[ extrapolation ] and at length in ref .  .",
    "as the width of the region over which the fit is performed becomes larger , the effective mass estimates settle down to well - defined values that behave in a systematic fashion with system size .",
    "there is no evidence of any need to exclude data from around @xmath10 however : effectively , the fitting process averages out the pathological behavior in the vicinity of the fermi surface .     against range of wavevectors included in the quartic fit of the energy band .",
    "specifically , only wavevectors in the interval @xmath36 $ ] are used in the fit . for the dashed lines , wavevectors within 10% of @xmath10",
    "are excluded from the fit .",
    "[ fig : para_qem_v_deltak],scaledwidth=40.0% ]    , but for ferromagnetic hegs . for @xmath37 electrons , excluding wavevectors within 10% of @xmath10 eliminates all the wavevectors above @xmath10 at which energy - band data are available .",

    "[ fig : qem_scaling ] .",
    "a systematic trend in the effective mass as a function of system size can be seen .",
    "hence we are able to extrapolate the effective mass to the thermodynamic limit , significantly reducing finite - size errors .",
    "the effective - mass values that we report in this work are expected to be more accurate than those reported in ref .  .     against @xmath38 , where @xmath27 is the system size , for 2d hegs .",
    "[ fig : qem_scaling],scaledwidth=45.0% ]    the finite - size error does not show the @xmath39 behavior predicted by holzmann _ _ et al.__@xcite  for excitations near the fermi surface , presumably because we have fitted to the entire band .",
    "( any @xmath39 behavior in the band near the fermi surface is masked by the pathological behavior that is seen in hartree - fock theory and hence qmc.@xcite ) to investigate the behavior of the effective mass as a function of system size , we have fitted the function @xmath40 where @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 are fitting parameters , to the raw data shown in fig .
