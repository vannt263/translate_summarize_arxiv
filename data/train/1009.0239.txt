    "ensembles of ordinary random walks in one dimension @xcite are used to model physical , chemical , and biological processes ranging from wetting @xcite to the motion of colloidal particles in narrow channels @xcite and reaction - diffusion processes @xcite . in particular , first - passage properties @xcite of multiple random walks explain dynamics of interacting spins @xcite , lead changes in a voting process @xcite , and lifetime of knots in polymer chains @xcite .    in these examples , first - passage properties",
    "are intertwined with the ordering of the walkers @xcite .",
    "previous studies focused on first - passage statistics of extreme particles ; for example , the probability that a single prey particle survives the predators to its left @xcite .",
    "these problems involve a single first - passage probability and hence , a single first - passage exponent @xcite .    in this paper ,",
    "we ask first - passage questions that concern the bulk particles , not necessarily the extreme ones .",
    "we find that a family of first - passage exponents characterizes the first - passage kinetics .",
    "these exponents depend on two parameters : the particle order and the total number of particles . yet ,",
    "when the number of particles is very large , the exponents depend on a single scaling variable .",
    "this scaling behavior is unusual . in equilibrium as well as in non - equilibrium settings ,",
    "one or two scaling exponents quantify a scaling behavior @xcite . in the present case , however , the exponents themselves obey scaling , and remarkably , there are scaling laws for the scaling exponents .    , the position of the rightmost particle is @xmath10 and that of the leftmost particle is @xmath11.,scaledwidth=42.0% ]    we consider an array of @xmath0 identical particles that undergo simple random walk on a one - dimensional line , and investigate two different first - passage problems where the particle order plays an essential role .",
    "the first problem , discussed in sections ii - v , concerns the probability that the @xmath2th rightmost particle hasnt crossed the origin , if all particles start to the right of the origin ( figure [ fig - initial ] ) .",
    "this quantity equals the likelihood that @xmath12 out of all random walks have yet to simultaneously reside in the negative half - line . in the second problem , described in section vi ,",
    "we identify the particle order with rank , such that the rightmost particle is viewed as the leader , and similarly , the leftmost particle as the laggard .",
    "we ask : what is the probability that the rank of the initial leader does not fall below some specified threshold ?    in both problems , we find a family of nontrivial first - passage exponents . in both cases ,",
    "the exponents depend on two variables : the particle order and the total number of particles , @xmath0 .",
    "interestingly , in the large-@xmath0 limit , the exponents become a function of a single scaling variable . however , the similarities between the two problems end here as the two scaling variables are fundamentally different and moreover , the two scaling functions are dissimilar .",
    "our analysis relies on mapping the @xmath0 noninteracting random walks onto a single compound random walk in @xmath0 dimensions . by combining this mapping with exact and asymptotic properties for kinetics of first - passage inside a cone @xcite",
    ", we obtain approximate values for the first - passage exponents .",
    "the cone approximation is straightforward to implement , yet it yields useful estimates for exponents and in particular , this framework faithfully captures typical and extremal properties of the first - passage exponents .",
    "our system consists of @xmath0 identical particles .",
    "each particle undergoes a random walk on a one - dimensional lattice . at every time step ,",
    "one particle is selected at random , and it moves to the left , @xmath13 , or to the right @xmath14 , with equal probabilities .",
    "time is augmented by the inverse number of particles after each such step , @xmath15 .",
    "the particles always undergo independent random walks and hence , they are noninteracting .",
    "let @xmath16 be the position of the @xmath2th rightmost particle at time @xmath3 ( figure [ fig - initial ] ) .",
    "we consider the initial configuration where all particles are located in the positive half - line ( figure [ fig - initial ] ) , @xmath17 for all @xmath2 .",
    "we stress that it is not the initial order , but instead , the order at time @xmath3 , that sets the index @xmath2 .",
    "we are interested in @xmath1 , the probability that the @xmath2th rightmost particle remains in the positive half - line until time @xmath3 .",
    "hence , @xmath1 is the likelihood that @xmath18 for all @xmath19 .",
    "in particular , @xmath20 is the probability that the rightmost particle has yet to cross the origin , while @xmath21 is the probability that the leftmost particle has not crossed the origin .",
    "clearly , the probabilities @xmath22 decrease monotonically with @xmath2 , @xmath23    the `` survival '' probabilities @xmath1 generalize the classic survival probability of a single one - dimensional random walk in the presence of a trap .",
    "indeed , when @xmath24 , we have @xmath25 @xcite . as usual , the survival probability @xmath22 immediately gives the first - passage probability as @xmath26\\times dt$ ] is the probability that the @xmath2th rightmost particle crosses the origin for the first time during the infinitesimal time interval @xmath27 .",
    "the analytically solvable case of two particles yields valuable insights into the general behavior .",
    "when @xmath28 , we map the two random walks onto a single random walk in two dimensions . the position of the two - dimensional walk is specified by the positions of the two independent walks . at @xmath29 , the two - dimensional walk is always inside the first quadrant ( figure [ fig - rw2 ] ) .",

    "( b ) for @xmath30 , the random walk is confined to the interior of the first ( positive ) quadrant.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    the quantity @xmath20 is the probability that the coordinates of the two random walks have not become negative _ simultaneously _ up to time @xmath3 , or equivalently , the probability that the two - dimensional walk remains in the exterior of the third quadrant ( figure [ fig - rw2]a ) . to find the survival probability , we impose an absorbing boundary condition along the edge of the third quadrant ( figure [ fig - rw2]a ) .",
    "then @xmath20 is the probability that the compound particle avoids this absorbing boundary up to time @xmath3 .",
    "the region in which the random walk can move is a two - dimensional cone , or equivalently , a wedge with opening angle @xmath31 .",
    "( the opening angle @xmath32 is defined as the angle between the cone axis and the cone surface , so it lies within the bounds @xmath33 . )",
    "thus , @xmath20 equals the survival probability of a particle diffusing inside a wedge with an absorbing surface .",
    "this survival probability decays algebraically , @xmath34 in the long - time limit @xcite . by substituting @xmath31 into the general expression",
    ", we find the intriguing behavior @xmath35 as @xmath36 . as in",
    ", this asymptotic behavior holds regardless of the initial position , although the prefactor does depend on the initial conditions .    along the same lines ,",
    "@xmath37 is the probability that the positions of the two random walks remain positive up to time @xmath3 , or alternatively , the probability that the two - dimensional walk remains in the _ interior _ of the first quadrant ( figure [ fig - rw2]b ) .",
    "now , the boundary of the first quadrant is absorbing ( figure [ fig - rw2]b ) , and the random walk is confined to a wedge with opening angle @xmath38 . using , we again find power - law behavior albeit with a larger exponent , @xmath39 as shown below , this particular behavior follows from an elementary argument .",
    "the analytic results for a two - particle system suggest that generally , the survival probabilities decay algebraically , @xmath40 in the long - time limit .",
    "moreover , we expect that the decay exponents are distinct , and that @xmath41 increases monotonically with @xmath2 , @xmath42 consistent with",

    "the smallest and the largest exponents , listed respectively in tables vi - vii , show that the cone yields an excellent approximation . yet , the quality of the approximation declines ever so slightly as @xmath0 increases .",
    "monte carlo simulations with a large number of particles confirm the scaling behavior .",
    "moreover , we numerically verified that the entire survival probability becomes a universal function of the scaling variable @xmath50 , in analogy with , that is @xmath56 with @xmath57 , as @xmath7 .",
    "interestingly , the numerical results strongly suggest that the scaling function specified in is asymptotically _ exact _ ( figure [ fig - gamma ] ) .",
    "finally , the exponent @xmath58 , that characterizes the probability that the original leader always ranks higher than median has a simple limiting value , @xmath59 .     versus the scaling variable @xmath50 .",
    "the line shows the prediction of the cone approximation given in equation , as well as results of numerical simulations with @xmath60 ( bullets ) and @xmath61 particles ( squares).,scaledwidth=45.0% ]",
    "in summary , we investigated two first - passage problems involving ordered random walks in one dimension . in both cases , there is a series of survival probabilities and a nontrivial family of first - passage exponents .",
    "a universal function describes the exponents when the number of particles is very large .",
    "remarkably , there are scaling laws for the scaling exponents .    in general",
    ", a first - passage process with @xmath0 random walks is equivalent to diffusion in a high - dimensional space with a complicated absorbing boundary .",
    "this boundary is typically formed by multiple intersecting planes .",
    "solving the first - passage problem is equivalent to solving the electrostatic problem given these boundary conditions @xcite .",
    "for example , to find @xmath62 for a three - particle system , we must solve for the potential in the exterior of an insulating three - dimensional corner .",
    "yet , the solution , which likely requires an ingenious implementation of the image method , remains unknown even in this physically relevant geometry @xcite .",
    "to circumvent this difficulty , we introduced the cone approximation in which the absorbing boundary is replaced with the surface of a suitably chosen cone .",
    "this approximation is straightforward to implement and utilizes exact and asymptotic properties for first passage in a cone .",
    "the cone approximation provides useful estimates for the exponents and moreover , it faithfully captures both typical and extremal features . in particular , the cone approximation yields the correct scaling variable for the first - passage exponents .",
    "we used the term `` cone approximation '' , yet this framework produces the lower bound whenever the allowed space is a generalized cone with the crucial property of invariance under dilation , @xmath63 @xcite .",
    "the computation of the first - passage exponent in a generalized @xmath64-dimensional cone requires computation of the lowest eigenvalue @xmath65 of the angular portion @xmath66 of the laplacian @xmath67 subject to the dirichlet boundary condition , @xmath68 , on the surface of the cone .",
    "the choice of the smallest eigenvalue ensures that @xmath69 inside the allowed region .",
    "the first - passage exponent @xmath70 is related to the lowest eigenvalue via @xmath71 , see @xcite .",
    "we now invoke a theorem that , in its simplest form , states that amongst all domains with the same volume , the lowest eigenvalue of the laplace - dirichlet operator occurs when the domain is a ball .",
    "rayleigh conjectured this result for two dimensions @xcite , and faber and krahn eventually proved it @xcite .",
    "the rayleigh - faber - krahn theorem generalizes to higher dimensions and under mild conditions , to riemannian manifolds @xcite . in the context of first - passage processes",
    ", this theorem implies that of all generalized cones of fixed solid angle , the first - passage exponent is minimal for the circular cone .",
    "since the regions discussed in our study qualify as generalized cones , results of the cone approximation constitute rigorous lower bounds for the exponents .",
    "cones can also provide upper bounds .",
    "to establish an upper bound , we choose a cone that is inscribed by the absorbing boundary .",
    "clearly , the first - passage process is faster inside the inscribed cone and therefore , the corresponding exponent must be an upper bound .",
    "the cone approximation appears to be asymptotically exact for the leadership problem as it predicts the bulk of the exponents with excellent accuracy .",
    "a first step toward proving this exactness is the observation that all opening angles in approach a right angle as the number of particles diverges .",
    "the other major challenge is finding an exact , or at least asymptotically exact , framework for calculating the family of exponents in the origin - crossing problem .",
    "finally , we mention that in the absence of a theoretical method for obtaining statistics of first - passage exactly , monte carlo simulations play vital role .",
    "we utilized a straightforward simulation technique .",
    "it is interesting to find out how accelerated monte carlo simulations fare in producing accurate estimates for the exponents @xcite .",
    "a generalized cone is an infinite convex domain that contains a special point , called an apex , and has the property that each ray emanating from the apex and going through any point inside a cone lies inside the cone ."
