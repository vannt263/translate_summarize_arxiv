    "in a previous paper ( * ? ? ? * hereafter paper i ) , we introduced a new self - consistent - field technique that is capable of constructing three - dimensional ( 3d ) models of incompressible riemann s - type ellipsoids and compressible triaxial configurations that share the same velocity fields as those of riemann s - type ellipsoids .",
    "these compressible triaxial configurations represent fairly good quasi - equilibrium states and can be used to examine the dynamical stability of riemann s - type ellipsoids in the nonlinear regime . with this in mind , a subset of our compressible models have been evolved in a 3d hydrodynamics code @xcite for @xmath3 dynamical times to test their dynamical stability . in this paper , we present results from these hydrodynamic simulations .    before going into the details of our simulations , it is worthwhile spending some time reviewing previous studies of the stability properties of riemann s - type ellipsoids .",
    "chandrasekhar and lebovitz carried out a vigorous analysis of the stability of riemann s - type ellipsoids with respect to second and third order harmonics ( these results are summarized in @xcite ) .",
    "some configurations , including both rigidly - rotating jacobi and stationary dedekind sequences , were found to be subject to a pear - mode ( azimuthal mode number @xmath1 ) instability beyond a certain point while proceeding away from the axisymmetric maclaurin spheroid sequence .",
    "part of the jacobi and dedekind sequences were also found to be unstable to a dumbbell - shaped ( azimuthal mode number @xmath4 ) mode ; this has provided some theoretical foundation for the fission theory of the formation of binary stars @xcite .",
    "these studies have assumed that the evolution of a rotating gas cloud toward the bifurcation points of the @xmath1 pear - mode or @xmath4 dumbbell - mode proceeds in a quasi - stationary manner and on a time scale that is fairly long compared to the dynamical time scale .    however , more recent linear stability studies @xcite have revealed a new elliptical strain instability in riemann s - type ellipsoids that is associated with the noncircular fluid streamlines that describe the internal motion of these configurations . according to these studies ,",
    "a fairly large fraction of all rotating ellipsoids appear to be susceptible to the development of this elliptical instability .",
    "it has a growth rate that is slow compared to the rotation rate but is nevertheless dynamical .",
    "the fastest growth rates are found among the adjoint configurations , in which the internal motion dominates over the collective pattern motion of the rotating bar .",
    "this elliptical instability was first discovered and studied by @xcite and @xcite in the context of two - dimensional ( 2d ) , incompressible fluid flows .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , and @xcite extended it to astrophysics to study tidally distorted accretion disks .",
    "they found that the instability is three - dimensional ( depends on the vertical dimension ) and approximately incompressible , and that it might also give birth to @xmath0 internal waves in the absence of viscosity .",
    "it is subsequent to this work on accretion disks that @xcite conducted their study of riemann s - type ellipsoids , for which elliptical flows are generic .",
    "the discovery of an elliptical strain instability in rotating ellipsoidal ( bar - like ) structures brings into question @xcite whether the paradigm for evolution of a secularly unstable star driven by gravitational - radiation reaction ( grr ) forces is viable . according to this paradigm @xcite",
    ", such a star  in the form of a riemann s - type ellipsoid  would evolve on a secular time scale toward the dedekind sequence ( for which the pattern frequency of the bar - mode @xmath5 ) , at which point the evolution would stop because the gravitational field no longer exhibits a time - varying quadrupole moment .",
    "the analysis of @xcite shows that the parameter space occupied by the elliptical instability encompasses most of the dedekind sequence . because the elliptical instability develops on a dynamical time scale",
    ", it might prevent a grr - driven figure from proceeding further to the dedekind sequence , especially if the elliptical instability develops into the nonlinear regime . because the results presented by @xcite are based on linear analysis ,",
    "they were not sure what the nonlinear outcome of the elliptical instability would be .    in a recent nonlinear study of the development of the secular bar - mode instability by @xcite , an initially uniformly rotating neutron star was driven by grr forces into a differentially rotating bar - like configuration that had a very low pattern frequency .",
    "this bar - like configuration appeared to be a compressible analogue of an adjoint configuration among the riemann s - type ellipsoids .",
    "however , the coherent bar - like structure was destroyed very quickly by the nonlinear development of an unexpected high - order instability that generated `` turbulence '' throughout the internal structure of the bar .",
    "@xcite suggested that this turbulent - like instability was related to the elliptical instability , but no definite conclusion could be drawn because only one model was studied .",
    "it was impractical to pursue a full investigation across the entire parameter space of possible ellipsoidal models because , at the time , the generation of one single equilibrium bar - like model was computationally expensive ; the construction of even one equilibrium ellipsoidal model required following the grr - driven evolution of an initially axisymmetric model , which takes a very long time even with an artificially enhanced grr force @xcite .    with the new self - consistent - field technique introduced in paper i , we have been able to quickly build a large number of nearly incompressible , quasi - equilibrium triaxial models .",
    "these compressible models contain the same internal velocity flow - fields as incompressible riemann ellipsoids .",
    "and although they are not exact steady - state configurations , these models provide reasonably good initial states for a study of the elliptical instability because the elliptical instability develops on a dynamical time scale . in",
    "what follows , we present hydrodynamic simulations of a variety of these nearly incompressible , rotating bar - like models to test their dynamical stability .",
    "we find that a significant fraction are unstable to what appears to be the elliptical instability .",
    "we introduce our initial models and analysis method in  2 ; we present results from hydrodynamic evolutions for different configurations in  3 ; and in  4 , we conclude and discuss issues relevant to the evolutionary path of secularly unstable neutron stars .",
    "we follow the notation defined in paper i , where @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 are the three principal semiaxes of an ellipsoid and @xmath8 is the rotation axis . in a frame of reference",
    "whose origin coincides with the center of the ellipsoid and that is rotating with the pattern frequency of the ellipsoid , @xmath9 , the velocity field of a riemann s - type ellipsoid takes the form , @xmath10 where @xmath11 is a constant that determines the degree of internal motion of the fluid .",
    "this velocity field is designed so that velocity vectors are everywhere tangent to a set of self - similar concentric ellipses .",
    "( in the uniform - density , incompressible riemann configurations , these concentric ellipses also identify equipotential contours . )",
    "when @xmath12 , a model is said to be a `` direct '' model , in which the figure rotation dominates over internal motions .",
    "conversely , when @xmath13 ) .",
    "these models satisfied the steady - state euler s equation exactly , but only satisfied the steady - state continuity equation approximately .",
    "however , as discussed in paper i , it was found that the deviation from the steady - state continuity equation was small for models that obeyed a relatively stiff equation of state ( eos ) . for our present study",
    ", we have used the same self - consistent - field technique described in paper i to construct more than forty quasi - equilibrium , compressible analogues of riemann s - type ellipsoids to serve as initial states for a series of hydrodynamic simulations .",
    "the models were constructed using two different eos ( @xmath14 and @xmath15 polytropes ) , with a variety of initial axis ratios  figure [ triaxial ] displays the range of selected ( @xmath16 , @xmath17 ) pairs  and , for a given set of axes , both `` direct '' and `` adjoint '' configurations were constructed .",
    "this set of models was selected to cover a reasonably large fraction of the parameter space that was investigated by @xcite , keeping in mind that their linear analysis was confined to incompressible figures .",
    "the stability of roughly twenty - five of these initial models was examined using a 3d hydrodynamic code , as explained below .",
    "we focused on analyzing the stability of adjoint models with an @xmath14 polytropic eos , but several direct models with an @xmath14 eos and one adjoint model with an @xmath15 eos were included in the mix .",
    "for the sake of brevity , only the results of six model evolutions are presented in detail in  [ sec : hydroresults ] .",
    "table [ table : models ] lists the key parameters for these six representative models .",
    "in addition to the name that has been assigned to each model and the values of five parameters that already have been defined ( @xmath18 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath9 , @xmath11 ) , table [ table : models ] specifies each initial model s ratio of rotational to gravitational potential energy @xmath19 , total angular momentum @xmath20 , mean density @xmath21 , and the ratio of the pattern period @xmath22 to the dynamical time @xmath23^{-1/2}$ ] .",
    "the measured growth rates @xmath24 and @xmath25 of unstable modes with azimuthal mode numbers @xmath0 and @xmath1 are also tabulated ( see  3 for further elaboration ) .",
    "dimensional quantities are in the hydro code unit for which the gravitational constant @xmath26 , the central density @xmath27 , and the cylindrical radius of the entire grids @xmath28 are all set to unity .",

    "the adopted grid resolution was @xmath30 in the @xmath31 ( cylindrical radius ) , @xmath32 ( vertical ) , and @xmath33 ( azimuthal ) directions , respectively .",
    "we monitor the time - evolution of the general structure of each model by measuring the fourier amplitude of various `` modes '' having azimuthal quantum numbers @xmath34 in the following fashion : at each instance of time , the azimuthal density distribution in a ring of fixed @xmath35 and @xmath32 can be decomposed into a series of azimuthal fourier components via the relation , @xmath36 where the complex amplitudes @xmath37 are defined by the expression , @xmath38 in our simulations , the time - dependent behavior of the magnitude of this coefficient , @xmath39 , is monitored at a variety of @xmath40 locations to measure the growth - rate of various modes .",
    "the time - varying amplitudes shown in our figures , below , are averages of @xmath39 over the entire volume .",
    "although this diagnostic tool permits us to study the behavior of structure having a wide variety of @xmath34 values , in practice we have focused our attention on the lowest order modes for this study .",
    "for example , a trace of the time - evolution of @xmath41 lets us monitor the overall ellipticity of each model .",
    "the @xmath2 mode should dominate initially because of each model s initial bar - like structure .",
    "if this amplitude remains at a fairly constant level in a given simulation , we conclude that the configuration is stable ; otherwise , it is unstable . in practice",
    ", we have found that when the @xmath2 amplitude drops significantly in a model , that model simultaneously displays growth of other azimuthal modes .    in their analysis of the elliptical instability",
    ", @xcite generally found that the unstable mode with the fastest growth rate was the @xmath1 mode . in their study , the @xmath0 mode was not discussed because , in incompressible configurations , an @xmath0 mode normally refers to a translation of the center of mass of the configuration .",
    "however , in the study of an elliptical instability in tidally distorted accretion disks by @xcite and @xcite , it was found that an eccentric @xmath0 mode may be important .",
    "further investigation shows that the instability has some dependence on the third ( vertical ) dimension , because it disappeared in 2d simulations @xcite . with these results in mind ,",
    "we have focused our attention on the development of the @xmath0 and @xmath42 modes in our 3d ellipsoidal model evolutions .",
    "we present our results from hydrodynamic evolutions for direct and adjoint configurations in the next two subsections , respectively .      in this subsection , we present results from two direct configurations , models * d105 * and * d080 * , which were evolved for about 24 @xmath43 and 17 @xmath43 , respectively .",
    "figure [ den : d105 ] shows snapshots in time of equatorial - plane iso - density contours and the inertial - frame velocity field for model * d105*. ( in the online version of this paper , the figure caption includes a link to an mpeg movie showing the entire evolution of this model . )",
    "this model is stable ; the coherent bar - like structure and elliptical flows are well maintained throughout the 24 @xmath43 followed by our simulation .",
    "the time - varying fourier mode amplitudes displayed in figure [ mode : d105 ] show that the @xmath2 bar - mode remains the dominant mode throughout this evolution , with an amplitude that remains approximately three orders of magnitude higher than those of the @xmath0 and @xmath42 modes .",
    "although the @xmath4 mode has a larger amplitude than the odd modes , the fact that its behavior follows that of the @xmath2 mode suggests that it is a harmonic of the @xmath2 mode and that there is no independent @xmath4 mode .",
    "although we have categorized model * d105 * as stable , a slow decay of the bar - mode amplitude is evident in figure 2 . because other modes , including the @xmath44 and @xmath42 modes , do not grow throughout the evolution ,",
    "this slow decay of the bar - mode probably results from the small violation of the steady - state continuity equation in our initial model configuration .",
    "( this , in turn , results from the fact that the 3d iso - density surfaces in our compressible models deviate from self - similar ellipses or homeoidal shells ; see paper i for a more detailed discussion . )",
    "small violations in the surface layers cause very low density material to be shed outward from both ends of the object and form two low density spiral waves ( see the panel labeled @xmath45 in figure 1 ) .",
    "because this material carries relatively high specific angular momentum , the overall system loses angular momentum , but only on a very long time scale .",
    "we suspect that this is the major cause of the gradual decay of the @xmath2 bar - mode in this model evolution .",
    "figure [ mode : d080 ] shows a similar fourier mode analysis for model * d080*. again , the @xmath46 bar - mode dominates the entire evolution and shows a slow decay ; amplitudes of the odd azimuthal modes remain at roughly constant `` noise '' levels .",
    "the results from the evolution of these two direct configurations suggest that , although our initial model configurations do not satisfy the steady - state continuity equation exactly , the models are still fairly good quasi - equilibrium states . in both cases ,",
    "the coherent bar - like structures were well maintained through @xmath47 @xmath43 .",
    "hence , we are confident that initial models generated by the technique described in paper i can be used to study the dynamical stability of compressible riemann s - type ellipsoids . furthermore , the fact that the elliptical instability sets in on a dynamical time scale will allow us to use these models to detect the elliptical instability , if it exists .    according to ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see their figure 2 for a summary of their analysis of direct configurations ) , the elliptical instability only arises in a small portion of the parameter space that is occupied by direct configurations , and its growth rate is relatively slow there .",
    "this makes it relatively difficult for our current study to identify the exact parameter - space boundaries between stable and unstable direct configurations .",
    "furthermore , the method described in paper i can only be used to construct compressible models having axis ratios @xmath48 , whereas most of the domain that we expect to be effected by the elliptical instability in direct configurations has @xmath49 .",
    "this also makes direct configurations unsuitable for identifying the existence of the elliptical instability .",
    "therefore , we have chosen to focus our study on an analysis of adjoint configurations where the domain of the instability is much wider , according to ( * ? ? ? * see especially their figure 3a , which is reproduced here as figure [ llplot ] ) .",
    "more importantly , the growth rate of the instability is expected to be faster in adjoint configurations .",
    "this helps us to conduct such a survey with a limited evolution time that is allowed by our current computational resources . in the next subsection",
    ", we present simulations of adjoint configurations , which indeed reveal the development of turbulence - like flows that we suspect are associated with the elliptical instability .      in this subsection , we present results from 3d hydrodynamic evolutions of the four adjoint configurations listed in table [ table : models ] . in light of previous studies @xcite ,",
    "it is expected that the @xmath0 and @xmath42 modes will be the fastest growing modes , if an elliptical instability sets in .",
    "therefore , rapid growth of these two modes can serve as a compass pointing to the elliptical instability . with this in mind , in the analysis below",
    "we will categorize our results based on the behavior of these two modes .",
    "based on the final outcome and behavior of the @xmath0 and @xmath42 modes , evolutions of our initially quasi - equilibrium compressible adjoint configurations can be divided into three categories : stable models , moderately unstable models , and violently unstable models .",
    "the first category  stable models  consists of evolutions in which the internal elliptical flow remains stable .",
    "one evolution in this family is model * a010 * , with @xmath50 .",
    "note from the information in table [ table : models ] that this model has a somewhat prolate structure with @xmath51 .",
    "figure [ den : a010 ] shows 2d , equatorial - plane iso - density contours of this model at four different times .",
    "( the figure caption in the online version includes a link to an mpeg movie showing the entire evolution of this model . )",
    "the ellipsoidal shape is well preserved , at least up through the end of our simulation @xmath52 , and the internal elliptical flow pattern remains stable . as suggested by the fourier mode analysis shown in figure [ mode : a010 ] , the @xmath2 bar - mode dominates throughout the entire evolution .",
    "there is no indication that the @xmath0 and @xmath42 modes are growing ; their amplitudes remain fairly constant at `` noise '' level throughout the evolution .",
    "figures [ den : a067 ] and [ mode : a067 ] show similar plots for another stable model , namely , model * a067 * with @xmath53 .",
    "this model was perturbed with an initial low - amplitude @xmath1 perturbation , but its bar - like structure remains stable during the evolution .",
    "we note that the bar - mode appears to undergo a low - amplitude oscillation . as we have discussed in paper i ,",
    "initially small deviations from the steady - state continuity equation can generate surface waves in adjoint models .",
    "the oscillations observed here in the amplitude of the @xmath2 bar - mode is indeed a reflection of these low - amplitude surface waves traveling along the elliptical surface .",
    "the initial violation of the steady - state continuity equation is larger in models with a softer eos ( see paper i ) .",
    "it is therefore not surprising that oscillations of the bar - mode amplitude in model * a067 * are somewhat larger than in other models because model * a067 * was constructed using a relatively soft ( @xmath15 polytropic ) eos .",
    "the second category of adjoint evolutions consists of configurations that are moderately unstable . in these models ,",
    "the elliptical flow appears to remain stable as judged by the behavior of the @xmath2 fourier mode .",
    "however , the @xmath0 and @xmath42 modes are observed to grow on a long time scale .",
    "model * a134 * with @xmath50 belongs to this family .",
    "figure [ den : a134 ] shows 2d iso - density contours of this model in the equatorial plane at different evolutionary times .",
    "( an mpeg movie showing part of the evolution of this model is available in the figure caption of the online version . )",
    "we note that this model has an almost vanishingly small bar pattern frequency , @xmath54 , so it is very nearly a dedekind - like object ; as seen in figure [ den : a134 ] , the bar - like pattern shifts retrograde ( clockwise ) through only @xmath55 radians over @xmath56 ! through this initial @xmath57 ,",
    "the coherent ellipsoidal structure and elliptical flow pattern remain stable .",
    "however , as revealed by the fourier mode analysis in figure [ mode : a134 ] , at later times the @xmath58 and @xmath42 modes both exhibit exponential growth , albeit at a very slow growth rate .",
    "we note that the amplitudes of these odd modes appear to be tied to each other ; even their individual growth rates are almost the same .",
    "( as recorded in table [ table : models ] , the e - folding time for these odd modes are @xmath59 , and @xmath60 . )",
    "this suggests that the mechanism that is responsible for driving these modes is probably the same .",
    "their amplitudes do not exceed that of the @xmath2 mode at the end of this simulation .",
    "hence , we have identified this model as being moderately unstable . across the parameter space of our investigation",
    "( see , for example , figure [ triaxial ] ) , models belonging to this category can be regarded as a transition from stable to violently unstable models .",
    "the third category consists of models that are violently unstable to an instability that leads to apparently turbulent flow throughout the configuration .",
    "the @xmath2 bar - mode is quickly destroyed in a few dynamical times ; simultaneously , both the @xmath0 and @xmath42 modes exhibit extremely fast exponential growth .",
    "one of the most unstable models in our investigation is * a100 * with @xmath61 .",
    "the time - evolution of equatorial - plane iso - density contours of this model is shown in figure [ den : a100 ] .",
    "( the entire evolution is shown in a mpeg movie in the figure caption of this plot in the online version of this paper . )",
    "the initial ellipsoidal structure exists for only @xmath62 , then it is suddenly destroyed by some type of `` turbulent '' instability . after the bar - like structure",
    "is destroyed , the whole configuration settles into an entirely turbulent state , exhibiting small - scale vortices and eddies . the fourier mode analysis shown in figure [ mode : a100 ]",
    "looks distinctly different from all previous mode plots : the @xmath2 mode decays very quickly in parallel with rapidly growing @xmath58 and @xmath42 modes , which finally surpass the @xmath46 mode in amplitude .",
    "these distinct features suggest that the initially ellipsoidal structure of model * a100 * was destroyed by a process that is entirely different from the _ gradual _ decay of the bar - mode amplitude seen in our models that have been categorized as stable . as in model * a134 * , the growth time for both the @xmath0 and 3 modes are very close to each other ( as recorded in table [ table : models ] , @xmath63 and @xmath64 ) , but they ultimately saturated at different levels .",
    "we evolved model * a100 * for a long time ( @xmath65 ) until the system reached a new , nearly axisymmetric state .",
    "the turbulent behavior of model * a100 * is very similar to the outcome of an instability that arose during the late evolution of the grr - driven neutron star from a previous study @xcite . in an effort to compare this earlier simulation result with our present one ,",
    "we have plotted in figure [ spectrum : a100 ] a power spectrum of the various azimuthal modes for model * a100 * at time @xmath66 and @xmath67 in the evolution .",
    "this power spectrum looks surprisingly similar to the power spectrum that was generated by @xcite late in their model s evolution .",
    "the spectrum is dominated by even modes in the beginning as a result of the ellipsoidal ( bar - like ) structure ; whereas a turbulence - like power law distribution dominates at late times , after the energy initially stored in the @xmath2 bar - mode has cascaded into all other fourier modes .",
    "this strongly suggests that the violent instability seen in our present study is the same instability that arose in the @xcite investigation . because this turbulence - like instability has arisen in two quite different contexts",
    " @xcite discovered it while studying the non - linear evolution of an initially axisymmetric star that was driven to a bar - like configuration by grr forces , whereas we have discovered it during purely hydrodynamic evolutions of compressible triaxial models that have been purposely constructed to resemble adjoint configurations of riemann s - type ellipsoids  it seems likely that the instability is generic to adjoint configurations .    in an effort to understand whether or not this instability occupies the same regions of parameter space as the elliptical instability studied by @xcite",
    ", our hydrodynamic investigation has included models that cover as much parameter space as possible . in figure",
    "[ triaxial ] , we have mapped the results from 20 of our adjoint model evolutions onto the @xmath68 plane .",
    "( for the sake of brevity , a detailed discussion of only 6 of these model evolutions has been presented , above . )",
    "models found to be violently unstable are marked by asterisks , stable models are marked by diamonds , and moderately unstable models are marked by plus signs .",
    "this figure should be compared with figure 3a from @xcite  reproduced here as figure [ llplot ]  which shows the instability domain occupied by the @xmath1 mode in the adjoint family of incompressible , riemann s - type ellipsoids .",
    "it is very encouraging that our regions of instability are consistent with the @xcite diagram .",
    "more specifically , both investigations find that unstable configurations occupy a large portion of parameter space above the dedekind sequence when @xmath69 .",
    "the growth time also appears to be related to the axis ratio , @xmath16 : models with smaller @xmath16 undergo a more violent instability . despite the fact that the method described in paper i prevents us from constructing compressible models with @xmath70 or @xmath71 , our results already indicate that models that are most susceptible to the instability occupy a smaller fraction of the available parameter space _ below _ the dedekind sequence than above it .",
    "the two models that we have categorized as being moderately unstable ( the plus signs in figure [ triaxial ] ) mark the transition from stable to violently unstable domains . in particular , the fact that model * a134 * with @xmath72 is only moderately unstable suggests that we may be seeing evidence for the `` tongue '' structure displayed in figure [ llplot ] that covers most of the dedekind sequence . as a counter example , however , we note that all of our models with @xmath73 appear to be stable whereas @xcite found that some models with @xmath74 fall in the instability domain covered by a set of small extended tongues .",
    "this apparent discrepancy probably arises because the growth rate of the instability is sufficiently slow in this regime that we are unable to identify the instability , given the limited evolutionary time of our simulations .    because our models are constructed on a rather coarse , discrete parameter grid , we are unable to map out the instability domain with the type of fine structure shown in figure [ llplot ]",
    ". however , the fact that the instability domain identified in our present study and displayed in figure [ triaxial ] by and large agrees with the instability domain identified by @xcite gives us confidence that the turbulence - like behavior observed in our violently unstable models arises from the elliptical instability .",
    "we have conducted a survey of the nonlinear hydrodynamic stability of compressible triaxial configurations that are initially in quasi - equilibrium and share the same velocity field as that of riemann s - type ellipsoids .",
    "our simulations show that many of these models are indeed very good long - lived , quasi - equilibrium states .",
    "in addition , we have found that a turbulence - like dynamical instability arises over a fairly large region of the examined parameter domain ( see figure [ triaxial ] ) .",
    "this instability is probably the same instability observed in the late evolution of a neutron star that was driven to a bar - like structure by grr forces @xcite .",
    "the characteristics exhibited by this instability and the domain it occupies in the examined parameter space agree qualitatively with the elliptical instability that has been discovered in previous linear studies of incompressible configurations @xcite .",
    "therefore , we suspect that this instability is the elliptical instability that appears to develop generically in fluid flows with elliptical stream lines .    as a result of this instability , we found that all odd azimuthal modes grew on a dynamical time scale , but were dominated by the @xmath0 and @xmath42 modes , whose amplitudes eventually surpassed the @xmath2 bar - mode and destroyed the ellipsoidal structure of each violently unstable model .",
    "it appears that the growth rate for unstable modes is higher in models with smaller @xmath16 values .",
    "this makes sense because the elliptical instability ought to disappear in circular flows with @xmath75 . in a linear analysis of the elliptical instability in riemann s - type ellipsoids",
    ", @xcite did not discuss the behavior of the @xmath0 mode .",
    "however , the appearance of an eccentric @xmath0 mode in accretion disks @xcite is consistent with our discovery here that the @xmath0 mode can also develop in compressible flows and drain energy from the @xmath2 mode .",
    "the existence of the elliptical instability raises concerns regarding the final fate of neutron stars that encounter the grr - induced secular bar - mode instability . according to previous theoretical investigations @xcite",
    ", such a star would be expected to evolve through a sequence of riemann s - type ellipsoids toward the dedekind sequence that has a vanishingly small pattern frequency as viewed from the inertial reference frame .",
    "however , @xcite have shown that most of the dedekind sequence falls in the parameter regime where fluid configurations should be susceptible to the elliptical instability ; if any star enters this region of parameter space , the elliptical instability would set in on a dynamical time scale .",
    "it was unclear in the linear study of @xcite whether the elliptical instability would be mild or violent in the nonlinear regime .",
    "this picture was partially answered by the nonlinear evolution of one rotating neutron star that was susceptible to the grr - induced secular bar - mode instability @xcite ; the bar - like configuration was observed to be destroyed very quickly when the pattern frequency of the bar dropped to nearly zero .",
    "the evolutions of compressible triaxial models presented in this paper further clarify what the nonlinear outcome will be of the elliptical instability .",
    "we have found that the instability can be violent and capable of destroying the ellipsoidal structure of the star .",
    "therefore , it seems unlikely that a secularly unstable star driven by grr forces will actually be able to evolve along a sequence of riemann s - type ellipsoids toward a dedekind - like configuration .    at the final stage of the evolution reported by @xcite , after the bar - like structure",
    "was destroyed and the star returned back to a nearly axisymmetric state with strong differential rotation , its @xmath19 value was still above the critical limit of @xmath76 for the secular bar - mode instability .",
    "hence , it is possible that such a star would again attempt to evolve toward the dedekind - sequence under the influence of grr forces .",
    "cycles of instability could continue until the star s rotational energy is drained below the critical limit .",
    "if this picture is correct , it would provide a very interesting , recurrent source of gravitational - wave radiation for ground - based gravitational - wave detectors such as the laser interferometer gravitational - wave observatory ( ligo ) and its sister instruments worldwide .",
    "we would like to thank lee lindblom , john friedman , nikolaos stergioulas , yuk tung liu and juhan frank for valuable discussions .",
    "this work was partially supported by nsf grants ast-0407070 and phy-0326311 .",
    "the computations were performed on the supermike cluster and the superhelix cluster at lsu , and on the tungsten cluster at national center for supercomputing applications ( ncsa ) ."

    "<S> we find that , although some models are stable and some are moderately unstable , the majority are violently unstable toward the development of @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and higher - order azimuthal distortions that destroy the coherent , @xmath2 bar - like structure of the initial ellipsoidal configuration on a dynamical time scale .    </S>",
    "<S> the parameter regime over which our models are found to be unstable generally corresponds with the regime over which incompressible riemann s - type ellipsoids have been found to be susceptible to an elliptical strain instability @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore suspect that an elliptical instability is responsible for the destruction of our compressible analogs of riemann ellipsoids . </S>",
    "<S> the existence of the elliptical instability raises concerns regarding the final fate of neutron stars that encounter the secular bar - mode instability and regarding the spectrum of gravitational waves that will be radiated from such systems . </S>"
