    "cosmological problems are as old as human history , but cosmology is a relatively new science . in recent years two main observational results have revealed a profound implication in our current knowledge of the universe .",
    "these are the confirmation of the flat geometry and its accelerating expansion of our universe in the relatively recent epoch , i.e. , with redshift of roughly 0.5 or less , driving by an unidentified component as coined dark energy by m. turner @xcite .",
    "the recent observations have dramatically changed our previous intuition .",
    "the evolution of the universe was slowing down due to gravitational attractive force and also alleviated the universe age crisis problem with respect to the oldest stars and globular clusters in our milk way galaxy .",
    "respectively , the first acoustic peak of the temperature fluctuations on the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmbr ) is observed by the experiments of boomerang , maxima and wmap @xcite .",
    "it favors a spatially flat universe and indicates our universe dominated by about 2/3 dark energy and 1/3 matter ( with mostly the named non - relativistic cold dark matter ) components .",
    "the direct evidences from measurements of luminosity - redshift relations of sn ia @xcite suggest that there exists a mysterious component so called dark energy with a negative pressure .",
    "it is as large as an anti - gravity contribution to accelerate the universe expansion .",
    "a simple candidate which shows the properties of the dark energy is found in the vacuum energy or cosmological constant .",
    "however , the energy scale to the cosmological constant is about 120 orders of magnitude smaller than that of the vacuum energy at the planck time . some fine tuning of parameters is necessary in almost all the models of particle physics .",
    "thus a naturalness problem exists in some simple candidates .",
    "furthermore , recent analysis of the observational data from wmap combined with 2df , sdss , dasi and the previous cmb observations@xcite disfavors the simplest cosmological constant explanation .",
    "when describing the evolution of the universe , normally we start with solving the einstein equation . since we know that recent observations favors the flat , homogeneous and isotropic universe in large scale survey , it is a good approximation to use the energy - momentum tensor for the dominant matter or radiation mainly depends on time or temperature when we consider the global evolution of the universe . for the perfect fluid model ,",
    "the energy - momentum tensor consists of the total energy density @xmath0 and smoothly distributed pressure @xmath1 by @xmath2 .",
    "the isotropic and homogeneous universe can be explicated by friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) metrics . in this case einstein equation",
    "reduces to only two relations .",
    "one is friedmann equation : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the scale factor in the frw metrics .",
    "the other is the acceleration equation @xmath5 these equations are very successful to describe the evolution history of the universe from the `` first three minutes '' so far as we have observed .",
    "furthermore , these can accommodate the relatively recent accelerating expansion of our universe if we accept the existence of a kind of vacuum energy or the cosmological constant - like term . on the other hand we have another solution to introduce an entity endowed with the sort of dark energy @xcite .",
    "its energy density can govern the cosmological evolution in friedmann equations of standard cosmology @xcite . with the present observational data we can not finally distinguish yet whether the accelerating expansion comes from the cosmological constant or not .",
    "the cosmological constant can be absorbed into the energy density @xmath0 and pressure @xmath1 by a re - definition in the above equations . to reconcile with the accelerating expansion of the universe we must have @xmath6 the lower bound , @xmath7 , corresponds to the cosmological constant .",
    "when we consider the dark energy model that causes the accelerating expansion , the dominant substance has to satisfy this relation by its own @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "lots of previous works are reported in concentrating on a dynamical scalar field such as quintessence , spin - essence and so on . in such investigations",
    "a slowly varying energy density has been employed to mimic an effective cosmological constant @xcite . as far as we know a very little number of works have been done in the study of the fermion field as the possible dark energy candidate .",
    "one of the interesting candidate of the dark energy is postulated in the model with a fermion field . in some strong coupling fermion models dynamical",
    "symmetry breaking takes place by the fermion and the anti - fermion condensation below a critical temperature .",
    "as is well known , the chiral symmetry for quarks is broken down dynamically in qcd . the composite operator of the fermion and the anti - fermion develops the non - vanishing vacuum expectation value .",
    "it can change behaviors of the energy density and pressure of the universe at low temperature as the relevant energy scale in the model can be adjusted accordingly .",
    "therefore we launched our plan to make a systematic study of the strong coupling fermion models at finite temperature for a dark energy candidate .    here",
    "we take a four - fermion interaction model as one of such prototype models and discuss the possibilities to describe the dark energy characters by using the thermal quantum field theory technique @xcite .",
    "the spacetime curvature also has an important effect on the phase structure of dynamical symmetry breaking in the early stage of the universe @xcite .",
    "however , we consider the era when the main contribution to the evaluation of the energy - momentum tensor comes from the thermal effect .",
    "we assume that the spacetime curvature and the expansion of the universe do not have a large influence to the evaluation of the energy - momentum tensor . as is known , the four - fermion interaction is non - renormalizable .",
    "we regard the model is an effective theory which is stemming from a more fundamental theory at a high energy scale .    in the present paper",
    "we study a four - fermion interaction model as a dark energy candidate . by using the imaginary time formalism",
    "we calculate the energy - momentum tensor in our model at finite temperature .",
    "the eos is obtained from the energy - momentum tensor .",
    "behaviors of the deceleration parameter are discussed to see the dark energy property of the four - fermion interaction model . throughout this paper",
    "we use natural units with @xmath8 and assume the universe is geometric flat as astrophysical observation favors .",
    "first we briefly review the definition of the energy - momentum tensor in the quantum field theory of fermion .",
    "the four - fermion interaction model is one of the simplest model where dynamical symmetry breaking takes place @xcite . in @xmath9-dimensional spacetime",

    "we obtain @xmath36 in the leading order of @xmath37-expansion where @xmath38 denote the differentiation with respect to @xmath39 and @xmath40 is the feynman propagator for the free fermion with mass @xmath20 which satisfies @xmath41 the second term in the right hand side of eq.([tmunu ] ) corresponds to the expectation value of the energy - momentum tensor of the free fermion with mass @xmath20 .",
    "therefore the energy - momentum tensor of the four - fermion interaction model is given by the sum of the quadratic potential term of @xmath20 , i.e. , the first term in the right hand side of eq.([tmunu ] ) , and the energy - momentum tensor of the massive free fermion in the leading order of @xmath37-expansion .",
    "it should be noted that the fermion mass @xmath20 is a dynamical variable .",
    "we can determine the dynamically generated fermion mass by evaluating the effective potential .",
    "next we study the thermal effect to the energy - momentum tensor . as is shown in eq.([tmunu ] ) , the vacuum expectation value for the energy - momentum tensor is described by the free fermion propagator .",

    "since the four fermion interaction is not renormalizable , we consider the spacetime dimension less than @xmath52 to regularize the theory .",

    "we know the dark energy is almost smoothly distributed @xcite , which implies a kind of very weak interaction that we are not very clear about yet .",
    "here we just employ the simple four - fermion interaction model to give the global energy momentum tensor which depends on temperature and some model parameters",
    ". it might be too simple , however we found interesting results .",
    "as a next step , it is very important to apply our analysis to other well - defined and more realistic models .",

    "the scalar mass depends on the coupling parameter .",

    "we can choose the coupling parameter @xmath107 to realize the appropriate scale for the cosmological constant and the negative pressure of the present universe accordingly .",
