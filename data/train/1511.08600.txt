    "this yields @xmath772 from the jacobi matrix of the kelvin transform @xmath773 computed in the proof of lemma  [ lem : transform1 ] we obtain the determinant @xmath774 therefore , @xmath775 the reformulation together with the coordinate transformation @xmath776 with @xmath777 yields @xmath778 by the sobolev embedding @xmath779 for @xmath780 $ ] , together with the conclusion that @xmath746 , @xmath747 ( for sufficiently small @xmath748 ) from theorem  [ thm : manifold ] , we can further deduce that @xmath781 for @xmath641 .",
