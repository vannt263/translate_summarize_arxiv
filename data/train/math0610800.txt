    "the problem of _ consensus division _ arises when two or more competitive or cooperative parties , each guided by their individual objective functions , divide an object according to some notion of fairness .",
    "there are many different mathematical reformulations of this problem depending on what kind of divisions are allowed , what kind of object is divided , whether the parties involved are cooperative or not , etc .",
    "early examples of problems and results of this type are the `` ham sandwich theorem '' of steinhaus and banach , the envy - free `` cake - division problem '' of steinhaus , the equipartition of measurable sets by hyperplanes of grnbaum and hadwiger , and more recently the `` splitting necklace theorem '' of alon , .",
    "a model example of a fair - division theorem when two parties are involved is the hobby - rice theorem .",
    "[ thm : hobby - rice ] ( @xcite ) let @xmath13 be a collection of continuous probability measures on @xmath4 $ ] .",

    "a celebrated generalization of theorem  [ thm : hobby - rice ] is the following `` splitting necklace theorem '' of alon , which extends the result of goldberg and west to the case of @xmath18 `` thieves '' .",
    "we formulate the continuous version which includes theorem  [ thm : hobby - rice ] as a special case and which can be used to deduce the corresponding discrete version .",

    "this may sound as a surprise in light of theorem  5.2 from @xcite claiming that , given @xmath28 , for every @xmath29 there exist @xmath30-colorings of @xmath4^d$ ] which do not admit `` bisections '' of size at most @xmath31 .",
    "this ambiguity is immediately resolved by the observation that the `` bisections '' allowed in @xcite were of quite special nature ( @xmath9-dimensional checkerboards ) while in our approach there are no restrictions on the coloring ( labelling ) of elementary parallelepipeds .",
    "an important step leading to the generalization of the `` splitting necklace theorem '' was the recognition of the role of `` rainbow complexes '' @xmath32 where @xmath33 is an arbitrary @xmath9-dimensional , convex polytope and @xmath34 a finite set of `` colors '' used for labelling the vertices of @xmath33 .",
    "these complexes turn out to be ( topologically ) shellable ( theorem  [ thm : topo - shell ] ) and to have other interesting properties reflecting the geometry and combinatorics of the base polytope @xmath33 , section  [ sec : concluding ] .",

    "this case exhibits all the main features of the general @xmath9-dimensional problem and provides a motivation for the introduction of configuration spaces @xmath35 and their generalizations .",
    "a `` splitting '' of a square @xmath40\\times [ 0,1]$ ] is a partition of @xmath41 into smaller rectangles by lines parallel to the sides of the square . assuming that the square is positioned in the coordinate system so that the diagonally opposite vertices are @xmath42 and @xmath43 , a @xmath44-partition is determined by a choice of @xmath45 points @xmath46 on the @xmath47-axes and @xmath7 points @xmath48 on the @xmath49-axes .",
    "the associated splitting ( partition ) is the division of @xmath41 into ( possibly degenerate ) rectangles @xmath50\\times [ y_j , y_{j+1}]$ ] , where @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "recall an elementary fact that the space of all @xmath45-partitions @xmath53 of the unit interval @xmath54 is naturally identified as the simplex @xmath55 where @xmath56 are the associated barycentric coordinates .",
    "similarly , the barycentric coordinates associated to a @xmath49-partition are @xmath57 .",
    "it follows that the space of all @xmath44-partitions of the square @xmath41 is naturally parameterized by points of the product @xmath58 .",
    "the basic cell @xmath59 should play in the case of @xmath30-dimensional partitions the role analogous to the role the cell @xmath60 plays in the case of @xmath61-dimensional partitions .",
    "the next step is to introduce two `` thieves '' or players who want to divide among themselves elementary rectangles @xmath62\\times [ y_j , y_{j+1}]$ ] arising from the subdivision . by construction ,",
    "the degenerate elementary rectangles , i.e.  the rectangles such that either @xmath63 or @xmath64 are allowed .",
    "however , it is instructive to keep in mind that the `` thieves '' are primarily interested in non - degenerated rectangles .    in the @xmath61-dimensional case ,",
    "a division of intervals between two thieves was described by a function @xmath65 where @xmath66 and @xmath67 ( alternatively @xmath68 ) means that the interval @xmath50 $ ] was allocated to the first ( respectively second ) player .    similarly , in @xmath30-dimensions",
    "a function @xmath69 completely describes an allocation of elementary rectangles to the two players .    as in the @xmath61-dimensional case , a natural _ configuration space _ @xmath35 for the @xmath30-dimensional problem should take into account all @xmath44-partitions of @xmath41 together with all possible allocation functions @xmath70 . in other words",

    "note that the elementary parallelepipeds from figure  [ fig : chessboard ] are in one - to - one correspondence with the vertices of @xmath89 so one can read off the labelling function @xmath85 both from the coloring of the elementary parallelepipeds and the coloring of the vertices of the cell @xmath89 .",
