    "babar collaboration discovered in 2003 a positive - parity scalar charm strange meson @xmath5 with a very narrow width @xcite , which was confirmed by cleo later @xcite . in the same experiment cleo",
    "@xcite observed the @xmath6 partner state at @xmath7 mev .",
    "since these two states lie below @xmath8 and @xmath9 threshold respectively , the potentially dominant s - wave decay modes @xmath10 etc are kinematically forbidden .",
    "thus the radiative decays and isospin - violating strong decays become dominant decay modes .",
    "therefore they are very narrow .",
    "the discovery of these two states has inspired great interest in their nature in literature .",
    "the key point is to understand their low masses .",
    "the @xmath5 mass is significantly lower than the expected values in the range of @xmath11 gev in quark models @xcite .",
    "the model using the heavy quark mass expansion of the relativistic bethe - salpeter equation predicted a lower value @xmath12 gev @xcite , which is still 50 mev higher than the experimental data .",
    "later belle @xcite observed the wide @xmath0 resonance with mass @xmath13gev and width around @xmath14 mev .",
    "another puzzle arises from this result : why are these two resonances nearly degenerate in mass while @xmath15 is 100 mev higher than @xmath16 ?    the earlier results for the mass of @xmath4 from qcd sum rules are either significantly larger than the experimentally observed mass of @xmath5 @xcite or consistent with it within theoretical uncertainty but with significantly larger central value @xcite .",
    "the results from lattice qcd calculations are similar , see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "recently , there have been two investigations on this problem using sum rules in full qcd including the @xmath17 corrections . in ref .",
    "@xcite the value of the charm quark pole mass @xmath18 is used and @xmath19 is found to be @xmath20 higher than the experimental data . on the other hand , in ref .",
    "@xcite @xmath21 is used and the central value of the results for the @xmath22 @xmath23 mass is in good agreement with the data . as commented by the author , the uncertainty in the value of @xmath24 is large .",
    "the difficulty with the @xmath25 interpretation leads many authors to speculate that @xmath5 is a @xmath26 four quark state @xcite or a strong @xmath27 atom @xcite .",
    "however , quark model calculations show that the mass of the four quark state is much larger than the @xmath22 @xmath23 state @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the four quark system has two @xmath22 states . only one has been found below 2.8 gev in the experimental search , consistent with the @xmath25 interpretation .",
    "it was suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite that the low mass of @xmath5 could arise from the mixing between the @xmath22 @xmath23 state and the @xmath8 continuum .",
    "it was pointed out in @xcite that in the formalism of qcd sum rules the physics of mixing with @xmath8 continuum resides in the contribution of @xmath8 continuum in the sum rule and including this contribution should render the mass of @xmath4 lower .",
    "usually the contribution of the two - particle continuum is neglected in the qcd sum rules . in a recent work",
    "@xcite we argued that because of the large s wave coupling of @xmath28 @xcite and the adjacency of the @xmath4 mass to the threshold this contribution may not be neglected .",
    "we calculated this contribution under the assumption that the form factor for the coupling of the scalar current to the two - particle continuum in the low energy region is dominated by the bubble diagrams formed by the coupling of the @xmath22 to the two particles .",
    "we found that including this term in the sum rule indeed renders the mass and decay constant of @xmath4 significantly lower . using the pole mass value",
    "@xmath29 gev the mass of @xmath4 is found to be in good agreement with experimental data .    in the present work we would like to show that the same assumption for the form factor for the coupling of the scalar current to the two - particle continuum also leads to the mass value of @xmath0 in agreement to the experimental data",
    ", thus , explains the nearly degeneracy of these two states .    in section [ sec2 ]",
    "we derive the @xmath1 continuum contribution and write down the full qcd sum rule for @xmath0 .",
    "the numerical results of the mass of @xmath0 are collected in section [ sec3 ] .",
    "we consider the scalar correlation function @xmath30\\langle 0| \\textbf{t } \\{j(x ) , j^\\dag ( 0 ) \\}|0\\rangle\\ ] ] where @xmath31 is the interpolating current for the charged scalar charm meson .",
    "@xmath32 satisfies the following dispersion relation @xmath33 the leading terms of the imaginary part @xmath34 at the quark gluon level and its @xmath35 correction have been calculated in @xcite . after making the borel transformation to suppress the contribution of higher excited states and",

    ", @xmath0 is a very broad _ resonance _ in the @xmath1 spectra and there is no pole term in the hadron spectra . in the traditional treatment of qcd sum rules the very broad resonance is still approximated by a pole term solely for simplicity and without justification .",
    "moreover , the remaining two - particle continuum is completely neglected .    according to this procedure the spectral density at the hadronic level",

    "1 . this may not be a good approximation .",
    "the importance of @xmath1 continuum in the @xmath0 channel was first emphasized by blok , shifman and uraltsev in ref .",
    "@xcite from the consideration of duality .    in our previous work",
    "@xcite it was pointed out that the strong s wave coupling of the @xmath4 with the two particle dk state and the adjacency of the @xmath4 mass to the dk continuum threshold result in large coupling channel effect which corresponds to the configuration mixing in the formalism of the quark model .",
    "therefore , the two - particle continuum can not be neglected . in the present case of",
    "@xmath0 the two - particle term is the whole hadron spectra needed in the sum rule .",
    "we calculate this term with the same assumption used in @xcite .",
    "besides giving a more accurate sum rule for the mass of @xmath0 , this also constitutes a check for the approximation used in @xcite for @xmath4 .",
    "the contribution of the @xmath1 continuum to the hadronic spectral density reads @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the form - factor defined by @xmath53 similar to the approximation used in @xcite , from the large s wave coupling of @xmath54 we assume that in low energy region @xmath52 is dominated by the product of a factor proportional to the propagator of the @xmath0 and a factor from the final state interaction represented by the chain of the bubble diagrams generated from the @xmath54 interaction as shown in fig .",
    "2 .    let @xmath55 be the coupling constant in the effective @xmath54 interaction lagrangian .",
    "the born s wave amplitude in the figure contains both a @xmath56 channel pole term @xmath57 and a crossing @xmath58 channel pole term @xmath59 using the relation between @xmath60 and the scattering angle @xmath61 one finds that the latter is an analytic function of @xmath56 with only a short cut .",
    "therefore , this term can be approximated by a pole form @xmath62 , where @xmath63 @xmath64 different from the case of @xmath4 , the crossing term is actually small for experimental values of the masses in the present case of @xmath0 .",
    "but we shall still keep it in the formulae . in the chiral lagrangian the interaction between @xmath65 and @xmath66 through exchanging two pions is suppressed by @xmath67 for low energy @xmath68 of @xmath66 .",

    "notice that , since we can not do wave function renormalization for @xmath0 at the resonance energy @xmath74 , the coupling constant @xmath55 defined in this work is not exactly the correspondence of that defined in ref .",
    "@xcite for @xmath4 .",
    "the good convergence of the ope series and dominance of the @xmath1 term over the qcd continuum beyond @xmath50 constrain the borel mass in a region depending on @xmath24 and @xmath50 .",

    "since the hadron side of the sum rule depends on the unknown value @xmath74 in a complicated way , we have to input a `` trial '' value of @xmath74 and require that the ratio of the hadron side ( the left hand side or lhs ) to the quark - gluon side ( the right hand side or rhs ) of the sum rule is equal to 1 in the middle of the working range of @xmath103 .",

    "the curve is very sensitive to the trial value of @xmath74 , hence the uncertainty of our results from different values of @xmath43 for fixed values of other parameters are small .",
    "therefore , with the same approximation for the two - particle continuum and same values of @xmath24 and @xmath50 we obtain simultaneously the correct values of the masses of the narrow resonance @xmath4 below the threshold and the broad resonance @xmath0 above the threshold .    under our approximation for the two - particle continuum and acceptable value of @xmath55 , there is no solution for the sum rule for @xmath0 containing a below - threshold pole term and the two - particle continuum in the hadron side as that used in the @xmath4 case ."
