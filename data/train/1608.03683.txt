    "atomic hydrogen ( h  i ) emission , as traced by the @xmath3 cm line , is ubiquitous throughout the milky way disk . as such it is an excellent tracer of gas kinematics and dynamics in the disk .",
    "there is a long and fruitful history of using measurements of the h  i  line to measure the rotation curve of the milky way and to infer the galaxy s structure ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "the departures from circular rotation , observed as the various bumps and wiggles in the rotation curve , have been used to infer the mass structure of the galaxy using spiral density - wave theories @xcite or more recently through comparison with simulations @xcite and mass discrepancy acceleration modelling @xcite .",
    "fundamentally , accurate knowledge of the rotation curve is required for any attempt to model the surface density profile of a galaxy and the milky way is no exception .",
    "in addition , the milky way rotation curve is used extensively for kinematic distance estimates based on the observed radial velocity of an object or associated gas .",
    "much of the work on the rotation curve interior to the solar circle ( @xmath4 ) is based on measurements of the h  i  or co terminal - velocity . inside the solar circle",
    "each line of sight has a location where it is tangent to a circular orbit about the galactic center . at this location , known as the tangent point , the projection of galactic rotational velocity , @xmath5 onto the local standard of rest ( lsr ) is",
    "greatest , and the measured lsr velocity is called the terminal velocity . at the tangent",
    "point all radial or vertical velocities are projected perpendicular to the lsr and the distance from the galactic center is geometrically defined at @xmath6 as @xmath7 . assuming that azimuthal streaming motions are not too large ( see however , chemin et al.2015 ) , the maximum velocity of h  i  emission can be equated to the terminal velocity , @xmath8 , and assigned to a galactocentric radius , @xmath9 .",
    "this is the second paper in a series about the kinematics of the inner milky way . in the first paper , @xcite , hereafter paper i",
    ", we developed a new technique for measuring the h  i  terminal velocity curve . in that paper",
    "we discussed the technique extensively and produced a table of h  i  terminal velocities sampled every four arcminutes for the fourth galactic quadrant using h  i  data from the southern galactic plane survey ( sgps ; * ? ? ? * ) . in this companion paper",
    "we employ the same technique to measure the h  i  terminal velocities for the first galactic quadrant from the vla galactic plane survey ( vgps ; * ? ? ?",
    "together these terminal velocity curves give a uniform , densely sampled measurement of the h  i  rotation curve of the milky way between @xmath10 .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in  [ sec : measure ] we review the key aspects of the technique described in paper i and apply this technique to the vgps data . in  [ sec : termvel ] we present the first quadrant terminal velocity curve , comparing with the co terminal velocities from @xcite and with the fourth quadrant curve . in  [ sec : rotcurve ] we show both the first and fourth quadrant rotation curves together with a variety of standard rotation curve fits and discuss the curves as an ensemble .",
    "the h  i  data used here are from the vla galactic plane survey ( vgps ; * ? ? ?",
    "the vgps is a survey of 21 cm continuum and h  i  emission and absorption obtained with the very large array in its d - array configuration and combined with single dish data from the nrao green bank telescope .",
    "the survey covers galactic longitudes @xmath11 to @xmath12 with a varying latitude range from @xmath13 to @xmath14 .",
    "the h  i  spectral line data have an angular resolution of @xmath15 with rms noise of 2 k of brightness temperature , @xmath16 , in each @xmath17 velocity channel . here",
    "we use the h  i  data , as well as the continuum data , in the latitude range @xmath18 .",
    "we compare the first quadrant terminal velocity data with terminal velocity data of the fourth quadrant from the southern galactic plane survey , as presented in paper i. the noise and resolution characteristics of the sgps and vgps are comparable , leading to a very uniform dataset across the first and fourth quadrants .",
    "for all lines of sight near the galactic plane the circular rotation of the milky way projects onto the local standard of rest ( lsr ) as : @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the angular velocity of galactic rotation at the point of interest , and @xmath21 is the corresponding angular velocity of galactic rotation at the solar circle ( @xmath22 ) . in general",
    "we discuss the circular rotation speed , @xmath23 .",
    "the iau recommended values for the distance to the galactic center , @xmath24 , and the circular rotation speed at the sun , @xmath25 , are @xmath26 kpc and @xmath27 , respectively . although there is strong evidence that these should be varied , i.e.  @xcite , we use the iau values here for consistency with previous work , except where noted . by measuring the terminal velocity , @xmath28 , at the tangent point , @xmath29 we can derive the galactic rotation curve , @xmath30 , interior to the solar circle . in practice , extracting the terminal velocities close to the solar circle is almost impossible because the circular velocity projected onto the lsr has nearly zero radial component .",
    "we therefore restrict our measurements to about @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) .    as described in an extensive body of past work on the milky way h  irotation curve ( e.g * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and summarized in paper i , if the milky way were filled with cold gas in perfectly circular orbits the h  i  spectrum would drop abruptly to zero at the terminal velocity . in reality , thermal velocity motions , random gas motions and bulk motions all contribute to extend the h  ispectrum beyond the terminal velocity .",
    "the magnitude of thermal gas motions and turbulent widths are determined from the spectral width beyond the terminal velocity .",
    "in paper i we built on the analysis by @xcite and @xcite to cast the drop - off of the h  i  profile beyond the terminal velocity in terms of an error function .",
    "we will not reproduce the full derivation , but the conceptional point is that for optically thin gas beyond the terminal velocity , the brightness temperature , @xmath16 , as a function of velocity , @xmath33 , in each velocity interval @xmath34 is : @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the local gas number density in units of @xmath37 ; @xmath38 is the familiar constant converting velocity integrated brightness temperature to column density , @xmath39 ; @xmath40 is the velocity distribution of hi atoms ; and @xmath41 is the magnitude of the velocity gradient at the position , @xmath42 , along the line of sight , where the radial velocity is @xmath43 .",
    "@xcite showed that for a smooth rotation curve @xmath44 is small and directly proportional to @xmath42 , taking values of @xmath45 for galactic longitudes @xmath46 .",
    "we can therefore move the gradient term outside of the integral and if the velocity distribution function of h  i  atoms , @xmath47 , is gaussian , then the drop - off in the h  i  profile beyond the terminal velocity as shown in equation ( [ eq : tb ] ) is an error function .",
    "in fact , we showed in paper i that the data were best fit by a sum of two or three error functions of widths , @xmath48 : @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the number of error functions . here the term @xmath51 is the velocity offset between the terminal velocity and a brightness temperature threshold , which we use to define a starting place for fitting the h  i  spectrum at the terminal velocity .    to find the terminal velocity",
    "some authors have defined a brightness temperature threshold ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) or a relative brightness temperature threshold such as half of the intensity of the most extreme peak ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , whereas @xcite and @xcite fit a functional form , similar to the error function described above .",
    "any threshold method is subject to errors because both the local density , @xmath36 , and the path length , @xmath52 , contribute to the h  i  brightness temperature ( as shown in eq .",
    "[ eq : tb ] ) .",
    "in paper i we found best results with a functional fitting method that was initiated from a threshold .",
    "we showed that the threshold was useful to determine a starting point for the functional fitting , but that by fitting the spectrum with a sum of two error functions we were able to largely remove ambiguities caused by the choice of threshold ( see  3.3 of paper i ) .",
    "an advantage of using a survey like the vgps or sgps for measuring terminal velocities is that the effects of h  i  absorption of continuum emission can be removed from the data .",
    "absorption can alter inferred terminal velocity by reducing the brightness temperature of velocities near the terminal velocity .",
    "the net effect is a reduction in the terminal velocity at positions where there is significant absorption .",
    "a clear example was shown in figure 1 of paper i. in our technique we use the vgps continuum images to define a mask of pixels to exclude from our analysis .",
    "masking at a level of 40 k in the continuum images we reduce the total number of pixels by @xmath53% but also decrease the scatter in the terminal velocity measurements by @xmath54% .",
    "our steps to finding the terminal velocity from the vgps were therefore :    1 .",
    "mask h  i  spectra towards pixels containing continuum emission in excess of 40 k , as measured in vgps continuum images . 2 .",
    "find the velocity of the 20 k @xmath16 threshold on latitude averages over the range @xmath18 .",
    "we chose a threshold value of 20 k , as opposed to 10 k as used in paper i , because the noise in the vgps h  i  data is slightly higher , such that the threshold is at @xmath55 .",
    "3 .   shift all profiles to place the threshold crossing velocity , @xmath56 , at a common velocity of @xmath57 @xmath58   to simplify binning with longitude and the functional fitting .",
    "average the shifted spectra in longitude by 3  to improve the signal - to - noise of a given longitude .",
    "5 .   fit each averaged spectrum with a sum of two error functions as defined by equation [ eq : errfunc ] to determine the true terminal velocity as @xmath59 .",
    "the first quadrant terminal velocity curve for 960 longitude bins of width 3  between @xmath11 and @xmath12 is shown in figure  [ fig : vt_vs_l ] .",
    "we also show the offset velocity , @xmath51 , which indicates regions where the terminal velocities are likely effected by significant local non - circular velocities .",
    "the spike in velocity offset at @xmath60 corresponds to small , anomalous velocity clouds found by @xcite . in total",
    "we found spurious fits for much less than @xmath61% of the fitted spectra .",
    "for the analysis that follows we run a median filter of spectral width 3 samples across the @xmath51 values before correcting the data from @xmath56 to @xmath8 .",
    "the final terminal velocity values are provided in tabulated form in table  [ tab : termvels ] .",
    "the pre - existing most densely sampled terminal velocity curve of the first quadrant comes from @xmath62co j=1 - 0 data published by @xcite .",
    "this curve , and its associated polynomial fit , has been used for many analyses and kinematic distances over the past decades .",
    "as a tracer of the terminal velocity co has different strengths and weaknesses from h  i. while h  i  is a more ubiquitous tracer , it has large ( @xmath63 @xmath58 ) velocity linewidths , whereas co typically has linewidths of less than @xmath64 @xmath58  @xcite .",
    "it has therefore been argued that co may be a better tracer of the terminal velocity than h  i. however , in paper i we compared h  i  and co for the fourth quadrant and showed that they were remarkably consistent but with larger scatter in the co measurements , which we posited was because the low filling factor of co led the co terminal velocity curve to reflect the individual velocity dispersion of clouds , rather than an ensemble average as traced by h  i. the analysis there indicated that neither tracer was significantly better than the other .",
    "figure  [ fig : vt_hi+co ] shows the @xcite curve plotted with the h  i  curve determined for the first quadrant . at all longitudes @xmath65 there is a systematic offset between the two curves , with the @xcite co data approximately 7 @xmath58  higher than the h  i. in deriving the co terminal velocity curve , @xcite effectively used a threshold detection method ( three consecutive channels with emission greater than @xmath66 ) for the most extreme velocity line component , corrected by a uniform offset towards permitted velocities ( smaller @xmath67 ) equivalent to the half - width of an average co cloud or @xmath68 @xmath58 . in general",
    ", threshold - crossing methods will result in higher terminal velocities than our spectral fitting method , which locates the inflection point of the spectral drop - off .",
    "the difference between @xcite and our h  iresults suggests that the average co cloud 3 @xmath58  correction is insufficient to recover the velocity at the tangent point . in spite of the differences in the magnitude of the velocity at a given longitude , the shape of the two curves are reassuringly similar .",
    "most of the features on scales as small as a few degrees and up to scales of tens of degrees are apparent in both curves .",
    "this lends confidence to the veracity of the small - scale features as true dynamical effects rather than measurement artefacts .    for a galaxy in purely circular rotation the run of terminal velocities",
    "will be completely linear with @xmath69 : @xmath70 .",
    "of course , non - circular motions induced by spiral arms , the galactic bar and other discrete dynamic effects produce deviations from linearity , but a linear fit with @xmath69 provides a useful mechanism for comparing data . independently fitting the co and h  i  terminal velocity curves and then comparing the residuals we find that the scatter in the two curves is nearly identical at @xmath71 @xmath58 .",
    "we compare h  i  terminal velocity curves for the first and fourth quadrants , each plotted versus @xmath72 , in figure  [ fig : vt_both ] .",
    "the absolute values of the velocities are plotted for direct comparison .",
    "the two curves are strikingly similar , despite probing different regions of galactic structure .",
    "most notably , both curves have an abrupt flattening of the slope at @xmath73 ( @xmath74 ) with almost no gradient in velocity until @xmath73 ( @xmath75 ) . in addition , both curves show an inflection at @xmath76 ( @xmath77 ) .",
    "these features will be discussed further in the context of the rotation curve below .",
    "the dashed lines in figure  [ fig : vt_both ] show independent linear fits to the run of terminal velocities with @xmath72 in qi and qiv of the form described above ( @xmath78 ) , where the fitted coefficients are @xmath79 @xmath58 , @xmath80 @xmath58  and @xmath81 @xmath58 , @xmath82 @xmath58  for qi and qiv , respectively .",
    "it is important to note that because the rotation curve is not necessarily flat over this range of @xmath69 , the coefficient @xmath83 does not equate to @xmath25 .",
    "however , just as with the comparison of the h  i  and co curves , the fit is a useful indicator of the consistency of the two quadrants .",
    "we find that the fits to qi and qiv are consistent to within 2% indicating the uniformity of the complete terminal velocity curve presented here .",
    "there are , however , some large - scale offsets between the two curves .",
    "the asymmetry between the the terminal velocity curves in the first and fourth quadrants has been discussed extensively ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in figure",
    "[ fig : vdiff_l ] we plot a smoothed version of the difference between our qi and qiv terminal velocities as a function of galactic longitude .",
    "the difference ranges smoothly from @xmath84 @xmath58  at @xmath85 to @xmath86 @xmath58  at @xmath87 and back down to @xmath88 @xmath58  at @xmath89 .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , the difference between the terminal velocity curves depends only on the difference in azimuthal velocity of the gas at the tangent points in the two quadrants and any potential outward motion of the lsr .",
    "an outward motion of the sun or the lsr , as posited by @xcite and @xcite , will give rise to a velocity difference between qi and qiv at all longitudes of the form @xmath90 , where @xmath91 is the radial velocity of the lsr . @xcite found @xmath92 @xmath58 , which was consistent with stellar data at the time .",
    "@xcite revisited the asymmetry , recommending a value of @xmath93 @xmath58for the magnitude of the radial motion of the lsr . in figure",
    "[ fig : vdiff_l ] we over - plot the functional form , @xmath90 for radial velocities of @xmath94 @xmath58 , @xmath86 @xmath58  and @xmath95 @xmath58 .",
    "it is clear that over the range of longitudes measured here an outward motion of the lsr alone can not account for velocity difference . to fit the terminal velocity difference curve @xcite included a non - axisymmetric velocity field induced by a triaxial spheroidal potential .",
    "alternative fits to the galactic potential , including those associated with the long bar ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) or spiral arms ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) would also produce a noticeable difference curve .",
    "fitting the velocity curves to multiple galactic potentials is clearly an important next step , but beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "an alternative suggestion to explain only the asymmetry between the two curves near the solar circle is that of streaming motions associated with the carina spiral arm in qiv at @xmath96 @xcite . in mcg07",
    "we compared sgps qiv values with qi data from @xcite , which showed the quadrants deviating by about 10 @xmath58  from @xmath97 kpc ( @xmath98 ) . using the consistently measured data here , and shown in figure  [ fig : vdiff_l ] , we see that over the longitude range @xmath98 the terminal velocities in qi are @xmath99 @xmath58  ( mean @xmath100 @xmath58 ) lower than qiv , with no indication that the difference is converging towards zero at the solar circle .",
    "from the terminal velocities measured here we can calculate the rotation curve for @xmath101 kpc from the circular velocity relation @xmath102 and assuming @xmath103 , where we use iau standard values of @xmath104 kpc and @xmath105 .",
    "the rotation curves for qi , as calculated in this paper , and qiv , as calculated in paper i , are shown in figure  [ fig : rot_fit ] .",
    "in paper i we performed a joint linear fit to the qiv data along with h  i  rotation curve data of the first quadrant from @xcite , giving a fit of : @xmath106 .",
    "we repeat that exercise here substituting the new uniformly measured , high resolution h  i  data for first quadrant .",
    "the joint fit is very similar , as can be seen in figure  [ fig : rot_fit ] , @xmath107 . the slightly smaller slope in the new fit is not within the formal fitting errors of either fit , but is less than 10% different and therefore on the order of the error in any given velocity measurement .",
    "also shown in this figure is the often used @xcite rotation curve , derived from co terminal velocities for qi .",
    "while this curve fits well the velocity structure of qi , it incorporates streaming motions that are not general to the inner galaxy rotation curve .",
    "@xcite have recently used parallax measurements of masers to carefully measure the milky way rotation curve and derive galactic constants , @xmath25 and @xmath24 . in @xcite",
    "they explored several rotation curve fits to their data .",
    "their simplest fit , which is an excellent match to their data at @xmath108 kpc , is given by @xmath109 , where @xmath110 and @xmath111 @xmath58 .",
    "this produces an almost flat rotation curve for large radii , as shown in figures [ fig : rot_fit ] & [ fig : rot_fit_reid ] . including data interior to @xmath112 kpc",
    ", @xcite found that the so - called `` universal '' rotation curve for spiral galaxies from @xcite captured the decrease in velocities at @xmath113 kpc , while still maintaining the nearly flat , though slightly declining , rotation curve for larger radii .",
    "their fit to the `` universal '' curve is also shown in figure  [ fig : rot_fit ] using their value of @xmath114 @xmath58 .",
    "both the @xcite rotation curves are above our h  i   velocities calculated from iau value of @xmath115 @xmath58 . for comparison , in figure  [ fig : rot_fit_reid ]",
    "we show our h  i  rotation curves calculated assuming @xmath116 @xmath58  and @xmath117 kpc , as in @xcite . for these values ,",
    "the ` universal' rotation curve gives a reasonable match to the data .",
    "because of the small range of galactic radii available in our data we do not perform a new fit with the ` universal' rotation curve .",
    "future work should include a careful compilation of the extremely accurate maser parallax measurements with these new h  i  curves for a complete ` universal' milky way rotation curve .",
    "for now we recommend the joint linear fit as a good estimate of the h  i  rotation curve at @xmath118 kpc .",
    "an advantage of our simple linear fit to the rotation curve over the range @xmath119 to @xmath120 kpc range , i.e.  @xmath121 , where @xmath122 @xmath123 , is that kinematic distances are given by the quadratic equation , based on equation 1 and the law of cosines . scaling the observed velocity of an object of interest , @xmath67 , by @xmath124 gives dimensionless parameter @xmath125 .",
    "we can therefore define the kinematic distance , @xmath126 , in terms of the parameter @xmath127 as : @xmath128 where the constants are @xmath129 and @xmath130 .",
    "the square root term gives the line of sight distance measured on either side of the subcentral point , whose distance is defined as @xmath131 .      using the joint polynomial fit described above",
    "we can subtract the overall rotation to examine the structure of the residuals in the rotation curve .",
    "these residuals should reflect bulk non - circular motions in the galaxy .",
    "the residual curves for both quadrants are shown in figure  [ fig : resids ] . once again , qi is shown in red and qiv in blue .",
    "the values for the two quadrants are extremely close at @xmath132 kpc and for @xmath133 kpc .",
    "the agreement at @xmath133 kpc is expected as we trace gas towards the cardinal points @xmath134 and @xmath135 , where circular rotation projects towards @xmath136 @xmath58 .",
    "the agreement at @xmath137 kpc is more surprising . while there are clearly small scale variations with @xmath138 , i.e.  @xmath139 pc , the magnitude of those features are generally @xmath140 @xmath58 .",
    "the largest deviations occur in the range @xmath141 kpc . in this region",
    "the two curves are offset from each other by @xmath142 @xmath58 .",
    "this region also encompasses some of the salient features noted in the terminal velocity curve discussed in  [ subsec : vt_comp ] . notably the inflection seen in both quadrants terminal velocity curves at @xmath143",
    "is observed as the rise in both quadrants rotation curves at @xmath144 kpc and the flattening of the slope of the terminal velocity curves between @xmath74 and @xmath75 are observed as the smooth rise in the range @xmath145 kpc .",
    "the most striking aspect of the residuals shown on figure  [ fig : resids ] is the similarity in the saw - tooth patterns seen in both quadrants between @xmath146 kpc .",
    "in addition , by eye it appears that there is a great deal of structure in both quadrants that has a characteristic width of a few hundred pc , even though the resolution of the survey is much finer than this , typically @xmath14710 pc x @xmath148 .",
    "although the effects of h  i  absorption toward compact continuum sources have been removed , there are a few very narrow features on figure  [ fig : resids ] that correspond to local velocity perturbations , most of the structure in both residual curves is much broader in @xmath138 .    to robustly estimate the characteristic width of the structure in the residuals on figure  [ fig : resids ] , we compute the autocorrelation functions of both quadrant s rotation curves .",
    "these are shown on figure  [ fig : correlation ] and labelled `` acf '' . to construct the autocorrelations , we first re - sample the residuals to a constant step size of 5 pc in galactic radius .",
    "all correlation functions are computed using the routine _ scipy - signal - correlate _ from the python numerical package _",
    "numpy _ , which handles edge effects in a conservative way .",
    "but given that our data covers a range of only @xmath1475 kpc , edge effects still lead to increasing uncertainty for lags of more than about @xmath1492 kpc .",
    "we have compared the scipy correlation program with other algorithms , and they give similar results for lags less than half the total interval of @xmath138 used for the correlation , which is 3.5 to 7.5 kpc .    the half - width to half maximum of the autocorrelation functions for the first and fourth quadrants are 290 and 210 pc , respectively .",
    "their half widths to first zero crossing are 690 pc ( qi ) and 730 pc ( qiv ) .",
    "this shows that the residuals have generally quite broad structure , in spite of a few sharp variations that can be seen in figure  [ fig : resids ] . that we observe a consistent scale size for velocity fluctuations in the rotation curve that is much greater than the resolution of the data suggests that we are probing a characteristic size scale for dynamical effects",
    "this size scale is of the same order as that often suggested for the energy injection scale of turbulence in the milky way , @xmath150 pc ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) , and similar to the scale of the largest dynamical objects in the galaxy , specifically potential energy injection sites of clustered supernovae @xcite .",
    "in addition to auto - correlation analysis , we can more robustly estimate the degree of similarity between the rotation residuals of the first and fourth quadrants with a cross - correlation analysis .",
    "the cross - correlation function between the residuals two quadrants shows a distinct peak near zero lag on figure  [ fig : correlation ] ( `` ccf '' ) .",
    "the peak has normalised correlation of 0.27 at @xmath151 pc shift ( positive @xmath152 meaning that the qiv residuals are shifted to higher radius relative to the qi residuals at the peak ) .",
    "the non - zero normalised correlation coefficient confirms the visual impression that the two curves are very similar in their structure .",
    "furthermore , a radial shift between the two curves is what we expect if the large - scale structure is induced by spiral arms .",
    "the magnitude of this shift , however , is surprisingly small .",
    "the large sidelobes at @xmath1492 kpc lag for each of the cross - correlation function and auto - correlation functions show that the residuals have structure that is roughly sinusoidal with wavelength about 2 kpc .",
    "this corresponds to the sawtooth pattern that is apparent by eye between @xmath2 kpc .",
    "it has long been assumed that these large departures from a smooth circular rotation are induced by the spiral pattern of the inner galaxy ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "other grand design spirals like m81 the perturbations give sinusoidal departures from circular rotation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) with amplitude ( peak - to - peak ) about 20 km s@xmath153 . unfortunately ,",
    "interpretation of the structure in the residuals ( figure  [ fig : resids ] ) is complicated by the changing projection of the line of sight as we move along the locus of sub - central points and cross spiral arms at various angles . furthermore , the velocity field predictions are different for linear and non - linear density wave theories @xcite . the cross - correlation function and",
    "autocorrelation functions presented in figure  [ fig : correlation ] will be useful constraints for hydrodynamical models of galactic structure and dynamics ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "underlying most of our analysis is the assumption that the measurement of the terminal velocity represents gas at the tangent point and probes the true rotation curve . of course",
    ", that premise is flawed slightly because of non - circular rotation due to streaming motions near spiral arms or the elliptical orbits around the central bar . given the observational indications that the milky way has a long bar , extending over a half - length of @xmath154 kpc and an angle of @xmath155  from the sun - galactic center line ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we expect non - axisymmetric effects in the inner galaxy rotation curve .",
    "recently @xcite explored this topic thoroughly using a hydrodynamical simulation of a barred milky way - like galaxy . from the simulation they measured the velocity field and therefore both the true rotation curve and the rotation curve assuming the maximum velocity is found at the tangent point .",
    "their analysis found that for @xmath156 kpc kpc . ]",
    "the average tangent point derived curve is very close to the true galactic rotation curve , however , in the range @xmath157 kpc , the tangent point analysis deviates by as much as @xmath158% for bar angles of @xmath159 .",
    "@xcite found for their fiducial bar of orientation @xmath160 , qi tangent point velocities over - estimated the true azimuthal velocity and qiv tangent point values under - estimated the azimuthal velocities .",
    "similar results appear in the velocity field modelling by @xcite and seem to agree well with the residual rotation curves derived here . because of the complexities in attributing measured terminal velocities to the tangent point the next steps for understanding the milky way rotation curve must be either comparison with simulations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or surface density mass modelling ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we have used the vla galactic plane survey of h  i  and 21-cm continuum emission @xcite to derive the terminal velocity curve of the first galactic quadrant with a sampling of 4 .",
    "we find excellent consistency between the structure of the first quadrant h  i  terminal velocity curve and the co terminal velocity curve derived by @xcite , but with a systematic offset in the h  i  suggesting that the co curve slightly over - estimates the terminal velocities .",
    "combining our first quadrant h  i  data with the terminal velocity curve of the fourth quadrant from the southern galactic plane survey @xcite published in our companion paper @xcite , we have produced the most uniform , high resolution , terminal velocity curve for the milky way interior to the solar circle .",
    "as seen previously @xcite there is a clear asymmetry between the terminal velocity curves of the two quadrants .",
    "we confirm that an outward motion of the lsr alone can not explain the asymmetry @xcite , highlighting the need to include a non - axisymmetric azimuthal velocity component for the inner milky way .",
    "we find that the measured terminal velocities in two quadrants are almost identical over the galactic radius ranges , @xmath161 kpc and from @xmath133 kpc to the solar circle . over the intermediate radius range ( @xmath146 kpc ) ,",
    "the amplitudes of the two quadrants differ by @xmath162 to @xmath163 , but they show remarkably similar structure .    using the rotation curves for first and fourth quadrants together we have performed a new joint fit to the milky way rotation curve over the range @xmath164 kpc .",
    "this curve can be used for estimating kinematic distances .",
    "this joint fit smooths over the streaming motions contained in the previous first quadrant fit by @xcite and should be used in preference to that curve for inner galaxy kinematic distances .",
    "we also compared our data with the flat and `` universal '' spiral galaxy rotation curves from @xcite , finding both to be reasonable fits to the h  i  rotation curve when calculated assuming @xmath114 @xmath58  and @xmath117 kpc , instead of the iau recommended values for the galactic constants .",
    "finally , we compared the velocity residuals for the two quadrants after subtraction of the fitted rotation curve .",
    "the residuals show remarkably similar structure that is roughly sinusoidal with a wavelength of about 2 kpc .    with this high resolution , uniform terminal velocity curve",
    "we have overcome the remaining observational problems limiting our knowledge of the milky way terminal velocities .",
    "there is no indication from our measurements that either higher resolution or higher sensitivity observations would change the h  i  rotation curve derived here over the range @xmath165 kpc .",
    "further progress on the milky way rotation curve will need to come from the compilation of these h  i  values with other measurements such as on - going maser parallax ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) or upcoming stellar parallax from gaia .",
    "those measurements , together with our h  i  terminal velocity curve can be used to improve the estimates of the surface density of the milky way disk and spiral structure .",
