    "bx mon was discovered on a harvard objective prism plate by mayall ( 1940 ) .",
    "its classification as a symbiotic system ( ss ) was based on its optical spectrum , showing a combination of strong hydrogen emission lines and tio absorption bands of a late - type star ( iijima 1985 , kenyon 1986 , viotti et al .",
    "its identification as ss has been questioned ( allen 1982 ) , until medium ionization lines have been identified in iue ( international ultraviolet explorer spectra ) ( michalitianos 1982 ) .",
    "its infrared colors and spectral energy distribution are that of a normal m5 iii star and exclude the presence of a mira variable ( whitelock & cathpole 1983 , viotti et al .",
    "1986 , dumm et al .",
    "no nova - like eruption event has been recorded for this system .",
    "bx mon large photometric variability had already been discovered in 1940 by mayall ( 1940 ) and a period of 1380 d was suggested , with ephemeris jd(max)= 2412490 d. its optical and ultraviolet spectrum is also strongly variable . however , the spectroscopic variability is hardly explained by the mayall s period ( iijima 1985 , viotti et al .",
    "iijima ( 1985 ) noted that two epochs of low excitation states seem to occur at phases near the photometric maximum of mayall s ephemeris , suggesting that the mayall s light curve representation may contain a mistake or that a change occurred in the variations phase .",
    "dumm et al .",
    "( 1998 ) analyzed the mayall s data and the data of the rasnz ( royal astronomical society of new zealand ) obtained between the years 1989 and 1995 , covering less than two cycles .",
    "two possible periodicities have been suggested , p=1338@xmath08 d and p=1401@xmath08 d. the period p= 1401 d seems to explain the iue spectra variations ( dumm et al .",
    "1998 ) and in particular the uv flux attenuation as due to eclipses of the hot component by the cool one .",

    "( 1998 ) established an orbital period of 1259 @xmath016 d. a period of p= 1262 @xmath032 d was determined from the rasnz data analysis , that is consistent with the radial - velocity period .",
    "more recently , brandi et al . (",
    "2009 ) reanalyzed old and new radial velocity data and suggested the value of 1290 d for the binary period .",
    "in order to better understand the nature of bx mon variability , we have reanalyzed the long - term light curve ( lc ) of bx mon using the mayall s data and the aavso ( american association of variable stars observers ) ones .",
    "section 2 presents the data set that we analyze in this paper .",
    "section 3 describes the analysis that we applied on the data and our main results . in section 4",
    "we identify the clocks that give rise to the periodic variations in the lc of the system and propose a qualitative model which could explain how these clocks modulate the optical brightness of the system .",
    "section 5 is a brief summary .",
    "our reconstructed lc spans the time interval from december 1889 up to march 2009 , i.e. from jd=2411380 to jd=2454905 , with a large gap of more than 11000 days , from march 1940 to february 1972 , for which we could not find any reported magnitude measurement .",
    "we refer to the two data sets on the two sides of the gap as section a and section f+b ( the meaning will be explained below ) .",
    "section a of the lc was retrieved from mayall s ( 1940 ) figure 1 , which presents the estimated photographic magnitudes of the star on the harvard plates from 1889 to 1940 .",
    "our section f+b of the lc is taken from the aavso data base of measurements covering the years between 1972 and 2009 .",
    "we have binned the visual aavso data on 10 days averages .",
    "1 presents the lc of bx mon showing variations , reaching more than 3 mag amplitude , and the large gap in time between the two sets of observations . the solid line in fig .",
    "1 is a running mean over a linearly interpolated lc of the system , with a running window of 2810 d. we have broken down section f+b into two distinct sections f and b and the three sections of the lc are marked in fig .",
    "section f covers the 4010 days between jd=2441365 and jd= 2445375 . in this section",
    "the average luminosity of the system over @xmath1 days was significantly larger than during any other interval of the same length , as evidenced by the running mean curve in the figure .",
    "two fluctuations in the brightness of the system occur in this section that ends with a rapid decline of the mean brightness back to the mean magnitude that the system had in section a.",
    "fig . 2 ( a ) is the power spectrum ( ps ) of the lc shown in fig . 1 , computed according to the lomb - scargle prescription ( scargle 1982 ) , and fig .",
    "2 ( b ) shows the window function .",
    "as clearly seen , there are quite a number of peaks in the ps around the frequency corresponding to p=1300 d that are statistically significant . however",
    ", folding the lc onto any one of the corresponding periodicities demonstrates that none of these periods fit the data of the entire lc .",
    "2 ( c ) is the ps of section a of the lc .",
    "four peaks stand out clearly above the noise level .",
    "their corresponding periodicities in days are listed in table 1 , the highest one corresponds to the period = 1373 d. we remark here that the period values in table 1 are the ones we derive by the fitting process that we apply as explained in section 3.2 . for completeness",
    "we list here the slightly different period values associated with the frequencies of the 4 peaks in the ps .",
    "they are : 1370 @xmath010 , 687 @xmath0 2.5 , 498 @xmath01.4 and 343 @xmath01 days .",
    "the quoted error estimates correspond to the half widths at half maximum of the corresponding peak profile in the ps .",
    "there is hardly any doubt that the second and 4th periodicities in section a are the 2nd and 4th harmonics of the major one , while the 3d one is an alias as identified by a `` clean '' routine that we have developed and applied to the data .",

    "we reverse the period search process and by least square procedure we look for the pair of periods around 1260 and 1373 , that combined with the harmonics and their appropriate beats , produce the best fitted multi - periodic waves to section a and section b of the data set .",

    "we identify 5 epochs of uv observations .",
    "the exposure classification code of the observation lwp31630l shows that no continuum spectrum was detected and we discarded this epoch .    as mentioned in section 1 , dumm et al .",
    "( 1998 ) noted two episodes of strong attenuation in the uv flux of the system as measured by the iue telescope .",
    "the two episodes are separated from each other by 4347 days . in trying to interpret the events as an eclipse phase in the binary cycle of the system dumm et al .",
    "( 1998 ) were forced to postulate a period of 1401 days .",
    "the first iue event , that took place at epoch 1 , falls within our section f of the lc .",
    "as indicated by the mean brightness of the star , at that time some other unknown process dominated the optical luminosity of the system , probably the end of the event that brought about the period switching in the quiescence state of the system .",
    "therefore the timing of that event of attenuation of the uv flux is probably unrelated to the clocks that drive the two major periodicities of the system .",
    "in fact , in the same section f , the two optical fluctuations in the brightness of the system are also not in phase with neither one of the two dominant periods in the lc .",
    "the other iue measurement of attenuated uv is epoch 5 .",
    "there is virtually no trace of uv continuum emission from bx mon in the wavelength range 100 - 180 nm at that time , see fig 5 .",
    "unfortunately , no frame of the lwp camera of iue of the same date exists in the iue archives .",
    "the lack of continuum emission may indicate an eclipse of the white dwarf ( wd ) of the system by the giant star , namely , conjunction .",
    "this , however , is not necessarily so .",
    "lack of far uv emission from the hot component of symbiotic stars has been recorded also when no eclipse is expected .",

    "n.5 only the emission lines are present while no continuum is detected .",
    "we retrieved the ubvric photometry ( munari et al .",
    "1992 ) and a few jhkl measurements ( henden & munari 2008 , phillips 2007 ) , that have been transformed to the johnson system ( bessel 1983 ) and to flux , according to the standard procedure ( zombeck 2000 , page 100 ) .",

    ", we tried to construct a physical model of the various radiation sources within this stellar system , i.e. cool giant star , hot component , emission nebula , possible accretion disk .",
    "such an attempt has been made already in the past by kenyon & webbink ( 1984 ) who were unable to come up with an acceptable fit .",
    "our attempts have also been severely hampered by the scarcity of multiwavelength spectral observations in this star , especially such that are performed simultaneously , even 27 years after the pioneering work of kenyon & webbink ( 1984 ) .",
    "simultaneity is of course a necessary condition for an analysis of this kind to be meaningful for a system such as bx mon the energy output of which is varying in time by nearly two orders of magnitude .",

    "5 are most probable representing the contribution of the hot component of the system .",
    "two of them ( no . 4 and 6 ) were made close to epochs of maximum brightness in the optical light curve of our section b ( see fig .",
    "these spectra are comparable to iue spectra during active events of other symbiotic stars such as z and and ar pav ( see figs 3 and 19 of skopal 2005 ) .",
    "this fact and the resemblance of the optical light curve of bx mon with those of z and and ag dra ( skopal 2007 , figs 2 and 8) , for example , strengthen our claim , made in the following section , that in bx mon the cyclic outbursts of the system are events of intense mass transfer .",
    "our time series analysis , in particular fig .",
    "3 , suggests that two photometric cycles characterize the major brightness variations of bx mon in the last 120 years , = 1373 d and = 1265 d. the period   dominated the first 55 years , while   is the major one in the last 26 years of the star history . the structure of the entire lc observed in section a can be well reproduced by an harmonic wave of the   periodicity with its 2nd and 4th harmonics , as seen in figure 4 . the variability in section b is well represented by the major period and the 5 other periods listed in table 1 , all of which are simple linear combinations of   and .",

    "3 b ) is the fit to section b of the series of   with the 5 beats periods listed in table 1 .",
    "we note that the difference in the periods between sections a and b of the lc can hardly be attributed to the relatively small difference in the colors of the two lcs , the pg passband of the harvard plates , and the eye response function of the aavso observations .",
    "an orbitally - related period has usually different amplitudes in different passbands , but never a different value .",
    "this difference must therefore be due to a real change in the period of the cyclic outbursts of the system that took place between the epoch before the gap in the observations around the middle of the 20th century , and the epoch after it .        before discussing the two major periodicities of the system we comment on the nature of the period = 656 d that is identified in the lc of section b of the data",
    "( see section 3.1 ) .",
    "we suggest that this is the sidereal rotation period of the giant component of the bx mon binary system .",
    "zamanov et al .",
    "( 2008 ) measured the rotational velocity of this giant , quoting two possible values , 11.0@xmath01.5 and 9.4@xmath01.5 km / s .",
    "taking their first suggested value , adopting the value @xmath9 for the radius of the m5iii giant of this system ( van belle et al .",
    "1999 ) , and assuming that the equatorial plane of the giant is seen roughly edge on , the resulting rotational period of the giant is p@xmath10= 646 d. this is almost identical to our number 656 d obtained from the fourier analysis .",
    "thus our interpretation of the results obtained by our time series analysis of the lc of the star as the rotation period of the giant , leads us to practically the same consequence about this period that was obtained by entirely independent observers and method .",
    "our analysis shows that the two major periods of the system , = 1373 d and = 1256 d do not exist simultaneously in the lc of bx mon , but rather that a major switch between the two took place during the gap in the record of the observations .",
    "such a large change of 120 days in the photometric period of the system within 32 years is quite abrupt . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "such a discrete change from one periodicity to another , both with amplitudes that amounts to 80 - 90% of the total optical emissivity of the star has not been observed so far in any other symbiotic star .",
    "we venture to say not even in any other star .",
    "there must have been some dramatic event or process that took place in the bx mon stellar system that was the cause of this period switch .",
    "a likely photometric remnant of this event may be detected in the first 4000 days after the gap in the observations .",
    "for some 2500 days during that time , the mean brightness of the system was higher than at any other interval of the same time length .",
    "also , as mentioned already in section 3.3 , the two light fluctuations recorded during these 4000 days are not in phase with either one of the two major periods of the system .",
    "the value of   is almost certainly the binary period of the system as determined spectroscopically by fekel et al .",
    "( 2000 ) who suggested the period 1259@xmath016 d , and by brandi et al .",
    "( 2009 ) who suggested the value 1290 .",
    "our   is of course consistent with fekel s et al .",
    "( 2000 ) value , and marginally also with that of brandi et al ( 2009 ) .",
    "it is more difficult to trace the origin of the   period of this system .",
    "we have already noted in section 1 that mira pulsations of the giant star are an unlike origin of the periodicity .",
    "bx mon occupies the domain of normal m stars in a ( j - h)-(h - k ) relation ( whitelock et al .",
    "1994 , phillips 2007 ) and does not show variability in the infrared ( viotti et .",
    "al 1986 ) .",
    "the origin of the   periodicity may become clearer when we consider it as a linear combination of the system binary period , and the rotation period of the giant : = ( 1/-1/)@xmath2 ( see table 1 ) .",
    "the period   is the length of one `` day '' of an observer on the surface of the giant component of the system , whose sun is the hot component .",
    "the giant is rotating with the sidereal period = 656 d , in the same sense as the binary revolution of the period = 1256 d. the observer will see the sun circling his or her sky in the retrograde direction with a period = 1373 d. if   is the spin period of the giant , as is most likely the case , this is true regardless of any other physical assumption .",
    "we now suggest , in mostly qualitative terms , a physical process by which the ticks of this clock translate to outbursts in the lc of the system .",
    "if the radius of the giant star is not very small compared with the average radius of its theoretical roche lobe , the outer surface of it is distorted by the tides induced by the hot component .",
    "the tidal bulge created in the giant atmosphere rotates on its surface with the   periodicity .",
    "this effect is well described and formulated in quantitative terms by lecar , wheeler and mckee ( 1976 ) .",
    "if there is a region fixed on the surface of the giant , for example around a pole of a stellar oblique dipole magnetic field , where matter is less bound gravitationally , an intense mass accretion from the giant may be triggered at every passage of the bulge through that region .",
    "each episode in this cyclic train of events liberates intense gravitational energy .",
    "it is likely to be a trigger of an instability outburst in the accretion disk around the wd of the system , liberating even larger amount of gravitational energy .",
    "finally , the process may end up by large amount of hydrogen rich matter falling on the surface of the wd causing or enhancing already existing process of nuclear burning there , liberating yet another large amount of energy .",
    "a quantitative analysis of thermodynamical and energy transfer processes that would show how the cyclically liberated energy is eventually appearing as cyclical outbursts of the optical radiation of the system is beyond the scope of our paper , which is concerned with the temporal behavior of the optical continuum emission of the system .",
    "however , we refer the reader to the work of sokoloski et al .",
    "( 2006 ) who made a detailed analysis of multiwavelength observations in one of the outbursts of the symbiotic star z and .",
    "the optical lc of z and shows fluctuations that are rather similar to those of bx mon , in their amplitude as well as in their time scale .",
    "sokoloski et al .",
    "( 2006 ) suggest a `` combination nova '' model as an interpretation of the spectroscopic and photometric observations , from the x - ray to the radio spectral regions , performed over one oscillation episode of z and .",
    "a similar analysis of one light fluctuation of bx mon require similar amount of simultaneous or nearly simultaneous multi - wavelength observations , which are not yet in existence .",
    "the present work is concerned with understanding the clocks that regulate this behavior .",
    "the z and case serves as a demonstration that qualitatively and energy - wise , our suggested mechanism how the diurnal cycle on the surface of the giant is translated to outbursts of the system is a plausible one",
    ". naturally , much more work , especially in observations , is required in order to put this interpretation on firmer grounds .",
    "the characteristics of the fluctuations in section b of the lc are similar to those in section a. they too have the nature of outbursts rather than of smooth continued variability . as discussed in section 4 ( see fig .",
    "3 a ) and b ) ) , even if the hot component is eclipsed by the giant at conjunction , the effect of it in the optical broad band photometry of the system is negligible",
    ". therefore the origin of the intense periodic fluctuations with the binary periodicity in section b can hardly be attributed to the changing geometrical aspects of the system associated with the binary revolution . in particular",
    "it is very unlikely that they are marks of eclipses .",
    "this becomes quite clear by comparing fig .",
    "3 b ) or fig . 4",
    "b ) with figure 1 in skopal et al . ( 2000 ) , depicting the lc of the symbiotic star ar pav in which most of the variability is indeed due to eclipses .",
    "the radial velocity curve of bx mon presented by fekel at al .",
    "( 2000 ) indicates that the binary orbit is quite eccentric .",
    "these authors suggest an eccentricity of 0.45 - 0.55 .",
    "it is therefore consistent with our qualitative model to suggest that the fluctuations with the periodicity in section b of the lc have also their origin in intense mass accretion events in the system . since after the gap in the observations in the middle of the 20th century , these outbursts take place whenever the system is near its periastron passage , hence the binary periodicity",
    "this periodicity is hardly seen in section a since the events of accretion from the bulge of the giant deplete the mass reservoir in the atmosphere of the giant to the extent that not much mass is left to be accreted at periastron passages .",
    "once the accretion from the bulge is inhibited , accretion at periastron takes over .",
    "some support for this suggestion comes from the phase that the periastron passages of the system occupy in the photometric cycle .",
    "the vertical dashed lines in fig . 3 b ) mark the times of periastron passage .",
    "these are based on the date jd 2449680 of periastron passage , as given by fekel et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , with all other vertical lines being drawn on the time axis at equal intervals of 1256 d. one can see that periastron passages lie on the ascending branch of the cyclic outbursts , as expected in our suggested scenario . lajoie and sills ( 2011 ) have recently shown that the peak rates of mass transfer in eccentric binaries occur after periastron , at an orbital phase of  0.56 , independently of the eccentricity and mass of the stars .",
    "sokoloski at al .",
    "( 2006 ) show that in the z and symbiotic system , there is a delay of a few weeks between the time of maximum mass loss rate from the donor star and the time of the instability in the accretion disk triggered by it , with the associated liberation of gravitational energy in that process .",
    "the igniting of , or the extra contribution to the nuclear burning on the surface of the wd take place even later in time .",
    "this is why maximum light of the outbursts in section b in bx mon occurs some 350 days after periastron passages .",
    "according to this interpretation , the period change that took place between the years 1940 and 1972 may be a result of an inhibition that was put on mass accretion from the bulge of the giant .    a process that may affect the accretion rate from the giant , inhibiting accretion from the bulge zone , is a change in the intensity or the structure of the magnetic field of the giant .",
    "after the gap in the observations , the configuration of the giant global magnetic field is such that the rotating bulge in the atmosphere of the star does not pass anymore through an area of small gravitational g value . such change in the magnetic field of the giant may be due to a certain magnetic dynamo cycle that operates in the outer layers of the star .",
    "we note in this connection that in 3 other symbiotic systems , bf cyg , yy her and z and , we have also found in their historical lcs indications for the operation of a magnetic dynamo cycle in the outer layers of the giant stars ( leibowitz & formiggini 2006 , formiggini & leibowitz 2006 , leibowitz & formiggini 2008 ) .",
    "as for the idea that periodic events of intense mass transfer in binary systems are the cause of , or a trigger for periodic outbursts in the em radiation of the system , it is of course quite an old one .",
    "it was discussed extensively , in particular in the context of x - ray binaries .",

    "( 1980 ) , or stevens ( 1988 ) .",
    "the period 2 * 7370=2*=14740=(1/1256 - 1/1373)@xmath2 days is the interval between noon time of an observer on the surface of the rotating giant when his sun , the hot component , is seen at a certain position in his sky , relative to distance stars , and the next noon time when he sees his sun in the same direction in his sky .",
    "after half of this time , the sun will be seen at the observer s mid day at exactly the opposite direction . thus twice every 14740/1373=10.736 giant days ,",
    "i.e. with the periodicity , the maximum alignment between any fixed diameter line in the giant star and the radius vector from the center of the giant to the instantaneous l1 point of the binary system is reached along the direction in space of the major axis of the giant elliptical orbit .",
    "this can be expressed mathematically by the relation 1/= .5/(1/-1/ ) .",
    "we note again , that if   is the rotation period of the giant , this is a simple geometrical truism , regardless of any other physical consideration .",
    "we can now suggest again how this clock is modulating the brightness of the system , as manifested by the period = 14740/2=7370 earth days , identified in section b of the data ( see table 1 ) .",
    "this period is the time interval between two successive events that we have just described , with the axis of a magnetic dipole field of the giant playing the role of the diametric axis mentioned above . in this scenario the north and",
    "the south poles of this field are alternating successively in getting closest to the l1 point during periastron passage .",
    "so while in section b , the timing of the intense mass transfer is controlled by the binary revolution through periastron passages , the magnetic field is still modulating to some extent the intensity of the mass transfer episodes .",
    "the most intense transfer events occur when the giant makes a periastron passage while one of its magnetic poles is closest to the l1 point of the system at that time .",
    "we do not pretend to know how a magnetic field around the l1 point affects the rate of mass transfer through this point .",
    "we note , however , that the same qualitative scenario would explain the observed 7370 d modulation also if a magnetic field around the l1 point inhibits rather than intensifies mass transfer through this point .",
    "the frequency of the period 3=431 d that appears in section b satisfies the equality 1/3=1/+1/(see table 1 ) .",
    "such a beat of the   and the   periodicities will result if the intensity of a light source in the system that is modulated by the giant rotation period   is modulated also by a cyclically varying agent with the binary period",
    ". this would be the case if the origin of the periodicity is a stable or quasi stable non uniform distribution of brightness on the surface of the giant star , such as the presence of large star spots .",
    "the rotation of the giant gives rise to the   variability , as measure by an observer on earth .",
    "this light variation is however further modulated due the system binary revolution , for example by obscuration of the giant by some material component at fixed coordinates in the binary revolving frame ( e.g. gaseous disk around the wd ) .",
    "such modulation can also be the works of the well known reflection effect in close binaries .",
    "the giant hemisphere facing the hot component is brighter than the giant other hemisphere .",
    "as the system revolves an observer on earth see the brighter hemisphere periodically at the binary periodicity .",
    "thus , the light from bx mon contains a component the brightness of which depends on time as i(t)=c*cos[(2*pi)/)t]*cos[(2*pi/)t ] , disregarding possible phase terms .",
    "elementary equalities of trigonometry imply that the fourier decomposition of the time series of the lc of the star should include a component with the frequency of the above expression .",
    "this effect was first discussed in details by warner ( 1986 ) .",
    "as mentioned in section 3.1 , the other two additional periods that modulate the optical lc of the star in section b , p1=1067 and p2=1687 , can also be understood as beats of the two fundamental periods of the system   and , or as simple linear combinations of the pair   and   ( see table 1 ) .",
    "we do not present in this paper specific geometrical realizations of these 2 linear combinations .",
    "we do note , however , that various beats of the spin frequency of a star in an interacting binary system with the orbital frequency of the system is not a rare phenomenon .",
    "appearances of such beat frequencies , or sidebands , are particularly prevalent in magnetic cataclysmic variables , as discussed by warner ( 1986 ) .",
    "recent examples and discussions of beats and sidebands in lcs of interacting binaries are the works of woudt et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , or of bloemen et al .",
    "the stellar system bx mon is of course vastly different from the stars discussed in the cited examples , all of which belong to the family of cataclysmic ( cv ) stars .",
    "however the interplay between gravitational and magnetic effects and the varying aspects of the revolving binary system , which is the major cause for the appearance of spin - orbits beats in the lc , is common to both the symbiotic and the cv classes of stars .",
    "we point out , however , that even if no specific model can be suggested for explaining the p2 and p3 periodicities as beats of the two fundamental frequencies in the bx mon , this would not affect the analysis of the other 4 bx mon periodicities that we are presenting here .",
    "we have established the existence of 2 distinct periods in the historical lc of bx mon . between 1889 and 1940 i.e. section",
    "a , the brightness of the star fluctuated with a peak to peak amplitude of 2 - 3 magnitude , with a period of = 1373 @xmath04 d. this period appears in the lc with its 2nd and 4th harmonics .",
    "after the gap in the observations between 1940 and 1972 , the lc of the star in section b , is again fluctuating with a peak to peak amplitude of 1 - 2 magnitude .",
    "this time however , the major period is the binary period of the system = 1256@xmath016 d.    to the best of our knowledge , such an abrupt switch between a photometric period of a binary system which is 10% longer than the orbital period of the system , to its binary periodicity has no parallel in the observational study of any symbiotic star .",
    "it has probably neither been observed in any other binary star .    in both sections of the data",
    "set we identify periods that are various beats of the two major periodicities , in particular in section b we identify the = 656 d period as the sidereal rotation period of the giant component of the bx mon binary system .",
    "we suggest that the major fluctuations in the brightness of the star are due to events of intense accretion from the giant star onto its hot companion . between 1889 and 1940",
    "these events took place periodically with a period of 1373 d. after 1972 , they are occurring in the system at the binary orbital frequency .",
    "we acknowledge with thanks the variable star observations from the aavso international database contributed by observers worldwide and used in this research .",
    "we also thank an anonymous referee for comments that enable considerable improvements in some parts of the paper .",
