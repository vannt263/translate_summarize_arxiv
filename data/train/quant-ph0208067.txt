    "<S> we show that the requirement of manifest coordinate invariance of perturbatively defined quantum - mechanical path integrals in curved space leads to an extension of the theory of distributions by specifying unique rules for integrating products of distributions . </S>",
    "<S> the rules are derived using equations of motion and partial integration , while keeping track of certain minimal features stemming from the unique definition of all singular integrals in @xmath0 dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> our rules guarantee complete agreement with much more cumbersome calculations in @xmath1 dimensions where the limit @xmath2 is taken at the end . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to our previous papers where we solved the same problem for an infinite time interval or zero temperature , we consider here the more involved case of finite - time ( or non - zero temperature ) amplitudes . </S>"
