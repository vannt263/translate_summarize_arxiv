    "the first attempt to extend the single - channel inverse scattering problem ( isp ) on the line @xcite to a wider class of @xmath0 coupled - channel potentials was made by wadati and kamijo @xcite about @xmath1 years ago .",
    "they derived a marchenko equation associated with the @xmath0 schrdinger equation on the entire line @xmath2 .",
    "the problem has also been discussed in detail by calogero and degasperis @xcite . in these investigations the presence of threshold energies was not included and , most importantly , practical aspects of the implementation of the solution of the isp were not considered .",
    "twenty years later , the coupled - channel problem was taken further with the inclusion of thresholds @xcite and numerical solution of the corresponding marchenko equation .",
    "the lack of progress can be attributed to several reasons .",
    "firstly , the solution of the isp presupposes the knowledge of the full reflection coefficient ( moduli and phases ) at all incident momenta @xmath3 .",
    "this requirement can not be easily fulfilled , especially due to the missing phase information in standard experiments , a diffiuclty which is similar to the well known and longstanding phase problem in diffraction analysis @xcite .",
    "secondly , a profile with an unlimited support leads to tough numerical questions because the highly oscillatory behavior of the reflection coefficient makes the numerical procedure cumbersome and unstable .",
    "a third difficulty in the presence of bound states is the determination of the bound state normalization constants for the various channels which are crucial for a unique reconstruction of the underlying coupled - channel potential .",
    "coupled - channel inverse scattering techniques in one dimension have been considered and numerically implemented for specular reflection of polarized neutrons from plane surfaces of magnetized samples @xcite .",
    "these problems contain neither thresholds nor bound states and can be treated by the available marchenko equations .",
    "the formulation of coupled - channel inverse scattering techniques taking simultaneously into account thresholds and bound states would be a valuable progress , specifically for the design of semiconductor quantum devices and for the synthesis of quantum heterostructures with specific spectral properties @xcite . in this context",
    "the spectral design of systems with specific bound states embedded in the continuum would be of great interest for application .    in the present work we focus on the formulation of equations and numerical procedures for the solution of the coupled - channel inverse scattering problem on the line including thresholds .",
    "we also take into account bound states lying energetically below the thresholds of all channels , but exclude those embedded in the continuum of any channel .",
    "furthermore , we point out that the neglect of bound states in the input of the inversion procedure results in a supersymmetric partner potential with the same reflection properties , but completely different spatial shape . to test the formulated inverse scattering procedure and their numerical implementation ,",
    "model examples are considered . in these models",
    "the reflection coefficient has been evaluated using known profiles and employed as input in the inverse scattering equations to recover the original scattering profile .",
    "the agreement between the reconstructed and the original profile is an important measure for the quality of the inverse scattering procedure and a criterion for the reliability of the numerical methods .    in sect .",
    "ii we present the formalism and give the essentials for the derivation of the generalized marchenko equation . technical details concerning the evaluation of the corresponding integrals and the treatment of bound states",
    "are outlined in the appendix [ app : a ] .",
    "furthermore , we sketch briefly the formalism of supersymmetric quantum mechanics for coupled - channel systems with thresholds and the construction of supersymmetric partner potentials . the feasibility of the developed formalism is demonstrated in sect .",
    "iii , where we reconstruct successfully coupled - channel potentials from simulated reflection and bound state data for various two - channel systems .",
    "examples with and without thresholds and bound states are considered . in sect .",
    "iv we summarize our conclusions and discuss potential applications of this inverse scattering technique .",
    "the multi - channel schrdinger equation in one dimension has the form ( in appropriate units ) @xmath4 where @xmath5@xmath6 is assumed to be a real symmetric @xmath0 potential matrix of finite support with matrix elements @xmath7 , @xmath8 . without loss of generality we assume for convenience that @xmath5@xmath6 vanishes on the entire negative @xmath9-axis .",
    "the solution is a @xmath0 matrix whose columns are formed by the @xmath10 linearly independent solution vectors of ( [ ccs ] ) at an incident momentum @xmath11 and @xmath12 is a diagonal matrix containing the threshold energies @xmath13 , @xmath14 .",
    "we assume that the threshold energies , @xmath13 are arranged in increasing order with the lowest ( in most cases the entrance channel ) set to zero , @xmath15 . the special case of no thresholds , @xmath12@xmath16 ,",
    "has already been considered by wadati and kamijo @xcite in 1974 . here",
    ", we focus on the general case and allow the occurrence of non - vanishing thresholds , @xmath17 for @xmath18 .",
    "the free solutions are given by @xmath19@xmath20 , where now is given by @xmath21 @xmath22 being the @xmath10-dimensional unit matrix .",
    "the matrix is diagonal and is defined on the physical sheet of the riemann surface for the momentum variable @xmath11 .",
    "this sheet has an @xmath23-fold branch cut on the real axis on the upper rim of which @xmath24 , and the other diagonal elements of are defined as follows @xmath25 for @xmath26 . similarly to the one - channel case we introduce sets of linearly independent matrix jost solutions @xmath27@xmath28 , @xmath29@xmath28 defined by the boundary conditions @xmath30 the boundary condition @xmath29@xmath31 , for example , implies that each solution vector has at @xmath32 only in one channel an incoming wave from the left ( @xmath33 ) and none in all other channels .",
    "it is therefore obvious that @xmath29@xmath31 will provide the incoming component of the physical solution @xmath34 for incidence from the left .",
    "because the jost solutions form a complete set we can write the physical solution of ( [ ccs ] ) for left and right incidence in terms of @xmath27@xmath28 and @xmath29@xmath28 , @xmath35 here , @xmath36@xmath37 and @xmath37 are the reflection and transmission coefficient matrices for left ( l ) and right ( r ) incidence of the beam , respectively .    in the absence of thresholds the members of each pair of solutions are related by replacing @xmath11 by @xmath38 , i.e. @xmath29@xmath39@xmath27@xmath40 ( cf .",

    "the determination of the potential matrix , @xmath5@xmath6 , from the knowledge of the reflection matrix , @xmath36@xmath52 ( @xmath36@xmath53 ) , is known as inverse scattering problem and its solution can be obtained via integral equations , often referred as marchenko equations , for several quantum systems .",
    "recently , an integral equation for one - dimensional coupled - channel systems with thresholds has been presented @xcite .",
    "the derivation did not include the presence of bound states which are essential features of realistic quantum systems . here",
    ", we focus on the isp of coupled - channel systems in one dimension including thresholds and bound states . in the following the essential aspects of the derivation are outlined .    the integral equation for the solution of the isp associated with eq . ( [ ccs ] )",
    "is most easily obtained via the levin representation @xcite of @xmath27@xmath28 , @xmath54 inserting these expressions into eq .",
    "( [ ccs ] ) leads after some algebraic manipulations to differential equations for the transformation kernels @xmath55@xmath56 , @xmath57 \\ , , \\label{gder}\\ ] ] where we have introduced the commutator [ @xmath58,@xmath55]=@xmath58@xmath55-@xmath55@xmath58 .",
    "the transformation kernels are related to the potential via @xmath60 and satisfy the boundary conditions @xmath61 thus for @xmath62 , @xmath63 the above partial differential equations together with the boundary conditions ( [ bbc ] ) and ( [ rgbound ] ) constitute a goursat problem @xcite of a generalized nature .",
    "because of the restriction placed on the potentials , the existence of solutions for the partial differential equation ( [ gder ] ) under the above boundary conditions , can be easily shown as follows : a change of variables to @xmath64 and @xmath65 transforms ( [ gder ] ) into @xmath66\\ , ; \\label{vderuv}\\ ] ] a formal iterative solution of this partial differential equation involves repeated integrations over the potential .",
    "since we imposed the condition of finite support on @xmath5 this series will converge , due to the triangular nature of domains over which the integrations take place .",
    "the corresponding marchenko integral equation is obtained by multiplying eq .",
    "( [ physl ] ) from the right with @xmath67 substituting the levin representations for @xmath27@xmath31 and @xmath29@xmath31 on the right hand side and integrating over @xmath11 . restricting ourselves to systems which have only bound states at negative energies ( @xmath68 , @xmath69 ) and assuming that no bound states are embedded in the continuum",
    ", we can evaluate the relevant integrals ( see appendix [ app : a ] ) .",
    "the result can be cast into the form @xmath70 where @xmath71 .",
    "the input kernel of the above integral equation is given by @xmath72 with @xmath73 and @xmath74@xmath75@xmath76 .",
    "an important step for the application of the inverse scattering procedure is the determination of the input kernel @xmath77 from the scattering data . using the relation @xmath36@xmath78@xmath36@xmath79 one",

    "the bound state contribution , @xmath80 requires the knowledge of the bound state energies @xmath81 and the corresponding asymptotic normalization matrices @xmath82@xmath83 .",
    "if these quantities are obtained from simulated data , assuming a given potential @xmath5@xmath6 , then the inversion procedure should yield the original potential . in spectral design , however , these quantities are not available except when one is interested to have a bound state at a specific energy .",
    "in such a case arbitrary values of @xmath82@xmath83 , may result in a rather extended profile which is of limited interest because it can not easily be materialized .    to ensure that the inverse scattering procedure provides us with a potential @xmath5@xmath6 which vanishes for @xmath84 we must look for the required characteristics of @xmath77 . from the levin representation of @xmath27@xmath85 ,",
    "( [ levin2 ] ) it follows that @xmath55@xmath77 vanishes identically for @xmath84 . because of eq .",
    "( [ mar1 m ] ) , the input kernel @xmath86 must also vanish for @xmath87 and eq .",
    "( [ rho1mfb ] ) reduces for @xmath84 to the identity @xmath88 where @xmath87 .",

    "because of the peculiar spatial form of the contribution , it is obvious that those bound states which are energetically closest to threshold determine the behavior of the potential at large negative @xmath9-values . thus for practical applications , we firstly assume to have a finite number , @xmath91 , of bound states , and restrict ourselves to those energetically closest to threshold . with a fixed number @xmath91 of bound states , it is then possible to deduce the bound state parameters solely from the knowledge of @xmath36@xmath92 via the nonlinear eq .",
    "( [ rhotil ] ) .",
    "we may solve this equation in two steps .",
    "since the diagonal elements of @xmath55@xmath77 only depend on @xmath93 , a one dimensional fit to the sum of exponentials will produce the @xmath94-values and the diagonal elements of @xmath82@xmath83 .",
    "the knowledge of the @xmath94 values is then sufficient to obtain the remaining non diagonal elements of the @xmath82@xmath83 .",
    "therefore , the kernel @xmath95 can be recovered and the determination of the potential can be achieved via the marchenko equation .",
    "it should be noted that in the presence of thresholds , the input kernel @xmath86 depends on the variables @xmath9 and @xmath96 separately , while in the case of no thresholds it depends on the sum @xmath93 .",

    "it should be noted here that an insertion of a bound state at an arbitrary energy results in different values for the asymptotic normalization constants . when these constants are evaluated via ( [ rhobound ] ) ,",
    "then the inversion procedure provides us always with the original interaction .",
    "we have studied the inverse scattering problem on the line including thresholds and derived the corresponding integral equation of marchenko type .",
    "specific care was taken for the integrations on the physical sheet of the riemann surface of the momentum variable @xmath11 because of the @xmath23-fold branch cut as discussed in sect .",
    "we found that these branch cuts do not generate additional problems as long as we deal with systems sustaining only true bound states .",

    "furthermore , we considered the bound state contribution to @xmath77 which depends on the bound state energies and the so - called asymptotic normalization constants , where the latter are usually not accessible to experiment .",
    "we pointed out that the neglect of the bound state contribution results in a supersymmetric partner potential and leads to completely different profiles which , nevertheless , generate the same reflection coefficient matrix .",
    "thus , the absence of bound state data may lead to wrong conclusions concerning the profiles .",
    "we proposed a method for the determination of bound state data with regard to the design of quantum devices with pre - designed reflection properties .",
    "thus , a profile of finite range can be extracted which might be utilized by nanotechnology . although we can not force the profile to be limited to @xmath189 , the procedure allows to create non - vanishing profiles with a rather sharp edge at @xmath190 .",
    "a severe problem for applications is the necessity to provide scattering information in the energetically closed channels . in the examples presented here",
    ", we overcome this difficulty by using simulated data .",
    "however , for future applications a practically feasible and problem orientated method for analytical continuation has still to be developed .",
    "as already mentioned , the design of quantum devices via nanotechnology seems to be a potential field of application of these inverse scattering methods on the line ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in the presence of couplings between different electronic bands ,",
    "the construction of profiles with specific reflection and/or transmission properties via fitting methods guided by intuition becomes rather difficult .",
    "here , the developed coupled - channel inverse scattering methods can give a reliable guide line towards the required profile for the device .",
    "in this context the inclusion of bound states in the continuum in the inversion scattering procedure would be of great interest because slight changes in the retrieved profiles may result in sharp resonances which could be of interest for applications .",
    "work is in progress to handle this important question from the inverse scattering point of view .",
    "the presented formalism can be applied to any technological problem where one wants to retrieve or design the profile from the spectral information .",
