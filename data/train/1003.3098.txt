    "recently there have been considerable interest in practical applications of squeezed light .",
    "the interest stems from the recognition and experimental demonstrations that squeezed light could be used as a resource for entangling atomic ensembles  @xcite , noise - free information transfer and processing of entanglement  @xcite .",
    "testimony to this ability is provided by experimental observations of such effects as quantum teleportation  @xcite , quantum erasing  @xcite , quantum dense coding  @xcite , creation of entangled cluster states  @xcite , and entanglement storage in atomic ensembles  @xcite .",
    "the early studies of squeezed light and its applications showed that atomic dynamics and fluorescence can be significantly modified in the presence a squeezed vacuum field  @xcite .",
    "the reason is in an unequal phase - dependent redistribution of the fluctuations ( noise ) between the two quadrature components of the field .",
    "it has been shown that this modification can be a source of many novel effects and techniques in quantum optics  @xcite .",
    "in particular , the interaction of atoms with a squeezed vacuum field can lead to the inhibition of atomic phase decay  @xcite , subnatural linewidths  @xcite , hole burning and dispersive profiles in the fluorescence and absorption spectra  @xcite , a linear dependence on the intensity of the two - photon absorption rate  @xcite , transparency and gain without population inversion  @xcite .",
    "the fluorescence and absorption spectra were found to exhibit a striking dependence on the relative phase of the squeezed vacuum and the coherent driving field  @xcite .",
    "depending on the phase , the spectral lines can exhibit a subnatural or supernatural linewidth .",
    "although the phase dependent effects are usually predicted for systems that interact with a squeezed vacuum and are simultaneously driven by a coherent field , there can be interesting phase - dependent effects present even in the absence of the coherent field .",
    "this situation might be encountered when a system is initially prepared in a superposition state of its energy eigenstates . to put it another way , phase dependent effects",
    "are expected to vanish whenever the initial state of the system is an eigenstate of the energy , because then the emitted photon has no phase .",
    "entangled states of a multi - atom system could provide a reference phase for the phase of the squeezed vacuum field .",
    "with the recent great interest in the dynamics of entanglement in atomic systems , it is worth to study phase dependent changes in the time evolution of entangled states of two atoms coupled to a squeezed vacuum field .",
    "needless to say , the relative phase could be used as a control of the evolution of the entangled system .    in this paper",
    "we consider what may be termed `` initial - phase spectroscopy '' to search for a directly measurable signature of the abrupt loss of entanglement @xmath0 the phenomenon of sudden death of entanglement  @xcite .",
    "we study the transient spectrum of the field emitted from two two - level atoms initially prepared in a pure ( phase dependent ) entangled state and spontaneously decaying in a squeezed vacuum field .",
    "the squeezed field is treated as a correlated phase dependent noise environment .",
    "it is well known that an entangled state has a phase and nonvanishing correlations and therefore it is interesting to know how these initial correlations affect the spectrum when the system is subjected to a correlated phase dependent noise .",
    "we illustrate our considerations by examining two different models of the two - atom system , in which phase dependent effects arise dramatically .",
    "these are the small sample ( dicke ) model  @xcite and the spatially extended ( non - dicke ) model  @xcite . in both cases",
    ", the proposed initial - phase spectroscopy is found to be able to detect the phenomenon of entanglement sudden death by observing changes in the transient spectrum .",
    "these changes would also reveal other novel features that could provide a measure of the relative phase between two oscillating atomic dipoles .",
    "the transient spectra are produced in the following manner : in the time period before @xmath1 the atoms are prepared in an entangled state . at some time",
    "@xmath2 following the preparation of the atoms in the entangled state , a broadband squeezed vacuum field is applied to the atoms .",
    "then , we trace the time evolution of the fluorescence spectrum from @xmath1 to the steady - state distribution by monitoring the spectrum as a function of time for different relative phases of the initial entangled state and the applied squeezed vacuum field .    we interpret the results in terms of populations and two - photon coherence between collective states of the system and",
    "derive an analytical formula of the spectrum in the limit of the well separated spectral lines .",
    "it is well known that the intensity of a spectral line corresponding to transition between two collective states is proportional to the population of the state from which the transition originates .",
    "we find the intensity of one of the two spectral lines depends not only on the population of the upper state but also on the two - photon coherence .",
    "this dependence introduces the possibility to obtain the phase sensitive magnitude of this spectral line .",
    "in the course of the calculations , we observe that the sensitivity to the relative phase has an additional feature characteristic of entangled properties of the system .",
    "we find that the hole burning in the spectral line occurs at time when the atoms become disentangled .",
    "we are therefore led to the conclusion that observations of the hole burning in the spectral line provide a measurable signature of the phenomenon of entanglement sudden death .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we start by introducing the system and the definition of the transient spectrum . in section  [ sec3 ] , we derive the equations of motion for the density matrix elements which we then solve for two different cases : the small sample ( dicke ) model corresponding to atoms confined to a region of dimensions much smaller than the resonant wavelength , in section  [ sec4 ] , and for a spatially extended ( non - dicek ) model where the atoms are confined to a region of dimensions comparable and larger than the resonant wavelength , in section  [ sec5 ] .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec6 ] , we summarize our results .",
    "we propose to study phase dependent effects of an entangled system in terms of the transient spectrum of the fluorescence field emitted by a two - atom system interacting with a broadband multi - mode squeezed vacuum field .",
    "different definitions of the transient spectrum have been proposed , with their weaknesses and strengths summarized in  ref .",
    "@xcite . as we shall be interested in signatures of the phenomenon of entanglement sudden death ,",
    "we assume that the system starts at @xmath1 from a well defined initial entangled state and use the time dependent physical spectrum  @xcite @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the elapsed time after the system was prepared in the entangled state , @xmath5 is the bandwidth of the detector which has its transmission peak at frequency  @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the dipole raising and lowering operators , respectively , of the  @xmath9th atom , @xmath10 are the spontaneous emission decay rates of the atoms , equal to the einstein @xmath11 coefficient for spontaneous emission , and @xmath12 is the collective damping which results from an exchange of photons between the atoms .",
    "the collective damping depends on the separation between the atom and the orientation of the atomic dipole moments with respect to the interatomic axis .",

    "the parameter @xmath13 is a damped oscillatory function of @xmath20 , that varies from @xmath21 for @xmath22 to @xmath23 for @xmath24 .",
    "it can have positive as well as negative values .",
    "we note here that the transient spectrum ( [ e1 ] ) includes effects of a finite bandwidth of the detector . in experimental practice , this implies that our calculations are appropriate to observations involving a spectrometer ( for example , a fabry - perot interferometer ) that analyses the frequency spectrum of the emitted field .    the two - time correlation function , appearing in eq .",

    "we assume that the system we consider is composed of two identical two - level atoms ( qubits ) interacting with a broadband reservoir whose modes are in a squeezed vacuum state .",

    "the parameter @xmath33 stands for the dipole - dipole interaction strength between the atoms  @xcite .",
    "the first line in the effective hamiltonian ( [ eq : heff ] ) describes the coherent evolution between the atoms due to dipole - dipole coupling , the second line describes incoherent damping of the atoms due to the presence of the broadband squeezed vacuum , and the third describes the coherent excitation of the atoms by the squeezed field .",
    "the term @xmath34 appears as an another source of incoherent damping .",
    "it is convenient to study the atomic dynamics in terms of the collective states of the system , which are the eigenstates of the hamiltonian @xmath35 here the dipole - dipole interaction can be viewed as a mixer of the atomic bare states .",
    "it produces collective states that are found by the diagonalization of the hamiltonian  ( [ e6a ] ) : @xmath36 where @xmath37 and  @xmath38 represent the excited and ground state of the @xmath9th atom , respectively . in the basis of the collective states ,",
    "the system is composed of four non - degenerate energy states , shown in fig .",

    "the existence of the maximally entangled states , the symmetric @xmath41 and anti - symmetric @xmath42 states , reflects the presence of the coherent dipole - dipole interaction between the atoms .",
    "since atoms interact with each other , the collective state picture provides a good approach for studying the initial phase problem . in what follows",

    "note that there are no correlations in the transitions between and inside the cascade down channels @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "this property allows as to analyze spectral properties of each of the transitions separately .    to introduce initial - phase spectroscopy",
    ", we first consider a simplified two - atom system , namely the dicke model , in which the transition channel @xmath51 does not participate in the dynamics of the system . as we shall see , this will allow us to describe and characterise initial - phase spectroscopy using analytic methods .",
    "what do we mean by `` initial - phase '' spectroscopy ?",
    "a squeezed vacuum itself depends on the phase @xmath52 , but no phase dependent effects are observed until a reference phase is introduced . usually , the reference phase is provided by a coherent laser field .",
    "an another way to introduce the reference phase is to prepare the system in an entangled state and study the dependence of the evolution on the relative phase  @xmath53 between the initial entangled state and the squeezed vacuum .",
    "this is what we call the `` initial - phase spectroscopy '' that could allow us to study the dependence of the decoherence process on the phase and to identify entangled states that could be prevented from decoherence .",
    "we look for signatures of slowed down or accelerated decoherence in the transient spectrum of the emitted fluorescence  field .",
    "usually , decoherence processes in a given system are studied by analyzing widths of the spectral lines .",
    "they are determined by asymptotic , exponentially decaying correlation functions whose fourier transforms give spectral ( lorentzian ) lines .",
    "a narrowing of the spectral lines below the natural linewidth is interpreted as a stabilization of the quantum fluctuations and hence the reduction of decoherence .",
    "however , the recent studies on entanglement have revealed that some entangled states can decay is a non - exponential way leading to the phenomenon of entanglement sudden death  @xcite .",

    "this is the quantity that brings the phase dependent features into the time evolution of the fluorescence field and its spectral distribution .",
    "it is also interesting to note that the evolution of the populations is insensitive to the dipole - dipole coupling strength  @xmath58 .",

    "however , most important from the point of view of this paper is that there is an additional contribution to the amplitude of the line at @xmath83 from the coherence @xmath84 .",
    "evidently , the two - photon coherence and in particular its dependence on the relative phase can directly affect spontaneous transitions originating from the state @xmath44 .    it is clear from ( [ e16 ] ) that the absence of the peak at @xmath85 results from the absence of the population in the symmetric state .",

    "second , there is a direct transition from @xmath39 to @xmath44 involving a simultaneous absorption of two photons .",
    "the two - photon correlations , the initial and that contained in the squeezed field , cause simultaneous absorption of two photons which results in the direct transfer of population from the ground state @xmath39 to the upper state @xmath44 without populating the intermediate state  @xmath41 . thus , the buildup of the peak at @xmath85 is suppressed .",
    "the dependence on time of the spectral features changes qualitatively when @xmath53 is varied .",
    "a change of @xmath53 from @xmath88 to @xmath89 leads to a hole burning in the higher frequency peak .",

    "[ fig3 ] , where we plot the spectrum for the same parameters as in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] but @xmath90 .",
    "we observe a rapid collapse of the amplitude of the peak at @xmath73 , which then evolves through a hole burning to a narrow peak as time varies from @xmath1 to @xmath91 .",
    "to explain the origin of the hole burning , we illustrate in frame ( b ) the time evolution of the populations @xmath86 and the coherence @xmath87 .",
    "evidently , at time when the hole is burned in the spectrum , the population @xmath82 is almost zero and @xmath87 is negative .",
    "the hole burning , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) and its persistence for only small period of time around @xmath74 can be understood as the result of the destructive interference between the initial and squeezing correlations that oscillate out - of phase when @xmath90  @xcite .",
    "an alternative explanation is as follows . the spectral line at @xmath83 , as seen from eq .",
    "( [ e16 ] ) is composed of two lorentzians of different widths and weights .",
    "each of the weights can be positive or negative depending on the sign of the coherence @xmath87 .",
    "for @xmath92 , the coherence @xmath87 is positive for all time and much larger than the population @xmath82 . in this case , the weight of the broader spectral component with the width , @xmath93 is negative while the weight of the narrower spectral component with the width , @xmath94 , is positive .",
    "mollow  @xcite and rice and carmichael  @xcite pointed out that the negative weight of the broader lorentzian can give rise to a spectrum with subnatural linewidth .",
    "thus , the subtraction of the broader lorentzian from the narrower one results in a narrowing of the spectral line and the reduction of the intensity of the line .",
    "the narrowing of the spectral line is not well visible in fig . 2 , but the reduction of the amplitude , a saddle point near @xmath74 is well visible in the figure .",
    "the situation changes dramatically when one changes the relative phase to @xmath95 . in this case",
    ", @xmath87 is negative for short times so that the narrower lorentzian can now have a negative weight while the broader lorentzian has a positive weight .",
    "thus , for times close to the value which minimizes the weight of the narrower lorentzian , we obtain a hole burned in the spectrum  @xcite .",
    "the enhancement of the spectral peak at @xmath72 reminds us the phenomenon of the dicke superradiant pulse formulation  @xcite . over a short time period ,",
    "the population is transferred to the symmetric ( superradiant ) state and is then emitted with the enhanced , superradiant rate @xmath96 , which is the damping rate of the population of the symmetric state .",
    "the hole burning can be connected with the phenomenon of entanglement sudden death  @xcite . to show this",
    ", we compare the time evolution of the spectrum with the evolution of an initial entanglement between the atoms .",
    "we quantify entanglement by calculating the concurrence , which can be evaluated explicitly from the density operator of the system as  @xcite @xmath97 where the quantities @xmath98 are the eigenvalues in decreasing order of the matrix @xmath99 where @xmath100 denotes the complex conjugate of @xmath101 and @xmath102 is the pauli matrix .",

    "it is easily verified , that with the initial bell state  ( [ e13 ] ) , @xmath113 is always negative , so that a possible entanglement in the system is solely determined by @xmath112 .",
    "figure  [ fig4 ] shows the time evolution of the concurrence for the same choice of parameters as in figs . 2 and 3 .",
    "we see a strong variation in the time evolution of the concurrence with the relative phase @xmath53 .",
    "for the case of @xmath71 , the atoms are entangled for all times with the initial entanglement decaying slowly towards a non - zero steady state value .",
    "the evolution of the initial entanglement is completely different when the phase is changed to @xmath95 . in this case",
    ", the initial entanglement decays in a non - exponential fashion and disappears at a very short time of the evolution . beyond that time",
    ", the atoms remain disentangled for a finite period of time , and then the entanglement reappears again  @xcite , and evolves asymptotically to a steady - state value that is independent of the phase @xmath53",
    ". a close look at the spectrum and the concurrence reveals that the entanglement disappears for the period of time when the hole occurs in the system .",
    "thus , the hole burning in the spectrum can be regarded as a signature of the phenomenon of sudden death of entanglement .",
    "hence , observation of the hole burning in the spectrum would be a striking confirmation of the entanglement sudden death .",
    "we now turn to the problem of phase effects in an extended atomic system .",
    "we relax the small sample approximation and consider dynamics of an extended atomic system , the so - called non - dicke model , where we explicitly take into account a non - zero spatial separation between the atoms .",
    "the separation will act as a phase difference between the oscillating dipoles . as we shall see , this will introduce an additional phase to the dynamics of the system .",
    "in other words , the transient spectrum depends strongly on whether @xmath115 or  @xmath116 .    for phase independent initial states and/or absence of the squeezed field ,",
    "the spectrum of the field emitted from a two - atom system is composed of two peaks , a broad peak of the width @xmath96 due to spontaneous emission from the symmetric state and a narrow peak of the width @xmath117 arising from spontaneous emission from the antisymmetric state  @xcite . in this case , the collective damping imposes quantitative changes to the spectrum by modifying the widths of the spectral lines , but does not lead to spectra which are qualitatively different from those that occur in the absence of the collective damping . here , we show that the inclusion of an initial phase can lead to transient spectra which are quite distinct to those seen in its absence .",
    "the transient spectrum can be found analytically by solving the equations of motion  ( [ e11 ] ) and ( [ e12 ] ) . however , the analytical form of the spectrum is very complicated and difficult to interpret",
    ". therefore , we restrict ourselves here to the graphical illustration of the spectra .    figure  [ fig5](a ) shows the transient spectrum for @xmath71 and @xmath115 .",
    "the spectrum is composed of two asymmetric peaks , whose initial amplitudes decay exponentially in time and attain their stationary values after a short time @xmath118 . the origin of the peaks and their time evolution is easily explained from the analyses of the populations of the collective states , shown in fig .",
    "( [ fig5])(b ) . since @xmath119 and @xmath120 , it is clear that the peaks arise from the @xmath121 and @xmath122 transitions .",
    "however , the spontaneous transitions @xmath123 do not lead to population of the state @xmath41 that remains almost unpopulated for all times .",
    "a transfer of the initial population occurs only from @xmath44 to @xmath42 .",
    "moreover , the transfer of the population to the state @xmath42 occurs on the time scale much shorter than @xmath124 , the time scale required for appreciable changes of the population of @xmath42 to occur , as predicted by the rate equations  ( [ e15 ] ) .",
    "this indicates that the state @xmath42 is populated by stimulated rather than spontaneous emission process .",
    "the situation changes when we switch the relative phase from @xmath88 to @xmath89 . in this case",
    ", a hole burning occurs in the higher frequency peak , and simultaneously the amplitude of the lower frequency peak becomes enhanced .",
    "this is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] , where we plot the spectrum for the same parameters as in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , but with @xmath95 .",
    "the origin of this effect is the same as discussed above for the dicke model .",
    "the explanation again follows from the observation that the destructive interference between the initial two - photon coherence and that induced by the squeezed field leads to spontaneous processes which dominate over the stimulated processes . as the result",
    ", the symmetric state becomes significantly populated on a time scale @xmath125 , which is the time scale for the population of the symmetric state , predicted by the rate equations .",
    "this shows clearly that the phase @xmath53 changes the transient populations of the collective states of the system .",
    "this fact is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig6](b ) , where we show the time evolution of the populations and the two - photon coherence . clearly , at the time when the hole burning occurs , the symmetric state is significantly populated and the states @xmath42 and @xmath44 are essentially completely depopulated .",
    "it is interesting that hole burning can occur not only by changing the relative phase  @xmath53 , but also by changing the sign of @xmath13 .",
    "a change of the sign of @xmath13 from @xmath115 to @xmath116 is achieved by varying the distance between the atoms .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] , where we plot the spectrum for the same parameters as in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , but for @xmath126 .",
    "we see that the sign of the collective damping parameter , which depends on the phase difference between the oscillating atomic dipoles , has a strong impact on the shape of the spectrum .",
    "a change @xmath127 leads to hole burning in the lower frequency peak .",
    "thus , the effect of negative @xmath13 is seen to be the same as the relative phase @xmath95 .",
    "this is a surprising result as one could expect that a change of the sign of @xmath13 would result in a spectrum similar to that as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , but with the peaks exchanged in position .",
    "the changes in the spectral distribution indicate that the phase of the squeezed field is locked to the phase difference between the oscillating dipoles .",
    "we may conclude that the collective damping acts like an artificial tweezer that rotates the phase of the squeezed field .",
    "to say this another way : the squeezed field keeps memory of the relative phase of the atomic dipole moments .",
    "it is not difficult to see that @xmath13 may act as a tweezer of the squeezing phase . this fact is graphically shown in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] , where we plot the transient spectrum for the same parameters as in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] , but for @xmath95 .",
    "when @xmath53 is switched from zero to @xmath89 , the spectrum reverts to a profile similar to that shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5](a ) that the spectrum is composed of two asymmetric peaks .",
    "the role of @xmath13 as a phase shifter is also seen from the solution for the two - photon coherence  @xmath114 .",
    "it is not difficult to show from eq .",
    "( [ e15 ] ) that the long time @xmath128 solution for the two - photon coherence @xmath114 is of the form @xmath129 } , \\label{e23}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath130 is a phase angle with only two discrete values of @xmath131 for @xmath132 and @xmath133 for @xmath116 .",
    "it is clear that a change @xmath127 leads to a shift of the squeezing phase by @xmath89 .",
    "it is also interesting to note that the magnitude of the coherence is proportional to @xmath134 , which indicates that the collective damping @xmath13 can be regarded as an efficiency of the transfer of the two - photon correlations @xmath135 from the squeezed field to the atoms .",
    "finally , we compare the transient spectrum with the transient properties of the concurrence .",
    "figure  [ fig9 ] shows the concurrence @xmath136 as a function of time for the same parameters as in figs .",
    "[ fig5 ] and [ fig7 ] .",
    "the decay time of the initial entanglement depends on @xmath53 .",
    "we observe that similar to the dicke model , the initial entanglement collapses , i.e. disappears over a finite time but , what is surprising , it never revives .",
    "the lack of recurrence of entanglement in the non - dicke system is due to the fact that the presence of the antisymmetric state increases the threshold for entanglement in @xmath137 from @xmath81 to @xmath138 , as seen from eq .",
    "( [ 4.12 ] ) , and decreases the positive term in @xmath139 from  @xmath81 to @xmath140 , as seen from eq .",
    "( [ 4.13 ] ) .",
    "the enhancement of the threshold in  @xmath137 , it turns out , is sufficient to wipe out any entanglement . physically , the lack of the entanglement revival is the result of an imperfect transfer of the two - photon correlations from the squeezed field to the atoms .",
    "it is easy to see from eqs .",
    "( [ e15 ] ) and  ( [ e23 ] ) that the two - photon coherence @xmath114 is proportional to @xmath57 that is smaller than one @xmath141 for the non - dicke model .",
    "we have examined the transient spectrum of the radiation field emitted by a system of two atoms that interact with a broadband squeezed vacuum field and initially prepared in a maximally entangled bell state .",
    "the initial entangled state provides a reference phase for the phase dependent squeezed vacuum field .",
    "we have considered the dicke and non - dicke models .",
    "the non - dicke model explicitly includes a phase difference between the atomic dipole moments .",
    "our calculations have demonstrated the qualitatively new behavior observable in the transient spectrum of a collective system that evolves from an initial entangled state .",
    "it has been found that the effect of the relative phase suppresses one of the two spectral peaks normally expected in transient spectra and enhances the other .",
    "the suppression is seen as a hole burning in the spectral line .",
    "the physical origin of the hole burning has been explained in terms of the destructive interference between the initial and the squeezed field induced two - photon coherence .",
    "the relation between the phases determines whether the population is transferred to the two - excitation energy state or to a single - excitation collective state .",
    "we have also made a comparison of the transient behavior of the spectrum with the time evolution of the initial entanglement and found that the hole burning can be interpreted as a manifestation of the phenomenon of entanglement sudden death .",
    "in addition , we have found that in the case of the non - dicke model , the collective damping rate that can be positive or negative , introduces a phase shift of the phase of the squeezed field . in all cases",
    "we have considered , we have found that a change of the sign of the collective damping results in the hole burning in one of the spectral lines , and the suppression of a given peak determines the state that is selectively populated .",
