    "recently , holographic principle@xcite has attracted a lot of attention in the context of black - hole physics , ads / cft correspondence@xcite and cosmology .",
    "it has been recognised that theories with gravity are endowed with features different from those in the flat space .",
    "this could be realised from the fact that entropy of a black hole is proportional to the area of its horizon according to bekenstein - hawking formula .",
    "the holography proposal states that information for such theories reside on the boundary of the spatial volume with one bit of information per unit planck area .",
    "thus , if @xmath5 is the total entropy of the system enclosed in volume @xmath6 and @xmath7 is the area of the boundary , the holographic bound is given by @xmath8 in suitable units .",
    "this bound is saturated for a black hole .",
    "indeed , for special class of black holes , in the string theory framework , the entropy can be computed microscopically also , hence the saturation of the holographic ratio for this class can be checked from an underlying microscopic theory .",
    "the principle of holography has been examined in the cosmological context by fischler and susskind@xcite .",
    "bekenstein has examined the consequences of the boundedness of @xmath9 in the cosmological scenario@xcite almost a decade ago .",
    "he suggested that the boundedness of the entropy could be utilised as a constraint to circumvent cosmological singularities .",
    "subsequently , there has been considerable interest to study various properties of holography in cosmological situation @xcite .",
    "it is worthwhile to mention that there have been interesting developments to bound the entropy and invoke thermodynamical considerations in the cosmological context .",
    "recently , a hubble entropy bound was envisaged @xcite and cosmological singularties from the string theory view point were analysed@xcite .",
    "therefore the holography principle and generalised second law of thermodynamics in cosmological scenario could be used as additional constraints on cosmological models .",
    "thus , these features have stimulated study of string cosmology from a new perspective . in another development , adopting holography as an additional principle , a holographic covariant description of cosmology was proposed and is being pursued actively @xcite .    the present investigation is a sequel to our previous efforts@xcite to study consequences of holography in the pre - big bang ( pbb ) cosmology .",
    "since string theory describes gravity in a natural manner it is desired that the theory will be able to resolve issues pertaining to physics of black - holes as well as the evolution of the universe . in the pbb scenario @xcite inflation",
    "is recognised to be due to stringy mechanism which has no analogue in the einstein gravity .",
    "it is well known that decelerating , expanding ( frw ) type solution in @xmath10 region can be related to an accelerating and expanding solution for negative @xmath11 through scale - factor duality(sfd ) and time inversion .",
    "thus , the accelerating power law expansion is driven by the kinetic energy term of the dilaton towards singularity whereas the decelerating , expanding ( frw ) type solution for @xmath10 has singularity in the past .",
    "this is the scenario in the so called string frame metric .",
    "it is proposed that a cold , flat , weakly coupled universe proceeds towards a hot , curved and strongly coupled phase and then it goes through graceful exit to the frw - like phase .    in the weak coupling approximation , the tree level string effective action , in cosmological scenario , can be used to describe the evolution of scale - factor , dilaton and other matter fields . however , as one approaches the high curvature , strong coupling regime , this approximation is unlikely to hold .",
    "when one approaches @xmath12 , it is necessary to account for the higher order correction in @xmath13 as well as higher genus correction .",
    "there have been attempts to study cosmological evolution of graviton and dilaton in the presence of classical stringy matter source by several authors . for an early account in the context of pbb scenario",
    "we refer the reader to ref.@xcite . in the string theory , this stringy matter source",
    "is taken care of by a phenomenological source term in the string effective action .",
    "the dynamical equation of such extended objects have interesting features in the presence of time - dependent metric , especially if there is a horizon .",
    "when these objects are well within the horizon , the ratio of pressure and the energy density denoted as @xmath14 is zero and the evolution equation is described by the motion of the center of mass of the string and the oscillatory terms . on the other hand ,",
    "if a string crosses the horizon its dynamical degrees of freedom gets frozen , it increases in size linearly with time and triggers jean s like instability @xcite .",
    "then it is termed unstable string .",
    "when all the strings exceed the size of the horizon in the @xmath15-dimension , @xmath14 becomes @xmath16 . here",
    ", in this paper we will be studying the effect of such stringy sources on the holographic properties in the cosmological context . we shall confine our attention on the pbb scenario , particularly in the pbb phase .",
    "we will see that the effects of this stringy matter sources are felt reasonably only for negative time far away from the singularity .",
    "the organisation of the paper is as follows : in the section ii , we review in detail the isotropic , homogeneous solutions for @xmath4 and @xmath17 .",
    "@xmath14 is zero in the far past ( i.e. at @xmath0 ) and the second case occurs in the recent past i.e. in the vicinity of @xmath18 ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "then in the section iii , we discuss about the models of initial distribution of string sources , consider the relevent iteration procedure to obtain background field configurations from the zeroth order solutions and derive the form of the the holographic ratio that we will be using in the later sections .",
    "subsequently , we use this form to estimate the holographic ratio in the zeroth order and discuss the features associated with finite value of the ratio . in the next section iv , we compute the corrections to the holographic ratio for the power law and exponential distributions and study their properties for the two cases . in the section",
    "v , we estimate the holographic ratio when all the strings cross the horizon in both the string and einstein frames in four dimensional world and explain in some detail the known@xcite procedure of going to the einstein frame . in the following section vi",
    ", we deal with the holographic ratios in the general @xmath19-dimension in both the remote and recent past in the string as well as in the einstein frames .",
    "we end with a discussion in the section vi .",
    "the low energy effective action in the four dimension in the string frame is given by @xcite ^-1s^s=- + s _ where , @xmath20 is the string scale , @xmath21 is the curvature scalar computed in the string frame metric .",
    "@xmath22 is the dilaton .",
    "the string coupling constant , @xmath23 , is defined by the relation @xmath24 . the last term in eqn.(2.1 )",
    "is due to the string source and its effects are treated classically .",
    "the string source part of the action is s_= the corresponding equations of motions are 2(r_^+_^)=2l_s^2e^ t_^ , + r-(_)^2 + 2_^=0 where , t_= is the stress - energy - momentum tensor following the definition of ref.@xcite .",
    "we work in isotropic and homogeneous space , therefore the line element in the string frame metric is ds^2=dt^2-a^2(dx^i)^2 the energy and pressure are defined as follows t_^=(t_0 ^ 0,t_i^i)=(,-p ,- p ,- p ) then equations of motion in time - dependent form @xcite are ^2 - 2 + 3h^2=0 + ^2 - 3h^2=2 l_s^2|e^| + 2(-h)=2 _s^2|pe^| where , the sfd invariant variables are defined as    covariant conservation of stress - energy - momentum tensor takes the form + 3h|p=0 let us now introduce a new dimensionless time parameter @xmath25 , such that @xmath26 ; and define @xmath27 by @xmath28 .",
    "eqn.s ( 2.8)-(2.10 ) on integration reduce to@xcite & = & + & = & - + 2l_s^2|&= & [ ( x+x_0)^2 - 3 ^ 2 ] note that @xmath29 for constant @xmath14 , where @xmath30 and @xmath31 are constants of integration .",
    "obviously , @xmath31 is chosen such that @xmath32 reaches its maximum at @xmath33 .",
    "again , this set of first order eqn.s(2.13)-(2.15 ) can be integrated for constant @xmath14 to give@xcite a&=&a_0|(x - x_+)(x - x_-)|^ ||^ + e^|&=&e^|_0 |(x - x_+)(x - x_-)|^- ||^- + 2l_s^2|&=&e^|_0 |(x - x_+)(x - x_-)|^ ||^- where , = 1 - 3 ^ 2,= , = and x_=[x()-x_0 ( 1 ) ]    now , in the remote past , @xmath4 , so @xmath34 .",
    "let us take @xmath4 to start with and examine the consequences",
    ". then we will get the zeroth order solutions @xcite , which are given below : a&=&a_0||^ + e^|&=&e^_0|(x - x_+)(x - x_-)|^-1 + 2l_s^2|&= & with , @xmath35 .",
    "+ setting x_-=0,x_0=-t , one arrives at@xcite a&=&a_0(1-)^ + e^|&= & + 2 l_s^2|&= & + x&=&^0=t as the universe crosses the time @xmath36 , kinetic energy of the dilaton and the curvature becomes comparable to the source energy density i.e. @xmath37 .",
    "we assume the source energy density per unit comoving volume to be small@xcite .",
    "so it does not affect the initial curvature of the universe .",
    "we note that the solutions(2.23)-(2.25 ) go over to the dilaton driven vaccuum solution in the @xmath12 limit .",
    "moreover , we will see that this solution acts as good string perturbative vaccuum .",
    "in other words , corrections to zeroth order solutions is rather small .",
    "this observation is valid , at least , for very large negative @xmath11 .",
    "let us proceed to discuss about the corrections in the presence of classical string sources .",
    "the length of a string will vary , in principle , from @xmath20 to @xmath38 . at the time",
    "@xmath0 , horizon is of infinite extent .",
    "all the strings are within the horizon",
    ". as time progresses , the horizon shrinks .",
    "so strings also start crossing the horizon , making pressure negative and @xmath14 non - zero .",
    "this non - zero @xmath14 will introduce corrections on the top of the zeroth order solution .",
    "moreover , @xmath14 will be small at the beginning .",
    "= 2.5truecm    untill now we have been discussing solutions in one limit .",
    "now let us consider the background field configurations in another limit , namely when all the strings are outside the horizon and @xmath14 is @xmath39 .",
    "let @xmath18 be the time when @xmath14 approaches @xmath39 .",
    "then @xmath40 is @xmath20 when the mean length of the strings is of the order of @xmath20 .",
    "if the mean length of strings is more , @xmath40 has higher value .",
    "now the critical density parameter @xcite @xmath41 has the following expression , ( x ) = so at @xmath42 or , @xmath43 , @xmath44 goes to zero .",
    "then the string sources become unimportant compared to curvature . the tree level string",
    "effective action is not reliable in this regime .",
    "hence we consider the large @xmath45 limit i.e. @xmath46 , then @xmath47 .",
    "let us denote the corresponding @xmath48 and the ordinary time by @xmath49 and @xmath50 , where the tree level action is reliable .",
    "but at @xmath51 , @xmath14 need not coincide with @xmath39 .",
    "@xmath17 if @xmath52 .",
    "this situation is represented by an arrow in the fig.1 .",
    "now let us assume that the mean length of our string sources is of the order of @xmath53 .",
    "let us also assume that the source energy density to be a reasonable fraction of curvature at that time .",
    "the corresponding field configurations around @xmath49 are @xcite a&=&a_0|(x - x_+)(x - x_-)|^- ||^ + e^|&=&e^|_0 |(x - x_+)(x - x_-)|^- ||^ + 2l_s^2|&=&e^|_0 |(x - x_+)(x - x_-)|^- ||^ where , x_=[x(-1)-x_0(1 ) ] now we set @xmath54 , keep the leading contributions of @xmath25 only and express the background field configurations in terms of ordinary(cosmic ) time .",
    "then the solutions become @xcite a_s(t)=()^-,=_0n-3(),=-3p = _ 0 ( ) with , t_0=a_0 ^ 2()^-1,_0n=_0 - 3 , _",
    "0=. the constants in the eqn.(2.31 ) are related as _ 0e^_0nt_0 ^ 2= so far we have considered solutions in two cases : ( i)@xmath4 and ( ii)@xmath17 . it is important to examine the background field configurations when @xmath14 varies between these two extrema .",
    "this will be dealt with in the following sections .",
    "in this section we look for a simultaneous solution of the background equations of motion and equations of motion for the string sources as @xmath14 decreases from zero to @xmath39 with time proceeding from @xmath55 to @xmath50 .",
    "the nature of the evolution equations are such that we can not get an analytic exact solution for @xmath56 .",
    "therefore we start from the @xmath4 end .",
    "there we have the exact solution for the background fields .",
    "if we put back this solution in the sigma model action to evaluate @xmath14 , we recover the value @xmath4 @xcite , only in the limiting case @xmath57 which is same as @xmath58 .",
    "in other words , our exact solution is not simultaneous solution of background as well as string equations of motions for time not exactly @xmath55 .",
    "moreover , we can not dispense with the position coordinates in the expression for pressure and energy density . to get a simple expression for @xmath14 as a function of time we assume , following gasperini etal @xcite , that the source term represents an ensemble of classical strings",
    ". initially all the strings are within the horizon , hence pressure and @xmath14 are zero .",
    "the two types of initial distribution of the lengths of the strings , we consider , will give different expressions for @xmath14 .",
    "here , first we review the basic elements of the model , then derive the expression for @xmath14 from the model to be used in the iteration procedure , to obtain the background fields .",
    "then we utilize these solutions to evaluate the corresponding holographic ratios and subsequently compare and contrast the features of the two types of distributions .",
    "now let us briefly recapitulate some of the essential features of the model .",
    "for further details we refer the interested reader to the ref.@xcite .",
    "we consider an ensemble of large number , say n , of classical strings .",
    "moreover , let the length of i - th string at an instant of time @xmath11 be @xmath59 , and number density of strings of length @xmath60 at that instant be @xmath61 .",
    "then @xmath62 . here ,",
    "the differential equations satisfied by @xmath59 and @xmath61 are , ^i(t)=h(t)l^i(t)(l^i(t)-d(t ) ) + a_an+_l=0 where , @xmath63 is the hubble length and @xmath64 is the hubble parameter .",
    "the energy density of stable and unstable strings ( i.e. length less or greater than the horizon ) are given by e_s = d^3x _ s = ln(l , a)(d - l)dl + e_u = d^3x_u = ln(l , a)(l - d)dl note that in the far past when all the strings lie within the horizon , @xmath4 and @xmath65 .",
    "on the otherhand , @xmath17 corresponds to the situation @xmath66 .",
    "so , @xmath14 could be approximated by ( t)=- from the definition(3.3 ) it follows that @xmath67 satisfies a differential equation _",
    "u= -d n_-(d ) where , @xmath68 expresses the number density of strings of size of the horizon at time @xmath11 according to the distribution of number density at the far past . note",
    "that this is the differential equation for evaluating @xmath69 at any time and we will be using it again and again . on the contrary , once we assume the form of the distribution of number density at the remote past , @xmath70 can be directly evaluated from the definition(3.2 ) .",
    "so let us discuss the two types of distributions , n_-(l)&=&^2l^-3 , + n_-(l)&=&exp(- ) where , @xmath71 and @xmath72 are related to the total number of strings .",
    "the mean length of a string in the two cases are respectively @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "now for the first type of number distribution @xmath14 goes to @xmath39 as @xmath40 is of the order @xmath20 whereas for the second type @xmath40 can vary .",
    "let us see how this happens a la gasperini etal @xcite .",
    "first we note that when @xmath14 becomes @xmath39 or , almost all strings cross the horizon , @xmath75@xcite , @xmath76 being some negative fraction .",
    "then we find _",
    "u&=&^2 , + _",
    "s&=&^2[(l_s)^-1-h ] , + & = & - so , @xmath14 tends to @xmath39 only when @xmath77 .",
    "let us now consider the exponential distribution .",
    "the differential equation for @xmath69 near @xmath17 yields , _ u = nl_0 ( ) ^whereas , _ s = nl_0[(1+)exp(-)- ( 1+)exp(- ) ] and as a result , = - where , @xmath78 $ ] is incomplete gamma function .",
    "so if @xmath79 is such that it is greater than @xmath80 as well as @xmath81 ( i.e. @xmath82 and @xmath83 ) then @xmath14 becomes @xmath39 at the time @xmath81 for a particular value of @xmath79 , say @xmath84 . on the contrary ,",
    "if @xmath85 then @xmath14 becomes @xmath39 when @xmath86 .",
    "we note here that for the exponential distribution of mean length @xmath20 , @xmath14 falls off faster than that of power law . + again as we are considering the situation almost in the far past i.e. near @xmath87 where the horizon is very large , almost all strings of any size are within the horizon .",
    "it should not matter much whether we take strings of mean length @xmath20 or , larger and we take power law distribution of number of strings or , exponential distribution .",
    "we will see how far this is true in the following .",
    "before we move on to estimate the holographic ratio , let us describe the way we calculate the background fields , the prescriptions for the iterations and how we put the holographic ratio in proper form to compute it at each stage of iteration .",
    "in order to obtain the background field configurations order by order through iteration , it is suitable to use a varaible @xmath88 , instead of @xmath25 , along the line of ref.@xcite . in terms of the variable @xmath89 , eqn.s ( 2.13)-(2.15 )",
    "are rewritten as 2 l_s^2|(y)=()^2 e^_0 [ ( w^)^2-w^2 ] +    w^+w^-w=0 where , @xmath90 is an auxiliary function introduced through the relation x+x_0=-2 our main aim will be to solve the @xmath91 equation using the expression for @xmath27 .",
    "note that putting @xmath4 or , @xmath92 in the differential equation for @xmath91 we get w = e^-_0sinhy we use the expression(3.16 ) for @xmath91 to find the first order corrected @xmath14 .",
    "moreover , for nonconstant @xmath14 , @xmath27 is given by , = ^0+_0^y(x)dy .",
    "let us now explain the procedure for iteration as we carry it out for power law distribution . in that case",
    ", putting the zeroth order expression for @xmath91 we get @xmath14 which involves the parameter @xmath93 .",
    "once we put the first order corrected @xmath14 in the differential equation we obtain @xmath91 corrected to order @xmath93 .",
    "this procedure is repeated to get higher order corrections in @xmath91 . for exponential distribution procedure",
    "is similar . due to the presence of @xmath94",
    ", there is no analog of the parameter @xmath93 ; though at the first sight it might appear that @xmath95 or , @xmath96 can be used as expansion parameter depending on whether @xmath96 is greater or less than one .",
    "there , improvement on the zeroth order result through iteration is relevent in the powers of @xmath89 only .",
    "whatever be the distribution , at each stage we utilize the @xmath91 to evalute the holographic ratio . to achieve that we write the holographic ratio in a proper form .",
    "moreover , let us keep in mind that we are considering the hubble horizon throughout ( we mention in passing that in the remote past the event horizon goes as square root of the hubble horizon and for small time both converge ) .",
    "now in the string frame , @xmath97 , @xmath98 , is time - dependent and is given by@xcite l_p(t)=exp(/2)=l_s exp(/2 ) we have taken @xmath99 to be one in eqn(1.1 ) .",
    "the ratio of entropy contained within the hubble horizon to the horizon area is given by l_p^2(t)&=&l_s^2 exp(| ) + & = & l_s^2 exp(| ) + & = & _s^2 exp(| ) + & = & l_s^2 exp(_0 ) where , @xmath100 is defined to be the temperature .",
    "it follows from the covariant conservation of @xmath101 in the string frame that the time development of string sources is adiabatic .",
    "so @xmath14 changes with time keeping entropy per comoving volume constant . consequently , l_p^2(t)&=&l_s^2 exp(_0 ) + & = & l_s^2 exp(_0 ) + & = & + & = & where,@xmath102 , @xmath103 are factors independent of @xmath89 in @xmath104 , @xmath105 respectively . on the otherhand",
    ", we write @xmath89-dependent factors of @xmath91 and @xmath106 as @xmath107 and @xmath108 .",
    "@xmath109 is the temperature at @xmath110 , or equivalently at @xmath0 .",
    "let us estimate the holographic ratio in the zeroth order .",
    "this comes out as l_p^2(t)= now @xmath109 and @xmath111 are constants . hence the holographic ratio also , in the zeroth order",
    ", is constant , for all time .",
    "so entropy per unit planck area of the horizon is also constant .",
    "it is given by the above expression .",
    "this result is valid when the horizon is finite .",
    "now the same solution describes the universe in the early phase i.e. when @xmath112 or , @xmath113 ; the horizon tends to infinite then .",
    "hence we infer , as a limiting procedure , that the entropy per unit planck area of the horizon is given by the expression(3.20 ) when the universe is flat . since the area is tending to infinity , entropy within the hubble horizon",
    "also must be very large .",
    "as the universe is cold at the begining , it may appear contradictory .",
    "but the energy density per unit comoving voulme is also constant .",
    "hence entropy per comoving volume is constant .",
    "as the number of comoving volumes within the horizon tends to infinity , entropy within the hubble horizon also tends to infinity .",
    "this ratio has good physical implication .",
    "if this zeroth order ratio is one ( as is taken in time @xmath36 in the paper@xcite ) , or , at least bounded from above , then @xmath114 .",
    "again in the pbb cosmology ( i ) @xmath111 which is the duration of dilaton driven phase is very large , ( ii ) @xmath109 , the temperature at the begining of the universe , is very low . hence product , @xmath115 is also a finite number .",
    "so two independent considerations lead to the same conclusion .",
    "recently veneziano has shown@xmath116 that the ratio assumed of the order one , explains the entropy budget of the universe from the pbb cosmology quite accurately upto some numerical factors .",
    "therefore it is quite reasonable to assume that the ratio is of the order one . in other words ,",
    "the universe in the flat beginning seems to show holography as in ads spaces @xcite .",
    "after discussing the features associated with the zeroth order holographic ratio being bounded let us see how the ratio changes with time as the universe evolves from the remote past .",
    "the evolution will depend on the number distribution of strings at the remote past . as a result the holographic ratio will also be getting modified differentially .",
    "now the holographic ratio @xmath117 is roughly @xmath118 . as the universe evolves the first factor increases whereas the second factor decreases .",
    "hence the holographic ratio will increase or decrease depending on whether the relative increament of the first factor is more or less compared to relative decreament of the second factor .",
    "we will see in our study below that in the case of power law distribution the scale factor dominates whereas in the case of exponential distribution it is the coupling constant which initially dominates , though very weakly , for a short interval of time before being overtaken by the scale factor .",
    "let us now first consider the power law distribution , @xmath119@xcite . then equation(3.5 ) becomes _ y_u-_u=^2_yd^-1 and on integration we get , = h+e^y_0^yhe^-y on the otherhand , if we directly evaluate eqn.(3.2 ) we arrive at , = -h hence , in this distribution , the expression for @xmath14 takes the following form , = - where , @xmath64 is the hubble parameter of the universe given by h =    now from eqn.s(3.12)-(3.15 ) we get = ( coshy-1 ) + = ^0(cosechy)^2 where we have used the zeroth order expression for @xmath91 , w = e^-_0sinhyand then substituting eqn.(4.6 ) in eqn.(4.4 ) , we get @xmath14 to order @xmath93 as , = -[coshy - e^y + sinhy]+o()^2 here , integration of the r.h.s . of the expression ( 3.17 ) for @xmath27",
    "is not possible if we keep terms upto all orders in @xmath89 .",
    "so to start with , in the first step of iteration , we keep terms upto @xmath120 , for the sake of simplicity and we get , = ^0 [ 1-y+o(y)^3o()^2 ] where , @xmath121 .",
    "now , in the remote past @xmath89 is small .",
    "so whether @xmath111 is large or small , correction term in the above expression is small compared to one .",
    "zeroth order solution acts as good perturbative vaccuum near the remote past . moreover , if @xmath111 is large , zeroth order solution acts as good perturbative vaccuum for all @xmath89 we mean that for all @xmath89 for which power series converges ] .    to carry on iteration ,",
    "let us assume the @xmath27 obtained in eqn.(4.9 ) to hold good for all orders in @xmath89 .",
    "we put this @xmath27 in the background equation to get @xmath91 with @xmath122 correction , w= e^-_0 ( 1+y)sinhy consequently , & = & ( coshy-1 ) + & = & ^0(cosechy)^2 [ 1-y+sinhy ] then , the model which takes care of string equations of motion , gives = - let us determine @xmath91 to order @xmath123 .",
    "note that when we keep terms upto @xmath124 the expression for @xmath14 does not come with @xmath123 .",
    "retaining terms upto @xmath125 we find , = ^0[1-(y+ + --)+y^5 + o(y)^6o()^3 ] let us use the expression for @xmath27 in the background equations of motion ( 3.12)-(3.14 ) to find the @xmath91 and the corresponding fields upto @xmath123 . assuming that this @xmath27 holds for all order in @xmath89 we get the expression for @xmath91 as in below : w&= & e^-_0 + & & [ [ 1+y]sinhy + + & & + ^2[-coshy ( y + y^2+y^3- y^4 + & & -y^5- y^6 -y^7 + y^8 + & & + y^9 ) + sinhy ( + y + y^2 + & & + y^3+y^4 -y^5- y^6-y^7 + & & -y^8 + y^9 + y^10 ) ] we can use this result to get @xmath14 and @xmath27 for third order or , upto @xmath126 and higher order in @xmath89 .",
    "in other words , this procedure , in principle , could be used to determine higher order terms in @xmath93 .",
    "however , we compute terms upto @xmath123 .",
    "now , we can use the first and second order expressions for @xmath91 to estimate the holographic ratio .",
    "let us evaluate the holographic ratio for the first order i.e. including the @xmath93 correction l_p^2(t)= ( 1+y ) the holographic ratio in the second order(i.e .",
    "when we include terms upto @xmath123 ) is l_p^2(t)&= & + & & [ 1-(y++ -- + & & -sinhy ) + & & -^2[-- - - + & & - -+ + & & + + - - + & & - + & & -(1601280 + 1000320 y+358080y^2 + 9312y^3 + & & -41344y^4 - 12888y^5 - 1500y^6 + 504y^7 + 147y^8 ) + & & + ( -2y - y^2 --+ + + & & + -- ) + & & + ( + + - + & & --+ + ) ] ] we observe that coefficient of @xmath93 in the above equation(4.17 ) is of opposite sign compared to that of first order eqn.(4.16 ) .",
    "this sign difference arises due to the following reason . in obtaining the expression(4.9 ) for @xmath27",
    "we have kept terms , upto @xmath127 .",
    "but while calculating @xmath91 , eqn.(4.10 ) , we have kept terms upto all orders in @xmath89 .",
    "then we have used this expression ( 4.10 ) for @xmath91 in the holographic formula .",
    "it gives rise to the apparent discrepency .",
    "if we had strictly kept terms upto @xmath127 , coefficient of @xmath93 would have been absent in the first order holographic ratio .",
    "again in the second order formula(4.17 ) there is no term in the coefficient of @xmath93 upto @xmath120 .",
    "hence the second order result is consistent with the first order one .",
    "moreover , if we had kept terms in the expression for @xmath91 upto @xmath125 , strictly , the holographic ratio with @xmath123 correction would have contained terms upto @xmath128 . now in the expression for the holographic ratio(4.17 ) , coefficient of @xmath93 decreases and that of @xmath123 increases with @xmath89 , if terms upto @xmath128 are considered",
    ". this feature will be manifest from the plots below . again as a next step , if we go on to consider the third order in @xmath93 , to start with we have to keep terms higher order than @xmath129 in the expression for @xmath27 . and this will not change the coefficients of terms upto @xmath129 in the expression for @xmath91 and the coefficients of terms upto @xmath130 in the expression for holographic ratio . hence ,",
    "we conclude , that as the universe evolves form @xmath0 , the holographic ratio decreases , at least upto the time terms from @xmath131 onwards are negligible .",
    "+ the plots of the coefficients of @xmath93 and @xmath123 in the holographic ratio , for small values of @xmath89 , are shown in fig . 2 and 3 respectively .",
    "= 5truecm    = 5truecm    we observe from the plots that the coefficient of @xmath93 decreases whereas the coefficient of @xmath123 increases .",
    "note that in both the cases the coefficients are indeed small . as a result",
    "the net holographic ratio decreases as stated in the previous paragraph .",
    "after discussing all about the power law distribution , let us go over to the second case , namely exponential one .",
    "the differential equation satisfied by @xmath69 for the exponential distribution takes the form , _",
    "y_u-_u= -n_yd exp(- ) which on integration gives , _ u = nl_0[exp(-)-exp(y)_0^y _ y(exp(-y))exp(-)dy ] since , @xmath132 upto order of @xmath127 we get , = -exp(- ) use of the eqn.(3.17 ) leads to = ^0 [ 1-(- ( erf()-1 ) ) ] where , @xmath133 is the error function@xcite . now to iterate we assume that the expression(4.21 ) for @xmath27 to be correct to all order in @xmath89 .",
    "we use this @xmath27 in the differential equation(3.14 ) and obtain @xmath91 . here , we keep terms upto @xmath129 in the expression for @xmath91 and get w = exp(-_0)[sinh(y)+c(y ) ] where , @xmath134 is given by c(y)&=&sinh(y ) + & & -cosh(y ) + & & where , @xmath135 is the exponential integral function @xcite",
    ".    then the holographic ratio becomes , l_p^2(t)= [ 1+cor(y ) ] with @xmath136 is given by , cor(y)&=&exp(-)[+ -- + & & + + -+- + & & + -+ -+ + & & -+ coth(y)(1-+ - ) + & & -cosh(y)cosech(y ) ( + ) ] + & & -exp(-)[- + + - + & & -- + + + + + & & - + + -]sinh(y ) + & & -cosh(y)[exp(- ) ( + - + & & -+ --+ + & & -- --- + & & -- ) + ( 1-)(1-erf ( ) ) ] + & & + ( coth(y ) expintegralei(- ) ) to see how the holographic ratio changes with @xmath89 , we plot the correction to ratio against @xmath89 for f equal to 10 in figure 4 .",
    ":    = 5truecm    we note that the holographic ratio , in this case , deviates slightly upward from the zeroth order result .",
    "let us check that this deviation is not spurious .",
    "for this purpose we plot the correction to holographic ratio for @xmath91 upto @xmath120 order also .",
    "we get an identical looking curve .",
    "we recall that we have kept terms upto @xmath120 in the expression for @xmath64 .",
    "this means that the region of @xmath89 taken in the plot is the region where higher order terms are negligible compared to @xmath120 .",
    "hence this little upward deviation from the zeroth order result will remain if we go to higher order in @xmath89 .",
    "actually this little upward deviation is generic of exponential distribution .",
    "again , to come to this conclusion , we plot the ratio for @xmath137 .",
    "this is shown in the figure 5 :    = 5truecm    we see that the domain of the initial plataue or , rectangular shaped region in the above figure , @xmath138 , shifts with respect to the previous plot , @xmath139 , to slightly larger value of @xmath89 .",
    "hence we infer that if we go on decreasing @xmath96 to @xmath93 this nature of the curve will remain , only the domain of the curve will shift to larger value of @xmath89 .",
    "this plataue occurs due to first order correction .",
    "so the initial rise will remain if we include the higher order corrections also .",
    "note the magnitude of smallness in the initial rise in the holographic ratio .",
    "we mention in passing that for @xmath17 solution to be valid , @xmath140 has to be much greater than @xmath141 but less than one , as @xmath142 .",
    "uptill now we were concentrating on how the holographic ratio evolves over small time interval near the remote past . in this regime ,",
    "only few strings cross the horizon .",
    "perturbative techniques are useful also .",
    "but we do nt have an easy way to study the holographic behaviour when , arbitrary number of strings say , half of the total number of strings are more than the size of the horizon .",
    "obvious possibility is to go to the other extreme i.e. when all the strings became nondynamical .",
    "this is what we are going to do in the next section .",
    "the holographic ratio is given by ( for @xmath17 or , @xmath143 ) l_p^2(t)= ( ) ^- where , @xmath144 is the temperature at the time @xmath145 .",
    "so the holographic ratio at the time @xmath51 is given by @xmath146 .",
    "hence the ratio of the holographic ratios , denoted by @xmath147 , at the time @xmath50 and @xmath55 is = ( ) ^ where we have used the constancy of comoving volume entropy . now assuming that the holographic ratio is one at the remote past we find that the ratio at the time @xmath50 is also one provided the parameters of the theory @xmath148 and @xmath149 are constrained by the relation @xmath150 .",
    "note that @xmath111 is larger than @xmath53 ( see the fig.1 ) .",
    "* comparison with the einstein frame ratio *    let us study another feature of the holographic ratio .",
    "this is whether the holographic ratio is the same in both the string and einstein frames . in the pbb cosmology ,",
    "qualitative features of the universe like blue shift , shrinking of the horizon etc .",
    "@xcite are same in both the frames .",
    "so the question whether similarly the holographic ratio is equal in the two frames motivates us to study the corresponding ratio in the einstein frame .",
    "the metrics in the einstein frame and the string frame are related by the following conformal transformation 8g^s_=e^-_0g^e _ @xmath151 is the present day value of the dilaton and we set @xmath152 .",
    "then if we remain in the synchronous gauge i.e. if we set ds_e^2=dt_e^2-a_e^2(dx^i)^2 we get dt_e&=&e^-(-_0)dt + a_e(t_e)&=&e^-(-_0)a(t ) + ^s_e(t_e)&= & ^s(t ) as , @xmath153 @xcite . in the einstein frame",
    "the equations of motion satisfied by the fields are r_^ -r g_^&=&t_^_^&=&(t^s)_^ where , in the above , @xmath154 and @xmath155 is the stress - energy tensor corresponding to the dilaton .",
    "these equations of motions have been derived from an action @xmath156 which in turn has been obtained from the effective action in the string frame by conformal transformation and is given as ^-1s^e=- + + s _ where , s_= e^. after this short preliminary about the conversion of string frame to einstein frame in @xmath157-dimension , let us proceed to compute the ratio in the einstein frame corresponding to @xmath17 in the string frame .",
    "we note that in the einstein frame@xcite , a_e(t_e)&= & ( ) ^ + ( t_e)&=&_0n- ( ) + ^s(t_e)&= & where , in the above , @xmath158 is the energy density of the string source in the einstein frame and @xmath159 is the present day value of the planck length . again in the einstein frame , the dilaton also contributes to the energy density and the pressure .",
    "consequently , the net eneregy density and the pressure in the einstein frame are = , p= the effective equation of state is p = the holographic ratio turns out to be l_p^2&=&l_p^2 + & = & l_p^2 + & = & where , @xmath160 is the temperature at the time @xmath161 .",
    "now , the string frame time and the einstein frame time are related by t_0&=&e^t_0e + -t&=&e^(t_0e)^ ( -t_e)^ we get , = e^ ( ) ^- as a result the ratio , in the two frames eqn.(5.1 ) and eqn.(5.16 ) have exactly the same time dependences . again",
    "the entropy per comoving volume is the same in both the string and the einstein frames . hence _",
    "t_cl^e = e^ _ t_cl where , @xmath162 and @xmath151 is the present day value of the dilaton . therefore the holographic ratios in both the frames are exactly the same .",
    "uptill now we have been in @xmath157-dimension , came across nice features like constancy of holographic ratio in the remote past , identical ratio in the string and einstein frames in the recent past , i.e .",
    "@xmath163 . let us now move on to diverse dimensions looking for the similar interesting features .",
    "here we write down the string effective action in @xmath15-dimension and the equations of motions derived from it .",
    "the effective action in @xmath15-dimension is ^-1s^s=- + s _ the resulting equations of motions @xcite are ^2 - 2 + mh^2 + nf^2&=&0 + ^2-mh^2-nf^2&=&2l_s^d-1| e^| + 2(-h)&=&2 _s^d-1|pe^| + 2(-f)&=&2 _s^d-1|qe^| first let us keep in mind that we are writing @xmath164 , where , ( i ) @xmath165 is the number of expanding spatial dimensions and ( ii ) @xmath166 is the number of contracting spatial dimensions in the string frame .",
    "scale factor of a contracting dimension will be denoted as @xmath167 and it will be just reciprocal of @xmath168 .",
    "this is the only posssibility compatible with non - zero energy density @xcite . here ,",
    "now onwards we will be confining ourselves to consider mainly time dependences of quantities .",
    "moreover we will look into the following aspects , ( i ) whether the holographic ratio is constant or , not in different dimensions in the remote past , ( ii ) whether the holographic ratios in the remote past are the same in both the string and the einstein frames in @xmath157 as well as in the diverse dimensions and ( iii ) how the time dependences of the holographic ratios in the recent past , in the string frame , go together with the corresponding ones in the einstein frames in various dimensions .",
    "let us now start with the case when we have nine isotropically expanding dimensions .",
    "then we have@xcite after solving the above set(6.2 ) of equations as in the @xmath157-dimensional case with @xmath169 , a&=&a_0(1-)^ + e^|&= & +    @xmath97 , is given by , ( l_p^10)^2= g_s^l_s^2=e^l_s^2 so , the holographic ratio is given by , ( l_p^10)^8&=&l_s^8 + & = & where , @xmath170 is a numerical factor coming through @xmath171 and @xmath172 is the temperature in the remote past .",
    "next let us consider the case when three dimensions are expanding and six other dimensions are contracting . then , observing that equations of motions in terms of sfd invariant variables remain same as in the previous case , we get a_ex&=&a_0ex|1-|^ + a_con&=&a_ex^-1 + e^|&= & +    expanding case .",
    "so , the holographic ratio ( l_p^10)^8=l_s^8 again , the ratio of the hubble volume to hubble area is given by & = & + & = & ( t-2 t ) where , @xmath173 and @xmath174 are the hubble parameters of the expanding and the contracting dimensions . consequently , ( l_p^10)^8= therefore , we see , in both the cases as @xmath11 tends to @xmath55 , the holographic ratio becomes constant as in the @xmath157-dimension .",
    "let us examine whether this happens in any arbitrary dimensions .",
    "we note that for @xmath15-dimensional world , a_ex&=&a_0ex(1-)^ + e^|&= & +    @xmath175 limit ( i.e. @xmath176 ) we have l_p^d-1(t ) & ~ & + & ~ & + & ~ & |t|^0    again , in the @xmath15-dimension , the einstein frame scale factor and time are related to the string frame ones@xcite as a_e(t_e)&=&e^- a(t ) +    large @xmath175 limit , in terms of the string frame time is expressed as a_e(t_e)= |t|^ note that in this limit the universe is isotropic even if in the string frame it is mixed isotropic . in @xmath157-dimension , in particular",
    ", the equation of state is p= then we arrive at the following holographic ratio in the einstein frame , in the @xmath15-dimension l_p^d-1 ~ || ~|t_e|^ ~|t|^-1 where , @xmath177 corresponds to the time in the einstein frame .",
    "so the time dependences of the holographic ratios in the two frames in this large @xmath175 limit do not match in any dimension .",
    "but we have seen that in the recent past the ratio is same in both the frames in the four dimension .",
    "therefore , let us check , in the recent past , whether in arbitrary dimensions time dependences of the holographic ratio match in both the frame .",
    "now in the @xmath15-dimensional spacetime near the time @xmath50 , @xmath1 and the relevent field configurations , namely the scale factor of the expanding dimension and the sfd invariant dilaton@xcite are a(t)&=&|t|^- +    becomes l_p^d-1 ~|t|^ but now the einstein frame time @xmath178 is related to the string frame time by |t_e|~|t|^1 + and the scale factors in the einstein frame , corresponding to the expanding and contracting dimensions in the string frame , are a_em(t_e)~|t_e|^2 ~|t|^-2 + a_en(t_e)~|t_e|^2 ~|t|^2 consequently , the corresponding ratio in the einstein frame in terms of the string time is given by l_p^d-1 ~|t|^ hence in the recent past the holographic ratios in the two frames have the same time dependences in all dimensions .",
    "we note here that time dependences of holographic ratio as in eqn.(6 ) was arrived at@xcite from different consideration .",
    "in this paper , we have set out to compute the holographic ratio .",
    "first , we obtained the holographic ratio in the zeroth order and discussed the implication of the ratio to be bounded .",
    "then for the power law distribution , we obtained the correction to the ratio in the first and second order in @xmath93 following an iteration procedure .",
    "we found that the correction depletes the ratio , albeit by small amount .",
    "for the exponential distribution , the correction increases the value of the ratio by very small amount ( @xmath179 ) , towards the beginning of evolution , over a small range of time .",
    "this is due to the domination of coupling constant over scale factor during that period .",
    "again , we computed the ratio in the other extreme , when all the strings crossed the horizon , assuming the mean length of the classical strings is much larger than @xmath20 .",
    "we then showed that the holographic ratio , has the same time dependences in both the string and einstein frames in this limit , and taking care of all the factors in one particular case , namely in the four dimension we found that the ratio is identical .",
    "this gives another evidence that qualitatively the two frames are equivalent in the pbb cosmology and hubble horizon is a good choice in both the frames . on the other hand , in the remote past",
    "the ratio in the string frame is constant in all dimensions .",
    "however , in the einstein frame , it goes as inverse of the string time .",
    "the ratio is different in the two frames .",
    "we have checked that solutions obtained by conformal trasformation do satisfy the equations of motions in the einstein frame in this limit when coupling constant goes to zero .",
    "we may mention that if one follows the proposal of ref@xcite , then also one gets the corresponding holographic ratio which is inversely proportional to the string time .",
    "thus we find that the holographic ratio in the remote past is not on similar footing as other physical quantities .",
    "we have studied the holographic behaviour in the presence of string sources almost in two extreme cases in @xmath157-dimensions .",
    "it is possible to generalise the exercise of getting the correction by iterative procedure to @xmath15-dimension .",
    "again , we applied pertubative method to go away from the extremality ( @xmath4 )",
    ". it will be very interesting to study the holographic ratio explicitly in the intermediate region .",
    "it is also desirable to see how the zeroth order holographic ratio gets modified in presence of higher dimensional branes .",
    "moreover it is very much of relevence to ask about the mechanism of holography in this case .",
    "we have benifitted from discussions with professors r. brustein , m. gasperini and especially with professor a. sen .",
    "we are grateful to professor g. veneziano for many valuable discussions at various stages of the work and this investigation is outcome of his suggestions to explore consequences of holography in presence of the string sources .",
