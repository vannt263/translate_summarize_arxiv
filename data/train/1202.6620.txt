    "the first decade of experiments at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) has established the existence of a strongly coupled quark - gluon plasma ( sqgp ) , a new state of nuclear matter with partonic degrees of freedom .",
    "one of the major goals of heavy - ion collision experiments right now is to explore the qcd phase diagram .",
    "the recent beam energy scan ( bes ) program @xcite at rhic is motivated by searching for the phase boundary between normal nuclear matter and sqgp as well as for the theoretically predicted qcd critical point @xcite . the bes program at rhic together with pb+pb collisions at the large hadron collider ( lhc )",
    "provide us with a unique opportunity to study systematically the collision energy dependence of relativistic heavy - ion collision observables .",
    "the study of collective flow in relativistic heavy ion collisions has the potential to offer insights into properties of the produced matter .",
    "anisotropic flows , especially the elliptic flow @xmath9 , are widely studied in heavy - ion collisions . in the mid - rapidity region ,",
    "the dependence of elliptic flow on transverse momentum and collision energy are crucial for our understanding of the properties of sqgp .",
    "elliptic flow can provide information about the specific shear viscosity , which controls the conversion efficiency of anisotropic spatial pressure gradients to momentum anisotropies in a hydrodynamic description , and about the equation of state of the matter created at early times @xcite .",
    "recent measurements of higher order anisotropic flow coefficients , @xmath12 have generated strong interest due to their ability to provide additional constraints on initial conditions @xcite .",
    "in @xcite the collision energy dependence of particle transverse momentum spectra and elliptic flow coefficients were studied using ( 2 + 1)-d ideal hydrodynamics with longitudinal boost invariance and a bag - model equation of state . in this work",
    ", we revisit this problem using more realistic ( 2 + 1)-d viscous hydrodynamics coupled with a modern lattice qcd based equation of state @xcite .",
    "we also study the differences between the two most popular initial conditions obtained from monte carlo versions of the glauber ( mc - glauber ) and kharzeev - levin - nardi ( mc - kln ) models @xcite .",
    "our work has some limitations which must be kept in mind before comparing them with experimental data . as the collision energy decreases ,",
    "the bjorken assumption of longitudinal boost invariance will gradually break down @xcite .",
    "furthermore , since the fireball will spend less time in the qgp phase , the hadronic phase becomes more important and occupies a larger part in its dynamical history .",
    "curing these two major shortcomings will require ( 3 + 1)-d viscous hydrodynamic simulations @xcite coupled with a microscopic hadronic afterburner @xcite .",
    "the present work does not aim at extracting precise information of qgp transport properties from a comparison with experimental data .",
    "its main purpose is to expose systematic quantitative trends in observables as a function of collision energy in the relativistic heavy - ion collisions .    in the next section",
    ", we will describe the setup of our models and discuss our parametrization of the initial conditions as a function of @xmath5 . in sec iii",
    ", we will present trends for the transverse momentum spectra and differential elliptic flow for charged hadrons as @xmath5 increases from 7.7@xmath1gev to 2760@xmath1gev .",

    "based on this generalized formulation , we perform a shape analysis on the final kinetic freeze - out surface and study the dependence of the final eccentricity on @xmath5 . sec .",
    "vi is devoted to some concluding remarks .",
    "in this work , we employ the ( 2 + 1)-dimensional viscous hydrodynamic model vish2 + 1 which implements boost - invariance in the longitudinal direction @xcite . similar to past work @xcite",
    ", we use two different types of initializations taken from the mc - glauber and mc - kln models to generate initial entropy density profiles .",
    "over one million monte carlo events are generated and sorted into collision centrality bins according to their number of participant nucleons .",
    "each event is re - centered to the beam axis and rotated in the transverse plane such that its minor axis aligns with the impact parameter .",
    "then we average the events to obtain a smooth average initial entropy density for each centrality bin .    in the mc - glauber",
    "runs we take for the specific shear viscosity the value @xmath3 since this value was shown in @xcite to provide a reasonable description of the charged hadron @xmath13 and @xmath14 data measured by the rhic and the lhc experiments @xcite .",
    "for the initial entropy density we make the two - component ansatz @xmath15 with a wounded nucleon ( wn ) to binary collision ( bc ) mixing ratio @xmath16 that is adjusted to reproduce the measured centrality dependence of the final charged hadron multiplicity density @xmath17 . for pb+pb collisions at",

    "[ fig7 ] we show the differential elliptic flow of @xmath28 and @xmath29 for @xmath0 to @xmath30@xmath1gev . for pions , the differential @xmath9 varies with @xmath5 very similarly to the total charged hadron elliptic flow shown in figs .",
    "[ fig3]b , d . for protons the strong radial flow `` blueshifts '' the entire elliptic flow to higher @xmath8 .",
    "so for higher collision energies , the values of @xmath9 are smaller in the low @xmath8-region and larger in the high-@xmath8 region .",
    "we find that below 200@xmath1gev the proton @xmath13 at low @xmath8 is almost independent of @xmath5 . at lhc energy , on the other hand , the blueshift is really dramatic , reflecting the much stronger radial flow at this high collision energy .",
    "the total charged hadron elliptic flow is the combination of contributions from light pions and less abundant heavy particles .",
    "since with increasing collision energy the elliptic flow of heavy particles decreases at low @xmath8 , they effectively cancel the weak increase of the light pion @xmath9 .",
    "this results in the apparent saturation of charged hadron differential elliptic flow over a wide @xmath8 range from @xmath31-@xmath30@xmath1gev that was seen in fig .",
    "[ fig3]b for mc - glauber model . for the mc - kln model , this cancellation is less efficient because the increase with @xmath5 of the pion @xmath9 is stronger ( see fig .",
    "[ fig7]c , d ) .",
    "therefore , for the mc - kln model the total charged hadron elliptic flow keeps increasing as the collision energy increases .",
    "we conclude this paper by presenting a novel shape analysis of the evolving fireball .",
    "theoretically , the spatial eccentricity @xmath10 is conventionally defined at fixed proper time @xmath32 by @xmath33 the weight function @xmath34 is the energy density in the laboratory frame . can also be used as weight function for calculating the eccentricity .",
    "the authors of @xcite concluded from a study of fluctuating initial conditions that these two definitions yield initial spatial eccentricities that are linearly related to each other although the actual values are slightly different . ]",
    "since the measured hadrons are only emitted from the final kinetic freeze - out surface , experimentalists can only infer the shape of that surface , by exploiting two - particle momentum correlations among the emitted particles and their dependence on the azimuthal angle around the beam axis @xcite . for comparison with such experimentally determined final source eccentricities @xcite",
    ", a more meaningful theoretical quantity would be the spatial eccentricity of the final freeze - out surface @xmath35 , @xmath36 instead of a constant proper time surface . in eq .",
    "( [ eq5 ] ) @xmath37 is the flow velocity on the surface @xmath35 , and we used the fact that for our eos an isothermal freeze - out surface is also a surface of constant local energy or entropy density , and that therefore the weight functions @xmath38 or @xmath39 cancel between numerator and denominator . by a constant proper time surface , the definition ( [ eq5 ] ) reduces to eq .",
    "( [ eq4 ] ) for longitudinally boost - invariant systems . ]",
    "thus the spatial eccentricity ( [ eq5 ] ) defined on an isothermal surface is independent of whether we weight @xmath10 with energy or entropy density .",
    "-dependence of the final spatial eccentricity @xmath40 of the isothermal kinetic freeze - out surface at @xmath41mev , for 10 - 30% centrality .",
    "the initial eccentricity is 0.26 for the mc - glauber model and 0.32 for the mc - kln model .",
    "the experimental points indicate preliminary data @xcite from an azimuthal hbt analysis by the star collaboration . ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] , we show the final eccentricity calculated along the kinetic freeze - out surface , @xmath42mev , as a function of collision energy . for both mc - glauber and mc - kln models , as the collision energy increases , the final spatial eccentricity @xmath40 decreases monotonically .",
    "this is because at higher collision energy the system lives longer , giving the fireball more time to decompress and ( due to anisotropic flow ) become less deformed . for sufficiently large initial energy density",
    ", the fireball has actually enough time to become elongated along the reaction plane , instead of its original elongation perpendicular to it @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] we compare our results with recent ( preliminary ) star data from an azimuthal hbt analysis @xcite .",
    "mc - glauber runs with @xmath43 quantitatively reproduce the data at @xmath44gev while underpredicting the final eccentricity by @xmath4510% at lower energies .",
    "mc - kln initial conditions with @xmath46 result in 15 - 20% larger final eccentricities than both the mc - glauber runs and the star data , due to the @xmath4520% larger initial eccentricities of the mc - kln profiles . in table  [ table1 ] we see that , at the same @xmath5 , the fireball lifetimes with mc - kln and mc - glauber initial conditions are very similar . in spite of the faster evolution of radial flow for the mc - kln initial conditions , the larger initial eccentricity in the mc - kln model is preserved all the way to the end of the hydrodynamic evolution . extending our calculations to lhc energy",
    "we predict that @xmath40 will approach zero around @xmath47 - 5.5@xmath1tev . again",
    ", this is a result of the longer fireball lifetime at lhc energies . for even larger @xmath5",
    ", @xmath40 will turn negative , in qualitative agreement with previous calculations in @xcite using ideal fluid dynamics and a less realistic eos .",
    "contrary to our present work , the authors of @xcite calculated the azimuthal hbt radii from the cooper - frye output of their hydrodynamic simulations",
    ". in future work we will calibrate our definition ( [ eq5 ] ) for @xmath40 against the final eccentricity value extracted from azimuthal oscillations of hbt radii . here",
    "we only note that an azimuthal hbt analysis at lhc energy will help to further test predictions from the viscous hydrodynamic model .",
    "the careful reader may have noticed that there is a small kink at @xmath48@xmath1gev in the slopes of the solid and dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] and earlier in figs .",
    "[ fig3 ] and [ fig4 ] .",
    "unfortunately , this is not a phase transition signature but rather an artifact from our normalization of the initial energy density profile to experimentally measured final charged multiplicity data for @xmath49@xmath1gev and to the empirical formula eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) for @xmath50@xmath1gev . at @xmath21@xmath1gev",
    "the experimentally measured @xmath17 is @xmath51 smaller than the value obtained from eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) .",
    "if we use eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) instead of the measured value to normalize our initial energy density profiles at @xmath21@xmath1gev , the fireball lifetime increases slightly , decreasing the final eccentricity by a few precent and removing the kink in the theoretical curves .",
    "the origin of an apparently similar kink in the star data which happens to occur ( we believe : accidentally ) also around @xmath52gev deserves further study .",
    "using ( 2 + 1)-dimensional viscous hydrodynamics with properly implemented hadronic chemical freeze - out at @xmath53mev , we have studied systematically the evolution of hydrodynamic observables with collision energy in the range @xmath54gev . over this range of energies , the initial peak temperature almost doubles and the fireball lifetime increases by about 60% .",
    "we find that for temperature independent specific shear viscosity the mc - glauber model shows almost perfect  multiplicity - scaling \" of the eccentricity - scaled charged hadron elliptic flow . for the mc - kln model this",
    "scaling is broken : as @xmath5 increases , the @xmath55 vs. @xmath56 curves shift to the right ( fig .",
    "[ fig2]b ) .",
    "we found that this breaking of multiplicity scaling in the mc - kln model originates from a steeper centrality dependence of the nuclear overlap area .    for both initialization models ,",
    "higher collision energies generate stronger radial flow which results in flatter hadron spectra and a corresponding increase of the mean @xmath8 of charged hadrons . for the mc - glauber model we observed an approximate  saturation \" of the charged hadron differential elliptic flow at fixed @xmath8 in the region @xmath57@xmath1gev , similar to what is observed experimentally .",
    "we believe , however , that the word  saturation \" describes the observations incorrectly and that what is seen is better described as a very broad maximum ( as a function of @xmath5 ) of the differential elliptic flow at fixed @xmath8 , caused by the interplay of ( i ) growing total momentum anisotropy ( which increases @xmath9 ) and increasing radial flow ( which decreases @xmath9 at fixed @xmath8 by shifting it to larger @xmath8 ) , and ( ii ) increasing @xmath13 for pions and decreasing @xmath13 for kaons , protons and other heavy hadrons between rhic and lhc energies .",
    "the mechanism ( i ) causes maxima of @xmath13 at fixed @xmath8 for all hadron species , but located at lower @xmath5 values for heavier than for lighter hadrons ( due to the mass - dependence of radial flow effects on the @xmath8-spectra ) .",
    "the mechanism ( ii ) ensures that the maximum for all charged hadrons is broader in @xmath5 than for each hadron species individually and thus manifests itself as a broad plateau that ( for @xmath43 ) happens to span the collision energy range from upper rhic to lhc energies .",
    "the position in @xmath5 of the maximum of @xmath13 at fixed @xmath8 for each hadron species depends on the viscosity of the fluid ( which controls the interplay in the development of radial and elliptic flow during the fireball expansion ) and increases with @xmath58 . for mc - kln initial conditions , which require @xmath452.5 times larger @xmath58 for a successful description of elliptic flow data at rhic and lhc ,",
    "@xmath59 at fixed @xmath8 has not yet reached its maximal value even at lhc energies .",
    "finally , we have proposed an improved measure for the final fireball eccentricity at kinetic freeze - out and studied its evolution with collision energy .",
    "it is found to decrease monotonically with increasing collision energy , at a rate that is roughly consistent with recent experimental measurements .",
    "its absolute value agrees with the data better for the mc - glauber than for the mc - kln model ",
    "the @xmath4520% larger initial eccentricities of the mc - kln profiles yield final freeze - out eccentricities that again appear to be @xmath4520% larger than those from mc - glauber initial profiles , and lie significantly above the measured values .",
    "neither model describes the available data perfectly ; in view of the limitations of the purely hydrodynamic approach employed here ( _ cf . _ our discussion in the introduction ) this is not too surprising .",
    "the model predicts , however , robustly that at top rhic energies the final freeze - out source is still out - of - plane elongated ( as experimentally observed ) , but that at lhc energies the final eccentricity should approach zero .",
    "measurements that test this prediction should soon become available .",

    "<S> using a ( 2 + 1)-d viscous hydrodynamical model , we study the dependence of flow observables on the collision energy ranging from @xmath0@xmath1gev at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) to @xmath2@xmath1gev at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) . with a realistic equation of state , glauber model initial conditions and a small specific shear viscosity @xmath3 , the differential charged hadron elliptic flow @xmath4 is found to exhibit a very broad maximum as a function of @xmath5 around top rhic energy , rendering it almost independent of collision energy for @xmath6@xmath1gev . </S>",
    "<S> compared to ideal fluid dynamical simulations , this  saturation \" of elliptic flow is shifted to higher collision energies by shear viscous effects . for color - glass motivated mc - kln initial conditions , which require a larger shear viscosity @xmath7 to reproduce the measured elliptic flow , a similar  saturation \" is not observed up to lhc energies , except for very low @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> we emphasize that this  saturation \" of the elliptic flow is not associated with the qcd phase transition , but arises from the interplay between radial and elliptic flow which shifts with @xmath5 depending on the fluid s viscosity and leads to a subtle cancellation between increasing contributions from light and decreasing contributions from heavy particles to @xmath9 in the @xmath5 range where @xmath4 at fixed @xmath8 is maximal . by generalizing the definition of spatial eccentricity @xmath10 to isothermal hyper - surfaces </S>",
    "<S> , we calculate @xmath10 on the kinetic freeze - out surface at different collision energies . </S>",
    "<S> up to top rhic energy , @xmath11@xmath1gev , the fireball is still out - of - plane deformed at freeze out , while at lhc energy the final spatial eccentricity is predicted to approach zero . </S>"
