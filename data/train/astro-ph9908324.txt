    "some of the recent chemical evolution models of galaxies have successfully included the dust content ( wang 1991 ; lisenfeld & ferrara 1998 ; dwek 1998 ; hirashita 1999a , hereafter h99 ) .",
    "takagi , arimoto , & vanseviius ( 1999 ) modeled the dust extinction in ultraviolet ( uv)optical wavelengths and the reprocessed light in the far - infrared ( fir ) region , presenting the spectral evolution in the uv  fir wavelengths .",
    "as to the dust formation , supernovae ( sne ) are known to be one of the most dominant sources ( barlow 1978 ; draine & salpeter 1979 ; dwek & scalo 1980 ) , and sn shocks destroy grains ( mckee et al .",
    "1987 ; jones et al .  1994 ; borkowski & dwek 1995 ) .",
    "thus , dust content is connected with star formation histories . in our previous work ,",
    "h99 , the dust - to - gas mass ratio was expressed as a non - linear function of metallicity , which is also related to star formation histories ( see also lisenfeld & ferrara 1998 ) .",
    "h99 confirmed the suggestion proposed by dwek ( 1998 ) that the accretion process onto preexisting dust grains is efficient in spiral galaxies .",
    "this is also supported by the observations of elemental depletions in dense clouds ( e.g , draine 1990 ) .",
    "since the accretion is effective in cold clouds , the global efficiency of the accretion depends on the fractional mass of the cold gas ( seab 1987 ; mckee 1989 ; draine 1990 ; hirashita 1999b ) .",
    "thus , the efficiency varies on a timescale of the phase transition of the interstellar medium ( ism ; @xmath0 yr ; ikeuchi 1988 ; mckee 1989 ) .",
    "mckee & ostriker ( 1977 ) constructed a standard model for the ism composed of three phases : the hot rarefied gas ( @xmath2 k and @xmath3 @xmath4 ) , the warm gas ( @xmath5 k and @xmath6 @xmath4 ) , and the cold cloud ( @xmath7 k and @xmath8 @xmath4 ) .",
    "one of the simplest models for the mass exchange among the three ism phases is described by ikeuchi & tomita ( 1983 , hereafter it83 ; see also habe , ikeuchi & tanaka 1981 ) .",
    "they included the following three processes : [ 1 ] the sweeping of a warm gas into a cold component , [ 2 ] the evaporation of cold clouds embedded in a hot gas , and [ 3 ] the radiative cooling of a hot gas by collisions with a warm gas .",
    "mass fraction of each component can show an oscillatory behavior , which is known as a limit - cycle ( nicolis & prigogine 1977 ; see also fujimoto & ikeuchi 1984 for another modeling of interstellar gas ) .",
    "the limit - cycle behavior is supported by kamaya & takeuchi ( 1997 , hereafter kt97 ) , who interpreted the various level of the star formation activities in spiral galaxies shown by tomita , tomita , & sait ( 1996 ) using the limit - cycle model .    in the limit - cycle model by it83 , mass fraction of each phase",
    "oscillates continuously because of the mass exchange among the three components of the ism ( see also korchagin , ryabtsev , & vorobyov 1994 ) .",
    "the timescale of the phase transition in the model is determined by three timescales of the above physical processes [ 1][3 ] .",
    "actually , a static solution as well as the limit - cycle solution for the mass fractions is possible for some range in the parameter space ( this case is also examined in this paper ) . however",
    ", the oscillatory behavior ( i.e. , the limit - cycle model ) of the fractional masses is supported observationally .",
    "indeed , the observed scatter of the fir - to - optical flux ratios of spiral galaxies ( tomita , tomita , & sait 1996 ) is interpreted through the limit - cycle model in kt97 , who suggested that the fractional mass of the cold phase changes in the range of 0.1 to 0.7 ( or more ) on the timescale of @xmath9 yr and that this leads to the time variation of star formation activities if the schmidt law ( schmidt 1959 ) is applicable .",
    "hirashita ( 1999b ) combined the framework of h99 with a theoretical work on multiphase ism and suggested the time variation of the dust - to - gas ratio by the phase transition .",
    "we aim at constructing a model of the time evolution of dust - to - gas ratio including the effect of the ism phase transition .",
    "the model in this paper enables us to simulate the time variation of the dust - to - gas ratio in a galaxy .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "first of all , in the next section , a model for the time variation of the dust - to - gas ratio is presented .",
    "next , we show the numerical solution of the model in  3 . in  4 , we discuss the solution and present observational implications . finally ,  5",
    "is devoted to summary .",
    "first , we prepare a model for the time variation of the dust - to - gas ratio in a galaxy .",
    "the model is developed by h99 ( see also lisenfeld & ferrara 1998 and dwek 1998 ) in order to account for the relation between metallicity and dust - to - gas ratio of nearby spiral galaxies .",
    "he adopted a simple one - zone model ( i.e. , the galaxy is treated as a closed system and spatial variations of physical quantities within the galaxy is neglected ) .",
    "the model equations describe the changing rate of th mass of gas , metal , and dust : @xmath10 here , @xmath11 is the mass of gas ; @xmath12 and @xmath13 denote the total mass of the metal @xmath14 ( @xmath15 , c , si , mg , fe , etc . ) in both gas and dust phases , and only in the dust phase , respectively . the star formation rate is denoted by @xmath16 ; @xmath17 is the total injection rate of mass from stars ; @xmath18 is the mass fraction of the element @xmath14 ( i.e. , @xmath19 ) ; @xmath20 is the total injection rate of element @xmath14 from stars ; @xmath21 is the mass fraction of the element @xmath14 locked up in dust ( i.e. , @xmath22 ) .",
    "the meanings of the other parameters in the above equations are as follows : @xmath23 represents the dust mass fraction in the injected material ( in other words , the dust condensation efficiency in the ejecta such as stellar winds or sne ) ; @xmath24 refers to the efficiency of dust destruction during a star formation [ @xmath25 corresponds to destruction of only the dust incorporated into the star , and @xmath26 corresponds to a net destruction ( formation ) in the star formation ] ; @xmath27 is the accretion timescale of the element @xmath14 onto preexisting dust grains in molecular clouds ; @xmath28 is the timescale of dust destruction by sn shocks .",
    "we hereafter assume that only dust incorporated into stars is destroyed when the stars form ; i.e. , @xmath25 .",
    "the mass loss from the galaxy is neglected in this paper , since we mainly treat spiral galaxies and expect that outflows are prevented by their deep dark matter potentials ( habe & ikeuchi 1980 ) .",
    "when we consider star burst phase ( habe & ikeuchi 1980 ) or dwarf galaxies ( mac low & ferrara 1999 ) , the outflows may be important for the dust content as well as gas and metal content ( lisenfeld & ferrara 1998 ) .",
    "we adopt the instantaneous recycling approximation ( i.e. , a star with the mass larger than @xmath29 dies instantaneously after its birth , leaving the remnant of mass @xmath30 ) .",
    "once the initial mass function is fixed , we can calculate the returned fraction of the mass from formed stars ( @xmath31 ) and the mass fraction of the element @xmath14 that is newly produced and ejected by stars ( @xmath32 ) . using @xmath31 and @xmath32 , @xmath17 and @xmath20 in equations ( [ basic1])([basic3 ] )",
    "is written as ( see h99 for the details ) @xmath33 after some algebra , equations ( [ basic2 ] ) and ( [ basic3 ] ) becomes @xmath34 { \\cal d}_i,\\label{basic6}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath35 ( timescale of gas consumption ; e.g. , roberts 1963 ) , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 .",
    "the timescales above are estimated in the case of typical spiral galaxies as @xmath3910 gyr ( kennicutt , tamblyn , & congdon 1994 ) , and @xmath40 yr ( draine 1990 ) .",
    "the two timescales , @xmath27 and @xmath28 depend on the phase of the ism where the dust exists ( draine 1990 ; hirashita 1999b ) .",
    "the accretion timescale , @xmath27 , is shorter in the cold phase of the ism than in any other phase , since efficient accretion needs a dense environment .",
    "if we express the growth timescale of a dust grain in the cold component as @xmath41 , the accretion timescale is expressed as @xmath42 , where @xmath43 represents the mass fraction of the cold phase to the total mass of ism ( hirashita 1999b ) .",
    "this is equivalent to @xmath44 where @xmath45 . according to draine ( 1990 ) , @xmath46 yr in the cold gas .",
    "the destruction timescale of the dust @xmath47 is kept constant for simplicity , since we would like to concentrate on the time variation of the dust growth efficiency to examine the result in hirashita ( 1999b ) .",
    "the star formation history should be taken into account in order to model the time dependence of @xmath47 . moreover",
    ", the time variation of the sn rate also contributes to the time variation of the fractional masses the three ism components .",
    "because of such complexities in the time dependence of @xmath47 , we simply treat @xmath47 as constant .",
    "next , we review the model by it83 . this model is used to calculate the time evolution of the filling factors of the three ism phases ( see also  1 ) .",
    "the result is used to calculate the dust formation efficiency through equation ( [ tacc ] ) .",
    "the interstellar medium is assumed to consist of three components ( mckee & ostriker 1977 ) ; the hot rarefied gas ( @xmath2 k , @xmath3 @xmath4 ) , the warm gas ( @xmath5 k , @xmath6 @xmath4 ) , and the cold cloud ( @xmath7 k , @xmath8 @xmath4 ) .",
    "the fractional masses of the three components are @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath43 , respectively .",
    "a trivial relation is @xmath50 the following three processes are considered ( see it83 for the details ) : [ 1 ] the sweeping of a warm gas into a cold component at the rate of @xmath51 ( @xmath52 yr@xmath53 ) ; [ 2 ] the evaporation of cold clouds embedded in a hot gas at the rate of @xmath54 ( @xmath55@xmath56 yr@xmath53 ) ; [ 3 ] the radiative cooling of a hot gas through collisions with a warm gas at the rate of @xmath57 ( @xmath58@xmath59 yr@xmath53 )",
    ". writing down the rate equations and using equation ( [ trivial ] ) , we obtain @xmath60 where @xmath61 , @xmath62 , and @xmath63 .",
    "the solutions of equations ( [ cold ] ) and ( [ hot ] ) are classified into the following three types ( it83 ) :    [ 1 ] @xmath64 ; all the orbits in the @xmath65-plane reduce to the node ( 0 , 1 ) ,    [ 2 ] @xmath66 and @xmath67 ; all the orbits reduce to a stable focus @xmath68 $ ] ,    [ 3 ] @xmath66 and @xmath69 ; all the orbits converge on a limit - cycle orbit ,    where @xmath70 . as a representative parameter sets for [ 1 ] and [ 2 ] ,",
    "we examine @xmath71 and @xmath72 , respectively ( denoted as models 1 and 2 in table 1 , respectively ) .",
    "we especially concentrate on the case [ 3 ] , since we treat spiral galaxies with cold gas and with various levels of star formation activities ( e.g. , tomita et al .",
    "the two properties of spiral galaxies are naturally realized ( kt97 ) if the filling factor of the cold gas shows the limit - cycle behavior and the star formation rate changes according to the schmidt law ( @xmath73 ; @xmath742 ; schmidt 1959 ) . as representative parameter sets of the limit - cycle orbit",
    ", we examine the case of @xmath75 and @xmath76 ( denoted by model 3 and 4 in table 1 , respectively ) .",
    "as explained in  2.3 ( model 3a , 3b , 4a , and 4b ) . ]",
    "the cycle periods of the former case is about three times shorter than that of the latter .    in table 1 ,",
    "the adopted parameters are summarized .",
    "the column `` type '' means the behavior of the solutions and named `` runaway , '' `` stationary '' and `` limit - cycle '' for the cases [ 1 ] , [ 2 ] and [ 3 ] , respectively .",
    "we note that all the parameter sets above are examined in it83 ( their figures 1 and 3 ) .      here , we summarize the equations and the parameters .",
    "first , the filling factor of the cold gas is calculated by the following set of equations : @xmath77 with parameters @xmath78 and @xmath79 listed in table 1 . according to these equations , the time variation of the cold - gas fractional mass @xmath43 is calculated to obtain the efficiency of the heavy - element accretion onto dust grains ( eq .  [ tacc ] ) .",
    "next , the time variation of the dust - to - gas ratio is simultaneously solved .",
    "since we are interested in a timescale much shorter than @xmath80 , which is also interpreted as metal - production timescale through equation ( [ basic5 ] ) , we treat @xmath18 as constants .",
    "then , equation ( [ basic6 ] ) is solved for oxygen abundance ( @xmath15 , because we adopted the oxygen as a tracer element in the previous work , h99 : see also lisenfeld & ferrara 1998 ) : @xmath81 { \\cal d}_{\\rm o},\\label{basic7}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we express the time in a nondimensional manner by using @xmath82 and we assume @xmath25 ( equivalent to the assumption that only dust incorporated into stars is destroyed in the star formation processes ;  2.1 ) .",
    "we note the relation @xmath83 .",
    "we fix the parameters as @xmath84 yr ( e.g. , kennicutt et al .  1994 ) ,",
    "@xmath85 ( h99 ) , @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 ( corresponding to @xmath89 yr ; we note that @xmath90 and @xmath91 are related through eq .",
    "[ tacc ] ) , @xmath92 ( h99 ) , and @xmath93 ( the solar system abundance ) .",
    "the dependence on these parameters above are described in lisenfeld & ferrara ( 1998 ) , h99 , and hirashita ( 1999c ) except for @xmath94 and @xmath80 .",
    "the parameter @xmath94 scales the phase transition timescale , and we examine the cases of @xmath95 and 1000 ( table 1 : @xmath96@xmath97 yr ; it83 ) .",
    "we note that @xmath94 appears in the form of the nondimensional parameter @xmath98 .",
    "we examine only the case of @xmath95 in model 1 and 2 , since the qualitative behavior of the dust - to - gas ratio is the same , irrespective of which value of @xmath98 is adopted .",
    "finally , the total dust - to - gas ratio @xmath99 is calculated from the following equation : @xmath100 where we assume @xmath101 ( the galactic value ; whittet 1992 , p.  52 ) .",
    "we solve the basic equations ( [ basic8])([conversion ] ) for the parameters listed in table 1 .",
    "the initial condition for the filling factors are set according to it83 : @xmath102 except for the model 4 and @xmath103 for model 4 .",
    "the initial dust - to - gas ratio is set as @xmath104 ( galactic value ; whittet 1992 ) for all the models .",
    "models 3 and 4 are examined for two different values of @xmath94 listed in table 1 .",
    "first , the result of model 1 is displayed in figure 1 .",
    "because the cold gas disappears , the dust growth becomes ineffective .",
    "then the dust destruction makes the dust - to - gas ratio converge to @xmath1 in the dust destruction timescale ( @xmath105 yr , i.e. , 10 in the unit of @xmath106 ) .",
    "this model represents the efficient sweeping of warm gas in comparison with the radiative cooling of the hot gas .",
    "thus , the swept gas is first converted into the cold component and then into hot gas ( it83 ) . if the hot gas escapes out of the galaxy owing to its large thermal energy , this model corresponds to the galactic wind model of elliptical galaxies ( it83 ; arimoto & yoshii 1987 ) .",
    "the final value of the dust - to - gas ratio in model 1 is calculated by considering a stationary state , @xmath107 , in equation ( [ basic7 ] ) : @xmath108 because of the constant dust formation from metal injection at the rate of @xmath109 , the dust - to - gas ratio is not exactly 0 even after a long time . since @xmath110 , @xmath111 .",
    "thus , the solution of equation([stationary ] ) is @xmath112 for the adopted parameters @xmath93 , @xmath113 , @xmath86 , @xmath114 , and @xmath92 .",
    "this indeed matches the final value of the dust - to - gas ratio in model 1 .",
    "next , the result of model 2 is presented in figure 2 .",
    "as shown in it83 , the solution for @xmath43 reduces to a stable point @xmath115 .",
    "the stable stationary state is realized at a finite dust - to - gas ratio , which is determined so that the dust formation rate is balanced with the dust destruction rate .",
    "the value is calculated from equation ( [ basic7 ] ) .",
    "putting the adopted parameters , the positive solution is @xmath116 , which matches the stationary value in figure 2 .",
    "finally , the limit - cycle case is examined in figure 3 and 4 .",
    "the four sets of parameters listed in table 1 are examined ( models 3a , 3b , 4a , and 4b ) .",
    "the resulting time evolution of the cold component of ism and the dust - to - gas ratio is presented in figures 3a , 3b , 4a , and 4b for the four cases .",
    "as expected , the dust - to - gas ratio oscillates in response to the fractional mass of the cold component , though the amplitude of the variation largely depends on the parameters . comparing the figures 3a and 4a ( or figures 3b and 4b )",
    ", we see that the amplitude becomes larger if the period of the oscillation is longer .",
    "this is because the dust has enough time to grow if the period is long . also from the comparison between the figures 3a and 3b ( or figures 4a and 4b )",
    ", we find that the smaller @xmath94 makes the amplitude larger .",
    "since small @xmath94 means that a timestep of the phase transition model ( eqs .  [ cold ] and [ hot ] ) is long in the real time unit ( @xmath117 corresponds to @xmath118 ) , the dust has enough time to grow in the case of smaller @xmath94 .",
    "the timescale of the dust growth relative to that of the phase transition determines the amplitude .",
    "this point is again discussed in the next section .",
    "in the runaway and stationary solutions ( models 1 and 2 ) , the dust - to - gas ratio is settled into a stationary value determined by equation ( [ stationary ] ) after the dust formation and destruction timescales ( @xmath119 yr ) . in the limit - cycle type solutions ( models 3 and 4 ) , the amplitude of the dust - to - gas oscillation largely depends on the timescale of the phase transition . in this subsection",
    ", we discuss the phase - transition and dust - formation timescales in the limit - cycle model .    from the solution of the model equations in the previous section ( figs .  3 and 4 ) , we find that the dust - to - gas ratio oscillates in response to the filling factor of the cold component",
    ". however , the amplitude of the oscillation is highly dependent on the values of the parameters @xmath78 , @xmath79 , and @xmath94 .",
    "in other words , the amplitude is determined by the relation between the timescale of the phase transition ( or the period of the oscillation ) and that of the dust growth timescale . in the following ,",
    "we discuss the relation between the the period of the phase transition ( denoted by @xmath120 ) and the dust growth timescale ( @xmath41 ) .    in order for the dust to grow ,",
    "the dust must have enough time for the growth , i.e. , @xmath121 . by using equation ( [ tacc ] ) ,",
    "the condition is equivalent to @xmath122 which reads the following inequality by using @xmath90 : @xmath123 putting @xmath88 and @xmath124 , we obtain @xmath125 for the enough dust growth , which realizes the large amplitude of the time variation of the dust - to - gas ratio .",
    "this means that the timescale of the phase transition should be larger than @xmath126 yr for the sufficient dust growth , since @xmath127 gyr ( kennicutt et al .",
    "1994 ) . here",
    ", we note that the timestep in figures 3 and 4 is @xmath106 in the physical unit and that @xmath96@xmath97 yr . in the longer unit ( @xmath128 yr ; corresponding to figures 3a and 4a ) , the amplitude of the dust - to - gas - ratio oscillation is large . on the contrary , in the shorter unit ( @xmath96 yr ; corresponding to figures 3b and 4b ) ,",
    "the amplitude is much smaller because the timestep is shorter and thus the condition ( [ cond1 ] ) is difficult to be satisfied . moreover , comparing figures 3a and 4a , we see that the amplitude is larger if the period is longer .    in figure 4a ,",
    "the maximum of the dust - to - gas ratio is an order of magnitude larger than the minimum .",
    "thus , the dust - to - gas ratio in spiral galaxies can show an order - of - magnitude oscillation .",
    "we should note that the parameter range is reasonable for the spiral galaxies ( ikeuchi 1988 ) .",
    "thus , we have confirmed the interpretation of the scatter of the dust - to - gas ratio in hirashita ( 1999b ) , who interpreted the scatter of the dust - to - gas ratio of the nearby spiral sample as the short - term ( @xmath129@xmath130-yr ) variation of the dust - to - gas ratio with the maximum - to - minimum ratio of more than 4 .",
    "the important point is that the dust - to - gas - ratio oscillation with large amplitude occurs in a reasonable parameter range for spiral galaxies ( model 4a ) .",
    "however , the amplitudes are small for the other models after the stable limit cycle is attained .",
    "thus , some spiral galaxies may not experience the prominent oscillation of the dust - to - gas ratio .",
    "but it is possible for the spiral galaxies to experience the oscillation of the dust - to - gas ratio , which is observed in the scatter of the dust - to - gas ratio of the spiral sample .      in the discussions above",
    ", the metallicity was fixed because the timescale of the phase transition is much shorter than that of the chemical enrichment",
    ". however , the time range shown in the figures in this paper ( 250 timesteps ) corresponds to 7.5 gyr when the @xmath95 is adopted .",
    "thus , we need to examine the effect of the chemical evolution here .    to include the effect of chemical evolution",
    ", we solve equation ( [ basic5 ] ) to examine the time variation of metallicity .",
    "if @xmath80 is fixed for simplicity , the solution of equation ( [ basic5 ] ) becomes @xmath131 in other words , we simply assume a constant rate of metal enrichment to examine a effect of the chemical evolution qualitatively .",
    "we solve basic equations in  2.3 for the time - variable @xmath132 described by equation ( [ varx ] ) . as a representative case",
    ", we adopt the parameter set identical to model 4a in table1 , since the oscillation behavior of the dust - to - gas ratio is the most prominent ( figure 4a ) . the result is shown in figure 5 .",
    "we see that the qualitative behavior of the dust - to - gas ratio is the same as the results for constant metallicity , except for the gradual increase of dust - to - gas ratio .",
    "this increase is due to the metal production , from which dust is formed .",
    "thus , two behaviors of the temporal variation is coupled : one is the gradual increase of the dust - to - gas ratio on the timescale of chemical enrichment , and the other is the short - term variation of the dust - to - gas ratio owing to the ism phase changes .",
    "we note that the effect of chemical evolution is of significant importance if @xmath133 timescale of the chemical enrichment ) is short . especially for starburst galaxies , @xmath134 yr , which is comparable to @xmath120 ( moorwood 1996 ) . in this case",
    ", the metal enrichment also proceeds from the starburst in @xmath80 , and thus the assumption of the constant metallicity is never satisfied . the same discussion",
    "may also be applied to the initial burst in the formation epoch of galaxies , when @xmath80 is nearly the value of starburst galaxies ( @xmath119 yr ; the dynamical time ) .",
    "we have shown that the dust - to - gas ratio varies on a timescale of the ism phase transition ( @xmath129@xmath130 yr ) in spiral galaxies .",
    "the amplitude of the variation can be an order of magnitude ( figs .",
    "this confirms the previous suggestion in hirashita ( 1999b ) that the dust - to - gas ratio scatter of the nearby spiral galaxies are explained by the time variation .",
    "the result also suggests that the variation is partially responsible for the scatter of the fir - to - optical flux ratio of spiral sample in tomita , tomita , & sait ( 1996 ) , since the dust content as well as the stellar heating ( dust temperature ) is responsible for the far - infrared luminosity ( e.g. , whittet 1992 , p.  170 ) .",
    "we comment on the dust content in dwarf galaxies .",
    "lisenfeld & ferrara ( 1998 ) modeled the time evolution of the dust amount in star - forming dwarf galaxies ( dwarf irregular galaxies and blue compact dwarf galaxies ) . based on their model and considering the dust formation in cold clouds ( dwek 1998 ) , hirashita ( 1999c ) presented that the dust growth in dwarf galaxies is negligible compared with the dust condensation from metal ejected by stars .",
    "this is because the metallicity of dwarf galaxies are much smaller than that of spiral galaxies and the collision between grains and metal atoms are not frequent enough for efficienct growth of the grains .",
    "thus , the oscillation of dust - to - gas ratio through the variation of the dust growth efficiency is difficult in dwarf galaxies . in this case",
    "the scatter of the dust - to - gas ratio of the dwarf sample may be interpreted to reflect the various efficiency of the gas outflow ( lisenfeld & ferrara 1998 ) .",
    "the wind may easily blows out of the dwarf galaxies because of their shallow gravitational potentials ( larson 1974 ; de young & heckman 1994 ) , though the distribution of dark matter largely affects the process of the outflow ( mac low & ferrara 1999 ; ferrara & tolstoy 1999 ) .",
    "we should note that the timescale of the phase transition in dwarf galaxies is expected to be longer because of their longer cooling timescale . since the metal - line cooling is the dominant cooling mechanism for the hot gas ( raymond , cox , & smith 1976 ) , the small metallicity of dwarf galaxies , typically @xmath135 of the spiral galaxies , makes the cooling time an order of magnitude longer ( @xmath136 yr ) .",
    "thus , once the hot component becomes dominant in a dwarf galaxy , the dwarf galaxy must wait for the hot component to cool down for more than @xmath130 yr , during which the growth of dust grains is prevented .",
    "this as well as the mechanism in the previous paragraph makes the dust growth difficult .",
    "indeed , the dust - to - gas ratios in dwarf galaxies are known to be much smaller than those in spiral galaxies ( e.g. , gondhalekar et al .",
    "we have discussed the time evolution of dust - to - gas mass ratio in the context of multi - phase model of interstellar medium in spiral galaxies .",
    "the phase transition of interstellar gas occurs on a timescale of @xmath129@xmath130 yr in spiral galaxies ( it83 ) .",
    "the dust growth rate also varies on that timescale owing to the time variation of the fractional mass of the cold gas through the phase transition ( hirashita 1999b ;  2.1 of this paper ) . in order to examine the response of the dust - to - gas ratio to the phase transition , we modeled the time variation of the dust - to - gas ratio with a model of the phase transition .",
    "we adopt the three phase model for the interstellar gas and the ikeuchi - tomita model for the phase transition . according to the model , three types of solutions",
