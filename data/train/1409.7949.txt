    "the observations of stellar oscillations carried out by the corot @xcite and _ kepler _",
    "@xcite missions have revolutionized asteroseismology , by providing extensive photometric data of high quality for a large number and great variety of stars .",
    "this includes a very substantial number of stars showing solar - like oscillations , i.e. , modes that are intrinsically damped and excited stochastically by vigorous near - surface convection .",
    "a particularly interesting case are the red - giant stars , representing late evolutionary phases of low- and moderate mass - stars ( see , for example , @xcite for a general overview of stellar evolution ; for a detailed discussion of the properties of red giants , see @xcite ) . after completing central hydrogen fusion stars evolve towards",
    "lower effective temperature @xmath0 , before ascending the red - giant branch ( rgb ) with increasing luminosity and nearly constant @xmath0 .",
    "this evolution is driven by the formation of a helium core whose mass grows through the continued hydrogen fusion in a shell around the core , while the core radius decreases .",
    "this is accompanied by a strong increase in the surface radius .",
    "when the temperature in the core becomes sufficiently high , fusion of helium to carbon and oxygen sets in . for stars of mass lower than around @xmath1 the pressure in the inert helium core is dominated by degenerate electrons and helium fusion starts as a run - away process , the so - called helium flash , leading to a complex and poorly modelled evolution , before the star settles down to quiescent helium fusion . for higher - mass stars",
    "the core is non - degenerate , and helium fusion starts in a more regular fashion .",
    "the ignition of helium leads to an expansion of the core and a corresponding contraction of the envelope , decreasing the surface radius and hence the luminosity , with a slight increase in @xmath0 . in both cases",
    "the hydrogen - fusing shell outside the helium core continues to contribute a substantial fraction of the total surface luminosity .",
    "stars in the core helium - fusion phase are often referred to as ` clump ' stars , from the location of such stars in the so - called ` red clump ' in colour - magnitude diagrams of open clusters . for field stars , as opposed to cluster stars , it is very difficult to distinguish between rgb and clump stars based just on their observed surface properties , given the scatter induced , e.g. , by differences in metallicity . to ascertain the diagnostic potential of the observed oscillations it is necessary to consider the properties of the observed oscillation modes ( for a detailed discussion of these properties and asteroseismic diagnostics , see",
    "* ) . in red giants",
    "the compact core gives rise to a very high local gravitational acceleration and hence buoyancy frequency in the deep interior of the star .",
    "for non - radial modes , with spherical - harmonic degree @xmath2 greater than 0 , this leads to a dense spectrum of trapped internal gravity waves , or g modes , in the core . in the envelope the modes",
    "behave as acoustic waves , or p modes .",
    "thus all non - radial modes have a mixed character , with g - mode behaviour in the core and p - mode behaviour in the envelope . at certain frequencies",
    "there is a resonance with the acoustic behaviour in the envelope , leading to modes of predominantly p - mode character , with larger amplitudes in the envelope than in the core . owing to their lower inertia",
    "such modes are easier to excite by the near - surface convection and hence are generally more visible in the observations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . to these non - radial modes",
    "must be added the spherically symmetric , or radial , modes with @xmath3 which are of purely acoustic character .",
    "a major early breakthrough from the corot observations of red giants was the identification of non - radial acoustically dominated modes @xcite .",
    "remarkably , this was soon followed by the detection of additional modes of degree @xmath4 with a substantial g - mode component @xcite .",
    "such modes are characterized by the period spacing between adjacent modes , which is determined by the buoyancy frequency in the deep interior of the star and hence provides a diagnostics of conditions in the core . as a very important result it was shown by @xcite and @xcite that the period spacing is substantially higher in clump stars than in rgb stars , providing a first clear observational separation , applicable to individual stars , between these two classes .",
    "this obviously requires a clear observational identification of the g - dominated modes .",
    "such an identification has been possible on the basis of observations over several years that were obtained during the nominal _ kepler _ mission ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , the shorter duration of the observations in the k2 extension of _ kepler _ @xcite and for the tess mission @xcite makes unlikely a detailed analysis of g - dominated modes .",
    "here we concentrate on the acoustically dominated modes which , as mentioned above , are probably those that are most easily observable .",
    "acoustic modes satisfy an approximate asymptotic relation which can be written @xmath5 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , where @xmath6 is the cyclic frequency of the mode of radial order @xmath7 and degree @xmath2 .",
    "the separation between modes of the same degree and adjacent order ( the so - called large frequency separation ) is approximately given by @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the adiabatic sound speed and the integral is over distance @xmath10 to the centre of the star , extending to a suitable value @xmath11 near the surface of the star . in equation ( [ eq : pasymp ] )",
    "@xmath12 is a phase which , as extensively discussed below , depends on frequency and is probably predominantly determined by the properties of the near - surface layers of the star , and @xmath13 is a small correction .",
    "this expression can relatively simply be derived for main - sequence stars where @xmath13 provides a useful diagnostic of the evolutionary stage ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the applicability of equation ( [ eq : pasymp ] ) to red giants is perhaps less obvious , in the light of their compact core , but is clearly shown both by stellar models and by observations of red giants ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , leading to the introduction of the so - called ` universal pattern ' ( @xcite ; see , however , @xcite ) .",
    "it follows from simple homology relations that @xmath14 scales as the square root of the mean density of the star , @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "thus determination of @xmath14 from observations provides a strong constraint on the global properties of the star , although corrections to this scaling may be required , as discussed , e.g. , by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "however , as a result of the frequency dependence of @xmath12 the actual separation between adjacent modes , @xmath16 \\ ; , \\label{eq : freqsep}\\ ] ] in general differs from the asymptotic separation @xmath14 .",
    "this must be taken into account when the scaling relation ( [ eq : dnuscale ] ) is applied to values of @xmath14 estimated from the observed frequencies .",
    "on the other hand , the frequency dependence of @xmath17 provides diagnostics of the outer layers of the star , including the envelope helium abundance ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "a second important global asteroseismic diagnostics is the frequency @xmath18 where the power density is maximum .",
    "this can be determined relatively accurately by fitting , e.g. , a gaussian to the envelope of power .",
    "it has been found observationally ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , with some theoretical support @xcite , that @xmath18 scales as the acoustic cut - off frequency in the stellar atmosphere , leading to @xmath19 where @xmath0 is the effective temperature .",
    "given an observational determination of @xmath0 the radius and mass of a star can be determined from observed values of @xmath14 and @xmath18 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite emphasized the ambiguity of the observational determination of @xmath14 , depending on the selection of modes actually observed , and argued that this might hide significant dependencies of the inferred global asteroseismic parameters .",
    "they noted that the large - scale variation of @xmath12 , reflected in the curvature of the ridges in an chelle diagram , quite generally appears to have a local extremum near @xmath18 and hence proposed to base the analysis on just a few radial modes in the vicinity of @xmath18 .",
    "this has the added advantage that these modes may be expected to be the most visible .",
    "specifically , they chose the radial mode , with order @xmath20 , closest to @xmath18 , and defined the large separation by @xmath21 from this they also obtained , as a measure of the phase @xmath12 , @xmath22 kallinger et al .",
    "used this procedure to analyse a large number of red - giant stars for which the evolutionary phases ( rgb or clump ) were already known from their mixed - mode period spacings .",
    "they presented their results in a @xmath23 diagram .",
    "interestingly , they found evidence for a distinction in @xmath24 between clump and rgb stars at fixed @xmath25 , proposing the use of @xmath24 as a diagnostics to identify clump stars based on just the radial - mode frequencies . given the general preconception that @xmath12 is determined mainly by the surface layers , and the fact that the structural differences between clump and rgb stars are predominantly in the core , such a significant signature may be somewhat surprising .",
    "here we analyse the origin of the difference in behaviour between the rgb and the clump model .",
    "section [ sec : model ] presents results for stellar evolution models of various masses . in section [ sec : analysis ] we analyse the relevant properties of stellar oscillations for models on the rgb and in the clump and relate the difference in @xmath24 to the properties of the convection zones of the two stars ; a further analysis of the convection - zone properties is provided in appendix a. finally , section [ sec : discuss ] gives a discussion of the results and summarizes our conclusions .",
    "we computed evolutionary tracks using the garching stellar evolution code ( garstec ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the input physics included the nacre compilation of nuclear reaction rates @xcite , the @xcite solar mixture , opal opacities @xcite for high temperatures supplemented by low - temperature opacities from @xcite , the 2005 version of the opal equation of state @xcite and the mixing - length theory of convection as described by @xcite .",
    "convective overshooting and diffusion of helium and heavy elements were not considered .",
    "the parameters of the models were chosen to correspond to a calibrated solar model , including diffusion and settling of helium and heavy elements ; this resulted in the convective efficiency @xmath26 and initial abundances by mass of hydrogen and heavy elements of 0.712 and 0.0192 .",

    "[ fig : epsevol ] shows a significant difference between @xmath24 between rgb and clump models at fixed @xmath14 for a given mass , and hence at approximately fixed radius and surface gravity .",

    "one possibility would be that @xmath24 is directly related to the effective temperature , which is the principal difference between the superficial properties of the rgb and clump stars , on the assumption that @xmath24 is predominantly determined by the stellar surface layers . at the opposite extreme @xmath24 might somehow be directly related to the stellar core , the site of the most fundamental differences between the two types of stars .    to test the assumption that the difference in @xmath24 is related to the difference in effective temperature between rgb and clump we computed a set of evolution sequences for the rgb , varying the mixing - length parameter @xmath34 to change @xmath0 at given radius .",

    "[ fig : epsteff ] the results are compared with a pair of models of the same mass and radius on the rgb and the clump , discussed in more detail below . it is evident that the change in @xmath24 from rgb to clump is quite different from the effect expected simply from the change in @xmath0 .",
    "the effect on @xmath24 must therefore have a more deep - seated origin .",
    "the most dramatic difference between the structure of the rgb and clump model is obviously in the core .",
    "it was noted by @xcite that the phase in the asymptotic expression for acoustic - mode frequencies does indeed contain a contribution from the core of the star .",

    "@xcite investigated the diagnostics of the solar envelope on the basis of second differences of frequencies at fixed degree , to isolate the oscillatory component of the variation , and applying an asymptotic analysis of the near - surface behaviour of the oscillations to characterize the effect of the helium abundance on the seismic signature .",
    "a detailed analysis of the potential for diagnostics of the helium ionization zone based on acoustic - mode frequencies in red giants was carried out by @xcite , on the basis of fits to second differences of frequencies similar to those of @xcite .",
    "broomhall et al .  noted the difficulties arising from the sparcity of the acoustically - dominated modes , and the complexity induced for dipolar modes by the mixed behaviour .",
    "their results showed , as also found by @xcite , that the acoustic depth of the helium ionization could be determined reasonably reliably , whereas the amplitude of the signal , reflecting the abundance of helium , was difficult to obtain with an accuracy providing a significant abundance determination , even with the nearly four years of data provided by the _ kepler _ mission .",
    "it is possible that a more detailed analysis of the envelope phase , perhaps involving the filtering proposed by @xcite , could lead to a more robust determination of the abundance .",
    "this probably deserves further investigation .",

    "it is probably this difference in density that mainly affects the ionization state of helium , leading to the differences in @xmath65 and sound speed illustrated in fig .",

    "we note that the bulk of the convective envelope is adiabatically stratified . neglecting furthermore the variation in @xmath65 in the ionization zones and taking @xmath96 to be constant , @xmath97 and @xmath52",
    "are related by @xmath98 defining the adiabatic constant @xmath93 .",
    "introducing @xmath99 , it follows from the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium , @xmath100 where @xmath101 is the gravitational constant , that @xmath102 in the outer parts of the convective envelope we can neglect the variation in mass and take @xmath103",
    ". then equation ( [ eq : hydequ ] ) can be immediately integrated , to yield @xmath104 where @xmath105 is a suitable reference radius and @xmath106 .",
    "it follows that the squared sound speed is @xmath107 also , assuming the ideal gas law , the temperature is approximated by @xmath108 where @xmath37 is the mean molecular weight , @xmath109 is the atomic mass unit and @xmath110 is boltzmann s constant .",
    "finally , it follows from equations ( [ eq : adiab ] ) and ( [ eq : usol ] ) that @xmath111 where @xmath112 is the polytropic index and @xmath113 for the fully ionized ideal gas relevant here @xmath114 , and hence @xmath115 .    in the comparison of models @xmath30 and @xmath31 , which have approximately the same mass and radius , equation ( [ eq : tsol ] )",
    "predicts that there should be little difference in temperature .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : moddifrho ] this is indeed approximately the case in the outer parts of the convective envelope , although with modest differences related to variations induced by the helium ionization zone . on the other hand , equation ( [ eq : rhosol ] ) predicts a difference @xmath116 , given by the difference in the adiabatic constant , which is independent of position , which again is approximately satisfied in the outer parts of the convection zone , as shown in fig . [ fig : moddifrho ] .",
    "although moving beyond the immediate topic of the present paper it is of interest to consider the behaviour in the deeper parts of the convection zone , where the mass can no longer be considered to be constant .",

    "this is reflected in the behaviour of @xmath133 in fig .",
    "[ fig : moddifrho ] . to make a more quantitative comparison we estimated @xmath134 in the two models by applying equation ( [ eq : rhozero ] ) at @xmath135 and determining the corresponding values of @xmath132 from equation ( [ eq : qzero ] ) , resulting in @xmath136 and 0.89 for models @xmath30 and @xmath31 . using these values in equation ( [ eq : usoli ] ) results in the estimate of @xmath133 shown by the thin dot - dashed curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : moddifrho ] .",
    "it is clear that our , relatively rough , approximation captures most of the effect on the temperature difference .",
    "similarly , the variation in @xmath137 in the deeper parts of the convective envelope can be accounted for by equation ( [ eq : rhosoli ] ) .",
    "it is obvious that the analysis could be iterated by repeating the determination of @xmath138 using equation ( [ eq : rhosoli ] ) ; little further insight would be obtained from this , however .",
    "the relations for the sound speed are closely related to the differences between rgb and clump stars , noted by @xcite , in the scaling relation for @xmath14 .",
    "the integral in equation ( [ eq : asympsep ] ) is dominated by the contribution from the convective envelope .",
    "using the approximation in equation ( [ eq : csol ] ) clearly implies the commonly used scaling relation , i.e. , that @xmath139 .",
    "the correction factor in equation ( [ eq : usoli ] ) leads to a decrease in @xmath9 , an increase in the integral and hence a decrease in @xmath14 , relative to the simple scaling . this effect is stronger in the rgb model , owing to the larger value of @xmath132 , than in the clump model , leading to a smaller @xmath14 in the former model at fixed mean density , as found by @xcite .",
    "a more quantitative analysis of this effect and its influence on the diagnostics based on global asteroseismic parameters would be interesting , but is beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "to relate the properties of the convective envelopes to the surface properties of the stars we note that the bulk of the convection zone is at an essentially constant specific entropy @xmath140 , related to the adiabatic constant in the region of nearly constant @xmath65 by @xmath141 apart from an arbitrary additive constant .",
    "the change in entropy between the photospheric value @xmath142 and @xmath140 is determined by the superadiabatic gradient near the top of the convection zone , @xmath143 where @xmath144 , @xmath145 is its adiabatic value , @xmath146 is the specific heat at constant pressure , @xmath147 is the photospheric pressure and the upper limit of the integral is at a point in the adiabatically stratified interior of the convection zone .",
    "the superadiabatic gradients in models @xmath30 and @xmath31 are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : superad ] .",
    "it is evident that @xmath148 , and hence the integral in equation ( [ eq : sad1 ] ) , is bigger in @xmath31 than in @xmath30 ; this dominates the fact that @xmath93 is bigger in the former model , corresponding to the lower density and hence the difference in the ionization of helium leading to the difference in @xmath24 .",
    "the behaviour of @xmath149 in the superadiabatic region , at the assumed fixed mixing length , is dominated by the fact that the opacity is higher in model @xmath31 than in @xmath30 , owing to the higher effective temperature and hence higher photospheric temperature and the strong temperature dependence of the dominant @xmath150 opacity .",
    "this leaves open the question of the dominant causation in the difference between the thermodynamic state of the two models .",
    "it seems plausible to us that the main effect must be the higher mass in the core and the consequent lower density in the convective envelope , at fixed stellar radius .",
    "the properties of the superficial parts of the convective envelope have to respond to this , requiring the higher superadiabatic gradient and hence the higher effective temperature .",
    "further investigations of this interplay between the interior and superficial properties of red giants appear worthwhile ."
