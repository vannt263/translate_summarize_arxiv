    "solar - type stars are prime targets for many studies in astrophysics .",
    "their spectra are rich in metallic lines , which allow precise determinations of the fundamental stellar parameters and elemental abundances through different well - established techniques ( e.g. , excitation and ionization equilibria or spectral synthesis ) .",
    "they are also long - lived and have a large age dispersion , probing a considerable fraction of the history of the milky way .",
    "furthermore , the compositions of their atmospheres remain almost unchanged ( with the exception of li , be and b ) throughout their evolution on the main sequence .",
    "all these properties make solar - type stars the ideal candidates to study time - dependent processes , such as the chemical evolution in the solar neighborhood , and many successful examples of this application can be found in the literature ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the addition of radial or spatial velocities for these objects provides an approach to study dynamical processes within the disk , such as radial migration and kinematical heating ( e.g. , @xcite ) . local stellar samples with both kinematical and chemical information",
    "may also be used to identify stars from different galactic components within the thin - disk dominated population in the solar neighborhood ( @xcite ) . in order to improve the accuracy of these studies and to extend them over larger volumes , massive spectroscopic surveys such as segue ( @xcite ) and rave ( @xcite )",
    "have been developed , with additional projects expected in the near future ( e.g. , galah ; @xcite ) .",
    "although its main scientific goal is the study of the formation and evolution of giant planets , brown dwarfs ( bds ) and low - mass stars , it was soon realized that the multi - object apo radial velocity exoplanet large - area survey ( marvels ; @xcite;@xcite ) could also contribute to a better understanding of the chemical and kinematical evolution of the solar neighborhood . during its four - year operation ( 2008 - 2012 ) as part of the third phase of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss - iii ; @xcite ) , a sample of @xmath03,300 fgk stars with 7.6 @xmath1 v @xmath1 12.0 ( many of which were never previously analyzed ) had their radial velocities ( rvs ) monitored in the search for companions .",
    "the targets were selected according to a limited number of well - defined criteria that did not explicitly include any cuts based on the metallicities , activity levels and ages of the stars ( for more details , see @xcite ) .",
    "the final sample thus presents a well characterized selection function , providing a statistically homogeneous data set .",
    "the kinematical analysis will benefit from the precise rvs delivered by the marvels survey ( @xmath2 100 m s@xmath3 ) .",
    "the chemical analysis , on the other hand , depends on the availability of precise atmospheric parameters ( effective temperature , , and surface gravity , ) and chemical abundances ( metallicity , [ fe / h ] , and @xmath4-element content , [ @xmath4/fe ] ) .",
    "stars with rv variations suggestive of the presence of companions were selected for a more detailed study , which included the acquisition of high - resolution ( r @xmath5 30,000 ) spectra to determine their fundamental parameters by applying standard spectroscopic techniques ( excitation and ionization equilibria of fe i and fe ii lines ; see the details in @xcite ) .",
    "stars without detected companions , which correspond to @xmath080% of the survey targets , were not be subjected to a similar high - resolution spectroscopic follow - up and thus the stellar characterization had to rely solely on the marvels data . although the numbers of visits for each target ( typically @xmath520 ) were able to produce final combined spectra with high signal - to - noise ratios ( s / n @xmath5 100 ) , the moderate resolution ( r @xmath0 12,000 ) and somewhat limited wavelength range ( @xmath05000 - 5700  ) of the data prevented the usage of the classical analysis mentioned above . in this resolution regime ,",
    "most of the lines are blended with neighboring features and the stellar characterization through the measurement of equivalent widths ( ews ) of individual iron lines is not feasible .",
    "recent large spectroscopic surveys operating in the low - to - intermediate resolution ( @xmath02,000  20,000 ) regime have developed pipelines that rely exclusively , or at least partially , on the spectral synthesis technique in which the stellar parameters are determined through a comparison of the observed spectra with an extensive library of previously calculated synthetic ones .",
    "as examples , we can mention the pipelines from segue ( sspp ; @xcite ) , rave ( @xcite ) , lamost ( @xcite ) and ambre ( @xcite ) .",
    "although spectral fitting is a powerful technique and provides precise results for high - quality data ( e.g. , @xcite ) , it has some drawbacks : ( 1 ) dependency on a very detailed and extensive list of spectral lines ( many of which may have poorly determined atomic parameters ) ; ( 2 ) the need to accurately know the broadening parameters ( instrumental profile , macroturbulence and rotational velocities ) . ( 3 ) stronger correlations ( relative to the excitation and ionization equilibria method ) between the resulting atmospheric parameters ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . for the specific case of marvels ,",
    "the relatively small wavelength coverage ( @xmath6 700  ) combined with the moderate resolution can significantly decrease the accuracy of the spectral synthesis technique .",
    "therefore , a different method is necessary to efficiently and accurately derive the parameters of the stars that did not have high - resolution follow - up spectra .",
    "the purpose of this work is to develop and validate an alternative approach based on spectral indices  specific spectral regions combining multiple absorption lines into broad , blended features  to determine atmospheric parameters directly from the marvels spectra , without any other priors .",
    "indices have been successfully applied before to derive information on mean stellar ages and metallicities of populations of galaxies and stars ( e.g. , @xcite ) , as well as atmospheric parameters for target selection purposes in planet search surveys ( e.g. , @xcite ) . because a manual object - by - object analysis of a numerous sample such as that from marvels is prohibitively time - consuming , we have developed three codes to automate the determination of stellar parameters .",
    "this paper describes the proposed automatic approach to perform the stellar characterization of marvels targets and validates its results using data from the survey and the elodie stellar library ( @xcite , @xcite ; see website for the most updated 3.1 version ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ data ] presents the data used to build the calibrations that were later adopted for the derivation of the atmospheric parameters",
    ". a sample of marvels stars utilized to test the precision of the results is also described .",
    "the definition of the spectral indices is detailed in section [ indices ] , while section [ pipeline ] is devoted to a thorough description of the method .",
    "the four steps of our analysis ( normalization of the spectra , measurements of ews , construction of the calibrations and derivation of atmospheric parameters ) are explained in separate subsections .",
    "the results obtained with the spectral indices are shown in section [ results ] , along with a discussion regarding their accuracy . finally , our concluding remarks are presented in section [ conclusions ] .",
    "two different samples of stars were used in this work .",
    "the first is formed by stars with well - known atmospheric parameters ( derived from the analysis of high - resolution spectra ) and was utilized to construct the calibrations used to obtain the atmospheric parameters ( , [ fe / h ] and ) , thus being referred to as the _",
    "calibration sample_. the second contains a subset of marvels targets for which independent high - resolution spectra and precise atmospheric parameters are available .",
    "as its purpose was to check the performance of the spectral indices approach , we called it _",
    "validation sample_. both samples are described in more detail below .",
    "the calibration sample is composed of 309 stars ; their high - resolution spectra , effective temperatures , surface gravities and metallicities were taken from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "figure [ samples ] shows the distribution of these stars ( open circles ) in parameter space ; it is clear that this sample has a good coverage in the following intervals : 4800 k @xmath7 @xmath7 6500 k , 3.60 @xmath7 @xmath7 4.70 and @xmath80.90 @xmath7 [ fe / h ] @xmath7 @xmath90.50 .",
    "the majority of the stars were taken from @xcite , but the 17 stars classified as giants by the authors were not included here .",
    "this cut was done because their spectra are considerably different from those of dwarfs and subgiants and a proper analysis would require a distinct set of spectral indices .",
    "the remaining 291 stars ( 262 dwarfs and 29 subgiants ) all have high - resolution ( r @xmath0 48,000 ) and high - quality ( s / n @xmath5 200 per resolution element at @xmath10 6700  ) spectra obtained with the fiber - fed extended range optical spectrograph ( feros ) spectrograph ( @xcite ) attached to the mpg / eso 2.2 m telescope ( la silla , chile ) , under the agreement between eso and observatrio nacional ( mct ) .",
    "additional details about the sample selection , observations and data reduction are given in @xcite .",
    "the authors also describe the homogeneous derivation of the atmospheric parameters ( and ) and metallicities ( [ fe / h ] ) that were utilized in this work . in summary , the standard spectroscopic analysis based on the excitation and ionization equilibria of a carefully selected list of fe i and fe ii lines was used to determine the results in an automated procedure .    in order to better populate the region [ fe / h ] @xmath11 of the parameter space ,",
    "the above sample was complemented with stars from @xcite .",
    "nine stars are common with @xcite and were considered only for comparative purposes ( see below ) .",
    "the remaining 18 stars have high - resolution ( r @xmath0 48,000 ) and high - quality ( s / n @xmath5 300 ) spectra acquired with the feros spectrograph fed by the eso 1.52 m telescope .",
    "the details about the sample selection , observations and data reduction for these objects can be seen in @xcite . a description of the iterative method used to determine the atmospheric parameters ( and ) and metallicities ( [ fe / h ] ) adopted here are also provided by the authors .",
    "briefly , the effective temperatures were estimated from the arithmetic mean of the values derived from photometric calibrations and h@xmath4 profile fitting .",
    "the surface gravities were derived using these effective temperatures and also stellar luminosities and masses .",
    "the luminosities were calculated from hipparcos parallaxes and v magnitudes .",
    "the masses were obtained from interpolation in grids of evolutionary tracks using the effective temperatures , luminosities and metallicities . finally , the metallicities were determined from a differential analysis relative to the sun using fe i and fe ii lines .",
    "the 291 stars from @xcite and 18 from @xcite compose the final calibration sample used in this work . although the two subsamples were analyzed with somewhat different methods , we find that the resulting parameters are consistent . for the 9 stars in common , the average differences are ( in the sense ghezzi - del peloso ) : @xmath12 = @xmath84 @xmath13 41 k , @xmath12[fe / h ] = @xmath80.04 @xmath13 0.04 dex , and @xmath12= 0.00 @xmath13 0.12 dex . in this paper ,",
    "the spectra and parameters from @xcite were adopted for these nine stars .",
    "we note that these parameters are consistent with those from many other catalogs of atmospheric parameters available in the literature ( see , e.g. , table 4 of @xcite ) .",
    "to ensure consistency between the calibration and marvels survey data ( the latter is described in section [ testsample ] ) , the feros spectra were degraded and resampled to the marvels resolution and sampling .",
    "the iraf tasks ` gauss ` ( with a value of 8.0 for the _ sigma _ parameter ) and ` dispcor ` ( with a value of 0.154 for the _ dw _ parameter ) of were used , respectively , to accomplish this .",
    "the spectra were also trimmed with iraf s task ` splot ` in order to keep only the region 5100 - 5590  , which is present in the majority of the marvels spectra .",
    "the validation sample consists of the full set of 30 stars that currently have both low resolution marvels spectra and precise atmospheric parameters resulting from the analysis of high - resolution spectra .",
    "sixteen of these stars are marvels targets with detected companions which were or are currently being subjected to more detailed analyzes .",
    "their high - resolution spectra were obtained with the arc echelle spectrograph ( arces ; @xcite ) attached to the astrophysical research consortium ( arc ) 3.5 m telescope at the apache point observatory ( apo ; new mexico , usa ) and/or the feros spectrograph attached to the mpg / eso 2.2 m telescope . the resolutions are @xmath031,500 and @xmath048,000 , respectively , and all spectra have s / n @xmath5 100 per resolution element .",
    "their atmospheric parameters were derived following the method described in @xcite and are given in table [ marvels_cand_param ] .",
    "briefly , they were derived from two independent pipelines , both based on the technique of excitation and ionization equilibria of fe i and fe ii lines .",
    "given the consistency of the results , the two sets of parameters were combined through a weighted average , using the internal uncertainties from each pipeline as the weights .",
    "the other 14 stars are known planet - hosts which were used in the marvels survey as reference objects for the rv determinations .",
    "their atmospheric parameters are the arithmetic average of the values taken from multiple sources in the literature ( see table [ marvels_ref_param ] ) . in this table ,",
    "the uncertainties correspond to the standard deviations of the average values from the literature ( and not to internal errors of the method , as in table [ marvels_cand_param ] ) .",
    "the distribution of parameters for the thirty stars in the validation sample is also presented in figure [ samples ] ( filled squares ) .",
    "the low resolution spectra for the validation sample were obtained , as part of the survey , with the marvels instrument ( @xcite ; @xcite ) coupled to the sdss 2.5 m telescope at apo ( @xcite ) .",
    "the marvels instrument is a 60 object , fiber - fed , dispersed fixed delay interferometer ( dfdi ; @xcite ) that outputs two fringing spectra ( `` beams '' ) per object with a resolution r @xmath0 12,000 and a wavelength coverage between @xmath14 5000 - 5700  .",
    "since each star was visited typically @xmath5 20 times , the final combined spectra have s / n @xmath5 100 per pixel ( dispersion 0.154   / pixel ) . to convert the fringing spectra to conventional 1d extracted spectra , the former are first preprocessed , including corrections for optical distortion and slit illumination , creating a continuum - normalized fringing spectrum . then , for each wavelength , a sinusoid is fit to the fringing pattern which lies perpendicular to the wavelength axis .",
    "the dc offset of this sinusoid is the flux value of the normalized 1d extracted spectrum for that wavelength .",
    "these fluxes ( counts per pixel ) are converted into flux densities ( counts per unit wavelength ) , and then a barycentric rv correction is applied such that all 1d extracted spectra for a given star are registered to the rest wavelength .    the determination of atmospheric parameters from these low - resolution marvels spectra and spectral indices is described in the following sections .",
    "the ability of the method to accurately recover the high - resolution results previously derived for the marvels stars is regarded as the validation test of the approach presented in this paper .",
    "we note that , in spite of its relatively small size , the adopted validation sample offers the most realistic check for the quality and reliability of our method since it uses real marvels data ( which includes instrumental effects , noise , etc ) .",
    "moreover , the set covers most regions of the parameter space defined by the calibration sample ( see figure [ samples ] ) and also the ranges of atmospheric parameters expected for the whole marvels sample ( according to the selection criteria employed during the survey target selection ) .",
    "as already mentioned , the marvels resolution prevents the characterization of the stars through measurements of equivalent widths of individual lines ( and consequently classical model atmosphere analysis ) because most of the spectral lines become blended with neighboring features . to overcome this problem ,",
    "we have used instead an approach based on spectral indices ( e.g.,@xcite ) , which are defined here as groups of lines formed by similar chemical species .",
    "more specifically , we have selected two groups of interest with features dominated by : ( 1 ) neutral iron - peak species ( such as fe i , v i , cr i , mn i , co i and ni i ) and ( 2 ) ionized species ( such as fe ii , ti ii , and cr ii ) .",
    "these groups have , in principle , properties that should allow us to constrain , [ fe / h ] and .",
    "note that we consider a feature to be dominated by a certain group of elements when their respective lines account for more than 90% of its total absorption .",
    "the two groups were identified through a detailed inspection of the interval 5100 - 5590   on two versions of the same feros ganymede spectrum ( @xcite ) that was adopted as a solar template ( see figure [ indices_plot ] ) .",
    "the first version retained the original resolution ( r @xmath0 48,000 ) and was used in conjunction with @xcite to identify the individual lines that composed the indices .",
    "the second version was degraded to the marvels resolution and sampling ( see section [ calibsample ] ) and was used to determine the initial and final wavelengths of the selected indices .",
    "degraded feros spectra of the stars hd 32147 and hd 52298 were also utilized during the selection of the indices ( see figure [ indices_three_stars ] ) .",
    "hd 32147 is a cool metal - rich star ( = 4850 k and [ fe / h ] = 0.25 ; @xcite ) and corresponds to an extreme example of a spectrum with very strong indices .",
    "the analysis of its spectrum allowed us to refine the wavelength intervals previously defined for the indices ( based on the solar spectrum ) and to eliminate those that were not sufficiently isolated ( i.e. , did not have clear apparent continuum regions between them and the neighboring features ) .",
    "hd 52298 is a hot metal - poor star ( = 6253 k and [ fe / h ] = @xmath80.31 ; @xcite ) and illustrates the opposite case , in which the strengths of the indices become too weak , preventing accurate measurements of their equivalent widths . in summary , these two stars probe the extremes of the anticipated absorption strengths of the spectral indices and helped us to exclude possibly problematic features .",
    "following the procedure described above , a total of 96 potential indices were selected : 80 dominated by neutral iron - peak species and 16 by ionized species .",
    "the properties of these indices are listed in table [ indices_properties ] .",
    "we have referred to them as potential indices because their actual sensitivities to the atmospheric parameters are only analyzed in section [ regressions ] . the final list with the best available indices for the subsequent characterization of the marvels sample resulted from this analysis .",
    "the marvels sample contains @xmath03,300 stars with a high enough number of visits for robust planet detection and the time required to manually analyze all objects , each with @xmath540 spectra , would be prohibitively large . moreover , such an approach would be more error prone due to subjective choices that are inevitably made throughout the analysis of stellar spectra ( e.g. , during the continuum normalization ) . to avoid these issues ,",
    "the determination of the atmospheric parameters was automatized through the development of three codes , which will be made publicly available throught the brazilian participation group scientific portal .",
    "these codes , as well as the tests performed to ascertain their quality , are described in more detail in the following sections .",
    "the normalization of a spectrum is a time - consuming task since one must test several parameters for choosing the curve that best describes the continuum of a particular star . as we aim to apply the indices technique for large stellar samples ( in particular , from the marvels survey ) , an automatic tool to perform this task is required . to this end",
    ", the first program was developed to fit a curve to and normalize the continuum on the spectra of solar - type stars .",
    "it was inspired by the task ` continuum ` from iraf , but has the advantage of automatically testing many different normalizations and determining which one provides the best fit .",
    "this feature turns the normalization process into a fast , non - interactive and systematic procedure , characteristics that are essential for the analysis of large samples of stars .",
    "the code uses as input the reduced , defringed , 1d doppler - corrected spectra ( in fits format ) that are given as part of the final products delivered by marvels pipeline .",
    "it is possible to combine more than one spectrum using the median counts as weights and cosmic rays can be removed through a @xmath15 clipping algorithm if at least five spectra are being co - added .",
    "a number of 1d legendre polynomials are then fit to the continuum points of the individual or combined spectra , in a wavelength range defined by the user . both the number of polynomials tested and of points considered in the fit depend on an additional set of input parameters provided by the user : polynomial order , high and low rejection limits ( as well as the steps with which they are changed ) , grow parameter and number of iterations to be performed .",
    "all parameters have the same definitions as in the task ` continuum ` from iraf .",
    "the program computes as many solutions as the choice of the input parameters described above , but testing all possible combinations for each star would require an excessive amount of time and most of the solutions would not be considered satisfactory .",
    "thus , we decided to restrict the set of input parameters using 27 stars ( seven with degraded feros spectra and 20 marvels targets with spectra from the survey ) with parameters that sample the range of indices strengths expected to be found in the stars from the marvels survey .",
    "we note that this test set included cool metal - rich stars to ensure that suitable apparent continuum regions could still be found , allowing accurate normalizations .",
    "the best visual normalizations were found for the following values of the input parameters : 5 or 6 for the order of the legendre polynomials ; 1.0 to 1.5 and 3.0 to 4.0 ( both with steps of 0.5 ) for the low and high rejection parameters ; 1 for the grow parameter ; 11 for the number of iterations .",
    "it was also observed that the fits with the highest correlation coefficient @xmath16 always produced the best results ( the same was not true for the cases with the lowest values of the standard deviation of the residuals @xmath15 ) and this is the reason why we chose this statistical criterion to select the final solutions .",
    "there are some limitations that could not be circumvented by the code after these restrictions were made .",
    "these issues are mainly related to the inability to deal with cosmic rays ( due to inefficient clipping or insufficient number of spectra to be combined ) or regions with defects ( e.g. , strong curvatures on the edges ) .",
    "the former can be minimized by combining a larger number of spectra for each star ( which was not possible for the stars with feros data ) .",
    "the second limitation is more complicated , but the usage of higher values for the polynomial order proved to be effective in most of the cases .",
    "the spectra of the 309 stars from the calibration sample ( section [ calibsample ] ) were normalized using the code and the restrictions and criteria described above .",
    "an example of the normalization procedure is shown in figure [ examples_norm ] .",
    "we visually inspected the final solutions for each of the 309 stars to search for normalization problems that could undermine the indices calibrations .",
    "the solutions provided by the code had to be replaced by visually better fits in 9% of the cases , which defines a reasonable limit to the degree of efficient automation of the normalization process .",
    "for the analysis of the complete marvels sample , the number of spectra will be larger by a factor of @xmath0100 and such a visual inspection will not feasible .",
    "we are currently working on a complementary code to automatically identify these cases that require human intervention based on large variations of the continuum fit parameters or the measured ews for some indices .",
    "even though an effort was made to ensure that the continuum placement was as accurate as possible , it is possible that small offsets are still present for a few spectra .",
    "the typical s / n of the individual marvels spectra for the validation sample is @xmath0100 , which corresponds to a rms error of the continuum of @xmath0(s / n)@xmath170.01 .",
    "using the method described in sections [ ews ] , [ regressions ] and [ method ] as well as the final results presented in section [ finalresults ] , we have checked that an offset of @xmath131% in the continuum placement causes the following average variations on the derived atmospheric parameters : @xmath12= @xmath85 @xmath13 42 k , @xmath12[fe / h ] = @xmath130.12 @xmath13 0.04 and @xmath12= @xmath180.07 @xmath13 0.07 .",
    "note that these values correspond to the unlikely case in which a global systematic offset would shift all the spectra of all the stars in the sample in the same direction and by the same amount .",
    "therefore , they should be regarded as the maximum possible errors that could be introduced by normalization issues .",
    "the actual errors will therefore be smaller than estimated here ( see also discussion in section [ finalresults ] ) .",
    "the normalized spectra obtained above for the calibration stars were used as input for the next code , which measures the equivalent widths ( ews ) of a list of indices provided by the user by direct integration of their profiles .",
    "this method was chosen because most of the indices are formed by multiple lines , each with a different type of profile ( gaussian or voigt ) .",
    "the integrations were performed in the wavelength intervals defined for each index ( see table [ indices_properties ] ) adopting the value of 1.0 for the normalized continuum flux .",
    "this code was used to measure the equivalent widths of the 96 indices ( see section [ indices ] ) in the degraded feros spectra of all 309 stars from the calibration sample .",
    "we have checked that all indices ews could be correctly measured even for the most metal - poor stars in the sample . a quick look at columns `` ewmin '' in table [ calibrations_ew ] and `` notes '' in table [ indices_properties ] reveals that 4.81 m is the lowest value for a equivalent width used in the calibrations that were adopted for the derivation of the atmospheric parameters ( more details about this selection are given in the next section ) .",
    "this value occurs for the star hd 76932 (= 5850 k and [ fe / h ] = -0.84 ) in the calibration for index 80 and is consistent with the lower limit of the measuring capabilities of our automated software .",
    "problematic ews were identified and discarded during the construction of the regressions ( see section [ regressions ] ) , since bad measurements appeared as clear outliers relative to the general trends observed . for the marvels targets , multiple spectra from different visits",
    "are available for a given star and the outliers can be excluded by a simple @xmath15 clipping procedure .",
    "the previous section discussed the measurements of the equivalent widths of the 96 spectral indices in the spectra of the calibration stars .",
    "it was also mentioned in section [ calibsample ] that all these objects have precise atmospheric parameters ( , [ fe / h ] and ) derived from detailed and homogeneous analysis of high - resolution spectra . with both the ews and atmospheric parameters in hand , we explored the relations between these quantities through a multivariate analysis and the final result was a set of calibrations that allowed the subsequent characterization of the marvels validation sample based solely on spectral indices ( without any other priors ) .",
    "figure [ index_sensitivity ] shows an example of the behavior of the indices ews as a function the atmospheric parameters for the calibration sample .",
    "clear relations are readily visible for and [ fe / h ] , while only scatter can be seen for .",
    "although this initial qualitative analysis revealed some promising indices , it can be misleading for the cases which lack evident correlations . the scatter might result from a truly weak sensitivity of the index relative to the parameter in question , but can also be caused a stronger sensitivity to one of the other two parameters ( recall that these plots show only a 1d projection of a possibly 3d relation ) .",
    "problems during the measurement of the ews for particular indices ( e.g. , possible contaminations having larger contributions than anticipated ) certainly also play a role .",
    "therefore , we decided not to remove any of the indices based on this initial visual inspection .",
    "the starting point of the quantitative analysis was the choice of an appropriate model to describe the relations observed in plots similar to figure [ index_sensitivity ] . in principle , all indices ews depend on the three atmospheric parameters in a complicated way which includes the interdependency between these parameters .",
    "tests with different polynomial orders revealed that a quadratic model would be able to correctly describe most of the observed behaviors . thus , we decided to search for the best calibrations for each index using second - order polynomials with the following structure :    @xmath19 } + c_{2}t_{\\rm eff } + c_{3}\\log g + \\nonumber \\\\ c_{4}{\\rm [ fe / h]}t_{\\rm eff } + c_{5}{\\rm [ fe / h]}\\log g + c_{6}t_{\\rm eff}\\log g + \\nonumber \\\\ c_{7}({\\rm [ fe / h]})^{2 } + c_{8}(t_{\\rm eff})^{2 } + c_{9}(\\log g)^{2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    these models ensure that any eventual interdependence between the atmospheric parameters are taken into account .",
    "some of the terms , however , could be statistically insignificant and , to evaluate this possibility , the choice of the final best calibrations followed an iterative procedure , which was performed with a python routine developed for this work .",
    "the starting point was equation ( [ ewcalib ] ) , for which the coefficients @xmath20 , ... , @xmath21 were determined through the ordinary least squares ( ols ) method ( i.e. , without any weights ) .",
    "we have designated these the complete models .",
    "when the best fit was found , the outliers were removed with a 2@xmath15 clipping .",
    "the previous steps were repeated three times and this limit was chosen to avoid an excessive exclusion of points .",
    "the mean number of stars that appeared as outliers was 37 , with minimum and maximum values of 19 and 49 , respectively .",
    "these numbers correspond to @xmath06 - 16% of the complete calibration sample , which is a reasonable fraction .",
    "we have checked that these outliers do not correspond to the stars that had their normalizations replaced by visually better fits ( see section [ norm ] ) . at the end of this iteration",
    ", the following statistical quantities were obtained for the current model : the correlation coefficient @xmath16 of the fit , the standard deviation of the residuals ( @xmath15 ) and the bayesian information criterion ( bic ) .",
    "the code then searched for models that had the same polynomial order and a similar ability to fit the data , but with fewer terms ; these are the reduced models .",
    "the progression of these tests was hierarchical , i.e. , the higher - order terms were the first ones to be removed . in each trial , a temporary reduced model and its associated statistical quantities ( @xmath16 , @xmath15 and bic ) were calculated .",
    "this reduced model was then compared to the complete one and the temporarily removed term was definitely excluded from the polynomial if three criteria were simultaneously met : both @xmath15 and bic are lower for the reduced model and the corresponding coefficient @xmath22 is statistically insignificant according to the f - statistics . if these conditions were satisfied , the reduced model replaced the complete one and new trials were done until all terms were tested . if one of the conditions was not satisfied , the tested term returned to the model and the trials continued until the relevance of all terms was evaluated .",
    "after the iterative procedure described above , a final optimized calibration was obtained for each index .",

    "the next step was the analysis of the residuals ( i.e. , the differences @xmath12ew between the equivalent widths ew@xmath24 calculated with equation [ ewcalib ] and the equivalent widths ew@xmath25 measured in the stellar spectra ) for the remaining 92 calibrations .",
    "these were plotted as a function of the variables ( ew , , [ fe / h ] and ) and linear fits were applied to the data to evaluate the existence of any systematics .",

    "[ fe / h ] and as the independent variables , the values of @xmath16 are essentially null for all indices .",
    "these results demonstrate that the residuals are free of any significant systematic trends and there is no need to apply any a posteriori linear corrections to the ews calculated with equation ( [ ewcalib ] ) .",
    "the last of the three codes developed for this work delivers the final products of our analysis , which are the atmospheric parameters and their associated uncertainties . to accomplish this task , the program only requires the equivalent widths and calibrations discussed in sections [ ews ] and [ regressions ] , respectively .",
    "these can be changed in order to account for differences in resolution and wavelength range of the spectra .",
    "the choice of the best atmospheric parameters for each star is based on the minimization of a reduced chi - square ( @xmath26 ) and is described below .",
    "first , a set of 92 theoretical ews ( one for each index ) is calculated for each point of a three - dimensional grid of atmospheric parameters .",
    "the grid covers the following intervals : 4700 k @xmath1 @xmath1 6600 k , with 10 k steps ; @xmath80.90 @xmath1 [ fe / h ] @xmath1 0.50 , with 0.02 dex steps ; 3.50 @xmath1 @xmath1 4.70 , with 0.05 dex steps .",
    "these ranges are consistent with the parameter space covered by the calibration sample .",
    "smaller steps were tested , but no improvements in the results were observed .",
    "then , for each set of atmospheric parameters , a comparison between the observed and theoretical ews is performed through the calculation of a reduced chi - square as follows :    @xmath27    in the above equation , @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the equivalent widths of the @xmath30-th index measured on the observed spectra and calculated with the calibrations , respectively .",
    "the number of indices used is given by @xmath31 .",
    "finally , @xmath32 is an error associated with the equivalent widths . for the calibration sample , it is simply the standard deviation found for each calibration , i.e. , @xmath33 . for the marvels validation sample ,",
    "@xmath32 is given by the quadratic sum of this term and the standard deviation of the average ews measured on the stellar spectra , i.e. , @xmath34 ( more details in section [ marvelsresults ] ) .",
    "the final atmospheric parameters are those that produce the minimum value of @xmath26 .",
    "this value is also used for the determination of the associated uncertainties .",
    "first , we consider all sets of parameters that have @xmath35 , then calculate the differences between these parameters and those considered to be the best ones ( corresponding to @xmath36 )",
    ". finally , the root mean squares of these differences are taken as the errors of the parameters .",
    "the previous sections were devoted to a description of the method that was used to derive the atmospheric parameters based only on the equivalent widths of spectral indices .",
    "we now discuss the tests performed to show that this approach is capable of recovering the precise atmospheric parameters determined from high - resolution stellar spectra and model atmosphere analysis .",
    "the first test was a sanity check with the calibration sample .",
    "the same equivalent widths employed to build the calibrations were used to derive the atmospheric parameters for the 309 calibration stars .",
    "the comparison between these results and those derived from high - resolution analysis is presented in figure [ param_calib ] .",
    "the average differences obtained for each parameter are given in the upper part of table [ diff_param ] .",
    "the offsets between the two sets of parameters are negligible and the dispersions around the average residuals are lower or of the order of the external errors usually found in high - resolution analyses ( for instance , see table 5 of @xcite ) .",
    "the situation is similar for the internal uncertainties of the method ( based on the @xmath26 ; see section [ method ] ) , which have typical values in the ranges 50  150 k for , 0.05  0.10 dex for [ fe / h ] and 0.10  0.25 dex for .",
    "the obvious outlier in the middle row panels of figure [ param_calib ] is a star that was excluded for 94 indices during the regressive analysis ( see section [ regressions ] ) .",
    "no significant trends can be seen in the residuals , except for systematically higher and lower values at @xmath05400 k and above @xmath06300 k , respectively .",
    "the latter behavior is probably caused by the reduced number of calibration stars ( only seven ) or by the fact that most of the indices become weaker in this temperature interval .",
    "this hypothesis is further supported by the behavior of the internal uncertainties ; slight increases can be observed towards higher effective temperatures or lower metallicities . in both regimes",
    ", we have fewer stars and smaller ews .",
    "the behavior at @xmath05400 k could be related to the discontinuity in the number of calibrations stars with cooler and hotter effective temperatures ( see figure [ samples ] ) .",
    "this systematic effect , however , has a small amplitude , with the majority of the residuals being within @xmath13100 k.    as a complementary check , we have also analyzed the feros solar spectrum from @xcite with the same approach as above .",
    "the derived atmospheric parameters were : = 5720 @xmath13 95 k , [ fe / h ] = @xmath80.02 @xmath13 0.06 and = 4.30 @xmath13 0.16 .",
    "we can see that there is a good agreement with the standard solar parameters within the uncertainties .",
    "this result is expected given that the selection of the indices was based on a ganymede spectrum used as solar template .",
    "the above results thus provide a confirmation that the spectral indices method produces internally consistent atmospheric parameters .",
    "the second test had the goal of demonstrating that the method is capable of accurately recovering the high - resolution atmospheric parameters of a given stellar sample that was not used in the calibration of the method . to perform this exercise",
    ", we used the validation sample of 30 stars observed as part of the marvels survey ( see section [ testsample ] ) .",
    "the approach described in section [ pipeline ] was used to obtain the atmospheric parameters from the reduced , defringed , 1d , doppler - corrected marvels spectra .",
    "a few remarks are needed , however .",
    "all marvels stars have two sets of spectra because their light is divided into two `` beams '' that are collected by two neighboring fibers ( see section [ testsample ] ) .",
    "each set of spectra was analyzed separately and the exposures within each group were not combined for the normalization procedure .",
    "this procedure was done because we wanted to have multiple measurements for the ews of the indices in order to remove possible outliers and to have an estimate of their uncertainties .",
    "the average ews obtained after an iterative 2@xmath15 clipping ( until there were no outliers left ) were used as input to the atmospheric parameters determination method .",
    "the @xmath15 used in the calculation of @xmath26 was given by the quadratic sum of @xmath37 and @xmath38 , as previously mentioned in section [ method ] .",
    "finally , the two sets of parameters for each star were combined using a simple arithmetic average , with the uncertainties being obtained through an error propagation .",
    "the results in this initial attempt were not acceptable .",
    "the offsets relative to the high - resolution parameters and the dispersions were too large ( see the upper part of table [ diff_param ] ) .",
    "moreover , there were significant systematic trends as a function of .",
    "the only possible causes for these issues were the two types of input data used in our method : the measured ews or the calibrations .",
    "however , the good results obtained from the test with the calibration sample ruled out the latter . direct comparisons between the equivalent widths measured in the feros degraded and marvels solar spectra revealed significant differences . however , these differences were not caused by problems in the normalization and did not present any systematic behavior as a function of @xmath39 , , [ fe / h ] , and the ews themselves .",
    "therefore , we decided to derive individual corrections for each index to place the marvels ews onto the feros scale .      in order to derive the corrections ,",
    "we have considered 120 marvels solar spectra ( one for each fiber of the instrument ) observed simultaneously on 17 november 2009 .",
    "there is a different wavelength solution for each fiber , so the ranges covered vary from one spectrum to another . to avoid having indices with significantly fewer equivalent width measurements than others ,",
    "we have decided to use only the wavelength range that is present in all 120 expsoures , which corresponds to the interval @xmath05137 - 5543   . as a consequence of this choice , 18 indices were removed from our analysis : 2 - 7 on the blue end ( note that 1 was already excluded because its calibration had @xmath40 0.9 ) and 85 - 96 on the red end ( all marked with a number 3 in the notes of table [ indices_properties ] ) .    for the remaining 74 indices ,",
    "the average ews from the 120 solar spectra and their respective standard deviations were calculated .",
    "no clipping was performed because we wanted to retain all the information regarding the variations of the ews with the fiber number in the instrument .",
    "this is important because the marvels stars could have been observed with any of the 120 fibers .",
    "we then calculated the differences @xmath41 .",
    "if these differences were higher than the corresponding values for @xmath42 , the indices were removed .",
    "this was the case for the following ten indices ( marked with a number 4 in the notes of table [ indices_properties ] ) : 33 , 34 , 39 , 40 , 54 , 55 , 61 , 62 , 66 , 67 .",
    "finally , it was decided that the remaining 64 indices would have their average marvels equivalent widths corrected by the difference @xmath43 .",
    "although this correction was based only on the sun , it was applied to all stars in the validation sample , regardless of their parameters . as it is shown below",
    ", the correction proved to be effective .",
    "another constraint implemented for the analysis of the marvels stars was the removal of corrected average ews that were outside the ranges defined by each of the calibrations ( see table [ calibrations_ew ] ) .",
    "this cut was done to avoid any extrapolation outside the parameter space defined by our calibration sample .      using the method with the above optimization to the marvels data",
    ", we rederived the atmospheric parameters for the 30 stars in the marvels validation sample .",
    "recall that the final results for each object were obtained from an arithmetic average of the parameters produced by its two associated fibers .",
    "the two sets of results are in good agreement , with average differences of @xmath818 @xmath13 91 k for , 0.01 @xmath13 0.06 dex for [ fe / h ] and @xmath80.09 @xmath13 0.16 dex for .",
    "these values highlight that the data from adjacent fibers on the marvels instrument are consistent .",
    "the comparison between the atmospheric parameters derived from the indices and high - resolution analyses is presented in figure [ param_marvels ] .",
    "the average differences obtained for each parameter are given in the lower part of table [ diff_param ] .",
    "the offset in the metallicity is once again close to zero . for",
    ", we have a non - negligible negative value , but it is lower than the dispersion of the residuals and the typical uncertainties found for this parameter .",
    "a similar situation was found for .",
    "however , the offset in this case can be traced back to the reference values for the surface gravity .",
    "we recall that the values for the calibration sample present a small offset relative to other literature values ( see table 5 of @xcite ) .",
    "the dispersions around the average offsets are either lower than , or on the order of , the typical external uncertainties of high - resolution analyses .",
    "this was also the case for the internal uncertainties of the method , which have typical values in the ranges 80  160 k for , 0.05  0.10 dex for [ fe / h ] and 0.15  0.25 dex for .",
    "all these values are close to the ones derived for the calibration sample .",
    "the residuals do not exhibit any significant trends , except possibly for the same ones observed for in the results for the calibration sample .",
    "the residuals and internal uncertainties do not exhibit significant trends as a function of the s / n values of the spectra or the @xmath44 magnitudes of the stars ( taken from the guide star catalog ; @xcite ) , as can be seen on figure [ delta_sig_sn ] .",
    "the total s /",
    "n for a given star was obtained from the arithmetic average of the values derived from its two sets of spectra ( one from each fiber ) .",
    "the s / n for each set was calculated by multiplying the average s / n of the individual spectra @xmath45 by the square root of the number of spectra @xmath46 .",
    "this is a reasonable approximation considering that the exposure times are similar for all spectra of a given star .",
    "the lack of a dependency between the accuracy and precision ( differences and errors in left and right columns of figure [ delta_sig_sn ] , respectively ) of the results and the s / n of the spectra can be explained by a particular characteristic of our data .",
    "all stars have s / n @xmath47 200 per pixel ( dispersion 0.154   / pixel ) and this value is certainly higher than the limit below which we would start to observe a decline in the quality of the results with decreasing s / n .",
    "thus , we conclude that all stars have high - quality data that allow our approach to work at its best precision and accuracy .",
    "the method was further tested using the 120 marvels solar spectra described previously . since we wanted to obtain the best possible results , an iterative 2@xmath15 clipping ( until there were no outliers left ) was applied to calculate the average ews of the sun . following the exact same method employed for the marvels validation sample",
    ", we derived the results : = 5760 @xmath13 81 k , [ fe / h ] = @xmath80.04 @xmath13 0.05 and = 4.40 @xmath13 0.15 .",
    "the agreement with the standard solar parameters is excellent .    for completeness",
    ", we also utilized the restricted set of 64 indices ( without any corrections ) to rederive the parameters for the calibration stars .",
    "as can be seen on the lower part of table [ diff_param ] , there are no significant differences relative to the previous case in which all 92 indices were considered .",
    "the above results for the marvels validation sample show that the spectral indices approach is able to accurately recover the precise atmospheric parameters derived from the analysis of high - resolution spectra .",
    "moreover , the differences between the two sets of results and the internal uncertainties of the method presented here are both consistent with the typical external errors obtained in high - resolution analyzes .",
    "it should be highlighted that this is achieved by using only equivalent widths directly measured on the observed low - resolution marvels spectra , with no other priors .",
    "the third and last test was conducted to complement the previous one .",
    "although the validation sample contains stars with real spectra from the marvels survey , we recognize that 30 stars is a relatively small number to critically evaluate the performance of our method .",
    "therefore , we decided to analyze the spectra contained in the elodie stellar library ( @xcite , @xcite ; see website for the most updated 3.1 version ) .",
    "briefly , the library includes 1962 high - resolution ( r = 42,000 ) spectra observed with elodie spectrograph coupled to the 1.93 m telescope at observatoire de haute - provence . the spectra cover the wavelength range 3900 - 6800  , have s / n values varying between 30 and 680 and belong to 1388 stars that non - uniformly sample the following intervals of atmospheric parameters : 3442 k @xmath1 @xmath1 47250 k , @xmath82.94 @xmath1 [ fe / h ] @xmath1 @xmath91.40 and 0.00 @xmath1 @xmath1 4.90 .",
    "the above values are quoted from the source catalog for reference , but our analysis is restricted to only those stars who have literature average atmospheric parameters within the limits defined by our calibration sample ( 4800 k @xmath7 @xmath7",
    "6500 k , @xmath80.90 @xmath7 [ fe / h ] @xmath7 @xmath90.50 and 3.60 @xmath7 @xmath7 4.70 ) .",
    "we have also restricted our selection to stars with classes 3 or 4 attributed to their average parameters , which means that the typical standard deviations around their mean and [ fe / h ] values are 62 k and 0.08 dex and 74 k and 0.10 dex , respectively .",
    "no cuts in s / n were applied , but stars with indications of variability or close neighbors were removed .",
    "the final elodie test sample consists of 219 spectra from 138 unique stars . as for the feros sample",
    ", these spectra were degraded to the marvels resolution following the same procedure described in section [ calibsample ] .",
    "the elodie test sample was analyzed with the approach presented in section [ pipeline ] .",
    "all spectra were normalized individually and the equivalent widths of the indices were measured in each of them , as if they belonged to different stars .",
    "this was done to check the internal consistency of the atmospheric parameter determinations for a given star based on different spectra , which found to be good .",
    "the ews of the 92 indices for which the calibrations have r@xmath48 0.9 were considered .",
    "again , a data - specific tuning was necessary and a correction to the equivalent width scale based on the sun was performed .",
    "average solar elodie equivalent widths were calculated using 11 of the 13 spectra of the sun with s / n @xmath49 100 .",
    "the differences between these average ews and the values measured on the feros solar degraded spectrum were adopted as individual corrections for each index . using",
    "these corrected equivalent widths and the calibrations presented in section [ regressions ] , atmospheric parameters were derived for the elodie sample .",
    "the results can be seen in figure [ param_elodie ] and in table [ diff_param ] .",
    "we can see that the agreement for and [ fe / h ] is good and the average differences and dispersions ( 15 @xmath13 125 k and 0.06 @xmath13 0.10 , respectively ) can be entirely explained by a combination of the internal and external uncertainties from our method with the typical standard deviations around the mean elodie parameters .",
    "mild trends are observed for the residuals of these parameters , with the differences between the two sets of results increasing for hot and metal - poor stars , which is expected due to the lower number of calibration stars in these regions of the parameter space .",
    "spectra with low s / n values also contribute for the observed trend , since they are clearly associated with the largest residuals ( see also figure [ delta_sig_sn_elodie ] ) .",
    "the agreement for , on the other hand , is only reasonable , with a relatively large dispersion and clear trends in the residuals .",
    "this result was not totally unexpected since the previous tests with the calibration and validation samples have shown that the surface gravity is the most difficult parameter to accurately constrain . although the average difference and dispersion ( 0.07 @xmath13 0.29 ) can again be explained by a combination of the uncertainties in the two sets of parameters , we can see that some stars have differences higher than 0.5 dex .",
    "however , it is clear from the lower panels that these stars are hot and/or metal - poor .",
    "thus , the poor determinations of and [ fe / h ] could also be affecting the estimate of .",
    "many of these stars also have spectra with low s / n values ( see figure [ delta_sig_sn_elodie ] ) .",
    "the average solar parameters derived from the 13 spectra available are : = 5750 @xmath13 66 k , [ fe / h ] = 0.00 @xmath13 0.04 and = 4.32 @xmath13 0.11 . the agreement with the canonical solar parameters = 5777 k ,",
    "[ fe / h ] = 0.00 and = 4.44 ) is very good , with the surface gravity providing the most discrepant result once again .",
    "the elodie test sample also offers the opportunity to check the performance of our method for lower s / n spectra , which was not possible for the marvels validation sample .",
    "figure [ delta_sig_sn_elodie ] shows the differences between the spectral indices and elodie atmospheric parameters as well as the uncertainties of the former as a function of the s / n per pixel of the spectra . for s / n @xmath49 200 - 250",
    ", the typical values of the differences and uncertainties agree well with the ones for the marvels sample . at s / n @xmath0 200 - 250 , there is a significant increase in both quantities . for s / n @xmath50 200 - 250 ,",
    "the scatter of the distributions stay pretty much constant .",
    "these results show that our method is capable of providing reliable results for spectra with lower s / n , although with lower accuracies than in the high - s / n regime .",
    "the tests discussed above provide an additional validation of the spectral indices method , based on a larger sample of observed stellar spectra with typically lower s / n values .",
    "as in the previous sections , the precise atmospheric parameters from the literature were recovered with a good precision .",
    "the small trends observed in the residuals are caused by the non - uniform sampling of the parameter space by our calibration sample and the lower sensitivities of the indices to the surface gravity .",
    "in this paper , we described the usage of spectral indices as a fast and homogeneous approach to determine accurate atmospheric parameters ( , [ fe / h ] , ) for samples of fgk dwarfs and subgiants with intermediate ( r @xmath0 12,000 ) resolution spectra , applied to observations from the marvels survey .",
    "equivalent widths of the indices were measured on normalized spectra and then compared to values calculated with a set of calibrations , which were constructed using 309 stars with precise atmospheric parameters resulting from the analysis of feros spectra .",
    "the best solutions were obtained through a @xmath26 minimization of the differences between these two sets of ews .",
    "the entire analysis was automatized with three codes developed for this work .",
    "the spectral indices method was validated with a sample of 30 stars which were observed as part of the marvels survey and have precise atmospheric parameters derived from classical model atmosphere analyses .",
    "we were able to recover these parameters within 80 k for , 0.05 dex for [ fe / h ] and 0.15 dex for .",
    "the average internal errors of the method are 101 k , 0.06 dex and 0.15 dex , respectively .",
    "these values are consistent with the typical external uncertainties found between different high - resolution spectroscopic analyses ( see , e.g. , table 5 of @xcite ) .",
    "further confirmation of the good performance of the method was provided by the analysis of a subsample of 138 stars from the elodie stellar library with average literature atmospheric parameters with good quality .",
    "these were recovered by our method with precisions of 125 k for , 0.10 dex for [ fe / h ] and 0.29 dex for .",
    "the higher uncertainties are caused by a combination of the internal uncertainties of the spectral indices approach , the typically lower s / n values for the elodie spectra and the typical standard deviations around the mean elodie parameters .",
    "undersampled regions in the parameter space for the calibration sample might also play a role",
    ". however , these errors are still similar or lower than typical uncertainties provided by the pipelines of other intermediate - resolution surveys ( e.g. , rave ; @xcite ) .",
    "this agreement demonstrates that the spectral indices approach is a powerful tool to derive accurate and precise atmospheric parameters for solar - type stars .",
    "the method is quite general and its application to a particular data set requires only a small tuning of the input parameters ( list of indices and the measured equivalent widths ) .",
    "the approach has an excellent performance , yielding typical stellar parameter uncertainties comparable to or better than those provided by pipelines that utilize spectral synthesis , such as the ones from the segue , rave and lamost surveys .",
    "we note , however , that they analyze spectra with lower resolutions , s / n values , wavelength coverages or combinations of these properties .",
    "our method could be adopted by similar surveys , with modifications to the list of indices and calibrations as appropriate for differences in the resolution and wavelength coverage .",
    "the next step of our work is the application of the spectral indices method to the entire marvels sample ( @xmath03,300 stars ) , which contains many faint stars ( @xmath44 @xmath0 10 - 12 ) that were never previously analyzed .",
    "the atmospheric parameters will then be used to derive additional stellar properties , such as mass , radius , distances and ages . the kinematic analysis ,",
    "on the other hand , will follow from the precise rvs determined by marvels . with accurate chemical and kinematical information for a large and statistically homogeneous sample",

    "<S> studies of galactic chemical and dynamical evolution in the solar neighborhood depend on the availability of precise atmospheric parameters ( effective temperature , metallicity [ fe / h ] and surface gravity ) for solar - type stars . </S>",
    "<S> many large - scale spectroscopic surveys operate at low to moderate spectral resolution for efficiency in observing large samples , which makes the stellar characterization difficult due to the high degree of blending of spectral features . </S>",
    "<S> most surveys therefore employ spectral synthesis , which is a powerful technique , but relies heavily on the completeness and accuracy of atomic line databases and can yield possibly correlated atmospheric parameters . in this work </S>",
    "<S> , we use an alternative method based on spectral indices to determine the atmospheric parameters of a sample of nearby fgk dwarfs and subgiants observed by the marvels survey at moderate resolving power ( r @xmath0 12,000 ) . to avoid a time - consuming manual analysis , </S>",
    "<S> we have developed three codes to automatically normalize the observed spectra , measure the equivalent widths of the indices and , through the comparison of those with values calculated with pre - determined calibrations , determine the atmospheric parameters of the stars . </S>",
    "<S> the calibrations were derived using a sample of 309 stars with precise stellar parameters obtained from the analysis of high - resolution feros spectra , permitting the low - resolution equivalent widths to be directly related to the stellar parameters . </S>",
    "<S> a validation test of the method was conducted with a sample of 30 marvels targets that also have reliable atmospheric parameters derived from the high - resolution spectra and spectroscopic analysis based on excitation and ionization equilibria method . </S>",
    "<S> our approach was able to recover the parameters within 80 k for , 0.05 dex for [ fe / h ] and 0.15 dex for , values that are lower or equal to the typical external uncertainties found between different high - resolution analyzes . </S>",
    "<S> an additional test was performed with a subsample of 138 stars from the elodie stellar library and the literature atmospheric parameters were recovered within 125 k for , 0.10 dex for [ fe / h ] and 0.29 dex for . </S>",
    "<S> these precisions are consistent or better than those provided by the pipelines of surveys operating with similar resolutions . </S>",
    "<S> these results show that the spectral indices are a competitive tool to characterize stars with the intermediate resolution spectra . </S>"
