    "russian money market consists of three main segments , the markets of deposits , repo and swap .",
    "operations at the deposits market are uncollateralized : banks bound their risk in lending money to counterparties by setting limits calculated with the help of in - house models and taking into account expert opinions .",
    "lending risks are also regulated by the special requirement of the bank of russia constraining the value of exposure to a counterparty .",
    "the uncollaterized nature of the deposit market makes it the most vulnerable with respect to trust evaporation during crises when deposit markets can freeze requiring significant efforts from regulators for their relaunching .",
    "less risky is the repo market at which collateral , usually government and corporate bonds and equities , is required . in operations with money borrowing",
    "the value of different types of collateral includes discounts thus reducing the corresponding market risk .",
    "credit risk is more often accounted for in the credit rate .",
    "let us note that while at the beginning of the russian crisis in 2008 the repo market in russia did collapse , it started functioning faster than the deposit one .",
    "the least risky is the swap market .",
    "often swap operations are used as a source of short - term ruble liquidity when in exchange of rubles a lender gets foreign collateral ( most often usd and eur ) .",
    "swap operations were attractive for russian banks during the period of systemic liquidity deficit when banks are permanently in need of liquidity refinancing from central bank .",
    "we provide comparative statistics for outstanding in different segments of the russian money market in table [ t_market_outstanding ] . for deposit market",
    "it includes claims on banks ( resident and non - resident ) in deals with russian rubles . for swap market it includes claims on resident and",
    "non - resident banks in rubles against usd and euro as collateral .",
    "it is worth saying that the data includes deals between banks at the otc market as well as through central counterparty ( ccp ) , the latter option was used in almost 25% of swap deals .",
    "the repo market data includes claims on banks in rubles . in 2013",
    "the project of repo deals through central counterparty was launched .",
    "the total outstanding on ccp at the end of 2013 year was 1.5 bln .",
    "usd . to highlight the importance of money market we also provide the total value of assets of the russian banking system .",
    "some information concerning evolution of the outstanding for different money market segments can be found in the bank of russia  money market report  @xcite .",
    "[ t_market_outstanding ]    .volumes of deposit , repo and swap markets and total market of banking activities in russia in bln .",
    "usd @xcite .",
    "total assets of banking system are given to compare the volume of money market with that of other banking activities such as corporate and retail lending , investments in securities , and others . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     from table [ t_def_prob ] we also see that the average stability of banks with respect to default risks as characterized by the average car underwent , between 2011 and 2013 , a significant reduction .",
    "it is quite clear that lower values of car generate larger systemic risks .",
    "indeed , an analysis in @xcite has shown a dramatic dependence of contagion on capital reserves . a dependence of the average size of default cluster on car ( calculated on the monthly basis )",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ scar ] .        from fig .",
    "[ scar ] it is clearly seen that there indeed exist a pronounced dependence of the magnitude of contagion on the capital reserves reflected by car .",
    "it is quite typical for contagion that its volume grows with increasing centrality of the source node , see e.g. @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fdefclonlink ] we plot a dependence of the average size of the default cluster on the out - degree of the bankrupt node ( i.e. the number of lenders ) , where for each day and each bank we calculate the number of lenders and the size of default cluster generated by this bank at this day and average over all days in a given year .",
    "we see that indeed the volume of contagion increases with increasing out- degree and that for large out - degrees the dependence in question is distinctly nonlinear so that the volume of contagion shows a faster than linear growth with the out - degree of the source node . from fig .",
    "[ fdefclonlink ] one can also conclude that , following the above - described reduction in car from 2011 to 2013 , a volume of contagion has dramatically grown within this period .",
    "the key question in developing a model for propagation of contagion is that of topology of default clusters . in our simulation",
    "we found out that default clusters combining vulnerable banks are , with very few exceptions , tree - like with the maximal length of branches equal to 4 . in directed graphs",
    "the simplest nontrivial motifs , triangles , can belong to two types , t1 and t2 , differing by orientation of participating links , see figs .",
    "[ fexamplemotifa ] and [ fexamplemotifb ] correspondingly .",
    "let us consider for definiteness an example shown in fig  [ fexamplemotifb ] , where the starting event is a default of the bank a leading to f critical car loss of b , but leaving c with an admissible car of 10.4 % ( with the regulatory minimum set at 10 % ) .",
    "the consequent car loss of 0.6 % from the link @xmath0 does , however lead to the default of c. our simulations have shown that , over all the days , the average number of triangles of the type t1 is 0.06 and of the type t2 - 1.2 .",
    "both numbers are small as compared to total number of default clusters per day considered in our simulations . the effectively tree - like structure of the default cluster that allows to neglect motifs in working out a mathematical model for default cascading . in particular , under this assumption propagation of vulnerability between the nodes can happen only along a single link .",
    "the last key ingredient for modelling default propagation is to quantify vulnerability of a given node with respect to default of at least one of its neighbors .",
    "vulnerability can most naturally be described as a probabilistic characteristic of link s ability to transport contagion from one node to another .",
    "we call a link vulnerable if a default of the counterparty may lead to default of another counterparty through this link .",
    "the link vulnerability depends on the local geometry of a network .",
    "generically it is defined as a conditional probability @xmath1 of default propagation from the node with in- and out - degrees @xmath2 to the node with in- and out- degrees @xmath3 .",
    "in addition vulnerability depends on the position of the two nodes under consideration within the bow - tie structure of the network so that probabilistic pattern of contagion propagation is specified by the conditional probabilities @xmath4 , @xmath5 and their more complex modifications .",
    "the corresponding empirical vulnerability distributions are found to differ a lot , see refs  @xcite .",
    "the mathematical model we use to describe systemic risks on the russian interbank market is based on empirical findings described above in the sections  [ section : deposit ] , [ section : risk_empirics ] .",
    "let us reiterate the main features of importance for description of contagion process :    * degree distributions are fat - tailed .",
    "* the network is characterized by significant disassortative correlations between adjacent nodes . * because of significant differences in systemic risks related to the position of the infected node and its neighbors within the bow - tie structure it is natural to take this into account explicitly when building the mathematical formalism .",
    "* default clusters are tree - like .",
    "let us consider a bank from the in - out component with @xmath6 outgoing links , where @xmath7 of them lead to the in - out- component and @xmath8 to in- component respectively and take a randomly chosen edge linking the chosen node to a node in the in- component which , in addition , has @xmath9 incoming links , see fig .

    "the corresponding part of the default cluster can therefore described as a projection of the initial network onto a graph in which a link in the original graph survives with the probability @xmath15 .",
    "let us now consider a randomly chosen edge linking two banks from the in - out- component , see fig .",

    "let us define a generation function @xmath19 for the probability for a bank from the in - out- component to have @xmath7 and @xmath8 first neighbors from the in - out- and in- components respectively .",
    "then the generation function for the number of vulnerable banks in the network is simply @xmath20^k \\left [ n_{kl}(y ) \\right]^l\\ ] ] it is easy to see that for calculation of the mean default cluster size @xmath21 one can put @xmath22 and compute a derivative of @xmath23 at point @xmath24 .",

    "it reads : @xmath41 where @xmath42 is an element @xmath43 of the matrix @xmath44 .",

    "a comparison of the model predictions and results of stress testing for the average default cluster size is shown in fig.[fdefclustersizecompare ] .",
    "we see a very good agreement between the model and experiment provided one takes into account correlations between the degrees of adjacent nodes captured by @xmath14 and @xmath47 and a much poorer one when these correlations are neglected .",
    "the remaining deviations can be ascribed to using analytical approximation appropriate to infinite graphs the maximal number of branchings in default trees is 4 . ]",
    "another source of deviation is in neglecting triangles in default graph .",
    "let us formulate once again the main conclusions of the paper .    in this study",
    "we have described a new analytical model of default contagion propagation taking into account the difference in the functional role of the nodes ( bow - tie decomposition ) , realistic in- and out- degree and link weight distributions and disassortative degree - degree correlations .",
    "its predictions are shown to be in line with the results of monte - carlo simulations .",
    "let us reiterate , that to build a successful model of contagion propagation in interbank networks one needs to combine empirical studies and adequate theoretical framework .",
    "empirical information of importance is related both to topological characteristics of the interbank market network under consideration and to the process of contagion propagation from node to node that depends , in particular , on interplay between link and node characteristics ( volume of loans and bank balance sheets respectively ) .",
    "it was shown that very good description of default cascade simulation can be given in the formalism that explicitly takes into account degree distributions and degree - degree correlations and conditional probabilities of contagion propagation from one node to another .",
    "let us mention that although a marked difference in conditional default probabilities for nodes belonging to different components and empirical simulation results highlighting the dominant role of the in - out component provide strong arguments for explicit account of the bow - tie structure in describing systemic contagion risks , a more detailed analysis of this issue ( in particular going beyond considering the mean size of default clusters ) is certainly desirable .",
    "we are planning to address this problem in a separate publication .",
    "the results obtained in this paper can be used for estimating systemic risks in interbank networks as well as for analyzing sensitivity of systemic risk with respect to changes in network topology and stability of individual banks .",
