    "we investigate analytically the problem of time - dependent accretion , closely related to the phenomena of flares widely observed in binary systems . in this paper",
    "we will concern ourselves with the emission of the flaring source which is generated by the accretion disk .",
    "we suppose the light curve to be regulated by the accretion rate variations .",
    "such sources are typified by the low - mass x - ray binaries and cataclysmic variables .",
    "after weizscker  ( @xcite ) who considered the evolution of a protoplanetary cloud , the analytical investigations of non - stationary accretion were carried out by lst  ( @xcite ) , lynden - bell & pringle  ( @xcite ) , lyubarskii & shakura  ( @xcite , hereafter ls87 ) as applied to accretion disks . a brief overview is presented in the book by kato et al .",

    "ls87 suggested three stages of evolution of a time - dependent accretion disk ( see also ",

    "viscosity causes the torus to spread and develop into the disk ( 1st stage ) . after the disk approaches the centre",
    ", the accretion rate reaches the maximum value ( 2nd stage ) and begins to descend ( 3rd stage ) . during this stage",
    "the total angular momentum of the disk is conserved .",
    "ogilvie  ( @xcite ) presented a time - dependent self - similar analytical solution for a quasi - spherical advection - dominated flow with conserved total angular momentum .    in a binary system",
    ", variations of accretion rate can be due to the non - stationary exchange of mass between the components of the binary ( mass - overflow instability model ) or due to the disk instability processes ( see kato et al .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) . at some time",
    "the accretion rate onto the centre begins to augment .",
    "we assume that the maximum accretion rate through the inner boundary of the disk corresponds to a peak of outburst and the accretion rate decreases afterwards .",
    "in this study we particularly focus on the stage soon after the outburst . in   2 we outline the general equations of time - dependent accretion .",
    "the basic equation relates surface density of the disk and viscous stresses in it .",

    "the vertical structure of standard keplerian disk is considered in   4 .",
    "in a binary system the third stage of ls87 can not be realized because the accretion disk around a primary would be confined by the gravitational influence of a secondary .",

    "this is a good approximation to the law of motion for particles in the standard sub - eddington disk . in the advection - dominated accretion flow ( adaf )",
    "the particles are substantially subjected to the radial gradient of pressure and thus have the velocity different from that given by ( [ kepler ] ) .",

    "as we mentioned in   6 , the observed light curves can have a slope of decline which is _ different _ from that of the bolometric light curves due to particular spectral distribution . in this section",
    "we are going to illustrate this suggestion assuming the simplest spectral distribution of the disk emission .    to calculate the spectra",

    "[ fshtrih ] ) .",
    "the outer parts of the disk , where accretion rate varies significantly , contributes to the low - frequency band of the spectrum .",
    "we discuss the x - ray band and the most luminous parts of the disk and , thus , we take @xmath121 given by ( [ mdotsol ] ) .    provided each ring in the disk emits as a black body , the temperature of the ring can be found as follows : @xmath170 where @xmath171   is the stephan - boltzmann constant .",

    "however , if the thomson scattering on free electrons contributes substantially to the opacity , the outgoing spectrum is modified ( shakura & sunyaev  @xcite ) .",
    "see e.g. ross & fabian  ( @xcite ) for investigation of spectral forms of accretion disks in low - mass x - ray binaries .",
    "the light curve is simulated by integrating at each @xmath124 the spectral density @xmath178 over the specific frequency range using ( [ mdotsol ] ) and ( [ temper1 ] ) , where @xmath179  erg  s   is the planck constant .",
    "the numerical factor in ( [ spectr ] ) corresponds to the luminosity outgoing from _ one _ side of the disk .    explaining the observed faster - than - power decay of outbursts in soft x - ray transients",

    "naturally , the observed slope of the curve depends on width and location of the observing interval . the narrower this band , the more different the observed curve could look like in comparison with the expected bolometric light curve .",
    "of course , this difference also reflects the spectral distribution of energy coming from the source .",
    "we show here how the slope of the curve changes in the simplest case of multi - color black body disk spectrum according to which spectral range is observed . following ( [ spectr ] ) we calculate @xmath180 and integrate it over three energy ranges : 36  kev , 120  kev and that one in which practically all energy is emitted .",

    "the vertical line marks the time after which bolometric luminosity of the disk s one side is less than @xmath181 .",
    "-0.7 cm    one can see an almost linear trend of the x - ray flux when bolometric luminosity is under the eddington limit ( to the right of the vertical line in fig .  [ flux_fig ] ) , especially in intervals of @xmath182 .",

    "for instance , smaller @xmath0 will result in less steep decline .",
    "the natural explanation of such a result is the following : because the spectral shape of the disk emission has wien - form ( exponential fall - off ) at the considered x - ray ranges , the law of variation of x - ray flux is roughly proportional to @xmath186 . in the free - free regime of opacity",
    "we have @xmath187  ( see   5.1 ) .",
    "consequently , the observed x - ray flux varies like @xmath188 , which is quite close to exponential behavior .",
    "we restrict ourselves to this brief and general discourse , as a detailed application of our model to observed sources is not a goal of this paper .",
    "as we know , the structure of an accretion disk in the vertical direction , the relation between the viscous tensor and the surface density in particular , defines the type of its temporal evolution . in advective disks , which are the low - radiative accretion flows ,",

    "the question is , would the confined ny disk keep such properties or it would not .",
    "the fact is that ny solution describes the infinite disk .",
    "either the boundary conditions destroy the linearity of ( [ basic_adaf ] ) or just the characteristic decay time changes , this problem requires further accurate numerical investigation .",

    "( @xcite ) calculated numerically the global structure of stationary advection - dominated flow with consistent boundary conditions ; they noted that although the self - similar solution ( [ adaf ] ) makes significant errors close to the boundaries , it gives the reasonable description of the overall properties of the flow .",

    "the accretion rate evolves with time as follows ( c.f .",
    "( [ mdotsol ] ) and ( [ f(t)_adaf ] ) ) : @xmath212 the value of accretion rate can be determined if an initial condition is imposed at some @xmath124 .",
    "mahadevan  ( @xcite ) showed that adaf luminosity @xmath213 or @xmath214 according to whether the electron heating is dominated by the coulomb interactions or by the viscous friction .",
    "subsequently , the luminosity has an exponential decay too .",
    "we can estimate the characteristic time of evolution of such flow",

    "ny solution is degenerate if @xmath224 because the angular velocity of the flow is zero in this case .",
    "we can see that the time - dependent advection - dominated disk is quickly depleted if @xmath0 is not small .",

    "it is shown that the decay time scale depends on the real energetic band of detector ( fig .",

    "the results obtained in this work can be applied to the accreting systems having variable emission of flare type if emission is essentially due to the fully ionized accretion disk around a black hole , or a neutron star , or a white dwarf .",

    "this notable result probably persists even when the advective disk is in a binary system .",

    "we suggest an alternative reason to explain this remarkable feature , at least during the early stages of the outburst when the disk is fully ionized .",
    "nearly exponential decays @xmath236 are obtained taking into account the fact that the light curves are observed in the energetic range where the spectrum of the disk has wien - form .",
    "black hole xn spectra typically are composed of an ultrasoft component and a hard power - law component ( e.g. tanaka  @xcite ; tanaka & shibazaki  @xcite ) . at the first stages after outburst the ultrasoft component dominates and",

    "this component has an exponential fall - off , a decisive factor to produce observed exponential trends .",
    "the observed characteristic times can be obtained within reasonable intervals of parameters ( fig .",

    "of course , the accretion disk spectrum represents only one contribution to the total observed spectrum of the source .",
    "the corona around the disk is probably responsible for the other spectral components .",
    "in addition , taking into consideration the irradiation of the outer parts of the disk would affect evolution of the disk ( see , e.g. king & ritter  @xcite ; kim et al .",
    "kim et al .",
    "( @xcite ) constructed an optical light curve of a xn and found the direct irradiation of the disk by the inner layers to have only a small effect on the outer disk because of shadowing .",
    "the indirect irradiation ( from a corona or a chromosphere above the disk ) is found to affect the light curve more strongly .",
    "we suggest that the irradiation of the twisted warped disk could also result in important heating of the outer layers .",
