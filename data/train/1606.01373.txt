    "ngc 6946 , a nearby starburst spiral galaxy , also known as the `` fireworks galaxy '' because of its prolific supernova production , is embedded in an enormous hi halo ( pisano 2014 ) .",
    "the galaxy has a high star formation rate and a number of unusual star - forming regions , such as enigmatic hodge complex which contains a young super star cluster @xcite .",
    "ngc 6946 is famous also for hosting the record number of observed sne .",
    "we found that apart from the above mentioned peculiarities , this galaxy hosts one more strange object , which in common images is seen as just one of its many hii regions .",
    "however , in deep high - resolution images this object is really wonderful .",
    "one of the best existing optical picture of ngc 6946 is the data , obtained with the suprime - cam on the subaru 8.2-m telescope . using this beautiful image from the subaru telescope press - release , one of us ( yu.e . ) has found an unusual red ellipse inside the isolated northern spiral arm ; this color might be caused by emission , what we do establish in this paper .",
    "the ellipse is assumed to be within ngc 6946 , because it is within the chain of hi clouds , h ii regions , and luminous stars comprising the isolated northern arm of this galaxy ( fig .",
    "[ fig_image ] ) . at a distance",
    "to ngc 6946 of 5.9 mpc , the ellipse has a very large size of approximately @xmath1 pc . in this paper",
    ", we present the results of spectroscopic study of this elliptical nebulae on the 6-m telescope of the special astrophysical observatory of the russian academy of sciences ( sao ras ) .",
    "the red ellipse was found at the color image presented in the subaru 8.2-m telescope press - release .",
    "the data were obtained by the subaru observation experience program team in the period of aug 28 - sep 3 , 2008 with the suprime - cam imaging camera and have not been published in peer - review journals yet .",
    "the image presents an excellent combination of a large field ( @xmath2 arcmin ) and high spatial resolution ( pixel size @xmath3 arcsec ) .",
    "figure  [ fig_image ] ( bottom right ) shows the fragment of the subaru press - release composite color -band filter ( centered on 0.45 @xmath4 ) , the green channel is the @xmath5 filter ( centered on 0.55 @xmath4 ) image , and the red channel presents data in the ia651 narrow - band filter centered on 0.651 @xmath4 ( + [ nii]+continuum ) .",
    "the seeing value estimated as fwhm of single stars in the @xmath5 band was @xmath6 arcsec .",
    "later on , we found that the enigmatic ellipse is also well seen in the color image obtained at the kitt peak national observatory ( kpno ) 4-m mayall telescope with the mosaic camera on sep 5 , 2008 .",
    "[ fig_image ] , top right ) .",
    "the composite color image presents the @xmath7 band ( blue channel ) , @xmath5 band ( green channel ) , and + [ nii ] continuum ( red channel ) images .",
    "the pixel size was similar with the subaru data ( @xmath8 arcsec ) , while the seeing was @xmath9 arcsec in the @xmath5 band .",
    "we use the subaru and kpno press - release images to consider the morphological structure of the nebulae without photometric estimations .",
    "the astrometry grid was created using the astrometry.net project web - interface .",
    "the ne part of the red ellipse has a short parallel arc , as well as many other red and white details ( fig .",
    "[ fig_image ] ) .",
    "the ellipse slightly resembles a large supernova remnant somewhat similar to the ultraluminous supernova remnant complex ( mf 16 ) in the ne arm of ngc 6946 , studied by @xcite with hst wfpc2 images .",
    "that ellipse , however , is only about @xmath10 pc ( in spite of being the largest snr in ngc 6946 known until now ) and has strong x - ray emission associated with it .    in any case , the elliptical ring is not a supernova remnant , because there is no [ fe ii ] or x - ray emission , as follows from the data shown by @xcite .",
    "the red ellipse is ten times larger and much brighter than the mf 16 , and this fact alone casts strong doubt on the identification of the red ellipse as a snr .",

    "the slit was 6.1 arcmin in length and 1 arcsec in width , the grism vphg1200@540 provided a spectral resolution of about 4.5 - 5 in the spectral range of 36507250 with a mean reciprocal dispersion of 0.8 per pixel , and with a spatial sampling of 0.36 arcsec per pixel along the slit .",
    "the total integration time was 2400 sec under seeing @xmath11 .",
    "we put the slit across the nebula major axis ( @xmath12 ) , see fig .",
    "[ fig_slitpos ] .",
    "the object data and spectrum of the spectrophotometric standard star observed at the same night were reduced and calibrated using the idl - based software developed at the sao ras , ( see , for instance , * ? ? ?",
    "* )    the parameters of the emission lines ( integrated flux , line - of - sight velocity , fwhm ) were calculated from a single - gaussian fitting using a similar technique described in @xcite . the doublets ( [ nii]@xmath13 , [ oiii]@xmath14 , and [ sii]@xmath15 ) were fitted by a pair of gaussians with the same velocities and fwhm .",
    "we estimated the errors of the measured parameters by analyzing the synthetic spectra degraded by noise with the same signal - to - noise ratio as in the corresponding observational spectrum . to increase the signal - to - noise ratio for weak emission regions , we binned spectrograms into 2 pixels bins along the slit prior to emission line analysis .",
    "the final spatial scale was 0.7 arcsec per pixel in a good accordance with the atmospheric seeing value .",
    "a multicomponent structure of the emission - line profiles was not detected .",
    "also , the fwhm of the main emission lines is in a good agreement with the width of the nearest airglow emission lines , we can only conclude that the actual ( free from instrumental contour broadening ) fwhm of the lines is smaller than 5070@xmath16 .",
    "[ [ section ] ]    [ [ sec_intspec ] ]    figure  [ fig_spectrum ] shows the integrated spectrum around ( @xmath17 ) of the star cluster .",
    "the spectrum appears to be typical of an hii region ; however , weak helium lines are also detected including the low - contrast broad bump around heii@xmath18",
    ". therefore , some emission - line hot stars like of or even wr could belong to the cluster .",

    "[ fig_spectrum ] grows up significantly at the short wavelength , .",
    "level.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]                [ [ section-1 ] ]    only a few of the brightest emission lines are detected in the nebula outside the star cluster regions including the balmer ( , h@xmath19 ) and forbidden ( [ sii]@xmath15 , [ nii]@xmath13 , [ oiii]@xmath14 ) lines . changes of their parameters across the slit are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_lines ] .",
    "the coordinates along the slit ( @xmath20 ) are positive in ws directions with the coordinate origin in the star cluster photometric centre according to the ruler denoted in fig .",
    "[ fig_slitpos ] .",
    "hereafter , we use a term `` the main part '' of the nebulae / red ellipse for points in the coordinate range @xmath21 corresponding to the bright borders of the objects in -images , see figs .",
    "[ fig_image ] and [ fig_slitpos ] . also , our spectrograms allow us to study weak extended diffuse gas around the red ellipse .",
    "note a significant light pollution from the galaxy foreground star at @xmath22 near the sw border of the red ellipse .",
    "we can make the following conclusions based on the changes of emission - line parameters along the slit :    * the velocities of the forbidden and balmer lines are in a good agreement ; their values across the red ellipse nebula lie in the range of 3060@xmath16 that is in a good agreement with the hi observations ( 4555@xmath16 , see below sec .",
    "[ sec_discussion ] ) .",
    "if velocity variations in the main part of the red ellipse ( @xmath23 ) are caused by nebula expansion , the corresponding expansion velocity should be less than 1520@xmath16 .",
    "* behaviors of the forbidden - to - recombination lines ratio are different in the different lines . the relative flux in [ oiii]@xmath24 increases in the ne side of the red ellipse ( around the star cluster ) , while it decreases to the sw arcs , where the [ sii]/ and [ nii]/ ratios grow ( hereafter , we use [ n ii]/and [ s ii]/ to denote the [ n ii]@xmath25/ and [ s ii](@xmath26)/ line flux ratios respectively ) .",
    "obviously , the growth of a temperature - sensitive [ o iii ] emission line is related to the ionization radiation of hot massive stars in the cluster .",
    "[ [ section-2 ] ]    we used the ratios of neighboring emission lines independent of interstellar extinction to probe the gas ionization state .",
    "all points in the main part of the nebulae satisfy the case of photoionization by young stars according to the popular criteria @xmath27/$]@xmath28 and @xmath29/$]@xmath30 @xcite .",
    "however these ratios exceed 0.40.5 in diffuse gas outside the bright nebulae ( @xmath31 , see fig .",
    "[ fig_lines ] ) .",
    "similar behaviors of gas excitation inside / outside the red ellipse are also seen in the classical bpt diagram @xcite present @xmath32/$ ] and @xmath29/$ ] versus @xmath33/\\mbox{h}\\beta$ ] ratio ( fig .",
    "[ fig_ratio ] , top panels ) .",
    "indeed , most points which belong to the red ellipse are located below the conventional lines @xcite separated gas photoionized in the hii - regions and the regions , where gas is ionized by shocks or by hard uv photos from active galactic nuclei ( agn ) . while the points corresponding to the diffuse gas surrounding the main nebulae are located on the border dividing the different excitation mechanisms or even above the line , i.e. , in the shock / agn region .",
    "this fact indicates that shocks contribute to the gas ionization , which is not surprising for warm diffuse gas surrounding sites of current star formation .",
    "also , the border line is occupied by points with @xmath34 from the vicinity of the star cluster , where the densest cloud of neutral gas is located according to the hi column density map ( see below sec .",
    "[ sec_discussion ] and fig .",
    "[ fig_multiwave ] ) . as it was mentioned above , this region",
    "is characterized by relatively bright [ o iii ] emissions , indicating high temperature of gas ionized by hot massive stars including shocks generated by stellar winds from wr and of emission - line stars .    also , we considered diagnostic diagrams separating different types of nebulas ( snr , hii - regions , and pn ) using electron density - depended ratio of sulfur dublet components [ sii ] @xmath35 versus /[nii ] and /[sii ] lines ratio @xcite .",
    "bottom panels in fig .",
    "[ fig_ratio ] show that the points from the main part of the red ellipse avoid the region of galactic and extragalactic snr .",
    "these points are within the range of the lines ratios which is corresponded to hii - regions and the border snr / hii .",
    "the observed data are distributed along vertical axis in the directions of high ratio @xmath36 corresponding to the electron densities @xmath37 ( for @xmath38  k according * ? ? ?",
    "some points are located even above the line ratio 1.44 that is formally forbidden by this ` standard ' @xmath35@xmath39 relation .",
    "it implies that the mean @xmath39 in the red ellipse is smaller then in the typical hii regions , this fact together with the ionization by hot stars and small contribution of shock points to superbubble created by collective actions of massive stars in the ne star cluster , as the most likely explanation of the red ellipse origin .",
    "@xcite were among the first to study star formation in the extreme outer regions of disc galaxies including ngc 6946 .",
    "their -image shows the region of the red ellipse as an unresolved bright source .",
    "they infer that the star formation rate is fairly constant from the inner to the outer disc in ngc 6946 , although , the covering factor of star formation in the outer disc is quite low , so the overall azimuthally averaged star formation rate abruptly drops in the outer regions .    nevertheless , the outer northern spiral arm containing the red ellipse has the highest hi column density of any region in the outer galaxy , with a value of @xmath40 @xcite .",
    "it also has an unusual inward bulk motion of 30@xmath16 , which led @xcite to suggest that this arm was compressed and moved by ram pressure from an intergalactic cloud .",
    "this cloud appears in the hi map of @xcite .",
    "we might infer that this ram pressure has triggered the super star cluster , which resulted in supernovae leading to formation of a giant ( even supergiant for a snr ) elliptical ring ; anyway , we know that sne may arise in a poor cluster as well ( such as sn 1987a , the probable member of a small open cluster in the lmc @xcite .",
    "the most intriguing feature of the nebula is its very regular elliptical shape similar to some snr or galactic ring nebulae around wr or of stars .",
    "however , the size of the red ellipse ( @xmath0 pc along major axis ) is comparable to wind blown structures related to giant hii - regions . other arguments against snr origin of the red ellipse are the following : ( i ) the lack of the x - ray and synchrotron radio emission ; ( ii ) the contribution of shocks in gas ionization is very modest , as follows from our diagnostic diagrams .",
    "the multi - wavelength archive images of the nebula ( fig .",
    "[ fig_multiwave ] ) clearly demonstrate that _ galex _ uv , _ spitzer _ mir , and 6-cm radio emission are directly related to the star cluster in the base of the red ellipse .",
    "the hi line - of - sight velocities are in a good agreement with our estimation in the ionized gas if the difference of spatial resolutions will be taken into account .",
    "the hi velocity variations through the nebulae are modest and do not exceed a few @xmath16",
    ". the extended diffuse regions of the nebulae are not detected in the present multi - wavelength data set with exception of _ spitzer _ data .",
    "indeed , _ spitzer _ 4.5 and 5.8 @xmath4 images reveal weak counterparts in sw side of the red ellipse , where the cavern of low - density gas appears on the hi density map .",
    "we suggest that this feature could be related with warp dust emission , including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons contributions which are usually observed in hii regions of active star formation .",
    "the red ellipse seems to be a nebula created by collective actions of sn explosions and winds of massive stars in the ne stellar cluster ",
    "the presence of wr or of stars is evident on the star cluster spectrum .",
    "however , even in this case , the regular and closed morphology of the red ellipse is unusual .",
    "it is possible that we observe a rare interplay between pre - existed distribution of cold and dense interstellar medium and hot gas ejected from young stellar group . indeed ,",
    "the cavern in the hi distribution according to the thing data matches the emission - line bubble ( fig .",
    "[ fig_multiwave ] ) . a `` wall '' with the hi surface density observed near",
    "the sw border of the red ellipse can prevent its further expansion . a similar ( but not the same ) example is the well - known s3 giant bipolar nebula ( two bubbles about 100 and 200 pc in diameter ) created by a single wo star in the dwarf galaxy ic 1613 .",
    "@xcite have shown that the unique structure of s3 is caused by stellar wind of the wo star embedded in a dense layer at the boundary of hi supercavity .",
    "does the similar scenario work also in the case of the red ellipse ?",
    "new observations , first of all integral - field data in the optical or / and nir ranges together with the detailed simulations of feedback processes on the outskirts of ngc 6946 are crucial for the final conclusion .",
    "the strange shape of this nebula remains enigmatic .",
