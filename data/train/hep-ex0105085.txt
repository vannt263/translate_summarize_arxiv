    "time dependent interactions of @xmath5 and @xmath6 decays can be coupled by the off - diagonal terms in the schrdinger equation .",
    "if cp is conserved in neutral @xmath1 decays , the eigenstates will be described as ( @xmath7)/@xmath8 with mass and width as @xmath9 , @xmath10 .",
    "many calculations conclude that standard model contributions to @xmath11 and @xmath12 parameters are very small , and new physics effects can manifest themselves as an unexpected large measurement in the @xmath13 parameter  @xcite . experimentally , the mixing parameters @xmath13 and @xmath14 are accessible either by searching wrong sign decay of neutral @xmath1 mesons or by comparing lifetimes of cp eigenstate decay channels . in this article , we summarize recent efforts of various experiments who are exploring the charm mixing sector using the second method . from now on",
    ", we assume that the charge conjugate decay modes give the same results as the original decay modes .",
    "for example , if we assume @xmath2 decay or its charge conjugate mode are advancing with equal amount of cp even and odd events , the width of the decay channels is described by @xmath15 .",
    "meanwhile , @xmath3 and @xmath4 decay modes are cp even and their width is described by @xmath16 .",
    "then @xmath0 can be measured as : @xmath17 in the following sessions , the analysis of the focus experiment  @xcite will be shown as well as the preliminary results from the belle  @xcite and the cleo  @xcite experiments .",
    "implications of these measurements compared to the result of the wrong sign @xmath5 decay analysis done by the cleo experiment  @xcite will be discussed at the end .",
    "the focus ( e831 ) collaboration consists of 100 physicists from usa , italy , brazil , mexico and korea .",
    "the experiment is a successor to the fermilab e687  @xcite experiment , and its main purpose is to study charm mesons and baryons produced by photon beams of about 180 gev at a fixed target spectrometer . during 1996 - 1997 run ,",
    "the spectrometer collected more than 1 million reconstructed golden mode charm decays , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 .",
    "the focus group used two modes of neutral @xmath1 decays , @xmath18 and @xmath21 , to obtain the @xmath0 parameter .",
    "the target material consists of 4 slabs of be or beo , depending on the data run periods .",
    "the segmented structure allows 62% of charm particles produced in the target material decaying in air , reducing the absorption correction necessary to the lifetime analysis to a small amount .",
    "two sets of silicon microstrip vertex detectors are built to reconstruct vertices .",
    "the components of the first detector set interspace the target slabs , while the second set is located downstream of the target .",
    "the combination of the relativistic momentum of charged particles and excellent vertex detector performance produces an extremely good proper time resolution of @xmath22 for neutral @xmath1 mesons , which corresponds to 8% of its lifetime .",
    "the good time resolution allows the focus group to use a binned likelihood method free of deconvolution corrections to fit lifetime evolution of charm particles .",
    "the reconstruction algorithm of charm events is optimized to have a flat acceptance over the fit variable ,  reduced proper time \" .",
    "the @xmath1 production and decay vertices are reconstructed by a candidate driven algorithm .",
    "a cut is imposed on the amount of detachment ( @xmath23 ) between the production and the decay vertices to suppress backgrounds coming from light quark events .",
    "reduced proper time is a variable used by fixed target experiments to measure lifetime of particles , defined as the difference between the proper time and the amount of the detachment cut ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "the focus spectrometer has 3 stations of threshold cerenkov detectors to identify charged particles .",
    "a continuous , likelihood - based identification system is used .",
    "this algorithm gives the flexibility useful in assessing systematic errors due to backgrounds .",
    "the event selection is optimized to obtain a sample which has a flat efficiency over the fit variable , @xmath25 .",
    "first , neutral @xmath1 meson candidates are required to pass basic section cuts of detachments ( @xmath26 ) and for tracks reconstructed as kaons , the cerenkov hypothesis to be a kaon should be favored over the hypothesis to be a pion by a factor of 7.39 .",
    "second , the candidate is either identified as a decay of @xmath27 ( tagged sample ) or required to pass more stringent particle identification cuts and kinematic cuts ( inclusive sample ) . as a result , the focus group obtained 119,738 @xmath18 candidates and 10,331 @xmath21 candidates .    histograms of 20 bins with @xmath28 width are used to fit the reduced proper time of the @xmath18 and @xmath21 candidates . in each time bin , the amount of signal is estimated as those of exponential decays adjusted by the absorption / acceptance correction function @xmath29 obtained from monte carlo ( mc ) simulation .",
    "the amount of backgrounds is estimated from the sidebands of @xmath1 mass lineshape . in case of the @xmath21 sample ,",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : focusplots ] ( b ) , a small amount of @xmath18 reflection background is still lingering in the sideband area .",
    "since the time evolution of the reflection background in the @xmath21 sample is governed by the @xmath18 lifetime , lifetime fitting should be done for both decay samples at the same time .",
    "the fit parameters are : @xmath18 lifetime ( @xmath30 ) , the mixing parameter @xmath0 , and normalization parameters of background events for the @xmath18 sample ( @xmath31 ) and for the @xmath21 sample ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : focusplots ] ( c ) shows the reduced proper time evolution of the background subtracted @xmath18 and @xmath21 candidates in the final fit result .",
    "the lifetime and the lifetime differences of the neutral @xmath1 mesons are fitted as follows : @xmath33 the systematic error in @xmath0 is obtained by varying selection cuts and by changing lifetime fit options .",
    "the systematic error on @xmath30 is not shown , since inputs from other neutral @xmath1 decay channels , for example , @xmath20 , are needed .",
    "the belle collaboration presented a preliminary measurements on lifetimes of @xmath5 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 mesons at the 4th international workshop on b physics and cp violation ( bcp4 )  @xcite .",
    "the neutral charm mixing study is shown as a part of their lifetime analysis package , based on the data set of @xmath36 produced by an asymmetric @xmath37 collider , kek - b , operating at 12 gev @xmath38 .",
    "the mixing study is performed with two neutral @xmath1 meson decay modes , @xmath2 and @xmath3 .      to suppress the @xmath39 background smearing into the charm sample , the momentum of @xmath1 candidates is asked to be more than 2.5 gev in the @xmath38 frame .",
    "identification of charged particles is determined by using information from various detectors : a central drift chamber ( cdc ) , a time of flight system ( tof ) , and an aerosol cerenkov counter ( acc ) .",
    "@xmath40 separation of up to 3.5 gev is achieved . to enhance purity of the @xmath1 sample further",
    ", a decay angle cut is applied for each mode . for signal events ,",
    "the decay angle distribution ( @xmath41 ) should be flat .",
    "the requirement of the @xmath27 tag is optional . from the selection ,",
    "the belle group found @xmath42 @xmath18 events and @xmath43 @xmath21 events .",
    "proper lifetimes of charm mesons are calculated from the distance between the charm decay vertex and the production vertex ( @xmath44 ) .",
    "the decay vertex is reconstructed using all tracks from the charm candidate .",
    "the resulting d flight path is extrapolated to the beam interaction region and a production vertex is obtained .",
    "an unbinned maximum likelihood fit is used to obtain the charm lifetime and the mixing variable @xmath0 .",
    "the likelihood function for each event is described by a sum of following terms : the signal term described by an exponential of lifetime @xmath45 convoluted by a resolution function @xmath46 , a term for background events described by an exponential of lifetime @xmath47 convoluted by a resolution function @xmath48 , and another term for background events which do not have a lifetime and convoluted by the @xmath48 . for signals ( backgrounds ) ,",
    "the resolution is @xmath49 for 56 ( 60)% of events and @xmath50 for 44 ( 40)% of events .",
    "a combined lifetime fit using both @xmath18 and @xmath21 distributions is performed and the following lifetime parameters are obtained : @xmath51 the errors shown above are statistical only .",
    "a detailed study on systematic errors is currently going on .",
    "the numbers are consistent with separately measured neutral @xmath1 lifetimes ; @xmath52 , @xmath53 the belle measurements on the @xmath5 lifetime and the mixing parameter @xmath0 are consistent with the ones from other experiments .",
    "figure  [ fig : belleplots ] shows the mass and lifetime distributions used to extract the fit results .",
    "at the bcp4 conference , the cleo collaboration summarized their recent efforts on measurements of @xmath54 mixing , cp violation in @xmath5 decays , and @xmath55 width  @xcite .",
    "they showed the preliminary analysis on @xmath5 lifetime using @xmath18 , @xmath21 , and @xmath56 decay channels , based on a data set of @xmath57 produced by a symmetric @xmath37 collider , cesr , operating at 10.6 gev ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "the kinematic characteristics of charm particles created in the cleo detector are similar to those created in the belle .",
    "the @xmath27 tag is required to select neutral @xmath1 events , exploiting the excellent cleo resolution on the mass difference between @xmath27 and @xmath5 ( @xmath58 ) .",
    "the cleo group selected @xmath59 @xmath18 , @xmath60 @xmath21 and @xmath61 @xmath56 events .",
    "the cleo analysis is also performed using unbinned maximum likelihood fits to proper time distributions of three @xmath5 decay channel candidates .",
    "the fitting method is optimized for finding lifetime differences , not for finding lifetime of neutral @xmath1 mesons .",
    "the resolution function of proper time in the likelihood is described by three gaussians : one gaussian for events with correctly measured proper time and two gaussians for events with mismeasured proper time . for most events ,",
    "the resolution is about 35% of the neutral @xmath1 lifetime .",
    "the following @xmath62 values are obtained for each decay channel : @xmath63 , @xmath64 , and @xmath65 .",
    "the @xmath62 values are highly correlated to the @xmath5 mass constrained in the fit procedure .",
    "this fit technique is not used in the dedicated @xmath1 lifetime analysis published by the cleo group  @xcite . mixing parameter values",
    "are calculated as differences in lifetimes among three decay channels : @xmath66 @xmath67 this preliminary result is consistent with the measurements from the other experiments .",
    "dominant systematic errors are coming from statistical uncertainty in mc lifetime study ( @xmath68 ) , background description ( @xmath69 ) , proper time resolution model ( @xmath70 ) , and fit procedure ( @xmath70 ) .",
    "the most recent five results on @xmath5 lifetime are shown on table  [ lifetime ] .",
    "the measurements obtained by the focus and the belle experiments from the lifetime difference analysis are comparable to those from the dedicated @xmath5 lifetime analysis .",
    ".the recent results on @xmath5 lifetime from various experiments are shown in chronological order .",
    "the average in the table is obtained from the most recent five measurements .",
    "the numbers are consistent between one another .",
