    "four hundred years ago , when johannes kepler and others observed the `` new star '' of 1604 , those observing the event had no concept of what it was that they were observing . today we know that supernovae are exploding stars and that they even come in different varieties .",
    "the type ia sne , which have become so important for cosmology because they are standard candles , arise from the incineration of white dwarf stars .",
    "the other main class , core collapse sne , come from more massive stars and produce the sub - classes called type ib , type ic , and type ii .",
    "of the six historical sne in our galaxy that have occurred over the last millennium ( including cas a for which the sn itself apparently escaped detection ) , only kepler s sn has remained uncertain as to the type of the star that exploded .    today",
    "of course , what we observe is the expanding young supernova remnant ( snr ) that resulted from the explosion . by studying this snr across the electromagnetic spectrum",
    ", modern astronomers are still trying to discern a clear picture of the precursor star of this event .",
    "in doing so , they are hindered by the lack of an accurate distance to the object , which makes the derivation of even basic properties like the diameter or mean expansion velocity uncertain . in this paper",
    ", i will review the current observational status of this enigmatic object and point out some of the apparent inconsistencies in existing interpretations .",
    "kepler s snr is located at galactic coordinates @xmath0 and @xmath1 ( i.e. , nearly directly toward the galactic center from the sun but significantly out of the plane ) .",
    "the full extent of the remnant is most visible in radio and x - ray regimes , where a circle of diameter 200  encompasses the entire shell except for two `` ears '' of emission on the east and west sides ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "unfortunately , the distance to kepler s snr is only poorly constrained by observations to date .",
    "most recent literature cites the study by reynoso & goss ( 1999 ) and adopts a distance near 5 kpc .",
    "however , a careful reading of this paper shows that many authors misquote or misunderstand reynoso & goss s result .",
    "these authors use the h  i kinematics with a galactic rotation model to place a rather inaccurate `` lower limit '' of 4.8 @xmath2 1.4 kpc on the distance , and independently place an `` upper limit '' of 6.4 kpc based on the proposed association of the snr with an h  i cloud .",
    "kinematic distances are inherently uncertain along the line toward the galactic center .",
    "table 1 shows how some basic parameters for the snr depend critically on the assumed distance . in particular , note that the larger distances imply a very large distance off the galactic plane and , when combined with the observed current shock velocity , apparently require a very significant deceleration , which is not consistent with the absence of a well - defined reverse shock in the x - ray data .    in figure 1 , i show 6 cm vla radio ( delaney et al .",
    "2002 ) and 0.2 - 10 kev _ chandra _ x - ray observations ( hwang et al . 2000 ) of kepler s snr .",
    "the overall similarity is striking , showing a roughly spherical thick shell of emission brightest in the north .",
    "the apparent band of emission cutting across the middle from nw to se is largely an illusion , caused by projection effects from material on the front and back sides of the shell ( see optical section below ) .",
    "however , this apparent similarity may be deceiving .",
    "flat and steep radio spectrum deconvolutions look quite different from the total intensity maps , and soft ( 0.3 - 1.4 kev ) and hard ( 4 - 6 kev ) x - ray bands , either from _ chandra _ or _ xmm - newton _",
    "( cassam - chena et al .",
    "2004 ) also show different structures .",
    "( in particular , the harder x - rays form a distinct outer rim likely associated with the primary shock wave . )",
    "also , when one looks at the dynamics of the snr , discrepancies are seen .",
    "both radio and x - ray observations extend over a long enough baseline that expansion of the snr has been measured .",
    "hughes ( 1999 ) finds an x - ray expansion rate of r @xmath3 , which is nearly free expansion .",
    "this is almost twice that found in the radio ( r @xmath4 , dickel et al .",
    "1988 ; delaney et al . 2002 ) .",
    "the reason for this discrepancy is not understood .",
    "optical observations ( blair , long , & vancura 1991 ) are brightest in the nw , with the northern cap and isolated central patches of emission also visible ( see figure 2 ) .",
    "the optical data indicate substantial and variable foreground extinction , with e(b - v ) = 1.0 @xmath2 0.2 , consistent with and x - ray determined n(h ) = 5.0 @xmath5 .",
    "bandiera & van den bergh ( 1991 ) performed a careful study of the space velocity of the object , finding a value of 278 @xmath6 toward the nw , which is away from the galactic plane . assuming this motion is due to the precursor star ,",
    "this would account for the large angular distance off the galactic plane and the observed morphology in all bands , showing the brightest emission in the n and nw .",
    "the optical emission comes from two components : radiative shocks into dense , knotty structures ( presumably circumstellar mass loss ) , and smoother filamentary emission visible only in h@xmath7 from so - called nonradiative shocks ( e.g. blair et al .",
    "1991 ; sollerman et al .",
    "the radiative knots show enhanced [ n  ii]/h@xmath7 , indicative of probable enrichment from the precursor .",
    "interpretation of the broad line components in the nonradiative shocks ( e.g. chevalier , kirshner , & raymond 1980 ) indicate a current shock velocity of about 1750 @xmath2 250 @xmath6 .",
    "relatively little information is available in the infrared .",
    "the snr is small enough in angular size that _ iras _ data are not useful .",
    "however , douvion et al .",
    "( 2001 ) observed kepler s snr with thr _ infrared space observatory s _ isocam ( see figure 3 ) .",
    "the morphology of the @xmath812 @xmath9 m emission is very similar to the optical , and 6 - 16 @xmath9 m spectra are well - fitted by shock - heated dust models with t@xmath10 = 95 - 145 k , n@xmath11 of several thousand ( similar to optical [ s  ii ] densities ) , and t@xmath12 of several hundred thousand k. this makes it very likely that the _ iso _ emission arises primarily from dust heated directly by the primary shock front .",
    "scuba sub - mm observations at 450 @xmath9 m and 850 @xmath9 m by morgan et al .",
    "( 2003 ) were interpretted as indicating a large mass ( @xmath13 of cold ( t = 17 k ) dust in the remnant , but this result has been called into question ( dwek 2004 ) . upcoming _",
    "spitzer space telescope _",
    "observations may resolve this issue .",
    "the literature is extremely confusing on the issue of the sn type .",
    "baade ( 1943 ) reconstructed the historical light curve and claimed a type ia designation , a result that is still quoted in many recent papers .",
    "however , doggett & branch ( 1985 ) showed consistency with a type ii - l light curve , and schaefer ( 1996 ) has also called the historical curve and type ia designation into question .",
    "a decade ago , the preponderance of evidence seemed to point toward a core - collapse event , and much of this evidence is still relevant .",
    "a large distance off the galactic plane might be suggestive of a white dwarf precursor , but high space motion away from the plane and n - rich circumstellar material points to a massive runaway star from an earlier sn as the precursor for kepler s snr .",
    "borkowski et al .",
    "( 1992 , 1994 ) developed a massive star model that was consistent with observations available at that time .",
    "however , x - ray analyses in particular , from exosat ( smith et al . 1989 ; decourchelle & ballet 1994 ; rothenflug et al .",
    "1994 ) , asca ( kinugasa & tsunemi 1999 ) , _ chandra _ ( hwang et al . 2000 ) , and now _ xmm - newton _",
    "( cassam - chena et al .",
    "2004 ) have alternately claimed better fits to type ia or core collapse models .",
    "the modelling of _ xmm - newton _",
    "data by cassam - chena et al .",
    "( 2004 ) is the most careful and accurate to date .",
    "although these authors do not claim to have determined the sn type , their determination of si and fe abundances similar to type ia models and their lack of detection of overabundances of o , ne , ar , s as seen in core collapse objects such as cas a ( hughes et al . 2000 ) , is a strong indicator of a type ia event .",
    "i also note that , even with its exquisite sensitivity and resolving power , the _ chandra _ observation has failed to detect any hint of a stellar remnant ( quite in contrast to the situation with cas a ! ) .",
    "while the issue may not be closed , the pendulum has swung back toward a white dwarf precursor star .",
    "this is not an entirely comfortable situation .",
    "if the type ia designation is correct , then the closest example of our cosmological standard candle has some very peculiar properties !",
    "at least one significant near term advance is in the offing .",
    "recent optical _ hst _ acs images have been obtained ( see figure 4 ) that not only show the bright optical filaments in exquisite detail , but will permit the proper motion of key filaments to be measured . with a refined estimate of the shock velocity from x - ray and optical data , it should soon be possible to measure the distance to kepler s snr with relative precision .",
    "johannes kepler was an intriguing personality ( ferguson 2002 ) .",
    "he came from extremely humble beginnings , he possessed a fierce and staunch religious faith that was entwined with his world view but at odds with his contemporary culture , and he was a visionary scientist . while understanding the new star of 1604 was a sidelight for him ,",
    "i think he would be secretly pleased to know that his name has been attached to this equally intriguing supernova remnant .",
