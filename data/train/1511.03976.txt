    "amongst the higher curvature theories of gravity , lovelock theory @xcite , introduced by david lovelock @xcite , the action of which contains higher order curvature terms , is the most general second order gravity theory in higher dimensional spacetimes .",
    "lovelock gravity @xcite is a suitable and natural modification to higher dimensional scenarios in the sense that the additions to the einstein action become divergence terms below a critical dimension , and hence they do not contribute to the equations of motion in the lower dimensions .",
    "the lovelock theories are exceptional , among the larger class of general higher curvature theories , in that the resulting field equations are just second derivatives of the metric function , and hence free from many pathologies that arise in higher curvature gravity .",
    "they are also shown to be free from ghosts when expanding about flat spacetime @xcite .",
    "the lovelock action goes back to the einstein - hilbert in four dimensions and contains corrections inspired by string theory to the einstein - hilbert action @xcite .",
    "the lovelock gravities help us to explore in depth several conceptual issues of gravity in a much broader setup .",
    "most interestingly , we can include features of black holes such as their existence and uniqueness theorems , their thermodynamical properties and their horizon structure , etc . since their inception",
    ", significant attention has been given to black hole solutions , including their formation , stability , and thermodynamics .",
    "the most extensive research done on the einstein - gauss - bonnet gravity are with second order curvature corrections @xcite .",
    "it turns out that the lagrangian and field equations are very complicated in the third order lovelock gravity , but still there are a large number of works extending various black hole solutions to the third order lovelock gravity @xcite .",
    "recently , some works have been extended to general lovelock gravity to find the exact solutions and their thermodynamical properties @xcite .",
    "although most of the known black hole solutions in lovelock gravity are in vacuum , we may raise the question of having black hole solutions with source .",
    "hence , many authors have investigated the exact black hole solutions with source such as a string cloud background , for instance , in the einstein - gauss - bonnet gravity @xcite , and also in the third order lovelock gravity @xcite .",
    "these days studying quantum effects of black holes is the most important route to a theory of quantum gravity . hawking radiation @xcite is the most significant phenomenon and almost the only theoretical prediction for quantum effects in gravity so far .",
    "furthermore , the einstein theory itself has to be possibly modified to explain major astrophysical observations disagreeing with its predictions . in the development of physical theories , e.g. constructing quantum gravities , unifying gravity with the rest of fundamental interactions or regularization schemes in the renormalization , etc , extending the spacetime dimension has often provided solutions for many problems . in such circumstances",
    "it is quite reasonable to consider modifications to the einstein gravity in higher dimensions . on the other hand , string theory as one of strong candidates for quantum gravity and unified theories , contains such aspects . whether or not string theory is an ultimate theory of the universe",
    ", it will contribute to development of a final theory with its rich insights . in this sense to see effects of strings in modified gravity is a useful endeavor .",
    "also , the universe can be represented as a collection of extended objects and one - dimensional strings , which is the most popular candidate for such fundamental objects .",
    "it may be noted that the study of einstein s equations coupled with a cloud of strings may be very important because relativistic strings at a classical level can be used to construct applicable models @xcite .",
    "the study of black holes in string cloud models was pioneered by letelier @xcite modifying the schwarzschild solution for a cloud of strings as a source @xcite , which was recently extended to gauss - bonnet gravity @xcite and also to lovelock gravity @xcite .",
    "a string cloud background makes a profound influence on horizon structure and thermodynamical quantities but the entropy is not changed .    in this paper , we are concerned with the black hole solutions of general lovelock theory in the string cloud model , and we will try to understand how higher - curvature corrections due to lovelock gravity and the background string change the qualitative thermodynamics of lovelock black holes as we know from our experience with black holes .",
    "the examination of thermodynamical properties of black holes draws a great deal of attention to quantum gravity , and extensive studies in this direction are being done . studying thermodynamics of lovelock black holes",
    "was started by myers and simon @xcite .",
    "research involving the lovelock black holes in the background of clouds of strings has been done @xcite . here",
    ", we wish to also examine general thermodynamical properties of black holes in arbitrary dimensions for string cloud models .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii we begin by examining the lovelock action , which is a modification of the einstein - hilbert action , and also derive energy momentum tensors for a cloud of strings .",
    "the thermodynamics of a spherically symmetric lovelock black hole solution in this theory is examined in sec .",
    "the thermodynamical stability is also discussed and we demonstrate that hawking - page phase transition is possible .",
    "iv summarizes the results . in the appendix",
    "we discuss how locations of horizons and curvature singular points are affected by changing parameters , especially the mass parameter .",
    "we used units that fix @xmath0 and the metric signature , @xmath1 .",
    "lovelock gravity is the most general higher dimensional second order theory of gravity which is free of ghosts .",
    "lovelock gravity action in @xmath2 dimensions reads @xcite @xmath3 where @xmath4 is an arbitrary constant , @xmath5 is the euler density and the generalized kronecker delta @xmath6 is totally antisymmetric in both sets of indices . @xmath7 and @xmath8 for even dimensions and @xmath9 for odd dimensions . here",

    "it has been shown by wheeler @xcite that equations of motion for general vacuum solutions of the lovelock action in static spherically symmetric spacetimes are obtained by solving a polynomial equation .",
    "we assume @xmath35 and then the @xmath36 component of eq .",
    "( [ einstein eq ] ) reads @xmath37 with @xmath38 by @xmath39 here @xmath40 is an integration constant related to the arnowitt - deser - misner(adm ) mass defined by @xmath41}\\omega_0,\\ ] ] and @xmath42 is related to the energy momentum tensor , explicitly written as @xmath43 the general form of the energy momentum tensor @xmath44 for static spherically symmetric spacetimes is given by @xmath45 where @xmath46 is a constant .",
    "the dominant energy condition allows only @xmath47 and @xmath48 and the causality condition further constrains @xmath46 to @xmath49 @xcite . in a sense",

    "in this section , we present the exact thermodynamical quantities associated with the lovelock black solution in eq .  ( [ polysol ] ) . based on the general results in the last section we find general thermodynamical quantities in terms of a horizon radius .",

    "that is , from the vanishing total derivative @xmath77 for the function @xmath78 , we can write the hawking temperature as @xmath79 using derivatives of @xmath58 with respect to @xmath68 and @xmath52 , @xmath80 we obtain the hawking temperature @xmath81 @xmath69 diverges at a curvature singular point @xmath82 . without a source term @xmath64 , @xmath69 becomes the expression @xcite @xmath83 in the following discussion let us assume @xmath84 is the greatest horizon radius and @xmath85 is the greatest singular point , and for simplicity take @xmath86 .",
    "if the highest order coefficient is positive , e.g. @xmath87 , then the slope at the greatest zero is nonnegative , i.e. @xmath88 . on the other hand , we can see that due to the asymptotic flatness of @xmath51 as @xmath52 goes to infinity , the quantity @xmath89 indicating a curvature singular point asymptotically goes to infinity for @xmath90 .",

    "this means that between @xmath103 and @xmath104 , if there exists a region where @xmath105 is positive , then there must be points where @xmath106 .",
    "entropy can also be expressed in a simple way and it can be easily seen that the condition @xmath91 guarantees positivity of entropy . using the first law of thermodynamics , @xmath107 , @xmath108 from eq .",
    "( [ dwdfdr ] ) we see that it is a general result that entropy should not depend on the energy momentum tensor at all .",
    "this result coincides with the corresponding case in vacuum @xcite . by integration",
    "we get the entropy @xmath109 where an arbitrary additive constant has been omitted . with the above discussion @xmath110 for any @xmath111",
