    "during diffusive shock acceleration ( dsa ) cosmic rays ( cr ) gain energy by repeatedly passing back and forth between the upstream and downstream plasmas ( krymskii 1977 , axford et al 1977 , bell 1978 , blandford & ostriker 1978 ) .",
    "cr diffuse ahead of the shock to form a precursor with an exponential scaleheight @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the shock velocity and @xmath2 is the cr diffusion coefficient upstream of the shock .",
    "the average dwell - time spent upstream of the shock between successive shock crossings is @xmath3 for relativistic particles ( bell 2012 ) .",
    "this , along with the corresponding downstream dwell - time , determines the rate at which cr are accelerated .",
    "lagage & cesarsky ( 1983a , b ) showed that the time taken for cr acceleration is @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the downstream diffusion coefficient and @xmath6 is the downstream fluid velocity in the shock rest frame . since @xmath7 for a strong shock it might appear that the downstream dwell - time determines the acceleration rate , but we can expect @xmath8 partly because the magnetic field is increased by compression by the shock , partly because the compressed downstream magnetic field is more closely perpendicular to the shock normal , and partly because the downstream field is disturbed and more irregular after passing through the shock .",
    "if the downstream and upstream dwell - times are the same @xmath9 .",
    "a further common assumption is that bohm diffusion applies : @xmath10 or @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the cr larmor radius .",
    "this assumes a diffusion model in which cr are scattered by irregularities in the magnetic field such that the scattering mean free path is of the order of the cr larmor radius .",
    "there is some observational evidence for bohm diffusion ( stage et al 2006 , uchiyama et al 2007 ) .",
    "furthermore if the mean free path were much larger than a larmor radius acceleration by snr to the knee in the galactic cr spectrum would be very difficult .",
    "the maximum cr energy is determined by the condition that @xmath13 can not exceed the age @xmath14 of an snr ( lagage & cesarsky 1983a , b ) . assuming @xmath10 , the maximum cr energy @xmath15 in ev",
    "is given by @xmath16pev where @xmath17 is the upstream magnetic field in microgauss , @xmath18 is the shock velocity in units of 10,000 km s@xmath19 and @xmath20 is the snr age in 1000 s of years . for a typical young snr expanding into the interstellar medium without magnetic field amplification @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 , giving @xmath24pev which falls a factor of @xmath25 short of that required to explain the galactic cr spectrum .",
    "snr in the sedov phase do not fare better .",
    "their shock velocities decrease in proportion to @xmath26 and @xmath27 , so little benefit accrues from their larger age and radius .",
    "this posed a serious problem for diffusive shock acceleration as an explanation of the galactic spectrum until it was shown that a plasma instability driven by streaming cr in the upstream precursor could amplify the magnetic field ahead of the shock and facilitate rapid acceleration to higher energies ( lucek & bell 2000 , bell 2004 , 2005 ) .",
    "the phenomenon of magnetic field amplification provides a mechanism by which the cr energy can be raised significantly beyond 0.01pev , but there remains the question of why the fields are amplified to the observed magnitude , up to 100 s @xmath28 in the historical snr ( vink & laming 2003 , berezhko et al 2003 , vlk et al 2005 ) , and why cr are accelerated to a few pev rather than 0.1 or 10 pev .",
    "we try to answer these questions by examining the self - consistent interaction between streaming cr , behaving kinetically , and the upstream plasma behaving magnetohydrodynamically .",
    "it has been known for many years that the escape of cr upstream of the shock is an important part of the overall acceleration process as discussed below in the final paragraphs of section 3 .",
    "we find that the combined cr - mhd system organises itself to allow a suitable number of cr to escape upstream . the cr drive magnetic field amplification which in turn regulates the number of escaping cr .",
    "if a smaller number of cr escaped , the magnetic field would be insufficiently amplified to confine and accelerate the cr .",
    "if a larger number of cr escaped , the magnetic field would grow too rapidly to allow their escape .",
    "hence a self - regulating system is set up that determines the number and maximum energy of escaping cr .",
    "the paper is organised as follows .",
    "sections 2 and 3 present approximate calculations showing how a limit on the cr energy is placed by the need for cr to drive magnetic field amplification by escaping upstream .",
    "sections 4 to 7 describe vlasov - fokker - planck ( vfp ) simulations that support the arguments of sections 2 and 3 .",
    "sections 8 to 11 apply the results to supernova remnants and the galactic cosmic ray spectrum . readers unfamiliar with vfp simulations may wish to read sections 1 to 3 and 8 to 11 before returning to the computational validation and illustration in sections 4 to 7 .",
    "we assume that magnetic field is generated by the non - resonant hybrid ( nrh ) instability described by bell ( 2004 ) .",
    "this is one of a class of plasma instabilities driven by cr streaming . in its simplest form , cr have a larmor radius much greater than the wavelength of spiral perturbations in a zeroth order uniform magnetic field .",
    "because of their large larmor radius the streaming cr , carrying an electric current density @xmath29 , are essentially undeflected by the perturbed field but the @xmath30 force acts towards the centre of the spiral . a corresponding reactive force acts on the background plasma to expand the spiral .",
    "this stretches and increases the magnitude of the perturbed magnetic field , thereby increasing the @xmath30 force in a positive feedback loop that drives the instability .",
    "nrh appears to be the most rapidly growing instability driven by cr streaming on a relevant scalelength .",
    "other instabilities that have attracted significant attention are the resonant alfven instability ( kulsrud & pearce 1969 , wentzel 1974 ) that grows with spatial wavelengths spatially resonant with the cr larmor radius and the weibel instability ( weibel 1959 ) that grows quickly on the spatial scale of an electron or proton collisionless skin depth , @xmath31 km , @xmath32 .",
    "the weibel instability is important for interactions engaging thermal or mildly suprathermal electrons and ions , and may be effective for cr acceleration to low energies , but it grows on a scale too small to scatter pev ions which have a larmor radius of @xmath33 .",
    "the alfven instability grows on the desired spatial scale but grows less quickly than the nrh instability in the snr shock environment .",
    "instabilities that grow on scales larger than the cr larmor radius ( bykov et al 2011 , drury & falle 1986 , drury & downes 2012 , malkov & diamond 2009 , rogachevskii et al 2012 , schure & bell 2011 ) tend to have longer growth times but turbulent amplification may increase the growth rate ( bykov et al 2011 ) . an extended discussion of instabilities driven by cosmic ray streaming can be found in schure et al ( 2012 ) .    from the lagage & cesarsky ( 1983a , b ) limit",
    "as described in section 1 it is clear that proton acceleration to a few pev is only possible if the magnetic field is strongly amplified above its characteristic interstellar value of a few @xmath34 .",
    "the following argument places an upper limit on the maximum energy of a cr that can be strongly scattered by a magnetic field growing on the scale of a cr larmor radius .",
    "the background thermal plasma is highly magnetised on the scale of a pev cr larmor radius .",
    "consequently the magnetic field is ` frozen in ' to the thermal plasma .",
    "magnetic field amplification occurs as the plasma moves and stretches field lines . assuming the perturbed magnetic field does not far exceed the initial field",
    ", the @xmath30 force displaces a plasma element a maximum distance @xmath35 in time @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the initial seed field . for the stretched magnetic field to strongly scatter cr as required for bohm diffusion the displacement must grow to the order of a cr larmor radius , that is @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the cr energy in ev .",
    "the cr current density @xmath29 carries an energy flux @xmath40 in the upstream plasma rest frame which can not far exceed the energy flux @xmath41 carried by the upstream plasma into the shock , where @xmath42 is the upstream mass density .",
    "we define a cr acceleration efficiency @xmath43 such that @xmath44 .",
    "we then have two equations : @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "when combined , they yield a cr energy @xmath47 .",
    "this expression for @xmath39 is equivalent to @xmath48pev where @xmath18 is the shock velocity in units of @xmath49 , @xmath50 is the seed magnetic field in @xmath51 from which amplification begins , and @xmath20 is the time in 1000 s of years . characteristically for young snr , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath52 ( see appendix a ) and @xmath53 where the magnetic field of a few @xmath51 represents the seed field from which the instability grows . with these estimates , @xmath54pev , which is an order of magnitude less than the energy of the knee .",
    "this estimate is independent of any detailed instability theory except for the assumption that magnetic field amplification takes place through plasma motions generated by the @xmath30 force acting on the scale of a cr larmor radius .",
    "it highlights the difficulty of amplifying magnetic field by orders of magnitude on the scale of the larmor radius of a pev proton and the need for an instability that can provide non - linear growth of the magnetic field .",
    "the nrh instability offers a way round this difficulty by initially growing very rapidly on a scale much less than the cr larmor radius .",
    "since the small - scale magnetic field grows unstably the @xmath30 force grows exponentially in time .",
    "the scale - size increases to the cr larmor radius during non - linear growth .",
    "the nrh growth rate is @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the zeroth order magnetic field and @xmath57 is the wavenumber on which the instability grows .",
    "the maximum nrh growth rate is @xmath58 which occurs at a wavenumber @xmath59 .",
    "@xmath60 is @xmath61 times larger than the nrh growth rate for @xmath62 , thus allowing the magnetic field and the @xmath30 force to increase rapidly .",
    "the nrh and alfven growth rates are similar at @xmath62 ( see appendix e and bell 2004 ) . using the above nomenclature , @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the alfven speed , @xmath65 and @xmath66 is the electron density in @xmath67 . for a discussion of the value of @xmath43 see appendix a and bell ( 2004 ) .",
    "the growth time of the fastest growing mode is then @xmath68 years where @xmath69 is the energy in pev of the cr driving the instability .",
    "years for @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath22 which implies that even the nrh instability struggles to amplify the magnetic field sufficiently to accelerate cr to pev energies in the historical snr . for growth by many e - folding the nrh instability must be driven by cr with energies less than 1pev .        as remarked above",
    ", the fastest growing mode grows on a scale @xmath73 whereas efficient cr scattering requires fluctuations in the magnetic field on a scale @xmath12 .",
    "the above analysis showed that @xmath74 .",
    "the instability initially grows on a scale too small to effectively scatter pev cr .",
    "two factors save the situation .",
    "firstly , as the magnetic field grows from a few @xmath75 g to a few hundred @xmath75 g the cr larmor radius decreases by the corresponding factor of @xmath25 . secondly , the characteristic scalelength of the structured magnetic field increases during non - linear growth of the instability .",
    "figure 1 is drawn from figures 3 and 4 of bell ( 2004 ) .",
    "the graph of energy densities shows how the magnitude of the magnetic field grows to many times its seed value in a time @xmath76 .",
    "the characteristic scalelength grows during this time as shown by the grey - scale images . by the time @xmath77 the scalelength has grown to the size of the computational box from its initially much smaller scale .",
    "both @xmath57 and @xmath12 decrease by a large factor by the time @xmath78 .",
    "the simulation reproduced in figure 1 had a fixed cr current so it was impossible to demonstrate strong cr scattering by the magnetic field after @xmath79 , but the figure provides strong evidence for rapid initial growth of the fastest growing modes into large scale magnetic structures able to scatter cr on the scale of a larmor radius .",
    "the previous section does not provide an estimate of the magnitude of the amplified magnetic field , but it does define conditions under which strong magnetic field amplification occurs .",
    "cr acceleration to pev energies requires strong magnetic field amplification which fixes the number of instability e - foldings to the range 5 - 10 . this in turn fixes the cr current .",
    "from figure 1 we take the condition for strong magnetic field amplification in a particular volume of upstream plasma to be that @xmath80 in the time before the shock overtakes it .",
    "since @xmath81 , the condition for field amplification is @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the total electric charge of cr passing through unit surface area upstream of the shock before the shock arrives .",
    "( it makes no difference whether the cr passing through the plasma have high or low energies .",
    "it is only the number of cr escaping upstream that counts . ) since only the highest energy cr escape , the areal charge @xmath83 is carried by the highest energy cr being accelerated .",
    "the larmor radius of a pev proton in the interstellar medium is comparable with the radius of the historical snr and its scattering mean free path is very much greater than the snr radius .",
    "these escaping cr pass into the interstellar medium with low probability of further encounter with the snr shock .",
    "strongly scattered cr at lower energies are confined by the shock and are advected away downstream after acceleration .",
    "suppose that the cr distribution follows a @xmath84 power law up to a momentum @xmath85 , then in steady state the electrical current of cr escaping in a small band of energies above the energy @xmath86 is @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the isotropic part of the cr distribution in momentum space at the shock .",
    "equation ( 2 ) is derived from equation ( 11a ) below by integrating in space across the shock and deriving the rate at which cr reach the momentum @xmath85 .",
    "the derivation can be found in appendix b. in comparison the cr pressure at the shock , where the cr distribution extends down to @xmath89 and @xmath90 is the proton mass is @xmath91 giving @xmath92 where we have assumed @xmath93 for a cr distribution extending from 1gev to 1pev . the condition for magnetic field amplification that @xmath94 can be rearranged to give a value for @xmath15 : @xmath95 which is equivalent to @xmath96 for characteristic values ( @xmath22 , @xmath72 , @xmath97 , @xmath98 ) @xmath99tev .",
    "as expected from the above discussion , this falls short of the few pev required to explain galactic cr .",
    "this will be discussed further in section 8 .",
    "zirakashvili et al ( 2008a , b ) developed a related analytic model of the excitation of the nrh instability and cr confinement upstream of the shock .",
    "they derived an estimate for the maximum cr energy with a similar dependency on @xmath100 in the numerator of their equation ( 19 ) but with an additional denominator that depends on the magnitude of the amplified magnetic field .",
    "their analysis operates at a more detailed level than ours since they consider the growth in amplitude of the amplified magnetic field over a range of scales and small angle cr scattering by small scale field .",
    "however , the dominant physics is similar in their analysis and ours , and their estimate of the cr energy ( equation ( 19 ) ) is similar to that in our equation ( 6 ) .",
    "note that the magnetic field does not enter into the estimation of the maximum energy cr in equation ( 6 ) .",
    "the magnetic field is assumed to grow to whatever magnitude and spatial scale required to confine cr at energies less than @xmath15 .",
    "this assumption is justified on the basis that the magnitude of the field increases by a substantial numerical factor in time @xmath101 even in the non - linear regime and that this is accompanied by rapid growth in characteristic spatial scale .",
    "for example , the magnetic field and its spatial scale are very much larger in figure 1 when @xmath102 than when @xmath103 even though the time is different by a factor of only @xmath104 . allowing the field to grow for just a little longer gives a much larger magnetic field and spatial scale .",
    "consequently the primary parameter is not the magnitude of the magnetic field but the charge carried by escaping cr .",
    "it is clear that magnetic field amplification is only possible if a population of high energy cr escape upstream of the shock . a magnetic field capable of stopping their escape is only produced after the areal charge @xmath83 has escaped .",
    "thus cr escape upstream of the shock is an essential aspect of diffusive shock acceleration when magnetic field amplification is operational .",
    "if a charge @xmath83 has not passed through a particular point upstream of the shock then cr can not be confined at that distance from the shock .",
    "previous authors have also concluded that cr escape upstream is inevitable , but generally for different reasons .",
    "one possibility is that cr escape through filamentary cavities in the magnetic field ( reville & bell 2012 , 2013 ) but usually it is assumed that cr escape at a free escape boundary in position or momentum .",
    "free escape boundaries were introduced at an early stage in the development of shock acceleration theory ( ellison et al 1981 ) .",
    "it was appreciated that steady state models were impossible without cr escape ( ellison & eichler , 1984 , berezhko & ellison 1999 , malkov et al 2000 ) .",
    "the standard @xmath105 test particle energy spectrum at strong shocks diverges if integrated to infinite energy .",
    "the divergence is even stronger if non - linear cr feedback onto the shock structure is included since the relativistic cr pressure increases the density jump at the shock resulting in a spectrum flatter than @xmath105 at high cr energy .",
    "however , the conditions for a steady state solution do not present a compelling argument for a free escape boundary since time - dependent solutions offer an acceptable option . indeed the lagage & cesarsky limit on cr energy is based on the assumption that the maximum cr energy increases with time .",
    "the case for cr escape was strengthened by the recognition that magnetic field amplification is essential since there will always be a distance upstream at which amplification is inoperative and cr must escape . similarly , there must always be an upper limit to the spatial scale to which field is amplified and a corresponding limit , through the larmor radius , on the momentum to which cr can be accelerated .",
    "this led to the imposition of a free escape boundary either at an imposed distance upstream of the shock ( eg caprioli et al 2010b , ohira et al 2010 ) or at an imposed cr momentum ( eg ellison & bykov 2011 ) . whether the free escape boundary is imposed in momentum or configuration space , the momentum at which cr escape depends on the magnetic field .",
    "some authors ( eg ptuskin et al 2010 ) assume that the field is amplified until the magnetic energy density reaches a given fraction of @xmath106 . the fractional magnetic energy density can be chosen to match observation ( ptuskin et al 2010 , vlk et al 2005 ) .",
    "alternatively the field can be chosen to match the saturation value estimated by bell ( 2004 ) .",
    "others ( caprioli et al 2010a , drury 2011 ) choose a mathematical form for the amplified magnetic field that allows for multiple possibilites .",
    "ptsukin & zirakashvili ( 2003 ) and caprioli et al ( 2009a , b , 2010b ) include magnetic field generation due to the resonant instability as it develops ahead of the shock .",
    "vladimirov et al ( 2006 ) include magnetic field generation in response to gradients in the cr pressure .",
    "ellison et al ( 2012 ) choose an amplified magnetic field suitable for snr expansion into a circumstellar wind .",
    "in contrast to the above , cr escape in our model is determined by the escaping cr electric charge rather than the magnetic field generated in the upstream plasma , although magnetic field amplification is implicitly required by our model .",
    "reville et al ( 2009 ) also used the escaping flux to calculate growth rates in an effort to motivate a realistic free - escape boundary location in their steady - state non - linear model .",
    "their discussion on self - regulation of cr precursors however did not extend to the maximum cr energy .",
    "we now set out to test the above conclusions as far as we are able with a numerical model that includes the self - consistent interaction of cr modelled kinetically with a background plasma modelled magnetohydrodynamically .",
    "standard mhd equations describe the background plasma except that a @xmath107 force is added to the momentum equation : @xmath108 as described in lucek & bell ( 2000 ) and bell ( 2004 ) .",
    "the cr distribution function @xmath109 at position @xmath110 and momentum @xmath111 is defined in the local fluid rest frame and evolves according to the vlasov - fokker - planck ( vfp ) equation @xmath112 where @xmath113 is an optional collision term included to represent scattering by magnetic fluctuations on a small scale .",
    "the electric field is zero in the local fluid rest frame .",
    "quadratic terms in the local fluid velocity @xmath114 are neglected on the assumption that @xmath115 .",
    "the cr current @xmath29 , required for insertion into the mhd momentum equation , is calculated by integration over @xmath116 in momentum space .",
    "the magnetic field in the cr kinetic equation is taken from the mhd calculation .    as in lucek & bell ( 2000 ) and bell ( 2004 )",
    "three spatial dimensions are needed to represent the turbulence adequately . since our aim is to investigate the mutual interactions of magnetic field amplification , cr acceleration and cr escape upstream of the shock we need to model the complete system including the shock and the complete cr precursor . because we model the detailed interaction between the cr and the distorted magnetic field we need to resolve the cr larmor radius in configuration space and the rotation of cr trajectories in momentum space . as a consequence",
    "the numerical model should be 6-dimensional in momentum - configuration space with spatial scales extending from the cr larmor radius of the lowest energy cr to the precursor scaleheight of the highest energy cr",
    ". this would be impossible without extraordinary computational resources so our strategy is to design a computational model that includes all the important processes at a minimal level .",
    "we retain the three dimensions in configuration space but limit the range of cr momentum to a factor of 10 so that we do not have to resolve the larmor radius of very low energy cr .",
    "we choose a shock velocity @xmath117 to keep the ratio of the cr to the mhd timescale to a minimum while staying close to the range of conceivable snr expansion speeds .",
    "our greatest approximations are made in the momentum space representation of the cr distribution function since this is the aspect of the calculation in which the number of dimensions can be reduced .",
    "the vlasov - fokker - planck ( vfp ) equation ( equation 8) is important in the physics of laser - produced plasmas where it is solved in finite difference form to model electron transport .",
    "the successful use of vfp simulation to model electron transport in laser - produced plasmas stretches back more than 30 years ( bell et al , 1981 ) so it is natural to apply the techniques to cr which obey the same equation .",
    "the distribution function @xmath118 of charged particles ( cosmic rays or energetic electrons ) is usually represented in spherical co - ordinates ( @xmath119,@xmath120,@xmath121 ) in momentum space .",
    "a common representation of the distribution function is as a sum of spherical harmonics : @xmath122 where @xmath123 is the coefficient for the ( @xmath124,@xmath90 ) spherical harmonic .",
    "@xmath123 is function of time , position and magnitude of momentum @xmath119 .",
    "the spherical harmonics decribe the angular structure on shells of constant magnitude of momentum .",
    "reviews of the vfp technique , or papers containing a significant review element , are bell et al ( 2006 ) , tzoufras et al ( 2011 ) and thomas et al ( 2012 ) . for information on the application of vfp techniques",
    "to cr acceleration the reader is referred to reville & bell ( 2013 ) which includes an appendix setting out the full vfp equations for a spherical harmonic expansion .",
    "bell , schure & reville ( 2012 ) also apply vfp techniques to cr acceleration .",
    "the use of an expansion in tensors ( used here ) as an alternative to spherical harmonics is discussed by schure & bell ( 2012 ) .",
    "vfp simulation was used by bell et al ( 2011 ) for the calculation of cr acceleration by oblique shocks .",
    "they found that an expansion to 15th harmonic could be needed for oblique shocks because of the abrupt change in magnetic field direction at the shock , but that only a few harmonics are needed for quasi - parallel shocks .",
    "here we reduce the computational size of the problem by modelling parallel shocks in which the zeroth order magnetic field is parallel to the shock normal .",
    "there are good reasons to suppose that the first few terms in the expansion capture the essential physics .",
    "firstly , as shown by bell ( 2004 ) the nrh instability is driven by the cr current density @xmath29 .",
    "higher order anisotropies do not directly contribute to the instability .",
    "secondly , the cr precursor scaleheight is @xmath125 times the cr scattering mean free path in standard dsa theory .",
    "dsa theory is based on the diffusive approximation in which only the first order anisotropy is needed and only the first two terms ( isotropy and drift anisotropy ) in the harmonic expansion are retained . in diffusion theory",
    "the higher order anisotropies are damped by scattering .",
    "hence it might be supposed that only the first two terms are needed and an adequate representation of the cr distribution function might be @xmath126 .",
    "this ` @xmath127 ' expansion allows free cr propagation along magnetic field lines but restricts transport across the magnetic field because the direction of the anisotropic drift term is rotated by the field .",
    "however , this expansion omits an essential feature of cr transport . it does not allow cr to gyrate as they travel along a magnetic field line .",
    "the @xmath127 expansion allows cr to propagate along field lines and separately it allows cr to gyrate around field lines , but it does not allow cr to do both at the same time .",
    "spiral trajectories require the inclusion of the off - diagonal components of the stress tensor @xmath128 . without the stress tensor ,",
    "cr can not resonantly interact in space with magnetic perturbations on the scale of a larmor radius .",
    "clearly this would rule out the alfven instability , and more surprising it also rules out the nrh instability .",
    "the role of the stress tensor is discussed by schure et al ( 2011 ) in which the linear nrh dispersion relation is derived with the perturbed cr distribution expressed as a tensor expansion .",
    "we proceed on the basis that the cr distribution function may be adequately represented by an isotropic part ( 0th order in @xmath129 ) plus a drift component ( 1st order in @xmath129 ) plus a term representing the stress tensor ( 2nd order in @xmath129 ) .",
    "this second order expansion is more easily represented in the equivalent tensor notation instead of spherical harmonics : @xmath130 where the trace of @xmath131 is zero because it is already accounted for in the isotropic term @xmath88 . following johnston ( 1960 ) the reduced vlasov equation for the cr distribution function is then : @xmath132 @xmath133 @xmath134 @xmath135 where",
    "quadratic order terms in the velocity @xmath114 have been neglected and we have omitted terms involving @xmath136 times a gradient of @xmath114 apart from the term in equation ( 11a ) for the evolution of @xmath88 .",
    "this amounts to the neglect of second order fermi acceleration and acceleration resulting from shear motions in the background hydrodynamics . in our problem , these processes are small in comparison with acceleration at the shock .",
    "we have chosen to terminate the set of equations at equation ( 11c ) by setting @xmath137 to zero . additionally , we soften the termination of the tensor expansion by replacing the magnetic rotation in equation ( 11c ) by a damping term with a damping rate equal to the magnetic gyration frequency .",
    "the logic of this approximation is that random rotation of the stress tensor anisotropy leads to its damping .",
    "a similar assumption underlies bohm diffusion which replaces rotation of @xmath138 by a damping rate , thereby terminating the tensor expansion at @xmath138 whereas we terminate it at @xmath131 .",
    "our approximation makes intuitive sense , and we support it in appendices d and e by examining its effect on propagating modes and on the nrh instability .",
    "the notation is simplified by introducing the vector @xmath139 related to shear and vorticity ( @xmath140 ) in cr motion to represent the off - diagonal components of the stress tensor .",
    "the on - diagonal components of @xmath131 ( @xmath141 ) are approximately accounted for by multiplying the @xmath142 term in equation ( 11b ) by 9/5 to allow for the stress tensor contribution to compressional waves and to allow freely streaming cr to propagate at @xmath143 instead of @xmath144 , as shown in appendix d. the equations to be solved ( their derivation is given in appendix c ) are then @xmath145 @xmath146 @xmath147 equivalently , expressed in vector notation , @xmath148 @xmath149 @xmath150 where @xmath151 is the vector cr larmor frequency and we take @xmath152 .",
    "the presence of the curls of @xmath153 and @xmath154 facilitates the propagation of transverse modes in @xmath153 and @xmath154 as needed for helical motion along magnetic field lines or cr propagation at an angle to the wavevector @xmath155 .",
    "the termination of the harmonic expansion at the stress tensor makes the computation tractable with available resources .",

    "the difference between @xmath302 and @xmath303 may be explained by integration over the magnetic structures on scales varying by six orders of magnitude corresponding to the difference between the larmor radii of gev and pev protons .",
    "if this is the case , most of the magnetic energy at the shock resides at scalelengths too short to accelerate cr to pev energies . the magnetic field inferred from x - ray synchrotron observations of a snr shock",

    "however , if the cr spectrum connects smoothly across the knee and the spectrum beyond the knee of escaping cr matches observation as shown to be possible in section 9 then it follows that the cr energy input is sufficient to match the galactic energy budget .",
    "the central message of this paper is that cr of a given energy escape freely ahead of a shock until magnetic field amplification takes place to inhibit propagation .",
