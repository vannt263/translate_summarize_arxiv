    "in this paper we establish an improvement of flatness result for a generalized nonlocal allen - cahn equation @xmath6 where  @xmath7 is an elliptic scaling invariant operator of order  @xmath1 , of the form @xmath8 the typical example of nonlinearity that we take into account is when @xmath9 is ( minus ) the derivative of a double - well potential @xmath10 . also , throughout the paper , we assume that the measure @xmath11 in  , which is often called in jargon the `` spectral measure '' , satisfies @xmath12 equations as in   naturally arise in several contexts , such as phase transitions , atom dislocations in crystals , mathematical biology , etc .",
    "( see e.g. section  2 in  @xcite , the appendix in  @xcite , the introduction in  @xcite , and also  @xcite and the references therein for a series of motivations under different perspectives ) .",
    "motivated by a celebrated conjecture by ennio de  giorgi in  @xcite , a natural problem in phase transitions is whether or not all the solutions ( under appropriate energetic or geometric assumptions ) are 1d profiles , i.e. increasing functions of only one euclidean variable .",
    "the goal this paper is to address this symmetry problem for the nonlocal phase transition equation  @xmath13 , and , even more generally , for equations as in  , in the _ genuinely nonlocal regime _ in which  @xmath1 .",
    "we use the wording _",
    "genuinely nonlocal regime _ for the following reason .",
    "although for all  @xmath14 the diffusion operators  @xmath15 are nonlocal , when studying asymptotic properties ( at large scales ) of the nonlocal phase transition equations one finds very different behaviors in the two regimes @xmath4 and @xmath1 .",
    "namely , when  @xmath4 , the interfaces between the two phases exhibit a local behavior at a large scale ( in spite of the nonlocal character of the problem ) and the phase separation is related to the minimization of the classical perimeter functional ( similarly as in the case of the laplacian  @xmath16 as given by the classical @xmath17convergence result of modica and mortola @xcite ) .",
    "conversely , in the genuinely nonlocal regime  @xmath1 , the interface maintains a nonlocal character at any scale and the phase separation is described by a nonlocal perimeter functional introduced by caffarelli , roquejoffre and savin in  @xcite . a rigorous statement of the previous heuristic description",
    "was proven by savin and the third author in  @xcite through @xmath17convergence results .",
    "in this paper we prove that asymptotically flat phase transitions are 1d , i.e. depend only on one euclidean variable . as a consequence",
    "we obtain several new classification results for entire minimizers of nonlocal phase transitions along the lines of the conjecture of de  giorgi .",
    "these main results will be collected in theorems  [ c:1 ] , [ c:2 ] , [ c:3bis ] , [ c:3 ] and  [ c:3tris ] and discussed in details in the forthcoming subsection  [ se:14 ] .    as a matter of fact",
    ", the cornerstone for these theorems is an `` improvement of flatness '' result , which is contained in theorem  [ thm : improvement ] and which will be presented in subsection  [ sub13 ] .",
    "next we introduce the mathematical framework in which we work , by listing the precise assumptions on the operator  @xmath7 and on the nonlinearity  @xmath9 which are involved in the main equation  .",
    "this is done in subsections  [ sub11 ] and  [ sub12 ] .",
    "let us however tell in advance that  @xmath18 and  @xmath19 trivially satisfy the assumptions given in subsections  [ sub11 ] and  [ sub12 ] and thus the reader who is interested only in this model equation can skip subsections  [ sub11 ] and  [ sub12 ] and go straight to subsections  [ sub13 ] and  [ se:14 ] to read the main results .",
    "let us introduce the following notation , that we will use throughout the paper , for the fractional laplacian in dimension  @xmath3 ( without normalization constants ) .",
    "given a bounded @xmath20 , we define @xmath21    for @xmath22 as above , @xmath23 and @xmath24 , we define , for any  @xmath25 , @xmath26 then , for each operator @xmath7 of the form , let @xmath27 be defined as follows .",
    "we set @xmath28 , where @xmath24 satisfies @xmath29 using the function @xmath30 , we define the closed convex set @xmath31 we notice also that , since @xmath7 is even , both @xmath30 and @xmath32 are even , i.e. symmetric with respect to the origin .",
    "in addition , we remark that , when @xmath18 , @xmath32 is a ball ( centered at @xmath33 ) .",
    "our assumption on @xmath7 is that @xmath34 more quantitatively , we assume that there exist  @xmath35 such that @xmath36 this assumption is equivalent to saying that for all  @xmath37 there exist @xmath35 and  @xmath38 , @xmath39 such that  @xmath40 , and  @xmath41 .",
    "we remark that the definition of  @xmath30 in is well posed , and indeed an explicit expression of  @xmath42 is obtained through the formula @xmath43 to prove , we proceed as follows @xmath44 where we used the change of variables @xmath45 .",
    "hence , if @xmath46 is given by , @xmath47 that is .",
    "a special case of occurs when the spectral measure is induced by a convex set , namely when @xmath48 for some convex set @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the norm with unit ball  @xmath49 , that is , for any  @xmath51 , @xmath52 then , in this case , an integration in polar coordinates yields @xmath53 as pointed out to us by m. ludwig , to whom we are indebted for this comment and the interesting references provided , the convex body associated to this support function is the so called `` @xmath54-intersection body '' of @xmath49 .",
    "these convex bodies are well studied in convex geometry , in relation to the important busemann - petty problem , see  @xcite and references therein for more information on this subject .",
    "as shown in @xcite , for any given convex set @xmath49 ( bounded and with nonempty interior ) which is symmetric with respect to the origin , the function @xmath30 is strictly convex in all the nonradial directions .",
    "also , from it follows that @xmath30 is @xmath55 in @xmath56 when @xmath11 is @xmath55 .",
    "actually @xmath57 suffices since the `` kernel '' @xmath58 is @xmath59 and this yields a regularity improvement .    when @xmath49 is any @xmath55 convex set , the previous observations imply that the set @xmath60 is a @xmath55 , even with respect to @xmath33 , strictly convex set . noting that @xmath32 and @xmath61 are one the polar body of the other , one can show that @xmath32 is also a @xmath55 , even , strictly convex set .",
    "indeed , since @xmath61 is a @xmath55 , even , strictly convex set , any point of its boundary can be touched by two even ellipsoids , one contained in , and the other one containing , @xmath61 . considering the polar transformations of these ellipsoids",
    "we show the same property for @xmath32 .",
    "our assumptions on @xmath9 , precisely stated below , are satisfied when @xmath62 , with @xmath10 being a @xmath63 double - well potential with wells ( i.e. minima ) at @xmath64 and satisfying that @xmath65 near @xmath64 .",
    "more precisely , and somehow more generally , we assume that @xmath9 belongs to @xmath66\\big)$ ] and satisfies , for some @xmath67 and @xmath68 , @xmath69\\cup[1-\\kappa , 1].\\ ] ]    moreover , we assume that @xmath70 we recall that @xmath71 denotes the one - dimensional fractional laplacian in .    when @xmath62 and @xmath10 is a @xmath63 double - well potential with wells at @xmath64 , the existence of the previous one - dimensional heteroclinic solution is proven in @xcite ( see also @xcite for the case of general kernels ) .",
    "thus , condition is satisfied in this case .",
    "also , condition is satisfied when @xmath65 near @xmath72 , and this model case , which has concrete realizations in phase transition models , is for us the main motivating example .    in order to precisely identify the quantities on which the constants in the estimates of the paper depend , let us define @xmath73\\big ) \\supset [ -1+\\kappa , 1-\\kappa]\\big\\}.\\ ] ] more informally , @xmath74 is ( half of ) the length of the symmetric interval where the transition of @xmath75 essentially occurs .      in the framework that we have just introduced",
    ", we are now in the position of stating our main result as follows .    throughout the paper ,",
    "we take  @xmath1 and we call a constant _ universal _ if it depends only on  @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 and @xmath74 , see subsections  [ sub11 ] and  [ sub12 ] . in particular , universal constants depend only on @xmath76 , @xmath7 , and @xmath9 .    in the statement of the next theorem , for fixed @xmath84 , given @xmath85",
    "we define @xmath86 note that @xmath87 is a nonnegative integer and that @xmath88 is comparable to @xmath89 .",
    "[ thm : improvement ] assume that @xmath7 satisfies @xmath90 and that @xmath9 satisfies and . then there",
    "exist universal constants  @xmath91 , @xmath92 and  @xmath93 such that the following statement holds .",
    "let @xmath94 $ ] and @xmath95 $ ] .",
    "let @xmath96 be a solution of @xmath97 in @xmath98 such that @xmath99 and @xmath100 for @xmath101 , where @xmath102 .",
    "then , @xmath103 for some @xmath23 .",
    "we observe that theorem  [ thm : improvement ] is related to the improvement of flatness in  @xcite , with some important differences : besides the nonlinear dependence of  @xmath104 from  @xmath105 , which is different from the classical case on which we will comment later on we remark that our theorem  [ thm : improvement ] is valid for solutions , and not only for minimizers of the energy functional .",
    "this is due to the fact that our methods bypass the use of density estimates .    in order to explain more intuitively the content of theorem  [ thm : improvement ] ,",
    "let us introduce some ( informal ) terminology .",
    "we call _ transition level sets _ ( of  @xmath106 )",
    "all the level sets  @xmath107 for  @xmath108 .",
    "we say that the transition level sets are flat at a scale  @xmath109 if they are trapped , after some rotation , in a cylinder  @xmath110 .",
    "we call _ flatness _ the adimensional quantity @xmath105 .    with this terminology , theorem  [ thm : improvement ]",
    "says that if the transition level sets are flat enough at a very large scale , then its flatness improves geometrically at the half scale .",
    "this result is suited for iteration . however , as we will see in more detail in section  [ sect7 ] , the geometric improvement of the flatness can not be done up to scale 1 but only up to some ( still huge ) mesoscale .",
    "this is an important difference with respect to the result in  @xcite and we will comment more on it later on .",
    "another way to look at the result in theorem  [ thm : improvement ] is as an approximate @xmath111 regularity result for level sets .",
    "namely , if the transition level sets of the solution of  @xmath112 in @xmath113 are trapped between two parallel planes close enough to the origin , and  @xmath104 is small enough , then the transition occurs essentially on a @xmath111 graph in @xmath114 up to errors that decay algebraically ( in @xmath104 ) as @xmath115 .",
    "the limit case as @xmath115 of this result plays a crucial role in the regularity theory of nonlocal minimal surfaces ; see theorem  6.8 in  @xcite .",
    "an important consequence of theorem  [ thm : improvement ] is a general rigidity result .",
    "it states that entire solutions of nonlocal allen - cahn equations satisfying an `` appropriately weak '' asymptotic flatness condition for its transition level sets possess one - dimensional symmetry , i.e. their level sets are hyperplanes .    combining theorem [ thm : improvement ] with asymptotic results such that the @xmath116-convergence results of savin and the third author in @xcite and the classification of minimizing cones for the fractional perimeter @xcite , we obtain new @xmath3d symmetry results for entire solutions of @xmath117 in dimension  @xmath118 . in this section",
    "we list these new results .    as explained at the beginning of the introduction , these symmetry properties for solutions of equations which model phase transitions are a classical topic of research that goes back to a famous conjecture posed by de  giorgi in  @xcite . the problem has been widely studied in the local setting ( see e.g.  @xcite ) and some results have been obtained also in the nonlocal case ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "see also the very recent results in  @xcite , in which the techniques invented in  @xcite have been suitably extended and modified in order to deal with the equation  @xmath13 with  @xmath119 ( notice that the range of  @xmath77 dealt with in  @xcite is complementary with the range treated in this paper , which takes into account the genuinely nonlocal case ) .    to state our results , it is convenient to give the following definition : we say that a function  @xmath120 is @xmath3d if it depends only on one euclidean variable , up to a rotation , namely if there exist  @xmath121 and  @xmath122 such that  @xmath123 for any  @xmath25 .",
    "the following general theorem will lead to new rigidity results in different concrete situations : for minimizers or monotone solutions of fractional allen cahn equations , for stable solutions , etc .",
    "we write it in this general form so that it can be neatly applied to all these situations .",
    "[ c:1 ] assume that @xmath7 satisfies @xmath90 and that @xmath9 satisfies and .",
    "let @xmath106 be a solution of  @xmath124 in  @xmath125 .",
    "assume that there exist @xmath126 and @xmath127 $ ] such that  @xmath128 as @xmath129 and such that , for all @xmath130 , we have @xmath131 for some @xmath23 , which may depend on @xmath109 .",
    "then , @xmath106 is @xmath3d .",
    "let us point out that theorem  [ c:1 ] will be a consequence of theorem  [ thm : improvement ] , but it does not immediately follows from it . its proof is nontrivial because in theorem  [ thm : improvement ] we ( need to )",
    "assume that  @xmath132 , instead of  @xmath133 as in  @xcite .",
    "as a consequence , applying iteratively theorem  [ thm : improvement ] to a flat enough interface in a large ball  @xmath134 , we improve geometrically the flatness , but only up to a mesoscale  @xmath135 , where  @xmath136 . if instead we had a condition like  @xmath133 , we could improve the flatness right away up to scale  @xmath3 and the theorem  [ c:1 ] would be an immediate consequence of theorem  [ thm : improvement ] .",
    "for this reason , the proof of theorem  [ c:1 ] requires a suitable multiscale iteration of theorem  [ thm : improvement ] , combined with the use of the sliding method of berestycki , caffarelli and nirenberg  @xcite , appropriately modified to treat the nonlocal case ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "see subsection  [ sec : proofs ] for further details on the proofs .",
    "now we consider the concrete case of minimizing solutions of the nonlocal allen - cahn equation  @xmath137 , with  @xmath1 .",
    "we remark that the problem is variational , with associate energy functional given by @xmath138 where , for some appropriate constant @xmath139 , @xmath140    we say that a solution @xmath106 of  @xmath137 is a _ minimizer _ of @xmath141 in  @xmath125 if @xmath142 for any ball  @xmath143 and any  @xmath144 ( notice that , for simplicity , we are dropping the normalization constant in the fractional laplace framework ) .    in this setting , we have :    [ c:2 ] let  @xmath106 be a minimizer of @xmath141 in  @xmath145 .",
    "then , @xmath106 is @xmath3d .",
    "theorem  [ c:2 ] has been also proved , by different methods , in  @xcite . on the other hand , the following results are , as far as we know , completely new , since they deal with higher - dimensional spaces ( indeed , the only symmetry results known for the fractional allen - cahn equation are the ones in  @xcite , which hold in dimension  @xmath146 with  @xmath4 , while we will consider now the case  @xmath147 and  @xmath1 , under different assumptions ) .

    "suppose that @xmath149 and @xmath150 then , @xmath106 is @xmath3d .",
    "the next two results deal with the case in which the fractional parameter  @xmath77 is sufficiently close to  @xmath3 ( that is , roughly speaking , when the nonlocal diffusive operator is sufficiently close to  @xmath151 ) . in this case",
    ", it is known that the minimizers of the corresponding geometric problem of fractional perimeters are close to the classical minimal surfaces ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "this fact provides an additional rigidity of the interfaces that we can exploit in order to obtain symmetry results .",
    "[ c:3 ] let  @xmath152 .",
    "then , there exists @xmath153 such that for any  @xmath154 the following statement holds true .",

    "suppose that @xmath155 and @xmath156 then , @xmath106 is @xmath3d",
    ".      at a very high level , our proof of theorem [ thm : improvement ] follows the classical `` improvement of flatness strategy '' that goes back to de  giorgi ( see e.g. the retrospective in  @xcite ) and that was pioneered in @xcite for the case of level sets of classical phase transitions and suitably modified in  @xcite in the context of nonlocal minimal surfaces .",
    "our argument uses all the ingredients of the previous literature , but needs to go beyond them .",
    "the delicate proof of our version of the improvement of flatness result relies on compactness and extends from section  [ section2 ] to section  [ sect6 ] .",
    "let us give next the `` big picture '' of it .    very roughly , we take a sequence  @xmath157 of solutions of @xmath158 such that the transition level sets of @xmath157 are trapped in ( a sequence of ) very flat cylinders of flatness @xmath105 .",
    "we assume that @xmath159 for @xmath160 very large and we show that @xmath161 outside of , essentially , a @xmath162 dimensional surface ( very flat but possibly very irregular ) .",
    "we then consider `` vertical rescalings '' , that is , we consider the change of variables @xmath163 of these `` transition '' surfaces ( clearly here we assume that they are flat in the direction  @xmath164 ) .    a main step in the proof consists in proving that these vertical rescalings are compact and converge to a graph . to achieve this compactness",
    "we need a `` hlder type '' estimate , or improvement of oscillation , for vertical rescalings .",
    "the proof of this improvement of oscillation estimate requires to build fine barriers for the semilinear equation .",
    "we thus obtain that the vertical rescalings converge to a hlder continuous graph @xmath165 .",
    "moreover , we prove that @xmath166 is a viscosity solution of the linear translation invariant elliptic equation @xmath167 in @xmath168 .",
    "finally we deduce the improvement of flatness of the transition level sets from the @xmath111 interior regularity of the equation @xmath167 .",
    "the rest of the paper , namely sections  [ sect7 ] and  [ sect8 ] , is devoted to the proof of theorem  [ c:1 ] and its consequences . as explained before , theorem  [ c:1 ] follows from theorem [ thm : improvement ] but not in a straightforward way .",
    "let us summarize next the main steps of its proof .",
    "we use two different iterations of theorem  [ thm : improvement ] .",
    "the first iteration , that we informally call `` preservation of flatness '' , is given in corollary  [ 0nl : vv ] .",
    "the second iteration , really a geometric `` improvement of flatness '' is given in corollary  [ nl : vv ] .",
    "corollary  [ nl : vv ] is stronger in the sense that the flatness is improved geometrically in a sequence of dyadic balls , but only up to a large mesoscale . in corollary  [ 0nl : vv ]",
    "the flatness does not improve but is just preserved across scales but , as a counterpart , it gives information up to scale 1 .    to prove theorem  [ c:1 ] we need to combine corollary  [ 0nl : vv ] with a multi - scale application of corollary  [ nl : vv ] .",
    "doing so , we prove that the transition level sets are trapped , in all of @xmath125 , between a lipschitz graph and a finite vertical translation of it .",
    "then , we need to use the sliding method ( in its full strength ) to conclude that the level sets of the solution are indeed flat .",
    "it is worth to emphasize again that , differently from the classical case of  @xcite , and from the mildly nonlocal case of  @xcite , in our genuinely nonlocal setting the improvement of flatness result is not strong enough to imply the 1d symmetry of entire solutions right away . only with the suitably tailored argument outlined above",
    "we can conclude the proof of the symmetry result .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .    in section  [ section2 ]",
    "we introduce a method to build fine barriers for the semilinear equation @xmath169 .",
    "the main idea is to model the solutions using the ( anisotropic ) distance function given by the norm @xmath170 to a very flat convex graph .    in section  [ sect3 ]",
    "we give some simple ( though very useful ) auxiliary results on the decay of the solutions .",
    "we prove that a solution @xmath106 decays to @xmath171 ( resp . to @xmath172 ) like @xmath173 , where @xmath174 is the distance to @xmath175 ( resp . to @xmath176 ) .    in section  [ sect4 ]",
    "we state and prove the improvement of oscillation result for vertical rescaling , thus obtaining the compactness of the vertical rescalings .    in section  [ sect5 ]",
    "we prove that the limit of the vertical rescalings satisfies a linear translations invariant nonlocal elliptic equation .    in section  [ sect6 ]",
    "we complete the proof of theorem  [ thm : improvement ] .",
    "in section  [ sect7 ] we prove corollaries  [ 0nl : vv ] and [ nl : vv ] and give the proof of the theorem  [ c:1 ] , that is based on a suitable application of the sliding method .    in section  [ sect8 ]",
    ", we then give the proofs of the symmetry results in theorems  [ c:2 ] , [ c:3bis ] , [ c:3 ] and  [ c:3tris ] .",
