    "the predissociative coupling is due to spin - orbit ( any of the four states ) or electronic - rotational interaction ( @xmath1 state )  @xcite .",

    "because the strength of the electronic - rotational coupling increases with the nuclear rotational angular momentum , while the strength of the spin - orbit coupling is nearly independent of it  @xcite , the @xmath1 state is expected to be the most important channel for inverse predissociation . in a shock tube study of the emission from recombining oxygen atoms in a non - equilibrium shocked ozone - argon gas mixture at temperatures between 2500 and 3800  k myers and bartle  @xcite obtained absolute intensity measurements of the spectrum , and attributed the emission to the formation of oxygen molecules from ground state oxygen atoms through the inverse predissociation process @xmath13 the emission has been observed in several later experiments .",
