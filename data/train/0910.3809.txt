    "let @xmath1 denote a sequence of real orthonormal polynomials with respect to the weight function @xmath2 on the interval @xmath3 ( see e.g. @xcite ) , i.e. @xmath4    the distribution of these polynomials along the orthogonality interval can be complementarily measured by means of the spreading properties of the normalized - to - unity density function @xmath5=p_n^2 ( x ) \\omega(x ) , \\label{eq : rakhmanov_density}\\ ] ] which is called rakhmanov s density of the polynomial @xmath6 , to honor the pioneering work @xcite of this mathematician who has shown that this density governs the asymptotic @xmath7 behaviour of the ratio @xmath8 .",
    "physically , this probability density characterizes the stationary states of a large class of quantum - mechanical potentials @xcite . beyond the variance ,",
    "the spreading of the orthogonal polynomials is best analyzed by the information - theoretic properties of their associated rakhmanov probability densities ; namely , the fisher information @xcite , the renyi entropy @xcite and the shannon entropy @xcite .",
    "the information - theoretic knowledge of the orthogonal polynomials up to 2001 is reviewed in ref @xcite , where the quantum - mechanical motivation and some physical applications are also given , and up today in @xcite , where emphasis is made on asymptotics .",
    "therein , it is pointed out that the study of the information - theoretic measures of orthogonal polynomials was initiated in the nineties with the asymptotic computation of the renyi and shannon entropies of the classical orthogonal polynomials @xcite . up until now , however , the explicit expressions of these two spreading measures are not known save for the shannon measure for some particular subclasses of the jacobi polynomials ; namely the chebyshev polynomials of first and second type @xcite and the gegenbauer polynomials @xmath9 with integer parameter @xmath10 @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the fisher information for all classical orthogonal polynomials on a real interval ( hermite , laguerre , jacobi ) has been calculated in a closed form in 2005 @xcite .",
    "this has allowed us to find , more recently , the cramer - rao information plane ( i.e. the plane defined by both the fisher information and the variance ) for these systems @xcite .",
    "this paper has two main purposes .",
    "first , to introduce a more appropriate set of spreading measures ( to be called spreading lengths of renyi , shannon and fisher types ) in the field of orthogonal polynomials following the ideas of m.j.w .",
    "hall @xcite .",
    "the spreading lengths are direct measures of position spread of the variable @xmath11 , as the root - mean - square or standard deviation @xmath12 .",
    "so they have the following properties : same units as @xmath11 , invariance under translations and reflections , linear scaling with @xmath11 and vanishing in the limit as @xmath13 approaches a delta function .",
    "the second purpose is to compute all these lengths for the hermite polynomials . in this sense",
    "we first compute their moments around the origin and , as well , the standard deviation of these objects .",
    "then we compute the entropic or frequency moments @xcite of these polynomials by means of the bell polynomials , so useful in combinatorics @xcite .",
    "this achievement allows us to obtain the renyi lengths of hermite polynomials by means of an efficient algorithm based on the known properties of bell s polynomials . with respect to the shannon length ,",
    "since its explicit expression can not be determined , we obtain its asymptotics and we derive a family of sharp upper bounds by use of an information - theoretic - based optimization procedure .",
    "moreover , the fisher information is explicitly calculated .",
    "finally , these information - theoretic quantities are applied to the computation of the spreading lengths of the main quantum - mechanical prototype of physical systems : the harmonic oscillator .",
    "the structure of the paper is the following . in section [ sec2 ]",
    "we describe the spreading lengths for the orthogonal polynomials @xmath14 and discuss their properties . in section [ sec3 ] the computational methodology to obtain the entropic moments and the associated renyi lengths of the hermite polynomials is developed by use of the bell polynomials .",
    "in addition , the moments with respect to the origin and the fisher length are explicitly given .",
    "furthermore , the asymptotics of the hermite polynomials is obtained and a family of sharp bounds are variationally determined . in section [ sec4 ]",
    "the spreading lengths of hermite polynomials is numerically discussed and a linear correlation with the standard deviation is computationally discovered . in section [ sec5 ] the previous results",
    "are applied to the quantum - mechanical harmonic oscillator .",
    "finally , some open problems about the asymptotics of entropic moments are posed , our conclusions are given and an appendix with the computational approach of the power of an arbitrary polynomial by use of the bell polynomials is included .",
    "here we shall refer to the hypergeometric - type polynomials , i.e. the polynomials @xmath14 defined by the orthogonality relation given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : orthonormality ] ) .",
    "it is well - known that they can be reduced to one of the three classical families of hermite , jacobi and laguerre by appropriate linear changes of the variable @xcite .",
    "the spreading of these polynomials along their orthogonality interval @xmath15 can be measured by means of ( i ) the moments around a particular point of the orthogonality interval ; usually it is chosen the origin ( moments around the origin : @xmath16 ) or the centroid @xmath17 ( central moments or moments around the centroid : @xmath18 ) @xcite and ( ii ) the frequency moments @xmath19:=\\langle \\left [ \\rho_n(x)\\right ] ^k\\rangle$ ] @xcite of the associated rakhmanov density @xmath13 given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : rakhmanov_density ] ) .",
    "the symbol @xmath20 denotes the expectation value of @xmath21 with respect to the density @xmath13 as @xmath22    these two classes of ordinary and frequency moments are complementary spreading measures of global type . while the ordinary moments measures the distribution of the probability with respect to a particular point of the support interval @xmath23 , the frequency moments measure the extent to which the probability is in fact distributed .",
    "so it happens that the latter moments are , at times , much better probability estimators than the ordinary ones @xcite .",
    "moreover , they are fairly efficient in the range where the ordinary moments are fairly inefficient @xcite ; see also the brief , recent summary about these quantities done in ref . @xcite .",
    "therein we learn that the frequency moments are also called `` entropic moments '' because they are closely connected to the renyi entropies @xcite @xmath24:=\\frac{1}{1-q}\\ln \\langle [ \\rho_n(x)]^{q-1}\\rangle;\\quad q>0;\\quad q\\neq 1 , \\label{eq : def_renyi}\\ ] ] and the tsallis entropies @xcite @xmath25:=\\frac{1}{q-1}\\left [ 1-\\langle [ \\rho_n(x)]^{q-1}\\rangle\\right];\\quad q>0 ; \\quad q\\neq 1 ,   \\label{eq : def_tsallis}\\ ] ] as well as to other information - theoretic quantities , such as the brukner - zeilinger entropy @xcite and the linear entropy @xcite .    among the first class of moments we highlight the familiar root - mean - square or standard deviation @xmath26 given by @xmath27 because it is a direct measure of spreading @xcite in the sense of having the same units as the variable , and has various interesting properties : invariance under translations and reflections , linear scaling ( i.e. , @xmath28 for @xmath29 ) and vanishing as the density approaches a dirac delta density ( i.e. in the limit that @xmath11 tends towards a given definite value ) .    from the second class of moments we fix our attention on the renyi lengths @xcite defined by @xmath30\\equiv \\exp\\left(r_q[\\rho_n]\\right ) = \\langle \\left[\\rho_n(x)\\right]^{q-1}\\rangle^{-\\frac{1}{q-1}}=\\left\\{\\int_{\\delta}dx[\\rho_n(x)]^{q }",

    "we highlight the second - order renyi length ( also called onicescu information @xcite , heller length @xcite , disequilibrium @xcite and inverse participation ratio in other contexts @xcite )    @xmath31:= l_2^r[\\rho_n]=\\langle \\rho_n(x)\\rangle^{-1}=\\left\\ { \\int_{\\delta } dx [ \\rho_n(x)]^2\\right\\}^{-1},\\ ] ] and , above all , the shannon length @xcite @xmath32:= \\lim_{q\\to 1 } l_q^r[\\rho_n]=\\exp\\left ( s[\\rho_n]\\right ) \\equiv",

    "there exists a third class of spreading measures for the classical orthogonal polynomials , which are qualitatively different in the sense that , in contrast to the previous ones , they have a local character .",
    "indeed they are functionals of the derivative of the associated rakhmanov density @xmath13 , so that they are very sensitive to local rearrangements of the variable .",

    "this quantity measures the pointwise concentration of the probability along the orthogonality interval , and quantifies the gradient content of the rakhmanov density providing ( i ) a quantitative estimation of the oscillatory character of the density and of the polynomials and ( ii ) the bias to particular points of the interval , so that it measures the degree of local disorder .",
    "it is worthy to remark that the fisher length , as the heisenberg and renyi lengths , is a direct spreading measure and has the three properties of translation and reflection invariance , linear scaling and vanishing when the density tends to a delta density .",
    "in addition , the fisher length is finite for all distributions @xcite .",
    "moreover , the direct spreading measures just mentioned have an uncertainty / certainty property : see refs .",
    "@xcite for the heisenberg , shannon and renyi cases , and @xcite for the fisher case",
    ". finally , they fulfill the inequalities @xcite @xmath36\\leq ( 2\\pi e)^{\\frac{1}{2}}(\\delta x)_n , \\label{eq : delta_inequalities}\\ ] ] where the equality is reached if and only if @xmath13 is a gaussian density .",
    "in this section we calculate the moments - with - respect - to - the - origin @xmath37 , @xmath38 , the entropic moments @xmath39\\equiv \\langle[\\rho_n(x)]^q\\rangle$ ] , of integer order @xmath40 , and the renyi , shannon and fisher spreading lengths of the rakhmanov density of the orthonormal hermite polynomials @xmath41 given by @xmath42 with @xmath43 where the last factor vanishes when @xmath44 and @xmath45 have opposite parities .",
