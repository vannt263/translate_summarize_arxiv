    "until recently , the galactic medium at cosmological redshifts was largely unexplored , but after the advent at the wsrt of wideband uhf receivers , spanning 7001200 mhz , systematic surveys for h@xmath0i   21  cm line absorption associated with radio - loud active galaxies in the redshift range @xmath6 to @xmath7 have been done by different collaborations and with a variety of goals .",
    "the emphasis has been on bright , compact radio sources , which were a priori thought to be likely targets for successful detections , with the potential to use the lines to draw astrophysically interesting conclusions . indeed , in the early h@xmath0i  21  cm absorption line search of galaxies at relatively low redshifts by van gorkom et al .",
    "( 1989 ) , the 4 detections ( out of 29 objects observed ) were all in csos or sources with similarly compact structure .",
    "absorption was detected at the wsrt in 27/84 targets analysed to date ; highlights and trends will be discussed here .",
    "compact symmetric objects ( csos ) are defined as having radio lobes visible on both sides of the central engine but not extending over more than 1  kpc ( wilkinson et al .",
    "many csos have an overall gigahertz - peaked spectrum ( gps ) ; others are amongst the smallest compact steep - spectrum souces ( csss ) .",
    "the css class also contains medium - size symmetric objects ( msos , fanti et al .",
    "1995 ) , ranging in size up to 15 kpc . a recent review was given by odea  ( 1998 ) .",
    "it is now commonly thought that csos and msos are the early stages of an evolutionary sequence ending up at powerful extended radio sources .",
    "back - extrapolated hotspot advance speeds imply total radio source ages of less than 1000 years in several csos ( owsianik &  conway 1998 ; owsianik , conway , &  polatidis 1998 ; owsianik , conway , &  polatidis 1999 ) .",
    "msos are thought to have ages ranging between 10@xmath8 and 10@xmath9 years ( fanti et al .",
    "however , while the enveloping media probably do not permanently `` frustrate '' the radio sources in their growth , jet - cloud or more generally jet - envelope interactions in the narrow line region of the inner galaxy could well be dynamically important . with the wsrt ,",
    "6/7 csos in the complete pr sample ( pearson &  readhead 1988 ) were surveyed for h@xmath0i  absorption ( 0710 + 439 had excessive external interference ) .",
    "this yielded 4/6 detections ( vermeulen et al .  in preparation ) ; peak optical depths and limits are : 0108 + 388 , 44% ; 0404 + 768 , 2.5% ; 1031 + 567 , @xmath101% ; 1358 + 624 , 0.4% ; 2021 + 614 , @xmath100.2% ; 2352 + 495 , 1.5% ( shown in figure  1 as a representative example ) .",
    "some of the line profiles can be reasonably approximated by a single gaussian , but others have a rather more complex structure ; the velocity widths range from 10 to 300 . in fainter csos similar absorption lines",
    "have been detected for 5/10 sources ( tschager et al .  in preparation ) in the cjf sample ( taylor et al .",
    "1996a ) and 1/2 additional sources in the coins sample ( peck et al .",
    "2000 ) , but a comparison with the brighter pr csos is not yet meaningful since detection limits @xmath111%   were not always reached .",
    "preliminary analysis of a vlbi observation at 1147 mhz ( h@xmath0i   at @xmath12 ) suggests that the absorption in 2352 + 495 may be confined to the central part of the continuum structure ( shown in figure  1 ) , @xmath1150 pc across ( vermeulen et al .  in preparation ) .",
    "the absorption line profile is then likely to be probing a toroidal or disk - like region around the active nucleus , and perpendicular to the inner jets .",
    "disks or tori with a thickness of only a few pc have been demonstrated to cover a portion of the receding jet in the lower redshift galaxies cygnus a ( conway &  blanco 1995 , conway 1999 ) and ngc 4261 ( van langevelde et al .",
    "but in the radio galaxy hydra a ( taylor 1996 ) , and in the low - redshift cso 4c31.04 ( conway 1996 ) , a geometrically thick disk , extending over several tens of pc , covers part of the approaching jet as well .",
    "it seems that a thick disk / torus scenario might apply to 2352 + 495 : the central radio component in figure  1 is probably almost entirely from the approaching ( doppler boosted  ? ) jet , because the true core is not visible due to synchrotron self - absorption , free - free absorption , or both ( see taylor , readhead , &  pearson 1996b ) .",
    "maloney ( 1999 ) has argued that circumnuclear tori or disks could be in a largely atomic state at @xmath13  k ; adopting this as the spin temperature yields a column density of @xmath14  @xmath15 for the narrowest absorption feature in 2352 + 495 , and @xmath16  @xmath15 for the deep absorption in 0108 + 388 .",
    "subject to substantial uncertainty in the actual size and geometry of the covering region , the absorbers have particle densities of @xmath17  @xmath4 for the narrow absorber in 2352 + 495 to @xmath18  @xmath4 for 0108 + 388 .",
    "however , in another pr cso , 0404 + 768 , preliminary vlbi observations at 886 mhz ( h@xmath0i  at @xmath19 ) indicate that the total flux density of the central region is insufficient for the main absorption line .",
    "it probably arises against part or all of the outer lobes , which together extend over almost 1 kpc ( vermeulen et al .  in preparation ) .",
    "the inferred atomic gas density is @xmath20  @xmath4 ( limited by assuming uniform coverage ) .",
    "detailed vlbi observations may be able to probe in a cosmologically distant galaxy the properties of an atomic gas disk , which could be analoguous to those found through h@xmath0i  absorption in nearby seyfert galaxies by gallimore et al .",
    "but in addition , vlbi spectral imaging will also reveal whether and how the radio jets and lobes in young powerful radio sources interact with their gaseous environment ( for which seyfert galaxies like ic 5063 might be low - redshift analogues ; see oosterloo et al .",
    "the recent wsrt suveys show a definite but by no means exclusive trend of diminishing h@xmath0i  absorption with increasing linear extent of the radio sources ( pihlstrm et al .  in preparation ) ; this was already suspected by conway ( 1996 ) .",
    "the larger sources are well outside the torus and accretion disk area , and probably probe regions with a lower atomic gas column density .",
    "the shallowest absorption line detected to date , in the css galaxy 3c213.1 , has only 0.1%  peak depth , but in 3c49 ( 3.6% ) and 3c268.3 ( 12% ) prominent absorption exists ( de vries et al .  in preparation ) . in both of these , ( part of )",
    "one of the radio lobes is coincident , at least in projection , with an optically prominent feature or knot in the host galaxy .",
    "if vlbi observations confirm that the optical knots are the sites of the h@xmath0i  absorption , this offers unique opportunities to study the `` alignment effect '' and details of jet - cloud interactions in cosmologically distant sources .",
    "a jet - cloud interaction site is also the most plausible location of the h@xmath0 i  absorption found in the `` superluminal css '' quasar 3c216 , where , because of its orientation , the circumnuclear disk or torus is unlikely to be visible in absorption ( pihlstrm et al .",
    "normal core - dominated quasars are unlikely to show h@xmath0i   absorption ( pihlstrm et al .  in preparation ) , but 2/3 non - css quasars pre - selected to have high optical reddening ( from stickel et al .",
    "1996 ) were found to have significant h@xmath0i  absorption ( probably associated , intervening systems are not dealt with here ) : 0500 + 019 , 3.6% ; 1504 + 377 , 34% ; 2149 + 056 , @xmath101.5% ( carilli et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
