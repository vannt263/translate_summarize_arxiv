    "although metallization of boron under pressure was predicted on the basis of electronic structure calculations some time ago @xcite , experimental verification of this result has so far been lacking . on the basis of the calculations @xcite nonmetallic icosahedral boron(b )",
    "is expected to undergo a structural transition , first to a body - centered tetragonal ( bct ) phase at @xmath5210 gpa and then to a face - centered cubic ( fcc ) phase at @xmath5360 gpa .",
    "recently high pressure experiments by eremets @xcite have found boron to be not only a metal , but also a superconductor at high pressure , with superconducting transition temperature @xmath6 increasing with increasing pressure .",
    "superconductivity appears at around 160 gpa , and @xmath6 increases from 6 k at 175 gpa to 11.2 k at 250 gpa .",
    "the appearance of superconductivity in b under pressure is not surprising , because the existence of different phases is usually an indication of strong electron - phonon coupling , which is ( most often ) also responsible for superconductivity . in this work",
    "we study the superconductivity in bct and fcc phases of b using _ ab initio _ theoretical calculations .",
    "we use the linear response scheme implemented by savrasov @xcite to study the phonon properties and electron - phonon coupling .",
    "the electronic structure is calculated by using the full potential linear muffin - tin orbital ( fp - lmto ) method @xcite .",
    "recently such calculations have been performed for mgb@xmath4@xcite and several other systems@xcite including some boron containing compounds@xcite , and have been found highly successful in capturing the essence of electron - phonon superconductivity in these compounds .",
    "a theoretical study of superconductivity in the fcc phase of boron was reported by papaconstantopoulos and mehl@xcite shortly after eremets @xcite reported their experimental results .",
    "however , the lattice parameters for the fcc phase used by the authors correspond to volumes per atom for which a lower energy structure is bct , as had been revealed by an earlier calculation of mailhoit @xcite .",
    "papaconstantopoulos and mehl@xcite calculate the electron - phonon coupling or the hopfield parameter using the rigid muffin - tin approximation , arguing that the fcc phase might be metastable for such lattice parameters .",
    "this speculation is based on their calculation of elastic constants showing @xmath7 , i.e. , the born criteria@xcite for the stability of the cubic phase are not violated .",
    "however , our linear response calculations yield imaginary phonon frequencies for lattice parameters in excess of 4.4 a.u . in the fcc phase .",
    "thus , although the existence of a metastable fcc phase for lattice parameters 4.6 - 6.0 a.u . used by papaconstantopoulos and mehl@xcite can not be ruled out , the chances are that the equilibrium phase at such lattice parameters is not fcc .",
    "our calculations for equilibrium fcc phase ( lattice parameter less than 4.4 a.u . ) shows a volume dependence of the superconducting transition temperature that is the opposite of what is observed experimentally , i.e. , @xmath6 decreases with increasing pressure .",
    "the study by papaconstantopoulos and mehl@xcite only involves the fcc phase with large lattice parameters , for which the structure is unstable or , at best , metastable .",
    "the present work studies both the fcc and bct phases , each within its appropriate range of lattice parameters .",
    "our linear response calculations also indicate the onset of a bct phase via preference for a change in the @xmath8 ratio as the volume per atom is increased .",
    "detailed discussion of the relevance of our results to the experimental work and that of papaconstantopoulos and mehl@xcite is provided in appropriate sections .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in section",
    "ii we discuss the stability of the bct and fcc phases of boron as a function of volume per atom . in sections iii and iv",
    "we discuss the calculated electronic bands , phonon spectra , and electron - phonon coupling for the fcc and bct phases , respectively . in section v we discuss the volume - dependence of the superconducting transition temperature , summarize and compare our results with the experimental data and discuss possible sources of difference between the two .",
    "the volume vs. energy curves for fcc and bct phases of boron , obtained via fp - lmto calculations , are shown in fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "a constant energy of 49.0 ry . has been added to the energies per atom for convenience in plotting .",
    "these results are very similar to those given by lmto - asa method , and are in close agreement with the earlier plane - wave pseudopotential calculations of mailhoit @xcite .",
    "pseudopotential calculations of total energy of the bct structure by mailhoit @xcite as a function of @xmath8 had indicated a global minimum around @xmath9 . via an elaborate study of the total energies for various monoclinic and tetragonal distortions of the fcc unit cell as well as the bct total energies for various @xmath8 values",
    "these authors concluded that the bct minimum occurs around @xmath10 .",
    "we have not carried out extensive calculations to locate the exact value of @xmath8 , but our fp - lmto calculations on a crude mesh of @xmath8 for fixed volumes do indicate a value in the range @xmath11 .",
    "our linear response calculations for @xmath12 , however , produced complex phonon frequencies at the symmetry point n and nearby wave vectors .",
    "increasing @xmath8 to @xmath13 resulted in real frequencies at all symmetry and intermediate points .",
    "thus the linear response results in this paper are presented for this value of @xmath8 .",
    "it is evident from fig.[fig1 ] that the actual energy values for @xmath14 and @xmath13 for the same volume in the bct phase are very close , and their energy - volume curve intersects the fcc energy - volume curve at almost the same point .",
    "thus the conclusions regarding the stability of the bct phase against fcc are not influenced critically by the choice of @xmath8 in the range @xmath15 .",
    "in fig.[fig2 ] we show the fp - lmto energy bands in fcc b as a function of the lattice parameter a. calculations were carried out with a double-@xmath16 @xmath17 lmto basis set for describing the valence bands .",
    "the charge densities and potentials were represented by spherical harmonics with @xmath186 inside the nonoverlapping ( touching ) muffin - tin spheres and by plane waves with energies @xmath19495 ry in the interstitial region .",
    "brillouin zone integrations were carried out with the tetrahedron method@xcite using a 24,24,24 division of the brillouin zone , corresponding to 413 wave vectors in the irreducible part .",
    "the extraordinarily large band - widths in fig.[fig2 ] are due to the extreme pressures of the systems .",
    "the fcc phase is stable for a=4.4 a.u .",
    "and less , and unstable for a=4.6 a.u . and higher values .",
    "the smallest volume per atom at which the bct phase is stable is around 3.55 @xmath1 , according to the volume - energy curves shown above .",
    "this volume corresponds to a fcc lattice parameter of @xmath20 a.u .",
    "one of the two energy bands crossing the fermi level between the two symmetry points x and w becomes very flat at larger volumes .",
    "the character of the flat energy band between x and w is primarily @xmath21 and @xmath22 : at w it is purely of @xmath22 and at x it is purely of @xmath21 character .",
    "papaconstantopoulos and mehl@xcite have speculated that this flat band is responsible for superconductivity of the fcc phase in boron , pointing out that a similar flat band at the fermi level appears in mgb@xmath4 .",
    "fermi surface plot of papaconstantopoulos and mehl@xcite shows hole pockets near x and electron pockets near w , as would also be expected according to the present calculations .",
    "although we have not verified this explicitly , it is very likely that the flat band between x and w points contributes significantly to the electron - phonon coupling in fcc boron . as this band becomes flatter for larger lattice parameters , the electron - phonon coupling increases .",
    "however , this large electron - phonon coupling also makes the fcc phase unstable at higher volumes via softening of x - point transverse phonons , and brings about the fcc@xmath23 bct transition , as discussed below . the steep band crossing",
    "the fermi level between x and w is of @xmath22 character .              in fig.[fig3 ]",
    "we show the variation of the calculated phonon spectra with the lattice parameter for fcc b. the phonon frequencies were calculated for 29 wave vectors in the irreducible part of the brillouin zone ( bz ) , resulting from a 8,8,8 division of the bz .",
    "this division of the bz yields only a small number ( 3 - 4 ) of wave vectors along the symmetry directions .",
    "the solid lines in fig.[fig3 ] should be taken only as a guide to the eye , rather than actual phonon branches with correct branch crossings .",
    "with increasing volume , the phonon frequencies soften throughout the brillouin zone , as expected .",
    "however , the softening of the two transverse phonon branches near the x point is most pronounced .",
    "the x - point transverse phonons are related to the 180@xmath24 out of phase vibration of the two atoms in a bct unit cell ( c / a= 1.414 for fcc lattice ) .",
    "softening of these phonons with increasing volume indicates growing instability of the fcc structure with respect to the c / a ratio , and acts as a precursor to the fcc@xmath23bct phase transition .",
    "this phonon - softening has two important effects : it increases the phonon density of states at low frequencies beyond the usual parabolic dos given by the debye ( continuum ) model and increases the electron - phonon coupling in the low frequency region ( partly due to increased phonon dos and partly due to increased electron - phonon matrix element ) .",
    "these effects are clearly seen in fig.[fig4 ] , where the calculated eliashberg spectral function ( upper panel ( a ) ) and the phonon density of states ( lower panel ( b ) ) are displayed for three different lattice parameters .",
    "the sharp peaks in both the density of states and the eliashberg spectral function at the high end of the spectrum are due to the lack of dispersion in the longitudinal phonon band close to the x point in the @xmath25-x direction .",
    "the lack of dispersion is enhanced as the atoms move further apart , giving a higher density of states and consequently higher electron - phonon coupling .    in short , the transition from fcc to bct phase with increasing volume ( lowering of pressure )",
    "is driven by softening of transverse x - point phonons , driving the system to a c / a ratio different from ( in this case , lower than ) the fcc value of 1.414 .",
    "the system in this pressure / volume region shows strong electron - phonon coupling , suggesting the possibility of superconducting phase with a relatively high transition temperature @xmath6 .",
    "in fig.[fig5 ] we show the fp - lmto bands structure of bct b for @xmath26=4.35 a.u . for two different c / a ratios : 0.675 and 0.65 .",
    "another band structure for c / a=0.675 , but @xmath26= 4.0 a.u .",
    "is also shown for comparison .",
    "calculations were carried out with a double-@xmath16 @xmath17 lmto basis set for describing the valence bands . the charge densities and potentials",
    "were represented by spherical harmonics with @xmath186 inside the nonoverlapping ( touching ) muffin - tin spheres and by plane waves with energies @xmath19400 ry in the interstitial region .",
    "brillouin zone integrations were carried out with the tetrahedron method@xcite using a 30,30,30 division of the brillouin zone , corresponding to 1992 wave vectors in the irreducible part .    as in the fcc case , the band widths are abnormally large due to extreme high pressures of the systems .",
    "the change in the band structure is understandable as a result of decreasing volume from ( a ) to ( b ) . in panel ( c ) of fig.[fig5 ]",
    "we show the bands for a c / a ratio of 0.65 , for which one of the transverse n - point phonons has imaginary frequency .",
    "there is no discernable feature in the band structure that would indicate the softening of these phonons . for small c / a ratio the boron chains along the c - directions become unstable against transverse vibrations",
    "this is also found to occur for the c / a ratio of 0.675 for lattice parameters in excess of @xmath26=4.35 a.u . at such large volumes boron",
    "presumably enters the nonmetallic icosahedral phase .",
    "the bands at the fermi level are mostly of @xmath27 and @xmath28 character .",

    "the linear response calculations for the phonon properties were carried out for 30 points in the ibz resulting from a 6,6,6 division of the bz .",
    "the solid lines in fig.[fig6 ] have been drawn through the calculated frequencies to provide a guide to the eye and should not be interpreted as the actual phonon branches .        with increasing values of the lattice parameter phonons at other symmetry",
    "points become soft as well .",
    "thus our l - r calculations yield real phonon frequencies for a small range of volume for the chosen c / a ratio of 0.675 . for c / a=0.65 the n - point transverse phonons",
    "are found to be imaginary for all lattice parameters corresponding to volumes where the bct phase should be stable according to the energy - volume curve in fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "of all the phonons the ones at the n point are found to be most sensitive to the c / a ratio .    in fig.[fig7 ]",

    "unlike in the fcc phase the bulk of the electron - phonon coupling is via lower frequency phonons , as most of the spectral weight in fig .",

    "the eliashberg spectral function and the phonon density of states follow each other closely .",
    "there is no disproportionately large contribution from a particular mode .",
    "superconducting transition temperatures @xmath6 were calculated by solving the isotropic eliashberg equation .",
    "we used the calculated eliashberg spectral function along with the following procedure to determine the coulomb pseudopotential @xmath29 we start by assuming @xmath30 .",
    "this value is consistent with that for mgb@xmath4 , where the measured @xmath31 40 k can be reproduced with the linear response results of phonon frequencies and eliashberg function with @xmath32 .",
    "@xmath33 was calculated from @xmath34    thus from the calculated fermi energies @xmath35 we obtain @xmath36 for all volumes , with the cut - off frequency @xmath37 assumed to be ten times the maximum phonon frequency .",
    "a different value of @xmath38 , e.g. 0.8 or 0.7 , would result in a minor change in the calculated @xmath6 and would have no effect on the nature of variation of @xmath6 with volume or pressure .",
    "the results of our calculation are summarized in table [ table1 ] , where , for comparison , results for mgb@xmath4 and two typical low @xmath6 superconductors fcc pb and bcc nb obtained via the same method are also presented . both for fcc and bct boron",
    "the hopfield parameter @xmath39 increases with decreasing volume per atom .",
    "this trend is also supported by the rigid muffin - tin approximation results of papaconstantopoulos and mehl@xcite .",
    "the hopfield parameter in these high pressure phases of boron are 2 - 4 times larger than in mgb@xmath4 and about 10 - 15 times larger than in typical low @xmath6 metals becauses of the vastly reduced distances between the atoms . in fcc boron",
    "@xmath39 is larger than in the bct phase , since the fcc phase is the equilibrium phase at higher pressures or lower volumes .",
    "phonon frequencies @xmath40 in the high pressure bct and fcc phases of boron are much higher than in mgb@xmath4 or a typical metal . as a result the increase in the electron - phonon coupling parameter @xmath41 , which is proportional to @xmath42 is less drastic ( than in @xmath39 ) when compared with mgb@xmath4 or a low @xmath6 superconductor like pb or nb .",
    "the area under the eliashberg spectral function vs. @xmath40 curve @xmath43 is 5 - 15 times larger for fcc or bct boron than for a typical electron - phonon superconductor , because the coupling of electrons in these high pressure phases takes place via very high frequency phonons .",
    "the variation of the superconducting transition temperature @xmath6 with volume per atom is shown in fig.[fig8 ] , where the vertical dashed line is drawn at volume per atom equal to 21.3 bohr@xmath1 , estimated to be the dividing line between the bct and the fcc phase .",
    "for both bct and fcc boron the phonon frequencies rise faster with increasing pressure than the hopfield parameter , resulting in a decrease in electron - phonon coupling and @xmath6 . in the study of the fcc phase by papaconstantopoulos and mehl@xcite",
    "no calculation of phonon spectra as a function of pressure was done , and the authors speculated that if the phonon frequencies do not rise as fast as the hopfield parameter , @xmath6 should rise with increasing pressure .",
    "the present calculations reveal two important results : @xmath6 decreases with increasing pressure despite rise in the hopfield parameter and that the calculated @xmath6 s are in the range 50 - 100 k , much higher than the measured values . in the fcc phase",
    "electron - phonon coupling rises strongly due to softening of x - point transverse phonons as volume per atom approaches the fcc@xmath23bct phase transition .",
    "similarly in the bct phase electron - phonon coupling is very high near the bct@xmath23icosahedral phase change due to softening of n - point transverse phonons . unlike in mgb@xmath4",
    "there is no disproportionately high contribution to electron - phonon coupling from a particular phonon mode .",
    "the eliashberg spectral function follows faithfully the phonon density of states .",
    "the striking differences between the results of this theoretical investigation and the experimental results beg for a suitable explanation .",
    "while we can not rule out the possibility that the electron - phonon coupling and therefore @xmath6 is somehow overestimated in the calculation , it would be hard to deny the validity of the results altogether .",
    "the values of the hopfield parameter and the trend in their variation with pressure are similar to those found via a less rigorous rigid muffin - tin approximation calculation of papaconstantopoulos and mehl@xcite .",
    "the phonon calculations correctly predict the fcc@xmath23bct transition and also the onset of instability of the bct phase ( presumably against the icosahedral phase ) as the pressure is lowered or the volume per atom is increased . since the systems studied do not represent cases of extreme electron - phonon coupling ( see e.g. , j. m. an _",
    "et al._@xcite ) via a single mode or a few modes , superconductivity in these systems does not seem to be special .    on the experimental front ,",
    "the possibility that the measurements were not carried out for a single ( pure ) phase can not be ruled out , as was pointed out by the authors themselves @xcite .",
    "it is possible that the systems studied were in mixed phases with co - existing icosahedral and bct clusters and the superconductivity of the sample was due to the proximity effect of the bct clusters .",
    "this would explain why the measured @xmath6 was so much lower than what would be expected for the pure bct phase .",
    "it is also possible that with increasing pressure the samples were just evolving towards pure bct phase , which would explain the observed increase in @xmath6 with pressure .",
    "the results of the present work strongly suggest that the experimental work on high pressure phases of boron should be repeated , with particular emphasis on the phase of the sample .",
    "it is expected that if the phase is bct or fcc ( or a mixture of the two ) , superconducting transition temperatures should be much higher than previously reported .",
