    "the simplest division of all cosmologies is into two broad classes : those postulating the eternal universe and those which postulate some origin of the universe , or at least the part of it that cosmologists are currently inhabiting .",
    "eternal universes ( and here by eternal i mean those with no beginning or end , or even only those with no beginning ) are the only ones which could pretend to adopt some sort of stationarity , a condition which is of singular importance in many branches of physics ( among other issues because the law of energy conservation is closely connected with a translational symmetry of time ) , and which is certainly seen as greatly simplifying the solution of specific problems everywhere . for a long period of time , after the dogma of creation in 4004 bc was abandoned , the universe has been considered eternal , although great minds , such as newton s , began to perceive some of the difficulties associated with such a proposition ( e.g.north 1965 ) . the resistance to the opposing view ( which eventually became what is today called the standard cosmology )",
    "was established during most of the nineteenth and early twentieth century and is epitomized in the words of one of the pioneers of modern astrophysics , sir arthur eddington , who in his authoritative gifford lectures for 1927 , published under the title _ the nature of the physical world _ , flatly stated : `` as a scientist , i simply do not believe that the universe began with a bang . '' from the end of the middle ages until the hubble observational revolution in the third decade of the twentieth century , the stationary worldview has been in one way or another the dominant one among the educated classes . this explains , among other issues , the dramatic reaction of most of the scientific community , including lord kelvin , holmes , eddington , crookes , jeans and others , to the discoveries of clausius , boltzmann and others , which all imply a unidirectional flow of time and physical change .",
    "interestingly enough , even during this epoch the idea , today one of most investigated issues in physics , that the thermodynamical arrow of time originates in cosmology , has occasionally surfaced ( price 1996 ; irkovi 2003a , and references therein ) .",
    "the power of a stationary alternative to the evolutionary models of the universe has been reiterated in particularly colorful form during the great cosmological controversy in late 1940s , 1950s , and early 1960s ( kragh 1996 ) .",
    "although during this period of conflict between the big bang and the classical steady state theories numerous and very heterogeneous arguments appeared on both sides of the controversy , the argument based on the anthropic principle was only explicitly formulated a decade after the disagreements ended . as is well known , of course , the debate ceased when empirical arguments persuaded by far the largest part of the cosmological community that a universe of finite age is the only acceptable theoretical concept .",
    "however , the argument based on the anthropic principle has been further developed during the 1980s and has gained relevance in a new and developing field of quantum cosmology ( together with other aspects of anthropic reasoning ) .",
    "the present paper is dedicated to detailed consideration of the content and range of applications of that argument . in spite of the huge volume of writings on the philosophical aspects of stationary cosmologies ( e.g.  hawkins 1971 ; grnbaum 1991 ; balashov 1994 ; kragh 1996 ) ,",
    "this particular argument has not been discussed in detail so far .    in modern physical cosmology ,",
    "the position is reversed compared to the situation in first decades of the xx century . the evolving universe with definite beginning enjoys almost universal support , at least in the last three decades ( for a comprehensive reviews of the field , see weinberg 1972 ; harrison 1973 ; peebles 1993 ) .",
    "prior to the discovery of the cosmic microwave background ( henceforth cmb ) in 1965 , at least one of the stationary theories  the classical steady state model of bondi and gold ( 1948 ) , as well as hoyle ( 1948)has been a viable and quite popular worldview . after the interpretation of cmb as the remnant of the primordial fireball ( dicke et al .",
    "1965 ) has become a standard one ( sunyaev and zeldovich 1980 ) , the evolutionary paradigm became universally dominant .    however , this is not the end of the story .",
    "there are at least two reasons ( apart from appreciable historical interest ) to study arguments pertaining to the cosmologies with infinite past even after 1965 , both dealing with the boundary conditions , but with significantly different slant .",
    "* great pains have been taken to make the initial singularity palatable or to avoid it whatsoever ( e.g.  misner 1969 ; bekenstein and meisels 1980 ; israelit and rosen 1989 ) , and the results are still inconclusive from the point of view of most researchers , in spite of the tremendous advances of the new discipline of quantum cosmology .",
    "the issue of a compulsory nature to the initial singularity in the classical context has remained a problem ever since the famous singularity theorems ( e.g. hawking and penrose 1970 ) .",
    "this has been aggravated in view of the very special nature of such a singularity entropy - wise ( penrose 1979 ; irkovi 2003a ) .",
    "the significance of such a discourse is emphasized by recent attempts to build an atemporal worldview ( price 1996 ) , in which cosmological boundary conditions play the crucial role .",
    "it is particularly interesting to consider in this context counterfactual cosmological models ( such as the classical steady state ) , and to compare their temporal aspects and their boundary conditions with the realistic ones .",
    "* recently , various `` multiverse '' schemes have been proposed ( e.g.  linde 1990 ; smolin 1992 ) , in which our visible universe is only part of a larger structure ( for a partial list of such theories , see bostrom 2002 ) .",
    "motivations for this sweeping generalization have been multi - fold , ranging from details of the inflationary theory to topology to the fundaments of quantum mechanics .",
    "some of the proposed multiverses are indeed in a stationary state , even somewhat resembling of the classical steady - state theory .",
    "if these , still rather novel , propositions are to be taken seriously , their impact on several distinct cosmological concerns have to be investigated .",
    "one of the problems pertaining to the question `` one or many universes '' is that of the validity of various anthropic arguments , among them the argument against an infinite series of past events as discussed here .    the modern version of the anthropic argument against the past infinite series of events ( or past temporal infinity in relationist terms ; see the discussion below ) has appeared in a short notice by paul c. w. davies appearing in _ nature _ in june 1978 ( davies 1978 ) .",
    "in this succinct critique of the ellis et al .",
    "( 1978 ) static cosmological model he points out that    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ there is also the curious problem of why , if the universe is infinitely old and life is concentrated in our particular corner of the cosmos , it is not inhabited by technological communities of unlimited age . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    as mentioned by barrow and tipler ( 1986 ) in their encyclopaedic monograph , this is historically the first instance in which an anthropic argument has been used against a cosmology containing a past temporal infinity , and it is indeed fascinating that nobody had considered it before .",
    "the suprise is strengthened by the fact that such cosmologies in scientific or half - scientific form have existed since the very dawn of science . simultaneously , since ancient times a belief in the existence of other * inhabited * worlds has been present , in one form or another . today , the scepticism sometimes encountered against this mode of thinking is even stranger , when various ( and in some cases not quite inexpensive ) seti projects testify to the reasonable degree of belief in the existence of technological civilizations other than the human one .",
    "their technological nature ( the same one which produces the problem davies wrote about ) is a _ conditio sine qua non _ of any sensible seti enterprise .    in tight connection with this issue",
    "is the definition of anthropic principles .",
    "although we shall later discuss some other anthropic principles , for the moment it is enough to define the weak anthropic principle ( henceforth wap ) , which states ( carter 1974 ) that    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ ... we must be prepared to take account of the fact that our location in the universe is _ necessarily _ privileged to the extent of being compatible with our existence as observers . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    an alternative definition is given by barrow and tipler ( 1986 ) :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ the observed values of all physical and cosmological quantities ... take on values restricted by the requirement that there exist sites where carbon - based life can evolve and by the requirement that the universe be old enough for it to have already done so . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    with these formulations of wap in mind , it is clear why the davies argument against the ellis et al .",
    "cosmological model can be called * anthropic * at all : it takes into account the restrictions to be imposed on cosmological models following the existence of a specialized subclass of intelligent observers , namely the `` technological communities '' .",
    "an ancient echo of this type of argumentation can be recognized in the surviving fragments of some of the most distinguished ancient philosophers of nature . from our point of view",
    "especially interesting is the cyclic cosmology of empedocles of acragas ( vi - v century bc ) , in which the universe is eternal , consisting of the internally immutable four classic elements , as well as two opposing forces ( love and strife , i.e.attractive and repulsive interactions ) .",
    "the cyclic motion of matter in the universe is governed by the change in relative intensities of the two interactions ( see the excellent discussion in obrien 1969 ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that empedocles cosmology is * uniformitarian * , in the sense that all six basic constituents ( four elements and two forces between them ) are present in each instant of time in accordance with the eternal principles of mutual exchange . in some of the surviving fragments ,",
    "empedocles implies that , although this uniformitarianism may seem counterintuitive , as we see things coming into being and vanishing , this is just our special perspective ( today we would say * anthropocentrism * or observation * selection effect * ) and not the inherent state of nature .",
    "this is strikingly similar to the uniformitarian notions present in some of the most authoritative cosmological models of the twentieth century , and we shall return to it in subsequent discussion of the classical steady state theory ( balashov 1994 ) .    as discussed in some detail in irkovi ( 2003b ) ,",
    "this empedoclean view  that biological evolution and the appearance of consciousness and intelligence are contingent upon cosmological processes  coupled with the notion of the eternal universe leads to the same sort of trouble as the one facing the classical steady state theory or the one of ellis et al .",
    "criticized by davies",
    ". why then , in the supposed infinity of time , are `` men and women , beasts and birds '' of finite , and relatively small , age ? where are traces of previous infinite cycles of the `` world - machine '' ( cf.the discussion of hutton in  [ hutt ] below ) ?    empedocles may have perceived this himself and he evades the problem in the only natural way he can : by postulating two singular states in the beginning and in the middle of each of his great cycles .",
    "these singular states are moments ( in the absolute time ! ) of complete dominance of either love ( an ancient equivalent of the modern initial and/or final singularities ) or strife ( no true equivalent , but similar to the modern version of heat death in the ever - expanding cosmological models ; see , for instance , davies 1994 ) . in these states",
    "the life , with its complex organizational structure , is impossible and therefore they serve as _ termini _ for the duration of any individual history of life and intelligence . in other words ,",
    "the information about anything that was before is destroyed in the singular events .",
    "strikingly , _ the maximal duration of any form of life and/or intelligence is determined exclusively by cosmological laws ! _ therefore , there are no arbitrarily old beings , and anthropic argument is inapplicable .",
    "we shall meet the same strategy over and over again in the history of cosmological ideas .    in the very first chapter of the history of thucydides",
    ", there is a famous statement that before his time  i.e .",
    "about 450 bc ",
    "nothing of importance ( @xmath0 ) had happened in history .",
    "this startling statement has been called `` outrageous '' by oswald spengler , and used to demonstrate the essentially mythological character of the ancient greek historiography ( spengler 1918 ; see also cornford 1965 ) .",
    "it may indeed be outrageous from the modern perspective , but it does motivate a set of deeper questions , ultimately dealing with cosmology .",
    "the fact that thucydides did not know ( or did not care to know ) about previous historical events does not change the essential perception of * finiteness * of human history inseparable from the greek thought .",
    "this property starkly conflicts with the notion of an * eternal continuously existent world * , as it was presented in both modern and ancient cultures .",
    "obviously , it is irrelevant which exact starting point we choose for unfolding historical events . in any case , the number of these events is finite , and the timespan considered small even compared to the specific astronomical timescales ( some of which , like the precession period of equinoxes , were known in the classical antiquity , as is clear from the discussion in _ timaeus _ ) , not to mention anything about a past temporal infinity .",
    "although there was no scientific archaeology in the ancient world , it was as natural then as it is now to expect hypothetical previous civilizations inhabiting oikumene to leave some traces  in fact , an infinite number of traces for an eternally existent oikumene ! there are indications that pre - socratic thinkers have been aware of the incompatibility of this `` thucydidean '' finiteness of historical past with the eternal nature of the world .",
    "we have already mentioned the solution ( periodic singular states ) proposed by empedocles himself .",
    "even earlier , in the fragmentary accounts of the cosmology of anaximandros , we find an evolutionary origin of humankind in some finite moment in the past , parallel with his basic postulate of separation of different worlds from _ apeiron _ and their subsequent returning to it . in anaxagoras worldview , there is a famous tension between the eternity of the world s constituents and the finite duration of * movement * ( and , therefore , relational time ) in the world . in the same time , it seems certain that anaxagoras , together with anaximandros and empedocles , was an early proponent of the evolutionary view , at least regarding the origin of humankind ( guthrie 1969 ) .",
    "subsequently , with the epicurean school , this issue became an argument for the finite origin of the universe .",
    "most eloquently , it has been put forward in roman times by lucretius , who in the book v of his famous poem _ de rerum natura _ writes the following intriguing verses :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ besides all this ,    if there had been no origin - in - birth    of lands and sky , and they had ever been    the everlasting , why , ere theban war    and obsequies of troy , have other bards    not also chanted other high affairs ?",
    "whither have sunk so oft so many deeds    of heroes ? why do those deeds live no more ,    ingrafted in eternal monuments    of glory ?",
    "i guess , because    the sun is new , and of a recent date    the nature of our universe , and had    not long ago its own exordium . _",
    "_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    for scientific - minded lucretius ,",
    "the shortness of human history * is * very strange on the face of hypothesis of the eternal existence of the world .",
    "although the reference to `` eternal monuments '' may sound naive , it is clear that he had in mind any form of transmission of information from the past to the present ; and an infinite amount of information from an infinite past .",
    "his empirical assessment clearly shows the absence of such information .",
    "therefore , an explanation is needed .",
    "the simplest explanation , as lucretius was highly aware , is to assume that the world is of finite ( and relatively small ) age .",
    "this is * exactly * what modern cosmologists davies and tipler have had in mind when constructing the anthropic argument .",
    "the anthropic argument against steady - state theories hinted at by davies in the quotation above has been subsequently expanded and elaborated by tipler ( 1982 ) , and it seems only just to refer to its modern form as davies - tipler ( henceforth dt ) argument . in the latter work it has been shown that this argument applies to `` all universes which do not change with time in the large '' , and particularly those which satisfy the so - called perfect cosmological principle ( bondi and gold 1948 ; see the discussion in the sec . 3 below ) .",
    "the discrete markov chain recurrence of the type discussed by ellis and brundrit ( 1979 ) has also been used in the discussion of tipler ( 1982 ) , although , as we shall discuss below , its use is largely superfluous , since even a much weaker hypothesis produces the same disastrous effects for the cosmologies with past temporal infinities .",
    "the essence of tipler s ( 1982 ) discussion is that , given some usual symmetries of spacetime , for each event @xmath1 , its past light cone intersects all world lines corresponding to the history of an intelligent species .",
    "thus , at least one out of an infinite number of such species , could travel along the time - like geodesic to @xmath1 ( or just send signals ) . since @xmath1 may be any event , like our reading of tipler ( 1982 ) paper , or any other occurrence in the solar system , it is completely unexpected that we are not already part of an intelligent community of an arbitrarily long age . for the case of the universe satisfying the perfect cosmological principle ( i.e. the classical steady state universe )",
    "it is clearly seen from the penrose diagram shown in fig .",
    "again , it is important to stress * non - exclusivity * of this argument : even if 99.99% ( or indeed any fraction less than unity ) of intelligent communities arising at , say , @xmath2 would not expand further than some limited neighborhood",
    "_ q + @xmath3 _ , in an infinitely old universe there would still be at least one intelligent community at any point @xmath1 in spacetime , no matter how big _ @xmath4p - q@xmath4 / @xmath5 _ is .",
    "here we notice that instead of dealing with temporal parts , we are dealing with events in spacetime only .",
    "therefore , this argument is intrinsically formulated in terms of a relationist or reductionist theory of time ( e.g. newton - smith 1980 ) .",
    "however , it is not contingent upon acceptance of any particular theory of time . both relationist and absolutist pictures can accommodate the anthropic argument , provided that some additional specific requirements are satisfied .",
    "conversely , if these requirements are not satisfied , the argument is inapplicable , no matter whether we regard time as contingent upon world events or an absolute background to any event . in the absolutist picture , we need to speak of infinite number of non - trivial past events * in * time , instead of the time itself , which remains completely irrelevant to the argument . if such a series of events satisfy some additional constraints ( like requirement to include the creation of life and intelligence among the physically possible events , etc . ) , we are led to the same paradoxical conclusion .",
    "however , tipler ( 1982 ) goes farther than davies casual remark given in the context of an editorial comment , and claims that ,    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ [ s]ince all possible evolutionary sequences have occurred to the past of @xmath1 , one of these evolutionary sequences consists of the random assembly , without assistance of any intelligent species whatsoever , of a von neumann probe out of the atoms of interstellar space .",
    "such a random assembly would occur an infinite number of times to the past of @xmath1 , by homogeneity and stationarity in an infinite universe .",
    "at least one of these randomly assembled probes would have the motivations of a living being , that is to expand and reproduce without limit . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    this scenario , although not at all fantastic , raises several questions still lacking elaboration .",
    "how could we possibly know that the set of all `` favorably - motivated '' spontaneously assembled von neumann probes is of non - zero measure in the set of all such probes .",
    "the question of motivation , which is not so easily quantifiable , becomes crucial here .",
    "for instance , why not postulate an assembly of von neumann probe designed to search and destroy other von neumann probes ?",
    "what is the relative weight of colonizing ( vs. destructive , altruistic , introvert , etc . )",
    "motivation , and how can one determine it ?",
    "this motivation problem is avoided if we stick to a more restrictive requirement that only communities of evolved intelligent beings create such probes ( i.e. create them at timescales many orders of magnitude shorter than those required for the spontaneous assembly tipler describes ) . while one may argue that motivation is necessarily linked to the level of complexity , and",

    "complexity may be achieved through either technologization or `` biologization '' of the universe , and both lead to paradoxical consequences .",
    "let us introduce the following terminology . by the * weak dt * *",
    "* argument**we shall denote the version introduced by davies in his 1978 . note :    * weak dt : * _ cosmologies postulating inhabitable past temporal infinities must be rejected due to the absence of traces of arbitrarily old civilizations in our past light cone .",
    "_    the * strong version * is the one presented in tipler ( 1982 ) , as well as in monograph of barrow and tipler ( 1986 ) .",
    "let us formulate it by analogy with the weak argument in the following form :    * strong dt : * _ cosmologies postulating past temporal infinities must be rejected for absence of activities of spontaneously assembled self - reproducing automata in our past light cone , provided that matter in our past light cone satisfies constraints enabling such spontaneous assembly . _    in spite of the clumsiness of the latter formulation , it is clear , upon careful inspection , that the auxiliary assumptions in the stronger version are significantly more general than those in the weak version . as far as both versions are concerned , it is very important to notice that they do not guarantee the existence of the entities under consideration .",
    "let us consider the weak version first as the more important from the overall point of view of this work .",
    "it contains two stringent requirements which have been usually tacitly assumed ( and played an important historical role ) , but which should be explicitly discussed :    1 .   *",
    "the requirement of continuous inhabitability of at least a large enough region of causally connected space . * this",
    "should be regarded as a form of restriction on spatial inhomogeneities of the cosmological model under consideration .",
    "the question what counts as inhabitable is actually a very subtle one , since requirements of communities of intelligent observers may wildly differ . in any case",
    ", we expect that a sufficiently large thermodynamical disequilibrium must exist",
    ". therefore , the question whether a particular model satisfies this auxiliary assumption is contingent upon the answer from the same model to the much more famous problem of olbers paradox .",
    "we shall see below how various specific cosmological models enable continuous entropy production over an infinite interval of time .",
    "the existence of arbitrarily old civilizations . *",
    "the existence of such entities can hardly be considered obvious or even probable on any count . while the condition [ eq1 ] .",
    "is necessary , it is not a sufficient reason for accepting [ eq2 ]",
    ". obviously , apart from the physical environment , there are other reasons of a subtler and less quantifiable nature which could put an upper limit to the age and growth of civilizations even in a continuously inhabitable universe .",
    "now we perceive what is the ultimate recourse to the proponents of large - scale stationarity ( as well as opponents of the usage of anthropic principle for discriminating between the cosmological models ) . while the rejection of either [ eq1 ] . or [ eq2 ]",
    ". may seem easy enough , the careful inspection shows that it is a rather difficult endeavor .",
    "models which are characterized as stationary automatically satisfy [ eq1 ] . , and the reasons sometimes cited for rejection of [ eq2].mostly in the context of the seti debate ( see below)are entirely _ ad hoc_. non - stationary models may violate [ eq1 ] . , while retaining infinite number of past temporal events , although this violation is necessarily limited by spatial and temporal scales our observations are probing . limits following from the observations are already too relaxed for us to conclude that this is a sufficient reason for the rejection of [ eq1 ] . , even apart from the fact that no infinitely old non - stationary model has ever been investigated in much detail",
    "the strong dt argument necessarily endorses a following auxiliary assumption , analogous with the [ eq1 ] . in the weak case",
    ":    1 .    * the requirement of a continuously existing region in which the spontaneous assembly of matter can be achieved . *",
    "this presumes ( i ) availability of matter ( so that empty models , like the de sitter world , can be excluded ) , and ( ii ) restrictions on the physical state of matter .",
    "this second restrictions is hard to make precise in the general case , but it seems clear that we should exclude cases , for instance , in which the matter is at temperatures high enough for any level of organization to be immediately destroyed by thermal motions .",
    "it is generally much more difficult to construct an infinitely old cosmological model violating [ eq1] so that it can be brought even into a very superficial accord with the empirical data which any realistic theory must satisfy .",
    "however , since the physical issues involving a spontaneous assembly of the desired sort are not clear , we shall in further discussion concentrate on the weak version of the argument , while only occasionally referring to the stronger version .",
    "more stringent requirements [ eq1 ] . and",
    "produce make , for that matter , any hunt for loopholes in the argument itself ( and our consequent increase in understanding ) much more promising .    for the sake of better understanding of the issues involved , let us consider a counterexample of a cosmological model involving past temporal infinity which dt argument does not apply to .",
    "this is the lematre - eddington universe , which was quite popular in the 1925 - 1935 period ( e.g. eddington 1930 ) .",
    "this model belongs to the class of general - relativistic models with cosmological constant and without the big bang .",
    "therefore , it was very appealing from the point of view of resolving the age discrepancies between cosmological models and various astrophysical and geological timescales ( bok 1946 ; kragh 1996 ) . a good description of this model can be found in bondi s classic textbook on cosmology ( bondi 1961 ) .",

    "this has greatly attracted investigators since it seemingly permits an arbitrarily long timescale of evolution .",
    "the picture of the history of the universe derived from this model , then , was that for an infinite period in the distant past there was a completely homogeneous distribution of matter in equilibrium in the einstein state until some event started off the expansion , which has been going on at an increasing pace ever since .",
    "the condensation of the galaxies and the stars from the primeval matter took place at the time the expansion began , but this development was stopped later by the decrease of average density due to the progress of the expansion .",

    "however , this is a `` false '' infinity , at least in the context of anthropic reasoning , because the period of time in which there are conditions enabling the creation of intelligent observers is necessarily finite .",
    "in addition , this period is approximately equal to the time past since the beginning of the expansion . in the leibnitz - berkeley - machian relationist picture ,",
    "the time itself does not really exist before the onset of instabilities , i.e. the universal expansion .",
    "the period of complete homogeneity can be regarded as a state analogous to the epochs of complete dominance of love or strife in the cosmology of empedocles or , even more accurately to the time before the motion began in anaxagoras cosmology .. ] in both cosmologies it is necessary to invoke a state which prevents propagation of information from an arbitrarily distant past to the present epoch . in both cases",
    "this goal is achieved by postulating states with a sufficiently high degree of symmetry .",
    "obviously , in the case of the eddington - lematre universe , the anthropic argument is inapplicable , since the * effective past * is finite .",
    "intelligent observers ( or spontaneously assembled von neumann probes ! ) possess only a finite time for technologization of their cosmic environment .",
    "this is valid for the generic version of the eddington - lematre model . of course",
    ", the model pretending to describe the real universe is normalized to the present expansion rate , and therefore we conclude that this effective age is similar to the age of galaxies , or again of the order of @xmath8 ( @xmath9 being the present - day measured value of the hubble `` constant '' ) .",
    "therefore , the incompatibility argument in the core of the dt argument is lost and reduces to the much weaker fermi `` paradox '' , as we shall see in the further discussion .",

    "the same applies to the distant future of the universe in which , according to many models , the state of heat death is bound to occur .",
    "barrow and tipler ( 1978 ) , suggest that a formally infinite future should be substituted with a finite interval , through an appropriate coordinate transformation . a sort of counterexample , confirming the general thesis that the cosmic time established by the weyl postulate should not be regarded as sacrosanct , is the diverging number of ( possible ) events in the finite temporal vicinity of either the initial or final global singularity .",
    "in such a situation a finite cosmic time may be less appropriate than an alternative infinite timescale ( e.g.  misner 1969).[multiblock footnote omitted ] for instance , the ever - decreasing number of events in the world approaching future heat death ( in the framework of some particular cosmological model ) could well be described , in the relationist picture , with the finite time interval remaining ; therefore , the time between the initial singularity and the final heat death could be represented by a ( -@xmath13 , 0 ) interval .",
    "is such a rescaling just a mathematico - philosophical perversion lacking any relevance for the physical world ?",
    "it seems that the answer is firmly in the negative .",
    "while the elaboration lies beyond the scope of the present paper , it is enough to point out that the famous `` biological scaling hypothesis '' of freeman dyson is just one guise of the re - scaling of time in the relationist context ( dyson 1979 ) .",
    "many results in the nascent discipline of physical eschatology depend on the dyson s hypothesis , and it is obvious that it s being true or else has a real , physical consequences .    in brief ,",
    "the past temporal infinity in the eddington - lematre model is * trivial * from the anthropic point of view , and therefore dt argument is inapplicable .",
    "thus , one should reduce the realm of applicability of the latter argument to cosmological models containing * non - trivial past infinities * , i.e.  an infinite chain of non - trivial events .",
    "can * in principle * describe any event whatsoever . here",
    "we perceive the connection between the anthropic argument and the relationist _ vs. _",
    "absolutist controversy in the most plastic manner . ]",
    "the residual problem in each case is what is traditionally called fermi s ( or the `` great silence '' ) paradox .",
    "it should be immediately noted that dt argument , as outlined above , is different from the unlimited entropy argument usually used against cosmologies with past infinities ( although the two are related , as we shall see ) : why havent irreversible processes , in accordance with the thermodynamical laws , generated infinite amounts of entropy in the universe by now ?",
    "this is not just the classical question of the thermodynamical disequilibrium between the dark night sky and bright stars , but also the question of our very existence , which is obviously contingent upon the large - scale disequilibrium .",
    "davies himself used the same argument against the hoyle - narlikar conformally invariant cosmology in his review of the latter in _ nature _",
    "( davies 1975 ) , and tipler ( 1982 ) mentions it in somewhat restricted sense , as olbers paradox ( again , expanded discussion may be found in barrow and tipler 1986 ) .",
    "the classical steady - state theory alleviates this problem by the continuous creation of matter , and an additional assumption that newly created matter is in a low - entropy state . but",
    "cosmologies excluding creation of matter ( such as , for instance , the einstein original static universe , or the hoyle - narlikar conformally invariant cosmology ) are faced with this argument in a very serious form . still ,",
    "this thermodynamical argument against steady - state models is qualitatively different from dt argument we are dealing with , although both show how difficulties arise when currently observable processes are extrapolated backward in the past eternity .",
    "the latter argument is based , essentially , on the diametrically opposed process : growth of complexity , which results in emergence of technological communities at some finite time ( kardashev and strelnitskij 1988 ) . in the former case ,",
    "we perceive increases in entropy in our laboratory experiments ; in the latter case , we perceive our laboratories themselves as  in a sense  the very products of our former observations .",
    "in addition , attempts to reject the hypothesis of the infinite age of the universe by a kantian form of _ a priori _ reasoning are essentially different from the anthropic argument ; the former is also known as the _ kalam _ cosmological argument ( craig 1979 ) .",
    "one of the latest of these attempts has been made by gerald whitrow ( 1978 ) , which immediately caused many , chiefly negative , reactions ( popper 1978 ; bell 1979 ; davies 1983 ; grnbaum 1991 ; oppy 1995 ; see , however , craig 1979 , 1990 ) . dt argument",
    ", on the contrary , is not _ a priori _ : it applies to the physically well - defined sub - class of universes with infinite past and it is firmly based in empirical ( though non - standard ) evidence  the one on the existence of a technological civilization in vicinity of at least one point of spacetime .",
    "thus , dt argument can be interpreted as the much stronger version of the familiar `` great silence '' or `` astrosociological '' problem ( e.g.  brin 1983 ; kardashev and strelnitskij 1988 ; almar 1989 ; gindilis and rudnitskii 1993 ; lipunov 1997 ; also known as the fermi s `` paradox '' ) .",
    "fermi s legendary question `` where are they ? '' applies to the absence of any observable technologization of the universe , as confronted by optimistic views on the multitude of advanced extraterrestrial civilizations in our galaxy .",
    "as calculated by many researchers ( starting with the pioneering study of hart 1975 ) , the timescale for the colonization of the milky way galaxy by a technological society only a very little ahead of us in the technological sense is very much smaller than the age of our galaxy .",

    ", we wish to investigate the limit @xmath19 ( in lipunov s presentation ) . clearly ,",
    "the dt argument ( as well as practically all other aspects of anthropic reasoning ) is of great relevance not only for cosmology , but for astrobiology and the prospects for seti , too .",
    "since the latter topics are of potentially unprecedent significance to the social and cultural history of human race , this reaffirms the necessity of investigating all arguments of relevance to the question of survival and evolutionary histories of intelligent observers in the cosmological context .",
    "this is a convenient point to reemphasize that ( as noted among others , by lipunov himself ) before einstein and friedmann  but after the breakdown of the medieval creation dogma  there were no principal differences between the two arguments .",
    "the traditional view of xviii , xix and early xx century intellectuals has been that the universe has always existed in conditions not very different from those observable around us today .",
    "this makes the fact that the dt argument appeared on the cosmological scene so late rather strange .",
    "could it appear earlier ? it is important to stress that the more general problem of lack of information from the past has its underground history deeply interwoven with the striving for understanding natural history .",
    "the problem , as he have hinted , was open as soon as the dogma of creation in 4004 bc was rejected , openly or tacitly .",
    "it was , in fact , in the domain of earth science ( rather than in astronomy ) where the dam was broken : it is often called the discovery of `` deep time '' or `` geological time '' ( e.g.ward 1998 ; baxter 2004 ) . and it was not accidental that the man usually credited for this discovery , scottish naturalist james hutton ( 1726@xmath61797 ) , was the first to reflect on the basic issue of habitability of the indefinitely ( or even infinitely ) old universe .",
    "following the lead of gould ( 1987 ) , we may approach hutton s solution of the problem of the duration of the past vs. limited information transmitted from those epochs , noting how final causes motivate the whole idea ; today , we might cite the strong anthropic principle to the similar ends .",
    "hutton imagined a `` world machine '' : his mechanicistic worldview found excellent field of applicability in the geology of his day .",
    "erosion of the soil is compensated by the uplifting of mountains ; any other particular tendency is contrasted with an opposite one which is bound to return the world to one or more previous stages .",
    "hutton s vision is a geological analog of the empedoclean cyclic universe ; hence the most famous passage of his , ending the 1788 short version of his _ theory of the earth _ :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ if the succession of worlds is established in the system of nature , it is in vain to look for anything higher in the origin of the earth .",
    "the result , therefore , of our present enquiry is that we find no vestige of a beginning  no prospect of an end . _",

    "the final cause in question was nothing less than what modern astrobiologists would call * planetary habitability * : time and again , hutton writes of `` mechanism of the globe , by which it is adapted to the purpose of being a habitable world . ''",

    "note that the age of the earth ( and perhaps the rest of the universe ) was considered indefinite , but not infinite .",
    "infinite age would conflict with hutton s profound christian religiosity , and he repeatedly implies that the ultimate questions of the beginning and the end of the world are not part of the scientific discourse .",
    "however , with profound subtlety , he builds an insurance against lucretian `` eternal monuments '' in his choice of words : not that there is no beginning ",
    "there are only no * vestige * of the beginning !",
    "the cyclic nature of the world machine erases the relevant information from previous cycles and `` cleans the slate '' . but",
    "it is still internally inconsistent : if the world is made for man , how comes that the achievements of previous generations of humans are also erased ? and if we accept pluralism about abodes of life ( which was rather standard in hutton s time ; see , for instance , fontenelle 1767 ) , than it is very difficult to conceive an explanation for the failure of intelligent beings to overcome the slow processes of erosion and decay which erase information from previous cycles .",
    "empedocles at least postulated catastrophic , singular events encompassing the entire universe ; hutton s world machine is much less efficient in this respect .",
    "this dichotomy is important to keep in mind before we return to the grand cosmological scene .",
    "in order to better assess the importance of dt argument and its application to the cosmologies with infinite past , we shall briefly consider the conceptual foundations of the most famous and historically most influential such cosmology , the 1948 .",
    "model of hermann bondi , thomas gold and fred hoyle ( bondi and gold 1948 ; hoyle 1948 ) .",
    "although there is some controversy whether the classical steady - state cosmology represented a single entity or two disjointed theories ( that of bondi - gold and the version of hoyle ) , we shall refer to them as the classical steady - state model , discussing , where relevant , particular differences among the two versions ( hoyle 1949 ) . while hoyle s",
    "version is generally superior , being formulated in the language of the classical field theory , for our purposes it is , in fact , the perfect cosmological principle ( henceforth pcp ) of bondi and gold ( 1948 ) that makes the important point most clearly .",
    "its essentially non - mathematical character makes it even more transparent in the sense of giving the core formulation of uniformitarianism in cosmology ( balashov 1994 ) .",
    "one fact that remained largely overlooked is that the classical steady - state cosmology displayed one of the very first instances of anthropic reasoning in modern science . in the founding paper , bondi and gold ( 1948 )",

    "however , it is also important to perceive that the paragraph quoted above contains a characteristic example of the anti - empedoclean double standard deeply rooted in modern science .",
    "namely , our existence is taken into account in physical theory when it is convenient , in this particular example when it comes to proving that the entropy of the universe is far from the maximal value .",
    "at the same time , other consequences of our existence as a technological civilization , which lead to the dt argument , are conveniently ignored .",
    "it can be hardly contested that it was exactly our capability to adapt and technologize nature which led , among all other things , to advances in mathematics and astronomy leading to the formulation of the classical steady - state theory . in",
    "what follows , we shall show how the dt argument is operationalized in the context of this theory .    pcp formulated by bondi and gold ( 1948 ) ,",
    "can be simply expressed as the homogeneity of the universe in 4-dimensional spacetime .",
    "this is just the generalization of so - called cosmological principle ( cf .",
    "milne 1940 ) , which assumes homogeneity in space , but not necessarily in time .",
    "mathematically speaking , pcp can be formulated as a necessity to have a timelike killing vector in the classical robertson - walker metric .",
    "thus , pcp leads to the line - element of the well - known ( de sitter ) form ( in usual @xmath20 units ) : @xmath21,\\ ] ] where @xmath22 is the true constant , and can take any real value .",
    "now , @xmath23 leads to a static universe , which can be discarded not only on clear observational grounds , but ( even more interesting from our point of view ) from the thermodynamical considerations as well .",
    "olbers paradox testifies that the universe has not reached the state of thermodynamical equilibrium , which is impossible to avoid in an infinitely old static cosmological model ( see the celebrated classic discussion in bondi 1961 ) .",
    "case corresponds to infinite euclidean static universe , similar to the einstein original static model ( einstein 1917 ) .",
    "the difference lies in topology , since the einstein model is topologically closed .",
    "however , the einstein model also ( albeit trivially ) satisfies the perfect cosmological principle .",
    "although we can not delve deeper into this topic , it is worth noticing that dt argument applies to flat euclidean as well as einstein closed static models .",
    "the absence of the large - scale expansion in these static models makes the expansion of life and intelligence significantly easier .",
    "even the hierarchical distribution of galaxies and supergalactic structures , like in charlier original fractal model ( charlier 1922 ; kalitzin 1961 ) or in segal s chronometric cosmology ( e.g.  segal 1978 ) , does not alleviate this problem .",
    "no distance is out of reach in an infinitely old static universe .",
    "moreover , we may speculate , following barrow and tipler ( 1986 ) , that the absence of global relativistic effects like shear and torsion in such universes makes the technologization of ever larger spatial volumes even more important , since there are no negentropy sources for information processing other than the matter fields . of course",
    ", the basic problem of all static cosmologies is olbers paradox , i.e.  global thermodynamical disequilibrium , so in a sense the existence of even a single intelligent observer is _ reductio ad absurdum _ of such cosmologies ! ]",
    "the case @xmath24 , which corresponds to the universal contraction , presents a situation in which the radiation of distant sources is shifted to the violet end of the spectrum , resulting in an infinitely bright sky background in the manner still less acceptable than in the case of olbers paradox in the static universe .",
    "therefore , the only possible conclusion is that @xmath25 , which is the realistic case of the expanding universe .",
    "part of the appeal of the steady - state concept can be found in words of sciama ( quoted according to kragh 1996 ) :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ the steady - state theory opens up the exciting possibility that the laws of physics may indeed determine the contents of the universe through the requirement that all features of the universe be self - propagating ... the requirement of self - propagation is thus a powerful new principle with whose aid we see for the first time the possibility of answering the question why things are as they are without merely saying : it is because they were as they were . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    however , as we shall see below , the germ of doom lies exactly in the concept of self - propagation , since it seems to be incapable of correctly accounting for a specific `` feature '' of the universe , namely us . in other words , if we accept the empedoclean picture ( in which the biological and mental evolution is an inherent and necessary part of the cosmological evolution ) , than although it has to be self - propagating , the rise of intelligence at the same time * must not * be self - propagating .",
    "the basic violations of uniformity we empirically notice in the universe are galaxies .",
    "newly created matter is * continuously * condensed in galaxies , and although the details of this process have remained controversial ( sciama 1955 ; harwit 1961 ) , mainly because insufficient theoretical work was devoted to it prior to the universal rejection of the steady - state picture in mid-1960s , the predictive power of pcp is manifested here once again .",
    "the answer offered by the steady - state outlook to the question of the age distribution of galaxies on a sufficiently large scale is essentially independent of physical details of galaxy formation . in the classical steady - state model ,",
    "the distribution function of galaxies is simply @xmath26 where h is the hubble constant , a true constant in contradistinction to the friedmann models . taking into account eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) the average age of galaxies is simply @xmath27 this illustrates a beautiful simplicity which pcp imposes on the theory : the average age of galaxies is calculated without any reference to the complicated physics of galaxy formation .",
    "however , we should keep in mind a historical fact of great importance : the estimates of the hubble constant relevant in the late 1940s were in gross violation of what we today know as the plausible interval for that quantity . for @xmath28 km s@xmath29 , which was the then reigning hubble measurement ,",
    "the friedman - lematre cosmology ( which soon became , following a derogatory comment of fred hoyle in a bbc radio broadcast , the big bang cosmology ) has had a serious conflict with the age of the earth and chemical elements ( e.g.  bok 1946 ) . at the time of formulation of the steady - state theory , @xmath30",
    "was considered small ( @xmath31 yrs , due to the gross overestimate of the value of hubble constant ) , and the milky way has already been an extraordinary old galaxy , which certainly implied that surrounding galaxies are far less probable to achieve the same degree of chemical and biological evolution .",
    "although this circumstance in fact does not alleviate the dt argument , it certainly does have a significant psychological effect , making problems with technologization literally much more distant .",
    "the fraction @xmath32 of galaxies older than the age @xmath33 is given by @xmath34 this is the mathematical root of the problem , reflecting the fact that the exponential function is everywhere finite .",
    "for instance , if we take @xmath30 to be an order of magnitude higher , in accordance with the today s best knowledge on the magnitude of the hubble constant , dt argument quoted above gains force . since the fraction of galaxies that are older than age @xmath35 yrs is given by eq .",
    "( [ eq4 ] ) , it follows that there are almost 2% of all galaxies in any large enough comoving volume which are * twice * the age of the milky way .",
    "we should keep in mind at all times that our galaxy is * already * old enough for the fermi s paradox to be formulated ( as briefly discussed in  2 ) .",
    "the issue of different predictions of ages of galaxies in different cosmological models has been present on the cosmological scene since the very beginning of controversy between the classical steady - state and what will ultimately be called the standard big bang model .",
    "this problem is attractive because of the possibility of observational verification on spatial scales smaller than those required for most of the other cosmological tests .",
    "studies of convenient age indicators in a large enough sample of galaxies could , in principle , be performed in order to answer the question whether galaxies have approximately the same age , or span a wide distribution , as given by eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) . in practical terms , however , the task is extremely difficult , since even the age of the milky way ( by far the best known galaxy , of course ) has not been known with less than 20% uncertainty until very recently .",
    "therefore this sort of empirical evidence has not been actually used very much against the classical steady - state model .",
    "the age - based attack on the steady - state theory was initiated by gamow , who in a short note in 1954 ( gamow 1954 ) , pointed out that after the baade s revision of cosmological distance and timescales , steady - state theory faces the problem of underestimating ages of galaxies in our vicinity .",
    "however , it is clear in the gamow paper that he does not find the so far measured galactic ages very convincing .",
    "the same age discrepancy issue has been raised by the great american observational astronomer , ivan king , who in 1961 pointed out that the ages of stellar populations in most of nearby galaxies are estimated to be about @xmath36 , which is not in agreement with the first order prediction of the steady - state theory ( king 1961 ) . in a short , but very comprehensive reply to this objection , hoyle and narlikar",
    "have suggested several weaknesses in this argument and put forward at least one problem which outlived the cosmological controversy and remains puzzling to this day ( hoyle and narlikar 1962 ) .",
    "first of all , they pointed out that judging confidently the age of galaxies means knowing with certainty the evolutionary effects dictated by intragalactic physics .",
    "as a crucial example , they offer uncertain status of the morphological types of galaxies : are they constants for all times , or do they change with cosmic time ?",
    "the latter alternative precludes any conclusion based on assumptions relating stellar populations with the morphological type ( a standard procedure in astrophysics ) unless we know the exact law of evolutionary change .",
    "it is interesting to note that hoyle and narlikar in connection with this point suggest a scheme of transformation of hubble s morphological types which is still an acceptable hypothesis today .",
    "some observational indications to that effect , as well as theoretical explanations bearing on the nature of dark matter , have only recently been reported ( braine and combes 1993 ; pfenniger , combes and martinet 1994 ) .",
    "finally , hoyle and narlikar in their 1962 paper indicate ( in close connection with their subsequent `` radical departure '' ; see hoyle and narlikar 1966 ) the possibility of temporal correlations due to collective effects .",
    "this idea will be realized in detail in the so - called revised or quasi - steady state model of 1990s .",
    "if galaxies are formed in groups ( i.e.  on the higher level of structure ) , it may be assumed that the galactic ages are correlated .",
    "therefore , it is natural to expect that galaxies in the vicinity of the milky way ( those amenable to detailed observations and age measurements ) will have similar ages ( both among themselves , and in comparison with our galaxy ) .",
    "as we have discussed in the introductory part of this study , the dt argument has been used for the first time against a stationary cosmological model with closed topology advanced by george f. r. ellis and his collaborators ( ellis 1978 ; ellis et al .",
    "a similar cosmological model has been developed in the mid-1990s by american physicist peter phillips ( 1994a , b ) .",
    "these models , sharing several key similarities , we shall call the * closed steady - state models*. their basic characteristic is that stationarity is achieved by rejection of the `` usual '' cosmological principle ( not to mention pcp ) .",
    "in other words , the temporal steady - state is paid for by abandoning spatial homogeneity .",
    "it is a matter of philosophical taste whether one considers the price too high or not .",
    "however , it is difficult to avoid being disturbed by elaboration of ellis et al .",
    "that    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ while isotropy is directly observable , homogeneity ( on a cosmological scale ) is not . in the standard discussions",
    "the assumption of homogeneity is made _ a priori _ , either directly , or in some equivalent form ( e.g.  as the assumption that the universe is isotropic for _ all _ observers ... ) , and so is not subjected to observational verification .",
    "accordingly , the standard proof of the expansion of the universe is based on an unverified _ a priori _ assumption . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    with the intention of investigating consequences of abandoning the homogeneity postulate and retaining einstein field equations , ellis and his collaborators have reached a model of a topologically closed universe with two privileged `` points '' .",
    "we are located near one them , and that is not accidental , because ( in accordance with wap ) it is expected for us to be located in the regions possessing the necessary properties for the origination and evolution of complex ( biological ) systems .",
    "this occurs near the `` center '' of the universe ( it is most natural to use the term for our pole of the manifold , by analogy with a 3-sphere ) .",
    "opposite of the center is located the singularity surrounded by hot matter , simulating in this manner the initial singularity in the friedmann models .",
    "however , in this static model , the singularity is * co - present * with everything that exists , not preceding it .",
    "obviously , it makes the model more appealing from the epistemological point of view : although laws of nature break down at singularity , in ellis et al .",
    "model it is not forever inaccessible in the past , but could , in principle , be investigated using the methods and apparatus of modern science .",
    "this co - present singularity can be intuitively understood as being the `` enclosure '' or `` mantle '' surrounding the universe .",
    "its major purpose is to play the role of a recycling facility in the global cosmological ecology , since the static nature of the universe makes recycling of high - entropy matter necessary . in the framework of this model",
    "it is achieved through a streaming of high - entropy matter ( mainly in the form of heavy elements synthesized in stellar nucleosynthesis ) toward the singularity , where it is dissociated and returned to the universe in the form of low - entropy matter ( presumably hot single baryons ) . in this manner",
    "the total entropy stays the same at all epochs . beside this streaming ( which does not change the net mass distribution )",
    ", there is no systematic motion : observable redshift is of purely gravitational origin .",
    "the co - present singularity in ellis et al.model bears a resemblance to the _ apeiron _ of anaximandros out of which worlds are formed and unto which they ultimately dissociate .    in the cosmological model of phillips ( 1994a , b ) there are also two singular points , this time called the northern and southern pole .",
    "the milky way galaxy is located in close proximity to the northern pole of the universe ( from the same anthropic reasons as in the ellis et al .",
    "model ) . in contradistinction",
    "to the ellis et al .",
    "model , here we have a systematic motion of galaxies , in direction from the northern to the southern pole .",
    "this motion , however , is laminar and stationary , so that the universe in general always offers the same picture to a typical observer .",
    "metric coefficients are independent of time , and in this sense the model could be considered static .",
    "this is a situation somewhat similar to the famous de sitter cosmological solution for an empty universe , which is nominally static , although we now interpret it as describing the exponential expansion .",
    "since this large - scale motion is present , the observed redshift is partially of gravitational and partially of doppler origin . in the phillips model",
    "there are two postulated types of matter , which he calls primary and secondary matter , where the matter to which we are accustomed to is of secondary type .",
    "primary matter is moving in the opposite direction ( from the southern to the northern pole ) , so that the generalized form of matter conservation is preserved , while the two types of matter never interact except in singular points at the poles .",
    "the details of thermodynamics of this model have been elaborated in better detail than in the ellis et al.model ( phillips 1994b ) , wherein some observational tests of this version of closed stationary models have been proposed .",
    "these empirical tests are fatal to closed stationary models . in the very original paper of ellis et al .",
    "( 1978 ) , it is shown that this model is not able to account properly for the so - called ( @xmath37 curve , i.e.  the relationship between the apparent magnitude and redshift of cosmologically distributed sources of radiation .",
    "it is harder to disprove phillips model , since the gravitational and doppler redshifts are delicately entangled",
    ". the cleanest test could be the measurement of peculiar motion of distant sources with respect to the universal reference frame as defined by the microwave background radiation .",
    "this experiment is possible to perform in the case of rich galaxy clusters , by means of the sunyaev - zeldovich effect ( sunyaev and zeldovich 1980 ) .",
    "the prediction of phillips model is that more distant clusters will tend to have significantly larger peculiar motions than those nearby .",
    "recent measurements indicate that this is not the case , and there is no meaningful way to save the theory ( phillips 2001 , private communication ) .",
    "therefore , we may consider stationary closed cosmologies to be rejected by observations .",
    "however , they are useful for us in the historical sense .",
    "dt argument against them continues to hold and is even more forceful than for the case of the classical steady - state .",
    "it is reasonable to assume that in closed universes , the cross - section for contact ( and technologization ) of an advanced civilization could literally cover a large fraction of the entire universe . since our position is necessarily privileged in these universes ( hence we observe galaxies and the limiting singularity to be nearly isotropic around our position ) , it is only plausible to assume that the same anthropic reasons which establish such a situation are acting for * any * intelligent community which could * ever * arise in such a universe . but in that case ,",
    "where the choice of places of birth of intelligent observers is necessarily finite , it is very easy to see that the world line of any civilization older than ours will pass through the present of the solar system . and in these models , again",
    ", conditions for the emergence of intelligent observers ( in a limited spatial region , admittedly ) persist for an infinite time , and arbitrarily old civilizations are a possibility .",
    "the difference in the nature of large - scale motions in the two models considered is irrelevant for our purposes , since the peculiar motions of nearby ( with respect to any intelligent observers ) galaxies are in any case much smaller than the rate by which the contact cross - section for advanced civilization increases .",
    "one could imagine the situation in which an advanced civilization emerges in a privileged region of space ( that is , in the vicinity of our present position ) , and gradually expands to encompass the entire `` favorable '' spatial region ( being of finite size , as just a part of the finite universe ) .",
    "it is reasonable to argue that in the infinite past such scenario happened at least once [ by the same token as the conclusions of ellis and brundrit ( 1979 ) apply with respect to spatial infinity ] .",
    "there are two possible follow - ups .",
    "such supercivilization could either exist for a definite , or for indefinite period of cosmic time . in the first alternative ,",
    "the universe we currently inhabit must be `` recycled '' , as davies warned ; no mechanism for such a `` de - technologization '' is known or even envisaged at present .",
    "since we can envisage ( if only very vaguely ) the methods through which advanced communities of intelligent beings may technologize ever larger spatial volumes of the universe , and in the case of a topologically closed universe , even the entire such universe ( e.g. tipler 1994 ) , a humble humean approach suggests that we choose a `` smaller miracle''that a supercivilization can exist for an indefinite time .    in any case , we may safely conclude that in the universes of finite size and infinite age ( as modelled by ellis et al .",
    "and phillips theories ) the anthropic argument necessarily leads us to paradoxes , if only we do not restrict the growth of complexity , socio - technological advance of intelligent societies and their technologization of the environment by definitional _ fiat_.",
    "it goes without saying that the situation is equally grave for the other model universes in which the universe is infinite in both spatial and temporal extension , but in which the conditions favorable to life persist in either a finite or infinite region for an infinite time .",
    "the main lesson of the anthropic spatial selection such as our proximity to the boreal pole in phillips model is that this form of self - selection allows for most of the universe to be uninhabitable , and still retain dt argument .",
    "this is valid even in the case in which the universe is infinite and uninhabitable except for the finite region around our present location .    as we can see in retrospect , the very fact of applying dt argument against closed steady - state theories demonstrates that pcp is too strong a requirement for the operation of the argument .",
    "as tipler ( 1982 ) stressed , only stationarity and limited local properties are required . from a philosophical point of view",
    ", it should be noted that it is also necessary that the rise of intelligent communities and their expansion are * possible * within a given astrophysical environment .",
    "this is self - evident , since the humanity exists for a finite time in a relatively stable environment , and expansion over interstellar or even intergalactic lengthscales is , if not yet a reality , at least quite conceivable from our point of view .",
    "the ultimate reason for this is our empirical knowledge on the constancy of physical laws and their modes of operation over these lengthscales . in a strongly inhomogeneous universe , or universe with random fluctuations on the scales of ,",
    "say , 1 pc , the argument looses its power .",
    "however , according to the wap selection , while free to ask questions about possible physical origin of such a hypothetical bizarre behaviour , we should not seek to confirm our conjectures by performing experiments and observations in the real world , because such specific circumstance would preclude our existence ( earman 1987 ) .",
    "therefore , it seems that in the cases similar to the ellis et al . and",
    "phillips cosmologies , the dt argument can not justifiably be regarded as contingent on anything stronger than wap , as barrow and tipler ( 1986 ) tend to do .",
    "one of the possible recourses for a steady - state proponent in this quandary concerns invoking the strong anthropic principle ( henceforth sap ) in its teleological interpretation .",
    "it is necessary , therefore , to pause for a moment and consider the meaning and possible interpretations of the sap , since it has been and still is a considerable source of confusion in the field of anthropic research . in the famous exposition of carter ( 1974 )",
    ", several important anthropic principles were defined . among them ,",
    "the most speculative and thought - provoking has been exactly the sap which states that :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ ... the universe ( and hence the fundamental parameters on which it depends ) must be such as to admit the creation of observers within it at some stage .",
    "_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    unfortunately , there is no such thing as * the * definition of sap .",
    "widely used definition of barrow and tipler ( 1986 ) in their influential monograph , has somewhat different overtones from the carter s original :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ the universe must have those properties which allow life to develop within it at some stage in its history . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    as noted and discussed in some detail by earman ( 1987 ) and bostrom ( 2002 ) , these definitions are not equivalent , and the one in barrow and tipler certainly possesses ( as , parenthetically , the entire monograph ) strong teleological overtones . while one can plausibly argue that there is in fact nothing particularly `` strong '' about sap in the carter s formulation if it is regarded as pointing to * blanks * for future physical explanation ( balashov 1990 ) , the somewhat heated discussion of this issue is outside of the scope of the present study . without entering into a general debate on the merits and shortcomings of the teleological discourse in cosmology , it should be noted that it arose as a natural reaction to the overuse of the copernican principle in natural sciences , and particularly in cosmology . from this overuse",
    "follows , for instance , uncritical ( and often even unconscious ) acceptance of cosmological homogeneity , discussed in the section devoted to closed steady state models . from a prejudice",
    "that nothing in our position is special one may draw bizarre conclusions , for example that it requires explanation that we are not right now located in the intergalactic space , since the latter fills more than 99.99% of the volume of the universe , and any spatial location not in it is truly exceptional on a grand scale . understanding that we live in _ a priori _ very improbable universe ! ] is an encouragement to teleological projects of various kinds , of which not all must be unscientific ( barrow and tipler 1986 ; tipler 1994 ) .",
    "one of strategies for refuting the usage of the dt argument lies exactly in assuming that the appearance of intelligent observers is not only of low probability , but in the literal sense impossible .",
    "this has been acknowledged , among others , by ellis and brundit ( 1979 ) , who concluded that `` the existence of life on our own planet does _ not _ prove that this probability is non - zero '' . with that kind of approach ,",
    "our existence is a miracle , which has happened for some inexplicable , theological reason .",
    "this is an extreme anti - empedoclean attitude in the framework of which the biological ( or at least anthropological and psychological ) evolution is completely transcendent compared to the physical one .",
    "the ontological gap between the two seems irreducible .",
    "this attitude is traditionally ( although in a shallow , and sometimes openly incorrect , interpretation ) linked to the major religious doctrines , but it is interesting to note that the same sort of thinking is to be found in writings of thinkers of opposite  or at least anticlerical  orientation , such as sir fred hoyle .    in his extraordinarily interesting and well - written autobiographical reminiscences ,",

    "was the existence of life a result of a set of freakish coincidences in nuclear physics ?",
    "could it be that the laws of physics are not the strictly invariant mathematical forms we take them to be ? could there be variations in the forms , with the universe being a far more complex structure than we take it to be in all our cosmological theories ?",
    "if so , life would perforce exist only where the nuclear adjustments happened to be favorable , removing the need for arbitrary coincidences , just as one finds in the modern formulation of the weak anthropic principle . or is the universe teleological , with the laws deliberately designed to permit the existence of life , the common religious position ?",
    "a further possibility , suggested by the modern strong anthropic principle , did not occur to me in 1953  namely , that it is our existence that forces the nuclear details to be the way they are , which is essentially the common religious position taken backwards . before ridiculing this last possibility , as quite a few scientists tend to do , it is necessary , as i pointed out before , to explain the condensation of the universal wave function through the intervention of human consciousness . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    even more explicit is the discussion presented in his philosophically -

    "hutton would be happy with this solution ! the explanation of absence of extraterrestrial technology on large scales ( that is , both fermi s paradox in standard cosmology and dt problem in an eternal universe ) lies in the fact that the probability of the spontaneous conception and subsequent evolution of any intelligent observers is * exactly zero*. , and from this draws a conclusion that the universe must be much older than @xmath8 , as well as that a variation of the classical panspermia hypothesis must be a correct explanation for the presence of life on earth .",
    "however , the panspermia hypothesis only increases the available 4-volume for random physical processes to bring about life ; this volume still remains finite . on the other hand ,",
    "the universe of the classical steady - state theory ( as well as hoyle s later revised steady - state alternative ) is truly infinite in both space and time . ] the very title of important article of kardashev and strelnitskij ( 1988 ) , _ supercivilizations as possible products of the progressive evolution of matter _ is simply * wrong * on this view , since there are underlying * physical * reason for impossibility of transition between evolution of matter and that of life , and later mind itself ( presumably leading to the state of `` supercivilization '' ) .",
    "before we reject this as an obsolete and ridiculously dogmatic viewpoint , one should note that this view is probably the only way known so far capable of _ prima facie _ accounting for the often overlooked wigner s result that , within the quantum mechanical formalism , the probability of spontaneous creation of living systems is equal to zero ( wigner 1967 , p.  200 ) . quantum mechanical considerations also motivated hoyle , in particular in his 1982 paper .    as pointed out by tipler ( 2001 , private communication ) , this picture is difficult to defend along several lines .",
    "major problem with this sort of argument is that it assumes that not merely intelligent life , but the specific species _ homo sapiens _ ,",
    "is doing the selecting of the actual universe .",
    "there is no positive reason for belief that humanity is ultimately privileged in this way for participation in `` creation '' of the universe . on the contrary , as the father of the very label `` anthropic principle '' brandon carter emphasized ,",
    "every form of intelligent life is in exactly the same situation .",
    "of course , the purpose of such carter s opinion is exactly to excise , together with anthropocentrism , the teleological mode of explanation , and the answer we consider in this section is manifestly teleological .",
    "however , it is not necessary to be dogmatic either way in considering these issues .",
    "this danger may be avoided on account of a general attitude ( see , for instance , the discussion in sklar 1985 ) that a metaphysical conjecture can be accepted as an explanatory hypothesis , if capable of accounting for the existing empirical evidence , and in particular in cases where the empirical evidence is slim .    along these guidelines",
    ", one may speculate that more intelligent and more advanced species would be better at `` creating '' universes than we could ever hope to be ( harrison 1995 ) . even in the cases of manifestly teleological schemes , such as the omega - point theory of tipler ( 1994 )",
    ", there is nothing inherently advantageous in belonging * specifically * to _ homo sapiens sapiens_. our future descendants , the beings who will ultimately realize the purpose of the universe in reaching the omega point , can not with certainty be characterized as closer to us than we are to birds and fishes . by openly recognizing the issue of the melioristic universe in all its ramifications , tipler ( 1994 ) shows that teleology needs not necessarily to be burdened by dogmas of the times past .",
    "the same lesson should , undoubtedly , apply to the teleological mode of accounting for dt argument in universes with an infinite past series of events .    fortunately , we are * not * in the actual position to choose between these alternatives , since our observable universe is certainly of finite age",
    ". however , this dilemma can resurface if we find that the larger whole in which the observable universe is just an embedded part , possesses a structure characterized by the past temporal infinity .",
    "we shall return to this point in  7 . for the moment",
    ", it should be noted that there is another possible recourse for the steady - state picture , which hoyle has used in the latest phase of his cosmological thinking .",
    "this is the argument of the quasi- or revised steady - state theory developed by him , burbidge and narlikar in a series of papers published in 1990s ( hoyle 1992 ; hoyle , burbidge , and narlikar 1993 , 1994 ) . here",
    "we basically have a novel strategy in the fight with entropy , and we now investigate whether it is any more successful in dealing with dt argument .",
    "although css theory is now universally considered defunct , there are some recent developments to be considered in light of the preceding analysis . open of them is the emergence of the `` quasi '' steady - state theory ( henceforth qss ) as an attempt to overcome the difficulties with observational evidence against an unchangeable universe of pcp , and in favor of a hot state in the cosmic past ( hoyle et al .",
    "the roots of this attempt can be found in hoyle s early work ( hoyle 1949 ) in which , comparing the merits of his and bondi - gold version of css , he writes :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ bondi and gold ... in discussing the continuous creation of matter , have avoided the introduction of a quantitative theory by making the hypothesis that the universe , when taken on a sufficiently large scale satisfies the wide ( perfect ) cosmological principle . since",
    "the wide cosmological principle is very far from being satisfied over regions with linear dimension less than about 10@xmath41 cm , such a hypothesis immediately raises the following questions : what considerations determine the scale necessary for the wide cosmological principle to be approximately satisfied ? _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    insofar as we can detect inhomogeneities in the universe in the form of galaxies , clusters and other large - scale structure , we can set the spatial scale for the application of the ( restricted ) cosmological principle .",
    "it is not * obvious * which intervals similarly characterize smoothing of temporal fluctuations .",
    "of course , the relevant scale can be introduced by a definitional _ fiat _ , thereby effectively introducing a new constant of nature , which is generally unsatisfactory .",
    "taking amplitudes of such fluctuations to be similar to the conventional hubble time directly led hoyle ( with fascinating consequence ) to the idea of mini - big bangs in the revised steady - state theory . without going into technical details ( presented in hoyle and burbidge 1992 ; hoyle et al .",
    "1993 , 1994 ) , it should be mentioned that , as well as in hoyle s version of css model , negative energy of the creation field transforms into matter with positive energy . however , the creation is not uniform in spacetime , but occurs in discrete creation events , so - called `` mini - bangs '' . in each individual `` mini - bang '' about @xmath42 solar masses ( a characteristic mass of superclusters of galaxies ) is created in the form of particles with planck mass ( @xmath43 g ) .",
    "each planck particle ultimately produces about @xmath44 baryons which react at high energies producing light chemical elements .",
    "the distribution of creation events creates the characteristic cellular structure seen in the large galaxy surveys of the last decade .",
    "the thermal energy of matter expanding from the creation events is the ultimate origin of the all - pervading cosmic microwave background ; its anisotropy and local departure from the thermodynamical equilibrium are lost through repeated interactions with specific form of cosmic dust : elongated metallic whiskers ( `` needles '' ) created and distributed through space by the supernovae explosions of the first generation of stars .",
    "the revised steady state theory possesses a continuity with the earlier work of hoyle and narlikar , mainly their results from 1966 .",
    "study ( hoyle and narlikar 1966 ) , where the rejection of smooth continuous creation of the previous theory has been emphasized in the very title of the paper ( _ a radical departure from the steady - state concept in cosmology _ ) .",
    "this model , in its elaboration of 1990s , includes some of the elements of recent  particularly observational astrophysical  developments , and so is more modern and closer to the prevailing trends in science . at the same time , however , its structure is complicated and possesses none of the beautiful simplicity of the classical steady - state theory .",
    "although detailed discriminatory observational tests of the new model have not been performed yet , the probability that they will give results expected by the qss proponents is small indeed .",
    "moreover , the findings connected with the chemical abundances of the primordial matter , as well as the deep galaxy fields , point to the lack of support for some of the basic tenets of this model .",
    "however , qss does not stand much better against the anthropic arguments .",
    "this theory is vulnerable to the dt argument in the same basic manner as css cosmology .",
    "the fact that we shall encounter galaxies of similar age to the milky way inside of the local supercluster represents only a gigantic spatial and temporal translation of the problem , which does not brings us closer to its solution .",
    "galaxies and technological civilizations of the appropriate age will be present in other superclusters , which could be of an arbitrary age , obeying only the self - similar `` supercluster distribution function '' necessarily akin to eq.([eq2 ] ) .",
    "this strategy of `` passing the buck '' is probably one of the chief reasons why dt argument has needed so much time to be formulated .",
    "it may eventually solve our psychological difficulty concerning past temporal infinity , but not the physical problem itself . if we do not forbid information transport between the superclusters by definitional _",
    "fiat _ , the problem remains as acute as in the classical steady - state case .",
    "recently the idea of stationarity on very large scales has been reanimated in the form of several similar inflationary scenarios .",
    "a typical example is the work of andrei linde and his collaborators ( linde 1988 , 1990 ; linde et al .",
    "1994 ) , as well as vilenkin ( 1992 , 1995 ) . in these models ( known under labels such as `` chaotic '' or `` eternal '' inflation ) , bubbles are formed out of spacetime foam at planck energy , each bubble evolving into an individual universe in its own right , with specific topologies , geometries , laws of nature , coupling constants , etc .",
    "the entire process of separation and inflation of these individual bubble - universes has no beginning or end , and therefore the entire ontological background of these processes ( for which the appropriate name of * multiverse * is coined ) is stationary .",
    "a significant similarity between classical c - field cosmology and inflationary scenarios in general has been noted recently ( hoyle 1992 ; narlikar 1984 ) . the manifestation of that swing of the pendulum backward from extreme evolutionism toward some form of stationarity can be seen in the very titles of several recent papers , such as _ from the big bang theory to the theory of stationary universe _ ( linde et al .",
    "it is still too early to estimate whether this should be regarded as the general tendency to recover some of the advantages of `` stationary '' cosmologies ( and , possibly , a counter - reaction to the overemphasis on `` evolutionary uncertainties '' frequently employed in astrophysics as an _ ad hoc _ , or rather _ ignoramus _ , recipe ) .",
    "future historians of science will have to discuss this question .    the role of `` local inhomogeneities '' which is played by galaxies in the classical steady - state model , is played by entire individual bubble - universes in the multiverse theories .",
    "as suggested by linde ( 1990 ) , different ways of breaking of the initial complete symmetry of the single `` unified '' force of nature will occur in different bubble - universes , and so a wild variety of physical conditions are likely to arise .",
    "it is natural to ask , therefore , whether the dt anthropic argument applies to those quantum cosmological models which are in a global stationary state",
    ". it should be immediately clear that the inflationary scenarios have great relevance for the entire problem of existence of life in the universe . as an illustration , in a conclusion to their highly technical paper on some aspects of inflation , novello and heintzmann ( 1984 )",

    "biological reactions will only occur ( or reoccur ) in the late expanding phase and existence of life would only occur at a finite time ; whereas in the first case , life could have existed eternally in the universe , leading to the intriguing hypothesis that there may be colonies in space which are infinitely more intelligent than we are .",

    "the simplest one is to reject the very notion of `` eternal '' inflation .",
    "this possibility ( differently motivated ) has been investigated by vilenkin ( 1995 ) and borde and vilenkin ( 1994 ) .",
    "the goal of these studies is to show that , under a general range of physical conditions , the initial singular beginning is compulsory , from which it immediately stems that the entire multiverse is of finite age .",
    "the outcome is not unambiguous .",
    "another possible approach is the one discussed by barrow and tipler in chapter ix of their monograph : to forbid information transport between individual bubble - universe by physical reasons .",
    "the `` environment '' surrounding the bubble - universes is false vacuum at energies close to the planck energy , which makes any communication hard to imagine , to say the least ( but see garriga et al .",
    "this conclusion may be challenged on the grounds that ( i ) what is hard to imagine today , does not need to be so for the advanced civilizations which have already technologized a large part or their entire domicile bubble - universe and thus marshaled unbelievable material and intellectual resources , and ( ii ) it may well be possible to communicate between two bubble - universes in a non - classical way , that is using ( or creating ! ) the complex topological structure of the multiverse .",
    "the latter method would rely on some version of the well - known concept of `` wormholes '' ( e.g.  morris , thorne and yurtsever 1988 ; visser 1990 ) .",
    "finally , the third possible strategy lies in possibility that individual bubble - universes ( with finite resources , and therefore the finite duration of an active technologized state ) may be separated from the planck spacetime foam at a rate sufficiently high enough to achieve a state equilibrium with the formation and evolution of generic intelligent communities .",
    "such an equilibrium will reflect the state in which most of `` young '' universes are uninhabited either by their native supercivilizations or by an external ( `` colonizing '' ) supercivilization of an arbitrary age .",
    "however , it goes without saying that this is extremely speculative , and therefore is mentioned here just for the sake of completness .",
    "otherwise , one can not escape an agreement with the judgement of barrow and tipler that    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ this ... objection is much weaker in the inflation steady - state universe situation than it is in the standard steady - state universe model , for it is far from clear that it is possible to develop technology which will allow intelligent life to exist ... in the steady state region .",

    "these properties refer to both dynamics , topology and application of the dt argument . taken together",
    ", they illustrate the range ( certainly not exhaustive ) of classical cosmological thought and the close connection of the entire anthropic reasoning to other physically defined properties of particular models .",
    "all models presented in table 1 possess a past temporal infinity in at least one sense ( i.e.  according to one of the major theories of the ontological status of time discussed above ) .",
    "some of them are static at large scales , and most are not ; the ambiguous sign for the case of classical de sitter universe stands for the curious historical ambiguity on the meaning of `` static . ''",
    "some models are topologically closed , while others are flat or open , and some possess such specific features as ( global ) singularities and horizons .     *",

    "the outcome strongly depends on the detailed physical properties of the initial equilibrium state . in most versions of this model ,",
    "the anthropic argument is clearly inapplicable , although the strong version of the argument may be operational in some specific versions .",
    "the dependence on the physical detail also plays a crucial role in considerations of non - singular cyclical models ( singular models can not be justifiably called oscillatory at all ) . here",
    "the real issue is information transport between the successive phases of contraction and expansion .",
    "if the physical conditions are too extreme at the point of the smallest radius , the information on the previous cycle will be erased , and the subsequent phase will essentially be a completely new universe , `` from scratch '' . these conditions , in turn , depend on the exact values of cosmological parameters in the model , as well as in unknown physics on which the concept of a bounce critically depends .",
    "in addition , the duration of expanding and contracting phase must be long enough for the advanced technological communities to arise ( wap constraint ) , or  in the stronger version  for the process of spontaneous creation of probes ( and probes causally connected with the region beyond the bounce at that ! ) to occur .",
    "since various combinations of parameters are possible in this class of models , it is not possible to give a generic answer on the applicability question .    a criticism usually encountered from people for the first time facing such an anthropic argument concerns the relationship of laws and instances in cosmology .",
    "how can such an argument based on a single instance of intelligent and technological life be used as a general argument against a wide spectrum of specific physical cosmologies , such as the classical steady - state theory certainly is .",
    "there are two possible answers to this basic _ non sequitur_. first of all , there is no generic form of cosmological model ; as shown clearly by balashov ( 1994 ) in the detailed analysis of css theory , the entire theory * can * be both legitimately and practically derived from an essentially methodological principle as is pcp . _",
    "mutatis mutandis _ , the rejection of such a theory can be both legitimately and practically done on the account of argument pointing out the self - contradictory nature of particular instances of pcp application .",
    "let us reiterate : there is no inherent need for life to exist in the universe satisfying the perfect cosmological principle . in a sense",
    ", it would be much easier to formulate pcp for the counterfactual case of lifeless universe , since amplitudes of  local inhomogeneities  could as well be either much smaller or much larger from the narrow range required for satisfying the wap constraints .",
    "for instance , the counterfactual universe with amplitude of fluctuations several orders of magnitude smaller than those detected in the real universe through cosmic microwave background observations could evolve as mildly inhomogeneous plasma according to pcp without ever forming galaxies and stars .",
    "new matter will simply keep the density of such plasma constant . very high",
    "( again counterfactual ) value of the hubble constant will probably have the same effect .",
    "however , once we make an observation of existence of life ( and intelligence ) , pcp requires that we have the same in all ages and in infinitely many places .    the second aspect of the dilemma is contained in the ambiguous status of the biological and psychological evolution in our picture of the universe .",
    "it seems clear that we are dealing with a double standard here .",
    "when fred hoyle predicted the existence of 7.65 mev metastable level in the nucleus of @xmath38c on the basis of existence of carbon and carbon - based life ( hoyle et al .",
    "1953 ; hoyle 1994 ) , it was quite clear that this level does not exist separately from the entire scope of physical sciences . on the contrary , it was clear from the beginning that the energy and all relevant properties of this level can * in principle * be reduced to the particular numerical values of the constants of nature , like the planck constant and elementary charge .",
    "therefore , fine tuning of the @xmath38c level is actually only a * manifestation * of the fine tuning of various constants of nature .",
    "conceptually , this manifestation is redundant .",
    "however , we can not , as discussed in barrow and tipler ( 1986 ) , back track and reconstruct the manner in which the particular values of constants propagate toward creating the observed energy of this level .",
    "this is just a technical matter , because the carbon nucleus is an extremely complicated quantum system , and there is simply not enough sophistication and calculating power in the present - day nuclear physics to perform such back tracking .",
    "still , it is important to note that nobody denies * principal * possibility of such reconstruction , which can be achieved in a matter of decades if the development of numerical science and computers continues at the present pace .",
    "the same idea applies , _ mutatis mutandis _ , to other examples of",
    "so frequently discussed `` anthropic coincidences '' .",
    "however , a significant resistance is encountered when the same reasoning applies to systems which are more complex than nuclei ",
    "say living and intelligent beings .",
    "still , there is no evidence whatsoever that living systems are in any way different from usual physical systems except in the level of complexity ( davies 1999 )",
    ". views sometimes expressed to the contrary can be regarded only as remnants of the obsolete vitalistic doctrines .",
    "indications that the mental processes occurring in intelligent beings can be * in principle * ultimately reduced in a manner essentially the same as is conjecture for the carbon nucleus have been gathered by tipler ( 1994 ) and stapp ( 1985 ) .",
    "similar thoughts have been expressed earlier in xx century by erwin schrdinger in his influential _",
    "what is life ?",
    "_ essays ( schrdinger 1944 ) .",
    "it is clear that the weak version of dt argument may be criticized on historico - sociological arguments .",
    "let us assume that there is an absolute maximum for the development of any community of intelligent beings , and that the contact cross section of this maximum is small . in that case ,",
    "if the rate of emergence of intelligent communities is sufficiently low in comparison to the hubble expansion rate , in the finite relaxation time it is possible to achieve the equilibrium in which arbitrarily large fraction of the comoving 3-volume is non - technologized .",
    "this could be called the spenglerian model of intelligent communities ( e.g. fischer 1989 ) . for an exception to the prevailing paradigm of discontinuity between the contemporary worldview in the natural sciences and history understood in spenglerian terms , one may look at the excellent recent study of victor clube devoted to cometary neocatastrophism in planetary studies ( clube 1995 ) .",
    "this work , under the instructive title _ the nature of punctual crises and the spenglerian model of civilization _ presents  in a different , still quite relevant scientific framework  how much the self - contentedness and dogmatical blindness in science in the last century or two could lead toward a _ de facto _ wrong factual road .",
    "it was first the medieval immutable heavens , and subsequently uniformitarian ( anticlerical , ironically enough ) dogma on exclusiveness of slow evolutionary change , which impeded  and to a degree still impedes  acceptance of the truth about the significance of catastrophic events originating in our cosmic environment .",
    "the specific problem with the spenglerian model lies exactly in the mentioned need for * non - exclusivity * : as the teleological counter - argument becomes valid only if the probability of spontaneous creation of life ( and/or von neumann probes ) is for some reason exactly equal to zero , and not only very small , so here the number of civilizations which are capable of escaping the spenglerian `` curse '' must be exactly zero in order for the explanation to work in an infinitely old universe .",
    "this is even harder to imagine than the previous case , because if the proponents of impossibility of spontaneous creation of life can enlist quantum mechanics on their side , the proponents of the spenglerian model have to show that sociology and history are in a sense more universal than quantum mechanics itself !",
    "( of course , the spenglerian model remains a strong palliative to naive concepts of universe blossoming with life in case of temporally and spatially limited systems ; therefore , it remains very relevant for the fermi s paradox and the seti problem in the milky way .",
    ") of course , the stronger tipler s version of the anthropic argument , related to spontaneously assembled von neumann probes is entirely immune to this type of criticism .",
    "the core lesson of the entire case for the anthropic argument against cosmologies containing past temporal infinities is , however , located on a deep epistemological level . as a side effect of both the copernican revolution and the cartesian dualism , the implicit rejection of the pre - socratic picture of the inseparability of the cosmological",
    ", biological and anthropological domains led to an inevitable delay in noticing a powerful and specific cosmological argument .",
    "further discussions on this topic , as well as further discussions of the future of * physical universe * , will have to * explicitly * take into account the existence and activities of intelligent observers .",
    "this will manifest itself not only in retrodictions about the cosmological past , as the original anthropic argument of dicke and carter has been traditionally used , but also through the predictive aspect of cosmology .",
    "these considerations will necessarily be of a multidisciplinary character , so desirable in this latest epoch of development of our picture of the universe .",
