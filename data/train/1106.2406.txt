    "observational data of type ia supernovae ( sneia ) collected by riess et al .",
    "@xcite in the high - redshift supernova search team and by perlmutter et al .",
    "@xcite in the supernova cosmology project team independently reported that the present observable universe is undergoing an accelerated expansion phase . the exotic source for this cosmic acceleration",
    "is generally dubbed `` dark energy '' ( de ) which is distinguished from ordinary matter ( such as baryons and radiation ) , in the sense that it has negative pressure .",
    "this negative pressure leads to the accelerated expansion of the universe by counteracting the gravitational force .",
    "the astrophysical observations show that about 70% of the present energy of the universe is contained in de .",
    "although the nature and cosmological origin of de is still enigmatic at the present , a great variety of models has been proposed to describe the de ( see e.g. , the reviews @xcite ) .",
    "two promising candidates are the holographic de ( hde ) @xcite and the agegraphic de ( ade ) @xcite models which are originated from some considerations of the features of the quantum theory of gravity .",
    "it is curious to note that the hde model has its origin ( i.e. definition and derivation ) depends on the bekenstein - hawking ( bh ) entropy - area relationship @xmath1 of black hole thermodynamics , where @xmath2 is the area of the horizon @xcite .",
    "however , this definition of hde can be modified ( or corrected ) due to the various correction procedures applied to gravity theories @xcite .",
    "for instance , the corrections to the entropy which appear in dealing with the entanglement of quantum fields in and out the horizon @xcite generate a power - corrected area term in the entropy expression .",
    "the power - law corrected entropy has the form @xcite @xmath3,\\label{ec}\\ ] ] where @xmath4 is a dimensionless constant whose value is currently under debate and determining its unique and precise value requires separate investigation , and @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the crossover scale . the second term in eq .",
    "( [ ec ] ) can be regarded as a power - law correction to the entropy - area law , resulting from entanglement i.e. the wave function of the field is taken to be a superposition / entanglement of ground and exited states @xcite .",
    "the entanglement entropy of the ground state satisfies the bh entropy - area relationship .",
    "only the excited state contributes to the correction , and more excitations produce more deviation from the bh entropy - area law @xcite ( also see @xcite for a review on the origin of black hole entropy through entanglement ) .",
    "this lends further credence to entanglement as a possible source of black hole entropy .",
    "the correction term is also more significant for higher excitations @xcite .",
    "it is important to note that the correction term falls off rapidly with increasing @xmath2 .",
    "so for large black holes the correction term falls off rapidly and the bh entropy - area law is recovered , whereas for the small black holes the correction is significant .",
    "the ade model is originated from the uncertainty relation of quantum mechanics together with the gravitational effect in general relativity ( gr ) .",
    "the ade model assumes that the observed de comes from the spacetime and matter field fluctuations in the universe @xcite . following the line of quantum fluctuations of spacetime , karolyhazy @xcite proposed that the distance in minkowski spacetime can not be known to a better accuracy than @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is a dimensionless constant of order unity and @xmath9 is the reduced planck time .",
    "based on karolyhazy relation , maziashvili proposed that the energy density of metric fluctuations of minkowski spacetime is given by @xcite @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the reduced planck mass @xmath12 . since in the original ade model the age of the universe is chosen as the length measure , instead of the horizon distance , the causality problem in the hde is avoided @xcite .",
    "the original ade model had some difficulties .",
    "in particular , it can not justify the matter - dominated era @xcite .",
    "this motivated wei and cai @xcite to propose the new ade ( nade ) model , while the time scale is chosen to be the conformal time instead of the age of the universe .",
    "the nade density is given by @xcite @xmath13 where 3@xmath14 is the numerical factor and @xmath15 is the conformal time and defined as @xmath16 the ade models have been examined and constrained by various astronomical observations @xcite . inspired by the power - law corrected entropy relation ( [ ec ] ) , and following the derivation of hde @xcite and entropy - corrected hde ( echde ) @xcite , we can easily obtain the so - called `` power - law entropy - corrected '' nade ( plecnade ) whose the scale is chosen to be the conformal time @xmath15 .",
    "therefore , we write down the energy density of plecnade as @xcite @xmath17 where @xmath18 is a dimensional constant whose the precise value needs to be determined . in this paper ,",
    "our aim is to investigate the plecnade model in hoava - lifshitz cosmology .",
    "the plane of the paper as follows : in section 2 , we give a brief review of hoava - lifshitz cosmology in detailed balance case . in section 3 , we construct a model of interaction between de and dm . in section 4 ,",
    "we discuss some cosmological implications of this model .",
    "we obtain the evolution of dimensionless energy density , deceleration parameter and equation of state parameter of plecnade model . in section 5",
    "we give the conclusion .",
    "recently a power - counting renormalizable uv complete theory of gravity was proposed by hoava @xcite .",
    "quantum gravity models based on an anisotropic scaling of the space and time dimensions have recently attracted significant attention @xcite . in particular , hoava - lifshitz point gravity might be has desirable features , but in its original incarnation one is forced to accept a non - zero cosmological constant of the wrong sign to be compatible with observations @xcite . at a first look it seems that this non - relativistic model for quantum gravity has a well defined ir limit and it reduces to gr .",
    "but as it was first indicated by mukohyama @xcite , hoava - lifshitz theory mimics gr plus dark matter ( dm ) .",
    "this theory has a scale invariant power spectrum which describes inflation @xcite .",
    "moreover , some new integrable and nonintegrable cosmological models of the hoava - lifshitz gravity have been discussed in @xcite .",
    "phenomenologically , in hoava - lifshitz gravity the radiation energy density decreases proportional to @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "hence the resultant baryon asymmetry as well as the stochastic gravity waves can be enhanced . some cosmological solutions to in hoava - lifshitz gravity",
    "are obtained previously @xcite .",
    "saridakis formulated horava - lifshitz cosmology with an additional scalar field and showed that horava - lifshitz dark energy naturally presents very interesting behaviors , possessing a varying equation - of - state parameter , exhibiting phantom behavior and allowing for a realization of the phantom divide crossing .",
    "in addition , horava - lifshitz dark energy guarantees for a bounce at small scale factors and it may trigger the turnaround at large scale factors , leading naturally to cyclic cosmology @xcite . the large scale evolution and curvature perturbations in hl gravity are explored in @xcite , while the origin of primordial large - scale magnetic fields in the horava s non - relativistic gravity have been discussed in @xcite .",
    "the generalized second law of thermodynamics in horava - lifshitz cosmology is studied in @xcite . for reviews on the scenario where the cosmological evolution is governed by hoava - lifshitz gravity",
    "see @xcite .    under the detailed balance and the projectability conditions , the modified friedmann equations in the framework of hoava - lifshitz ( hl ) gravity",

    "also @xmath27 denotes the curvature of space @xmath28 for a flat , closed an open universe , respectively .",
    "furthermore , @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the energy density and pressure of the matter .    noticing the form of the above friedmann equations",
    ", we can define the energy density @xmath31 and pressure @xmath32 for de as @xmath33 @xmath34 the first term on the right hand side proportional to @xmath35 is effectively the `` dark radiation term '' , present in hl cosmology @xcite , while the second term is referred as an explicit cosmological constant .    finally in order for these expressions to match with the standard friedmann equations we set @xcite @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the `` cosmological '' newton s constant .",
    "note that in gravitational theories with the violation of lorentz invariance ( like hl gravity ) the `` gravitational '' newton s constant @xmath38 , which is present in the gravitational action , differs from the `` cosmological '' newton s constant @xmath39 , which is present in the friedmann equations , unless lorentz invariance is restored @xcite . for the sake of completeness",
    "we write @xmath40 note that in the ir limit ( @xmath41 ) , where lorentz invariance is restored , @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the same .",

    "since the modes of gravitational fluctuations in a black hole background behave as scalar fields , one is able to compute the entanglement entropy of such a field , by tracing over its degrees of freedom inside a sphere . in this way the authors of @xcite showed that the black hole entropy is proportional to the area of the sphere when the field is in its ground state , but",
    "a correction term proportional to a fractional power of area results when the field is in a superposition of ground and excited states . for large horizon areas , these corrections are relatively small and the bh entropy - area law is recovered .    here , we investigated the plecnade scenario in the framework of hl gravity .",
    "we considered an arbitrary spatial local curvature for the background geometry and allowed for an interaction between the plecnade and dm .",
    "we obtained the deceleration parameter as well as the differential equation which determines the evolution of the plecnade density parameter . using a low redshift expansion of the eos parameter of plecnade as @xmath103 , we calculated @xmath90 and @xmath91 as functions of the plecnade and curvature density parameters , @xmath93 and @xmath94 respectively , of the running parameter @xmath23 of hl gravity , of the parameter @xmath95 of plecnade , of the interaction coupling @xmath58 , and of the coefficients of correction terms @xmath4 and @xmath18 .",
    "it is quite interesting to note that phantom crossing for @xmath90 happens for @xmath98 i.e. a small but non - zero interaction parameter . in literature , there are two well - studied ways for phantom crossing : via modified gravities including scalar - tensor or gauss - bonnet braneworld models @xcite or by introducing an interaction between fluid dark energy and dark matter . in the later models , its a generic feature of interacting dark energy models to have phantom crossing , for instance , using different forms of dark energy including chaplygin gas @xcite , quintessence @xcite , new - agegraphic and holographic dark energy @xcite . in @xcite",
