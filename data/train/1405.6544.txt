    "compressed sensing ( cs ) studies sparse signal recovery from far fewer measurements and has brought significant impact on signal processing and information theory in the past decade . since its development thus far has been focused on signals that can be sparsely represented under a finite discrete dictionary , limitations are present in applications such as array processing , radar and sonar , where the dictionary is typically specified by one or more continuous parameters . in this paper , we consider the problem of recovering a sinusoidal / frequency - sparse signal , which is a superposition of a few complex sinusoids , from a subset of regularly spaced samples . the problem is referred to as continuous cs as suggested in @xcite in the sense that the frequencies of the sinusoids can take any continuous values . a systematic",
    ", convex approach is introduced in @xcite which works directly in the continuous domain and completely eliminates parameter discretization / gridding of conventional cs methods that causes basis mismatches . in the paper , it is shown that a frequency - sparse signal can be exactly recovered in the noiseless case from far fewer samples provided that the frequencies are appropriately separate .",
    "practical solutions are then provided in @xcite in the noisy case .",
    "an important , related application is direction of arrival ( doa ) estimation @xcite , in which improved performance is typically obtained by receiving multiple frequency - sparse signals in a time interval which share the same frequency components .",
    "note that the method in @xcite specified for a single measurement vector ( smv ) can not process the multiple measurement vectors ( mmvs ) at a single step while the joint processing exploiting the so - called joint sparsity can usually improve the performance @xcite . before this paper ,",
    "the only known continuous / gridless sparse method for mmvs was presented in @xcite in the context of doa estimation based on statistical inference .    in this paper , we study the smv and mmv continuous cs problems in a unified framework . based on an @xmath1-norm - like formulation we establish a link between continuous cs and a well - studied area of low rank matrix completion ( lrmc ) @xcite and provide a sufficient condition for exact recovery .",
    "we propose convex optimization methods for signal recovery based on the link and convex and nonconvex relaxations and present computationally efficient algorithms using alternating direction method of multipliers ( admm ) @xcite .",
    "numerical simulations are provided to study their phase transition phenomena and validate their usefulness in doa estimation .",
    "suppose that we observe a number of @xmath2 sinusoidal signals denoted by matrix @xmath3 , on the index set @xmath4 , where @xmath5 with @xmath6 denoting the sample size of each sinusoidal signal . here",
    "@xmath7 indexes the @xmath8th entry of the @xmath9th measurement vector ( or snapshot data ) , @xmath10 , @xmath11 denotes the @xmath12th normalized frequency , and @xmath13 is the ( complex ) amplitude of the @xmath12th component at snapshot @xmath9 . the smv case where @xmath14 corresponds to line spectral estimation in spectral analysis and the mmv case is common in array processing . in this paper , each column of @xmath15 is called a frequency - sparse signal since the number of sinusoids @xmath16 is typically small .",
    "we are interested in the recovery of @xmath15 ( as well as the parameters @xmath17 and @xmath18 if possible ) under the sparse prior given its partial or compressive measurements on @xmath4 , denoted by @xmath19 .",
    "this problem is called the continuous cs problem to distinguish with the common discrete frequency setting as suggested in @xcite .",
    "we mainly consider the noiseless case .",
    "the general noisy case will be deferred to subsection [ sec : noisycase ] .",
    "we exploit sparsity to solve the ill - posed problem of recovering @xmath15 from @xmath19 . following the literature of cs ,",
    "we seek for the maximally sparse candidate for its recovery .",
    "to state it formally , we denote @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "then ( [ formu : observmodel1 ] ) can be written as where @xmath22 and @xmath23 with @xmath24 .",
    "let @xmath25 denote the unit @xmath26-sphere .",
    "we define the continuous dictionary or the set of atoms it is clear that @xmath15 is a linear combination of a number of atoms in @xmath27 .",
    "we define the atomic @xmath1 ( pseudo-)norm of some @xmath28 as the smallest number of atoms that can express it : so we propose the following problem for signal recovery : where @xmath29 takes the rows of @xmath30 indexed by @xmath31 .      to analyze the atomic @xmath1 norm minimization problem in ( [ formu : al0min ] )",
    ", we generalize the concept of spark to the case of continuous dictionary .",
    "we define the following continuous dictionary with respect to the index set @xmath31 : @xmath32 .    given the continuous dictionary @xmath33 , the quantity spark of @xmath33 , denoted by @xmath34 , is the smallest number of atoms of @xmath33 which are linearly dependent .",
    "we have the following results about @xmath34 :    1 .",
    "@xmath35 , 2 .",
    "@xmath36 if and only if the elements of is not coprime , and 3 .",
    "@xmath37 if @xmath31 consists of @xmath38 consecutive integers .",
    "[ thm : fullspark ]    theorem [ thm : fullspark ] presents the range of @xmath34 with respect to the sampling index set @xmath31 .",
    "readers are referred to @xcite for its proof and those of the rest results due to the page limit .",
    "a sufficient and necessary condition is provided under which @xmath34 achieves the lower bound 2 .",
    "note , however , that such @xmath31 is rare .",
    "for example , when @xmath31 is selected uniformly at random , the probability that the condition holds is 0 whenever @xmath39 .",
    "it is less than @xmath40 when @xmath41 and @xmath42 respectively .",
    "a sufficient ( but unnecessary ) condition is also provided under which @xmath33 achieves the upper bound @xmath43 .",
    "we provide theoretical guarantees of the atomic @xmath1 norm minimization in ( [ formu : al0min ] ) for frequency recovery in this subsection .",
    "in particular , we have the following result , which can be considered as a continuous version of ( * ? ? ? * theorem 2.4 ) .",
    "@xmath44 is the unique optimizer to ( [ formu : al0min ] ) if moreover , the atomic decomposition above is the unique one satisfying that @xmath45 .",
    "[ thm : al0_guanrantee ]    theorem [ thm : al0_guanrantee ] shows that the proposed atomic @xmath1 minimization problem can recover a frequency - sparse signal with sparsity @xmath46 in the smv case .",
    "as we take more measurement vectors , we have a chance to recover more complex signals by increasing @xmath47 , which is practically relevant in array processing applications .",
    "in fact , the sparsity @xmath16 can be as large as @xmath48 with an approximate choice of @xmath31 .",
    "the optimization problem in ( [ formu : al0min ] ) is computationally infeasible given the infinite dimensional formulation of the atomic @xmath1 norm in ( [ formu : al0 ] ) .",
    "we provide a finite dimensional formulation in the following result .",
    "@xmath49 defined in ( [ formu : al0 ] ) equals the optimal value of the following rank minimization problem : where @xmath50 denotes a ( hermitian ) toeplitz matrix with its first row specified by @xmath51 , and @xmath52 means that @xmath53 is positive semidefinite . [ thm : al0_rankmin ]    theorem [ thm : al0_rankmin ] presents a rank minimization problem to characterize the atomic @xmath1 norm .",
    "it follows that ( [ formu : al0min ] ) is equivalent to the following lrmc problem : where we need to recover a ( structured positive semidefinite ) low rank matrix @xmath53 with partial access to its entries . as a result",
    ", we establish a link between continuous cs and the well studied area of lrmc , which enables us to study the continuous cs problem by borrowing ideas in lrmc .",
    "note that a similar rank minimization problem is presented in @xcite in the smv case , where the rank is put on the matrix @xmath50 rather than the full matrix @xmath53 in ( [ formu : rankmin_ccs ] ) .",
    "this difference obscures the link between continuous cs and lrmc which , we will see later , plays an important role in this paper .",
    "the atomic @xmath1 norm exploits sparsity directly , however , it is nonconvex and the problem in ( [ formu : rankmin_ccs ] ) can not be solved globally in practice . to avoid the nonconvexity and at the same time exploit sparsity",
    ", we utilize convex relaxation to relax the atomic @xmath1 norm .",
    "in particular , it can be relaxed in two ways from two different perspectives .",
    "one is to relax the atomic @xmath1 norm to the atomic @xmath54 norm ( or simply the atomic norm ) which is defined as the gauge function of @xmath55 , the convex hull of @xmath27 @xcite : the atomic norm @xmath56 is indeed a norm and convex by the property of the gauge function . the other way of convex relaxation is based on a perspective of rank minimization illustrated in ( [ formu : al0_rankmin ] ) and to relax the pseudo rank norm to the nuclear norm or equivalently the trace norm for a positive semidefinite matrix , i.e. , to replace @xmath57 by @xmath58 in ( [ formu : al0_rankmin ] )",
    ". interestingly enough , the two convex relaxations are equivalent , which is shown in the following result .",
    "@xmath59 defined in ( [ formu : atomicnorm ] ) equals the optimal value of the following semidefinite programming ( sdp ) : [ thm : an_sdp ]    theorem [ thm : an_sdp ] generalizes the results in @xcite on the smv case .",
    "consequently , we propose the following atomic norm minimization problem for signal recovery : it is shown in @xcite that @xmath15 can be exactly recovered in the smv case with high probability if @xmath60 and the frequencies are separate by at least @xmath61 .",
    "note that the condition of frequency separation is introduced by the convex relaxation while it is not required in the atomic @xmath1 minimization problem as shown in theorem [ thm : al0_guanrantee ] .",
    "after submission of this paper , we have proven in @xcite that @xmath15 can be recovered by ( [ formu : tracemin_ccs ] ) in the mmv case under similar conditions .      from the perspective of rank minimization",
    ", an iterative reweighted trace norm minimization scheme can be implemented to further improve the low - rankness by iteratively minimizing the objective function @xmath62 subject to the same constraints , where @xmath63 denotes the solution at the @xmath8th iteration starting with @xmath64 , and @xmath65 is a small number .",
    "obviously , the first iteration refers exactly to the convex relaxation .",
    "this iterative reweighted optimization scheme corresponds to relaxing @xmath57 to the nonconvex objective @xmath66 , followed by a majorization - maximization ( mm ) implementation of the nonconvex optimization which guarantees local convergence of the objective function .",
    "we expect that a weaker condition of frequency separation holds for this nonconvex relaxation compared to the convex one since intuitively @xmath67 is a closer approximation of the rank function . in the future",
    ", we can also consider other relaxation methods based on the literature of lrmc .",
    "given the solution of @xmath30 , it is of great importance to retrieve the frequency and amplitude solutions , or equivalently to obtain the atomic decomposition as in ( [ formu : atomdecomp ] ) , in applications such as line spectral estimation or doa estimation . in particular , we can firstly obtain the frequency solution by the vandermonde decomposition of @xmath50 given the solution of @xmath68 ( see details in @xcite ) .",
    "then the amplitude can be easily obtained by solving the linear system of equations in ( [ formu : atomdecomp ] ) .",
    "noise is always present in practical scenarios . in this paper",
    "we consider only noise with bounded energy .",
    "suppose the noise in the measurements @xmath69 is upper bounded by @xmath70 in the frobenius norm .",
    "then we can impose the inequality constraint @xmath71 instead of the equality constraint @xmath72 in the noiseless case .",
    "note that the latter is a special case with @xmath73 .",
    "we present a first - order algorithm based on admm to solve the trace minimization problems @xmath74 in subsections [ sec : convexrelax ] and [ sec : nonconvexrelax ] , in particular , where @xmath75 is partitioned as @xmath53 .",
    "( [ formu : trmin_admm ] ) can be solved within the framework of admm in @xcite , where @xmath76 , @xmath53 and the lagrangian multiplier are iteratively updated with closed - form expressions and converge to the optimal solution ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "an eigen - decomposition of a hermitian matrix of order @xmath77 is required at each iteration .",
    "we omit the detailed update rules due to the page limit .",
    "note that the admm converges slowly to an extremely accurate solution while moderate accuracy is typically sufficient in practical applications @xcite .",
    "we first consider the noiseless case and study the so - called phase transition phenomenon in the @xmath78 plane . in particular , we repeat an experiment in @xcite and consider our proposed atomic norm ( or trace norm ) minimization ( anm ) and reweighted trace minimization ( rwtm ) methods .",
    "rwtm is terminated within maximally 3 iterations in our simulation . for achieving high accuracy",
    "we solve the sdps ( in fact , their dual problems , see @xcite ) using a standard sdp solver , sdpt3 @xcite .",
    "we fix @xmath79 and vary @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "we consider @xmath14 and @xmath82 , where anm in the smv case has been studied in @xcite .",
    "the frequencies @xmath83 are generated randomly with minimal separation @xmath84 which is empirically found in @xcite to be the minimal separation required for exact recovery when @xmath14 .",
    "the amplitudes @xmath85 are randomly generated as @xmath86 with random phases , where @xmath87 is standard normal distributed .",
    "the first column of @xmath15 is used in the smv case in each problem generated .",
    "the recovery is considered successful if @xmath88 , where @xmath89 denotes the recovered signal .",
    "simulation results are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : phasetransition ] , where a transition from perfect recovery to complete failure can be observed in each subfigure . by increasing the number of measurement vectors from 1 to 5 ,",
    "the phase of successful recovery is enlarged significantly for both anm and rwtm .",
    "moreover , rwtm has an enlarged success phase than anm , especially in the mmv case , due to adoption of nonconvex relaxation .",
    "we also notice that the transition boundary of anm with @xmath14 is not very sharp and failures happen in the area where complete success is expected .",
    "further examination reveals that most of the failures happen when the minimal separation marginally exceeds @xmath90 .",
    "the situation is better for rwtm with @xmath14 .",
    "in contrast , sharp phase transitions exhibit for both anm and rwtm in the mmv case .",
    "this implies that the requirement of frequency separation can be relaxed in our considered mmv case where the measurement vectors are statistically independent .",
    "we also plot the line @xmath91 in each subfigure which acts as an upper bound of the sufficient condition in theorem [ thm : al0_guanrantee ] for exact recovery using the atomic @xmath1 norm minimization .",
    "we see that in the mmv case successful recoveries can be obtained even above the line with anm or rwtm , implying that the sufficient condition is unnecessary .    .",
