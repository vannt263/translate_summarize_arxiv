    "in recent decades , modern cosmology has got into a phase of highly precise physics .",
    "especially progress of observations of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) is quite remarkable , and recent results of planck collaboration are beautifully consistent with the standard @xmath5cdm scenario  @xcite . on the other hand , success of the big - bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) has supported the standard big - bang model of cosmology for more than 50 years and bbn also has been used as an important probe to physical states of the early universe .",
    "together with measurements of abundances of light elements ( e.g. d and @xmath2he ) bbn can give stringent constraints on various cosmological scenarios .",
    "the latest observed value of the primordial @xmath6he and d abundances , @xmath7  @xcite and @xmath8  @xcite , are in good agreement with the standard bbn prediction with the best fit parameters of planck , @xmath9 and @xmath10  @xcite .    as an initial condition of big - bang cosmology , inflation ,",
    "i.e. the accelerated expansion of the early universe , is one of the most plausible scenario .",
    "inflation can not only solve several problems of big - bang theory such as horizon , flatness , and monopole problems , but also create primordial inhomogeneities from quantum fluctuations as seeds of cosmic structures .",
    "that is , the information of the dynamics of the early universe will be imprinted on cosmological inhomogeneities like the large scale structure ( lss ) and the temperature and polarization anisotropies of cmb .    from observations of cmb and lss ,",
    "the primordial curvature perturbations are found to be almost scale invariant and the amplitude of their power spectrum @xmath11 is as small as @xmath12 at least on large scales such that @xmath13  @xcite .",
    "however , they are still not understood well on smaller scales @xmath14 because of the silk damping @xcite . theoretically , there are many inflationary models which predict the large enhancement of the small scale perturbations , e.g. _ simple hybrid inflation _  @xcite ( see also @xcite for concrete power spectra ) , _ hybrid - new double inflation _  @xcite , _ single - field double inflation _  @xcite , _ running mass model _",

    "therefore it is important to investigate the small scale perturbations to understand the early universe .    in this context",
    ", several methods to probe the small scale perturbations are studied .",
    "primordial black holes ( pbhs )  @xcite , which are suggested to be produced by the gravitational collapse of overdense hubble patches in the radiation dominated era , are one of the representative probes .",
    "pbhs have been not detected yet and the non - detection of pbhs can constrain the primordial curvature perturbations for a very wide range of the wavelength as @xmath15 but weakly @xmath16  @xcite . as another collapsed object , ultracompact minihalos ( ucmhs )",
    "@xcite also receive notable attention .",
    "non - detection of gamma rays from dark matter ( dm ) annihilations in ucmhs puts much stronger constraints @xmath17 on scales of @xmath18 .",
    "however , this constraint only applies to wimp - dm ( weakly interacting massive particles ) which is relatively massive @xmath19 and has a weak charge so that the cross section is around @xmath20  @xcite .",
    "the constraints from cmb spectral distortions are around @xmath21 on relatively large scales as @xmath22  @xcite and they will be much improved by future cmb observations like pixie  @xcite or prism  @xcite .    recently , the idea of _ acoustic reheating _ has been proposed as a new method to probe the perturbations on @xmath23 , which is slightly smaller than the cmb distortion scale , by jeong et al .",
    "@xcite and nakama et al .",
    "this scale corresponds with the horizon scales around the bbn phase and the constraints come from the possibility that large density perturbations can affect the abundances of light elements .",

    ".    in this paper",
    ", we revisit these constraints , focusing especially on the modification of the freeze - out value of the neutron - proton ratio , which determines the primordial @xmath6he abundance dominantly . taking account of the fact that perturbations of electrons and neutrinos which enter the horizon after the neutrino decoupling evolve still together with baryon - photon fluid during that era",
    ", it is found that the perturbations decrease the @xmath6he abundance oppositely to jeong et al .",
    "@xcite and the resultant constraint on the primordial curvature perturbations is @xmath30 .",
    "these modifications are caused by second order effects of perturbations .",
    "we evaluate them in the iterative approximation in this paper , that is , we use the linear order solutions for the perturbations and approximate the second order quantities by cross terms of linear perturbations without solving exact second order equations of motion ( e.o.m ) .    this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ small scale perturbations ] , we clarify the setup and review the dynamics of the cosmological perturbations around the horizon scale .",
    "we show that indeed the decaying modes can not be neglected yet and the relation between the temperature perturbations and the primordial curvature perturbations is modified by several factors .",
    "then we calculate the n - p ratio with perturbations and find the constraint on the primordial curvature perturbations in section  [ n - p ratio ] .",
    "we devoted section  [ conclusions ] to the conclusions .",
    "in this section we discuss the evolution of the small scale perturbations in bbn epoch . in particular , we focus on the epoch when the n - p ratio freezes out ( @xmath31 ) .      as we will describe in detail in the next section , the freeze - out value of the n - p ratio is mainly determined by the distributions of electrons and neutrinos . during this epoch",
    ", electrons remain tightly coupled with the baryon - photon plasma and their perturbations have not been dissipated by the silk damping . on the other hand",
    ", the situation of neutrinos is different . at high temperature ( @xmath32 ) , neutrinos are tightly coupled with baryon - photon plasma as well as electrons .",
    "however , when the radiation temperature drops to around @xmath33 , neutrinos decouple from the baryon - photon plasma  @xcite and their free - streaming length reaches the horizon scale . moreover , since neutrinos start to free - stream gradually before the decoupling , they diffuse almost all of the subhorizon perturbations of the baryon - photon plasma , too  @xcite . namely just before the decoupling all density perturbations smaller than @xmath34 which is the horizon scale at the decoupling are erased and rethermalized .",
    "meanwhile superhorizon perutrbations have not been erased yet .",
    "let us consider the perturbations which reenter the horizon slightly after the neutrino decoupling and before the freeze - out of the n - p ratio , that is , whose scales are given by @xmath4 .",
    "after they reenter the horizon , the perturbations of electrons and neutrinos start to oscillate together with the baryon - photon plasma at first .",
    "after the first half oscillation , only the perturbations of neutrinos are smoothed off due to their free - streaming  @xcite .",
    "however , the freeze out of the n - p ratio occurs before the first half oscillation as we will show in the next subsection and the perturbations are not yet smoothed off at that time .",
    "therefore we do not have to consider the difference between electrons and neutrinos when we calculate the n - p ratio with the perturbations on @xmath4 .",
    "now , let us consider the behavior of the perturbations for @xmath23 .",
    "hereafter we basically follow the notation of  @xcite .",
    "we use the conformal newtonian gauge where the metric is given by , @xmath35 the radiation ( photons and neutrinos ) perturbations @xmath36 can be defined by its distribution function @xmath37 as , @xmath38}\\right)-1\\right]^{-1}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath39 and @xmath40 denote the amplitude and direction of the momentum of photons respectively .",

    "note that after @xmath45-integration @xmath46 does not dependent on @xmath47-direction because of the homogeneity and isotropy of the universe .",
    "hereafter we omit the arguments of @xmath36 for simplicity where it does not lead to confusion . with use of the properties of the legendre polynomial , we can obtain , @xmath48 in the second line , we used the fact that in the tight - coupling limit we can neglect @xmath46 ( @xmath49 )  @xcite . in the followings , we refer to @xmath50 as @xmath51 .",
    "assuming photons and neutrinos evolve conjointly until the freeze out of the n - p ratio , we can obtain the evolution of the gravitational potential ( @xmath52 ) and the radiation ( photons and neutrinos ) perturbations ( @xmath53 and @xmath54 ) as  @xcite , @xmath55 where @xmath56 is an initial condition of the gravitational potential on the superhorizon scale and connected with the primordial curvature perturbation @xmath57 by @xmath58 .",
    "where @xmath59 after the neutrino decoupling  @xcite .",
    "however , since we here consider the perturbations which reenter the horizon soon after the neutrino decoupling , we simply used the factor of @xmath60 .",
    "anyway this difference solely cause a factor modification on the curvature perturbation constraints . ]",
    "the detailed derivations of eqs .",
    "( [ g_potential][theta1 ] ) are described in the appendix [ app : decay_mode ] . in the superhorizon limit ( @xmath61 )",

    ", the gravitational potential decays @xmath66 and the temperature perturbations oscillate as @xmath67 and @xmath68 . here",
    "note that the amplitude of the oscillation of temperature perturbations @xmath69 is given by @xmath70 and time - independent .",
    "therefore this relation is often used in the calculation of cmb distortions for example . however , around the horizon scale , the decaying modes ( @xmath71 , @xmath72 ) can not be neglected and the amplitude of the temperature perturbations are suppressed by factor 9 as @xmath73 .",
    "indeed this fact yields factor modifications for the constraints on the curvature perturbations .",
    "now , in order to understand the temperature dependence of the perturbations visually , we consider the perturbation which enter the horizon soon after neutrinos are decoupled .",
    "namely , assuming that neutrinos are decoupled at @xmath74 instantaneously , we focus on the mode which satisfies @xmath75 at @xmath74 . indeed it is found that the concrete value of @xmath76 is around @xmath77 with use of the following relation between time and temperature in the radiation dominated era  @xcite : @xmath78 where @xmath79 and @xmath80 are the cosmic time and temperature in units of sec and mev , respectively , and @xmath81 with @xmath82 being the effective degree of freedom ( d.o.f ) . in that era , the conformal time satisfies @xmath83 and therefore @xmath84 .",

    "the n - p ratio is determined by the weak interaction among neutrons , protons , electrons ( positrons ) , and neutrinos ( antineutrinos ) .",

    "namely @xmath100 .",
    "in fact there is a neutron - decay process ( @xmath101 ) but the lifetime of neutron is so long as @xmath102 and it does not work until sufficient low temperature @xmath103 .",
    "therefore we will neglect the neutron decay and simply calculate the freeze - out value of the n - p ratio . on the other hand ,",
    "the reaction rate of the conversion from protons to neutrons is determined by @xmath104 and @xmath105 , neglecting the three - body process @xmath106 . accordingly",

    "let us assume an illustrative situation that only two same comoving volume patches enter the horizon soon after the neutrino decoupling and one has slightly high temperature @xmath121 and the other has slightly low temperature @xmath122 . is a positive number representing the variance of the temperature perturbations , while it will directly denote the perturbation value in each patch which becomes both positive and negative in subsection  [ gaussian distribution ] .",

    "let us calculate the reaction rate in the high temperature patch ( @xmath121 ) .",
    "in that patch , @xmath123 and @xmath124 are modified to @xmath125 and @xmath126 , which are defined as ,    @xmath127    then , let @xmath128 denote the n - p ratio in the high temperature patch whose evolution is determined by , @xmath129 where @xmath130 and @xmath131 are given by , @xmath132 with use of eq .",

    "( [ xn+ ] ) and derive the evolution of @xmath128 .    on the other hand , in the low temperature patch we only have to change the sign of @xmath36 ( @xmath133 )",
    ". then the evolution of n - p ratio in that patch ( @xmath134 ) are described as , @xmath135 similarly to @xmath128 , we can obtain the temperature dependence of @xmath134 from this equation with use of eq .",
    "( [ time_temp ] ) .    finally , we have to mention how we should average the two n - p ratio , @xmath128 and @xmath134 .",
    "if the perturbations are adiabatic ( @xmath136 ) , the two patches have different number density of baryons .",
    "since @xmath92 is just a ratio of neutrons to baryons , we have to weight it by the number of baryons included in each patch . here",
    "we have assumed that two patches have the same comoving volume ( @xmath137 ) at the horizon cross .",
    "therefore the physical volumes of the two patches are given by @xmath138 ( hot ) and @xmath139 ( cold ) , where @xmath140 means the value at the horizon cross .",
    "for example , the baryon number ( @xmath141 ) included in the high temperature patch ( @xmath121 ) is given by @xmath142 where @xmath26 is the averaged baryon number density and we use the fact @xmath143 .    to check the validity of eq .",
    "( [ newtonian_patch ] ) , let us rederive the weight factor in the spatially flat gauge as well as the conformal newtonian gauge .",
    "that is because it is trivial how to take spatial averages in the spatially flat gauge since there is no metric perturbation and no difference between a comoving and physical volume . between these gauges",
    ", one can derive the relation @xmath144 , using two expressions of the gauge invariant curvature perturbation @xmath145 .",
    "then , the baryon number included in the high temperature patch is given by , @xmath146 which is indeed consistent with eq .",
    "( [ newtonian_patch ] ) .    then the averaged @xmath92 is given by @xmath147 where @xmath148 represents the amplitude of the perturbations , @xmath149 .",
    "after the freeze - out of @xmath92 , neutrons gradually convert to protons due to their decay process until @xmath2he synthesis .",
    "therefore , the final @xmath2he abundance with perturbations can be written as @xmath150 with the decay factor @xmath151 .",

    "the planck consistent decay factor can be easily evaluated by @xmath156 where @xmath157 is the central value of bbn prediction with planck s best fit parameters  @xcite .",
    "however , if there are large density perturbations , their decay due to the silk damping causes energy injection and increases the photon number density after bbn but before the last scattering surface .",
    "therefore the baryon - photon ratio during the bbn era should be larger than that evaluated by the cmb observation , and that modification is given by  @xcite , @xmath158 hence it possibly changes the decay factor , though the n - p ratio itself does not depend on the baryon - photon ratio directly .    from eq .",
    "( [ d ] ) , the modification of the decay factor is estimated as , @xmath159,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and it gives , @xmath160 with concrete parameter values .",
    "however it is much smaller than the modification of n - p ratio itself @xmath161 as we will see in fig .",
    "[ fig : sigma_n - p ] .",
    "therefore the modification of the decay factor can be neglected . with use of the deutron abundance , which is sensitive to the value of @xmath162 .",
    "however the constraints are weaker ( @xmath163 ) and independent of our constraints with the n - p ratio . ]    with use of the decay factor @xmath156 , we can obtain the constraints on the freeze - out value @xmath164 with perturbations , so that the @xmath2he abundance to be consistent with the observational value @xmath165",

    ", we showed how we can calculate the averaged @xmath92 exactly .",
    "however , for the calculation over many patches in the next subsection , we would like to use some approximated forms of the reaction rates to avoid time - consuming numerical integrations .",
    "though we postpone the detail derivation to appendix  [ app : approximation ] , we can obtain the following approximations under the assumptions that temperature is sufficiently higher than the mass difference @xmath167 and the pauli - blocking factors are negligible : @xmath168    if we include the perturbation , the reaction rates reads ( see appendix  [ app : taylor_ex ] for detail derivations ) , up to @xmath169 ,    @xmath170 + 3a+3b+c+\\frac{q}{t}(3a+b)\\right)\\bar{\\theta}^2\\right ) \\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1 } ,      \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where we have assumed @xmath171 and @xmath172 and @xmath173 are given by , @xmath174    now let us evaluate the precision of the approximated forms .",
    "since these forms use the high - temperature limit as mentioned , they are expected not to be valid at low temperature .",
    "indeed as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : xn_exact_app_e ] @xmath175 which is obtained by the approximated reaction rates  ( [ l_nnu_app][l_pnu_app ] ) starts to deviate from the exact @xmath176 around @xmath177 .",

    "however it is expected that the dynamics of @xmath92 after the freeze - out will not depend on the perturbations so much .",
    "therefore the final value of @xmath92 could be obtained by multiplying @xmath92 at some ( not - so - low ) temperature by some numerical factor which is independent of the amplitude of perturbations .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : freeze_sigma ] , we plot the ratio of @xmath181 to @xmath182 , which shows that the ratio does not depend on the value of perturbations and hence justifies the above expectation .",

    "can be averaged over the gauss distribution . in the following we define @xmath188 as the variance of the curvature perturbations @xmath189 .",
    "we already see how the n - p ratio should be calculated in each patch in subsection  [ taking account of perturbations ] .",
    "for example , in the high temperature patch we can derive the freeze out value of the n - p ratio using eq.([xn+ ] ) .",

    "the freeze - out is advanced and the final freeze - out value becomes larger . here recall that these values should be averaged with a weight factor @xmath202 .",
    "namely the smaller freeze out value in the high temperature patch is weighted by the heavier weight @xmath202 , while the larger freeze out value in the low temperature patch is weighted by the lighter weight @xmath203 . therefore this effect works to decrease the averaged freeze - out value . from our results ( fig .",
