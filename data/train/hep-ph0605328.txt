    "the retardation effect between two interacting particles is a relativistic phenomenon , due to the finiteness of the interaction speed .",

    "our method to treat the retardation effects relies on the hypothesis that the relative time between the quark and the antiquark must have a nonzero value .",
    "consequently , in our approach , the evolution parameter of the system is not the common proper time of the quark , the antiquark and the string , but the time coordinate of the center of mass which plays the role of an  average \" time .",
    "we showed in ref .",
    "@xcite that , in the special case where the quark and the antiquark have the same mass , the part of the total hamiltonian containing the retardation terms could be treated as a perturbation .",
    "this perturbation is a harmonic oscillator in the relative time variable , with an effective reduced mass and an effective restoring force both depending on eigenstates of the unperturbed hamiltonian ( which is independent of the relative time ) .",
    "the fundamental state of this oscillator gives the contribution of the retardation to the masses as well as the relative time part of the wave function .",
    "so , the relative time wave function is a gaussian function centered around zero .",

    "the amplitude of the deformation decreases when the quantum numbers increase ; but it is zero for a vanishing angular momentum .",
    "we finally argued that the contribution of the bending of the string to the mass spectrum is around 1 - 4  mev .",
    "the typical meson mass scale is around 1 - 2  gev , and the retardation contribution computed in a previous work with a straight string is always smaller than 100  mev .",
    "so , the effects of the curvature are very weak , although rather interesting from a theoretical point of view . however ,",
    "if one is mainly interested in the computation of a mass spectrum , we can conclude from our present work that the rotating string with nonzero relative time can give satisfactory results , event with a straight string approximation .",
    "we leave the analysis of the rotating string model equations with nonzero relative time and curved string for future work .",
