    "<S> the classical part in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ ave - cfi - qfi ] ) scales with the number of probes @xmath39 as @xmath40 [ shot - noise ] , but the quantum part can scale beyond as @xmath41 [ heisenberg ] . </S>",

    "<S> this is a possibility mostly absent before having the extended convexity property . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss this later through a specific example . </S>",
    "<S> iv . to obtain the tightest upper bound </S>",
    "<S> , we should perform a minimization over all ensemble decompositions of @xmath9 , namely @xmath42 . in the following </S>",
    "<S> we employ the concept of nsld and prove that this minimization indeed leads to the very exact qfi of the open system .    _ </S>",

    "<S> ( [ sld ] ) . </S>",

    "<S> in contrast , here we introduce a non - hermitian _ symmetric _ logarithmic derivative ( whence nsld ) , which is also used to obtain an upper bound on qfi . </S>",
    "<S> our specific motivation to employ nsld is that a non - hermitian candidate ( @xmath43 ) for sld for time as a parameter can be simply read from the lindblad dynamical equation of an open quantum system @xcite @xmath44 where @xmath45 , @xmath46 is the ( lamb - shift modified ) system hamiltonian , and @xmath47 are quantum jump operators encapsulating together with the time - independent parameters @xmath48 the effect of environment . </S>",

    "<S> we call the right - hand side the  extended qfi \" @xmath53 . </S>",

    "<S> although with an nsld the bound might not be achievable in some cases , it yet imposes an intrinsic quantum lower bound on the estimation error , independent of measurement , which in some cases is more feasible to calculate . </S>",
    "<S> it is evident that the nsld is not unique ; any operator @xmath55 for which @xmath56 can be added to @xmath50 ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus unlike qfi ( [ def : qfi ] ) , which is invariant with respect to freedom in the hermitian sld @xmath13 , @xmath53 depends on the choice of nsld . </S>",
    "<S> thus one can minimize over nslds in order to obtain a tighter upper bound . </S>",
    "<S> we show in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite that this minimization has indeed a natural geometric interpretation ( which can relate quantum metrology to concepts such as geometric phase @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> any state can be decomposed ( or purified ) as @xmath57 , with @xmath58 with an arbitrary unitary @xmath59 , which in turn induces a metric for curves of density matrices based on the scalar product @xmath60 $ ] . </S>",

    "<S> now we apply the extended convexity bound ( [ ave - cfi - qfi ] ) in which  bearing in mind eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ f_u - text ] ) for the extended qfi  we replace on the right - hand side @xmath67 with @xmath68 . </S>",
    "<S> it is straightforward to see that if in the proof of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ ave - cfi - qfi ] ) we use an nsld ( @xmath69 ) rather than sld ( @xmath25 ) , the final result changes to @xmath70 $ ] . from @xmath71 one can read a compatible nsld defined through @xmath72 , in which @xmath73 is an arbitrary real constant . </S>",
    "<S> hence @xmath74 where we have employed the trace - preserving property @xmath75 . </S>",
    "<S> minimization of eq .   over @xmath73 yields @xmath76 , where @xmath77 and @xmath78 . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , we still have the freedom to minimize over all compatible convex decomposition of @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> this minimization here translates to minimization over all kraus operators @xmath79 compatible with the dynamics @xmath62 . </S>",
    "<S> thus the tightest bound is obtained as @xmath80 in fact , this is an _ equality _ , because this bound has been already proved in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite  albeit through a different approach  to be the very qfi @xmath81 . </S>",
    "<S> this fact proves in an indirect manner that our combined convexity - nsld approach generates the exact ( hence obviously achievable ) qfi .    </S>",
    "<S> in addition to this appealing feature of our framework , in the following we discuss two other applications of our results , which further enhance the utility of the framework .    </S>",
    "<S> _ _ extended convexity and quantum - to - classical transition.__as remarked earlier , the extended convexity relation ( [ ave - cfi - qfi ] ) divides the upper bound on qfi into _ classical _ and _ quantum _ parts . </S>",
    "<S> this is a physically appealing feature in that this division enables to discern how classical and quantum parts compete in qfi ( whence in the metrology precision ) . as a result , </S>",
    "<S> one may infer when there can exist a threshold number of probes @xmath82 below which the error can show a heisenberg - like scaling , while above that the error eventually reduces to the shot - noise limit ( as predicted in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , this helps determine for probe sizes lager than a specific threshold value @xmath82 , using quantum resources ( e.g. , entanglement ) to enhance estimation is ineffective  since one may reach the same estimation error exactly through classical schemes with an approximately equal probe size . </S>",
    "<S> another immediate special result of our extended convexity property , as discussed in a remark after eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ ave - cfi - qfi ] ) , is that for the special class of classically - simulatable quantum channels qfi is always bounded linearly , hence associated estimation errors scale classically ( i.e. , shot - noise limit ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the following example illustrates further how a quantum - to - classical transition in noisy / open quantum metrology can be identified .    _ </S>",
    "<S> example 1._consider a dephasing quantum channel with kraus operators @xmath83+i\\sqrt{1-q}\\sin[\\alpha \\mathrm{x}]\\sigma_z)e^{i \\mathrm{x } \\tau \\sigma_z/2}$ ] and @xmath84+\\sqrt{1-q}\\cos[\\alpha \\mathrm{x}]\\sigma_z)e^{i \\mathrm{x } \\tau \\sigma_z/2}$ ] , where @xmath85 is a pauli matrix , @xmath86 is arbitrary , @xmath87 characterizes the amount of loss ( note that @xmath88 can in general depend on @xmath11 ) , and @xmath0 is the parameter to be estimated . </S>",
    "<S> if we assume @xmath39 initial probes each of which evolving through a separate dephasing channel , one can see that the states @xmath89 and the probabilities @xmath90 $ ] constitute a mixture , where @xmath91 indicates the @xmath92th probe . by choosing @xmath93 , where @xmath94 , eq .   </S>",

    "<S> this property implies that quantum fisher information of a mixture ( convex decomposition ) comprising of quantum states with some probabilities is bounded by average quantum fisher information of constituent states plus classical fisher information attributed to the mixing probabilities . </S>",

    "<S> for example , we supplemented this convexity property with a notion of non - hermitian symmetric logarithmic derivative to prove that our convexity relation gives rise to exact value of quantum fisher information in a general open - system / noisy quantum metrology . </S>",
    "<S> the non - hermitian extension has also been shown to have several appealing physical implications on its own . </S>",
    "<S> this concept has enabled us to derive general , closed ( and simple ) upper bounds on quantum fisher information for open - system scenarios with lindbladian ( or dynamical semigroup ) dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> an interesting and practically relevant feature of such bounds is that they clearly relate dynamics to the expected precision of an associated quantum metrology scenario . </S>",
    "<S> we have also demonstrated that these bounds are exact or close - to - exact in some important physical systems , and have an intuitive geometrical interpretation .    </S>",
    "<S> another opening that our extended convexity property has made possible is to track how in a quantum metrology scenario precision exhibits a classical ( shot - noise ) or quantum ( sub - shot - noise or heisenberg ) behavior . in particular , we have shown that as the number of probes increases , a competition between classical and quantum parts of fisher information could determine whether and when ( in terms of probe size ) to expect either of classical or quantum regimes . </S>",
    "<S> it is evident that this possibility can have numerous implications for classical / quantum control and for optimizing a metrology scenario for high - precision advanced technologies in physical ( and even biological ) systems @xcite .    </S>",
