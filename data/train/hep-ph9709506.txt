    "in the effort to determine the dynamics of the spontaneous breaking of the electroweak gauge symmetry , the discovery of the higgs boson would be of prime importance .",
    "detecting the higgs boson is one of the biggest challenges for the cern lhc  @xcite , both for a perturbative scenario for the symmetry breaking sector , with a higgs boson mass below the @xmath6-boson pair production threshold , and also if some strong interaction dynamics should be responsible for @xmath7 breaking  @xcite . in both cases small signal rates , due to small usable decay branching fractions and/or small production rates , or large standard model ( sm ) backgrounds",
    "will have to be faced .    in order to isolate a higgs signal",
    "one will have to utilize all its characteristics . in turn",
    "this requires a simulation of the expected sm backgrounds with a high degree of detail , in a region of phase space where little or no experimental input exists at present .",
    "this problem is particularly acute for the search of a very heavy higgs boson , with a mass above @xmath8  gev . here",
    "one will want to search for a higgs resonance in the scattering of longitudinal weak bosons , or , more generally , one will look for some structure in the invariant mass distribution of the produced weak boson pairs in electroweak processes of the type @xmath9  @xcite .",
    "numerous studies over the past several years have indicated that for the weak boson scattering signal to be identifiable , it is necessary to tag one or possibly two of the forward jets which arise from the scattered quarks  @xcite .",
    "a second characteristic of the weak boson scattering process is the lack of color exchange between the two incident quarks , which distinguishes it from typical background processes which proceed via the @xmath10-channel exchange of color octet gluons .",
    "these different color structures are expected to lead to a rapidity gap signature for the signal , either in terms of soft hadrons , at low luminosity  @xcite or in terms of mini - jets  @xcite .",
    "the small branching ratios of purely leptonic decays of the produced weak bosons can be overcome by studying the semi - leptonic modes , e.g. @xmath1 . here",
    "large backgrounds form @xmath5+jets production put a premium on good @xmath5-mass reconstruction of the two decay jets , in a situation where the large @xmath5 energy leads to a small separation of the two jets .",
    "an advantage of this decay mode is the observability of the @xmath4 decay angular distribution which may allow a measurement of the longitudinal @xmath5 polarization of the signal .",
    "most of these points have been considered before .",
    "the detectability of the @xmath1 signal with jet tagging techniques , for example , has been discussed in the atlas and cms technical design reports  @xcite .",
    "however , these studies have been based on parton shower monte carlo programs and it is not clear how well these programs describe the high @xmath11 jets associated with the decaying @xmath5 . also the color coherence effects which are at the basis of a rapidity gap trigger can not be expected to be modeled correctly in these analyses .    in this paper",
    "we perform a complementary study , based on full qcd matrix elements of all subprocesses contributing to the signal and to the various backgrounds .",
    "we consider the signal process  @xcite q_1q_2q_3q_4w^+w^- q_3q_4 ljj ( and crossing related ones ) with a double forward jet tag on the two scattered quarks , @xmath12 and @xmath13 . for the dominant @xmath5+jets qcd background",
    "we thus need the qcd matrix elements for all subprocesses leading to @xmath14  jet events  @xcite .",
    "similarly , the potentially large @xmath15 background needs to be simulated with two additional partons in the final state  @xcite , in order to account for the two tagging jets .",
    "when studying the consequences of different color structures on soft gluon radiation patterns , the @xmath16 qcd corrections for the signal must be known as well  @xcite .",
    "while the parton level monte carlo programs for the individual subprocesses have been available in the literature , we here perform a first study of the @xmath1 mode with full qcd matrix elements for signal and background subprocesses .    in section  [ sec:2 ] we present these calculational tools in some detail . for the discussion of gluon radiation patterns we employ the truncated shower approximation which is briefly described at the end of that section .",
    "the isolation of the @xmath1 signal , with double forward jet tagging , but without considering the @xmath5-mass reconstruction from the @xmath4 decay is considered in section  [ sec:3 ] . here the hadronic system arising from the @xmath5-decay will be considered as a single jet .",
    "the properties of this @xmath5-decay jet , its internal dijet structure , and the measurement of the @xmath5-mass is the subject of section  [ sec:4 ] .",
    "here we also consider the measurement of the @xmath5 polarization via the energy asymmetry of the two decay jets  @xcite . parameterizing the results of the @xmath5-mass analysis in terms of a reconstruction efficiency , we return to the simpler analysis , without simulating the @xmath4 dijet structure , in section  [ sec:5 ] .",
    "we consider the mini - jet patterns which arise from additional gluon radiation in the higgs signal and @xmath14  jets background , or from @xmath17-quark jets in the @xmath18 background , as an additional selection criterion . with a central mini - jet veto above @xmath19 gev ,",
    "the combined background is reduced well below the signal level , without significantly reducing the signal cross section . for an integrated luminosity of 100 fb@xmath20 ,",
    "the expected event rate after all cuts is 99 ( 91 ) events for a @xmath21  gev ( 1  tev ) higgs boson signal , with a combined background of 41 events .",

    "the signal process to be considered at lowest order is the subprocess @xmath22 and crossing related processes . in the following",

    "<S> the discovery of a heavy higgs boson with mass up to @xmath0 tev at the cern lhc is possible in the @xmath1 decay mode . the weak boson scattering signal and backgrounds from @xmath2 and from @xmath3jets production </S>",
    "<S> are analyzed with parton level monte carlo programs which are built on full tree level amplitudes for all subprocesses . </S>",
    "<S> the use of double jet tagging and the reconstruction of the w invariant mass reduce the combined backgrounds to the same level as the higgs signal . a central mini - jet veto , which distinguishes the different gluon radiation patterns of the hard processes , further improves the signal to background ratio to about 2.5:1 , with a signal cross section of 1  fb </S>",
    "<S> . the jet energy asymmetry of the @xmath4 decay will give a clear signature of the longitudinal polarization of the @xmath5s in the final event sample . </S>"
