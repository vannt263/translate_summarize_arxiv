    "over the past five years , tremendous efforts have been devoted to the search for dark matter through microlensing effects .",
    "this systematic search has provided two large databases of variable stars in the magellanic clouds due respectively to the eros group ( renault et al .",
    "1996 , beaulieu & sasselov 1996 and references therein ) and the macho group ( welch et al . 1996 and references therein ) .",
    "the wealth of data collected for cepheids by both projects provides a unique tool to analyse period - luminosity relations and their sensitivity to metal abundances . a significant number of beat cepheids , oscillating in both the fundamental ( f ) and first overtone ( 1h ) modes or the first and second ( 2h ) overtone modes",
    "have also been observed in the clouds .",
    "the analysis of the eros cepheids ( sasselov et al .",
    "1997 , s97 ) in the small ( smc ) and large ( lmc ) magellanic clouds has recently revived the old debate regarding the metallicity dependence of the period - luminosity ( pl ) relationship ( see tanvir 1997 for a review ) .",
    "a careful comparison of the observed pl relations in both clouds enabled s97 to disentangle from differential distance and reddening a significant metallicity effect , which is not predicted by theoretical analysis ( chiosi , wood & capitano 1993 , cwc93 ) .",
    "analysis of beat cepheids based on the opal opacity data set ( iglesias & rogers 1991 ; iglesias and rogers 1996 ) yield now good agreement for galactic bump and beat cepheids ( moskalik et al .",
    "1992 ; christensen - dalsgaard 1993 , christensen - dalsgaard and petersen 1995 ) , but discrepancies still remain regarding the magellanic clouds ( christensen - dalsgaard & petersen 1995 ; buchler et al . 1996 ; morgan & welch 1997 , mw97 ) .",
    "none of the afore - mentioned analysis is really consistent since the stability analysis are based on envelope models using input physics different from the ones entering the stellar evolution calculations .",
    "moreover , the width of the instability strip and in particular the position of the blue edge are deduced from stability analysis , varying arbitrarily @xmath2 for a given mass - luminosity ( ml ) relationship , independently of any stellar evolution constraint on @xmath2 .",
    "the aim of this letter is to present fully consistent stellar and pulsation calculations based on the most recent opacity data set . in ",
    "2 we present the stellar and pulsation calculations .",
    "section 3 is devoted to the comparison with the observed pl relationships for fundamental mode pulsators in the smc and lmc .",
    "the beat cepheids are analysed in section 4 and conclusions are given in  5 .",
    "our stellar evolution calculations include the updated opal opacities ( iglesias & rogers 1996 ) for t @xmath3 . for lower temperatures , we use the alexander & fergusson ( 1994 ) opacities .",
    "convection is based on the mixing - length theory with a mixing length parameter @xmath4 = 1.5 @xmath5 .",
    "the onset of convective instability is based on the schwarzschild criterion , without either overshooting or semi - convection prescriptions .",
    "the linear non - adiabatic stability analysis is based on a radial pulsation code originally developed by lee ( 1985 ; lee and saio 1989 ) . the convective flux @xmath6 is assumed to be frozen in , i.e. the perturbations @xmath7 are neglected into the linearized energy equation .    the stellar evolution and pulsation codes are coupled .",
    "this yields a fully consistent mass - luminosity - period - evolutionary time relationship .",
    "we have computed stellar models in the mass range 3 - 12 @xmath8 with various chemical composition ( z , y ) = ( 0.02 , 0.28 ) , ( 0.01 , 0.25 ) and ( 0.004 , 0.25 ) , representative of respectively the galactic , lmc and smc environments .",
    "the detailed evolutionary tracks will be published elsewhere and we focus in the present letter on the main results .",
    "figure 1 shows the evolutionary tracks of z=0.004 stars in a theoretical hertzsprung - russell diagram ( hrd ) , for m = 3 - 7 @xmath8 .",
    "unstable models are indicated by either open circles or crosses .",
    "the distinction is purely artificial : the crosses refer to the usual cepheid `` blue loop '' instability which occurs during the central helium burning phase while the open circles correspond to the first rapid crossing of the hrd when the stars evolve off the main sequence toward the red giant branch on a thermal timescale .",
    "this phase , of typically @xmath9 years , is referred to in the following as the `` first crossing instability '' .",
    "since this phase is about 1/100 shorter than the blue loop one , the large data base now available may allow the detection of some cepheids in the first crossing instability .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "1 , the extension of the 3 @xmath8 blue loop ( crosses , solid line ) is significantly reduced , compared to higher mass stars . in this case , the blue edge is determined by the _ turn - over of the evolutionary track_. this reduction of the blue loop extension is expected from stellar evolution since blue loops during core helium burning start at a minimum mass @xmath10 and vanish for m @xmath11 , depending on the initial composition and the convective mixing treatment ( cf .",
    "el eid 1994 ) .",
    "note that @xmath10 decreases with metallicity .",
    "we find @xmath12 for z=0.004 , @xmath13 for z=0.01 and @xmath14 for z=0.02 .",
    "in fig . 2a - b we compare our calculations with observed fundamental mode pulsators in the lmc and smc in a p - @xmath15 diagram . the eros ( @xmath16 , @xmath17 ) magnitudes were transformed into the johnson - v magnitude according to beaulieu et al .",
    "we adopt the extinction e(b - v ) = 0.10 for the lmc and e(b - v ) = 0.125 for the smc with r@xmath18 = 3.3 and distance moduli @xmath19 = 18.5 for the lmc and @xmath19 = 19.13 for the smc ( cf .",
    "beaulieu et al .",
    "comparison is also made with the laney & stobie ( 1994 , ls94 ) data , which extend to longer periods than the eros data .",
    "the transformation of the theoretical quantities ( l , @xmath2 ) into m@xmath18 are based on the allard and hauschildt ( 1998 ) most recent atmosphere models .",
    "these models originally developed for m - dwarfs do not extend below log g @xmath20 3.5 .",
    "we therefore use the bolometric corrections at constant log g = 3.5 but take metallicity effects into account .",
    "we verified however that gravity effects in the v - band are small .",
    "we determine a theoretical statistical p - @xmath21 relationship under the form @xmath22 with a weighted least square fit by minimizing the quantity : @xmath23 where the summation extends over all the stellar masses .",
    "the coefficients @xmath24 depend on the mass distribution and on the evolutionary times .",
    "we adopt a salpeter mass function ( mf ) @xmath25 and the time dependence derives directly from the coupled evolution and pulsation calculations . although the present day mf in the mc may differ from an initial salpeter mf , we verified that variations of the slope of the mf between -2 and -4 barely affect the slope of the pl relationship .",
    "such a steep mf favors the lowest mass stars because ( i ) of the number of stars itself and ( ii ) of the longer time spent in the instability strip as the mass decreases .",
    "the slope of the pl relationship is thus hardly affected by stars with m @xmath26 . in fig .",
    "2a , comparison is made between the smc observations and the z=0.004 models with masses m= 3 - 12 @xmath8 .",
    "the first crossing unstable models are indicated by open circles but only for m @xmath27 .",
    "although included in the calculations , the first crossing instability phase for m @xmath28 is statistically insignificant , since the time spent during this phase is more than 300 times smaller than the time spent by a 4 @xmath8 in the instability strip ( first crossing and blue loop ) .",
    "we thus predict the existence of cepheids with periods @xmath29 day , as the signature of the first instability strip , but the observation of these objects requires larger statistics .",
    "the models agree reasonably well with the observed width of the instability strip , although they do not reach the observed blue edge of the eros data .",
    "the faintest objects ( @xmath30 ) seem to indicate a change of slope in the pl relationship , becoming steeper for log p @xmath31 , as discovered in the eros-2 cepheid sample and analysed carefully by bauer ( 1997 ) and bauer et al .",
    "we note that such a trend is observed in the theoretical relation near @xmath323 @xmath8 .",
    "this change of slope is thus real and stems from stellar evolution , illustrating the reduction of the he blue loop as mass decreases ( cf",
    ".  2 ) . note also that the period of the minimum mass undergoing a blue loop ( @xmath33 ) is consistent with the faintest observed smc cepheids .",
    "finally the average slope of our p - @xmath21 relationship is @xmath34 = -2.92 , in excellent agreement with the slope derived by s97 .",
    "2b shows the results for the lmc with z=0.01 and masses from 3.75 to 12 @xmath8 . as in fig .",
    "2a , the models reproduce correctly the observed width of the instability strip and the overall agreement with observations is good .",
    "we note that the minimum theoretical `` unstable '' mass undergoing a blue loop @xmath13 for z=0.01 does not correspond to the faintest objects observed , which correspond to @xmath35 .",
    "we predict that fundamental pulsators with @xmath36 days should be in the first crossing instability . the slope of the pl relationship with a minimum mass of @xmath37 is @xmath34 = -2.50 , shallower than the one observed in the lmc by s97 . in order to test the influence of chemical composition",
    ", we have recomputed the whole grid of models with ( z=0.008 , y=0.25 ) and ( z=0.01 , y=0.28 ) , without any substantial modification of the theoretical slope . for solar metallicity models ,",
    "we find also a slope @xmath34 = -2.55 shallower than the one observed in the milky way .",
    "a detailed analysis of the possible sources for such discrepancies is under progress .",
    "figure 3a - b display the petersen diagrams for smc ( fig .",
    "3a ) , lmc and galactic ( fig .",
    "3b ) beat cepheids .",
    "the data are taken from eros ( beaulieu et al .",
    "1997b ) and macho ( alcock et al . 1995 ; alcock et al .",
    "1997 ) collaborations .",
    "comparison is also made with galactic f/1h pulsators ( szabados , 1988 ) .",
    "agreement with the f/1h mode pulsators is excellent for the three metallicities , except for the shortest periods of the lmc objects .",
    "the first crossing unstable models are also displayed , but predict slightly too high 1h / f period ratios and extremely short fundamental periods .",
    "a variation of y from 0.25 to 0.28 does not affect significantly the period ratios and the z=0.008 models give slightly higher period ratios than observed in the lmc , by 1 - 2% .",
    "the present models however yield a better agreement with observations than the one obtained by mw97 using the chiosi ( 1990 ) ml relationship with overshooting .",
    "the most striking and new result shown in fig .",
    "3 concerns the 1h/2h pulsators , which are reproduced by models in the first crossing instability . indeed , low luminosities are required to reproduce the observed period ratios at very short periods , as noted by mw97 .",
    "the luminosities during the he burning blue loop are already too large and yield too high p@xmath38 , as indicated by the crosses in fig .",
    "3 , as already noted by mw97 . in order to reproduce the observed shortest periods , they need masses m @xmath20 2 @xmath8 . fig . 1 shows however that the evolution during the first crossing takes place at a significantly fainter luminosity and allows to reach the shortest periods observed with masses m @xmath39 .",
    "we find that at least the four faintest 1h/2h beat cepheids of the beaulieu et al .",
    "( 1997b ) sample can be explained by models in the first crossing instability .",
    "this is statistically reasonable , considering that the total number of single mode cepheids ( f or 1h ) found by eros in the smc is 400 .",
    "since the lowest masses contribute dominantly to this total number , the probability to have 4 beat cepheids in this sample in the first crossing instability i.e @xmath40 is consistent with the ratio of the time spent in the first crossing instability phase to the total time spent in the instability strip ( f and 1h instability strips included ) ( cf .",
    "we have computed self - consistent calculations between stellar evolution and linear stability analysis for smc , lmc and galactic chemical compositions .",
    "this first consistent analysis yields good general agreement with the observed p - @xmath21 diagrams in the smc and lmc and reproduces reasonably well the width of the instability strip in both cases .",
    "the theoretical slope of the pl relationship is in excellent agreement with the empirical one derived by s97 for the smc .",
    "the puzzling trend of a change of slope observed for log p @xmath41 0.4 and discovered by bauer ( 1997 ) is reproduced by the models and thus can be explained by _ purely evolutionary _ effects due to the reduced extension of the blue loop with decreasing mass .    for the lmc ,",
    "the theoretical slope is @xmath32 15% less steep than the observed one .",
    "the minimum mass found to undergo a blue loop ( @xmath42 days ) corresponds to periods shorter by 20% than the ones of the faintest observed lmc cepheids ( @xmath43 days ) .",
    "variations of the metallicity and initial helium abundance do not solve this discrepancy .",
    "this shows the limitation of the present calculations and points out a remaining puzzle for the lmc cepheids .",
    "investigation of remaining uncertainties in the current stellar evolution models is under progress but requires numerous lengthy calculations .",
    "we indeed note that overshooting can change the minimum mass undergoing a blue loop and thus the minimum period",
    ". however , the good agreement found for the smc seems to indicate that the present standard evolutionary models are already basically correct .",
    "regarding beat cepheids , we show that 1h/2h pulsators with the shortest periods can _ only _ be reproduced by stars in the _ first crossing instability phase _ , with luminosity significantly lower than the one in the usual blue loop phase .",
    "this new result is supported by statistical arguments ( cf .",
    "finally , the present letter shows that consistent calculations between stellar evolution and pulsation analysis may give the right answer to some unexplained features of cepheids .",
    "we are grateful to the eros group and in particular to f. bauer for discussing the eros-2 cepheid sample prior to publication .",
    "we are also grateful to u. lee for providing the original pulsation code and to w. glatzel for helpful discussions .",
    "the calculations have been performed on the cray t3e of the centre detudes nuclaires de grenoble .",
