    "chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) to finite order is unable to describe resonances .",
    "actually , it is rather the opposite , resonances determine the bulk of the @xmath8 parameters  @xcite . such a description requires the use of a non - perturbative scheme .",
    "several approaches have been suggested , pade re - summation ( pr )  @xcite , large @xmath9expansion ( lne )  @xcite , inverse amplitude method ( iam )  @xcite , current algebra unitarization ( cau )  @xcite , dispersion relations ( dp )  @xcite , roy equations  @xcite , coupled channel lippmann - schwinger approach ( ccls )  @xcite and hybrid approaches  @xcite .",
    "besides their advantages and success to describe the data in the low - lying resonance region , any of them has specific drawbacks . in all above approaches except by lne and ccls it is not clear which is the chpt series of diagrams which has been summed up .",
    "this is not the case for the ccls approach , but there a three momentum cut - off is introduced , hence breaking translational lorentz invariance and therefore the scattering amplitude can be only evaluated in the the center of mass ( cm ) frame . on the other hand , though the lne and cau approaches preserve crossing symmetry , both of them violate unitarity .",
    "likewise , those approaches which preserve exact unitarity violate crossing symmetry .    in this paper",
    "we propose the use of the bethe - salpeter equation ( bse ) to sum up an infinite set of diagrams without use of cut - offs in the physical amplitudes .",
    "we will show that this re - summation restores exact elastic unitarity in the @xmath0 channel and it naturally leads to the appearance of the experimentally observed resonances . besides",
    ", crossing symmetry can be restored perturbatively .",
    "our approach , at lowest order and in the chiral limit reproduces the bubble re - summation undertaken in ref .",
    "for the sake of simplicity , we neglect coupled channels contributions and thus the bse for the scattering of two identical pseudo - scalar mesons of mass @xmath10 and kinematics described in fig .",
    "[ fig : kin ] , reads    to    @xmath11    where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the total scattering amplitude is determined by its relation with the differential cross section in the cm system of the two identical mesons and it is given by @xmath14 , where @xmath15 .",
    "the phase of the amplitude @xmath16 is such that the optical theorem reads @xmath17 , with @xmath18 the total cross section . ] and the two particle irreducible amplitude respectively . besides , @xmath19 is the exact pseudoscalar meson propagator .",
    "note that , to solve the above equation both the off - shell potential and amplitude are required .",
    "clearly , for the exact _ potential _ @xmath20 the bse provides an exact solution of the scattering amplitude @xmath16  @xcite .",
    "obviously an exact solution for @xmath16 is not accessible , since @xmath20 and @xmath19 are not exactly known .",
    "we propose an expansion along the lines of chpt both for the exact potential ( @xmath20 ) and the exact propagator ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "thus at lowest order in this expansion , @xmath20 should be replaced by the @xmath21 chiral amplitude ( @xmath22 ) and @xmath19 by the free meson propagator , @xmath23 . even at lowest order , by solving eq .",
    "( [ eq : bs ] ) we sum up an infinite set of diagramschannel is violated . ] .",
    "our expansion is related to the approach recently pursued for low energy @xmath24scattering where higher order @xmath25 and @xmath26channel contributions to the potential are suppressed in the heavy nucleon mass limit  @xcite .    to illustrate the procedure ,",
    "let us consider elastic @xmath1 scattering in the @xmath0 and @xmath2waves .",
    "there , for comparison with the experimental phase shifts , @xmath27 , we define the projection over each partial wave @xmath28 for each isospin channel @xmath29 @xmath30 \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath31 is the angle between @xmath32 and @xmath33 , @xmath34 are legendre polynomials and @xmath35 .      at lowest order",
    ", the off - shell potential @xmath20 in this channel is approximated by @xmath36 where @xmath10 is the pion mass , for which we take 134.98 mev , and @xmath37 the pion decay constant , for which we take 92.4 mev . to solve eq .",
    "( [ eq : bs ] ) with the above potential we propose a solution of the form @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 are functions to be determined .",
    "note that , as a simple one loop calculation shows , there appears a new off - shell dependence ( @xmath41 ) not present in the @xmath42 potential @xmath22 .",
    "that is similar to what happens in standard chpt  @xcite .",
    "the above ansatz reduces the bse to a linear algebraic system of equations which provides the full off - shell scattering amplitude .",
    "the resulting inverse amplitude on the mass shell and in the cm frame ( @xmath43 ) reads @xmath44 where @xmath45 \\left[(q+\\frac{p}{2})^2-m^2+{\\rm i}\\epsilon\\right]}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath46 and @xmath47 are ultraviolet divergent integrals and thus eq .  ( [ eq : swave ] ) requires renormalization .",
    "we have made use of translational and lorentz invariance which relate the integrals @xmath48 and @xmath49 with @xmath50 and the divergent constants @xmath51 and @xmath52 . note also that @xmath50 is only logarithmically divergent and it only requires one subtraction , ie .",
    ", @xmath53 is finite and it is given by @xmath54 where the complex phase of the argument of the @xmath55 is taken in the interval @xmath56    to renormalize the amplitude given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : swave ] ) , we note that in the spirit of an effective field theory ( eft ) all possible counter - terms should be considered .",
    "this can be achieved in our case in a perturbative manner , making use of the formal expansion of the bare amplitude @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is the two particle propagator .",
    "thus , a counter - term series should be added to the bare amplitude such that the sum of both becomes finite . at each order in the perturbative expansion",
    ", the divergent part of the counter - term series is completely determined .",
    "however , the finite piece remains arbitrary as long as the used _",
    "potential _ @xmath20 and the pion propagator are approximated rather than being the exact ones .",
    "our renormalization scheme is such that the renormalized amplitude can be cast , again , as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : swave ] ) .",
    "this amounts in practice , to interpret the previously divergent quantities @xmath59 as renormalized free parameters . after having renormalized",
    ", we add a superscript @xmath60 to differentiate between the previously divergent , @xmath59 , and now finite quantities , @xmath61 .",
    "these parameters and therefore the renormalized amplitude can be expressed in terms of physical ( measurable ) magnitudes . in principle , these quantities should be understood in terms of the underlying qcd dynamics , but in practice it seems more convenient so far to fit @xmath61 to the available data .",
    "the threshold properties of the amplitude ( scattering length , effective range , etc .. ) can then be determined from them .",
    "besides the pion properties @xmath10 and @xmath37 , at this order in the expansion we have three parameters .",
    "the appearance of three new parameters is not surprising because the highest divergence we find is quartic ( @xmath49 ) and therefore to make it convergent we need to perform three subtractions .",
    "this situation is similar to what happens in standard chpt where one needs to include at the one loop level some new low - energy parameters ( @xmath62 )  @xcite .",
    "in fact , if @xmath25 and @xmath26 channel unitarity corrections are taylor expanded around threshold , a comparison of our ( now ) finite amplitude , eq .",
    "( [ eq : swave ] ) , to the @xmath63 amplitude in terms of these parameters , @xmath6 , becomes possible .",
    "we do this explicitly in the appendix .    at the lowest order in the expansion proposed in this work , we approximate , in the scattering region @xmath64 , the @xmath65 @xmath25 and @xmath26 channel unitarity corrections ( function @xmath66 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : gl ] ) ) by a taylor expansion around threshold to order @xmath67 . at next order in our expansion ( when the full @xmath68-corrections are included both in the _ potential _ and in the pion propagator ) we will recover the full @xmath25 and @xmath26 channel unitarity logs at @xmath65 , and at the next order ( @xmath69 ) we will be approximating these logs by a taylor expansion to order @xmath70 .",
    "thus the analytical structure of the amplitude derived from the left hand cut is only recovered perturbatively .",
    "this is in common to other approaches ( pr , dp , iam @xmath71 ) fullfiling exact unitarity in the s - channel , as discussed in  @xcite ,  @xcite,@xcite .      at lowest order",
    ", the off - shell potential @xmath20 in this channel is approximated by @xmath72 as before , to solve eq .",
    "( [ eq : bs ] ) with the above potential we propose a solution of the form @xmath73 where @xmath74 and @xmath75 are functions to be determined .",
    "note that , as expected from our previous discussion for the @xmath0wave , there appears a new off - shell dependence ( @xmath76 ) not present in the @xmath42 potential .",
    "again , this ansatz reduces the bse to a linear algebraic system of equations which provides the full off - shell scattering amplitude .",
    "the resulting inverse amplitude on the mass shell , after angular momentum projection , and in cm frame reads @xmath77 similarly to the @xmath0wave case , the above equation presents divergences which need to be consistently removed in terms , for instance , of the scattering volume and effective range in the @xmath78-wave . because the highest divergence present is quadratic",
    "only two subtractions are needed and hence only two undetermined parameters appear . as we will discuss below , crossing symmetry at @xmath65 provides a relationship between the parameters entering in different isospin channels .",
    "we emphasize once more , that the proliferation of undetermined parameters is not a drawback as compared to standard chpt .",
    "the solutions of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : swave ] ) and ( [ eq : pwave ] ) satisfy elastic unitarity .",
    "indeed , the imaginary part of @xmath79 is determined by the imaginary part of @xmath80 and in the physical region is given by @xmath81 in agreement with the unitarity requirement provided @xmath10 is the physical pion mass .",
    "that makes possible to extract the phase shifts unambiguously within our framework .",
    "as we have already mentioned , our approach violates crossing symmetry . at order @xmath65 our isoscalar @xmath0 and isovector @xmath2wave amplitudes",
    "are polynomials of degree two in the variable @xmath82 , with a total of five ( 3 + 2 ) arbitrary coefficients ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : ej ] ) ) , and there are no logarithmical corrections to account for @xmath25 and @xmath26channel unitarity corrections ( @xmath66 term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : gl ] ) ) .",
    "far from the left hand cut , these latter corrections can be expanded in a taylor series to order @xmath67 , but in that case the one loop @xmath5 chpt @xmath0 and isovector @xmath2wave amplitudes can be cast as second order polynomials in the variable @xmath82 , with a total of four ( @xmath6 ) arbitrary coefficients  @xcite .",
    "to restore , in this approximation , crossing symmetry in our amplitudes requires the existence of a relationship between our five undetermined parameters .",
    "this relation reads ( see the appendix ) @xmath83 once this constraint is implemented in our model , there exists a linear relation between our remaining four undetermined parameters and the most commonly used @xmath6 parameters ( eq .  ( [ eq : li ] ) ) .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : spwaves ] we show the agreement of our model with the experimental phase shifts , both in the @xmath0 ( left ) and @xmath2(right)waves .",
    "we fit the four undetermined parameters ) to express @xmath84 in terms of @xmath85 and @xmath86 . ]",
    "@xmath87 and @xmath88 to the scalar and vector data .",
    "results of the combined fit can be found in table  [ tab : spwaves ] .",
    "values of @xmath89dof and the threshold parameters deduced from our formulae are also shown in table  [ tab : spwaves ] .",
    "as we see , the vector channel is satisfactorily described up to 1 gev , whereas the scalar channel is well reproduced up to 0.8 gev . in the latter case , and for these high energies , one should also include the mixing with the @xmath90 channel as pointed out recently in refs .  @xcite@xcite . regarding the deduced threshold parameters we find agreement within experimental uncertainties . for completeness",
    "we quote the deduced values for the low energy coefficients ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : li ] ) in the appendix ) @xmath91 if a fit to the data of refs .",
    "@xcite ,  @xcite is performed ) would have decreased ( increased ) roughly by a factor of 5 ( 2 ) . ] .",
    "as we see they are in reasonable good agreement with those obtained in standard chpt @xcite , which also use the same set of data to analyze @xmath7 scattering . when the data of ref.@xcite for the @xmath2wave are fitted we find compatible values for @xmath92 and incompatible values for @xmath93 .",
    "we prefer to use the data of ref .",
    "@xcite to estimate the low energy parameters @xmath94 , since they come much closer to threshold than those of ref .  @xcite ( @xmath95 mev versus 450 mev ) .",
    "furthermore both sets of data are incompatible up to about @xmath96 mev .",
    "once we have determined the parameters @xmath6 , the @xmath97 lowest order bse amplitude is completely fixed , as demanded from crossing symmetry .",

    "( [ eq : cons ] ) .",
    "errors in the fitted parameters are statistical and have been obtained by increasing the value of @xmath111 by one unit .",
    "we also give the threshold parameters @xmath112 and @xmath113 obtained from an expansion of the scattering amplitude , re@xmath114 $ ] close to threshold . in the the @xmath0wave channel and due to the lack of error estimates in ref .",
    "@xcite , we have assumed a rule of thumb error of 5% in the data and carry out the fit up to 900 mev .",
    "we have chosen this set of data because the data of refs .",
    "@xcite and  @xcite seem to be inconsistent between each other at low energies and cover near threshold a narrower region than that covered by the analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite . for the @xmath2wave , the data of refs .",
    "@xcite ( here again , we assume an error of 5% in the data , because the lack of error estimates of the original analysis ) and  @xcite disagree again , specially close to threshold . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     comparison to recent two - loop calculations  @xcite would also be possible . to make such a comparison really meaningful , we should include in our analysis higher waves than the @xmath0 and @xmath2waves considered here , which would necessarily require to include @xmath8 corrections to both the _ potential _ and the pion propagator .",
    "this point is out of the scope of this work and will be subject of future research  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , we would like to point out that the lowest order explored in this letter , though very simple , it already leads to reasonable sizes for the two loop contributions to the amplitudes .",
    "thus for instance , for the @xmath0wave scattering length we obtain @xmath115 , in a reasonable agreement with the findings of bijnens _ et al .",
    ", _ in ref .",
    "@xcite .    recent work , refs .",
    "@xcite@xcite , suggests that off - shellness can be ignored when solving the bse , since it only amounts to a pion mass and pion decay constant renormalization .",
    "this on - shell procedure corresponds to setting our @xmath116 and @xmath117 parameters to zero , and taking @xmath37 and @xmath10 as the physical parameters .",
    "direct inspection of our expressions shows that one can not simultaneously absorb the @xmath118 and @xmath119channel divergences by a redefinition of the @xmath10 and @xmath37 parameters . since the model of refs .",
    "@xcite@xcite has been constrained not to have these new parameters ( @xmath120 ) generated by the off - shellness it is impossible for them to simultaneously reproduce the @xmath118 and @xmath119channels ; a polynomial , with some new parameters , has to be added to the on shell - constrained solution of the bse to properly describe the resonance region in the @xmath107 channel .",
    "the inclusion of this polynomial with free parameters is justified  @xcite@xcite within the iam approach  @xcite .",
    "we would like to stress here that considering explicitly the off - shellness automatically embodies the iam , as it is invoked in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite , and thus incorporates such a polynomial .",
    "we have solved the bse for @xmath7 scattering in the ladder approximation .",
    "this is to say using the _ potential _ and pion propagator at lowest order in the chiral expansion .",
    "this calculation produces unitary amplitudes in the @xmath0channel and describes satisfactorily @xmath0 and @xmath2 wave phase - shifts from threshold up to the region of low - lying resonances .",
    "the present approach can be extended in principle to higher orders in the chiral expansion , i.e. , including in the _ potential _ and in the pion propagator terms of order @xmath8 and higher .",
    "the new divergences will become more severe and more subtraction constants will be needed .",
    "that will be translated in an increasing number of free parameters , as it is the case also of standard chpt . to be more specific , for instance , the @xmath8 _ potential _ contains unitarity corrections in the @xmath25 and @xmath26 channels , ( the corresponding @xmath0channel correction to the amplitude is not two particle irreducible ) .",
    "hence , the solution of the bse with this _ potential _ will automatically implement exact unitarity in the @xmath0channel and perturbative unitarity in the @xmath25 and @xmath26channels .",
    "the inclusion of unitarity corrections in the @xmath25 and @xmath26 channels in the _ potential _ makes the practical solution of the bse a cumbersome task and it is currently underway  @xcite .",
    "however , if one neglects these corrections in the @xmath25 and @xmath26 channels the bse can be solved using a much simpler algebraic procedure as shown here for the lowest order case . in that case only unitarity in the @xmath0channel will be restored and crossing symmetry will be violated .",
    "thus , one should expect a general solution , below the four pion production threshold , of the form @xmath121 where @xmath122 and @xmath123 are polynomials corresponds to the power @xmath124 .",
    "] of order @xmath125 ( corresponding to the order @xmath126 in the proposed expansion ) with real coefficients .",
    "most of these coefficients have to be fitted to the data to accomplish with the renormalization program .",
    "the resemblance to a sort of _ pade _ approximant for the inverse amplitude , although not exactly in the form proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , is striking . on the other hand , eq .",
    "( [ eq : pade ] ) provides a model of the type @xmath127  @xcite for the amplitude , where @xmath128 has a right cut and the function @xmath75 is approximated by a polynomial with no cuts .",
    "these ideas have been recently examined in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "finally , we should mention that to describe the @xmath0wave at higher energies than 0.8 gev , a coupled channel formalism needs to be used .",
