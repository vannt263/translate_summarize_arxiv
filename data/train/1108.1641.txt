    "harmonic maps into ( semi - simple ) riemannian symmetric spaces can be studied by infinite dimensional lie group theory ( _ loop groups _ ) .",
    "the dressing action of the loop group enables one to construct `` non - trivial solutions '' from a trivial solution and , meromorphically , new solutions from old / known ones .",
    "this is based on a weierstrass type representation for harmonic maps which was established by the first named author of the present paper , f.  pedit and h.  wu @xcite in terms of loop group decompositions .    as an application of the loop group method , constant mean curvature surfaces in euclidean @xmath0-space @xmath6",
    ", pseudo - spherical surfaces in @xmath6 and their indefinite analogues ( spacelike or timelike surfaces in minkowski @xmath0-space ) are studied extensively @xcite , @xcite . the loop group method to construct such _",
    "integrable surfaces _ is frequently called _ dpw method _ or _ generalized weierstrass type representation _ for surface geometry .    in euclidean geometry ,",
    "the starting point of the dpw method is that integrable surfaces are naturally associated with harmonic maps into the @xmath11-sphere @xmath12 with respect to appropriate conformal structures .",
    "more precisely , a surface in @xmath6 is of constant mean curvature if and only if its gauss map is harmonic .",
    "this characterization of constancy of mean curvature is referred to as the _ ruh - vilms property_. on the other hand , let @xmath13 be a surface in @xmath6 with negative or positive gaussian curvature . then the gaussian curvature is constant if and only if its gauss map is harmonic with respect to the conformal structure determined by the second fundamental form .",
    "this is another instance of the ruh - vilms property .",
    "analogously , in minkowski 3-space the corresponding integrable surfaces are associated with harmonic maps into hyperbolic @xmath11-space @xmath14 or de sitter @xmath11-space @xmath15 .    in mbius geometry ,",
    "a conformally immersed surface in mbius @xmath0-space @xmath16 is mbius minimal ( willmore ) if and only if its conformal gauss map ( central sphere congruence ) is a harmonic map into the moduli space of oriented @xmath11-spheres .",
    "note that via the projective light - cone model of the mbius @xmath0-space , the moduli space of all oriented @xmath11-spheres ( including point spheres ) is identified with the de sitter @xmath17-space @xmath18 , a semi - simple lorentzian symmetric space @xcite .",
    "burstall and u.  hertrich - jeromin @xcite proved the ruh - vilms property for certain surfaces in lie sphere geometry as well as projective differential geometry .",
    "more precisely , let @xmath19 be a surface in mbius space .",
    "then @xmath20 is said to be a _ lie minimal surface _ if @xmath20 is a critical point of the lie - area functional .",
    "note that the lie - area functional is invariant under the mbius group as well as the lie sphere transformation group . on the other hand , for every surface in real projective @xmath0-space @xmath21 , a projectively invariant area functional ( projective area ) has been introduced . a critical point of the projective area",
    "is called a _ projective minimal surface_. both the lie - minimality and projective minimality are characterized by the harmonicity of appropriate gauss maps taking values in a certain non - compact grassmann manifold equipped with an invariant indefinite semi - riemannian metric .",
    "in addition , e.  musso and l.  nicolodi @xcite showed that in laguerre geometry , laguerre - minimality of surfaces is characterized by the harmonicity of the laguerre gauss map ( _ middle sphere congruence _ ) .",
    "thus all these surfaces classes are defined by the ruh - vilms property .    here",
    "we should remark that all the target manifolds of _ harmonic gauss maps _ in lie - sphere , mbius , projective and laguerre geometries are semi - simple semi - riemannian _ symmetric spaces _ equipped with invariant indefinite metrics .    it would be interesting to characterize all surface geometries to which the dpw method is applicable .",
    "so far only partial results are known : see _ e.g. _ , the survey @xcite by the first named author and the recent classification , carried out by the third named author , of surfaces in 3-dimensional space forms which are _ real forms _ of complex constant mean curvature surfaces @xcite .    in this article , we give a _",
    "example of such a surface geometry .",
    "more precisely we shall show that the dpw method is also applicable to surfaces in hyperbolic @xmath0-space @xmath1 of constant mean curvature @xmath22 .",
    "the geometry of a cmc surface in @xmath1 depends on the range of the mean curvature . in case @xmath23 , there exist compact cmc surfaces in @xmath1 .",
    "it is well known that there exist natural , locally bijective correspondences ( so - called _ lawson correspondences _ ) between cmc surfaces in 3-dimensional space forms . in particular , cmc surfaces in @xmath1 with @xmath24 have corresponding cmc or minimal surfaces ( _ lawson correspondents _ ) in euclidean 3-space or the @xmath0-sphere .",
    "based on the lawson correspondences , m.  kilian , w.  rossman , n.  schmitt and the third named author @xcite studied cmc surfaces in @xmath1 with @xmath23 via the dpw method . in case @xmath25 ,",
    "the lawson correspondent in @xmath26 is a minimal surface , and r.  bryant @xcite gave the weierstrass type representation in terms of a holomorphic differential equation .    on the other hand , by the maximum principle",
    ", there are no compact cmc surfaces in @xmath1 ( without boundary ) such that @xmath27 . moreover , cmc surfaces in @xmath1 with @xmath28 have neither lawson correspondents in euclidean 3-space @xmath6 nor in the @xmath0-sphere @xmath29 .",
    "this means that cmc surface geometry with @xmath28 in hyperbolic space has special and unusual features and hence it is of interest .",
    "there is another motivation for the study of cmc surfaces with @xmath10 .",
    "d.  chopp and j.  velling @xcite found numerical evidence that @xmath1 can be foliated by cmc discs with @xmath10 that share a common jordan curve boundary in the ideal boundary of @xmath1 .",
    "in contrast to the case @xmath24 , there are relatively few papers on cmc surfaces in @xmath1 with @xmath28",
    ". initial studies on the existence and regularity of cmc surfaces in @xmath1 with @xmath28 can be found in m.  anderson @xcite , k.  uhlenbeck @xcite , k.  polthier @xcite , y.  tonegawa @xcite and j.  velling @xcite .    in @xcite ,",
    "m.  babich and a.  bobenko considered minimal surfaces of finite type in @xmath30 and described them explicitly in terms of theta functions .",
    "one of the remarkable points of the present study is that , as in the already known cases we associate a certain kind of _ gauss map _ to constant mean curvature surfaces in @xmath30 . and the constancy of the mean curvature is equivalent to the harmonicity of the gauss map . thus the ruh - vilms property holds",
    "however , unlike all surface geometries discussed by the dpw method so far , our target space is _ not _ a symmetric space but a real @xmath31-dimensional @xmath17-symmetric space .    in general , the loop group approach can not be applied to harmonic maps into non - symmetric homogeneous spaces .",
    "thus it is not obvious how to apply the loop group method to our case .",
    "more precisely , the loop group method has two main ingredients .",
    "one is a zero curvature representation and the other one is a loop group decomposition .",
    "the zero curvature representation is equivalent with the existence of a flat connections and this representation enables us to use loop groups .",
    "a loop group decomposition is at the heart of the dpw method and recovers surfaces from holomorphic potentials .    in this paper ,",
    "the gauss map of cmc surfaces in @xmath30 has as target space a @xmath17-symmetric space .",
    "thus the dpw method is , a priori , not applicable .",
    "however it turns out that these gauss maps are legendre maps .",
    "in the situation under consideration this suffices to obtain a zero curvature representation for all gauss maps of cmc surfaces in @xmath30 ( and in particular for mean curvature @xmath2 satisfying @xmath22 ) .    applying the dpw method in this setting , we obtain a potential in a @xmath17-graded lie algebra .",
    "however , not every potential in this @xmath17-graded lie algebra will admit the application of the dpw method , since the admissibility condition will not be satisfied in general @xcite .",
    "it is a fortunate accident that the maurer - cartan form of the moving frame of every cmc immersion into @xmath30 with @xmath22 is also contained in same real form of @xmath32 and this is part of some `` symmetric space setting '' ( which actually is not induced from any finite dimensional symmetric space ) .",
    "this enables us to apply the dpw method via standard way and therefore two main featured of the loop group method can be established and the loop group method is applicable .",
    "the reason for the applicability of the dpw method in our case also can be explained by using the lawson correspondence which transforms our original harmonic gauss map into a _ primitive _ map , to which the dpw method is applicable . by the lawson correspondence for a cmc surface with mean curvature @xmath22 in @xmath30 ,",
    "the cmc surface can be considered as a minimal surface in @xmath33 for some @xmath34 , where @xmath33 denotes the hyperbolic @xmath0-space of sectional curvature @xmath35 , @xcite . at this point",
    "it is important to note that the gauss map of a cmc surface in @xmath36 is primitive if and only if the surface is minimal .",
    "finally we recall that primitive maps into @xmath37-symmetric ( @xmath38 ) spaces form a special class of harmonic maps and it is known that the dpw method is applicable to primitive maps @xcite .",
    "moreover , we interpret our original gauss map of a cmc surface in @xmath30 , which is only a legendre harmonic map , as a primitive gauss map of some cmc surface in @xmath36 , and thus the loop group method becomes applicable .",
    "we would like to point out that the dpw method for cmc surfaces in @xmath1 presented in @xcite is based on the lawson correspondence , so the authors of @xcite can treat cmc surfaces in @xmath1 with mean curvature @xmath23 . in the present study , we give a unified approach to both cases : @xmath23 and @xmath39 .",
    "the case @xmath40 has been studied extensively already , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xcite , @xcite , and will not be considered in this paper .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . after establishing the requisite knowledge on harmonic maps into normal semi - riemannian homogeneous spaces and homogeneous geometry of hyperbolic space in sections [ sc :",
    "harmonic][sc : hyperbolic ] , we shall devote sections [ sc : surfacesh3][sc:2by2 ] to surface geometry in @xmath1 in terms of @xmath41-valued functions . in section [ sc : cmch>1 ]",
    ", we shall give a loop group formulation of cmc surfaces with @xmath23 .",
    "this formulation is different from the one used in @xcite .",
    "we shall clarify the lawson correspondences between cmc surfaces in @xmath1 with @xmath23 and cmc surfaces in @xmath6 in terms of loop groups .    in the next section [ sc : cmch<1 ] , we shall give a loop group formulation for cmc surfaces with @xmath28 .",
    "the two cases discussed in section [ sc : cmch>1 ] and section [ sc : cmch<1 ] are distinguished by the automorphism of the kac - moody lie algebra which characterizes the lax equations of corresponding types of cmc surfaces .",
    "the key tool of the present study is a `` contact geometric characterization '' of cmc surfaces .",
    "for every ( oriented ) surface @xmath42 , there exists a smooth map @xmath43 into the unit tangent sphere bundle @xmath44 of @xmath1 .",
    "the map @xmath43 is referred to as the _ gauss map _ of @xmath20 .",
    "one can see that the gauss map @xmath43 of a surface @xmath20 is a legendre map in the sense of v.i .",
    "arnold @xcite , that is , it is tangent to the canonical contact structure .",
    "moreover , the constancy of the mean curvature is equivalent to the harmonicity of that gauss map .",
    "thus the ruh - vilms property holds . in section [ sc:4symunittangent ] , we shall characterize harmonic gauss maps in a way which is different from the ruh - vilms property .",
    "the legendre property of the gauss map will be characterized in terms of @xmath17-symmetric structure of @xmath44 .",
    "these characterizations in terms of contact geometry and @xmath17-symmetric structure yield a zero - curvature representation for legendre harmonic maps . based on these results , in sections [ sc : potential][sc : dpw ]",
    ", we shall give a dpw method for legendre harmonic maps ( and hence for cmc surfaces with @xmath28 ) .",
    "in the final section , we shall exhibit some examples of cmc surfaces with @xmath28 via the dpw method established in this paper .    in the surface geometry of @xmath1 , several notions of _",
    "gauss map _ have been introduced . for the convenience of the reader ,",
    "we collect in the appendix several notions of gauss map that have been used by different authors .",
    "we shall explain how these other gauss maps can be derived from our gauss map . as a side result",
    "we obtain that only the gauss map considered in this paper is suitable for a dpw method of cmc surfaces in @xmath30 .",
