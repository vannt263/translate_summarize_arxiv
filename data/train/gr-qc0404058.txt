    "it is expected that an observer , corresponding to an unruh detector  @xcite coupled to a scalar field , when freely falling in de sitter space , will perceive radiation with a thermal spectrum of the de sitter temperature @xmath0  @xcite , where @xmath1 denotes the hubble parameter .",
    "it is the purpose of this article , to clarify in what sense this result is universal to scalar fields of different couplings to the de sitter background and how the detector apprehends the differences .",
    "let us therefore refine what is meant by the observation of thermal radiation : at first order in perturbation theory , the detector response function is proportional to the fourier transform of the scalar propagator _ w.r.t . _ the proper time of the detector , and it describes how many particles are absorbed and emitted per unit time . when being in equilibrium with the de sitter background , the energy levels of the detector are thermally populated according to the temperature @xmath2 .    the easiest way to derive this is to note that the propagator for nonminimally coupled scalars has in the imaginary direction of its proper time @xmath3 the periodicity @xmath4  @xcite . as we will point out ,",
    "this however does not completely characterize the response function of the detector , which describes the number of particles detected per unit time .",
    "the rate turns out to depend on the scalar mass and on its coupling to the curvature , as was first shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , circumventing the use of the scalar propagator .",
    "the fact that in de sitter space the invariance of the quantum vacuum becomes manifest when the scalar propagator only depends on the proper time seperation along a geodesic has led to the practice of defining the de sitter vacua through this quantity  @xcite .",
    "however , in the case of a massless scalar , which is minimally coupled to the curvature , this leads to a problem since the propagator is infrared divergent  @xcite .",
    "we argue that , when regulated by a cutoff , this divergence gives rise to a contribution which is irrelevant to the total detector response .",
    "in addition , we compare with the response functions of a detector immersed in a thermal bath in minkowski space and discuss the situation in de sitter space - times with dimension other than four .",
    "unruh s detector  @xcite corresponds to a heavy slowly moving particle along a trajectory @xmath5 , which interacts with a scalar bath of particles as @xmath6 where @xmath7 is a coupling constant , @xmath3 is the proper time and @xmath8 represents the quantum operator describing the monopole interaction of the detector with the scalar bath @xmath9 .",
    "since the detector is assumed to be very heavy , it does not fluctuate in space , and hence the only time dependence is in @xmath8 .",
    "the response of unruh s detector can be derived as follows .",
    "one assumes that the state of the detector is specified by a set of energy eigenstates , @xmath10 , and that each absorbtion of a scalar quantum elevates the energy of the detector by @xmath11 ; the converse is true for each emission .",
    "consider now at first order perturbation theory the transition amplitude @xmath12 from a state @xmath13 to a state @xmath14 @xmath15 where @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) is defined such that it does not include stimulated emission . in order to take account of the influence of initial conditions , for simplicity",
    "we assume that the interaction @xmath18 switches on at @xmath19 as @xmath20 , where @xmath21 when @xmath22 , and @xmath23 when @xmath24 .",
    "more generally , one would expect that the interaction switches on adiabatically .",
    "since we are not interested in studying in detail how the response function depends on the initial conditions and on how the interaction turns on , this rough treatment should suffice . upon squaring @xmath12 and making use of orthonormality and completeness of the scalar eigenstates @xmath25 , and taking @xmath26",
    ", we get for the transition probability per unit proper time , @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the response function per unit proper time . here",
    "@xmath29 is the ( positive frequency ) coordinate space wightman function , and we defined the time variables , @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "the expression  ( [ response function ] ) is real by construction , which can be formally shown by taking the complex conjugate of the integrand in  ( [ response function ] ) and then making use of the hermiticity property of the wightman functions , @xmath32^ * = ig^{<,>}(x_2,x_1)$ ] .",
    "we shall study the particle spectrum observed in an appropriate vacuum state @xmath33 , the precise nature of which will be specified later .",
    "it is generally accepted that it is most natural to consider ( a freely - falling ) unruh detector moving on a geodesic , since in this case the detector does not see additional particles due to the unruh effect , which would be present only because of the acceleration of the detector .",
    "a nice property of unruh s detector is the separability of the transition probability  ( [ transition probability ] ) into a product of the selectivity function , which depends on the inner structure of the detector , which is completely specified by the operator @xmath8 and the coupling @xmath7 , and the response function , which depends on the state of the scalar field only .",
    "it appears useful to rewrite eq .",

    "_ the relative coordiante of the wightman function , @xmath35 such that @xmath36 are proper times .",
    "this means that the response function of unruh s detector is completely insensitive to particle momenta ( which is consistent with the assumption that the detector must be very massive ) , and it measures ( absorbs ) scalar particles of all possible momenta @xmath37 ; likewise , it isotropically emits particles of all momenta .",
    "in order to get an insight in how a certain distribution function of a scalar field is perceived by the detector , we consider the response function for the bose - einstein distribution .",
    "the wightman function for a thermally excited scalar field has the well known form  @xcite @xmath38 where @xmath39 denotes the inverse temperature , and @xmath40 the scalar mass .",
    "the response function  ( [ response function:2 ] ) for @xmath41 dimensions in flat space - time is easily calculated , @xmath42 and explicitly , for @xmath43 , one finds @xmath44 hence , the response function of unruh s detector to a scalar thermal state contains , apart from the bose - einstein distribution , an additional factor , which depends on the scalar particle mass and reduces to @xmath45 in the massless limit and @xmath43 .",

    "moreover , they do not in general coincide with the response to an equilibrum state in flat space . a disagreement with the thermal response",
    "does not yet imply that the detector does not equilibrate with the de sitter background .",
    "in fact , the energy levels of the detector are thermally populated .",
    "similar deviations from a minkowski - space thermal response are also known for accelerated detectors  @xcite .",
    "the disagreement of the response functions should be attributed to the fact , that for the conformally and the minimally coupled scalar field the density of modes per frequency is different .",
    "however , for fields which are massive or nonconformally coupled to the metric , the infrared enhancement is a consequence of the amplification of superhorizon modes leading to cosmological density perturbations , an effect which is absent in the conformally coupled massless case .",
    "this makes the different fields clearly distinguishable by observables .",
    "the fact that physically distinct situations such as thermally populated flat space and the different types of de sitter - invariant vacua result in the same thermal distribution function for the energy levels of the detector is due to the insensitivity of this quantity to whether there is a mixed ( thermal ) state or a pure ( de sitter - invariant ) state and to how often the detector responds per unit time . ) . note first that a thermally populated state in static coordinate does not correspond to a usual thermal equilibrium state , since spatial homogeneity is broken .",
    "in addition , the mode functions in the static and the de sitter - invariant vacuum have different support . indeed ,",
    "the static mode functions vanish beyond the de sitter horizon , while the de sitter - invariant mode functions exhibit superhorizon correlations . ]    finally , we want to point out that de sitter invariance of the stress - energy tensor of the conformal vacuum implies that the stress - energy tensor must be proportional to the metric , such that @xmath182  @xcite .",
    "this is inconsistent with a thermal equation of state and leads us to the investigation , whether the energy density is captured at higher orders in perturbation theory  @xcite , allowing for the pair creation operators of the scalar field hamiltonian , which are not captured by the first order perturbation expansion used here .",
    "while we argued in this paper that the thermal state of the detector does not contain the full information about the quantum field , it is yet remarkable , that at first order in perturbation theory the detector is insensitive to the ( regulated ) stress - energy tensor , which is clearly nonthermal .",
