    "recently , there has been a renewed interest in understanding the optical properties of clusters because confinement of electrons changes the physical properties .",
    "thus by varying size of the clusters the optical properties can be tuned according to the desired application@xcite . in particular ,",
    "optical properties of silicon and hydrogenated silicon clusters have been of great interest due to the observation of photo luminescence ( pl ) in porous silicon @xcite . the structure and properties of silicon clusters",
    "can be tuned by varying the cluster size as well as doping .",
    "an important dopant for silicon clusters is hydrogen and it plays an important role in structural stability .",
    "experimental studies also confirm this fact@xcite , but in spite of several investigations many issues about hydrogenated silicon clusters have not been understood .",
    "it is not clear how the structure and optical properties of the cluster evolves with size and as a function of hydrogenation .",
    "it is therefore interesting to calculate the photo - absorption ( pa ) spectra and compare it with experiment .",
    "there has been a considerable amount of work experimental as well as theoretical on silicon and hydrogenated silicon clusters .",

    "lehtonen and sundholm calculated the absorption spectra of three hydrogen terminated silicon clusters using tddft@xcite .    the earlier studies on the optical properties of silicon and hydrogenated silicon clusters focused on the size dependence of the pl and photo - absorption @xcite .",
    "some of these studies ignored the influence of oscillator strength s ( electric dipole matrix elements ) and hence were not in good agreement with the experimental data .",
    "calculations based on dft using lda and the generalised gradient approximation ( gga ) which included the dipole matrix elements suffered from the drawback that is inherent in lda / gga i.e. the energy gaps were underestimated because these calculations ignored the effect of excited states . to overcome this drawback , the configuration interaction method or the methods based on solving the bethe - salpeter equation along with the gw approximation have been suggested@xcite .",
    "these methods require a lot of computer time and hence have been restricted to small clusters .",
    "a computational technique based on linear response theory within tdlda had been proposed by vasiliev et .",
    "this is a natural extension of the lda ground state density functional formulation designed to include excited states .",
    "this method is faster than the bs and gw methods and can therefore be used for larger clusters .",
    "vasiliev et .",
    "al . have shown the viability of their method by performing calculations on silicon and hydrogenated and oxygenated silicon clusters .",
    "another implementation of tddft has been formulated by castro et .",
    "al . which allows the calculation of the excited state energies and optical absorption spectra . in the present work",
    ", we have used this method@xcite .",
    "most of earlier calculations have considered only hydrogen terminated silicon clusters .",
    "there seems to be a lack of a systematic study on small hydrogenated silicon clusters . in this paper",
    "we report calculations for the silicon and hydrogenated silicon clusters in addition to some hydrogen terminated silicon clusters .",
    "thus our calculations will show the effect of hydrogenation on the optical properties of silicon clusters .",
    "our emphasis is on the smaller clusters so as to bring out the evolution of the optical properties as we increase the number of silicon and hydrogen atoms in the cluster .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in section",
    "ii , we briefly discuss the method and give computational details . in section",
    "iii we present our results and discussion . in section",
    "iv we present our conclusions .",
    "we have used tddft for our calculation of the photo - absorption spectrum@xcite . for the sake of completeness we shall summarise the essentials of the method . in tddft ,",
    "the basic variable is the one electron density @xmath7 , which is obtained with the help of a fictitious system of non - interacting electrons , the kohn - sham system .",
    "the time - dependent kohn - sham equations are @xmath8\\psi_{i}(\\mathbf{r},t)\\ ] ] where @xmath9 are kohn - sham one electron orbitals . in terms",
    "these orbitals @xmath7 can be written as @xmath10 the kohn - sham potential can be written as @xmath11 where the first term is the external potential , the second hartree potential and the last the exchange and correlation potential . for obtaining this potential",
    "we use adiabatic local density approximation ( alda ) .    in our work",
    "we shall use the tddft scheme which calculates propagation of the time - dependent kohn - sham equations in real time . in this scheme",
    "the electrons are given some small momentum(@xmath12 ) to excite all the frequencies@xcite .",
    "this is achieved by transforming the ground state wave function according to @xmath13 and then propagating these wave functions for some finite time .",
    "the spectrum is then obtained from dipole strength function @xmath14 @xmath15 where the @xmath16is the dynamical polarizability and is given by @xmath17\\ ] ] where @xmath18 is dipole moment of the system .",
    "we can also define a quantity know as the oscillator strength to express the strength of the transition .",
    "@xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the ground and excited state respectively .",
    "the oscillator strength is related to the dipole strength function defined earlier using the following relationship @xmath22 the sum over the oscillator strength gives the number off active electrons in the system , @xmath23 where _ n _ is the number of active electrons in the system .",
    "the initial structures of the clusters used for our calculations have been obtained by balamurugan and prasad@xcite earlier from their analysis based on the car - parrinello molecular dynamics ( cpmd ) @xcite .",
    "the resulting structures have been further optimised using the electronic structure method implemented in vasp _",
    "( vienna ab - initio simulation package_)@xcite .",
    "we do not find any significant changes in the structures compared to the cpmd results .",
    "in fact the starting cpmd configuration gives forces that are around 0.5 ev /   which eventually reduce to around 0.05 ev /   in vasp .",
    "vasp employs density functional theory ( dft ) and we have employed the local density approximation ( lda ) for the exchange correlation using norm conserving pseudo - potentials .",
    "the optimisation is done only by relaxing the ions via the conjugate gradient ( cg ) method and using a k - point monkhorst - pack mesh of 4x4x4 .",
    "all calculations have been performed in a cubic supercell of length 20  .    in this work",
    "the photo - absorption spectra of the optimised structures was studied using octopus code @xcite where the above approach is implemented .",
    "all calculations are expanded in a regular mesh in real space , and the simulations are performed in real time .",
    "the local density approximation was employed to keep consistency with the geometry optimisation process .",
    "octopus uses a uniform grid in real space , which is located inside the sum of n spheres , one around each atom of the n - atom cluster . for all clusters",
    "a minimisation of energy with respect to the radius and the grid spacing was carried out .",
    "we required the radius of each sphere to be 6 - 8   and the grid spacing 0.28 - 0.4   for optimal energy minimisation .    for the tddft",
    "the propagation in real time has been performed with 30,000 time steps with a total simulation time of around 124 fs .",
    "this gives a good resolution of the spectra . throughout the calculations",
    "the ions were kept static and in order to approximate the evolution operator the approximated enforced time reversal symmetry ( aetrs ) method was employed .",
    "numerically the exponential of the hamiltonian , which is used to approximate the evolution operator was evaluated using a simple taylor expansion of the exponential .",
