    "nucleons themselves are complex systems of quarks and gluons .",
    "when strongly interacting hadronic matter is heated beyond a critical temperature @xmath0 gev , one expects the compounds to dissolve and the hadron phase turns into a phase of liberated quarks and gluons .",

    "matter can then presumably exist in color superconducting ( csc ) phases . understanding the mechanisms which govern the transition from  normal \" nuclear or neutron matter to such extreme baryonic densities is a further fundamental challenge .",
    "this year s yukawa centennial has inspired retrospectives into the historical origins of nuclear physics .",
    "yukawa s pioneering work of 1935 @xcite laid the foundations for our understanding of the strong force between nucleons .",
    "twenty years later an impressively coherent series of articles appeared : the collected papers on meson theory @xcite .",
    "these reviews from half a century ago read , still today , remarkably modern in their conceptual drive towards a systematic approach to the nucleon - nucleon interaction .",
    "a cornerstone of these developments was the visionary design by taketani et al .",
    "@xcite of the inward - bound hierarchy of scales governing the @xmath2 interaction ( see fig.[fig:2 ] ) .",
    "the long range region i is determined by one - pion exchange .",
    "it continues inward to the intermediate distance region ii dominated by two - pion exchange .",
    "the basic idea is to construct the @xmath2 potential in these regions by @xmath3 calculation of @xmath4 @xmath5 and @xmath6 exchange processes .",
    "the detailed behaviour of the interaction in the short distance region iii remains unresolved at the low - energy scales characteristic of nuclear physics .",
    "this short distance part is given a suitably parametrized form and fixed by comparison with scattering data .",

    "qcd can be handled with controlled approximations in two limiting situations : the limit of high energies and momenta ( q @xmath7 gev ) or ultrashort distances ( r @xmath8 fm ) in which qcd is a theory of weakly interacting quarks and gluons ; and the limit of low energies and momenta ( q @xmath9 gev ) or long distances ( r @xmath10 fm ) in which qcd is realized in the form of an effective field theory of weakly interacting nambu - goldstone bosons associated with the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry .",
    "the vast area between these limits is becoming progressively accessible through lattice qcd , large - scale numerical simulations on discretised euclidean space - time using the most powerful computers available .",
    "low - energy qcd deals with systems of light quarks at energies and momenta smaller than the characteristic scale for spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking , @xmath11 gev ( with @xmath12 gev the pion decay constant ) .",
    "the mass gap in the spectrum of the lightest hadrons is a visible manifestation of this scale .",
    "it offers a natural separation between _ light _ and _ heavy _ ( or , correspondingly , _ fast _ and _ slow _ ) degrees of freedom .",
    "the basic idea of an effective field theory is to introduce the light species as active degrees of freedom , while the heavy particles are treated as ( almost ) static sources . in qcd , confinement and spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking imply that the _ light _ degrees of freedom at low energy are color singlet , pseudoscalar nambu - goldstone bosons , identified with the pions for @xmath13 quark flavors , and massless in the limit of vanishing quark masses .",
    "their dynamics is described by an effective lagrangian which incorporates all relevant symmetries of the underlying fundamental theory .",
    "explicit chiral symmetry breaking by the small @xmath14 and @xmath15 quark masses shifts the pion mass to its physical value , @xmath16 gev , one of the _ small _ scales governing nuclear physics .",
    "the chiral symmetry breaking scenario of low - energy qcd is a basic starting point for today s approaches to nuclear few- and many - body systems .",
    "apart from the identification of yukawa s pion as an isospin triplet of nambu - goldstone bosons , this scenario is characterised by the existence of a strong condensate @xmath17 of scalar quark - antiquark pairs ( the chiral condensate ) in the qcd ground state ( the highly non - trivial _ vacuum _ ) . but is this symmetry breaking scenario unambiguously confirmed ?",
    "several recent measurements and observations do indeed give a positive answer to this question .",
    "detailed chiral perturbation theory calculations @xcite of low - energy @xmath18 scattering phase shifts have been performed and compared with those extracted from the final state analysis of @xmath19 decays .",
    "these results support the `` strong condensate '' scenario of spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking in qcd .",
    "it is linked to an important current algebra ( pcac ) relation that establishes a leading proportionality between the squared pion mass and the quark mass , @xmath20 , the slope being determined by the ratio @xmath21 .",
    "this relationship is also confirmed by lattice qcd results ( unexpectedly even up to quite large quark masses , a feature that is not yet well understood ) .",

    "the first preliminary results are promising and subject to further detailed analysis .",
    "3.1  _ nn interaction from lattice qcd_. recent lattice studies of the nucleon - nucleon force @xcite are beginning to draw a qcd based picture of the @xmath2 potential .",
    "these computations first generate the wave function @xmath22 of two nucleons at a distance @xmath23 on the lattice .",
    "the central potential is then reconstructed from the schrdinger equation as @xmath24 .",
    "the resulting @xmath25 , shown in fig.[fig:3 ] , displays indeed the known qualitative features of the @xmath2 interaction : a short - range repulsive core followed by attraction at intermediate and long distances , with a splitting into singlet ( @xmath26 ) and triplet ( @xmath27 ) channels .",
    "this is evidently not yet a realistic potential since the result is obtained in quenched qcd and the quark masses used are still too large , equivalent to pion masses several times the physical @xmath28 .",
    "but it is the promising starting point of a development which provides , in particular , a foundation in qcd for the repulsive short - distance dynamics of the @xmath2 force .",
    "3.2  _ nuclear interactions from chiral effective field theory_. the separation of scales characteristic of chiral effective field theory defines a systematic hierarchy of contributions to the nucleon - nucleon interaction and nuclear three - body forces , driven by pions as nambu - goldstone bosons .",
    "the emerging series is organised in powers of the small quantity @xmath29 , where @xmath30 stands generically for low energy or momentum and @xmath31 is the spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking scale of order 1 gev .",
    "the familiar one - pion exchange interaction comes at leading order . at next - to - leading order , @xmath32 , a first set of two - pion exchange mechanisms enters together with contact terms encoding unresolved short distance dynamics . at the next higher order ( @xmath33 ) ,",
    "more two - pion exchange processes are turned on , in particular those involving the strong spin - isospin polarizablity of the nucleon as it is manifest in the @xmath34 transition that dominates @xmath35-wave pion - nucleon scattering . at that same order",
    "three - body interactions have their entry in a well defined book - keeping scheme .    with a few constants fixed by comparison with @xmath2 and three - nucleon data ,",

    "this implies that at the densities of interest in nuclear physics , @xmath45 @xmath46 , pions @xmath47 be treated as @xmath3 degrees of freedom in any meaningful description of the nuclear many - body problem . the strong pion - exchange tensor force and , in particular ,",
    "two - pion exchange processes involving intermediate spin - isospin ( @xmath48 ) excitations , play a leading role at the distance scales characteristic of the nuclear bulk .",
    "although these basic principles were known for many decades , it took an astonishingly long time in nuclear many - body theory until chiral two - pion exchange dynamics was taken seriously - rather than just being parametrised in terms of ( @xmath49 and @xmath38 ) boson exchange phenomenology .",
    "in - medium chiral perturbation theory has emerged as a successful framework for low - energy pion - nucleon dynamics in the presence of a filled fermi sea of nucleons .",
    "one- and two - pion exchange processes , treated explicitly , govern the long - range interactions at distance scales @xmath50 relevant to the nuclear many - body problem .",
    "short - range mechanisms , with spectral functions involving masses far beyond those of two pions , are not resolved in detail at nuclear fermi momentum scales and can be subsumed in contact interactions and derivatives thereof .",
    "this _ separation of scales _ argument makes strategies of chiral effective field theory work also for nuclear problems , with the _ small _ scales ( @xmath51 ) distinct from the _ large _ ones ( @xmath52 ) .",
    "in essence , this is the modern realisation of taketani s programme mentioned earlier .",
    "closely related renormalisation group considerations have motivated the construction of a universal low - momentum @xmath2 interaction v(@xmath53 ) @xcite from phase shift equivalent @xmath2 potentials such that the ambiguities associated with unresolved short - distance parts disappear .",
    "the prominent pieces of the @xmath6 exchange interaction involve the second order tensor force and intermediate @xmath36 states .",
    "the latter produces a van der waals - like @xmath2 interaction which behaves , at long and intermediate distances , as @xmath54 times a polynomial in @xmath55 .",
    "it does then perhaps not come as a surprise that the resulting nuclear matter equation of state @xcite , see fig.[fig:6 ] , is qualitatively reminiscent of a van der waals equation of state .",
    "the nuclear liquid turns into a gas at a calculated critical temperature @xmath40 mev , quite close to the commonly accepted empirical range @xmath56 mev .",
    "4.3  _ towards heavy nuclei and beyond_. a successful strategy for approaching finite nuclei over a broad range , from @xmath57 to the very heavy ones , starts from a universal ( relativistic ) energy density functional guided by nuclear matter calculations .",
    "the basic idea is to construct the exchange correlation part of this functional from in - medium chiral perturbation theory , with contact ( mean field ) terms added . in this approach",
    "binding and saturation , for nuclear matter as well as finite nuclei , are driven primarily by attractive two - pion exchange mechanisms in combination with repulsive pauli principle effects .",
    "emprical properties of nuclei ( binding energies , charge radii etc . ) are reproduced throughout the nuclear chart @xcite , typically within 0.5% .",
    "this is a level of precision comparable to the best phenomenological mean field calculations , but now with constraints imposed by known principles of low - energy qcd .            of particular interest in this context",
    "is the observed systematics of nuclear properties through isotopic chains .",
    "this presumably reflects the isospin dependence of the underlying interactions governed by pions as chiral isovector goldstone bosons . as a representative example , fig.[fig:7 ] shows calculated ground state deformations for several series of isotopes in comparison with experimental data .",
    "these results give some confidence that extrapolations into unknown territory of extreme nuclear isospins may be well guided by principles of chiral dynamics .",
    "such extrapolations are required when addressing questions of astrophysical interest ( nucleogenesis and r - process ) .",
    "complementary approaches to finite nuclei , such as the unitary correlation operator method ( ucom)@xcite , use different techniques but come to similar conclusions as to the importance of the tensor force .",
    "the ucom starts from a correlated many - body state @xmath58|\\phi\\rangle$ ] .",
    "tensor correlations figure prominently in the correlation operator @xmath59 . with long range correlations added perturbatively to a hartree - fock calculation , results such as the one shown in fig.[fig:8 ] are achieved .",
    "4.4  _ short - range correlations_. investigations of short - range @xmath2 correlations in nuclei have a long history , with mixed conclusions drawn over past decades .",
    "recent theoretical work has focused again on the high momentum components ( @xmath60 ) in nuclear wave functions induced by strong tensor correlations @xcite .",
    "major progress is now reported from dedicated experiments such as e01 - 015 at jefferson lab , designed to measure differences in correlations between proton - proton and proton - neutron pairs . given the prominent role of the isovector @xmath61 exchange tensor interaction in the isospin @xmath62 @xmath2 channel , one expects strong short - distance correlations for @xmath63 pairs und much weaker ones for @xmath64 pairs .",
    "this effect is now clearly observed in the ratio of differential cross sections , @xmath65 on @xmath66 measured at missing momenta between 0.3 and 0.6 gev / c @xcite .",
    "4.5  _ the third flavor dimension .",
    "_ adding strange quarks opens up a whole new chart of hypernuclear systems .",
    "the physics of @xmath67-hypernuclei is a well established branch of science . nevertheless , a still persisting key issue is the weakness of the @xmath67-nuclear spin - orbit interaction @xcite in comparison with the much stronger @xmath68 force encountered in ordinary nuclei .",
    "hypernuclear research will experience its next boost at the j - parc facility .",
    "another fundamental question concerns the possible existence of quasibound antikaon - nuclear composites , given that the @xmath69 interaction close to threshold is known to be strongly attractive . however , the present data situation is unclear , and the predictive power of theoretical estimates is so far quite limited .",
    "the search goes on .",
    "this is another important case for the upcoming experimental program at j - parc .",
    "with its three valence quarks and an indefinite number of quark - antiquark pairs , all imbedded in strong gluon fields , the nucleon is the prototype system which exhibits all of the striking phenomena of low - energy qcd : notably confinement , spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking and its connection with the non - trivial structure of the vacuum .",
    "a key question concerns the origin of the nucleon mass : how do almost massless @xmath14 and @xmath15 quarks and massless gluons cooperate dynamically to form a localised baryonic compound with a mass of almost 1 gev ?",
    "an equally fundamental issue is the origin of the nucleon spin : how is the total angular momentum of the nucleon in its rest frame distributed between its quarks and gluons , and in turn between their spin and orbital angular momentum ?    5.1  _ the nucleon mass_. almost all of the mass of the visible universe is determined by the mass of the sum of the masses of nucleons in the cosmos .",
    "the gluonic energy density in the presence of three localised valence quarks obviously plays a decisive role in generating the nucleon mass .",
    "lattice qcd has progressed to the point that it can give reliable results concerning this issue , but with input quark masses still typically an order of magnitude larger than the actual current quark masses entering the qcd lagrangian .",
    "chiral effective field theory offers a systematic way to interpolate between lattice results and the physically relevant range of quark masses . combining chiral perturbation theory with lattice qcd",
    "has thus become a widely used routine in recent years .",
    "an example for the nucleon mass @xcite is shown in fig.[fig:9 ] .",
    "uncertainties are still sizable , given that the gap between the lowest equivalent pion masses ( about 500 mev ) used in lattice simulations and the actual physical pion mass is still large .",
    "but as lattice qcd advances towards pion masses comparable to about twice the physical one , chiral perturbation theory begins to be a quantitatively reliable tool in conducting extrapolations down to the physical point .",
    "spin structure_. the present standards in disentangling the quark and gluon contributions to the nucleon spin , @xmath70 , are set by the hermes @xcite and compass @xcite experiments .",
    "only about one third of the nucleon s spin is carried by its quark constituents @xcite , i.e. @xmath71 .",
    "it appears now that the gluon contribution @xmath72 to the nucleon spin is small @xcite .",
    "if this is confirmed with sufficiently high precision , it raises the interesting next question , namely about the contribution @xmath73 from quark orbital angular momenta .",
    "first lattice qcd results on moments of generalised parton distributions @xcite indicate that the orbital pieces from @xmath14 and @xmath15 quarks come with opposite signs and roughly cancel to give @xmath74 .",
    "so the nucleon spin puzzle still persists .",
    "measured with polarisation transfer @xmath75 @xcite.,width=245 ]     measured with polarisation transfer @xmath75 @xcite.,width=245 ]    5.3  _ form factors_. a further surprise came with the measurement of the ratio of proton electric and magnetic form factors , @xmath76 , in a polarisation transfer experiment ( @xmath75 ) at jlab @xcite .",
    "this ratio , normalised to unity at @xmath77 , falls linearly with increasing @xmath78 , down to 0.5 at about 0.4 gev@xmath79 , a behaviour not expected from the previous time - honoured rosenbluth analysis . a good part of this apparent discrepancy is now understood in terms of two - photon exchange corrections which affect the rosenbluth analysis much more than the polarisation transfer data . at very low @xmath78",
    "there may well be room for more surprises . in a re - analysis of the existing data base of electromagnetic nucleon form factors ,",
    "a systematic irregularity was pointed out @xcite which had hitherto not been recognised . a dedicated low-@xmath78 search performed at jlab @xcite",
    "gives further hints of such fluctuations ( see fig.[fig:10 ] ) which are being discussed in terms of the pion cloud , the `` soft '' surface of the nucleon , but so far with no definitive conclusion .",
    "the ( chiral ) symmetry breaking scenario of qcd suggests that hadron masses vary with changing thermodynamic conditions .",
    "the mass gap seen in the spectrum of the lightest hadrons , which separates the non - trivial vacuum and its nambu - goldstone boson sector from all other hadronic excitations , is expected to depend on temperature @xmath39 and baryon density @xmath38 .",
    "this presumably reflects the @xmath39 and @xmath38 dependence of the qcd condensates , and in particular , of the chiral condensate @xmath80 . exploring changes of hadron properties , both in a ",
    "normal \" nuclear environment and in hadronic matter under more extreme conditions of temperature and density , is thus a persistingly relevant theme .",
    "nucleons are well known to experience such changes in nuclei .",
    "their effective _ in - medium _ mass is considerably lower than the one in free space .",
    "their magnetic moments and weak decay matrix elements are significantly renormalised in a nuclear environment .",
    "the question is then whether mesonic excitations of the qcd vacuum and their spectra also show characteristic dependences on temperature and density .    6.1  _ nambu - goldstone bosons in matter_. by its goldstone boson nature",
    ", the pion has its charge - averaged mass protected against in - medium changes .",
    "the pion decay constant @xmath81 , on the other hand , varies approximately like the square root of the chiral condensate as it changes with increasing nuclear density .",
    "detailed analysis of s - wave pion - nuclear interactions @xcite in comparison with precision measurements of deeply bound states of pionic atoms @xcite and highly accurate data from low - energy @xmath82 and @xmath83 scattering on a series of nuclei @xcite consistently display a systematics that can indeed be interpreted as showing the fingerprints of a decreasing chiral order parameter with increasing nuclear density .    6.2  _ vector mesons in matter_. vector mesons such as the @xmath38 and the @xmath84 are the lightest dipole - like quark - antiquark excitations of the qcd vacuum .",
    "current algebra had established long ago a leading proportionality between the @xmath38 mass in vacuum and the pion decay constant , @xmath85 , reflecting the relationship to the scale for spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "the gliding of that scale with temperature on the way towards chiral restoration should then be observable through moments of the in - medium @xmath38 meson spectral function .",
    "this is the working hypothesis guided by a simple scaling argument ( br scaling @xcite ) which has motivated this area of research ever since .",
    "where do we stand now ?",
    "the na60 experiment at cern has made tremendous progress in sharpening observations of a low - mass enhancement of spectral strength in muon pair yields from high - energy nuclear collisions .",
    "the space - time averaged in - medium @xmath38 spectral distribution deduced from these measurements @xcite ( see fig.[fig:11 ] ) is consistent with the theoretically expected strong broadening of that spectral function .",
    "however , the conclusion also drawn in @xcite , namely that the @xmath38 meson does not show any noticeable shift in mass , should be taken with caution : once a spectral distribution experiences a significant broadening , the notion of _ mass _ can only be given a meaning in terms of the first moment of that distribution . a detailed analysis along these lines must still be performed before definite statements can be made .",
    "invariant mass spectrum for photoproduction on nb ( solid ) and lh@xmath86 ( dashed ) .",

    "7.1  _ matter produced at rhic_. the hot and dense matter produced and investigated by the rhic experiments ( phenix , star , phobos , brahms ; see reviews and refs . in @xcite ) has displayed a number of quite surprising properties .",
    "three cornerstones of information drawn from these measurements are : i ) transverse energy distributions of produced particles at mid - rapidity ; ii ) jet quenching ; iii ) eliptic flow of different hadrons and its successful description using hydrodynamics .",
    "these results consistently lead to the conclusion that the hot matter produced has enormous initial energy densities of @xmath89 gev@xmath90@xmath91 , well above the energy density expected at the deconfinement transition .",
    "it behaves like strongly coupled quark - gluon matter , opaque to particles carrying color . and it resembles a nearly perfect fluid with extremely low viscosity .",
    "all these features have been quite unexpected and differ substantially from the previously envisaged picture of a  simple \" quark - gluon plasma .",
    "further suprises include extremely fast equilibration , and the fact that for the chemical freeze - out , i.e. the formation of the hadronic species along with the expansion and cooling of the initially hot matter , a thermal ( grand canonical ) description of hadron yields works very well @xcite .",
    "such an analysis using the simplest hadron gas model suggests an  empirical \" freeze - out temperature of about @xmath92 mev at zero chemical potential .",
    "recent lattice qcd results @xcite indicate a range of crossover temperatures @xmath93 which tend to be somewhat higher .",
    "the dispute about possible systematic uncertainties ( finite volume corrections etc . ) is still ongoing .",
    "all these phenomena and their possible relationship to the qcd phase diagram now require a more detailed understanding .",
    "the experimental and theoretical focus is on correlations and transport properties in the produced quark - gluon medium : diffusion constants , conductivities , viscosities , susceptibilties .",
    "and we are looking forward to further breakthroughs once the heavy - ion program at lhc will be running .    7.2  _ neutron stars . _",
    "matter under extreme conditions has its second frontier in the low - temperature , high - density domain which is realized in the core of neutron stars .",
    "various models were proposed in order to extrapolate baryonic equations of state up to several times the density of normal nuclear matter , the range of densities relevant to neutron star interiors @xcite .",
    "realistic many - body calculations of neutron star matter in terms of standard nucleonic and mesonic degrees of freedom , with the proton fraction determined by beta equilibrium , lead to relatively stiff equations of state .",
    "phenomenological models with scenarios involving hyperons , pion or kaon condensates , or more exotic forms of quark matter , commonly generate equations of state that are substantially softer under gravitational pressure and therefore place rather low upper bounds on neutron star masses .",
    "the most accurate determinations of neutron star masses come from observations of double neutron star binaries , with average masses in a narrow range around the canonical @xmath94 ( solar mass units ) .",
    "it can not not be excluded that the specific evolutionary circumstances leading to double neutron star systems favor such a narrow band of masses .",
    "further significant developments are reported from observations of binaries with a neutron star accompanied by a white dwarf companion .",
    "such systems show a wider spread of masses , though with individually larger error bars attached ( see the compilation in @xcite ) .",
    "there is presently a lively discussion about the possible existence of neutron stars with masses as large as @xmath95 .",
    "this would eliminate a whole class of more exotic , soft equations of state .",
    "however , caution must be exercised in view of still existing uncertainties .",
    "continued investigations , reducing the observational errors , are necessary to clarify the situation .",
    "we close this guided tour through various parts of the qcd phase diagram , the area of research that we identify as contemporary nuclear physics , with high expectations that many of the open issues mentioned in this brief report will be resolved or at least further clarified at the new and upcoming facilities ( riken , mami - c , jlab , j - parc , fair , lhc , ... ) ."
