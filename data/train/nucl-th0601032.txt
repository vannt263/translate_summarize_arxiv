    "<S> we study dynamical mass generation in pure yang - mills theory and report on a recently developed ansatz that exactly solves the tower of dyson - schwinger equations in landau gauge at low euclidean momentum , featuring enhanced gluon - gluon vertices , a finite ghost - gluon vertex in agreement with an old argument of taylor , and an ir suppressed gluon propagator . </S>",
    "<S> this ansatz reinforces arguments in favor of the concept of a gluon mass gap at low momentum ( although the minimum of the gluon s dispersion relation is not at zero momentum ) . as an application , </S>",
    "<S> we have computed the spectrum of oddballs , three - gluon glueballs with negative parity and c - parity . </S>",
    "<S> the three body problem is variationally solved employing the color density - density interaction of coulomb gauge qcd with a static cornell potential . like their even glueball counterparts , </S>",
    "<S> oddballs fall on regge trajectories with similar slope to the pomeron . </S>",
    "<S> however their intercept at @xmath0 is smaller than the @xmath1 regge trajectory and therefore the odderon may only be visible in experimental searches ( for example at bnl ) with higher @xmath2 than conducted to date at desy .    in a free yang - mills theory gauge boson mass terms </S>",
    "<S> break gauge invariance and can not be part of the lagrangian . moreover , </S>",
    "<S> if self - interactions are incorporated perturbatively , to any finite order in perturbation theory the radiative corrections do not generate mass terms . </S>",
    "<S> however non - perturbative effects can potentially provide dynamical suppression of the gauge boson propagator via a dressing function @xmath3 if this function @xmath4 is proportional to @xmath5 in the limit @xmath6 then the complete propagator behaves as that of a yukawa exchange of finite mass . </S>",
    "<S> this behavior was conjectured by cornwall @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> dynamical suppression in gluodynamics , unlike the electroweak lagrangian , is not facilitated by coupling to an external anderson - higgs field , but can only be an intrinsic phenomenon due to the non - linearity and strength of the self - coupling .    </S>",
    "<S> the fact that the positions of resonances in the hadron spectrum seem to follow a discrete pattern is a clear indication that the gluon degrees of freedom entail a mass gap of order 800 mev .    </S>",
    "<S> this has been previously incorporated in phenomenological models using a constituent gluon mass @xcite , a waveguide cut - off frequency such as the bag model @xcite , or a quantum string excitation in the flux tube model @xcite .    in the last years </S>",
    "<S> the suppression of the gluon propagator has been put on firm theoretical footing in the framework of the yang - mills dyson - schwinger equations @xcite , and has also received support from numerical lattice calculations @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the studies in @xcite , employing sophisticated anstze for the interaction vertices were able to provide analytical and numerical solutions for the infrared behavior of the yang - mills ghost and gluon propagators . </S>",
    "<S> the novelty was that the dressing function for the gluon propagator in landau gauge was more suppressed than @xmath5 , leading to an infinite gluon mass at zero momentum . </S>",
    "<S> conversely , the dressing function for the ghost propagator turned out to be infrared singular instead of suppressed . in terms of a real constant @xmath7 ( the calculation of @xcite yields 0.596 ) </S>",
    "<S> , they read @xmath8 in @xcite further progress has been made by observing that one can make a self - consistent ansatz that simultaneously solves all of the yang - mills wave equations in the far infrared . </S>",
    "<S> the result for the dressing of the green s function with @xmath9 gluon legs and @xmath10 ghost legs , @xmath11 $ ] , is @xmath12(p^2 )   =   { \\rm ct}\\cdot ( p^2)^{(n - m)\\kappa }   \\ .\\ ] ] by `` dressing '' we understand that the canonical dimension of the green s function is still multiplying the result , and by `` all '' that all the momenta entering the scattering amplitude need to tend to zero simultaneously . </S>",
    "<S> a proof employing the skeleton expansion has been given in @xcite and @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to the aforementioned gluon suppression and ghost enhancement , one finds from eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ result ] ) that the ghost - gluon vertex @xmath13 is ir finite in agreement with an argument of taylor @xcite and that the three and four - gluon vertices are enhanced by @xmath14 and @xmath15 dressings respectively . </S>",
    "<S> these relations between the dressings force cancellations such that all the effective charges defined from the primitively divergent vertices in the lagrangian are finite in the ir , and @xmath16 presents an ir fixed point , which theoretically supports approaches based on conformal theory @xcite and is compatible with analytical perturbation theory @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the demonstration that eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ result ] ) indeed solves the tower of dse s has been given in terms of the skeleton expansion . </S>",
    "<S> here we give an argument that is independent of this expansion , sidestepping convergence issues .    </S>",
    "<S> we will examine in turn all the contributions to the rhs of the dyson schwinger equation for @xmath11 $ ] , assume eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ result ] ) for the coupled - channel green s functions appearing there , and show that the leading ir divergence yields again our counting rule eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ result ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> there are several formulations of the dyson - schwinger equations , we employ a very intuitive one based on a complete resummation of the perturbative series ( without the intermediate skeleton expansion ) , that can conceivably be generalized by analytical continuation , and one should remember that the dse s can be directly formulated as identities in the path - integral formalism </S>",
    "<S> .    we will draw a box for the green s function with @xmath9 gluon and @xmath17 ghost legs labeled by the indices @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> its dse reads @xmath19    the tree - level diagrams are the lowest order in perturbation theory and have their canonical dimension . </S>",
    "<S> all others involve loop integrals and can feature an anomalous infrared exponent . </S>",
    "<S> diagrams of type ( 2a ) have at least one external gluon leg coupled to a vertex that is not attached to any other external leg . </S>",
    "<S> these diagrams can be resummed to all orders to one of the three following classes ( we write below the corresponding infrared exponents ) . </S>",
    "<S> all propagators are understood as fully dressed and carrying their dimensions given by eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ propagators ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> @xmath20    the ghost - triangle type diagram on the left is the ir - dominant and yields the behavior of the @xmath11 $ ] function in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ dse ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> diagrams marked ( 2b ) ( see sketch below , left diagram ) arise due to the four - gluon coupling , that allows two external gluon legs linked together . </S>",
    "<S> finally we have diagrams of type ( 3 ) , that we define as those with no external gluon legs ( @xmath21 ) that require separate treatment . </S>",
    "<S> these are the only loop diagrams in the dyson - schwinger equations for multighost scattering kernels . </S>",
    "<S> since there is only one bare ghost - gluon vertex in the lagrangian these can all be resummed to the diagram on the right ( that is leading and again yields our ir counting ) : </S>",
    "<S> @xmath22    this exhausts the possible types of proper diagrams that can be resummed from the perturbative yang - mills series .    </S>",
    "<S> once we have established that the ansatz eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ result ] ) is a valid solution of the dyson - schwinger equations in landau gauge , we turn to phenomenological applications . </S>",
    "<S> these are based in the sister coulomb gauge , also transverse but with a hamiltonian formulated at equal time . </S>",
    "<S> the obvious phenomenological consequence of the gluon mass gap is that hybrid mesons ( @xmath23 ) , glueballs , and other states whose leading wavefunction in fock space involve constituent glue , will be rather massive , in agreement with estimates in lattice gauge theory @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we complement lattice studies in that our semianalytical methods in the continuum can readily be used to study higher spin states , not easily accessible in the lattice . since glueballs do not have exotic quantum numbers they are the most difficult unconventional states to be disentangled from the meson spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> however they leave some trace in regge phenomenology . </S>",
    "<S> there is no doubt among theorists that regge behavior is present in qcd , but the bfkl , bkp equations are valid only for @xmath24 , whereas the experimental evidence so far has been gathered at small or zero @xmath2 ( mostly in the form of total cross sections ) , therefore non - perturbative approaches are necessary to study regge trajectories at low @xmath25 . the time - honored approach to obtain the intercept of a regge trajectory at @xmath26 has been to study the resonances on the positive @xmath27 quadrant of a chew - frautschi plot .    </S>",
    "<S> we address these states by means of a model hamiltonian employing the coulomb gauge formulation and fields , where the kernel is approximated by a charge - density to charge - density interaction with a cornell potential . in a first approximation one </S>",
    "<S> neglects ( suppressed ) transverse gluon exchange , that can later be incorporated in perturbation theory ( a model computation along these lines is available @xcite ) . in the gluon sector </S>",
    "<S> this effective qcd hamiltonian is @xmath28   \\nonumber \\\\ & - & \\frac { 1 } { 2 }   \\int d { \\bf x } d { \\bf y}\\thinspace \\rho^a_g({\\bf x } ) v({\\bf x},{\\bf y } )   \\rho^a_g({\\bf y } ) \\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with color charge density @xmath29 , gauge fields @xmath30 , conjugate momenta @xmath31 and abelian components @xmath32 , for @xmath33 . </S>",
    "<S> the fourier transform to momentum space yields @xmath34 e^{i{\\bf{q}}\\cdot { \\bf { x } } } \\ , \\ \\ \\ \\\\   { \\bm \\pi^a}({\\bf{x } } ) & = & -i \\int \\frac{d{\\bf{q}}}{(2\\pi)^3 } \\sqrt{\\frac{\\omega_k}{2 } } [ { \\bf a}^a({\\bf{q}})-{\\bf a}^{a\\dag}(-{\\bf{q}})]e^{i{\\bf{q}}\\cdot { \\bf{x } } }   , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] satisfying the coulomb gauge transverse condition , + @xmath35 . here @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) are the bare gluon fock operators from which , by a bogoliubov - valatin canonical transformation , the dressed gluon or quasiparticle operators , @xmath38 , emerge . </S>",
    "<S> this similarity transformation is a hyperbolic rotation similar to the bcs fermion treatment . </S>",
    "<S> these operators excite constituent gluon quasiparticles from the bcs vacuum , @xmath39 , and satisfy the transverse commutation relations , @xmath40=\\delta_{ab } ( 2\\pi)^3 \\delta^3({\\bf q}-{\\bf q}')d_{{\\mu } { \\nu}}({\\bf q } )   $ ] , with @xmath41 . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the quasiparticle or gluon self - energy , @xmath42 , satisfies a gap equation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a more sophisticated treatment is also available in the literature @xcite ,    in this report we concentrate on glueballs ( hybrid mesons can be found in @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> two - gluon glueballs @xcite have been variationally computed in the russell - saunders ( or @xmath43 ) scheme . </S>",
    "<S> the ground state is the @xmath44 , @xmath45 scalar @xmath46 that we employ to fix the cutoff regulating the divergence in the gluon self - energy , to agree with the calculation of morningstar and peardon @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the rest of the parameters being fixed from the quark sector , all other glueball masses are predictions of the approach . </S>",
    "<S> if we plot the spectrum in a chew - frautschi plot to reveal regge trajectories , this state can not be on the leading ( left - most ) trajectory since it has total @xmath47 . </S>",
    "<S> its orbital excitations with @xmath45 , @xmath48 fall on a linear regge trajectory with slope close to the pomeron . </S>",
    "<S> the second state is the @xmath49 in which both spins are aligned , and this one does fall on the pomeron regge trajectory as observed first by simonov ( @xcite and references therein ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is natural since the intercept of a regge trajectory with a line of integer @xmath50 usually ( but not always ) produces a resonance in the spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> however , the pomeron having a small slope ( 0.2 - 0.3 by modern fits @xcite ) can not be represented by ordinary mesons . </S>",
    "<S> casimir color scaling between the gluon - gluon and the quark - antiquark interaction provide for an enhanced string tension in the glueball system that supports the pomeron - glueball conjecture ( the slope @xmath51 ) . </S>",
    "<S> turning now to the three body problem , the three - gluon variational wavefunction is @xmath52 with summation over repeated indices . </S>",
    "<S> the color tensor @xmath53 is either totally antisymmetric @xmath54 ( for @xmath55 1 ) or symmetric @xmath56 ( for @xmath55 -1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> boson statistics thus requires the @xmath55 -1 oddballs to have a symmetric space - spin wavefunction taken here to have form @xmath57   [ y_l^{\\lambda}(\\hat{\\bf q}_1 ) + y_l^\\lambda ( \\hat{\\bf q}_2 ) +   y_l^{\\lambda}(\\hat{\\bf q}_3 ) ] \\ </S>",

    "<S> c_{12 } = \\langle 1 \\mu_1 1 \\mu_2 \\arrowvert s </S>",
    "<S> \\mu_s \\rangle </S>",
    "<S> \\langle s \\mu_s 1 \\mu_3 \\arrowvert s \\mu \\rangle   \\langle l \\lambda s\\mu \\arrowvert j { \\cal m}\\rangle \\ , \\label{c12}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] sufficient to analyze the lightest states . </S>",
    "<S> the other two coefficients in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eqf12 ] ) can be obtained by permuting the indices in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ c12 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> several forms for the variational radial wavefunction , @xmath58 , involving two variational parameters , @xmath59 and @xmath60 , were investigated including a separable form , @xmath61 , which only involves one parameter . from previous experience @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> reliable , accurate variational solutions can be obtained if these functions have a bell - shaped form with scalable variational parameters .    </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath62 oddballs are not reported in this paper since they likely require the use of three body forces @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the ground state of the three - gluon system is calculated in our approach to be a @xmath63 glueball ( because of color , an annihilation diagram in @xcite can not contribute in the odd - c sector ) , but this is heavier than the corresponding @xmath64-wave excitation in the two - body system . </S>",
    "<S> it is interesting to note also that these @xmath63 glueballs appear in the spectrum as apparent @xmath65 excitations which have been reexamined in recent b - meson factory experiments , leading to a revised @xmath66 mass . </S>",
    "<S> finally we present our @xmath67 spectrum in the figure [ oddballspectrum ] . for comparison we also show the good agreement with lattice computations . </S>",
    "<S> in addition we give an existing constituent gluon model calculation @xcite and another by us . </S>",
    "<S> the constituent model treatment of @xcite does not report on higher spin states and we leave it out . </S>",
    "<S> one can immediately observe that the leading oddball regge trajectory , in analogy with the pomeron , the odderon , passes by the @xmath68 trajectory ( three gluons , all spins aligned ) and not by the @xmath69 as erroneously assumed in the literature . </S>",
    "<S> we look forward to further lattice computations for higher spin states to confirm this point .    also shown in the figure is the conventional @xmath1 regge trajectory . </S>",
    "<S> as can be seen and was to be expected due to the smaller color factor , it has much larger slope but higher intercept . </S>",
    "<S> at @xmath0 it will clearly dominate scattering amplitudes and the odderon should not be visible , as is the case in low @xmath2 searches at desy @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> although in our best variational model the odderon will not be observable ( by the time the two trajectories intersect , @xmath70 and @xmath71 , a linear extrapolation from timelike @xmath25 is no more valid ) , in our approach , we can not categorically preclude future searches , either at desy or bnl , discovering an odderon signature . </S>",
    "<S> such searches , however , should also be conducted at suffuciently higher -t ( greater than @xmath72 ) . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless we remain pessimistic about the prospects for observing the odderon especially since a recent extension by kaidalov and simonov of their approach to higher spin states concurs with our findings @xcite .    in concluding we note </S>",
    "<S> this is a period of timely opportunities for exciting phenomenology related to dynamical gluon mass generation and propagator suppression . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the recent cleo measurement @xcite of the @xmath73 meson mass , almost degenerate with the @xmath74 , shows that the hyperfine interaction is quite short range . </S>",
    "<S> this has traditionally been a conundrum of the quark model . </S>",
    "<S> if a long range coulomb form is supposed for the physical gluon exchange and @xmath75 the hyperfine potential has to be treated in perturbation theory ( or the wavefunction falls to the origin ) then smearing parameters have to be introduced whose meaning is unclear . in contrast , the modern , field - theory based formulation cleanly separates the cornell potential from the transverse exchange . </S>",
    "<S> this can be suppressed , its range being of order the inverse gluon gap @xmath76 , and the hyperfine interaction does not need to be so large as to provide @xmath77-@xmath78 splitting , since chiral symmetry accomplishes this @xcite and the transverse interaction can be treated in perturbation theory .    </S>",
