    "in a series of papers we have shown that the smooth lattice method works remarkably well for simple spacetimes such as the schwarzschild spacetime in various slicings @xcite , the maximally sliced oppenheimer - snyder spacetime @xcite , the vacuum kasner cosmologies @xcite and for constructing schwarzschild initial data @xcite .",
    "the equations are simple and require little computational sophistication to achieve stable and accurate results .",
    "the real test of the method however must be in the context of generic spacetimes .",
    "this paper is a first step in that direction .",
    "the logic behind the smooth lattice approach is quite simple .",
    "we assume that we are given a lattice , built from a large collection of interconnected vertices , and where each path that connects a pair of vertices is taken to be a geodesic segment of the spacetime .",
    "the only data that we are given for the lattice is the connection matrix ( which describes the topology as a list of pairs of connected vertices ) and the lengths of each geodesic segment ( which describes the metric properties ) . in this picture",
    "we are assuming that the lattice geometry is a close approximation to some underlying smooth geometry .",
    "the question that ( should ) spring to mind is  given the leg lengths on a lattice , how do we compute the riemann curvatures ?",
    "we will return to this important question in just a moment , but for now let us suppose we have a suitable algorithm by which we can accurately compute the riemann curvatures .",
    "it is then a simple matter to impose the vacuum einstein equations which in turn will impose constraints on the leg - lengths .",
    "this furnishes us with a discrete set of equations for the leg - lengths .",
    "solving these equations will yield a discrete solution of the vacuum einstein equations .",
    "we now return to the question of how to recover the riemann curvatures given the set of leg - lengths .",
    "in one of our earlier papers @xcite we argued that if the lattice was sufficiently well refined then a local riemann normal coordinate frame could be constructed in the neighbourhood of any vertex extending to include , at least , the immediate neighbouring vertices .",
    "we called this neighbourhood the computational cell for the vertex ( for lattices built from tetrahedra this would consist of the tetrahedra attached to the vertex ) . in this computational cell",
    "we can expand the metric as a power series @xcite around the central vertex @xmath0 where @xmath1 is a typical length scale for the computational cell .",
    "the requirement that the legs are geodesic segments leads , after some detailed calculations @xcite , to the following equation @xmath2 where @xmath3 .",
    "the approach advocated in @xcite was to use this equation to extract the riemann curvatures from the lattice .",
    "this may sound simple but there are a number of troubling issues .",
    "the first issue concerns the coordinates .",
    "how do we compute coordinates for each vertex ? some can be set by simple gauge transformations ( the origin can be tied to the central vertex ) while the remainder must be computed from the lattice data ( the leg - lengths ) .",
    "this forces us to view the above equations ( [ eqn : rnclsq ] ) as a coupled system for the curvatures and the coordinates .",
    "the second issue is one of accountancy  do we have enough equations to compute the curvatures and the coordinates ? for most lattices ( in 3 and higher dimensions ) the legs out number the coordinates @xmath4 and curvatures @xmath5 . as an example , the computational cell used in our earlier paper @xcite contained 78 legs and 19 vertices .",
    "thus we had 78 equations for 6 curvatures and 57 coordinates ( of which 6 can be freely chosen ) .",
    "there are at least two ways to handle this over supply of information .",
    "we can either form linear combinations of the above equations ( [ eqn : rnclsq ] ) to produce a reduced system in which the number of equations matches the number of unknowns .",
    "or we can include a sufficient number of higher order terms in the taylor series so as to produce a consistent set of equations .",
    "this later approach has the possible benefit of producing higher order approximations for the @xmath5 but at considerable extra expense . in both instances",
    "we still have a large coupled non - linear system of equations to solve at each vertex and at each time step .",
    "this is a considerable computational challenge .",
    "another important issue is one of uniqueness  how many distinct solutions can we find for the @xmath4 and @xmath6 ?",
    "the equations are non - linear and thus it is conceivable that more than one solution could be found .",
    "do the solutions form a continuous family or are there only a finite set of solutions ?",
    "how would we choose between these solutions ?",
    "in our earlier paper @xcite we resolved these problems by extending the lattice data to include the angles between each pair of legs attached to the central vertex .",
    "this allowed us to obtain an explicit and unique solution for all of the coordinates in a computational cell .",
    "it also had the added bonus of decoupling the coordinates from the curvatures  we could calculate all of the coordinates before computing the curvatures .",
    "the price we paid for this improvement was a significant increase in the number of data to be evolved .",
    "where previously we had 78 legs per computational cell , now we had a further 33 angles .",
    "however , there is a final issue which is much more serious than those just mentioned .",
    "to obtain @xmath7 accurate estimates for the curvatures , the coordinates must be computed to at least @xmath8 accuracy ( the errors must be no worse than @xmath8 ) .",
    "this follows by inspection of equation ( [ eqn : rnclsq ] ) .",
    "suppose the error in @xmath4 is @xmath9 for some @xmath10 .",
    "this error will couple with the first term on the right hand side of ( [ eqn : rnclsq ] ) to introduce an error of @xmath11 .",
    "but the curvature terms are @xmath8 and will dominate the error term only when @xmath12 . admittedly this is a somewhat naive analysis as it takes no account of the smoothness of the underlying geometry which might ensure that various lower order terms cancel ( see for example the role smoothness plays in establishing the truncation errors in centred finite - difference approximations ) .",
    "but in the absence of an explicit algorithm we are unable to demonstrate that such cancellations do occur .",
    "the upshot is that if we persist with any of the variations suggested above we must design a solution strategy that guarantees , without invoking smoothness , that the errors in the coordinates are no worse than @xmath8 . despite our best efforts",
    ", we have not found a reliable solution to this problem .",
    "these issues are not altogether new nor surprising and have proved to be a niggling concern throughout the development of the smooth lattice method .",
    "the only working solution that we have found ( there may be others ) is to surrender some ( or all ) of the main equations ( [ eqn : rnclsq ] ) in favour of the bianchi identities . in all of our papers",
    "@xcite we used a combination of the bianchi identities and the geodesic deviation equation in @xmath13 spacetimes .",
    "the results were very encouraging .",
    "this was a hybrid scheme and we attributed its success to the introduction of the bianchi identities .",
    "this is the motivation for the present paper ",
    "can we use the bianchi identities to compute all of the riemann curvatures in a @xmath14 spacetime ?",
    "we should emphasise that there is one important difference between what we propose here and our previous work . in this paper",
    "we will use the full set of bianchi identities to _ evolve _ all 20 independent riemann curvatures .",
    "in contrast , in our @xmath13 experiments we used one bianchi identity to compute one spatial curvature ( a purely 3-dimensional computation within one cauchy surface ) .",
    "why should we believe that this use of the bianchi identities will overcome the issues described above ?",
    "simply , it allows us to use lower order approximations for the vertex coordinates ( even flat space approximations ) without compromising the quality of the estimates of the curvatures .",
    "we will return to this point after we have presented the full set of evolution equations .",
    "a typical computational cell will be denoted by @xmath15 .",
    "this will be a compact subset of the spacetime manifold .",
    "the central vertex of the cell will be denoted by @xmath16 and the subset of @xmath15 obtained by the intersection of @xmath15 with the particular cauchy surface that contains @xmath16 will be denoted by @xmath17 .",
    "we will describe @xmath17 as the floor of @xmath15 .",
    "as @xmath15 has a finite extent there will be an image of @xmath17 that defines the future end of @xmath15 .",
    "we will refer to this as the roof of @xmath15 .",
    "we will have little to reason to refer to the past end of @xmath15 but calling it the basement seems consistent .",
    "we will assume throughout this paper that the vertex world lines are normal to the cauchy surfaces ( zero drift , in the language of @xcite ) .",
    "this may seem restrictive but in our experiments to date it has worked very well .",
    "within @xmath15 we will employ two sets of vectors essential to the evolution of the lattice .",
    "the first set will be an orthonormal tetrad , denoted by @xmath18 , @xmath19 , tied to the world line of @xmath16 and aligned so that @xmath20 is the tangent vector to the world line of @xmath16 .",
    "as we have assumed that the drift vector is everywhere zero this also ensures that @xmath20 is the future pointing unit normal to @xmath17 at @xmath16 .",
    "following convention , we will write @xmath21 as the unit normal to @xmath17 though as just noted , this is identical to @xmath20 .",
    "the second set of vectors will be based on the set of radial legs attached to @xmath16 .",
    "each leg will be of the form @xmath22 and we will use @xmath23 to denote the vector that joins @xmath24 to @xmath25 . note that the @xmath23 are neither unit nor orthogonal .",
    "latin characters will always be used to denote tetrad indices while the spacetime indices will be denoted by greek letters .",
    "latin characters will also be used as vertex labels and where confusion might arise we will use subsets of the latin alphabet with @xmath26 reserved for frame components while @xmath27 will be reserved for vertex labels .",
    "obviously this distinction will only be imposed for equations that contain both types of index .",
    "each cell will carry a riemann normal coordinate frame ( an rnc frame ) , with coordinates @xmath28 , tied to the central vertex and aligned with the tetrad .",
    "note that this gives precedence to the tetrad over the coordinates . coordinate components will be written as @xmath29 or for specific components as , for example , @xmath30 while for frame components we will use scripts characters @xmath31 .",
    "the coordinates for a typical vertex @xmath25 will often be written as @xmath4 but on occasion we will have need to talk about the particular values for the @xmath4 in which case we will write @xmath32 or even @xmath33 , @xmath34 etc .",
    "each rnc frame will be chosen so that at @xmath16 the metric is diagonal , @xmath35 .",
    "both spacetime and tetrad indices will be raised and lowered , at @xmath16 , using the metric @xmath36 . with these choices",
    "we see that the future pointing unit normal to the cauchy surface at the central vertex @xmath16 is just @xmath37 while @xmath38 .",
    "we also see that the tetrad @xmath18 has components @xmath39 in this rnc frame .",
    "note that @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "the legs of the lattice are required to be short geodesic segments .",
    "thus it should come as no surprise that the evolution of the leg - lengths can be obtained from the equations for the second variation of arc length . in an earlier paper @xcite we showed that , for sufficiently short legs , these equations can be written as follows @xmath44 \\ddlsqdt & = 2 n_{|\\alpha\\beta } \\dxij^\\alpha \\dxij^\\beta \\label{eqn : admdlijb}\\\\                & \\quad + 2 n\\left (   k_{\\mu\\alpha}k^\\mu{}_\\beta                                    - r_{\\mu\\alpha\\nu\\beta } n^\\mu",
    "n^\\nu \\right )                        \\dxij^\\alpha \\dxij^\\beta + \\bigo{l^3}\\notag\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for numerical purposes it is somewhat easier to rewrite these in the following form @xmath45 \\dpijdt & = - n_{|\\alpha\\beta } \\dxij^\\alpha \\dxij^\\beta \\label{eqn : admdlijd}\\\\                & \\quad - n\\left (   k_{\\mu\\alpha}k^\\mu{}_\\beta                                  - r_{\\mu\\alpha\\nu\\beta } n^\\mu n^\\nu \\right )                        \\dxij^\\alpha \\dxij^\\beta\\notag\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in which we have introduced the new variables @xmath46 , one per leg .",
    "the @xmath47 can be obtained by a suitable weighted sum of equation ( [ eqn : admdlija ] ) as described in section ( [ sec : extrinsic ] ) .",
    "we have also dropped the truncation terms as these are not used during a numerical integration .",
    "clearly , the evolution of the leg lengths requires a knowledge of the riemann curvatures and to that end we now present the evolution equations for those curvatures .",
    "we know that there are only 20 algebraically independent riemann curvatures in 4 dimensions .",
    "so which should we choose ? by a careful inspection of the algebraic symmetries of @xmath6 we settled upon the following @xmath48",
    "our aim is to use the bianchi identities to obtain evolution equations for the riemann curvatures .",
    "we begin by writing down the bianchi identities at the central vertex , where the connection vanishes , @xmath49 along with a contracted version of the same equation @xmath50 this pair of equations , along with the vacuum einstein field equations , and a judicious choice of indices will provide us with all of the required evolution equations .",
    "this leads to the following 14 differential equations v @xmath51    there are of course 20 independent @xmath6 , 14 of which are subject to the above evolution equations while the remaining 6 can be obtained from the vacuum einstein equations @xmath52 though these are not differential equations they do , none the less , provide a means to evolve the 6 curvatures @xmath53 .",
    "the important point to note about this system of equations is that it is closed , there are 20 evolution equations for 20 curvatures . the source terms , such as @xmath54 , could be computed by importing data from the neighbouring cells , by an appropriate combination of rotations and boosts , and using a suitable finite difference approximation ( see section ( [ sec : sourceterms ] ) for more details ) ) . in this way the lattice serves as a scaffold on which source terms such as these can be computed .      in deriving the 20 evolution equations of the previous section we used only 6 of the 10 vacuum einstein equations .",
    "thus the 4 remaining vacuum einstein equations must be viewed as constraints .",
    "these equations are @xmath55    finally , we have the following 6 constraints that arise from the bianchi identities . @xmath56    so all up we have 20 evolution equations assembled from the 14 differential equations ( [ eqn : riemevola][eqn : riemevoln ] ) and 6 algebraic equations ( [ eqn : riemevolo][eqn : riemevolt ] ) plus 10 constraints comprising 4 einstein equations ( [ eqn : einsconsta][eqn : einsconstd ] ) and 6 bianchi identities ( [ eqn : bianconsta][eqn : bianconstf ] ) .",
    "this is a such a simple system that it allows simple questions to be explored and answered with ease .",
    "the questions that we will address are    1 .",
    "are the constraints preserved by the evolution equations ? 2 .",
    "do the evolution equations constitute a hyperbolic system ?    for both questions",
    "the answer is yes and we shall now demonstrate that this is so .      in the following discussion we will assume that , by some means , we have constructed an initial data set for the 20 @xmath6 .",
    "that is , the 20 @xmath6 are chosen so that the 10 constraints ( [ eqn : einsconsta][eqn : bianconstf ] ) vanish at the central vertex of _ every _ computational cell in the lattice",
    ".    we will also need the trivial result that @xmath57 which follows directly from equations ( [ eqn : riemevolo],[eqn : riemevolp],[eqn : riemevolq],[eqn : einsconsta ] ) .",
    "consider now the constraint @xmath58 . by assumption , this constraint is satisfied on the initial slice . to demonstrate that it continues to hold throughout the evolution we need to show that @xmath59 . from ( [ eqn : einsconstd ] )",
    "this requires us to show that @xmath60 . using ( [ eqn : riemevolk],[eqn : riemevoln ] )",
    "we see that @xmath61 however on the initial slice we also have , by assumption , ( [ eqn : bianconsta ] ) @xmath62 which when combined with the previous equation leads to @xmath63 but by equation ( [ eqn : scalarr ] ) we see that the right hand side is just @xmath64 and as @xmath65 across the initial slice we also have that @xmath66 at every central vertex .",
    "this completes the proof .",
    "the two other constraints , @xmath67 and @xmath68 , can be dealt with in a similar fashion .",
    "all that remains is to show that @xmath69 is conserved .",
    "we proceed in a manner similar to the above .",
    "first we use @xmath70 and then use equations ( [ eqn : riemevola],[eqn : riemevold],[eqn : riemevolf ] ) to compute the time derivative @xmath71 where the last line arose by inspection of equations ( [ eqn : einsconstb][eqn : einsconstd ] ) .",
    "but @xmath72 at every central vertex on the initial slice .",
    "thus @xmath73 , @xmath74 on the central vertex which in turn shows that @xmath75 on the initial slice .    a key element in the above proofs was the use of constraints based on the bianchi identities .",
    "the question now must be  do the evolution equations preserve those constraints ?",
    "the answer is yes which we will now demonstrate on a typical case .",
    "consider the constraint ( [ eqn : bianconsta ] ) @xmath76 we know this to be true on the initial slice and we need to show that the evolution equations ( [ eqn : riemevola][eqn : riemevoln ] ) guarantee that it will be satisfied on all subsequent slices .",
    "the calculations follow a now familiar pattern , @xmath77 the same analysis can be applied to the remaining constraint equations .",
    "our approach to proving hyperbolicity will be quite simple .",
    "we will manipulate the evolution equations ( [ eqn : riemevola][eqn : riemevoln ] ) to demonstrate that each of our 20 @xmath6 satisfies the standard second order wave equation .",
    "let us start with a simple example , equation ( [ eqn : riemevola ] ) .",
    "we take one further time derivative , commute the mixed partial derivatives and then use equations ( [ eqn : riemevolg],[eqn : riemevolh ] ) to eliminate the single time derivative .",
    "this leads to @xmath78 however , we also have @xmath79 , which allows us to reduce the last two terms of the previous equation to just @xmath80 .",
    "thus we have @xmath81 this is the standard flat space wave equation for @xmath82 .",
    "a similar analysis shows that @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 and @xmath87 are also solutions of the wave equation .",
    "we now turn to the 8 @xmath6 in which the indices @xmath88 contain just one @xmath89 .",
    "the proof ( that each such @xmath6 satisfies the wave equation ) differs from the above only in the way the bianchi identities are used .",
    "applying the first few steps outlined above to equation ( [ eqn : riemevolg ] ) leads to @xmath90 in which we have deliberately introduced the pair of terms @xmath91 to aid in the following exposition .",
    "the last three terms can be dealt with as follows .",
    "first notice that @xmath92 where in last line we have used the contracted bianchi identity @xmath93 .",
    "but we know that @xmath72 at every central vertex , thus all of its partial derivatives will be zero and so the each term on the right hand vanishes leading to our desired result @xmath94    finally we note that the remaining 6 @xmath6 , that is those that carry two @xmath89 s in their indices , are linear combinations of the previous 14 @xmath6 , see equations ( [ eqn : riemevolo][eqn : riemevolt ] ) , and thus will also be solutions of the wave equation .",
    "thus we have shown , as claimed , that all 20 @xmath6 satisfy the wave equation .",
    "there are two problems in the forgoing analysis .",
    "the first problem is that we chose a unit lapse function when presenting the evolution equations ( [ eqn : riemevola][eqn : riemevoln ] ) .",
    "we can easily remedy this problem by making a simple vertex dependent coordinate substitution @xmath95 in each of the evolution equations .",
    "the second problem is somewhat more of a challenge .",
    "it stems from the simple fact that each computational cell is local in both space and time and therefore no single rnc can be used to track the evolution for an extended period of time .",
    "we will have no choice but to jump periodically to a new rnc frame .",
    "but how might we do this ?",
    "one approach goes as follows .",
    "build , on the world line of a typical vertex , a pair of distinct but overlapping cells , with one cell lying slightly to the future of the other .",
    "then evolve the curvatures in the frame of one cell into the overlap region followed by a coordinate transformation to import the newly evolved curvatures into the frame of the future cell .",
    "this completes one time step of the integration whereupon the whole process can be repeated any number of times along the vertex world line .",
    "a useful improvement on this is to use a local tetrad to construct scalars thus avoiding the need for explicit coordinate transformations when passing from one cell to the next .",
    "the price we pay for this is that we have to account for the evolution of the tetrad along the world line .",
    "as we shall see this is rather easy to do ( essentially we project the tetrad onto the legs of the lattice ) .",
    "we will explore this method first on a simple example before presenting the computations for the curvature evolution equations .",
    "in this example we will suppose that we have a vector @xmath96 that evolves along the world line of the central vertex according to @xmath97 our aim is to obtain a related equation that describes the evolution of the vector along the whole length of the world line , not just the short section contained within this one cell .",
    "suppose that we have an orthonormal tetrad @xmath98 , @xmath19 on @xmath17 with @xmath20 aligned to @xmath99 , the future pointing normal to @xmath17 , and that we have aligned the rnc coordinate axes with the tetrad ( note how this gives precedence to the tetrad over the coordinates ) .",
    "thus at the central vertex of @xmath15 we have @xmath100   n^\\mu = e^\\mu{}_1 \\>,\\quad -n_\\mu = e_\\mu{}^1 \\\\[3pt ] e^\\mu{}_a e_\\mu{}^b = \\delta_a{}^b\\>,\\quad e^\\mu{}_a",

    "what can we say about the evolved data ?",
    "first , note that the orthonormal conditions are preserved , that is @xmath105 thus the tetrad obtained by integrating the above equations will remain orthonormal along the world line of the central vertex .",
    "second , using @xmath106 to compute @xmath107 we see that @xmath108 which shows that @xmath42 and @xmath109 everywhere along the world line . that is , @xmath110 remains tied to the world line .",
    "all that remains is to account for how the tetrad rotates around the world line .",
    "this we shall do by evolving the projections of the @xmath111 , @xmath104 onto the legs of the lattice .",
    "let @xmath112 , @xmath113 be any three distinct legs of the lattice attached to the central vertex .",
    "now consider a short time step in which the vector @xmath114 sweeps out a short quadrilateral in spacetime ( see figure ( [ img : vectors ] ) ) .",
    "the upper and lower edges will be the past and future versions of @xmath114 while the remaining two sides will be generated by the word lines of the vertices that define @xmath114 . since we have assumed at the outset that all vertices evolve normal to the cauchy surface we see that these vertical vectors correspond to @xmath115 .",
    "the important point is that this set of four vectors forms a closed loop , in short the vectors @xmath114 and @xmath116 commute , thus @xmath117 the left hand side is simply @xmath118 , while the right hand side can be expanded using ( [ eqn : derivnormal ] ) .",
    "this leads to @xmath119 where we have dropped the term involving @xmath120 as this would be @xmath121 with @xmath122 while the remaining terms are all @xmath7 .",
    "we are now ready to construct our scalar evolution equations .",
    "let @xmath123 and @xmath124 then @xmath125 \\frac{d\\v_a{}^b}{dt ' } = \\frac{dv^\\mu{}_a}{dt'}e_\\mu{}^b + v^\\mu{}_a \\frac{de_\\mu{}^b}{dt'}\\ > , \\quad b=1,2,3,4\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] each of these equations can be re - cast entirely in terms of the scalars by first using ( [ eqn : tetraddta],[eqn : tetraddtb],[eqn : vadt ] ) to eliminate the time derivatives on the right hand side followed by the substitutions @xmath126 and @xmath127 .",

    "these are our final equations .",
    "they are valid along the whole length of the world line , not just the part contained in one cell .",
    "equation ( [ eqn : edotv ] ) describes the motion of the tetrad relative to the legs of the lattice . as we integrate forward in time we can use the values of @xmath133 to locate the tetrad within the computational cell .",
    "if we chose to construct an rnc within the cell then we can go one step further and recover the values of @xmath111 and the @xmath96 .",
    "now we can return to the task of constructing the generalised evolution equations for the curvatures .",
    "we start by introducing a pair of relations between the tetrad and coordinate components of the curvature tensor @xmath134 \\rmanb & = \\rabcd \\ema \\eab \\enc \\ebd\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and then forming a typical evolution equation @xmath135 with each @xmath136 term on the right hand side replaced by a suitable combination of the existing evolution equations , ( [ eqn : riemevola][eqn : riemevoln ] ) for the curvature terms and ( [ eqn : tetraddta],[eqn : tetraddtb ] ) for the tetrad terms .    rather than working through all 14 equations",
    "we will demonstrate the procedure on just one equation ( [ eqn : riemevola ] ) leaving the remaining equations ( but not their working ) to the appendix .",
    "so our starting point is @xmath137 and using ( [ eqn : riemevola ] ) we obtain @xmath138 finally we use ( [ eqn : tetraddta],[eqn : tetraddtb ] ) to eliminate the time derivative of @xmath139 , leading to @xmath140 this is as far as we need go , though it is tempting to make the substitutions @xmath141 and @xmath142 .",
    "but that is not really necessary as we can defer those substitutions until we actually need values for the stated partial derivatives .",
    "this is described in more detail in section ( [ sec : sourceterms ] ) .",

    "we turn now to the simple question  how accurate do we need the coordinates to be ? that is , if @xmath187 are the exact riemann normal coordinates for vertex @xmath188 , then how large can we allow @xmath189 to be ?",

    "the problem here is that if we treat this as a system of equations for the spacetime coordinates @xmath193 it is extremely unlikely that we will find any solutions ( or if we do then the numerics will almost certainly be extremely unstable ) .",
    "the reason is quite simple  the vertices are assumed to lie within one 3-dimensional cauchy surface .",
