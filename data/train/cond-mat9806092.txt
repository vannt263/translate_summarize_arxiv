    "we were able to solve the fermionic tap - equations numerically on the @xmath0 axis and to determine the first order transition at @xmath8 where the paramagnetic- and spin glass free energies become equal .",
    "the dependence of the filling factor on the chemical potential and the distribution of internal fields are given below .",
    "the free energy corresponding to the non - fermionic tap - equations is :    @xmath9    in order to calculate the corresponding expression for the generalized fermionic model , we extended the linked cluster diagrammatic theory by horwitz and callen @xcite .",
    "for the sake of simplicity this rigorous and lengthy derivation is replaced by shorter and more intuitive arguments .    the terms involving logarithms in equation ( [ eq : non - fermionic - free - energy ] )",
    "correspond to the entropy of an ensemble of spins in the non - fermionic two state model with relative occupations @xmath10 and @xmath11 , using @xmath12 .",

    "the diagrammatic expansion showed already that , provided the series actually converges , the terms of cubic order or higher are suppressed in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "we may now determine the radius of convergence of @xmath31 , which , by a standard theorem of complex analysis , is equivalent to the radius of convergence of    @xmath32    there , the susceptibility matrix @xmath33 is defined as    @xmath34    the radius of convergence is given by @xmath35 , where the minimization is done over the values of @xmath36 with eigenvalues @xmath37 in the inverse susceptibility matrix @xmath38 . in the non - fermionic case the equation @xmath39^{-1})_{ij } = \\partial_{m_i } \\partial_{m_j } { \\mathcal{g}}({\\underline{{m}}})$ ] signifies that , when taking into account the special properties of the spectra of these random matrices @xcite , the local stability of a tap - solution implies the validity of the free energy at this point .",
    "in the fermionic model we have to deal with two different matrices to describe either the convergence of the linked cluster expansion @xmath40 or the local stability of a given tap - solution by    @xmath41    a theorem by pastur @xcite used heavily by plefka @xcite and resolvent - calculus can be applied to both cases to determine the limits of the support of the spectra .",
    "it is very interesting to note , that at the end of quite lengthy calculations both matrices lead exactly to the same set of conditions generalizing plefka s convergence and stability conditions by    @xmath42    the known non - fermionic limit is obtained by setting @xmath43 .",
    "we have thus linked the local stability of tap - solutions to the finite support of the spectrum of random matrices in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "this gives a hint why the numerical search for these solutions is so difficult @xcite : for finite @xmath44 the support of these spectra becomes unbounded , see e.g. @xcite for the exponential corrections to the semi - circle - law at finite @xmath44 .",
    "this means , that for every solution the probability of having _ negative _ eigenvalues in the stability matrix is finite .",
    "but already one negative eigenvalue prevents finding this solution via minimization algorithms .",
    "most solutions become thus unstable .",
    "the tap - equations are readily solved numerically in the homogeneous paramagnetic phase , where they reduce to one single equation for @xmath45 given for all @xmath46 by    @xmath47    this is exactly the equation found in @xcite for @xmath48 with a replicated quantum - field theory approach .",
    "the second - order transitions between the paramagnetic and the spin glass phase are given by the intersection of the paramagnetic solutions with the stability conditions ( equations ( [ eq : stability - one ] ) and ( [ eq : stability - two ] ) ) .",
    "in the next section we find a first order transition on the @xmath0 axis at @xmath49 .",
    "we expect a line of first order transitions linking this point with the tricritical point .",

    "at @xmath50 the tap - equations reduce to    @xmath51    where @xmath52 and @xmath53 denotes a modified sign function .",
    "the energy corresponding to these solutions is simply    @xmath54    which has to be compared with the free energy of the paramagnetic solution @xmath55 to find the first order transition .",
    "we were able to calculate numerically a huge number of spin glass solutions .",
    "we first note the interesting dependence of the filling factor @xmath56 on the chemical potential ( see figure [ fig : global ] ) .",
    "unlike the discontinuous replica - symmetric and finite - step rsb solutions @xcite the filling factor varies continously with @xmath3 in the vincinity of @xmath57 .",
    "the numerical data for the increase of @xmath2 near @xmath57 are compatible with power law fits @xmath58 , @xmath59 , including exponential behavior .     as a function of the chemical potential for systems of different size .",

    "another very interesting feature shows up in the behaviour of the distribution of the local fields @xmath62 . when applying a chemical potential this probability density function",
    "is substantially modified .",

    "the number of solutions of the tap - equations ( related to the so - called complexity ) can be calculated adopting the procedure of bray and moore @xcite for finite @xmath67 or following roberts @xcite for @xmath0 .",
    "we were able to obtain in both cases fermionic generalizations of the saddle - point equations , which become extremely complicated due to the additional non - magnetic degrees of freedom .",
    "for example in the finite temperature case the equations for the parameters @xmath68 , @xmath48 @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 read    @xmath73        + \\frac{j^2}2 { { \\ensuremath{\\langle\\theta\\sqrt{1-\\lambda^2}{\\kappa}^2\\xi\\rangle{}}}_i } , } \\ ] ]    which can be viewed as an extension of the original equations given by bray and moore , but the average @xmath74 means averaging by use of the following kernel :    @xmath75 ( 1-{\\kappa})^{u-1 } \\\\ & \\times      \\exp\\bigl(\\eta\\,({\\kappa}\\lambda)^2 +        \\varrho\\,{\\kappa}+ \\frac{u\\,{\\kappa}\\,\\lambda}2 \\tanh^{-1}(\\lambda )   -        \\frac{1}{2 j^2 q}\\,\\left ( \\tanh^{-1}(\\lambda ) - { \\kappa}\\,\\lambda\\,\\delta        \\right)^2 \\bigr )      \\\\ &      \\times \\delta\\left (        \\ln\\left(\\frac{({\\kappa}^2 - ( { \\kappa}\\lambda)^2)\\cosh^2(\\mu)}{(1-{\\kappa})^2}\\right )        - j^2 ( { \\ensuremath{\\tilde{q}}}- q )      \\right)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath76 is the reduced magnetisation , @xmath77 an abbrevation for a very lengthy expression .",
    "these equations remain currently unsolved even numerically .",
    "the equations for @xmath0 are equally hard to treat .",
    "the numerical work presented here should now be accompanied by exact analytic rsb calculations for arbitrary @xmath3 . in order to reproduce the behavior of @xmath2 and of @xmath78 the generalizations of robert s",
    "saddle - point equations @xcite should be solved .",
    "it would be desirable to have parisi s solution ( infinite step rsb ) for @xmath79 .",
    "the answer to one of the open questions might reveal the exact path of the first order transition line for @xmath80 .",
    "if this turns out to be impossible , one should find more refined numeric algorithms , which allow to solve the fermionic tap - equations for @xmath81 ."
