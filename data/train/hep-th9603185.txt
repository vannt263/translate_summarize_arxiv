    "since aharonov and bohm ( ab ) have discussed a scattering problem of a charged particle by a solenoid in order to clarify the significance of the vector potential in the quantum theory @xcite , many people have considered the same problem from various viewpoints @xcite@xcite . as is well known",
    ", there are two approaches to deal with a scattering problem in the quantum theory .",
    "the first approach is to find a stationary state describing the scattering process by solving a time - independent schrdinger equation .",
    "the second one is to study the time development of a wave packet with respect to a time - dependent schrdinger equation .",
    "most people as well as aharonov and bohm have analyzed the scattering by means of the first approach , and some people have discussed the same problem with the second approach @xcite , @xcite .",
    "as we see in the following , however , in spite of these efforts it seems not to be clear what is an incident wave in this scattering process . in this paper",
    "we will try to answer this question with the first method because there seems to be lacking a common interpretation of the stationary wave function in the literature .",
    "a system of charged particles interacting with the solenoid is described by a hamiltonian @xmath1 where the electromagnetic vector potential @xmath2 is given by @xmath3 in order to study the scattering of the charged particles we solve the time - independent schrdinger equation @xmath4 to find an eigenfunction which describes the scattering process of charged particles .    since the hamiltonian commutes with the angular momentum",
    ", it can be easily shown that a most general solution of is given by @xmath5 where @xmath6 denotes the bessel function of @xmath7-th order and we have put @xmath8 . in , @xmath9 s are arbitrary constants to be determined by phisycal requirements . our main interest here and in the following is to ask what should be the correct choice for the coefficients @xmath9 s to describe the scattering process .",
    "it has been asserted by aharonov and bohm and many other authors that the incident wave for this scattering problem , when the incident beam comes into from the positive @xmath10 axis , should be a modulated plane wave @xmath11 to make the probability current of the incident wave constant . to fulfill this requirement the coefficients have been taken to be @xmath12 . in the case of nonintegral @xmath13 , however , the incident wave becomes a multi - valued function .",
    "we may say that from the physical point of view it seems quite unsatisfactory to take such a multi - valued wave function as an incident one .",
    "we should also note that , for sufficiently large @xmath14 , the term due to the vector potential do not contribute to the dominant part of the current , even if we take a plane wave as an incident wave function .",
    "thus , it is not conclusive to argue that the incident modulated wave gives the condition to determine those constants as @xmath12",
    ".    it will be , therefore , instructive to reconsider the scattering problem from other viewpoints .",
    "in this paper we try to find the wave function to describe the scattering process using two different ways .",
    "the first one is to solve the lippmann - schwinger ( ls ) equation , which will be a standard method to consider the scattering problem of a quantum system , taking a plane wave as an incident state instead of the modulated one .",
    "if we adopt the born expansion to solve the ls equation , we will soon meet a difficulty because the perturbative method does not work for the present problem as is shown in @xcite , @xcite .",
    "then we find an exact solution of the ls equation with the aid of the feynman kernel .",
    "the second method is an application of gordon s idea which is proposed to discuss the scattering problem by the coulomb potential @xcite .",
    "the idea may have been introduced to avoid the difficulty caused by the long - ranged nature of the coulomb potential in formulating a scattering theory .",
    "this method will also be useful to examine scattering problems by other potentials with long - range effect .",
    "it will be shown that these two methods give the same wave function to describe the scattering state given by ab @xcite .    if @xmath15 , a further discussion is needed since the solution of the schrdinger equation for infinitely thin solenoid does neither vanish nor be defined at the origin in that case . to ensure the impenetrability of the solenoid even for integral @xmath13",
    ", we assume a solenoid to have a finite radius and consider this issue by generalizing the second method .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows . in section [ kernelkeisan ]",
    "we give the feynman kernel with effects of the solenoid potential using the path integral method .",
    "section [ lsanalysis ] is devoted to solving the ls equation exactly with the aid of the feynman kernel , and the explicit form of the wave function will be obtained . in section [ gordon1 ] gordon s method",
    "will be argued and its generalization to a system of a solenoid with finite radius will be done in section [ gordon2 ] .",
    "conclusions and discussions in comparison with other s results are made in section [ discuss ] .",
    "since the complete set of the eigenfunctions @xmath16 for the hamiltonian with effects of the solenoid are known , we can immediately find an expression of the feynman kernel @xmath17 as its spectral representation @xcite , @xcite @xmath18 to verify this expression , it suffices to notice the following facts , ( i ) it obeys the time - dependent schrdinger equation , ( ii ) it is apparently single - valued with respect to both @xmath19 and @xmath20 , ( iii ) it has the correct limit @xmath21 which follows from @xmath22\\ ,      \\label{fourier - bessel}\\ ] ] and @xmath23\\ .",
    "\\label{deltatheta}\\ ] ] if we carry out the integration with respect to @xmath24 in , we obtain @xmath25    by use of or we can proceed to solve the ls equation . in this section , however , we would like to give another derivation of because there seems to be some confusion in the path integral construction of the feynman kernel in the literature @xcite@xcite . among them",
    "the most typical one would be the interpretation of its expression as _ the sum over winding number _ such as @xmath26 where @xmath27 comes from paths going around the solenoid @xmath28 times in anticlockwise way , and the factor @xmath29 is a one dimensional representation of the fundamental group of the configuration space . in the following , however ,",
    "we show that _ the sum over winding number is not essential _ , and that the sum in is to be interpreted as a result of the reformulation with aid of the poisson sum formula for the expression obtained using the usual path integral method . to achieve this",
    "we will make use of the completeness relations of both eigenvectors @xmath30 of @xmath31 with eigenvalue @xmath32 , and eigenvectors @xmath33 of @xmath34 with eigenvalue @xmath35 , in formulating the path integral . as is easily recognized",
    ", the single - valuedness of is the consequence of these relations @xcite .",
    "now we give the path integral derivation for the feynman kernel of this system .",
    "defining the exponential operator by @xmath36 and using the completeness of the states @xmath30 , we obtain @xmath37 then , with the aid of the completeness of the states @xmath33 , we can express the infinitesimal version of the feynman kernel as @xmath38\\   , \\label{hammat1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath39 .",
    "after shifting the integration variable @xmath35 by @xmath40 we can rewrite as @xmath41 carrying out the gaussian integration with respect to @xmath35 and noting that @xmath42 we obtain @xmath43 , \\label{shortkernel1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have made a change of variables from cartesian coordinate to the polar one and @xmath44 in has been renamed by @xmath45 .    to find the kernel for a finite time interval @xmath46 we need to perform @xmath47 integrations with respect to @xmath32 s in . for this purpose ,",
    "the form of the exponent in is extremely inconvenient . to overcome the difficulty it is useful to rewrite @xmath48 where @xmath49 upon integration with respect to @xmath32 or @xmath50 , the gaussian part in the integrand will dominate for sufficiently small @xmath51 .",

    "\\label{pathact1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] therefore the infinitesimal kernel is now rewritten as @xmath63 here a comment is in need ; in obtaining the result of we have discarded the possibility to use the modified bessel function of negative order since it breaks the regularity of the kernel at the origin .",
    "it is now straightforward to see that the multiplication rule holds : @xmath64 since the integration with respect to the angle variable is trivial and we may make use of a formula @xmath65 which holds for @xmath66 .",
    "repeated use of the rule ( and putting all @xmath44 s to @xmath67 after integration ) will lead us to @xmath68 thus is again obtained by the usual formulation of path integral . here",
    "it should be noticed that the sum over winding numbers in formulating the path integral is not essential .",
    "in this section we obtain the wave function for the scattering state of charged particles scattered by the solenoid .",
    "it is known that , for the present problem , the born approximation fails to give a reliable answer because we can not avoid a divergent integral @xmath69 even in its first order @xcite , @xcite . the iterative method to solve the ls equation",
    "will also be unsatisfactory by the same reason .",
    "therefore we need to solve it in an exact way with the aid of the feynman kernel given in .",
    "the ls equation for the system reads @xmath70 where we have taken an incident plane wave @xmath71 as an eigenstate of the free hamiltonian and @xmath72 indicates the direction of the incident beam . from , we can easily obtain the green s function in the above by laplace transform @xmath73 by putting @xmath74 , it turns out to be @xmath75 where use has been made of a formula @xmath76 ,      \\label{besselkousiki}\\ ] ] and @xmath77 is the step function .    substituting and partial wave expansion of the plane wave @xmath78 into the integrand of @xmath79 , we obtain @xmath80 where @xmath81 making use of a formula of indefinite integral for cylindrical functions(represented by @xmath82 and @xmath83 for the sake of convenience ) @xmath84 we obtain @xmath85 and @xmath86    by a simple calculation with the aid of lommel s formula @xmath87 we have @xmath88 then can be rewritten as @xmath89 we thus find that the total wave function for the scattering state is given by @xmath90 it is very interesting to recognize that by putting @xmath91 the solution of ls equation coincides with the wave function obtained by ab @xcite .",
    "but we have to remember that in solving the ls equation we take the plane wave as an incident wave and that the resulting scattered wave is given by . in spite of the fact that the total wave function is same as that of ab , both the incident wave and the scattered wave in this section are different from those of ab as a consequence",

    "nevertheless , this disagreement can be discarded when we have an interest in the differential cross section only for non - forward direction(@xmath112 ) since we can not well separate the scattered and un - scattered particles in the forward direction experimentally . as far as in the non - forward direction ,",
    "the differential cross section is thus given by @xmath113 in this sense the scattering amplitude of ab describes the physics appropriately .",
    "however , if we take into account the unitarity of the @xmath0-matrix , the @xmath44 function for the forward direction can not be neglected as is pointed out by ruijsenaars @xcite . a more detailed description of the property of the @xmath0-matrix for this system is given in appendix [ smatrix ] .",
    "we here consider the other approach to the problem by using a modified version of gordon s idea which has been proposed in the analysis for the scattering of a charged particle by the coulomb potential @xcite .",
    "the essence of the method is to prepare the asymptotic region described by the free hamiltonian far distant from the solenoid in order to overcome some difficulties caused by the long range effects of the solenoid field . to this aim",
    "we introduce a modified vector potential @xmath114 where @xmath115 is the radius of the shielded solenoid . it should be noticed that in the region @xmath116 the vector potential does not affect charged particles .",
    "to go back to the original ab problem we just put @xmath117 after solving the schrdinger equation for this system . in this section , we first deal with the scattering by an infinitely thin solenoid(@xmath118 ) , and then we generalize the analysis to the case of a finite size(@xmath119 ) solenoid in the next section .    in the asymptotic region(@xmath120 ) where the vector potential is absent , the solution of the schrdinger equation is given by eigenstates of the free hamiltonian and the wave function to describe the scattering state @xmath121 will be given by @xmath122 where @xmath123 s are constant coefficients to be determined in the following .",

    "therefore the solution for the scattering region is given by @xmath140    to determine the coefficients @xmath123 in and @xmath136 in , we require the continuity of the wave function itself as well as its derivative in the normal direction on the surface @xmath141 . these conditions may be imposed on each partial wave independently to give @xmath142 here @xmath143 in is defined by @xmath144 and we have put @xmath145 because it should be identified with the phase - shift of @xmath100-th partial wave .",
    "thus , we obtain a solution in the scattering region @xmath146 and also in the asymptotic region @xmath147    we put @xmath117 in and by making use of the well - known asymptotic forms of cylindrical functions and that of the whittaker function @xmath148 for @xmath149 in to obtain the phase - shift @xmath150 then the coefficients of scattered wave in the asymptotic region is found to be @xmath151 when @xmath152 becomes large , the coefficient @xmath153 in the solution of scattering region behaves as @xmath154 .",

    "we find that the incident wave is given by the plane wave and that the scattered wave is given by the second term of denoted by @xmath160 @xmath161 if we take the limit @xmath162 of @xmath160 , we again obtain the same scattering amplitude as in the previous section . thus we conclude that the two approach to discuss the scattering problem of this system give the same result .    here",
    "it is better to give a comment on the relation between the methods explained here and in the previous section . in finding the scattering amplitude in section [ lsanalysis ] ,",
    "information on the scattering has been given by the asymptotic behavior of the wave function that corresponds to @xmath125 in this section .",
    "on the other hand , in this section , @xmath121 describes asymptotic behavior of the scattering state as has been shown above .",
    "the fact that these two methods give the same result is the consequence of the existence of the limit @xmath117 in both @xmath125 and @xmath121 simultaneously . in other words",
    ", we may say that the aharonov - bohm scattering problem accepts the plane wave as a piece of its asymptotic wave function . in this regard ,",
    "we are reminded of the need of a more careful treatment in the same analysis of the scattering by the coulomb potential .",
    "as is easily seen from or , the whole wave function of the scattering state neither vanishes nor is defined at the origin . therefore the analyses in the preceding sections are unsatisfactory on this point .",
    "fortunately the idea developed in the previous section is easily generalized to the system with a solenoid of finite radius . repeating the same procedure with finite @xmath115",
    ", we obtain @xmath163 where @xmath164 and @xmath165 and the wave function is assumed to vanish in the region @xmath166 . again from the solution in the asymptotic region we can easily find the scattered wave @xmath167 and its asymptotic form for large @xmath10 @xmath168 the first term in the scattering amplitude exactly cancels the corresponding term from the incident plane wave .",
    "therefore the @xmath0-matrix for the system is just a multiplication of a complex number of unit modulus : @xmath169 on each eigenspace of the angular momentum .",
    "hence the unitarity of the @xmath0-matrix is evident .",

    "unlike the case @xmath118(extremely thin solenoid ) , the wave function is strictly subjected to the boundary condition @xmath177 even when @xmath15 .",
    "thus the solenoid is completely impenetrable to the charged particles . here",
    "let us consider the special case of @xmath15 .",
    "the explicit form of @xmath178 is found to be @xmath179 for @xmath180 and @xmath181 for @xmath182 .",
    "when @xmath183 tends to @xmath67 , these two formula behave in quite different ways .",
    "the formula is nothing but a total cross section of two dimensional hard core scattering , thus tends to @xmath67 with @xmath184 as @xmath185 .",
    "this result simply means that in the case of @xmath180 charged particles are not affected by the solenoid at all . on the other hand",
    ", the formula grows up to @xmath186 in the same limit since it has the neumann function instead of the bessel function in the numerator of each term .",
    "therefore the total cross section of ab scattering for @xmath182 diverges when the radius of the solenoid tends to @xmath67 .",
    "this singular behavior is the common feature of the total cross section except the case @xmath180 .",
    "if we notice that the partial cross section for large @xmath100 approaches immediately to @xmath187 even for finite @xmath183 , we conclude that the singularity is not the consequence of putting the radius of solenoid infinitely small .",
    "this result implies the important fact that the vector potential can affect the charged particles even in the case of @xmath182 , which is the different conclusion from that of ab .",
    "apart from the divergence of the total cross section considered above , the unitarity of the @xmath0-matrix on each eigenspace of angular momentum is expected from .",
    "this fact is also recognized from the different point of view . according to the discussion given in the appendix [ appa ] ,",
    "the generalized optical theorem , which is rewritten in terms of partial wave decomposition of a scattering amplitude @xmath188 as @xmath189 is equivalent to the unitarity of the @xmath0-matrix . in our problem @xmath190",
    "is given by @xmath191}^{\\pm}(\\alpha )      e^{\\mp i\\pi\\alpha/2}\\ ,      \\label{fnab}\\ ] ] where the upper and the lower signs correspond to @xmath192\\ge 0 $ ] or @xmath192 < 0 $ ] , respectively .",
    "then the condition reads @xmath193 and is easily verified .    as for the system with",
    "infinitely thin solenoid , an explicit form of the @xmath0-matrix is found and the operator identity @xmath194 can be verified directly .",
    "this is given in appendix [ smatrix ] .",
    "in this article the scattering problem , first discussed by aharonov and bohm @xcite , has been reconsidered .",
    "we have examined how the charged particle is scattered by the solenoid taking a plane wave as an incident wave in two ways ; by solving lippmann - schwinger equation ; by applying the gordon s idea to the present situation .",
    "furthermore the scattering problem by a solenoid of finite radius has been considered from the second viewpoint to ensure the impenetrability of the solenoid .",
    "we have shown that the two methods considered in this paper give the same wave function which represents the scattering state and that the results for the infinitely thin solenoid are exactly the same as was obtained by ab as far as the total wave function is concerned .",
    "however , it should be stressed again that the incident wave taken in this paper is different from that of ab to result in the disagreement in the scattering amplitude of this paper to that of @xcite or @xcite by the term proportional to the @xmath44-function .",
    "it is the appearance of the @xmath44-function of forward direction that guarantees the unitarity of the @xmath0-matrix . on this point",
    ", our result agrees with that by ruijsenaars @xcite . in appendix [ appb ]",
    "we discuss the result of ab and give an explanation for the reason why we need the @xmath44-function in addition to the scattering amplitude given by ab .",
    "we also have shown that the @xmath44-function term in the scattering amplitude makes the scattering cross section nonzero even in the case of @xmath182 as well as in the case of nonintegral @xmath13 .",
    "it is better to make a comment for the case of integral @xmath13 .",
    "if we regard a change of variables @xmath195 as a gauge transformation for integral @xmath13 , it seems that there is no ab effect for that case .",
    "but it is not true because this causes a change in the strength of the magnetic field at the origin .",
    "furthermore the new wave function is not defined at the origin , which will brake the single - valuedness of the wave function .",
    "we may here refer the same argument for the vector potential given in @xcite , @xcite .",
