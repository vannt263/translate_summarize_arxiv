    "<S> we find that , in general , multiple poles structure of a resonance is a direct mathematical consequence when additional riemann surface is included in the study and the two - pole structure found to correspond to the roper resonance is a good example .    recently , there is a renewal of interest on the existence of complex branch cut and their relevance in the partial wave analysis . </S>",
    "<S> it arises , in large part , from the increasing focus on the properties of the roper and other resonances in @xmath1 channel after the electro - excitation properties of the @xmath2 has been much studied @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> two features in the analysis of @xmath3 channel have received special attention . </S>",
    "<S> namely , the need to include a branch cut starting at the branch point @xmath4 in the complex plane because of the opening of @xmath5 channel and consequently a two - pole structure was found to correspond to the roper resonance .    </S>",
    "<S> the inclusion of complex cuts in the pion - nucleon partial wave analysis has a long history . </S>",
    "<S> this is because pion is light and the inelastic channel @xmath6 appears already at c.m . </S>",
    "<S> energy of @xmath7 mev . </S>",
    "<S> the effect of the three - body channel of @xmath6 is most often treated via coupled - channels approach where the quasi two - body channels like @xmath8 and @xmath9 etc . </S>",
    "<S> are introduced @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it generates naturally branch cuts in the second sheet starting from the quasi two - body inelastic threshold . </S>",
    "<S> however , only the poles reached most directly by analytic continuation from the real axis were looked for in @xcite and only one pole was found to correspond to the roper . </S>",
    "<S> the poles behind the complex branch cuts were first studied in said s pion - nucleon partial - wave analysis @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it was then noticed that there are two poles associated with the roper resonance @xmath10 in the riemann surface of the partial wave amplitude . </S>",
    "<S> it led cutkovsky and wang @xcite to re - examine the previous analysis of @xcite and confirmed that indeed there are two and four nearly degenerate poles at 1470 and 1700 mev , respectively , if poles in other riemann sheets were searched for .    in a recent study @xcite by the ebac ( excited baryon analysis center ) group , </S>",
    "<S> it is demonstrated , via a dynamical coupled - channels model ( jlms ) @xcite that the two almost degenerate poles near the @xmath5 threshold and the next higher mass pole in the @xmath11 channel actually all evolve from a single bare state through its coupling with @xmath12 and @xmath13 reaction channels . </S>",
    "<S> it confirms the previous conjecture that the two - pole structure found in @xcite are indeed associated with the roper resonance . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath5 complex branch cut is not considered in the dynamical models of dubna - mainz - taipei ( dmt ) @xcite and sato - lee @xcite , which were developed in the 1990 s based on a dynamical approach proposed in @xcite , even though @xmath14 degree of freedom is explicitly considered . </S>",
    "<S> this is why only one pole is found to correspond to the roper resonance in the dmt @xmath0 model @xcite .    , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath0 , and @xmath5 with pion mass . </S>",
    "<S> data are from @xcite . ]    </S>",
    "<S> the branch point in the complex plane has been shown to exist using only the general properties of the s matrix @xcite and demonstrated to be important for reliable extraction of resonance parameters . in this short note </S>",
    "<S> , we present a simple heuristic argument to understand the existence of branch points in the unphysical sheet for @xmath0 scattering amplitude . </S>",
    "<S> it is based on a hypothesis that the singularity structure of the @xmath0 scattering amplitude is a smooth varying function of the pion mass , or equivalently the quark masses . </S>",
    "<S> we further point out that the two - pole structure found to correspond to the roper resonance is actually a direct mathematical consequence when additional riemann surface is included in the study and will be a general feature for all resonances when multi - riemann sheets are considered . </S>",
    "<S> + _ existence of complex branch cut in @xmath0 scattering _ </S>",
    "<S> + for simplicity , we illustrate our argument for the existence of complex branch cut in @xmath0 scattering by considering only @xmath0 and @xmath5 channels . </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ lqcd ] shows the lattice qcd s results for the masses of the nucleon ( n ) , @xmath2 , @xmath0 , and @xmath5 , represented by open circles , solid circles , open squares and filled squares , respectively , with pion mass varies from around 1550 mev down to about 300 mev . </S>",
    "<S> the data are from @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> details can be found in a recent review @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the straight lines are shown to guide the eyes only as it is well - known that linear extrapolation is not valid at low pion mass region and chiral extrapolation is called for . in the large pion mass region , say , @xmath15 mev , one always has @xmath16 such that @xmath14 is bound and stable . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , there are two branch cuts , denoted by the wiggly lines , starting at @xmath17 ( denoted by open square ) and @xmath18 ( denoted by filled square ) on the real axis , respectively , as shown in the upper horizontal line , labeled with @xmath19 mev on the left , of fig . [ branch - cut ] .    </S>",
    "<S> it is further seen in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ lqcd ] that as pion mass decreases , both the nucleon and @xmath14 masses decrease as well , but with @xmath20 decreasing at a faster pace . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the lattice data show that both the open and solid circles representing nucleon and @xmath14 masses move closer to @xmath0 threshold as @xmath21 gets smaller . </S>",
    "<S> this is indicated by the arrows on the solid and dashed lines just above the horizontal line labeled with @xmath19 mev in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ branch - cut ] , as pion mass decreases . </S>",
    "<S> eventually lines representing @xmath22 and @xmath17 in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ lqcd ] would cross at around @xmath23 mev and the solid circle representing @xmath14 would move to the right of the open square which corresponds to the branch point of @xmath0 elastic cut . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath14 would then     pole and the @xmath5 branch cut with change of pion mass in the lqcd results if variation w.r.t . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath21 would be smooth . </S>",
    "<S> ]    become unstable and should begin moving into complex plane , as shown by the dashed line connecting @xmath14 on the upper horizontal line and the @xmath14 lying in the complex plane below the lower horizontal line labeled with @xmath24 mev on the left , in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ branch - cut ] . </S>",
    "<S> we have purposedly aligned the two open squares corresponding to the @xmath0 elastic threshold obtained both with @xmath19 and @xmath24 mev to show more clearly how @xmath14 pole moves as pion mass is varied . </S>",
    "<S> the lattice calculation is not sophisticated yet to calculate the width of an unstable particle at present . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ branch - cut ] , an experimental value of @xmath25 mev for the width of the @xmath14 is assumed for the lqcd result if it will become possible to calculate it on the lattice .    </S>",
    "<S> the pole character of the @xmath14 in the @xmath0 scattering amplitude should remain , as generally expected , unchanged after it moves into complex plane , if the singularity structure of the s matrix would vary smoothly with the pion mass . in the same token , the branch point corresponding to the opening of @xmath5 would also move into complex plane and its squared root character should be retained as well . </S>",
    "<S> accordingly , there should exist a branch cut in the complex plane starting from @xmath26 , which is complex when the value of @xmath21 goes down to 140 mev , as indicated in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ branch - cut ] . </S>",
    "<S> + _ multiple poles structure of a resonance with two riemann sheets _ + as the mass of the roper resonance lies close to the @xmath5 threshold , it is natural to expect that it is important to include the @xmath5 branch cut in the extraction of the properties of the roper as demonstrated in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the inclusion of the @xmath5 branch cut in the partial wave analysis in @xmath3 has led to the conclusion @xcite that there are two almost degenerate poles corresponding to the roper , one on the unphysical sheet directly reachable from the real axis and the other located just behind the @xmath5 cut . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate in the followings that such a two - pole structure is actually a direct mathematical consequence when there are two riemann sheets to be considered .    </S>",
    "<S> the structure of riemann surface with two branch cuts of squared root nature present depends on whether they appear in product or additive form , namely , like @xmath27 or @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> it is known @xcite that in the case of the product type like @xmath27 , only two riemann sheets are needed to make it a single - valued function . </S>",
    "<S> the riemann surface in this case is often represented by drawing a cut connecting the two branch points @xmath29 and @xmath30 . however , if the two branch points appear in additive form like @xmath28 , then four riemann sheets are required to make it a single - valued function . </S>",
    "<S> since the branch points in the pion - nucleon scattering arise from the opening of inelastic channels in the intermediate states , the branch points will appear in additive manner . </S>",
    "<S> accordingly , we will discuss only the case where two branch cuts appear in additive form .    </S>",
    "<S> a simple example where we have a pole at @xmath31 in the presence of two additive branch cuts , both of squared root nature , would be a function of the following form , @xmath32 where @xmath33 is an arbitrary function . </S>",
    "<S> as mentioned in the above , we need a riemann surface consisting of four sheets to make @xmath34 a single - valued function , with two cuts starting from @xmath29 and @xmath35 . </S>",
    "<S> it is then a simple mathematical exercise to see that the pole @xmath31 would appear in all four sheets . </S>",
    "<S> the residues at these four poles would all be equal if @xmath33 is an analytical function .    </S>",
    "<S> for a slightly more complicated case like , @xmath36 where @xmath37 is an arbitrary function , the pole now appears at @xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> this could occur if @xmath33 in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ f1 ] ) behaves like @xmath39 around @xmath40 . at first sight </S>",
    "<S> , one would think that we need eight riemann sheets to make @xmath41 single - valued , since there are now three branch points at @xmath42 and 0 . </S>",
    "<S> however , a closer analysis @xcite would lead to the conclusion that only four riemann sheets are needed and the pole @xmath38 would appear only in two sheets . </S>",
    "<S> the residues at these two poles would be , in general , different , even if @xmath37 is an analytical function .    in the dmt @xmath0 model </S>",
    "<S> , the contribution of a resonance @xmath43 to the t - matrix takes the form @xcite , @xmath44 where @xmath45 and @xmath46 describe the bare and dressed vertices of @xmath47 , and @xmath48 and @xmath49 denote the bare mass and the complex self - energy of resonance @xmath43 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> both @xmath46 and @xmath49 receive dressing from the background potential which would contain information related to the branch cuts associated with the background mechanisms . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , the function @xmath33 or @xmath37 could contain factors pertaining to the squared root branch cuts like @xmath50 and @xmath51 </S>",
    "<S> . nevertheless , the conclusions we have obtained for cases ( a ) and ( b ) concerning the multiplicity of the resonance pole remain unchanged except that the residues will now all be different , even in the case of ( a ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the conclusions we obtain in the above concerning the multiplicity of the resonance pole are consistent with the results obtained in @xcite from @xmath11 partial wave analysis and the subsequent analytical continuation . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the findings in @xcite that there were two sets of two almost degenerate poles and one set of four almost degenerate poles , all with different residues can be readily understood by our simple mathematical analysis .    in summary , we have presented a simple heuristic argument to understand the existence of branch points in the unphysical sheet for @xmath0 scattering amplitude . </S>",
    "<S> the reasoning is based on a hypothesis that the singularity structure of the @xmath0 scattering amplitude is a smooth varying function of the pion mass . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the two - pole structure found to correspond to the roper resonance is actually a direct mathematical consequence when additional riemann surface is included in the study . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , our analysis indicates that there are always multiple poles , either two or four , to be associated with a resonance . </S>",
    "<S> the physical significance of the poles lying in sheets not directly reachable from the physical sheet remains to be further investigated and established . </S>"
