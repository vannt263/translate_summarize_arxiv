    "the self  avoiding walk ( saw ) is a random walk that must not contain self  intersections .",
    "it has been extensively studied as a challenging problem in statistical physics , and , in particular , as a satisfactory model of a linear polymer chain @xcite .",
    "the pure saw is a good model for perfectly flexible polymer , where we ignore the apparent rigidity of real polymer , and , consequently , to each step of saw we associate the same weight factor ( fugacity ) @xmath7 . in most real cases , the polymers are semiflexible with the various degree of stiffness . to take into account this property of polymers , in the continuous space models the stiffness of the saw path",
    "is modeled by constraining the angle between the consecutive bonds of polymer , while in the lattice models , an energy barrier for each bend of the saw is introduced .",
    "the lattice semiflexible saw model ( also known as persistent or biased saw model ) , has been studied some time ago in a series of papers @xcite , with a focus on the so - called rod - to - coil crossover .",
    "afterwards , it was modified in various ways , in order to describe relevant aspects of different phenomena , such as protein folding @xcite , adsorption of semiflexible homopolymers @xcite , transition between the disordered globule and the crystalline polymer phase @xcite , behavior of semiflexible polymers in confined spaces @xcite , or influence of an external force on polymer systems @xcite .    in spite of numerous studies ,",
    "a scanty collection of exact results for semiflexible polymers has been achieved so far , even for the simplest lattice models .",
    "a few cases in which some properties of semiflexible saw can be studied exactly are : directed semiflexible saws on regular lattices @xcite , and semiflexible saws ( with no constraints on the direction ) on some fractal lattices @xcite . in particular ,",
    "exact values of the end - to - end critical exponent @xmath5 and the entropic exponent @xmath6 were obtained for these models , and it turned out that in some cases critical exponents are universal , whereas in other cases they depend on the stiffness of the polymer chain .",
    "universality arguments , as well as results of approximate and extrapolation methods for similar models suggest that critical exponents on regular ( euclidean ) lattices should not be affected by the value of the polymer stiffness .",
    "on the other hand , it is not known what are the effects of rigidity on the critical behavior of saws in nonhomogeneous environment . in order to explore further this issue , in this paper we perform the relevant study on the infinite family of the plane - filling ( pf ) fractal lattices @xcite , which allow for an exact treatment of the problem .",
    "these fractals appear to be compact , that is , their fractal dimension @xmath0 is equal to 2 .",
    "members of the family can be enumerated by an odd integer @xmath1 ( @xmath8 ) , and as @xmath9 characteristics of these fractals approach , via the so - called fractal  to - euclidean crossover @xcite , properties of the regular 2d lattice . by applying the exact real - space renormalization group ( rg ) method @xcite , as well as monte carlo renormalization group ( mcrg ) method @xcite",
    ", we calculate critical exponents @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "we have performed our calculations for as many as possible members of the fractal family , for various degree of polymer stiffness , in order to study consequent stiffness dependence of the critical exponents , as well as to see the asymptotic behavior of the exponents in the fractal  to  euclidean crossover region .",

    "in this section we are going to apply the exact rg and the mcrg method to calculate asymptotic properties of semiflexible polymer chains on the pf fractal lattices .",
    "each member of the pf fractal family is labelled by an odd integer @xmath1 ( @xmath10 ) , and can be constructed in stages . at the initial stage ( @xmath11 ) the lattices",
    "are represented by the corresponding generators ( see fig .",

    "the @xmath12th stage fractal structure can be obtained iteratively in a self - similar way , that is , by enlarging the generator by a factor @xmath13 and by replacing each of its segments with the @xmath14th stage structure , so that the complete fractal is obtained in the limit @xmath15 .",
    "the shape of the fractal generators and the way the fractals are constructed imply that each member of the family has the fractal dimension @xmath0 equal to 2 .",

    "the full dots represent the turn points of the walker ( that is , the bends of the saw path ) , to which we associate the boltzmann factor @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the energy of saw bend .",

    "if we assign the weight @xmath7 to each step of the saw , then the weight of a walk having @xmath30 steps , with @xmath31 bends , is @xmath32 , and consequently , the general form of the saw generating function can be written as @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the number of @xmath30step saws having @xmath31 bends . for large @xmath30",
