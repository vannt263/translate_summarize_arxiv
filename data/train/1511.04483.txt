    "if @xmath180 , a mock grb is recognized as detectable . otherwise , the mock grb is excluded .",
    "repeat the above steps to obtain a sample of 450 grbs .    as described above",
    ", we only choose the luminous mock bursts for analysis to reduce the selection effects and also consider two sub - samples ( i.e. , ( s1 ) the sub - sample with @xmath8 and @xmath9 erg @xmath10 and ( s2 ) the sub - sample with @xmath12 and @xmath13 erg @xmath10 ) to explore the dependence of our results on a possible bias in the high-_z _ bursts . using the @xmath3 statistic , the constraints on the @xmath0-@xmath4 plane from the cumulative redshift distribution of the s1 sub - sample are presented in fig .",
    "these contours show that at the @xmath5 confidence level , we have @xmath181 , and @xmath182 .",
    "the constraints on these two parameters from the s2 sub - sample are also shown in fig .",
    "as the results we find in the current @xmath1 grb observations , adding the high-_z _ @xmath11 mock grbs could result in much tighter constraints on @xmath0 and relatively higher values of @xmath4 and @xmath0 .",
    "the contours show that @xmath183 yr mission of @xmath184 ( using the s2 sub - sample ) would be sufficient to rule out @xmath185 and @xmath186 models at the @xmath5 confidence level .",
    "the evolutionary index is constrained to be @xmath187 ( @xmath5 ) . from these results , it is evident that as the sample size increases , the constraints on @xmath0 and @xmath4 become tighter than the current constraints using the @xmath1 sample .",
    "using the hierarchical structure formation scenario , the csfr can be built in a self - consistent way . in particular , from the hierarchical scenario we can obtain the baryon accretion rate that governs the size of the reservoir of baryons available for star formation in dark matter halos .",
    "it is important to note that the minimum halo mass @xmath0 plays an important role in star formation , because first stars can only form in structures that are suitably dense .",
    "star formation will be suppressed when the halo mass is below @xmath0 .",
    "the connection of lgrbs with the collapse of massive stars has provided a good opportunity for probing star formation in dark matter halos .    in this paper , the numerical value of @xmath0 is constrained using the latest @xmath1 grb data .",
    "we conservatively consider that the lgrb rate is proportional to the csfr and an additional evolution parametrized as @xmath2 . in order to reduce the sample selection effects",
    ", we adopt a model - independent approach by selecting only luminous grbs above a fixed luminosity limit , as @xcite did in their treatment .",
    "this approach has two advantages .",
    "firstly , the reliable statistics of the latest lgrb data allow the use of luminosity cuts to fairly compare grbs in the full redshift range , eliminating the unknown grb luminosity function .",
    "secondly , by simply normalizing the cumulative redshift distribution of grbs to the full redshift range , the constant stands for the grb efficiency factor can be removed .    for each model ( @xmath0 , @xmath4 )",
    ", we can calculate the expected cumulative redshift distribution .",
    "the confidence limits in the @xmath0-@xmath4 plane can be constructed by fitting the observed cumulative redshift distribution , using the @xmath3 statistic .",
    "our results show that at the @xmath5 confidence level , we obtain @xmath6 @xmath7 from 118 _ swift _ grbs with @xmath8 and @xmath9 erg @xmath10 .",
    "we also find that adding 12 high-_z _",
    "@xmath11 grbs ( comprised of 104 grbs with @xmath12 and @xmath13 erg @xmath10 ) could result in much tighter constraints on @xmath0 , for which , @xmath14 at the @xmath5 confidence level . through monte carlo simulations , we find that the constraints on @xmath0 and @xmath4 can be much improved by enlarging the sample size .",
    "the simulations show that the future @xmath184 5-yr observations would tighten these constraints to @xmath15 at the @xmath5 confidence level .",
    "previously , with a minimum halo mass of @xmath21 and a moderate outflow efficiency , @xcite could reproduce both the fraction of baryons in the structures at the present time and the early chemical enrichment of the intergalactic medium . by analysing the star formation history ,",
    "@xcite set a strong constraint on the minimum halo mass : @xmath22 .",
    "@xcite also suggested that the halo mass at which star formation is suppressed can be limited by matching the observed galaxy luminosity distribution , in which @xmath0 was constrained to be @xmath188 at the @xmath161 confidence level . in the present paper , we propose that @xmath0 can also be constrained using the redshift distribution of _ swift _ grbs , and we obtain some limits on @xmath0 , namely @xmath14 ( @xmath5 ) , which are consistent with the previous results obtained using both the current baryon fraction and the early chemical enrichment of the intergalactic medium , the star formation history , and the galaxy luminosity function .",
    "although the future @xmath184 5-yr observations would tighten these constraints to @xmath15 ( @xmath5 ) , the lower limit value of @xmath0 is above the upper limit given by @xcite , and well above the values of @xcite .",
    "the strong constraints we derived here indicate that lgrbs are a new promising tool for probing star formation in dark matter halos . of course",
    ", if we know the mechanism responsible for the difference between the lgrb rate and the csfr , we can constrain the minimum mass very accurately using the lgrb data alone and the utility of lgrbs would be further enhanced .",
    "apart from the obvious approach of increasing the sample size of lgrbs in the future , we predict that the constraints on @xmath0 will also be significantly improved by including different types of observational data , such as the data of star formation history , galaxy luminosity distribution , and grb redshift distribution .",
