    "+ [ 5 mm ] in the absence of an external field ( @xmath10 ) , the ground state of the model is a singlet ( @xmath11 ) state with momentum @xmath12 , where @xmath13 for @xmath14 and @xmath15 for @xmath16 .",
    "this statement holds at least in the interval @xmath17 . at @xmath18",
    "the model reduces to the majumdar ghosh model @xcite with degenerate dimer ground states .",
    "+ the quantum numbers of the first excited state change with @xmath9 : there is a triplet @xmath19 state for @xmath20 and a singlet @xmath21 state for @xmath22 .",
    "the momentum of the first excited state is @xmath23 .",
    "moreover there is no gap in the spinfluid phase and a gap in the dimer phase @xmath24 .",
    "the structure of these two phases can be exploited by means of the static and dynamical correlation functions of appropriate operators . in the spinfluid phase",
    "@xmath25 the @xmath26 operator @xmath27 generates the transition from the singlet to the triplet excited state . to examine the dimer phase @xmath24",
    "we need a @xmath28 operator .",
    "these transitions are generated by the dimer operator @xmath29 the corresponding static structure factors @xmath30 behave as follows for @xmath31 : + @xmath32 diverges logarithmically for @xmath33 but stays finite for @xmath24 .",
    "+ @xmath34 diverges with a power depending on @xmath9 for @xmath35 and stays finite for @xmath36 .",
    "the power behaviour degenerates to a logarithmic behaviour for @xmath37 .",
    "+ [ 5 mm ] in the presence of an external field @xmath5 the ground state of the model has total spin @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the magnetization .",

    "+ the momentum of the ground state @xmath51 follows marshall s sign rule @xcite : @xmath52 for @xmath53 .",
    "+ the singularities in the static structure factors change , if we switch on an external field : the transverse structure factor at @xmath54 @xmath55 diverges with a field dependent critical exponent @xmath1 .",
    "@xmath56 has been calculated in ref . by means of the bethe ansatz . a second",
    ", weaker singularity , which moves with the external field appears at the softmode momentum @xmath57 . to our knowledge ,",
    "the positions of both singularities do not depend on @xmath9 .",
    "the critical exponent @xmath58 however does .",
    "it has been found to be @xcite @xmath59 the longitudinal structure factor at @xmath60 ( @xmath61 ) stays finite for @xmath62 but develops a singularity at the field dependent softmode momentum @xmath63 : @xmath64 again , the position of the singularity does not depend on @xmath9 , whereas the critical exponent @xmath0 changes drastically with @xmath9 : @xmath65 the soft mode singularity at @xmath66 is also found in the dimer structure factor @xmath67 defined in ( [ a3 ] ) and ( [ a4 ] ) . a finite size analysis of the type ( [ a11 ] ) for @xmath67 yields for the critical exponents @xcite : @xmath68 these values almost coincide with those of the longitudinal structure factor given in ( [ a12 ] ) .",
    "+ it is the purpose of this paper to determine the complete @xmath9 dependence of the critical exponents @xmath69 . + the paper is organized as follows : + in section 2 we exploit the range of validity of marshall s sign rule ( [ a8 ] ) . in section 3",
    "we study the impact of the next to nearest neighbour coupling on the lowlying excitations and on the static structure factors .",
    "the latter are computed numerically on systems up to @xmath70 .",
    "a finite size analysis of ( [ a9 ] ) and ( [ a11 ] ) yields the critical exponents @xmath69 .",
    "section 4 is devoted to the study of an unexpected phenomenon , which we found for negative @xmath9-values : for @xmath71 the finite size behaviour of the longitudinal structure factor ( [ a11 ] ) changes systematically from a monotonic increase to a decrease .",
    "it was pointed out in the introduction that the momenta @xmath72 of the ground state @xmath73 in the sectors with total spin @xmath74 follow marshall s sign rule for @xmath75 .",
    "we found deviations from this rule for @xmath76 we computed the ground state energies @xmath77 on small systems with @xmath78 sites .",

    "+ a twofold degeneracy - with respect to the ground state momenta @xmath83 emerges along the whole curve @xmath84 , which is plotted for n=10,12,14,16,18,20 in fig.2 + the first momentum @xmath85 follows marshall s sign rule ( [ a8 ] ) .",
    "we have looked for an empirical rule for the second momentum @xmath86 but we did not find such a rule which holds for all momenta and system sizes @xmath87 .",
    "+ in the saturating field limit @xmath42 the curve @xmath88 meets the point @xmath89 indeed , the eigenvalue problem can be solved analytically for @xmath90 with the ansatz ( 1 magnon states ) @xmath91 where @xmath92 denotes a spin state with spin @xmath93 at site @xmath94 and spin @xmath7 at all other sites .",
    "the energy of the 1 magnon state is found to be : @xmath95 the ground state energy and its momentum @xmath96 follows by minimizing ( [ b7 ] ) with respect to @xmath97 .",
    "for @xmath98 the ground state momentum is found to be @xmath99 in accord with marshall s sign rule .",
    "for @xmath100 however , the minimum is found for @xmath101 where @xmath102 on finite lattices , the difference between the two momenta turns out to be : @xmath103 + as a consequence of the levelcrossing at @xmath104 , @xmath105 fixed , the derivatives of the ground state energies @xmath106 change discontinuously , as can be seen in an amplification of fig .",
    "we have studied the finite - size dependence of the energy gaps @xmath108 for @xmath28 and @xmath26 in the domain @xmath109 where the ground state momentum follows marshall s sign rule . in this regime",
    "the gap @xmath110 vanishes in the thermodynamical limit in such a way that the scaled quantity @xmath111 converges to a finite non - vanishing limit .",
    "the same holds for the gap @xmath112 , @xmath113 , if the next to nearest neighbour coupling @xmath9 is positive : @xmath114 for negative @xmath9-values ( @xmath115 ) however , we observe a tendency in the numerical data , which at least hints to the emergence of a gap at the momentum @xmath66 : @xmath116 as can be seen from fig .",
    "it is hard to decide from the finite system results ( @xmath117 ) the exact position @xmath118 where the gap ( [ c4a ] ) opens .",
    "+ in the gapless regimes , where ( [ c3 ] ) and ( [ c4 ] ) is valid , we expect that the critical behaviour of the system is properly described by conformal field theory .",
    "this means in particular that the ratios [ - ] @xmath119 can be identified with the critical exponents @xmath120 : @xmath121 here @xmath122 is the spinwave velocity . for fixed values of @xmath105 @xmath123 we have determined the @xmath9-dependence of @xmath124 from the energy differences ( [ c1 ] ) ( [ c7 ] ) as they enter in the ratios ( [ c5 ] ) .",
    "the result can be seen from the solid curves in figs 4a , b , c .",
    "the solid dots represent the determination of the critical exponents @xmath125 as they follow from a fit of the form ( [ a9 ] ) , ( [ a11 ] ) to the finite system results ( @xmath126 ) . comparing the two determinations we come to the following conclusions :    1 .",
    "the identity @xmath127 for the critical exponent in the transverse structure factor is well established for @xmath128 .",
    "+ the same holds for the identity @xmath129 for the critical exponent in the longitudinal structure factor in the interval @xmath130 .",
    "if we approach the curve @xmath84 the convergence of the lanczos algorithm slows down more and more , due to the emergence of the level - crossing discussed in section 2 . 2 .   the two curves @xmath131 , @xmath132 cross each other at @xmath133 @xmath134 where @xmath135 and @xmath136 the @xmath9-values are quite close to the transition point @xmath137 from the spinfluid to the dimer phase .",
    "the same holds for the critical exponents @xmath138 , which deviate only slightly from @xmath139 .",
    "3 .   the relation @xmath140 appears to be satisfied within a few percent for @xmath141 .",
    "4 .   for negative values of @xmath9",
    ", we observe in the data for @xmath0 a discontinuous structure ( open symbols ) .",
    "looking at the numerical data , which enter in the determination of @xmath0 via eq .",
    "( [ a11 ] ) , we found a systematic change in the finite size dependence .",
    "for @xmath142 @xmath143 the longitudinal structure factor monotonically increases with @xmath87 , whereas it decreases for @xmath144 . in the latter regime",
    "we expect the emergence of the gap ( [ c4a ] ) .",
    "the change in the finite size dependence of the gap ( [ c4 ] , [ c4a ] ) and of @xmath145 provides us with a first hint , that the field dependent softmode at @xmath63 might disappear for @xmath146 . in this section",
    ", we are looking for further evidence for this hypothesis . in figs 5a , b we compare the momentum distribution of @xmath147 for @xmath148 and @xmath149 , respectively . at @xmath150 ( fig 5a ) the momentum distribution",
    "is well approximated by two straight lines with different slopes for @xmath151 and @xmath152 , respectively .",
    "this discontinuity is more and more washed out , if the next to nearest neighbour coupling decreases further .",
    "e.g. at @xmath153 ( fig 5b ) the @xmath97-distribution of the longitudinal structure factor appears to be smooth in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the approach to this limit is indicated by an arrow .",
    "@xmath154 is monotonically decreasing with @xmath87 for @xmath155 but increasing for @xmath152 . +",
    "a more drastic effect can be seen in the dynamical structure factor : @xmath156 which we computed by means of the recursion method @xcite @xcite for @xmath157 and @xmath158 .",
    "the excitation spectrum is plotted in figs 6 a , b for @xmath159 and @xmath153 , respectively .",
    "the numbers denote the corresponding relative spectral weight in percentage terms .",
    "the curves guide the eye to the excitations with dominant spectral weight . for @xmath159 ( fig 5 a ) the spectral weight",
    "is distributed over a band of excitation energies which broadens in the vicinity of the momentum @xmath66 . for @xmath153 ( fig 5b ) , however , the spectral weight is more concentrated at higher excitation energies . in particular , the lowest excitation at @xmath66 has a relative spectral weight less than @xmath160 for @xmath158 .",
    "in this paper , we studied the impact of a next to nearest neighbour coupling @xmath9 and an external field @xmath5 on the zero temperature properties of the one dimensional spin @xmath7 antiferromagnetic heisenberg model .",
    "we found the following features :    1 .",
    "the momentum of the ground state follows marshall s sign rule ( [ a8 ] ) for @xmath161 where @xmath162 and @xmath163 .",
    "the ground state is twofold degenerate with respect to its momentum for @xmath84 2 .",
    "a study of the finite size dependence ( [ a9 ] ) and ( [ a11 ] ) yields the @xmath9-dependence of the critical exponents @xmath125 associated with the softmode singularities at @xmath60 and @xmath66 in the transverse and longitudinal structure factor , respectively .",
    "good agreement is found with the prediction ( [ c5 ] ) , ( [ c6 ] ) of conformal field theory for @xmath164 and for @xmath165 ( figs 4a - c ) .",
    "for these @xmath9-values the spectral weight  entering into the definition of the corresponding dynamical structure factors ( [ d1 ] )  is concentrated around the lower bound of the excitation spectrum .",
    "this seems to be a crucial condition in order that the critical behaviour is described correctly by conformal field theory . in the thermodynamical limit the dynamical structure factors @xmath166 and @xmath167 develop infrared singularities @xmath168 , which can clearly be seen in a finite size scaling analysis .",
    "such an analysis was performed in ref . for @xmath43 .",
    "deviations from the relation ( [ c7 ] )  predicted by conformal field theory  appear in the longitudinal case @xmath169 ( figs 4a - c ) for negative values of the next to nearest neighbour coupling and increasing @xmath105-values .",
    "this is accompanied by the fact that the spectral weight in ( [ d1 ] ) is distributed over a band of excitation energies , which broadens with decreasing values of @xmath9 .",
    "there are several indications that the field dependent soft mode at @xmath170 disappears for negative next to nearest neighbour couplings @xmath171 : a gap ( [ c4a ] ) opens and the longitudinal structure factor ( [ a11 ] ) changes its finite size dependence from a monotonic increase to a decrease .",
    "moreover the cusp - like singularity in the momentum dependence at @xmath66 is washed out and the spectral weight is shifted from low to higher excitation energies .",
    "+ therefore , we find a further confirmation of the hypothesis  formulated in ref .",
    " namely that field dependent soft modes only exist if the system is sufficiently frustrated . as was pointed out in ref .",
    "this condition is not satisfied in the twodimensional spin @xmath7 antiferromagnetic heisenberg model with nearest neighbour coupling .",
