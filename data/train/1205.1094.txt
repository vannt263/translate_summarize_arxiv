    "operators for the macroscopically occupied condensate mode are replaced by @xmath35-numbers , i.e. , @xmath36 .",

    "( [ k ] ) using the bogoliubov transformation .",
    "the details are described in appendix  [ a2 ] .      using the modified bogoliubov method outlined in the previous section , in principle we can find all the stationary states ( not just the ground state ) and their excitation spectrum for any modulated atomic interactions .",
    "this provides a more thorough picture of the energy landscape of the system and deeper insights into possbile quantum phase transitions induced when certain parameters are varied ( in our case , the modulation depth of the interaction strength @xmath60 ) .",
    "our goal is to study the mean field quantum phase transition for different modulation period @xmath13 as the modulation depth @xmath60 is varied .",
    "we concentrate on the low - energy states , meaning stationary states with energy close to that of the ground state .",
    "we find that there are mainly two types of stationary states in the low energy regime .",

    "by taking advantage of the modified bogoliubov method , we investigate the critical point of the quantum phase transitions and the prime mechanism driving such quantum phase transitions for arbitrary modulation period @xmath13 .",
    "we find that there is a fundamental difference between @xmath3 and @xmath64 .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows the energies and chemcial potentials of low - energy bose condensate states by varying the parameter @xmath65 for @xmath3 . for small @xmath60 ,",
    "the ground state is a symmetric state .",

    "similar to the @xmath3 case , for small @xmath60 , the ground state is symmetric .",
    "as @xmath60 is increased , a symmetry - breaking phase transition occurs at a critical value of @xmath68 .",
    "however , unlike in the @xmath3 case , at this critical point , the symmetric state remains dynamically stable although the energy of the asymmetric state drops below that of the symmetric state .",
    "furthermore , the ground state energy curve as a function of @xmath60 shows a kink at this critical value , while the ground state chemical potential becomes discontinuous at this point .",
    "therefore , the phase transition at this point is of first order .",
    "the dynamical instability of the symmetric state does not occur until @xmath69 .    to summarize our mean - field results ,",
    "we have found that the nature of the phase transitions changes for different modulation period @xmath13 due to the presence of competing mechanisms in this system . when the modulation period @xmath3 , the symmetry - breaking phase transition is of second order and is induced by dynamical instability of the associated states . for @xmath67 , in contrast ,",
    "the symmetric - breaking phase transition is of first order and is driven by the level crossing of different types of states .",
    "we have also investigated the cases for @xmath70 and 5 and found similar behavior as in @xmath67 .",
    "so far , we have limited our discussion to the mean - field approximation .",
    "now we perform a fully quantum mechanical examination of the system using a numerical method . in our previous work @xcite , exact diagonalization",
    "is used for this purpose . here , we will use the tebd algorithm @xcite .",
    "this has a two - fold advantage compared to the exact diagonalization method : ( 1 ) it allows us to treat larger systems ; and ( 2 ) in addition to the static properties , we can also use the tebd method to study the dynamical behavior of the system .",
    "we first discretize the space by introducing an equidistant grid @xmath71 , @xmath72 .",
    "we then replace the field operator @xmath73 by @xmath74 , where @xmath75 is a bosonic annihilation operator . in doing so",
    ", integrals can be replaced by sums and the second derivative in the kinetic energy term can be approximated by the difference quotient @xmath76 /\\delta",
    "\\theta ^2 $ ] .",
    "finally , the discretized hamiltonian is @xcite :    @xmath77    here , the periodic boundary condition leads to the relation @xmath78 . for tebd algorithm with periodic boundary condition , we refer to ref .  @xcite . in our numerical treatment",
    ", we typically divide the ring into @xmath79 equidistant grids .",
    "our code is adapted from the open source package maintained by the group of lincoln carr @xcite .      in fig .",
    "[ energy ] , we plot the ground - state energy per atom of the many - body system as functions of @xmath60 for the modulation period @xmath3 and @xmath67 .",
    "we see that the ground - state energy curve approaches the mft result as @xmath6 increases , which is consistent with the usual quantum - semiclassical crossover behavior for finite - size quantum systems .      in the quantum mechanical treatment , unlike the mean field results , the spontaneous symmetry breaking of density distribution of ground state wavefunction in real space dose not occur .",
    "the density profile of the quantum mechanical ground state always matches the spatial modulation of the scattering length @xcite .",
    "however , we can still gain important insights into the change in the characteristics of the wavefunctions by examining the quantum correlation which is neglected in the mean - field study .    for further discussion , we define the partial number operator between the interval @xmath80 $ ] as : @xmath81 } = \\frac 1{2\\pi } \\int_{\\varphi _ i}^{\\varphi _ f}d\\theta \\,\\widehat{\\psi } ^{\\dagger } \\left ( \\theta \\right ) \\widehat{\\psi } \\left ( \\theta \\right ) .\\ ] ]    for the particular case of @xmath67 , we define three partial particle number operators as follows : @xmath82 } , \\quad i=1,2,3.\\ ] ] using these number operators , we can define the bipartite and tripartite correlation functions as : @xmath83    we plot the bipartite and tripartite correlations as functions of @xmath60 in fig .",
    "all these correlations are monotonically decreasing functions of @xmath60 . in our calculation , the three two - body correlation functions @xmath84 , @xmath85 and @xmath86 are essentially identical , which is also expected from the symmetry of the system . at @xmath87",
    ", the ground state is exactly known : @xmath88 .",
    "the theoretical values of bipartite and tripartite correlations can be obtained as : @xmath89 which are in good agreement with the numerical results .",
    "when @xmath6 goes to infinity , all the bipartite and tripartite correlations approach unity at @xmath87 .",
    "figure  [ corr ] shows that although both bipartite and tripartite correlations decay as the interaction parameter @xmath60 increases , the tirpartitle correlation @xmath90 decays into zero much faster than the bipartitle correlation @xmath91 . for the case of @xmath92 as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ corr ] , @xmath93 is essentially zero at @xmath94 , while all the @xmath95 are clearly non - zero at the same @xmath60 .",
    "this is reminiscent of the three - body entangled @xmath96-state , which can be written as @xmath97 for the @xmath96-state , the tripartite entanglement characterized by the 3-tangle disappears and the bipartite entanglement characterized by concurrence remains finite @xcite . for large @xmath60 ,",
    "our mean - field treatment presented earlier reveals that the ground state is characterized by asysmmetric state with three - fold degeneracy .",
    "each of these degenerate mean - field state features a density peak at @xmath98 ( @xmath99 ) . in the quantum treatment , this degeneracy is lifted by quantum fluctuations , and the non - degenerate quantum ground state may be regarded as roughly a @xmath96-state formed by these three mean - field states .",
    "another important quantity to characterize the many - body state is the single - particle density matrix @xmath100 whose matrix element is defined as @xcite : @xmath101 where the expectation value is calculated with respect to the ground state obtained using the tebd method . roughly speaking",
    ", @xmath102 represents the probability amplitude of finding one particle at site @xmath103 and at the same time another particle at site @xmath104 .",
    "because the matrix @xmath105 is hermitian it can be diagonalized as : @xmath106 where the eigenvalues @xmath107 are non - negative and satisfy the constraint @xmath108 . for a bosonic system with @xmath24 , @xmath107",
    "is closely related to the condensate fraction of the system .",
    "it is easy to see that , the system will be in a simple condensate state if and only if the largest eigenvaule is of order unity and all the other @xmath109 s are of order @xmath110 .",
    "if there are multiple @xmath107 s of order unity , the system is said to be in a fragmented condensate because all the corresponding states have appreciable occupation numbers .",
    "finally , if all the @xmath107 s are of order @xmath110 , then the system is not bose condensed .",
    "it is reasonable to speculate that , at small @xmath6 , the condensate fraction versus the strength parameter @xmath60 exhibits quantum crossover behavior . for @xmath92 with the modulation periods @xmath3 and @xmath67",
    ", we plot the three largest @xmath107 s versus @xmath60 in fig .  [ fig5 ] .",
    "the figure shows that at small @xmath60 , the system may be characterized as a simple condensate .",
    "it becomes more and more fragmented as @xmath60 is increased . in the large @xmath60 limit ,",
    "the eigenvalues approach some steady state values and there are @xmath13 eigenvalues which are much larger than the rest .",
    "this is consistent with the earlier argument that at large @xmath60 , the quantum many - body ground state can be roughly regarded as superpositions of the @xmath13-fold degenerate mean - field ground states .    to further quantify the crossover from a simple condensate to a fragmented condensate",
    ", we adopt two methods as described below . in fig .",
    "[ fig6](a ) , we plot @xmath111 as a function of @xmath60 , where @xmath112 is the largest single - particle density matrix eigenvalue . in fig .",
    "[ fig6](b ) , we plot the overlap of the ground - state wave function @xcite @xmath113 for a small value of @xmath114 , where @xmath115 denotes the ground state at @xmath60 . both of these quantities measure how fast the characteristics of the ground state change as @xmath60 is varied .",
    "these two measures provide consistent results : both exhibit a dip at some critical value @xmath116 for @xmath3 and @xmath117 for @xmath67 , which we may define as the critical modulation depth where the system crosses from a simple condensate to a fragmented condensate .      up to now",
    ", we have focused our attention on the static properties of the ground state .",
    "the low - energy excitations of the system in the vicinity of the crossover are also important because they expose fine characteristics valuable for understanding the system dynamics in the crossover . a powerful tool to study this is the time evolution of ground state survival probability @xcite .",
    "it describes the dynamical behavior of the system s ground state under small perturbation in parameters in the system hamiltonian . in our problem , we parameterize the hamiltonian using the interaction strength modulation depth @xmath60 such that @xmath118 . if @xmath60 has a small variation @xmath119 so that @xmath120 , the ground state s survival probablity is defined as @xmath121 the survival probability can be considered as a special case of the quantum loschmidt echo @xcite .",
    "incidentally , the numerical method we used to simulate our system , the tebd algorithm , is very convenient in calculating the system s time evolution and hence the survival probability .",
    "we calculated the ground state survival probability @xmath122 and plot the results in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] for @xmath92 and the perturbation in @xmath60 is @xmath123 .",
    "@xmath122 exhibits roughly sinusoidal oscillations in time .",
    "the amplitude of the modulation reaches the maximum near critical points which are consistent with those found in previous static study and shown in fig .  [ fig6 ] .",
    "indeed , the curve for the oscillation amplitude of the ground state s survival probability can be used to predict the overlap between the perturbed and original ground state wave functions which is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig6](b ) .",
    "the larger the oscillation amplitude in @xmath122 , the more sensitive the ground state wavefunction to the perturbation in the hamiltonian .",
    "in conclusion , we have made a systematic investigation of a condensate on a nonlinear ring lattice .",
    "our studies show that the properties of the system are sensitive to the modulation period @xmath13 of the interaction strength . in particular ,",
    "the meanfield symmetry breaking phase transition is second order when the modulation period @xmath13 is 2 but first order when @xmath124 , due to competing mechanisms present in the system driving these transitions .",
    "our full quantum mechanical treatment based on the tebd method reveals the behavior of many important quantities that are essential to the characterization of the system physics .",
    "that the mean - field symmetry breaking phase transition changes from second to first order when @xmath13 changes from 2 to larger than 2 is somewhat surprising .",
    "the change of the order of the phase transition may be related to the change of the length scale associated with the modulation of the scattering length : for @xmath125 , this length scale is smaller compared with @xmath126 .",
    "recently , mayteevarunyoo et al . studied the symmetry breaking transition in a bec subject to a nonlinear double - well potential and found that the width of the nonlinear potential plays an important role in controlling the transition @xcite , a phenomenon that may be related to what we discovered in the current work .",
