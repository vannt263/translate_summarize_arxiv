    "<S> this performance is reached by optimizing two aspects of the fabrication . </S>",
    "<S> first , the substrate surface is treated with hexamethyldisilazane ( hmds ) immediately prior to metal deposition to reduce losses associated with the metal - substrate interface . </S>",
    "<S> second , we employ highly anisotropic deep reactive - ion etching ( drie ) of the substrate to displace lossy substrate - vacuum interfaces away from regions of high electric field . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain the best performance by combining both techniques , reaching @xmath12 in the quantum regime .    </S>",
    "<S> resonator fabrication starts with surface preparation of high - resistivity ( @xmath13 ) si @xmath14100@xmath15 substrates for deposition of the superconducting film . </S>",
    "<S> we choose nbtin as the superconductor for its high - quality metal - vacuum interface  @xcite . because we define the resonators via etching of the metal film rather than lift - off </S>",
    "<S> , we can apply surface treatments immediately prior to metal deposition to optimize the substrate - metal interface . </S>",
    "<S> the substrate surface quality depends on its physical condition ( e.g. , roughness ) , chemical composition ( e.g. , presence of native oxides or nitrides ) , and chemical cleanliness ( e.g. , absence of polymers or metals ) . </S>",
    "<S> for example , thin ( @xmath16 ) amorphous native silicon oxide layers are known to host a considerable density of tlss  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> various adsorbates can in turn attach to the native oxides . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , hydroxyl groups ( -oh ) couple to dangling bonds on the substrate surface and build a layer of silanol groups ( si - oh ) . </S>",
    "<S> this silanol layer is also hydrophilic , and thus adsorbs additional water and dipolar molecules . </S>",
    "<S> we first remove lossy oxides from the surface following the standard practice of dipping the si substrate in a 1:7 buffered solution of hydrofluoric acid ( hf ) for @xmath17 , which both etches away surface oxides and terminates the si surface with hydrogen . </S>",
    "<S> we then include an additional step immediately following the hf dip , placing the substrate on a hot plate for @xmath17 at @xmath18 while exposing the surface to an hmds - nitrogen(n@xmath19 ) atmosphere . </S>",
    "<S> hmds is an organosilicon compound most commonly used as a primer to improve resist adhesion , to create hydrophobic surfaces , and to prepare substrates in the growth of high - mobility graphene  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> xps surface analysis of substrates immediately after these treatments revealed an absence of si - o bonds for both the hf - only and hf+hmds cases  @xcite . after also analyzing the dynamics of surface re - oxidation  @xcite </S>",

    "<S> the films are 160 or @xmath7 thick  @xcite , with a typical critical temperature of @xmath22 and @xmath23 .    </S>",
    "<S> we next aim to reduce intrinsic losses associated with the substrate - vacuum interface . </S>",
    "<S> we employ deep reactive - ion etching ( drie ) of the exposed si substrate using the bosch process  @xcite to move the substrate - vacuum interface away from regions of high electric field ( fig .  </S>",

    "<S> we now describe a recipe which allows fabrication of both rie and drie structures on the same chip . </S>",
    "<S> first , the nbtin films are patterned using e - beam lithography and rie to define feedlines and standard resonators . next , an 8-@xmath26-thick layer of az  9216 photoresist is spun , followed by @xmath27 of sputtered tungsten and a layer of pmma  a4 . after e - beam patterning and developing the pmma , </S>",
    "<S> a short rie step is used to etch the tungsten , creating a metallic mask for a @xmath28 anisotropic @xmath29-plasma ashing of the az resist . </S>",

    "<S> this suggests that the low - power limits for the resonators are still significantly influenced by tlss . </S>",
    "<S> we also observe a systematic increase in @xmath2 with decreasing @xmath54 , explanations for which include the decrease in tls polarization at lower frequencies and the decrease in radiation losses at longer wavelengths .     </S>",

    "<S> both @xmath2 ( b ) and @xmath67 ( c ) show non - monotonic temperature dependence . </S>",
    "<S> we attribute the initial increase in @xmath2 and @xmath67 ( as temperature decreases ) to a decrease in quasiparticle - related loss . at @xmath68 , @xmath2 and @xmath67 </S>",

    "<S> 3a ) . for all excitation powers </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath2 increases monotonically with temperature over this range , and higher temperatures make @xmath2 less power dependent , with the factor of 4 change at @xmath66 dropping to a factor of only 1.5 at around @xmath62 . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore conclude that tlss still provide significant loss in the quantum regime , and attribute the increase of @xmath2 with temperature to thermal depolarization of tlss .    </S>",
    "<S> a more detailed temperature dependence is acquired by measuring @xmath57 around @xmath71 at fixed @xmath64 while the device is continuously cooled from @xmath65 to @xmath66 . </S>",
    "<S> fitting @xmath57 as before , we extract @xmath2 and @xmath54 . </S>",
    "<S> initially , @xmath2 increases during cooling due to decreasing quasiparticle - induced loss  @xcite , before reaching a maximum value of @xmath72 at @xmath73 ( fig .  </S>",

    "<S> below @xmath74 , @xmath2 decreases again as increasing tls polarization leads to greater absorption of resonator photons .    </S>",
    "<S> resonator loss from tlss predominantly depends on their density of states at @xmath54 and the applied microwave power  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the continuing power dependence of @xmath2 at single - photon levels ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2 ) shows that even at these low powers , resonant tlss are still being depolarized by the incident microwaves , suggesting a significant loss contribution from tlss with low saturation powers or , equivalently , long lifetimes . </S>",
    "<S> because @xmath2 does not reach its low - power baseline , this limits the usefulness of the @xmath2 measurements in quantifying the tls - related loss . </S>",
    "<S> an alternative way to probe the effect of tlss is to study the temperature dependence of @xmath54 . unlike loss </S>",
    "<S> , the dispersive shift of the resonator also depends on non - resonant tlss that are not saturated by the applied microwaves  @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> we also fit an heuristic model for the low - temperature dependence of @xmath2 modified from ref .  </S>",
    "<S> : @xmath92 here , we introduce two _ ad hoc _ fitting parameters , a modified loss parameter @xmath93 to account for the reduced tls polarization at high excitation power , and an extra , fixed loss term @xmath94 which accounts for the non - tls - related loss which becomes significant as temperature increases . </S>",
    "<S> this fit also agrees well with the data at @xmath95 ( red curve in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3b ) , with best - fit values of @xmath96 and @xmath97 . </S>",
    "<S> the ratio @xmath98 provides an estimate of the tls polarization fraction still remaining at @xmath64 , while @xmath99 is consistent with the high - power @xmath2s measured in fig </S>",

    "<S> , we have demonstrated few - ghz cpw resonators on silicon with intrinsic quality factors exceeding one million in the quantum regime , achieved through surface treatment and substrate etching . </S>",
    "<S> our results suggest that these resonators exhibit a significant reduction in tls - related losses , but the temperature and power dependences indicate that tlss are still an important source of energy loss . </S>",
    "<S> this offers the opportunity for further improvements by interface optimization , perhaps pushing quantum - regime resonator performance towards the high - power limit with @xmath2s approaching 10  m at lower frequencies . </S>",
    "<S> since we have only partially explored the available parameter ranges in this study , future efforts will include optimizing the drie recipe and studying the effects of etch depth , side - wall roughness and under - etch on resonator losses . finally , these surface - treatment and drie techniques can be directly applied to the fabrication of superconducting qubits in integrated circuits , offering a new path towards longer qubit coherence times . </S>",
