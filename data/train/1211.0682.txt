    "sensor array imaging in a scattering medium is limited because coherent signals recorded at the source - receiver array and coming from a reflector to be imaged are dominated by incoherent signals coming from multiple scattering by the medium . for instance , in a randomly perturbed waveguide , it is known that the field becomes completely incoherent when the propagation distance becomes larger than the equipartition distance , which corresponds to the distance beyond which the source energy has been shared equally among all the propagating modes ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 20 ) .",
    "as we will see , if the distance between the source - receiver array and the reflector is larger than the equipartition distance , then classical migration of the signals recorded at the array can not give a good image .",
    "sources can be expensive or difficult to implement but receivers can be cheap and easy to implement , so an imaging problem in which there are a few sources ( all of them being far from the reflector ) and many receivers ( some of them being close to the reflector ) is of theoretical and practical interest . if there is a unique source far from the reflector ( farther than the equipartition distance ) and if the receiver array is close to the reflector ( closer than the equipartition distance ) , then classical migration of the recorded signals fails again .",
    "this was shown is various contexts and we will show it again in the waveguide geometry .",
    "however , in such a situation , another kind of migration can be used : from the work devoted to coherent interferometry imaging @xcite and ambient noise imaging @xcite , it is known that migration of cross correlations of noisy signals can be more stable than migration of the signals themselves .",
    "the migration of cross correlations of noisy signals recorded by auxiliary passive arrays was proposed by @xcite in geophysical contexts and analyzed recently in randomly scattering open media in @xcite , and we would like to address the same problem in the waveguide geometry . indeed",
    "the number of propagating modes is finite in the waveguide geometry so that the statistical behavior of partially coherent fields in random waveguides is very different from the open medium case @xcite . in our paper , we show that , if a receiver array can be placed close to the reflector to be imaged , then the cross correlations of the incoherent signals on this array can be used to image the reflector",

    "second , the term in the curly brackets in the expression of the variance is vanishing if @xmath421 is larger than the frequency coherence radius @xmath414 .",
    "so the double integral in @xmath422 is reduced to a domain that has the form of a thin diagonal band , whose thickness is limited by the frequency coherence radius @xmath414 . as a result we obtain that @xmath423    \\\\ & & \\hspace*{-0.9 in } -    { \\mathbb{e}}\\big [ \\overline{t_{jl}^{\\varepsilon } } t^{\\varepsilon}_{mn}(\\omega_0)\\big ] { \\mathbb{e}}\\big [ t_{j'l'}^{\\varepsilon}\\overline{t^{\\varepsilon}_{m'n'}}(\\omega_0 ) \\big ] \\big\\ } c_{j , l , m , n } ( x^{\\rm s } ,   z^{\\rm s } ) \\overline{c_{j',l',m',n ' } } ( x^{\\rm s } ,   z^{\\rm s } ) , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] or more simply @xmath424 where @xmath425 is the bandwidth of the source that is larger than the frequency coherence radius @xmath426 .",
    "we had seen that the use of broadband sources does not affect the resolution of the imaging functional but it ensures its statistical stability .",
    "provided the bandwidth is larger than the frequency coherence radius , the typical amplitude of the fluctuations of the imaging functional is smaller than the amplitude @xmath409 of the main peak at the reflector location , and therefore the reflector can be localized .",
    "in this paper we have shown that migration of the cross correlations of the data recorded by a passive receiver array can allow for diffraction - limited imaging of the reflector in a random waveguide even though the sources are very far from the reflector , provided the receivers are close enough from it .",
    "the statistical stability of the imaging functional is ensured by the use of broadband sources .",
    "the resolution properties are ensured by the waveguide geometry : even when the receiver array does not span the whole cross section of the waveguide , the width of the point spread function of the imaging functional is of the order of the wavelength , provided the diameter of the array is larger than the wavelength .",
    "this paper has addressed the case of a two - dimensional waveguide with dirichlet boundary conditions , but the conclusions should be qualitatively the same for fairly general situations , when addressing three - dimensional waveguides , with neumann , dirichlet or mixed boundary conditions , with random fluctuations of the index of refraction or of the boundaries as in @xcite .",
    "the authors would like to thank the anonymous referees for their careful reading of the manuscript and helpful comments .",
