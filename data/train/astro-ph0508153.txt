    "cold dark matter ( cdm ) models of galaxy formation predict many more dark matter halos than are observed as galaxies @xcite . whether stars can form in dark matter halos depends critically on the fraction of baryons ( @xmath4 ) that can be trapped and retained by each halo ( for previous discussions about the existence and formation of dark galaxies see @xcite ) .",
    "some of those that retain a small fraction of their original baryons ( @xmath5 ) are able to form stable gaseus disks , but because of the low gas densities they are not able to form stars .",
    "the physical state of the gas in the disc is very dependent on its density and temperature with the latter influenced by the intensity of any ionising background .",
    "models predict that galaxies can form with gas column densities that prohibit star formation yet provide some self shielding from the ionizing background ( davies et al . in prep .",
    "such dark galaxies are potentially detectable by blind 21 cm surveys of the sky",
    ".    objects detected at 21 cm but with no optical counterparts have been known about for many years ; these include high velocity clouds @xcite , the leo ring @xcite , and various gas clouds close to bright galaxies @xcite . however , none of these objects have the characteristics of a galaxy , i.e. detectable emission over galaxy sized spatial scales and a velocity structure consistent with a rotating and gravitationally bound disc .    in a previous paper @xcite we described jodrell bank and arecibo observations of virgohi 21 an hi source discovered during a survey of the virgo cluster @xcite .",
    "virgohi 21 has all of the hi characteristics of a typical rotating disc galaxy , but no detectable optical emission .",
    "our conclusion was that virgohi 21 was an extremely promising candidate for the first dark galaxy . in this paper , we present high resolution hi observations of this source , which add to the conclusions drawn in the earlier paper that this is , indeed , a massive dark galaxy .",
    "the new data were taken in march 2005 at the westerbork synthesis radio telescope ( wsrt ) in two full 12-hour syntheses and reduced using the miriad package .",
    "the data were flagged for shadowing and on two of the fourteen 25-metre antennae one polarisation was flagged due to problems with the gain .",
    "a spectral bandwidth of 10 mhz covered the velocity range 930 - 3070 kms@xmath1 .",
    "removal of the noisier end channels left 230 useful channels of width 8.2 kms@xmath1 each , giving a velocity resolution of 10 kms@xmath1 over the range 980 to 2890 kms@xmath1 .",
    "continuum removal was carried out in the uv plane using uvlin .",
    "the standard source 3c147 was used for calibration .",
    "cleaning used a robust setting of 1 , close to normal weighting @xcite .",
    "the cleaned cube was gaussian smoothed spatially and hanning smoothed in velocity , and then used for a second - pass deeper cleaning which gave the final cube used in the analysis .",
    "the synthesised beam was @xmath6 in size ( extended north - south ) and the noise was 0.3 mjybeam@xmath1channel@xmath1 , giving a @xmath7 column - density to sources 25 kms@xmath1 wide of @xmath8 hydrogen atoms @xmath9 .",
    "1a shows a neutral hydrogen ( hi ) contour map of the field superimposed on a negative optical image .",
    "virgohi 21 is the elongated structure in the centre ( which is at about 2000 kms@xmath1 ) .",
    "a faint bridge can be seen stretching down to the prominent spiral ngc 4254 ( 2400 kms@xmath1 ) while the other two sources , ngc 4262 ( 1500 kms@xmath1 , upper left ) and the faint galaxy ` c ' ( 1750 kms@xmath1 , immediately to the left of virgohi 21 ) appear unconnected .",
    "1b shows the velocity - declination projection of the full 3 dimensional data cube .",
    "now ngc 4254 is at the bottom right while virgohi 21 is the angular structure in the centre .",
    "c is to its left .",
    "far more detail can be seen on an animation which is available at http://www.astro.cf.ac.uk/groups/galaxies , for instance the bridge is clear and obvious , as is the lack of any connection between virgohi 21 and either ngc 4262 or c. the apparent alignment of ngc 4262 with virgohi 21 and ngc 4254 in fig .",
    "1b is a consequence of the particular projection shown    the @xmath10 25 arcmin filamentary bridge stretches from the low - velocity ( western ) edge of ngc 4254 , falling gently in radial velocity from 2250 kms@xmath1 at declination @xmath11 towards 1900 kms@xmath1 at @xmath12 where it is suddenly arrested .",
    "then at @xmath13 it is abruptly wrenched upwards again towards 2100 kms@xmath1 at @xmath14 .",
    "2 is a blow - up of the source region superimposed on a far deeper ccd optical image , illustrating that there is no optical counterpart @xcite .",
    "an optical spectrum from the 6.5-m mmt in arizona of the small , faint galaxy ` a ' , which is superposed on the highest hi contour ( @xmath15 @xmath9 ) at declination @xmath16 , shows that it is at a redshift of @xmath17 and is therefore unconnected with virgohi 21 .",
    "the 17th magnitude galaxy ` c ' to the left at @xmath18 is an hi point - source at this resolution . by comparison ,",
    "virgohi 21 is an extended structure in both dimensions rather than a collection of discrete compact clouds .",
    "the velocity - declination plot ( right ) shows the complex kinematic structure of virgohi 21 .",
    "the most remarkable feature is the tilted portion between @xmath19 ( 1900 kms@xmath1 ) and @xmath20 ( 2100 kms@xmath1 ) which resembles the signature of an edge - on rotating disc @xcite , which is what we take it to be .",
    "gas further to the north and in particular to the south could either be part of the interaction or be clumps further out in the disc .",
    "note the lack of connection between galaxy ` c ' and virgohi 21 .",
    "combining the new data with the old , we argue :    \\(a ) if attributed to gravitation , changes in velocity of galactic size over galactic scales , as seen here , require masses of galactic proportions . on dimensional grounds the velocity wrench @xmath21 ( @xmath0 kms@xmath1 ) seen at virgohi 21 over a conservative length - scale @xmath22 ( @xmath23 kpc @xmath24 cm @xmath25 arcmin at the virgo cluster distance of 16 mpc @xcite ) implies a mass @xmath26 solar masses .",
    "more specifically the gravitational ( free - fall ) timescale @xmath27 needs to be @xmath28 , the time it takes for gas travelling at @xmath29 ( relative to @xmath30 ) to change velocity by @xmath21 . and where @xmath31 , as it appears to be here ( see fig .",

    "\\(b ) the bridge between ngc 4254 and virgohi 21 reveals that they have interacted . according to published numerical simulations @xcite ( below )",
    "the morphological peculiarities of ngc 4254 require a perturbing mass of @xmath33  providing independent evidence that virgohi 21 weighs @xmath33 .",
    "the simulation implies an interaction @xmath34 years ago .",
    "as the projected length of the bridge is 120 kpc this would imply it has been drawn out at a projected speed of 390 kms@xmath1 , which is comparable to the radial velocity difference between ngc 4254 and virgohi 21 of 400 kms@xmath1 .",
    "\\(c ) ngc 4262 , the spiral to the north - east , is not involved .",
    "there is no bridge to it ( see animation ) and the radial velocity difference between ngc 4254 and ngc 4262 is too large ( 900 kms@xmath1 ) to generate one .",
    "\\(d ) if object c , the hi galaxy just to the east ( left ) of virgohi 21 ( fig .",

    "it is two orders of magnitude too undermassive and underluminous to explain the dynamics of virgohi 21 , while there is no sign of its interacting .",
    "\\(e ) the structure of virgohi 21 ( fig .",
    "2a ) is centred at r.a . @xmath39 and elongated in the north - south plane between @xmath40 and @xmath20 . its remarkable velocity change ( from 1900 to 2100 kms@xmath1 )",
    "is , however , confined to the tilted structure ( fig .",
    "2b ) between @xmath19 and @xmath20 , which closely resembles the characteristic shape of an edge - on disc @xcite .",
    "if indeed what we are witnessing here is a dark , gravitationally bound , edge - on rotating disc then its properties are as presented in table [ properties ] , with a minimum mass of @xmath41 .",
    "judging from visible disc galaxies , whose masses continue to rise beyond their hi edges @xcite , the full size and mass of such a disc could easily reach @xmath33 .",
    "the very low surface - brightness limits ( dimmer than 27.5 @xmath42 mag arcsec@xmath43 @xcite ) imply that the disc has a @xmath44 ratio of at least 750 @xmath45 where normal galaxies have @xmath46 .",

    "the surprising ease with which it has been mapped is due to two pieces of luck : it is edge on , thus increasing the apparent surface density , and most of its gas is spread over fairly low velocity widths within each synthesised beam .",
    "the incontrovertible evidence ( see animation ) of an interaction with ngc 4254 provides independent support for the massive nature of virgohi 21 .",
    "ngc 4254 is a luminous one - armed spiral galaxy sufficiently peculiar to have attracted several studies ( @xcite;@xcite ) .",
    "single - armed spirals are invariably the result of interactions with close - by massive companions @xcite .",
    "the lack of any visible companion thus triggered observations and dynamical models .",
    "recent numerical models by @xcite indicate that ngc 4254 `` had a close and rapid encounter with a @xmath67 galaxy @xmath68 myr ago .",
    "the tidal interaction caused the spiral structure ... '' .",
    "@xcite , in a vla study of the galaxy , find a trail of gas leading away from it ( their figure 5 ) in both the right direction and with exactly the right velocity - gradient required to intersect virgohi 21 .",
    "thus the case for virgohi 21 being the aforesaid @xmath33 mass which caused the peculiarities in ngc 4254 seems strong .",
    "a detailed simulation which includes our new data could remove any doubt .",
    "models for virgohi 21 now have a number of crucial observations to explain : the broad velocity - width in a galactic volume ( implying large mass ) ; its elongated geometry ; its steep velocity profile ; the bridge to ngc 4254 , and to no other galaxy ; the damage to ngc 4254 ( large mass ) ; and the lack of light . given the above observations we now discuss a number of hypotheses as to the origin of virgohi 21 and its associated hi .    * ( a ) we are detecting tidal debris left by the past interaction of ngc 4254 and another galaxy . *",
    "this is rather easy to dismiss here where the lines are so broad , and there are no such interactors visible in the immediate vicinity .",
    "imagine two galaxies with radial velocities , @xmath69 and @xmath70 at either end of an approximately linear tidal bridge of physical length @xmath71 pitched at an angle @xmath72 to the plane of the sky .",
    "a telescope pointed towards it has a transverse beam diameter of @xmath73 at the bridge .",
    "the only significant gas motions within the bridge will be streaming velocities along its length .",
    "from end to end of the bridge the radial velocity difference is @xmath74 while within the telescope beam the measured velocity width , @xmath21 , will be ( @xmath75 .",
    "but , as is well known , bridges of any size arise only when the _ total _ velocity difference between the interacting galaxies  @xmath76 here  is of the same order as the circular velocity @xmath49 in the donor @xcite .",
    "it follows immediately that @xmath77 .",
    "thus broad line widths @xmath78 , as here , can only be seen within a beam if _ both _ interactors _ appear _ to lie within , or very close to the beam ( @xmath79 ) . there are no such putative interactors even within the arecibo beam ( @xmath80 ) or close to it , otherwise we would see them in fig .",
    "virgohi 21 can not be such tidal debris .",
    "and one can not escape this conclusion by presupposing a very ancient interaction almost along the line - of - sight ( @xmath81 )  if so , where is the culprit ?",
    "@xcite have carried out numerical simulations to model interactions that might lead to tidal features detectable at 21 cm .",
    "they have proposed an interaction with ngc 4254 as the likely cause of virgohi 21 .",
    "their model 1 , which does create a cloud of the right velocity width  because of its projection along the line of sight , fails to show the perturbing galaxy , and in any case would never have been claimed as a plausible dark - galaxy candidate by us because it would fail the stringent ` timing - argument ' explained in our previous paper @xcite .",
    "additionally , the sense of their velocity field relative to the donor , ngc 4254 , is opposite to the sense actually observed .",
    "their favoured model 4 , which does indeed recreate the disturbance of ngc 4254 , has a velocity width of 20 , not 200 , kms@xmath1 !",
    "in fact , their simulations demonstrate just how hard it is to explain virgohi 21 as tidal debris .",
    "other hypotheses have also been put forward , and should be examined to see if they can explain our observations :    * ( b ) two superposed hi clouds .",
    "*    the components of virgohi 21 are connected both spatially and in velocity , making it exceedingly improbably that they could be chance superpositions of clouds , while the bridge to ngc 4254 is not explained by this hypothesis .    *",
    "( c ) a tidal tail from a galaxy merging with ngc 4254 . *",
    "@xcite suggested that the distortion of ngc 4254 could be due to infalling gas - clouds .",
    "could virgohi 21 be a tail , similar to those seen in ugc 10214 @xcite or ngc 4038/9 @xcite ? in ngc 4038/9 , in particular , there is what appears to be a tidal dwarf near a strong concentration of hi at the end of the southern tail , around 60 kpc from the centre of the system ( for a distance of 13.8 mpc ; @xcite ) .",
    "although this hypothesis can , at first sight , explain the wsrt observations , with the bridge as an hi tail and virgohi 21 as a tidal dwarf forming in a concentration at the tip , it is clear on more detailed examination that this can not be the case .",
    "the velocity field in virgohi 21 changes direction in a way not seen in examples of tidal dwarfs , and to a much greater extent  the tidal dwarf in the ngc 4038/9 system , for instance , has a gradient in the same sense as the gas in the tail nearby , whilst virgohi 21 s gradient is in the opposite direction and has twice the velocity width . even more troubling for this hypothesis , ngc 4254",
    "does not show signs of having recently merged with another @xmath82 sized galaxy  and yet it would have had to do so to have thrown out a tidal tail twice as long as that from the violently interacting ngc 4038/9 system .",
    "* ( d ) a high column - density part of a giant hi ring . *",
    "@xcite propose that some hi clouds without optical counterparts could be the high - density regions of hi rings . in their scenario ,",
    "objects such as the leo ring @xcite are formed by the tidal stripping of low surface - brightness galaxies with extended gas disks .",
    "as the column - density varies around the ring , it is possible that only part of it will be detectable  possibly at a large distance from the original galaxy from which the gas has been stripped .",
    "this would then be identified as an intergalactic hi cloud .    while this hypothesis might have explained the single - dish observations , it is hard to make the wsrt data fit .",
    "the ring should be orbiting around a large centre of mass to the east of virgohi 21 and at a higher velocity , which can not be identified .",
    "also , if the bridge is part of the ring , then it is unconnected with the perturbation of ngc 4254  which is both very unlikely and leaves the single - arm mode of that galaxy unexplained .    *",
    "( e ) a three - body interaction . *    it might be that a third mass , possibly object c , has interfered with the interaction between ngc 4254 and another body ( possibly ngc 4262 , as proposed by @xcite , as there are no other obvious candidates )",
    ". however , it seems very unlikely that c has sufficient mass to cause a perturbation of over 200 kms@xmath1 to the tidal stream , and virgohi 21 passes to its west , not between it and ngc 4262 as might be expected if it had pulled the stream westward .",
    "the radial velocity of c means that it must be moving past the stream at a velocity ( relative to the putative undisturbed velocity of the stream at that point of 2100 kms@xmath1  the velocity of the high - velocity end of virgohi 21 ) of at least 350 kms@xmath1 . at this speed",
    ", it would not have stayed close to the stream long enough to have severely disturbed it .",
    "it would also be expected that if c were involved in the interaction then there would be gas falling onto it , but this does not appear to be the case as there is no gas seen between virgohi 21 and c. nor does c show any signs of being disturbed itself ; its hi is unresolved , implying that it is confined to the area of the optical galaxy , and its optical image similarly shows no sign of any perturbation .    *",
    "( f ) ram pressure stripping . *    @xcite argue that another hi cloud in the virgo cluster , virgohi 4 @xcite , is caused by ram - pressure stripping from ngc 4388 due to an interaction with the hot - gas halo of the m86 sub - group and suggest a similar origin could be possible for virgohi 21 .",
    "this would explain the bridge without the need to invoke a second galaxy , either interacting or merging .",
    "however , this can not give the steep , reversed velocity gradient seen in virgohi 21 , nor does it explain the distortion to the optical disk of ngc 4254 .",
    "ram pressure stripping does not , therefore , appear to work as an explanation of this system .    *",
    "( g ) harassment .",
    "*    harassment occurs in much faster interactions than tidal stripping @xcite , thus it offers a possible mechanism for removing gas from ngc 4254 while leaving the interactor sufficiently distant that it can not be easily identified .",
    "however , such an interaction , while it might remove gas , would not form the tidal bridge seen here between virgohi 21 and ngc 4254 .",
    "our conclusion is that the most plausible explanation is that virgohi 21 is the cause of the tidal disturbance not the effect of other physical processes .",
    "as might be expected for a dark galaxies , virgohi 21 has a shortage of baryons compared to visible galaxies .",
    "visible disc galaxies typically have , in the form of stars and gas , @xmath83 per cent of their dynamical mass in baryons , a figure consistent with cosmological models which predict @xmath84 times as much dark matter as baryonic in the universe at large @xcite . had virgohi 21 10 per cent of its mass in baryons it would contain @xmath85 solar masses which would , if it were once in the form of hi spread evenly across the existing dynamical disc , yield a column density @xmath86 atoms @xmath9  sufficiently above the `` star - formation threshold '' of @xmath87 @xmath9 @xcite , or above the toomre criterion for gravitational instability in a rotating disc @xcite , to form stars @xcite . since it apparently contains no stars it must have _ and must always have had _",
    ", ten times less baryons  a phenomenon often apparent in dwarf galaxies @xcite .",
    "thus 90 per cent of the baryons one might have expected to find in a typical galaxy appear to be missing .",
    "whatever the reason , the lack of baryons in such massive objects can only decrease their detectability .",
    "models for virgohi 21 now have a number of crucial observations to explain : the broad velocity - width in a galactic volume ( implying large mass ) ; its elongated geometry ; its steep velocity profiles ; the bridge to ngc 4254 , and to no other galaxy ; the damage to ngc 4254 ( large mass ) ; and the lack of light . of other models that have been suggested , or that we have been able to devise , neither tidal debris , nor ram pressure stripping nor a group gravitational field , nor long - range interactions deliberately aimed at simulating this object can explain the abrupt changes of velocity .",
    "the new observations make it even harder to escape the inference that virgohi 21 contains a massive dark disc .",
    "we thank the netherlands foundation for radio astronomy for use of the wsrt , the national astronomy and ionosphere center for use of the arecibo telescope , the uk particle physics and astronomy research council for financial support , and the australia telescope national facility for inspiration and technical support .",
