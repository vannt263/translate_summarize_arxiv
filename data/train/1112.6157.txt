    "it is known that the persistent current ( i.e. a direct current in the thermodynamic equilibrium state ) can flow along a mesoscopic loop because of the quantization of the momentum circulation @xmath0 the persistent current @xmath1 in normal metal mesoscopic loops was predicted more than 30 years ago [ 1 ] and was observed not so long ago [ 2 ] .",
    "it is known also that a potential difference @xmath2 should be observed on a segment @xmath3 of an inhomogeneous conventional loop at a current density @xmath4 along the loop if the average resistivity along the segment @xmath5 differs from the one along the loop @xmath6 .",
    "therefore a possibility of a persistent voltage can be assumed at a segment of an inhomogeneous mesoscopic loop at @xmath7 .",
    "the latter , i.e. @xmath7 , can be only if the mean free path of electrons is not smaller than the length @xmath8 of loop circumference and the temperature is lower than the energy difference between adjacent permitted states @xmath9 .",
    "this difference is not large for electrons .",
    "for example , at @xmath10 , the @xmath11 value corresponds @xmath12 .",
    "therefore it is enough difficult to observe the persistent current in normal metal loop [ 2 ] .",
    "it is more easier to observe the persistent current in superconducting loop since the mean free path of superconducting pairs is infinite and the energy difference between adjacent permitted states is much higher than in normal metal loop .",
    "first experimental evidence of the persistent current at non - zero resistance - the little - parks experiment [ 3 ] was made as long ago as 1962 . in the present work",

    "the voltage oscillations corresponded to the conventional little - parks oscillations were observed on the contacts @xmath15 of the symmetric loop [ 4 ] .",
    "these resistance oscillations @xmath30 observed in the temperature region of the superconducting transition ( i.e. at @xmath31 ) are explained by the @xmath24 oscillations @xmath32 because of the oscillation of the persistent current @xmath33 [ 5 ] . here",

    "the observation of the voltage oscillations in the asymmetric loop and its absence in the symmetric loop conform to the analogy with a conventional loop .",

    "the difference of @xmath48 from @xmath49 in the asymmetric loop is caused by the additional potential contacts @xmath18 .",
    "there is an important difference from the conventional loop where the potential difference appears in accordance with the ohm s law @xmath50 .",
    "the voltage on fig.2 is observed without the faraday s voltage @xmath51 and consequently the electric field @xmath52 and the persistent current @xmath13 should have opposite directions in a segment because @xmath53 , i.e. according to the result presented on fig.2 a segment of the asymmetric loop is a dc power source at @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "the power @xmath56 can be obtained on a load with the resistance @xmath57 . because the resistance of the segment @xmath58 then @xmath59 at @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "it should be noted that already the classical little - parks experiment is evidence of the dc power source . according to this experiment the persistent current @xmath63",
    "is observed at non - zero resistance @xmath64 along the loop and consequently an energy dissipation with the power @xmath65 takes place .",
    "the persistent current is maintained in spite of this dissipation because of reiterated changes of the momentum circulation of superconducting pairs at switching of the loop between superconducting states with different connectivity [ 6 ] .    because of the quantization the momentum circulation of pair @xmath66 changes from @xmath67 to @xmath68 at each closing of superconducting state .",
    "the reiterated changes @xmath69 with an average frequency @xmath70 is equivalent of the action of an average force @xmath71 which maintains the circulating current instead of the faraday s voltage .",
    "@xmath72 is the thermodynamic average of the quantum number @xmath73 .",
    "@xmath74 when @xmath75 is not close to @xmath76 and @xmath77 at @xmath78 , where the integer number @xmath73 in @xmath79 corresponds to a minimum possible value @xmath80 .",
    "the quantum force @xmath81 is not localized in principle in any loop segment [ 6 ] , i.e. @xmath82 . therefore a potential difference @xmath83 should be observed on a segment @xmath3 remaining in superconducting state when other segment is switched in normal state with the frequency @xmath70 .",
    "this relation explains the observed voltage oscillation fig.2 .",
    "loop segments are switched in normal state at @xmath84 by thermal fluctuations and an external electric noise .",
    "consequently the energy of thermal fluctuations or an external electric noise is transformed in the power @xmath62 observed in our work .",
    "the observation of the voltage oscillations fig.2 is evidence of a possibility of an analogous observation on segments of inhomogeneous normal metal mesoscopic loop .",
    "there is an important question : thermal fluctuations or an external noise induce the dc voltage .",
    "the temperature dependence of the amplitude @xmath85 observed in our work is evidence of the latter .",
    "but it is enough obvious that thermal fluctuations can also induce the dc voltage on segments of inhomogeneous mesoscopic loops [ 6 ] ."
