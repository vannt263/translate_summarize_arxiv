    "massive stars which die as supernovae ( sne ) do not end their lives as they were born .",

    "the final fate , or the sn type , of a massive star is determined by these changes during their evolution ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "one of the most critical factors which dramatically change the properties of a star and largely affect its final fate is mass loss .",
    "massive stars continue to lose mass until the end of their lives because of their huge luminosities . from x - ray and radio observations of young sne",
    ", it has been possible to estimate the mass - loss rates of sn progenitors shortly before their explosions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in most cases ,",
    "the estimated mass - loss rates are within the range expected from the radiation - driven mass loss ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    however , there are a number of sne which seem to be strongly affected by the interaction with circumstellar media ( csm ) whose densities are too high to be explained by the standard radiation - driven mass loss .",
    "most of them are spectroscopically classified as type iin because of the narrow hydrogen emission lines seen in their spectra @xcite .",
    "the mass - loss rates of the progenitors before their explosions are estimated to be @xmath0 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "because of the high - density csm , a cool dense shell is suggested to be created between sn ejecta and csm ( e.g. , * ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    ". the cool dense shell can create dust grains efficiently and sne iin are promising sites for dust formation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "sne iin can also be used as a distance ladder thanks to the dense shell ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , some sne iin can be observed at very high redshifts and may provide us with information about star formation and initial - mass functions in the early universe ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .    despite the many interesting phenomena associated with sne iin ,",
    "the nature of sne iin is still not well - understood .",
    "little is known about their progenitors or the mechanisms that cause such extreme mass loss just before the explosions .",
    "there are several possible sn progenitors suggested to cause extreme mass loss before the explosions , e.g. , super - asymptotic - giant - branch ( agb ) stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and massive red supergiants ( rsgs ) ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the progenitor of type iin sn 2008s which was found in archival images is actually consistent with a super - agb star @xcite .",
    "the small degree of association between sn iin sites and h@xmath1 emitting regions within their host galaxies also seem consistent with these relatively low - mass progenitors ( @xcite , but see also @xcite ) . however , the other sn iin progenitors detected in archival images are very massive stars which are rather consistent with luminous blue variables ( lbvs ) ( e.g. , @xcite , see also @xcite ) .",
    "lbvs are theoretically interpreted as an evolutionary stage to a wolf - rayet star and they have not been considered as a pre - sn phase ( e.g. , @xcite , but see @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , extreme mass - loss mechanisms of such very massive stars are not well - known .",
    "there are several suggested mechanisms to induce extreme mass loss , like pulsational pair - instability ( e.g. , @xcite ) , rotation ( e.g. , @xcite ) , porosity ( e.g. , @xcite ) , gravity - mode oscillations ( e.g. , @xcite ) , or binary interaction ( e.g. , @xcite ) , but we still do not know which mechanisms are actually related to sne iin ( see also @xcite ) .    for a better understanding of sne iin , especially their progenitors and extensive mass - loss mechanisms , we need more theoretical investigation of sne iin as well as more observational data . in this paper",
    "we develop a simple analytic bolometric lc model which can be used to fit sn iin observations to estimate csm and sn ejecta properties .",
    "we believe that the information obtained by applying our lc model to many sne iin can lead to a better understanding of sne iin .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we present our analytic lc model in section [ sec2 ] .",
    "we derive the evolution of the shocked shell analytically and use it to obtain the bolometric lc evolution .",
    "we apply it to some observational sn iin bolometric lcs and obtain constraints on the properties of sn ejecta and csm for these sne in section [ sec3 ] .",
    "the discussion is given in section [ sec4 ] and we conclude this paper in section [ sec5 ] .",
    "in this section , we develop an analytic sn bolometric lc model under the assumption that its main power source is the kinetic energy of sn ejecta colliding with a dense csm . at first , we analytically investigate the evolution of the dense shell created by the interaction in section [ evlofshell ] .",
    "the analytic solution for the evolution of the dense shell before time @xmath2 ( see below ) is essentially the same as obtained in previous works ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) but our solution does not assume steady mass loss ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "after deriving the evolution of the dense shell , we provide an analytic expression for bolometric lcs .",
    "this method was introduced by @xcite ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to explain the luminoisity due to the interaction but their model assumes a csm from steady mass loss .",
    "we generalize this method for the cases of non - steady mass loss and apply our model to entire bolometric lcs . @xcite",
    "also follow a similar approach to obtain an analytic lc model from the interaction but they consider the case where the unshocked csm is optically thick . here",
    ", we consider the case in which the unshocked csm does not affect the bolometric lc so much .",

    "the inverse compton scattering and other effects can also reduce the energy of the photons ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .        the shocked dense csm and sn ejecta form a thin dense shell because of the efficient radiative cooling .",
