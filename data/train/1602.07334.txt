    "determining the structure of accretion disks remains one of the outstanding problems in astrophysics .",
    "much of what is known theoretically is based on simulations defined within the framework of the shearing box approximation @xcite .",
    "because of the local nature of this approximation some further assumptions are needed to extract from the local simulations global disk properties like the radial dependence of the various disk properties and , ultimately , the accretion rate .",
    "one way to proceed , for instance , is to assume that the disk is an @xmath0-disk  la @xcite and then extract the value of @xmath0 from the shearing box simulations .",
    "although this procedure is perfectly reasonable , it is a little bit wasteful , in the sense that all the information from the numerical simulations are combined into a single number .",
    "also , there are situations in which defining an @xmath0 parameter unambiguously from the simulations is not entirely straightforward @xcite .",
    "all in all , one feels that in spite of everything , shearing box simulations tell us quite a lot about the disk structure , and that it should be possible to piece together the results of shearing box simulations in such a way as to construct an object that looks locally like a shearing box and globally like an accretion disk .    in the present paper",
    "we examine the feasibility of effecting such a construction , and argue that under suitable conditions , namely when the disk is fully convective , the construction can actually be carried out quite straightforwardly . when discussing fully or partially convective disks , it is important to be clear about the role of the convection within the overall disk dynamics .",
    "one possibility is to assume that the turbulence that gives rise to the enhanced angular momentum transport is convective in origin . this being the case , the convection carries not only thermal energy upwards , but also angular momentum outwards .",
    "in other words , convection and disk turbulence are one and the same , and the angular momentum is transported mostly by the @xmath1 component of the reynolds stresses . it is now believed that this is probably never the case @xcite .",
    "more likely , is that the origin of the disk turbulence is not convective but probably associated with magnetically mediated instabilities , and that the role of the convection is just to carry the heat vertically upwards when radiation fails to do the job .",
    "this second possibility has been confirmed by several numerical experiments showing that if the heat generated by turbulence driven by the magneto - rotational - instability ( mri ) can not make it to the disk surface by radiative transport , convection sets in . in these simulations , the outwards transport of angular momentum",
    "is mostly associated with magnetic stresses ; the role of the convection is mainly to contribute to the vertical energy transport , and to give rise to more efficient dynamo processes @xcite .    as we shall see presently , the construction of a global solution is best described in terms of a two - step procedure .",
    "the first step is to match together an interior and an exterior solution so that certain continuity conditions are satisfied across the interface .",
    "the interior solution is obtained numerically from shearing box simulations , the exterior solution is obtained by assuming radiative equilibrium and hydrostatic balance .",
    "although this procedure could be carried out in general , it simplifies considerably if the interior solution is fully convective .",
    "the reason for the simplification is that fully convective solutions are independent of the detailed form of the thermal conduction ( opacity ) and therefore the solutions depend on fewer parameters than in the general case .",
    "we note that this matching procedure is analogous to that used to construct the hayashi tracks for fully convective , pre - main sequence stars @xcite .    in the second step the scaling relations between the disk radius and",
    "the dimensionless numbers that define the local solutions are used to construct a global solution that is valid for all radii .",
    "this is similar to the use of homologous relationships in stellar structure theory to determine various laws between the stellar mass , luminosity , effective temperature , etc .",
    "( see , for instance , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . here ,",
    "the basic assumption , is that the disk remains close to keplerian , and that therefore there is a specific , known relationship between the radius and the orbital period .",
    "this is an assumption that amounts to stating that the turbulence within the disk , whatever its origin , saturates by dissipative losses and not by modifying the basic rotational profile .",
    "finally we argue that this global solution can , at least in principle , be used to compute the mass accretion rate once the mass of the central object and the disk s mass within a given radius are specified .",
    "our aim is to construct the consistent vertical structure of an accretion disk at a given radial position using as a starting point the results of our numerical simulations of shearing boxes with vertical heat transport @xcite .",
    "therein , it is shown that the nondimensional shearing box equations with radiative boundary conditions depend only on two dimensionless parameters .",
    "these can be chosen to be the pclet number , @xmath2 , which measures thermal diffusivity , and the radiation parameter , @xmath3 , which measures the efficiency of the black - body radiating boundary @xcite .",
    "depending on the value of the pclet number , two families of stationary solutions are observed , one at low values of @xmath2 , in which heat is carried by conduction and one , at high values of @xmath2 , in which it is carried by convection . in this second case",
    "the solutions become asymptotically independent of @xmath2 , and thus depend only on the single parameter @xmath3 .",
    "this considerably simplifies the analysis ; thus from now on we concentrate on this latter case .",
    "the construction of a solution that is valid for all heights requires the matching of an interior solution  obtained numerically , with an exterior solution ",
    "obtained analytically .",
    "the former is best expressed in terms of _ dimensionless _ quantities , the latter in terms of _ dimensional _ ones .",
    "thus , it becomes important to be able to swap between dimensional and dimensionless quantities and to keep track of which quantities are which . in what follows all quantities",
    "are assumed to be _ dimensional _ unless otherwise stated , and we adopt the following units : the average mass density , @xmath4 , as the unit of density , half the layer thickness ( shearing box height ) , @xmath5 , as the unit of length , and the rotational frequency @xmath6 as the unit of frequency .",
    "thus , for instance , the heat flux is measured in units of @xmath7 while the temperature is measured in units of @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the gas constant .",
    "furthermore , with these choices , @xmath2 and @xmath3 are defined by @xmath10 where @xmath11 is a characteristic value of the thermal diffusivity and @xmath12 is stefan - boltzmann constant .",

    "these can be written as @xmath19 @xmath20 @xmath21 the constant @xmath22 is fixed by assuming hydrostatic balance which gives @xmath23 . here",
    ", @xmath24 corresponds to the equatorial temperature ; it must be chosen so that the temperature profile matches the `` effective '' temperature at the upper boundary ( lower curve in figure [ fig : convective_solutions ] ) .",
    "this is an important point that will be further discussed later .",
    "the quantity @xmath25 in equation ( [ eq : f_conv ] ) represents the average energy dissipation rate per unit volume whose dimensionless value is obtained from the simulations and observed to be approximately constant  i.e .",
    "@xmath26 independent , hence the linear profile for @xmath18 .",
    "we assume that the top of the convective region corresponds to the disk photosphere on top of which we have a radiative region of optical depth unity whose thickness is assumed to be much smaller than @xmath5 .",
    "a relation connecting the height @xmath5 of the convective region , which in our assumptions corresponds to the height of the disk , to its average density can be obtained by joining the fully convective interior to the radiative photosphere following a procedure similar to that used to construct the hayashi tracks on the h - r diagram ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "first of all we impose , in the radiative photosphere , the condition of hydrostatic equilibrium @xmath27 where we assume that the thickness of the radiative layer is small and therefore we neglect the variation of gravity with height . integrating from infinity , where we assume that the pressure vanishes , to the matching point we obtain @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the pressure at the matching point @xmath30 .",
    "the optical thickness of the radiative part must be unity and therefore @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the opacity and @xmath33 is its average over the radiative region .",
    "we can further approximate eq .",
    "( [ eq : taum ] ) by taking @xmath33 to be the opacity at @xmath30 and expressing it as a power law in density and temperature .",
    "the density at the matching point is equal to @xmath4 and the temperature is equal to the effective temperature @xmath34 , therefore @xmath35 and @xmath36 thus eq .  ( [ eq : hyd_eq ] ) can then be rewritten as @xmath37 an additional relation between density , pressure and temperature at the matching point is provided by the perfect gas equation of state @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the mean molecular weight .",
    "this finally gives @xmath40 furthermore , @xmath34 can be related to the heat flux at the top of the convective region by the relation @xmath41 where @xmath42 is dimensionless .     as a function of @xmath3 for a series of shearing box simulations with @xmath43 1,000 .",
    "as can be seen , the value of @xmath44 is nearly constant over the range .",
    "details of the numerical work can be found in @xcite .",
    ", width=377 ]    eqs .",
    "( [ eq : matching1 ] ) and ( [ eq : matching2 ] ) represents , for a given @xmath6 , two equations for the three unknown @xmath4 , @xmath34 and @xmath5 .",
    "thus , every quantity can , in principle , be expressed as a function of @xmath4 . to do this ,",
    "however , the functional form of @xmath42 is needed . to obtain it , we performed a series of shearing box simulations with values of @xmath3 spanning four order of magnitudes , ranging from @xmath45 to @xmath46 and found that @xmath42 is nearly independent of @xmath3 over this range ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : sigma ] ) . consequently we assume it to be a constant .",
    "the expression for the height of the disk then becomes @xmath47 finally , eq .  ( [ eq : t_conv ] ) can be used to obtain the value of the central temperature . in this way we have fully specified the vertical disk structure for given values of @xmath6 and @xmath4 . in the next section we patch together these solutions as a function of the radial distance from the central object to obtain the global disk structure",
    "in eq .  ( [ eq : discd ] ) the disk height is implicitly expressed as a function of the radial distance , @xmath48 from the central object through @xmath6 and the density @xmath4 .",
    "the required dependence of @xmath6 on @xmath48 can be obtained by assuming that the disk is keplerian , whereby @xmath49 and @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the gravitational constant and the mass of the central object , respectively .",
    "the radial dependence of @xmath4 can be obtained from the condition that the mass accretion rate , @xmath52 , in a steady state , must be independent of the radius . the mass accretion rate , in turn ,",
    "can be derived from the angular momentum conservation ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that , at large distances , can be expressed as @xmath53 here , @xmath54 is the value of the @xmath55 component of the turbulent stress tensor given by @xmath56 where @xmath57 is its nondimensional value obtained from the numerical simulations .",
    "we note here that , up to normalization factors of order unity , @xmath58 is the same as the @xmath59 parameter in @xcite",
    ". equations ( [ eq : mdot ] ) and ( [ eq : stresses ] ) can be combined to express the density @xmath4 as @xmath60 again we note that in general @xmath58 is a function of @xmath3 , however in the shearing box formulation @xmath58 and @xmath61 are proportionally related @xcite , in fact in a steady state @xmath62 .",
    "therefore , since we have argued that @xmath61 is approximately constant , so is @xmath58 .",
    "indeed , the values in fig .",
    "[ fig : sigma ] correspond to a value of the @xmath59 parameter of approximately 0.16 normalized to the disk half thickness @xmath5 .    finally inserting eq .",

    ". the effective temperature can be obtained from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : matching2 ] ) and ( [ eq : rho0 ] ) as @xmath66",
    "we have outlined a procedure to construct a global model of an accretion disk by piecing together the numerical solutions based on the shearing box approximation .",
    "the method naturally follows in two steps , one in which the local numerical solutions are matched to an exterior radiative atmosphere in hydrostatic balance , another in which the scaling relations are used to extend the local construction to the entire disc .",
    "although the methods can be applied in general , it simplifies considerably if the solution in the disk interior is fully convective .",
    "indeed , in the present paper we have restricted our analysis to such cases .",
    "the two steps , matching to a radiative atmosphere , and using scaling relations are similar to the construction in stellar structure theory of the hayashi tracks for fully convective proto - stars @xcite , and of the derivation of the mass - luminosity relations for main sequence homologous stars .",
    "the final result gives the complete structure of the disk as a function of two parameters ; @xmath51 and @xmath52 once the physical properties of the accreting material , like its equation of state and opacity law are specified .",
    "this may seem somewhat paradoxical .",
    "one has the feeling that for infalling material with fixed ( known ) physical properties , hydrogen , say , the accretion rate should be determined only by the mass of the central object .",
    "why , then , is that not the case here ? to understand the nature of the problem it suffices to examine eq .",
    "( [ eq : height ] ) which specifies the height of the disk as a function of @xmath6 and hence of the radius .",
    "the first three terms on the right hand side are fixed by the solutions of the shearing box problem and by the physical properties of the accreting gas .",
    "the last two depend on @xmath52 and @xmath51 .",
    "thus for a fixed @xmath51 and fixed physical properties the global solution consists of a one parameter family of discs of different thicknesses  given by @xmath5 , and depending on @xmath52 ; raising the question why is the accretion rate not uniquely defined ?",
    "there appear to be a residual ambiguity in the absolute vertical scale of the disk .",
    "the origin of this ambiguity is related to the decoupling of the length scales for radial and vertical distances .",
    "typically , the unit of length is isotropic and applies equally to radial and vertical coordinates .",
    "this is indeed the case in the global disk equations .",
    "however , the formulation of the shearing box equations as a local approximation decouples the radial and vertical coordinates .",
    "the position of a shearing box within a disk is only encoded by @xmath6 , not by @xmath48 .",
    "thus it is impossible to specify the size or height of a shearing box in terms of the absolute radial coordinate .",
    "our construction of the global solution by piecing together appropriately scaled local solutions produces the correct @xmath48 dependence but not the absolute scale .",
    "this has to be reintroduced separately , by , for example , specifying @xmath52 .",
    "alternatively , a unique accretion rate can be recovered by specifying the total mass within a cylinder of radius @xmath48 .",
    "these considerations notwithstanding we have constructed a global model for the disk .",
    "it is useful to re - examine what assumptions were made that allowed the construction to proceed and , to what extent , they were reasonable .",
    "these come in two varieties : weak assumptions that are general to any type of disk and strong assumptions that are specific to our case . in order to move from a local to a global model we assumed that the disk was stationary  that allowed the derivation of a relationship between @xmath52 and @xmath4 ,",
    "also we assumed that the disk s rotational profile was keplerian to obtain a relationship between @xmath6 and @xmath48 .",
    "both these are weak assumptions that do not require much in the way of justification .",
    "it is reasonable to assume that at least some disks are nearly keplerian and that they may spend some of their existence in a quasi - stationary state .",
    "much stronger assumptions are those concerning the locality of the disk structure , the convective nature of the disk interior , the thinness of the transition layer between optically thick and optically thin regions , and the use of numerical solutions obtained with impenetrable boundaries and fixed diffusivity to model a physical layer with no boundaries and strongly varying diffusivity .",
    "the first three assumptions are physical , the last is procedural . we discuss them in turn .",
    "the use of the shearing box approximation to determine the disk structure implicitly assumes that there is no global , or at any rate , long - range organization of the disk .",
    "this assumption can only be verified by comparing with full disk simulations .",
    "the interior of a disk will become convective if the pclet number is large ; which , in turns , requires that the disk material be very optically thick . in order for the transition layer between convective interior and radiative exterior to be geometrically thin",
    ", the opacity must be a strongly decreasing function of temperature .",
    "these requirements could be satisfied , possibly , by plasmas near their ionization conditions .",
    "for example , depending on the density , hydrogen , has such a transition at temperatures ranging between a few thousand to ten thousand degrees . at higher temperatures hydrogen",
    "becomes fully ionized , most of the contributions to the opacity come from processes involving free electrons and the opacity decreases with increasing temperature .",
    "thus it is not immediately obvious that both conditions , a strong ( decreasing ) temperature dependence and large pclet number in the interior can be simultaneously satisfied .",
    "however , because we have an explicit solution we can check _ a posteriori _ if that is the case .",
    "we now illustrate how this could be done in practice . in the radiative exterior",
    "we assume an opacity law of the form ( [ eq : kappa ] ) with @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "these values are not unreasonable for hydrogen at a few thousand degrees and moderate densities @xcite .",
    "then for each value of @xmath52 and @xmath6 we construct a solution and evaluate an average pclet number in the interior based on kramer s opacity law , say , and the scale - height at @xmath5 of the exterior radiative solution based on the opacity law given above .",
    "the results are summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig : consistency ] .",
    "the region to the left of the purple line correspond to solutions with @xmath69 , the region to the right of the blue line correspond to solutions with @xmath70 , for which our assumed exterior opacity law is justified , and the region to the right of the green line correspond to solutions with scale heights at @xmath5 much smaller than @xmath5 itself .",
    "thus solutions in the green region satisfy all the required criteria and are therefore self - consistent .",
    "the pink region corresponds to solutions that are convective but the transition to the radiative state is not sharp . for comparison",
    ", the star corresponds to the values in one of the convective solutions recently found by @xcite . indeed in their solutions",
    "the transition region is not very sharp and , correspondingly , the star is just inside the pink region .",
    "we note that it is important to understand why we have chosen to exclude these solutions from our construction .",
    "the numerical basis for our models were calculated by considering a computational domain with impenetrable , stress - free boundaries in the vertical and a constant value of the thermal diffusivity .",
    "the latter was chosen to be small to ensure that the pclet number was large .",
    "the result are solutions with sharp thermal boundary layers at the boundaries as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : convective_solutions ] .",
    "what is being considered here , instead , are solutions in which the temperature varies smoothly , but the opacity , and hence the thermal diffusivity varies sharply . in other words we have traded a constant @xmath11 , impenetrable boundaries , and large temperature gradients for moderate temperature gradients , no clear cut boundary , and a sharply varying @xmath11 . in general one",
    "would not expect the two situations to be interchangeable unless the regions with the large gradients are geometrically thin .",
    "the other justification for this procedure is that it should be possible to arrange things so that the trade - off can be carried out in such a way that the total energy flux , and hence , the total energy generation rate is preserved .",
    "this is precisely why , in eq .",
    "( [ eq : t_conv ] ) that describes the temperature profile _ without _ the boundary layers , we chose @xmath24 so that it matched @xmath34 at the boundaries . thus the two cases , one with thermal boundary layers and one without do not have the same interior temperature but have the same energy flux , and hence the same accretion rate .",
    "on the basis of fig .",
    "[ fig : consistency ] we conclude that it is probably unlikely that a disk can be found that is entirely convective , however , again on the basis of fig .",
    "[ fig : consistency ] it may be likely that many discs are convective at least in some regions .",
    "this being the case one can speculate on the structure of discs that are partially convective . if such discs were capable of dynamo action what would the magnetic field look like ? would its structure be determined by the convective regions , or the radiative regions ?",
    "would it be possible to address some of these issues , at least in part , by local , i.e shearing box simulations , or would any analysis require full disk simulations ?    finally , we note that the main objective of the present paper was to describe a procedure , not really to apply it to any particular situation .",
    "the example we have given was meant to be illustrative .",
    "applications to specific discs require much more careful discussions of the physical conditions of the plasma , and in particular of the opacity laws  most likely involving table lookups .",
    "such analyses will be undertaken elsewhere .     plane .",
