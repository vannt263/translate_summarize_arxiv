    "since its birth , classical general relativity has been applied to the construction of cosmological models .",
    "this is usually done by specifying the symmetries that are expected to exist on large scales , and then looking for solutions of einstein s field equations that exhibit those symmetries .",
    "the cosmological principle , that the universe is spatially homogeneous and isotropic on large scales , then leads one to the friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) solutions . taken as a model for the universe ,",
    "the flrw solutions of einstein s equations have been shown to be remarkably consistent with a wide array of observations , ranging from the cosmic microwave background @xcite , all the way through to the hubble diagrams constructed using nearby supernovae @xcite .",
    "this consistency , however , is only allowed at the expense of including new and exotic `` dark '' components that must dominate over all other forms of matter in the universe .    on the other hand , we know that the visible matter in the late universe is highly inhomogeneous on small scales , being condensed largely into stars that only occupy about @xmath0 of the total volume of spaceg/@xmath1 , a baryon fraction of @xmath2 , and a critical density of @xmath3g/@xmath1 . ] .",
    "the rest is an almost perfect vacuum .",
    "this strongly suggests the need to relax our assumptions about homogeneity , at least at some level .",
    "bound up with this is the `` backreaction '' problem , that averaging and evolution do not commute in einstein s theory .",
    "this means that even if the universe is close to being homogeneous and isotropic on large scales , there is no guarantee that it will evolve anything like the flrw solutions of einstein s equations ( unless one adds some otherwise undetectable exotic matter fields , in order to force it to ) .    the problem that then needs to be addressed , in order to trust the results of the standard approach to cosmology , is to determine the large - scale evolution that emerges in space - times that are close to statistically homogeneous and isotropic on large scales , but very highly inhomogeneous on small scales .",
    "this problem has been approached in many different ways in the literature , including using cosmological perturbation theory @xcite , spatial averaging @xcite , space - time averaging @xcite , shortwave approximations @xcite , exact solutions @xcite , and approximate solutions @xcite , to name but a few .",
    "our approach is to develop a family of cosmological models that contains a regular array of identical black holes only .",
    "these models have the great benefit of admitting a time - symmetric initial value problem that can be solved exactly @xcite , as well as allowing for the exact evolution of some high - symmetry curves to be found @xcite .",
    "early work in this spirit includes that of mccrea @xcite , coxeter & whitrow and lindquist & wheeler .",
    "these latter authors suggested a wigner - seitz - type approach in which 3-dimensional space is tiled with regular polyhedra , and a mass is put at the centre of each cell .",
    "the geometry of space - time within each cell is then approximated as being schwarzschild , and approximate junction conditions are used to obtain a large - scale evolution .",
    "the optical properties of these models have been studied in @xcite .",
    "more recently numerical solutions to einstein s equations have been found for these configurations in both the hyper - spherical case @xcite and the flat case @xcite . even taking into account their simplified nature ,",
    "these lattice models are still more realistic in many aspects than the flrw models : firstly , they are locally inhomogeneous in a realistic non - perturbative manner ; secondly , the matter content is discrete , rather than a fluid ; and thirdly , they are vacuum models , as is the real universe at almost all points",
    ".    the focus of the present work will be on the surfaces in these models that exhibit reflection symmetry .",
    "these include the faces of the cells that constitute the original tiling , as well as a number of the planes that pass through the cell centres . while the geometry of these surfaces is a more complicated problem than those studied previously , it will also enable us to consider more general models , such as the tiling of flat space with an infinite array of cubes , as well as any other initial 2-surface that exhibits reflection symmetry , including models that are not necessarily of the regular lattice type .",
    "our basic requirement will only be that there is an initial 2-surface with reflection symmetry .",
    "this immediately implies , in particular , that the symmetry surface itself , as well as its evolution , will be totally geodesic subspaces of the full space - time .",
    "one feature of particular interest for relativistic cosmological models is the presence ( or otherwise ) of gravitational radiation . to determine whether a space - time is radiative is not straightforward in general . for our purposes ,",
    "we exploit the well - known manifestly covariant and non - perturbative electromagnetic analogy for gravity @xcite , and say that the flux of gravitational radiation vanishes if the super - poynting vector vanishes .",
    "we present an argument that this condition implies that the energy carried between cells by the radiation also vanishes , despite the dimensionality of the super - poynting vector being different from that of an energy flux . due to the existence of a number of chambers that are entirely enclosed by these reflection symmetric surfaces",
    ", we say that our lattice models are `` piecewise silent '' .    to implement this program we begin by identifying the geometric quantities that must vanish on reflection symmetric surfaces .",
    "we derive the complete ( 1 + 2)-dimensional einstein system along their evolution .",
    "our basic variables for this are the expansion and shear of a set of reference time - like curves , together with the non - vanishing parts of the weyl tensor .",
    "we then evaluate the super - poynting vector on these surfaces , and consider what this means for the propagation of gravitational waves .",
    "unless otherwise stated , we use greek letters @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 ... to denote coordinate indices , and latin letters @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 ... to denote tetrad indices .",
    "in this section we will introduce the regular lattice models that we have previously studied in @xcite .",
    "we will then identify the surfaces within them that exhibit reflection symmetry .",
    "it will be these surfaces that we consider for the remainder of this paper .",
    "the first step in creating a regular lattice model of the universe is to consider the regular tiling of an abstract 3-dimensional space of constant curvature .",
    "if one insists that the cells that constitutes this tiling are a set of indentical , regular polyhedra , then there is a finite number of possibilities @xcite .",
    "these are listed in table [ table1 ] , below .",
    "if the curvature of the initial reference space is positive , so that it is a hyper - sphere , then there are six possible tilings .",
    "these have @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 cells , which are either tetrahedra , cubes , dodecahedra or octahedra .",
    "if the initial space is flat euclidean 3-space then the only possible regular tiling is with cubic lattice cells . for a negatively curved initial reference space",
    "there are four possible tilings , with either cubes , dodecahedra or icosahedra . in both the flat and negatively curved cases the number of cells required to tile the space is inifinite , as we are considering trivial topologies only .",
    "the next step in these constructions is then to place a point - like mass at the centre of each cell . to maintain the symmetries of the cells , and in order to have a vacuum space - time ,",
    "these masses are chosen to be non - rotating and uncharged .",
    "one is then in a position to attempt to solve einstein s equations .",
    "no exact solutions for the global geometry of space - time are known for any of the configurations resulting from the tilings in table [ table1 ] . however , for the six lattices on positively curved spaces it is possible to solve the initial value problem under the assumption of time - symmetry .",
    "this has been investigated in some detail in @xcite , and even considered for arbitrarily large numbers of irregularly distributed masses in @xcite .",
    "the initial value problem in the flat and negatively curved spaces has not been solved exactly , but has been investigated numerically in @xcite .",
    "the exact evolution of some preferred curves has been studied in @xcite , and numerical solutions for the evolution of the space - time have been studied in @xcite .    .",

    "to do this we define @xmath16 to be the normalized gradients of the @xmath17 hypersurfaces .",
    "the normals @xmath18 are then , by construction , perpendicular to the geodesic congruence associated with @xmath19 .",
    "the two foliations @xmath19 and @xmath17 , that are surfaces of constant @xmath20 and @xmath21 , then give rise to the orthonormal 1-forms @xmath22 and @xmath23 . a coframe can be completed by adding two further normalized 1-forms , which can be written as @xmath24 , where we have used the restricted indices @xmath25 for frame components and @xmath26 for coordinate components .",

    "<S> we consider a family of cosmological models in which all mass is confined to a regular lattice of identical black holes . by exploiting the reflection symmetry about planes that bisect these lattices into identical halves , </S>",
    "<S> we are able to consider the evolution of a number of geometrically distinguished surfaces that exist within each of them . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the evolution equations for the reflection symmetric surfaces can be written as a simple set of friedmann - like equations , with source terms that behave like a set of interacting effective fluids . </S>",
    "<S> we then show that gravitational waves are effectively trapped within small chambers for all time , and are not free to propagate throughout the space - time . </S>",
