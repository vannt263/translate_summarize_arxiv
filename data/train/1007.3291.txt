    "the temperature dependence of the dielectric constant measured perpendicular to the @xmath5 axis in general resembles the behavior for @xmath15 but there are subtle differences at low temperature ( fig.[fig1 ] ) .",

    "k , the capacitance is rather field independent for small @xmath21 but a sharp increase appears around 4 t. at higher fields , the capacitance increases nearly linearly with a rather constant slope .",
    "the critical field of the jump in @xmath14 increases upon heating and the size of the jump becomes smaller .",
    "above , i.e. in absence of long range magnetic order , the jump @xmath22 vanishes .",
    "note , that for all temperatures studied in the magnetically ordered phase the behavior in the high - field phase is nearly independent of temperature and the slope at high fields is very similar above , too .",
    "the sharp anomaly in the dielectric constant is associated to a previously found field induced magnetic transition ( fimt ) which is clearly visible in magnetization measurements ( see .",
    "fig.[fig2](b ) ) .  @xcite the magnetization data show a huge jump of roughly 9 /f.u . at the fimt , and",
    "similar to the jump in @xmath8 the anomaly @xmath23 decreases and shifts to higher fields upon heating .",
    "the field induced magnetic transition is not only associated to jumps in @xmath14 and in the magnetization but it is also accompanied by strong magnetostrictive effects . as seen in in fig .",
    "2(c ) , the @xmath5-axis exhibits a jump - like decrease at the critical field .",
    "again , the jump reduces upon heating and it is restricted to the magnetically ordered phase .",
    "in general , the @xmath5 axis contracts in the whole field range studied . in fig .",
    "2(d ) , the magnetic field dependence of @xmath17 is shown , with the magnetic field again applied along the @xmath5 axis .",
    "we again observe that the magnetic field dependence is small in both the low - field and the high - field antiferromagnetic phase while the largest changes occur at the fimt .",
    "however , unlike the measurement for @xmath19 , the dielectric constant decreases with magnetic field in the field induced phase .",
    "the phase diagram shown in the inset summarizes the transition fields of the fimt vs. temperature as derived from dielectric constant , magnetization , magnetostriction and specific heat .",
    "we note that sharp changes in magnetostriction and electrical polarization at @xmath24k were reported recently in pulsed field studies , too .",
    "@xcite the reported anomalies in the magnetostriction are however about 2 times smaller than found with our quasi - static set - up which might be associated to the different experimental approach , i.e. pulsed magnetic field and usage of a piezoelectric sensor glued to the sample .",
    "in addition , there are also qualitative differences to our data , i.e. in @xmath25 at @xmath26 and pronounced hysteresis effects in the magnetostriction and the electrical polarization .",

    "( b ) magnetization ( from ref .  ) , ( c ) magnetostriction of the @xmath5 axis , and ( d ) capacitance for e @xmath28 @xmath5 , b @xmath27 @xmath5 .",
    "the inset displays the magnetic phase diagram derived from dielectric constant , magnetization , magnetostriction and thermal expansion studies . ]    to summarize the experimental data in fig.[fig2 ] , at the fimt tbfe@xmath0(bo@xmath0)@xmath1  displays a magnetically driven phase transition which is associated to sharp jumps in ( 1 ) the dielectric constant , ( 2 ) the magnetization , and ( 3 ) in the length of the @xmath5-axis .",
    "it has been shown earlier for the magnetic degrees of freedom that , at the fimt , there is a spin - flop of the fe spins accompanied by a magnetic flip of the tb moments .",
    "@xcite    the pronounced magnetoelastic coupling and the resulting jump of the sample length at the fimt might suggest that the observed step in the dielectric constant is only associated to the magnetostriction , i.e. @xmath29 where @xmath8@xmath30 is the permittivity of the free space , @xmath8 is the dielectric constant , @xmath31 is the area of the contacts , and @xmath32 is the thickness of the sample . in general , a magnetic field induced jump in the sample length implies a capacitance anomaly which can not be discussed in terms of the magnetodielectric effect .",
    "this scenario can however be clearly ruled out if the anisotropy of the magnetostriction and magnetocapacitance is considered ( cf .",
    "fig.[fig3 ] ) .",
    "if a magnetic field is applied along the @xmath5-axis , the length of the @xmath5-axis and the @xmath33-axis sharply shrinks and increases , respectively .",
    "such an opposite sign of the length jumps is expected due to at least partial volume conservation of the magnetoelastic distortion . in contrast , both jumps in @xmath14 and @xmath17 exhibit the same sign , i.e. magnetostriction has only a minor effect on the observed field dependence of @xmath8 and can not explain the changes in @xmath8(@xmath34 ) .",
    "therefore , the anomalies clearly point to a direct magnetodielectric coupling .",
    "-axis , and ( b ) magnetostriction along the @xmath33- and @xmath5-axis , respectively , of tbfe@xmath0(bo@xmath0)@xmath1 , at @xmath20 k , for magnetic fields applied along the @xmath5-axis . ]    as discussed above , the general behavior of the dielectric constant vs. temperature is rather isotropic while there is a weak difference between @xmath8@xmath35(t ) and @xmath8@xmath36(t ) at low temperatures .",
    "interestingly , despite the fact that in gdfe@xmath0(bo@xmath0)@xmath1  the magnetic structure in the ordered phase is different compared to tbfe@xmath0(bo@xmath0)@xmath1 , the anomaly at  as well as the low temperature behavior @xmath14(@xmath37 ) and @xmath17(@xmath37 ) is roughly similar in both compounds .",
    "@xcite in particular , both materials exhibit an increase of @xmath17 below  which in gdfe@xmath0(bo@xmath0)@xmath1  is truncated by a spin - reorientation transition . for gdfe@xmath0(bo@xmath0)@xmath1",
    ", the upturn was suggested to originate from the polarization of gd spins and the vicinity of a spin - reorientation transition @xcite .",
    "in contrast , there is no spin - reorientation in tbfe@xmath0(bo@xmath0)@xmath1 but as well the specific heat as the magnetization data exhibit a broad schottky - like anomaly at the temperature where there is the peak in @xmath17 .",
    "recently , the anomalies of the specific heat and the magnetization were explained in terms of temperature - driven population of the ground state of tb ion split by the internal field of fe spins  @xcite which suggests a similar , i.e. schottky - like , scenario for the broad peak in in @xmath17 .    in the following",
    "we will discuss the origin of the observed magnetodielectric coupling .",
    "in general , the dielectric constant is related to optical phonon frequencies via the lyddane - sachs - teller relationship : @xmath38 in this equation @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the long wavelength longitudinal and transverse optical - phonon mode frequencies , respectively .",
    "@xmath41 is the static dielectric constant , i.e. the dielectric constant at zero frequency , and @xmath42 is the optical dielectric constant .",
    "following the early literature on bamnf@xmath1 @xcite , mno @xcite and mnf@xmath43 @xcite , we have tried to relate the dielectric constant we measured to the relevant to phonon modes . in order to do so , we have used a modified barrett equation as described in the aforementioned references as follows : @xmath44\\ ] ] in this equation , @xmath31 is a coupling constant and @xmath45@xmath30 is the mean frequency of the final states in the lowest lying optical phonon branch . by fitting our data as indicated by the red lines in fig.[fig1 ] we obtained @xmath46 , @xmath47 @xmath11 for @xmath8@xmath48 and @xmath49 , @xmath50 @xmath11 for @xmath8@xmath35 .",
    "we note the tranverse optical mode that we obtained from the barrett function fits corresponds to an average of all the contributing transverse optical modes in the respective direction @xcite .",
    "we have done raman spectroscopy measurements to look for direct evidence of spin - lattice coupling . according to the previous reports @xcite there are 59 transverse optical modes that correspond to @xmath17 i.e. phonon modes corresponding to a to mode propagating perpendicular to the @xmath5 axis .",
    "we have checked the temperature dependence of these modes and observed that only two low lying ones shift their frequency at low temperatures : the first one at 200 @xmath11 , the second one at 260 @xmath11 .",
    "the modes at other frequencies do not significantly change their frequency .",
    "we show in fig.[raman](a ) two representative low - lying phonon modes around 200 @xmath11 . upon cooling below the magnetic ordering temperature ,",
    "one of the modes with the frequency 206 @xmath11 does not shift with changing temperature while the frequency of the lower lying transverse phonon mode at 200 @xmath11 is shifting remarkably at .",
    "its shift provides direct evidence for the spin - lattice coupling since exchange striction stretches or elongates the bonds and hence shifts the phonon frequencies when magnetic ordering takes place .",
    "the anomalous softening of the phonon mode reported in fig.[raman](a ) is a possible reason for the behavior of the dielectric constant . below the antiferromagnetic ordering temperature ,",
    "the behavior of the dielectric constant perpendicular to @xmath5 ( as discussed in the previous section ) is rationalized in the light of the raman response . as suggested by the lyddane - sachs - teller ( lst )",
    "equation the dielectric constant is inversely proportional to the frequency of the to - phonon mode , associated to it .",
    "we note that usually lo - modes and @xmath42 are assumed as temperature independent @xcite .",
    "fig.[raman ] summarizes the qualitative agreement between temperature dependence of the dielectric constant ( b ) and the inverse of the phonon frequency ( c ) . remarkably , the measured changes of the dielectric constant correspond very well to a decrease of the phonon frequency as described by the lst equation .",
    "we note however that in order to have a quantitative agreement , one needs to add the contributions from the all the relevant symmetry allowed to modes .",
    "in addition to this , the data imply a large anomalous broadening of the phonon mode at the magnetic transition itself .",
    "this is shown in fig.[raman](d ) where the phonon line - width as a function of temperature across the antiferromagnetic ordering temperature is presented .",
    "the black dashed line describes the expected decrease of the phonon lifetime as a function of temperature as if it was purely due to the usual phonon anharmonicity .",
    "the ( red ) dashed area in fig.[raman](d ) reveals that in the temperature region close to the magnetic transition another decaying channel is available for the transverse optical mode . in the vicinity of the neel temperature",
    "the phonon broadening deviates much stronger from the expected behavior suggesting that a phonon - magnon coupling channel becomes active at the magnetic ordering temperature .",
    "this strongly suggests that the additional decaying channel reducing the phonon lifetime is not directly coupled to the magnetic order parameter but rather to its fluctuations .    in conclusion",
    ", we have demonstrated magnetodielectric coupling in tbfe@xmath0(bo@xmath0)@xmath1 using capacitance measurements and revealed the correlation between spin - phonon coupling and dielectric constant .",
    "we have shown that magnetodielectric coupling can not be explained by the magnetostrictive effects but it occurs via shifting of the associated optical phonon modes .",
    "the magnetic field induced phase transition the magnetic field induced phase transition is associated to sharp changes of not only the magnetic but also dielectric and structural degrees of freedom , i.e. the spin - flop of fe spins is accompanied not only by full polarization of the tb moments but also to a significant distortion probably of the feo@xmath51 octaedra and a jump in the dielectric constant .",
