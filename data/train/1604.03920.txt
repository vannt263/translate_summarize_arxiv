    "the energy spectrum of mesons produced in neutrino - nucleus interactions is modified by strong interactions with the residual nucleus .",
    "recent high - statistics measurements of charged - current @xmath3production by miniboone  @xcite and minerva  @xcite have shown tension with available models  @xcite .",
    "a study of @xmath0production is complementary because of differences in the nuclear interaction due to strangeness conservation .",
    "previous measurements of neutrino - induced charged - current @xmath0production have been carried out in bubble chambers with very limited statistics  @xcite .",
    "we report the first high - statistics measurement of this process based on a sample of 1755 selected event candidates , of which 885 are estimated to be charged - current @xmath0events with @xmath4  mev .    at neutrino energies below 2 gev ,",
    "cabibbo suppressed single kaon production @xmath5 is the dominant @xmath0production mechanism . at higher energies ,",
    "@xmath0mesons arise via associated production accompanied by strangeness @xmath6  baryons ( @xmath7 , @xmath8 ) or mesons ( @xmath9 , @xmath10 ) such that there is no net change in strangeness ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "this can occur through an intermediate resonance state or in deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) by hadronization , the production of mesons and baryons from the struck quark .",
    "in particular , @xmath12 pairs created in hadronization lead to pairs of strange particles in the final state .",
    "production of @xmath0by atmospheric neutrinos is a background in experimental searches for the proton decay @xmath13 , a channel favored by grand unification theories which incorporate supersymmetry .",
    "the simplest minimal supersymmetric models  @xcite give proton lifetimes that have been excluded by experiment . however , other models  @xcite allow proton lifetimes greater than @xmath14 years , consistent with the current experimental lower bound of @xmath15 years from a 260 kiloton - year exposure by super - kamiokande  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0from proton decay is below cherenkov threshold in water , but a liquid argon time projection chamber such as dune  @xcite is able to reconstruct the @xmath0momentum precisely . the @xmath0momentum spectrum in @xmath13depends on the momentum distribution of the initial - state protons inside the nucleus .",
    "a related issue is the extent to which @xmath0mesons born inside the nucleus experience final - state interactions ( fsi ) as they emerge into the detector medium .",
    "kaons produced by neutrinos are subject to the same interactions . measuring @xmath0production by neutrinos on carbon is a first step toward understanding the spectrum for @xmath13 in the argon of the dunefar detector .",
    "kaon - nucleus and pion - nucleus reactions differ because of strangeness conservation .",
    "absorption is the dominant feature in the pion - nucleus inelastic cross section at pion kinetic energies in the few 100s of mev . in @xmath9-nucleus scattering ,",
    "the @xmath9can be absorbed , converting a bound nucleon into a hyperon .",
    "the analogous process for @xmath0-nucleus scattering is forbidden because there are no antibaryons in the nucleus .",
    "a @xmath0produced inside the nucleus will exit unless it charge exchanges to a @xmath16 .",
    "in addition , @xmath0can be produced in @xmath3-nucleus reactions by strong processes such as @xmath17 . in the giessen boltzmann - uehling - uhlenbeck model  @xcite",
    ", this kind of reaction gives an enhancement to the @xmath0production cross section at low @xmath0momentum . in genie  @xcite , the event generator used by minervaand many other experiments , 13% of @xmath0produced in carbon reinteract before exiting the nucleus , distorting the spectrum toward lower kaon energies .",
    "geniedoes not include @xmath0production either by pions or charge exchange in its fsi model .    this paper reports a measurement at high statistics of inclusive charged - current @xmath0production by muon neutrinos , @xmath1 ch @xmath18 .",
    "the differential cross section in @xmath0kinetic energy is measured and compared to predictions of current neutrino event generators with and without fsi treatments .",
    "minervais a dedicated neutrino - nucleus cross section experiment in the numi beamline  @xcite at fermilab .",
    "the detector consists of a core of strips of solid plastic scintillator `` tracker '' surrounded by calorimeters on the sides and downstream end .",
    "the electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters intersperse scintillator with passive planes of lead and steel , respectively .",
    "the upstream nuclear targets region is used only to veto front - entering events for this result .",
    "the minos near detector is located 2  m downstream of minerva .",
    "positive muons from antineutrino - induced charged - current reactions are rejected using curvature , but the muon momentum measurement is not used in this analysis .",
    "the scintillator strips are arranged into planes stacked perpendicular to the horizontal axis , and are rotated @xmath19 and @xmath20 with respect to the vertical axis to enable unambiguous three - dimensional tracking of charged particles .",
    "the cross section of the strips is triangular with a base edge of 3.4  cm and a height of 1.7  cm . in the center of each strip",
    "is a wavelength - shifting optical fiber which is mirrored at one end and read out by a 64-channel multi - anode photomultiplier tube at the other .",
    "a hit is defined as an energy deposit in a single scintillator strip .",
    "the uncalibrated hit time is the time of the earliest charge recorded on a single channel , with an electronics resolution of 2.2  ns . when a charge threshold is exceeded , charge is integrated for 151  ns such that subsequent energy deposits in one strip due to the same neutrino interaction accumulate onto one hit .",
    "in particular , the timing of a delayed @xmath0decay product is lost if the decay particle overlaps spatially with prompt energy due to other particles produced in the neutrino interaction . because of this effect , the reconstruction efficiency depends on the particle multiplicity .",
    "the timing resolution is a function of the number of observed photoelectrons ( pe ) because it is based on the decay of the fluors in the scintillator and wavelength - shifting fiber .",
    "for many - pe hits , the timestamp will come from light that resulted from very prompt decays of the scintillator and fiber ; at smaller numbers of pe , the recorded hit times are delayed relative to the true time of the energy deposition .",
    "the timing resolution is 10  ns for 1 - 2 pe hits , 3  ns for 6 - 12 pe hits due to minimum ionizing particles , and approaches the 2.2  ns resolution of the electronics asymptotically at very high pulse heights .",
    "timing information is first used to separate multiple neutrino interactions within a single 10 @xmath21s beam pulse .",
    "hits are sorted by their time , and a scan is performed to find 80-ns windows where the total energy exceeds a threshold .",
    "the window is moved forward in time until the threshold is no longer met .",
    "this algorithm reliably separates neutrino interactions which occur 100  ns apart , and keeps a @xmath0and its decay products together .",
    "the design , calibration and performance of the minervadetector , including the calibration of the timing response , is described in detail in ref .",
    "the hit timing in the data acquisition system is described in ref .",
    "the data for this measurement were collected between march 2010 and april 2012 , corresponding to @xmath22 protons on target ( pot ) .",
    "the horn current was configured to focus positive pions , resulting in a @xmath1-enriched beam with 10% @xmath23contamination which is largely in the high - energy tail of the flux .",
    "the neutrino beam is simulated by a geant4-based model  @xcite that is tuned to agree with hadron production measurements on carbon  @xcite by the procedure described in ref .",
    "uncertainties on the neutrino flux arise from the statistical and systematic uncertainties in these hadron production experiments , as well as uncertainties in the beamline geometry and alignment  @xcite .",
    "the integrated neutrino flux is estimated to be @xmath24{cm^{-2}/pot}$ ] .",
    "table  [ tab : nu_flux ] lists the flux as a function of energy ."
