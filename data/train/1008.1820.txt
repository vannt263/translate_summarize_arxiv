    "breakthroughs in numerical relativity during this decade have made it possible to simulate , via evolution of the full 3d einstein equations , binary black hole dynamics through inspiral , merger and ringdown of the remnant single black hole  @xcite ( see e.  g.  recent reviews  @xcite ) .",
    "inspiraling binaries are among the most promising sources of gravitational waves for the network of laser interferometric detectors such as ligo  @xcite and virgo  @xcite . through the construction of templates for matched filtering , waveforms extracted from numerical - relativity simulations are expected to facilitate the detection of genuine gravitational waveforms by interferometric detectors .",
    "early attempts to evolve the einstein equations relied on the arnowitt - deser - misner ( adm ) decomposition  @xcite .",
    "the resulting adm system proved only weakly hyperbolic when expressed in first - order form , a fact partly accounting for difficulties associated with its numerical evolution  @xcite .",
    "difficulties in evolving black - hole solutions to the einstein equations also stem from singularities , gauge conditions within the computational domain , and unstable constraint violation .",
    "for over ten years , the goal of accurate and stable numerical integration of the einstein equations has continuously spurred the interest of numericists and theorists alike , leading to a wealth of new formalisms @xcite ( this list is not exhaustive ) .    to evolve binary black holes ,",
    "numerical relativists currently use one of the following versions of the einstein equations : the generalized harmonic ( gh ) system @xcite or the baumgarte - shapiro - shibata - nakamura ( bssn ) system @xcite . using a finite - difference approach with adaptive mesh refinement ,",
    "pretorius  @xcite used a constraint - suppressing second - order form of the gh system ( suggested by gundlach et al .",
    "@xcite ) to evolve a binary through inspiral , merger and ringdown .",
    "lindblom et al .",
    "@xcite recast the second - order gh system into a first - order symmetric - hyperbolic evolution system with constraint suppression comparable to that of the second - order system .",
    "this first - order gh system has been used to successfully simulate binary black holes evolution with nodal spectral ( pseudospectral ) methods  @xcite .",
    "more recently , ref .",
    "@xcite has introduced a new penalty method for nodal spectral evolutions of spatially second - order wave equations .",
    "this work provides a foundation for solution of the second - order gh system via spectral methods , and has been used to evolve the kerr solution @xcite and the inspiral of binaries . typically written in a spatially second - order form ,",
    "the bssn system  @xcite has seen widespread use by numerical relativity groups that employ finite - difference techniques to evolve binaries .",
    "@xcite presented a nodal spectral code to evolve the bssn system in second - order form .",
    "the system proved unstable when tested on a single black hole .",
    "in more recent work @xcite , longer evolutions were obtained through the adoption of better gauge conditions , filtering methods , and more distant outer boundaries .",
    "the bssn system has also been evolved in a first - order strongly - hyperbolic formulation for a single black hole with nodal spectral methods  @xcite .",
    "such evolutions of a single black hole exhibited instabilities similar to those reported in ref .",
    ".    corresponding to the two versions of the einstein equations discussed in the last paragraph are two distinct techniques for the treatment of singularities in numerical relativity .",
    "evolutions based on the gh system have used black - hole excision , whereby the interior of an apparent horizon is removed ( excised ) from the computational domain .",
    "this technique relies on horizon - tracking and gauge conditions which ensure that inner boundaries of the computational domain are pure out - flow , whence no inner boundary conditions are needed .",
    "evolutions based on the bssn system have relied on the moving - punctures technique  @xcite , also coined  natural excision . \" technically much easier to implement than excision , this technique features mild central singularities which evolve freely in the computational domain .",
    "initially these puncture points may represent either asymptotically flat regions or  trumpets . \"",
    "hannam et al .",
    "first discussed cylindrical asymptotics in moving puncture evolutions @xcite , see also @xcite .    relative to the alternative systems",
    "previously discussed , the bssn system in second order form affords an easier treatment of singularities and features a relatively small number of geometric variables directly related to the foliation of spacetime into spacelike hypersurfaces .",
    "however , to date , spectral methods for black - hole binaries have been successfully implemented only for the first - order gh system .",
    "the binary black hole problem is essentially a smooth one ( singularities reside on sets of measure zero censored by horizons ) , and spectral methods exhibit well - established advantages over finite - difference methods for long - time simulation of such problems @xcite .",

    "in fact , this spherical reduction relies on freedom present in the generalized bssn system , since spherical - polar coordinates should not be associated with a unit - determinant conformal metric .",
    "although we work with the spherically reduced _ generalized _ bssn system ( subject to brown s lagrangian condition , to be precise ) , we will nevertheless describe it as the spherically reduced bssn system .",

    "<S> we present a high - order accurate discontinuous galerkin method for evolving the spherically - reduced baumgarte - shapiro - shibata - nakamura ( bssn ) system expressed in terms of second - order spatial operators . </S>",
    "<S> our multi - domain method achieves global spectral accuracy and long - time stability on short computational domains . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss in detail both our scheme for the bssn system and its implementation . after a theoretical and computational verification of the proposed scheme , we conclude with a brief discussion of issues likely to arise when one considers the full bssn system . </S>"
