    "as the simulation evolves , the time varying gravitational force of the binary truncates the inner edge of the circumbinary disc and excites various lindblad resonances within the disc .",
    "the gap , cleared quickly in about 100 binary orbits , is preserved by a balance of resonant and viscous torques within the disc @xcite . for larger gaps , corotation and lindblad resonances can fall within the evacuated region removing their influence from the system .",
    "these resonances , especially those closest to the inner edge of the disc , can drive evolution in the binary s orbital elements @xcite and pump eccentricity in the disc @xcite .",
    "therefore , in order to understand the subsequent dynamical evolution of both the binary and the disc , the inner disc edge structure must be understood to see which resonances may play a role .",

    "our results are also consistent with the findings of @xcite who show that for binary mass ratios above @xmath12 as is the case for our simulations , a hollow central cavity forms around the secondary within the circumbinary disc",
    ". gaps of this size tend to remove the eccentricity - damping 1:2 corotation resonance while leaving the 1:3 eolr as the closest to the inner disc edge at a radius of @xmath13 suggesting that this resonance dominates the evolution of the binary s eccentricity and semimajor axis @xcite .    to verify the absence of the 1:2 corotation resonance and prominence of the 1:3 eolr ,",

    "the surface density at the 1:3 eolr is at least an order of magnitude larger than at the 1:2 corotation resonance when it is present within the disc .",
    "since the gap opens rather quickly , in of order 5 years for the kepler 38 binary , this finding supports the hypothesis that the 1:3 eolr will be the dominant resonance within the disc that will drive subsequent evolution within the system .",
    "the structure and eccentricity of the protoplanetary disc was examined over @xmath1 binary periods in over 230 snapshots for each simulation to track how it evolves with the central binary .",
    "a central binary excites eccentricity in the surrounding circumbinary disc via resonant gravitational interactions @xcite .",
    "previous simulations of circumbinary discs @xcite found that disc eccentricity increases due to interactions that occur at the 1:3 eolr . to explain why the disc becomes eccentric , @xcite showed that disc eccentricity growth occurs via a parametric instability driven by coupling between the binary s tidal potential and a disc @xmath2 mode due to a small initial disc eccentricity .",
    "this coupling excites an @xmath5 spiral wave from the 1:3 eolr that removes angular momentum from the disc at constant energy making the gas orbits eccentric .",
    "the material at the 1:3 eolr rotates more slowly that the orbital pattern speed allowing the resonant torques to grow eccentricity in the system through the @xmath5 wave .",
    "we therefore expect our circumbinary discs to become eccentric as well . to explore this effect in our simulations , we computed the disc eccentricity via a mass average following the prescription of @xcite    @xmath16    where @xmath17 is the local surface density and the integral was evaluated out to a radius of 3 au over 50 radial bins .",
    "the disc eccentricity in each radial bin was taken to be the mass - weighted average of the eccentricity of all gas particles within the bin assuming the particles orbit the system s barycenter .",
    "we neglected the influence of gas pressure in this calculation .",
    "for all simulations , disc eccentricity growth is observed and consistent with the results of the similar gaseous circumbinary disc simulations of @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . the disc eccentricity change over time for each simulation",

    "up to @xmath19 , less eccentricity growth occurs indicating that more eccentric binaries tend to produce less eccentric discs .    for non - zero @xmath15 , the disc eccentricity grows linearly with a periodic modulation .",
    "the period of this disc eccentricity oscillation is similar to the inner disc edge clump precession timescale discussed in section [ discstructevolution ] below suggesting that the clump impacts the disc s eccentricity modulation , but only when the binary is sufficiently eccentric .",
    "this finding is consistent with the work of @xcite who explain that the inner disc edge precesses with a period of @xmath20 binary periods when @xmath21 .",
    "we find that the global disc eccentricity growth is predominantly due to the inner edge of the disc becoming eccentric .",
    "[ fig : figure3 ] shows the disc eccentricity versus radius for simulations 1 - 5 after about 520 years of evolution . for binaries with @xmath18 , disc inner edge eccentricities are of order 0.4 while more eccentric binaries tend to produce less eccentric inner edges .        to understand the eccentricity growth of our circumbinary discs ,",
    "specifically why less eccentric binaries tend to produce more eccentric discs , we turn to the theory of @xcite .",
    "@xcite explains that a nonlinear coupling between the binary and a small initial disc eccentricity excites an @xmath5 wave from the 1:3 eolr within the disc with a resonant forcing pattern speed @xmath22 for binary orbital frequency @xmath23 .",

    "this wave removes angular momentum from the disc , accounting for the increase in disc eccentricity .",
    "disc eccentricity growth as a function of @xmath15 depends on how strongly the binary couples to the disc .",
    "when strong coupling occurs , both the binary and inner disc edge grow to similar eccentricities while weak coupling results in the less massive of the binary or the disc inner edge developing appreciable eccentricity . for initially circular binaries , @xcite described strong coupling as occurring when the disc mass within the gap radius is comparable to the mass of the secondary . for our simulations ,",
    "the mass of the secondary is roughly an order of magnitude larger than the mass of the entire disc , so we expect the binary to be weakly coupled to the disc resulting in significant disc eccentricity growth as is observed in our simulations ( see fig .",

    ", the @xcite strong coupling criterion does not apply .",
    "instead , we note that the time - averaged orbit of an eccentric binary corresponds to an azimuthal @xmath2 mode perturbation to a circular orbit .",
    "this @xmath2 mode couples to the @xmath2 mode of the eccentric inner disc edge , placing the system in the strong coupling regime causing the disc eccentricity and @xmath15 to grow to similar magnitudes , as is observed in our simulations ( see fig .",

    "for @xmath25 , this can be understood as intermediate coupling .",
    "the initial binary eccentricity is not low enough to conform exactly to the @xcite criterion and is not large enough to couple strongly to the disc inner edge resulting in an intermediate coupling with larger disc eccentricity growth than the @xmath26 case and also appreciable @xmath15 growth that is still less than the @xmath26 case ( see section [ binaryevolution ] ) . for the @xmath24 case",
    ", the binary eccentricity may be large enough that higher order resonances in the disc begin to impact the evolution @xcite , potentially accounting for the system s departure from expected behavior .      the gravitational influence of the binary forces several major changes within the structure of the circumbinary disc .",
    "to explore how the structure of the disc changes with time and @xmath15 , we examined the orbits of gas particles and how they vary with distance from the binary . to accomplish this ,",
    "two - dimensional histograms of all gas particles within a radial distance of 3 au from the barycenter were made for each snapshot .",

    "the existence of this knot is consistent with the identification of a similar overdense lump located at the inner edge of gaseous circumbinary accretion discs about binary black holes from 2d simulations by @xcite .",
    "an additional structure identified in the disc is a single arm ( @xmath2 ) spiral wave launched from near the inner edge of the disc as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : figure5 ] .",
    "the spiral wave is an alignment of gas particle longitude of periastrons relative to the binary s . for the initial @xmath26 simulation",
    ", the wave develops rapidly within the first 50 years , or about @xmath32 binary periods .",
    "recent n - body simulations of circumbinary planetesimal discs by @xcite confirmed the presence of an @xmath2 wave discs about eccentric binaries .",
    "when under the influence of an asymmetric gaseous disc potential , @xcite identified the wave as a preferential alignment of planetesimal longitude of periastrons as a function of orbital radius around the eccentric binary of the kepler 16 system , similar to the spiral wave found in this work .        in our simulations ,",
    "the spiral wave s orientation remains locked to the binary s slow prograde @xmath30 precession throughout the entire simulation , although a slight drift of a degree or so does occur .",
    "the wave s fixed orientation relative to the binary is an important effect whose consequences will be examined more carefully in section [ binaryevolution ] .",
    "simply put , if the wave did circulate relative to the binary , it s long term effect on the system , if any , would average out to zero , so the fixed orientation could indeed dynamically impact the system .    note that in the simulation with an initial @xmath33 ( left panel ) , no spiral @xmath2 arm exists in contrast to the @xmath26 simulation ( right panel ) which shows a prominent spiral arm .",
    "the arm is also observed in the simulation with initial @xmath24 but not with initial @xmath34 .",
    "since the spiral arm is only observed when the binary has an appreciable eccentricity , we can infer that a coupling between binary eccentricity and the inner disc edge impacts its formation .    to investigate the role of binary eccentricity in exciting the wave , simulation 3 was ran with initial @xmath25 to see if the spiral wave could be excited with an intermediate @xmath15 between the two regimes identified above . in the intermediate regime as explained in section [ disceccevolution ] , @xmath15 is not large enough to be strongly coupled to the disc while also not low enough to weakly couple to the disc to drive disc eccentricity . from the onset of the initial @xmath25 simulation , a faint @xmath2 spiral wave appeared and",
    "gradually strengthened as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : figure6 ] . the wave , initially weak , became more apparent after about 900 years .",
    "the @xmath2 spiral arm in this simulation does not become as pronounced as the one seen in the initial @xmath26 simulation , suggesting that the strength of the arm depends on @xmath15 and supporting the notion that this disc - binary system undergoes an intermediate coupling .",
    "we again apply the theory of @xcite to understand the origin and behavior of the spiral wave .",
    "we know from section [ disceccevolution ] that a nonlinear coupling between non - zero disc eccentricity and the binary s tidal potential excites an @xmath5 spiral density wave from the 1:3 eolr that mediates angular momentum transfer in the system .",
    "also , we have shown that the strength of the coupling between the binary and disc , which depends on @xmath15 , determines the magnitude of the disc inner edge eccentricity .",
    "additional structural changes within the disc proceed via a higher order coupling .    in @xcite ,",
    "the authors show that the @xmath35 density wave emitted at the 1:3 eolr can couple back through the binary tidal potential .",
    "this additional coupling produces a time independent @xmath2 wave and an associated potential .",
    "the extra potential from the @xmath2 wave can allow for the removal of angular momentum from the system via resonant torques .",
    "the @xmath2 wave produced via the recoupling mechanism is precisely the @xmath2 spiral wave identified in this work .",
    "the presence of the @xmath2 wave was reconfirmed via a fourier decomposition of the disc surface density .",
    "since we only observe the @xmath2 spiral wave in discs around eccentric binaries , we infer that this recoupling mechanism only occurs when the disc and binary are strongly coupled .",
    "@xcite s observation of a @xmath2 spiral wave present in their simulation of a planetesimal disc surrounding the eccentric kepler 16 binary support this argument .",
    "since the orientation of the @xmath2 wave in our simulations remains locked to that of the binary s , it does not circulate and hence is independent of time .",
    "also , as we will explore in section [ binaryevolution ] , the additional potential from the @xmath2 resonantly torques on the binary causing evolution in its orbital eccentricity .",
    "next we examine why the orientation of the spiral wave remains fixed relative to the binary .",
    "we apply the analytic theory for circumbinary orbits of @xcite to partially explain this effect .",
    "the theory , accurate to first order in @xmath15 , decomposes the orbit of a test particle about two stars into a superposition of the circular motion of a guiding center and the radial and vertical epicyclic motion due to the non - axisymmetric components of the binary s potential .",
    "@xcite give the equations for the precession rate of the argument of periastron , @xmath23 , and the longitude of the ascending node , @xmath29 , respectfully , to be @xmath36    @xmath37    where @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the masses of the primary and secondary stars , respectively , @xmath40 is the binary semimajor axis and @xmath41 is the radial distance from the barycenter .",
    "since these rates are approximately equal and opposite , one expects a gas particle s longitude of periastron , as defined earlier , to remain fixed , as is observed for the spiral waves in our simulations about sufficiently eccentric binaries . in the context of gaseous circumbinary discs ,",
    "this interpretation has a few potential shortcomings .",
    "first , a given gas particle does not live in isolation since it feels the effects of disc self gravity and pressure gradients within the disc that can impact its orbit .",
    "also since this theory is only linear in @xmath15 , its applicability could lessen as the binary becomes more eccentric due to interactions with the disc .",
    "however , the binaries considered have low to moderate eccentricities and the discs are rather low - mass such that disc self gravity is negligible so the gravitational influence of the binary should dominate",
    ". therefore , we expect this theory to still provide a decent approximate explanation for why the spiral arm remains fixed relative to the binary .",
    "secular theory @xcite and previous simulations @xcite show that angular momentum losses to a disc change the central binary s orbital elements .",
    "angular momentum loss occurs mainly through resonant gravitational torques at the lindblad and corotation resonances . in the case of binary stars embedded in an external disc , loss of angular momentum",
    "can result in changes to the binary eccentricity and semimajor axis . for unequal mass binary stars with low to moderate eccentricity",
    ", the majority of eccentricity growth is due to resonant torques at the 1:3 eolr .",
    "this resonance dominates since these systems tend to open a gap in the disc such that the 1:3 eolr resides nearest to the inner edge of the disc while the eccentricity damping 1:2 corotation resonance lies within the evacuated region @xcite .",
    "simulations of binaries embedded in circumbinary discs by @xcite agree with this interpretation as they identified gravitational torque density peaks responsible for binary eccentricity evolution located at the 1:3 eolr in the disc . for the simulations presented in this work , we expect a secular increase in binary eccentricity and decrease in semimajor axis as the binary loses angular momentum to circumbinary disc .        as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : figure4 ] , binary eccentricity for initially eccentric binaries grows over the duration of the simulation .",

    "this oscillation is due to forcing by the @xmath2 potential of the eccentric external disc @xcite .    for all simulations ,",

    "the poor fit can be understood in the context of how the disc and binary undergo an intermediate coupling in between the strong and weak regimes .",
    "as discussed in sections [ disceccevolution ] and [ discstructevolution ] , the binary eccentricity is not large enough to launch a prominent @xmath2 spiral wave and drive the eccentricity growth for more eccentric binaries . in between regimes",

    "as the binary eccentricity grows with time , it will eventually reach @xmath19 and will then begin to strongly couple to the gaseous disc .",
    "as discussed previously , strong coupling launches a @xmath2 spiral wave in the disc and increases the growth rate of binary eccentricity .",
    "also in the strongly coupled regime , we expect the disc eccentricity to decrease from higher values and be similar in magnitude to the binary eccentricity .    in a similar vein for nearly circular binaries ,",
    "we expect them to remain circular .",
    "other simulations of binaries embedded in circumbinary discs such as those by @xcite and @xcite have found that initially circular binaries eventually develop appreciable non - zero eccentricities .",
    "this behavior can be understood by examining equation [ eqn : total_deda ] .",
    "if the binary is perturbed and some non - zero eccentricity develops , we would expect the binary eccentricity to grow very slowly , gradually strengthening the coupling between the disc and binary until intermediate coupling is reached and the system progresses as described above .",
    "this picture is consistent with the results of @xcite who found the binary eccentricity began to grow on timescales longer than those explored in this work .",
    "therefore over timescales much longer than simulated here , we would expect our initial @xmath68 case to become appreciably eccentric .",
    "we extrapolate the results of our simulations to longer timescales and consider the consequences below .",
    "we ran additional simulations to ensure that the 1:3 eolr did indeed dominate binary evolution and no other effect played a major role . to do this ,",
    "a shorter simulation with an initial binary eccentricity of 0.1032 was performed with the initial disc gap radius located outside of the 1:3 eolr .",
    "minimal binary eccentricity growth and effectively no binary semimajor axis decay occurred until the disc viscously spread inward .",
    "additionally , the @xmath2 spiral wave observed in other simulations of sufficiently eccentric binaries also did not exist until mass was able to drift inward and accumulate at the 1:3 eolr at which point the @xmath15 and @xmath40 began to evolve .",
    "these findings support the supposition that interactions with the 1:3 eolr drives the binary evolution as anticipated .    to study what effect ,",
    "if any , accretion has on the how the binary stars orbital elements vary , a procedure similar to that used by @xcite was performed . for a given simulation",
    "each accretion event was tracked such that the accreted gas particle s mass and velocity components were outputted . using these events , @xmath15 and @xmath40",

    "this test demonstrated that accretion had a negligible effect on @xmath15 and @xmath40 .",
    "therefore , it is safe to assume that the evolution of the binary orbital elements is primarily driven by interactions with the external disc , in particular at the 1:3 eolr for the systems considered in this work .",
    "previous studies have examined how varying disc properties can change how a circumbinary disc evolves .",
    "for example , @xcite showed that disc eccentricity is sensitive to the initial disc surface density gradient and aspect ratio . here , we analyse the results of simulations that vary disc mass , gas resolution , and aspect ratio in order to examine how disc properties impact the disc - binary coevolution .      to study how our results vary with disc mass",

    ", we expect the disc to be strongly coupled to the eccentric binary since the coupling only depends on the magnitude of binary eccentricity .",

    "are still well - described by equation [ eqn : total_deda ] and hence correspond to either faster or slower binary evolution timescales .      to ensure that our simulations were sufficiently resolved , we ran two additional simulations , simulations 9 and 10 , which has decreased and increased the initial number of gas particles by a factor of 2 to @xmath73 and @xmath74 , respectively .",

    "this suggests that the clump which dominates the disc eccentricity does not form into a coherent structure , indicating that n@xmath75 might not be large enough to properly resolve all the physics at the disc inner edge .",
    "we find that the @xmath2 spiral wave appears in the disc indicating that the binary strongly couples to the disc as we expect from our previous simulations .",

    "additionally , we again observed a prominent @xmath2 spiral wave within the disc that behaved identically to its simulation 4 counterpart .",
    "one disagreement between simulation 10 and simulation 4 is that the higher resolution simulation displayed less binary semimajor axis decay .",

    "we therefore expect a higher resolution run with smaller @xmath53 and hence smaller @xmath51 to exhibit less binary semimajor axis decay due to dissipation from the viscous disc .",
    "since the main effects explored in this work , the binary eccentricity evolution and the accompanying development of disc eccentricity and structure , are in good agreement between the standard and higher resolution runs , we find that our nominal resolution of n@xmath78 is sufficient .",
    "simulations of accretion discs around binary black holes have examined the effects of larger aspect ratio discs , mainly focusing on accretion rates .",

[ fig : figure9 ] .",
    "we found that the thicker disc resulted in greater binary semimajor axis decay and eccentricity growth compared to the fiducial simulation 4 .",
    "the increased binary semimajor axis decay agrees with the theoretical expectation of @xcite who estimate that @xmath83 .",
    "the enhanced binary eccentricity growth follows as a consequence of equation [ eqn : deda ] .    in simulation 11 ,",

    "[ fig : figure5 ] .",
    "the disc also displayed larger eccentricity initially but it did not grow appreciably over the course of the simulation .",
    "the coevolution of a binary with a gaseous circumbinary disc , primarily driven by resonant interactions at the 1:3 eolr , has several important consequences for the subsequent dynamical evolution of the system .",
    "as shown above , an eccentric binary system tends to gain eccentricity and experience a secular decay in semimajor axis due to viscous and resonant interactions with the disc .",
    "this evolution not only changes due to additional feedback with the disc , but also impacts regions in the disc where planets form and migrate .      n - body simulations of an unequal mass binary embedded in a protoplanetary disc by @xcite found rapid semimajor axis decay leading the authors to suggest that the binary separation may become small enough that tidal effects or even stellar coalescence may occur for such systems",
    ". tides between stellar companions tend to circularize the orbit over long timescales once the stellar separation becomes sufficiently small .",
    "detailed studies of companions to sun - like stars by @xcite and measurements of solar - type spectroscopic binaries in m35 by @xcite both found that binaries from these populations with periods less than about 10 days tend to be circularized .",
    "theoretical work on the premain - sequence evolution of @xmath85 @xmath86 binaries by @xcite demonstrate that binaries with orbital periods of about 8 days or less are tidally circularized with effectively all of the circularization occurring before the stars reach the main - sequence . for binaries with an initial period slightly greater than the @xmath87 day tidal circularization boundary embedded in a circumbinary disc , binary - disc interactions could potentially decrease @xmath40 enough to make tidal effects important for subsequent evolution given that the lifetimes of protoplanetary discs are of order 1 myr @xcite .",
    "in addition , we would expect some longer period binaries to develop appreciable eccentricity through this mechanism .",
    "observations of spectroscopic binaries discussed by @xcite show that a large number of such binaries have large eccentricities , some up to @xmath88 , suggesting that disc - binary interactions may in fact be an important mechanism in pumping binary eccentricity",
    ". ideally , additional observations of binaries with circumbinary planets , systems guaranteed to have had protoplanetary discs , will allow us to better constrain and model this effect .",
    "the extent to which disc - binary interactions impact astrophysical systems over the disc s lifetime is difficult to measure . over the course of the disc s lifetime",
    ", what may occur is some process that removes the 1:3 eolr from the disc . as @xmath40 decays through disc - binary interactions , the location of the 1:3 eolr shifts inwards .",
    "also as @xmath15 grows , the central gap size increases @xcite .",
    "the combined @xmath40 and @xmath15 evolution could result in the 1:3 eolr moving into the evacuated disc gap , removing its influence from the system , leaving higher order resonances to influence the binary .",
    "for binaries with large @xmath15 , @xcite speculates that the combination of higher order inner and outer lindblad resonances and corotation resonances should combine to reduce the magnitude of @xmath6 and @xmath7 , potentially preventing subsequent evolution .",
    "this picture is not so simple , however , as simulations of binary smbhs embedded in gaseous discs by @xcite and @xcite both find that binary eccentricity growth continues to @xmath89 where this growth did not slow until @xmath90 .",
    "we note that the simulations of @xcite assumed a fixed @xmath40 which neglects the inward motion of the resonances as @xmath40 decays , potentially leaving them in the evacuated region , removing their effects from the system .",
    "the impact of higher order resonances on binary evolution is a complicated matter that requires proper treatment in which both the binary and disc are allowed to coevolve together and likely depends on disc structure and artificial viscosity implementation .",
    "additionally , findings by @xcite show that in principle , there is no limit to the amount of angular momentum that can be lost by a central binary to an external disc suggesting that binary coalescence is not as unrealistic as it sounds .",
    "we caution that when performing simulations of binaries embedded in a gaseous disc that explore the role of semimajor axis decay , one should ensure that their observed semimajor axis decay has converged as both resolution and non - trivial effects such as accretion ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) can have a substantial impact .",
    "one effect not explored in this work is the possibility of kozai - lidov ( kl ) oscillations for the general case of a misalign discs in binary systems . for an inclined test particle orbiting one component of a binary ,",
    "periodic kl oscillations allow for the particle s eccentricity to grow at the expense of its inclination @xcite .",
    "for the case of an inclined circumstellar disc about one component of the binary , @xcite found that the disc can exhibit kl cycles with the periodic disc eccentricity maxima approaching @xmath91 .",
    "a later study of similar systems by @xcite demonstrated that misaligned discs can become much more extended than coplanar discs and potentially could overflow the roche lobe of the star .",
    "simulations of misaligned circumbinary discs by @xcite showed that discs of almost all inclinations can tear leading to massive accretion and potentially a merger of the central binary .",
    "given these results in the general case of systems with misaligned circumbinary discs , the binary eccentricity evolution is likely significantly impacted by the disc evolution and depart from the results presented here for thin , coplanar discs .",
    "the disc , if misaligned , could reach large eccentricities due to kl oscillations and via interactions with the binary if it does not tear .",
    "if the disc does in fact tear , the binary would likely not couple with the disc at all but could in fact coalesce as demonstrated by @xcite .",
    "the general case of a binary coupling with an inclined circumbinary disc is greatly complicated by kl oscillations , torque scaling with inclination and the potential for tearing and warrants a more robust future study .",
    "the observed orbital elements of binary stars that host a circumbinary planet are the product of a complex evolutionary history . from fig .",
    "[ fig : figure4 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : figure7 ] , we see that for systems similar to the ones considered in this work , appreciable changes can occur on order @xmath1 binary orbits .",
    "as shown in section [ varyingdiscmass ] , the mass of the disc strongly influences the binary evolution .",
    "more massive discs , for example , drive much faster @xmath15 growth and @xmath40 decay .",
    "faster dynamical binary evolution due to massive discs could be particularly relevant for _ kepler _ circumbinary planets as the work of @xcite suggests that these circumbinary planets formed and migrated in massive discs .",
    "additionally , disc - binary interactions can make planet formation more difficult .",
    "simulations by @xcite identified an @xmath2 spiral wave in the circumbinary disc that corresponds to an alignment of planetesimal longitudes of periastron .",
    "this wave , whose origin was explained in this work , caused an increase in erosive planetesimal collisions making in - situ formation difficult in circumbinary protoplanetary discs .",
    "the decay of @xmath40 via disc - binary interactions also causes the inward shift of mean motion and lindblad resonances .",
    "these resonances can significantly impact the orbital stability of local objects in the disc in several important ways .",
    "for the restricted three body problem , resonance overlapping can lead to stochastic orbital evolution as shown from the criterion derived by @xcite . for the case of binary orbital evolution driven by tides ,",
    "@xcite point out that evolving binary eccentricity and semimajor axis changes the location of critical resonances and hence where they overlap , potentially making stable systems unstable over time .",
    "the location of mean motion resonances also dictate where circumbinary planets may reside .",
    "the numerical integrations of both @xcite and @xcite show that many circumbinary planets lie in a stable region shepherded by unstable mean motion resonances . if @xmath40 evolves significantly on short enough timescales , so too do the locations of the resonances , sweeping inward and potentially destabilizing orbits .",
    "we note , however , that @xmath40 evolution appears to be a resolution dependent effect which future work should address .",
    "this behavior is of particular importance for studies of planetary migration in circumbinary discs .",
    "studies of circumbinary planetary migration in a viscous , eccentric disc find that planets tend to migrate inwards until they are trapped in or near the 4:1 mean motion resonance in the region of stability identified by @xcite @xcite .",
    "since the resonances and the region of stability move as binary eccentricity and semimajor axis evolve , the final location and stability of migrating planets in circumbinary discs is sensitive to binary evolution . simulations of circumbinary systems , especially those using n - body sph methods like the ones presented in this work , must ensure that they properly account for the disc - binary interactions .",
    "in this work , we showed that unequal mass binary stars embedded in a circumbinary gaseous disc carved out a gap in the disc and caused structural changes within the disc .",
    "resonant interactions with the binary at the 1:3 eolr excited disc eccentricity .",
    "sufficiently eccentric binaries excited a @xmath2 spiral wave within the disc .",
    "this wave corresponded to an alignment of gas particle longitude of periastrons that varied with radius . the spiral wave formed within 50 years for discs about sufficiently eccentric binaries but took longer to strengthen for less eccentric binaries ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : figure5 ] ) .",
    "eccentric binary stars became more eccentric and experienced a secular decrease in semimajor axis while initially nearly circular binaries underwent no eccentricity growth over the timescales considered .",
    "eccentricity growth within the system was understood in the context of the theory of @xcite in which nonlinear coupling between non - zero disc eccentricity and the binary s tidal potential excites an @xmath5 spiral density wave from the 1:3 eolr that mediates angular momentum transfer in the system .",
    "nearly circular binaries weakly couple to the external disc and drive the inner disc edge to become very eccentric .",
    "eccentric binaries , however , strongly couple to the disc leading to eccentricity growth for both the disc and binary .",
    "the origin of the @xmath2 wave within the disc is understood as a recoupling of the @xmath92 spiral density wave with the binary tidal potential .",
    "this model does have limited applicability as disc gap size scales with @xmath15 , so the 1:3 eolr could fall within the evacuated region removing its effect from the system , potentially slowing down binary evolution . for simulations of gaseous circumbinary discs , we caution that the disc - binary interaction must be sufficiently accounted for to properly model the system .",
    "we leave the characterization of the long - term impact of disc - binary interactions to future work",
    ".    limitations of this work include the difficulty in integrating the binary orbit .",
    "since the binary feels the force of every other sph particle in our simulations and is integrated using changa s native leapfrog integrator , very conservative timestepping was employed to ensure that the binary orbit was well - resolved and physically accurate .",
    "the conservative timestepping scheme significantly slowed our simulations . in light of this limitation ,",
    "potential future work could include running a long - term higher resolution simulation over at least @xmath93 binary orbits for small yet non - zero @xmath15 in order to better characterize how the disc and binary coevolve .",
    "additional future work could involve examining equal mass binaries or binaries with larger eccentricities than those explored in this work . since binaries with large eccentricities excite higher order resonances within the disc ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and carve out gaps that could remove the 1:3 eolr from the disc @xcite , it would be interesting to examine how these other resonances can impact binary evolution .",
