    "the low energy behavior of qcd , and therefore lattice qcd , is effectively described by the chiral lagrangian . approaching the massless limit",
    ", the pion s compton wave length becomes longer than the spatial extent of the lattice , and the zero momentum modes dominate the partition function .",
    "this is the so - called @xmath0-regime of qcd , where various properties of the qcd partition function is known analytically @xcite .",
    "for instance , for one - flavor qcd the partition function is given by @xmath2 for finite @xmath3 at the leading order . here , @xmath4 is the quark mass , @xmath5 is the chiral condensate , and @xmath6 is the space - time volume . it can be divided into topological sectors as @xmath7 where @xmath8 denotes the modified bessel function , and @xmath9 is the topological charge .",
    "for lattice qcd to study the small quark mass region , it is therefore the first step to confirm such analytic results .",
    "eventually one can determine the low energy constants of chiral perturbation theory by measuring correlation functions in the @xmath0-regime , as discussed for example in @xcite .",
    "in this exploratory study we investigate the mass dependence of the partition function , the sum rules for eigenvalues of the dirac operator , as well as the topological susceptibility .",
    "the effect of low - lying fermion eigenmodes is incorporated using the reweighting technique , and thus we study the above relations in the one - flavor @xmath1 = 1 case .",
    "since the chiral symmetry is essential in deriving the partition function in the @xmath0-regime , we employ the overlap dirac operator @xmath10 $ ] . to compute the sign function @xmath11 , 14 lowest eigenmodes of @xmath12",
    "are treated exactly and we used the chebyshev polynomial of degree 100 - 200 to approximate the rest of the eigenmodes . on a @xmath13 lattice at @xmath14 = 5.85 we calculated 50 lowest eigenvalues of @xmath15 using the implicit restarted arnoldi method ( arpack ) .",
    "the topological charge is obtained from the number of zero modes for each gauge configuration , and we accumulated 168 , 290 , and 149 configurations for @xmath16 = 0 , 1 , and 2 , respectively .",
    "in order to study the effect of fermion determinant , we use an approximation to include only the low - lying fermion eigenmodes .",
    "namely , the fermion determinant is replaced by a product @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the @xmath19-th lowest eigenvalue of the overlap dirac operator @xmath15 for a given configuration .",
    "if @xmath20 is large enough to cover physically relevant eigenmodes , this approximation is expected to reproduce the right physics . for our choice of parameters @xmath21 lies around 700  mev , and therefore should already be large enough to be treated as the ultraviolet mode .",
    "the neglected eigenmodes are the ultraviolet modes , which should be irrelevant to the low energy physics .",
    "such idea was implemented previously as an algorithm for the wilson fermion @xcite , in which the ultraviolet modes are also incorporated using either the effective gauge action or the multi - boson method .",
    "see also @xcite .    in order to demonstrate how the truncation works , in fig .",
    "[ fig : trdt1 ] we plot a correlation between the truncated determinants with @xmath20 = 10 and 50 for @xmath4 = 0 .",
    "each dot in the plot represents a gauge configuration , and the strong correlation among the different truncation indicates that the product @xmath22 is mostly independent of gauge configuration . in fig .",
    "[ fig : trdt2 ] we show how the truncated determinant varies as a function of @xmath20 .",
    "we can observe a rapid change below @xmath23 10 , with which the order of magnitude is determined .",
    "the values still changes slowly below @xmath23 50 , and stays almost flat above it .",
    "in fig .  [ fig : detmass_d8 ] we show the mass dependence of the partition function @xmath24 for the topological sectors @xmath16 = 0 , 1 , and 2 at @xmath1 = 1 . the truncated determinant with @xmath20 = 50 is used .",
    "we can see that the data agree with the analytic expectation @xmath25 @xcite shown by the curves . from this fit",
    "we obtain @xmath5 = ( 243 mev)@xmath26 .    by differentiating the partition function with respect to the quark mass , leutwyler and smilga obtained a sum rule for the eigenvalues @xcite @xmath27 left hand side of this equation is quadratically divergent in the ultraviolet region , since the eigenmode distribution behaves as @xmath28 in the bulk .",
    "therefore the sum rule ( [ eq : sum_rule ] ) makes sense only after the ultraviolet divergence is regulated and the particular volume dependence is extracted . here ,",
    "instead , we consider a difference of ( [ eq : sum_rule ] ) between different topological sectors .",
    "because the bulk distribution is expected to be independent of topology , the ultraviolet divergence cancels in such differences . fig .",
    "[ fig : sum_rule ] shows these differences as a function of the ultraviolet cutoff .",
    "we find that the results are completely independent of the cutoff and agree with the analytical predictions .",
    "topological susceptibility @xmath29 is obtained from the partition function by differentiating with respect to @xmath30 . on the lattice",
    "one can simply calculate the expectation value of the topological charge squared @xmath31 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : tpsus_a ] we plot @xmath32 as a function of quark mass for both @xmath1 = 0 and 1 .",
    "near the massless limit the topological susceptibility grows linearly for @xmath1 = 1 as expected from the form of the partition function @xmath33 . for larger quark masses",
    "it saturates toward the quenched value corresponding to @xmath29 = ( 205 mev)@xmath34 .",
    "this behavior was previous observed in @xcite . by fitting the slope near the massless limit",
    "we obtain @xmath5 = ( 238  mev)@xmath26 , which agrees well with the determination from the partition function itself .",
    "using the truncated determinant approximation of the overlap dirac operator , we confirmed that the leutwyler - smilga s analytic predictions for the qcd partition function is satisfied for @xmath1 = 1 .",
    "results are stable against the number of eigenmodes included , if it is greater than 10 ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "it suggests that the dynamical fermion algorithms designed to separate low and high eigenmodes , such as @xcite , work effectively . for larger volume or smaller lattice spacing the number of eigenvalues to cover",
    "the equivalent physical region becomes much larger ( proportional to the lattice volume ) , and their calculation could be numerically prohibitive . still it would be helpful to isolate the low - lying modes , as they account for the dominant part of the fermion determinant .",
