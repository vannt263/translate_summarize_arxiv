    "40004000  = 1000            there has been a long history of interests , since the pioneering work of peebles ( ,  18 ) in the hierarchical amplitudes @xmath6 , defined as the following ratio : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the n - cumulant defined by @xmath9 , and @xmath10 is the density fluctuation smoothed on some scale .",
    "these quantities are important as a test of the gravitational instability paradigm ( e.g. ) , a probe of possibly non - gaussian initial conditions ( e.g. ) as well as a measure of the galaxy - bias ( e.g. ) .",
    "however , it has also been a puzzle for quite some time that different galaxy surveys yield discordant values for @xmath6 ( e.g. table [ s3s4 ] , for @xmath11 ) .",
    "while some of the differences no doubt arise from the fact that galaxies selected in different ways might have different galaxy - biases , not all of the differences can be convincingly explained away in such a manner .",
    "for instance , a comparison between optically selected galaxy - catalogs ( in table [ s3s4 ] ) reveal a substantial and systematic difference between the measured values of @xmath6 : redshift surveys consistently yield lower values compared to the larger angular catalogues ( e.g. compare apm / lick / edsgc values with those from cfa / ssrs in table 1 ; note that the iras galaxies are infrared - selected ; note also an exception to this rule in the measurements by ) .",
    "a rather large relative galaxy - bias between these two sets of catalogues would have to be invoked to reconcile them .",
    "three alternative explanations are possible .",
    "the first is that redshift space distortions tend to suppress @xmath6 , but it has been shown to be not sufficient to explain the systematic differences , especially on large scales ( ) .",
    "the second is that the local volume ( sampled by the redshift surveys ) just happens to have a smaller @xmath6 compared to the true @xmath6 which is presumably measured in the larger angular surveys i.e. the local universe is not a fair sample ( e.g. ) .",
    "this is related to the question of the homogeneity scale of our universe which has been a subject of some debate ( see e.g. ) .",
    "the third is to blame it on the estimator for @xmath6 : it yields a value that is on the average biased low , with the bias ( distinguish this from the _ galaxy_-bias ) getting worse as the survey becomes smaller .",
    "we will demonstrate that the third contributes to a significant fraction of the systematic differences between the different measurements . while a thorough analysis detailing exactly how much each of these factors contribute is beyond the scope of this paper",
    ", we can safely conclude that inference of large sampling fluctuations , or a large relative galaxy - bias , based on measurements of @xmath0 , are unwarranted .",
    "a very closely related estimation - bias has been discussed before by colombi et al .",
    "( ) as a finite - volume effect .",
    "they attributed this to the abrupt cut - off of the count probability at some finite number of particles because of the finite size of a survey .",
    "they proposed a way to correct for this bias by extending the tail of the count probability using a few phenomenological parameters calibrated from simulations ( see also ) .",
    "the method works reasonably well for small smoothing scales , but not for large ones , mainly because the probability - distribution - tail becomes noisy in the latter case ( colombi 1998 , private communication ) .",
    "moreover , the method is feasible only with a dense - sampled survey ( ) .",
    "more recently , szapudi & colombi ( ) and colombi et al .",
    "@xcite discussed how a finite survey - volume affects the errors ( i.e. the variance around the mean ) in the estimators of the n - cumulants @xmath8 ( or the related factorial moments ) , but not the mean or bias of the estimator for @xmath6 .",
    "however , there has been no attempt to explain quantitatively the differences in the measured @xmath6 from different surveys of similar selection criteria in terms of the finite - volume effect .",
    "this is , perhaps , in part due to the lack of an analytical estimate of the systematic bias of the standard estimators for @xmath6 .",
    "as we will show , a remarkably simple statistical fact allows just such a calculation to be done , while clarifying the origin of this bias , and relating it to other known biases in large scale structure statistics , such as the integral constraint .",
    "consider the following elementary statement : @xmath12 where @xmath13 denotes ensemble averaging , and @xmath14 and @xmath15 are two random variables or estimators .",
    "this statement holds generically , except in special cases such as when @xmath14 and @xmath16 are constants .    the standard method of estimating @xmath6 is to form estimates of @xmath8 and @xmath4 separately , and then take an appropriate ratio of the two .",
    "however , even in the ideal case where one has an unbiased estimator of the numerator ( @xmath8 ; let us call this estimator @xmath14 , i.e. @xmath17 ) and an unbiased estimator of the denominator ( @xmath18 ; let us call the estimator @xmath15 , i.e. @xmath19 ) , taking a ratio of the two estimators does not necessarily result in an unbiased estimator of @xmath6 .",
    "this is captured by the statistical statement in eq .",
    "( [ ab ] ) . we will refer to this kind of estimation - bias as the ratio - bias .",
    "more generally , nonlinear combinations of unbiased estimators should be treated with great care .",
    "for instance , suppose @xmath20 is an unbiased estimator of @xmath4 such that @xmath21 .",
    "it is virtually guaranteed that @xmath22 .",
    "we will refer to this kind of bias generally as a nonlinear - estimation - bias , of which the ratio - bias is a particularly simple and common example . in this paper",
    ", we will sometimes be abusing the terminology by using the two terms interchangeably .    the well - known integral constraint , in the case of measurements of the two - point function , can in fact be understood as a ratio bias .",
    "the two - point function @xmath23 , where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are two cells separated by some distance , is by definition @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the overdensity at cell @xmath24 .",
    "the catch is that one directly observes only @xmath28 , the number of particles / galaxies in a cell .",
    "an estimate of the mean number count @xmath29 has to be made in order to assign a value @xmath27 for each cell .",
    "this is generally taken to be @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the total number of cells , let us call this estimator @xmath32 .",
    "the problem is , of course , that @xmath33 , because of the estimator @xmath34 in the denominator . as we will see , this estimation - bias is in general negative",
    "this is what the integral constraint is about : that the measured two - point function is generally biased low because the mean number density is estimated from the same survey from which @xmath35 is being measured .",
    "this turns out to be the ratio - bias in disguise .",
    "it is also easy to see that estimates of @xmath36 would suffer from a similar bias .",
    "peebles @xcite first pointed out the integral - constraint - bias for estimating @xmath35 , but his treatment only gave the large scale estimation - bias .",
    "bernstein @xcite , building on earlier work by landy & szalay @xcite , developed a perturbative approach ( not perturbative in the usual sense of small density fluctuations , but perturbative in the small quantity : the average of the two - point function over the volume of the survey ) to compute the full integral - constraint - bias for @xmath35 , which accounted for the small - scale bias as well .",
    "( see also for a related recent discussion . ) obviously , the integral - constraint bias affects also measurements of the one - point analogue , or the volume - average , of @xmath35 i.e. the variance @xmath4 .",
    "this integral - constraint - bias generally decreases in magnitude with increasing survey size , causing measurements of the correlation length from @xmath35 or @xmath4 to increase with sample depth , an effect that has been observed before ( ) . hence , in the case of the two - point function or its volume average , the finite - volume - effect pointed out by colombi et al .",
    "@xcite is none other than the integral - constraint - bias .",
    "adopting the techniques of bernstein @xcite , we compute analytically the biases of the standard estimators for @xmath8 and @xmath6 , for @xmath37 . the methodology for a general @xmath38",
    "is presented in  [ derivation ] . for simplicity , we illustrate how to keep track of the perturbative - ordering by going into details of the calculation for @xmath39 .",
    "these cases are also of special interest because many measurements of @xmath4 , @xmath1 and @xmath0 exist in the literature .",
    "we go over the calculation of the estimation - biases for these three quantities in  [ egn3 ] . for readers not interested in the details : much of the section can be skipped ; the main results are in eq .",
    "( [ bk2pt ] ) , ( [ bk3pt ] ) & ( [ biass3noshotpt ] ) .",
    "we next check in  [ numerical ] our analytical results using n - body simulations of the scdm ( standard cold - dark - matter ) and lcdm ( lambda or low - density cold - dark - matter ) models .",
    "ensemble averages of the standard estimators for @xmath4 and @xmath0 are computed by using @xmath40 realizations for each chosen model and for various sample - volumes .",
    "the overall agreement is excellent .",
    "we also introduce a way to correct for the analytical estimates when the estimation - bias becomes so large that the perturbative approach in  [ egn3 ] breaks down .    in  [ catalogue ] , we present a first step towards a re - evaluation of existing measurements of the variance and skewness from the cfa / ssrs / apm surveys .",
    "we study simulated cfa / ssrs / apm catalogues with the appropriate sizes , which include the effects of redshift distortions as well as sparse - sampling .",
    "we then consider a preliminary correction of the existing measurements of the variance and skewness from these surveys , based on our findings in  [ egn3 ] and  [ numerical ] .",
    "the correction is necessarily model - dependent ( dependent on the power spectrum and the galaxy - biasing assumed ) , but it appears that most of the systematic differences between these surveys can be explained by the estimation - biases , under reasonable assumptions . a thorough analysis of the remaining differences would require a careful study of , among other things , projection effects and redshift distortions .",
    "we leave this for future work .",
    "finally , we conclude in  [ conclude ] with a discussion of methods for measuring @xmath6 that might be subject to a less severe estimation - bias .",
    "we list other large scale structure statistics which might also suffer from this type of a nonlinear - estimation - bias .",
    "we also discuss applications of our findings outside conventional galaxy surveys , such as the lyman - alpha forest , high - redshift lyman - break galaxy surveys and weak - lensing maps .",
    "@xmath43 is the esimator for the variance :",
    "@xmath44 imagine that the survey is divided into many very small cells , so small that the number of particles / galaxies in each cell is either 1 or 0 .",
    "the index @xmath24 above denotes such a cell , and @xmath31 is the total number of such cells .",
    "@xmath45 is an estimate of the local overdensity smoothed over some given radius @xmath3 .",
    "we will assume top - hat smoothing in this paper .",
    "in other words : @xmath46 where @xmath47 is equal to 1 if there is a galaxy and 0 otherwise , @xmath48 is an estimate of the mean density of the survey , and @xmath49 is the top - hat smoothing window .",
    "the estimator @xmath48 is @xmath50    we have not stated explicitly how to handle edge - effects .",
    "for instance , what should be done when the top - hat window @xmath51 overlaps with the boundary in eq .",
    "( [ deltahat ] ) ?",
    "note that @xmath52 only for @xmath24 sufficiently far away from edges . if one adopts the strategy that one picks only @xmath24 s in eq .",
    "( [ deltahat ] ) such that the top - hat does not overlap with the boundary , then the corresponding @xmath31 in eq .",
    "( [ k2hat ] ) should not be the total number of all infinitesimal cells in the sample , but a smaller number : the number of centers ( at the infinitesimal cells ) of top - hats whose windows do not overlap with the boundary .",
    "the @xmath25-index in eq .",
    "( [ deltahat ] ) should , on the other hand , range over the whole survey volume , up to the boundary .",
    "the standard shot - noise correction is given by @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the estimated mean number of particles within a smoothing top - hat of size @xmath3 , in other words , it is @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the volume of the top - hat .",
    "the estimator for the n - th cumulant is defined similarly : @xmath57 where the subscript @xmath58 denotes the connected part of the sum , and @xmath59 is a shot - noise correction generalizing @xmath60 .",
    "it is worthwhile at this point to introduce the continuum notation .",
    "we will replace @xmath61 by @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is the volume of the i - th cell and @xmath64 is the total volume , and @xmath49 by the continuum top - hat @xmath65 normalized so that @xmath66 for @xmath24 sufficiently far away from edges .",
    "it is also worthwhile to note that factorial moments are sometimes used to estimate @xmath8 , which represents a convenient way to eliminate the shot - noise contribution ( ) , but otherwise results in the same estimator for @xmath8 as in eq .",
    "( [ knhat ] ) .",
    "the integral - constraint - bias for @xmath43 arises from the fact that the true mean density @xmath29 is unknown , and has to estimated from the same sample from which one tries to measure the variance . to derive it ,",
    "let us first write the estimator for the mean density as @xmath67 , where @xmath48 is given in eq .",
    "( [ hatbarn ] ) , and @xmath68 is a small fluctuation from the true mean",
    ". then one can express the estimator for the overdensity @xmath45 ( eq . [ [ deltahat ] ] ) as @xmath69 where @xmath27 is now the true overdensity ( smoothed with the same top - hat as @xmath45 is ) i.e. @xmath27 is @xmath70 , appropriately smoothed .",
    "@xmath68 is by definition equal to @xmath71 substituting the above into the expression for @xmath43 ( eq . [ [ k2hat ] ] ) , one can expand in @xmath68 and write down the ensemble average of @xmath43 order by order .",
    "it can be easily shown that the zero - th order term ( no @xmath68 ) of @xmath72 gives @xmath4 , the true variance .",
    "the rest of the terms represent the integral - constraint - bias .",
    "a key question is by what order one should stop , which we will discuss in detail in  [ k2 ] .",
    "it suffices to note here that , strictly speaking , @xmath68 by itself can not be used as an ordering - parameter , because it is a random variable ( depends on the data ) which gets ensemble - averaged .",
    "let us denote the integral - constraint - bias for @xmath43 , or more generally , @xmath73 by : @xmath74 as we will see , the fractional bias @xmath75 becomes small for a large enough survey .",
    "this is the limit in which we will be working .",
    "how large is large , or how small is small , is the question we would like to address .",
    "it is easy to see that the above methodology can be adopted for computing the ensemble average of the standard estimator for the hierarchical amplitude , @xmath76 .",
    "the key idea is to assume the denominator part of the estimator fluctuates about its mean , and expand in that fluctuation . in other words , for @xmath6 ,",
    "let us first assume @xmath77 where @xmath78 is a small fluctuation of the measured @xmath43 from its mean ( which is offset from the true @xmath4 by a bias ; eq .",
    "[ [ biashatkn ] ] ) .",
    "note that @xmath78 depends on the data , and so can not be taken out of @xmath79 .",
    "putting eq .",
    "( [ biashatkn ] ) and ( [ epsilon ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ hatsn ] ) , one obtains the following expression for the mean of @xmath80 : @xmath81 note that all terms up to @xmath82 are displayed above , except for the terms : @xmath83 $ ] and @xmath84 $ ] . as we will show later on ,",
    "the terms @xmath85 , @xmath86 and @xmath87 are all of the order of a small parameter in which we will be expanding : hence the dropping of products involving them .",
    "it is instructive to divide the net bias of the estimator @xmath88 into two different contributions .",
    "one is due to the integral - constraint - bias discussed above : namely that both @xmath89 in the numerator and @xmath90 in the denominator ( see eq . [ [ hatsn ] ] ) are biased estimators .",
    "this gives the first two terms on the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ biassn2 ] ) .",
    "the other contribution arises from the fact that the estimator @xmath80 is the ratio of two other estimators ( to be accurate , it is in fact some nonlinear combinations of @xmath89 and @xmath90 ) .",
    "this is the rest of the terms in eq .",
    "( [ biassn2 ] ) .",
    "let us give these two kinds of terms explicit names : @xmath91 the integral - constraint - bias and the ratio - bias of @xmath80 respectively .",
    "we are slightly abusing the terminology here because the integral - constraint - bias is of course itself a form of a ratio - bias .",
    "as we will show below , it turns out that the terms contributing to the integral - constraint - bias partially cancel each other , leaving the ratio - bias to be the dominant contribution to the net bias of @xmath80 on large scales .",
    "note that we have implicitly assumed @xmath75 , @xmath92 and @xmath93 and @xmath94 are all small , and that terms we have ignored in eq .",
    "( [ biassn2 ] ) are somehow all of higher order . what is the correct ordering parameter in which we are expanding ?",
    "again , the quantity @xmath78 can not be used directly to keep track of the ordering , because it is data - dependent .",
    "for instance , after taking the expectation values , it could happen that terms that contain @xmath82 are actually comparable to terms linear in @xmath78 .",
    "we will see that this is indeed the case in the next section .",
    "( [ biassn ] ) implies the bias of @xmath80 depends in general on the @xmath95-point correlation functions .",
    "the strategy we adopt in this paper is to assume the following hierarchical relation : @xmath96 , which is motivated by perturbation theory but has been observed to hold in the highly nonlinear regime as well .",
    "we do not need to assume anything , however , about the configuration or scale dependence ( or independence ) of the hierarchical amplitudes .",
    "using this relation , it can be shown that ( we will demonstrate this explicitly for @xmath0 ) the terms we have kept in @xmath97 ( eq . [ [ biassn2 ] ] ) all contain terms linear in the following quantity : @xmath98 where @xmath35 is a smoothed version of the 2-point function defined as @xmath99 where @xmath100 is the top - hat smoothing window of some radius @xmath3 , and @xmath101 is the unsmoothed 2-point function .",
    "@xmath102 is the 2-point function averaged over the whole survey ( of size @xmath103 ) . for a survey to be of any use at all",
    ", this quantity has to be much smaller than 1 . because of the relatively large coefficients that will be multiplying it in @xmath104 , as will be shown below , the fractional bias in @xmath80 could be non - negligible , even for a relatively large survey volume .",
    "one should therefore view the derivation of the bias in @xmath80 in this paper as an expansion in the small parameter @xmath102 .",
    "as we will see , the same applies to @xmath73 .",
    "indeed , it can be shown that all the terms we have kept in eq .",
    "( [ biassn ] ) contain terms linear in @xmath102 , and terms we have ignored are all of higher order ( @xmath105 ^ 2 $ ] , etc ) .",
    "we will demonstrate the reasoning with an example : @xmath106 .",
    "the integral - constraint - bias for the two - point function has been known for a long time ( see e.g. ) .",
    "our treatment follows most closely that of bernstein @xcite , and the emphasis is on techniques that can be generalized to @xmath107 and @xmath108 .",
    "as we have explained before , @xmath68 can not really be used as an ordering - parameter , because it is a random variable which gets averaged over .",
    "the key to the above expansion is instead to keep only terms up to linear order in @xmath102 ( eq . [ [ k2l ] ] ) .    ignoring shot - noise for now",
    ", the first term on the right gives us the true variance @xmath4 .",
    "this is the zero - th order term .",
    "the rest of the terms represent the integral - constraint - bias for @xmath20 , and are all of order @xmath102 or higher .",
    "let us check .",
    "the next term , again ignoring shot - noise for now , gives @xmath112 . applying the hierarchical relation @xmath96 , i.e. @xmath113",
    ", we can see that the term @xmath114 , when integrated over @xmath24 and @xmath25 , will give rise to a term proportional to @xmath115 .",
    "hence , the term @xmath112 contains a linear piece and should not be thrown away .",
    "note that we need not make any assumption about the configuration or scale dependence of the hierarchical amplitudes .",
    "in other words , we should keep the term @xmath112 as is , rather than as , say @xmath116 .",
    "the hierarchical relation is used strictly for keeping track of the ordering at this stage .",
    "the integrand in the next term , 3 @xmath117 , can be broken up into several disconnected pieces : @xmath118 $ ] .",
    "it is easy to see that the second piece gives something that is second order in @xmath102 , when integrated over , and so does the @xmath119 piece , assuming again the hierarchical relation .",
    "the only piece that survives is then , after integration , @xmath120 .",
    "more generally , it can be seen that all terms , including those not explicitly displayed , in the expansion in eq .",
    "( [ bk2 ] ) are of the form @xmath122 , where @xmath123 is 1 or 2 . our arguments above show that only terms with @xmath124 , or @xmath125 , or @xmath126 and @xmath127 , contain pieces linear in @xmath102 .",
    "the reader can convince himself or herself that all other terms are of higher order .    putting everything together , ignoring shot - noise , and using the definition of the fractional bias in eq .",
    "( [ biashatkn ] ) , we obtain to linear order in @xmath102 , @xmath128 the above result is consistent with that of bernstein @xcite for the integral - constraint - bias of the two - point function .",
    "the first term on the right was obtained by peebles @xcite via a different argument .",
    "how about shot - noise ?",
    "a term like @xmath26 that shows up in eq .",
    "( [ bk2 ] ) includes both the cosmic 2-point correlation @xmath23 ( see eq . [ [ xi2r ] ] ) and a shot - noise contribution due to poisson sampling ( see e.g. ): @xmath129 it can be shown that all shot - noise contributions to @xmath130 can be expanded in either @xmath131 or @xmath132 where @xmath133 is the mean number of particles in a cell of size @xmath3 , and @xmath134 is the mean number of particles in the whole survey .",
    "for instance , the term @xmath135 has a poisson term @xmath131 , if one makes use of eq .",
    "( [ shotnoise ] ) , together with the fact that @xmath100 is a top - hat of size @xmath3 with the normalization @xmath136 .",
    "this gets canceled by part of the shot - noise correction term @xmath137 ( eq . [ [ bk2 ] ] ) . on the other hand , a term like @xmath138 gives us a poisson term of the order of @xmath139 . in general",
    ", @xmath139 is a very small quantity , and so we can ignore all terms of order @xmath132 .",
    "there are , for instance , poisson pieces linear in @xmath102 in the @xmath140 term in eq .",
    "( [ bk2 ] ) , but they are also of order @xmath132 , and so can be ignored .    how about the @xmath141 terms in eq .",
    "( [ bk2 ] ) ? without going into details ,",
    "it can be shown that the only @xmath141 contributions are : @xmath142 from the @xmath137 term , @xmath143 from the fourth term on the right , and @xmath144 from the fifth term on the right .",
    "therefore , to @xmath141 , the shot - noise terms miraculously cancel !",
    "it is interesting to note that this cancellation is possible only because the integral - constraint - bias in the shot - noise correction itself is taken into account i.e. @xmath145 ( see eq . [ [ k2shot ] ] & [ [ alpha ] ] ) .",
    "we will see in  [ numerical ] that our estimations of the biases in the variance and skewness which ignores shot - noise are in fact quite accurate . with no further justification",
    ", we will ignore shot - noise terms in the rest of our derivation , which substantially simplifies our expressions .",
    "the cancellation to @xmath141 here for @xmath130 can be taken as suggestive evidence that shot - noise is unimportant for the estimation - biases we are interested in ; we will rely on the numerical simulations in  [ numerical ] for further support .",
    "we should emphasize , however , we are not saying that there is no need to subtract out shot - noise when estimating the variance and skewness themselves .",
    "finally , how about edge - effects ?",
    "it is worth emphasizing that no assumptions about the edge - effects being small need to be made in deriving eq .",
    "( [ bk22 ] ) .",
    "one only has to be careful about volume over which the integration is done and what @xmath64 has to be . as we have mentioned earlier in  [ notation ] , one way to deal with the boundary",
    "is to use only cells that do not overlap with the edges . in that case",
    ", the dummies of integration @xmath24 and @xmath25 should range over the inner part of the survey , where any cell that is centered within it does not cut into the boundary .",
    "similarly , @xmath64 should be chosen to be the volume of that inner region .",

    "all of them vary with the amount and nature of galaxy - biasing . instead of conducting a detailed analysis covering many possible models , we ask the following simpler question : assuming different shapes for the power spectrum all normalized to @xmath297 , and assuming the pt - theory ( real - space ) values for @xmath188 and @xmath0 , what would be the corrected measurements of @xmath0 for the cfa and ssrs catalogues , using eq .",
    "( [ biass3noshotpt ] ) , or more appropriately , its extension in eq .",
    "( [ ansatz ] ) , if no galaxy - bias is assumed ?",
    "note that here , we are taking advantage of the finding in  [ simcats3 ] ( fig .",
    "[ s3cfa ] ) that the biased - measurements of @xmath0 yield very similar values in real- and redshift - space , and so we can simply apply the correction formulated in _",
    "real_-space to the measurements in _ redshift_-space . on large scales",
    ", this is a safe assumption because even the true @xmath0 s are very similar in real- and redshift - space . on small scales ,",
    "this assumption remains to be further scrutinized .",
    "obviously , this assumption must break down when the survey - size is large enough ( c.f .",
    "short- and long - dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ s3cfa ] ) .",
    "we will concentrate on the last six measurements in table [ s3s4 ] .",
    "these published values of @xmath0 ( ) are the mean values in the corresponding range of smoothing scales shown in the 4th column . here",
    "we will associate each with the mean value of @xmath3 in the respective range of scales i.e. @xmath298 & @xmath299 with @xmath300 & @xmath301 from the cfa50 , cfa80 & cfa92 catalogues on the one hand , and @xmath302 & @xmath303 from the ssrs50 , ssrs80 & ssrs115 catalogues on the other .",
    "the corrected values of @xmath0 , adopting the assumptions stated above , are shown as lines in fig .",
    "[ s3bias ] . the correction is larger for the smaller scales which correspond to sub - samples of a smaller size .",
    "the scdm predictions are much lower as it has less power on large scales .",
    "if there is no biasing , we can assume that the apm - values for @xmath4 is close to the true ones , which is is reasonable given the size of the apm ( see e.g. fig .",
    "[ s3ang ] ) . in this case",
    "we should concentrate on the continuous line in fig .",
    "[ s3bias ] . at the larger smoothing scales , namely @xmath304 & @xmath299 , the corrected values are quite consistent with the apm - values .",
    "however , at the smallest smoothing scale of @xmath305 , the corrected @xmath0 s are significantly higher than the apm - values .",
    "three points should be noted here .",
    "first , at this smoothing scale , the correction is so large that the validity of the ansatz expressed in eq .",
    "( [ ansatz ] ) might be called into question .",
    "second , the implicit assumption that the _ biased- _ measurements of @xmath0 in real- and redshift - space yield similar values should be checked using more simulations .",
    "third , it is in fact well known that the _ small - scale _ @xmath0 ( of the mass ) one would infer from an n - body simulation with an apm - like power spectrum and gaussian initial conditions is larger than the measured @xmath0 from the apm survey @xcite .",
    "one possible interpretation is a scale - dependent galaxy - bias , which tends to diminish on large scales but becomes significant on small scales .    on large scales",
    "@xmath306 , we can safely say that most of the discrepancies in existing measurements of @xmath0 from the cfa / ssrs / apm catalogues can be explained by an estimation - bias .",
    "remaining differences are attributable to a ) a small relative galaxy - bias between the different surveys on large scales ; b ) redshift - distortions ; c ) deprojection effects ( see ) and d ) sampling fluctuations .",
    "in fact , our analysis as shown in fig . [ vard ] does support the existence of a galaxy - bias between the cfa / ssrs and the apm . to be strictly consistent , we should have taken this into account in our `` correction '' of the cfa / ssrs values for @xmath0 .",
    "doing so is beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "nonetheless , it should be emphasized that the amount of galaxy - bias one would infer based on measurements of @xmath0 is reduced if the estimation - bias is taken into account .",
    "a careful assessment would require the inclusion of all the above effects , and ideally , a re - measurement of @xmath0 from the different catalogues using methods that are perhaps less prone to the ratio - bias .",
    "we hope to pursue these in a future paper .",
    "the main results of this paper are summarized in eq .",
    "( [ bk22 ] ) , ( [ bk3 ] ) & ( [ biass3noshot ] ) , with the associated useful approximations given in eq .",
    "( [ bk2pt ] ) , ( [ bk3pt ] ) & ( [ biass3noshotpt ] ) .",
    "together they tell us the estimation - biases associated with the standard estimators for the variance @xmath4 , the third cumulant @xmath1 , and the skewness @xmath0 ( eq . [ [ biashatkn ] ] & [ [ biassn ] ] ) .",
    "the calculation is based on an expansion in the small parameter @xmath102 ( eq . [ [ k2l ] ] ) , which is the variance smoothed on the scale of the survey , but otherwise does not assume or require the smallness of the variance on the scale of interest @xmath3 .",
    "> from eq .",
    "( [ bk2pt ] ) , ( [ bk3pt ] ) & ( [ biass3noshotpt ] ) , it can be seen that the standard estimators are all asymptotically unbiased , in the sense that for a given smoothing scale @xmath3 , the estimation - biases tend to zero as the survey - size increases . on the other hand , for a fixed survey - size",
    ", the estimation - biases become large as @xmath3 approaches the size of the survey .",
    "there are two types of terms in the fractional estimation - biases , one dependent on the smoothing scale @xmath3 , being proportional to @xmath182 where @xmath4 is the variance smoothed on scale @xmath3 , and the other not , being proportional to @xmath102 only .",
    "in other words , a general form for the estimation bias of an estimator @xmath185 can be represented by eq .",
    "( [ e1 ] ) where @xmath186 and @xmath187 are coefficients that depend on the various hierarchical amplitudes , such as @xmath0 and @xmath188 . for reasonable choices of the parameters @xmath0 and @xmath188 , the estimation - biases are negative ( see fig .",
    "[ a1a2 ] ) .",
    "the magnitude of the estimation - biases can be surprisingly large , especially for @xmath307 , because of the large coefficients multiplying @xmath102 or @xmath182 .",
    "our analytical predictions are borne out by numerical experiments discussed in  [ numerical ] .",
    "examples can be found in fig .",
    "[ x2c60all ] , [ s3c150all ] & [ s3c60all ] . in cases where the estimation - biases are so large that the higher order terms in our expansion in @xmath102 become important ,",
    "we show that a simple ansatz works reasonably well ( eq . [ [ ansatz ] ] ) .    in the case of @xmath0 , we distinguish between two types of contributions to its estimation - bias .",
    "the standard estimator for @xmath0 is @xmath308 .",
    "part of the bias arises from the biases of the estimators @xmath309 and @xmath278 themselves  this is the integral - constraint - bias ( eq .",
    "[ [ bs3intcrf ] ] ) .",
    "the second part arises from the particular nonlinear combination of these two estimators , which we dub to be the ratio - bias ( eq .",
    "[ [ bs3ratiof ] ] ) , or more precisely , the nonlinear - estimation - bias .",
    "it turns out the second always dominates on large scales .",
    "we present a preliminary attempt to correct some existing measurements of the variance and skewness in  [ catalogue ] .",
    "our main conclusions are a ) the apparent increase of the measured variance with survey depth observed by some authors can be nicely explained by the integral - constraint bias ( fig .",
    "[ vard ] ; see e.g. ) ; b ) our analysis indicates a small relative galaxy - bias between the cfa / ssrs and the apm galaxies , c ) the apm survey should give small estimation - biases for the standard estimator for @xmath0 on scales of interest ( see table [ s3s4 ] ) ; d ) on large scales @xmath306 , most of the differences between the measured skewness from the cfa / ssrs and the apm surveys can be attributed to the estimation - bias ; however , a more careful analysis , taking into account redshift - space distortions , relative galaxy - bias ( such as due to luminosity segregation ) and deprojection effects , is necessary to access the significance of the remaining differences , and whether they are due to pure sampling fluctuations .",
    "two areas clearly warrant further investigations .",
    "first , for the purpose of future surveys such as the sdss or the aat 2df , the @xmath4-independent terms in the estimation biases ( the terms associated with @xmath187 in eq . [ [ e1 ] ] ) will probably be unimportant , but the @xmath4-dependent terms ( the @xmath186-terms ) can always become important for a sufficiently large smoothing scale @xmath3 . increases @xmath123 becomes more negative and the coefficient @xmath187 in @xmath0 becomes smaller ( see fig .",
    "[ a1a2 ] ) . ]",
    "it would therefore be good to have an idea of what that scale is , not just for the variance and the skewness , but also for @xmath6 where @xmath5 .",
    "we will present results for a general n in a separate paper .",
    "second , we have focused in this paper exclusively on the standard estimators for @xmath8 and @xmath6 , where @xmath8 is estimated by the standard counts - in - cells technique and @xmath6 is estimated by taking the appropriate ratio of @xmath310 and @xmath20 .",
    "there are probably other estimators that suffer from smaller estimation - biases .",
    "for instance , kim & strauss @xcite recently introduced an interesting method to obtain @xmath0 by fitting the one - point probability distribution of counts ( pdf ) using an edgeworth series .",
    "they obtained values higher than previous measurements from the same surveys ( see table [ s3s4 ] ) indicating that their method is less susceptible to an estimation - bias .",
    "an extension of their method using a pdf which is better behaved in the presence of more significant nonlinearities is worth pursuing .",
    "another possibility which might reduce the ratio - bias in @xmath80 due to the division of @xmath310 by @xmath311 : instead of dividing to obtain an estimate of @xmath6 , fit a curve parametrized in some form to the two - dimensional plot of @xmath312 and @xmath313 at each smoothing scale @xmath3 .",
    "this is akin to , for instance , how the hubble constant is usually measured : instead of dividing some estimate of velocity by some estimate of distance for each data point followed by averaging , a linear @xmath314 fit to all points is performed .",
    "this method might give a smaller ratio - bias , but it has to be tested .",
    "this procedure has in fact been carried out before by e.g. gaztaaga @xcite and bouchet et al .",
    "@xcite , who obtained values of @xmath0 close to that using the standard estimator . but a different parametrization of the relation between @xmath312 and @xmath313 ( in other words , taking into account carefully the change of @xmath6 with @xmath3 ) might yield different results .",
    "perhaps the most important and obvious lesson of our investigation here is that nonlinear combinations of estimators should be used with caution . the only sure - fire way of avoiding an estimation - bias is through monte - carlo simulations , such as those performed in  [ numerical ] .",
    "there is nothing novel about this point , except that its importance has not been sufficiently emphasized in measurements of certain large scale structure statistics , such as @xmath8 and @xmath6 discussed here .",
    "there are also strong interests in measuring such quantities outside galaxy surveys , e.g. for the transmission distribution of quasar spectra and for the convergence distribution in weak - lensing maps .",
    "the skewness of the former , for instance , provides a test of the gravitational - instability picture of the lyman-@xmath68 forest ( ) , while the skewness of the latter is a sensitive probe of cosmology ( ) .",
    "measurements in these areas require similar caution as in the case of galaxy surveys .",
    "our methodology in deriving the estimation - bias for the standard estimator of skewness ( ratio of the third cumulant to the second cumulant squared ) could be adapted for such measurements ( in the case of weak lensing , we learned as this work was being completed that a related calculation was done by ) .",
    "an important ingredient of our calculation is the use of the hierarchical relation @xmath170 in keeping track of the ordering , which might have to be modified for these other applications .    also , for these applications , as well as for less conventional galaxy surveys such as the lyman - break galaxy surveys at high redshifts ( ) , one often has available several independent fields for which a simple and obvious method should help to reduce much of the ratio - bias of the skewness : measure the third moment and the second moment for each field , separately average each of them over all fields , and only then does one combine these averaged moments to estimate the skewness .",
    "a related suspect of a similar estimation - bias is the measurement of @xmath315 , defined as the ratio of the n - point correlation to the sum of suitable permutations of products of the two - point functions ( ) . the configuration dependence of @xmath316 , for instance , provides an elegant test of the galaxy - bias ( ) .",
    "common ways of estimating it , where estimators are divided by each other , are susceptible to the ratio - bias just as in the case of @xmath6 . another possibly problematic statistic is the ratio of the quadrupole to monopole power in redshift - space , or the ratio of the monopole power in redshift - space to that in real - space , which is often used to estimate the parameter @xmath317 ( see review by ) .",
    "an examination of published estimates of @xmath318 show a large scatter even from the same surveys , with maximum likelihood methods yielding consistently higher values ( ) , suggesting an estimation - bias of some sort might be lurking here .",
    "it is likely , however , that such attempts to measure @xmath318 are at least equally , if not more strongly , affected by our poor understanding of translinear distortions .",
    "we hope to pursue some of the above issues in future work .",
