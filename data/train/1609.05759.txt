    "high - tc cuprate superconductors harbor many fundamental questions , which challenge elaborate numerical analysis on superconductivity , magnetism and other properties .",
    "specifically , there is growing realization that various instabilities can exist along with superconductivity @xcite , and the relation between various charge instabilities and superconductivity in the cuprates is now being intensively studied @xcite . also , some experiments suggest a spontaneous breakdown of the four - fold symmetry of electronic states in the tetragonally structured cuprates , which is viewed as a kind of  electronic nematicity\"@xcite",
    ". there are some explanations for the nematicity , e.g. in the context of fluctuating stripe orders @xcite .",
    "pomeranchuk instability , a spontaneous breaking of four - fold symmetry of the fermi surface without lattice distortion , is evoked as another possible candidate for nematicity in cuprate superconductors @xcite .",
    "the presence of pomeranchuk instability in two - dimensional lattice models has been suggested in refs .  , where the forward scattering was found to develop to induce pomeranchuk instability .",
    "subsequently , properties of this instability were studied primarily in mean - field models (  f - model \" ) , where the electrons interact only via forward scattering @xcite . for the two - dimensional ( 2d ) hubbard model on the square lattice , a representative model for cuprates ,",
    "the existence of this instability is yet to be fully clarified microscopically .",
    "functional renormalization group ( frg ) calculations suggest that the superconducting fluctuation is stronger than pomeranchuk instability @xcite , while other numerical renormalization - group approaches suggest pomeranchuk instability to be stronger around van hove fillings@xcite .",
    "gutzwiller wave functions combined with an efficient diagrammatic expansion technique ( de - gwf ) obtained a ground state with a coexistence of the nematic order and superconductivity in 2d hubbard model@xcite .",
    "also , the dynamical cluster approximation ( dca ) and cellular dynamical - mean - field theory ( cdmft ) showed large responses against small distortions of the lattice@xcite , from which the possibility of spontaneous symmetry breaking is suggested to occur at lower temperatures or for larger cluster sizes . while these results suggest that the 2d repulsive hubbard model has a strong tendency toward the pomeranchuk instability , whether or not this instability has higher transition temperature ( @xmath2 ) than that of superconductivity ( @xmath3 ) has to be elaborated .",
    "more importantly , the relation between the pomeranchuk instability and superconductivity ( e.g. , whether they are cooperative or competing ) is an intriguing question .",
    "while the mean - field study for the phenomenological model suggests that they are competing with each other with @xmath3 suppressed in the coexistence region @xcite , the relation should be clarified by going beyond mean - field approaches .",
    "given the situation , we study in the present paper superconductivity and pomeranchuk instability in the intermediate correlation regime by evoking flex+dmft@xcite , a diagrammatic extension of the dynamical mean field theory ( dmft ) , which takes into account the spin and charge fluctuation effects on top of the dmft local self - energy and can reproduce the dome structure in @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "the advantages of this method are first , there is no finite - size effect in contrast to dca and cdmft , which should be important for capturing small fermi surface deformations , and second , we can calculate finite - temperature regions in contrast de - gwf to capture the effect of this nematicity on the superconducting @xmath3 .",
    "this also enables us to systematically examine the relation between superconductivity and pomeranchuk instability when the electron band filling and the second and further neighbor hoppings ( @xmath6 ) are varied . after confirming the existence of pomeranchuk instability near the van hove filling consistently with the previous works",
    ", we shall study the superconducting phase , which indicates that the symmetry of the gap function is changed from the ordinary @xmath0-wave pairing to ( @xmath7)-wave @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the fermi surface distortion can enhance the superconductivity in the overdoped ( or strongly frustrated ) regime with larger @xmath6 .",
    "we shall explain this @xmath3 enhancement by a perturbation picture for small fermi surface distortions , and also by the random phase approximation ( rpa ) in the weak - coupling regime .",
    "we also reveal that the pomeranchuk instability temperature @xmath2 is more sensitive to @xmath8 , hence the fermi surface warping , than the superconducting @xmath3 .",
    "this contrasts with the previous mean - field calculations @xcite that showed almost the same filling dependence for the two transition temperatures .",
    "this should come from the fact that the present formalism takes account of the filling dependence of the pairing interaction beyond mean - field levels .",
    "the result also implies that the region for stronger superconducting fluctuations and that for stronger pomeranchuk instability can be separated .",
    "we consider the standard repulsive hubbard model on the square lattice with a hamiltonian , @xmath9 where @xmath10 creates an electron with wave - vector @xmath11 and spin @xmath12 , @xmath13 is the on - site coulomb interaction , and @xmath14 . in the presence of",
    "second - neighbor ( @xmath15 ) and third - neighbor ( @xmath16 ) hopping parameters , the 2d band dispersion is given as @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the nearest - neighbor hopping ( the unit of energy hereafter ) , and @xmath19 the chemical potential .",
    "we basically adopt @xmath20 , @xmath21 , which are determined to fit the band calculation for a typical hole - doped single - layer cuprate , hgba@xmath22cuo@xmath23 @xcite . for the numerical procedure ,",
    "we employ flex+dmft method , which is a kind of diagrammatic extension of dmft , where the fluctuation exchange approximation ( flex ) and the dmft are combined , with a double self - consistency loop .",
    "this kind of scheme has been considered in ref . , and has recently been formulated through luttinger - ward functional with applications to superconducting states in ref .. the latter can describe a @xmath3 dome against the band filling along with a spectral weight transfer .",
    "these are a virtue of flex+dmft that corrects the overestimated local - flex self - energy in a filling - dependent manner . in flex+dmft ,",

    "we introduce a seed to deform the fermi surface in the initial input for green s function .",
    "while we linearize the anomalous part of green s function as being infinitesimal , we can deal with finite pomeranchuk order parameters , so that we can discuss superconductivity for finite distortions in this formalism .",

    "[ fig : eta_u4](a),(b ) , respectively .",
    "we can see that the order parameter starts to grow continuously with decreasing temperature , which indicates a second - order phase transition .",
    "if we turn to the filling dependence , we observe the order parameter abruptly growing around the edges of the pomeranchuk phase , indicative of transferring to the first - order phase transition consistently with the previous work @xcite .",
    "hereafter , we focus on the filling region around the peak of @xmath2 , where the transition is second order .",
    "the peak sits at about @xmath54 for the value of the parameter considered ( @xmath55 ) .    if we look at the fermi surface in fig .",
    "[ fig : eta_u4](c ) for @xmath56 , we can see that the fermi surface , identified as the ridges in the spectral function @xmath57 , indeed becomes distorted at lower temperatures , @xmath58 .    the phase diagram is displayed in fig .  [",

    "[ fig : phase_eta_u4](b ) , for which we have obtained the spectral function with the pad approximation , and confirmed the peak position does not change for @xmath59 .",
    "the fact that the pomeranchuk instability tends to be strong around this filling is consistent with the previous results @xcite .",
    "the peak in the pomeranchuk dome does not precisely coincide with the van hove filling , which may be an effect of the asymmetric density of states @xcite as in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase_eta_u4](b ) .",

    "thus the present result indicates that the filling dependence of the effective interaction has an important effect of rendering distinction of optimal doping levels between pomeranchuk @xmath2 dome and superconducting @xmath3 dome . to confirm this difference ,",
    "let us systematically vary the second- and third - neighbor hopping parameters @xmath64 in fig .",
    "[ fig : tp - dependence ] , which change the fermi surface warping as well as the van hove filling .",

    "[ fig : tp - dependence ] plots the phase diagrams for three typical cases with different fermi surface warping .",
    "we find that the pomeranchuk @xmath2 drastically changes along with the van hove filling ( yellow allows ) , while the superconducting @xmath3 is much less sensitive .",
    "we can thus conclude that , despite both of superconductivity and pomeranchuk instabilities being fermi surface instabilities affected by the spectral weight at the fermi energy , the pomeranchuk instability is much more sensitive to the fermi surface shape ( distance from the van hove filling ) .",
    "this implies that we can separate the dominant regions for the two instabilities by changing the position against the van hove filling ( dominated by @xmath67 ) .",
    "now , an intriguing issue is how superconductivity behaves in the presence of the pomeranchuk fermi surface distortion .",
    "we actually plot in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase_compare](a ) the superconducting order parameter , where the pairing symmetry is seen to be distorted from the ordinary @xmath0-wave to @xmath68(extended)@xmath69-wave . here",
    ", an interesting observation is that the superconducting @xmath3 can be enhanced by the pomeranchuk distortion of the fermi surface .",
    "indeed , if we go back to fig .",
    "[ fig : phase_eta_u4 ] , we have also plotted the superconducting @xmath3 when the four - fold fermi surface is artificially imposed below pomeranchuk @xmath2(green dots ) .",
    "we can see the @xmath3 with the distorted fermi surface ( purple dots ) is higher .    to identify the origin of this enhancement",
    ", we can go back to the pairing interaction to compare between the cases of pomeranchuk - distorted and the four - fold - imposed fermi surfaces .",
    "figure  [ fig : phase_compare](b ) plots the difference of the two cases for the same parameters ( @xmath55 , @xmath54 and @xmath70 ) .",
    "we can see that the pomeranchuk instability distorts the pairing interaction , with a @xmath0-wave - like sign reversal .",
    "with @xmath45 ( left panel ) , which can be decomposed into a @xmath0-wave part and an ( extended ) @xmath69-wave ( four - fold symmetric ) part ( right ) .",
    "( b ) difference in the pairing interaction with the fermi surface distortion ( @xmath71 ) and without ( @xmath72 ) , for @xmath73 .",
    "]    to pin - point the origin of the distortion effect on the superconducting @xmath3 , we can consider the perturbational effect for small distortions , based on a general linearized gap equation , @xmath74 where @xmath75 , while @xmath76 is the kernel , given as @xmath77 in flex+dmft ( as seen by multiplying @xmath78 to both sides in eq .",
    "( [ eliashberg ] ) ) . if we consider small @xmath0-wave - like distortions [ as displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase_compare](b ) ] for this kernel , @xmath79 the first - order perturbation for the maximum eigenvalue @xmath80 satisfies @xmath81 where the @xmath82 is the eigenvector for the @xmath80 , and @xmath83 identically vanishes due to the @xmath0-wave nature of the @xmath84 , so that the leading term is the second - order one , @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the index for the eigenvalue @xmath87 and eigenvector @xmath88 of the kernel matrix @xmath89 .",
    "since this expression is positive - definite , small @xmath0-wave deformations of the kernel in the linearized gap equation always enhance the superconducting @xmath3 .",
    "this explains the @xmath3 enhancement in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase_eta_u4](a ) , and can provide a new pathway for enhancing superconducting @xmath3 in terms of fermi surface distortion .",
    "however , it should be difficult to achieve purely @xmath0-wave like distortions for the kernel , and the terms having some other symmetries should in general arise even from purely @xmath0-wave distortions of the fermi surface .",
    "we can elaborate this by introducing a parameter @xmath90 where @xmath90 represents either ( 1 ) spontaneous distortion of the electronic states @xmath91 or ( 2 ) small @xmath0-wave modulation of the hamiltonian @xmath92 .",
    "then we can expand the interaction kernel in @xmath90 , which gives , up to the second - order , @xmath93 and the effect on the eigenvalue @xmath41 reads @xmath94 we can see that whether @xmath3 can be enhanced depends on the second term on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ second - order ] ) . from this",
    "we expect that the enhancement tends to occur when the second - largest eigenvalue is close to the largest one , for which the first term on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ second - order ] ) becomes dominant .",
    "calculated within rpa between the four - fold symmetric fermi surface @xmath95 and the distorted fermi surface @xmath96 with red ( black ) dots representing the case of @xmath97 ( @xmath98 ) for @xmath99 .",
    "the horizontal axis corresponds to the band filling from @xmath100 to @xmath101 , while the vertical axis is @xmath102 , with @xmath103 ( which includes the parameter set used in the fig .",
    "[ fig : tp - dependence ] ) . ]",
    "we can in fact check this argument in the weak - coupling case . to obtain qualitative tendencies ,",
    "we have performed the rpa calculation in relatively high temperature for various values of parameters to compare the four - fold symmetric case with the distorted fermi surface by making the nearest - neighbor hopping anisotropic , @xmath104 , by hand with the first line in eq .",
    "( [ dispersion ] ) becoming @xmath105 . in the rpa , we ignore the self - energy effect in the eliashberg eq .",
    "( [ eliashberg ] ) .    when we compare the eigenvalue under a distortion @xmath106 with @xmath107 for the symmetric case , the result in fig .",
    "[ fig : compare_weak - nematic ] for @xmath108 shows that we do have a region ( marked with red circles for @xmath109 ) in which the distortion enhances the eigenvalue .",
    "this effect tends to occur away from half - filling , and for larger values of distant - neighbor hopping @xmath110 ( i.e. , more frustrated cases ) .",
    "thus we can confirm that the enhancement of the superconductivity by small distortions indeed occurs in the weak - coupling limit where we can ignore the self - energy effect .",
    "it has been known that the gap symmetry ( for the leading eigenvalue ) tends to be changed for higher doping or more frustrated cases@xcite .",
    "the present result suggests that the @xmath3 enhancement arising from the distortion tends to occur around the boundary for the gap symmetry to change where the leading and sub - leading eigenvalues are close to each other .",
    "this is also consistent with the above result for the @xmath15 dependence in flex+dmft ( fig .",
    "[ fig : tp - dependence ] ) , where the enhancement of @xmath3 occurs for @xmath111 .",
    "we also notice that the structure of eq .",
    "( [ second - order ] ) is reminiscent of the pseudo jahn - teller effect , in which a jahn - teller - like distortion occurs without degeneracies due to the second - order effect of the distortion @xcite . in this context",
    "we can also recall a well - known property that , if the eigenvalues are degenerate ( e.g. for @xmath112-pairing ) , @xmath3 can be enhanced by the strain effect @xcite . from these",
    ", the present result may also be viewed as a possibility for this kind of @xmath3 enhancement revealed even for the ( non - degenerate ) @xmath0-wave regime in 2d square lattice hubbard model .",
    "we have employed flex+dmft approach to study the interplay of pomeranchuk instability and superconductivity in correlated electron systems .",
    "we have revealed that the superconductivity with the distorted fermi surface has the symmetry of the gap function changed from @xmath0-wave to @xmath7 , consistent with the previous studies @xcite .",
    "we have found that the fermi surface distortion can enhance the superconducting @xmath3 in the overdoped regime .",
    "we have explained this enhancement in terms of the perturbation for small distortions , and also with rpa in the weak - coupling regime .",
    "the pomeranchuk @xmath2 is found to be much more sensitive to fermi surface warping and the position of the van hove filling than the superconducting transition temperature .    if we comment on the method , flex+dmft , which is an improvement over flex or dmft , still overestimates the non - local self - energy effect . for more accurate estimates , other methods ( e.g. diagrammatic expansion in two - particle level as in d@xmath113a @xcite or dual fermion method @xcite )",
    "will be needed .",
    "also , we have assumed here translationally invariant systems , while the study of the interplay between superconductivity and charge instabilities involving finite wave vectors will be another interesting future work .",

    "accoding to the formulation in ref . , we should consider the local anomalous self - energy @xmath115 coming from the dmft functional .",

    "while this term can be ignored for studying pure @xmath0-wave pairing as in the previous paper @xcite , we can examine its effect on the @xmath7 pairing .",
    "we consider this effect to be small , because the additional term is an extended @xmath69-wave ( nonlocal ) pairing rather than the ordinary @xmath69-wave , so that a cancellation should occur in the momentum summation . to check this along the argument in the main text",

    "( [ eliashberg ] ) , we extract the part of the gap function that is not affected by @xmath114 as @xmath119 then a quantity , @xmath120 gives the lower bound for the maximal eigenvalue when @xmath114 is considered .",
    "we have actually confirmed that the difference between @xmath121 and @xmath41 ( without @xmath114 ) is very small , @xmath122 .",

    "<S> we show that the four - fold symmetric fermi surface becomes unstable against a spontaneous distortion into two - fold near the van hove filling , where the symmetry of superconductivity coexisting with the pomeranchuk distorted fermi surface is modified from the @xmath0-wave pairing to @xmath1-wave . by systematically shifting the position of van hove filling with varied second- and third - neighbor hoppings , we find that the transition temperature @xmath2 of pomeranchuk instability is more sensitively affected by the position of van hove filling than the superconducting @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that the filling region for strong pomeranchuk instability and that for strong superconducting fluctuations can be separated , and pomeranchuk instability can appear even if the peak of @xmath4 is lower than the peak of @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> an interesting observation is that the fermi surface distortion can enhance the superconducting @xmath3 in the overdoped regime , which is explained with a perturbation picture for small distortions . </S>"
