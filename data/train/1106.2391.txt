    "for long time compton scattering has been widely employed as an imaging tool .",
    "a photon in the energy range 0.1@xmath02.0  mev during its passage through matter , will dominantly compton scatter against the electrons of the material with an intensity proportional to electron ( and mass ) density .",
    "if the energy of the incident and scattered photons are known , it is possible to locate the scatter volume using the well known energy ",
    "angle relationship .",
    "photon scattering can therefore readily provide 3d density maps of extended objects of unknown composition .",
    "this is a clear advantage of scattering compared to other photon imaging techniques , like the well established x  ray applications , which make use of photons transmitted through the material to be imaged . in this case",
    "the integrated density of the object along the path traversed by the photon beam is provided .",
    "several profiles from different directions need to be collected and complex algorithms are required in order to reconstruct the 3d density distribution . + in the last fifty years compton scattering has found a broad range of applications in medicine , as imaging tool @xcite@xcite or to measure the human tissue density @xcite .",
    "compton scattering is also widely used in the field of non destructive testing ( ndt ) for quality control to detect defects like cracks , inclusions and voids inside industrial manufactures @xcite@xcite .",
    "the possibility of using backscattered radiation has made compton scattering very attractive also in those situations where the access to the object to be examinated is restricted to one side , like inspection of airframes @xcite and soil density determination @xcite . + more recently attention has been focused on reconstructing the photon arrival direction ( for instance from implanted nuclides ) exploiting compton scattering in a position sensitive detector @xcite@xcite : this method allows a conical region of possible photon origin to be defined , and with several measurements the true origin can be inferred by intersection of different cones . + in spite of its attractive features , photon scattering has not become the dominant approach in the imaging field @xcite .",
    "there are two major limitations of this technique : the background induced by events multiply scattered inside the object and the attenuation of both incident and scattered photons .",
    "many attempts to overcome these limitations have been pursued .",
    "we recall the use of the information of the transmitted beam to determine the attenuation coefficient , or the use of collimators to define a small region of interest in the examinated object in order to reduce the multiple scatter component .",
    "also the monte carlo approach has proven to be able to provide corrections for this source of background @xcite .",
    "+ in this paper we want to further explore the potential of the novel method to image the electron density in the human body proposed in  @xcite by means of a detailed monte carlo ( mc ) simulation using geant4  @xcite with a realistic set  up .",
    "the application presented here refers to brain imaging but the results can be applied as well to situations where a lighter object , with localized variations of density , is embedded in a denser container .",

    "in the compton effect a photon of energy @xmath1 interacts with an atomic electron and it is scattered , with a lower energy @xmath2 , at an angle @xmath3 with respect to the incoming direction . in case of scattering by free electrons at rest the conservation of energy and momentum implies the well  known compton formula which relates initial and final photon energies to the scattering angle : @xmath4 where @xmath5 kev is the electron mass ( natural units with speed of light @xmath6 are used ) .",

    "[ eq : compton ] and [ eq : klein ] are however only approximations . in reality electrons",
    "are not free and transitions of bound electrons are allowed only if the energy transfer is larger than the ionization energy .",
    "moreover electrons are not at rest but move with a certain momentum distribution .",
    "this produces the so called  doppler broadening ",
    "i.e. a smearing with a long , non gaussian tail , of the scattering angle . both the binding effects and the doppler broadening are however significant at photon energies less than 100 kev , well below energies used in the present study .",
    "the proposed technique @xcite makes use of a well collimated and monochromatic gamma - emitting source which illuminates the part of the body / object to be imaged .",
    "an x - y - z orthogonal coordinate system is introduced such that the @xmath12 axis is along the beam direction .",

[ eq : compton ] the angle @xmath3 is calculated and the scattering position @xmath12 is reconstructed by the formula : @xmath15 the @xmath12 distribution so obtained provides , directly and without any inversion algorithm , the density distribution of the material crossed by the beam i.e. a small cylinder with transverse dimensions given by the beam size and length given by the object length .",
    "a full imaging is obtained by raster scanning the surface of the object .",
    "typical scattering applications make use of collimators in front of the detector to precisely define the scatter volume ( voxel ) , given by the intersection of the incident and detected photon .",

    "+ photons were tracked through the described set - up .",
    "step by step the type of interaction , its position and the volumes crossed were recorded together with the energy deposited in the head volumes for dose calculations .",
    "hits produced in the hpge detectors were also recorded .",
    "the energy resolution of the sensors was taken to be gaussian and was simulated taking the standard 2.96 ev energy to produce an electron - hole pair , a fano factor of 0.05 and a constant electronics noise of 500 ev ( see for example @xcite , for an analysis on energy and angular resolution for cdznte detectors see @xcite ) .",
    "hits within a distance of less than 3  mm were grouped together to reconstruct a cluster .",
    "the sum of hits energies , after the smearing to account for the detector resolution , was taken to be the cluster energy .",

    "finally the distances in @xmath39 and @xmath40 between the beam and the detector position divided by @xmath41 are less than 1  mm , both having an average value of about 0.6  mm .",
    "+ the error induced by the beam divergence @xmath42 and width @xmath43 turns out to be : @xmath44 where the first term is the dominant one .",

    "+ the @xmath12 resolution improves as @xmath41 decreases , i.e. the detector must be as close as possible to the object to be imaged .",
    "the @xmath12 resolution also improves if the gamma energy increases , both because the energy resolution improves and because the doppler broadening contribution decreases .",
    "as it will be shown later , the number of scattered and detected photons decreases as @xmath1 increases and also the background changes .",
    "the best gamma energy is thus a compromise among different aspects .",
    "for the analysis we select events which have only one reconstructed cluster in the hpge detector and an energy compatible with that of compton scattering . we classify events in four types according to the following scheme : + _ s1 _ : the primary @xmath23 underwent a single compton scattering inside the head volume and then deposited all its energy producing one cluster inside the hpge .",
    "+ _ sn _ : in this case the @xmath23 has undergone multiple compton interactions inside the head volume before releasing all its energy in the hpge .",
    "+ _ escapers _ : the primary photon after one or more interactions in the head volume gives a signal in the germanium detectors but not all of its energy is released .",
    "the @xmath23 or one of its daughter particles escape without being detected .",
    "+ _ nogamma _ : for these events the signal in the hpge was not directly produced by the primary photon .",
    "+ from the above description it is clear that only events of type s1 are those which carry the correct relation between energy and angle     hatching sn , 145@xmath47 hatching escaper and heavy shaded nogamma type .",

    "the two vertical lines represent the energy range used for the event selection .",
    "each plot was obtained by simulating @xmath22 events.__,width=506 ]    and can be used to determine the @xmath12 position of the scattering , the other events constitute the background to our signal .",
    "figure  [ fig : hpge_energy ] shows the energy distribution recorded by the hpge detectors for three different beam energies .",
    "the various histograms correspond to the event type described above and the lines indicates the energy range used for the event selection .",
    "the lower limit represents the minimal energy required for a compton scattering ( i.e. @xmath48 ) and the upper one is the energy where the s1 component becomes less than the sn one . in the plot relative to the 300 kev beam energy is visible , at the same energy of the beam , the peak of the coherently scattered events ( rayleigh peak ) .",
    "+ the peak is not visible at higher energies since the cross - section for this process decrease rapidly ( @xmath49 ) at growing @xmath23 energies .",
    "the peak visible at the escape line of the lead at 75 kev and 85 kev in the distributions of nogamma events indicate that these events are mostly due to electrons emitted by photoelectric effect in the beam stopper and backscattered onto the hpge .",

    "targets with smaller density will produce dips in the @xmath12 distribution .",
    "the negative number of events in the plot refers to the area of the reversed peak.__,width=264 ]      so far we have described the capability of the proposed device to detect localized changes in the density of an extended object .",
    "the density variations produce bumps ( or dips ) in the distribution of the reconstructed z position . to produce an image of the interior of the object , however , corrections for the background induced by multiply scattered events and escapers , as well as for beam attenuation need to be implemented .",
    "first we consider the background .",
    "the component induced by multiply scattered events affects the whole z range in an almost flat way ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : attencorr]-a ) while the escaper component grows with beam energy and affects the forward z region .",
    "the background is inherently connected to geometrical aspects ( and to the detection capabilities of the hpge for the escaper component ) and does not depend on the density distribution of the object to be imaged .",
    "we tested this feature by comparing the z distributions of multiply scattered events and escapers of the various simulations done with different size and density of the targets and with targets removed .",
    "we also added , inside the brain volume , other volumes of different sizes and densities in order to simulate non uniformities in the density distribution .",
    "finally we replaced all the head materials with water .",
    "all these density variations modify the scale of the background distribution but not the shape .",
    "this indicates that the mc approach can be effective in removing the unwanted background component also in a  real world ",
    "application of this device .",
    "we notice also that , alternatively , the background component induced by the escaper events could be eliminated by surrounding the hpge detectors with some highly sensitive scintillator , like the nai type , operated as a veto . + in our analysis we used the tail of the @xmath12 distribution in the range 150@xmath0300  mm to normalize the @xmath12 distribution of  data  , i.e. our reference sample , to  mc  , the simulation without targets .",
    "we chose this region because it receives contributions only from background ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : attencorr]-a ) . with proper normalization",
    "we can subtract the background component and compare the obtained distribution to the original s1 event distribution in fig .",
    "[ fig : attencorr]-b .",
    "+ to provide an indication of how a correction for the beam attenuation could be implemented ( a full treatment of this subject is beyond the scope of this work ) we consider the passage of our pencil beam through the object : on its path it will impinge on a small cylinder of material with length equal to length of the object .",
    "we subdivide this cylinder in n equal voxels of thickness dz ; if @xmath50 is the number of photons entering the @xmath51-th voxel the number of photons reaching the next voxel along z will be : @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the attenuation coefficient which , given the photon energy , is dominated by compton scattering . in the above relation it is also assumed that the voxel thickness is small enough to allow the replacement of the exponential by its linear expansion .",
    "the signal induced by singly scattered events in the @xmath54th voxel will be : @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the detection efficiency .",
    "it accounts for the probability that the scattered photon will not undergo to any other interaction on its way out of the head volume and that it will produce a signal in the hpge detector .",
    "we assume that this efficency is the same for all the voxels , i.e. that does not depend on @xmath12 . to correct the @xmath51-th signal for beam attenuation the number of @xmath23 scattered in all the preceding voxels must be iteratively added . with some algebra",
    "we obtain : @xmath57 where the index @xmath58 runs from the first voxel to the @xmath59th one and @xmath60 is the number of event impinging on the first voxel .",
    "given the simmetry of the set - up the first and the last voxel should give the same signal since they are made by the same material .",
    "this constraint can be used to determine the value @xmath61 in the above formula .",
    "+ the @xmath12 distribution , corrected for background and for attenuation is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : attencorr]-c . in spite of the simplicity of the outlined approach we see a reasonable flatness of the regions corresponding to the homogeneous brain tissue in which targets are embedded . at large @xmath12 however an overcorrection appears .",
    "this is probably due to a residual @xmath12 dependence of the detection efficiency related to the geometrical acceptance of the detector .",
    "also the ratio of the corrected ( for attenuation and resolution effects ) signal peaks to baseline , which should equal the ratio of the target to brain density , is reproduced in an acceptable way .",
    "a value of about 1.15 was obtained for the first three targets , to be compared to the true one of 1.30 .",
    "we also provide an estimate of the image contrast which could be obtained by this device .",
    "we define the contrast c as : @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the mean of the four maxima of the signal from the inserts and @xmath64 is the average of the regions between the inclusions , which correspond to the uniform soft tissue .",
    "a value of 12% is obtained for a beam energy of 600 kev .",
    "a deconvolution was performed to cross - check the results on the expected resolution obtained , see table  [ tab : sigmavsegamma ] , with data not corrected for attenuation and background .",
    "the fit function was a rectangular pulse convoluted with a gaussian , the true position and thickness of the four inserts were used as input to the fit , the background was modeled with a linear polynomial .",
    "the resolution @xmath65 for the four inserts , extracted from the corrected data , agree with those reported in table  [ tab : sigmavsegamma ] .",
