    "one of the characteristic complex behaviors exhibited by granular materials is compaction @xcite .",
    "it can be roughly defined as the density relaxation of a loosely packed system of many grains under mechanical tapping or vibration .",
    "granular compaction is important to many industrial applications related with the production and manipulation of a wide variety of systems composed by many macroscopic particles or grains @xcite . in the last few years",
    ", a series of experiments have been carried out trying to identify the physical principles underlying granular compaction @xcite .",
    "starting from a loosely packed initial configuration , systems of monodisperse glass beads were tapped vertically .",
    "the waiting time between successive taps was large enough to allow the system to relax , so that the beads were at rest before the next tap started .",
    "the time evolution of the density towards a steady state has been analyzed , and it has been shown that it can be accurately described by an inverse logarithmic law with four adjustable parameters , whose values depend only on the tapping strength measured by the peak acceleration of a tap . the logarithmic relaxation has been found in many different models @xcite suggesting that such a behavior is quite general @xcite .",
    "although several mechanisms have been proposed to explain the behavior observed in the experiments , a fully satisfactory theory is still lacking .",
    "here we consider a one - dimensional model simple enough as to allow some detailed calculations .",
    "one of our aims was to try to identify the relevant time scale over which the relaxation ( compaction ) of the system takes place .",
    "this is the first step in the search of general laws governing the physics of densification .",
    "a main difficulty in studying compaction is that there are two different series of elementary processes involved in the experiment .",
    "the system is submitted to taps or pulses separated by time intervals for which the system is allowed to relax freely .",
    "the initial state for each tap is the final state from the previous relaxation .",
    "both processes , tapping and free evolution , must be considered in detail , and they are rather different from a physical point of view .",
    "for instance , while the duration of the pulse is clearly a relevant parameter of the problem , the free relaxation is assumed to last by definition until the system gets trapped and it is at rest .",
    "quite interestingly , the experiments have shown that it is useful to measure time by the number of pulses applied to the system .",
    "another central question is how much settling will occur for a given vibration intensity , and also if the stationary value of the density depends on the initial configuration . how these facts appear in our model and which is the role played by the duration and amplitude of the pulses are points we will address here .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in the next section",
    "the model will be presented .",
    "it consists of a lattice whose sites can be occupied by particles .",
    "the dynamics is formulated by means of a master equation and it is facilitated , in the sense that the rates of adsorption and desorption of a particle are proportional to the number of particles in the nearest neighbor sites .",
    "the model can be exactly solved in the no desorption limit , which corresponds to the very low temperature limit .",
    "the solution is obtained in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] and describes the evolution of the system without external perturbation .",
    "therefore , it will be used to study the relaxation of the system towards a metastable state between pulses . in spite of the simplicity of the system , the general solution for arbitrary strength of the external energy source",
    "is rather complicated .",
    "we have considered the limit of short duration of the taps , not only because of mathematical convenience , but also because it seems to be the limit in which the time scales involved in the problem become well separated .    the sequence of taps and free relaxation processes , i.  e.  compaction is the subject of sec .",
    "[ sec4 ] . an expression for the density after the @xmath0 tap in terms of the density and the probability distribution of two holes separated by a site after the previous tap is derived .",
    "although this relation does not provide an explicit expression for the evolution of the density , it allows to identify the relevant time scale , which turns out to be proportional to the duration of a tap times a parameter measuring their strength .",
    "curves describing the density evolution of systems starting from the same initial state but corresponding to different values of the parameters are shown to be the same when plotted as functions of the scaled time .",
    "besides , the single scaled curve is very well fitted by the inverse logarithmic law known from real experiments .    in the limit of many taps ,",
    "the density reaches a steady value that is discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec5 ] . by using a pair approximation",
    "it is found that the steady density is proportional to the time relevant parameter mentioned above .",
    "this prediction agrees well with the numerical results from the simulations . to the best of our knowledge",
    "this is the first time an explicit expression for the asymptotic density limit in a discrete tapping process has been analytically derived from a model for compaction .",
    "finally , the last section contains some final remarks and comments .",
    "we consider a one - dimensional lattice with @xmath1 sites .",
    "each site can be either occupied by a particle or empty .",
    "a configuration of the system is specified , for instance , by giving an ordered sequence of n particles and holes .",
    "let us introduce a set of variables @xmath2 , such that @xmath3 vanishes if there is a particle at site @xmath4 , while it takes the value @xmath5 if there is a hole , i.  e.  the site @xmath4 is empty .",
    "the dynamics of the system is defined as a markov process and formulated by means of the master equation for the conditional probability @xmath6 of finding the system in the configuration @xmath7 at time @xmath8 , given it was in the configuration @xmath9 at time @xmath10 @xcite , @xmath11,\\ ] ] where @xmath12 with @xmath13 , i.  e. @xmath14 is the configuration obtained from @xmath7 by changing the state of hole or particle of site @xmath4 .",
    "the above equation is to be solved with the initial condition @xmath15 the one  time distribution @xmath16 also obeys eq .",
    "( [ 2.1 ] ) , although now the initial condition must be given in each specific situation .",
    "the possible elementary processes occurring in the system are the adsorption of a particle on an empty site from a surrounding bulk and the desorption of a particle from the lattice to the bulk .",
    "the probability that an adsorption attempt be made on site @xmath4 in the infinitesimal time interval between @xmath8 and @xmath17 is @xmath18 .",
    "of course , a particle can be adsorbed only if the site is empty . in the same way ,",
    "the probability per unit of time that a given particle try to leave the lattice is @xmath19 .",
    "both processes are restricted in the following way .",
    "a particle can be adsorbed on or desorbed from a site only if at least one of its nearest neighbor sites is empty .",
    "more precisely , the probability rate for the events is proportional to the number of nearest neighbor holes .",
    "this condition tries to model naively the short - ranged geometrical constraints that make structural rearrangements difficult in a granular material .",
    "therefore , we assume that the transition rates are given by @xmath20 with @xmath21 . a similar kind",
    "of facilitated dynamics has been used previously in the context of ising models @xcite .",
    "although we restrict ourselves here to the one - dimensional case , the model can be formulated for arbitrary dimension .",
    "let us introduce new constant parameters @xmath22 and @xmath23 by @xmath24 the constant @xmath22 has the dimensions of a frequency and @xmath23 is a dimensionless parameter defined in the interval @xmath25 . for @xmath26 no particle is adsorbed by the system , while for @xmath27 desorption processes do not occur . in terms of these parameters , eqs.([2.3 ] ) can be written together as @xmath28.\\ ] ] the ratio of the desorption transition rates to the adsorption ones is @xmath29 where the last equality defines the parameter @xmath30 .",
    "the stochastic process we have formulated has a steady one - time distribution of the form @xmath31 and the density of holes ( average number of holes divided by the total number of sites @xmath1 ) in the steady state is @xmath32 and , consequently , the steady density of particles is @xmath33 . as @xmath30 increases , the equilibrium density of particles decreases .    the quantity @xmath34 can be related with a temperature parameter @xmath35 by defining an energy @xmath36 for the system .",
    "a possible choice is @xmath37 where @xmath38 is a constant fixing the energy scale . if now the distribution given by eq .",
    "( [ 2.7 ] ) is identified with the equilibrium canonical distribution , it is easily obtained that @xmath39 with @xmath40 , @xmath41 being the boltzmann constant .",
    "thus the limit @xmath42 ( @xmath43 ) is equivalent to @xmath44 and the limit @xmath45 ( @xmath46 ) to @xmath47 .",
    "a purely random distribution of particles and holes corresponds formally to the equilibrium distribution for @xmath48 or @xmath49 .",
    "the transition rates given in eq .",
    "( [ 2.6 ] ) define an irreducible markov process for @xmath50 , except for the state with all the sites occupied by particles that can not evolve . in the limit @xmath51 , the probability of this state is negligible , and all the solutions of the master equation relax to the steady distribution given by eq .",
    "( [ 2.7 ] ) @xcite .",
    "the situation is different in the no desorption limit @xmath27 .",
    "the density of particles can not decrease , and all the states of the system having every hole surrounded by two particles are absorbent ; no evolution is possible from them .",
    "our one - dimensional lattice model can be regarded as a very simple picture of an horizontal section of a real granular system , near the bottom of the container .",
    "consider first the freely evolving case . in a real granular medium ,",
    "particles can not go up due to gravity .",
    "they can only go down , as long as there is enough empty space in their surroundings .",
    "therefore , the packing fraction grows until the hard - core interaction prevents more movements of particles , and a mechanically stable configuration is found .",
    "this situation is naively resembled by the evolution of our model in the no desorption limit , @xmath27 .",
    "starting from a given configuration of particles and holes , the system evolves by means of adsorption processes , occurring on those sites having at least one nearest neighbor hole .",
    "this leads to a monotonic increase of the density until all the holes become isolated , i.  e.  surrounded by two particles .",
    "next , suppose a granular system submitted to vertical vibration . during the vibration , particles belonging to a low horizontal section can go up , making the local packing fraction decrease .",
    "the hard - core repulsion is also fundamental in the vibrated case , since particles always need enough free volume close to them in order to move . in our model , these pulses are introduced by allowing particles to be desorbed , but the dynamics is `` facilitated '' .",
    "a particle can only be adsorbed or desorbed if at least one of its nearest neighbor sites is empty .",
    "this is done to mimic the short - ranged dynamical constraints in the real granular system .",
    "of course , the relative magnitude @xmath23 of the desorption rate and the pulse duration @xmath52 are the parameters characterizing the process .    then , tapping processes have been modeled in our lattice system in the following way .",
    "we started from a purely random configuration , i.  e.  the equilibrium configuration for @xmath48 .",
    "then , the system was allowed to relax with @xmath27 until reaching a steady metastable configuration , characterized by all the holes being isolated , from which the system can not evolve any more .",
    "this is a convenient initial state for the compaction experiment and corresponds to the loosely packed conditions used in real laboratory experiments @xcite . in this way",
    "the average initial density of particles in our tapping process has been @xmath53 .",
    "pulses are modeled by suddenly increasing the value of @xmath23 to a value greater than zero .",
    "this is equivalent to increase the temperature of the system .",
    "the duration of each pulse was @xmath54 . between pulses the system relaxes with no external excitation , i.  e.  with @xmath27 .",
    "the waiting time between consecutive pulses was much larger than the relaxation time needed for the system to become trapped in a new metastable configuration .",
    "the density was measured just before starting a new pulse .",
    "the whole process was designed to mimic what is done in real experiments .",
    "in this section we will study the evolution equations that determine the relaxation of the density .",
    "first , we will derive these equations for an arbitrary value of the parameter @xmath23 characterizing the relative probability of a desorption event .",
    "secondly , we will analyze the free relaxation without desorption , i.  e.  in the limit @xmath27 , and the effect of pulses separately , taking into account that the final state for one of the processes gives the initial condition for the other .    in the following",
    "we will restrict ourselves to homogeneous and isotropic states .",
    "this requires to consider appropriate initial and boundary conditions , and it is consistent with the qualitative picture depicted in the previous section .",
    "it will be assumed that the limit @xmath55 has been taken .",
    "let us define probability distributions of groups of @xmath56 consecutive holes by @xmath57 the homogeneity of the system implies that the above expression does not depend on the starting site @xmath4 considered .",
    "evolution equations for the moments @xmath58 are easily obtained from the master equation , @xmath59 @xmath60-d_{1}(t)-d_{2}(t),\\ ] ] and @xmath61,\\ ] ] for @xmath62 .",
    "here we have introduced the probability distributions of two groups of holes separated by a site @xmath63 besides , from now on we use the dimensionless time scale defined by @xmath64 , although the asterisk is omitted for the sake of simplicity .",
    "again as a consequence of homogeneity , the functions @xmath65 do not depend on the site @xmath4 taken as the origin to measure them .",
    "moreover , isotropy implies the symmetry property @xmath66 . in eq .",
    "( [ 3.2 ] ) it is seen that the time evolution of the density of holes @xmath67 involves the nearest neighbor pair distribution of holes @xmath68 .",
    "when the equation ( [ 3.3 ] ) for this latter distribution is considered , the situation becomes more complex .",
    "not only the three consecutive hole distribution @xmath69 shows up , but also the second neighbor pair moment @xmath70 appears .",
    "on the other hand , the whole hierarchy of equations gets much simpler in the limit @xmath71 . as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] this is the no desorption limit and corresponds to @xmath72 ( very low temperatures ) . for @xmath27 , eqs .",

    "hereafter , the superindex @xmath75 indicates that a quantity is evaluated in a system evolving with @xmath27 .",
    "the hierarchy ( [ 3.6 ] ) can be easily solved by using , for instance , the generating function method @xcite .",
    "we introduce a generating function @xmath76 from eqs .",
    "( [ 3.6 ] ) it is obtained that @xmath77 obeys the equation @xmath78 whose solution is @xmath79,\\ ] ] where @xmath80 is the initial condition , that will be determined by the final situation after a pulse .",
    "this expression has been previously obtained in a different context @xcite . for large times @xmath77 approaches the limit @xmath81 and , consequently , @xmath82 @xmath83 .",
    "the last result reflects the property that for @xmath27 all the holes are isolated in the long time limit , i.  e.  they are always between two particles .",
    "therefore , the probability of finding two consecutive sites with @xmath84 is null .",
    "this is a general property that does not depend on the initial conditions .",
    "of course , the asymptotic value of @xmath85 is determined by the initial state of the system , being smaller than its initial value .",
    "it must be noticed that the hierarchy ( [ 3.6 ] ) admits as a stationary solution any constant value for @xmath86 as long as @xmath87 for @xmath88 .",
    "an interesting particular case is when the system is at equilibrium with a given value of @xmath89 before being suddenly changed to @xmath27 . in terms of the temperature introduced in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] this is equivalent to a quench of the system to @xmath90 .",
    "the initial condition for this process is now ( see eq .",
    "( [ 2.7 ] ) ) , @xmath91 then , @xmath92 and eq .",
    "( [ 3.11 ] ) yields @xmath93 for a purely random initial distribution ( @xmath48 ) it is @xmath94 , i.  e.  less than one third of the sites are empty in the final metastable state , characterized by a `` frozen '' configuration .    in the above discussion",
    "there was no need for considering the time evolution of the distributions @xmath65 defined in eq .",
    "( [ 3.5 ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , it is evident that in the limit @xmath95 , @xmath96 approaches a constant value fixed by the initial conditions of the relaxation process , while @xmath97 for @xmath98 or @xmath99 , since the last ones involve adjacent sites .",
    "next we analyze the evolution of the system with @xmath50 but for a time interval @xmath54 .",
    "this corresponds to the pulse preceding , and also following , each of the free relaxations without desorption .",
    "therefore , the initial conditions we will be interested in correspond to a final state obtained after a long time relaxation with @xmath27 , @xmath100 @xmath101 for times @xmath102 we approximate by means of a first - order taylor expansion using eqs .",
    "( [ 3.2])([3.4 ] ) , @xmath103 and similarly @xmath104 @xmath105 while distributions @xmath58 with @xmath106 are at least of order @xmath107 .",

    "( [ 3.7 ] ) . for this short time",
    "limit it is @xmath108",
    "in this section we will use the previous results to investigate the dependence of the density on the number of taps .",
    "let us consider the free relaxation with @xmath27 after the @xmath0 pulse .",
    "the initial condition for this process will be the final state reached during the pulse , i.  e.  using eq .",
    "( [ 3.21 ] ) , @xmath109 where @xmath110 and @xmath111 are the values of @xmath112 and @xmath113 at the end of the relaxation following the @xmath114-th tap , respectively .",
    "the time evolution of the system during the relaxation is described by eq .",
    "( [ 3.9 ] ) and in the long time limit by eq .",
    "( [ 3.10 ] ) , that particularized for the above initial condition yields @xmath115 and , therefore , @xmath116 the above equation is expected to hold for small @xmath117 but arbitrary `` amplitude '' of the pulses @xmath23 . since @xmath111 is by definition positive it follows that the density of holes decreases and the system compacts monotonically as a function of the number of taps @xmath114 .",
    "we stress that the density is measured at the end of each free relaxation as it is actually done in real experiments .",
    "we have checked eq .",
    "( [ 4.3 ] ) by comparing it with the results obtained from monte carlo simulation of the markov process defining the dynamics of the system .",
    "an example is given in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] where we have plotted both @xmath118 and @xmath111 as functions of the number of taps @xmath114 . here",
    "@xmath119 is the density of particles after the @xmath114-th tap .",
    "in fact , since @xmath120 is a rapidly fluctuating quantity , each of the points we have plotted corresponds to the average of those functions over @xmath121 consecutive taps .",
    "the data shown have been obtained in a system of @xmath122 sites with @xmath123 and @xmath124 , and have been averaged over @xmath125 runs .",
    "it is seen that the prediction of the theory is verified quite accurately .",
    "for the sake of clarity , we have restricted ourselves to @xmath126 taps , although the same behavior is observed until the system comes near the steady state discussed in the next section .",
    "equation ( [ 4.3 ] ) indicates that the compaction process depends on the product @xmath127 and , in that sense , @xmath127 plays in our model the same role as @xmath128 in real experiments .",
    "the latter is defined as the ratio of the peak acceleration of the tap to the gravitational acceleration @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , eq .",
    "( [ 4.3 ] ) suggests a stronger prediction , namely that the relevant time scale for the compaction process is @xmath129 . of course",
    ", this will be true only if the dependence of @xmath111 on @xmath114 also takes place through @xmath130 , but it is easily seen that it is really so .",
    "the initial condition for each pulse is a trapped configuration that is metastable for @xmath27 .",
    "that means that the derivatives with respect to time of all moments are proportional to @xmath23 at @xmath131 , and in the limit of short duration pulses the change in any moment in a pulse will be proportional to @xmath132 .",
    "this proportionality is clearly kept by the free relaxation with @xmath27 that does not introduce any new time scale in the problem .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the same results , i.  e.  eq .",
    "( [ 4.3 ] ) , hold in the limit @xmath46 , with @xmath133 .    in fig .",

    "it is not clear yet whether it is just a convenient fitting expression with four parameters or it has a more fundamental meaning , for instance associated to some peculiar dynamical events which are dominant in the relaxation of the density . in this context , it is important to realize that the law fails to describe the asymptotic behavior in the limit of a large number of taps and the steady value of the density that is eventually reached .",
    "in fact , the value of @xmath139 reported above is clearly unphysical since it is larger than 1 .",
    "we believe that this is a general limitation of the law ( [ 4.4 ] ) and it is not restricted to the present model .",

    "the evolution of the system was modelled by a series of two alternating steps . in the first one , the system evolves perturbed by an external energy source , while in the second one it freely relaxes towards a metastable configuration .",
    "the model has been shown to share many of the characteristic features of granular materials under tapping .",
    "in particular , the evolution of the density can be accurately described by means of an inverse logarithmic law with the tapping number .    in our model , compaction is due to the decrease of the number of holes as the system is being tapped .",
    "a qualitative picture of this very slow relaxation follows from the existence of `` entropic barriers '' in the system . as the number of holes lowers , the number of states allowing the system to relax become very small as compared with the total number of available states .",
    "therefore , it is very difficult for the system to find the way to these bottlenecks in configuration space , being most of the time trapped exploring metastable configurations with almost the same density .",
    "this picture supports a strong relationship between structural glassy relaxation and compaction @xcite . in both cases there",
    "is a fast increase of the relaxation time of the system , becoming very large on the time scale of the experiment .    due to the simplicity of the model we have been able to obtain some detailed analytical results .",
    "the process is characterized by the product @xmath127 , that identifies the relevant time scale for densification , at least in the limit of very short taps . over this scale the time evolution of the system",
    "is described by a universal law , which is independent of the particular values of the parameters defining the system .",
    "this prediction has been compared with the numerical solutions obtained by monte carlo simulation and a very good agreement has been found .",
    "a main result of this paper is an analytical expression for the asymptotic density obtained in a tapping process .",
    "quite surprisingly , in the limit considered there is a very simple proportionality relation between this density and both the duration of the taps and their strength , the latter being measured by the relative probability of a desorption event during a tap . also this theoretical prediction has been confirmed by the numerical solution .",
