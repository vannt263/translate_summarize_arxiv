    "coronal mass ejections ( cmes ) are the largest plasma explosions in the solar system , where a vast amount ( typically , @xmath0  g ) of the solar coronal plasma is ejected out into the interplanetary space with speeds up to 3000 km  s@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "cmes propagating in the interplanetary space are called interplanetary cmes or icmes . when the magnetic field of icme observed in - situ",
    "shows continuous rotation , it is called magnetic cloud @xcite . fast icmes drive shock waves .",
    "the draped plasma compressed and accelerated by the leading shock is called interplanetary sheath .",
    "the sudden jumps in energetic proton flux measured in - situ associated with the passage of interplanetary shocks are called energetic storm particle ( esp ) events @xcite . on the other hand , when the magnetic cloud or interplanetary sheath that arrive at earth posses southward magnetic field , they drive intense geomagnetic storms @xcite .",
    "one super - intense esp event was recently recorded on 2012 july 23 by @xmath2 spacecraft located at 0.96 au from the sun and at 121@xmath3 ahead of earth at the time .",
    "the estimated peak e@xmath4mev proton flux measured in - situ by @xmath2 was about @xmath5 pfu when the interplanetary shock passed the spacecraft @xcite .",
    "@xcite carried out comprehensive study on the icme characteristics with stereoscopic observations and in - situ measurements .",
    "the post - shock peak speed measured in - situ at @xmath2 is about 2250 km s@xmath1 .",
    "the recorded peak magnetic field strength is 109 nt , being among the largest interplanetary field strength on record near 1 au .",
    "@xcite concluded that we would have had an extreme geomagnetic storm with minimum dst index of @xmath6 or @xmath7 nt had the icme arrived at earth , based on two different empirical formula .",
    "the causative cme resulted from the merger of two successive cmes with the peak speed of about 3050 km s@xmath1 near the sun . also , a fast cme preceded the july 23 event by 4 days from the same solar active region , and the solar wind trailing the preceding cme had its density as low as 1 @xmath8 .",
    "they discussed that both the `` preconditioned '' low - density upstream solar wind and the cme merger have played a crucial role in producing very fast icme near 1au with extremely strong magnetic field .",
    "taking into account the fact that icmes faster than 1000 km s@xmath1 at 1 au are extremely rare @xcite , the icme of 2012 july 23 event had a truly outstanding propagation characteristics .",
    "what is the fundamental condition for such an extremely space weather impacting icme at 1 au remains an issue of crucial importance for space weather research .",
    "recently , superflares ( flares that are 10 - 1000 times more energetic than the largest ever observed solar flares ) on solar - type stars were discovered with kepler data @xcite .",
    "the possible impacts of superflares on space weather and terrestrial environment are also discussed vigorously @xcite .",
    "a landmark for realistic space weather prediction is to connect the coronagraph observation of a cme near the sun with an expected icme characteristics at 1 au , as well as its arrival time .",
    "as for the prediction of the arrival time of icme at 1 au , various methods have been proposed so far @xcite .",
    "one of the most typical models is the empirical cme arrival ( eca ) model proposed by @xcite .",
    "the eca model assumes `` effective '' constant deceleration ( or acceleration ) of cme in the interplanetary space .",
    "@xcite introduced deceleration cessation distance of 0.76au after which icme propagate with constant speed in order to improve predictability of eca model . the empirical shock arrival ( esa ) model developed by @xcite based on the combination of eca model prediction and",
    "piston - driven shock propagation predicts 1 au arrival time of leading shock front . on the other hand ,",
    "the drag - based model predicts 1 au arrival time of cme ejecta taking into account the deceleration of cme by aerodynamic ( or viscous ) drag @xcite .",
    "the ` snow - plough ' model proposed by @xcite discussed the deceleration of cme based on the conservation of momentum as the cme sweeps up the slower solar wind ahead of it .",
    "the actual cme propagation in highly structured solar wind plasma involves various dynamical processes , such as deflection and rotation of cme flux rope , magnetic reconnection between cme and ambient solar wind , deformation of flux rope , etc .",
    "they are studied vigorously with the use of global mhd simulation in 3d @xcite .",
    "@xcite reported the first detailed examination of sun - to - earth propagation characteristics of thee fast cmes and associated shock front with the combination of wide angle heliospheric imaging observation by @xmath9 , interplanetary type ii radio bursts , and in - situ observation of solar wind parameters in multiple points .",
    "they reported that cme sun - to - earth propagation is approximately formulated into three phases , that are ( 1 ) an impulsive acceleration near the sun ( upto @xmath10 au ) , ( 2 ) rapid deceleration up to the distance of @xmath11 au and ( 3 ) nearly constant speed propagation or gradual deceleration afterwards .",
    "shock driving fast icmes are accompanied with continuously accumulating sheath plasma ahead .",
    "we need a model that describes the coevolution of interplanetary sheath and shock - driving icme propagation on a single theoretical basis",
    ". such a model would be helpful for the understanding of space weather impacting icme - related disturbances at 1 au such as speed , magnetic field strength and size of both interplanetary sheath and magnetic cloud as well as their arrival times .",
    "for this purpose , we construct a new model that connects icme deceleration and interplanetary shock propagation by taking into account the process of upstream solar wind plasma accumulation within the sheath region .",
    "we call the model `` sheath - accumulating propagation '' ( sap ) model of icmes",
    ". we note that the effect of the lorentz force and gravity are neglected in the sap model , which could also be effective especially in the vicinity of the sun @xcite .    in section 2",
    ", we introduce the sap model and investigate the icme propagation characteristics of the sap model . in section 3 , we discuss the thickness of interplanetary sheath ahead of icme . in section 4 , we compare the sap model with the drag - based model . in section 5",
    ", we present arrival time prediction by the sap model for 19 earth - directed cme - icme pairs and discuss its prediction ability . in section 6",
    ", we discuss the geomagnetic impact of super - massive , super - fast cmes associated with solar superflares based on the sap model .",
    "in the sap model , we assume the background solar wind as a spherically symmetric flow with uniform speed @xmath12 in heliocentric location @xmath13au . we express the total mass of the composite of the icme and interplanetary sheath at time @xmath14 as @xmath15 , and the radial speed and the heliocentric distance of the center of mass as @xmath16 and @xmath17 , respectively .",
    "initially ( at @xmath18 ) , the total mass , radial speed and the heliocentric distance of the icme - sheath composite are @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 , respectively ( figure 1 ) .",
    "for simplicity , we call @xmath16 and @xmath17 the icme speed and location , respectively , throughout this paper .",
    "we assume the icme angular half width @xmath22 is constant during its propagation . in reality , the cme properties near the sun are basically estimated by coronagraph observation . in the sap model , we neglect the effect of gravitational and lorentz force on the propagation of icme in @xmath23 space .",
    "the total mass of icme - sheath composite at time @xmath14 is expressed as @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the mass of interplanetary sheath ahead of icme ( figure 1 ) .",
    "assuming a constant fraction @xmath26 of plasma swept by interplanetary shock becomes a part of interplanetary sheath , we obtain @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are solar wind mass density and interplanetary shock propagation speed at @xmath30 , respectively . the icme solid angle @xmath31 is approximated by the half angular width @xmath22 as @xmath32 , assuming a circular cross section of the icme . in the sap model , we think of a spherically symmetric wind i.e. @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is a solar mass loss rate by the solar wind which is a constant .",
    "approximating the shock propagation speed by icme speed , i.e. @xmath35 , we get @xmath36 on the other hand , the conservation of momentum of icme - sheath composite is written as @xmath37      by solving equation ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) , we can express the icme arrival time ( t ) , the sheath mass ( @xmath38 ) , icme speed ( @xmath39 ) and the deceleration ( @xmath40 ) as a function of icme heliocentric location @xmath41 as follows , @xmath42",
    "@xmath43 @xmath44 @xmath45 where @xmath46 and @xmath47 are , @xmath48 @xmath49 the detailed derivation of the equations ( 5)-(8 ) is given in the appendix a.    generally , massive cmes experience only a weak deceleration and although the the deceleration @xmath50 decays slower with @xmath41 , they do not lose their speed so fast as light cmes where @xmath50 is initially very strong ( see figure 1 of @xcite as an example in the drag - based model ) .",
    "figure 2 ( a)-(d ) show @xmath51 , -@xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 with six different cme parameters in the sap model . when the cme mass is @xmath55  g ( thin lines ) , the icme experience rapid deceleration before @xmath56au followed by gradual deceleration afterwards .",
    "in that case , the icme arrive at 1 au with almost the same speed as background solar wind .",
    "this behavior is consistent with the two - phased deceleration characteristics of icme reported by @xcite .",
    "when the cme is as heavy as @xmath57  g ( thick lines ) , the icme arrives at 1 au with larger speed compared with @xmath58  g cases .",
    "we also note that the sap model , as well as the drag - based model , expects that faster cmes experience stronger deceleration .",
    "this tendency is consistent with observed deceleration of the shock front from the sun to 1au reported by @xcite . in section 2.3",
    ", we discuss the fundamental condition for fast icmes at earth ( e.g. @xmath59 km s@xmath1 ) as in the case of 2012 july 23 super - intense esp event .",
    "first , we consider the heliocentric distance @xmath60 at which the relative speed of icme with respect to the solar wind is halved i.e. @xmath61 . from equation ( 7 ) , @xmath60 satisfies the following relation .",
    "@xmath62 from equations ( 6 ) and ( 11 ) , this leads , @xmath63 from equations ( 8) , ( 12 ) and @xmath61 , we get @xmath64 , which means the rapid icme deceleration almost ceases at @xmath65 .",
    "we call @xmath60 a `` _ deceleration cessation distance _ '' , which is originally discussed in the empirical models @xcite . solving equation ( 11 ) , @xmath60 can be written in terms of @xmath66 and @xmath67 as follows , @xmath68 when the cme mass @xmath66 is larger than @xmath69 , @xmath60 is always larger than @xmath70 .",
    "this means cmes heavier than @xmath69 with any initial speed will arrive at 1 au without significant deceleration . in this sense , we call @xmath69 the `` _ critical cme mass _ '' for 1 au travel .",
    "thin and thick lines in the figure 3 ( a ) shows @xmath60 against @xmath67 with the cme mass of @xmath55  g and @xmath71  g , respectively in slow background solar wind .",
    "figure 3 ( b ) shows @xmath60 with the same cme parameters as in panel ( a ) but in a fast background solar wind .",
    "@xmath72 in the case of slow and fast winds are @xmath73  g and @xmath74  g , respectively .",
    "when the cme is heavier than or comparable to the critical mass ( as in the case of the thick line in figure 3 ( b ) ) , icme will stay fast when arriving at earth .",
    "we compare the extremely fast icme in 2012 july 23 event and the sap model prediction . before the arrival of the icme , solar wind speed and density measured in - situ by @xmath2 at the distance of 0.96 au from the sun",
    "were roughly @xmath75500 km s@xmath1 and @xmath76 @xmath8 with little variation .",
    "the corresponding critical cme mass is @xmath77  g. the peak cme speed near the sun is @xmath78 km s@xmath1 @xcite and the cme mass estimated with @xmath79/lasco was about @xmath80  g. with these values , equation ( 7 ) predicts the icme speed at 0.96 au to be between @xmath81 km s@xmath1 and @xmath82 km s@xmath1 which is consistent with the post - shock peak speed of 2250 km s@xmath1 measured at @xmath2 .",
    "we assumed @xmath83 and @xmath84 in above estimation .",
    "although the thickness of the sheath is an important parameter for understanding space weather storms such as geomagnetic storms , they are rarely considered in modeling or observations . in this section , we discuss the thickness of the interplanetary sheath @xmath85 expected by the sap model .",
    "the fast mode mach number of the leading shock is approximated as @xmath86 , with @xmath87 being the phase speed of fast mode mhd wave in background solar wind plasma .",
    "on the other hand , the sheath mass is approximately written as , @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the compression ratio of the interplanetary shock which depends not only on @xmath90 but also on upstream plasma beta and the angle between the shock normal and upstream magnetic field . from equations ( 6 ) and ( 14 ) , @xmath85 can be approximated as follows , @xmath91    if we assume the value of @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath92 and @xmath93 as those assumed in the previous section for 2012 july 23 event , and also @xmath94 , the sheath thickness estimated with equation ( 15 ) become @xmath95 au .",
    "the estimated sheath thickness of @xmath96 au is substantially larger than the typical thickness of @xmath97 au reported by @xcite because of exceptionally large @xmath67 and @xmath66 in 2012 july 23 event . assuming the sheath speed during its passage at the spacecraft to be @xmath98 km s@xmath1 , the transit time of the sheath of thickness 0.25 au would be @xmath99 5 hours .",
    "the actual solar wind disturbance detected by @xmath2 is known to be the merger of two successively launched cmes @xcite .",
    "the leading edges of the two cmes passed the spacecraft after the arrival of the leading shock front by 2 and 6 hours , respectively .",
    "the predicted sheath transit time of 5 hours is in between the two but more consistent with the latter .",
    "from the relation @xmath100 , the icme acceleration in the sap model ( equation ( 8) ) can be expressed as follows , @xmath101 with @xmath102 being the cross sectional area of icme .    on the other hand ,",
    "the cme acceleration in the drag - based model is as follows , @xmath103 where @xmath104 is a drag coefficient of order unity and @xmath105 is a `` virtual mass '' with @xmath106 being instantaneous cme volume ( @xcite ; see also @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the `` virtual mass '' formulation incorporated in the drag - based model is based on the assumption of potential flow passed a solid sphere @xcite .",
    "however , when @xmath107 is transonic or supersonic , the flow around the cme would be substantially different from the potential flow due to strong compressibility ( e.g. sheath forms ahead of the cme ) .",
    "in such a case , the sap model would give a straightforward estimation of the virtual mass ( @xmath108 ) .",
    "the dynamics of sheath accumulation discussed in the sap model is basically close to the `` piston - driven '' shock formation process @xcite . on the basis of the piston - driven mechanism ,",
    "the shock - driving cme is not necessarily supersonic .",
    "@xcite reported that the shocks tend to be associated with faster cmes ( with their speeds larger than 500 km s@xmath1 ) , while sometimes associated with slower cmes with speeds between 200 - 400 km s@xmath1 .",
    "when the sheath thickness is comparable to or larger than the lateral extent of the cme i.e. @xmath109 , a large part of the shocked plasma would escape from the sides of the cme , deviating from the piston - driven mechanism . in that case , the drag - based model rather than the sap model would give more appropriate description of the cme deceleration .",
    "the typical thickness of the sheath at 1 au reported by @xcite is @xmath110 au , which is likely much smaller than typical widths of cmes at 1au of @xmath111 assuming @xmath112 . from this",
    ", we expect the sap model can be widely applied to the decelerating propagation of cmes .",
    "the `` snow - plough '' model proposed by @xcite is mathematically very similar to the sap model .",
    "the detailed comparison between the formulas of the two are given in appendix b. the sap model is basically different to the `` snow - plough '' model in that it tracks the evolution of the sheath and that it is an analytical model with the assumption of the uniform solar wind speed .",
    "@xcite studied the relation between radial speed and expansion speed of 19 earth directed cmes that occurred during january 2010 to september 2012 when the @xmath9 and @xmath79 were viewing the sun in near quadrature .",
    "we apply the sap model to predict 1 au arrival time of the same set of cme - icme pairs as studied in @xcite .",
    "the average angular half width of the 19 cmes measured by stereo / cor2 is @xmath113 .",
    "the mass is estimated for 16 out of 19 cmes and listed in online soho / lasco cme catalog @xcite .",
    "the average cme mass of the 16 cmes is @xmath114  g. we note that the mass estimation of the earth - directed cmes based on @xmath79/lasco data is based on many assumptions which possibly introduce significant uncertainty in mass estimation .",
    "we refer to the observed 1 au arrival time of interplanetary shock as @xmath115 .",
    "we refer to the predicted 1 au arrival time based on the sap model as @xmath116 .",
    "@xmath117 where @xmath118 is time for a cme to travel from the sun to @xmath119 , and @xmath120 is sheath transit time at earth .",
    "we assumed @xmath121 so the icme center of mass when @xmath122 is almost at the midpoint of the sheath region .",
    "the average of the mass ratio @xmath123 expected from the sap model using equation ( 6 ) is 5.5 .",
    "we assumed typical slow background solar wind with @xmath124 km s@xmath1 and @xmath125 @xmath8 @xcite . @xmath126 and @xmath127 are assumed in the calculation of @xmath128 , so @xmath116 only depends on initial cme speed @xmath67 in this study . in the evaluation of @xmath129 , we assumed shock compression ratio to be @xmath130 in all cases for simplicity .",
    "we tried three different values of @xmath131 of 0.8 , 0.9 and 1.0 , and found @xmath132 minimized the root - mean - square ( @xmath133 ) of the observed - minus - calculated transit time differences .",
    "we note that we can not draw the conclusion merely from this that 90 percent of shocked solar wind plasma have been actually accumulated in the sheath in average , partly because assumed cme parameters , especially the mass , contains large uncertainty.the @xmath133 and the maximum value of the observed - minus - calculated transit time differences in @xmath132 case were 7.5 hours and 15.8 hours , respectively .",
    "figure 3 shows the correlation plot between predicted ( @xmath116 ) and observed ( @xmath115 ) arrival times in @xmath132 case .",
    "the icme - driven westward electric field at earth ( @xmath134 , with @xmath39 and @xmath135 being the speed and southward magnetic field of icme ) is the crucial space plasma quantity that drive intense geomagnetic storms @xcite .",
    "magnetic cloud core field is known to be correlated with the icme speed @xcite and the upper limit can be estimated by the equipartition field strength as follows @xcite , @xmath136 the upper limit of @xmath137 at 1 au can be expressed by @xmath138 and @xmath139 as follows , @xmath140 from equation ( 19 ) and ( 20 ) , @xmath141 is determined solely by icme speed ( and background solar wind density ) at 1 au , which depends both on the mass and speed of causative cmes due to equation ( 7 ) .",
    "based on the scaling relations among cme properties and flare soft x - ray peak flux ( @xmath142 ) at 0.1nm-0.8 nm measured by x - ray detector on board @xmath143 satellite discussed in @xcite , on the other hand , the upper limit of the mass and speed of cmes are expressed as follows , @xmath144 @xmath145 with @xmath146 w m@xmath147 being @xmath142 of x10 class flare . in equation ( 21 ) , we assumed the maximum cme mass associated with x10 flare to be @xmath148  g @xcite . applying equations ( 21 ) and ( 22 ) for the evaluation of @xmath141 in equation ( 20 )",
    ", we get @xmath141 as a function of @xmath142 .",
    "@xmath141 against @xmath142 ( or flare class ) with fast and slow background solar wind are plotted in figure 5 . when @xmath149 , @xmath150 holds , and @xmath151 approximately scales as @xmath152 .",
    "based on the discussion above , @xmath153 associated with x10 flare , for example , will be @xmath154  mv  m@xmath1 .",
    "if such @xmath137 continues for @xmath155 hours , @xmath156 would be @xmath157  nt , following the formula by @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the upper limit of @xmath158 inherent in geomagnetism is evaluated to be @xmath159 nt in @xcite , which is comparable to the upper limit of @xmath158 associated with x10 flare above .",
    "further careful discussion is needed to evaluate actual upper limit of @xmath158 associated with huge solar flares of @xmath160x10 class .",
    "in the appendix , we derive equations ( 5)-(8 ) from equations ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) .    we first define two new variables , @xmath161 and @xmath162 , so that equations ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) can be expressed as @xmath163 @xmath164 solving equation ( a2 ) with respect to @xmath165 , we get , @xmath166 with @xmath167 . substituting equation ( a1 ) into equation ( a3 ) , we get , @xmath168 integrating equation ( a4 ) by @xmath14 , we get @xmath169 substituting @xmath170 into equation ( a5 ) , we get a quadratic equation of @xmath14 as follows , @xmath171 solving the quadratic equation ( a6 ) with respect to @xmath14 , we get the arrival time t(r ) as given by equation ( 5 ) , where we used abbreviations @xmath172 and @xmath173 defined by equations ( 9 ) and ( 10 ) .    then substituting equation ( 5 ) into @xmath170 , we express @xmath174 in terms of @xmath41 as follows , @xmath175 if we substitute equation ( a7 ) into equation ( a1 ) , we get the sheath mass @xmath176 as equation ( 6 ) .    substituting equation ( a7 ) into equation ( a4 ) , we get @xmath177 as in equation ( 7 ) .",
