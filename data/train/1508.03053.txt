    "we discard the data point because it is ( correctly ) assumed that some error has occurred on * a*.    to confirm our estimates , we numerically calculate the failure rate with @xmath120 monte - carlo simulations of the composite depolarizing channel @xmath154 . with a single exception ,",
    "the failure probability is by definition the number of syndromes beginning with @xmath163 divided by the total number of randomly generated errors .",
    "the exception comes from the ambiguity of whether the syndrome @xmath164 should count towards the error rate , as @xmath25 may be generated by the identity mapping or by any element in the normalizer group @xmath165 , i.e. the group of errors commuting the all stabilizer elements .    however , we know that the identity operator ( @xmath166 ) occurs with probability @xmath167 as illustrated by the blue dashed curve in fig .",

    "this function of @xmath170 is plotted as the dashed green line in fig .",
    "[ fig : failure ] and exactly matches our numerical data .",
    "the leading term in @xmath170 goes as @xmath171 in contrast to to non - concatenated dcqd schemes whose failure rate gores as @xmath172 , the probability for weight - one errors .",

    "we have introduced a dcqd code that directly characterizes the quantum dynamics of a principal system with assistance from a noisy ancilla system . within the stabilizer framework",
    ", we show that ancilla noise can be distinguished from processes acting on the principal system by using syndrome value as a filter for non - trivial ancilla processes .",
    "for the example of dcqd with a @xmath173 $ ] , we have concatenated the ancilla qubits for purposes of detecting weight - one processes . and compared the characterization of an amplitude damping process on the principal system using three different approaches : ( i ) clean ancilla system , ( ii ) noisy ancilla using a standard dcqd , and ( iii ) noisy ancilla using our concatenated @xmath74 $ ] code .",
    "our numerical simulations found that the process matrix constructed using the six - qubit code shows a marked improvement in fidelity over the non - concatenated approaches .",
    "our motivation for encoding the ancilla qubits has been to filter out those measurements that correspond to unwanted data . from this perspective",
    ", ancilla encoding represents a form of filtering the dynamics to isolate non - trivial processes acting only on the principal system .",
    "we have argued that filtering increases the signal - to - noise ratio for process characterization , as measured by the gain in fidelity of the constructed matrix .",
    "of course , the gain for process characterization depends strongly on the details of the ancilla filter .",
    "for example , the 6-qubit code introduced here detects only weight - one ancilla errors and their product with located principal system errors @xmath105 .",
    "when higher weight errors are common , the benefit of this ancilla encoding diminishes , and larger distance codes are needed to filter higher weights processes .",
    "for example , a distance 4 code that detects all weight-2 ancilla errors will have a filter failure rate that scale as @xmath174 with @xmath144 the ancilla error rate .",
    "we could also have used a non - degenerate @xmath175 $ ] code to encode the ancilla , where each detectable error would have a unique error syndrome . in this case",
    ", each syndrome would be used without a filtering procedure . in general",
    ", one can improve the signal to noise ratio at the expense of additional ancilla qubits and larger codes .",
    "additionally , we have taken @xmath83 throughout thought this work , but we could have used a @xmath176 code satisfying a generalized hamming bound @xcite .",
    "for example , a non - concatenated code performing error correction on two qubits with another encoded is provided in ref .  .",
    "equations ( [ eq : syn_prob_diag])-([eq : syn_prob_coherence_2 ] ) are easily generalized using the higher dimensional projectors @xmath177 resulting in a code which detects ancilla errors while encoding some non - trivial quantum information .",
    "recent progress in realizing stabilizer qec circuits with 9 and 4 qubits on different lattice configurations suggest that the implementation of these ideas should be experimentally feasible in the near future @xcite .",
    "in particular , it is worth noting that the characterization processes described here and in earlier dcqd work do not require active , feed - forward error correction for purposes of implementation .",
    "consequently , the use of qec - based dcqd appears to be a natural way point toward the demonstration of error - corrected computation .",
