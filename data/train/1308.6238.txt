    "the star counts method is an important tool for the investigation of the galactic structure and is based on the equation of stellar statistics @xcite :    @xmath3    which allows us to predict the number of objects for a certain line - of - sight defined by the galactic longitude @xmath4 and the galactic latitude @xmath5 .",
    "@xmath6 is the number of stars of type @xmath7 with apparent magnitude between @xmath8 and @xmath9 in a solid angle @xmath10 in the direction defined by @xmath11 ; @xmath12 is the heliocentric distance , @xmath13 is the stellar density and @xmath14 is the luminosity function .",
    "we adopted the luminosity function as the number of stars per cubic parsec near the sun with magnitudes in the range @xmath15 .",
    "it is convenient to handle the stellar densities normalized with respect to the values in the solar neighborhood",
    ".    the star counts models can be classified in roughly two categories : those adopting an empirical luminosity function  based on observations of the stellar populations in the solar neighborhood and specific environments , like globular clusters  and those adopting a luminosity function derived from theoretical stellar evolutionary tracks and the associated distributions of stellar masses , ages and metallicities .",
    "the pioneer investigation of @xcite fits into the first group , together with models like the ones by @xcite , @xcite ( hereafter ol93 ) , @xcite and @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the works of @xcite and @xcite belong to the group of models which adopt a stellar evolution approach to define the luminosity function .    the number of components used to represent the galaxy varies from model to model , according to the focus of the work .",
    "basically , two components are always present : a disk and a spheroid .",
    "after @xcite many authors adopted the disk component consisting of a thin disk and a thick disk . concerning the spheroid , despite this terminology being used in all models , it actually may indicate different galactic structures , like the bulge , the halo or even both ( e.g. , ol93 ) .",
    "the densities of stars on the disks decrease exponentially with galactocentric radius and with the vertical distance to the plane , whereas the density in the spheroid follows a decay similar to the de vaucouleurs law .    despite strong evidence that our galaxy has a spiral structure , the number of arms , as well as the parameters which describe their shapes and positions vary from work to work ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the star counts models which attempt to take the spiral arms into account are those due to ol93 and @xcite .",
    "the existence of a bar in the central region of our galaxy was proposed in the 1970s based on the large non - circular motions seen in the observations of hi and co in the inner galaxy @xcite , but only in the 1990s the combination of evidences such as the nir light distribution @xcite , star counts asymmetries @xcite , gas kinematics @xcite and large microlensing optical depth @xcite became more persuasive .",
    "@xcite examined the star counts in the bv bands and assumed that the galaxy could be well represented by two components : a disk and a spheroid .",
    "@xcite examined the star counts in the ubv bands and used three components to model the galaxy : a disk , a halo and an exponential spheroid population with intermediate age .",
    "@xcite adopted five components ( disk , halo , bulge , spiral arms , molecular ring ) to model the galaxy star counts as a foreground for their extragalactic source counts based on infrared astronomical satellite survey ( iras ) .",
    "ol93 attempted to model the star counts in rijhkl , [ 12 @xmath16 m ] and [ 25 @xmath16 m ] iras bands , using four components : a spheroid , two disks with scale heights 100 pc and 390 pc , and spiral arms .",
    "a version of the model with an intermediate disk and a bar is described in their websitejacques / pingas.html ] .",
    "the approach of @xcite uses a stellar populations synthesis code as the input for the luminosity function to compare their four components model ( thick disk , thin disk , halo , bulge ) with optical and infrared data , including the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) , chandra deep field south ( cdfs ) and hipparcos . @xcite",
    "have compared the stars counts from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) with the predicted counts from their galactic model with a disk and a halo .",
    "@xcite used a model with a spheroid and a disk , and a power - law luminosity function for which the power index is a free parameter at each grid point on the sky for galactic latitudes @xmath17 .",
    "the comparison was made for 8192 lines - of - sight in the 2mass k@xmath18 band .    in this study",
    "we use the homogeneous all sky coverage of the 2mass to test the ol93 model in the jhk@xmath18 bands .",
    "we explore the parameters space of this model adopting an updated luminosity function to describe the stellar populations in the solar neighborhood .    in sections 2 and 3 ,",
    "we describe the ol93 model and the method used to search for the best fit parameters .",
    "the results and discussion are presented in section 4 .",
    "our conclusions follow in the last section .",
    "the ol93 model uses a young disk , an old disk , an intermediate disk composed of c - stars , a spheroid , spiral arms and a bar , with the total number density of sources being the sum of all individual contributions .",
    "a detailed description of all components follows .",
    "we consider a thin ( young ) disk and a thick ( old ) disk .",
    "the density of each subcomponent @xmath19 , is given by a modified exponential @xcite , which is an important change with respect to the original model :    @xmath20    here @xmath12 is the distance to the galactic center in the plane of the galaxy , @xmath21 is the star density of spectral type @xmath7 in the solar neighborhood , @xmath22 is the radial scale length , which does not depend on the spectral type , @xmath23 is the scale height and @xmath24 is the radius of a hole in the central part of the disk .",
    "the thick disk has a distribution of spectral types of giants similar to that found in globular clusters .",
    "all the stars of spectral types o and b , as well as the supergiants of all spectral types were excluded from de composition of the thick disk .",
    "the scale height @xmath23 is given by :    @xmath25    where @xmath26 is the scale height in the solar neighborhood .",
    "the free parameters of the model related to the disks are @xmath27 .",
    "recent studies ( e.g. , @xcite and @xcite ) suggest the existence of a minimum in the density of young objects in the solar neighborhood due to the effects of corotation of the spiral pattern with the galactic rotation .",
    "we experimented with this possibility modeling the young disk density with    @xmath28 , \\label{densjacques}\\ ] ]    where @xmath12 and @xmath29 are expressed in kpc .",
    "the results of this attempt are shown in section 4.2.1 .",
    "ol93 also consider an intermediate disk consisting of carbon stars which are bright in infrared mainly during their asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) phase , when they lose mass at high rates .",
    "this component does not show radial dependence @xcite but its density decreases exponentially with the distance to the galactic plane with a scale height of 200 pc .",
    "we did not attempt determining any parameter related to this component .",
    "the ol93 model does not use warp components on the disks .",
    "evidences for the presence of this contribution in 2mass data are presented by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "uncertainties related to the different space distributions of dust and stars @xcite and differences in the distribution of giant and main sequence stars ( eg .",
    "@xcite ) led us not to attempt including this component in our modeling .",
    "the spheroidal structure is subtle , and when we observe it , specially close to the galactic center , we see the superimposition of contributions from the young and old disks ( which may or may not have central holes ) , and a galactic bar . besides , the innermost regions of the spheroid are subject to heavy reddening . a number of improvements to the description of this region as a whole",
    "have been suggested in the last decade .",
    "@xcite found that the best fit to 2mass data is given by a structure which consists of a boxy bar associated to a tri - axial bulge .",
    "@xcite also use a tri - axial figure which is truncated by a gaussian decay , and @xcite describe the 2mass data in the central region of the galaxy ( @xmath30 ) with a triaxial boxy bar / bulge plus a longer and thicker ellipsoid .",
    "@xcite , @xcite and @xcite investigated the x - shaped component which is part of the bar / bulge structure .",
    "the ol93 model uses an oblate spheroid in an attempt to describe both the inner region and larger outer scales .",
    "the density in the spheroid is adapted from the mass density of @xcite and is given by : @xmath31    where @xmath32 is the distance to the galactic center , @xmath33 , with @xmath34 being the oblateness of the spheroid and @xmath35 the distance above the galactic plane .",
    "@xmath36 is a scale length , and @xmath37 .",
    "the last term is the ratio of densities of spheroid and disk populations in the solar neighborhood .",
    "@xmath29 is the distance of the sun to the galactic center , taken here as 8.0kpc  very close to both arithmetic and weighted means of @xmath29 determinations obtained since 1992 ( @xcite ) .",
    "ol93 used r@xmath38kpc , which was intermediate between the iau recommended 8.5 kpc and the  short scale \" value 7.5 kpc often used at the time ( see for instance a discussion in section 2 of @xcite ) .",
    "the stellar population of the spheroid is considered the same as that of the thick disk , discussed below .",
    "@xmath36 , @xmath34 and @xmath39 are free parameters in the ol93 model .",
    "one of the first representations of the spiral structure in the milky way , due to @xcite , proposed a four arms pattern .",
    "since then , many authors have studied this galactic component , obtaining discrepant results for the number of arms and their locations .",
    "recent results include @xcite , based on the space distribution of type ii cepheids which suggest deviations from what logarithmic spirals predict for the saggitarius - carina arm and the local arm .",
    "@xcite traced the cs molecular emission related to iras sources and concluded that they are not fitted by logarithmical arms , rather by a sequence of straight line segments . from 2mass data and gas distributions ,",
    "@xcite concluded that the milky way is a two - armed grand - design spiral .",
    "@xcite found the existence of two dominant and two secondary arms on glimpse , mipsgal and iras data . in the outer parts of the galaxy",
    "the spiral arms are not very prominent .",
    "@xcite even suggested , based on 2mass data , that the galaxy is flocculent in that region .",
    "comprehensive reviews of earlier works can be found in @xcite .",
    "the spiral pattern is the same as in the ol93 model , with four logarithmic arms , each described by :    @xmath40    where @xmath41 is the galactic radius where each arm begins , @xmath42 is the initial galactocentric angle and @xmath43 is the pitch angle .",
    "the arms are confined to the range of galactic radii 2 kpc @xmath44 15 kpc and consist of o5-b stars of all luminosity classes and supergiants of all spectral types .",
    "we adopted an improved version of the ol93 arms configuration , consistent with recent observations .",
    "values for @xmath41 , @xmath43 and @xmath42 were derived from the fit of equation [ arms ] to the representation seen in @xcite which is based on the model of @xcite with some modifications : variations in positions according to results of parallax distances to masers in regions of stellar formation @xcite ; refinement in the tangential directions to the arms from co surveys @xcite ; revisions in the amplitudes of the arms due to glimpse results and the work of @xcite ; and finally , the locations of the outer and distant arms using kinematical data @xcite .    the only parameter related to the spiral pattern which we attempted to derive from the 2mass observations is the density contrast between the arms and the thin disk , @xmath45 , since the arms behave as enhancements of the disk density .",
    "the stars density perpendicular to the arm s length is described by a gaussian function and its half width at half maximum is taken as @xmath46pc .",
    "the tangential directions to the arms , which are also the directions where we expect to see the largest contribution of the arms to the star counts , are located at longitudes 32@xmath47 , 49@xmath47 , 284@xmath47 and 308@xmath47 .",
    "prior information on the structural properties of the bar is somewhat sparse .",
    "it is generally accepted that our galaxy has a bar , but its length , shape and orientation cover wide ranges in the literature .",
    "the half length of the bar , for example , ranges from 0.67 kpc in @xcite to 3.9 kpc in @xcite .    in our modeling , the bar contribution to the stellar density is given by :    @xmath48 ^ 2 + \\left ( \\frac{z^\\prime}{z_0 } \\right)^4 \\right\\rbrace ^{\\frac{1}{4 } } \\nonumber \\\\",

    "we explored axes ratios in the ranges @xmath52 and @xmath53 up to 4 kpc , a little more than the largest value found in the literature @xcite .",
    "the orientation of the bar with respect to the line sun - gc , @xmath54 , was allowed to be in the range @xmath55  @xmath56 . even though not strongly constrained by the 2mass data",
    ", we attempted to determine the geometrical parameters of the bar as well as the density contrast between the bar and the disks .",
    "the interstellar extinction is an important ingredient of a galactic model , specially in the galactic plane . due to the accumulation of dust in the galactic plane ,",
    "the extinction is larger in this region of the galaxy .",
    "the model of @xcite is based on the distribution of gas ( hi and co ) and interstellar dust ( iras 100 @xmath16 m ) , under the assumption that the dust is well mixed with the gas . in this model",
    ", the galaxy has axial symmetry , the gas density varies radially in a smooth way and the spiral arms produce no effects in the extinction .",
    "the interstellar extinction is calculated assuming that it is proportional to column density of hydrogen , in both atomic ( @xmath57 ) and molecular ( @xmath58 ) forms :    @xmath59    here @xmath60 is a proportionality factor , with average value of @xmath61 mag @xmath62 @xcite , if @xmath63 , but it can change along the galactocentric radius due to the metallicity gradient . for galactocentric distances in the plane with @xmath64 kpc ,",
    "the authors suggest a proportionality with @xmath65 . for @xmath66 kpc , due to the highly uncertain metallicity of the region , a constant value is employed .",
    "similar analytical expressions were adopted for both gas forms :    @xmath67    where , for hi , @xmath687 kpc , @xmath691.9 kpc and @xmath700.7 @xmath71 , and for h@xmath72 , @xmath681.2 kpc , @xmath693.5 kpc and @xmath7058 @xmath71 . since there is a large concentration of h@xmath72 in the galactic center , for @xmath73 1.2 kpc this was modeled separately with the function    @xmath74    with @xmath75 kpc and @xmath76@xmath77 .",
    "the vertical distribution of hydrogen is given by a gaussian function of @xmath35 :    @xmath78    where @xmath79 is the half width at half height of the scale height .",
    "@xcite suggest for the scale height of h@xmath72 :    @xmath80    while for hi the same expression must be multiplied by a factor 1.8 .",
    "the luminosity function used in this work follows ol93 and enters the code via a table containing up to 64 classes of objects among main sequence , giants , supergiants and variable objects .",
    "the space densities were updated to be consistent with recent results .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows the luminosity function for main sequence and giant stars according to ol93 , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the luminosity functions for supergiants and variable objects are the same as in ol93 .",
    "since interstellar extinction is lower in the near infrared ( nir ) , surveys in this region are efficient to investigate the structure of the galaxy .",
    "the 2mass project @xcite covers 99.8% of the sky in the nir with 471 million point sources observed in j ( 1.25 @xmath16 m ) , h ( 1.65 @xmath16 m ) and k@xmath0 ( 2.17 @xmath16 m ) . at snr=10 ,",
    "the limit magnitudes for point objects are 15.8 , 15.1 and 14.3 in the j , h and k@xmath0 bands , respectively .",
    "these limits refer to unconfused sources outside the galactic plane ( @xmath81 ) and far from areas where the interstellar extinction is large .",
    "the all - sky coverage of the 2mass data allows us to make a comprehensive comparison of the observed counts with the predictions of the model by ol93",
    ".    the number of sources in a given line - of - sight through the galaxy can be obtained from the 2mass database in three forms : cone , box and polygon search .",
    "taking into account practical aspects such as the elapsed time for retrieving the data , we opted to use the cone search , with a cone area of one square degree .",
    "we use a grid of galactic longitudes and latitudes as generated by the hierarchical equal area isolatitude pixelization of the sphere ( healpix ) @xcite in order to obtain a uniform sampling in galactic coordinates .",
    "the orientation of the grid is such that the  equator \" of the healpix scheme coincides with the galactic plane .",
    "our basic grid contains 192 points ( the n@xmath82 parameter of healpix = 4 ) . a n@xmath82=8 grid ( 768 points )",
    "was used to provide four neighbors to each point of the n@xmath82=4 scheme in order to estimate the variance of the star counts at each position of the basic grid .",
    "this allows us to verify if the assumption of using a @xmath83 law for the uncertainty in the counts , @xmath84 , is reasonable .",
    "it turns out that the dispersion obtained from the five points estimate is consistent with the poisson uncertainties for most of the sky , but significant differences show up close to the galactic plane .",
    "this simply reflects the structure of the galaxy in a scale of a few degrees and the large gradients in star counts along the @xmath35 direction close to the galactic plane .",
    "we investigated the results of using one or other option for the uncertainties in the observed star counts and the results are shown in section [ section : results ] .",
    "the output of a cone search is a list of jhk@xmath18 magnitudes and catalog flags for each counted object .",
    "the flags include important indicators to eliminate low quality counts .",
    "we examined the following flags : photometric quality , read flag , contamination and confusion flag , and galactic contamination ( extended objects ) flag . table [ tb : tb1 ] summarizes the criteria to consider a source _ bad_. table [ tb : tb2 ] summarizes the percentage of rejections for a few lines - of - sight .",
    "one can see that even far from the galactic plane , the k@xmath18 band is more prone to be affected by rejections than the other bands , while in regions near the galactic plane the three bands have about 50% rejections .",
    "this indicates that comparisons in the galactic plane should not go to magnitudes fainter than 11 . using an extreme field as an example ( @xmath85 ) ,",
    "at the 11th magnitude bin we find 74 rejections out of a total of 1062 counts for the j band , 566 ( in a total of 4860 ) for the h band and 2076 ( in a total of 9990 ) for the k@xmath0 band ( 7% , 11.6% and 20.8% , respectively ) .",
    "the fractions of rejections are 25 to 30% from photometric quality , 10 - 15% from the read flag and 65 - 75% from the contamination / confusion flag .",
    "the limiting magnitude varies from grid point to grid point due to differences in interstellar extinction and to the existence of non - resolved close sources .",
    "this is specially true for regions in the galactic plane and close to the galactic center . to set up a limiting magnitude for each grid point we stepped in magnitude , counting the corresponding objects and monitoring the number of associated rejections .",
    "the limiting magnitude was set when the fraction of rejected objects reached 10% .",
    "objects not rejected are put into ascending order of magnitude in each band and the cumulative star counts are obtained from the sums up to a certain limit magnitude .",
    "the differential counts can be obtained from the latter .",
    "models in which multiple parameters are to be evaluated are recognizably challenging , in the sense that traditional methods of search for an optimal solution , like those based on gradients in the figure of merit ( e.g. , the downhill simplex method of @xcite ) may lead to local maxima ( or minima ) which can be far from the best solution .",
    "a number of statistical methods has received attention in the last decades because even though being relatively slow , they produce reliable results .",
    "we chose to use the markov chain monte carlo method to have an overall view of the parameter space , including a rough localization but with a reliable measure of the spread of the parameters , and the nested sampling ( ns ) method to have a better estimate of the parameter values .",
    "we experimented with mcmc chains of up to @xmath86 iterations to have an overview of possible multiple modes in parameter space .",
    "our conclusion is that with typically @xmath87 iterations one can unambiguously limit the region of interest for each parameter .",
    "the ns procedure subsequently progresses faster to the mode , in some cases with only a few hundred iterations .",
    "markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) @xcite is probably the preferred first approach for an overall view of the parameter space in a multi - parameter problem .",
    "it has the virtue of being very simple to code and provides a first assessment of the location and spread of the parameters .",
    "it is perfectly suited for the bayesian context , where prior information may be relevant in parameter estimation or model selection .",
    "briefly , if we have a set of data @xmath88 with individual points @xmath89 and a model @xmath90 with a vector of parameters @xmath91 , for which we are able to calculate the likelihood @xmath92 , the mcmc algorithm progresses as follows .    1 .",
    "consider an initial state @xmath93 , randomly chosen , with associated likelihood @xmath92 .",
    "2 .   draw a random candidate state @xmath94 , statistically centered on @xmath93 , for which the likelihood is @xmath95 .",
    "3 .   calculate the ratio @xmath96 4 .",

    "record the chosen state and continue at step  2 .",
    "since we considered flat priors for all parameters , the histograms of the chain for each parameter may be regarded as proportional to the _ a posteriori _ distribution of the parameter .",
    "each histogram location gives us an estimate of the value of the parameter itself and the confidence region ( or uncertainty ) may be obtained by integrating the area ( for example , the one corresponding to the 1-@xmath102 quantile in a normal distribution ) around the mode or the median of the histogram .    by far step 2 in the scheme above",
    "is the most involving , since it implies defining a _ step size _ by which to statistically draw the proposal states @xmath94 .",
    "suppose a particular parameter @xmath103 .",
    "as for all other variables , we work on normalized quantities ( here @xmath104 ) calculating @xmath105 and then draw the proposal @xmath106 . here",
    "`` @xmath107 '' means `` distributed as '' .",
    "the numerical factor @xmath108 ensures that the step variance is similar to the variance generated by the step @xmath109 in a uniform distribution . with this scheme ,",
    "all normalized variables are subject to the same step size .",
    "we follow the recommendations in the literature ( e.g. , @xcite ) and tune @xmath109 as the chain progresses to have an acceptance rate of @xmath110 .",
    "the initial value of @xmath109 is 0.25 , and the adaptive scheme for changing its size is only started after @xmath111 steps of the chain , to allow for exploration of distant regions in parameter space .",
    "we investigated two forms for the likelihood @xmath92 .",
    "in the first , we calculate for the whole grid of @xmath112 lines - of - sight ( in one band , say h ) ,    @xmath113    here @xmath114 are the 2mass observed counts in each line - of - sight , with @xmath115 running from the lower magnitude limit @xmath116 to the upper magnitude limit @xmath117 and @xmath118 are the corresponding model quantities .",
    "each line - of - sight has a cumulative histogram of @xmath119   + 1\\right ) $ ] magnitude bins .",
    "the other bands are treated similarly , and we finally write for the likelihood    @xmath120    with @xmath121 .    since equation[like1 ] assumes that the @xmath122 terms in equation[eq : qui2 ] are statistically independent and normally distributed  and the latter is not the case for low counts  we also used the poisson likelihood form prescribed in @xcite and @xcite :    @xmath123    where @xmath124 .",
    "the two likelihood forms allow us to perform a sanity check on the results since equation[eq : qui2 ] gives more weight to instances of large star counts while equation[poisson ] attributes equal weights to the counts in all magnitude bins .",
    "the largest difference in parameter values , however , is small , typically less than 5% .",
    "the median of the absolute value of the relative residuals , ( @xmath125 , in a grid of 3072 lines - of - sight is typically less than 2% .",
    "nested sampling ( ns ) is an algorithm for optimization in multi - parameter problems invented by @xcite .",
    "it relies on the idea that whatever the number of parameters in a model , we can always populate the parameter space with a number @xmath126 of random samples and calculate their likelihoods . instead of focusing on the best likelihoods , the algorithm works on the worst .",
    "our implementation of ns is as follows :    1 .",
    "populate the parameter space with @xmath126 samples chosen randomly .",
    "notice that a minimum minimorum choice for @xmath126 would be @xmath111 , where @xmath127 is the number of parameters being sought .",
    "calculate the associated @xmath128 .",
    "the associated @xmath129 parameters are stored in the vectors @xmath130 2 .",
    "@xmath92 among the @xmath131 and call it @xmath132 3 .",

    "substitute @xmath139 with @xmath137 and jump to step 2 .",
    "a simple scheme for stopping the ns algorithm was set based on the size of the mcmc proposal step in item 4 above .",
    "when @xmath140 , we finish the iterations .",
    "again , @xmath109 is allowed to vary only after @xmath111 steps of the ns algorithm .",
    "the limits we adopted for parameters search are shown in table [ tb : tb3 ] .",
    "they were chosen so to cover with some slack the range of values found in the literature .",
    "the n@xmath82=4 healpix grid provides a good first assessment of the galactic parameters but has the obvious limitation of being too coarse , specially in regions close to the galactic center . to circumvent that , we did several experiments with finer grids , for which only a few parameters were explored .",
    "for example , a grid of 382 lines - of - sight drawn from n@xmath82=16 healpix scheme provides a good coverage of the central region of the galaxy and is not very expensive in terms of computing time . at @xmath141",
    "it samples every @xmath142 in longitude and @xmath143 in latitude . in order to probe also regions far from the galactic center ,",

    "however , @xmath36 and @xmath39 are .",
    "this is due to the fact that the cusp in star counts clearly visible at @xmath146 is well sampled by the finer grid .",

    "figure [ fig3 ] shows an overview of the joint distributions of probabilities of the parameters from a mcmc run of @xmath86 iterations considering the n@xmath82=4 healpix grid .",
    "one can see that @xmath144 and @xmath145 are the best constrained parameters , followed by @xmath39 and @xmath34 .",
    "two factors contribute for making the estimates of @xmath36 , @xmath147 , and @xmath148 more difficult : their much more subtle contribution to the overall behavior of the counts and the relatively poor resolution of the 192 points grid .",
    "one has to recall that the separation of samples in longitude for @xmath149 is @xmath150 , and that the first `` parallels '' are at @xmath151 .",
    "the parameter related to the contrast of the spiral arms , @xmath45 , and the parameters of the bar ( @xmath152 ) were kept fixed at the best possible guesses when using the sparse grid .",
    "this means contrasts of the order of the unity , @xmath153 , @xmath154 pc and @xmath155 .    figure [ fig4 ] illustrates our attempt to better constrain the parameters via the ns algorithm . for @xmath156 and @xmath39",
    "the best solution coincides well with the maximum likelihoods from the mcmc run . for @xmath157 , @xmath34 , @xmath45 and @xmath51",
    "the maxima tend to fall in regions that may be far from the correspondent in the mcmc distribution .",
    "this just reflects the `` flat '' nature of the likelihood landscape , with small differences between the discrete evaluations which can lead to solutions along a wide range of values .",
    "we tried to mitigate this limitation choosing as the start state for the ns algorithm 32 random likelihoods among the 5% best evaluated in a mcmc run of 25000 steps .",
    "the result is shown in figure [ fig5 ] .",
    "we see that the best determined parameters from the mcmc procedure converged to consistent values , while the rest tend  even though converging to definite values  to show substantial spread in parameter space as the ns algorithm progressed .",
    "table[tb : tb4 ] summarizes the results shown in figs .",
    "[ fig3 ] , [ fig4 ] and [ fig5 ] in numerical form . the well constrained parameters , @xmath158 , @xmath159 , @xmath160 and @xmath145 , show consistency in all three approaches and are probably more accurately determined than indicated by the mcmc procedure alone . for the rest of the parameters",
    "the range indicated by the mcmc exploration is large and reflects the weak constraints imposed on them by the adopted sampling grid .",
    "table[tb : tb5 ] shows the effects of adopting different uncertainties in the star counts as mentioned in section 3.1 . to make the comparison simple , we chose to minimize only the well determined parameters .",
    "as one can see , the different weighting schemes do not produce conflicting results . in the following ,",
    "we discuss only results for which the @xmath83 scheme was used .",
    "the adoption of a finer grid ( see section 3.3 ) improves our ability in determining parameters that are related to spatially limited regions of the galaxy .",
    "this is the case for the spheroid , for example .",
    "figure [ fig6 ] shows the result of a mcmc on such a finer grid .",

    ". a further ns run on the region constrained by the mcmc run of figure [ fig6 ] using the full resolution of a n@xmath82 = 16 ( 3072 points ) grid , provided us with what we consider the best estimate for the basic galactic parameters from the 2mass data .",
    "they are discussed in the following section .",
    "table [ tb : tb6 ] shows the results of this work together with a compilation of corresponding values found in the literature , to facilitate a comparison and discussion of possible differences .",
    "the first result that catches our attention is @xmath158 , for which we obtain values which are systematically smaller than those quoted in the literature , specially considering the results from the n@xmath161 coarse grid .",
    "we attribute at least part of the difference to the interplay between @xmath158 and @xmath147  the latter in general not used in models by other authors .",
    "@xmath159 is comparable with the estimates of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "like in most cases seen in the literature , we found that @xmath162 is larger than @xmath163 .",
    "@xcite present parameters for the galactic disk also based on 2mass data .",
    "they found 2.1 kpc for the scale length of the disk , which is in agreement with what we found for the thin disk .",
    "the value we obtain for @xmath147 is consistent with the estimates by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the two scale heights , @xmath160 and @xmath145 , are also well determined parameters .",
    "@xmath160 is in good agreement with the values obtained by @xcite and @xcite but slightly smaller than those found by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "@xmath145 is definitively smaller than the values in the literature ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite determined the scale height of the sole disk in their model equal to 310 pc , which is intermediate between the values we found in our two - disks model . in this context , it is important to recall that in our model @xmath160 and @xmath145 follow eq .",
    "[ zxr ] , and as consequence , any comparison with the literature should refer to the solar neighborhood values .",
    "the scale length parameter of the spheroid , @xmath36 , defines how well the",
    " cusp \" in star counts close to the galactic center is fitted .",
    "this cusp is conspicuous if we examine the @xmath164 longitudinal counts at @xmath165 , the first ",
    "parallel \" in the n@xmath82=16 healpix scheme . to be able to reproduce the cusp with the spheroidal population of eq.[spheroid ]",
    ", @xmath36 has necessarily to be small and the normalization @xmath39 large .",
    "the largest values needed for @xmath39 , however , do not exceed 0.01 .",
    "the oblateness of the spheroid , @xmath34 , estimated to be @xmath166 , is consistent with the range of values in the literature , 0.550.8 .",
    "we notice that since there is a correlation between this parameter and @xmath39 , both parameters should always be optimized simultaneously .",
    "@xcite suggest that this parameter could vary with galactocentric radius .",
    "@xcite concluded that the spheroid would be better described by two subpopulations , one related to an inner bulge , with oblateness @xmath107 0.6 , and another related to an outer bulge , with oblateness @xmath107 0.9 .",
    "a comparison of our results for the spheroid with those of @xcite would be interesting since this is a recent result also based on 2mass data .",
    "unfortunately , it is not straightforward .",
    "those authors use additional components in their boxy bar / bulge + thicker ellipsoid structure . besides",
    ", they express their results as maps of residuals given by @xmath167 for a very fine grid with 15 arcmin separation in the region @xmath168 and @xmath169 .",
    "one can see from their figure 3 that only the central region , a few square degrees in size , presents residuals well in excess of 20% .",
    "however , their best fit model ( case s + e in the paper ) involves 15 parameters , while our description uses 7 parameters for the spheroid which are optimized _ simultaneously _ with the parameters that describe the rest of the galaxy .",
    "considering the same @xmath170 region , our model presents a smooth trend of overestimating the star counts for @xmath171 , with typical values of the residuals of @xmath172 .",
    "the largest residual in the @xmath170 region is 0.46 .    in models where the bulge follows a truncated power law ( @xcite and @xcite ) , the scale length of the bulge plays a different role with respect to our @xmath36",
    " it indicates , roughly , the truncation radius of the bar . for this reason we can",
    "not quantitatively compare these scales .",
    "similar difficulties are found in the case of the boxy - bulge of @xcite .",
    "the hwhm of a gaussian density profile would be 425 pc , close to our length scale , but the contribution of the boxy - bulge structure extends to larger galactocentric radii .",
    "the parameter describing the contrast of the spiral arms , @xmath45 , is very loosely constrained by the 2mass data , in fact , even with the n@xmath173 grid which gives a separation of @xmath142 at @xmath174 , the enhancement of the counts in the tangential directions mentioned at the end of section 2.3 are hardly seen .",
    "clearly , higher resolution is needed to characterize this component .",
    "a similar conclusion was reached by @xcite .",
    "we find indications that @xmath45 is of the order of unity , roughly consistent with previous estimates from @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the inclusion of a bar in the modeling of the data sampled with the n@xmath173 healpix scheme definitely improves the quality of the resulting fits , even though the limit of k@xmath175 and the spacing of @xmath176 and @xmath177 not being the best to constrain that feature .",
    "we find that the bar has a half length of @xmath178 kpc , with axes ratios 1.00:0.22:0.39 .",
    "the angle @xmath54 is close to the lower limit of the values found in the literature , @xmath179 @xcite .",
    "the contrast of the bar with the ambient disks , @xmath51 , is @xmath180 .",
    "we did not find previous estimates of the latter quantity in the literature .",
    "figures [ fig7 ] , [ fig8 ] and [ fig9 ] show cumulative histograms of star counts in nine sets of @xmath181 in jhk@xmath0 , respectively .",
    "we see that the largest differences happen close to the galactic plane , specially for @xmath182 and @xmath183 .",
    "one can easily see the effects of the proximity to the small magellanic cloud in the line - of - sight corresponding to @xmath184 for magnitudes fainter than @xmath185 .",
    "figure [ fig10 ] shows similar histograms for @xmath186 .",
    "here we see that the limit magnitudes go all the way to the depth of the 2mass catalog .",
    "counts along the galactic plane , or intercepting the same , use to be a _ tour de force _ for star counts models .",
    "figure [ fig11 ] shows the comparison between observations and model for 64 lines - of - sight in the galactic plane , with and without the adoption of the density profile for the young disk given by equation [ densjacques ] .",
    "the limit magnitude is 11 in the @xmath164 band . for comparison , we also show the predicted counts from the besanon model @xcite , obtained from the online form . since the only parameter which can be varied by the user in the online form is the extinction ,",
    "we show the fit which provides the best description close to the galactic center .",
    "figure [ fig12 ] shows the observed and predicted counts along galactic latitude for @xmath187 .",
    "the largest differences are confined to the region close to the galactic plane .",
    "again , for comparison , we show the predicted counts from the besanon model . comparing our counts to those from the besanon model",
    ", one can see that our fit is slightly better .",
    "an all sky map of the relative differences between observed and predicted counts produces a comprehensive view of the merits and limitations of a model .",
    "fig.[fig13](c ) shows as a figure of merit the ratio @xmath188 obtained from the cumulative histograms up to magnitude 11 .",
    "this is not very different but a little more intuitive than the figure of merit @xmath189 used by @xcite . for reference , both the observed and model counts are presented in figs.[fig13](a ) and [ fig13](b ) , respectively . as we can see in fig.[fig13](c ) , the largest differences between observed and predicted counts are concentrated in the galactic plane .",
    "this is a limitation shared by all models in the literature .",
    "our fig.[fig13](c ) resembles figure 2 of @xcite , both presenting the differences between observations and model predictions .",
    "although the model of @xcite includes a description of a warp , not present in our model , the o - c differences are smaller in our case .",
    "the main differences between our map and that one from @xcite are the locations where the galactic model does not coincide with observations .",
    "the excess of observed stars counts which they attribute to the warp is present in the outer galaxy , while the largest excesses observed by us are close to @xmath182 and @xmath183 .",
    "fig.[fig14 ] shows an all sky map of @xmath189 for a more direct comparison with the result obtained by @xcite .",
    "our description is better both at the center and anti - center regions .",
    "we have used the 2mass data to test a modified version of the model due to ol93 in the jhk@xmath18 bands .",
    "we emphasize that this study is the first attempt to determine the main parameters describing the milky way using the observed star counts in the whole sky , including the galactic plane .",
    "a survey of the parameter space was done using the markov chain monte carlo method , followed by attempts to better constrain the parameters via the nested sampling algorithm .",
    "a grid with 192 points generated by the healpix scheme was adopted as a baseline for sampling and provided good initial estimates for @xmath163 , @xmath159 , @xmath160 , @xmath145 , @xmath39 and @xmath34 .",
    "since we expected poor results from the coarse grid considering that regions close to the galactic center and galactic plane show large gradients in star counts , finer grids were built to better sample those regions .",
    "in general , our results show a good agreement with the values of @xmath163 , @xmath162 , @xmath160 , @xmath145 , @xmath39 and @xmath34 found in the literature .",
    "we find that the  hole in the disk \" ( @xmath99 radial component ) shows a strong anti - correlation with @xmath190 .",
    "the value of @xmath191 found in this study describes the cusp in star counts close to the galactic center and this is the reason why it differs in scale from determinations of size for the spheroidal component found in the literature which describe larger scales .",
    "we find a moderate anti - correlation between the oblateness of the spheroid , @xmath34 , and the constant of normalization , @xmath39 .",
    "this is important and may happen in other models too .",
    "one has to have in mind that both parameters should be optimized simultaneously .",
    "there is also a definite anti - correlation between @xmath160 and @xmath145 .",
    "these parameters , however , are very well defined , even with the use of a coarse grid .",
    "our model describes the star counts in 80% of the sky with an accuracy of better than 10% . in the remaining area ,",
    "a few dozen lines - of - sight ( out of 3072 ) show absolute residuals in excess of 20% .",
    "they are concentrated close to the plane ( @xmath192 8@xmath193 ) , specially around @xmath182 , @xmath183 and surrounding the galactic center .",
    "an overall view of the galaxy according to our work suggests that it can be described by two disks with radial scales slightly shorter than those found in the literature .",
    "only the thick disk needs a  hole \" in its inner part .",
    "the conspicuous concentration of sources in the direction of the galactic center can be described by a combination of contributions from the disks , from a spheroid with scale 400 pc , and from a bar that has aspect ratios 1.00:0.22:0.39 , and is seen at an angle of 12@xmath47 .",
