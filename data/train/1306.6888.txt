    "the star formation history of the universe is a fundamental observable to understand the assembly and evolution of galaxies , the production of ionizing radiation and the gas chemical enrichment . among the different ( indirect ) tracers of the star formation rate , two of particular relevance at high redshift are the measurement of the rest - frame uv luminosity density from galaxy surveys ( e.g.  @xcite ) , and the rate of long - duration gamma - ray bursts ( grbs)@xcite .    deep surveys with ground and space telescopes identified thousands of galaxies up to redshift @xmath14 , when the universe was just about @xmath15 myr old @xcite .",
    "however , converting luminosity density into a sfr depends upon stellar population properties , such as metallicity @xcite .",
    "in addition , dust obscuration is a severe problem for rest - frame u observations , especially at @xmath4 : the intrinsic luminosity density might be up to ten times larger than the observed one and is highly sensitive to dust correction estimates @xcite .",
    "moreover , surveys are flux limited , hence the derived luminosity density traces the star formation rate ( sfr ) only in galaxies above detection threshold ( @xmath16 ) . because the galaxy luminosity function ( lf ) evolves with redshift , the amount of missed star formation changes as well , likely becoming more severe at high @xmath10 , and is difficult to quantify directly @xcite",
    ".    long - duration grbs ( @xmath17s ) are instead detectable at cosmological distances @xcite and trace the sfr as well , since they are generally associated to the collapse of massive stars @xcite .",
    "however , the number of events is much smaller compared to that of high-@xmath10 galaxies , and more importantly there is likely a metallicity bias , related to a grb production mechanism dependent on progenitor properties @xcite , for example because of reduced mass - loss rates in massive , low - metallicity stars @xcite .",
    "the presence of such bias is supported by observations of a majority of low - metallicity hosts ( e.g. , @xcite ) , although multiple cases of super - solar grb hosts exist @xcite .",
    "a further complication arises from understanding biases that dust obscuration ( metallicity and redshift dependent ) may introduce into the grb rate ( @xmath18 ) inference because of dark bursts @xcite .",
    "given the complementary strenghts and weakenesses of both approaches , past investigations tried to connect them by typically assuming a relation : @xmath19 where @xmath5 is the efficiency of grb production per unit stellar mass , empirically assumed to have form : @xmath20 with @xmath21 calibrated at @xmath4 and then extrapolated at higher redshift @xcite .",
    "the challenges with this empirical modeling are twofolds .",
    "first , the grb rate depends physically on the _ total _ sfr ( @xmath22 ) , not on @xmath16 ( derived from flux - limited galaxy surveys ) as used in equation  [ eq : grb_rate ] , because the grb afterglow is much brighter than its host and thus can be detected independently of host luminosity .",
    "hence , one should have @xmath23 .",
    "second , without a physical model to link grb and star formation , there is no guarantee that equation  [ eq : varepsilon ] holds beyond the redshift range of its calibration , raising concerns on systematic biases at @xmath24 .    here",
    ", we investigate the physical origin of the connection between grb and sfr through @xmath5 , and how this depends on metallicity of progenitors and on the difference between @xmath22 and @xmath16 .",
    "we resort to a simple , yet successful model for the evolution of the galaxy uv lf ( developed in @xcite ; ttc13 hereafter ) , which we complement with the mass - metallicity relation for host galaxies from @xcite and with a metallicity - dependent grb efficiency , inspired by stellar evolution simulations @xcite .",
    "the setup of our modeling is described in section  [ sec : model ] , results in section  [ sec : results ] , conclusions in section  [ sec : con ] . as in ttc13",
    ", we adopt a wmap5 cosmology : @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 @xcite .",
    "the base for our study is the model presented in ttc13 , which links star formation to dark - matter halo assembly through a mass - dependent efficiency on a timescale defined by the halo assembly time , adopting a continuous star formation history over this timescale .",
    "following @xcite , this is the time needed to grow the main progenitor from halo mass @xmath31 to @xmath32 .",
    "the key model feature is that the efficiency of star formation , @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the stellar mass , depends only on halo mass and is redshift independent ( see also  @xcite ) .",
    "since the halo assembly time is redshift dependent , the model naturally accounts for the redshift evolution of the rest - frame uv luminosity , computed using the single stellar population models of @xcite , at fixed halo mass ( assembly times become shorter at high-@xmath10 , thus halos are brighter ) .",
    "the model also includes treatment of dust extinction , which affects significantly the observed rest - frame uv luminosity of high-@xmath10 galaxies , implemented with an empirically calibrated formula following @xcite ( for comprehensive discussion see sec .  3.3 in ttc13 ) .",
    "given @xmath35 and the dm halo mass function ( from @xcite ) , the model thus fully describes the evolution of both the intrinsic galaxy lf , as well as that of the observed one ( with dust extinction ) .",
    "all details on the efficiency of converting baryons into stars are encapsulated into @xmath35 . to calibrate this relation , we resort , like in ttc13 , to abundance matching at @xmath36 : assuming that each dm halo hosts a single galaxy , we derive @xmath35 so that the model , dust - extinct , lf has a schechter form ( @xmath37 ) with parameters : @xmath38 ; @xmath39 and @xmath40 , where @xmath41 @xcite .",
    "note that ttc13 account for scatter in the luminosity to halo - mass relation , and for a burst of star formation at the halo assembly time as additional free - parameter to calibrate .",
    "both features only add modest improvements on the data - model comparison for the lf and star formation rates , so we neglect them here .",
    "our simplified model is still capable of an overall good description of the star formation rate evolution over the whole history of the universe ( fig .",
    "[ fig : rates ] , left panel ) , and allows us to explore the link to the production of grb events while minimizing the free parameters .",
    "compared to other recent investigations on the connection between grb production and sfr @xcite , our framework has the advantage of relying on a physical model for the galaxy lf , therefore allowing us to explore the effects of star formation below the observational limit of the deepest galaxies survey .",
    "this way , we can address what is the contribution to the grb production by dwarf - like galaxies at high-@xmath10 which are too faint for direct observations , with high complementarity to the recent modeling by @xcite at @xmath42 by means of reconstruction of the star formation history from sdss observations of local galaxies .",
    "in addition , to investigate whether and how much grb production is preferentially located in low - metallicity environments , we augment our model using the mass - metallicity relation of @xcite to assign galaxy metallicities . for this",
    ", we adopt their equation  2 with coefficients from table  5 ( for @xcite models ) and linear interpolation in redshift space .",
    "then , we resort to stellar evolution simulations by @xcite to construct a basic form for the metallicity - dependent efficiency of grb formation .",
    "the main limitation is that , because simulations of grb progenitors are computationally expensive , @xcite only explore a limited number of models , with coarse sampling of metallicity ( see their figs .",
    "3  and  6 ) .",
    "broadly , they conclude that very low metallicity progenitors ( @xmath43 ) are two - three times more likely to produce grbs compared to low metallicity ones ( @xmath44 ) , and that efficiency drops to @xmath45 for higher content of metals .",
    "the latter conclusion is however in tension with recent observations of grb hosts with @xmath46 @xcite , and might be related to the limited parameter space explored by the @xcite simulations .",
    "alternatively , channels for grb production which are different from the collapsar model and do not require low metallicity progenitors have been proposed , such as binary systems @xcite .",
    "therefore , we include in our metallicity - dependent efficiency a plateau of non - zero probability of forming grbs which is metallicity - independent , treating this as a free parameter to explore by comparison with the observed grb rate .",
    "the piece - wise linear functional form for our metal - dependent efficiency of grb production is : @xmath47 where @xmath48 and @xmath49 are free parameters ( normalization of the relation and efficiency plateau at @xmath50 ) , while @xmath51 and @xmath52 depend on @xmath53 as follows . for @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 ; for @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 ; for @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 ; for @xmath63 , @xmath55 , @xmath62 . fig",
    "[ fig : metallicity_dep ] shows @xmath64 for @xmath65 and @xmath66 ( our fiducial plateau value ) .    for a model with given threshold in minimum halo mass for star formation and given efficiency of forming grbs in high - metallicity environments ( parameter @xmath49 ) , we determine @xmath48 ( normalization of grb efficiency production ) by carrying out a least - square fit of our predicted grb rate by comparison with @xcite ( fig .  [",
    "fig : rates ] , right panel ) .",
    "we limit the fit to points at @xmath67 because of growing uncertainty in observations at higher redshift .",
    "our canonical model assumes that star formation proceeds down to halos with mass @xmath68 , approximately equivalent to virial temperatures @xmath69 , sufficient for cooling and forming stars even in presence of a uv background , albeit at very low efficiency @xcite .",
    "we predict that these halos host very faint galaxies with magnitude @xmath70 , depending on redshift .",
    "@xcite , but recently @xcite used gravitational lensing to probe the @xmath71 uv lf down to @xmath72 , demonstrating that it remains a steep power law , like in our model . ] for the efficiency of grb production with metallicity , we assume @xmath66 in equation  [ eq : metal_eff ] , so that we form a ( small ) fraction of grbs in high - metallicity environments .",
    "the results of the comparison of the model predictions to the data are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rates ] .",
    "the model ( black - dashed line ) captures well the evolution of the observed sfr @xmath16 ( data points from a variety of surveys , see fig .  2 in ttc13 for full details ) , derived from the luminosity density for galaxies with @xmath73 . at @xmath42 , integrating over the model lf to @xmath74 ( thus including faint galaxies ) , yields an approximately constant increase of the sfr by a factor @xmath75 ( red - solid line ) . at higher redshift",
    "there is a growing fraction of star formation in small mass , low luminosity halos , so that at @xmath76 only @xmath77 of all star formation is seen in current surveys ( see also @xcite for similar conclusions ) .",
    "the model prediction for the grb rate , which derives from the sfr for all galaxies , weighted by the metallicity preference for low-@xmath53 hosts , is shown as red - solid line in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : rates ] and describes the data well .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : psi ] we use these results to investigate our predictions for the relation @xmath5 between the sfr and grb rate ( equation  [ eq : grb_rate ] ) , empirically modeled as power law in redshift by past studies ( equation  [ eq : varepsilon ] ) .",
    "our model ( red - solid line ) predicts indeed an approximate power law with @xmath78 , as derived by @xcite , in the redshift range where the large majority of grbs are observed ( @xmath79 ) .",
    "we predict deviations from a power law both in the local universe and at very high @xmath10 , with our model staying above @xmath80 .",
    "to understand the physical origin of @xmath5 , we decompose the contribution to this quantity in metallicity effect ( green - dashed line ) and faint galaxies ( blue - dashed line ) .",
    "we see immediately that metallicity evolution is the main driver of @xmath5 at @xmath81 . at higher @xmath10 , though , most of the star formation happens in low - luminosity , small mass galaxies , where the mass - metallicity relation predicts low @xmath53 and near - maximal grb production per unit stellar mass .",
    "therefore , based on metallicity alone one would predict a flattening of @xmath5 at high @xmath10 .",
    "however , around the same redshift at which the metal - dependent efficiency of grb production saturates , the fraction of missed star formation in faint galaxies begins to increase steadily .",
    "this is the driver of the accelerated growth of @xmath5 at @xmath82 .",
    "finally , we note that at low redshift our model predicts a slight excess of grbs compared to the observed grb rate ( fig .",
    "[ fig : rates ] ) and to @xmath83 .",
    "while we stress that there is no physical reason because @xmath5 should be a power law , it is nevertheless possible that a more accurate parameterization of @xmath64 would give better agreement .",
    "overall , our canonical model provides a comprehensive description of the data both for @xmath16 and for @xmath18 . to further understand how unique / robust these predictions are , it is useful to compare them to those obtained by varying model parameters",
    "this is illustrated for @xmath18 in fig .",
    "[ fig : alt_models ] , for a range of different assumptions that all give by construction the same description of the _ observed _ sfr @xmath16 . fig .",
    "[ fig : alt_models ] , left panel , explores the effects of varying the metallicity - dependence in grb production .",
    "the blue line shows predictions for complete suppression of grbs in high metallicity progenitors ( @xmath84 ) , while the green line has no metallicity dependence ( @xmath85 ) .",
    "it is immediate to see that both scenarios represent a worse description of the data ( @xmath86 and @xmath87 respectively ) compared to the canonical model ( red , @xmath88 ) , with systematic deviations which introduce autocorrelation in the residuals at low and high redshift ( going into opposite directions ) .",
    "the right panel illustrates the same three models , but here we assume that there is no star formation in galaxies with @xmath89 ( this means @xmath90 ) .",
    "scenarios with both extreme and no metallicity dependence are similarly disfavored ( @xmath91 and @xmath92 respectively ) .",
    "interestingly the current data from @xmath18 alone do nt rule out that grbs originate from star formation sites with @xmath93 ( @xmath94 ) .",
    "in fact , at @xmath81 the models with and without faint galaxies are essentially yielding the same predictions , just with a different @xmath48 normalization . however , as we discussed in @xcite , searches for host - galaxies of grbs at high-@xmath10 are a powerful probe to investigate whether star formation is happening in low - luminosity galaxies . from the non - detection of @xmath95 grb host galaxies at @xmath11",
    ", we can confidently exclude this alternative scenario ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ) .",
    "we thus conclude that by combining all available observations , the best model is the one predicting a growing abundance of faint galaxies as the redshift increases , along with a moderate preference for grbs to form in low - metallicity environments ( @xmath96 ) . without duplicating the discussion of @xcite ,",
    "this strengthens the conclusion that the majority of the ionizing photons at @xmath97 are produced by galaxies currently too faint to be observed in ultradeep fields with the hubble space telescope ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "in this _ letter _ we investigated the relation between star formation and grb rate . for this , we resorted to a physical model which describes the galaxy lf evolution from @xmath0 to @xmath1 , augmented it with a mass - metallicity relation , and assumed a metallicity - dependent efficiency for grb production .",
    "we showed that we can construct a successful grb - rate model assuming that star formation continues down to galaxies with @xmath98 and that grbs are about four times more likely to originate in very low metallicity environments ( @xmath99 ) compared to @xmath46 . with this model we investigated the physical origin for the redshift evolution of the ratio between grb and sfr ( @xmath5 , equation  [ eq : varepsilon ] ) .",
    "we showed that the approximate @xmath80 behavior empirically derived by previous studies at @xmath100 is driven primarily by metallicity dependence .",
    "importantly , our model predicts a steepening of such relation at higher @xmath10 , because of a growing fraction of star formation happening in galaxies with @xmath89 during the epoch of reionization at @xmath82 .    our model can be used to derive an improved estimate of the total sfr at @xmath101 from grb events , compared to past investigations which rely on extrapolation of @xmath102 beyond @xmath101 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : rates ] ) . in this respect ,",
    "we note that we are obtaining a self - consistent description of both sfr and grb rate , as well as of the stellar mass density with redshift ( the latter is discussed in ttc13 , e.g. see their fig .  2 ) .",
    "in contrast , @xcite argue that the grb - inferred star formation rate is inconsistent with the stellar mass assembly .",
    "their result is likely due to the extrapolation for @xmath5 , which leads to an overestimate of the sfr inferred from grbs ( since their @xmath5 is underestimated at @xmath101 based on our conclusions ) .",
    "overall , we can conclude that there is no tension between using either the grb rate or the observed luminosity density from galaxy surveys as tracers of star formation , provided that the presence of faint galaxies below the current detection limits is taken into account .    of course",
    ", the uncertainties on the data , especially on the grb rate , are still large .",
    "thus , it is fundamental to identify additional independent tests of the framework we introduced .",
    "for example , @xcite assume that grb production has a hard cut - off at @xmath103 and obtain a good match to @xmath104 considering the star formation history at @xmath42 reconstructed from stellar archeology observations of galaxies in the local universe . at higher redshift ( @xmath105 ) , some grbs might have population iii progenitors forming in rare pockets of metal free gas , predicted theoretically @xcite , and recently observed @xcite .",
    "to better discriminate among all these different models , a promising approach would be to use our model to construct predictions for how the lf of grb hosts at @xmath106 differs from the one observed for lyman - break galaxies . with a growing sample of grb hosts being identified by nearly - complete follow - up surveys such as tough @xcite",
    "such comparison should be achievable in the near future .",
    "this will provide validation / refinement for our current treatment of the metallicity bias .",
    "in addition , ultradeep follow - up observations of host galaxies of grbs at @xmath82 have the potential to quantify the fraction of missed star formation in galaxy surveys such as the hubble ultradeep field @xcite , providing a highly complementary tool to investigate star formation during the epoch of reionization without waiting for next generation facilities such as the _ james webb space telescope_.    we thank raul jimenez , roberto maiolino , max pettini , and sandra savaglio for useful discussions .",
