    "organic supramolecular systems , such as molecular aggregates ,  @xcite photosynthetic complexes ,  @xcite and organic photovoltaic systems  @xcite , are currently of great interest due to their potential applications in nano - photonic and optoelectronic devices . in all these objects it is of fundamental importance to obtain a detailed understanding of the nature of excitations and the influence of environmental degrees of freedom on optical response and transport properties .",
    "the characteristic property of the above mentioned assemblies is that they are composed of closely spaced individual monomers which can exchange excitation energy via transfer dipole - dipole interactions . as a result",
    ", the eigenstates of the interacting monomers are coherently shared by many units . besides molecular systems , such a behavior can also be found in a variety of other physical objects , such as , for example , assemblies of ultra - cold rydberg atoms  @xcite , quantum dots  @xcite or superconducting circuits  @xcite . from now on , we will denote such systems as quantum aggregates and refer to the collective optical excitations as frenkel excitons .",
    "the interaction of the monomer units with the often disordered ( and sometimes fluctuating ) environment leads to local variations in the physical parameters describing each monomer .",
    "this leads to a localization of the frenkel excitons , which will no longer extend throughout the entire system but will be localized in smaller subparts of the system @xcite .",
    "the typical spatial extent of such an excitation in a disordered environment is referred to as the localization length  @xcite .    in modeling the behavior of the collective excitations in a disordered environment ,",
    "one often considers model parameters as stochastic quantities described by some probability distribution .",
    "when the environment changes slowly with respect to the processes within the system of interest , one can approximate the disorder induced by interactions with the host material as being static in time . in this work",
    ", we will consider the situation where static disorder influences primarily the transition energies of the monomers and does not lead to appreciable changes of the interaction between the monomers , and in particular does not lead to geometrical changes .",
    "@xcite this approach has been succesfully used to model , for example , the absorptive and emissive properties of various molecular aggregates at low temperatures .",
    "@xcite note that we do not consider the coupling of a dipole transition to the monomeric vibrations ( see e.g.  @xcite ) or inter - monomer dynamics @xcite .",
    "the localization of collective excitations has profound effects on experimentally accessible quantities related to the system under consideration , such as absorption , emission and excitation dynamics .",
    "the localized states tend to form around the bare exciton band edges , and in particular will also form a tail in the density of states , the so called lifshits tail  @xcite .",
    "the states in the lifshits tail play an important role in determining the optical and energy transport properties of the material .",
    "disorder in the transition energies of the monomers leads to a monomer absorption spectrum that follows the disorder probability distribution .",
    "the most common choices for the randomness of the monomer transition energies are box - like or gaussian distributions . for such disorder , the collective nature of the excitations in interacting aggregates of monomers",
    "is reflected in a reduced width of the exciton absorption peak with respect to the monomer peak , an effect which is referred to as exchange narrowing  @xcite .    however , it has been suggested that for certain environments more general distributions are needed @xcite .",
    "such distributions can lead to new effects  @xcite .",
    "indeed , when one generalizes to the wider class of lvy @xmath0-stable distributions ,  @xcite the behavior of the exciton states can be strikingly different .",
    "for example , the well - known effect of exchange narrowing need not occur , but for sufficiently heavy - tailed distributions a broadening effect can occur instead .",
    "@xcite    in this paper , we consider the symmetric lvy @xmath0-stable distributions as a generalization of the aforementioned gaussian distributions for the molecular transition energies , which includes gaussian as well as lorentzian distributions as special cases .",
    "such symmetric lvy stable distributions are determined by two parameters : the index of stability @xmath0 which fixes the general shape and the behavior for large arguments , and a scale parameter @xmath4 which determines the width of the distribution .",
    "the sum of two random variables which belong to distributions with the same @xmath0 will also belong to a distribution with the same @xmath0 .",
    "we will refer to these distributions as @xmath0-stable distributions , lvy - stable distributions or simply as stable distributions .    for @xmath5 and @xmath6 ,",
    "these distributions coincide with gaussian and lorentzian distributions respectively . for values of @xmath7 , these distributions will have more weight in the tails than gaussians . as a result , transition energies occuring in the tail are increasingly likely , and have a significant impact on the localization behavior of the exciton states and , in turn , also on the optical properties of the system .    in a first study  @xcite several of us",
    "have already investigated basic consequences of the heavy - tailed @xmath0-stable distributions .",
    "in particular it was shown that for @xmath8 exchange narrowing occurs , while for @xmath9 the spectrum broadens upon aggregation .",
    "in addition , indications were found that outliers , defined as transition energies which are larger than the effective interaction between the monomers , can lead to unexpected effects in the optical properties . here we will give a much more systematic discussion of the optical properties , and the closely related localization behavior , of one - dimensional aggregates with uncorrelated @xmath0-stable disorder .",
    "depending on the type of system one considers , their finite size of such systems may bear relevance to the optical properties .",
    "therefore , we discuss exciton localization and its optical consequences for a much wider range of parameters than was done in ref  @xcite ; that is , we scan over the parameter space provided by the stability index @xmath0 , the disorder strength @xmath4 and the system size @xmath10 .    the system is shown to provide a rich interplay between the various relevant length scales .",
    "the first length scale is simply provided by the standard localization length as induced by relatively small variations of the transition energies . the second length scale is the segment length , that is , the typical distance between neighboring outliers , which provides another mechanism of exciton localization . finally , the finite size of the system is the third length scale .",
    "depending on the relative magnitudes of these three length scales , various types of behavior may be identified , and we will show that the introduction of the finite system size as an additional length scale in the problem can be neatly incorporated into the theoretical description .    generally , three regimes can be identified .",
    "firstly , for small disorder strengths we essentially have fully delocalized exciton states , and we can provide analytical expressions for the absorption lineshape .",
    "secondly , for increasing amounts of disorder , the localization length drops below the system size . in this intermediate disorder regime",
    ", we will show that we can make scaling arguments for the dependence of localization length and the absorption peak width on the amount and type of disorder .",
    "finally , for very strong disorder we obtain strongly localized states that closely resemble the molecular excited states .",
    "the segmentation effect produced by outliers , as mentioned earlier , can provide additional features in the localization behavior and absorption spectra .",
    "in addition , we can predict for which parameters each regime is applicable , allowing for the construction of phase diagrams for localization behavior .    as mentioned before , lvy distributions ( for @xmath11 ) possess different characteristics from gaussians , including ( but not limited to ) an increased weight in the tails .",
    "however , in reality such environmentally induced fluctuations can not have arbitrarily large values . therefore ,",
    "in section [ sec : truncated ] we provide a study where we consider lvy distributions with truncated tails .",
    "we demonstrate that the same three regimes apply , for very similar parameter values .",
    "a notable caveat is that there is not a proper strong localization limit , since the width of the disorder distribution remains bounded as a result of the truncation .",
    "the removal of the tails does lead to a strong reduction in outliers and segmentation , and a corresponding lack of segmentation effects . in the absorption spectrum , this removes the absorption caused by relatively short segments that would otherwise occur at the high energy side of the absorption peak .",
    "nevertheless , this does not affect the scaling behavior of the peak width in the scaling regime .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : + in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] , we introduce the basic components of our theory .",
    "we introduce the model hamiltonian and some basic aspects of the eigenstates in sec . [",

    "[ sec : def_absorb ] , we discuss how to calculate the linear absorption spectrum , a quantity that can straightforwardly be compared to experimental measurements , and which reflects the delocalized nature of the excitations .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : analytical ] , we provide analytical estimates of how certain quantities depend on the type of disorder distribution used : in particular , we concern ourselves with the mean localization length , the distribution of localization lengths , the absorption spectra and their peak widths . first , as a useful reference case , we revisit the eigenstates and eigenenergies of the disorder - free frenkel exciton hamiltonian in sec .  [",
    "sec : hom ] .",
    "we use these eigenstates as a basis set in the general disordered case , as is done in sec .",
    "[ sec : analytical_estimates ] , where we discuss some analytical results .",
    "we can identify three regimes : the weak disorder limit , where states are strongly delocalized , is treated in sec .",
    "[ sec : weak_disorder ] , while we derive scaling relations for the dependence of the localization length on disorder in the intermediate disorder regime in sec .",
    "[ sec : scaling_intermediate_disorder ] . in the same section",
    ", we also discuss the third regime , where large disorder leads to strong localization effects .",
    "[ sec : outlier ] contains a discussion of the frequency of outliers and the typical length scales of the corresponding localization segments .",
    "finally , we show in sec .  [",
    "sec : summary ] that we can generally estimate which of the three regimes is applicable for a given combination of parameters , which can be summarized in a `` phase diagram '' .",
    "[ sec : numerics ] compares numerical results with the analysis presented in sec .",

    "[ sec : fwhmscaling ] , we analyze the dependence of the absorption peak width on disorder , and show again a good agreement with our previous analysis and the occurrence of three regimes . however , a few additional features appear in the numerical results : their origin is discussed in [ sec : scal_50 ] , where we also provide a discussion of the localization patterns of the wave functions , the so - called hidden structure .",
    "finally , we discuss the effect of truncating the tails of the @xmath0-stable distributions in sec .",
    "[ sec : truncated ] , which physically corresponds to limiting the maximum possible deviations of the transition energy .",
    "this alters some of the effects related to the outlier induced segmentation .",
    "we present a final overview in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "in this section , we introduce the basic ingredients of our model , which is essentially a frenkel exciton hamiltonian in one dimension .",
    "we discuss the @xmath0-stable distributions , which we will use as the disorder distributions for the site energies and provide their relevant mathematical properties .",
    "finally , we will describe how to calculate linear absorption spectra in excitonic systems , which is the prime experimentally observable quantity that can be used to probe these systems and study the effect of disorder .",
    "we consider a one - dimensional tight - binding hamiltonian consisting of @xmath10 sites . in the context of molecular aggregates ,",
    "each of the sites corresponds to an individual ( two - level ) molecule @xmath12 .",
    "we denote the state where molecule @xmath12 is in the excited state and all others are in their ground states by @xmath13 .",
    "the transfer interactions between sites @xmath12 and @xmath14 are denoted by @xmath15 where @xmath16 . taking the @xmath17 states as a basis for the one - excitation manifold , the hamiltonian takes the form @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the mean transition energy of the monomers and @xmath20 is a random , time independent offset energy .",
    "the presence of the latter term is e.g.   the result of interactions of the molecules with slowly fluctuating environmental factors , and is referred to as static disorder .    in many applications of the model ,",
    "the interaction can be of a long - range nature . in the context of molecular aggregates , for example , the molecules interact through their transition dipoles , e.g.  @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the distance between monomers @xmath12 and @xmath14 .",
    "however , we have found that the qualitative physical behavior of collective excitations for such longer - range interactions is very similar to the situation for nearest - neighbor interactions . for excitation transport",
    ", this similarity between long - range and nearest - neighbor interaction has been reported in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we limit ourselves in this work to nearest - neighbor interactions , since this allows for simple analytical results .",
    "then , the hamiltonian ( [ ham_ex ] ) becomes @xmath23 where @xmath24 denotes the nearest neighbor interaction .",
    "the exciton states @xmath25 are simply the eigenstates of the above hamiltonian , and can generally be written as a coherent superposition of local excitations @xmath26 in the case of no disorder ( @xmath27 ) , the exciton states will extend over all sites @xmath12 .",
    "this is discussed in more detail in sec .  [",
    "sec : hom ] .",
    "however , when disorder is present , localization can occur , leading to exciton states that are coherently shared by only part of the chain s sites .",
    "the localization length is the typical extent of such an exciton state , i.e.  a measure of the number of molecules contributing to an exciton state @xmath25 , and can be quantified in various ways . in the following , as is often done to quantify the localization length ,  @xcite we will use the _ inverse participation number _ , defined as @xmath28 one can straightforwardly check the correct behavior of this expression in the limits of a completely localized state ( @xmath29 ) and a state shared equally by all molecules ( @xmath30 ) , where it gives @xmath31 and @xmath32 respectively .",
    "while the inverse participation number is a reasonable measure for the localization length , one should keep in mind that there are different ways of quantifying localization and that there remains a certain arbitrariness as to what measure is used .",
    "it is assumed that for each monomer the fluctuations @xmath20 are random variables distributed according to some probability distribution @xmath33 .",
    "the @xmath20 are taken to be independent and identically distributed .    in this work",
    "we will focus on symmetric , @xmath0-stable probability densities @xmath33 defined by @xmath34 where the characteristic function @xmath35 is given by @xmath36 with two parameters , the _ index of stability _ @xmath3 and the _ scale parameter _ @xmath37 .",
    "note that the above is a rather general class of distributions .",
    "examples of the distributions defined by eq .",

    "( [ fourier ] ) and ( [ def : stable_char ] ) have no simple representations in terms of elementary functions @xcite .",
    "however , several well - known distributions are special cases of the @xmath0-stable distributions . in particular , for @xmath38 we simply recover a gaussian distribution with zero mean and standard deviation @xmath43 .",
    "note that this notation differs from the usual convention where @xmath4 is used to denote the standard deviation .",
    "similarly , for @xmath44 , the probability density @xmath45 corresponds to a lorentzian ( cauchy ) distribution @xmath46 . in section [ sec : numerics ] we will present numerical results for the cases of @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 , as typical representations of @xmath3-stable distributions . for the latter value of @xmath49 , there also exists an analytic expression of @xmath50 in terms of fresnel integrals and trigonometric functions @xcite .",
    "for @xmath51 the tails of the distributions behave like @xmath52 for large values of @xmath20 ( cf .",
    "insets of fig .  [ dist_examples ] ) ,",
    "i.e.  they have heavy tails .",
    "that implies that for @xmath51 the second moment diverges , and the standard deviation can thus not be used as a measure of the width of the distribution .",
    "therefore , we will instead use the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) , denoted by @xmath53 , to characterize the width [ one could also use a different quantity as a measurement of the width of a probability distribution , e.g.  for lvy - stable distributions the scale parameter @xmath37 .",
    "we choose the fwhm since it is a property of the probability distribution that can be easily extracted .",
    "furthermore we will also use the fwhm to measure the width of the absorption spectra ( see sec .",

    "one finds that @xmath58 belongs to the same stable distribution , but with a scale parameter of @xmath59 .",

    "* _ generalized central limit theorem ( clt ) : _   + lvy - stable distributions with @xmath2 do not have a finite variance and therefore do not obey the standard clt .",
    "however there exists a similar theorem for heavy - tailed distributions @xcite . in short ,",
    "it states that if @xmath69 are independent , identically distributed random numbers with a probability distribution that decays like @xmath70 for @xmath71 with @xmath72 , then the probability distribution @xmath73 of the sample mean @xmath74 will converge to an @xmath3-stable distribution , @xmath75 , with @xmath76 .",
    "an interesting property of molecular aggregates is the fact that they exhibit optical properties that are markedly different from those of the individual molecules they consist of .",
    "the collective nature of the relevant excitations leads to superradiant absorption and emission , a shift in the peak position and a change in the line - shape  @xcite .",
    "in this subsection , we will discuss how to evaluate the linear absorption spectra of an aggregate , and provide analytical results and estimates for some special conditions .",

    "we will focus on the basic effects of the disorder in the transition energies and not on geometrical effects .",

    "here it is assumed that the dynamic broadening of the individual exciton transitions is negligible , which holds at low temperature  @xcite .",
    "note that the absorption spectrum of @xmath10 uncoupled monomers is simply proportional to the bare disorder probability density , @xmath89 .    as in the case of the probability distributions",
    "@xmath90 , we will use the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) as a measure for the width of the absorption spectrum .",

    "the absorption spectrum is trivial in this case , as the close resemblance of the exciton wave functions to the molecular wave functions leads to an exciton absorption peak which is essentially identical to the monomer absorption peak or equivalently the disorder distribution itself .    as mentioned before , there are additional features present in the dependence of the fwhm on the disorder strength .",

    ". a close look at the peak positions and peak heights at the disorder values where the bump occurs , confirms that for @xmath5 and @xmath6 this deviation from our theoretical estimates is caused by a shoulder in the absorption peak , caused by the @xmath278 transition . the additional width provided by absorption into this state , which has not been accounted for in the absorption peak width estimate in sec .",
    "[ sec : scaling_intermediate_disorder ] , causes this feature .",
    "this explanation can be confirmed by the fact that it allows for an estimate for the disorder values for which we expect the bump to occur .",
    "this is for @xmath95 values where the energy gap between the @xmath278 and @xmath103 state , which can be calculated using eq .",
    "( [ eq : eige ] ) , is equal to the analytically obtainable peak width @xmath130 ( eq .  ( [ perturb_breite ] ) ) .",
    "this yields estimates of the bump position of @xmath279 for @xmath5 and @xmath280 for @xmath6 , in good agreement with the numerically obtained bump positions of respectively @xmath281 and @xmath282 .",

    "( [ eq : eige ] ) ) is approximately depending on @xmath10 by @xmath283 .",
    "as the chain length increases the energy gap becomes smaller and a smaller @xmath95 is sufficient for the @xmath103 and @xmath278 peak to overlap .",

    "again , the bump is observed to originate from additional peaks growing into the main absorption peak .",
    "however , for smaller @xmath0-values , such as @xmath277 , these additional peaks correspond to absorption into @xmath273-like states located on short ( outlier - induced ) segments instead .",
    "since the absorption for shorter segments occurs at higher energies , this leads to a shoulder on the high energy side and a corresponding asymmetry in the absorption lineshape . for increasing chain length",
    "@xmath10 the bump appears for smaller values @xmath95 .",
    "this can be explained by looking at the probability of finding segmented chains .",
    "the probability @xmath284 to have at least one outlier in a chain of length @xmath10 is determined by @xmath285 with @xmath196 being the probability for an outlier on a single site , defined by eq .",

    "this last relation can be understood as follows .",
    "the bump is caused by side peaks on the high - energy side of the main peak due to a significant amount of segmented chain ( numerically we find roughly @xmath288 of segmented chains at the maximum of the bump ) . for large chain length",
    "@xmath10 a smaller value of @xmath95 will lead to the same amount of segmented chains , as a larger value @xmath95 does for shorter chain length .",
    "this explains the @xmath10-dependency of the bump .    for small @xmath0-values and larger disorder strengths , another additional feature",
    "is observed : a zigzag feature on top of the expected scaling behavior .",
    "the origin is , in fact , similar to the origin of the bump explained in the previous paragraphs . with increasing disorder strength , the number of outliers increases and thus an increasing amount of segmentation occurs .",
    "this leads to short segments , which in turn support @xmath273-like states that can be at significantly higher energies than the main peak .",
    "it is easily established at what energies absorption takes place for shorter homogeneous segments ; for example , for a segment of length @xmath289 we expect a peak at energy @xmath290 . for sufficiently heavy - tailed disorder distributions ,",
    "these short segments occur frequently enough to lead to resolvable absorption peaks at the aforementioned energies .",
    "the zigzag structure is then nothing more than absorption peaks from shorter segments growing into the main absorption peak .",
    "the above zigzag structure is already visible for @xmath277 ( see right panel of fig .  [",
    "fig : scal_05 ] ) , but is not overly pronounced .",
    "a similar analysis for a smaller value of @xmath0 shows the aforementioned effects even more clearly .",

    "[ fig : alpha03 ] shows the disorder dependence of the peak width , while the lower panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : alpha03 ] show absorption spectra for two disorder values @xmath91 , all for @xmath276 .",
    "the zigzag features are very clearly visible in the fwhm scaling curve .",
    "in addition , one clearly observes a series of peaks on the high energy side of the main absorption peak .",
    "it is easily confirmed that the energies of this series of peaks exactly match up with the absorption peaks of different segment lengths .",
    "in addition , the absorption spectrum shown in then lower right panel of fig .  [ fig : alpha03],that is in the zigzag regime , confirms that the additional absorption peaks are growing into the main peak .",
    "finally , it should be noticed that the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : alpha03 ] shows that the zigzag feature repeats over increasingly broader disorder intervals .",
    "this corresponds to the fact that the energy differences between a chain of length @xmath237 and length @xmath291 increase strongly when @xmath237 gets smaller . for smaller disorder values ,",
    "the peak width decreases in this zigzag fashion by scooping up energetically close absorption peaks of long segments , but for larger disorder values the peak width needs to grow over increasingly large distances to encounter another absorption peak that can grow into the main peak .",
    "the lvy - stable distributions can possess a high probability for the occurrence of arbitrarily large fluctuations .",
    "however , in a real physical system energy fluctuations can not be arbitrarily large .",
    "therefore , it is an important question to what extent the results derived in the previous sections ( e.g.  scaling laws , sawtooth structure etc . )",
    "is a result of the heavy tails , and which depend on the central shape of the stable distributions .    in this section",
    "we will briefly discuss lvy - stable distribution with truncated tails .",

    "the normalization factor is given by @xmath294 .",
    "we now refer to @xmath37 as the scale parameter of the underlying lvy - stable distribution .",
    "the fwhm @xmath91 does in general not have a simple relation to the scale parameter @xmath37 as before .",

    "therefore a sum of truncated lvy distributed random variables @xmath20 ( e.g.  the @xmath110 in eq .",

    "the crossed solid lines are the scalings for lvy - stable disorder and the dashed line is the scaling for the truncated lvy - disorder .",
    "first we compare the three different regimes that we find for the lvy stable disorder ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : summary ] ) . for all chain length",
    "@xmath10 the weak disorder limit is the same for the truncated and non - truncated disorder . comparing the truncated disorder distributions with the non - truncated one they are almost indistinguishable as @xmath319 .",
    "this means that the chosen random variables are almost the same for the two types of disorder and therefore lead to the same spectrum .",
    "the value of the exponent of the conventional scaling law ( eq .  ( [ eq : d_agg_intermediate_div_d_mon ] ) ) is also still valid for the truncated lvy - disorder .",
    "the difference between truncated and non - truncated distribution is only a constant pre - factor , i.e.  a constant offset on a double logarithmic scale .",
    "this pre - factor will be explained below .    for the chosen truncation parameter @xmath320 , there is no strong disorder limit as for the non - truncated case .",
    "the curve of the scaling law stops at @xmath321 , since the fwhm @xmath91 for the truncated lvy disorder distribution can not exceed the interval @xmath296 $ ] .",
    "one finds in addition that for @xmath322 the scaling of the truncated @xmath210 ( dashed line in top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : alpha03 ] ) does not have the analytically estimated exponent of the conventional law eq .",
    "( [ eq : d_agg_intermediate_div_d_mon ] ) but follows approximately @xmath323 . this change of the scaling is mainly due to the validity of the clt ( see sec .  [",
    "sec : clt ] ) .",
    "the value of @xmath324 and the localization of the underlying wavefunctions are such that @xmath110 ( eq .  ( [ delta_nunu ] ) ) can no longer be approximated by a lvy - stable random number of the same index of stability , but is rather gaussian distributed .",
    "the observed scaling @xmath325 indicates that the width of the resulting absorption spectra is independent of @xmath95 .",
    "this @xmath325 scaling is observed for all @xmath3 and the individual scaling laws for the different @xmath3 collapse eventually onto one line ( not shown ) .",
    "the universality of this scaling with respect to the index of stability can be understood , considering that the truncated distribution @xmath300 converges to an uniform distribution within the inverval @xmath296 $ ] in the limit of @xmath326 independently of @xmath3 .",
    "[ fig : alpha03 ] not only shows the scaling of @xmath210 ( upper panel ) but also two absorption spectra ( lower panels ) .",
    "first we will discuss the outlier induced features on the scaling laws , before looking at individual absorption spectra .    comparing the features originating from outliers , namely the bump at the transition from the weak disorder regime to the conventional scaling regime and the zigzag structure on top of the conventional scaling",
    ", one clearly sees in the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : alpha03 ] , that they have almost vanished for the truncated lvy - disorder .",
    "while the zigzag structure has completely disappeared for all chain length @xmath10 , the disappearance of the bump shows a @xmath10 dependence . for @xmath220 the bump has completely disappeared , for @xmath221 however it is only reduced in height . changing the parameter @xmath172 to smaller values ( not shown ) ,",
    "the height of this bump is further reduced until vanishing completely .",
    "this @xmath10 dependence can be explained by taking the occurrence of two consecutive outliers with opposite signs into account .",
    "these two outliers create an energy gap of twice the size , compared to just a single outlier . for the non - truncated lvy - stable disorder it does not matter if one or two consecutive outliers segment the chain , since the actual size of the energy gap does not matter if sufficiently large .",
    "state can be found but also states with @xmath223 are clearly localized on this segment .",
    "those @xmath223 states however do not significantly contribute the absorption spectrum .",
    "] for the truncated lvy - disorder their are in principle no single outliers segmenting the chain , but their can be two consecutive large enough fluctuations with opposite sign creating a large enough gap to actually segment the chain .",
    "the probability of finding at least one pair of these consecutive large fluctuations is larger the longer the chain becomes , but still smaller than finding a single large fluctuation .",
    "therefor the bump at the onset still remains as long as the truncation is at sufficient large values , but is reduced in height .",
    "we have shown that the outlier induced features of the scaling of @xmath210 vanish for truncated disorder .",
    "the disappearance of outliers and the resulting segmentation can also be seen in the absorption spectra , where each segment can be seen as a small , but distinct peak .",
    "looking at individual absorption spectra explains the offset between the truncated scaling and the non - truncated scaling in the conventional scaling regime ( upper panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : alpha03 ] ) .",
    "the lower panels in figures [ fig : alpha03 ] show absorption spectra for non - truncated ( red line ) and truncated ( blue line ) disorder .",
    "one immediately notices that the truncated absorption spectrum is narrower than the non - truncated absorption spectrum and the sharp peaks at high energies are missing .",
    "these sharp high - energy peaks can be clearly assigned to segments with reduced length @xmath327 as indicated by the arrows .",
    "the sum of all these peaks form a broad shoulder on the high energy side of the main absorption peak , explaining the offset of the scaling @xmath210 of the non - truncated disorder in fig .",
    "[ fig : alpha03 ] , compared to the truncated disorder .",
    "the truncated absorption spectrum also has peaks at the high - energy side .",
    "these peaks can be assigned to states with @xmath328 , @xmath329 and @xmath330 for a @xmath258 aggregate ( eq .  ( [ eq : eige ] ) ) , as indicated by the arrows .",
    "the appearance of peaks with ( @xmath331 ) have already been discussed for @xmath47 and @xmath48 in sec .",
    "[ sec : kink_jigsaw ] . from fig .",
    "[ fig : alpha03 ] one can see that the absorption spectra for truncated disorder show similar behavior as the absorption spectra of @xmath47 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : spec_wav_con_disorder_2 ] ) or @xmath48 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : spec_wav_con_disorder_1 ] ) , where outliers do not play a significant role .    we have demonstrated that by truncating the lvy - stable distributions at @xmath320 ( eq .  ( [ eq : trunc_levy ] ) ) the signatures of outliers almost completely vanish .",
    "the sawtooth - shaped structure on top of the conventional scaling has completely disappeared and the bump at the transition from the weak disorder regime to conventional scaling regime is significantly reduced in height .",
    "the changes in these two features can be traced back to the strongly reduced likelihood of outliers .",
    "since outliers do almost not occur , the aggregate is very unlikely to split into segments , where short segments would then give rise to additional peaks in the absorption spectrum .",
    "we have provided an in - depth analysis of the effects of static ( diagonal ) disorder on the localization and absorption properties of excitonic systems , where we have generalized from the commonly considered gaussian distributions to the wider class of lvy stable distributions .",
    "this generalization , allowing for heavy - tailed distributions , shows a rich palette of novel effects and regimes , owing to the interplay of various length scales .",
    "we provide a comprehensive study of the localization behavior and its optical implications throughout the entire parameter regime .",
    "there are three relevant length scales .",
    "first of all there is the length of the aggregate @xmath10 .",
    "the second length scale is related to the occurrence of outliers , i.e. sites with transition energies in the tail of the distribution and which as a result couple only weakly to other molecules .",
    "outliers effectively lead to a subdivision of the system into weakly coupled segments .",
    "the mean segment length @xmath237 is the relevant length scale here .",
    "the disorder also leads to anderson localization , and lvy stable disorder distributions likewise imply localized states , in particular at the optically relevant bottom of the band .",
    "the typical localization length @xmath158 at the bottom of the exciton band provides the third length scale .",
    "it should be noted that both the segments and the anderson localization lengths are described by broad distributions , leading to a non - trivial interplay of both these effects over a broad region in parameter space .",
    "the fact that the optical response for @xmath211-aggregates is dominated by the states at the lower exciton band edge suggests that we primarily focus on the localization properties of those states .",
    "several distinct regimes can be distinguished , depending on the relative magnitude of the above three length scales .",
    "first of all , one can identify a weak disorder regime ( small @xmath95 ) .",
    "this implies a long localization length , so that the finite size of the system is a limiting factor for the spatial extent of the exciton states . in addition , for smaller values of @xmath0 , outliers are still likely to occur and thereby creating segments . in that case , it is the segment length that determines the coherent spread of the excitons . in this regime ,",
    "the eigenstates strongly resemble the homogeneous solutions of a chain of length @xmath237 or length @xmath10 .",
    "the absorption is thus dominated by the superradiant @xmath273-like states of the various segments , which occur at @xmath332 for long segments and chains , and at somewhat higher energies for shorter segments .",
    "the absorption peak width exhibits the well known exchange narrowing by a factor of @xmath333 for gaussian disorder . in general",
    "we find that the absorption peak width is scaled by a @xmath334 , which leads to a narrowing for @xmath335 and to a broadening for @xmath336 .",
    "these analytical predictions are confirmed numerically , where both the wave function shapes as well as the absorption peak width agree extremely well with the theoretical forecasts .    for larger values of the disorder strength",
    ", the localization length drops below the chain length , and we can obtain analytical expressions for the scaling behavior of both the mean localization length and the absorption peak width with disorder .",
    "numerically , both these scaling relations are reproduced quite well , with an excellent agreement with regards to the exponent but some arbitrariness remaining in the prefactor .",
    "in addition , and most prominently for smaller values of @xmath0 , additional structures appear superimposed on the numerically calculated localization length distributions and on the scaling of the absorption peak width .",
    "the localization length distributions for small @xmath0 show an additional series of peaks , which can straightforwardly be identified with excitons localized on ( very ) short segments . likewise , a bump at relatively small disorder strengths and a zigzag structure for larger disorder strengths and small stability index @xmath0 can be observed .",
    "we have shown that all these are related to additional peaks growing into the main absorption peak , with the zigzag structure being yet another clear indicator of the occurrence of segments .",
    "at large disorder values , one eventually approaches the regime where all exciton states are strongly localized , with a localization length tending to 1 .",
    "the exciton states will then strongly resemble the molecular excited states , and the absorption peak width will trivially approach the monomer absorption peak width - which is confirmed numerically as well .",
    "one manifestation of the shape of lvy stable distributions is the increased amount of weight in the tails for decreasing @xmath0 ; however , since arbitrarily large fluctuations ( i.e. arbitrarily long tails ) may not be physical , we have also analyzed the behavior for lvy stable distributions with small @xmath0 with the tails removed .",
    "a truncation of the tail at the exciton band edges , i.e.  at twice the nearest neighbor interaction , shows that the same regimes apply as before , set in at very similar parameter values , and show the same scaling exponents .",
    "however , segmentation becomes much more rare , and as a consequence the direct signatures of segmentation that were observed before diminish considerably or vanish completely .",
    "this includes the absence of short segment peaks in both the localization length distributions and absorption spectra , and the resultant disappearance of the zigzag structure and a strong reduction in the bump in the absorption peak width curves .",
    "in addition , while the scaling exponent remains the same , the absorption peaks are more narrow , due to the absence of shorter segment contribution that tend to occur on the high energy side of the absorption peak .",
    "we will briefly describe the numerical implementation of the lvy - disordered aggregate and our method to extract the fwhm of noisy data .",
