    "the currently preferred model for our universe , the @xmath2 cold dark matter ( @xmath2cdm ) model , is in very good agreement with a range of observational probes , such as the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropies , the large scale structure ( lss ) , the scale of the baryonic acoustic oscillation ( bao ) in the matter power spectrum and the luminosity distance of the supernovae type ia ( snia ) .",
    "in particular , the latter probe has identified the accelerated expansion of the universe @xcite .",
    "this apparently counter - intuitive behavior of the universe is ascribed to a currently unknown component , dubbed dark energy ( de ) , which is dominant over the matter content and exhibits a negative pressure .",
    "very little is known about this negative pressure component , but the simplest candidate for it is the cosmological constant : a constant energy density with a negative equation of state parameter ( eos , i.e. the ratio between the pressure of a component and its energy density ) , @xmath3 .",
    "although it is in accordance with all the existing cosmological observables , it has known theoretical problems , such as the _ `` why now ? '' _ and the _ `` fine tuning '' _ problem . for these reasons ,",
    "many other theoretical explanations for the de have been proposed in which the eos parameter evolves with time , although there is currently no firm observational evidence for such time evolution .",
    "lacking of an a - priori knowledge of the physical nature of the de , a phenomenological parameterization in which the eos evolves with time , such as the chevallier - polarski - linder ( cpl ) @xcite parameterization , is often used to get model independent constraints on the ( possible ) evolution of the eos parameter . in this case , the eos parameter can be written as @xmath4 if the eos parameter varies with time , there should be a detectable departure from the evolution of the expansion rate @xmath5 relative to the simpler @xmath2cdm model , in which the eos parameter is constant and equal to @xmath6 for all the times .",
    "indeed , in the latter case the expansion rate of the universe @xmath5 , which evolves according to the friedman equations , can be written as : @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the matter and the cosmological constant energy density . in the cpl parametrization",
    "it becomes @xmath10    if one wants to constrain a possibly evolving dark energy eos without _ a priori _ assumptions on an underlying model , it is crucial to measure the expansion rate at many different redshifts . among the known probes of the expansion rate ,",
    "the cmb probes the expansion rate at redshift @xmath11 , while for much lower redshifts we could rely on weak lensing and bao probes , and most noticeably on the snia luminosity distance measurements . a potentially powerful new way of constraining the expansion history in the low - intermediate redshifts regime , up to @xmath12 could come in the next decade from the active galactic nuclei ( agn ) distance measurements @xcite , athough their reliability remains to be demonstrated .    in this paper we want to explore the constraining power on the dark energy eos of a next - generation probe of the expansion history at intermediate redshifts , based on redshift - drift measurements @xcite . in this paper",
    "we will refer to this probe as _ sandage - loeb _ test ( sl ) as first proposed by the authors of ref .",
    "the sl is a direct measurement of the temporal drift of distant sources redshift ( @xmath13 ) due to the expansion of the universe and , as first pointed out in @xcite , it has some important cosmological advantages as it is a direct probe of the evolution of the universe , using relatively simple and well - understood physics to probe an otherwise inaccessible redshift range without any underlying theoretical assumptions ( other than large - scale homogeneity and isotropy ) .",
    "a useful overview of sl properties can be found also in @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sl ] we will revisit the theory behind the sl test for the considered models ; in section [ cod ] we will summarize the observational requirements for the sl test ; in section [ am ] we will describe the analysis method and the datasets we use in the present work ; in section [ res ] we show our results and finally in section [ concl ] we derive our conclusions .",
    "the possibility of directly measuring the variation of the redshift of distant sources due to the expansion of the universe was firstly conceived by allan sandage in 1962 @xcite , but observational capabilities at that time would have failed to detect the small signal with a time interval between observations smaller than 10@xmath14 years .",
    "then in 1998 , abraham loeb revisited the idea , and the conclusions of his studies were that , given the technological progress , it would have been possible to detect a drift of the redshift in the spectra of the ly@xmath15 forest of distant quasars ( qso ) in the following few decades @xcite .",
    "in what follows we will briefly revisit the theory behind the sandage - loeb test , following the treatment of ref .",
    "@xcite , and we propose some representative examples .    in a friedmann - robertson - walker expanding universe ,",
    "the radiation emitted by a source at time @xmath16 and observed at time @xmath17 undergoes a redshift @xmath18 which is connected to the expansion rate through the scale factor @xmath19 as @xmath20 if we now consider the radiation emitted by the same source at the time @xmath21 and observed at @xmath22 , the new redshift will be @xmath23 with an adequate time interval between observations we can measure the difference in the observed redshifts @xmath24 .",
    "this difference can be expressed , when @xmath25 , as @xcite @xmath26 but it is more conveniently expressed as a spectroscopic velocity shift through the relation @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the speed of light .",
    "+ therefore , using the first friedmann equation and setting @xmath29 , @xmath30 can be related to the matter content of the universe @xcite @xmath31,\\ ] ] where @xmath32 is the hubble constant and @xmath33 .    for the case of a flat @xmath2cdm universe , from eq .",
    "( [ hzlcdm ] ) , @xmath34 is @xmath35 simple algebra shows that the velocity differences are very small , typically corresponding to a few @xmath36 , even assuming a time interval @xmath37 years between the observations ( see for example fig.[fig : lambda ] ) .",
    "different dark energy models will clearly yield different @xmath30 signals @xcite . in this paper",
    "we use the chevallier - polarski - linder ( cpl ) parametrization @xcite as our toy model .",
    "as described above the time dependence of @xmath38 changes the evolution of the dark energy energy density with respect to the cosmological constant case @xmath39 where @xmath40 ; therefore , @xmath41 becomes @xmath42^{1/2}\\,.\\ ] ]",
    "the european extremely large telescope ( e - elt ) equipped with a high - resolution , ultra - stable spectrograph such as the cosmic dynamics experiment ( codex ) @xcite will have the ability to detect the cosmological redshift drift in the lyman @xmath15 absorption lines of distant ( 2 @xmath43 5 ) qsos . in this section",
    "we will briefly describe the underlying observational requirements .",
    "as pointed out by the authors of @xcite the accuracy in the determination of the tiny variation of the redshifts of the sources depends mostly on the signal - to - noise ( s / n ) ratio at which spectral features are detected , and in a photon - noise - limited experiment it depends , in turn , on ( i ) the size of the telescope ; ( ii ) the flux density of the sources ; ( iii ) the combined telescope / instrument efficiency and integration time .    the new generation of @xmath44 m elts will be able to collect the large number of photons needed to efficiently resolve these features in the spectra of the selected sources in scientifically worthy amount of integration time .",
    "concerning the second issue , loeb suggested @xcite as a promising target the lyman @xmath15 forest of distant qsos and more recently the authors of @xcite quantitatively determined the accuracy of the detection of the cosmological redshift drift in the high - redshift quasars absorption lines , including metal ones , in the era of the elts .",
    "they find that a 42-m elt could achieve the accuracy needed to detect the redshift variation with a 4000 hours of integration in a period of @xmath45 years @xcite .",
    "the most suitable source targets for the sl test have been identified with the ly@xmath15 forest of the distant qsos .",
    "the analysis of @xcite has identified the following requirements for the target sources :    1 .",
    "they should trace the hubble flow , and have small peculiar motions .",
    "2 .   they should have sharp spectral features .",
    "3 .   they should have a large number of usable features to maximize the amount of information per unit observing time .",
    "they should be as bright as possible .",
    "they should exist over a wide redshift range , but in particular , at high redshifts , where the signal is expected to be higher .",
    "the ly@xmath15 forest lines meet all the above requirements , but the second one , because the intergalactic absorbing gas between us and the distant qso is at a temperature of the order of 10@xmath46 k ( see e.g @xcite ) so that the absorption lines are not particularly sharp .",
    "therefore we can use these astrophysical sources to detect the sandage - loeb signal , but in order to detect tiny shifts of the spectral lines , high - resolution , extremely stable ( on timescales of tens of years ) spectrographs are required .    according to monte carlo simulations of ref .",
    "@xcite , codex has an error on the measured spectroscopic velocity shift @xmath30 that can be expressed as : @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the signal to noise ratio , @xmath49 the number of observed quasars , @xmath50 their redshift and the exponent @xmath51 is equal to @xmath52 when @xmath53 , while it becomes @xmath54 beyond that redshift . + in fig.[fig : lambda ] we can notice how using these specifications it is already possible to distinguish between different cosmological models .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",
    "in this paper we evaluated the constraining power of the sandage - loeb test on the phenomenological dynamic dark energy parameters @xmath0 and @xmath1 and on other expansion - related cosmological parameters , such as @xmath8 and @xmath32 .",
    "we explored both the possibility of a constant dark energy eos ( @xmath1 fixed to zero ) and a more general case where @xmath1 is free to vary .    in the first case we found 1-@xmath55 errors that are competitive with the ones obtained using forecasted data for a planck - like cmb experiment",
    "moreover , we highlighted how sandage - loeb observations alongside cmb data can break degeneracies between different parameters ; we obtained that the use of sandage - loeb probe can improve cmb results on @xmath0 , @xmath32 and @xmath8 by factors of @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 respectively .",
    "however , in the second case , where @xmath1 is a free parameter , we found that sandage - loeb is not able to remove the degeneracy between @xmath0 and @xmath1 and therefore it can not improve cmb constraints on these parameters ; nevertheless , significantly tighter constraints on @xmath32 and @xmath8 are again achieved .",
    "however we should point out that these results are obtained assuming the absence of systematic effects , which play a key role in the measurement of dark energy parameters .",
    "therefore a precise understanding of these will be necessary in order to obtain reliable predictions on future constraints .",
    "for some caveats on the effect of systematics on cosmological constraints see@xcite .",
    "nevertheless , we expect that a future detailed analysis of specific dark energy models should be able to show how sandage - loeb can be crucial in eventually ruling out these models , as many of them have specific characteristics leading to a discernible @xmath30 signal ( see e.g. @xcite ) in the redshift range of interest .",
