    "3 we show the seds of the sources responsible for the lensed arc and the north - west double source , with the luminosity scale corrected for the magnification in making these sed plots , instead of using galfit to remove the lens galaxy , we take advantage of the asymmetry of the lensed system and create residual images by subtracting a mirrored image from the original image .",

    "this hypothesis is supported by the fact that the bandpass in wfc3 begins at 1.4 @xmath89 m , while ukirt wfcam @xmath51-band filter used in ukidss has effectively a zero throughput at @xmath153 @xmath89 m and misses the [ oiii]emission lines .",

    "for each template we fit for stellar mass and intrinsic extinction to match the observed seds , assuming the extinction law of @xcite and parameterized by @xmath157 .",
    "the templates that gives the minimum @xmath137 values are chosen as the best fit .",
