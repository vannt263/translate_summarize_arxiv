    "locales @xcite are a point - free version of topological spaces .",
    "an example is the locale @xmath1 of closed ideals of an abelian c*-algebra @xmath2 , which is an algebraic ( lattice - theoretic ) object that contains all the information about the spectrum of the algebra . in many contexts locales are more convenient to work with than spaces , especially when points , separation axioms , etc .",
    ", can be ignored . in such situations locales",
    "often lead to more general theorems , in particular theorems that are constructive in the sense of being valid in arbitrary toposes @xcite .",
    "one can also think of a locale as being a kind of commutative ring ( with the underlying abelian group replaced by a sup - lattice ) .",
    "the similarity to commutative algebra goes a long way and it is at the basis of the groupoid representation of grothendieck toposes @xcite , in which localic groupoids ( i.e. , groupoids in the category of locales @xmath3 ) arise from toposes via descent .",
    "a generalization of locales is given by quantales @xcite , which are semigroups in the category of sup - lattices and thus are like noncommutative rings .",
    "the idea that some quantales can be regarded as generalized , and c*-algebra related , point - free spaces has been around since the term `` quantale '' was coined @xcite , and there is a particularly good interplay between quantales and groupoids @xcite .",
    "concretely , the quantale of a topological groupoid @xmath4 ( with open domain map ) is the topology of the arrow space @xmath5 equipped with pointwise operations of multiplication and involution .",
    "this can be regarded as a convolution `` algebra '' , for if we identify each open subset @xmath6 with a continuous mapping to sierpi ' nski space @xmath7 we obtain @xmath8 where the convolution of two continuous maps @xmath9 is defined by @xmath10 this construction can be carried over to localic groupoids , and the resulting correspondence between groupoids and quantales restricts to a bijection between localic tale groupoids ( up to isomorphisms ) and inverse quantal frames @xcite .",
    "this is a topological analogue of the dualities of algebraic geometry , with tale groupoids playing the role of `` noncommutative varieties '' . in particular ,",
    "any grothendieck topos coincides , at least in the case of the topos of an tale groupoid , with a category of modules over the quantale of the groupoid @xcite ( see also @xcite for other quantale representations of grothendieck toposes ) .",
    "however , this analogy is objects - only because the bijection is not functorial with respect to groupoid functors and quantale homomorphisms , and the main aim of this paper is to address this issue .",
    "this functoriality problem is similar to another , well known , one : locally compact groupoids @xcite generalize both locally compact groups and locally compact spaces but , if we take groupoid morphisms to be general functors , this generalization is not functorial with respect to convolution algebras and their homomorphisms . in order to see this",
    "it suffices to notice that gelfand duality yields a contravariant functor from compact hausdorff spaces to c*-algebras , whereas the universal c*-algebra of a discrete group defines a covariant functor .",
    "an interpretation of this discrepancy is that a groupoid c*-algebra can be regarded as a description of the space of orbits ( in a generalized sense ) of the groupoid and that groupoid functors fail to account for this @xcite .",
    "in addition , for two such spaces to be considered `` the same '' one usually requires the algebras to be only morita equivalent rather than isomorphic . accordingly ,",
    "appropriate definitions of morphism for groupoids , which subsume groupoid functors and map functorially to bimodules , have been defined in terms of bi - actions @xcite .",
    "the idea of a groupoid as a generalized space of orbits is even more explicit in topos theory , since any grothendieck topos is , in a suitable sense , a quotient of the object space of a groupoid in the 2-category of toposes and geometric morphisms @xcite .",
    "again , morphisms can be taken to be bi - actions @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we show that the correspondence between groupoids and quantales is functorial in the bicategorical sense suggested by the above remarks . in order to achieve this",
    "we show , in section [ funct2 ] , following preliminary results about groupoid actions in section [ gpdactions ] , that the bi - actions of localic tale groupoids map functorially to quantale bimodules , and that , improving on what would be expected for convolution algebras , this assignment restricts to a biequivalence , namely between the bicategory @xmath11 of localic tale groupoids and a bicategory @xmath12 of inverse quantal frames .",
    "as an example , at the end of section [ funct2 ] we discuss the notion of algebraic morphism of groupoids @xcite .",
    "algebraic morphisms are examples of groupoid bi - actions that map functorially and covariantly to homomorphisms of c*-algebras @xcite and to homomorphisms of inverse semigroups @xcite , and furthermore , as noted in @xcite , specialize both to group homomorphisms ( covariantly ) and to continuous maps between topological spaces ( contravariantly ) , hence in a narrower extent suggesting a solution to the functoriality problem addressed in this paper .",
    "a corollary of our bicategorical equivalence is that the algebraic morphisms of tale groupoids are `` the same '' as the homomorphisms of unital ( involutive ) quantales between the quantales of the groupoids and yield a category @xmath13 which is equivalent to the category @xmath0 of @xcite . for tale groupoids all the above remarks ( except those pertaining to c*-algebras )",
    "follow readily from this identification .",
    "another consequence is that there is a covariant functor from a non - trivial category of quantales to c*-algebras .",
    "the existence of such a functor is interesting in its own right , in view of the difficulties that arise with respect to functoriality when studying correspondences between quantales and c*-algebras @xcite .",
    "in addition to the above results , and independently from bi - actions and bimodules , we show , in section [ funct1 ] , that the subcategory @xmath14 of @xmath0 whose morphisms are also locale homomorphisms is dually equivalent to a category @xmath15 of tale groupoids whose morphisms , in the topological context , coincide with the covering functors @xcite .    other functorial aspects of groupoid quantales , for instance regarding hilsum ",
    "skandalis maps and morita equivalence , will be addressed in a subsequent paper .",
    "in this section we introduce basic facts , terminology and notation for sup - lattices , locales and groupoid quantales , mostly following @xcite .      by a _",

    "it is interesting to note that , albeit under completely different terminology , and restricting to discrete groupoids , the idea of defining a morphism of groupoids @xmath297 to be a homomorphism of quantales @xmath298 can be found in the work of zakrzewski @xcite , whose notion of pseudospace (  @xcite ) is based on the idea of replacing the underlying linear space of an associative @xmath295-algebra by the sup - lattice structure of a powerset , hence leading to algebras that are unital involutive quantales and furthermore , as the author states , are equivalent to discrete groupoids .",
    "there is more than one way in which such ideas can be carried over to more general groupoids . for arbitrary open groupoids @xcite",
    "a definition of morphism @xmath297 can of course be based on a homomorphism of involutive quantales @xmath298 , but additional requirements are needed , in particular due to the absence of multiplicative units . besides , for groupoids equipped with non - trivial additional structure , such as non - tale lie groupoids , a homomorphism of quantales only takes the structure of topological groupoid into account .",
    "by contrast , algebraic morphisms were proposed by buneci and stachura precisely as a way of generalizing zakrewski s ideas to ( not necessarily tale ) locally compact groupoids , and zakrzewski s own extension to the differential setting @xcite defines morphisms @xmath297 of lie groupoids and symplectic groupoids to be `` differential relations '' , i.e. , submanifolds of @xmath299 satisfying suitable conditions .",
