    "turbulent flows in nature and laboratory are mostly anisotropic on their largest scales .",
    "a typical situation is one in which an imposed shear gradient sustains the turbulence .",
    "one fundamental question is the effect of anisotropic large scales on the statistical behaviour on the smaller scales .",
    "kolmogorov ( 1941 ) postulated that at sufficiently large reynolds number statistics of small scales become isotropic even if the large scale driving is anisotropic .",
    "consequently , cross - correlations , indicated , e.g. , by the shear - stress cospectrum @xmath3 in the fourier space , should decay very fast to zero with respect to increasing wavenumber . based on this postulate , lumley ( 1967 )",
    "predicted , for a turbulent shear flow with constant mean shear rate @xmath4 , the rate at which anisotropy vanishes with decreasing scale size .",
    "if the shear time scale , @xmath5 , is much greater than the viscous time scale , @xmath6 , in other words , if @xmath7 holds , he showed by dimensional arguments that the shear - stress cospectrum follows @xmath8 .",
    "quantities @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the kinematic viscosity and the energy dissipation rate , respectively .",
    "note that the cospectrum would be exactly zero in a system that is perfectly isotropic on all scales .",
    "the concept of local isotropy on the level of second order moments seemed to be supported by direct numerical simulations ( she _ et al .",
    "_ 1993 ) and a number of high - reynolds number measurements in turbulent boundary layers ( caughey _ et al .",
    "_ 1979 ; saddoughi & veeravalli 1994 ) .",
    "very recently , however , kurien & sreenivasan ( 2000 ) found a slower decay of anisotropies in an atmospheric boundary layer at @xmath11 .",
    "they reported , e.g. , a scaling of the cospectrum with @xmath12 .",
    "deviations from the local isotropy were also found in a number of new experiments in nearly homogeneous shear flows when attention was focused on higher order moments ( garg & warhaft 1998 ; ferchichi & tavoularis 2000 ; shen & warhaft 2000 ) .",
    "quantities which are very sensitive to anisotropic contributions at smallest scales are derivative moments of the turbulent velocity components , @xmath13 .",
    "we denote moments of odd orders ( @xmath14 ) by @xmath15 and of even orders ( @xmath16 ) by @xmath17 the brackets @xmath18 denote the ensemble average and no tensor summations are applied for @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "if the turbulence in the shear flow is locally isotropic odd moments of the transverse derivative ( @xmath21 ) should decay with @xmath22 .",
    "shen & warhaft ( 2000 ) measured a slower decay of the derivative skewness , @xmath23 , with a value of 0.2 at @xmath24 .",
    "the fifth moment @xmath25 remained constant while @xmath26 even increased in the range of taylor reynolds numbers between 100 and 1000 .",
    "these results were confirmed in part by similar experiments of ferchichi & tavoularis ( 2000 ) .",
    "third order transverse derivative moments of both experiments agreed also with those found in homogeneous shear flow simulations at @xmath27 ( pumir 1996 ) .",
    "all the results indicate that the influence of large scale anisotropies on the statistics of the smallest scales does not decay as fast as predicted by dimensional arguments , and in some cases may not decay at all .",
    "this paper is addressed to the numerical investigation of statistical properties in the simplest shear flow configuration , the homogeneous shear flow .",
    "the flow is characterized by the following mean profiles of the velocity components @xmath28 where @xmath29 are streamwise ( or downstream ) , @xmath30 shear ( or wall - normal ) , and @xmath31 spanwise directions , respectively .",
    "the velocity components can be decomposed in a mean fraction and a fluctuating turbulent part , @xmath32 for @xmath33 and @xmath31 . besides finite difference methods with shear periodic boundary conditions ( gerz _ et al .",
    "_ 1989 ) pseudospectral methods in a fully periodic domain using a remeshing ( rogallo 1981 ; rogers & moin 1987 ; pumir 1996 ; gualtieri _ et al .",
    "_ 2000 ) were mostly used to model a homogeneous shear flow . in this method",
    ", it was harder to reach a stationary turbulent state .",
    "an alternative method to overcome this problem was suggested by schumacher & eckhardt ( 2000 ) very recently .",
    "the method avoids the remeshing that needs to be applied for the increasingly skewed grid of rogallo ( 1981 ) and that corresponds to a time - periodic driving of the flow .",
    "a statistically stationary state for long times can be maintained by using stress - free boundary conditions in @xmath30 direction and an appropriate body force .",
    "results for third and fourth order agreed with those of rogers & moin ( 1987 ) and of pumir ( 1996 ) .",
    "derivative skewness was weakly decaying with respect to @xmath34 .",
    "this paper extends that analysis .",
    "we systematically investigate the temporal fluctuations of the energy and enstrophy around their mean values and compare them with the findings of pumir ( 1996 ) and gualtieri _ et al .",
    "_ ( 2000 ) .",
    "we show that the level of fluctuations around the mean quantities is much smaller and reaches values that are observed in turbulence measurements .",
    "energy as well as shear - stress cospectra are studied .",
    "inspired by recent experiments we extend the analysis systematically to higher order derivative moments ( @xmath35 ) in the range of taylor reynolds numbers accessible .",
    "non - decreasing higher order moments indicate that very rare small - scale events may exist .",
    "we shall also discuss the problem of statistical convergence of higher order moments in detail .",
    "with length scales measured in units of the gap width @xmath36 , and time scales in units of @xmath37 , the dimensionless form of the equations for an incompressible navier  stokes fluid become @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the pressure , @xmath40 the velocity field .",
    "the shear reynolds number is @xmath41 . in the @xmath29 and @xmath31 directions periodic boundary conditions apply . in the other direction",
    "the flow domain is bounded by two parallel flat surfaces that are assumed to be impenetrable and stress - free , @xmath42 as discussed in more detail in a recent paper by schumacher & eckhardt ( 2001 ) , the free slip boundary conditions allow for efficient numerical simulations with fourier modes for the velocity components .",
    "the equations are integrated by means of a pseudospectral technique using a 2/3-rule de - aliasing .",
    "time integration was done by means of a 5-th order runge - kutta scheme with adaptive time stepping ( hairer _ et al .",
    "_ 1993 ) . in table 1",
    "the computational parameters are summarized for all the runs presented .",
    "the aspect ratio @xmath43 and the shear reynolds number @xmath44 were varied .",
    "it is also visible that the spectral resolutions in @xmath29 and @xmath30 directions are different causing maximum wavenumber components of @xmath45 and @xmath46 , respectively , after de - aliasing . as a criterion for sufficient spectral resolution @xmath47",
    "is used ( pope 2000 ) with kolmogorov length scale @xmath48 and @xmath49 for a uniform grid case . for the present model with different grid spacing in the three dimensions ,",
    "it is suggested therefore to take @xmath50 .",

    "in this section , the results for higher order moments are presented .",
    "the quantities studied are those derivative moments that display sensitivity to deviations from local isotropy .",
    "three different quantites were investigated : the transverse derivative of the turbulent streamwise velocity , @xmath62 , the spanwise vorticity , @xmath63 , and the longitudinal derivative of the turbulent streamwise velocity , @xmath64 . in table 3",
    "we summarize the results for orders 3 to 7 for five different simulations .",
    "the moments of the longitudinal derivative @xmath64 do not vary in order of magnitude for all values of @xmath65 , and are found to agree with ferchichi & tavoularis ( 2000 ) as well as with shen & warhaft ( 2000 ) . for a larger range of taylor reynolds numbers both experiments find a slow increase for all longitudinal moments . if the turbulent flow would be isotropic , the odd moments @xmath66 would be exactly zero for all odd @xmath67 .",
    "in contrast , we observe nonzero values for the transverse derivative and spanwise vorticity moments . while the third order slowly decreases in the range of taylor reynolds numbers , fifth and seventh order increase with @xmath34 . in figure  [ fig4 ]",
    "we compare our results with the numerical data of pumir ( 1996 ) for @xmath68 and with the experimental data of shen & warhaft ( 2000 ) at @xmath27 .",
    "the error bars for our data display the standard deviation of the @xmath30 profiles of the moments .",
    "averaging was always performed in time and in planes at fixed @xmath30 .",
    "data points closest to the boundaries are excluded from the evaluation of the averages .",
    "the snapshots of the full velocity field were always separated by at least one shear time unit , @xmath69 .",
    "the minimal number of used snapshots was 114 ( for run 5 ) .",
    "the results are in agreement with previous numerical and experimental findings .",
    "the fluctuations around the mean grow for increasing order as expected .",
    "these fluctuations were subject to a more detailed investigation .",
    "figure  [ fig5 ] shows the probability density functions ( pdf ) , denoted as @xmath70 , of @xmath71 in the left column and of @xmath72 in the right column .",
    "the results are calculated from @xmath73 data points at @xmath74 .",
    "a check of the statistical convergence of the @xmath65th order moments can be made by plotting the integrands @xmath75 over @xmath31 which is also shown in figure  [ fig5 ] . while the longitudinal derivative has converged well , the integrands for the transverse derivative show a strong scatter in the tails of the pdf .",
    "the area that covers the scattered data measures the uncertainty around the mean in an alternative way .    in the following ,",
    "we wish to discuss the strong scattering of higher order moments and will demonstrate by means of a simple analytical model that this is a more general feature for data analysis .",
    "the pdf ( see figure  [ fig5 ] ) can be roughly approximated by the following normalized exponential distribution @xmath76 for which all moments can be evaluated analytically , following to @xmath77 .",
    "let @xmath78 be the number of statistically independent samples .",
    "the standard deviation , which is defined as @xmath79^{1/2}$ ] , follows then as @xmath80^{1/2}\\ , , \\label{sigma}\\ ] ] for the odd normalized moments @xmath81 .",
    "the denominator was simplified because @xmath82 .",
    "when taking , e.g. , @xmath83 and @xmath84 , the standard deviation for the seventh moment decreases from 24@xmath85 at @xmath86 to 1@xmath85 at @xmath87 .",
    "thus , the calculation demonstrates clearly the sensitivity of higher order moments on the number @xmath78 which can give rise to very large fluctuations around the mean as observed in our simulations .",
    "while moments itself are proportional to the factorial of the order , @xmath88 , its fluctuations become even proportional to @xmath89 .",
    "tennekes & lumley ( 1972 ) estimated @xmath90 for a first order moment , where @xmath91 is the integral time scale and @xmath92 the duration of the measurement .",
    "starting from this point , sreenivasan _ et al . _",
    "( 1978 ) extracted relations for the accuracy of higher order moments using their atmospheric boundary layer data .",
    "following their lines , the number of statistically independent samples for an @xmath65th moment , @xmath93 , would result in @xmath94 . aside from the fact that the fluctuations for fixed @xmath78 and growing @xmath65 can increase rapidly , this dependence would improve the statistical convergence weakly .    in summary , we have presented an alternative method of modelling a statistically stationary homogeneous shear flow by using stress - free boundary conditions in @xmath30 direction . on the level of",
    "second order moments our results are not in conflict with the classical concepts of local isotropy as indicated by the power spectra of the velocity correlations .",
    "we found non - decreasing derivative moments for the orders 4 to 7 which agree with the experimental findings of shen & warhaft for @xmath27 but are in apparent violation of local isotropy .",
    "a next step would be to relate typical structures of turbulent shear flows , such as streamwise vortices and streamwise streaks , to the statistical properties presented here .",
    "the author thanks b.  eckhardt , a.  pumir , k.  r.  sreenivasan , p.  k.  yeung and z.  warhaft for fruitful discussions and helpful comments .",
