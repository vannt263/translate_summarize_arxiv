    "noticeable progress in precise calculations of the few - nucleon binding energies within variational approaches  @xcite ,  @xcite ,  @xcite stimulates the further development of optimal variational schemes and their possible refinement in order to achieve higher precision in calculations   @xcite ,  @xcite of the main structural characteristics of the bound states of few - nucleon nuclei .",
    "the progress in this field enables one to obtain  exact",
    " results for various structural characteristics of the systems and to put forward the problem of precise fitting of the nucleon - nucleon potentials universal for all the light nuclei , as well as to carry out accurate variational calculations for heavier nuclei .",
    "the achievement of a high accuracy in calculations of a few - particle quantum system is restricted both by the number of particles and the number of the wave function spatial components . at the first stage of studies of a simple qualitative type",
    ", rather rough assumptions were used about nuclear interaction potentials and the wave function spin structure ( see  @xcite ,   @xcite ,  @xcite ) , thus an account of all the wave function spatial components was considered to be not necessary . but",
    "precise calculations with controlled accuracy need to take into account all the factors contributing to the result of a given accuracy .",
    "such a statement of the problem is faced with rather nontrivial difficulties even for comparatively simple three- and four - nucleon systems . in the standard",
    "commonly used scheme with the use of the isospin formalism , an additional symmetry of the wave function and the mixture of states with different total isospins due to a consistent account of the coulomb interaction lead to the essential growth of the number of spatial components of the wave function and thus to a serious complication of calculations . as a result , to find the total wave function of the @xmath0he nucleus in the framework of the isospin formalism",
    ", one has to solve a system of six spatial equations , while in the case of @xmath1he nucleus one has already to deal with twelve equations .",
    "here , we present our approach proposed in  @xcite without explicit use of the isospin representation and , using the example of three - nucleon systems , show the complete equivalence of such a more convenient approach to the traditional isospin formalism . it is shown for the wave functions in both approaches to be connected by certain relations , while all the physical observables calculated within both approaches are shown to coincide .",
    "the obtained much more simple systems of equations for the spatial components of the wave finctions of three nucleons in the bound state or scattering process ( in the doublet or quartet spin states ) enabled us to carry out precise calculations for three - nucleon nuclei and to analyze their structure .",
    "in order to show the complete equivalence of the representation without explicit use of isospin ( protons are not identical to neutrons ) to the traditional isospin formalism , we recall the explicit form of equations for the three - nucleon system ( @xmath2 ) within the isospin formalism with common assumptions about the central exchange nuclear two - particle potential and the coulomb interaction between protons . in bound state ( @xmath0he nucleus ) , the system ( @xmath2 ) has spin @xmath3 and the isospin projection @xmath4 , being in a mixed isospin state ( @xmath5 and @xmath6 ) .",
    "thus , the total antisymmetric wave function can be represented in terms of standard spin - isospin functions and consists of six spatial components :    @xmath7    after projecting the schrdinger equation onto the basic spin - isospin functions , one has the system of six equations for the spatial components of the wave function :    @xmath8 \\psi ^{s}-\\frac{1}{2}\\left [ \\left ( u_{31}^{\\prime } -u_{13}^{\\prime } \\right ) \\psi ^{\\prime } + \\left ( u_{31}^{\\prime \\prime } -u_{13}^{\\prime \\prime } \\right ) \\psi ^{\\prime \\prime } \\right ] \\\\ & & + \\frac{1}{3}\\left ( u_{c}^{\\prime } \\psi ^{\\prime } + u_{c}^{\\prime \\prime } \\psi ^{\\prime \\prime } \\right ) + \\frac{1}{3}\\left ( u_{c}^{\\prime } \\varphi ^{\\prime } + u_{c}^{\\prime \\prime } \\varphi ^{\\prime \\prime } \\right)\\;=0,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath9 \\psi ^{\\prime } \\\\ & & -\\frac{1}{4}\\left [ \\left ( u_{33}^{\\prime } -u_{31}^{\\prime } -u_{13}^{\\prime } + u_{11}^{\\prime } \\right ) \\psi ^{\\prime \\prime } + \\left ( u_{33}^{\\prime \\prime } -u_{31}^{\\prime \\prime } -u_{13}^{\\prime \\prime } + u_{11}^{\\prime \\prime } \\right ) \\psi ^{\\prime } \\right ] \\\\ & & -\\frac{1}{2}\\left ( u_{31}^{\\prime } -u_{13}^{\\prime } -\\frac{2}{3}% u_{c}^{\\prime } \\right ) \\psi ^{s}+\\frac{1}{2}\\left ( u_{33}^{\\prime \\prime } -u_{11}^{\\prime \\prime } + \\frac{2}{3}u_{c}^{\\prime \\prime } \\right ) \\psi ^{a}+% \\frac{1}{3}\\left ( u_{c}^{\\prime \\prime } \\varphi ^{\\prime } + u_{c}^{\\prime } \\varphi ^{\\prime \\prime } \\right)\\;=0,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath9 \\psi ^{\\prime \\prime } \\\\ & & -\\frac{1}{4}\\left [ \\left ( u_{33}^{\\prime } -u_{31}^{\\prime } -u_{13}^{\\prime } + u_{11}^{\\prime } \\right ) \\psi ^{\\prime } -\\left ( u_{33}^{\\prime \\prime } -u_{31}^{\\prime \\prime } -u_{13}^{\\prime \\prime } + u_{11}^{\\prime \\prime } \\right ) \\psi ^{\\prime \\prime } \\right ] \\\\ & & -\\frac{1}{2}\\left ( u_{31}^{\\prime \\prime } -u_{13}^{\\prime \\prime } -\\frac{2% } { 3}u_{c}^{\\prime \\prime } \\right ) \\psi ^{s}-\\frac{1}{2}\\left ( u_{33}^{\\prime } -u_{11}^{\\prime } + \\frac{2}{3}u_{c}^{\\prime } \\right ) \\psi ^{a}+\\frac{1}{3}% \\left ( u_{c}^{\\prime } \\varphi ^{\\prime } -u_{c}^{\\prime \\prime } \\varphi ^{\\prime \\prime } \\right)\\;=0,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath10 \\psi ^{a}+\\frac{1}{2}\\left [ \\left ( u_{33}^{\\prime \\prime } -u_{11}^{\\prime \\prime } \\right ) \\psi ^{\\prime } -\\left ( u_{33}^{\\prime } -u_{11}^{\\prime } \\right ) \\psi ^{\\prime \\prime } \\right ] \\\\ & & -\\frac{1}{3}\\left ( u_{c}^{\\prime } \\psi ^{\\prime \\prime } -u_{c}^{\\prime \\prime } \\psi ^{\\prime } \\right ) + \\frac{1}{3}\\left ( u_{c}^{\\prime } \\varphi ^{\\prime \\prime } -u_{c}^{\\prime \\prime } \\varphi ^{\\prime } \\right ) \\;=0,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath11 \\varphi ^{\\prime } + \\frac{1}{2}\\left [ \\left ( u_{13}^{\\prime } -u_{33}^{\\prime } \\right ) \\varphi ^{\\prime \\prime } + \\left ( u_{13}^{\\prime \\prime } -u_{33}^{\\prime \\prime } \\right ) \\varphi ^{\\prime } \\right ] \\\\ & & + \\frac{1}{3}\\left ( u_{c}^{\\prime } \\psi ^{\\prime \\prime } + u_{c}^{\\prime \\prime } \\psi ^{\\prime } + u_{c}^{\\prime } \\psi ^{s}-u_{c}^{\\prime \\prime } \\psi",

    "we reformulate the problem in an equivalent form using the fact that the reason for an increase in the number of equations in the few - nucleon problem is the additional antisymmetrization of wave functions ( the generalized pauli principle for nucleons ) connected with the introduction of isospin for treating a proton and a neutron as an isotopic doublet .",
    "it appears that not all the spatial components of the wave function in ( [ e1 ] ) are independent , and eqs .",

    "all the properties of the system are determined in this case by only the triplet charge - dependent nuclear interaction potentials , and it is necessary to solve only one equation to find the spatial component of the wave function ( the spin function of three nucleons is one - component in this case , and the spatial function of the system ( @xmath2 ) is antisymmetric with respect to permutations of the two protons ) .",

    "it follows from the general form of the central exchange interaction potentials presented in terms of the majorana exchange operators that the transition to the equivalent representation without use of the isospin formalism is also possible for heavier nuclei and is reasonable for simplifying numerical calculations without any approximations .",

    "table 1 contains the results of calculation of the binding energies @xmath41 and r.m.s .",
    "radii for the afnan - tang ( ats3 ) and minnesota potentials ( @xmath42 @xmath43 @xmath44 in calculations with equal masses of a proton and a neutron , the coulomb parameter being @xmath45 @xmath43 @xmath46 , and the parameters of potentials are taken from  @xcite ) .",
    "the more realistic afnan - tang potential with interaction only in even orbital states is denoted by at-(s3)@xmath47 .",
    "the results for energies and radii are given with the accuracy of one unit in the last digit with high probability ( the exact results for the binding energies are slightly greater , but within not more than @xmath48 @xmath49 ) .",
    "high accuracy of the calculations and the convergence of the results with spreading the variational basis are obtained with the use of a comparatively small number of basis functions ( about 60 - 100 ones for both the symmetric @xmath35and antisymmetric @xmath29  functions ) .",
    "it is found that the optimal way to achieve a given accuracy is to take into account about three times more gaussian components for @xmath28 than those for @xmath29 .",
    "due to the approach based on system ( [ e7 ] ) without explicit use of isospin , our numerical results are of higher precision than the known varga - suzuki ones   @xcite , although we used a less number of gaussian variational basis functions .",
    "the greater the difference between the triplet and singlet interaction potentials and the greater the short - range repulsion , the more essential is the difference between the energies calculated exactly and those obtained in the spinless approximation .",
    "the complete calculation of energies with account of the difference in the neutron and proton masses ( @xmath50 ) shows the binding energy of @xmath0h to increase a little and that of @xmath0he to slightly decrease , while r.m.s .",
    "radii are practically unchangeable . for all used interaction potentials , the proton , neutron , and mass r.m.s .",
    "radii indicate the distinct specific structures of @xmath0h and @xmath0he nuclei .",
    "namely , the proton radius in the @xmath0h nucleus is essentially smaller than the neutron one ( something like the neutron  halo  ) , while the @xmath0he nucleus reveals the inverse pattern ( the proton  halo  ) .",
    "the explanation of this effect lies in the fact that the attraction of a pair of nucleons in the singlet state is weaker than that in the triplet one .",
    "the obtained wave functions , having a suitable gaussian representation , enabled us to calculate the main structure functions of the three - nucleon nuclei for various nuclear potentials .",
    "1 presents the proton density distribution @xmath51  as well as the neutron one @xmath52 for a @xmath0h nucleus in the case of the at-(s3)@xmath47 potential ( the nucleons are considered to be point - like particles ) . the peripheral neutron",
    "effect is seen distinctly due to the neutron density distribution being somewhat more long - range than the proton one ( see also the r.m.s .",
    "radii in table 1 ) . at the same time , the proton density is essentially higher than the neutron one at the center of the nucleus .",
    "we have almost the same density distributions for the @xmath0he nucleus ( even from the quantitative point of view ) , but with the exchanged protons and neutrons @xmath53 .",
    "the main reason for such a regularity lies in the difference between the interactions in triplet and singlet states , while the coulomb repulsion plays a negligible role .",
    "2 shows the charge formfactors for @xmath0h and @xmath0he nuclei calculated with the same potential .",
    "note that the formfactor profile of @xmath0he falls down already at small @xmath54 more rapidly as compared to that of @xmath0h , due to the greater radius of the proton density distribution in @xmath0he as compared with that in @xmath0h .",
    "and the formfactor of @xmath0he changes its sign at smaller @xmath54 ( experimental value @xmath55 @xmath56 for @xmath0he ) because of the essential role of short - range correlations between the protons .",
    "3 presents the pair correlation functions of the @xmath57h nucleus both for the pair of neutrons ( @xmath58 ) and for the neutron - proton pair ( @xmath59 ) in the case of the at-(s3)@xmath47 potential .",
    "a noticeable difference between them is connected with a difference in the interactions in triplet and singlet states , and with the fact that , in the @xmath0h nucleus , the proton and a neutron interact mainly in the triplet state , while the two neutrons do in the singlet one . for comparison ,",
    "we give also the deuteron wave function squared in the same figure for the same interaction potential ( i.e. , the pair correlation function of two nucleons in the triplet state ; see the curve @xmath60 in fig.3 ) .",
    "the high accuracy of the known approximation based on two - particle correlation functions for the few - nucleon nuclei is confirmed once again .",
    "all the main conclusions are also valid for the minnesota potential , in particular , those about the above - mentioned likeness of pair correlation functions of three- and two - particle systems . moreover , for the both considered potentials , the pair correlation functions of @xmath0h are similar to those of @xmath0he ( with the account of the substitution @xmath61 like for density distributions ) .",
    "the structure of the nuclei is determined mainly by the triplet and singlet interaction potentials , while the role of the coulomb interaction is small and leads to a little and almost proportional expansion of the @xmath0he nucleus in comparison with @xmath57h .",
    "but , in the case of the minnesota potential having essentially less short - range repulsion than the at-(s3)@xmath47 one , the dips in the formfactors of @xmath0h and @xmath0he nuclei occur at greater @xmath54 , and the pair correlation functions have an essentially less decrease at short distances .",
    "thus , using the example of three - nucleon systems with central interaction potentials , we show the complete equivalence of the isospin formalism ( with the total wave function being antisymmetric in the space of spin , isospin , and coordinate variables ) and the proposed representation without explicituse of isospin ( with the total wave function being antisymmetric in identical nucleons in spin and spatial coordinate variables ) .",
    "the obtained equations in the representation without use of isospin are unitary equivalent to the standard approach using the isospin representation .",
    "the proposed approach is much more suitable ( due to the small number of spatial equations that is determined by the dimension of a spin young scheme ) and enables one to carry out a precise study ( with given accuracy ) of three - nucleon systems in the bound states or scattering processes with various central nuclear interaction potentials . using certain optimization schemes for the variational method with gaussian basis , we carried out the precise calculations of the bound states of three nucleons with several nucleon - nucleon interaction potentials .",
    "the results are of higher precision than those available in the literature .",
    "density distributions , formfactors , and pair correlation functions are calculated as well .",
    "the advantages of the proposed approach can reveal themselves in precise calculations of systems of four nucleons ( when the total spin @xmath62 , there are two equations for spatial components ) , five nucleons ( there are five equations at @xmath3 ) , and , perhaps , of six - nucleon systems ( five equations for spatial components in the both cases of @xmath63he and @xmath63li nuclei ) .",
    "the developed approach opens a real possibility to construct the realistic potentials describing completely , with reasonable accuracy , the main low - energy parameters of few - nucleon systems .",
    "pair correlation functions @xmath67 and @xmath68 for @xmath0h nucleus ( for the at-(s3)@xmath47 interaction potential ) . for comparison , the pair correlation function @xmath69 for @xmath0he and the deuteron wave function squared are shown .",
