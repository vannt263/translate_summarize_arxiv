    "a pendulum under the action of an external force is an important and ubiquitous model in various areas of nonlinear dynamics .",
    "one of the interesting and important in applications phenomena is capture of the pendulum s oscillations into resonance with the oscillations of the external force .",
    "consider first the pendulum initially at rest , and the external force of small amplitude @xmath0 and frequency equal to the frequency of the pendulum s linear oscillations @xmath1 .",
    "it is known that such a force can increase the pendulum s amplitude up to a value of order @xmath2 . at larger amplitudes the dependence of the pendulum s frequency on the amplitude ( i.e. , the pendulum s nonlinearity ) results in breakup of the resonance . however ,",
    "if the frequency of the external force is not constant but slowly decreasing with time at a rate @xmath3 , the so called autoresonance phenomenon occurs ( see , e.g. , @xcite and the references therein ) .",
    "when the frequency of the force passes through the value @xmath1 , the pendulum is captured into the resonance with the force , and the amplitude of its oscillations increases in such a way that the pendulum stays in the resonance .",
    "this phenomenon has been studied in numerous works starting from the pioneering papers of v. i. veksler and e. m. mcmillan @xcite where a crucial role of the autoresonance in particle accelerators was demonstrated .",
    "however , it is methodically important and interesting to consider this phenomenon using the standard and well - developed hamiltonian approach to resonant phenomena in nonlinear systems @xcite .",
    "we do this in the present paper .",
    "we show that automatic capture into resonance ( capture with probability one ) has place not only for zero initial amplitude of the pendulum , but also for small non - zero initial amplitudes .",
    "we also consider the case of larger initial amplitudes and describe the capture into the resonance and evaluate its probability .",
    "a captured pendulum escapes from the resonance at a certain final amplitude of oscillations .",
    "we describe this phenomenon and find the energy of the pendulum at the escape .",
    "we study mostly the important `` adiabatic '' case , when the variation rate of the external frequency is much smaller than the amplitude of the external force : @xmath4 .",
    "however , some conclusions are made also for the case when @xmath5 . in particular",
    ", we show that capture into the resonance is impossible , if @xmath0 is smaller than a certain threshold that depend on the value of @xmath3 .",
    "this agrees with so - called threshold phenomenon ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we start at the hamiltonian of a pendulum under the action of a time - periodic external forcing : h = - _ 0 ^ 2 q + q. [ 0.1 ] here @xmath6 are canonically conjugate momentum and coordinate , @xmath1 is a frequency of linear oscillations , @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the amplitude and the phase of the external forcing respectively .",
    "assume that @xmath9 is a slowly varying frequency of the external forcing , @xmath10 .    a standard way to study",
    "this system near the 1:1 resonance is to introduce the action - angle variables of the unperturbed pendulum as a new pair of canonical variables , average the hamiltonian near the resonance , and expand it into series .",
    "this approach is implemented in section [ sec3 ] of this paper .",
    "however , when the initial amplitude of the pendulum is zero or small , of order @xmath2 , it is easier to apply a different method .",
    "namely , one can expand the cosine in ( [ 0.1 ] ) and use symplectic polar coordinates instead of the exact action - angle variables .",
    "below in this section we use this latter approach .",
    "the results obtained by the two methods at small values of the initial amplitude asymptotically agree with each other .",
    "thus , in this section we study the case of small amplitude of the pendulum s oscillations : @xmath11 . expanding @xmath12 into series and omitting a constant ,",
    "we find in the main approximation h = + _ 0 ^ 2 - _ 0 ^ 2 + q. [ 0.2 ] introduce new canonical variables ( so - called symplectic polar coordinates ) @xmath13 and @xmath14 : q = , p = . [ 0.3 ] in terms of the new variables the hamiltonian takes the form h = _ 0 - ^4 + . [ 0.4 ] we consider the situation when the system is close to the 1:1 resonance , i.e. , when @xmath15 .",
    "introduce the _ resonance phase _ @xmath16 as a new variable . to do this ,",
    "make a canonical change of variables @xmath17 defined with generating function @xmath18 . in the new variables ,",
    "the hamiltonian is @xmath19 .",
    "one can average over the fast phase and obtain the hamiltonian averaged near the resonance ( we omit tildes ) : h = _ 0 - + 12 - . [ 0.5 ] introduce another pair of canonical variables @xmath20 : x = , y = .",
    "[ 0.6 ] in these new variables ,",
    "the hamiltonian is h = ( _ 0- ) - + x.

[ 0.8 ] this hamiltonian appears in many resonant problems in celestial mechanics , atomic and plasma physics ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . properties of a system with this hamiltonian were thoroughly investigated in @xcite , and here we just put forward some of results obtained in that paper .    in hamiltonian (",

    "phase portraits of ( [ 0.8 ] ) at different constant values of @xmath24 are presented in figures [ portraits12 ] and [ portrait3 ] . if @xmath28 , there is one elliptic point a ( figure [ portraits12 ] a ) . at @xmath29 , there are two elliptic points a and b , and one saddle point c ( figure [ portrait3 ] ) . in the latter case ,",
    "the phase plane is divided by separatrices @xmath30 into three regions @xmath31 .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     let @xmath32 be the value of hamiltonian ( [ 0.8 ] ) at the saddle point c. introduce @xmath33 .",
    "then we have @xmath34 in @xmath35 , @xmath36 in @xmath37 , and @xmath38 on the separatrices @xmath30 .",
    "as parameter @xmath24 slowly grows with time , curves @xmath30 slowly move on the phase plane . on time intervals of order @xmath39 their position and the areas of @xmath40 essentially changes . at the same time , the area surrounded by a closed phase trajectory at a frozen value of @xmath24 is an adiabatic invariant of the system with slowly varying parameter @xmath24 and is well preserved . hence",

    "the corresponding phase portrait is presented in figure [ portraits12 ] b. the following assertion is valid : if a phase point is inside @xmath44 at @xmath45 , it is captured in @xmath35 at @xmath46 and stays there at least during time intervals of order @xmath47 .",
    "( more precisely , this may not be valid for phase points belonging initially to a narrow strip @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is a positive constant . )",
    "thus , all phase points initially ( at @xmath42 ) inside @xmath44 , except , maybe , for a narrow strip , are `` automatically '' captured into @xmath35 . in @xcite",
    ", this phenomenon was called `` automatic entry into libration '' .",
    "the diameter of this domain is a value of order @xmath50 .",
    "a point captured in @xmath35 rotates around elliptic point a. as time grows , the point a on the portrait slowly moves along @xmath51-axis in the negative direction .",
    "therefore , the motion is a composition of fast rotation around a and slow drift along @xmath51-axis .",
    "the area surrounded by each turn of the trajectory stays approximately the same ( this area is an adiabatic invariant ) .",
    "hence , the average distance between the phase point and the origin slowly grows , corresponding to the growth of amplitude of the pendulum s oscillations in the original problem .",
    "consider now the case when a phase point is initially outside @xmath44 .",
    "as @xmath24 grows , the area inside @xmath44 also grows , and at a certain moment the phase trajectory crosses @xmath44 .",
    "this is due to the fact that the area surrounded by the phase trajectory is an adiabatic invariant , while the area @xmath52 of @xmath35 monotonously grows ( see below ( [ 0.11 ] ) ) . after crossing",
    ", the phase point can continue its motion in @xmath35 during a time interval of order at least @xmath47 ( capture into resonance ) or can cross @xmath53 and continue its motion in @xmath54 ( passage through the resonance without capture ) .",
    "the area @xmath55 of @xmath54 also monotonously grows with time ( see below ( [ 0.11 ] ) ) , hence such a point can not cross @xmath53 once more and return to @xmath35 .",
    "the scenario of motion after crossing @xmath44 strongly depends on initial conditions , and capture into @xmath35 can be considered as a random event .",
    "its probability can be found according to the following formula : = , i_1 ( ) = -_l_1 t , i_2 ( ) = -_l_2 t , [ 0.9 ] where the integrals are calculated at @xmath56 , and @xmath57 is the value of @xmath24 at the time of crossing of @xmath44 found in the adiabatic approximation .",
    "one obtains : i_1 ( ) = 12 ( 2- ) , i_2 = , = ( - 2 ) .",

    "[ 0.11 ] formula ( [ 0.9 ] ) can be interpreted as follows . in a hamiltonian system ,",
    "phase volume is conserved .",
    "as parameter @xmath24 changes by @xmath61 , a phase volume @xmath62 enters the region @xmath35 . at the same time , a volume @xmath63 leaves this region and enters @xmath54 .",
    "the relative measure of points captured in @xmath35 is @xmath64 .",
    "the integral @xmath65 in ( [ 0.9 ] ) is the flow of the phase volume across @xmath44 , and @xmath66 is the flow across @xmath53 .",
    "therefore , pr gives the relative measure of points captured into @xmath35 .",
    "the results of this section were obtained assuming that the adiabaticity condition is valid . to express this condition in terms of the parameters of the system , consider hamiltonian ( [ 0.8 ] ) .",
    "a typical scale of the corresponding phase portrait can be found using the condition that the first and the last terms in the hamiltonian are of the same order .",
    "thus , typical values of coordinates @xmath51 and @xmath67 on the portrait are of order of @xmath50 .",
    "hence , from ( [ 0.6 ] ) and ( [ 0.5 ] ) we find that typical frequency of motion on this portrait is @xmath68 .",
    "the adiabaticity condition implies that variation @xmath69 of the driving frequency during a period of motion on the phase portrait is much smaller than the frequency of motion .",
    "hence , it can be written as @xmath70 or @xmath71 .",
    "thus we have @xmath72 . at values of @xmath0 that do not satisfy this condition",
    "the adiabatic approximation does not work , and , in particular , capture into the resonance is impossible . in @xcite ,",
    "an expression was obtained for the threshold value of @xmath0 such that at smaller @xmath0 the capture into the resonance is not possible .",
    "our estimate agrees with the result of @xcite .    summarizing",
    ", we can say that at small enough initial amplitudes of oscillations ( of order @xmath2 or less ) the pendulum is necessarily captured into the 1:1 resonance with the external forcing of slowly decreasing frequency . if the initial amplitude is larger but still small , the capture occurs with probability of order 1 given by formula ( [ 0.9 ] ) .",
    "in the frames of model ( [ 0.2 ] ) , valid at small amplitudes , the captured pendulum can not escape from the resonance .",
    "we study the system at larger values of the amplitude in the next section .",
    "consider again hamiltonian of the pendulum under the external forcing ( [ 0.1 ] ) .",
    "introduce unperturbed hamiltonian @xmath73 and parameter ^2 = 12(1 + ) , [ 1.2 ] where @xmath74 is a value of @xmath75 .",
    "thus , @xmath76 in the domain of oscillations of the pendulum , @xmath77 on the separatrix , and @xmath78 in the domain of rotations . to introduce the canonical action - angle variables @xmath79",
    ", we note that in the domain of oscillations the exact solution for the unperturbed pendulum ( i. e. , at @xmath80 ) has the form p(t ) = 2 _ 0 ( _ 0 t , ) , + q(t ) = 2 ( ( _ 0 t , ) ) , [ 1.2a ] where @xmath81 and @xmath82 are jacobi elliptic functions ( see , e. g. , @xcite ; the second formula can be obtained as a primitive of the first one ) .",
    "thus , one can introduce canonical transformation @xmath83 with the following formulas p = 2 _ 0 ( , ) , + q = 2 ( ( , ) ) , [ 1.2b ] where @xmath84 should be understood as a function of @xmath85 defined with the formula valid in the domain of oscillations of the pendulum ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) : i(h_0 ) = .

    "<S> we study dynamics of a nonlinear pendulum under a periodic force with small amplitude and slowly decreasing frequency . </S>",
    "<S> it is well known that when the frequency of the external force passes through the value of the frequency of the unperturbed pendulum s oscillations , the pendulum can be captured into the resonance . </S>",
    "<S> the captured pendulum oscillates in such a way that the resonance is preserved , and the amplitude of the oscillations accordingly grows . </S>",
    "<S> we consider this problem in the frames of a standard hamiltonian approach to resonant phenomena in slow - fast hamiltonian systems developed earlier , and evaluate the probability of capture into the resonance . </S>",
    "<S> if the system passes the resonance at small enough initial amplitudes of the pendulum , the capture occurs with necessity ( so - called autoresonance ) . in general </S>",
    "<S> , the probability of capture varies between one and zero , depending on the initial amplitude . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that a pendulum captured at small values of its amplitude escapes from the resonance in the domain of oscillations close to the separatrix of the pendulum , and evaluate the amplitude of the oscillations at the escape . </S>"
