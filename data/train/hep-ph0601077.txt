    "the discovery of quark - hadron duality in electron - nucleon interactions @xcite rises a natural question if the same phenomenon can be seen also in neutrino - nucleon scattering .",
    "unfortunately the available data is not yet precise enough to discuss the problem on the experimental level . at present",
    "the only possibility is to analyze the existing theoretical models of resonance production .",
    "this approach was adopted by sato and lee @xcite who discovered that for their model of @xmath4 production the quark - hadron duality is seen : the resonance peaks of structure functions calculated at @xmath5 gev@xmath3 slide along the dis structure functions ( with cteq6 pdfs ) calculated at @xmath6 gev@xmath3 , both as functions of the nachtmann variable .    in this contribution",
    "we wish to report an investigation of the rein - sehgal ( rs ) model @xcite of resonance production .",
    "the rs model is used by almost all monte carlo generators of neutrino interactions and understanding its properties is of practical value .",
    "the model describes resonance production in the region of hadronic invariant mass @xmath7 below @xmath8 gev by summing contributions from 18 resonances .",
    "it contains also a non - resonant background fine tuned in order to get a good agreement with the existing single pion production ( spp ) data .",
    "we calculate the structure functions @xmath9 as they are defined by the rs model @xcite .",
    "they turn out to be linear combinations of cross sections for three polarization states of the intermediate @xmath7 boson .",
    "the aim of the rs model is to describe only spp channels and the elasticity coefficients are used in order to select exclusive spp channels from the overall resonance production cross section .",
    "the non - resonant background is adjusted only for spp channels .",
    "the analysis of duality requires the knowledge of the inclusive cross section in the resonance region . in the spirit of the rs model",
    "one should add contributions from inelastic channels taking care of complicated interference patterns . in order to make the analysis simpler we introduce 1@xmath10 functions which are defined as probabilities that in the given region of the kinematically allowed space the final state is that of spp .",
    "we calculate them numerically for each spp channel separately using the lund fragmentation and hadronization routines .",
    "all the details of our approach can be found in @xcite .",
    "functions defined in eq . [ 1pion_def ] with resonance elasticity factors taken from pdg @xcite . in the case of @xmath11-neutron scattering",

    "we see that 1@xmath10 functions provide satisfactory average description .",
    "we select the physically relevant region in the @xmath16 variable as @xmath28  gev@xmath3 by looking at double differential cross section @xmath29 for neutrino energy in a few gev region , see fig . 2 @xcite . having in mind mc generators of events",

    "the targets are from the top to the bottom : proton , neutron and their average isoscalar one .",
    "the plots for the dis part are done with grv94 pdfs @xcite .",
    "rs structure functions are yet not re - scaled by 1@xmath10 functions .",
    "similar plots for @xmath1 at @xmath33 gev@xmath3 were shown before in @xcite .",
    "we see that in the case of proton and isoscalar target typical manifestation of local quark - hadron duality : the @xmath4 peak slides along the dis curve .",
    "the duality does not seem to apply neither to other resonances nor to neutron target even in the case of the prominent @xmath4 resonance .    in fig .",

    "both rein - sehgal and 1@xmath10 function re - scaled res @xmath1 structure functions for cc reaction on neutron are presented .",

    "we see that the choice @xmath36 gev makes the functions slowly varying in the wide region of @xmath16 .",
    "the behavior for small values of @xmath37  gev@xmath3 is very different in agreement with the predictions made in @xcite .",
    "for the proton target the best choice is @xmath36  gev while for other two targets it is preferable to choice the resonance region as more confined at the price of significant variations with @xmath16 .",

    "but it is suggested in @xcite that the rs model underestimates the cross section for @xmath38  gev .",
