    "nowadays , it is widely accepted that quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) in 3 + 1 dimensions is the fundamental theory for strong interaction .",
    "dynamical chiral symmetry breaking ( dcsb ) is of fundamental importance for strong interaction physics .",
    "dcsb can be explored via the gap equation , viz . , the dyson - schwinger equation ( dse ) for the dressed - fermion self - energy . as is well known , the gap equation has two solutions in the chiral limit , i.e. the nambu - goldstone ( ng ) solution which is characterized by dcsb , and the wigner ( wn ) solution in which chiral symmetry is not dynamically broken .",
    "however , when the current quark mass @xmath3 is nonzero , the quark gap equation has only one solution which corresponds to the ng phase and the solution corresponding to the wn phase does not exist @xcite .",
    "this conclusion is hard to understand and one will naturally ask why the wigner solution of the quark gap equation only exists in the chiral limit and does not exist at finite current quark mass .",
    "the authors of ref . @xcite first discussed this problem and asked whether the quark gap equation has a wigner solution in the case of nonzero current quark mass .",
    "subsequently , the authors of refs . @xcite further investigated the problem of possible multi - solutions of the quark gap equation . as far as we know , partly due to the complexity of the non - abelian character of qcd , this problem has not been solved satisfactorily in the literature . in the present paper",
    "we try to propose a new approach to investigate this problem in the framework of a relatively simple abelian toy model of qcd , namely , quantum electrodynamics in 2 + 1 dimensions ( qed@xmath1 ) .    as a field - theoretical model , qed@xmath1",
    "has been extensively studied in recent years .",
    "it has many features similar to qcd in 3 + 1 dimensions .",
    "this is because qed@xmath1 is known to have a phase where the chiral symmetry of the theory is spontaneously broken and the fermions are confined in this phase @xcite .",
    "moreover , qed@xmath1 is superrenormalizable , so it is not plagued with the ultraviolet divergences which are present in qed@xmath4 .",
    "these are the basic reasons why qed@xmath1 is regarded as an interesting toy model : studying qed@xmath1 it might be possible to investigate confinement @xcite and dynamical chiral symmetry breaking ( dcsb ) @xcite within a theory which is structurally much simpler than qcd while sharing the same basic nonperturbative phenomena .",
    "herein we try to use the dses for the fermion and photon propagators in qed@xmath1 to describe novel aspects of the interplay between explicit and dynamical chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "the lagrangian of qed@xmath1 with @xmath5 flavors of fermions in a general covariant gauge in euclidean space , ignoring the issues discuss in ref .",
    "@xcite , can be written as @xmath6 where the 4@xmath71 spinor @xmath8 is the fermion field with @xmath9 being the flavor indices .",
    "based on lorentz structure analysis , the inverse fermion propagator in the chiral limit can be written as @xmath10 one assumes that dressed fermion propagator at finite @xmath3 ( @xmath11 ) is analytic in the neighborhood of @xmath12 , so the @xmath11 can be written as @xmath13 where @xmath14 .",

    "the first one is the bare vertex .",
    "this structure plays the most dominant role in the full fermion - photon vertex in high energy region and the full fermion - photon vertex reduces to it in large momentum limit .",

    "previous works @xcite show that the numerical results of dses employing this @xmath0as is as good as that employing bc and cp vertex @xcite .",

    "@xcite , if @xmath39 is a solution of the gap equation in the chiral limit , then so is @xmath41 .",
    "while these two solutions are distinct , the chiral symmetry entails that each yields the same pressure . in the chiral limit ,",
    "the two dynamical symmetry breaking solutions are symmetric about the wigner solution @xmath42 .",
    "however , just as will be shown below , this might be changed when the fermion mass is not zero .",
    "our next task is to solve for the two scalar functions @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "these two functions can be obtained by numerically solving the three coupled integral equations eqs .",
    "( [ e11]-[p11 ] ) .",

    "1 , it is easy to find that all the three scalar functions in the dcsb phase ( @xmath49 ) are constant in the infrared region , while in the ultraviolet region the vector function behaves as @xmath50 and the photon vacuum polarization behaves as @xmath51 .",
    "nevertheless , in contrast to the case of massless qed@xmath1 @xcite , in the large momentum region , the fermion self - energy reduces to the bare mass @xmath3 in eq .",

    "since all the three functions are positive in the whole range of @xmath52 , we define them as the `` + '' solution .     at n=1 as a function of @xmath3 ( @xmath53 represents the `` + '' solution and @xmath54 represents the `` - '' solution).,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=39.0% ] +    if we do interation starting from @xmath55 and @xmath47 , we can obtain another stable solution .",
    "the typical behaviors of the three functions in the dcsb phase for a fixed mass and number of fermion flavors are also plotted in fig .",
    "[ fg1 ] ( the dotted line ) . from fig .",
    "[ fg1 ] , we see that the dses for the fermion propagator has two distinct nonzero solutions .",
    "especially , the infrared value of the fermion self - energy is negative , so we define it as the `` - '' solution . in the low energy region ,",
    "each of the three functions in the second solution is also almost constant , but it is different from the corresponding one in the `` + '' solution . as @xmath52 or @xmath56 increases , each function of the `` - '' solution approach to the corresponding one of the `` + '' solution .    to reveal the difference between these two solutions , we consider @xmath3 as a continuous parameter in the dses .",
    "we plot the infrared value of @xmath57 in fig .",

    "when @xmath3 reaches its critical value , we obtain only one solution for dses .",
    "in addition , from fig . [ fg2 ] , it can be seen that the critical mass exists for any truncated scheme of dses used in this work .",
    "furthermore , we investigate the influence of the number of fermion flavors on the critical mass .     +    by employing ansatze 2 , we can obtain the relation between the critical mass and the number of fermion flavors and it is plotted in fig .",
    "we observe that the critical mass decreases as @xmath5 increases and it vanishes at @xmath65 , which is similar to the critical number of fermion flavors for dcsb in the chiral limit @xcite .",
    "to summarize , in this paper , working in the framework of dyson - schwinger equations and employing a range of ansatze for the full fermion - photon vertex of qed@xmath1 , we study the interplay between explicit and dynamical chiral symmetry breaking in qed@xmath1 . in the case of nonzero fermion mass",
    ", it is found that , besides the ordinary solution , the fermions gap equation has another solution which has not been reported in the previous work of qed@xmath1 . in the low energy region",
    ", one observes that these two solutions are apparently different , but in the high energy region they coincide with each other .",
    "in addition , it is found that this solution exists only when the mass is smaller than a critical value .",
    "the critical mass decreases apparently with the rise of the number of fermion flavors and vanishes at a critical value @xmath66 , which corresponds to the critical number of fermion flavors of qed@xmath1 in the chiral limit .",
