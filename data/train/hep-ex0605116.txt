    "flavor violation or mixing among quarks has been known for many years and is beautifully described by the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa matrix in the standard model . on the other hand ,",
    "the discovery of flavor violation or oscillation among neutrinos came as a big surprise and provides a possible hint of new physics beyond the standard model .",
    "now lepton flavor violation ( lfv ) among charged leptons , which has never been observed , is attracting a great deal of attention , because its observation is highly expected by many of the well motivated theories and would undisputedly establish a breakdown of the standard model .",
    "an example of such lfv processes is schematically indicated in figure  [ fig : megloops ] .",
    "lfv is expected to occur in the loops of new physics processes at tev scale such as supersymmetry or extra dimensions .",
    "therefore the discovery of such a lfv process is of similar significance to that of the lhc .     in this example).,width=283 ]    on the other hand , the source of lfv originates from much higher energy scale governed by grand unification theories ( gut )  @xcite or seesaw models that predict heavy majorana neutrinos to derive tiny neutrino masses  @xcite , as indicated by the red loop in the figure .",
    "therefore the discovery and measurement of lfv processes could also provide hints of physics at extremely high energy scale , which would not be accessible even at the lhc .    in this article the present and future _",
    "experimental _ researches on lfv in charged leptons are reviewed .",
    "currently most actively studied lfv processes are the rare @xmath2 decays .",
    "@xmath2-pairs are abundantly produced at the b factories where the @xmath2-pair production cross section is as large as that of @xmath3 .",
    "the two b factory experiments , belle and babar , have accumulated more than @xmath4 @xmath2-pairs altogether .",
    "@xmath2-pair events are selected and tagged by one of the @xmath2s that decayed in the normal way and the @xmath2s on the other side are searched for lfv decays .",
    "a result of such analyses is shown in figure  [ fig : belle ] . as can be seen from this figure ,",
    "many of the searches are already beginning to be limited by background events . a more detailed description of various searches for lfv @xmath2 decays is given by dr .",
    "h.  kakuno in this conference  @xcite .",
    "they have made an impressive improvement on most of the lfv modes of the @xmath2 decays , though any of them has not been discovered yet .",
    "the 90% c.l .",
    "upper limits on their branching ratios are now in the order of @xmath5 , an order of magnitude improvement over the previous experiments ( mostly by cleo )  @xcite .",
    "these limits strongly constrain new physics models such as supersymmetry , especially for a large @xmath6 region and also for higgs - mediated lfv vertices .    for the future these limits should improve as the b factories continue to accumulate more data , but the improvements would be slow due to the background especially for some modes such as @xmath7/e@xmath1 , @xmath8 , etc . a super b factory with 510  ab@xmath9",
    "would bring them into the @xmath10 region , possibly even to @xmath11 for some modes , but claiming a discovery would be much harder with the existing background events .",
    "search by belle for 86.7  fb@xmath9 data , giving a 90% c.l .",
    "limit of @xmath12 .",
    "shown in yellow is the expected distribution for the signal while the points are the data .",
    "the background events are mostly @xmath2-pair events with large initial state radiation.,width=226 ]    preparatory studies on lfv @xmath2 decays are being conducted by the lhc experiments  @xcite . during their initial low luminosity runs ( 1030  fb@xmath9/year ) for 20082009 , a search for @xmath13 may be possible .",
    "@xmath2s are produced by the decays of w and z ( an order of @xmath14 @xmath2s per year ) and b ( @xmath15 @xmath2s ) . in order to be competitive , more abundant @xmath2s coming from d@xmath16",
    "decays ( @xmath17 @xmath2s / year ) are being investigated .",
    "a preliminary study indicates that efficient triggering of these @xmath2s would be very difficult because of the low @xmath18 ( less than a few gev ) of the decay muons .",
    "in a model independent approach , although many of the effective lfv four - fermion couplings involving @xmath2s are already strongly constrained by the lfv @xmath2 decay searches , there are some couplings that are still only loosely constrained  @xcite . for example",
    ", couplings involving heavy quarks can not be studied by the @xmath2 decays , because @xmath2s can not decay into heavy flavor hadrons .",
    "such couplings may be studied by using high intensity muon beam on a fixed target and looking for a conversion from muons to @xmath2s  @xcite .    in susy models",
    "such a muon to @xmath2 conversion could be enhanced by higgs mediation  @xcite . with the present limits on @xmath8 , @xmath19 , a maximum of @xmath20 conversion events are possible for @xmath21 incident 50  gev muons with a target thickness of @xmath22 g/@xmath23 , and more events for higher energy muons .",
    "in fact , above 60  gev , subprocesses involving b - quark component inside the target dominate and significantly increase the cross section .",
    "such a high intensity , high energy beam may be available in the future at a neutrino factory or a muon collider , or , for an electron to @xmath2 conversion , the international linear collider ( ilc ) .",
    "a preliminary study with a conceptual experimental design indicates that designing an experiment for a muon rate of @xmath24/sec / m@xmath25 would not be totally unfeasible but challenging and expensive  @xcite .",
    "as dr.a .  ceccucci also pointed out in this conference  @xcite , the ratio of the leptonic decays of kaons , @xmath26 , with theoretical uncertainties canceling in the ratio , was recently shown to be very sensitive to lfv couplings  @xcite . in susy models the lfv decay of kaon into an electron or a muon with a @xmath2 neutrino can be strongly enhanced by charged higgs mediation , while lf conserving susy effects do not contribute much .",
    "in fact a measurement with a 1% precision will lead to strong constraints on lfv vertices corresponding to upper limits on the lfv @xmath2 decays , @xmath27 or @xmath28 , i.e. exceeding even the super b factory sensitivity .",
    "the na48/2 experiment at cern recently presented their preliminary result of @xmath29 using their data taken in 2003  @xcite for the standard model prediction of @xmath30 , indicating a possible one - sigma deviation .",
    "the data statistics will be at least doubled with their 2004 data .",
    "the na48/2 collaboration now plans to take more data in 2007 to improve their measurements .",
    "the leptonic @xmath31 decay ratio , @xmath32 , also has a lfv sensitivity which is much smaller than @xmath33 by @xmath34 .",
    "two experimental programs , one at triumf and the other at psi , have been approved to investigate possibilities to improve the present precision of 0.3% .",
    "well motivated theories of supersymmetric grand unification ( susy gut ) are very strongly constrained by the upper limits of the branching ratios of the lfv muon decays , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 conversion on a nucleus .",
    "therefore any improvement in experimental sensitivities to these decays could possibly lead to a discovery of susy gut signals .    assuming the standard gauge ( photon ) mediated couplings , physics sensitivity of @xmath35 is 300400 times higher than that of @xmath36 conversion , depending on the conversion target nuclei .",
    "thus a branching ratio sensitivity of @xmath37 for @xmath35 corresponds to a @xmath38 @xmath36 conversion sensitivity .",
    "while an experimental search for @xmath35 is mainly limited by accidental coincidence of background events , prompt backgrounds from muon beams are major obstacles in a @xmath36 conversion experiment .",
    "consequently a dc muon beam is best suited to a @xmath35 search to minimize accidental overlap . on the other hand ,",
    "a pulsed beam is utilized to reduce prompt background in a @xmath36 conversion search .",
    "there is another interesting decay mode , @xmath03e , which , assuming the gauge - mediated couplings , has a roughly 100 times smaller branching ratio than @xmath35 .",
    "its major experimental limits come from accidental overlaps of background events . at the moment",
    "there is no experimental program , present or planned , for this decay mode .    in the following the status and prospects of the experimental programs to search for @xmath35 and @xmath36 conversion",
    "are briefly summarized .",
    "the present best limit on the @xmath36 conversion is given by the sindrum - ii experiment at psi .",
    "figure  [ fig : sindrum2 ] shows their final result on gold target , giving a 90% c.l .",
    "limit of @xmath39  @xcite .",
    "as seen in the bottom figure , a class of events in coincidence with the 20  nsec beam pulse contain a lot more background .",
    "the meco experiment , proposed at bnl to achieve a @xmath40 sensitivity by using a graded field solenoid to collect as much pions as possible at the production target , was unfortunately cancelled by the u.s .",
    "funding agency in 2005 .",
    "prism ( phase - rotated intense slow muons ) is an ambitious project to produce high intensity negative muon beam with narrow energy spread and much less @xmath31 contamination , proposed to be built at the j - parc 50  gev proton ring that is currently under construction at tokai , japan  @xcite .",
    "its schematic layout is shown , together with the proposed @xmath36 conversion experiment prime , in figure  [ fig : prism ] . a fixed - field alternating gradient synchrotron ( ffag )",
    "is used to carry out  phase rotation , \" i.e. a conversion of an original short pulse beam with wide momentum spread ( @xmath41  % ) into a long pulse beam with narrow momentum spread ( @xmath42  % ) by strong rf field .",
    "after 5 turns in the ffag ring for the phase rotation , pions in the beam all decay out . given @xmath43 protons / sec from the j - parc ring , the prism facility should be able to provide @xmath15 - @xmath17 muons / sec , which might enable a @xmath36 conversion sensitivity down to @xmath44 .",
    "there are still several r&d items to study : for example , low energy pion production and capture system , and injection / extraction of muons into / from the ffag ring .",
    "a real - size ffag ring is being constructed at osaka university for r&d studies .",
    "the schedule of the project is unknown as it is not funded yet .        in conclusion",
    "there is no active or approved experiment for a @xmath36 conversion search at the moment .",
    "the meg experiment  @xcite , a @xmath35 search experiment , currently being prepared at the paul scherrer institute ( psi ) in switzerland , was proposed by the japanese physicists and has since evolved to an international collaboration among japan , italy , switzerland , russia , and the u.s.a .",
    "the experiment is scheduled to be ready for physics run towards the end of 2006 and aims at a sensitivity of @xmath37 , two orders of magnitude below the present limit of @xmath45  @xcite .",
    "e5 beam line at psi . from upstream ( bottom ) to downstream ( top ) are the dc separator , the quadrupole magnets ( red ) , the superconducting muon transport magnet , and the cobra magnet with ring - shaped compensation coils.,width=283 ]    the experimental set - up is schematically shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : meg ] .",
    "a dc surface muon beam of a few times @xmath46/sec is focused and stopped in a thin plastic target .",
    "gamma rays from @xmath35 decays are measured by liquid xenon scintillation detector located just outside a very thin solenoidal magnet called cobra .",
    "positrons are tracked by low material drift chambers inside cobra which provides specially graded magnetic field .",
    "their timings are measured by plastic scintillation counters in the second turn of their trajectories .    the unprecedented sensitivity of the meg experiment has been made possible by the three key components : ( 1 ) the highest intensity dc surface muon beam available at psi ; ( 2 ) a specially designed cobra positron spectrometer with graded magnetic field ; and ( 3 ) an innovative liquid xenon scintillation gamma ray detector .",
    "these key components are described in some detail in the following .",
    "the 590mev proton cyclotron at psi , constantly operating with a beam current exceeding 1.8ma and a total beam power of more than 1  mw , is able to produce the highest intensity dc muon beam in the world .",
    "this is the best and only place suitable for a @xmath35 experiment .",
    "the @xmath31e5 beam line for the meg experiment is shown in figure  [ fig : meg_beamline ] .",
    "the superconducting solenoidal magnet is used to transport and focus the beam onto a small target ( a few @xmath47 ) .",
    "a dc separator is placed to reject unwanted positrons in the beam .",
    "a muon rate of @xmath14/sec has been already demonstrated so that more than @xmath48 stopped muons per year is reasonably expected .",
    "the cobra ( constant bending radius ) positron spectrometer  @xcite consists of a superconducting solenoidal magnet designed to form a special graded magnetic field ( 1.27  t at the center and 0.49  t at the both ends ) , in which positrons with the same absolute momenta follow trajectories with a constant projected bending radius , independent of the emission angles over a wide angular range .",
    "this allows to sharply discriminate high momentum signal positrons ( @xmath49mev/@xmath50 ) out of @xmath51@xmath14 michel positrons emitted every second from the target .",
    "only high momentum positrons enter the drift chamber volumes .",
    "the graded field also helps to sweep away curling tracks quickly out of the tracking volume , thereby reducing accidental pile - up of the michel positrons .",
    "high strength al stabilized conductor is used to make the magnet as thin as 0.197@xmath52 , so that 85% of 52.8mev/@xmath50 gamma rays traverse the magnet without interaction before entering the @xmath1 ray detector placed outside the magnet .",
    "a he - free , simple and easy operation of the magnet is realized with a gm refrigerator . as the cobra magnet",
    "does not have a return yoke , a pair of compensation coils ( seen as large rings in figure  [ fig : meg_beamline ] ) suppress the stray magnetic field below 50  gauss in the vicinity of the gamma ray detector , so that the photomultiplier tubes can operate .",
    "ray detector .",
    "the cryostat ( left ) and the support structure for the photomultiplier tubes inside the cryostat ( right).,width=302 ]    an innovative liquid xenon ( lxe ) scintillation detector was specially devised for this experiment to make very precise measurements of energy , position and timing of gamma rays .",
    "the detector holds an active lxe volume of 800  @xmath53 .",
    "scintillation light emitted inside lxe are viewed from all sides by approximately 850 photomultiplier tubes ( pmts ) that are immersed in lxe in order to maximize direct light collection .",
    "high light yield of lxe ( roughly 75% of nai ) and its uniformity are necessary ingredients for good energy resolution .",
    "a scintillation pulse from xenon is very fast and has a short tail , thereby minimizing the pile - up problem .",
    "distributions of the pmt outputs enable a measurement of the incident position of the gamma ray with a few mm accuracy .",
    "the position of the conversion point is also estimated with an accuracy that corresponds to a timing resolution of about 50  psec .",
    "various studies were carried out using a 100  @xmath53 prototype detector in order to gain practical experiences in operating such a new device and to prove its excellent performance .",
    "pmts that work at the lxe temperature ( -110@xmath54c ) , high power pulse tube refrigerators for lxe , a liquid phase purification method to remove possible impurities that absorb scintillation light , a calibration method using wire @xmath55 sources , etc .",
    "have been developed  @xcite .",
    "several gamma ray beam tests demonstrated its excellent performance which is necessary to achieve the sensitivity goal of the experiment .",
    "the meg detectors are currently being constructed and are scheduled to be ready later in the year 2006 .",
    "it is expected to take @xmath56 years with a muon beam of a few@xmath57/sec to reach a 90% c.l .",
    "sensitivity of @xmath58 with an expected background of 0.5 events .",
    "lfv in charged leptons is a clean and clear signal of new physics beyond the standard model .",
    "it not only evidences new physics at tev scale , such as supersymmetry or extra dimensions , but also provides hints of physics at extremely high energies , such as grand unification of forces that might have triggered inflation of the universe , or heavy majorana neutrinos that might be the origin of matter .",
    "the b factory experiments have greatly improved and will further improve the limits on the lfv @xmath2 decays but are now starting to suffer background events . in parallel interesting limits may be provided by the measurement of the leptonic kaon decays and the lhc experiments could also contribute in their initial low luminosity phase .    in the absence of funded projects for @xmath36 conversion searches , it is hoped that a sensible experiment be designed and started by international collaboration , before the ambitious prism facility may be eventually realized .",
    "finally , the meg experiment is expected to be ready toward the end of 2006 and could come across such a charming event as shown in figure  [ fig : meg_event ] at any time during the next few years .",
    "so stay tuned .",
