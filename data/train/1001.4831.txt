    "there is considerable interest in low - frequency noise ( see , e.g. , the review in ref .  [ ] and references therein ) , because this type of noise limits the coherence of qubits based on superconducting devices such as flux or phase qubits @xcite .",

    "have been widely discussed @xcite .",
    "so it is an interesting topic to investigate the quantum zeno effect of a qubit coupled to a low - frequency bath .",
    "the description of low - frequency noise @xcite ( such as 1/f noise ) is complicated by the presence of long - time correlations in the fluctuating environment , which prohibit the use of the markovian approximation .",
    "in addition , the rotating wave approximation ( rwa ) is also unavailable in an environment with multiple modes . in the case of a time - depend external field for a qubit",
    "coupled to a thermal bath , kofman and kurizki developed a theory @xcite which considers the counter - rotating terms of the fast modulation field through the negative - frequency part @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) in the bath - correlation function spectrum .",
    "the dynamics in two significant models ( the spin - boson model with ohmic bath , and a qubit coupled to a bath of two level fluctuators ) have been calculated within a rigorous born approximation and without the markovian approximation prb-71 - 035318,prb-79 - 125317 .",
    "[ ] and [ ] describe the structure of the solutions in the complex plane with branch cuts and poles .    here",
    "we present an analytical approach , based on a unitary transformation .",
    "we use neither the markovian approximation nor the rwa in order to discuss the transient dynamics of a qubit coupled to its environment .",
    "this method has already been used @xcite to study the decoherence of the ohmic bath , sub - ohmic bath , and structured bath . in this paper",
    ", we calculate the coherence dynamics of the qubit ( with and without measurement ) respectively in two kinds of baths . besides producing an energy shift , the environment can change the decay rate of the qubit . to preserve the coherence",
    ", we also investigate the decay rate of the qubit subject to the quantum zeno effect .",
    "the low - frequency noise uses a lorentzian - type spectrum with the peak of the spectrum in the low - energy region and for the high - frequency noise we choose the ordinary ohmic bath with drude cutoff .",
    "our results show that for _ low_-frequency noise , the qubit energy increases ( blue shift ) and an anti - zeno effect takes place . for a _",
    "high_-frequency cutoff ohmic bath , the qubit energy decreases ( red shift ) and the zeno effect dominates . for a high - frequency environment",
    ", the decay rate should be faster ( without measurements ) or slower ( with frequent measurements , in the zeno regime ) , compared to the low - frequency bath case .",
    "the experimental implementation of our results here could distinguish the type of bath ( either a low- or high - frequency one ) and protect the coherence of the qubit by modulating the dominant frequency of its environment .",
    "the coherence dynamics without measurement also indicates that the coherence time of the low - frequency noise is longer than the high - frequency noise , which demonstrates the powerful temporal memory of the low - frequency bath and stem from non - markov process of qubit - bath interaction within the bath memory time@xcite .",
    "we describe a qubit coupled to a boson bath , modeling the environment , by the hamiltonian @xmath2the boson bath and the spin-@xmath3 ( fluctuators ) bath will have the same dissipative effect on the qubit at zero temperature , @xmath4 if both baths have the same correlation function @xcite .",
    "however , for finite temperatures , the spin bath has a smaller effect on the qubit because of the likely saturation of the populations in the spin bath . here ,",
    "for simplicity , we only consider the case of zero temperature .",

    "the effect of the bath on the qubit mainly comes from the frequencies higher than the excited - state energy  of the qubit . then ( as seen in fig .",
