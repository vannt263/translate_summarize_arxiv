    "i explore a mechanism which allows one to modify gauge theories in general and general relativity in particular without introducing additional propagating degrees of freedom .",
    "the modification has the effect of altering the local gauge transformations the theory is invariant under , so this mechanism is aptly dubbed``symmetry trading '' .",
    "this will result in identifying two theories , each of which can be seen as a gauge fixing of the other .",
    "more precisely , the two theories each possess a first class constraint such that one is the gauge fixing of the other .",
    "this mechanism was first defined in ( @xcite ) in the context of hamiltonian general relativity and through it , a theory known as shape dynamics was discovered .",
    "this theory is one where the many fingered time re - foliation invariance which is manifest in the arnowitt - deser - misner formalism of hamiltonian general relativity ( @xcite ) is gauge fixed by using a preferred foliation .",
    "this is a foliation of spacetime by space - like hyper surfaces of constant mean curvature ( cmc ) .",
    "then the theory is invariant under foliation preserving diffeomorphisms and local weyl transformations that act only on the spatial hyper surfaces of the foliation as gauge symmetries .",
    "so what is getting ` traded ' is the local re - foliation invariance invariance of general relativity for the local spatial weyl invariance of shape dynamics . for an up to date review of the theory of shape dynamics",
    "see ( @xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "shape dynamics allows us to view the dynamics of general relativity though the evolution of spatial three - geometries , and this is dual to the conventional adm formalism thanks to the symmetry trading mechanism .",
    "it then behooves us to ponder how robust this procedure is , and whether it could be applied to different approaches to the dynamics of general relativity itself .    in particular ,",
    "despite the many uses of the adm formalism , it fails to work in scenarios where the relevant dynamical hyper surfaces are null .",
    "the primary difficulty in this setting comes from the degeneracy of the three metric adapted onto the null surface which amongst other things makes the embedding relations difficult to deal with .",
    "nevertheless , these difficulties that arise are most easily circumvented by employing a foliation by co - dimension 2 space - like surfaces at the intersection of two null hyper - surfaces each of co - dimension 1 .",
    "this setting shall be called the ( 2 + 2 ) double null embedding formalism .",
    "the merits of this formalism include providing a natural setting for studying black hole and apparent horizons ( @xcite , @xcite ) , and is relevant in the context of light - front quantisation @xcite and the bousso bound ( @xcite ) .",
    "the application which shall be of primary concern to us here will be its utility in the analysis of the characteristic initial value problem for general relativity .",
    "i will elucidate this in subsection 1.3 below . in short ,",
    "this formalism is arguably most efficient in allowing one to isolate the true propagating degrees of freedom of general relativity in the full non linear context .",
    "these are in terms of the freely specifiable shear tensors on the initial null hyper - sufaces , and allows one to uniquely determine the solution to the einstein equations in the vicinity of these null surfaces . in all that will follow , i shall assume that the spacetime is four dimensional for definiteness .      in the following essay , i will use the @xmath3 signature convention . for concreteness , i implicitly assume there are four spacetime dimensions although this shall not be a necessary condition for the work that follows .",
    "greek letters @xmath4 shall run from 0 to 3 , capital latin indices @xmath5 will the values @xmath6 or @xmath7 to denote the two null directions and lowercase latin indices @xmath8 will run from @xmath9 and these are spatial indices .",
    "i will denote covariant derivatives as @xmath10 ( the @xmath11 denotes an arbitrary index ) , partial derivatives as @xmath12 and lie derivatives with respect to an arbitrary vector field @xmath13 as @xmath14 .      in this section i will review some rudimentary facts about a compact two dimensional space like surfaces living in four dimensional spacetime with metric @xmath15 . as i ll show",
    ", this will be useful in understanding the situation where spacetime is foliated by such surfaces , which will be the subject of study in the next section .",
    "the two dimensional surface @xmath16 , in spacetime is ` located ' at the intersection of space like and time - like hyper surfaces @xmath17 , @xmath18 respectively , both of which are three dimensional as shown in figure 1 .",
    "is at the intersection of the time - like surface @xmath18 and space like surface @xmath17 of co - dimension 1 ]    this means that the space of normal vectors at a point @xmath19 , which is denoted as to @xmath16 ] @xmath21 has one space like and one timeline direction .",
    "this means the signature of @xmath22 is @xmath23 .",
    "so a natural basis of vectors that span this space is the orthonormal basis of vectors @xmath24 where @xmath25 is time - like and @xmath26 is space like : @xmath27 this choice is by no means unique , because these directions can be changed by boosts in an arbitrary direction normal to @xmath16 which will lead to a new pair of basis vectors @xmath28 @xmath29 and we can check that the conditions @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 are still satisfied .",
    "although by introducing global foliations of spacetime by such time - like and space - like hyper surfaces , this ambiguity could be fixed .",
    "but the route i will follow is to find what best can be done with whatever i have introduced above to find a slightly more unique prescription of a basis on @xmath21 .",
    "recall that the @xmath23 signature that @xmath21 has implies that it possesses two null directions .",
    "this translates to having a null basis formed by the vectors @xmath33 defined as @xmath34 it is then easy to see that @xmath35 so it is certainly true that both @xmath36 and @xmath37 are null but they are nowhere parallel to each other .",
    "figure 2 demonstrates the effect of change in basis .",
    "possesses two null directions ]    now , the transformation properties for @xmath25 and @xmath26 under boosts translate into the following transformation properties for the null basis vectors @xmath36 and @xmath37 : @xmath38 and so we see that the null vectors only change by a rescaling , and the null directions themselves remain invariant .",
    "a reasonable question to ask at this point is how the picture where @xmath16 is located at the intersection between the space like surface @xmath17 and the time - like surface @xmath18 changes with this change of basis .",
    "the answer is that @xmath16 can alternatively located at the intersection of two null hyper surfaces @xmath39 and @xmath40 to which @xmath36 and @xmath37 are tangent , as is shown in figure 3 .     and",
    "@xmath40 of co - dimension 1 intersect at @xmath16 ]    note that if @xmath36 and @xmath37 are tangential to @xmath39 and @xmath40 respectively , they are also normal to these hyper - surfaces .",
    "this fact simply follows from the fact that @xmath41 so these vectors are orthogonal to themselves .",
    "intuitively , what this picture is telling us is that the space - like surface @xmath16 is seen to be situated at the intersection of a bundle of light - rays going into and emanating from it .",
    "these bundles of light rays are null geodesic congruences , which as we shall see in the following subsection , are the null hyper surfaces @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "now consider spacetime foliated by such space - like two surfaces .",
    "namely , a two parameter family of such surfaces all located at the intersection of two null hyper surfaces of dimension three .",
    "this is what is known as the double null foliation .",
    "i will show how we can upgrade the previous subsection s treatment of a single space - like surface into a foliation of spacetime by such intersecting null surfaces .",
    "alternatively , the double null foliation is mathematically described using a set of embedding relations which allow us to make the following identification : @xmath42 here @xmath43 is a scalar function whose level sets are the null hyper surfaces @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 are co - ordinates on the intersection of any two null surfaces at @xmath47 . the superscript @xmath48 here is meant to denote that there is a two parameter family of these null hyper surfaces which form the foliation .",
    "figure 4 aids in visualising this situation for two leaves of the foliation .",
    "i will return to the physical interpretation of @xmath49 as initial value hyper surfaces in the following subsection .",
    "the null character of the @xmath49 hyper surfaces is seen by noting that : @xmath50 here , @xmath51 . we can use this as a metric to raise and lower the capital latin indices .",
    "what is meant by saying that the null character of the hyper surfaces is captured by this equation can be seen by identifying the normal vectors to these hyper surfaces through @xmath52    in other words , list of conditions may well be summarised as @xmath53 where the dot denotes contraction of the spacetime indices using the metric @xmath54 .        to make the connection with quantities identified in the previous subsection , we see that per leaf of the foliation : @xmath55 the only reason i introduce the vectors @xmath56 in this manner is to expose the quantity @xmath57 which",
    ", as we will see , is a dynamical variable .",
    "also @xmath58 measures said deviation of these vectors from being parallel .",
    "a further consequence of these properties is that there exists a complementary description of this setting in terms of a congruence of null geodesics .",
    "this can be seen by noting that the null vectors @xmath56 themselves satisfy a geodesic equation of the form @xmath59 and as is evident from the non zero right hand side , the parameterisation of these geodesics are nt in general affine .",
    "the parameter @xmath60 is known as the ` in - affinity ' and as the name suggests , it measures the deviation from affinity of the parameterisation of the geodesics .",
    "if we return to the definition of the normal vectors in terms of derivatives of the optical functions @xmath61 we see that an alternative definition of the in - affinity parameter can be given as @xmath62 .",
    "exploiting this fact , we can alternatively think of the normals as the generators of the null hyper surfaces .",
    "another quantity of interest is the so called normalised twist vector which is defined as @xmath63_{a},\\ ] ] where @xmath64 $ ] denotes the lie brackets .",
    "geometrically , it measures the failure of integrability in the sense of frobenius theorem of the time like hyperplanes orthogonal to the intersection of the null surfaces .",
    "closely related quantities which are also convenient to name for future reference are : @xmath65 and @xmath66 . briefly shifting our attention to the intrinsic geometry of the space like surfaces , we first define the following dyad : @xmath67 through which one may define an intrinsic metric on the space like surface through @xmath68 the orthogonality of the normal vectors to @xmath16 implies @xmath69 this , in addition to the fact that @xmath70 , @xmath71 , implies that @xmath72 the vectors @xmath73 are called the ` shift ' vectors and the above condition aptly highlights their geometric role in propagating the co - ordinatization of the space like ` cross sections ' of the null hyper surfaces to which they are tangential everywhere , as we move along the direction of the generators .",
    "now we can suitably write down the entire decomposition of the spacetime metric adapted to this foliation as follows @xmath74 so , component wise , i summarise the decomposition as follows :    @xmath75 @xmath76 @xmath77 to conclude our discussion of the intrinsic geometry of the space like surfaces , note that we can find the intrinsic spin connection @xmath78 and curvature two form @xmath79 using the cartan structure equations : @xmath80 and so the intrinsic riemann curvature tensor of @xmath16 can then be found : @xmath81 from this , we can then deduce the intrinsic ricci tensor @xmath82 and the scalar curvature @xmath83 .",
    "i will now return to quantities pertinent to the extrinsic geometry of the space like intersection of the null surfaces embedded in spacetime .",
    "first i introduce some notation .",
    "i will denote the lie derivative of functions , vectors and tensors living on @xmath16 restricted onto @xmath16 , i.e. pulled back onto the two surfaces as follows @xmath84 here @xmath85 denotes the operation of projecting everything to its right onto @xmath16 through the dyads @xmath86 defined through @xmath87 .",
    "the extrinsic curvature of the space like two surfaces is given in terms of the time derivatives of the metric as one would expect : @xmath88 and the shear is defined as the traceless part of the same : @xmath89 the expansion scalar for the null congruences is given by @xmath90    the einstein hilbert action reads @xmath91 it would also be useful to note that the boundary terms in the lagrangian are : @xmath92 note that although we try and remain democratic with both null directions by using the uppercase latin index , if we wish to understand evolution , i will treat one of the null directions as though it were a space like direction and the other is considered ` time ' .",
    "the momenta conjugate to the two metric can be identified as @xmath93 @xmath94 and taking the trace of the above we find that @xmath95 i will repeatedly use this relation in the future . in the forthcoming section , i will move beyond the kinematical description of this foliation and attempt to demonstrate its utility in terms of simplifying the dynamics of general relativity through the solution of the characteristic initial value problem .",
    "the following construction will seem slightly more intricate than the more conventional 3 + 1 split of spacetime into space like surfaces but the advantage will be that it is relatively simple to impose gauge fixing conditions .",
    "the evolution problem is rendered free , whereas data specified on a space like hyper surface needs to satisfy a set of elliptic constraints that are in general difficult to solve .",
    "what i will sketch in this subsection is what such gauge fixing conditions are and what initial data to specify and where to do so in order to uniquely determine the solution to the vacuum einstein equations in a neighbourhood of a pair of intersecting null hyper surfaces .",
    "this was first achieved by sachs in ( @xcite ) . in this subsection",
    "however , i shall closely follow the exposition of the solution to the characteristic initial value problem presented in ( @xcite ) .    without loss of generality",
    ", i can choose @xmath96 to be the ` time ' and so @xmath97 is the initial hyper surface and @xmath98 is the ` boundary ' .",
    "then the normalised vector fields @xmath99 and @xmath100 are such that they satisfy @xmath101 @xmath102 recall the normalization condition : @xmath103 the local coordinates on the space like plane @xmath16 should be convected along either null direction , so the gauge fixing conditions that ensure this are given by setting on @xmath104 @xmath105 , and setting @xmath106 to zero everywhere .",
    "furthermore , we can fix the normalisation of the vector fields by choosing @xmath107 or some other condition that fixes @xmath57 .",
    ", at least locally . ]    with this , i can now write @xmath108 @xmath109 then the conditions @xmath110=0=[\\partial_{u^{0}},\\partial_{a}]$ ] imply that @xmath111=\\frac{\\partial s_{1}^{a}}{\\partial u^{0}}\\partial_{a}.\\ ] ] thus we see that @xmath112 and although we have placed a lot of gauge fixing conditions to arrive at this expression , we note that this expression generalises to an equivalent definition of @xmath113 even in the gauge unfixed case , and this is @xmath114 see ( @xcite ) for a derivation of this relation .",
    "the gauge fixed , preferred double null foliation is now defined as the pair of families of intersecting null hyper surfaces given by @xmath115 now i will sketch the answer to the second question which is what data need be specified and where in order to uniquely determine the solution to the einstein field equations .",
    "first , on @xmath16 the functions @xmath116 need be specified .",
    "then we see that the condition @xmath107 propagates the choice of @xmath57 and fixes it along the entire surfaces @xmath104 and @xmath117 .",
    "we then need to specify @xmath118 this is equivalent to specifying the conformal two metric on these surfaces .",
    "these shear rates are the two physical degrees of freedom of the gravitational field . in all that shall follow",
    "i will try and exploit the fact that the conformal two metric or the conformally covariant shear rates on null surfaces encode the physical gravitational degrees of freedom , or in other words , the nonlinear generalisation of the graviton modes .",
    "we then use the dynamical equations @xmath119 to propagate @xmath120 and @xmath113 along the whole of @xmath117 .",
    "more explicitly , these two equations read ( assuming the condition @xmath107 has already been imposed ) @xmath121 @xmath122 notice that these are both first order differential equations for the quantities @xmath120 and @xmath113 . the two constraint equations @xmath123 similarly propagate these functions onto the whole initial value surface @xmath104 .",
    "then , the dynamical equation @xmath124 determines @xmath125 as a function of @xmath126 on @xmath44 for some @xmath48 . for data determined by the solutions to the previous constraint and evolution equations , and the boundary value of @xmath125 on @xmath104 ,",
    "these first order ordinary differential equations can be solved uniquely and in all , the solution to the vacuum field equations can be uniquely determined within a neighbourhood of these surfaces as initially advertised .      in this section",
    "i will discuss properties of the theory of a scalar field conformally coupled to general relativity , this theory is also known as dilaton gravity . to attain its action ,",
    "i use the fact that the lagrangian can be obtained form the einstein ",
    "hilbert lagrangian as : @xmath127\\rightarrow\\tilde{l}[e^{2\\varphi}g_{\\mu\\nu}],\\ ] ] where @xmath128 is the scalar field .",
    "the resulting action is : @xmath129 aside from diffeomorphism invariance this action also possesses invariance under conformal transformations of the form @xmath130 ; @xmath131 .",
    "this implies for the two metric : @xmath132",
    "so : @xmath133 the canonical conjugate of the scalar field can also be identified straightforwardly as follows : @xmath134 so we find that , @xmath135 which can be paraphrased as a constraint @xmath136 all we need to do now is to simply work out how every object in the action decomposed in terms of variables adapted to the foliation transforms under @xmath137 which will then be the same as the action for the conformally coupled scalar decomposed in this manner .",
    "first we will need to understand how the normals transform under this rescaling .",
    "what guides us in the case where the hyper surface is not null to make this prescription is to demand that the normals still remain normalised , i.e. @xmath138 , and knowing how @xmath139 transforms tells us that @xmath140 . given that now the normals are null , which means that @xmath141 , the vector @xmath142 can scale neutrally , i.e. @xmath143 . however ,",
    "since @xmath57 defined as @xmath144 is indeed considered dynamical in this formalism , we can find how it is to rescale : @xmath145 and so @xmath146 in a similar manner we also find that @xmath147 recalling the definition of the normalised twist , it is nt hard to see that @xmath148 and so we also know how @xmath149 transform . with this",
    "we can write @xmath150.\\ ] ] so far my discussion has pertained to mathematical properties of the theory described by the action ( [ eq : cdg ] ) , but i now wish to ask the question : under what circumstances can we regain general relativity from this theory ?",
    "the standard answer is fairly simple and it is to consider gr as a _ phase wherein _ @xmath151 .",
    "this is to be thought of as a broken symmetry phase as it is nt preserved under weyl transformations mentioned above which are a symmetry of the dilaton action .",
    "the scalar field seen in this light can be thought of as an auxiliary ` spurion ' field that compensates for the metric s weyl transformation . and",
    "the trick we used to transform the variables associated to the einstein hilbert action to find the ones associated to the dilaton action is the stuckleberg mechanism .",
    "obviously , if one wishes to return to the original description of the theory undoing such a transformation , setting @xmath128 to zero is the easiest means to do so .",
    "but we also see that there is a tension with symmetry in this procedure which is justified by the fact that general relativity is not weyl invariant .",
    "the question then is , can there be a means to try and retain weyl invariance and a notion of equivalence with general relativity ?",
    "i.e. is there a description of the dynamics of the theory which still retains some subset of the symmetries of the dilaton which are diffeomorphisms and local weyl transformations ? as we shall see in the coming sections , it turns out that it is indeed possible to do this by utilising the double null foliation for the canonical description of the theory , and the gauge invariances that will survive turns out to be diffeomorphisms of the co - dimension two hyperplanes and weyl transformations of the 2d metric on said planes .",
    "this shall however come at the cost of fixing a preferred null foliation , or in other words , singling out a specific manner to parameterise the null geodesics of the congruence of light rays generating the null hyper - sufaces .    in the following sections of the essay",
    ", i will demonstrate how this is achieved precisely . in order to do so it would be useful for me to introduce some tools to deal directly with the geometry of this theory s phase space which",
    ", as we shall see is the real arena of its classical dynamics .",
    "i would like to introduce some concepts pertaining to the geometry of phase space such as the symplectic form and constraint surfaces . as advertised in the previous section of this essay",
    ", this will be useful in understanding the symmetry trading mechanism and subsequent construction of the theory dual to general relativity in the double null foliation .",
    "this is the objective of the first subsection . in the second subsection",
    ", i will employ this machinery to introduce the symmetry trading algorithm .",
    "firstly , a convenient piece of mathematical machinery to introduce is the symplectic form .",
    "consider a field on spacetime , or more precisely in a region @xmath152 in spacetime , with an action @xmath153=\\int_{m}\\textrm{d}^{4}xl[\\phi],\\ ] ] where @xmath154 $ ] is the so called lagrangian density , and here , we consider it a local functional on the space of solutions to the classical field equations .",
    "the variation of the action will have terms proportional to the euler lagrange equations given as follows @xmath155 @xmath156 is the surface element on the boundary .",
    "the first term vanishes by virtue of the equations of motion being satisfied and the second boundary term can be identified as the so called ` symplectic current ' when evaluated on the space of solutions , this defines a one form on the space of solutions to the field equations , namely .",
    "@xmath157 the boundary of the four dimensional region where we consider the variation of the action in @xmath152 shall be denoted @xmath158 and it is not necessarily a null surface .",
    "the functional exterior derivative of the current is the so called symplectic form which is a two form on the space of solutions to the field equations : @xmath159 @xmath160 , so it is a closed two form on the space of solutions . in the previous subsection we put some effort into understanding",
    "how the specification of fields and their derivatives on initial value hyper surfaces uniquely determine the solution to the field equations ( locally in our case of the double null foliation ) .",
    "even more generally , the classical solutions to the field equations are in one to one correspondence with the values of the field and its derivatives on some initial value hyper surface . if we were to choose the hyper surface upon which the symplectic current is defined to be space like , then the normal component of the lagrangian s functional derivative with respect to the derivative of the field , i.e. @xmath161",
    ", is the momentum conjugate to the field . and from what we know of classical mechanics , the values of momenta and the positions for a system uniquely determines the solutions to the classical equations of motion .",
    "so in this framework we think of the space of solutions as the so called covariant phase space ( which i will call @xmath162 ) , on which the symplectic form is a natural object to study .",
    "this quantity is called covariant because the symplectic form does nt depend on the choice of the hyper surface upon which it is evaluated .",
    "so if we choose the hyper surface @xmath163 different from @xmath158 to try and find the symplectic form as we did above , then although the form of @xmath164 will be different , @xmath165    the symplectic current or potential inherits from the action the freedom of having added to it a total derivative .",
    "this is because the action is invariant under the addition of a total derivative and so the symplectic potential inherits this property as well .",
    "another way to see this is to note that the differential @xmath166 satisifies the property @xmath167 .",
    "so if we make the shift @xmath168 where @xmath169 is a arbitrary phase space function , then @xmath170 remains unaltered .",
    "a paradigmatic example of where this property can be used is to perform canonical transformations on phase space .",
    "we will use this later in the construction of the ` linking theory ' for the symmetry trading algorithm .      in this subsection , i will introduce what are known as first and second class constraints along with their geometrical interpretation .",
    "an issue of paramount importance is that the aforementioned two form can in general , and for gauge theories in particular be degenerate .",
    "the degenerate directions are associated to the gauge orbits of the theory . in a phase space framework ,",
    "gauge invariance of the theory manifests itself through the presence of first class constraints , which are functions @xmath171 of the fields and their momenta on the phase space .",
    "the constraint equation @xmath172 defines a constraint surface on the phase space . in order to understand better the geometry of such a surface",
    ", we need to introduce the notion of a hamiltonian vector field corresponding to a phase space function @xmath173 , which is a vector field @xmath174 on phase space such that it satisfies @xmath175 at this point , it will also be useful to introduce the related concept of poisson brackets @xmath176 , which mathematically can be seen by applying the sharp musical isomorphism to the symplectic form , i.e. @xmath177 in this manner , we can find @xmath178 corresponding to the constraints , and the first class property is the requirement that @xmath179 where @xmath180 are structure functions .",
    "the action of these vector fields on functions on the phase space is to be interpreted as the infinitesimal action of the gauge transformations to which they correspond .",
    "the fact that the degenerate directions of the symplectic form correspond to gauge orbits comes from the trivial observations that on the constraint surface @xmath181 this also tells us that the first class constraints are indeed surface forming , i.e. frobenius theorem ensures that the hyper surface they are tangent to ( the constraint surface @xmath172 ) is indeed a sub manifold of the phase space . strictly speaking ,",
    "the true , non degenerate symplectic form is that which arises from the pullback of @xmath170 , which we ought to call ` presympelctic ' on to the quotient of the phase space by these gauge orbits",
    ".    there also exist second class constraints that do not correspond to any gauge invariance of the theory and they are nt surface forming either .",
    "geometrically , if we find that a set of constraints @xmath182 is second class , it means @xmath183 where @xmath184 is an invertible matrix of phase space functions , then we dub the system @xmath185 a second class set .",
    "the concept of a constraint surface is also not suited for these constrains for their action can in general lead to having phase space functions flow off the physical subspace of the phase space , which is the same as the constraint surface of the first class set .",
    "more precisely , we find that no combination of the hamiltonian vector fields @xmath186 can be tangent to the surface defined by @xmath187 .",
    "this is because any vector field @xmath188 tangent to this surface would have to satisfy @xmath189 if @xmath190 , we then notice that @xmath191 and given that @xmath184 is invertible , we must have @xmath192 and that implies that @xmath193 .",
    "this automatically implies that the symplectic form pulled back to the surface defined by @xmath187 is certainly non degenerate .    to be able to explicitly write down a symplectic form , what we need to do is construct the so called dirac brackets , and apply onto them the flat isomorphism .",
    "the dirac brackets are given by @xmath194 note that here , repeated capital latin indices imply not only summation but also potentially integration . then , for any two vector fields @xmath195 @xmath196 an additional property of first class constraints is that they not only is their poisson algebra closed , but their brackets with second class constraints also close , or on the constraint surface : @xmath197 next , i ll show how this applies to situations we are interested in .",
    "returning to gravity in the double null foliation , the symplectic current associated to the action ( [ eq : dnac ] ) , is given as a sum of two terms : @xmath198 and similarly the presympelctic form is given by the exterior derivative of the same .",
    "more explicitly : @xmath199 this was derived by epp in @xcite . in this light ,",
    "the euler lagrange equation @xmath200 is actually a constraint that generates diffeomorphisms tangential to the space like hyperplane in disguise . to see this ,",
    "we first write it smeared against a vector field as : @xmath201 here @xmath202 then we find @xmath203^{a}\\frac{\\delta}{\\delta s_{b}^{a}}\\right\\ } \\\\ \\\\",
    "\\omega_{a}(x_{\\psi_{ba}(v^{a})},x_{\\psi_{ba}(v'^{a})})=\\delta\\theta_{a}(x_{\\psi_{ba}(v^{a})},x_{\\psi_{ba}(v'^{a})})=\\psi_{ba}([v , v']^{a}).\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] and so the first class property is made apparent .",
    "the @xmath204 constraints are of the form @xmath205 the hamiltonian vector field @xmath206corresponding to this constraint is defined in the standard manner .",
    "it is given by @xmath207 we see that its action on the two surface quantities such as @xmath208 , @xmath209 is given by @xmath210 @xmath211 intuitively solving the constraint equation @xmath212allows one to integrate up quantities defined on a section of a null surface onto the entire null surface , so this infinitesimal action ought to be expected . for quantities that are intrinsic to the cross section , the infinitesimal action of this constraint ought to generate normal deformations along the generators , as it apparently does .",
    "furthermore , we note that the constraint algebra closes as follows @xmath213 the geometrical role of this constraint is , as mentioned before , to generate normal deformations of quantities on the space like surface within the null hyper surface .",
    "the algebra of these constraints and their poisson brackets were first computed in ( @xcite ) in a hamiltonian context .",
    "if we take a step back and try to interpret our brief exposition of the solution to the characteristic initial value problem of general relativity in the previous subsection interpreting @xmath200 as a constraint , we see that that the sequence of gauge fixing conditions we imposed still leaves us with 2 dimensional covariance ( as one of the two constraints would remain unaffected by the gauge fixing condition @xmath214 ) .",
    "the evolution equations , assuming we deem the null direction along increasing @xmath96 as time , are @xmath215 and @xmath216 .",
    "their form although , is the same as the constant equations .",
    "so even with all the gauge fixing conditions we impose to turn general relativity into a theory of null evolution of the physical degrees of freedom , we are still left with a limited subset of the diffeomorphism invariance of the full theory .",
    "we finally have the tools to now understand the symmetry trading algorithm .",
    "i will closely follow the treatment in section 3 of ( @xcite ) where this technique was first developed .",
    "first , i begin by extending the phase space @xmath162 to a larger one @xmath217 which is the augmentation of the original phase space by auxiliary fields and their momenta .",
    "an example of such a field is the scalar field conformally coupled to gravity , which was discussed towards the end of the first section of this essay .    from our discussion of constraints in the previous subsection",
    ", it should be clear that in a theory that possesses gauge invariances , it is the constraint surface which is of physical importance .",
    "this is because it is upon the constraint surfaces that the admissible solutions to the classical equations of motion live , because by definition it is where the constraints are satisfied .",
    "i will denote the constraint surface @xmath218 .",
    "the reason for the subscript 1 will become apparent soon , and here , @xmath185 denotes a set of first class constraints .",
    "the hamiltonian vector fields @xmath186 generate the infinitesimal action of the gauge group @xmath219 on @xmath220 .",
    "the constraint surface is then isomorphic to a bundle @xmath221 over @xmath222 with isomorphism @xmath223 .",
    "the fibres of this bundle are the gauge orbits of a point @xmath224 under the action of @xmath219 , so they are isomorphic to @xmath225 , where @xmath226 denotes the isotropy group of the point @xmath227 . in this geometric setup ,",
    "a section @xmath228 of the bundle @xmath221 is the same as a gauge fixing of the first class constraints @xmath229 .",
    "gauge fixing conditions are a set of functions @xmath230 on @xmath217 s uch that the intersection of @xmath231 with @xmath220 coincides with @xmath229 .",
    "if we then demand that there exist structure functions @xmath232 such that @xmath233 , then the dual theory is defined as one which possesses @xmath230 as a first class constraint set .",
    "this means that we interpret @xmath234 as the generators of the infinitesimal action of some other gauge group @xmath235 on @xmath236 . as we saw with @xmath220",
    ", we can then define a bundle @xmath237 over @xmath238 whose fibres are @xmath239 .",
    "this bundle is isomorphic to @xmath236 with isomorphism @xmath240 .",
    "however , the sets @xmath241 and @xmath242 need nt necessarily be disjoint , but it is important that they are nt entirely identical .",
    "figure 7 illustrates the situation at hand .",
    "i would like to now make some comments on this construction .",
    "note that because we are using covariant phase space and we interpret the constraint surface as the space of admissible solutions to the classical equations of motion , we already see that the gauge fixing @xmath229 is implicitly preserved under the equations of motion .",
    "moreover , note that @xmath229 lies entirely within @xmath162 , prior to extension to @xmath217 , because it is a gauge orbit within the space of admissible solutions to the equations of motion of the original theory .",
    "the reason why the dual theory can be considered equivalent to the original theory is because it too contains @xmath229 within its constraint surface .",
    "this is another way of saying that both theories share a gauge fixing wherein the initial value problem and equations of motion are identical .",
    "but we also see that in order to construct a dual theory it was necessary to be able to augment @xmath162 by the phase space of auxiliary fields to obtain @xmath217 .",
    "although the common gauge fixing of the two theories , @xmath229 , and the constraint surface of the original theory @xmath220 lie entirely within @xmath162 , the constraint surface @xmath236 of the dual theory is not restricted to lie in @xmath162 , and in general it does nt .",
    "this is why the dual theory is more than just a gauge fixing condition of the original theory .",
    "the reason this procedure is named symmetry trading is because although the original and dual theories both share a gauge , the intersection of their constraint surfaces can be though of as the gauge fixing of different kinds of gauge invariances in either theory .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that the gauge groups @xmath219 and @xmath235 are distinct , as are the constraint sets @xmath185 and @xmath230 .",
    "so we can expect that upon application of this procedure to the situation we are interested in , which is that of general relativity in the double null foliation , we should expect to find a dual theory which possesses gauge symmetries that are not the same as those of general relativity , or more precisely , the residual gauge symmetries of the partially gauge fixed theory describing double null evolution .",
    "we shall see in the coming section that the gauge invariance of the null evolution problem that is foliation preserving diffeomorphism invariance will be enhanced by foliation preserving weyl transformations .",
    "the dual theory will be interpreted as a class of field configurations of a scalar field conformally coupled to gravity .",
    "in this section , i will present the trading mechanism applied to the case of general relativity in the double null foliation to obtain a dual theory , which , as we will see possesses weyl and diffeomorphism invariance which preserves the foliation .",
    "we will also see what the gauge fixing that needs to be applied here is for the trading to work , and what the geometrical interpretation of the preferred gauge choice is .",
    "the very first step we need to take before we can begin to apply the machinery developed in subsection 2.4 is to first extend the phase space of the theory by auxiliary fields @xmath128 and their momenta @xmath243 . and , as i mentioned before",
    ", this augmentation in the case we are interested in is by the phase space of the conformally coupled scalar field .",
    "first recall the observation made in subsection 1.5 regarding the field redefinitions to the gravity lagrangian one can make in order to attain the theory of a conformally coupled scalar field . to implement this redefiniton in phase space , we make the simple observation that if we were to consider a local change of co - ordinates on the phase space . in those local coordinates , if we write the symplectic potential as @xmath244 then @xmath245 then since @xmath167 , @xmath246 thus this is nothing more than a canonical transformation . now we wish to find explicitly a canonical transformation on the extended phase space of @xmath247 , where @xmath248 .",
    "it turns out that the variable @xmath249 generates a type two canonical transformation , and this is readily seen by first considering it smeared against a scalar function @xmath250 : @xmath251 then , @xmath252 where the variables that @xmath253 consists of are defined in the previous section .",
    "we define the hamiltonian vector field @xmath254 associated to @xmath255 through @xmath256 .",
    "given that this is a generating function , the correposnding hamiltonian vector field generates the infinitesimal version of this canonical trasnformation when applied to the various phase space variables as follows : @xmath257 here , @xmath258 .",
    "the action of the type 2 generating function @xmath259 on the phase space variables @xmath260 is thus : @xmath261 i will call this theory which lives in the extended phase space the linking theory .",
    "why this is a useful observation is that as advertised before , we now wish to find some analogue of the @xmath151 ` phase ' of the theory but one which possesses some subset of the weyl invariance of the dilaton action as well .",
    "such a phase will be given by : @xmath262 which is also a gauge fixing of the second class constraint above that leads to the first class constraint @xmath263 the infinitesimal action of this constraint @xmath264 on the phase space variables is that of infinitesimal weyl transformations : @xmath265 @xmath266 @xmath267 so we see that the weyl transformations on the space - like hyperplane are preserved in this gauge .",
    "the constraint surface for the dual theory is defined by the functions @xmath268 satisfying the algebra : @xmath269 what is now left to do is to derive consistency conditions which the trading algorithm demands certain fields to satisfy . as we will see shortly , these are in the form of differential equations @xmath270 and the smearing function for the @xmath271 constraint ( which i previously dented as @xmath169 ) need to satisfy . but before doing this , it will also be useful to understand the geometrical meaning of the gauge fixing condition we have imposed above , i.e. the condition that @xmath272 .",
    "this will be the purpose of the following subsection .",
    "now i will present the geometrical meaning of the gauge fixing condition imposed , and further consequences of imposing said condition .",
    "we see that the condition @xmath273 restricts @xmath57 and hence the parameterisation of the null geodesics that generate the null hyper surfaces .",
    "recall the geometric interpretation associated with the @xmath274 constraints , which was that they are responsible for generating deformations of the space like two surface along the generators of the generators of the hyper surface .",
    "this can be alternatively interpreted as a statement about the arbitrariness of the ruling of the null surface . to see why this is the case , imagine the cross section of the null hyper surface which is specified by specifying the value of one of the parameters @xmath275 where @xmath276 is some constant .",
    "if the normal deformation of this two - surface in the direction of @xmath277 , or in other words , in parallel to @xmath278 , is to be pure gauge , it means that there exists a one parameter family of choices of @xmath279 for which @xmath280 defines the deformed two surface .",
    "the reason for the additional @xmath281 in the previous equation is that this deformed two surface is to be though of in some sense as being ` ahead ' of the one prior to deformation along the null direction of the deformation .",
    "the one parameter ambiguity of which i speak hides in the arbitrariness of the function @xmath282 which we smear against the @xmath271 constraint .    before deriving such a condition",
    ", it would be useful to note that because a restriction of this kind exists , the constraint @xmath283 is no longer first class . in order to proceed i would like to make some field redefinitions which will simplify forthcoming computations .",
    "we identify the trace free part of the momentum , and find that it is just the shear tensor : @xmath284 in terms of which the @xmath271 constraint takes the form @xmath285 it is now apparent that the constraint equation @xmath212 is the same as the raychadhuri equation for each of the hyper surfaces thought of as congruences of null geodesics . upon applying the canonical transformation ,",
    "we find @xmath286 then we can isolate what is called the conformal two metric on @xmath16 , defined as : @xmath287 here @xmath288 , and @xmath289 is a fixed reference metric , whose determinant is 1 .",
    "the reference structures are needed to make sure that the conformal two metric is not a density and will have unit determinant .",
    "we denote @xmath290 at times as @xmath291 and @xmath292 as @xmath293 .",
    "the shear is given very directly in terms of the derivative of the conformal two metric : @xmath294 now we see that the transformed expansion scalar is : @xmath295 next , i simplify the expression for the canonically transformed constraint @xmath296 , this is done by first noticing that @xmath297 we can use this to rewrite the constraint as : @xmath298 the conformal invariance of the square of the shear implies that @xmath299 which is why i do nt put tildes over these variables in the transformed constraint .",
    "utilising the new definition of the transformed expansion scalar , i can write this constraint finally in the form @xmath300 we see that @xmath301 implies that the conformal factor has to satisfy the equation @xmath302    now my claim that this constraint would be second class with respect to @xmath303 can now be easily checked .",
    "first , i write @xmath304 then , by definition @xmath305 so i can apply this to compute @xmath306 as promised , the right hand side is neither zero , nor is it proportional to a constraint .",
    "thus we find that consistency demands that the smearing function @xmath282 for the constraint @xmath296 has to satisfy the equation @xmath307 this implies that this function is no longer a lagrange multiplier , but is now fixed by this equation which too is but a manifestation of the fact that we now have a preferred ruling of the null hyper surfaces .",
    "finally , the constraint generating the diffeomorphisms tangential to the intersection is given by the euler lagrange equation @xmath200 , as mentioned and identified before , but we now reproduce it re written in terms of the field redefinitions and after performing the canonical transformation : @xmath308 a simplification that has been suppressed is the vanishing of part of the above constraint given by @xmath309 due to the second class constraint .",
    "also , @xmath310 the action of the same on the phase space variables is given by : @xmath311 @xmath312 the algebra of these constraints survives the canonical transformation as it should , and moreover its brackets with the weyl constraint are given by : @xmath313    what is left to do now is to formally write down the dirac brackets for this theory .",
    "i will now formally construct the analogue of the matrix @xmath184 defined in subsection of the previous section for the case of the dual theory described above .",
    "following appendix a1 of ( @xcite ) we note that for a block diagonal matrix of operators of the form @xmath314 the inverse is given by @xmath315    we can now write the operator @xmath184 for the dual theory as @xmath316 upon formally inverting as was done with the matrix @xmath317 , we find that the formal dirac brackets explicitly take the following form : @xmath318    the symbol @xmath319 denotes the operator inverse of the bracket between @xmath320 and the constraint @xmath296 , and the invertibility of the bracket relies on the existence of solution to the linear differential equation ( [ eq : lfe ] ) .",
    "more precisely , the operator @xmath321 possesses a non trivial one dimensional kernel generated by the function @xmath322 , where the subscript @xmath323 is meant to denote that it solves ( [ eq : lfe ] ) .",
    "this means that the following condition is satisfied by the inverse operator @xmath324 where @xmath325 is an arbitrary constant .",
    "note that the dirac brackets are equivalent correspond to contracting the pre symplectic two form with hamiltonian vector fields of phase space functions whose dependence on @xmath291 and @xmath169 are restricted to solutions to equations ( [ eq : lye ] ) , ( [ eq : lfe ] ) and we denote the solutions of said equations @xmath326 , @xmath322 respectively . stated mathematically , this implies that @xmath327 this is but a consequence of the fact that @xmath328 for an arbitrary second class constraint set @xmath185 .",
    "there is thus a reduction of the dirac brackets to standard poisson brackets when we restrict our attention to this class of phase space functions whose dependence on @xmath291 and @xmath169 are restricted as mentioned above . on this reduced phase space",
    ", we can use the flat isomorphism on such hamiltonian vector fields to attain the ( pre)symplectic form on such a reduction .",
    "so i take a arbitrary phase space function(al)s @xmath329 which have some dependence on the functions @xmath291 , @xmath169 , i.e. @xmath330 . then my previous statement translates to : @xmath331 the two form @xmath332 is defined to be the symplectic form for the dual theory .    to summarise , given that we can construct dirac brackets as i have shown above , they define a restricted sub space within phase space",
    ". then consider the dirac brackets between an arbitrary pair of functions on phase space , and this becomes the poisson bracket between the two functions restricted to the sub space where the second class constraints are satisfied .",
    "the inverse of these poisson brackets is the definition of the symplectic form of the dual theory .    written in local co - ordinates , the symplectic form for the dual theory",
    "is then given by @xmath333 from our discussion in section 2 , we know that this thoroughly encapsulates the classical dynamics of the theory .",
    "this concludes the construction of the dual theory .",
    "to summarise , the dual theory possesses the symplectic form ( [ eq : symp ] ) and the dynamics is dictated by the action @xmath334    and subject to first - class constraints @xmath335    as was initially stated , these constraints indicate that this theory possesses invariance under diffeomorphisms and weyl transformations that preserve the preferred double null foliation .",
    "in this essay , i have presented a gauge theory which possesses diffeomorphism and weyl invariance that preserves the double null foliation and is dual , and therefore equivalent to , general relativity adapted to that foliation .",
    "as initially advertised , this theory propagates the same degrees of freedom the general relativity does . in the body of the essay ,",
    "i have shown why this has to be the case by construction of the symmetry trading algorithm which was employed in constructing the dual theory .",
    "to be more precise , the dual theory is equivalent to general relativity in the double null formalism where a preferred parameterisation of the null hyper surfaces has been picked out .",
    "this was to be expected as the symmetry trading algorithm required a gauge fixing of at least one of the original theory s constraints .",
    "there are some caveats to be made for this construction . in the construction of the dual theory presented in the previous section ,",
    "i havent included boundary terms in the original lagrangian ( [ eq : cdg ] ) . in the adm formalism of hamiltonian general relativity ,",
    "such boundary terms are known to give rise to boundary contributions to the hamiltonian , and are required to make the variational principle well defined .",
    "this would be their purpose in the above framework as well .",
    "however these terms would nt change the equations of motion and so formally , if we repeat the above construction in the space of solutions to the field equations where we have been careful with the boundary terms , we can at most find some @xmath166 exact modification of the symplectic potential but no obstruction to the construction itself should arise .",
    "another issue of concern is the formation of caustics and crossings between different null hyper - surfaces .",
    "caustics can be thought of as points where neighbouring generators meet , but more precisely they are points where the generators actually focus .",
    "these pathologies are troublesome for they render the double null foliation unreliable . in the body of the essay ,",
    "this was implicitly taken into account in the subsection of section 1 pertaining to the solution to the characteristic initial value problem where the claim was that the solution to the field equations are determined locally in the vicinity of two intersecting null hyper surfaces , while no claims were made about global properties of the solution .",
    "so this construction is safe so long as we are miserly in treating only local regions of spacetime perhaps bounded by null surfaces .",
    "nevertheless , we can adopt a parameterisation which allows us to explicitly truncate the null surfaces before caustics form .",
    "the parameter which is sensitive towards the formation of caustic is the so called ` area parameter ' @xmath336 defined as @xmath337 where @xmath338 is the area density defined on some initial space like surface @xmath339 .",
    "this was employed in ( @xcite ) to construct the symplectic form for general relativity in terms of free null initial data . on either null hyper surface @xmath39 and @xmath40",
    "are considered demarcated by the two space like surfaces where the area parameter vanishes @xmath340 , @xmath341 .",
    "this is how caustics and crossing can be avoided .",
    "there is of course the question of the utility of what has been constructed in this essay . in principle , the dual theory can be considered attractive from the perspective of quantisation , if one were to find a set of observables consistent with the gauge invariances of the theory . then the symplectic form can be used to deduce what the peirels brackets between these observables is which might be amenable to quantisation . at this stage , this task seems very daunting and technically very difficult considering how little is known about observables in the double null framework .",
    "another interesting application could be to study issues relating to graviton scattering at null infinity in asymptotically flat spaces .",
    "after all , past and future null infinity are null surfaces which intersect at a christodoulou - kleinerman space , so this seems to suggest that the problem might be amenable to analysis under the lens of the theory dealt with in the body of this article .",
    "the most direct application this theory can find in a physical problem is its potential applicability towards the proof of the quantum bousso bound ( see ( @xcite ) for details ) in the case of a conformally coupled scalar field .",
    "this is because light - sheets are very easily accommodated into this framework as null surfaces where the space like cross sections have nowhere increasing expansion and the linking theory construction and the linking theory is the same as the null phase space description of the theory of a conformally coupled scalar field .",
    "what i mean by potential applicability in the previous sentence is that the linking theory provides the tools necessary to study this situation .",
    "this shall be an area of future investigation .",
