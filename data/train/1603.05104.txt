    "in the seminal paper @xcite , deligne and illusie observed that a smooth variety @xmath2 defined over a perfect field @xmath3 of characteristic @xmath6 possesses many desired properties , which are standard in characteristic @xmath7 , provided it admits a flat lifting to @xmath0 , i.e. , a unique @xmath8-flat extension of @xmath3 .",
    "this observation turned out to be very fruitful and leads to many further results overcoming pathological behaviour of positive characteristic geometry of _ smooth _ varieties ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the crucial part of the arguments given in the papers mentioned was the existence of a local lifting of the frobenius morphism mod @xmath9 .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the existence of @xmath0 and frobenius liftings in the more general setting of singular schemes .",
    "in this situation , contrary to the case of smooth schemes , a @xmath0-lifting need not to exist even affine locally .",
    "the simplest instance of that phenomenon , in fact @xmath7-dimensional , was given without a proof in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* remark 3.16 ) .",
    "we present a detailed analysis of a slightly more general example in [ sec : quadric_example ] .",
    "furthermore , in @xcite the author generalizes the results of @xcite under the assumption of global frobenius liftability ( see [ def : lifting ] ) , and consequently proves that the crystalline cohomology over @xmath3 of frobenius liftable locally complete intersection schemes is not finitely generated .",
    "the aforementioned examples and results suggest the following two basic question :    question 1 : :    what are the necessary conditions for a scheme to possess a    @xmath0-lifting ?",
    "question 2 : :    for a given scheme , does there exist a @xmath0-lifting    together with a compatible lifting of the frobenius morphism ?    general answers to the questions were given in @xcite and stated that above problems can be expressed in purely cohomological manner .",
    "moreover , in @xcite the authors investigated the first question in the setting of birational geometry .",
    "our contribution to answering the above questions is the following .    as far as the first question is concerned , in [ sec : families ] we analyse how the property of @xmath0-liftability behaves in families @xmath10 .",
    "more precisely , we show , that under mild assumptions suitable for deformation - theoretic considerations ( satisfied if e.g. @xmath11 is proper or affine ) , the locus of witt vector liftable fibres @xmath12{\\mbox{\\normalfont\\tiny def}}}{=}}}f^{-1}(s)$ ] is constructible ( see [ thm : constructible ] ) . furthermore , we reprove the result that frobenius split schemes are @xmath0-liftable .",
    "the advantage of our approach is that we provide the lifting explicitly and functorially with respect to a splitting @xmath13 , in fact as a certain subscheme of the witt scheme @xmath14 .",
    "the details of our construction are presented in [ sec : frobenius_split_witt ] .",
    "moreover , we give a new construction of a non - liftable affine scheme .",
    "in fact , the construction is given by a cone over a suitable embedding on a non - liftable projective scheme ( for the proof see [ lem : comparing_hilb_def ] in the [ appendix : deformation ] ) .",
    "examples of non - liftable projective schemes are given , e.g. , by raynaud @xcite and mukai @xcite .",
    "concerning the second question , we derive a computationally feasible criterion for frobenius liftability of complete intersection affine schemes ( see [ lem : complete_intersections_criterion ] ) .",
    "consequently , we apply the criterion in the case of ordinary double points ( see [ thm : cones_bhatt ] ) , and thus answer the question asked by bhatt in ( * ? ? ? * remark 3.14 ) . as another application of our criterion , in [ sec : canonical_singularities ] we prove that canonical surface singularities are frobenius liftable . finally , in [ sec :",
    "quotient ] we present a general approach for proving frobenius liftability of tame reductions of quotient singularities .",
    "the method is based on the _ spreading out _ technique combined with functoriality of obstruction classes for lifting morphisms .",
    "the above results allow us to address the following question :    question 3 : :    what is the relation between @xmath0-liftability and    frobenius liftability , and classical notions defined in terms of    frobenius action ?",
    "our contribution can be summarized by the following diagram which describes all potential relations between the classical @xmath5-singularities and the notion considered in this paper :    [ swap ] & & & + & & & + & & [ swap ] [ thm : cones_bhatt ] & .",
    "+    the counterexamples corresponding to most of the strikethrough implications in the diagram are provided in [ sec : relation_f - singularities ]    as a byproduct of our considerations , we formalise the foregoing functoriality properties of obstruction classes for deformation of schemes and their morphism . in particular , we analyse their behaviour in the case of affine schemes . the results are given in [ appendix : deformation ] .",
    "apart from explicit statements and proofs concerning functoriality , the whole theory can be found in the standard reference @xcite .    in the course of our consideration we faced the following problem :    open question : :    does there exist a finite tale covering @xmath15    of schemes locally of finite type over @xmath3 such that    @xmath16 is @xmath0-liftable and @xmath2    is not .",
