    "in the study of random walks on graphs , many problems that are straightforward for undirected graphs are relatively complicated in the directed case .",
    "one basic problem concerns determining stationary distributions of random walks on simple directed graphs . for an undirected graph , the vector @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the degree of vertex @xmath3 , is the unique stationary distribution if the graph is connected and non - bipartite",
    "consequently , the principal ratio , which is the ratio of maximum to minimum values of vertices in the stationary distribution , is @xmath4 and thus is at most @xmath0 , the number of vertices .",
    "in contrast , the directed case is far more subtle : not only does no such closed form solution exist for the stationary distribution , but its principal ratio can be exponentially large in @xmath0 .",
    "this has immediate implications for the central question of bounding the rate of convergence of a random walk on a directed graph where extreme values of the stationary distribution play an important role in addition to eigenvalues .",
    "for example , it can be shown that for a strongly connected directed graph , the order of the rate of convergence is bounded above by @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the first nontrivial eigenvalue of the normalized laplacian of the directed graph , as defined in @xcite .",
    "namely after at most @xmath7 steps , the total variation distance is at most @xmath8 .",
    "another application of the stationary distribution and its principal ratio is in the algorithmic design and analysis of vertex ranking , for so - called  _ pagerank _ \" algorithms for directed graphs ( since many real - world information networks are indeed directed graphs ) .",
    "pagerank algorithms @xcite use a variation of random walks with an additional diffusion parameter and therefore it is not surprising that the effectiveness of the algorithm depends on the principal ratio .",
    "in addition to its role in page rank algorithmic analysis and bounding the rate of converge in random walks , it has been noted ( see @xcite ) that the principal ratio can be interpreted as a numerical metric for graph irregularity since it achieves its minimum of @xmath9 only for regular graphs .    the study of the principal ratio of the stationary distribution has a rich history .",
    "we note that the stationary distribution is a special case of the perron vector , which is the unique positive eigenvector associated with the largest eigenvalue of an irreducible matrix with non - negative entries .",
    "there is a large literature examining the perron vector of the adjacency matrix of undirected graphs , which has been studied by cioab and gregory @xcite , tait and tobin @xcite , papendieck and recht @xcite , zhao and hong @xcite , and zhang @xcite . in this paper , we focus on principal ratio of the stationary distribution of random walk on a strongly connected directed graph with @xmath0 vertices .",
    "for directed graphs , some relevant prior results are from matrix analysis .",
    "latham @xcite , minc @xcite , and ostrowski @xcite studied the perron vector of a ( not necessarily symmetric ) matrix with positive entries , which can be used to study matrices associated with complete , weighted directed graphs .",
    "however , for our case a relevant prior result comes from lynn and timlake , who gave bounds of the principal ratio for _ primitive _ matrices with non - negative entries ( see corollary 2.1.1 in @xcite ) .",
    "as we will soon further explain , since ergodic random walks on directed graphs have primitive transition probability matrices , their result applies naturally in our setting . letting @xmath10 denote the principal ratio of a directed graph @xmath11 , their result yields the bound @xmath12 where @xmath11 is a strongly connected , aperiodic directed graph on @xmath0 vertices .",
    "chung gave an upper bound ( see @xcite ) on the principal ratio of a strongly connected directed graph @xmath11 that depends on certain graph parameters .",
    "namely , @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the diameter of the graph and @xmath15 is the maximum out - degree .",
    "since @xmath16 , this bound also implies absolute upper bound on the principal ratio of @xmath17 over all strongly connected directed graphs on @xmath0 vertices .    in this paper",
    ", we provide an exact expression for the maximum of the principal ratio over all strongly connected directed graphs on @xmath0 vertices .",
    "asymptotically , our bound is @xmath18    furthermore , we show that this bound is achieved by precisely three directed graphs , up to isomorphism .",
    "in addition to an extremal analysis of the principal ratio , we also examine conditions under which the principal ratio can be tightly bounded .",
    "namely , we show that if a directed graph satisfies a degree condition and a discrepancy condition , then its principal ratio can be tightly bounded in the sense that it is  close \" to the minimum possible value of 1 .",
    "furthermore , we provide counterexamples that show the principal ratio can not be tightly bounded if either the discrepancy condition or degree conditions are removed .",
    "let @xmath11 be a directed graph with vertex set @xmath19 and edge set @xmath20 . a directed edge from vertex @xmath21 to @xmath3",
    "is denoted by @xmath22 or @xmath23 , and we say @xmath3 is an out - neighbor of @xmath21 or @xmath21 is an in - neighbor of @xmath3 .",
    "we assume @xmath11 is simple , meaning @xmath11 has no loops or multiple edges . for each @xmath24 ,",
    "the _ out - neighborhood of @xmath21 _ , denoted by @xmath25 , is the vertex set @xmath26 and the _ out - degree of @xmath21 _ , denoted by @xmath27 , is @xmath28 .",
    "similarly , the in - neighborhood and in - degree of @xmath21 are denoted by @xmath29 and @xmath30 respectively .",
    "we will omit the subscript @xmath11 whenever @xmath11 is clear from context .",
    "a _ walk _ is a sequence of vertices @xmath31 where @xmath32 is an edge .",
    "a random walk on a directed graph is defined by a transition probability matrix @xmath33 , where @xmath34 denotes the probability of moving from vertex @xmath21 to vertex @xmath3 . in this paper",
    ", we consider _ simple _ random walks in which moving from a vertex to any of its neighbors is equally likely .",
    "accordingly , the probability transition matrix @xmath33 is defined by @xmath35    while we assume @xmath33 is of the above form and consider only random walks on directed graphs with unweighted edges , we note that every finite markov chain can be viewed as a random walk on a weighted directed graph .",
    "namely , if @xmath36 denote edge weights , a general probability transition matrix @xmath33 can be defined as    @xmath37    a probability distribution is a function @xmath38 satisfying @xmath39 and is said to be a _ stationary distribution _ of a random walk if    @xmath40    where @xmath41 is viewed as a row vector . it can be easily shown that @xmath42 is a stationary distribution for a simple random walk on _ any _ undirected graph and is unique if the graph is connected . for a strongly connected directed graph ,",
    "the existence of a stationary distribution is guaranteed by the celebrated perron - frobenius theorem . since @xmath43 for",
    "strongly connected directed graphs , @xmath44    and thus the all ones vector @xmath45 is trivially the right perron eigenvector associated with eigenvalue 1 . by the perron frobenius theorem , there exists a left ( row ) eigenvector @xmath46 with positive entries such that    @xmath47    we may scale @xmath46 so that @xmath48 , in which case @xmath46 is the ( unique ) stationary distribution which we refer to as the perron vector . while there is no closed formula for a stationary distribution of a strongly connected directed graph in general , a closed formula does exist for those in which the in - degree of each vertex is equal to its out - degree .",
    "eulerian directed graphs have stationary distribution proportional to their out - degree sequences , @xmath49 .",
    "consequently , the stationary distribution of a directed regular graph with in - degrees and out - degrees all equal is given by the uniform distribution , @xmath50 .",
    "the _ principal ratio _",
    "@xmath10 of a strongly connected , directed graph @xmath11 is denoted by @xmath51    for eulerian directed graphs , the principal ratio is the ratio of the largest to smallest out - degree .",
    "since regular directed graphs are eulerian with out - degrees all equal , they achieve the minimum possible principal ratio of 1 .",
    "thus the principal ratio can be regarded as one numerical measure of a directed graphs irregularity .",
    "a random walk is ergodic if for any initial distribution @xmath52 , the random walk converges to the unique stationary distribution , i.e. ,    @xmath53    for undirected graphs , the spectral decomposition of @xmath33 shows a random walk is ergodic if and only if the graph is connected and non - bipartite .",
    "however , the directed case requires a more nuanced criterion .",
    "for example , while a random walk on an undirected cycle @xmath54 with @xmath0 odd is ergodic , a random walk on a directed cycle @xmath54 is not .",
    "a random walk on a directed graph is ergodic if and only if @xmath11 is strongly connected and _",
    ", i.e. , the greatest common divisor of the lengths of all its directed cycles is 1",
    ".    directed graphs which are both strongly connected and aperiodic have _ primitive _ transition matrices .",
    "that is , for such graphs there exists some integer @xmath15 such that all entries of @xmath55 are positive .",
    "in this paper , we will prove an upper bound on the principal ratio in terms of @xmath0 that is best possible . for @xmath56",
    ", we define a function    @xmath57    we will show :    [ asymthm ] the maximum of the principal ratio of the stationary distribution over all strongly connected directed graphs on @xmath0 vertices is asymptotically @xmath58    this theorem is an immediate consequence of the following theorem which we prove .",
    "[ thm1 ] the maximum of the principal ratio of the stationary distribution over all strongly connected directed graphs on @xmath56 vertices is exactly @xmath59    moreover , @xmath60 is attained only by directed graphs @xmath61 and @xmath62 defined as follows : @xmath63 , and @xmath62 have vertex set @xmath64 and edge set @xmath65 where @xmath66    the case for @xmath67 is illustrated in figure @xmath68 .     for @xmath67 . ]",
    "note that the extremal graphs @xmath69 are not only strongly connected , but also aperiodic .",
    "thus , theorem 1 still holds if one restricts attention to stationary distributions of ergodic random walks .",
    "the proof of theorem 2 follows from a sequence of propositions .",
    "the basic idea is as follows : we first show that if the principal ratio of a directed graph achieves the bound in theorem [ thm1 ] , then the graph must necessarily satisfy a set of properties , which are described in section @xmath70 . in sections",
    "@xmath71 , we identify families of graphs that satisfy these properties , but nonetheless are not extremal .",
    "namely , given an arbitrary member from this family , we describe how one can modify this graph by adding or deleting edges so that its principal ratio strictly increases . in section @xmath72",
    ", we apply these propositions to show that unless a given graph is one of three graphs , it can be modified to increase its principal ratio .",
    "finally , after establishing that all three of these extremal graphs indeed have the same principal ratio , we finish the proof and we explicitly compute the stationary distribution of one of these extremal graphs .",
    "note that the graphs @xmath73 and @xmath74 are proper subgraphs of @xmath62 .",
    "while all three graphs have different stationary distributions , their principal ratios are nonetheless equal .",
    "we assume all directed graphs @xmath11 are strongly connected . for two vertices @xmath21 and @xmath3 , the distance @xmath75 is the number of edges in a shortest directed path from @xmath21 to @xmath3 . for two subsets @xmath76 ,",
