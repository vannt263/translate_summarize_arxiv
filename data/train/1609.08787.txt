    "massive multiple - input multiple - output ( mimo ) is considered as the key enabling technology to realize the promise of the increased throughput .",
    "recently , an extensive research conducted by the mobile and wireless communications enablers for the twenty - twenty information society ( metis ) strengthens the role of massive mimo in 5 g @xcite .",
    "a significant finding of metis is that implementing massive mimo provides a twenty times increased throughput than the 4 g networks , which is by far the largest contributing factor . of course",
    ", we need to overcome certain challenges such as pilot contamination to fully unlock the lucrative advantages offered by massive mimo .",
    "previous studies shows that pilot contamination severely limits the performance of massive mimo @xcite . in principle ,",
    "pilot contamination occurs when there are not enough orthogonal pilot sequences available in the massive mimo network .",
    "specifically , pilot contamination exists when the number of users in the network exceeds the length of the pilot sequence .",
    "the adverse nature of pilot contamination is highlighted by the fact that it does not disappear when the base station ( bs ) employs a very large number of antennas .",
    "consequently , an increasing attention has been paid to alleviate the detrimental impact of pilot contamination in massive mimo .",
    "the previous research on the topic falls into one of the five categories : 1 ) protocol based methods @xcite ; 2 ) precoding based methods @xcite ; 3 ) angle - of - arrival ( aoa ) based methods @xcite ; 4 ) blind methods @xcite ; and 5 ) pilot sequence design methods @xcite . a new direction of research in mitigating pilot contamination is to leverage the known user location information and perform location - based processing , e.g. , location - aware pilot assignment . in telecommunication networks ,",
    "user location information can be easily obtained by either estimating the user location @xcite or by obtaining the true user location from the global position system @xcite .",
    "location - aware pilot assignment schemes are generally focused on assigning pilot sequences to all the users in the network such that pilot contamination is minimized @xcite .",
    "we note that the existing location - aware pilot assignment schemes @xcite assume a simple channel model , which may not be generalized enough to depict certain channel conditions .",
    "additionally , the existing works utilize location information to make the aoa of interfering signal non - overlapping @xcite .",
    "different from previous works , we make use of the deterministic location - dependent line of sight ( los ) channel component to assign pilot sequences in the network .    in this paper , we propose a location - aware pilot assignment scheme to improve the uplink sum rate performance by means of reducing pilot contamination in massive mimo network .",
    "different from @xcite , we assume a rician fading channel model in our analysis .",
    "we specifically focus on the los component of the received uplink signal and develop a location - aware algorithm to minimize the interference caused by the los component .",
    "we observe that minimizing los interference also results in reduced pilot contamination .",
    "our proposed location - aware algorithm returns a user assignment matrix , which identifies the users that should be assigned the same pilot sequences to improve the uplink sum rate .",
    "the main contributions of our paper are summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "we investigate the los interference in massive mimo networks .",
    "we find that the los interference is minimum for a certain pilot assignment in the network . based on this finding ,",
    "we propose a pilot assignment scheme that aims at mitigating the pilot contamination in massive mimo networks",
    "we note that the los interference converges to zero in massive mimo regime .",
    "however , we find that the rate at which it converges to zero depends on the pilot assignment in the network . as such",
    ", our proposed pilot assignment scheme exploits the los interference convergence rate to assign same pilot sequences to the users that will result in reduced pilot contamination .",
    "we propose a new performance metric based on the los interference .",
    "the usefulness of the proposed metric is supported by the fact that uplink sum rate increases when the value of the proposed performance metric decreases .",
    "we compare the proposed location - aware pilot assignment scheme with the random pilot assignment scheme to demonstrate its advantages .",
