    "a deeper understanding of the low temperature macroscopic phases of a many - body system can only be achieved with the aid of a quantum theory .",
    "of particular interest is the modeling and description of how the system goes from one phase to another , a process known as `` phase transition '' . in ordinary phase transitions , which occur at finite temperatures , the phase change is driven by thermal fluctuations .",
    "for example , if we heat a magnet we arrive at a temperature ( curie temperature ) above which it loses its magnetism . in other words , the magnet initially in the ferromagnetic phase , where all spins are aligned , changes to the paramagnetic phase , where the magnetic moments are in a disordered state .",
    "however , a phase transition can also occur at or near absolute zero temperature ( @xmath1 ) , where thermal fluctuations are negligible .",
    "this process is called a quantum phase transition ( qpt)@xcite and is attained varying a tuning parameter in the hamiltonian ( e.g. an external magnetic field ) while keeping the temperature fixed . when the tuning parameter reaches a particular value , the so called critical point ( cp ) , the system s hamiltonian ground state changes drastically , which reflects in an abrupt modification of the macroscopic properties of the system . in this scenario ,",
    "quantum fluctuations , which loosely speaking are governed by the heisenberg uncertainty principle , are responsible for the phase transition . although it is impossible to achieve @xmath1 due to the third law of thermodynamics , the effects of qpts",
    "can be observed at finite temperatures whenever the de broglie wavelength is greater than the correlation length of thermal fluctuations@xcite .",
    "important examples of qpts are the paramagnetic - ferromagnetic transition in some metals@xcite , the superconductor - insulator transition@xcite , and superfluid - mott insulator transition@xcite",
    ".    the ground state of a many - body system at @xmath1 near a cp is often described by a non - trivial wave function due to the long - range correlations among the system s constituents . in ref .",
    "preskill argued that quantum entanglement could be responsible for these correlations and therefore the methods developed by quantum information theory ( qit ) could be useful in studying the critical behavior of many - body systems .",
    "besides , new protocols for quantum computation and communication could be formulated based on such systems . along these lines many theoretical tools ( in particular entanglement quantifiers ) originally developed to tackle qit problems were employed to determine the cps of qpts at @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "later l .- a .",
    "wu et al.@xcite proved a general connection between non - analyticities in bipartite entanglement measures and qpts while in ref .",
    "this connection was extended to multipartite entanglement .",
    "recently another quantity , namely , quantum discord ( qd ) , has attracted the attention of the quantum information community .",
    "qd goes beyond the concept of entanglement and captures in a certain sense the `` quantumness '' of the correlations between two parts of a system .",
    "it was built by noting the fact that two classically equivalent versions of the mutual information are inequivalent in the quantum domain @xcite . using qd",
    "one can show that quantum entanglement does not describe all quantum correlations existing in a correlated quantum state .",
    "in other words , it is possible to create quantum correlations other than entanglement between two quantum systems via local operations and classical communication ( locc ) .",
    "the first study showing a possible connection between qd and qpt was done by r. dillenschneider@xcite in the context of spin chains at @xmath1 , where a cp associated to a qpt was well characterized by qd .",
    "further studies subsequently have confirmed the usefulness of qd in describing other types of qpts at zero temperature@xcite .",
    "moreover , it is important to note that such quantum informational approaches to spotlight cps of qpts do not require the knowledge of an order parameter ( a macroscopic quantity that changes abruptly during the qpt ) ; only the extremal values or the behavior of the derivatives of either the entanglement or qd is sufficient .",
    "the previous theoretical studies , however , were restricted to the zero temperature regime , which is experimentally unattainable ; the third law of thermodynamics dictates that it is impossible to drive a system to @xmath1 by a finite amount of thermodynamic operations .",
    "due to this limitation it is therefore not straightforward to directly compare those theoretical results with experimental data obtained at finite @xmath0 . in order to overcome this problem one has to study the behavior of quantum correlations in a system at thermal equilibrium , which is described by the canonical ensemble @xmath2 , with @xmath3 being the system s hamiltonian , @xmath4 the boltzmann s constant and @xmath5 the partition function . _",
    "thermal entanglement _ , i.e. the entanglement computed for states described by @xmath6 , was first studied by m. c. arnesen _",
    "et al._@xcite for a finite unidimensional heisenberg chain .",
    "other interesting works followed this one , where thermal entanglement has been considered for other hamiltonians , both for finite@xcite and infinite chains@xcite . see ref . for extensive reviews on entanglement and qpt .",
    "however , the focus of the aforementioned works was not the study of the ability of thermal entanglement to point out cps when @xmath7 . in ref .",
    ", two of us introduced the analogous to thermal entanglement , namely , _ thermal quantum discord _ ( tqd ) , and we studied the behavior of this quantity in a system consisting of two spins described by the @xmath8 model in the presence of an external magnetic field . in this work it was observed for the first time that tqd could be able to signal a qpt at _ finite _ @xmath0 .    in order to fully explore the previous possibility , highlighted by solving a simple two - body problem@xcite",
    ", we tackled the xxz hamiltonian in the thermodynamic limit for several values of @xmath7@xcite .",
    "now , working with infinite chains , we were able to show for the first time that tqd keeps its ability to detect the cps associated to the qpts for the xxz model even if @xmath9 , while entanglement and other thermodynamic quantities are not as good as tqd .",
    "also , we showed that these quantities when contrasted to tqd lose for increasing @xmath0 their cp - detection property faster than tqd .",
    "later@xcite we generalized those results considering @xmath10 the xxz hamiltonian and @xmath11 the xy hamiltonian both in the presence of an external magnetic field .",
    "for these two models it was shown that among the usual quantities employed to detect cps , tqd was the best suited to properly estimate them when @xmath7 .    our goal in this paper is to present a short but self - contained review of our aforementioned results about tqd and its application as a cp detector of qpts . to this end",
    "we structure this paper as follows . in sec .",
    "2 we present a brief review about quantum correlations where qd and the entanglement of formation take on a prominent role . in sec .",
    "3 we review the behavior of tqd in the context of simple two - qubit models .",
    "we then move on to the analysis of the ability of quantum correlations , in particular tqd , to spotlight the cps of qpts when the system is at @xmath7 and in the thermodynamic limit . in this context",
    "we study the xxz and xy models with and without an external magnetic field .",
    "finally , we conclude and discuss future directions in sec . 4 .",
    "the superposition principle of quantum mechanics is directly related to the existence of ( quantum ) correlations that are not seen in classical objects .",
    "this principle together with the tensorial nature of combining different quantum systems ( hilbert spaces ) lead to entanglement , which implies intriguing correlations among the many constituents of a composite system that puzzle our classical minds .",
    "it is worth mentioning that this tensorial nature from which a composite quantum system is described in terms of its parts is not a truism .",
    "indeed , the principle of superposition is also present in classical physics , for example in the classical theory of electromagnetism .",
    "however , in classical physics this tensorial nature for combining systems is missing , which helps in understanding why `` weird '' quantum effects such as non - locality@xcite are not seen in a classical world .    during many decades after the birth of quantum mechanics quantum correlations",
    "were thought to be necessarily linked to non - locality , or more quantitatively , to the violation of a bell - like inequality@xcite .",
    "the non - violation of a bell - like inequality implies that the correlations among the parts of a composite system can be described by a local realistic theory .",
    "this fact led many to call a state not violating any bell - like inequality a classical state .",
    "this situation changed by the seminal work of r. f. werner@xcite , who showed that there are mixed entangled states that do not violate any bell - like inequality .",
    "therefore , according to the bell / non - locality paradigm these states should be considered examples of classical states although possessing entanglement",
    ". this state of affairs was unsatisfactory and the notion of classical states was expanded .",
    "a classical ( non - entangled ) state was then defined as any state that can be created only by local operations on the subsystems and classical communication among its many parts ( locc)@xcite . for a bipartite system described by the density operator @xmath12 , the states created via locc ( separable states ) can be generally written as @xmath13 where @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 are legitimate density matrices . if a quantum state can not be written as ( [ sstate ] ) then it is an entangled state .    at this point one",
    "may wonder if this is a definitive characterization of a classical state . or one may ask : is nt there any `` quantumness '' in the correlations for some sort of separable ( non - entangled ) quantum states ? can we go beyond the entanglement paradigm ? as observed in refs .",
    "there exist some states written as ( [ sstate ] ) that possess non - classical features .",
    "this fact led the authors of refs .   to push further our definition of classical states .",
    "now , instead of eq .",
    "( [ sstate ] ) , we call a bipartite state classical if it can be written as @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 span two sets of orthonormal states .",
    "states described by ( [ two ] ) are a subset of those described by ( [ sstate ] ) and they are built via mixtures of locally distinguishable states@xcite . intuitively , classical states are those where the superposition principle does not manifest itself either on the level of different hilbert spaces ( zero entanglement ) or on the level of single hilbert spaces ( no schrdinger cat states leading to a mixture of non - orthogonal states ) .",
    "such states have null qd .",
    "let us be more quantitative and define qd for a bipartite quantum state @xcite divided into parts @xmath20 and @xmath21 . in the paradigm of classical information theory@xcite the total correlation between @xmath20 and @xmath21",
    "is quantified by the mutual information ( mi ) , @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the shannon entropy with @xmath24 the probability distribution of the random variable @xmath25 . the conditional probability for classical variables @xmath26 is defined by the baye s rule , that is , @xmath27 , with @xmath28 denoting the joint probability distribution of variables @xmath29 and @xmath30 . using the conditional probability",
    "one can show that @xmath31 , where @xmath32 .",
    "this last result allows one to write mi , eq .",
    "( [ mi1 ] ) , as @xmath33 note that @xmath34 is the conditional entropy , which quantifies how much uncertainty is left on average about @xmath20 when one knows @xmath21 . the quantum version of eq .",
    "( [ mi1 ] ) , denoted by @xmath35 , can be obtained replacing the shannon entropy by the von - neumann entropy @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the density operator of the system @xmath38 . on the other hand , a quantum version of eq .",
    "( [ mi2 ] ) is not so straightforward because the bayes rule is not always valid for quantum systems@xcite .",
    "for instance , this rule is violated for a pure entangled state .",
    "indeed , one can show that if we naively extend the usual quantum conditional entropy to quantum systems as @xmath39 , it becomes negative for pure entangled states .",
    "qd is built in a way to circumvent this limitation .    in order to build a meaningful quantum version of the conditional entropy @xmath40 it is necessary to take into account the fact that knowledge about system b is related to measurements on @xmath21 . and",
    "now , differently from the classical case , a measurement in the quantum domain can be performed in many non - equivalent ways ( different set of projectors , for instance ) . if a general quantum measurement , i.e. a povm ( positive operator valued measure)@xcite , @xmath41 is performed in the quantum state @xmath12 , then after the measurement the state is described by @xmath42 .",
    "the probability of the outcome @xmath30 of @xmath21 is @xmath43 $ ] and the conditional state of @xmath20 in this case is @xmath44 .",
    "thus , the conditional entropy with respect to the povm @xmath41 is @xmath45 .",
    "therefore , in order to quantify the uncertainty left on @xmath20 after a measurement on @xmath21 one has to minimize over all povms .",
    "this leads to the following definition of the quantum conditional entropy@xcite : @xmath46    at this point , the quantum version of the mutual information ( [ mi2 ] ) , denoted by @xmath47 , is obtained replacing the classical conditional entropy @xmath40 by its quantum analog @xmath48 , which does not assume negative values .",
    "the _ quantum discord _ is defined as the difference between these two versions of the quantum mutual information@xcite : @xmath49 note that qd is not necessarily a symmetric quantity , because the conditional entropy ( [ qce ] ) depends on the system in which the measurement is performed . however , for the density operators studied in this paper qd is always symmetric .",
    "furthermore , while for mixed states there are states with null entanglement and qd @xmath50 , for pure states qd is essentially equivalent to entanglement .",
    "in other words , only for mixed states there might be quantum correlations other than entanglement .",
    "as demonstrated recently@xcite , a quantum state @xmath12 has @xmath51 if , and only if , it can be written as @xmath52 , with @xmath15 and @xmath53 a set of orthogonal states .",
    "this result shows the importance of the superposition principle to explain the origin of the quantum correlations .",
    "it is due to this principle that one can generate a set @xmath53 of non - orthogonal states leading to states with nonzero qd .",
    "for arbitrary @xmath54-dimensional bipartite states the computation of qd involves a complicated minimization procedure whose origin can be traced back to the evaluation of the conditional entropy @xmath48 , eq .",
    "( [ cond ] ) .",
    "in general one must then rely on numerical procedures to get qd and it is not even known whether a general efficient algorithm exists . for two - qubit systems , however , the minimization over generalized measurements can be replaced by the minimization over projective measurements ( von neumann measurements)@xcite . in this case",
    "the minimization procedure can be efficiently implemented numerically@xcite for arbitrary two - qubit states and some analytical results can be achieved for a restricted class of states@xcite . in this work we will be dealing with density matrices @xmath55 in the x - form , that is , @xmath56 . moreover , in our models @xmath57 and all matrix elements are real , making the numerical evaluation of qd simple and fast .    to close this section , we introduce the measure of entanglement used in this paper , the _ entanglement of formation _ ( eof)@xcite .",
    "eof quantifies , at least for pure states , how many singlets are needed per copy of @xmath12 to prepare many copies of @xmath12 using only locc . for an @xmath25-form density matrix",
    "we have @xmath58 with @xmath59 and the concurrence@xcite given by @xmath60 , where @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "in this section we consider a two spin system described by the xyz model with an external magnetic field acting on both spins.@xcite the hamiltonian of this model is @xmath63 where @xmath64 ( @xmath65 ) are the usual pauli matrices acting on the @xmath66-th site and we have assumed @xmath67 . as mentioned above , the density matrix describing a system in equilibrium with a thermal reservoir at temperature @xmath0 is @xmath2 , where @xmath5 is the partition function .",

    "although we are considering here only two spins , such result suggests that tqd may possibly signal a qpt for @xmath7 .",
    "let us now analyze the case where @xmath108 and focus on the xy model in a transverse magnetic field ( @xmath109 , @xmath110 , and @xmath111 ) . as noted in ref .",

    "now , to estimate the cps at finite @xmath0 we used the same procedure adopted for the xxz model . if the first - order derivative of tqd or eof is divergent at @xmath1 then the cp is pointed out by a local maximum or minimum at @xmath7 ; if the first - order derivative is discontinuous at @xmath1 then we look after local maximum or minimum in the second derivative for @xmath7 .",
    "these extreme values act as indicators of qpts .",
    "the cps estimated with such method are denoted by @xmath190 while the correct cps are denoted by @xmath191 .",
    "the differences between @xmath191 and @xmath190 as a function of kt for @xmath188 are plotted in fig .",
    "we can see in this figure that tqd provides a better estimate of the cp @xmath168 than eof .    for @xmath192 eof and tqd",
    "give almost the same estimation of the cp and for @xmath193 tqd is better than eof with predictions differing at the second decimal place . for @xmath194",
    ", tqd outperforms eof already in the first decimal place .",
    "moreover , for @xmath167 tqd is able to correctly estimate the cp for higher temperatures than for @xmath192 and @xmath193 .",
    "so far we have studied a qpt driven by the magnetic field . however ,",
    "for @xmath169 the xy model undergoes a qpt driven by the anisotropy parameter @xmath165 , whose critical point is @xmath170 . to study such transition we fixed @xmath195 . in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] we plotted tqd and eof for the first - neighbors as functions of @xmath165 and for @xmath196 and @xmath197 .",
    "note that the maximum of tqd and eof is reached at the cp @xmath170 .",
    "however , only tqd has a cusp - like behavior at the cp .",
    "this pattern of tqd ( maximum with a cusp - like behavior ) remains up to @xmath198 . on the other hand ,",
    "the maximum of eof at the cp can only be seen as far as @xmath199 for above this temperature eof becomes zero . in ref .",
    "we computed tqd and eof for second - neighbors . in this case",
    "tqd is able to detect the cp even for values near @xmath200 while eof is nonzero only for @xmath201 .",
    "in this article we presented a review of our studies about the behavior of quantum correlations in the context of spin chains at finite temperatures . the main goal of this paper was to analyze the quantum correlation s ability to pinpoint the critical points associated to quantum phase transitions assuming the system s temperature is greater than the absolute zero .",
    "the two measures of quantum correlations studied here were quantum discord and entanglement , with the former producing the best results .",
    "we first reviewed a work of two of us about a simple but illustrative two spin-1/2 system described by the xyz model with an external magnetic field@xcite .",
    "we showed many surprising results about the thermal quantum discord s behavior .",
    "for example , and differently from entanglement , thermal quantum discord can increase with temperature in the absence of an external field even for such a small system ; and that there are situations where thermal quantum discord increases while entanglement decreases with temperature . furthermore , for the xxx model we observed for the first time that quantum discord could be a good candidate to signal a critical point at finite @xmath0 .    to check whether quantum discord is indeed a good critical point detector for temperatures higher than absolute zero",
    ", we analyzed its behavior for an infinite chain described by the xxz model without@xcite and with@xcite an external magnetic field and in equilibrium with a thermal reservoir at temperature @xmath0 .",
    "here we also extended our previous results by computing the quantum correlations between the first nearest - neighbor spins for the whole range of the anisotropy parameter ( positive and negative values ) . in this way we were able to describe the two critical points of the xxz model in the thermodynamic limit and the behavior of quantum discord near them .",
    "the results presented here and in refs .   showed that quantum discord is far better the best critical point detector for @xmath7 with respect to all quantities tested ( entanglement , entropy , specific heat , magnetic susceptibility , and the two - point correlation functions ) .    another model considered in this work was the xy model in a transverse magnetic field@xcite .",
    "again , we computed the quantum correlations between the first nearest - neighbors assuming the system in equilibrium with a thermal reservoir at temperature @xmath0 .",
    "this model has two second - order quantum phase transitions , namely , an ising transition and an anisotropy transition . for the ising transition we observed that the critical point is better estimated by quantum discord . for the anisotropy transition",
    "both quantities , entanglement and discord , provide an excellent estimate for the critical point at low temperatures .",
    "however , since for increasing temperatures quantum discord is more robust than entanglement , the former was able to spotlight the quantum critical point for a wider range of temperatures , even for values of temperature where entanglement was absent .    in conclusion , we showed that for the spin models studied here and in refs .",
    "quantum discord was the best quantum critical point estimator among all quantities tested when the system assumes a finite temperature .",
    "it is also important to mention that the knowledge of the order parameter was not needed to estimate the critical points .",
    "therefore , we strongly believe that our results suggest that quantum correlations - mainly quantum discord - are important tools to study quantum phase transitions in realistic scenarios , where the temperature is always above absolute zero .",
