    "it is well known that wzw models are some of the few known exact string theory backgrounds .",
    "they are important elements of the near - horizon geometry of various string theory configurations .",
    "for example the background of @xmath0 ns5 branes and @xmath1 fundamental strings has a near horizon geometry given by the @xmath2 wzw model . on the other hand",
    "the near - horizon geometry of a circular distribution of ns5 branes is t - dual to an orbifold of the @xmath3 gauged wzw model .",
    "in addition wzw models and their gauged variations have become increasingly important in studies of the ads / cft correspondence and branes - world scenarios .",
    "d - branes are an essential ingredient of string theory since they play crucial role in various dualities and holography .",
    "one way to study the properties of d - branes in a given background is to construct the boundary state of the d - branes which describe the couplings of closed string modes on their world - volume .",
    "this is in general a difficult question for a general background .",
    "although d - branes in wzw models on compact group manifolds like su(2 ) have been studied extensively , little progress has been achieved towards non - compact cases like @xmath4 .",
    "in fact even the spectrum of these theories is not fully understood .",
    "nevertheless we can get useful information for such d - branes by studying just the semiclassical limit of their boundary states , in other words their low energy effective action .",
    "this has been a fruitful approach for the @xmath4 case @xcite as well as for the cases of compact group manifolds @xcite . in this note",
    "we will study the semiclassical features of d - branes in the gauged @xmath5 wzw model along the lines of a similar study for @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "since we are not in position to give the full boundary state for all d - branes in @xmath5 , we will restrict ourselves to their geometrical features .",
    "finally , for one set of branes , we use a small fluctuation analysis of the low energy effective action to get the semiclassical limit of the open string spectra .",
    "consequently we compare our results with expectations from a cft analysis @xcite .",
    "the @xmath4 wzw model is described by a world - sheet sigma model with target space : @xmath7 and a kalb - ramond field strength given by the volume element of the spacetime .",
    "the constant k is the level of the affine lie algebra that can take real values with @xmath8 , and we used units @xmath9 .",
    "one can construct the @xmath5 coset from the @xmath4 wzw model by gauging a u(1 ) subgroup of @xmath4 @xcite . if this subgroup is non compact one ends with a manifold with lorentzian signature , the 2d black hole . on the contrary",
    "if we choose a compact u(1 ) then we get an euclidean manifold .",
    "there are two possible anomaly free u(1 ) gauge symmetries : the axial , @xmath10 and the vector , @xmath11 , where @xmath12 group elements of @xmath4 and @xmath13 . for a compact u(1 ) the manifold we get by gauging the axial symmetry has the geometry of a cigar : @xmath14 the axial gauging amounts intuitively into gauging the symmetry which corresponds to time translations in @xmath4 .",
    "this will be important later in understanding the geometry of branes in the cigar geometry .",
    "notice that unlike @xmath15 , in @xmath4 we have closed time - like curves .",
    "therefore the u(1 ) associated with time translations is a compact subgroup of @xmath4 .    by gauging the vector compact u(1 ) symmetry",
    "we get the geometry of a trumpet : @xmath16 this coset amounts to gauging the u(1 ) symmetry of shifting @xmath17 .",
    "notice that unlike the cigar manifold , that of the trumpet is singular due to the fact that the vector gauging action has fixed points .",
    "the two backgrounds are actually t - dual to each other . to be exact the cigar is t - dual to the trumpet where @xmath18 .    finally we would like to summarize the operator spectrum of the theory @xcite since it will become useful in our small fluctuation analysis .",
    "the operators in the axially gauged theory belong to discrete series with @xmath19 and continuous series with @xmath20 , @xmath21 .",
    "the operators are charged under the @xmath4 currents @xmath22 with charges : @xmath23 and @xmath24 . the classical angular momentum of an operator is @xmath25 and the winding @xmath26 .",
    "the conformal weights of the operators are : @xmath27 in addition from the harmonic analysis in @xmath4 we conclude that discrete representations should satisfy : @xmath28 .",
    "we see that we can not have discrete representations with vanishing winding . for the t - dual vector",
    "gauging we need to take @xmath29 which results in @xmath30 in ( [ cw ] ) .",
    "the discrete representations constrain in this case is @xmath31 , where @xmath25 is the angular momentum in the trumpet and @xmath26 the winding . in this case discrete series states with non - zero momentum and zero winding exist .",
    "the continuous representations correspond semiclassically to wave like solutions while the discrete ones to bound states .",
    "so , in the semiclassical limit @xmath32 , where the winding states decouple , we expect bound states for the trumpet and not for the cigar .",
    "these expectations from cft are nicely confirmed by the computation of the low energy spectrum of the two geometries @xcite .",
    "the open string spectra of the d - branes satisfy analogous constrains .",
    "the geometry of d - branes in @xmath33 has been studied in @xcite ( see also i.e. @xcite for related work ) where it was found that solutions of the dbi action correspond to regular and twined conjugacy classes of @xmath4 .",
    "it was found that d1 branes have @xmath34 world volumes and d2 branes come in two types with @xmath35 and @xmath36 world volumes @xcite .",
    "the first type of d2 branes has a d - instanton density in its world - volume while the second one was found to be unphysical due to a supercritical electric field . as explained in @xcite the d - branes in coset models @xmath37 have world - volumes localized on the projection to the coset , of the product of a conjugacy class of @xmath38 with a conjugacy class of @xmath39 . in geometric words we expect the d - branes we will find on the cigar to be projections on a constant @xmath40 plane of the d - branes in @xmath4 and those of the trumpet projections on a constant @xmath17 plane .",
    "we will verify these expectations by solving the dbi for the cigar and trumpet .",
    "we will assume from now on that the level @xmath41 is an integer .",
    "this needs not to be the general case but in most of the interesting ( supersymmetric ) backgrounds the @xmath42 cft appears with a corresponding @xmath43 with the levels @xmath41 and @xmath44 differing by an integer @xcite . since @xmath44 must be an integer then @xmath41 should be one too .    for the d1 branes in the cigar and with an embedding @xmath45 we need to minimize the `` energy '' of the system @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is derivative with respect to @xmath17 .",
    "the same method is employed for the d1 branes in the trumpet . for the d2 branes one",
    "has to solve the equations of motion for the gauge field @xmath48 .",
    "the analysis is straight forward as shown in tables 1 and 2 .    in tables 1 and 2",
    "we give the embedding equations for the various branes in trumpet and cigar respectively , as well as the @xmath49 branes from which they descent .",
    "the dimensionality of each brane is evident by its name i.e. @xmath50 is an 1-dimensional brane in the trumpet , descending from the @xmath36 brane in @xmath33 .",
    "@xmath51    @xmath52     where they descent from .",
    ", width=377 ]    at this point a few comments are in order .",
    "first looking at the table of the cigar and the trumpet we notice that the branes which descent from the @xmath34 and @xmath36 branes have two classical moduli .",
    "unlike these branes , the dbi analysis analogous to @xcite for d2 branes in the cigar , implies that they carry a d0 brane charge which leads to the quantization of the modulus @xmath53 .",
    "also since they have trivial topology they do not admit a wilson line . by t - duality these branes are related to d1 branes in the trumpet which hit the infinite radius circle at @xmath54 . in principal one expects no quantization of their incidence angle given by the modulus @xmath53 and in addition that they carry an extra modulus , the angle @xmath55 where they hit the circle @xmath54 .",
    "t - duality with the cigar suggests that these d1 branes can hit only special points on the @xmath54 circle of the trumpet and it is suggested also ( see @xcite ) that they correspond to bound states of d1 branes orthogonal to the circle with a number of @xmath56 branes .",
    "we should also emphasize that the trumpet has a strong coupling singularity at @xmath54 and therefore it is plausible that our analysis might be valid only for branes which extend far enough from the singularity .",
    "nevertheless the considerable success of our semiclassical analysis and the similar results of @xcite for the spectrum of the theory suggest that there should be a grain of truth in our results .",
    "notice that we have not been able to identify the brane of @xmath49 , if any , where the @xmath57 branes on the cigar and their t - dual @xmath56 descent from .",
    "one might think that the d0 brane of the cigar comes from the point brane of @xmath4 but there seems to be a contradiction when one tries to construct the @xmath56 by descending from this brane to the trumpet .",
    "the point in @xmath4 will still be a point in cigar or trumpet .",
    "these shortcomings of our semiclassical analysis should be eliminated once we are able to have the complete boundary state for these branes .",
    "finally notice that since the cigar is actually t - dual to an orbifold of the trumpet , one needs to rescale the string coupling by @xmath58 when comparing quantities under t - duality .",
    "the boundary states for branes in @xmath4 has been a long and rather subtle problem . the non - compactness of the group results in infinities for most physically relevant quantities which must be dealt with caution . on top of",
    "that only recently @xcite was a significant aspect of the spectrum , that of spectral flow , understood .",
    "nevertheless one can work in the euclidean analog of @xmath15 and try to construct branes in the @xmath59 hyperbolic space .",
    "this method was employed in @xcite and the boundary state of a brane with @xmath34 world - volume was constructed among other branes of the background .",
    "it was claimed that due to the time independence of this particular set of branes on can descent trivially to the corresponding branes in the coset @xmath60 which describes the cigar geometry .",
    "these branes couple only to closed string momentum modes as expected by their geometry .",
    "this in turn implies , due to the discrete representation constrains , that only closed strings in the continuous representations couple to the brane .",
    "we will work along the lines of @xcite to study the semiclassical approximation to the open string spectrum of the branes .",
    "it is easy to understand by the shape of the @xmath61 branes ( see also @xcite ) that open string winding states should appear in the spectrum and not momentum ones . since open string states satisfy the same constrains for the allowed quantum numbers as closed ones , continuous states as well as discrete ones with winding @xmath62 are allowed . in the semiclassical limit",
    "only the winding zero state survives since all other ones become heavy and decouple .",
    "then computing the open string spectrum of these branes using the dbi in the cigar geometry we expect to see only continuous representations since the discrete ones are forbidden for @xmath63 .",
    "the purpose of the following analysis is to compute the small fluctuation spectra on these branes and confirm the expected spectrum .",
    "in addition we will compute the semiclassical reflection coefficient and determine the density of open string states .",
    "we use the dbi lagrangian for d1 strings with embedding @xmath64 where @xmath65 and we assume a fluctuation @xmath66 around the classical background .",
    "the time is @xmath67 not to be confused with @xmath17 .",
    "expanding the dbi action we get : @xmath68 \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the first term is the energy density of our d - brane .",
    "the first order variation vanishes when we integrate it on the world - volume of the brane since to have a small fluctuation @xmath69 for @xmath70 in cartesian coordinates .",
    "the equations of motion for the quadratic fluctuations give a hypergeometric equation .",
    "the solution shows no poles which would signify bound states and it turns out that for the wave like solutions with the correct asymptotic behavior the solutions is : @xmath71 where we have assumed ( semiclassical approximation ) @xmath72 , for @xmath73 .",
    "the term @xmath74 describes an outgoing wave and @xmath75 an incoming one .",
    "the ratio of the coefficients of these two terms is the semiclassical approximation to the reflection coefficient of a state coming from infinity .",
    "now , we can compute the semiclassical limit of the relative density of states between a brane with modulus @xmath76 and a reference brane @xmath77 : @xmath78 where the function @xmath79 is the semiclassical limit of the reflection coefficient for an open string state .",
    "we compute a relative density of states since the density of states for a single brane is infinite due to the non - compactness of its world - volume .",
    "our results agree with @xcite .",
    "in this note we have determined solutions of the dbi for d0 , d1 and d2 branes in the cigar and trumpet geometries . some aspects of those branes in realistic string backgrounds will be further discussed in @xcite.we have also computed the small fluctuations spectrum for one kind of them ( the @xmath61 ) and found agreement with geometrical and cft expectations .",
    "one might wonder if we can get useful information for the winding states on d1cig , by studying the spectrum of momentum modes in its t - dual , the @xmath80 .",
    "we have calculated the small fluctuation spectra of @xmath80 and found both discrete series states as well as continuous representations .",
    "the discrete series states appear with degeneracy one . for the continuous part of the spectrum the density of states turns out to be the same as ( [ pst ] ) .    as a final remark , in @xcite the spectral flow of semiclassical",
    "solution gives strings which wind half a time around the center of @xmath15 .",
    "these in the cigar should descent to half - winding open string states which is intuitively obvious from the shape of the @xmath61 .",
    "this implies that on the trumpet the @xmath80 should allow states which have half - angular momentum and are periodic only under a @xmath81 rotation .",
    "this deserves further investigation and we hope to return to this point in the future .      c.  bachas and m.  petropoulos , jhep * 0102 * ( 2001 ) 025 [ arxiv : hep - th/0012234 ] .",
