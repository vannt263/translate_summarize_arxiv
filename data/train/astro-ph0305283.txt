    "for accreting stellar binary systems in which the secondary star ( mass donating ) is on the main sequence , the minimum orbital period is @xmath280 mins ( paczynski & sienkiewicz 1981 ) . for secondary stars not on the main sequence ( such as helium stars ) , systems can also have orbital periods less than 80 min ( savonije , de kool & van den heuvel 1986 and references therein ) . the other option for short period systems",
    "is that the secondary star must be degenerate forming a double degenerate binary with a compact primary .",
    "a number of these systems have been known for some time although it is only relatively recently that their nature has been revealed ( cf warner 1995 ) .",
    "the orbital periods of these systems lie in the tens of mins range .",
    "recently a group of three binaries have been discovered in which the orbital period is thought to be less than @xmath210mins : es cet ( kuv01584@xmath30939 ) 10.3 min ( warner & woudt 2002 ) , v407 vul ( rx j1914 + 24 ) 9.5 mins ( cropper et al 1998 ) and rx j0806 + 15 , 5.4min ( ramsay , hakala & cropper 2002a , israel et al .",
    "if these periods have been correctly identified as the binary orbital period , then these have the shortest known binary periods . as such they should be strong sources of gravitational waves .    in the case of es cet ,",
    "strong he lines are seen in optical spectra ( wegner et al .",
    "1987 ) which have recently been found to be double peaked ( p.  woudt , priv .  comm . ) suggesting the presence of a disk . in the case of v407 vul ,",
    "no emission lines are seen ( ramsay et al .",
    "2002b ) while rx j0806 + 15 shows only weak he lines",
    "( israel et al .  2002 ) . very recently",
    "( israel et al .  2003 ) demonstrated that the optical and x - ray emission of rx j0806 + 15 are in anti - phase , as in the case of v407 vul ( ramsay et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "currently there are several models to explain the observations of v407 vul and rx j0806 + 15 .",
    "a neutron star primary and an intermediate polar model can not be excluded although they are considered unlikely .",
    "the most likely models all have a white dwarf primary and secondary . two models ( a polar and a direct accretor model ) are driven by mass transfer while one ( a unipolar inductor or electric star model ) is driven by an electrical current .",
    "of these models the unipolar inductor model fits the observational properties better than the accretion models , although these can not be ruled out ( cropper et al .",
    "2003 ( review ) , wu et al .",
    "2002 , marsh & steeghs 2002 , ramsay et al .",
    "2002a and norton et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "the best method to differentiate between these models is to measure the period change of these systems . for systems driven by mass transfer",
    "the period should increase over time ( eg savonije , de kool & van den heuvel 1986 , nelemans et al .",
    "2001 ) . in the case of the unipolar inductor model , the system should be driven entirely by gravitational radiation and the period should decrease ( wu et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "strohmayer ( 2002 ) showed using _",
    "observations that for v407 vul the period is _ decreasing _ at a rate consistent with that predicted from the emission of gravitational radiation . in this paper",
    "we present observations of the 5 min system rx j0806 + 15 and determine the change in the period .",
    "we then discuss the implications of this result .",
    "in order to measure possible period changes in rxj0806 + 15 , we have obtained data from the nordic optical telescope la palma between 5th and 8th of january 2003 and 5th and 7th of february 2003 .",
    "these observations consist of high speed ccd photometry with an approximate time resolution of 15 sec ( 10 sec integration time ) .",
    "the observations were carried out using alfosc in imaging mode without any filter .",
    "we binned the ccd chip by a factor of two in both directions and selected only a small 100x100 subwindow for fast readout .",
    "a total of 4687 images were obtained .",
    "these were bias corrected and flatfielded in the usual manner .",
    "conditions in january 2003 were photometric and the seeing was typically better than 1 `` . in february , however , seeing was poorer ( about 1''.5 ) .",
    "additionally some archival eso vlt data from 2001 november 12 was analysed to provide further constraints for a period from our earlier ( january 2002 ) not run .",
    "there were a total of 214 data points that were combined with our 1314 datapoints from two nights in january 2002 .",
    "these data were also reduced using standard procedures .",
    "all of the data were heliocentric corrected .",
    "there are also some archival _ chandra _ observations available .",
    "however , given the length of the observation ( 20 ksec ) , we have not included it here .",
    "we have three different datasets that can be used to search for the change in the orbital period ( table 1 ) .",
    "chronologically these are : i ) the _ rosat _ observations from 1994 - 95 , ii ) the combined vlt data from nov 2001 and not data from jan 2002 and finally iii ) the not data from jan - feb 2003",
    ". we will now proceed to estimate the best period for each of these datasets and then use the results to derive the change in the orbital period .",
    "the earliest of our three datasets is the 1994 - 1995 _ rosat _ data ( burwitz & reinsch 2001 ) .",
    "they found two possible values for the best period in their _ rosat _ data , namely : 321.5393 or 321.5465 s ( @xmath4 0.0004 s ) .",
    "their preference was the first of these .",
    "for consistency we have re - analysed the _ rosat _ data and confirm their results .    for our optical datasets",
    "we have used the lomb - scargle power spectrum ( scargle 1982 ) to search for the periods . however , in order to obtain reliable error estimates ( crucial for the @xmath5 measurement ) we have performed monte carlo simulations of our time series .",
    "this enables us to take into account the true effects of aliasing in a rigorous manner .",
    "our monte carlo approach consists of following steps .",
    "i ) find the best period using the lomb - scargle algorithm .",
    "ii ) fix the period and fit the light curve shape with a 2nd order fourier fit .",
    "iii ) then use the ( gaussian ) errors from the fourier fit to produce 10000 synthetic datasets using the same time points as in the original dataset and add noise comparable to the noise in real data .",
    "iv ) finally analyze the 10000 datasets around the best period . to do this in a reasonable amount of cpu time",
    ", we have used the minimum string length method ( dwortesky , 1983 ) which can be easily restricted to the immediate neighbourhood of the best period .    [ cols=\"<,<,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]             our second dataset , which consists of vlt data from nov 2001 and not data from jan 2002 is problematic in terms of aliasing .",
    "both of these runs are too short to phase them together in a unique manner and as a result severe aliasing arises .",
    "however , we can use some _ a priori _ information from our later , jan - feb 2003 , not run to remove the aliasing ( i.e. pick the right spike from a handful of possible spikes suggested by the lomb - scargle analysis and the subsequent monte carlo simulation ) .",
    "the @xmath5 from jan 2003 data combined with the _ rosat _ runs is about 1.2 msec / year .",
    "further , our best period from not 2003 run is 321.52957s @xmath4 0.00045s ( see below ) . assuming these values we can estimate that the period in jan 2002 should be approximately 321.532s .",
    "the possible spikes present in the periodogram are 321.515s , 321.534s and 321.552s",
    ". only one of these ( 321.534s ) has a period close to the _ rosat _ and not 2003 periods .",
    "if we now assume this is the correct power peak , we can use our monte carlo study to get 321.53352s @xmath4 0.00034s for our second run .",
    "the third run consists of data from three consecutive nights in jan 2003 ( 5th-8th ) and from two nights in feb 2003 ( 5th and 6th ) . this run does not suffer from serious aliasing and using the monte carlo technique outline above , we find 321.52957 @xmath4 0.00045 s as the best period .",
    "we have plotted the periodogram of the not 2003 run in figure 1 .",
    "the inset shows the part near the best period .",
    "to measure the possible change in the orbital period .",
    "we have fitted our periods from three different epochs ( defined as the mean of the time points from each of the epochs ) with a linear fit ( figure 2 ) .",
    "depending on the choice of which _ rosat _ period we use , we obtain two sets of frequency ( @xmath6 ) and @xmath7 . if we adopt 321.5393s as the true _ rosat _ period ( as preferred by burwitz & reinsch , 2001 ) .",
    "we get @xmath8 = @xmath9 hz / s . on the other hand , the longer _ rosat _ period 321.5465 s yields @xmath10 hz / s . in both cases",
    "the error is @xmath11 hz / s .",
    "judging from our fit , the latter period of the two is better .",
    "neither of the fits is very good , but given the number of measurements to be fitted ( three ) , we can not make a definitive conclusion between the two solutions .",
    "we have also folded both the 2002 and 2003 not data over the orbital period and plotted that in figure 3 . in order to do this ,",
    "we need to adopt a value for @xmath8 that gives us the correct phasing .",
    "this can be used as a feasibility test for our model where the period is decreasing .",
    "we find two epochs when the flux should be at minimum , one just before the 2002 not dataset and another before the 2003 not dataset .",
    "these are hjd : 2452288.999256 and 2452645.436696 .",
    "now , to produce correct phasing an integer number of ( changing ) periods must have passed in between these two epochs . as we expect the period change to be linear , at least in short time scale",
    ", we can estimate an average number of periods that have passed ( 95780 ) using the average of the best periods from the 2002 and 2003 datasets as the mean period",
    ". we can then check if we can produce the correct phasing using our best periods for the two epochs together with the two possible values of @xmath8 , and their errors . as a result",
    "we conclude that the data can be phased together using either of the two @xmath8 values .",
    "the larger @xmath8 produces a better fit , but we can not exclude the smaller @xmath8 .    the resulting phase folded light curves are plotted in figure 3 .",
    "the modulation and its asymmetry is roughly the same in both datasets . however , it seems like the 2003 data shows a broader , flatter flux maximum than the earlier dataset .",
    "the two datasets are identical in terms of instrumentation used .",
    "the current competing models for the system can be classified into two types : accreting and non - accreting models ( cf  1 ) .",
    "the accreting and the non - accreting models can be distinguished by determining the period change in the system .    as @xmath12 , we can calculate @xmath13 from the orbital parameters of the system . for an accreting system ,",
    "the period change is given by : @xmath14 ( appendix a ) , where @xmath15 is the orbital angular momentum , @xmath16 is the mass of the secondary star , @xmath17 is the ratio of the mass of the secondary star to the primary star . for systems with matter transfer from the secondary to the primary ,",
    "@xmath18 is negative whereas @xmath19 is positive . in general",
    ", @xmath20 may take a positive or negative value depending on @xmath15 and the driving mechanism of the mass transfer .",
    "however , if the secondary is a degenerate star , @xmath21 is positive ( i.e.  negative @xmath22 ) when the angular momentum loss from the system is due to gravitational radiation ( see ritter 1986 ) .    for non - accreting system with",

    "if the 321.5 s period is the orbital period of the system , the observed period change is not consistent with the prediction of the accreting models but is consistent with non - accreting models .",
    "if we interpret that the observed period is the spin period of the white dwarf in an intermediate polar , both spin up and down is possible .",
    "however , we consider that the spin - interpretation is unlikely ( cropper et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "in contrast , the detected decrease in the orbital period strongly favours the non - accreting models , in particular the unipolar - inductor model ( wu et al .",
    "2002 ) , in which the two stars in the systems are white dwarfs . in this model ,",
    "angular momentum loss from the system and system evolution is due to gravitational radiation and the spin - orbit coupling process ( if present ) via unipolar induction .    in the abscence of accretion",
    "the secondary must reside well within its roche lobe . from the roche - lobe relation of eggleton ( 1983 ) and the nauenberg ( 1972 ) mass - radius relation for white dwarfs",
    ", we find that for @xmath33 and an orbital period of 321.5  s , the white dwarf secondary , @xmath34 in order that it stays within its roche lobe .    now , suppose that the observed period is the orbital period and that the change is due to orbital evolution .",
    "we show in figure 4 the predicted change in frequency for a range of component masses , for the case with no spin - orbit coupling . using the longer",
    "_ rosat _ period , we find that for @xmath35=1.0  m@xmath36 a secondary mass of 0.3  m@xmath36 is required . for a less massive primary , a more massive secondary is required .",
    "taking the shorter _ rosat _ period , a @xmath35=1.0  m@xmath36 primary requires a secondary of mass @xmath370.15  m@xmath36 .",
    "the studies of double white dwarf systems ( eg marsh 2000 , napiwotzki et al .",
    "2002 ) have shown that all such systems tend to have a mass ratios of the order of 1.0 .",
    "furthermore , the individual white dwarf masses in these systems are below 0.5 m@xmath36 .",
    "such masses are compatible with the measured period change . in all of the above mentioned cases , the deduced masses for the secondary are consistent with requirement that the star is detached from its critical roche surface .",
    "if the masses of the system could be determined independently , the degree to which the period decrease differs from that expected from gravitational radiation losses alone would provide information on the degree of asynchronism in the spin of the primary .",
    "this asynchronism is the origin of the power generation in the unipolar inductor model , so continuing timing observations are essential to determine whether this is consistent with the observed luminosity and reasonable component masses .    to conclude we note that for perfectly acceptable masses of the components , the @xmath8 is compatible with gravitational radiation .",
    "this is consistent with the results for v407 vul ( strohmeyer 2002 ) .",
    "the implication is that there is no mass transfer in either of these systems , favouring the unipolar inductor ( electric star ) model .     as a function of the component masses ( assuming no spin - orbit coupling ) .",
