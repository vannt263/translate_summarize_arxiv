    "about 5 - 10% ( e.g. wolff 1968 ) of all intermediate mass ( b and a ) main sequence stars exhibit organised magnetic fields with strengths ranging between a few hundred and a few tens of thousands of gauss .",
    "the presence of these fields has important consequences for the structure of the atmospheres of these ap / bp stars , suppressing large - scale mixing and leading to an amazing array of atmospheric peculiarities which effectively define these stars spectroscopically ( e.g. adelman 1993 ) .",
    "their magnetic fields have clearly defined observational and physical properties which are totally different from those of the sun and other late - type stars .",
    "the fields are strong , with important dipolar components and filling factors near 100% ; the field structure is static in the rotating stellar reference frame , and appears to be stable on timescales of decades ; and the fields show only weak or no correlation with projected rotational velocity , main sequence age , and other physical parameters .    because these characteristics contrast so strongly with those of active cool stars ( the only other broad class of non - degenerate stars in which magnetic fields can be studied systematically ) , the magnetic ap / bp stars represent an important laboratory for investigating the fundamental physics associated with stellar and cosmic magnetism .",
    "in particular , because stars in this mass range are progenitors of both white dwarfs and neutron stars , their magnetic characteristics may provide important clues needed in order to understand magnetism in these degenerate objects .",
    "remarkably , very little is known about the formation and evolution of these magnetic fields .",
    "recent investigations by bagnulo et al .",
    "( 2003 , 2004 , 2006 ) and phnl et al .",
    "( 2003 , 2005 ) , showing that magnetic and chemically peculiar a - type stars are present in very young open clusters , strongly support the view that the _ fields are present in these stars at the time they reach the main sequence .",
    "_ this suggests that the magnetic fields observed in main sequence ap / bp stars are present , and possibly produced , within their pre - main sequence ( pms ) progenitors .",
    "this idea is also supported by the theoretical work of stpie ( 2000 ) and of stpie and landstreet ( 2002 ) , which suggest that strong magnetic fields are required at the pre - main sequence phase in order to produce the slow rotation which is commonly observed in the ap / bp stars . the primary aim of this study is to test these propositions by searching for direct evidence of magnetic fields in the photospheres of a statistically useful sample of pms stars of intermediate mass .",
    "a second motivation of this study is to explore the general role of magnetic fields in the late stages of formation of intermediate - mass stars .",
    "accretion onto lower - mass pms t tauri stars is now generally supposed to be mediated by the presence of strong , large - scale magnetic fields ( e.g. discussion by johns - krull et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and references therein ) .",
    "some authors ( e.g. vink et al .",
    "2002 , muzzerole et al .",
    "2004 ) have suggested that similar `` magnetospheric accretion '' may occur in intermediate - mass pms stars as well .",
    "the observations presented here provide a unique opportunity to explore this proposal .",
    "many intermediate - mass pms stars are identifiable observationally as herbig ae / be ( haebe ) stars ( herbig 1960 ; cohen & kuhi 1979 ; finkenzeller & mundt 1984 ; hillebrand et al",
    "haebe stars are characterised by spectral types a and b with strong , often ubiquitous emission lines .",
    "they are distinguished from the classical ae / be stars by their ir colours and frequent presence within dust - obscured regions and association with nebulae ( waters & waelkens 1998 ) . according to standard stellar evolution theory , haebe stars should not posses deep outer convection zones which generate important quantities of outward - flowing mechanical energy .",
    "rather , these stars are expected to have convective cores surrounded by primarily radiative sub - photospheric envelopes ( iben 1965 ; gilliland 1986 ) . however , since 1980 , repeated observations of these stars ( e.g. praderie et al .",
    "1982 ; felenbok et al . 1983 ; catala et al . 1986 ; hamann & persson 1992 ) have shown that many are intensely active .",
    "in particular , they display characteristics often associated with magnetic activity and the presence of chromospheres or coronae ( e.g. skinner & yamauchi 1996 ; swartz et al .",
    "these properties have been proposed as indicators that at least some of these stars or their circumstellar envelopes are intensely magnetically active .",
    "previous attempts to detect magnetic fields in haebe stars have produced varied results .",
    "catala et al .",
    "( 1993 ) attempted to detect zeeman circular polarisation in the fe  ii @xmath05018 and he  i  @xmath1 lines in the spectrum of the prototypical haebe star ab aur .",
    "high resolution , high signal - to - noise ratio spectra of ab aur resulted in no detection of a magnetic field , with upper limits on the order of 1 kg . a survey undertaken by glagolevski & chountonov ( 1998 ) , including a larger sample of stars , also found no fields , but with relatively poor precision . on the other hand , donati et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and donati ( 2000 ) reported the probable and definite ( respectively ) detection of a circular polarisation signature in metallic lines of the herbig ae star hd 104237 , providing the first detection of a magnetic field in a haebe star .",
    "more recently , hubrig et al . ( 2004 , 2006a ) have claimed the detection of strong magnetic fields in several haebe stars .",
    "clearly , indirect and direct evidence for the presence of magnetic fields in some haebe stars in increasing , but it remains very sparse .    in this study , we use the low - resolution spectropolarimeter fors1 at the eso vlt to conduct a search for magnetic fields in about 50 haebe stars , the largest such sample ever studied .",

    "our study required the selection of a relatively large number of haebe stars to allow us to derive statistically meaningful conclusions about the presence of magnetic fields in these stars , and the relationship of magnetic haebe stars to the ap / bp stars .",

    "( 1994 ) contains six categories of stars ; the stars selected for our study were obtained only from the first category , which contains stars historically known as haebe stars , or strong candidates of the group .",
    "according to the authors , all of these stars possess near- or far - infrared excess and emission lines , associated with the presence of circumstellar dust , discs and energetic ouflows which are usually found in haebe stellar environments . on the other hand , vieira et al .",
    "( 2003 ) produced a catalogue of haebe stars and strong candidates from an initial search for new t tauri stars ( pre - main sequence stars of lower mass ) using the infrared astronomical satellite ( _ iras _ ) point source catalogue .",
    "because the initial search was based on circumstellar dust properties , it included haebe stars along with the t tauri stars .",
    "viera et al .",
    "extracted the haebe stars by filtering the data using specific requirements such as a spectral type earlier than f5 , emission at h@xmath5 , and a minimum level of infrared emission .",
    "the majority of the stars were associated by the authors with a star forming region ( sfr ) .",
    "based on the quality of these two literature sources and the arguments presented by their authors , we conclude that all of the stars in our sample are _ bona fide _ haebe stars . in total , 50 haebe stars have been selected , spanning in a spectral type range from f2 through b0 .    the selected stars are listed in table  1 .",

    "as can be seen in table  1 , 7 objects have no well - determined physical parameters in the literature .",

    "the sample stars were observed at the european southern observatory ( eso ) very large telescope ( vlt ) with the first of the two focal reducer and low dispersion spectrographs ( fors1 ) .",
    "fors1 was mounted at the cassegrain focus of one of the telescope units and was used in spectropolarimetric _ fast _ mode .",
    "a total of about five nights were allocated for our study , distributed over three observing runs ( visitor mode runs in february ( p72 ) and november 2004 ( p74 ) , and one service mode run of director s discretionary time in april 2004 ) .",
    "the large majority of our spectra were obtained with the grism 600 b , which covers the spectral range from 3450 to 5900 , and yields a dispersion of 1.2  per pixel .",
    "spectra were obtained with a slit width of 0.5 `` or 0.8 '' , yielding a resolving power of 1560 or 975 , respectively . in a few cases ,",
    "grism 1200 g ( now decommissioned ) was used , which covers the spectral range from 4310 to 5490    ( which includes h@xmath7 and h@xmath8 only ) .",
    "its dispersion is 0.6  per pixel , and with a slit width of 0.5 `` or 0.8 '' , this grism yields a resolving power of 2800 or 1800 , respectively .",
    "sixty - eight observations of the 50 targets were obtained in circularly polarised light following the procedure described by bagnulo et al .",
    "the light gathered by the telescope is sent through the longitudinal atmospheric dispersion corrector and the instrument collimator , then passes through a single slit into the top section of the fors1 instrument .",
    "there , the stellar light passes through a rotatable quarter - wave plate ( located in the filter / camera section of fors1 ) oriented at @xmath9 with respect to the fast axis of the analyser , which converts the circularly polarised light into linearly polarized light .",
    "the orthogonal linearly polarized beams are then separated by the wollaston prism before being dispersed by a grism .",
    "two spectra ( each corresponding to one of the oppositely polarised beams ) are finally recorded simultaneously on the ccd . by changing the orientation of the quarter - wave plate with respect to the wollaston fast axis ( alternately @xmath10 or @xmath11 ) and obtaining an additional exposure ,",
    "the positions of the right and left circularly polarised beams are exchanged throughout the instrument , and in particular their respective positions on the ccd are interchanged . as described in the fors1 manual ( vlt - man - eso-13100 - 1543 ) , this procedure allows for the removal of systematic errors due to ccd inhomogeneities and differential wavelength calibration errors .    in order to obtain a high signal - to - noise ratio , multiple exposures of each star were obtained .",
    "an even number of exposures ( between 2 and 30 , depending on the apparent magnitude of the star and the seeing ) was obtained , each pair of exposures corresponding to a quarter - wave plate orientation of either @xmath12 or @xmath13 .",
    "the data were reduced using the procedure described in detail by bagnulo et al .",
    "( 2006 ) .",
    "the journal of observations ( table  2 ) reports our observations of both standard and programme stars .",
    "it should be noted that grism 600b was used for all observations unless indicated otherwise ( in which case grism 1200 g was used ) .",
    "table  2 includes the julian date of mid - observation , the slit width , exposure time and number of exposures , and the resultant peak signal - to - noise ratio per  .",
    "the table also contains the results of the magnetic field diagnosis , which are discussed in sect .",
    "the longitudinal magnetic field has been inferred from the polarisation spectra in the manner described by bagnulo et al .",
    "briefly , the field diagnosis is obtained using a least - squares fit based on the predicted circularly polarised flux @xmath14 in the weak - field regime , given by    @xmath15    where @xmath16 is the effective land factor , _ i _ is the usual ( unpolarised ) intensity , @xmath0 is the wavelength expressed in  , @xmath17  is the longitudinal field expressed in gauss , and @xmath18    where @xmath19 is the electron charge , @xmath20 the electron mass , and @xmath21 the speed of light . for the atmosphere of a main sequence a or b type star , the weak - field approximation holds , for h lines , up to around 10 - 20 kg , and , for metal lines ,",
    "up to about 1 kg .    to derive the longitudinal field , we minimise the expression @xmath22 where , for each pixel @xmath23 in the reduced spectrum , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 is a constant term . uncertainties @xmath27 associated with each reduced spectral pixel are obtained as described by bagnulo et al .",
    "the longitudinal field uncertainty is obtained from the formal uncertainly of the linear regression , and its derivation is described by bagnulo et al .",
    "( 2002 ) .",
    "as is discussed later in this section , we encountered a number of cases for which the field was detected at about the 3-@xmath28 level , and in which minor changes in the data reduction would transform a marginal detection in a null or into a definite detection .",
    "although these cases should certainly be investigated further via additional observations , we tried to extract further information from the available spectra , to formulate a more robust and reliable criterion for field detection .",
    "each observation block consisted of several pairs of observations obtained with the retarder waveplate at @xmath11 and @xmath10 .",
    "as explained by bagnulo et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , there are two ways to determine @xmath17 .  _",
    "( i ) _ one can combine all observations to obtain a final , high signal to noise ratio stokes @xmath29 profile , from which is determined a unique value of @xmath17 . _",
    "( ii ) _ alternatively , one can combine individual pairs of frames obtained at @xmath11 and @xmath10 to obtain several lower signal - to - noise ratio stokes @xmath29 profiles , which yield several @xmath30 determinations .",
    "the final @xmath17  value is computed from the average of these @xmath30 values .",
    "if both methods yield a detection at the @xmath31 level or higher , we flag the observation with `` d '' ( implying a definite detection according to both criteri ) . if a @xmath31 detection is obtained with only one of the two methods , we flag the observation with `` d '' . finally , if both methods yields a null detection ( @xmath32 ) we flag the observation with `` n '' .",
    "this procedure has been repeated four different ways : using the whole spectrum , using only metal ( and he ) lines , using all balmer lines , and using all balmer lines except h@xmath7 .",
    "( in our grism 600b observations , h@xmath7 typically exhibits the strongest emission of any of the balmer lines , with emission intensity decreasing strongly for higher series members .",
    "measurement of the field using only balmer lines h@xmath8 and higher is an attempt to mitigate the effects of this emission . )",
    "a flag `` n '' , `` d '' , or `` d '' , as defined above , was assigned to each kind of analysis .",
    "it is clear that a series `` dddd '' denotes a certain detection , a `` nnnn '' series denotes a null detecion , whereas intermediate cases ( including possibly `` d '' flags ) indicate the need of further observations to fully asses whether the star is magnetic or not .",
    "the results of the four diagnoses of the magnetic field are summarised in columns 6 - 9 of table 2 , with their significance summarised in column 10 .      in order to evaluate the nominal operation of the instrument , and the accuracy of the reduction and analysis techniques , we observed both magnetic and non - magnetic standard stars .",
    "the magnetic ap star hd 94660 ( spectral type a0p ) was observed 4 times : twice ( consecutively ) during the p72 run with grism 600b , and twice during the p74 run with both grism 600b and grism 1200 g .",
    "the non - magnetic a1v star hd 96441 was observed during the ddt run .",
    "the magnetic diagnosis for these standard stars is included in table 2 .                in p72 ,",
    "the field of hd 94660 measured in balmer lines was @xmath33  g and @xmath34  g , and the fields measured in all balmer lines except h@xmath7 were @xmath35  g and @xmath36  g. the consistency of these results is expected for a main sequence ap star with no balmer line emission . on the other hand ,",
    "the fields measured in metal lines were significantly weaker , @xmath37  g and @xmath38  g. as discussed by bagnulo et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , inconsistency between metal line and balmer line longitudinal fields is common in stars with strong fields , and likely results from a breakdown of the weak - field assumption ( in the case of metallic lines ) , possibly coupled with the influence of nonuniform surface distributions of metal abundances .",
    "moreover , these two measurements were obtained using different slit widths ( 0.5 vs. 1 arcsec ) . to explore the possible effects of the slit size difference",
    ", we have performed a few numerical experiments , computing polarised synthetic spectra and degrading the resolution of both stokes @xmath39 and @xmath29 to an adjustable value .",
    "we computed the binned and smoothed @xmath29 and @xmath40 , and calculated the slope and inferred longitudinal field from the regression .",
    "the interesting result is that as the resolving power degrades below about 2000 , the deduced field from metallic lines starts to change a lot .",
    "it generally gets smaller , but it varies in a somewhat unpredictable manner .",
    "this appears to be basically because , as we reduce the resolution , we are going from the regime where each depression in the observed spectrum is roughly one line to the regime where each depression is one blend of nearby strong lines , and treating this as a single line is an increasingly bad approximation .",
    "on the other hand , changing the resolving power will have negligible effect on balmer lines ( as observed ) . from this",
    "we conclude that it is best to use the highest resolving power possible ( i.e. a 0.5 arcsec slit ) to get the most out of the metallic line spectrum , and that probably the difference between the two metallic line measurements of hd 94660 is due to some combination of the seeing and the slit size .    in p74 ,",
    "the field measured in balmer lines from both the grism 600b and grism 1200 g observations are consistent , and equal to @xmath41  g ( 600b ) and @xmath42  g ( 1200 g ) .",
    "the fields measured in metal lines ( @xmath43  g and @xmath44  g ) are also in reasonably good agreement",
    ".    the results for hd 94660 are fully consistent with those described by bagnulo et al .",
    "in particular , the fields measured during p74 agree to within @xmath45 with the fields reported by them .",
    "stokes @xmath39 and @xmath29 profiles of hd 94660 are illustrated in fig .",
    "the single observation of hd 96441 , obtained during the ddt run , was consistent with zero field ( @xmath46  g in balmer lines , and @xmath47  g in metal lines ) .",
    "two hundred and seventy - two magnetic field measurements have been obtained from the 68 observations of the 50 programme stars . the mean peak s / n ( per angstrom ) of the spectra was 2990:1 , but varied significantly from 1340:1 - 5720:1 due to seeing and transparency conditions , and apparent brightness of the target . the range of s / n results in a relatively large range of longitudinal field uncertainties ( all uncertainties in this paper are at 1@xmath28 confidence ) . for measurements obtained from balmer lines only , the mean uncertainty was 66  g , ranging from 19 to 162  g. for metal lines only , the mean uncertainty was 105  g , ranging from 21 to 291  g. for the full spectrum , the mean uncertainty was 48  g , ranging from 16 to 102  g. these distributions are illustrated in fig .",
    "3 ( the distribution for all balmer lines excluding h@xmath7 was very similar to that of all balmer lines , and so is not illustrated here ) .",
    "the distribution of error bars for the metal line measurements is somewhat broader than for the balmer line or full spectrum regressions . as pointed out by bagnulo et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , this is due to the fact that balmer lines have similar strength in most of these stars , whereas metal lines change greatly from star to star .",
    "although it is true that the diversity of balmer line profiles in spectra of haebe stars is somewhat greater than for main sequence a and b stars , the responsible emission effects are mostly visible in h@xmath5 , and to a lesser degree in h@xmath7 . at the resolution of fors1 , the profiles of higher members of the series are very similar to those of main sequence stars .",

    "this range is fully consistent with the canonical incidence of 5 - 10% ( e.g. wolff 1968 ) of magnetic ap and bp stars on the main sequence , and therefore with the fossil - field hypothesis .",
    "in fact , because the observed sample is strongly biased to stars with masses from @xmath118 , which correspond to approximate main sequence @xmath86 colour indices of + 0.14 to -0.1 , we would expect that the magnetic field incidence of a sample of main sequence stars with a similar distribution of masses to be somewhat higher than the canonical value ( based on the incidence distributions of wolff 1968 ) .        under the fossil - field hypothesis , the magnetic fields of the detected herbig ae / be stars are to become those of ap / bp stars on the main sequence .",

    "however , the results reported by wade et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , folsom et al .",
    "( 2006 ) and alecian et al .",
    "( 2006 ) for hd  72106a , v380 ori and hd  200775 , and by catala et al .",
    "( 2006 ) for hd  190073 , indicate that the magnetic fields of these objects are clearly organised on large scales , and that the fields of v380 ori , hd  72106a and hd  200775 have important dipolar components .",
    "the strong longitudinal fields measured here for hd  101412 and bf  ori also suggest that these fields are organised on large scales - longitudinal fields corresponding to the more complex magnetic topologies associated with dynamo - generated fields in cool stars seldom exceed a few tens of g for stars of moderate activity , and peak at about 100  g for the most active late - type stars ( petit et al .",
    "2005 ; petit , private communication ) .",
    "it therefore appears likely that for most , and possibly all , of the detected stars have magnetic fields that are structured on global scales .",
    "this is consistent with the fossil - field hypothesis .",
    "bohlender & landstreet ( 1990 ) examined the longitudinal magnetic field characteristics of the sample of 12 ap stars brighter than @xmath119 north of @xmath120 .",
    "although small , this magnitude - limited sample probably provides a realistic approximation of the real distribution of most magnetic field strengths of ap stars .",
    "they found that the typical rms longitudinal magnetic field of the sample is 330  g , with an intrinsic spread of about 170  g. the mean rms longitudinal field measured for the haebe stars detected in this and other studies is roughly 200  g ( donati et al .",
    "1997 and donati , priv .",
    "wade et al .",
    "2005 ; catala et al . 2006 ; alecian , priv . comm . ) .",
    "the uncertainty on the latter value is difficult to quantify , given the sparse observations and the diversity of data sources , but it is probably of order 100  g.    if the fossil - field model is indeed correct , we should in fact expect the fields of haebe stars to be somewhat weaker than those of the ap stars , due to the larger radii of the pms stars .",
    "this `` field dilution '' can be calculated approximately for each star using the squared ratio of the current stellar radius to the radius of that star upon reaching the zams , @xmath121 .",
    "this was performed using the interpolated pms evolutionary model calculations of palla & stahler ( 1993 ) .",
    "each star in fig . 1 was associated with an evolutionary track and `` evolved forward '' to the zams , at which point its radius was calculated from its predicted zams luminosity and effective temperature .",
    "the average `` field dilution '' factor is about 0.5 , indicating that we should expect the mean rms longitudinal field of haebe stars in this sample to be about 50% weaker than that of zams ap / bp stars , if the latter descend from the former .",
    "in fact , the sample of ap stars studied by bohelender & landstreet ( 1994 ) is probably somewhat evolved ; hence the calculated dilution probably represents an upper limit on what we could expect to observe .",
    "utimately , given the large intrinsic spread of the ap stars and the uncertainties associated with the haebe stars , we are unable to critically constrain field dilution , and we note that rms field strengths of both groups of stars are approximately equal .    because the magnetic fields of haebe stars are expected , under such a model , to be systematically weaker than those of ap / bp stars , the likelihood of obtaining observational `` false negatives '' is higher , in particular as we have no obvious way of pre - selecting ( such as using chemical peculiarity , for example ) magnetic haebe stars from the general population of haebe stars .",
    "it may therefore be that magnetic haebe stars exist in our sample that we have not detected .",
    "the current study is generally insensitive to longitudinal magnetic fields below about 150  g , and this sensitivity limit is worse for stars with significant contamination of metallic or balmer lines by emission from circumstellar material .",
    "in addition , this study is unable to directly rule out the general presence of magnetic fields with complex structure ( e.g. dynamo - generated fields ) in the herbig ae / be stars : as discussed previously , the maximum longitudinal field intensity of dynamo - type magnetic fields is below our general detection threshold . ultimately , to the extent that these data are able to test the fossil - field hypothesis , they are in full agreement with its principles .      as was discussed in sect .",
    "1 , a motivation of this study is to explore the general role of magnetic fields in the late stages of formation of intermediate - mass stars .",
    "some investigators believe that haebe stars are the higher mass analogues of classical t tauri stars ( ctts ) , and that all of the phenomena associated with ctts are also operating in haebe stars , including magnetospheric accretion ( see for example muzerolle et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "magnetospheric accretion requires the presence of strong , large - scale magnetic fields at the stellar surface , and in the case of ctts the predicted field strengths range up to several kg for specific stars .",
    "johns - krull et al .",
    "( 1999 ) review three magnetospheric accretion models , providing equations yielding the surface magnetic field intensity required by each .",
    "these models assume aligned magnetic dipoles .",
    "we can use these same equations to roughly estimate the field strengths required for magnetospheric accretion in haebe stars . according to table 1 ,",
    "the mean measured @xmath122 of our sample is 115  . for a haebe star with a radius of 2  @xmath123 ( and assuming a rotational axis inclination @xmath124 for simplicity ) , this implies a rotational period of about 1 day . using the 3 models described by johns - krull et al .",
    ", for a haebe star with mass @xmath125 , radius @xmath126 , rotational period @xmath127  day , mass accretion rate @xmath128/yr ( see e.g. garcia lopez et al . 2006 , muzzerole et al . 2004 ) , and canonical values of model parameters @xmath129 and @xmath8 , we compute that a dipole magnetic field with a _ surface polar _ intensity of about 500  g is required for magnetospheric accretion according to the models of knigl ( 1991 ) and shu et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , and about 100  g for the model of cameron & campbell ( 1993 ) .",
    "for all models , the required field strength increases with mass , period and accretion rate , and decreases with radius .",
    "we have already reported that our observations are not consistent with a uniform distribution of aligned magnetic rotators with @xmath115  g. our data are therefore not consistent with the general presence of magnetic fields with the strengths required by the models of knigl ( 1991 ) and shu et al .",
    "we therefore conclude that magnetospheric accretion according to the recipes of knigl ( 1991 ) and shu et al .",
    "( 1994 ) is not generally occurring in haebe stars . on the other hand , we are unable to rule out the general presence of the weaker fields required by the model of cameron & campbell ( 1993 ) .",
    "vink et al . ( 2002 ) report systematic differences in the linear polarisation signatures across the h@xmath5 line in spectra of herbig ae versus herbig be stars .",
    "they tentatively propose that this may indicate a transition from magnetically - mediated accretion in the ae stars to disc accretion in the be stars .",
    "our sample contains 14 late a - type stars ( with spectral type a3 or later ) , and a similar number of b - type stars ( 13 with spectral type b9.5 or earlier ) . excluding hd  101412 and bf  ori ( our tentative detections )",
    ", we find no statistically significant difference between the detection significance distributions of these two samples . therefore our observations provide no support for the suggestion of vink et al .",
    "( 2002 ) .    for those haebe stars in which magnetic fields have been detected , magnetospheric accretion according to any of these models may still be a viable hypothesis .",
    "the plausibility of such a proposal can only be tested by detailed investigation of the magnetic and physical properties of individual stars .",
    "such investigation is outside the scope of this paper , but it will form the focus of future work .      in conclusion , we comment that the general effectiveness of fors1 for studies of the magnetic properties of herbig ae / be stars appears to be rather limited . in support of this , we point out the lack of detection of 4 known magnetic stars in our sample ( hd  104237 , hd  72106a , v380 ori and hd  190073 ) , and to the questionable meaning of eq .",
    "( 1 ) when applied to balmer lines in emission .",
    "although fors1 does in principle provide the ability to detect magnetic fields in very rapidly - rotating haebe stars for which high - resolution spectropolarimetry is less sensitive , its typical detection threshold in this study ( about 150  g ) , apparent ambiguity of detection of fields with longitudinal intensities close to this threshold , and its insensitivity to magnetic fields in stars with emission - contaminated line profiles are substantial handicaps , making it poorly competitive for magnetic investigations of haebe stars as compared to high - resolution spectropolarimeters such as espadons at the canada - france - hawaii telescope and the new narval instrument , installed at the tlescope bernard lyot at pic du midi obsevratory .",
    "nevertheless , the results of the present paper are of considerable interest .",
    "in particular , we have ( 1 ) made possible a first assessment of the field strengths present in haebe stars , demonstrating the general absence of strong ( 0.5  kg ) , ordered magnetic fields ; ( 2 ) identified from a rather large sample a few apparently magnetic stars of great interest for further investigation ; and ( 3 ) made possible a first estimate of the fraction of haebe stars which may evolve to become magnetic ap / bp stars .",
    "all of these results are consistent with the primordial fossil field hypothesis , which proposes that magnetic fields in main sequence intermediate - mass stars are the slowly - decaying remnants of interstellar magnetic field swept up during star formation .",
    "finally , we have performed a first evaluation of the plausibility of magnetospheric accretion for herbig ae / be stars , ruling out the general applicability of the models of knigl ( 1991 ) and shu et al . ( 1994 ) .",

    "<S> an analysis of both balmer and metallic lines reveals the possible presence of weak longitudinal magnetic fields in photospheric lines of two haebe stars , hd 101412 and bf ori . </S>",
    "<S> results for two additional stars , cpd-53 295 and hd 36112 , are suggestive of the presence of magnetic fields , but no firm conclusions can be drawn based on the available data . </S>",
    "<S> the intensity of the longitudinal fields detected in hd 101412 and bf ori suggest that they correspond to globally - ordered magnetic fields with surface intensities of order 1  kg . on the other hand , no magnetic field </S>",

    "<S> monte carlo simulations of the longitudinal field measurements of the undetected stars allow us to place an upper limits of about 300  g on the general presence of aligned magnetic dipole magnetic fields , and of about 500  g on perpendicular dipole fields . </S>",
    "<S> taking into account the results of our survey and other published results , we find that the observed bulk incidence of magnetic haebe stars in our sample is 8 - 12% , in good agreement with that of magnetic main sequence stars of similar masses </S>",
    "<S> . we also find that the rms longitudinal field intensity of magnetically - detected haebe stars is about 200  g , similar to that of ap stars and consistent with magnetic flux conservation during stellar evolution . </S>",
    "<S> these results are all in agreement with the hypothesis that the magnetic fields of main sequence ap / bp stars are fossils , which already exist within the stars at the pre - main sequence stage . </S>",
