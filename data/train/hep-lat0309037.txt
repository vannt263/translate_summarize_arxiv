    "lattice qcd at nonzero density remains a difficult topic .",
    "several methods to solve the problems related to the complex phase of the dirac operator determinant have recently been suggested : multiparameter reweighting , taylor expansion , and analytic continuation from imaginary @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "so far , all three methods work only in the vicinity of the phase transition close to the temperature - axis . here , we instead explore the @xmath1-axis at zero temperature and small @xmath1 . in this",
    "region matrix models analytically predict the complex microscopic dirac spectrum @xcite .",
    "we test these predictions for pure su(3 ) gauge theory @xcite , where @xmath2 is easily implemented .",
    "although the quenched approximation is problematic @xcite , our test is an important check , as the matrix model remains valid and predictive for @xmath3 flavors .",
    "for example , the 1-flavor matrix model has been used to test a new factorization algorithm for the complex action problem @xcite .",
    "in fact , at @xmath4 the situation is analogous : while most tests of matrix model predictions have been performed only for pure gauge theories , dynamical fermions are also well described @xcite . for a review of matrix models in qcd",
    "we refer to ref .",
    "in ref .  @xcite a matrix model has been formulated in terms of @xmath5 complex eigenvalues and solved in the limit @xmath6 .",
    "it has the same global symmetries as qcd at @xmath2 due to an equivalence @xcite to the matrix model of ref .",
    "@xcite at small @xmath1 in the phase with broken chiral symmetry .",
    "we give here only the quenched results for the microscopic density and refer to ref .",
    "@xcite for more details and higher - order correlation functions .    in ref .",
    "@xcite two different large-@xmath5 limits were found , those of weak and of strong nonhermiticity . in qcd at @xmath4 , the lowest dirac eigenvalues scale with @xmath7 to build up a finite condensate according to the banks - casher relation . in the weak - nonhermiticity limit ,",
    "first introduced in @xcite , this scaling remains unchanged .",
    "the support of the density remains quasi one - dimensional as we send @xmath8 , keeping @xmath9 fixed . in the strong - nonhermiticity limit ,",
    "the eigenvalues fill a two - dimensional surface , and thus the scaling is modified to @xmath10 .",
    "we find for the quenched microscopic density at weak nonhermiticity in the sector of topological charge @xmath11",
    "@xcite @xmath12 \\\\ & & \\times\\int_0 ^ 1 dt\\ \\mbox{e}^{-\\alpha^2 t }    j_{|\\nu|}(\\sqrt{t}\\xi)j_{|\\nu|}(\\sqrt{t}\\xi^*)\\:.\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , we have rescaled the complex eigenvalues according to @xmath13 . at strong nonhermiticity",

    "( [ rhostrong ] ) is rotationally invariant in contrast to the macroscopic support .",
    "our lattice calculations were done using the staggered dirac operator with chemical potential @xmath2 for a pure su(3 ) gauge theory , corresponding to @xmath17 .",
    "there are two reasons for this choice .",
    "first , we need high statistics ( @xmath18 configurations data in figs .",
    "[ weakdata],[strongdata ] contain only 4,000 configurations , therefore the statistical errors are larger . ] ) to test the matrix model predictions of eqs .",
    "( [ rhoweak],[rhostrong ] ) .",
    "ginsparg - wilson type operators would be too expensive here .",
    "second , wilson fermions break chiral symmetry explicitly and have complex eigenvalues already at @xmath4 .    in the simulations , we have chosen @xmath19 in the strong - coupling regime for the following reason . at zero temperature and @xmath4 the matrix model",
    "@xcite is equivalent to a low - energy effective theory of qcd ( the effective chiral lagrangian ) in the so - called @xmath20-regime , where the zero - momentum modes of the pseudo - goldstone bosons dominate ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "when the nonzero - momentum modes start contributing , this equivalence breaks down .",
    "the corresponding scale , the so - called thouless energy , is a function of both @xmath21 and @xmath0 .",
    "as @xmath21 is increased , fewer eigenvalues are described by the matrix model , an effect that can be compensated by increasing @xmath0 . for our small volumes @xmath22 , however , we are limited to relatively small values of @xmath21 ( assuming a similar behavior of the thouless energy for small @xmath2 ) .    at strong coupling and thus away from the continuum limit , staggered fermions have the disadvantage of shifting the ( topological ) dirac zero modes and mixing them with the nonzero modes .",
    "we have accounted for this by setting @xmath23 in eqs .",
    "( [ rhoweak ] ) and ( [ rhostrong ] ) above .",
    "the three different lattice volumes are chosen in order to test the different scaling behavior of eigenvalues and chemical potential for weakly and strongly nonhermitian lattice dirac operators . for more simulation details",
