    "the experiment is conducted in a tow - tank of length 60 m , width 1.8 m and depth 2 m. the plate is towed by a fully automated carriage capable of speeds up to @xmath1 ms@xmath2 .",
    "the plate is 5.0 m long and 1.2 m wide with an elliptical leading edge .",
    "the boundary layer formed on the bottom surface of the plate is tripped using a 1 mm diameter trip wire .",
    "fluorescein is injected through a spanwise oriented slot located immediately downstream of the trip .",
    "the developing boundary layer is then illuminated using a continuous 4 w argon - ion laser which has been fanned into a streamwise / wall - normal sheet .",
    "images are acquired using a redlake y-3 classic high - speed camera , with @xmath3 pixel resolution .",
    "the approximate field of view for all visualisations is @xmath4 mm ( streamwise @xmath5 wall - normal ) .",
    "two flow visualisations are shown : one towed at a slower speed of 0.22 ms@xmath2 and the other at @xmath6 ms@xmath2 . by the trailing edge of the plate",
    ", the boundary layer develops to a friction reynolds number @xmath7 and @xmath8 respectively for the low and high speed experiments .",
    "here @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is boundary layer thickness , @xmath11 is wall - shear velocity and @xmath12 is the kinematic viscosity .",
    "the camera frame - rate is 25 hz for the low speed , and 90 hz for the high speed case .    by viewing the visualisations in slow motion",
    ", one can distinguish the origins of the interfacial bulging that forms at the edge of the boundary layer , leading to the well - known highly intermittent fluctuation statistics in this region .",
    "one can also observe eruptions of strongly vortical motions , originating close to the wall , and growing beyond this interface . connected with these events",
    "is the entrainment of irrotational fluid from the freestream into the boundary layer .",
    "these entrainment motions occasionally penetrate deep into the boundary layer , transporting high momentum fluid from the freestream to the near - wall region . by comparing the high and low speed visualisations ,",
    "the impact of reynolds number on the turbulent structure is clearly demonstrated . at the high reynolds number ,",
    "the increased mixing reduces the contrast in the flow visualisation .",
    "one can also observe smaller - scale motions and a more complicated multi - scale interface separating the freestream from the turbulence .",
    "ultimately this unique facility will be developed for high - speed time - resolved particle image velocimetry ( piv ) experiments to enable statistical analysis of the evolving structure of turbulence . in the meantime",
    ", these visualisations illustrate the complexity and beauty of the fluid motion within wall - bounded turbulence ."
