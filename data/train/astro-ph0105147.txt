    "the [ cii](@xmath1 ) ( @xmath2 m ) line of singly ionized carbon is the dominant cooling line in the diffuse interstellar medium ( ism ) at gas temperatures @xmath3 ( dalgarno & mccray 1972 ; tielens & hollenbach 1985 ; wolfire et al .",
    "excitation of the @xmath4 level of @xmath5 is due to inelastic collisions either with neutral hydrogen atoms and molecules or with electrons ( dalgarno & mccray 1972 ; stacey 1985 ; kulkarni & heiles 1987 ) .",
    "neutrals dominate over electrons if the fractional ionization @xmath6 is smaller than @xmath7 ( dalgarno & mccray 1972 ) .",
    "heating of the interstellar gas is mainly due to photo  electrons emitted by 3-d dust grains and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ) submitted to ultraviolet radiation from stars ( bakes & tielens 1994 ) , both in the diffuse ism ( wolfire et al .",
    "1995 ) and in photodissociation regions ( pdrs ) , at the interfaces between molecular clouds and hii regions ( tielens & hollenbach 1985 ; bakes & tielens 1998 ) .",
    "the photoelectric effect is due essentially to photons with @xmath8 . in the field of a galaxy ,",
    "this radiation is dominated by b3 to b0 stars with @xmath9 ( e.g. xu et al . 1994 ) but of course hotter , more massive stars can also contribute locally .",
    "earlier studies of the inner regions of gas  rich spirals and starburst galaxies ( crawford et al . 1985 ; stacey et al . 1991 ; carral et al . 1994 ) have found that the [ cii ] line intensity , @xmath10 , is typically a few @xmath11 of the total far - ir continuum dust emission , @xmath12 , within the same region .",
    "for these galaxies , the previous authors have also found a linear relation between @xmath10 and the @xmath13 ( @xmath14 mm ) line intensity , @xmath15 , with a scatter slightly larger than one order of magnitude .",
    "conversely , the correlation with atomic hydrogen is poor .",
    "this led them to the conclusion that pdrs are the main sources of the [ cii ] emission on a galaxy scale ( see also wolfire et al .",
    ".    however space  resolved [ cii ] observations of the large spiral galaxy ngc6946 by madden et al .",
    "( 1993 ) showed that this emission originates also in the diffuse ism ( mostly associated to the interarm regions ) .",
    "more precisely , 5% of the total line luminosity in this galaxy comes from its nucleus , 20% from the spiral arms with their hii regions and pdrs , and 75% from an extended component , the fractional contribution of which increases with radius .",

    "the filled circles represent the 11/28 galaxies in common with the present study .",
    "we see that the representative points scatter nicely between a line of slope 1 expected for galaxies with a co distribution much more extended than both beams , and a line of slope ( 45/100)@xmath32 expected for distributions much smaller than both beams . in particular , it is inferred that the co distribution of ngc4654 is extended , while the ones of ngc4178 , ngc4394 and ngc4450 are point  like .",

    "ngc4698 only upper limits are available , so that we estimate a mean upper limit to its average co brightness in the lws beam .    for the remaining 7 iso galaxies with available co measurements , but taken only at one radiotelescope , we assume that the ratio of the co to the optical size is the same as the average one determined from the 27/28 galaxies observed by both stark et al .",
    "( 1986 ) and kenney & young ( 1988 ) with available measurements / upper limits , and calculate the average co brightness in the lws beam .",
    "this method introduces some uncertainty since the average ratio of the co to the optical size ( 0.32 ) has a rms dispersion of 0.30 for the 27 galaxies .",
    "we find that this ratio does not depend on the morphological type of the galaxy .",
    "the previous 7 iso galaxies represent 40% of the iso galaxies with estimated average co brightness in the lws beam and 20% of the total sample galaxies in fig .",

    "set is more heterogeneous .",
    "s91 report average hi column densities from maps obtained at very different angular resolutions with respect to the kao beam .",
    "however , 17/18 galaxies of the latter sample have observed hi fluxes listed in the rc3 .",
    "although the spatial information is not available , the latter measurements constitute at least a homogeneous data  set and are preferred to those ones adopted by s91 .",
    "17/24 galaxies of the iso sample have observed hi fluxes listed in the rc3 as well .",
    "in addition , 14 galaxies of the iso sample have hi surface density profiles determined by warmels ( 1988 ) after correction for the inclination of the galaxy .",
    "for these 14 iso galaxies , we use these data to calculate the average hi column density @xmath30(hi ) in the 70  lws beam by correcting backwards the warmel s data into apparent surface densities , not deprojected .    for the 2 iso galaxies ( ngc4293 and ngc4522 ) and the 17 kao galaxies with only a hi flux , we derive a `` hybrid '' average surface brighness in the lws or kao beam by assuming that the distribution of hi is gaussian with a fwhm equal to the blue light dimension as given in the rc3 . again , our assumption is reasonable but introduces some uncertainty .",
    "such `` hybrid '' surface brightnesses are admittedly crude but there is no alternative .    for the 14 iso galaxies with data from warmels , the average ratio between the average column densities in the iso - lws beam derived from the hi surface brightness profiles and those estimated through the `` hybrid '' surface brightness method is 1.5 , with a rms dispersion of 0.9 .",
    "the difference in these average surface brightnesses is not large enough to justify a further correction .",
    "although the dispersion is large , we are confident that the conclusions derived in the following sections are not biased by the use of these crude hi surface brightnesses .    note that in all the previous discussion we have eliminated the interacting galaxy ngc4438 , which is a special case .",
    "due to our observational limitations in terms of angular resolution , we find useful to quantify the fraction of a galaxy observed either with the kao or with the iso - lws in terms of a coverage factor cf .",
    "this coverage factor is the ratio between the area of the observing beam and the projected optical galaxy area as defined in the rc3 .",
    "2 shows a plot of the observed central [ cii ] line intensity vs. the cf of the 42 galaxies of our sample .",
    "it confirms that the kao probed mainly the innermost regions of both gas  rich and starburst galaxies .",
    "this is in part because the galaxies of this sample are relatively nearby .",
    "the iso galaxies are further away and as a consequence the lws sampled larger areas of the galaxies .",
    "we note that the 5 iso galaxies with [ cii ] line upper limits fall well within the range of values of cf of the galaxies detected with the lws , so that we are led to the conclusion that their faintness is not due to a particularly reduced spatial sampling but to a genuine deficiency of [ cii ] line emission .",
    "the hubble type of these 5 undetected galaxies is either s0/a or sa ; galaxies of these types have generally a lower sfr than galaxies of later type , so the faintness of their emission is not unexpected .    in fig .",
    "3 , we plot as a function of the cf the average column densities of molecular hydrogen in the beam , @xmath33 , ( in terms of hi nuclei ) and those of the neutral atomic hydrogen , also in the beam , @xmath30(hi ) , both not deprojected from the inclination of the galaxy ( panels a and b , respectively ) .",
    "@xmath33 is derived from @xmath15 as follows ( digel et al .",
    "1995 ) : @xmath34 @xmath15 , where @xmath33 is in units of @xmath35 and @xmath15 is in units of @xmath31 .",
    "this value of the @xmath36 column density - to - co line intensity ratio has been derived in orion and we use it for all our galaxies , although it may depend on metallicity and on the isrf intensity ( cf .",
    "israel 1997 and references therein ) .",
    "its uncertainty is equivalent to 13% of @xmath33 .",
    "we arbitrarily assume that both @xmath30(hi ) and @xmath33 are affected by a @xmath37 uncertainty of 20% .    for both starburst and non  starburst galaxies ,",
    "the inner regions are richer in molecular hydrogen than the outer regions ( cf . young & knezek 1989 ) .",
    "this is not the case for atomic hydrogen .",
    "we note that the iso early  type spiral galaxies have the lowest values of @xmath30(hi ) ( cf . tab . 1 and 2 )",
    ", in agreement with solanes et al .",
    "( 2000 ) .",
    "the innermost regions of the kao galaxies are rich in molecular gas , as witnessed by their high molecular - to - atomic hydrogen column density ratio ( @xmath33/@xmath30(hi ) @xmath19 4 ) , or more exactly by their high co / hi line intensity ratio .",
    "therefore , we might reasonably expect that , in these regions , a relevant part of the gas cooling via [ cii ] line emission comes from pdrs associated to molecular clouds where star ",
    "formation activity may be more or less active .",
    "in particular , this may account partly for the linear relationship between @xmath10 and @xmath15 found by s91 for their starburst galaxies .    in fig .",
    "4 we show this relationship for the 36 galaxies of our total sample that are detected at the @xmath25 level in at least one of the two lines , except for ngc4596 .",
    "the long and short  dashed lines represent the two characteristic values of @xmath10/@xmath15 given by s91 for their `` warm dust galaxies '' ( i.e. starburst galaxies ) and `` cold dust galaxies '' ( i.e. normally active gas  rich galaxies ) , respectively .",
    "the iso observations extend this relation to line fluxes fainter by 1.5 orders of magnitude .",
    "the overall linear relation remains , although with a probably more significant rather large scatter , even though part of it is due to the uncertainties of our data analysis ( cf .",
    "the interpretation given by p99 for this scatter is that @xmath10/@xmath15 is proportional to the strength of the far - uv radiation field , as represented by the @xmath38 equivalent width .",

    "ngc4222 has a particularly high inclination but small h@xmath17 ew ( cf . tab .",

    "ngc4178 is an hii galaxy , with some giant hii regions in its inner part ( boselli et al . in preparation ) , probed by lws .",
    "its `` anomalous '' behaviour was not noted by p99 due to the different value of @xmath15 adopted by these authors but is not due to the assumption that its co morphology is point  like ( sect .",
    "in fact , @xmath10/@xmath15 decreases by only a factor of -0.18 in logarithm under the assumption that the co surface brightness distribution of ngc4178 is partially resolved at 43  resolution . ngc4178 and ngc4299 have bluer b - v colour indices ( gavazzi , private communication ) than the other iso galaxies of the same hubble type considered here .",
    "in addition , they have also exceptionally low values of @xmath33/@xmath30(hi ) .",

    "the correlations presented above have not yet shed light about the [ cii ] line emission by the diffuse ism . before entering this discussion",
    ", it is interesting to summarize what we know about our own galaxy .",
    "the diffuse ism in our own galaxy is thought to consist ( kulkarni & heiles 1987 ; heiles 1988 , 1994 ; reynolds 1993 ; heiles et al .",
    "1996 ) of : i ) a cold neutral medium ( cnm ) , with a temperature t of about 80  k , a hydrogen density @xmath39 of about @xmath40 and a fractional ionization @xmath41 within a factor of 3 of @xmath42 ; ii ) a warm neutral medium ( wnm ) , with @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 ; iii ) a warm ionized medium ( wim ) , with @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath46 .",
    "the distinction between the wnm and wim is not completely clear , and it may be that they are partly one and the same thing .    in our galaxy , the high latitude [ cii ] line emission is associated to the cnm ( bennett et al .",
    "1995 ) while , in the inner regions of the disk , the wim has been proposed as the main source of the [ cii ] line emission ( heiles 1994 ) . at high galactic latitudes ,",
    "no prominent ob associations are found , while the opposite is true for the inner regions ( bronfman et al .",
    "2000 ) , favoring the wnm and wim . for the local galaxy near the sun , bennett et al .",

    "forming galaxy .",
    "it is interesting to compare these observations to the results of the model calculations of wolfire et al .",
    "( 1995 ) which relate to the local galactic ism : they predict a cooling rate per hydrogen nucleus ( dominated by the [ cii ] line ) from 2.6 to @xmath49 in the cnm and from 0.3 to @xmath50 in the wnm , depending on the exact values of the physical parameters of the medium .",
    "moreover , they estimate a value of about @xmath51 in the wim , where @xmath52 is the wim pressure in units of @xmath53 . their lower value for the cnm compares favorably with the observation of bennett et al .",
    "an increase of the uv flux would raise the cooling rate from the cnm appreciably , but this flux should be higher by considerably more than one order of magnitude to reach the cooling rate of the interarm medium of ngc6946 ( see fig . 3 of kaufman et al .",

    "any contribution of the dense pdrs would raise @xmath55 . fig .",
    "5 shows that when the beam covers most of the galaxy ( cf@xmath560.1 ) @xmath55 is indeed in this range , while it increases strongly when only the central regions are sampled .",
    "this demonstrates the importance of [ cii ] line emission by the diffuse ism in non  starburst galaxies when one considers the whole galaxy .",
    "moreover the above discussion shows that the cnm dominates the emission in normal circumstances .",
    "we note that the normal star  forming galaxy ngc4178 has a relatively low value of @xmath55 .",

    "6 the same plot as in fig . 5 but considering this time the line emission per total hydrogen atom whether included or not in molecules ( @xmath57 @xmath10/(@xmath30(hi)+@xmath58 ) . since the contribution of h@xmath59 to the total gas is minor at the scale of a whole galaxy , both plots are very similar at large values of cf .",
    "this is not the case in the inner regions which correspond to small values of cf , but the [ cii ] emission per total h is not very much higher there than for entire galaxies .",
    "this conclusion is however uncertain because the conversion factor between the co(1 - 0 ) line intensity and the column density of @xmath36 is very poorly known in the center of galaxies . as expected , galaxies with more active sf have on average a higher value of the cooling rate per hydrogen nucleus .",
    "this confirms that the total [ cii ] line emission per hydrogen nucleus increases with the strength of the local far - uv field .    from our own data",
    "alone it is not directly possible to infer the fraction of the [ cii ] line luminosity which comes from the diffuse ism and from the pdrs respectively , because these data are spatially averaged at our limited angular resolution .",
    "however we note that the lowest values of @xmath55 on fig .",
    "5 are similar to the local value determined by bennett et al .",
    "( 1995 ) for the solar neighborhood .",
    "because the [ cii ] line intensity is relatively insensitive to the far - uv flux density , this local value should be typical for relatively quiescent galaxies .",
    "consequently there is little room left for the contribution of pdrs to the [ cii ] line luminosity for the galaxies with the lowest values of @xmath55 in fig .",
    "5 . on the other hand , the high value quoted for the interarm ism of ngc6946 by madden et al .",
    "( 1993 ) would require a very high far - uv radiation density , perhaps unrealistic , if it is assumed to be due to a cold neutral medium alone , ( wolfire et al .",
    "1995 ) , and therefore it is likely that there is already a contribution of dense pdrs at such high values of @xmath55 .",
    "the statistical results of p99 are consistent with this estimate .",
    "since they used different local galactic data and a different parametrization , our result is also complementary with p99 .    in the _ inner _ regions of the sample galaxies , dense pdrs always seem to dominate as shown by the high values of @xmath55 in fig .",
    "5 , even though the wim could give a non - negligible contribution ( heiles 1994 ) .",
    "we have made or collected observations of the central regions of a relatively large sample of spiral galaxies in the [ cii](@xmath1 ) ( @xmath60 m ) gas cooling line .",
    "this sample , mainly observed with the long wavelength spectrometer aboard iso , enlarges a previous sample observed with the kuiper airborne observatory and contains on average more quiescent , fainter galaxies .",
    "for the total kao @xmath61 iso - lws sample of 42 galaxies , we have collected measurements of the atomic and molecular gas , and estimated their average column densities in the same beam as the [ cii ] line observations . this beam covers various fractions of the galaxy disks according to their distance and linear size .",
    "our results are more detailed than but complementary to those of pierini et al .",
    "we confirm the existence of an overall linear relation between the [ cii ] line intensity , @xmath10 , and the co(1 - 0 ) line intensity , @xmath15 , over almost 2.5 orders of magnitude in both quantities .",
    "the significant large scatter around this relation is due to the variation of the far - uv radiation field and is in agreement with model calculations by kaufman et al .",
    "( 1999 ) .",
    "we find that the [ cii ] line emissivity per interstellar atomic hydrogen nucleus , @xmath55 , ranges between @xmath62 and @xmath63 in galaxies where the observing beam cover at least 10% of the optical surface of the galaxy .",
    "the lowest observed values of @xmath55 are similar to the value obtained by bennett et al .",
    "( 1995 ) for the diffuse ism near the sun , where the atomic cold neutral medium ( cnm ) dominates the emission .",
    "for the corresponding galaxies , it is likely that most of the [ cii ] line emission also comes from the cnm .",
    "the dense photodissociation regions plus the warm ionized medium dominate in more active star  forming galaxies , even including their extended regions , and they do so in the inner parts of all spiral galaxies .    finally , we find that the cooling rate per hydrogen nucleus , when both the molecular and the atomic phases are taken into account , increases moderately with the star  formation rate , although it is difficult to give a quantitative result because of the uncertainty in the amount of @xmath36 in regions of intense star  formation . 1.0truecm    we are grateful for the support of this work to the _ deutsche agentur fr raumfahrt angelegenheiten _",
