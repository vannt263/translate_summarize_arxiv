    "canizares ( 1981 ) showed that if gravitational lensing effects are considered , an enhancement in the density of qsos close to the position of foreground galaxies is expected ( see also keel 1982 ; peacock 1982 ) .",
    "this effect , known as ` magnification bias ' can be characterized by the overdensity @xmath6 ( narayan 1989 ) , where @xmath7 is the magnification and @xmath8 is the logarithmic slope of the number counts distribution . depending on the slope @xmath8 , an excess ( @xmath9 ) or even a defect ( @xmath10 ) of background sources around the lenses will be observed .",
    "galaxies and clusters trace the matter fluctuations ( up to a bias factor @xmath11 ) , and therefore , we may observe positive ( @xmath12 ) , null ( @xmath13 ) or negative ( @xmath14 ) statistical associations of these foreground objects with distant , background sources .",
    "the evidence for association between high  redshift agns and foreground galaxies has steadily accumulated during the years ( see schneider , ehlers & falco 1992 for a detailed review ) . however , the results are sometimes apparently contradictory and quite often difficult to accommodate within the gravitational lensing framework .",
    "for instance , the strength of associations depends on the agn type and in particular , the studies performed with radio - loud agn samples , or with heterogeneous samples , usually extracted from early versions of the veron - cetty & veron or the hewitt & burbidge catalogs , ( which contain a high proportion of radio  loud qsos ) almost routinely find significant excesses of foreground objects around the quasar positions ( tyson 1986 ; fugmann 1988,1990 ; hammer & le fvre 1990 ; hintzen et al .",
    "1991 ; drinkwater et al .",
    "1992 ; thomas et al . 1995 ; bartelmann & schneider 1993b , 1994 ; bartsch , schneider , & bartelmann 1997 ; seitz & schneider ; bentez et al . 1995 ; bentez & martnez - gonzlez 1995 , 1997(bmg97 ) ; bentez , martnez - gonzlez & martn - mirones 1997 ; norman & williams 1999 ; norman & impey 1999 ) . although these results are qualitatively in agreement with the magnification bias effect , in most cases the amplitude of the correlation is much higher than that expected from gravitational lensing models .",
    "on the other hand , the studies carried out with optically selected catalogs are less consistent .",
    "positive correlations have been found by webster et al .",
    "( 1988 ) , rodrigues - williams and hogan(1991 ) and williams & irwin ( 1998 ) .",
    "in all these cases , the amplitude of the correlations is more than an order of magnitude stronger than the predictions from the magnification bias effect . on the other hand , boyle et al .",
    "( 1988 ) ; romani & maoz ( 1992 ) ; bmg97 ; ferreras , bentez & martnez - gonzlez ( 1997 ) and croom & shanks ( 1999 ) found null or even negative correlations , which in some cases are expected from the magnification bias effect due to the shallowness of the qso number counts .",
    "however , there are certain instances in which the differences in the qso  galaxy correlation @xmath15 between radio  loud and radio  quiet qsos can not be explained by the lensing hypothesis : bmg97 found a negative correlation for the optically selected large bright quasar survey ( lbqs ) catalog ( hewett , foltz & chafee 1995 ) , which has a steep slope @xmath16 .",
    "the most likely explanation for this is that the lbqs catalog is affected by a selection bias which hinders the detection of high - z qsos in regions of high projected galaxy density ( see romani & maoz 1992 , maoz 1995 )",
    ". further evidence was obtained by ferreras , bentez & martnez - gonzlez ( 1997 ) which found that cfht / mmt qsos ( crampton , cowley & hartwick 1989 ) were strongly anticorrelated with low redshift galaxies , contrary to what was expected from the magnification bias effect .",
    "the amplitude of the anticorrelation is stronger for lower redshift qsos which practically excludes dust in foreground galaxies as its cause and strongly suggests a dependence on the strength of the emission lines used to identify the qso . from these results",
    "it may be concluded that until the selection effects operating on optically selected qso samples are not better understood , one should be wary of the gravitational lensing inferences obtained from them .    as bartelmann & schneider ( 1993a ) pointed out , the scale of some of the positive correlations reported above ( several arcmin ) is difficult to explain considering lensing by isolated galaxies or microlensing , and apparently has to be caused by the large - scale structure .",
    "bartelmann ( 1995 ) showed that in the weak lensing regime @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the correlation between magnification and matter density contrast @xmath19 , @xmath11 is the biasing factor @xmath20 , where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are respectively the galaxy and dark matter overdensities .",
    "sanz et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and dolag & bartelmann ( 1997 ) have calculated @xmath18 for several cosmological models taking into account the non linear evolution of the power spectrum of density perturbations . in bentez & sanz ( 1999 )",
    "it was shown that the expected value of @xmath0 can also be estimated as @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the typical redshifts of respectively the galaxy and quasar samples .",
    "for low redshift galaxies and relatively high - z qsos like the ones considered in this paper , the factor @xmath26 is approximately independent of the cosmological model .",
    "any radio  loud quasar is detected in the optical , with e.g. magnitude @xmath27 , and in radio with flux @xmath28 . for a sample with independent optical and radio fluxes , the effective slope @xmath29 ( borgeest et al .",
    "1991 ) takes the form @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the cumulative number counts distributions .",
    "this is known as the double magnification bias effect .",
    "it holds if the optical and radio fluxes are independent , and also if the source sizes are considerable smaller than the lens in both bands , what ensures that both fluxes are equally magnified .",
    "both conditions are reasonably fulfilled for qso  galaxy associations : radio and optical fluxes are practically uncorrelated for radio quasars ( see e.g. fig .",
    "10 of drinkwater et al . 1997 ) and the large scale structure weak lensing field is smooth enough to magnify similarly the sizes of the optical and radio emitting regions .    therefore , to compare the model predictions with the observations , it is necessary to know in detail the unperturbed number counts distribution of the quasar sample .",
    "however , practically all the radio  loud samples mentioned above are incomplete ( e.g. bmg97 ) or have heterogeneous photometrical information in the optical ( e.g. bentez & martnez - gonzlez 1995 ) . here",
    "we intend to remedy this situation by measuring @xmath0 using two _ complete _ radioloud quasar samples .",
    "the outline of the paper is the following . in ",
    "2 we describe the galaxy and qso samples used to estimate @xmath5 .  3 deals with the statistical analysis .",
    " 4 presents two theoretical estimations of @xmath15 and compares them with the observational results .",
    " 5 discusses the puzzling results of the previous section and  6 summarizes our main results and conclusions .",
    "our galaxy sample is obtained from the roe / nrl cosmos / ukst southern sky catalog ( see yentis et al .",
    "1992 and references therein ) , which contains the objects detected in the cosmos scans of the glass copies of the eso / serc blue survey plates .",
    "the ukst survey is organized in @xmath33 fields on a @xmath34 grid and covers the zone with declination @xmath35 and galactic latitude @xmath36 .",
    "the catalog supplies several parameters for each detected object , including the centroid in both sky and plate coordinates , @xmath37 magnitude and the star - galaxy image classification down to a limiting magnitude of @xmath38 .",
    "drinkwater et al .",
    "( 1997 ) quote a calibration accuracy of about @xmath39mag for the cosmos @xmath37 magnitudes . as in bmg97",
    ", we include in our sample galaxies brighter than @xmath40 and within @xmath41 of the quasars selected as we describe below .",
    "the median redshift of the @xmath37 galaxies is @xmath42 .",
    "in bmg97 we studied the quasar - galaxy correlation for a sample of 144 @xmath43 pks quasars with a 2.7ghz flux @xmath44jy , extracted from veron - cetty & veron ( 1996 ) .",
    "this sample was shown to be strongly correlated with foreground galaxies , but its incompleteness precluded a detailed comparison with theory .",
    "thus , we now consider two well defined and practically complete radio loud quasar catalogs to assess the incompleteness of the bmg97 sample and its effect on the estimation of @xmath5 : the 1jy catalog ( stickel , meisenheimer & khr 1994 ; stickel et al . 1996 ) which includes radiosources with a 5ghz flux @xmath45jy , and the parkes half - jansky flat - spectrum sample ( drinkwater et al . 1997 ) which contains flat - spectrum sources detected at 2.7ghz and 5ghz , with s@xmath46jy , spectral index between 2.7ghz and 5ghz @xmath47 , galactic latitude @xmath48 and declination @xmath49 .",
    "both the 1jy and half - jansky catalogs are almost @xmath50 identified and have spectroscopical redshifts for @xmath51 of the sources . to try to work with samples as similar as possible ,",
    "we have extracted from the three catalogs those objects classified as qsos .",
    "vc classify as qsos those objects with absolute magnitudes brighter than @xmath52 and the 1jy catalog uses the same classifications as the original discovery papers . for the hj we have selected those objects classified as `` stellar '' , excluding the bl lacs to get a more homogeneous sample .",
    "drinkwater & schmidt 1996 showed that the original parkes catalog classification was made in a non - uniform way , resulting in false large - scale correlations among quasars drawn from that catalog .",
    "the hj classification seems to be free of this problem ( drinkwater et al .",
    "1997 ) and even if the 1jy presents a similar defect , it would not affect the measurement of @xmath15 , since we normalize the galaxy density locally in a 15 circle around each quasar .",
    "it should also be kept in mind that the optical classification of radiosources may be affected by crowding effects ( an example are the merged objects in drinkwater et al .",
    "1997 ) , and that this could tend to eliminate from the sample qsos in fields with higher than average galaxy density , biasing low the measured value of @xmath15 .    our analysis will be performed within basically the same area defined by drinkwater et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , except for three additional constraints imposed by the characteristics of the cosmos / ukst galaxy catalog :    \\i ) declinations @xmath53 , as the cosmos / ukst plates only reach up to @xmath54 .",
    "\\ii ) galactic latitude @xmath55 .",
    "it was shown in bmg97 that the `` galaxy '' density in cosmos fields is significantly anticorrelated with galaxy latitude , clearly due to an increase in the numbers of stars misclassified as `` galaxies '' when we approach the galactic disk .",
    "in fact , cosmos fields with @xmath56 have on average @xmath57 more objects classified as `` galaxies '' than the @xmath55 fields .",
    "although excluding these fields does not affect strongly the results ( bmg97 ) , they would dilute the galaxy excess and bias low the amplitude of @xmath5 .",
    "\\iii ) @xmath58,@xmath59 , @xmath60 . as in bmg97",
    ", these cutoffs avoid the outer regions of the plates , with worse image and photometric qualities .",
    "we also exclude a few fields from the sample because they are affected by meteorite traces .",
    "there are also other three general constraints based on the quasar characteristics :    \\iv ) a faint threshold on the quasar @xmath37 magnitude , @xmath40 , the same as for our galaxies .",
    "we also set an upper threshold of @xmath61 , brighter of which the photographic magnitudes are not reliable .",
    "we use only cosmos @xmath37 magnitudes obtained from drinkwater et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , or directly from the roe / nrl cosmos / ukst southern sky catalogue .",
    "this ensures photometrical bandpass homogeneity . at the chosen magnitude limit",
    ", it can be reasonably expected that any radio source candidate is bright enough to be detected , correctly identified on a photographic plate and have its redshift determined spectroscopically .",
    "up to this limit , the quasar catalogs should be practically complete .",
    "v)a lower redshift cutoff , @xmath43 .",
    "only @xmath62 of the cosmos / ukst galaxies with @xmath40",
    "have @xmath43 , so we exclude the possibility of `` intrinsic '' quasar - galaxy correlations contaminating the result . setting a higher redshift cutoff does not affect significantly the results .",
    "vi)a 2.7ghz flux cutoff : @xmath63 jy .",
    "this is the flux limit of the half - jansky catalog .",
    "the @xmath64 fluxes are obtained from drinkwater et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and from the veron - cetty & veron compilation .",
    "objects from the 1jy catalog also have @xmath45 jy .",
    "we do not set any constrains on the steepness of the radio spectra for the veron - cetty & veron and 1jy samples .",
    "the half - jansky sample has @xmath47 .",
    "the veron - cetty & veron ( vc ) sample is very similar to the pks sample used in bmg97 except for the exclusion of 23 quasars with @xmath56 and @xmath40 , and the inclusion of 12 objects which belong to the veron - cetty & veron ( 1997 ) catalog and comply with criteria i - vi ) but were not included in bmg97 because their names do not start with `` pks '' , or have @xmath64 exactly equal to 0.5jy ( the flux limit in bmg97 was @xmath65 and here it is @xmath66 ) .",
    "the vc sample thus defined contains _ all _ the quasars in the 1jy sample and @xmath67 of the half - jansky ( hj ) sample ( 86 out of 94 ) .",
    "there are 35 vc quasars which do not belong to the hj or 1jy sample .",
    "they are steep - spectrum quasars fainter than the 1jy catalog @xmath68 jy limit , and are slightly brighter in the optical ( @xmath69 ) than the hj sample . on the other hand , there are 8 hj quasars which are not included in the vc sample .",
    "they are considerable fainter than the rest of the hj sample , with @xmath70 and @xmath71 .    the redshift distributions of the hj , vc and 1jy samples are shown in fig 1 .",
    "the distributions look rather similar , although the hj quasars apparently tend to have slightly higher redshifts than the 1jy ones .",
    "however , a kolmogorov - smirnov test shows that the difference between both distributions has only a @xmath72 significance level .",
    "as drinkwater et al .",
    "( 1997 ) showed , the redshift distribution of the hj catalog is very similar to that of optically selected samples , as the lbqs ( hewett , foltz & chafee 1995 ) .",
    "fig 2 displays the @xmath37 histograms of the hj , vc and 1jy samples . although vc and 1jy quasars are slightly brighter than hj ones , the difference is again not statistically significant .",
    "the cumulative number distributions @xmath73 of the @xmath43 quasars in the hj and 1jy samples are shown in fig .",
    "3 . they are much shallower than the corresponding distribution for optically - selected qsos ( hawkins & veron 1995 ) .",
    "this fact was also noticed in bmg97 but since we were using a subsample of an incomplete catalog , it was not possible to distinguish between the effect of incompleteness and the intrinsic differences in the luminosity functions .",
    "the number counts @xmath74 for the quasars are well fitted by a law of the form    @xmath75    @xmath76 where @xmath77 and @xmath78 is an arbitrary normalization .",
    "for the 1jy sample @xmath79 , whereas for the hj sample , @xmath80 .",
    "the above fits are plotted in fig .",
    "3 .    the cumulative flux distribution of the @xmath43 quasars in the hj and 1jy catalogs are shown in figure 4 . for the hj sample @xmath81 and for the 1jy sample @xmath82 where @xmath83 is an arbitrary normalization .    therefore ,",
    "at the flux limits of the hj sample , @xmath84 and @xmath85jy , we have that @xmath86 .",
    "for the 1jy sample , @xmath87 .",
    "the real value of @xmath88 is therefore @xmath89 times smaller than the values so far considered in the estimation of @xmath5 and @xmath90 for the pks sample ( bmg97 , dolag & bartelmann 1997 ) , @xmath91 .",
    ".results of the weighted average test [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     @xmath92 is the number of qsos in each sample , @xmath93 the number of galaxies for which the @xmath15 is measured , @xmath94 is the value of the normalized correlation coefficient ( see text ) and @xmath95 the corresponding significance associated to the value of @xmath96 .    [ stats ]    spearman s rank order test has often been used to study the statistical significance of qso - galaxy associations . for instance , in the implementation of bartelmann & schneider ( 1993a , 1994 ) , all the individual galaxy fields around the quasars are merged into a single ` superfield ' , which is subsequently divided into @xmath97 annular intervals of equal surface .",
    "the rank order test determines whether the number of galaxies in each bin @xmath98 is anticorrelated with the bin radius @xmath99 .",
    "here we have applied a variant of this test described in detail in bmg97 .",
    "the field is divided into rings of fixed width @xmath100 and distance @xmath101 from the qso , and the variables to be correlated are @xmath102 , the value of the empirical angular correlation in the @xmath103bin , and @xmath101 .",
    "the results of several binnings are averaged to reduce the dependence of the significance on the particular choice of @xmath104 .",
    "extensive montecarlo simulations show the robustness of this approach .",
    "the main advantage of this test is that it does not rely on any particular shape of the correlation function @xmath0 .",
    "it just tells us whether the distribution of galaxies is correlated with the positions of the qsos . from it",
    "we find that the 1jy sample shows a positive correlation with galaxies at a @xmath105 confidence level .",
    "note that the 1jy north , @xmath106 sample which is also practically complete and does not overlap with the sample considered here , was found to be correlated with foreground apm galaxies at a @xmath107 level ( @xmath108 for the red galaxy sample bentez & martnez - gonzlez 1995 ; see also norman & williams 1999 ) . a naive but conservative combination of both results yields @xmath109 for the existence of positive correlations between the whole 1jy catalog and foreground galaxies .",
    "the existence of correlation for the hj sample is detected at a smaller significance level , @xmath110 .    to compare among the different samples we found more convenient the weighted average test of bartsch et al .",
    "this test is based on the estimator @xmath111 , @xmath112 where @xmath113 is the total number of galaxies and @xmath114 are the quasar - galaxy distances .",
    "bartsch et al .",
    "( 1997 ) showed that @xmath111 is optimized to distinguish between a random distribution of galaxies around the quasars and a distribution which follows an assumed @xmath5 .",
    "we will slightly modify the procedure of bartsch et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and use a normalized value of @xmath111 , which we define as @xmath115 where @xmath116 values of @xmath117 will indicate a positive correlation , @xmath118 negative , and @xmath119 absence of correlation . if the galaxies are exactly distributed following @xmath5 , then @xmath111 happens to be the monte - carlo integral of @xmath120 , i.e. , @xmath121 .",
    "unlike bartsch et al .",
    "( 1997 ) we do not merge all the fields into one single superfield , but calculate @xmath122 for each quasar and then found an average @xmath123 over all the sample .",
    "this avoids giving more weight to a field just because its galaxy density is higher , which could be due to star contamination .",
    "we set @xmath124 as predicted by bentez & sanz ( 1999 ) , and proportional to the galaxy angular correlation of the apm galaxies ( maddox et al .",
    "this test is very robust in the sense that it is only sensitive to changes in the shape of @xmath125 ; if we multiply this function by an arbitrary amplitude , the significance will not change .",
    "the values of @xmath122 together with their significance level @xmath126 , are listed in table 1 .",
    "the significance is established with 10000 sets of simulated fields each with the same number of randomly distributed galaxies as the real fields .      from table 1",
    "we see that the vc sample , the one more similar to the pks sample used in bmg97 , has the higher significance level , @xmath127 ( the pks itself has @xmath128 using this test ) .",
    "however , the union of the vc , hj and 1jy samples , which includes only 8 more hj quasars has a considerable lower value of @xmath122 and of @xmath126 . if we analyze separately these 8 `` non vc ''",
    "hj quasars we see that they have @xmath129 and @xmath130 , i.e. they are strongly _ anticorrelated _ with foreground galaxies at the @xmath131 level .",
    "however , if we look at the other seven hj faint objects which have similar optical and radio fluxes ( @xmath70 , @xmath71 ) but were included in the vc catalog , they have @xmath132 and @xmath133 , that is , an excess much stronger than that detected for the full hj sample . if we put together these 15 faint quasars , we get @xmath134 , that is , practically no correlation whatsoever , positive or negative . since magnitudes ,",
    "radio - fluxes , absolute luminosities , redshifts and galactic latitudes are very similar for both faint `` minisamples '' , the only remaining difference seems to be their inclusion in the 96 version of the veron - cetty & veron catalog , something which only depends on the date when the quasars were identified . that happened in 1983 for the 7 vc quasars , whereas the `` non - vc '' redshifts were first published in drinkwater et al .",
    "if we compare the values of @xmath122 of the 8 `` non - vc '' objects with the rest of quasars ( 86 ) from the hj sample , a kolmogorov - smirnov test shows that their @xmath122 distributions are incompatible at the @xmath135 level .",
    "this is rather puzzling , and barring a statistical fluke , the only remaining possibility seems to be something which might be called `` identification bias '' : apparently the first radio sources to be spectroscopically identified in a catalog tend to be those in regions of higher galaxy density .",
    "it is possible that due to the positional uncertainty of the radio identifications , there was a tendency to start the identification of a radio catalog with those fields which have more `` candidates '' close to the radio position .",
    "although in our case the samples are small , the differences among them are so significant that one must conclude that any results about quasar - galaxy associations obtained with incomplete catalogs should be considered with great caution .",
    "the results of bmg97 are a good example : if we look at the 86 quasars in the hj sample considered in that paper ( where the 8 `` non - vc '' objects were not included ) one obtains @xmath136 and @xmath137 .",
    "the total hj sample gives @xmath138 and @xmath139 , as we see from table 1 .",
    "although the galaxy excess does not disappear when we use the complete sample , the values of @xmath122 and @xmath126 drop appreciably . if this happens with a sample which was almost @xmath140 complete , results as those of tyson ( 1986 ) , hintzen et al .",

    "( 1990 ) , which use qso samples extracted from incomplete compilations as those of hewitt & burbidge ( 1980 ) and the veron - cetty & veron ( 1984 ) catalogs , may be seriously biased , explaining the extremely strong amplitudes of @xmath5 found by these authors .",
    "therefore , it seems clear that valid samples for quasar - galaxy correlation measurements should be complete or randomly extracted ( e.g. , depending on the celestial coordinates ) from complete catalogs , as the 1jy and hj .",
    "note that the 1jy has the highest value of @xmath122 for the samples in table 1 , i.e. it is the most strongly correlated , in qualitative agreement with the magnification bias effect , although @xmath126 is not very high due to the smaller size of the sample , which increases the statistical uncertainty .",
    "to compare with theory , we shall assume that the biasing factor @xmath20 is approximately constant within the relevant angular range .",
    "two estimates of @xmath0 will be considered , that of sanz , martinez - gonzalez & bentez ( 1997 ) , which takes into account the nonlinear evolution of the power spectrum using the ansatz of peacock & dodds ( 1996 ) , and the more recent estimation of bentez & sanz ( 1999 ) .      in sanz , martnez - gonzlez & bentez ( 1997 ) we showed that the the value of @xmath18 in eq .",

    "a maximum likelihood fit to the data using a function of the form @xmath186 , taking a fixed @xmath187 and leaving @xmath169 as a free parameter , yields @xmath188 and @xmath189 , again much higher than expected . given the redshifts of the background and foreground populations , including",
    "a cosmological constant @xmath190 would not change significantly the results .",
    "although the observed results seem to qualitatively agree with the lensing hypothesis ( for instance , the amplitude of @xmath15 divided by @xmath191 is almost constant for both the 1jy and the hj catalogs ) , they can not be quantitatively reconciled with it .",
    "for instance , from the results of the above paragraph and the estimate of bentez & sanz ( 1999 ) one would need @xmath192 .",
    "there seems to be plenty of evidence for @xmath193 ( see e.g. bahcall et al .",
    "1999 ) , and therefore the above ratio would imply absurdly low values of the biasing parameter @xmath194 . in spite of some hints of ` antibiasing ' in low @xmath195 lss simulations ( jenkins et al .",
    "1998 ) , most measurements point at values of @xmath196 for the apm galaxies ( e.g. frieman & gaztaaga 1999 ) , although on scales several times larger than the ones considered here ( @xmath197 mpc at @xmath198 ) .",
    "it seems difficult to believe that the weak lensing theory is wrong by an order of magnitude .",
    "for instance , the calculation by williams ( 1999 ) taking into account second - order effects only changes in @xmath199 the first - order results .",
    "are there other possible explanations for these high values of the qso - galaxy correlation ?",
    "one option often considered is absorption by galactic dust ( norman & williams 1999 ) .",
    "it is easy to see that this effect would lead to a positive correlation between galaxies and high - z quasars : let s suppose that @xmath200 represents a ( small ) fluctuation of the galactic extinction in the sky .",
    "the induced fluctuations in the galaxy and quasar number density , @xmath201 and @xmath202 respectively would be @xmath203 and @xmath204 , where @xmath205 and @xmath206 are the slopes of the optical number counts magnitude distributions of quasars and galaxies . therefore , @xmath207 where @xmath208 is the dust - dust correlation function in e.g. schlegel , finkbeiner , & davis ( 1998 ) .",
    "although the quasar - galaxy correlation @xmath209 also increases with the value of the slope @xmath205 , there are significant differences with the correlation generated by the magnification bias effect : @xmath209 is always positive , even for values of @xmath205 smaller than @xmath210 .",
    "this could allow to distinguish between the contribution of each effect to the total correlation .",
    "the best observational results on @xmath211 available so far , those of finkbeiner , schlegel & davis ( 1998 ) do not resolve adequately the angular scales on which @xmath0 is measured in this paper . a tentative extrapolation of the @xmath211 presented in the above mentioned paper is too flat to explain the measured correlations .",
    "future measurements of @xmath212 on small scales will serve to establish the contribution of @xmath213 to the total , observed @xmath214 .",
    "it is also interesting to explore the contribution to @xmath15 on relatively large scales , @xmath215 , from strong lensing effects .",
    "let s suppose that a fraction @xmath216 of the quasars in a sample is strongly lensed ( not necessarily multiply imaged ) by individual foreground galaxies .",
    "these galaxies , which will be very close to the quasar positions , are correlated with other galaxies , following a correlation function @xmath214 . if the typical quasar - lens distance is considerably smaller that the galaxy - galaxy correlation scale , this would indirectly cause a `` strong - lensing '' quasar ",
    "galaxy correlation @xmath217 .",
    "since the `` weak lensing '' correlation estimated above is @xmath218 , relatively small values of @xmath216 could generate a correlation @xmath219 of comparable amplitude .",
    "a quick inspection of the digital sky survey images around the quasars in the hj sample reveals several cases of very close , @xmath220 few arcsec ` associations ' in a sample of @xmath221 quasars .",
    "unfortunately , and due to the poor quality of these images ( some of the ` associated ' objects may be stars or defects ) , it is difficult to give an exact value of @xmath216 for this sample .",
    "however , if an appreciable fraction of these objects are galaxies , this effect would contribute significantly to the total amplitude of @xmath15",
    ". obviously this point merits a more detailed consideration with improved observations .",
    "last but not least , another possibility is that the observed correlation @xmath15 is affected by unforeseen systematic effects , or due to a statistical fluke .",
    "this sounds very unlikely given the variety of quasar and galaxy catalogs considered in @xmath15 studies ( bentez 1997 ) .",
    "but it should not be forgotten that many of the positive results reported in the literature are based on bright , radio  loud quasars , and they are so scarce in the sky that overlaps among the samples are unavoidable .    as in most scientific controversies ,",
    "the solution will eventually come from more and better data : ongoing surveys as the sloan digital sky survey ( gunn & weinberg 1995 ) or the 2df ( folkes et al .",
    "1999 ) will provide huge qso and galaxy catalogs , from which it will be possible to select complete samples well suited to measure @xmath15 .",
    "gravitational lensing predicts an enhancement of the density of background qsos around foreground galaxies .",
    "we measure this qso ",
    "galaxy correlation @xmath0 for two _ complete _ samples of radio - loud quasars , the southern 1jy and half - jansky samples .",
    "the existence of a positive correlation between distant @xmath1 quasars and @xmath2 galaxies is confirmed at a @xmath3 significance level ( @xmath4 if previous measurements on the northern hemisphere are included ) .",
    "a comparison with the results obtained for incomplete quasar catalogs ( e.g. the veron - cetty and veron compilation ) suggests the existence of an ` identification bias ' , which spuriously increases the estimated amplitude of @xmath5 for incomplete samples .",
    "this effect could explain most of the very strong quasar ",
    "galaxy statistical associations found in the literature .",
    "nevertheless , the value of @xmath0 that we measure in our complete catalogs is still considerably higher than the predictions from weak gravitational lensing theory . including the effects of strong lensing",
    "could help to explain this discrepancy .",
