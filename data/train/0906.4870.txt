    "within independent - electron approaches , all single - particle states are delocalized and the metallic or insulating behavior is determined by the existence of an energy gap between the highest occupied level and the lowest unoccupied one . however , whenever the coulomb interaction becomes dominant over the kinetic energy , the independent - electron picture fails and electrons in the narrow bands close to the fermi energy become localized .",
    "systems , whose insulating character is induced by electron correlations , are called _ mott insulators_.",
    "@xcite the presence of disorder weakens the constructive interference that allows a wave - packet to propagate coherently in a periodic potential and may eventually lead to single - particle localization at the fermi energy , hence to a further class of insulating materials , called _ anderson insulators_.",
    "@xcite in this context , the conventional one - parameter scaling theory of conductance  @xcite predicts that all solutions of the single - particle schrdinger equation in a disordered potential are localized in two dimensions ( 2d ) .",
    "therefore , any amount of disorder in 2d drives a non - interacting electron system into an anderson insulator .",
    "the inclusion of electron - electron interaction in weak coupling does not modify qualitatively the above conclusion ,  @xcite although it may crucially affect physical properties like the tunneling density of states .",
    "@xcite hence , it is widely accepted that 2d electron systems should always display an insulating behavior at sufficiently low temperature or large size no matter how weak the disorder is .",
    "nevertheless , from time to time some indications have appeared that this conclusion might not be always correct .",
    "finkelstein  @xcite and castellani _ et al . _",
    "@xcite considered the interplay between disorder and interaction by perturbative renormalization group methods and showed that , for weak disorder and sufficiently strong interactions , a 2d system might scale towards a phase with finite conductivity . however , this result was not conclusive since the `` metallic '' region is found to occur outside the theory s limits of validity .",
    "indeed , the common feature of these calculations is the crucial role played by spin fluctuations that grow large as the renormalization procedure is iterated .",
    "this tendency has been commonly interpreted as the emergence of local moments concomitantly with the progressive anderson localization and , in continuum systems , it might signal an incipient ferromagnetic instability .",
    "@xcite in lattice models , this is likely to be substituted by a magnetic instability at some wave - vector determined by the topology of the fermi surface . in this respect",
    ", an alternative approach could be to assume from the beginning a strong interaction that drives the system into a local moment regime , e.g. , close to a magnetic mott transition , and then turn on disorder .",
    "however , since it is already difficult to obtain an accurate description of a clean mott transition , this approach is very hard to pursue . moreover , assuming the scenario provided by dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft ) ,  @xcite one would immediately face with the so called harris criterion .",
    "@xcite indeed , the correlation - length exponent predicted within dmft for a clean mott transition @xmath1 is smaller than @xmath2 in @xmath3 dimensions .",
    "@xcite this fact implies that the whole critical behavior has to be profoundly altered by disorder , which therefore can not be regarded at all as a weak perturbation .    only with the groundbreaking experimental work by kravchenko and coworkers ,  @xcite the statement that localization always occurs in 2d",
    "was really put into question . in fact",
    ", kravchenko has been the first to observe and claim that , above some critical carrier density , high - mobility silicon mosfets display a metallic behavior , i.e. , a resistivity that decreases with decreasing temperature down to the lowest accessible one . below this critical density",
    ", the behavior of the resistance looks insulating , thus suggesting that a metal - insulator transition does occur by varying the density .",
    "this experimental finding has renewed the interest in the interplay between disorder and interaction and has generated further theoretical works along the same direction originally put forward by finkelstein , in the attempt to clarify some open issues and the applicability of the approach .",
    "@xcite however , the issue of having a genuine metallic phases in 2d is controversial and remains under debate , from both the experimental and the theoretical point of view .",
    "@xcite    an approach where neither the interaction nor the disorder are treated as a perturbation is therefore required to understand the complex physics of correlated disordered systems .",
    "the simplest model which contains both ingredients on the same level is the disordered hubbard model , which has been intensively studied by several numerical methods , such as hartree - fock calculations in two  @xcite and three dimensions ,  @xcite extended dmft ,  @xcite and quantum monte carlo simulations .",
    "@xcite however , all these methods have some drawback and only a combined analysis of complementary techniques can be able to clarify the nature of this challenging problem .",
    "any approach based on single - particle descriptions , like unrestricted hartree - fock ,  @xcite can uncover the emergence of an insulating gap only by forcing magnetic long - range order .",
    "more sophisticated approaches , like those based on dmft ,  @xcite can in principle manage without magnetism ,  @xcite but they usually miss important spatial correlations . the spatial distribution of local moments and its connection with griffiths singularities , which may emerge close to the mott insulator ,  @xcite have been recently discussed within a brinkmann - rice approach of the gutzwiller wave function .",

    ", an improved approach based on a variational wave function has been proposed to deal simultaneously with the physics of anderson s and mott s localization . in this work",
    ", we present an extensive and more complete study of the ground - state properties of the disordered hubbard model in two dimensions at half filling .",
    "moreover , we also discuss in great details the variational method used in our calculations . within our approach",

    "we consider both paramagnetic and magnetic properties . in the former case ,",
    "we impose the wave function @xmath25 to be paramagnetic , by fixing the variational parameters @xmath26 . on the contrary , in order to study magnetic properties , we consider a variational wave function that may break the spin - rotational symmetry , namely we allow the variational parameters to be @xmath27 .",
    "a more general choice of the trial wave function could also contain additional parameters for all ( nearest - neighbor ) hopping terms @xmath28 ( with no translational invariance ) .",
    "calculations performed on small lattices showed that , despite a much larger computational effort , this ansatz leads only to slightly lower energies , without modifying the ground - state properties .",

    "@xcite      to work out the zero - temperature phase diagram , we make use of the f - sum rule that allows us to interpret the small-@xmath40 behavior of density - density correlations .",

    "that , in order to have a correct definition of the dynamical structure factor @xmath42 , we have subtracted the disconnected term @xmath47 which is related to the elastic scattering of electrons and , in a disordered system , is finite for generic momenta @xmath40 .",
    "@xcite notice that , in a disordered system @xmath40 is no longer a good quantum number but , nevertheless , the average over different disorder configurations restores the translational invariance .",

    "a conducting state ( metallic or superconducting in the fermionic case and superfluid in the bosonic one ) is characterized by @xmath55 in any spatial dimensions , whereas , in order to correctly reproduce the static structure factor of a mott insulator , @xmath35 must be more singular , i.e. , @xmath56 in one and two dimensions and @xmath57 in three dimensions .",

    "[ fig : struct_u0 ] .",
    "we would like to emphasize that , in contrast to the clean case where @xmath50 implies a conducting behavior , here it just indicates a compressible state with gapless excitations , but not a metallic character , because the single - particle states are localized .",
    "the variational energy landscape of the disordered hubbard model may be characterized by the presence of different local minima . in fact , if we start from different points in the parameter space , namely from different values of @xmath33 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 , we may converge to different solutions . in the following , whenever we consider the paramagnetic sector , we impose @xmath66 along the whole optimization procedure . on the other hand ,",
    "when magnetic solutions are allowed , these conditions are relaxed along the monte carlo simulation and the two on - site energies ( for up and down spins ) are optimized independently . in the latter case",

    "this feature is particularly evident for large enough coulomb repulsion , whereas in the weak - coupling regime we recover a simple picture with only one minimum .",
    "remarkably , the appearance of different local minima is related to the presence of short - range magnetic correlations .",
    "in fact , by increasing the on - site coulomb repulsion , some sites acquire a finite magnetization and eventually order , giving rise to the typical staggered pattern .",
    "whenever local moments are present or the magnetization is very small , there are different electronic arrangements that give similar energies but may be hardly connected by simple single - particle moves , so to define metastable local minima .",
    "however , especially for the unfrustrated or the weakly - frustrated case , the presence of these local minima is not a dramatic problem .",
    "in fact , generally , all physical quantities , as for instance the density - density structure factor @xmath43 , give similar results in all these cases .",
    "therefore , we can safely conclude that all the optimized states share the same physical properties . as an example , fig .",
    "[ fig : tap2s ] shows the on - site magnetization @xmath77 pattern for the variational wave function optimized both starting from the paramagnetic point and from the staggered point .",
    "it is evident that there is no considerable difference between the two states , although some of the magnetization values are slightly different .",
    "we remark that , in most cases , we obtain a lower variational energy by starting from the paramagnetic point , even if the final converged state is magnetically ordered . therefore , although in some particularly delicate cases we considered different starting points , we usually initialize the simulation with a paramagnetic configuration .",
    "let us now discuss the accuracy in energy for a @xmath76 lattice , where the exact ground state can be calculated exactly by the lanczos algorithm .",
    "in particular , we consider four different wave functions : i ) the magnetic state with on - site gutzwiller and jastrow factors ( that corresponds to our best ansatz ) , ii ) the paramagnetic state with gutzwiller and jastrow terms , iii ) the magnetic state with only gutzwiller projectors , and iv ) the magnetic mean - field state @xmath78 ( i.e. , without any correlation term ) . for @xmath17",
    ", the exact ground state wave function can be obtained in all these cases , implying a very good accuracy also for small but finite values of @xmath79 . for small interactions",
    "there is no appreciable differences between paramagnetic and magnetic wave functions and for all _ correlated _ states the accuracy in the energy , i.e. , @xmath80 ( where @xmath74 and @xmath75 are the exact and the variational energies , respectively ) , is lower than @xmath81 .",
    "however , even for @xmath82 , the hartree - fock state , with no gutzwiller and jastrow factors , give a much worse accuracy than the other three correlated wave functions , see fig .",
    "[ fig : accuracy ] . for larger values of the interaction @xmath12 , the situation is different , since the paramagnetic state is generally worse than the magnetic wave functions , including the hartree - fock state .",
    "the accuracy of our best ansatz is about @xmath83 ( or less ) up to very large coulomb repulsions , which is acceptable in a disordered model .",

    "fig : accuracy ] .",

    ", the ground state has strong magnetic correlations and is well described with a ( gapped ) mean - field state . in the intermediate regime , our magnetic state with both on - site gutzwiller projectors and the long - range jastrow term may give a considerable improvement over the other states considered here .",
    "it should be stressed , however , that the jastrow factor is essential to have a _",
    "paramagnetic _ mott insulator , since in this case the charge gap can not be opened by an uncorrelated hartree - fock state . on the contrary , in the magnetic case , long - range jastrow correlations are not strictly necessary to capture the correct nature of the ground state , since the charge gap can be naturally created by a finite antiferromagnetic mean - field parameter .",
    "let us start our analysis of the disordered hubbard hamiltonian  ( [ eq : ham ] ) by enforcing a paramagnetic variational wave function , e.g. , by fixing the constraint @xmath84 for the parameters of the auxiliary mean - field hamiltonian  ( [ eq : anderson ] ) .",
    "although this choice is biased , since antiferromagnetic order may be present for finite electron - electron interaction , it gives significant insights into the interplay between disorder and interaction , without any `` spurious '' effect due to magnetism .",

    "we would like to remind the reader that , in the paramagnetic case , the mott insulator can be obtained only thanks to a singular jastrow factor , i.e. , @xmath56 . in this case , the ( paramagnetic ) mean - field hamiltonian  ( [ eq : anderson ] ) is always gapless and the charge gap opens because of the strong correlations induced by the jastrow term . in the magnetic case instead , two different mechanisms can open a gap : i ) the long - range charge correlations induced by the jastrow factor and ii ) the onset of long - range antiferromagnetic order due to a staggering of the @xmath37 s . for @xmath142 ,",
    "the static structure factor behaves like @xmath50 and the fourier transform of the jastrow parameters like @xmath55 ; on the other hand , for @xmath91 , we have that @xmath90 and @xmath56 .",

    "the results for @xmath43 and @xmath59 are reported in fig .",
    "[ fig : afnojas ] and indicate that the behavior for the two states is very similar ; even the critical value @xmath145 for the mott transition is the same in the two cases .",
    "therefore , we can conclude that , in the magnetic case , the charge gap opens mainly because of the presence of the mean - field order parameter .",
    "however , within the correlated wave function @xmath25 , the jastrow parameters still behave like @xmath56 in the mott phase .    in summary , the following scenario emerges : in the intermediate phase with antiferromagnetic order but finite compressibility , the mean - field density of state is large at the fermi level , however all states are localized ; by increasing the interaction @xmath12 , the jastrow factor becomes stronger and , at the same time , there is a suppression of the mean - field density of states at the fermi level ; by further increasing @xmath12 , a single - particle gap opens and the system becomes incompressible , see fig .  [",
    "fig : meanfdos ] .",
    "we remark that the tendency towards metallicity for intermediate values of @xmath79 is suppressed by the presence of magnetic order : this can be seen by noticing a reduced density of states at the fermi level for @xmath146 .",
    "in fact , for small values of the interaction , the localization length is short because of the strong disorder ; then it becomes larger for higher values of the interaction @xmath12 due to the disorder screening and then , at the antiferromagnetic transition , it decreases again .",
    "moreover , we notice that the single - particle wave functions are more localized in the magnetic case than in the paramagnetic one , even in the regime of maximum `` delocalization '' , i.e. , @xmath118 .",

    "we identify those sites with @xmath156 as local magnetic moments .",
    "the existence of such moments can be extracted from the pattern of the on - site magnetization @xmath70 ( as shown in ref .  ) or from the probability distribution of @xmath148 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : distrmom ] . here , we observe that for small interaction values , @xmath157 , the distribution has a narrow peak in correspondence of @xmath158 , however , at the same time , it has long tails indicating the presence of local moments . in this regime ,",
    "the ground state is an anderson insulator with a large number of paramagnetic sites and @xmath159 .",
    "for @xmath160 the distribution is spread between 0 and 0.8 , with a peak in correspondence of @xmath161 .",
    "this fact highlights the coexistence of paramagnetic sites with local magnetic moments ; these sites are not spatially correlated hence long - range magnetism is absent . by increasing the interaction strength , the peak at @xmath161 disappears and the one at @xmath162 becomes more pronounced ; in this case , local moments eventually display the typical staggered pattern of nel order .",
    "nevertheless , charge excitations are still gapless and @xmath50 .",
    "finally , in the mott insulating phase the distribution has a narrow peak at @xmath163 .      in the previous section",
    ", we showed that a disordered system of electrons on a square lattice undergoes a magnetic transition before becoming a mott insulator .",
    "therefore , the mott insulator is generically accompanied by magnetic order . however , in disordered materials , one could expect that long - range order may be strongly suppressed , leading to a _ bona - fide _ mott transition , where the incompressible phase has no magnetic order . in this sense ,",
    "the presence of a next - nearest - neighbor hopping @xmath0 may help to approach the mott phase without any `` spurious '' magnetic effects .",
    "indeed , this kind of frustrated hopping generates , in the strong - coupling regime , a super - exchange term @xmath164 that competes with the nearest - neighbor one @xmath165 .",
    "first of all , we notice that a finite frustrating ratio @xmath129 generates very complicated energy landscapes , with many local minima .",
    "furthermore , in contrast to the unfrustrated model , where different local minima share very similar physical properties , here different starting points in the parameter space may give rise to rather different wave functions , especially in the intermediate and strong - coupling regimes . concerning the starting point for the energy optimization",
    ", we will consider i ) a paramagnetic point , with @xmath66 , ii ) a staggered point , with @xmath166 , and iii ) a collinear point , with @xmath167 .",
    "notice that , in the latter case , the starting choice breaks both translational and rotational invariance , so to favor collinear magnetic order with @xmath168 , which is suitable for large @xmath129 .",
    "similarly , we can also consider @xmath169 , which gives rise to a collinear order with @xmath170 .",
    "in all these cases , each local energy @xmath37 ( for up and down spins ) is independently optimized , in order to achieve a full energy minimization .",
    "( color online ) collinear magnetization @xmath132 ( upper panel ) and the disconnected term of the density - density correlations @xmath59 ( lower panel ) of the lowest energy solution as a function of @xmath12 for @xmath62 and @xmath171 .",
    "the shaded area indicates the region where paramagnetic and magnetic solutions have similar energies . ]    for weak and intermediate frustration , the outcome is rather similar to the case with @xmath172 , except for @xmath173 .",
    "for instance , for @xmath174 and @xmath62 , the paramagnetic anderson insulator is stable for @xmath175 . up to this value of the coulomb interaction ,",
    "the energy of the converged state does not depend upon the choice of the starting point ( as for the unfrustrated case ) and there is no evidence for any non - trivial magnetic pattern . on the contrary , for @xmath176 , different results for the staggered magnetization are found when we initialize according to i ) or ii ) .",
    "in particular , the magnetization is strongly suppressed when considering a paramagnetic initial condition .",
    "these different solutions are very close in energy up to @xmath177 , even though , usually , the lowest minimum shows long - range order and finite compressibility ; for larger values of the interactions , i.e. , @xmath178 , the magnetic state gives definitely the best energy . by further increasing the coulomb repulsion ,",
    "namely for @xmath179 , the system becomes a mott insulator with nel order at @xmath122 .",
    "these results suggest that , for a finite frustrating ratio , the magnetic transition may become weakly first order ( with a regime in which there is a coexistence of different phases ) .",
    "the existence of a finite region with nearly degenerate states with different magnetic properties is even more pronounced in the strong frustration regime . for @xmath180 ,",
    "the solution obtained starting from ii ) gives always an higher energy with respect to i ) and iii ) , demonstrating that the nel state is clearly disadvantaged .",
    "again , in the weakly - correlated regime , i.e. , @xmath181 , paramagnetic and magnetic starting points give similar energies and magnetization patterns . for @xmath182 ,",
    "the ground state is a gapped insulator with @xmath183 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : collord ] .",
    "instead , in the intermediate region , for @xmath184 , the energy landscape shows different minima , which are nearly degenerate up to @xmath185 , whereas , for larger interactions , the wave function with collinear order gives the best approximation for the ground state , with a clear long - range magnetic order , see fig .",
    "[ fig : collord ] .",
    "the remarkable feature is that , in a wide range of coulomb repulsions , it is possible to find low - energy states just by starting from a paramagnetic wave function .",
    "this choice gives rise to patterns in which most of the sites have a net magnetization but an overall vanishing magnetic order .",
    "for @xmath186 , these solutions are incompressible , i.e. , @xmath187 and , therefore , may be viewed as disordered mott insulators . by decreasing the interaction strength , these states turn compressible , still having a large number of local moments .",
    "the presence of these metastable solutions , which are almost degenerate with the magnetically ordered wave function , suggests a sort of `` spin - glass '' behavior .",
    "the existence of a large number of such disordered states prevents one to have a smooth convergence to the lowest - energy solution , by starting from a generic configuration .    in summary , the frustrating",
    "hopping @xmath0 has two primary effects .",
    "the first one is the narrowing of the stability region of the magnetic anderson insulator .",
    "in addition , we have evidence that the magnetic transition turns to be first order , in contrast to the unfrustrated case .",
    "the second and most important effect of a frustrating hopping term is the development of a `` glassy '' phase at strong couplings , where many paramagnetic states , with disordered local moments , may be stabilized . although we do not find any evidence in favor of the stabilization of a true ( non - magnetic ) mott phase , this possibility can not be ruled out in the whole phase diagram",
    "in this paper , we have studied , by means of a variational monte carlo technique , zero - temperature properties of the disordered two - dimensional hubbard model at half filling .",
    "first of all , we showed that a variational wave function is able to describe the anderson - mott transition without any symmetry breaking , i.e. , a transition from a paramagnetic anderson insulator to a paramagnetic mott insulator .",
    "this is achieved thanks to long - range charge correlations induced in the wave function by a jastrow factor .",
    "we showed that the transition can be easily detected within variational monte carlo by looking at the behavior of the static structure factor and of the fourier transform of the jastrow parameters , namely following the same criteria for the mott transition in a clean system .",
    "moreover , we found that the disconnected term of the density - density correlation function , i.e. , @xmath188 , acts as an easily accessible order parameter for the anderson - mott transition .",
    "we found that electron - electron repulsion partially screens disorder : for strong interaction electrons feel an effective weak disorder potential that should imply an interaction - increased localization length .",
    "however , once the interaction exceeds a critical value , a gap opens and the model turns into a mott insulator . from our numerical calculations , the ground state is always insulating , yet , upon increasing the strength of interaction , the localization length may have a non - monotonous behavior when we consider the full variational wave function .",
    "when magnetism is allowed , a compressible and magnetic anderson insulating phase appears between the compressible paramagnetic anderson insulator and the incompressible magnetic mott insulator . when magnetism is not frustrated , all transitions are likely to be continuous . on the contrary , when frustration is included by means of next - nearest - neighbor hopping ,",
    "the paramagnetic to magnetic transition turns first order .",
    "moreover , in the magnetic region , it is also possible to stabilize many paramagnetic solutions with very low energy , suggesting a glassy behavior at finite temperature .",
    "indeed , all these paramagnetic states have local moments , i.e. , magnetic sites that would contribute with a finite @xmath189 term to the entropy at finite temperature .",
    "the fact that , in this simple two - dimensional model , we find local moments in the paramagnetic phase may suggest that this is a general feature of disordered systems close to a mott transition .",
