    "<S> box 500 , batavia , illinois 60510 _    1.5 cm    the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm )  @xcite has been widely considered as a leading candidate for new physics beyond standard model . however , unlike the standard model , additional symmetry , called @xmath1parity defined as @xmath7 , has to be imposed on the minimal supersymmetric extensions of standard model ( mssm ) in order to avoid renormalizable interactions which violate the lepton and baryon numbers . </S>",
    "<S> it is in fact one of the main theoretical weakness of these models because the conservation of @xmath1-parity is an ad hoc imposition without fundamental theoretical basis . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , it is interesting to ask how small these r - parity breaking couplings have to be by investigating the phenomenological constraints on them if they are indeed added to the mssm  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the most general renormalizable @xmath1-violating superpotential using only the mssm superfields is @xmath8 here , @xmath9 are generation indices and we have rotated away a term of the form @xmath10 . the couplings @xmath11 must be antisymmetric in flavor , @xmath12 . similarly , @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> there are 36 lepton number non - conserving couplings ( 9 of the @xmath14 type and 27 of the @xmath15 type ) and 9 baryon number non - conserving couplings ( all of the @xmath16 type ) in eq.(1 ) .    to avoid rapid proton decay , </S>",
    "<S> it is usually assumed in the literature that @xmath14 , @xmath15 type couplings do not coexist with @xmath16 type couplings . </S>",
    "<S> we make the same assumption here and consider constraints on @xmath16 couplings only . </S>",
    "<S> the constraints on @xmath14 and @xmath15 couplings  @xcite have been discussed quite extensively in the literature . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss a new set of constraints on @xmath16 due to their contributions to the neutron - anti - neutron oscillation ( nano ) through a new mechanism . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we wish to emphasize that couplings of @xmath16 type can not give rise to the proton decay only when the proton is the lightest particle with @xmath17 and @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> if there are lighter fermions with @xmath17 , such as lightest neutralino or gravitino , the proton can in principle decay into them . in that case </S>",
    "<S> strong constraint on @xmath16 can be derived and , if they indeed give the leading contributions to the proton decay , it will greatly affect the leading proton decay mode .    </S>",
    "<S> there are many existing constraints on the 9 different @xmath16 couplings , @xmath19 @xmath20 @xmath21 @xmath22 and @xmath23 . </S>",
    "<S> first of all , one can show  @xcite that the requirement of perturbative unification typically places a bound of order one on many of the couplings . </S>",
    "<S> a potential constraint on @xmath24 due to neutron - anti - neutron oscillation was discussed in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however it was later realized  @xcite that the constraint is not as strong as it was originally derived due to additional source of suppression factors . </S>",
    "<S> stronger constraints  @xcite on @xmath24 can be derived from the non - observation of double nucleon decay into two kaons ( such as @xmath25 ) , @xmath26 in addition , goity and sher  @xcite was able to find a one  loop mechanism which gives rise to a strong bound on @xmath27 by the non - observation of neutron - anti - neutron oscillations . </S>",
    "<S> for squark masses of 300 gev , their bound is roughly @xmath28 both numerical values have large uncertainty due to the nuclear matrix elements . in these references </S>",
    "<S> , some bounds on products of couplings were obtained by considering @xmath29-@xmath30 mixing . </S>",
    "<S> recently , bounds from the @xmath31 induced vertex correction to the decay of the @xmath32 into two charged leptons have been obtained  @xcite ; though potentially interesting , with present data they are not significantly better than the bound from perturbative unification . in ref.@xcite , </S>",
    "<S> carlson , roy and sher obtained some new bounds on the @xmath16 couplings from the rare two - body nonleptonic decays of @xmath33 and @xmath34 mesons . from the recent experimental upper bound  @xcite of @xmath35 on the branching ratio of @xmath36 </S>",

    "<S> for the decay @xmath39 or @xmath40 , using the experimental upper bound  @xcite of @xmath35 on @xmath41 , they obtained @xmath42 barbieri and masiero  @xcite also obtained bounds on @xmath16 from their one  loop contributions to the @xmath43-@xmath44 mass difference . </S>",
    "<S> these bounds can be summarized as  @xcite @xmath45 assuming that the top quark is much lighter than scalar top , and that all squark masses are degenerate . </S>",
    "<S> bounds from @xmath34-@xmath46 mixing also have been considered  @xcite and give @xmath47    let us first consider the constraints on @xmath16 imposed by the non - observation of nano . </S>",
    "<S> first of all , it is clear that in order to violate baryon number by two units one needs to use @xmath16 twice . </S>",
    "<S> goity and sher  @xcite discovered a one  loop diagram as in fig .  1 that can contribute to nano . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting effective operator is  @xcite @xmath48 the diagram is calculated at zero external momenta and yields @xmath49 here we assume the kobayashi - maskawa matrix of the left - handed squark is the same as that of the quarks . dummies @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 are generation indices which are summed in ( 8) . note that @xmath51 and @xmath52 can not be @xmath54 . </S>",
    "<S> we follow the convention and feynman rule in ref.@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the momentum integral @xmath55 is @xmath56 the mass  squared term @xmath57 which mixes @xmath58 and @xmath59 is given by @xmath60 coefficient @xmath61 is a soft supersymmetry breaking parameter@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> consistent with most of the mssm in the literature , we assume that all left  </S>",
    "<S> right squark mixing parameters are flavor diagonal .    </S>",
    "<S> phenomenologically , the neutron oscillation time is given by @xmath62 , where the transition probability ( per unit time ) @xmath63 . </S>",
    "<S> the amplitude @xmath64 due to the feynman diagram in fig .  1 is given by @xmath65 in ( 8) . </S>",
    "<S> the wave function squared @xmath66 , which is simply related to the matrix element of the operator in ( 7 ) , has been estimated by pasupathy@xcite to be @xmath67 gev@xmath68 . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless one should be aware that other evaluations@xcite differ by more than an order of magnitude . </S>",
    "<S> those differences among various evaluations characterize the degree of our ignorance about the matrix element ; however , @xmath69 will vary only as the square root of @xmath66 . from the experimental limit on the neutron oscillation time@xcite , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath70  s , the bound on @xmath69 can be obtained .    </S>",
    "<S> the results depend on the the squark masses as well as kobayashi - maskawa angles </S>",
    "<S> . we shall assumed , as is ref.@xcite , that the charm and up squark masses are degenerate . since @xmath65 has two powers of the masses of @xmath71 and @xmath72 , goity and sher assumed that the @xmath73 squark dominates . </S>",
    "<S> they obtained a strong bound on @xmath27 of roughly @xmath74 for @xmath75 gev and @xmath76 220 gev , for the scenario @xmath77 gev . </S>",
    "<S> note that if all three up  type squarks have the same mass , the transition amplitude in ( 8) vanishes because of the gim cancelation via the internal up  </S>",
    "<S> type squark line by suppression factors of the form @xmath78 where @xmath79 is a typical up  squark mass difference .    </S>",
    "<S> this set of diagrams turns out to be just one of the four sets of one  loop diagrams that can contribute to nano . </S>",
    "<S> the other three diagrams are given in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2,3,4 . </S>",
    "<S> it is not too hard to see that the contributions from diagrams in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3 and fig .  4 </S>",
    "<S> are proportional the external quark momenta and therefore their contributions are suppressed by additional factor of @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the neutron mass . </S>",
    "<S> since the remaining factors are roughly of the same order of magnitude , we shall ignore contributions from fig .  3 and fig .  4 </S>",
    "<S> even though they can be just as easily estimated .    the resulting effective operator from the contribution of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2 is @xmath82 where @xmath83 is estimated to be @xmath84 here the function @xmath85 of the momentum integral is defined to be @xmath86 the two diagrams fig </S>",
    "<S> .  1 and 2 can give rise to quite different constraints on @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> first of all , the two diagrams involve quite different operators and therefore their matrix elements may be quite different also . for numerical illustration , we shall take the two matrix elements to be the same . </S>",
    "<S> secondly , the two contributions , @xmath65 and @xmath83 , involve quite different dependence on @xmath87 parameters and various masses . </S>",
    "<S> unlike in the case of fig .  1 , the gim cancelation in case of degenerate squark masses does not occur in fig .  2 because the cancelation is already broken by the generation dependence in the couplings of @xmath16 . using the known quark mixing angles </S>",
    "<S> , we found numerically that the channels for @xmath50=@xmath53=@xmath88 and @xmath89=@xmath90 or @xmath73 dominate if all squarks have the same mass . barring from accidental cancelation due to different contributions for @xmath91 or @xmath73 </S>",
    "<S> , we obtain the constraints for the scenario @xmath92 , @xmath93    next we discuss the issue of the proton decay when the @xmath1-parity breaking terms such as @xmath16 and a light neutralino coexist . </S>",
    "<S> this possibility was mentioned only briefly in the literature . as emphasized earlier , </S>",
    "<S> if the proton is not the lightest fermion with zero lepton number , then in general the @xmath16 coupling will induce the proton to decay into such a lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) . </S>",
    "<S> for example , if the lsp is a photino and @xmath94 , the leading proton decay mode can be be @xmath95 due to the tree - level diagram in fig .  5 . </S>",
    "<S> previous search on proton decay mode @xmath96 @xcite can be translated into the experimental limit on this mode and places a very stringent constraint on the coupling @xmath97 for a slightly heavier photino , which is still lighter than the proton @xmath98 , the proton can still decay through @xmath99 or @xmath100 with a weaker bound on @xmath101 because additional vertices of the weak interaction are needed in the process . </S>",
    "<S> also in this case , one can consider a tree - level process that converts two nucleons in a nuclei into a photino in @xmath102 . </S>",
    "<S> if the lsp is higgsino or zino , the limit will be only slightly weakened .    * </S>",
