    "this article describes a foretaste study of accuracy for a recently proposed hamiltonian weak - coupling expansion procedure that in principle can start from a local asymptotically - free quantum field theory and produce sufficiently small relativistic effective hamiltonian eigenvalue problems that may be soluble on a computer and yield the wave functions of bound states in that theory .",
    "the study is needed to determine the prospects of reaching a reasonable accuracy in the expansion since the strong coupling constant rises when the renormalization group scale is lowered toward the scale of binding mechanism @xcite .",
    "so far , successful approaches required different formulations of the theory at the bound - state and high - energy scales , such as wilson s lattice and feynman s diagrammatic techniques @xcite .",
    "they also used approximations such as the non - relativistic limit that applies in the case of heavy quarkonia @xcite and helps in constructing effective theories in analogy with qed @xcite .",
    "the approach discussed here is the renormalization group procedure for effective particles ( rgep ) @xcite that stems from the application of the similarity renormalization group procedure @xcite to the light - front hamiltonian of qcd @xcite . in one and the same scheme",
    ", rgep produces the asymptotically free coupling constant in the hamiltonians for quarks and gluons @xcite , provides the conceptual framework for constructing the whole renormalized poincare algebra in terms of the creation and annihilation operators for effective particles @xcite , and leads to a simple first approximation in the case of heavy quarkonia @xcite .",
    "the procedure is boost invariant and raises a hope for connecting the constituent model for hadrons at rest @xcite and the parton picture in the infinite momentum frame @xcite .",
    "the key ingredient of the procedure is the vertex form factor @xmath0 that multiplies all interaction terms .",
    "it falls off quickly to zero when the change of an invariant mass in an interaction vertex exceeds the width parameter @xmath1 .",
    "this width variable is also the renormalization - group evolution parameter .",
    "the effective particles that correspond to a small value of @xmath1 can not be copiously created because the form factor makes the interactions effectively weak even if the coupling constant becomes large .",
    "the internal structure of the effective particles at such small @xmath1 may still be given by the parton - like picture in terms of constituents that correspond to a much larger value of @xmath2 in the same flow , where @xmath3 is the momentum scale of the external probe @xcite .",
    "qualitative accuracy studies of a similarity scheme were performed before @xcite using the elegant wegner flow equation @xcite , which was invented independently for solving hamiltonian eigenvalue problems in solid state physics . unfortunately , it was found that the wegner equation was not suitable for a straightforward weak - coupling expansion beyond second order .",
    "the coefficients of the expansion grew too fast and alternated in sign , which lead to erratic results for bound state energies with no signs of convergence .",
    "but the wegner equation can be modified within the similarity scheme @xcite and the improved equation provides the benchmark here for estimating the accuracy prospects for the relativistic rgep procedure .",
    "the comparison with the altered wegner equation and the fact that improvements are also needed in condensed matter physics @xcite , imply that the effective particle approach may also find application outside qcd , i.e. , wherever the dynamical couplings increase in the flow of hamiltonians toward the region of physical interest .",
    "the rgep strategy that is tested here is to start with a regulated @xmath4 of the theory to be solved ( this @xmath4 provides an initial condition for the differential equations of rgep at @xmath5 ) , and to evaluate @xmath6 with @xmath1 on the order of a bound - state energy as a series in powers of a coupling constant @xmath7 .",
    "after evaluation of @xmath6 , one calculates its matrix elements in the basis defined by eigenstates of the hamiltonian @xmath8 , which is obtaind from @xmath6 by setting @xmath9 ; @xmath10 for all values of the label @xmath11 .",
    "suppose that the labels are ordered so that @xmath12 implies @xmath13 and the initial hamiltonian is regulated by forcing matrix elements @xmath14 to vanish unless @xmath15 with certain ultraviolet cutoff number @xmath16 and infrared cutoff @xmath17 .",
    "the rgep procedure is designed in such a way that the matrix elements @xmath18 quickly tend to 0 when @xmath19 grows above @xmath1 , see fig .",
    "[ matrix ] .",
    "the next step is to focus attention on the window @xmath20 of matrix elements of @xmath6 among the basis states that have energies similar to the energy scale @xmath21 of the physical problem at hand , i.e. , @xmath22 with @xmath23 and @xmath24 . since only states within the width @xmath1 on the energy scale",
    "can directly interact with each other , states that differ in energy from @xmath21 by much more than @xmath1 are usually not important @xcite .",
    "they can be important as long as the coupling strength can overcome the difference in energy , but it does not matter here because the coupling constant is assumed to not grow to large values .",
    "the next step is to solve the non - perturbative eigenvalue equation for the matrix @xmath25 by diagonalizing it on a computer .",
    "the middle - size eigenvalues of @xmath26 are expected to be close to the exact solutions with accuracy that depends on many factors in the procedure .",
    "these dependencies need to be estimated .",
    "the main question addressed here concerns the accuracy of the weak - coupling expansion for @xmath20 .    ) for the matrix @xmath27 with indices @xmath23 .",
    "the matrix of @xmath6 is represented by the large square .",
    "matrix elements of @xmath6 outside the diagonal band of width @xmath1 are equivalent to zero . in the model study : @xmath28 gev , @xmath29 gev , and the width @xmath30 gev . ]",
    "an exact rgep procedure provides @xmath27 whose structure depends on @xmath1 but the eigenvalues of the middle size in the window spectrum do not .",
    "becasue the couplings to the states outside the window are ignored , the eigenvalues of sizes at the limits of the window spectrum can not be accurate even if the window is calculated exactly .",
    "now , when one calculates @xmath20 in the expansion in powers of @xmath7 to some order , and extrapolates the result to @xmath31 , considerable errors can ensue because of the missing terms in the series .",
    "moreover , one never knows the right value of @xmath7 at given @xmath1 from the theory .",
    "therefore , one must fit @xmath7 to the bound - state observables and perform consistency checks for a whole set of them .",
    "the smaller is @xmath1 the larger is @xmath7 and the more significant are the errors of perturbation theory in evaluation of @xmath20 .",
    "but at the same time the larger is @xmath1 , the larger must be the range @xmath32 $ ] of basis states needed in the computer diagonalization of @xmath20 .",
    "a compromise must be made and the critical question is how close one can come to a true solution using rgep equations .",
    "the question is essential for the prospects of applying rgep to qcd .",
    "a well - known asymptotically free matrix model is used here to find out what level of accuracy can in principle be expected .",
    "one should stress at this point that even if the test gave a promising result in the model , the utility of the procedure would remain only tentative until the actual calculations in realistic theories are performed and display signs of stability as functions of the order of the expansion , size of @xmath1 , variation of the window , and other more specific features of the eigenvalue problems at hand .",
    "section [ sec : model ] defines the test model and quotes equations used for calculating @xmath6 in the benchmark of the altered wegner s flow and in the rgep case .",
    "section [ sec : ae ] describes results obtained using six different ways of fitting the coupling constant to the exact spectrum .",
    "these ways are labeled throughout the paper by letters a , b , c , d , e , and f. each of these versions is studied in six successive orders of the weak - coupling expansion .",
    "section [ sec : c ] provides a brief conclusion .",
    "appendix [ app:4th ] contains the generic analytic rgep formula for 4th order calculations that applies to arbitrary @xmath4 , and appendix [ app : nd ] provides the numbers that illustrate in detail what happens in the expansions including from one to six orders .",
    "the matrix elements of the model hamiltonian used here for estimating the accuracy of rgep are @xcite @xmath33 where @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath11 is an integer , with a convention that the energy equal 1 corresponds to 1 gev .",
    "the model diverges and needs to be regulated by the ultraviolet cutoff @xmath36 that limits the allowed energies @xmath37 from above .",
    "also a low energy cutoff , @xmath38 , is introduced for making the hamiltonian matrix finite and enable exact computations , but the lower bound is of no physical consequence for the results reported here .",
    "thus , the subscripts in eq .",
    "( [ eq : hmodel ] ) are limited to the range @xmath39 $ ] , @xmath17 being large negative and @xmath16 large positive .",
    "the ultraviolet renormalizability of the model , its asymptotic freedom , and its lack of sensitivity to the infrared cutoff , were described in @xcite .",
    "two values of the cutoff @xmath16 and the corresponding coupling constant @xmath40 are used in this study of rgep : @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "the two cutoffs are introduced to verify the accuracy of renormalizability in the rgep scheme .",
    "it is known that for such large values of @xmath16 the effective dynamics with @xmath43 is practically independent of @xmath16 in the case of altered wegner s equation , and one can verify how well the rgep approach satisfies this condition . at the same time , this condition puts constraints on the range of changes that one can consider in varying the rgep generator without interference with renormalizability ( see below ) . the coupling constants @xmath44 amd @xmath45 are fitted to obtain the exact bound - state eigenvalue @xmath46 with 8 digits of accuracy for @xmath47 and @xmath48 , as in @xcite . with these choices , the hamiltonian @xmath4 is a @xmath49 @xmath50 @xmath49 matrix with @xmath51 positive eigenvalues , and one negative , spanning the range of energies between @xmath52 kev and @xmath53 or 1000 tev .",

    "the initial condition contains counterterms but the similarity analysis showed @xcite that the structure of the counterterms is simple and the presence of them is equivalent for large @xmath16 to making @xmath56 in @xmath4 depend on @xmath16 .",
    "this is precisely what is done by the fitting mentioned earlier that guarantees that the eigenvalue @xmath57 stays unchanged for different @xmath16s .",
    "all small eigenvalues are then independent of @xmath16 .",
    "the generator of the similarity transformation can be written as ( @xmath58 ) @xmath59 different choices of @xmath60 lead to different matrix elements of the renormalized hamiltonians .",

    "but we have studied various factors @xmath74 a la @xcite and found that @xmath75 is also the best choice to make in rgep , for similar reasons .",
    "in addition , it is useful for the test that these factors are made equal since then the first order calculations give identical results in both approaches .",

    "one has to solve a complex linear problem to extract @xmath76 .",
    "but the altered wegner equation provides a perturbative benchmark pattern that is known to approximate an exact solution well and one can estimate the accuracy of rgep by comparison .    in the perturbative evaluation of @xmath6 , the rgep calculus is free from the problem of extracting @xmath76 because the derivative is computed order by order and all terms needed on the right - hand side are known at each successive order from the lower order results . in fact , the new procedure is designed for a perturbative approach .",
    "it is simpler than the wegner case in the sense that the form factors guarantee the band structure in perturbation theory so that this structure does not have to be recovered from and controlled in the evolution of specific matrix elements .",
    "small energy denominators that might otherwise lead to infrared singularities are excluded by design of rgep .",
    "it also does not generate any terms with inverse powers of @xmath1 in the coefficients of products of the interaction hamiltonian ( see appendix [ app:4th ] and eq .",

    "such terms can in principle lead to a variety of mixing effects in the evolution of @xmath6 , when one uses the wegner equation . on top of these purely quantum mechanical features ,",

    ", it preserves the cluster decomposition property @xcite in the effective interactions .",
    "all these features are desired for the description of relativistic particles using theories with asymptotic freedom .",

    "it is conceivable that such understanding may further improve the weak - coupling expansion .",
