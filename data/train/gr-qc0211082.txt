    "the  standard \" inflationary model is based on a flat ( @xmath0 ) friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) geometry , motivated by the fact that inflationary expansion rapidly wipes out any original spatial curvature .",
    "however , even though inflation drives the curvature term , @xmath1 towards zero , or equivalently , drives the total density parameter @xmath2 towards 1 , this does _ not _ imply that @xmath3 .",
    "conditions leading to the open set of values @xmath4 are far less fine - tuned than those corresponding precisely to @xmath3 ( although closed models have other fine - tuning aspects ) . but irrespective of any arguments about fine - tuning , the spatial curvature of the real universe is in principle determined by observations ; theory will have to give way to data if the data clearly tell us that @xmath5 .",
    "recent cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) and other data  @xcite are not conclusive , but include the possibility that @xmath6 , with @xmath7    future experiments such as planck will reduce these error bars and give more accurate information about the curvature of the universe .",
    "( note that the true global value of @xmath8 and its observed value in the local hubble volume may differ due to cosmological perturbations seeded by inflation . )",
    "current data mean that we should take closed universes , and therefore closed inflationary models , seriously .",
    "inflation in a closed universe is sometimes considered to be ruled out by unrealistic fine - tuning  @xcite .",
    "if this were true , then observational confirmation of @xmath9 would rule out inflation .",
    "but in fact there is a wide range of closed inflationary models , and it is not too difficult to construct simple and consistent models without excessive fine - tuning ( see also ref .",
    "it is also true that fine - tuned initial conditions can not be ruled out by purely scientific arguments , as we discuss below . for the models that we consider ,",
    "the value of @xmath10 is set by choosing one parameter , while the magnitude of large - scale scalar perturbations fixes another parameter .",
    "if @xmath11 is taken as 1.02 , then the power spectra of cmb anisotropies and matter can show testable differences from the standard flat model  @xcite .",
    "if @xmath10 is very small , then curvature is negligible as regards structure formation processes in the universe .",
    "the smaller that @xmath12 is , the more closely the models approximate the standard flat model . but in the early inflationary universe , positive curvature can play a significant role and lead to novel features that do not arise when @xmath13 , for example allowing a minimum in the scale factor @xmath14 which is otherwise not possible , or putting limits on the number of possible e - foldings in the inflationary epoch  @xcite .",
    "primordial history is very different when @xmath6 than in the case @xmath15 , regardless of how small @xmath16 is , and a variety of possibilities arise , including universes with a minimum radius .",
    "singularity theorems have been devised that apply in the inflationary context , showing that the universe necessarily had a beginning ( according to classical and semi - classical theory )  @xcite . in other words , according to these theorems the quantum gravity era can not be avoided in the past even if inflation takes place . however , the models we present escape this conclusion , because they do not satisfy the geometrical assumptions of these theorems . specifically , the theorems assume either ( a )  that the universe has open space sections , implying @xmath3 or @xmath17 , or ( b )  that the hubble expansion rate @xmath18 is bounded away from zero in the past , @xmath19 .",
    "there are inflationary universes that evade these constraints and hence avoid the conclusions of the theorems ( this was also noted in ref .",
    "it is also possible to find counter - examples that are open , i.e. , where assumption ( a ) is not violated , but this typically involves sophisticated constructions  @xcite .",
    "here we consider closed models in which @xmath6 and @xmath20 can become zero , so that both assumptions ( a ) and ( b ) of the inflationary singularity theorems are violated .",
    "the models are simple , obey general relativity , and contain only ordinary matter and ( minimally coupled ) scalar fields .",
    "previous examples of closed inflationary models  @xcite are , to our knowledge , either bouncing models or models in which inflation is preceded by deceleration ( so that a singularity is not avoided ) .",
    "the @xmath6 bouncing universe collapses from infinite size in the infinite past and then turns around at @xmath21 to expand in an inflationary phase .",
    "the canonical model for such a bounce is the de  sitter universe in the @xmath6 frame , with @xmath22 these coordinates cover the whole spacetime , which is geodesically complete  @xcite .",
    "however , the bouncing models face serious difficulties as realistic cosmologies .",
    "the initial state is hard to motivate ( collapsing from infinite size without causal interaction ) , and it is also difficult to avoid nonlinearities in the collapse that prevent a regular bounce .",
    "we show here that when @xmath23 there are closed inflationary models that do not bounce , but inflate from a static beginning , and then reheat in the usual way .",
    "the inflationary universe emerges from a small static state that has within it the seeds for the development of the macroscopic universe , and we call this the  emergent universe \" scenario .",
    "( this can be seen as a modern version and extension of the eddington universe . )",
    "the universe has a finite initial size , with a finite amount of inflation occurring over an infinite time in the past , and with inflation then coming to an end via reheating in the standard way .",
    "the redshift and the total number of e - folds remain bounded through the expansion of the universe until the present day , because the scale - factor is bounded away from zero in the past .",
    "there is _ no _ horizon problem , since the initial state is einstein static .",
    "since they start as einstein static , they avoid a singularity . the initial static state can be chosen to have a radius above the planck scale , so that these models can even avoid a quantum gravity regime , whatever the true quantum gravity theory may be .    because they can undergo a large amount of inflation , these models can be effectively the same as the standard flat models as regards structure formation processes .",
    "therefore they are not vulnerable to future reductions in the observed value of @xmath24 below 0.02 ( provided that it remains positive ) , and they can reproduce the successes of the standard inflationary cosmologies , but from very different primordial foundations .",
    "we do not require exotic physics or matter .",

    "both conditions are required to attain an asymptotic einstein static state , the one ensuring asymptotic validity of the friedmann equation , and the other , that of the raychaudhuri equation .",
    "the model can be criticized because of its fine - tuned initial state .",
    "there are two basic responses to this criticism .",
    "* the criticism does not rule out these models as valid physical models , but rather claims they are not likely to occur in reality because they are improbable .",
    "but the inflationary singularity theorems  @xcite are not based on probabilities , and the emergent models do indeed show that the geometric conditions of those theorems need not be satisfied . * the force of the fine - tuning criticism is based partly in philosophy not only in physics .",
    "there is no scientifically based proof that the unique physical universe has to be probable .",
    "this points to a tension in cosmology between two viable but opposed views on how to explain the current state of the universe .    *",
    "the one view is that the present state of the universe is highly probable because physical processes make it very likely to have occurred  @xcite . *",
    "the opposite view is that nature prefers symmetry , and the universe is likely to have originated in a highly symmetric , and necessarily fine - tuned , state  @xcite .",
    "the key point is that there is no scientific proof that the one or the other of these approaches is the correct approach to use in cosmology .",
    "a quantum gravity theory may resolve this and other issues relating to the origin of the universe , but in the absence of such a theory , it seems worthwhile to pursue the implications of both approaches .",
    "the underlying problem within classical and semi - classical cosmology is the uniqueness of the universe , and all the scientific and philosophical difficulties that this entails  @xcite .",
    "one can not straightforwardly apply statistics or probability to a unique object . there may be a scientific basis for the use of probability in the context of an ensemble of universes  a multiverse . but this is a complex and controversial proposal , and there is no evidence that it is correct ; indeed it may not be scientifically testable  @xcite .",
    "consequently the choice between these two fundamentally different approaches to cosmological origins remains of necessity a partly philosophical one , while we lack a more complete quantum gravity theory that explains what actually underlies the existence of the real physical universe .",
    "furthermore , it is not simply a case of fine - tuning versus non - fine - tuning .",
    "the standard @xmath3 inflationary models , which avoid a special initial state , are not free of fine - tuning , in particular , the fine - tuning entailed in the choice of @xmath3 .",
    "there is no mechanism to attain @xmath3 ( as opposed to @xmath94 ) , and no obvious way to prove observationally that @xmath95 to the infinite accuracy required to establish that in reality @xmath3 .",
    "this standard assumption would appear to involve the same kind of fine - tuning as occurs in the emergent universe , because of the exact balance required to set @xmath3 .",
    "the standard inflationary models necessarily have a singularity in the past  @xcite . although it is possible to evade the singularity when @xmath3  @xcite , this requires complicated modifications of the spacetime .",
    "it also appears to invoke a fine - tuned initial state , not unlike the fine - tuning involved in the emergent models .",
    "the choice can therefore also be seen as between a singularity and a fine - tuned non - singular initial state .",
    "there are arguments for each choice .",
    "the singular inflationary models have the strength of generality of initial conditions ( at some time after the classical singularity , i.e. , effectively after the planck era ) .",
    "they have a disadvantage of starting at a spacetime singularity where all of physics breaks down and spacetime itself comes to an end ( though quantum gravity effects may be able to avoid this ) .",
    "the emergent universe has the advantage of avoiding a singularity ( with or without a planck era ) .",
    "there are also arguments that a highly symmetric start to the universe is necessary for the thermodynamic arrow of time to function as it does  @xcite .",
    "the emergent universe scenario gives a framework for investigating what are the implications if whatever process caused the universe to come into being , preferred the high - symmetry state of the einstein static universe to any less ordered state .",
    "there are various arguments in support of the einstein static model as a preferred initial state .    * it is neutrally stable against inhomogeneous linear perturbations when @xmath96 ( as in the simple emergent model above ) , or when @xmath97 and the sound speed of matter obeys @xmath98 , as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , extending the initial results of refs .",
    "it is of course unstable to _ homogeneous _ perturbations , which break the balance between curvature and energy density .",
    "this instability is crucial for producing an inflationary era . *",
    "it has no horizon problem . *",
    "it maximizes the entropy within the family of frw radiation models  @xcite . *",
    "it is the unique highest symmetry non - empty frw model , being invariant under a 7-dimensional group of isometries  @xcite .",
    "the einstein static model has a well - defined vacuum , and casimir effects ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) could play an important role in determining the primordial parameters of the emergent universe .",
    "the realization of the emergent universe outlined above and elaborated in ref .",
    "@xcite , illustrated qualitatively in fig .  1 , has the advantage of simplicity .",
    "but the fact that the initial einstein static state is only achieved asymptotically in the infinite past could be seen as a disadvantage .",
    "it is possible to find other realizations of the scenario in which the universe starts expanding from an einstein static state at a finite time in the past .    for example",
    ", one can consider potentials with a critical value @xmath99 , where @xmath100 , above a stable minimum at @xmath69 , i.e. , @xmath101 the scalar field is initially at the critical position @xmath102 ; since there is no kinetic energy ( @xmath57 ) , matter is necessary ( @xmath103 ) to provide an initial static state .",
    "specifically , by eqs .",
    "( [ es1 ] ) and ( [ es2 ] ) , we have @xmath104 if the initial position is an unstable ( tachyonic ) maximum , i.e. , @xmath105 , then the field rolls down to the true minimum , similar to natural inflation potentials .",
    "if the initial position is a false vacuum minimum , then the field needs to tunnel towards the true minimum .",
    "another alternative is an inflationary potential that depends on temperature in much the same way as in the first inflationary universe models . in the initial einstein static state , with matter at some temperature , the field starts at a minimum , which becomes unstable after a perturbation .",
    "this leads to expansion of the universe , and consequently the temperature falls , which results in the appearance of a lower minimum .",
    "we have shown that inflationary cosmologies exist in which the horizon problem is solved before inflation begins , there is no singularity , no exotic physics is involved , and the quantum gravity regime can even be avoided .",
    "these emergent universe models can be constructed with simple potentials ( illustrated schematically in fig .  1 ) , giving past - infinite inflation from an asymptotically initial einstein static state , with a bounded number of e - folds and redshift , followed by reheating in the usual way .",
    "explicit and simple forms of the potential can be found that are consistent with present cosmological observations for suitable choice of parameters in the potential  @xcite .",
    "other realizations exist in which the universe starts inflating from an einstein static state at a finite time in the past .",
    "the emergent models illustrate the potentially strong primordial effects of positive spatial curvature , leading to a very different early universe than the standard models , while producing a late universe that can be observationally distinguished from the standard case only by high - precision observations .",
    "if one requires , within classical and semi - classical general relativity theory , a non - singular universe with standard fields and matter , then this is only possible if @xmath6 .",
    "if one further rules out bouncing models because of problems in achieving a regular bounce , then one is led to the emergent universe scenario , with its fine - tuned initial einstein static state .",
    "this state is preferred by its appealing stability , entropy and geometric properties , and provides , because of its compactness , an interesting arena for investigating the casimir and other effects .",
    "the emergent universe scenario with @xmath6 provides an interesting alternative to the standard inflationary scenario with @xmath3 , in the case that @xmath8 is close to , but above , 1 .",
    "this may be seen as a choice between a fine - tuned non - singular initial state , and a singularity that precedes generic initial conditions .",
    "we do not claim that the emergent scenario is superior to the standard scenario , but simply that it is worthwhile investigating , since neither it nor the standard scenario are yet ruled out by scientific arguments . in the absence of a quantum gravity theory that can explain the true nature of the origin of the universe , both approaches remain valid to investigate and test .",
    "the two approaches lead to observationally viable models , at least until there is firm observational evidence determining the curvature parameter @xmath106 of the universe .",
    "if future observations turn out to provide strong evidence for positive curvature , then the standard models will be ruled out , and the emergent models and other closed models with a singularity and deceleration preceding inflation  @xcite , would be contenders to describe the universe .",
    "of course if @xmath24 is shown to be negative , then all closed models and the standard models will be ruled out .",
    "however , if the universe is in fact exactly flat , observations will not be able to rule out a very tiny positive curvature ( and the existence of perturbations prevents a very accurate measurement ) .",
    "thus if the standard is model is correct , the emergent universe with perturbatively small curvature can not be falsified by observations , although it does produce a very different early universe .",
