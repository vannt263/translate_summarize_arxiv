    "over the last years , a considerable number of high quality observational data have transformed radically the field of cosmology .",
    "results from distance measurements of type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) ( perlmutter et al . 1999 ; riess et al . 1998 ; 2004 ) combined with cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) observations from ballon ( de bernardis et al .",
    "2000 ; odwyer et al .",
    "2003 ) , ground ( mason et al . 2003 ) and satelite experiments ( spergel et al . 2003 ) and with dynamical estimates of the quantity of matter in the universe ( calberg et al . 1996",
    "; dekel et al .",
    "1997 ) seem to indicate that the simple picture provided by the standard cold dark matter scenario ( scdm ) is not enough .",
    "these observations are usually explained by introducing a new hypothetical energy component with negative pressure , the so - called dark energy or _ quintessence _",
    "( for recent reviews on this topic , see sahni & starobinsky , 2000 ; peebles & ratra 2003 ; padmanabhan , 2003 ; lima , 2004 and references therein ) .",
    "besides its consequences on fundamental physics , if confirmed , the existence of this dark component would also provide a definitive piece of information connecting the inflationary flatness prediction with astronomical data .",
    "on the other hand , it is also well known that not less exotic mechanisms like , e.g. , geometrical effects from extra dimensions may be capable of explaning such observational results .",
    "the basic idea behind these  braneworld cosmologies \" is that our 4-dimensional universe would be a surface or a brane embedded into a higher dimensional bulk space - time to which gravity could spread ( hoava & witten , 1996a ; 1996b ; randall l. & sundrum , 1999 ; dvali , gabadadze & porrati , 2000 ; perivolaropoulos & sourdis 2002 ; maia _ et al . _ , 2004 ) . in some of these scenarios",
    "the observed acceleration of the universe can be explained ( without dark energy ) from the fact that the bulk gravity sees its own curvature term on the brane acting as a negative - pressure dark component which accelerates the universe .",
    "a natural conclusion from these and other similar studies is that dark energy , or rather , the gravitational effects of a dark energy could actually be achieved from a modification of the friedmann equation arising from new physics .    following this reasoning ,",
    "several authors have recently investigated cosmologies with a modified friedmann equation from extra dimensions as an alternative explanation for the recent observational data ( deffayet , dvali & gabadadze , 2002 ; alcaniz , 2002 ; jain , dev & alcaniz , 2002 ; alcaniz , jain & dev , 2002 ; lue & starkman , 2003 ; lue , scoccimarro & starkman , 2004 ; alcaniz & pires , 2004 ; zhu & alcaniz , 2004 ; sahni & shtanov 2004 ) .",
    "for example , in sahni & shtanov ( 2002 ) a new class of braneworld models which admit a wider range of possibilities for dark energy than do the usual quintessence scenarios was investigated . for a subclass of the parameter values ,",
    "the acceleration of the universe in this class of models can be a transient phenomena which could help reconcile an accelerating universe with the requirements of string / m - theory ( fischler et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "recently , dvali & turner ( 2003 ) explored the phenomenology and detectability of a correction on the friedmann equation of the form @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the matter density parameter , @xmath8 is the hubble parameter ( the subscript  o \" refers to present time ) and @xmath9 is a parameter to be adjusted by the observational data .",
    "such a correction behaves like a dark energy with an effective equation of state given by @xmath10 in the recent past and like a cosmological constant ( @xmath11 ) in the distant future .",
    "also based on extra dimensions physics , freese & lewis ( 2002 ) proposed the so - called _ cardassian expansion _",
    ", a model in which the universe is flat , matter dominated and currently accelerated . in the cardassian universe ,",
    "the new friedmann equation is given by @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is an arbitrary function of the matter energy density @xmath2 . in the first version of these scenarios ,",
    "the function @xmath13 was given by @xmath14 , with the second term driving the acceleration of the universe at a late epoch after it becomes dominant ( a detailed discussion for the origin of this cardassian term from extra dimensions physics is given by chung & freese 2002 .",
    "see also cline & vinet 2003 ) .",
    "although being completely different from the physical viewpoint , it was promptly realized that by identifying some free parameters cardassian models and quintessence scenarios parameterized by an equation of state @xmath15 predict the same observational effects in what concerns tests involving only the evolution of the hubble parameter with redshift ( freese & lewis 2002 ) .",
    "more recently , several forms for the function @xmath13 have been proposed ( freese 2003 ) . in particular , wang _",
    "( 2003 ) have studied some observational characteristics of a direct generalization of the original cardassian model . according to the authors , the observational expressions in this new scenario are very different from generic quintessence cosmologies and",
    "fully determined by two dimensionless parameters , @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "observational constraints from a variety of astronomical data have also been investigated recently , both in the original cardassian model ( zhu & fujimoto 2002 ; 2003 ; sen & sen 2003a ; 2003b ) and in its generalized versions ( wang et al .",
    "2003 ; savage , sugiyama & freese 2004 ; amarzguioui , elgaroy & multamaki , 2004 ) .",
    "perhaps the most interesting feature of cardassian models is that although being matter dominated , they may be accelerating and may still reconcile the indications for a flat universe ( @xmath16 ) from cmb observations with clustering estimates that point consistently to @xmath17 with no need to invoke either a new dark component or a curvature term . in these scenarios",
    ", it happens through a redefinition of the value of the critical density ( freese & lewis 2002 )  see also below .",
    "the aim of this paper is to test the viability of generalized cardassian ( gc ) scenarios from statistical properties of gravitational lensing . to this end",
    ", we use the recent cosmic all sky survey ( class ) lensing sample , which constitutes the so far largest lensing sample suitable for statistical analysis .",
    "we show that for a large interval of the parameters @xmath3 and @xmath4 characterizing the models , gc scenarios are fully compatible with the current gravitational lensing observations .",
    "we also explore other observational aspects of the model like , e.g. , those related to the acceleration redshift ( i.e. , the redshift at which the universe begins to accelerate ) and to the age - redshift relation .",
    "the modified friedmann equation for gc models is ( wang et al .",
    "2003 ) @xmath18^{1/q } , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are two free parameters to be adjusted by the observational data , @xmath19 is the energy density at which the two terms inside the bracket become equal and @xmath20 is the present day matter density . note that for values of @xmath21 and @xmath22 , gc scenarios reduce to cold dark matter models with a cosmological constant ( @xmath23cdm ) . as explained in wang et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , the first term inside the bracket dominates initially in such a way that the standard picture of the early universe is completely maintained . at a redshift @xmath24 ,",
    "these two terms become equal and , afterwards , the second term dominates , leading or not to an accelerated expansion ( note , however , that @xmath25 is not necessarily the acceleration redshift .",
    "see , e.g. , the discussion below on the deceleration parameter ) .    evaluating eq .

    "it means that in the context of gc models it is possible to make the dynamical estimates of the quantity of matter that consistently point to @xmath31 compatible with the observational evidence for a flat universe from cmb observations and the inflationary flatness prediction with no need of a dark energy component ( see freese & lewis ( 2002 ) for a more detailed discussion ) . in fig .",
    "1 we show a generalized version of the figure 1 of freese & lewis ( 2002 ) in which the plane @xmath32 is displayed for selected values of @xmath4 . the contours are labeled indicating the fraction of the standard critical density for different combinations of @xmath25 and @xmath3 . in particular , the points inside the shadowed area delimited by the contours 0.2 - 0.4 are roughly consistent with the present clustering estimates ( calberg et al . 1996 ; dekel et al .",
    "1997 ) .    0.1 in    from eq .",
    "( 3 ) , we see that the observed matter density parameter in gc models can be written as @xmath33^{-{1/q}}.\\ ] ] for the gc expansion parameterized by @xmath3 and @xmath4 , the deceleration parameter as a function of the redshift has the following form @xmath34 where an overdot denotes derivative with respect to time , @xmath35 is the cosmological scale factor and @xmath36 is given by eq . ( 7 ) .",
    "the behavior of the deceleration parameter as a function of redshift for some selected values of @xmath3 and @xmath4 and @xmath37 is shown in figure 2 . as discussed earlier ,",
    "although completely dominated by matter , gc scenarios allow periods of accelerated expansion for some combinations of the parameters @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "note that the present acceleration is basically determined by the value of @xmath3 and that the smaller its value the more accelerated is the present expansion for a given value of @xmath4 .",
    "for example , for @xmath38 and @xmath21 , gc models accelerate presently faster ( @xmath39 ) than flat @xmath23cdm scenarios with @xmath40 ( @xmath41 ) although the acceleration redshift is almost identical ( @xmath42 ) while for the same value of @xmath4 and @xmath43 we find @xmath44 and @xmath45 . in order to make clear the difference between @xmath25 and @xmath46 , for the latter values of @xmath4 and @xmath3",

    "of first year wmap data , it was shown that for a subset of cardassian models the age of the universe varies in the interval 13.4 - 13.8 gyr , which is surprisingly close to the standard @xmath23cdm prediction ( @xmath56 gyr ) .    the angular diameter distance to a light source , defined as",
    "the ratio of the source diameter to its angular diameter , is an important concept in lensing statistics . for the class of gc models here investigated , the angular diameter distance , @xmath57 , between two objects , for example a lens at @xmath58 and a source ( galaxy ) at @xmath59 , reads @xmath60",
    "in this section we present our study of statitical properties of gravitational lenses in gc scenarios based on the final class well - defined statistical sample ( for similar studies in quintessence and quartessence scenarios see , e.g. , chae et al .",
    "2004 ; jain et al . 2004 ) .",
    "the class sample consists of 8958 radio sources out of which 13 sources are multiply imaged .",
    "here we work only with those multiply imaged sources whose image - splittings are known ( or likely ) to be caused by single galaxies .",
    "there are 9 such radio sources : 0218 + 357 , 0445 + 123 , 0631 + 519 , 0712 + 472 , 0850 + 054 , 1152 + 199 , 1422 + 231 , 1933 + 503 , 2319 + 051 .",
    "we , therefore , following chae et al .",

    "two large - scale galaxy surveys , namely , the 2df galaxy redshift - survey ( 2dfgrs ) and the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) have produced converging results on the total lf .",

    "note that a decrease in the value of @xmath3 at fixed @xmath94 and @xmath4 tends to increase the optical depth for lensing . for @xmath95 at @xmath96 , the value of @xmath97 for @xmath98 is down from that one for @xmath99 by a factor of @xmath100 , while the same values of @xmath3 and @xmath101 provide values for @xmath97 that are up from the previous ones only by a factor of @xmath102 1.1 and 1.25 , respectively .",

    "following chae ( 2002 ) , we further ignore the dependence of the differential number - flux density relation on the spectral index of the source .    finally , we emphasize that two important selection criteria for class statistical sample are ( i ) that the ratio of the flux densities of the fainter to the brighter images @xmath124 is @xmath125 .",
    "given such an observational limit , the minimum total magnification for double imaging for the adopted model of the lens is @xmath126 ; ( ii ) that the image components in lens systems must have separations @xmath127   arcsec .",
    "we incorporate this selection criterion by setting the lower limit of @xmath110 in equation ( [ prob ] ) as @xmath128 arcsec .",
    "we perform a maximum - likelihood analysis to determine the confidence levels in the @xmath129 space .",
    "the likelihood function is defined by @xmath130 where @xmath131 is the observed number of multiple - imaged lensed radio sources and @xmath132 is the number of unlensed sources in the adopted sample .",

    "this best - fit scenario also corresponds to a @xmath147-gyr - old universe ( @xmath51 ) and provides an universe old enough to accommodate some recent age estimates of high-@xmath108 objects .",

    "the possibility of an accelerating universe from distance measurements of type ia supernovae constitutes one of the most important results of modern cosmology .",

    "<S> the existence of a dark energy component has usually been invoked as the most plausible way to explain the recent observational results . </S>",
    "<S> however , it is also well known that effects arising from new physics ( e.g. , extra dimensions ) can mimic the gravitational effects of a dark energy through a modification of the friedmann equation . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we investigate some observational consequences of a flat , matter dominated and accelerating / decelerating scenario in which this modification is given by @xmath0 where @xmath1 is a new function of the energy density @xmath2 , the so - called generalized cardassian models . </S>",
    "<S> we mainly focus our attention on the constraints from the recent cosmic all sky survey ( class ) lensing sample on the parameters @xmath3 and @xmath4 that fully characterize the models . </S>",
    "<S> we show that , for a large interval of the @xmath5 parametric space , these models are in agreement with the current gravitational lenses data . </S>",
    "<S> the influence of these parameters on the acceleration redshift , i.e. , the redshift at which the universe begins to accelerate , and on the age of the universe at high - redshift is also discussed . </S>"
