    "one of the most important physical properties characterizing a type - ii superconductor is its transport critical current @xmath12 .",
    "when the current @xmath13 in a superconducting strip exceeds @xmath12 , a voltage appears along the length ; this voltage is due to the motion of vortices or antivortices across the strip . applying a magnetic induction @xmath14 perpendicular to the current generally decreases @xmath12 , and another important physical property is the strength of the field dependence of @xmath15 vs @xmath14 .",
    "for applications it is of course desirable that this field dependence be as weak as possible , so that @xmath12 remains large in high fields . in low applied fields ,",

    "according to critical - state theory in the mixed state of type - ii superconductors,@xcite at the critical current of a superconducting strip the magnitude of the current density @xmath41 in a region containing vortices is locally equal to the critical depinning current density @xmath42 .",
    "@xmath42 characterizes the bulk pinning force per unit length @xmath43 on a vortex but is defined to have dimensions of current density : @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the superconducting flux quantum . on the other hand , the actual current density ( averaged over a few intervortex spacings )",
    "is @xmath46 , and it is this current density that enters into the biot - savart expression from which the self - field contribution to @xmath47 can be calculated throughout all space .",
    "depending upon the magnitude of @xmath33 , the magnetic - flux - density and current - density distributions in a superconducting strip can be surprising complicated because of the influence of geometrical edge barriers , bean - livingston surface barriers , or surface - barrier effects.@xcite    for small @xmath33 , the self - field critical current of a superconducting strip is determined entirely by the geometrical edge barrier . for a sample in the meissner state subjected to an increasing current @xmath13 in the @xmath16 direction in the absence of a perpendicular applied field , the current density in the strip averaged over the thickness is@xcite @xmath48 and the @xmath20 component of the self - field in the plane @xmath49 is@xcite @xmath50 to good approximation except within about @xmath51 of the edges at @xmath52 .",
    "irreversible vortex penetration occurs and the critical current is reached when @xmath53 first reaches the barrier - penetration field @xmath54 . in the absence of a bean - livingston barrier , @xmath55 , the lower critical field , but in the presence of a bean - livingston barrier , @xmath54 may be much larger , even approaching the bulk thermodynamic critical field @xmath56.@xcite however , the value of @xmath54 and the process by which irreversible penetration first occurs depend sensitively upon the local structure of the edge.@xcite the edge - barrier critical current in zero external magnetic field @xmath57 can be estimated by evaluating eq .",

    "when the current @xmath13 rises slightly above @xmath57 , vortices and antivortices nucleate on opposite sides of the strip and then experience a lorentz driving force per unit length of magnitude @xmath63 , which is sharply peaked at the edges and reaches a minimum at the center of the strip [ see eq.([jzmeissner ] ) ] .",
    "let us consider the case for which the bulk - pinning current density @xmath33 is independent of @xmath64 ( the bean - london model@xcite ) .",
    "when @xmath33 is less than @xmath65 , the driving forces exceed the bulk - pinning forces for all @xmath18 , and the nucleated vortices and antivortices are driven towards each other until they annihilate .",
    "we therefore see that the self - field critical current @xmath12 of the strip is governed entirely by the edge barrier , i.e. , @xmath66 , independent of the bulk - pinning @xmath33 , when the ratio @xmath67 is less than @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is defined to be the bulk - pinning critical current in the absence of the edge barrier .    for larger values of @xmath33 ,",
    "i.e. , for @xmath70 , the critical current @xmath12 of the strip ( where a voltage first appears along the length ) is larger than the current @xmath57 when vortices are first nucleated .",
    "as the current @xmath13 slightly exceeds @xmath57 , the large screening currents near the sample edges drive nucleating vortices and antivortices toward the center of the strip , but they stop where @xmath71 . as shown in ref .  , further increases of the current produce metastable magnetic - flux distributions initially characterized by five zones .",

    "applied field when @xmath78 is just above @xmath68 , the state of the strip when @xmath13 is barely above the critical current @xmath12 therefore can be described qualitatively in terms of four zones as follows : vortices and antivortices nucleate at opposite edges of the strip , where the magnitude of the local magnetic field is equal to @xmath54 .",
    "once nucleated , vortices ( antivortices ) move rapidly to the left ( right ) through otherwise vortex - free zones near the strip edges where the supercurrent density @xmath77 exceeds the bulk zero - field depinning critical current density @xmath33 .",
    "the vortices ( antivortices ) then enter a vortex - filled zone on the right ( left ) side of the centerline , where the magnetic flux density @xmath79 ( @xmath80 ) and the local critical current density @xmath77 is just barely above the depinning critical current density @xmath33 .",

    "the vortex - free zones at @xmath82 become narrower , and they shrink to zero width when the magnitude of the @xmath33-generated self - field at the sample edges becomes equal to @xmath54 .",
