    "curvature can be expressed both in metric and combinatorial terms .",
    "metrically , one can refer to nonpositively curved ( respectively , negatively curved ) metric spaces in the sense of aleksandrov , i.e. by comparing small triangles in the space with triangles in the euclidean plane ( hyperbolic plane ) .",
    "these are the cat(0 ) ( respectively , cat(-1 ) ) spaces .",
    "combinatorially , one looks for local combinatorial conditions implying some global features typical for nonpositively curved metric spaces .    a very important combinatorial condition of this type was formulated by gromov @xcite for cubical complexes , i.e.  cellular complexes with cells being cubes .",
    "namely , simply connected cubical complexes with links ( that can be thought as small spheres around vertices ) being flag ( respectively , @xmath2large , i.e.  flag - no - square ) simplicial complexes carry a canonical cat(0 ) ( respectively , cat(-1 ) ) metric .",
    "another important local combinatorial condition is local @xmath3largeness , introduced by januszkiewicz- ' swiatkowski @xcite and haglund @xcite .",
    "a flag simplicial complex is _ locally @xmath3large _ if its links do not contain ` essential ' loops of length less than @xmath3 . in particular , simply connected locally @xmath4large simplicial complexes , i.e.  _ @xmath4systolic _ complexes , are gromov hyperbolic @xcite .",
    "the theory of _",
    "@xmath4systolic groups _ , that is groups acting geometrically on @xmath4systolic complexes , allowed to provide important examples of highly dimensional gromov hyperbolic groups @xcite .",
    "however , for groups acting geometrically on cat(-1 ) cubical complexes or on @xmath4systolic complexes , some very restrictive limitations are known .",
    "for example , @xmath4systolic groups are in a sense ` asymptotically hereditarily aspherical ' , i.e.  asymptotically they can not contain essential spheres .",
    "this yields in particular that such groups are not fundamental groups of negatively curved manifolds of dimension above two ; see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "this rises need for other combinatorial conditions , not imposing restrictions as above . in @xcite",
    "some conditions of this type are studied  they form a way of unifying cat(0 ) cubical and systolic theories . on the other hand , osajda @xcite introduced a local combinatorial condition of _ @xmath1location _ , and used it to provide a new solution to thurston s problem about hyperbolicity of some @xmath5manifolds .    in @xcite a systematic study of a version of @xmath1location , suggested in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* subsection 5.1 ) , is undertaken .",
    "this version is in a sense more natural than the original one ( tailored to thurston s problem ) , and none of them is implied by the other .",
    "however , in the new @xmath1location essential @xmath6loops are allowed .",
    "this suggests that it can be used in a much wider context .",
    "roughly ( see section @xmath7 for the precise definition ) , the new @xmath1location says that essential loops of length at most @xmath1 admit filling diagrams with at most one internal vertex . in @xcite ( theorem @xmath8 ) it is shown that this local combinatorial condition is a negative - curvature - type condition , by proving that simply connected , @xmath1located simplicial complexes are gromov hyperbolic . in the current paper",
    "we give an application to this result .",
    "namely , we introduce another combinatorial curvature condition , called the @xmath0-condition , and we show that the complexes which satisfy it , are also gromov hyperbolic .",
    "our proof relies on the minimal filling diagrams lemma for @xmath0-complexes .",
    "we prove that the disc in the diagram associated to a cycle in a simply connected @xmath0-complex is itself a @xmath0-complex ( lemma @xmath9 ) .",
    "further we show that a disc satisfying the @xmath0-condition , is @xmath10located ( lemma @xmath11 ) .",
    "therefore the @xmath0-complex itself is @xmath1-located and hence , by @xcite , theorem @xmath8 , gromov hyperbolic ( theorem @xmath12 ) .",
    "our proof for the minimal filling diagram lemma is similar to the one given for the systolic case in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the paper s main result is already mentioned without proof in @xcite ( section @xmath13 ) as an application concerning some weakly systolic complexes and groups . because the @xmath0-condition implies the hyperbolicity of weakly systolic complexes , it is more general than the well studied conditions for hyperbolicity : local @xmath4-largeness for @xmath4-systolic complexes ( see @xcite , section @xmath7 ) , and sd@xmath14(7 ) for weakly systolic complexes ( see @xcite , section @xmath4 ) .    * acknowledgements .",
