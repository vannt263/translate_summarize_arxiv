    "there are basically two methods to determine the weak axial form factor of the nucleon .",

    "vector meson exchange contributions in the @xmath202-channel were found to play a negligible role in the charged pion channel .    due to cancellations between higher partial waves and interference terms with the @xmath199-wave , @xmath184 is predominantly sensitive to the @xmath206 amplitude and therefore to @xmath17 .",
    "on the other hand , the pion charge form factor appears in the longitudinal amplitude @xmath207 only at order @xmath208 , and the @xmath199-wave contribution to @xmath185 amounts to @xmath209 only . due to the contributions of the higher partial waves , however , the longitudinal cross section @xmath185 is quite sensitive to @xmath210 , which is a bonus ` by - product ' of the analysis .",
    "since current conservation is violated if arbitrary form factors are included , gauge invariance was imposed by additional gauge terms in the hadronic current .",
    "these terms modify the longitudinal part of the cross section and therefore influence the pion pole term and thus the extracted value of @xmath210 .",
    "however , this procedure does not affect the transverse part of the cross section .",
    "the axial mass can then be determined from the @xmath5-dependence of @xmath184 , and the result can be compared to the prediction of @xmath35 . in the theoretical fit ,",
    "the transverse part is fitted first .",
    "we have used two different techniques to determine the axial mass :    \\(i ) only the axial mass was varied , whereas the value of @xmath184 at @xmath211 was fixed by extrapolating the transverse cross section ( i.  e.  the @xmath206 amplitude ) to the value of the photoproduction angular distribution at @xmath212 .",
    "a precise cross section at the photon point ( @xmath211 ) is very helpful for our analysis and can reduce the uncertainty in determining the axial mass considerably .",
    "unfortunately , there are no experimental data available around @xmath1 and forward angles . the only measurements in this energy region are performed at pion angles larger than @xmath213 with large deviations among the different data sets .",
    "therefore we have used a value at the photon point obtained from different partial - wave analyses of the vpi group @xcite and of the mainz dispersion analysis @xcite .",
    "this yields to a weighted - average cross section at the photon point of @xmath195 and this value was used as an additional data point .",
    "the corresponding value of @xmath206 is also well supported by the studies of the gdh sum rule @xcite and by the low energy theorem ( kroll - ruderman limit ) .",
    "\\(ii ) the three data points alone were fitted , while the value of the transverse cross section at @xmath211 was taken as an additional parameter , with the result @xmath214 .    the best - fit parameters for the transverse cross section",
    "were then used to fit the longitudinal part .    using the first and preferred procedure",
    ", we find from the transverse cross section @xmath6 , corresponding to @xmath215 . from the longitudinal part",
    ", we obtain @xmath216 , corresponding to @xmath217 .",
    "the second procedure leads to the following results : @xmath218 or @xmath219 , and @xmath220 or @xmath221 .",
    "we have measured the electroproduction of positive pions on protons at the invariant mass of @xmath1 , and at four - momentum transfers of @xmath222 and @xmath4 . in conjunction with our previous measurement at @xmath223 @xcite , we were then able to study the @xmath5-dependence of the transverse and longitudinal cross sections , separated by the rosenbluth technique for each @xmath5 .",
    "the statistical uncertainties were between @xmath224 and @xmath225 , an improvement of an order of magnitude over the result of ref .",
    "the systematical uncertainties were estimated to be between @xmath226 and @xmath227 , and are expected to decrease significantly in the future experiments .",
    "we have extracted the axial mass parameter @xmath17 of the nucleon axial form factor from our pion electroproduction data using an effective lagrangian model with pseudovector @xmath198 coupling .",
    "our extracted value of @xmath6 is @xmath7 larger than the axial mass @xmath228 known from neutrino scattering experiments .",
    "our result essentially confirms with the scaled - error weighted average @xmath229 of older pion electroproduction experiments .",
    "if we include our value into the database , the weighted average increases to @xmath24 , and the ` axial mass discrepancy ' becomes @xmath230 .",
    "this value of @xmath42 is in agreement with the prediction derived from @xmath35 , @xmath231 .",
    "we conclude that the puzzle of seemingly different axial radii as extracted from pion electroproduction and neutrino scattering can be resolved by pion loop corrections to the former process , and that the size of the predicted corrections is confirmed by our experiment .",
    "theoretical input needed to extract the axial mass and the pion radius has naturally led to some model dependence of the results .",
    "the dominant contribution to pion electroproduction at @xmath1 is due to the born terms .",
    "these are based on very fundamental grounds and the couplings are very well known . for our purpose",
    "the electric and magnetic form factors of the nucleons are also accurately known whereas the remaining two ( the axial and the pion form factors ) are the subjects of our analysis . in parallel kinematics",
    "we are in the ideal situation where the pion form factor contributes only to the longitudinal cross section , therefore reducing very strongly the model dependence of the transverse cross section and consequently of the determination of the axial mass .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath205 resonance , which plays the second important role in our theoretical description , also contributes with a well - known m1 excitation to the transverse cross section , while the longitudinal c2 excitation gives rise to a larger uncertainty due to the less known c2 form factor , currently under investigation at different laboratories .",
    "altogether , the model dependence is smaller for extracting the axial mass than for the pion radius .",
    "this could partly explain the discrepancy in the different values of the pion radius between our analysis and the analysis of pion scattering off atomic electrons @xcite .",
    "however , as in the case of the axial mass , an additional correction of the pion radius obtained from electroproduction experiments is very likely . this should be investigated in future studies of chiral perturbation theory .",
