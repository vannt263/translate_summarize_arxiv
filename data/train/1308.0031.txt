    "one of the most studied pulsars , vela , quasi - periodically produces large glitches @xmath9 @xcite ; the relatively large number of glitches observed from vela ( 21 ) has made it a test - bed for proposed glitch mechanisms .",
    "much effort has been devoted to examining two - component glitch models , in which one component of the neutron star is for most of the time decoupled from the solid crustal lattice to which the magnetic field lines are anchored and whose rotational evolution we directly observe .",
    "this decoupled component acts as an angular momentum reservoir , and occasionally re - couples to the rest of the star , transferring some of its angular momentum and spinning the star up @xcite .",
    "the most studied class of two - component models posit that the angular momentum reservoir consists of the free superfluid neutrons that permeate the inner crust .",
    "the mechanism by which they are decoupled from the core , and periodically recoupled , is still a matter of considerable uncertainty owing to the difficulty in marrying the complex microphysics with the global rotational dynamics of the fluid components . in the pinning paradigm ,",
    "the neutron superfluid vortices in the crust could interact with the lattice of nuclei to become ` pinned ' to the crust @xcite , therefore preventing them from moving radially outwards from the rotation axis in response to the secular spin - down of the star @xcite .",
    "they thus become decoupled from the rotational evolution of the charged component of the crust and that part of the core that couples strongly to it . as a lag builds up between the angular frequency of the charged component ( that which we observe ) and the frequency of the crustal superfluid",
    ", the magnus force acting radially outwards on the vortices grows , until eventually it overcomes the pinning force , and the vortices unpin _ en masse _ and couple to the charged component , transferring angular momentum . despite recent advances in combining the microphysics and hydrodynamics of this model @xcite certain aspects of the model such as the exact unpinning trigger and a convincing account of the process by which a large number of vortices subsequently moves remain to be addressed @xcite .",
    "in addition , it is possible that pinning of neutron vortices occurs elsewhere in the star @xcite , or that at least some glitches arise by other means such as hydrodynamical instabilities and turbulence @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we consider the class of models in which the free inner crustal neutrons are the component which acts as the effective angular momentum reservoir . on",
    "can analyze the tenability of these models in general terms relatively free of the uncertainties outlined above .",
    "the observed glitch activity of the vela pulsar can be used to infer the fractional moment of inertia of the angular momentum reservoir @xmath10 compared to that of the portion of the star it couples to at the time of glitch , @xmath11 ( which we shall referred to as the charged component of the star ) , @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "this is the most stringent constraint from any pulsar , with the next largest glitch activity observed coming from psr j0537 - 6910 @xmath13 @xcite from which we have observed the most glitches of any pulsar .",
    "assuming an upper limit to the moment of inertia of the angular momentum reservoir to be that of the entire crustal neutron superfluid @xmath14 , and that the charged component it couples to is essentially the whole star @xmath15 ( i.e. the entire core couples to the charged component of the crust on glitch - rise timescales ) , many realistic neutron star ( ns ) equations of state ( eoss ) can satisfy the condition @xmath12 , and constraints can be placed on the ns eos @xcite .",
    "however , recent calculations of the strength of the entrainment of superfluid neutrons by the crustal lattice via bragg scattering suggest that only a fraction of the crustal neutrons are effectively free , and consequently the upper limit to the moment of inertia of the angular momentum reservoir is reduced : @xmath16 .",
    "initial analyses suggested that makes @xmath17 too small to explain the observed glitch sizes @xcite , and suggests one must at least involve other components of the star in addition to the crust superfluid as the store of angular momentum .",

    "more recently , however , analyses using a wider range of possible equations - of - state ( eoss ) suggest that a crustal angular momentum reservoir might still be consistent with vela glitch observations @xcite .    however , estimates of the crust - core coupling timescales due to interactions of neutron vortices with core protons ( which may form a type i or type ii superconductor ) @xcite raise the possibility of only a small fraction of the core neutrons being coupled to the crust on the glitch rise timescale @xmath19s @xcite . therefore it is possible that @xmath20 , allowing the ratio @xmath17 to satisfy the lower bound of 1.6% again with only crustal superfluid neutrons involved for a wider range of eoss .    the aim of this paper is to examine the range of predictions for @xmath21 taking into account systematically variations in the most uncertain nuclear matter parameters over their experimentally and theoretically constrained ranges , and crustal entrainment in a way that is consistent with the crust models using the recently calculated values in @xcite .",

    "@xcite arrived at the conclusion that the crust neutrons can drive large enough glitches for moderate values of @xmath12170 mev .",
    "the core eoss used in that work are derived using families of parameterizations of relativistic - mean field models ; in our work , we use a parameterization of the non - relativistic skyrme model that is fit at first to a particular parameterization of one such rmf model , and therefore reproduces its predicted observables .",
    "both rmf and skyrme models contain two purely isovector parameters - that is , two parameters whose adjustment affects only predictions of observables sensitive to neutron - proton asymmetries .",
    "starting from our baseline parameterization , skiufsu we re - fit both purely isovector parameters in order to match the results of low - density pure neutron matter ( pnm ) calculations @xcite ( which we emphasize are expected to be quite robust . ) .",
    "subseqeuntly , we vary @xmath0 by adjusting one of the isovector parameters , while adjusting the second to maintain our fit to the pnm calculations .",
    "the study of @xcite starts from a number of baseline rmf parameterizations , all the results of fits to slightly different sets of experimental data as well as , in the case of the one model that satisfies the vela glitch activity , a hypothetical neutron skin measurement on @xmath129pb .",
    "subsequently , only one of the two isovector parameters is adjusted ( an adjustment which is tracked by the resulting change in the neutron skin thickness of @xmath129pb ) in order to find the value that gives the highest value of the crust - core transition pressure @xmath130 and hence the best chance of reproducing the vela glitch activity .",
    "the second isovector parameter remains fixed during this .",
    "there is no comparison with the low density pnm eos , but such a procedure will result only in accidental agreement with the results of pnm calculations .",
    "the matching to pnm matter becomes particularly important when we consider the second main difference between the work of @xcite and that presented here .",
    "we use a model of the inner crust composition and eos , and crust - core transition pressure , that is fully consistent with the core eos in that it is derived from the same underlying skyrme model .",
    "the key component of the inner crust eos in these studies is the low - density neutron fluid in the interstices of the crustal lattice ; it is therefore important to use our best knowledge of the low - density pnm eos when constructing such models , and ensure it is free of artifacts ( such as , for example , bound neutron matter ) .",
    "the work of @xcite , while calculating the crust - core transition pressure consistently , uses a polytropic eos for the inner crust , which is matched onto the core eos ; such an eos will necessarily be inconsistent from a nuclear physics point of view with the core eos , and any low - density artifacts that may arise in their eoss as a result of ignoring the low - density eos in pnm matter will remain hidden . without a direct comparison with their models , we can not comment on",
    "what difference this will make on the predictions of the crustal moment of inertia .    the second study to conduct a systematic exploration of eos parameter space @xcite does use the results of low - density pnm matter calculations to parameterize the low - density eoss used ; they also use the same crustal eoss as used here .",
    "nevertheless , they do find a small portion of parameter space consistent with vela glitch activity at moderate values of @xmath131mev .",
    "the reason lies in the high density eos , which are polytropes in that work .",
    "the models which are compatible with vela s glitch activity have particularly stiff eoss in the higher density regions of the core , giving rise to much larger radii and hence crustal thicknesses and moments of inertia .",
    "such stiff eoss at high density predict high radii for 1.4@xmath2 neutron stars , in excess of 14 km , and can therefore be tested by future radius measurements . in our work ,",
    "we use the same eos at high densities and low densities , and only append a polytrope at the highest densities when we need to stiffen the eos sufficiently to reproduce a 2@xmath2 neutron star .",
    "therefore , the higher and lower density regions are more strongly correlated , and we lack much freedom to vary the high density eos independently of the low density component .",
    "our high density eos is nevertheless based on a microphysical model , which is lacking from a simple polytropic description .",
    "more work needs to be done on exploring the high - density eos parameter space on a microscopic footing , given is current uncertainty both theoretically and experimentally @xcite , even if one restricts the composition to purely nucleonic matter .    even taking into account pure neutron matter calculations , there is sufficient uncertainty in the remaining parameters of the nuclear model underlying the eos to cause uncertainties of @xmath12610% in the crust - core transition density and pressure @xcite . to allow for this uncertainty ,",
    "we examine how much the crust - core transition density would have to be increased in order to match the observations . in the range @xmath12130 - 60",
    "mev we find an increase of @xmath1320.01@xmath70 is required , which is of order the eos model uncertainties .",
    "thus we must conclude that for the baseline model , it is still marginally possible to match the vela glitch activity using crust neutrons with eoss that are also consistent with nuclear experiment _ and _ the results of low density pure neutron matter calculations .",
    "one can also interpret the increase in density @xmath125 as allowing for the participation of core neutrons in the glitch mechanism , in which , given the set of eos parameters used here , we set a lower limit @xmath1330.01@xmath70 on the density above the crust - core transition that this participation must occur ( although this assumes that the participating core neutrons must be contiguous with the crust neutrons , which need not be the case ) .",
    "we explore the effect of reducing and increasing entrainment for 50% . for reduced entrainment ,",
    "we require @xmath13475 mev for @xmath1 = 1.0 , @xmath100=1.4@xmath2 . for enhanced entrainment , we require @xmath134115 mev .",
    "we have noted that increasing entrainment by 50% ( which is equivalent to increasing the neutron effective masses in the crust by 50% ) does not greatly increase the problem of matching the vela results ; an increase in density @xmath1320.01@xmath70 would still provide enough neutrons to allow for such agreement .",
    "we also consider lower and higher mass stars .",
    "if vela is a high mass neutron star @xmath100=1.8@xmath2 , then we can not match the observed glitch activity for any eoss considered for @xmath1350.5 for full strength entrainment @xmath127 .",
    "allowing for only a fraction of the core neutrons to be coupled to the crust at the time of the glitch , we find that for consistency with experiment @xmath13660 mev and for a 1.4@xmath2 star , we require @xmath1370.5 for @xmath56=1.0 , @xmath1370.7 for @xmath138 and @xmath1370.4 for @xmath108 . for a 1.8@xmath2 , we would require @xmath1370.2 for @xmath56=1.0 , @xmath1370.3 for @xmath138 and @xmath1370.1 for @xmath108 .",
    "considering the crust - core coupling to be mediated by core mutual friction , @xmath1 can be related to the strength of mutual friction in the core via the crust - core coupling timescale @xcite and therefore , in principle , calculated consistently with the eos , thereby removing it as a free model parameter .",
    "this would be a possible next step in a microphysically - consistent analysis of glitch models , to be reported in an upcoming paper .",
    "note that the strength of mutual friction and hence @xmath1 will vary throughout the core as the composition and overall density changes .    to summarize , for a 1.4@xmath2 star and a fully coupled core",
    ", we require very stiff eoss to match glitch observations at odds with current experiment .",
    "these results are consistent with @xcite within the set of eoss used here constrained by pure neutron matter calculations .",
    "allowing for uncertainties in the crust - core transition pressure of order 10% would be sufficient to remove this problem ; alternatively , only a small amount of core neutrons need to be involved to alleviate the problem . if less than @xmath13940% of the core is coupled to the crust at the time of glitch , crust - originated glitches are possible for eoss consistent with experimental data and pure neutron matter calculations , even if the strength of crustal entrainment is increased to 50% above its predicted values .",
