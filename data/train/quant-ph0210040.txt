    "traditionally , streaming is referred as a localized mean flow caused by an acoustic source . this flow is created by the reynolds forces , non - zero time - averaged values of the quadratic acoustic terms arising in the equation of conservation of momentum .",
    "there exist extensive reviews on this subject [ 1 - 3 ] .",
    "steady acoustic streaming is described by the mean eulerian velocity @xmath0 , or the mean mass flow velocity @xmath1 , where @xmath1 is defined by @xmath2here , @xmath3 is a slow component of velocity , namely the eulerian velocity of the streaming , index @xmath4 labels acoustic wave , @xmath5 is undisturbed density .",
    "square brackets designate averaging over time whose interval is much shorter than the transient time of streaming and much longer than a period of a sound wave .",
    "it is pointed , that the difference between @xmath1 and @xmath3 is roughly proportional to the acoustic intensity vector and is small compared with any of mean velocities [ 4 ] . from the continuity equation",
    "it follows @xmath6 if we assume @xmath7 .",
    "the recent discussion of acoustic streaming [ 5,6 ] suggest that there is important unresolved issue concerning acoustic streaming , namely the effect of fluid incompressibility .",
    "the inconsistency of this point is that fluid is supposed to be incompressible while the acoustic wave casing streaming may propagate only over compressible medium .",
    "the next , the conservation of energy usually is not considered .",
    "it is reasonable since excluding of one variable ( density ) reduces an initial system .",
    "it has been proved that the effect of the heat conductivity could not be discarded in a study of temperature variation associated with the streaming [ 6 ] .",
    "actually , this approximation is well understood in a typical liquid like water but should be revised for other liquids [ 7 ] .",
    "that is a reason to start from the full system of conservation laws including the energy balance equation and the continuity equation .",
    "the procedure of the temporal averaging needs a continuous acoustic wave of many periods as a source , thus the well - known results on acoustic streaming apply only for this type of acoustic source though quite realistic .",
    "there are clear inconsistency concerning the very procedure of the temporal averaging .",
    "as it has been mentioned before , an equality @xmath6 is correct only if @xmath8 @xmath9 actually ,  the overall field includes not only acoustic and vortical modes , but also of the entropy mode .",
    "the entropy mode caused by acoustic wave is known as a slow decrease of density and  isobaric increase of temperature of the background of acoustic wave propagation .",
    "recently , the importance of change in density of surrounding ( not only increase in temperature ) was underlined in the review [ 8 ] .",
    "if nonlinear interactions are accounted in a proper way , for density of the entropy mode one gets an equation :    @xmath10 ,    where @xmath11 is shear viscosity , @xmath12 is an acoustic source proportional to a gradient of acoustic intensity , index @xmath13 concerns the entropy mode .",
    "an attenuation of acoustic wave leads to slow but continuous decrease of density so @xmath14 becomes incorrect as well as @xmath15 since @xmath16 therefore , if the acoustic heating caused by periodic acoustic wave is accounted , @xmath6 becomes incorrect .",
    "these inconsistencies call new ways to theoretical investigation of acoustic streaming , including streaming caused by non - periodic acoustic wave .",
    "we plan to start with all conservation equations for compressible thermoviscous flow , then to define modes by establishing of the relations between perturbations ( section 2 ) , to demonstrate how the well - known linear and nonlinear evolution equations may be obtained by projecting ( sections 3,4 ) , and , finally , to apply projectors to calculating of the streaming caused by pulse acoustic wave ( section 5 ) .",
    "the idea to decompose the linear flow into specific modes is not novel and has been exploited for a long time , see [ 9 ] and referred papers , where homogeneous background with sources of heat and mass are considered .",
    "the concrete ideas of doing it automatically by using of projectors in the wide variety of problems ( also flow over inhomogeneous media like bubbly liquid [ 10 ] , flows affected by external forces including the gravitational one which changes the background density and pressure [ 11 ] , both one- and multi - dimensional problems , see [ 12 ] ) .",
    "the principle advance is an expansion of the ideas into area of nonlinear flow : to get nonlinear coupled evolution equations for interacting modes and to solve the system approximately .",
    "the deriving of the final nonlinear system is algorithmic , one just acts by projectors at the initial system of nonlinear equations .",
    "some ideas concerning separation and interaction of acoustic - gravity and rossby waves may be found in [ 13 ] .",

    "it seems be suitable definition though the self - action is usually reserved for the phenomenon of acoustic heating when acoustic mode causes the entropy mode during its propagation thus changing the surrounding [ 8 ] .",
    "there are some reasons to find another approach to acoustic streaming .",
    "first , the procedure of temporal averaging is a basis of the modern theory of acoustic streaming and all corresponding results relate to averaged fields .",
    "all non - periodic acoustic sources thus are left of account .",
    "second , the problem of modes interaction looks more extended",
    ". actually there exist three types of independent modes .",
    "the initial amplitudes of these modes are determined by initial conditions of a concrete problems and may be evaluated by projecting of the overall initial field into every modal field .",
    "the acoustic streaming imposes an ability of predominate acoustic mode .",
    "the acoustic field causes slow varying with time flow which may grow with time since nonlinear effects can store , that is namely the acoustic streaming .",
    "so , the acoustic streaming relates to one type ( though important ) of possible nonlinear interactions in flow , namely to the beginning of acoustic mode evolution .",
    "later , an amplitude of the vortical mode ( and the entropy one also ) may become so large that one can not treat these modes as secondary and other approach for nonlinear interaction of modes should be developed .",
    "let us mark , that even traditional subdivision of overall flow into slow and quick components eliminates the entropy mode unclearly .",
    "it is also slow but essentially possesses non - zero density perturbation which slowly varies with time ( @xmath147 in linear approach ) , so the procedure of temporal averaging of continuity equation fails with storing of nonlinear effects .",
    "also , there are many more complicated flows over inhomogeneous media and/or with background flows that may be algorithmically solved by the pointed method , see conclusion .",
    "we will show , at first , that projecting results in the well - known equations for an acoustic streaming in terms of @xmath148 and , the second and more important , that there appear the new equations for acoustic streaming caused by impulse ( non - periodic ) acoustic signals .    to consider interactions of vortical and acoustic modes , one acts by projector @xmath149",
