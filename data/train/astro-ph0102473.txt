    "the study of the circumstellar material around intermediate mass pre - main sequence stars has received growing attention in recent years since it has been realized that most of these systems are surrounded by protoplanetary circumstellar disks similar to those found around low mass pre - main sequence stars ( see e.g. natta , grinin & mannings  @xcite ) .",
    "herbig  ae stars ( herbig  @xcite ; waters & waelkens  @xcite ) are particularly interesting because they share the same spectral type as the much older `` debris '' disk systems , such as @xmath7  pic or @xmath8  lyrae , of which they may be a preceding evolutionary stage ( mannings & sargent  @xcite ; @xcite ; mannings , koerner & sargent  @xcite ) .    ux  ori  type stars are intermediate mass pre - main sequence stars , mostly belonging to the herbig  ae class , that show large and irregular variability at optical wavelengths , characterized by sporadic , deep minima associated with increasing polarization .",
    "this behavior is generally believed to be due to variable line of sight extinction provided by dust clumps orbiting about the central star in a flattened structure seen almost edge on ( grinin et al .",
    "@xcite ; grinin  @xcite ; natta & whitney  @xcite ) .",
    "the optical spectra of these stars show transient absorption features similar to those observed in the `` debris '' disk system @xmath7  pic , and have similarly been interpreted as due to the infall of evaporating , comet - like bodies in star grazing orbits ( see the reviews by lagrange , backman & artymowicz  @xcite and natta et al",
    ".  @xcite ) .",
    "single dish and interferometric millimeter wavelength observations suggest that ux  ori  type stars are indeed surrounded by circumstellar material in a flattened structure rotating about the central star .",
    "the properties of these disks are similar to those of disks associated with t  tauri and other herbig  ae stars ( dutrey et al .",

    "@xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "natta & whitney  ( @xcite ) have shown that scattering of the stellar light by such disks can easily explain the polarization and colors typical of uxors in deep minima , provided that the disk inclination is in the range @xmath945@xmath10 to 70@xmath10 ( natta & whitney  @xcite ) . the disks in ux  ori  type systems are not directly responsible for the optical variability , which is caused by a sporadic increase of the optical depth along the line of sight , probably due to density inhomogeneities of matter within the flared disk atmosphere ( bertout  @xcite ) .",
    "recent millimeter interferometric observations of the class prototype ( ux  ori ) revealed that the circumstellar material is confined within a flattened structure ( a circumstellar disk ) ; the emission is characterized by a flat ( f@xmath11 ) spectral energy distribution up to 2.7  mm , suggesting that , if the millimeter emission is entirely due to the thermal emission from the dust grains within the disk , the disk is either optically thick at millimeter wavelengths or is composed of very large ( @xmath910  cm ) dust particles ( natta et al .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "similar results have been obtained for two other systems in the same class , ww  vul and cq  tau . in both cases",
    "the circumstellar material must be distributed in a disk as in the case of ux  ori ( natta et al .",
    "it is thus tempting to speculate that ux  ori  type systems are characterized by relatively evolved disks , possibly in the phase of grain growth and planetesimal formation .    in this paper",
    "we present the results of new interferometric 7 millimeter and centimeter ( 3.6 and 6  cm ) observations of the circumstellar material surrounding ux  ori and cq  tau .",
    "the other ux  ori  type system known to have a flat millimeter spectrum ( ww  vul ) was excluded from our sample because of sensitivity considerations ( it is the faintest source of the sample ) .",
    "the aim of these observations were two - fold : i ) to verify whether the flat millimeter wavelength spectral energy distribution extends up to 7  mm ; and ii ) to quantify , if any , the contribution to the millimeter emission due to possible free - free emission from an ionized wind . the free - free emission ,",
    "if present , will tend to flatten the observed millimeter spectral energy distribution .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows : in sect .",

    "[ sdisc ] we compare our observations with detailed disk models ; the implications of our results are discussed in sect .",
    "ux  ori and cq  tau were observed with the nrao vla in its most compact ( d ) configuration in september and october  2000 .",
    "the observing parameters are reported in table  [ tobs ] .",
    "each source was observed in the q - band ( 43.34  ghz , 0.7  cm ) , x - band ( 8.46  ghz , 3.6  cm ) and c - band ( 4.86  ghz , 6  cm ) , the latter observations were obtained at the same time as the q - band observations using all the antennas not equipped with 43  ghz receivers ( 6 for ux  ori and 5 for cq  tau ) . at high frequency",
    "we used a fast - switching observing cycle with total duration ranging from one to three minutes depending on the distance between the source and the chosen complex gain calibrator and on the elevation of the sources . at x- and c - band",
    "we used a standard observing sequence with @xmath95  min cycles between source and calibrator .",
    "hourly pointing at x - band on the calibrators were used to correct for pointing drifts during the q - band observations .",
    "the flux density scale was set by observing 3c286 and/or 3c48 , the calibration is expected to be accurate within 10 - 20% depending on the waveband , with the less accurate being the higher frequency band .",
    "all data editing and calibration has been performed using standard tasks within the nrao aips software package .",
    "self - calibration was not possible due to the faintness of the sources .",
    "all images presented here have been produced using the aips imagr task with natural weighting of the ( @xmath12 ) datasets .",
    "no correction for primary beam attenuation has been applied , unless differently noted . at 6  cm ,",
    "the image rms is higher than theoretical expectation by a factors of about 2 ( ux  ori ) and 5 ( cq  tau ) due to the very sparse @xmath13 coverage and the presence of strong confusing sources in the field of view far off the phase center .",
    "both sources were clearly detected at 7  mm . in figure  [ fcontmaps ]",
    "we show the 7  mm contour plots of the region surrounding the target stars . in table",
    "[ tres ] we report the properties of the 7  mm emission along with stellar parameters from the literature . for each source",
    "we report distance and spectral type of the target star from natta et al .",

    "@xcite ) .",
    "the millimeter emission is unresolved in ux  ori . in the case of cq  tau ,",
    "the 7  mm emission appears to be marginally resolved and elongated in the north - south direction ( see table  [ tres ] ) .",
    "we find consistent results , albeit with lower signal - to - noise , by fitting a gaussian on a slightly higher resolution image of cq  tau obtained using the `` robust '' weighting scheme available with the aips imagr task . assuming a circularly symmetric , geometrically thin disk , the measured inclination of the disk axis from the line of sight is 63@xmath15  deg , in excellent agreement with that predicted by the natta & whitney  ( @xcite ) models , who derive a value of 66  deg to explain the polarization of light during the deep optical emission minima .",
    "it is interesting to note that , based on co(21 ) interferometric observations , mannings & sargent  ( @xcite ) derive an upper limit to the size of the gaseous disk smaller than our 7  mm continuum observation , this difference may be due to a different surface brightness sensitivity",
    ". clearly higher resolution observations of both the gaseous and dust components are needed to confirm the exact disk geometry .",
    "there is no detection of either source at 3.6 and 6  cm . in the last two columns of table  [ tres ]",
    "the 3.6 and 6  cm upper limits ( 3@xmath16 ) at the 7  mm sources positions are given .",
    "there are , however , a few sources far from the stellar positions ( see fig .  [ fcontmaps ] ) .",
    "for the sake of completeness , in table  [ tother ] we report positions and fluxes of these sources , as well as the nvss counterpart name and integrated flux ( when found in the nvss catalogue , condon et al .",
    "following fomalont et al .",
    "( @xcite ) and windhorst et al .",
    "( @xcite ) we can estimate the number of expected background extragalactic radio sources in our fields : at 6  cm over a 200 square arcmin area we expect @xmath93 sources brighter than 0.5  mjy , while at 3.6  cm over 50 square arcmin , @xmath92.5 sources brighter than 0.1  mjy are expected .",
    "these predictions are in rough agreement with the number of centimeter sources we observed , and suggest that they may be extragalactic , which would also be consistent with the non - thermal spectral index of three of them ( see table  [ tother ] ) . in any case",
    ", none of these cm wavelength radio sources is directly related to our target stars and their circumstellar material and we will not discuss them further .      to obtain the millimeter spectrum of the circumstellar material surrounding our target stars , we combined our measurements with available millimeter interferometric and single dish continuum observations from natta et al .",
    "( @xcite ) and mannings & sargent  ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "we include both interferometric and single dish measurements and assume that the mm - wave emitting region is confined to a compact region around the star .",
    "this assumption is supported by the fact that the 1.3  mm single dish and interferometer fluxes are consistent with each other ( see also the discussion in natta et al .",
    "the cm - wavelength upper limits can be used to constrain the possible contribution of free - free emission to the flux measured at 7  mm .",
    "following mannings & sargent  ( @xcite ) and using the 3.6  cm upper limits reported in table  [ tres ] , the contribution to the 7  mm flux from an ionized stellar wind , with a spectral index 0.6 ( panagia & felli  @xcite ) , would be 0.24 and 0.2  mjy for ux  ori and cq  tau , respectively .",
    "this estimate of the upper limit for the free - free emission confirms the earlier conclusion that the millimeter wavelength emission in these systems is due to thermal dust emission with a very small ( if any ) contribution from ionized gas ( mannings & sargent  @xcite ; natta et al .",
    "@xcite ) .    in figure  [ fmmspec ]",
    "we show the results of power law fits ( f@xmath17 ) to the millimeter spectral energy distributions .",
    "the values of @xmath18 that we derive are rather low .",
    "the value @xmath19 in ux  ori , in particular , is among the lowest of those found for herbig  ae / be stars ( natta et al .",
    "@xcite ) and is significantly smaller than the average values found for t tauri stars ( dutrey et al .",
    "@xcite ) . in figure  [ fmmspec ]",
    "we also show the 7  mm flux of ux  ori with the maximum correction for free - free emission as calculated above .",
    "the point , shown as an open triangle , would still be consistent with the thermal dust emission fit we derive .",
    "for the cq  tau system , we obtain @xmath20 . in this case the maximum possible contribution from free - free emission to the 7  mm flux is so small ( @xmath21 ) that it is barely visible in the figure .",
    "these values of @xmath18 are not consistent with optically thin thermal emission from standard interstellar dust grains ( @xmath22 ; draine & lee  @xcite ) .",
    "this result is not uncommon for circumstellar disks around young stars and can be understood if the emission is optically thick or , alternatively , if grains in circumstellar disks have grown to sizes significantly larger than those of grains in the diffuse interstellar medium ( beckwith & sargent  @xcite ; pollack et al .",
    "@xcite ; natta et al .",
    "in fact , for grains with physical size larger than the observing wavelength , the emissivity is just the geometrical cross section , and a flat spectral index at millimeter wavelengths may be an indication of the presence of centimeter - size dust particles ( `` pebbles '' ) .",
    "we will discuss these possibilities in detail for our target systems in the following section .",
    "the spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of herbig ae stars in general , and of ux  ori and cq  tau in particular , can be explained reasonably well by disk models which take into account the vertical temperature gradient caused by the stellar radiation impinging on the disk surface ( natta et al .",
    "@xcite ; chiang et al .",
    "@xcite ) . in these models ,",
    "the dust features , such as the 10 @xmath23 m emission feature , and the mid - infrared continuum originate in the hotter optically thin surface layers of the disk ( the disk atmosphere ) , while the emission at longer wavelengths is due to dust in the cooler disk midplane . using the simple two - layer approximation developed by chiang & goldreich  ( @xcite ) natta et al .",
    "( @xcite , @xcite ) found that herbig ae disks are in hydrostatic equilibrium ( flared disks ; kenyon & hartmann  @xcite ) .",
    "the grains in the disk atmosphere are a mixture of amorphous silicates and some other material , possibly carbonaceous grains or metallic iron , which dominate the opacity in the uv .",
    "these atmospheric grains can not be much larger than @xmath91 @xmath23 m . in the disk midplane grains are probably much larger .",
    "the properties of the grains in the disk midplane can only be studied at millimeter wavelengths , where the emission in many objects becomes optically thin .",
    "its dependence on wavelength reflects the way dust opacity depends on @xmath24 , and may tell us about the grain size .",
    "however , optical depth effects may still be important even at 1.3  mm .",
    "as discussed in natta et al .",
    "( @xcite ) for ux  ori , both an optically thin disk where grains have grown to very large size (  pebbles \" ) and a small disk , optically thick in the millimeter , have spectral index @xmath25 and may fit equally well the observed sed at all wavelengths . as we will see in the following ,",
    "the new 7  mm data presented in this paper allow us to clarify the issue , even if they are still not sufficient for deciding it .    to this purpose",
    ", we have computed a large grid of models for both ux  ori and cq  tau following chiang & goldreich  ( @xcite ) and natta et al .",
    "( @xcite ) . for each model",
    ", we fix the stellar parameters as in table  [ tres ] , and take the values of the inclination to the line of sight of 60@xmath10 and 66@xmath10 for ux  ori and cq  tau respectively , as derived by natta & whitney  ( @xcite ) .",
    "we vary the disk outer radius @xmath26 and the surface density profile , defined as : @xmath27 where @xmath28 is a reference radius . both @xmath29 and @xmath30",
    "are varied over a wide range of values .",
    "the disk mass @xmath31 is uniquely determined once @xmath30 , @xmath29 and @xmath26 are fixed . since we are interested in the disk emission at long wavelengths , the results do not depend on the disk inner radius .",
    "we describe the opacity of the dust in the disk midplane as a power - law function of wavelength with exponent @xmath7 : @xmath32 the long - wavelength flux depends on the properties of dust in the atmosphere only if and when the disk midplane is optically thin ( to its own radiation ) .",
    "we choose dust properties for the grains in the disk atmosphere as in natta et al .",
    "( @xcite ) ; any other choice that fits the seds at shorter wavelengths would not affect our conclusions significantly .",
    "these `` toy '' models are very simplified and can be questioned on a variety of grounds ( see e.g. dullemond  @xcite ) .",
    "however , they are very useful for the general understanding of the implications of our millimetric observations .      the results for ux  ori are shown in fig",

    "we find that grains with @xmath46 between 1.3 and 7  mm have radii of about 10  cm ; their opacity is very low , of order of @xmath47 @xmath48 g@xmath49 ( this is the _ dust _ only mass opacity , assuming that the grains have a density of 3.5  g@xmath50 ; no correction has been applied for the gas to dust mass ratio ) .",

    "for these values of the opacity , the observed fluxes can only be reproduced by disks with a very massive dust component of about @xmath51  m@xmath52 , with little dependence on other disk parameters such as @xmath29 and @xmath26 .",

    "a 30 au disk can still scatter enough stellar light to reproduce the polarization and colors of the light during photometric minima ( natta & whitney  @xcite ) . in a pebble disk ,",
    "both the properties of the star at minima and the shape of the mid - infrared emission require the presence of rather small grains on the disk surface .",

    "<S> both stars are detected at 7  mm but not at longer wavelengths , which confirms that the millimeter emission is dominated by dust .    </S>",

    "<S> two different disk models can reproduce this property : i ) a physically small disk with optically thick emission , truncated at a radius about 30 au , or ii ) a massive ( @xmath2 ) disk mainly composed of dust particles grown to radii of 10  cm ( `` pebbles '' ) . </S>",
    "<S> the observations do not spatially resolve the 7  mm emission . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss implications of these two models and suggest observational tests that will discriminate between them .    </S>",
    "<S> the cq  tau system exhibits a spectral index in the millimeter range of @xmath3 , consistent with values commonly found for disks around pre - main - sequence stars . </S>",
    "<S> the observations marginally resolve the 7  mm emission as an elongated structure with full width at half maximum of @xmath4 ( @xmath5  au at 100  pc distance ) . </S>",
    "<S> the size and inclination of @xmath6 degrees ( implied by circular symmetry ) are consistent with flared disk models previously suggested to explain the optical colors and polarization properties . </S>"
