    "integrable wave equations play a key role in understanding numerous phenomena in science . in this connection ,",
    "understanding the long - time asymptotics of solutions is crucial . roughly speaking",
    ", the typical behavior is that any ( sufficiently fast ) decaying initial profile splits into a number of solitons plus a decaying dispersive part . this has been first observed numerically for the korteweg  de vries equation @xcite .",
    "corresponding asymptotic formulas were derived and justified with increasing level of rigor over the last thirty years . to date , the most powerful method for deriving such long - time asymptotics is the nonlinear steepest descent method from deift and zhou @xcite , which was inspired by earlier work of manakov @xcite and its @xcite .",
    "more on this method and its history can be found in the survey @xcite ; an expository introduction to this method for the korteweg  de vries equation can be found in @xcite .",
    "although this method has found to be applicable to a wide range of integrable wave equations , there are still some exceptions .",
    "the most notable one is the camassa  holm equation ,",
    "also known as the dispersive shallow water equation , @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the fluid velocity in the @xmath2 direction , @xmath3 is a constant related to the critical shallow water wave speed , and subscripts denote partial derivatives .",
    "it was first introduced by camassa and holm in @xcite and camassa et al .",
    "@xcite as a model for shallow water waves , but it actually already appeared earlier in a list by fuchssteiner and fokas @xcite .",
    "regarding the hydrodynamical relevance of this equation , let us also mention the more recent articles by johnson @xcite , ionescu - kruse @xcite as well as constantin and lannes @xcite .    while in the case @xmath4 there is an underlying rieman  hilbert problem which can be analyzed using the nonlinear steepest descent method @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , this breaks down in the limiting case @xmath5 . in this case",
    ", the solitons are no longer smooth but have a single peak and hence are also known as peakons .",
    "nevertheless , it was conjectured by mckean @xcite ( cf .",
    "also @xcite , @xcite ) that solutions split into a train of peakons , in accordance with earlier numerical observations by camassa et al .",
    "@xcite . however , apart from the multi - peakon case @xcite ( and some low - regularity solutions @xcite as well as for a simplified flow @xcite ) , this has been an open problem , resolved only recently by us in @xcite .",
    "the technical problem here stems from the fact that the underlying isospectral problem has purely discrete spectrum and hence it is no longer possible to set up the usual scattering theory .",
    "our approach in @xcite circumvented this shortcoming by a thorough investigation of the associated isospectral problem , which then allowed us to deduce long - time asymptotics .",
    "however , this approach has still some drawbacks .",
    "for example , it is not possible to obtain long - time asymptotics which hold uniformly in sectors .",
    "the aim of the present article is to propose a novel approach to such kind of problems , which seems to be more natural . in some sense",
    ", it can be thought of as a adaptation of the usual riemann",
    " hilbert problem approach .",
    "more precisely , we will replace the riemann ",
    "hilbert problem with a certain coupling problem for entire functions .",
    "consequently , we will investigate the asymptotic behavior of solutions to this problem under known behavior of the given data .    as a prototypical example",
    ", we will apply our results to derive long - time asymptotics for the dispersionless camassa ",
    "holm equation .",
    "however , we expect that this new technique will also work for other equations , whose underlying isospectral problem exhibits purely discrete spectrum . for example",
    ", it can immediately be applied to derive long - time asymptotics for corresponding equations in the whole camassa  holm hierarchy .",
    "while for the positive members of this hierarchy one gets qualitatively the same asymptotic picture , the situation is somewhat different for the negative ones ( including for instance the extended dym equation ) . although solutions of negative members of the camassa ",
    "holm hierarchy still split into a train of peakons , their speed will be proportional to the modulus of the corresponding eigenvalue .",
    "this causes the larger peakons to be the slower ones and the smaller peakons to be the faster ones , creating a qualitatively different picture .",
    "the purpose of this section is to introduce the notion of a _ coupling problem _ for entire functions . to this end , consider a fixed discrete set @xmath6 such that the sum @xmath7 is finite .",
    "it is well known that under this condition , the infinite product @xmath8 converges locally uniformly to an entire function of exponential type zero ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma 2.10.13 ) , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem  5.3 ) .",
    "furthermore , we introduce the quantities @xmath9 for each @xmath10 which are referred to as the _ coupling constants_.    a solution of the coupling problem with data @xmath11 is a pair of entire functions @xmath12 of exponential type zero such that the following three conditions are satisfied :    1 .",
    "coupling condition : @xmath13 2 .",
    "growth and positivity condition : @xmath14 3 .",
    "normalization condition : @xmath15    in order to be precise , if @xmath16 for some @xmath10 , then the coupling condition ( c ) in this definition has to be read as @xmath17 .",
    "the growth and positivity condition ( g ) means that the meromorphic function @xmath18 is a so - called herglotz ",
    "nevanlinna function , which satisfy certain growth restrictions ( to be seen from their integral representations ; ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter  6 ) , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter  5 ) ) .",
    "moreover , let us mention that since the residues of such a function are known to be nonpositive , condition ( g ) also requires the necessary presumption @xmath19 on the sign of all coupling constants which are finite .",
    "thus the coupling constants corresponding to the smallest ( in modulus ) positive and negative element of @xmath20 have to be nonnegative .",
    "the consecutive coupling constants then have to be alternating nonpositive and nonnegative .",
    "furthermore , the condition ( g ) also tells us that the zeros of the numerator and the denominator of the function in   are interlacing ( after cancelation ) ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem  27.2.1 ) .",
    "in particular , this guarantees that the sums @xmath21 are finite , where @xmath22 denote the sets of all ( necessarily simple ) zeros of the functions @xmath23 . as a consequence",
    ", these functions can be written as the canonical products @xmath24 bearing in mind the normalization condition ( n ) . finally , we mention the bounds @xmath25 upon roughly estimating   and employing the interlacing condition once more .",
    "the simplest case of a coupling problem prevails when the set @xmath20 consists of only one point . in this case",
    ", it is indeed possible to write down the solution explicitly in terms of the one single coupling constant .",
    "[ proponesol ] suppose that @xmath26 for some nonzero @xmath27 .",
    "if the coupling constant @xmath28 is not negative , then the coupling problem has a unique solution given by @xmath29    it is readily verified that the given polynomials are indeed a solution of the coupling problem .",
    "conversely , if @xmath30 is another solution , then @xmath31 for some @xmath32 with @xmath33 .",
    "moreover , we infer that @xmath34 in view of the herglotz ",
    "nevanlinna property ( more precisely , from the interlacing condition of the poles and zeros ) .",
    "lastly , the coupling condition ( c ) takes the form @xmath35 now if @xmath36 , then necessarily @xmath37",
    "since otherwise we get the contradiction @xmath38 consequently , we may express @xmath39 in terms of the coupling constant using the coupling condition . in much the same manner ,",
    "one may obtain the coefficients @xmath40 if @xmath41 and finally end up with @xmath42 in either case , which finishes the proof .",
    "note that there is no solution of the coupling problem in proposition  [ proponesol ] if the coupling constant is negative , since it would violate the positivity condition ( g ) .",
    "we shall now derive a general result on the asymptotic behavior of solutions to the coupling problem . therefore , let @xmath43 be a first - countable topological space ( that is",
    ", every point has a countable neighborhood basis ) and fix some @xmath44 .",
    "again , we denote with @xmath6 a discrete set such that the sum   is finite and define the entire function @xmath45 by  .",
    "moreover , for every @xmath46 we consider a set of coupling constants @xmath47 indexed by @xmath10 .",
    "[ thmaa ] suppose there is a partition @xmath48 of @xmath20 such that @xmath49 as @xmath50 for each @xmath51 and define the conjugated coupling constants by @xmath52 if the pairs @xmath53 are solutions of the coupling problem with data @xmath54 for every @xmath55 , then @xmath56 as @xmath50 , locally uniformly for all @xmath57 .    first consider a sequence @xmath58 , @xmath59 with @xmath60 as @xmath61 such that the entire functions @xmath62 converge locally uniformly as @xmath61 .",
    "the respective limits are entire functions of exponential type zero in view of   and will be denoted by @xmath63 . due to assumption   and the coupling condition , we conclude that @xmath64 for @xmath51 ( also observe that the quantities @xmath65 are uniformly bounded in @xmath46 ) . as a consequence , the meromorphic herglotz ",
    "nevanlinna function @xmath66 has only one pole and thus at most two zeros , which are necessarily simple .",
    "consequently , we may write ( keep in mind that these functions are of exponential type zero and that their zeros have genus zero ) @xmath67 where @xmath68 are polynomials such that @xmath69 has at most one zero , which is simple .",
    "moreover , the pair @xmath70 satisfies the coupling condition @xmath71 where the constant @xmath72 is given as the limit @xmath73 hereby note that the limit is nonnegative because of  . in view of proposition  [ proponesol ]",
    "we now may write down the polynomials @xmath68 explicitly and conclude that @xmath74 as @xmath61 , locally uniformly in @xmath57 . finally , from the very definition of the constants @xmath75 we may also rewrite this as @xmath76 as @xmath61 , locally uniformly in @xmath57 .",
    "finally , if the claim of the theorem was not true , then there would be a compact set @xmath77 and a subsequence @xmath58 , @xmath59 with @xmath60 as @xmath61 such that @xmath78 for all @xmath79 , @xmath59 and some @xmath80 .",
    "however , a compactness argument ( recall   and apply montel s theorem ) shows that there is a subsequence @xmath81 such that @xmath82 converges locally uniformly as @xmath83 . in view of the first part of the proof",
    ", this gives a contradiction to  .",
    "the assumptions in theorem  [ thmaa ] allow one of the coupling constants to be arbitrary .",
    "this will turn out to be crucial to obtain long - time asymptotics of the camassa ",
    "holm equation which are valid uniformly in sectors .",
    "however , in the case when all of the coupling constants are supposed to converge to zero or infinity , one obtains the following result .",
    "[ coraa ] suppose that we have @xmath84 as @xmath50 for every @xmath10 .",
    "if the pairs @xmath53 are solutions of the coupling problem with data @xmath54 for every @xmath55 , then @xmath85 as @xmath50 , locally uniformly for all @xmath57 .",
    "similarly to the first part of the proof of theorem  [ thmaa ] , one infers that @xmath86 as @xmath61 , locally uniformly for all @xmath57 as long as the functions @xmath62 are assumed to converge locally uniformly .",
    "in fact , this follows since the function in   is now known to have no poles at all .",
    "now the claim follows in much the same manner as in the second part of the proof of theorem  [ thmaa ] , invoking a compactness argument .",
    "as anticipated in the introduction , we will now demonstrate that our results provide a powerful tool to derive long - time asymptotics for the dispersionless camassa  hom equation . to this end , let @xmath87 be a solution of @xmath88 with decaying spatial asymptotics . to be precise",
    ", we will assume that the quantities @xmath89 are finite signed measure for each time @xmath90 .",
    "these conditions guarantee ( see ( * ? ? ? * theorem  3.1 ) ) that for every time @xmath90 and @xmath91 , there are unique solutions @xmath92 of the differential equation @xmath93 ( the prime denotes spatial differentiation ) with the spatial asymptotics",
    "@xmath94 in view of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem  4.1 ) , it is known that these solutions are real entire and of exponential type zero with respect to the spectral parameter .    now the importance of the spectral problems   lies in the well - known fact that their spectra are invariant under the camassa  holm flow , that is , they are the same for all times @xmath95 ( for example , we refer to ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section  2 ) , @xcite , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section  3 ) , ( * ? ? ? * theorem  5.1 ) ) .",
    "for this reason , we may simply denote the spectrum of   with @xmath20 , which is known to be real and purely discrete such that the sum @xmath96 is finite , in view of ( * ? ? ? * proposition  3.3 ) .",
    "the wronskian of our two solutions @xmath97 turns out to be independent of space @xmath98 and time @xmath95 .",
    "indeed , this function is the characteristic function of the spectral problem  , that is , @xmath99 in view of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* corollary  4.2 ) .    in order to point out the connection to the coupling problem for entire functions",
    ", one observes that the solutions @xmath100 and @xmath101 are linearly dependent for every eigenvalue @xmath10 and time @xmath90 .",
    "hence there is some nonzero real @xmath102 such that we may write @xmath103 the time evolution for these quantities is known to be given explicitly by @xmath104 more precisely , this follows from the well - known time evolution of the associated norming constants ( for example , see ( * ? ? ?",

    "* lemma  3.2 ) , @xmath105 where the dot denotes differentiation with respect to the spectral parameter .",
    "we have now collected all necessary ingredients to prove the announced long - time asymptotics for the solution @xmath87 of the camassa  holm equation .",
    "in fact , the proof of this result is almost immediate from the general results on asymptotic analysis for our coupling problem of entire functions derived in the previous section .",
