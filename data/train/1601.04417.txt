    ". basically we can not know inclination or ascending node of a planetary orbit by radial velocity measurements , and thus we can not discriminate between prograde and retrograde orbits observationally . @xcite and",

    "the hd 47366 system is similar to the case of the bd+20 2457 system .",
    "our dynamical analysis showed that the coplanar retrograde configuration for the hd 47366 system is stable in a wider range of orbital parameters including the eccentric ones which are unstable for prograde configuration ( see figure [ fig : orbitcalc ] ) .",
    "confirmation of the high eccentricity of the outer planet by continuous observations will strongly support the retrograde hypothesis for the hd 47366 system , though the formation mechanism of such a mutually - retrograde system is largely unknown . in any of the above cases ,",
    "the planetary orbits can be altered by close encounter of the planets in relatively short period of time , and thus more detailed dynamical modeling for the observed radial - velocity variations is necessary in order to provide a definitive orbital solution .",
    "the stellar and planetary parameters of hd 47366 system are similar to those of @xmath13 cet system ; two massive planets ( @xmath166 , @xmath167 ) , with periods of @xmath168 days and @xmath169 days and eccentricities of @xmath170 and @xmath171 orbit around a k giant star with a mass of 1.7 @xmath172 and a radius of 14.3@xmath173 @xcite .",

    "a much larger non - resonant stable region also exists in low - eccentricity parameter space , though it appears to be much farther from the best fit than the 2:1 resonant region .",
    "this is in contrast to the case of hd 47366 that low eccentricities of the planets are more plausible than 2:1 resonant configuration .",
    "another possible 2:1 resonant system around an evolved star is 24 sex , in which two massive planets ( @xmath175 , @xmath176 ) , with periods of @xmath177 days and @xmath178 days and eccentricities of @xmath179 and @xmath180 orbit around a g - type subgiant with a mass of 1.54@xmath172 and a radius of 4.9@xmath173 @xcite .",
    "the period ratio of the planets is the closest to 2 among the three systems .",
    "@xcite revealed that the best - fit orbit of the system is mutually crossing and it is only dynamically feasible if the planets are in 2:1 resonance that can protect them from close encounters .",
    "as described , all the above three systems are near the 2:1 resonance , but they show different properties in their orbital configuration . further analysis and comparison of the systems would help us understand dynamics of planetary systems in more detail .",
    "it is unknown why multi - giant - planet systems with small orbital separation are preferentially found around evolved intermediate - mass stars ( see figure [ period - ratio ] ) .",
    "it may be a primordial property of planets around intermediate - mass stars that could be an outcome of planet formation or an acquired one as a result of orbital evolution caused by stellar evolution ( stellar tide and mass loss ) of central stars . in the case of hd 47366 ,",
    "if the star is a helium - core burning star that has passed through the rgb tip ( see section [ stpara ] ) , the planetary orbits could have been migrated outward by @xmath181 ( @xmath80.1au ) during the rgb phase because of the effect of mass loss of the central star @xcite .",
    "however , the effect works for both of the two planets and thus it could not result in making the orbital separation smaller . the star might have harbored a third planet that was engulfed and possibly partially responsible for the current orbital configuration , though the star does not exhibit a possible signature of the planet engulfment such as an overabundance of lithium ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; @xcite obtained the lithium abundance of @xmath182 for hd 47366 suggesting that the star is an li - depleted giant .",
    "considering also that many of the systems with small orbital separation are found around less evolved subgiants , the effect of stellar evolution may be less significant compared to that of stellar mass .",
    "unfortunately the ongoing doppler planet searches can not clearly discriminate between the above two factors , stellar mass and stellar evolution , because the targets of the searches are at once evolved and intermediate - mass stars . investigating planets around intermediate - mass main - sequence stars or those around evolved low - mass ( @xmath183 ) stars",

    "<S> we report the detection of a double planetary system around the evolved intermediate - mass star hd 47366 from precise radial - velocity measurements at okayama astrophysical observatory , xinglong station , and australian astronomical observatory . </S>",
    "<S> the star is a k1 giant with a mass of 1.81@xmath0 , a radius of @xmath1 , and solar metallicity . </S>",
    "<S> the planetary system is composed of two giant planets with minimum mass of @xmath2 and @xmath3 , orbital period of @xmath4 d and @xmath5 d , and eccentricity of @xmath6 and @xmath7 , respectively , which are derived by a double keplerian orbital fit to the radial - velocity data . </S>",
    "<S> the system adds to the population of multi - giant - planet systems with relatively small orbital separations , which are preferentially found around evolved intermediate - mass stars . dynamical stability analysis for the system revealed , however , that the best - fit orbits are unstable in the case of a prograde configuration . </S>",
    "<S> the system could be stable if the planets were in 2:1 mean - motion resonance , but this is less likely considering the observed period ratio and eccentricity . a present possible scenario for the system </S>",
    "<S> is that both of the planets have nearly circular orbits , namely the eccentricity of the outer planet is less than @xmath80.15 , which is just within @xmath9 of the best - fit value , or the planets are in a mutually retrograde configuration with a mutual orbital inclination larger than 160@xmath10 . </S>"
