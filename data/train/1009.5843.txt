    "heavy flavor production in heavy ions collisions is an ideal probe to study the early time dynamics of these nuclear collisions .",
    "several theoretical studies predict @xcite a substantial enhancement of open charm production associated to deconfined parton matter relative to the case of a purely hadronic scenario without quark - gluon plasma formation .",
    "recent studies point out that the dynamics of heavy quarks is dominated by partonic interactions in a strongly coupled plasma modeled neither by hadronic interactions nor by color screening alone @xcite .",
    "therefore , these quarks are very relevant in the study of the initial state of the collision . owing to difficulties in reconstruct the @xmath0-mesons decay vertex , rhic experiments have measured open charmed quarks indirectly , via the semileptonic decay to nonphotonic electrons or muons @xcite @xcite . in the standard picture charm quarks",
    "are produced by initial gluon fusion and their production rates are expected to be well described by perturbative quantum chromodynamics ( pqcd ) at fixed order plus next - to - leading logarithms ( fonll ) @xcite .",
    "the suppression of single , nonphotonic electrons or muons at rhic is usually attributed to heavy - quark energy loss . as a charmed quark of energy @xmath1",
    "can not radiate gluons forming an angle below @xmath2 ( dead cone effect ) , it is expected that heavy quarks lose less energy than light quarks @xcite , but the suppression experimentally observed is similar .",
    "in fact , many calculations based on energy loss via hard scattering @xcite or via multiple soft collisions @xcite obtained less suppression than the experimental data when the beauty contribution is taken into account .",
    "similar results are obtained in evaluations based on medium interactions or collisional dissociation @xcite .",
    "however , it has been argued @xcite@xcite that under the assumption of an enhancement of the heavy - quark baryon - to - meson ratio , analogous to the case of the proton - to - pion and the @xmath3-to - kaon ratios measured in au - au collisions at rhic , it is possible to achieve a larger suppression of the nuclear modification factor .",
    "this is possible , because the heavy - quark mesons have a larger branching ratio to decay inclusively into electrons as compared to heavy - quark baryons and therefore , when the former are less copiously produced in a heavy - ion environment , the nuclear modified factor decreases , even in the absence of heavy - quark energy loss .",
    "indeed the single nonphotonic nuclear modified factor , @xmath4 can be expressed as @xcite @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the nuclear modified factor for d and @xmath7 , i.e. @xmath8 with @xmath9 and @xmath10 the produced @xmath0 and @xmath3 in @xmath11 or @xmath12 collisions and the @xmath13 is the number of collisions at a given centrality .",
    "the factor @xmath14 is given by the expression @xmath15 where , @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the charmed baryon - to - meson ratios in proton - proton and @xmath11 collisions respectively . therefore @xmath18 represents the enhancement factor for the ratio of charm baryons to mesons in @xmath11 as compared to @xmath12 collisions , @xmath19 is the ratio between the branching ratios for the inclusive decay of @xmath3 and @xmath0 into electrons : @xmath20 in @xcite @xmath19 has been estimated to be 0.14 . as long as @xmath18 is larger than 1 the factor @xmath14 becomes less than 1 and @xmath21 .",
    "the main question to solve is whether the expected charmed baryon - to - meson expected enhancement is large enough to explain the difference with the experimental data .    in a high - energy heavy - ion collision ,",
    "strong color fields are expected to be produced between the partons of the projectile and target @xcite@xcite @xcite .",
    "these color fields are similar to those that appear in the glasma @xcite produced in the color glass condensate ( cgc ) . in a string",
    "heavy - quark pairs are produced via the schwinger mechanism with a rate @xmath22}$ ] where @xmath23 , is the effective string tension , proportional to the strength of the field ( for a single string @xmath24 1 gev / fm ) .",
    "longitudinal string models predict for heavy flavor a very suppressed production rate , since @xmath25 for @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "the color in these strings is confined to a small area in the transverse space , @xmath28 , with @xmath29fm . in a central heavy - ion collision",
    "many strings are formed between the partons of the projectile and target in a limited collision area , starting to overlap each other , forming clusters .",
    "the field strength of the cluster is proportional to the square root of the number of strings .",
    "so , for a cluster of nine strings , the string tension increases more than eight orders of magnitude becoming comparable to the initial fonllpqcd .",
    "the effect of strong color fields for open charm has been investigated before @xcite showing that a three- fold increase of the effective string tension results in a sizable enhancement of the total charm cross section and the nuclear modified factor shows a suppression at moderate @xmath30 consistent with the rhic data .    in this paper",
    ", we study the effects of strong color fields in the framework of percolation of strings @xcite .",
    "in this framework , a strong color field is obtained inside the clusters formed by the overlapping of individual strings .",
    "the clusters behave like individual strings with a higher string tension owing to the higher color field , and their energy momentum is the sum of the energy - momenta of individual strings .",
    "the color field of the string is stretched between a quark and an antiquark or between a diquark and a quark located at the extremes of the string . in the case of a cluster , instead of quarks or antiquarks we have complexes @xmath31 and @xmath32 formed from the different quarks and their antiquarks or diquarks and quarks at the extremes of the individual strings @xcite@xcite .",
    "the clusters behave like strings with complexes @xmath33 , located at the end , decaying into new pairs @xmath33 , @xmath34 , until they come to objects with mass comparable to hadron masses , which are identified with the known hadrons by combining the produced quarks or antiquarks with the appropriate statistical weights . in this way ,",
    "the production of baryons and antibaryons is enhanced with the number of strings in the cluster .",
    "the cluster not only has a stronger color field than the individual string giving rise to a mass - enhancement effect but also enhances the production of baryons relative to mesons owing to the increasing probability of getting three quarks or three antiquarks from the complex @xmath33 @xcite .",
    "this second effect is similar to what happens in coalescence or recombination models @xcite@xcite .",
    "the percolation of strings incorporates to some extent the recombination of flavors in a dynamical way .",
    "indeed a dynamical quark recombination model has shown a sizable suppression factor for the nonphotonic electrons nuclear modification factor @xcite .",
    "we evaluate the nuclear modification factor for @xmath35 , @xmath7 and b at rhic energies , computing also the baryon - to - meson ratio in @xmath11 and @xmath12 collisions .",
    "we observe also in @xmath12 a moderate enhancement of the ratio as a function of the transverse momentum which has consequences concerning the value of @xmath14 and therefore the rate of the nonphotonic electron suppression .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows : in the next section , we introduce briefly the percolation of the strings , and then we present our results and conclusions .",
    "in the string percolation model @xcite@xcite@xcite @xcite @xcite , multiparticle production is described in terms of color strings stretched between the partons of the projectile and the target . with increasing energy and/or atomic number of the colliding particles , the number of strings @xmath36 , grows and they start to overlap forming clusters , very much like disks in two - dimensional percolation theory . at a certain critical density , a macroscopical cluster appears , which marks the percolation phase transition .",
    "this density corresponds to the value @xmath37 ( depending on the profile function of the colliding nuclei ) where @xmath38 and @xmath39 stands for the overlapping area of the colliding objects .",
    "a cluster of @xmath40 strings behaves like a single string with the energy momentum corresponding to the sum of individual ones and with a higher color field corresponding to the vectorial sum in color space of the color fields of the individual strings . in this way ,",
    "the mean multiplicity @xmath41 and the mean transverse momentum squared @xmath42 of the particles produced by a cluster are given by @xmath43 and @xmath44 , where @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the corresponding quantities in a single string .",
    "in the limit of high density of strings , equations ( 5 ) transforms into @xcite @xmath47 , @xmath48 with @xmath49 .    for a specific kind of particle @xmath50",
    ", we will use : @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 for the corresponding quantities . to compute the multiplicities ,",
    "we must know @xmath36 and @xmath55 ( so for a fixed centrality , knowing @xmath36 we deduce the density @xmath56 ) .",
    "up to rhic energies , in the central rapidity region @xmath36 is approximately twice the number of collisions , @xmath13 .",
    "however @xmath36 is larger than @xmath57 at rhic and lhc energies , in the same way as in nucleon - nucleon collisions . according to color exchange models , such as dual parton model or the quark gluon string model @xcite@xcite , the number of produced strings @xmath36 is larger than two , starting at the rhic energies .",
    "indeed , at high enough energy the strings are stretched not only between the diquarks(quarks ) and quarks(diquarks ) of the projectile and target respectively , but also between quarks(antiquarks ) and antiquarks(quarks ) of the sea . as the energy increases , more @xmath58 or @xmath59 are formed and @xmath36 becomes larger than two .",
    "for the same reason in @xmath11 collisions , @xmath36 at high energy is larger than @xmath57 . in this work",
    "we take the values of @xmath36 from a monte - carlo based on the quark - gluon string model @xcite .",
    "concerning the transverse momentum distribution , one needs the distribution @xmath60 for each cluster , and the mean square transverse momentum distribution of the clusters @xmath61 , where @xmath19 is the inverse of the mean of the squared transverse momentum of each cluster which is related to the cluster size by equation ( 5 ) .",
    "we take @xmath62 as it is used for fragmentation of the lund string . for the weight function",
    "@xmath61 we take the gamma distribution .",
    "the generalized gamma distributions are unique distributions stable under the cluster - size transformations @xcite@xcite@xcite ; for simplicity we choose gamma distribution simplicity @xcite .",
    "@xmath63 with @xmath64 and @xmath65    the function @xmath23 measures the width of the distribution ( 7 ) and is the inverse of the normalized dispersion of the transverse momentum squared .",
    "the function @xmath23 depends on the density of strings @xmath56 .",
    "the transverse momentum distribution @xmath66 of particle @xmath50 is @xmath67    @xmath68    the formula ( 10 ) is valid for all types of collisions , energies and also all kind of flavors .",
    "later we will extend ( 10 ) for baryons .",
    "the function @xmath69 was determined by comparing ( 10 ) to rhic data .",
    "the function @xmath23 decreases with @xmath56 up to values @xmath70 ( peripheral au - au collisions at rhic energies ) from there it increases slowly .",
    "this behavior was expected .",
    "in fact , at low density there is no overlapping of strings and there are isolated strings ; therefore @xmath71 . when the density and therefore the numerator of eq . ( 9 ) increases then k decreases",
    ". the minimum of k will be reached where the fluctuations in the cluster - size reach its maximum . above this point , increasing @xmath56 these fluctuations decrease and @xmath23 increases .",
    "the agreement with data for @xmath30 up to 5 gev / c is very good @xcite@xcite .    in percolation of strings",
    "the fragmentation of a cluster of many strings is via the schwinger mechanism , producing successive pairs @xmath33 , where @xmath31 represents the complexes of quarks , diquarks and antiquarks at the extremes of the original string .",
    "it is clear that formula ( 10 ) only contains the effect of the stronger color field of the cluster , which enhances heavy particles production , irrespective of their being mesons or baryons , but it does not contain the breaking via flavor complexes @xmath33 and therefore can not describe baryons correctly . in previous papers",
    "@xcite@xcite@xcite monte carlo codes were presented where this mechanism was built up , but with the approximation of fusion of only two strings @xcite@xcite or using an effective color field @xcite .",
    "to to keep a closed analytical formula , incorporating the antibaryon and baryon enhancement from the mechanism depicted here , we observe that this enhancement is similar to using the formula ( 10 ) with a larger density , or equivalently with a larger @xmath36 .",
    "this means that for antibayons or baryons if we want to continue with formula ( 10 ) we must replace @xmath56 by @xmath72 , @xmath73 and instead of the first equation ( 6 ) we must use @xmath74 where the parameter @xmath75 is obtained from a fit to the experimental dependence of the @xmath30-integrated @xmath76 spectra with centrality @xcite .",
    "the obtained value is @xmath77 . in same sense",
    "we can say that the antibaryons ( baryons ) probe a higher density than mesons for a fixed energy and type of collisions .",
    "the equations ( 10 ) , ( 11 ) and ( 12 ) allow us to compute the antibaryon ( baryon ) spectra .",
    "the equations ( 11 ) and ( 12 ) replace the recombination process described in this section and it should be considered as an approximation to keep the analytical formula ( 10 )",
    ". the formulae ( 10 ) , ( 11 ) and ( 12 ) are valid for all kind of particles and not only for heavy flavor .",
    "we will show some results concerning light flavor .",
    "the equation ( 10 ) is limited to low and moderate @xmath30 not higher than @xmath78 gev / c .",
    "in fact , we consider a gaussian @xmath30 distribution for the particles produced from the fragmentation of a string , without any power - like tail .",
    "this excludes the high-@xmath30 behavior , although our formula ( 10 ) allows for an interpolation from low to high @xmath30 . by continuity ,",
    "the high @xmath30 suppression observed at rhic should give rise to a suppression at moderate @xmath30 , say @xmath78 gev / c , which is the limit where our equations apply .    to know the @xmath30 distributions given by formula ( 6 )",
    "we need the values of @xmath79 and @xmath80 , i. e. the mean @xmath30 of @xmath0 and @xmath7 particles produced from one string .",
    "we use @xmath81 gev / c and @xmath82gev / c . the difference between these two values is close to the difference between the masses of @xmath35 and @xmath7 and also agrees with the difference between the values commonly used of primordial transverse momentum of pions and protons , @xmath83 gev / c , @xmath84 gev / c . for b",
    "we use @xmath85 gev / c .    in formula ( 10 )",
    "the normalization is established by the values of @xmath86 at @xmath87 , which are computed using the formulae ( 6 ) for d and ( 9 ) for @xmath7 . to do this",
    ", we use the values @xmath88 and @xmath89 , with @xmath90 @xcite .",
    "we use these functions for @xmath91 and @xmath92 because for heavy particles , @xmath93 is very different from @xmath94 . concerning the function @xmath69 , we take the shape and values from the studies done in reference @xcite for @xmath11 collisions . in the case of @xmath12",
    "we take @xmath95 at @xmath96 gev and @xmath97 at @xmath98 tev .",
    "we discuss later the sensibility of the obtained result for the ratio @xmath99 to different k values .    in fig .",
    "1 we present our results for the nuclear modified factor @xmath100 for au - au collisions at rhic for @xmath101 , @xmath7 , @xmath102 and @xmath4 using formulae ( 1 ) as a function of @xmath94 compared with the experimental data on nonphotonic electrons .     for au+au central collisions , bars is data taken from phenix @xcite . ]",
    "the overall normalization is given by the value of @xmath100 at @xmath103 which has to do with the factor @xmath104 . since we know the number of strings produced in @xmath12 and @xmath11 collisions , we know @xmath105 , @xmath106 , @xmath107 and @xmath108 and the only free parameter is @xmath109 . from the data we obtain @xmath110 gev / c .",
    "the experimental errors allow us a @xmath111 freedom in the value of @xmath112 , however a higher value than 1.5 gev / c would not be realistic an a lower value will give rise to a higher normalization and therefore @xmath100 for @xmath113gev / c will exceed the experimental data even more than with the used value .",

    "we observe that at rhic energies the factor @xmath14 is only slightly below one , and for @xmath118 gev / c it is clearly over 0.5 , which means that the @xmath115 enhancement in @xmath11 is not able to explain all the difference between experimentally observed suppression of @xmath100 for non - photonic electrons and the pqcd expectations .",

    "the overlapping of the strings formed in the collision of heavy nuclei particles produces strong color fields which give rise to an enhancement of heavy flavor .",

    "this increase is a factor of 2 between @xmath87 and @xmath121 gev / c .",
