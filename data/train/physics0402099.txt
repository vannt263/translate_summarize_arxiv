    "paper derives the joint prior probability for surface temperature and emissivity for the land surface temperature retrieval problem in remote sensing .",
    "it presents analysis necessary for formulating a bayesian approach to that problem , together with a monte carlo simulation of land surface temperature ( lst ) and surface emissivity extractions .    after a brief description of the problem and the method of attack",
    ", the maximum entropy estimator for the mismatch between sensed and forward model radiance is given .",
    "next , the joint prior probability for surface temperature and emissivity is obtained .",
    "this quantity is required in order to construct a useable estimator for surface temperature and emissivity . with the prior probability in hand ,",
    "it is a simple matter to construct expressions for the expected values of surface temperature and emissivity consistent with sensor aperture radiances and available prior knowledge .",
    "finally , a sample temperature - emissivity separation is presented using modtran calculations both for the forward model and for simulated sensor radiances . 2004 the aerospace corporation",
    "increasingly capable remote sensing technology has sparked interest in exploiting thermal emission from surfaces both for remote sensing of surface temperature and of emissivity . on the one hand ,",
    "surface temperature studies form a significant portion of the science goals of modis , aster , and mti , while avhrr has been used operationally for sea surface and land surface temperature studies for many years . on the other ,",
    "the use of emissivity information in thermal portions of the spectrum for geological remote sensing has grown rapidly in recent years , and is as prominent in the science goals of modis and similar instruments as is surface temperature .",
    "accordingly , the problem of temperature - emissivity separation merits close examination .",
    "the entirety of the information about a radiating surface comes from the thermal radiation it emits , conventionally parameterized as the product of blackbody radiation at the surface temperature @xmath1 and the emissivity @xmath2 , @xmath3 at each wavenumber @xmath4 .",
    "suppose one observes a radiating patch of a surface at each of @xmath5 wavenumber intervals , and that one knows how to correct for the effects of line - of - sight ( los ) attenuation and contamination by radiance from other sources .",
    "one then has @xmath5 equations of the form ( [ eqn1 ] ) , but @xmath6 unknowns , including the surface temperature . in the absence of knowledge about @xmath1 or @xmath2 from extraneous sources",
    ", one has an underdetermined problem .",
    "a variety of methods has been proposed for handling the temperature - emissivity separation ( tes ) problem@xcite . in most approaches to this problem ,",
    "simultaneous lst and band emissivity retrieval depends upon specifying an emissivity value in one or more reference bands .",
    "the modis land surface temperature ( lst ) algorithm@xcite seeks a pair of reference channels in a part of the thermal spectrum in which the emissivity of natural surfaces displays very limited variation , and may therefore be regarded as known with good confidence .",
    "multiband emissvities inferred on this basis are called `` relative '' emissivities@xcite . algorithms using this approach include the reference channel method@xcite and emissivity normalization@xcite . in the former , a value of emissivity is assumed for one band , and in the latter , an approximate surface temperature is obtained by noting that emissivity can not exceed unity , in order to close the system of equations .",
    "other relative emissivity retrieval methods include the temperature - independent spectral index method@xcite,@xcite and spectral ratios@xcite .",
    "the study by li et al.@xcite shows that all of these relative emissivity retrieval algorithms are closely related , and argues that they may be expected to show comparable performance .",
    "a different approach has been proposed for analysis of multispectral thermal imager ( mti ) data@xcite , in which radiances are collected from a surface with looks at nadir and 60 degrees off - nadir , assuming a known angular dependence of emissivity , in order to balance equations and unknowns .",
    "the generalized split - window lst algorithm@xcite likewise uses dual looks in a regression - law based approach .",
    "the basis of the `` grey body emissivity '' approach@xcite is the slow variation of emissivity with wavelength for certain natural targets .",
    "the physics - based modis lst algorithm@xcite exploits observations taken at day and at night , on the assumption that band emissivites do not change over periods of a few weeks .",
    "it is clear that the methods described depend upon _ a priori _ assumptions about the variation of emissivity , either with wavelength , or with look angle , or over time , from which one would like to be free .",
    "the work described in this paper uses bayesian inference to retrieve estimates of surface parameters .",
    "this approach allows one to treat emissivities as `` nuisance '' parameters which may be integrated out of a posterior distribution function between parsimoniously chosen , and hence `` uninformative , '' limits .",
    "it might appear odd to use as an approach to the separation of temperature and emissivity a bayesian estimator which , in essence , allows one to ignore the actual value of emissivity .",
    "equation ( [ eqn1 ] ) shows that thermal radiance is linear in emissivity .",
    "however , the planck function goes as a fairly high power of the temperature in the lwir , and is close to exponential in temperature in the mwir .",
    "any roughness in the treatment of sensed radiance - as in allowing the assumed emissivity in the estimator to take on a wide range of values - may , therefore , be expected to lead to comparatively small errors in the inferred surface temperature .",
    "in fact , it turns out that the posterior distribution for surface temperature to be developed gives sharp limits to allowable surface temperature even in the presence of considerable latitude in the value of possible emissivities . in most cases ,",
    "only a narrow range of surface temperature is consistent with the sensed radiance in multiple bands , whatever be assumed about emissivity .",
    "once a reasonably good estimate of surface temperature is in hand , it is a simple matter to insert it into estimators for the individual band emissivities , and for the uncertainty in those values consistent with available knowledge .",
    "the _ a priori _ limits on emissivity may then be contracted , and a new estimate of surface temperature obtained .",
    "the expectation values of surface temperature and emissivity may thus be refined iteratively .",
    "it is also possible to search for a ( local ) maximum for the posterior likelihood for these parameters .",
    "because the tes problem is underdetermined , this will not give a unique global maximum , but , given the insensitivity of surface temperature estimates to small emissivity errors , the local maximum may be expected to give results close to the physical values for the parameters of interest .",
    "consider the problem of estimating surface temperature and emissivity from radiance detected by a remote sensor .",
    "the sensor supplies measurements of radiance @xmath7 at the aperture . a forward model is required to compute the value of aperture radiance as a function of , among other things , the parameters we wish to extract .",
    "assume initially ( for simplicity ) that the sensor has fine spectral resolution .",
    "the forward model radiance may be described at each wavenumber @xmath4 by a form of the duntley equation  @xcite @xmath8 @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the upwelling diffuse radiance at nadir optical depth @xmath11 ( top of the atmosphere , or toa , for spaceborne sensors ; @xmath12 is the cosine of the angle with respect to zenith ) and the downwelling irradiance at the surface , respectively .",
    "@xmath13 is the planck function at surface temperature @xmath1 .",
    "the emissivity is @xmath2 , and the surface reflectance @xmath14 .",
    "the form of ( [ eqn2 ] ) is what one would get assuming a lambertian surface obeying khirchoff s law .",
    "the analysis presented below does not depend upon a lambertian approximation to surface reflectances ; in fact , it makes no assumption regarding their angular behavior  @xcite .",
    "in what follows it will be assumed that the only unknown quantities in the preceding equation are t and @xmath2 .",
    "generalization of the analysis which follows to the case of reflectance not equal to one minus the emissivity poses no difficulties .",
    "an estimator for the probability that , given observed radiances @xmath15 , the surface parameters @xmath1 and @xmath2 take on particular values , is constructed in the following way @xcite,@xcite,@xcite , ( _ vide . _",

    "the posterior probability for @xmath1 and @xmath2 is given by bayes theorem as @xmath16 where @xmath17 denotes available knowledge .",
    "the quantity @xmath18 , the prior probability of the radiance @xmath7 , may be absorbed into an overall normalization and does not concern us further .",
    "it may be that the surface @xmath1 is of interest , whatever the value of emissivity . in this case , one is free to denigrate @xmath2 as a `` nuisance '' parameter and integrate it out of ( [ eqn3 ] ) , as will be done below .",
    "consider the remaining factors in ( [ eqn3 ] ) in turn , starting with the direct probability @xmath19 of observing radiance @xmath7 given @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and other _ a priori _ knowledge @xmath17 .",
    "with aid of the forward model , it is possible to recast this quantity in more tractable form . by hypothesis ,",

    "we now follow jaynes prescription for finding an uninformative prior probability@xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "assume two equivalent observers record the same sensor aperture radiance originating as thermal radiation from a surface , and interpret it in terms of planckian emission characterized by a surface temperature and emissivities , subject to los attenuation .",

    "according to a standard result in statistical physics , liouville s theorem ( @xcite , pp .",

    "so long as the photons remain collisionless they can neither leave their original volume of phase space , nor enter another",
    ". however vladimir or estragon choose to describe the patch of emitting surface @xmath51 , the time interval @xmath52 , the solid angle interval @xmath57 or the photon wavenumber @xmath4 , they must agree as to the number of photons @xmath48 in the bundle . hence , both ( [ eqn20 ] ) and the ratio @xmath58 are invariant along a photon trajectory .",
    "spectral radiance is defined as @xmath59 rewriting the radiance as @xmath60 gives @xmath61 for any component of the total radiance along a given line of sight@xcite .",
    "equation ( [ eqn25 ] ) has the same value in any frame of reference@xcite , with two consequences for this problem :    \\1 .",

    ", @xmath68    combining ( [ eqn19 ] ) , ( [ eqn30 ] ) , and ( [ eqn31 ] ) gives @xmath69 now , vladimir and estragon also agree that , while they must lie between 0 and 1 , emissivities are otherwise completely arbitrary functions of wavenumber , and by hypothesis have no dependence upon temperature . in @xmath70",
    "the right - hand side can have no dependence upon @xmath1 or @xmath34 , while the left - hand side can not be an arbitrary function of @xmath71 or @xmath4 .",
    "the only remaining possibility is @xmath72 the set of lorentz transformations forms a group@xcite , so this relation holds for the identity with @xmath73 , @xmath74 .",
    "the constant must therefore equal unity .",
    "next allow @xmath11 to differ from zero in ( [ eqn28 ] ) . in @xmath75",
    "the left - hand side has , by hypothesis , no dependence upon los transmission , while the right - hand has no dependence upon surface properties so , again , both sides equal a constant , and , from ( [ eqn26 ] ) and ( [ eqn34 ] ) , we find @xmath76 or @xmath77 los attenuation does not affect the validity of ( [ eqn34 ] ) .",
    "thus , the most general relation which respects a lorentz transformation carrying wavenumber @xmath4 to @xmath78 is @xmath79 @xmath80 the jacobian is therefore @xmath81 and @xmath82    invocation of the principle of indifference to assert estragon and vladimir must use the identical description of events , and thus assign the same prior probabilities , @xmath83 leads to the functional equation @xmath84 the solution of ( [ eqn43 ] ) is @xmath85 yielding @xmath86 for the prior probability .",
    "one now argues this form of the prior is least informative as to emissivity .",
    "no functional dependence upon a parameter should enter the form of the prior probability that is not imposed by the requirements of invariance and indifference .",
    "any such dependence would amount to the admission that we possess additional knowledge about emissivity beyond that assumed .",
    "that is , ( [ eqn45 ] ) is the unique choice of prior probability that assumes nothing about the value of @xmath2 beyond what is dictated by the problem statement .",
    "a standard argument ( found , for example , in @xcite , pp .",
    "9 - 15 ) then shows that prior knowledge about limits on the value of emissivity should appear in the limits of integration used in constructing marginal distributions for @xmath1",
    ".    surface temperature thus obeys the jeffreys prior , while emissivity obeys the bayes prior .",
    "both results may appear somewhat surprising , especially that for emissivity . from the manner in which it appears in the expression for radiance",
    ", one s naive expectation might be that emissivity is a scale parameter .",
    "however , the relation between the description of emissivity as seen by vladimir and estragon more resembles what one would expect of a location parameter : they must agree on the value of emissivity , but are free to assign it to different wavenumbers .",
    "the result just obtained will now be extended to the situation in which radiance is sensed in bands wide enough that that it can not be regarded as a function of wavenumber , but must be treated as an integral over a passband .",
    "one then writes , for the contribution of surface emission to the total radiance at the sensor aperture in band i , @xmath87 it is always possible to do this by the mean value theorem for integrals , and it is frequently the case that the right - hand side of ( [ eqn46 ] ) expresses all available knowledge concerning the radiant properties of the emitting surface .",
    "vladimir describes the surface emission by @xmath88 with    @xmath89    while , by ( [ eqn37])-([eqn39 ] ) , estragon describes things by @xmath90 with    @xmath91    comparison of the two expressions for surface emission , ( [ eqn47 ] ) and ( [ eqn49 ] ) , leads to the immediate conclusion that the jacobian connecting the two descriptions of surface temperature and band emissivity is @xmath40 = \\gamma , \\label{eqn51}\\ ] ] and @xmath92 once more .    the result just obtained allows us to derive estimators for surface temperature and emissivity .",
    "the starting point is a calculation of the marginal posterior probability for t given observed radiance in a finite number of bands when the surface emissivity in band @xmath93 is known to lie between @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",

    "a land surface temperature retrieval algorithm has been developed using the results just derived .",

    "it is intended to illustrate the application of bayesian analysis to thermal remote sensing , and is purported to be optimal neither in execution speed nor accuracy .",
    "the requirement for only one forward model calculation per retrieval suggests that it will not impose an extreme computational burden in practice ( even though the forward model to be described requires two modtran calculations ) .",
    "the algorithm is used to simulate lst retrieval from a notional exoatmospheric sensor that records radiance from a patch of the earth s surface at a specified signal - to - noise ratio(snr ) .",
    "it is assumed that the dominant noise contribution arises from the shot noise of the radiance incident upon the sensor aperture .    in outline ,",
    "the algorithm works as follows .",
    "equation ( [ eqn58 ] ) gives the distribution of surface temperature consistent with observed radiances and the initial range of emissivities .",
    "this distribution typically differs from zero only within a narrow range about the true surface temperature . within this range , ( [ eqn62 ] )",

    "performance of the algorithm appears not too sensitive to the exact noise contamination added to the simulated band radiances , nor to the exact noise variance assumed in the retrieval , as long as neither is grossly erroneous .",

    "however , in about @xmath161 of the simulations it proved impossible to find an acceptable solution with all six bands in this manner .",
    "the solution instead tended to badly erroneous values ( e.g. , @xmath162 , and emissivities pegged at the limits of the prior ) .",
    "inspection of the posterior probabilities from ( [ eqn61 ] ) revealed that in these anomalous cases one or more of the individual band posterior probabilities fails to overlap significantly with the product of the remaining posterior distributions , leading to a joint posterior probability that effectively vanishes .",
    "a number of remedies is available when this difficulty arises .",
    "the number of successful retrievals rises sharply when the range of the band emissivity prior is expanded to 0.7 - 0.999 , but at the cost of reducing their overall accuracy somewhat .",
    "experimentation shows that , in all of the anomalous cases , it is possible to get a satisfactory lst retrieval with some three - band subset of the original six .",
    "the lst so obtained can then be inserted into the expectation value for band emissivity to yield emisssivities for all six bands .",
    "finally , the support of the joint posterior probability can be broadened by increasing the noise radiance @xmath25 in its calculation .",
    "this last approach was used to obtain table 3 . the effect on retrievals of increasing",
    "@xmath25 for subsets of the bands differed negligibly from that of increasing @xmath25 for all bands by the same factor .",
    "the most intractable of the anomalous cases ( one each nighttime and daytime ) required increasing @xmath25 by a factor of 7.0 in order to obtain an acceptable solution .",
    "examination of the @xmath163 statistic for retrieval errors shows that the estimator is ( slightly ) biased for normal , and significantly biased for anomalous , retrievals .",
    "for the 963 normal nighttime retrievals the mean and stardard deviation of the surface temperature error are @xmath164 , with @xmath165 1.06 per degree of freedom .",
    "for 958 normal daytime retrievals , the corresponding figures are @xmath166 and @xmath1651.03 per degree of freedom .",
    "the values for 37 anomalous nighttime retrievals are @xmath167 and @xmath165 2.64 per degree of freedom , with @xmath168 and @xmath1651.29 per degree of freedom , for 42 anomalous daytime cases . however , the distribution of errors is very accurately gaussian ( as should be expected ) .",
    "if the mean error is subtracted before calculating @xmath163 , the result is identically 0.999 per degree of freedom for surface temperature ( and all six band emissivities ) for all retrievals .",
    "forward models for the anomalous cases systematically have large errors in one or more of the randomly - varied simulation parameters .",
    "thus , the surface visibility and the boundary temperature are both more likely to lie near the limits of their range than in the middle .",
    "in particular , the column water vapor scaling factor is over three times as likely to exceed 1.1 for anomalous retrievals as for normal ones ( 25/37 vs 203/963 nighttime ; 27/42 vs 182/958 daytime ) , with only three daytime and two nighttime anomalous retrievals occurring for a column water vapor scaling less than unity .",
    "the frequency of anomalous retrievals appears , to some extent , to be an artifact of inserting large errors in the forward model to approximately simulate imperfect knowledge of atmospheric conditions .    in any event , all 2000 monte carlo realizations led to a successsful retrieval of both lst and six band emissivities .",
    "points which should be addressed in further developments of practical algorithms :    \\1 .",
    "it appears that this approach to tes works largely because the range of plausible surface temperature values consistent with band radiances and an uninformative range of band emissivity is quite constricted , as a consequence of the strong temperature dependence of the planck function .",
    "it turns out not to be terribly difficult to get a temperature estimate that is close enough to truth that it can be inserted into the least sophisticated imaginable estimator for band emissivity ( [ eqn63 ] ) , and still lead to acceptably accurate results .",
    "once the algorithm has gotten to an iteration in which the current range of temperature and band emissivities is restricted to a neighborhood sufficiently close to the true values that the posterior distribution is jointly gaussian in @xmath1 as well as in the @xmath169 , it is apparent both that convergence to the true values will occur as assumed in this algorithm , and that these values will maximize the likelihood .",
    "however , at present , there is no proof in hand that the procedure outlined above actually converges , or that , given that it does , it converges to the true surface temperature and emissivity combination .",
    "it appears to do both to good accuracy in practice .",
    "however , the algorithm did - initially - fail to converge to an acceptable solution in about @xmath161 of the realizations .",
    "as recounted in the previous section , it proved possible in every case to adapt the search strategy so as to successfully retrieve both lst and emissivities for all bands .",
    "the successful recovery strategies all had the effect of maximizing the numerical joint posterior probability , by some combination of 1 ) eliminating from the estimator band posterior probabilities whose effective nonvanishing support did not intersect that of the joint probability of the remaining bands , or forcing intersection by broadening the support of the outlier posterior probabilities by 2 ) loosening limits on the prior , or 3 ) increasing the noise radiance parameter assumed in the retrieval .",
    "the solutions obtained are , in any event , not unique , because the tes problem is underdetermined .",
    "considered as a surrogate for maximum likelihood solutions , the algorithm solutions approximate only local maxima , and it might be possible to find maxima which give very poor account of temperature and emissivity .",
    "this has not happened in simulations performed to date .",
    "the algorithm as presently formulated appears to be unnecessarily complicated .",
    "it seems certain that its operation can be significantly streamlined . for practical applications",
    ", it will be necessary to eliminate redundant elements of the calculation .",
    "\\3 . the model for band radiances in this memo",
    "treated them independently , apart from the prior knowledge that the surface temperature for all bands must be the same .",
    "bretthorst @xcite,@xcite,@xcite has addressed problems involving more sophisticated models for observations , in an approach which would appear to offer real advantages in the present context .",
    "perhaps the least satisfactory feature of this algorithmic approach is its dependence upon an accurate forward radiance model . to the extent modtran",
    "can be regarded as supplying radiance estimates which are zero - mean error estimates of the true radiance , the effect of radiance prediction error on this algorithm may simply be regarded as a contribution to the noise variance .",
    "but in real life , a forward model can be expected to have systematic errors that need not originate as unbiased stationary gaussian processes .",
    "the question whch has been addressed in this work is : given an accurate forward model ( in the sense just described ) , what surface temperature and band emissivities are consistent with observed radiances and knowledge of their error statistics ?",
    "a harder question , which will be the focus of further developments , is : given a fallible , but reasonably accurate , forward model , what surface temperatures and band emissivities can possibly be consistent with observations and available knowledge , no matter what the forward model error , so long as it falls within known limits ?",
    "a simple argument , based on inherent physical symmetries that the description of surface thermal emission must obey , leads to the appropriate prior probabilities for surface temperature and emissivity .",
    "these lead to the maximum entropy estimator for the mismatch between sensed and modeled radiance in the presence of noise , from which an estimator of surface temperature may be constructed that treats emissivity as a nuisance parameter .",
