    "the effect of the cosmological expansion on the bending of light rays and gravitational lensing in situations where the expansion is driven by a cosmological constant has been studied for more than 30 years , since islam s 1983 paper @xcite on light trajectories in schwarzschild - de  sitter ( sds ) spacetime , but the issue has received an increased amount of attention in the past 15 or so years with observations leading to the conclusion that the global rate of expansion is accelerating . among the recent references on the subject ,",
    "we refer the reader to the papers by ishak and rindler @xcite , and to the comprehensive discussion by lebedev and lake @xcite , which also contain citations to the rest of the literature . in this paper",
    "we will examine light bending in a more general setting , but still representing a nonrotating gravitating object in an asymptotically homogeneous and isotropic background .",
    "let us introduce some relevant concepts and model spacetimes .",
    "a spatially flat , homogeneous , isotropic cosmological model is described by a friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) metric of the form @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the line element for euclidean 3-space , in the time gauge in which @xmath4 is proper time along a comoving worldline , with spatial scale factor @xmath5 .",
    "the hubble parameter @xmath6 is usually referred to as the  expansion rate \" ; an accelerating expansion rate corresponds to a situation in which @xmath7 , and is often quantified by the  deceleration parameter \" @xmath8 .    in the standard cosmological model ,",
    "results of observations such as the redshift - luminosity relationship for supernovae are interpreted as indicating that @xmath9 .",
    "the physical reason for this acceleration is not yet well understood , but one simple possibility is the presence of a non - vanishing cosmological constant , and most of the literature on gravitational light bending and the cosmological expansion has focused so far on this possibility .",
    "a cosmological constant @xmath10 corresponds to constant values @xmath11 and @xmath12 , and the model used to study its effects on light bending is the schwarzschild - de sitter spacetime , which in the common ",
    "static \" coordinates takes the form of the kottler metric @xcite , s^2 = -(1-r-3)t^2 + ( 1-r-3)^-1r^2 + r^2 ^ 2 .",
    "[ schwarzschildds ] this line element approaches that of the schwarzschild metric for a black hole of mass @xmath13 located at the center of the coordinate system for small @xmath14 ( or @xmath15 ) , and the de  sitter metric with cosmological constant @xmath10 , written in static coordinates , for large @xmath14 ( or @xmath16 ) .    in the presence of matter fields , however , or if the accelerated expansion is due to any reason other than a cosmological constant , we do not expect @xmath1 to be constant .",
    "indeed , in the standard @xmath10cdm cosmological model the time dependence of @xmath1 is governed by both @xmath10 and different types of matter , and observationally there are indications that @xmath17 has been varying in time ( see , for example , refs .",
    "our goal is to extend the work on gravitational light bending at cosmological scales to the case of a time - dependent expansion rate @xmath1 and study the effects of a non - zero @xmath18 .    a model with time - dependent hubble parameter",
    "was analyzed in an 2010 article by kantowski et al .",
    "@xcite , who used a  swiss cheese \" model to examine the bending of light in a cosmological setting .",
    "in that paper , the authors consider a flrw cosmology where a spherical region has been replaced by a bubble inside which the metric is of the sds type .",
    "the values of the bubble radius @xmath19 , black - hole mass @xmath13 and cosmological constant @xmath10 are subject to constraints from matching conditions at the bubble boundary ; in particular , @xmath19 scales in time the same way @xmath5 does .",
    "they can then perturbatively calculate the lightlike geodesics up to orders @xmath20 and @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the distance of closest approach to the central black hole . using realistic parameter values in a @xmath10cdm model",
    ", the authors found that the combined effects of the additional @xmath10 and matter terms on the bending angles could be as large as a few percent .",
    "our approach will be to model a gravitating object in an expanding universe with non - constant @xmath1 by a mcvittie metric , and examine the behavior of null geodesics in it . in this model",
    "we avoid the need for  gluing \" together two different solutions of einstein s equation and we can prescribe an arbitrary expansion rate ; the price we pay is having an unphysical equation of state for the fluid matter , and the need to integrate the geodesic equation numerically ; in this sense , our results are complementary to those of kantowski et al .",
    "the mcvittie metric has been recently used in work on the effect of cosmological expansion on gravitational lensing @xcite , but in that paper @xmath17 was taken to be constant and , as we will see in the next section , the spacetime is then equivalent to schwarzschild - de sitter . in sec .",

    "a metric that can be thought of as representing a schwarzschild black hole embedded in a fluid - filled flrw spacetime was first derived in 1933 by g.c .",
    "mcvittie @xcite .",
    "surprisingly , despite it being a rather old solution of the einstein equation , its exact interpretation has been somewhat controversial , and papers have appeared questioning the black - hole interpretation of the metric @xcite ; recent work @xcite has shown , however , that this metric does indeed model a black hole embedded in an expanding cosmology , at least when the background spacetime is spatially flat and the hubble parameter satisfies @xmath24 . we should point out though that the mcvittie metric is not considered as representing a generic solution of this type .",
    "physically , in this situation one would expect the energy density to be inhomogeneous , due to the expansion of the universe at large scales and the attraction of the black hole at small scales , which might cause the black hole to accrete matter as in a cosmological analog of the vaidya metric @xcite .",
    "as kaloper et al .",
    "argue , this is not the case ; the equation relating the energy density to @xmath1 is exactly the same as for a flrw cosmology , while the inhomogeneity appears in the expression for the pressure @xcite .",
    "we use the mcvittie metric in this work because it allows us to freely specify the function @xmath1 in an asymptotically flrw model with a localized gravitating mass @xmath13 ; since we will consider the light ray as interacting only with the geometry , the form of the matter equation of state will not be directly relevant for us .",
    "of course , that equation of state does affect the local spacetime geometry , but the fact that our local geometry does not have the sharp bubble boundaries of the swiss - cheese universe makes it arguably more realistic .",
    "the mcvittie line element can be written down in the diagonal form s^2= - ( ) ^2 t^2 + ( 1+)^4 a^2(t ) x^2,:= , [ comoving ] where @xmath5 is the asymptotic scale factor ; these coordinates are an inhomogeneous - space version of comoving coordinates , in the sense that at large values of @xmath25 the line element tends to that of a flrw spacetime with scale factor @xmath5 , expressed in comoving coordinates .",
    "several authors @xcite have introduced a coordinate transformation @xmath26 to  painlev - gullstrand type \" coordinates defined by r = ( 1+)^2 a(t)r [ staticr ] ( the coordinates @xmath4 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 are unchanged ) , in which the line element takes the form s^2=",
    "-(f(r)- h^2(t ) r^2 ) t^2- rt + + r^2 ^2 , [ static ] with @xmath29 and again @xmath30 .",
    "thus , @xmath14 is an area radial coordinate , characterized by the fact that the surface area of a 2-sphere of constant @xmath14 is @xmath31 , and the function @xmath1 represents the asymptotic expansion rate in comoving coordinates , so we still call it the  hubble parameter \" .",
    "note that in the adm - type terminology for the 3 + 1 split of a spacetime metric , the spatial part of this metric has no time dependence and has the same form as in schwarzschild spacetime , while the cosmological expansion terms have been moved into the shift vector , with non - vanishing component @xmath32 .",
    "for us , it is importat to note that the sds spacetime with cosmological constant @xmath10 is a special case of the mcvittie metric with constant @xmath33 and @xmath34 , as one can see by defining the time coordinate transformation t = |t - r. [ newt ] using @xmath35 as time coordinate , the mcvittie metric takes the traditional kottler form of eq .",
    "( [ schwarzschildds ] ) ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    in the literature on light deflection in sds",
    "spacetimes authors use the kottler , diagonal form of the metric , because of its greater simplicity .",

    "static \" , as opposed to the  comoving \" ones of the line element ( [ comoving ] ) , in which the spatial metric does not have a static form even when @xmath1 is constant .",
    "in this section we will review some of the definitions and results in the literature on null geodesics in sds spacetime ( see , for example , the papers by ishak and rindler @xcite and lebedev & lake @xcite ) . in view of the fact that we will later generalize those results , however",
    ", we will replace @xmath10 by @xmath36 , where @xmath0 is the constant value of @xmath1 , use the line element ( [ static ] ) , and add some remarks motivated by the more general situation .",
    "the _ whole _ mcvittie line element is now time - independent , and we can use the static and rotational killing vector fields @xmath37 and @xmath38 to define two conserved quantities along a geodesic @xmath39 with tangent vector @xmath40 , e:= -g_^ ^k^= [ f(r)-h_0 ^ 2 r^2 ] k^t + k^r , : = g_^ ^k^= r^2k^ , for a geodesic in the equatorial coordinate plane . in other words ,",
    "the geodesic satisfies k^= r^2,k^t = ef(r)-h_0 ^ 2r^2 - h_0r[f(r)-h_0 ^ 2r^2]k^r . using these equations , the conditions for a null geodesic with @xmath41",
    "can be reduced to a single differential equation , which in terms of the conserved quantities becomes ( ) ^2 + ( f(r ) - h_0 ^ 2 r^2 ) = , [ schwarzdrdlambda ] where we have defined @xmath42 , the impact parameter .",
    "note that , as expected , if @xmath43 this is the same equation one gets for a null geodesic in schwarzschild spacetime ( see , for example , ref .",

    "[ schwdphidr ] notice that , since these equations do not involve @xmath4 or the geometry of a constant-@xmath4 hypersurface , we would have obtained the same relationship between @xmath14 and @xmath28 using the form ( [ schwarzschildds ] ) for the metric .",
    "( [ schwdphidr ] ) encodes some aspects of the effect a cosmological constant has on the formal description of light bending near a nonrotating gravitating mass , but one should be careful when discussing any measurable effects on observations .",
    "a controversy in this sense arose around the interpretation of ( [ schwdphidr ] ) , because although the equation does depend on @xmath10 , it is of the same form as the one obtained in schwarzschild spacetime if one replaces the impact parameter @xmath45 in the latter by an ",

    "this aspect has been extensively discussed starting with the original paper by islam @xcite .",
    "however , the more recent literature has made it clear that the relationship between @xmath14 and @xmath28 only tells us part of the story on how the deflection angle depends on @xmath10 , for various reasons .",
    "one reason is that , as pointed out by ishak and rindler @xcite , from ( [ schwdphidr ] ) alone and without knowing the spatial metric , one can only obtain the value that an angle would have in flat space .",

    "this is not the full bending angle , but as the following argument illustrates it is relevant for the calculation of the latter . in schwarzschild spacetime",
    "one can imagine placing the source and observer at infinity and calculate a bending angle that does not refer to specific locations for them and depends only on the impact parameter @xmath45 , in addition to the lens mass @xmath13 .",
    "because of the curved geometry of the constant-@xmath4 surfaces , this is not an option in sds spacetime @xcite . the simplest alternative is to set up the coordinates so that the point of closest approach is at @xmath47 and use as measure of total bending the sum @xmath48 of the angles the light ray makes with the half - lines @xmath49 and @xmath50 at the intersection points , labeled @xmath51 and @xmath52 in fig .",

    "in this paper we examined the bending of null geodesics in spatially flat mcvittie metrics , exact solutions to the einstein equation which have been shown to represent nonrotating black holes embedded in flrw background spacetimes .",
    "we used a slowly varying hubble parameter @xmath105 , and the null geodesics were found numerically for situations in which the source and lens were aligned as seen by the observer .",
    "simulations were run with fixed values for the mass of the central object and distances from the observer to the source and lens , in static coordinates , while we used three different values for @xmath61 and in each case we looked at how the angle of arrival of null geodesics at the observer s location varied with @xmath82 ; in the @xmath96 case , our results are in agreement with earlier perturbative calculations for light bending in schwarzschild - de  sitter spacetimes @xcite .",
    "each simulation gave us three different values for the angle of arrival .",
    "the euclidean angle ( calculated using an auxiliary , fictitious flat spatial metric and therefore not physically measurable , but nevertheless useful for comparison with previous work and as a check on the resuls ) is independent of @xmath61 if there is no acceleration , @xmath96 , but interestingly our simulations show a small dependence on @xmath61 if one considers cases with @xmath98 .",
    "the two other types of angles are the ones that would be measured by static and comoving observers , respectively , and both show a dependence on @xmath61 as well as on @xmath82 . in this model , using the worldlines of comoving observers as the better approximations to those of physical observers , and the results from the simulations with @xmath106 km / s / mpc as more representative of the actual expansion rate , we find that over the full range of values we used for @xmath82 , and with our values for the distances and lens mass the bending angle varies by about 5% around @xmath107 or so , which agrees in order of magnitude with the results found by kantowski et al .  in the swiss - cheese model @xcite .",
    "these values may seem encouraging , but unfortunately the effects we described would most likely be dwarfed by measurement uncertainties and departures of the metrics around actual galaxy clusters from the spherically symmetric ones used here to model them .",
    "we view this work as a first step in quantifying the effect of @xmath108 on light bending and lensing in a useful way , and an improved lens modeling is one way in which the work will have to be extended before these bending effects can be meaningfully related to measurements .",
    "two other ways in which our approach can be improved are the fact that we fixed the values of the source and lens coordinates @xmath59 and @xmath58 as if they were directly measurable , and the fact that we considered only cases in which the source , lensing object and observer are aligned . obtaining results beyond the latter limitation is essentially straightforward , although one will have to extend our criterion for identifying geodesics in different spacetimes to a more general setting . to replace the criterion based on values of @xmath14 by a more realistic one based on redshifts , one would have to use the relationship between redshifts and distances , which depends on the cosmological expansion history .",
    "related to this is the fact that , although the simulations themselves and the calculations of the arrival angles are non - perturbative , fixing values of @xmath14 is equivalent to fixing those of actual spatial distances only to leading order in @xmath13 ; and using the same values of @xmath17 in different spacetimes at the time the geodesic leaves the source is equivalent to using the same values of @xmath17 when the geodesics arrive at the observer s location also only to leading order .",
