    "<S> in this study , we introduce a relativistic quantum mechanical wave equation of the spin-1 particle as an excited state of the zitterbewegung and show that it is consistent with the 2 + 1 dimensional proca theory . at the same time , we see that in the rest frame this equation has two eigenstates , particle and antiparticle states or negative and positive energy eigenstates , respectively , and satisfy @xmath0 spin algebra . as practical applications , </S>",
    "<S> we derive the exact solutions of the equation in the presence of a constant magnetic field and a curved spacetime . from these solutions , </S>",
    "<S> we find noether charge by integrating the constructed spin-1 particle current on hyper surface and discuss pair production from the charge . and , we see that the discussion on  the noether charge is useful tool for undersdantding the pair production phenomenon because the charge is derived from a probabilistic particle current . </S>",
