    "the @xmath0 has proved to be a rich mine of physics results .",
    "the study of rare @xmath1 decays has been a constant challenge to beyond standard model extensions .",
    "semileptonic @xmath1 decays have provided crucial information on the ckm matrix elements @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "hadronic @xmath1 decays are also a challenge and provide insight into qcd . with the beginning of the programs at the asymmetric @xmath1 factories at slac and kek the new avenue of cp - violation studies has opened up .",
    "there is also a wealth of physics under the resonance especially in charm mesons , charm baryons , and taus .",
    "the energy range is also ideally suited to two photon production studies , and of course the study of the properties of the @xmath4 and other @xmath5 resonances themselves .",
    "cleo entered into its twentieth year of data taking at the end of 1999 .",
    "i summarize here the latest , that is since the 99 - 00 winter conference season , results from cleo . even limiting myself to this time slice",
    "leaves no room for tau physics and many results can be only referenced .",
    "i will first discuss our new results in rare @xmath1 decays where we have an unambiguous observation of the gluonic penguin mode , @xmath6 , new limits on @xmath1 decays to @xmath7 , a pair of charged leptons , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 . turning to semileptonic",
    "@xmath1 decays i present our preliminary results on @xmath2 in @xmath10 decay , and a new measure of @xmath1 mixing parameters combining a lepton tag with a partial reconstruction hadronic tag . in hadronic @xmath1",
    "decays we have observed @xmath11 and studied the resonance substructure of the @xmath12 system .",
    "we have many new results on @xmath13 charmonium including observations of @xmath14 and limits on @xmath15 in an attempt to understand our anomalous results on @xmath16 .",
    "also we test charmonium production models by observing @xmath17 and limiting @xmath18 .",
    "we have measurements of @xmath19 and evidence for @xmath20 . in the @xmath21 decay and @xmath22",
    "we measure the polarization of the @xmath23 to test a prediction of the factorization ansatz .",
    "we have observed the first exclusive @xmath1 decays to nucleons in @xmath24 and @xmath25 . in charm physics",
    "we have observed wrong sign @xmath26 and are working hard on more @xmath27 mixing and doubly cabibbo suppressed decay ( dcsd ) studies . in charm baryons",
    "we have many new results including first observations of the @xmath28 and the pair @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "these complete the set of l = 0 charm baryons , the bulk of which were first observed by cleo . in resonance physics",
    "we have a measure of the rate for the @xmath31 to decay to charged and neutral @xmath1 meson pairs .",
    "we have measurements of @xmath32 parameters based on its two photon production to investigate a puzzle in pqcd .",
    "finally cleo went through a major upgrade to the third major version of our detector .",
    "this began taking physics data in july of 2000 , and i will briefly review the status of cleo  iii .",
    "the results discussed below are based on the cleo  ii data set taken with the cleo  ii detector from 1989 to 1999 .",
    "the detector is described in detail elsewhere .",
    "@xcite about two thirds of the data were taken from 1995 to 1999 in the cleo  ii.v configuration which replaced the innermost straw - tube detector of cleo  ii with a high precision silicon vertex detector.@xcite most of the analyses discussed use the entire cleo  ii data set with exceptions for systematic error limited studies and analyses that depend on the precision vertex measuring capabilities only available in cleo  ii.v .",
    "the total data set has an integrated luminosity of roughly 14/fb with two thirds taken at a center of mass energy of about 10.58 gev on the peak of @xmath31 resonance , corresponding to roughly ten million @xmath33 events , and one third taken at an energy 60  mev below the @xmath31 peak and well below the @xmath33 threshold .",
    "the decay @xmath34 produced by the gluonic penguin can be uniquely tagged when the gluon splits into an @xmath35 pair as no other @xmath36 decay can produce this final state .",
    "the mode @xmath6 is one such tag of the gluonic penguin and its rate is a vital piece to the rare @xmath1 decay puzzle .",
    "we search for the signal in both the charged and neutral modes pairing a reconstructed @xmath37 candidate with a charged track that has a specific ionization ( @xmath38 ) and time - of - flight consistent with a kaon or a reconstructed @xmath39 candidate .",
    "we extract the yield of signal events by performing an unbinned , maximum likelihood fit to the six variables shown in figure  [ fig : phikplots ] where     data on the six variables used in the maximum likelihood fit .",
    "the solid lines show the total fit while the dashed lines show the contribution of the background.,title=\"fig : \" ]    the pdf for the signal is taken from simulation and the background is taken from off resonance data .",
    "the yield , significance , efficiency for this procedure and the preliminary branching fractions for the two modes are displayed in table  [ tab : phik ] .",
    ".results of likelihood fit .",
    "note that the efficiencies do not include any branching fractions [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     compared to a right sign yield of over 9000 .",
    "we are working hard to turn this yield into a rate , but the dalitz structure of the wrong sign decay may be different than the right sign decay leading to a difference in efficiency for mixed and dcsd wrong sign events .",
    "the resonance substructure for @xmath40 is very rich with three dominant modes clearly visible in the dalitz plot for the right sign signal shown in figure  [ fig : kpipi0dal ] , clear signs of interference ,     decay in the cleo data.,title=\"fig : \" ]    and many other smaller amplitudes that can contribute .",
    "we are also working on the lifetime analyses of the @xmath41 mode ; the cp even eigenstates @xmath42 and @xmath43 ; cp odd eigenstates @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 ; and in the the semileptonic decays @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "one of the first steps on this road is a preliminary measure of the cp asymmetries @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "there are a great many results on charm baryons , and i can only cover the very highest points , and even these only briefly .",
    "we have a first observation of the @xmath28 and a new measure of @xmath51 mass both in @xmath52 decay.@xcite the data is shown in figure  [ fig : sigma ] showing the clear     showing the narrow @xmath51 and wide @xmath28.,title=\"fig : \" ]    signals .",
    "we make the first observation of the @xmath53 pair @xmath29 and @xmath30.@xcite note that this result combined with the observation of the @xmath28 discussed above means that all of the @xmath54 single charm baryons have been observed .",
    "the majority of these have had their first observation by cleo .    in a preliminary result",
    "we see two states in decays to @xmath55 ; a wide state decaying to @xmath56 and @xmath57 , possibly an orbitally excited @xmath58 , and a narrow state decaying to @xmath59 and non - resonant , possibly an excited baryon with @xmath60 between the light quarks.@xcite the data is shown in figure  [ fig : two ] .",
    "our interpretation of these     showing the two new states.,title=\"fig : \" ]    two states is guided by the observed mass and width rather than any observation of the angular distribution of their decays .",
    "cleo has observed the @xmath61 and made a precision measure of its mass,@xcite and we have a new measurement of the @xmath62 branching fraction into @xmath63.@xcite",
    "from the relative rates for @xmath64 and @xmath65 we are able to measure the relative branching fraction of the @xmath31 to charged and neutral @xmath1 mesons.@xcite we find @xmath66 and assuming @xmath67 , that is the @xmath31 only decays to @xmath33 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "we have observed 300 events of the two photon production of the @xmath32.@xcite we measure @xmath71 mev , @xmath72 mev , and the two photon partial width @xmath73 kev , where the last error is from the branching fraction of the @xmath32 into @xmath74 .",
    "this last observation agrees much better with the prediction of peturbative qcd based on the @xmath75 partial width of the @xmath76 .",
    "the cleo  ii.v detector ceased data taking in february of 1999 .",
    "it has been upgraded to the cleo  iii detector .",
    "the upgrade consists of a new four layer double sided silicon drift detector , a new 47 layer drift chamber , much stronger particle i d with the addition of a new barrel rich , refurbished csi calorimeter and muon system , and a new data acquisition and trigger system that are designed to handle delivered luminosity of up to @xmath77 .",
    "the upgraded detector was completed in april of 2000 and started taking physics data in july of 2000 .",
    "the new detector is performing well with a tracking system already working as well as the cleo  ii configuration , and a much improved resolution on photons in the calorimeter endcaps due to the reduction of support material in the upgrade from the old to the new drift chamber .",
    "the rich is also performing very well with a preliminary efficiency of around 90% , and an intrinsic resolution on the cherenkov angle of 2 - 4 mrad .",
    "there is a vast array of physics results to be had from the @xmath31 .",
    "highlights from cleo in the last six months are an unambiguous observation of the gluonic penguin , the best single measure of @xmath78 , and the first observation of a high multiplicity hadronic @xmath1 decay mode .",
    "there are many other results and with the beginning of cleo  iii data taking and first results from the asymmetric @xmath1 factories we can all look forward to much more exciting physics from the @xmath31 in the future ."
