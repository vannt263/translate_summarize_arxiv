    "<S> , there was little progress on the unstable case ; @xcite gives some history . </S>",
    "<S> this was due both to the difficulty of constructing ultrafilters and the state of our understanding of unstable theories . in the last few years </S>",
    "<S> , there has been very substantial progress in this area ( malliaris @xcite-@xcite , malliaris and shelah @xcite-@xcite ) .    </S>",

    "<S> we leverage the zfc theorems of @xcite to prove , nearly fifty years after keisler introduced the order , that :    there is an infinite strictly descending sequence of simple unstable theories in keisler s order . </S>",

    "<S> the proof builds on a breakthrough of @xcite , the isolation of ` explicit simplicity ' and the corresponding construction of a family of so - called optimal ultrafilters . in some sense , </S>",

    "<S> this result revises both the picture of keisler s order and the picture of simple theories . </S>",
    "<S> simple theories , a generalization of stable theories which include the random graph and pseudofinite fields , are an active area of model - theoretic research as well as a fertile interface for applications of model theory to geometry and combinatorics @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . though simple theories retain some of the good behavior and structure theory available in stability , many basic questions about how simple theories may differ essentially from stable theories had remained open .    </S>",
    "<S> theorem [ t : seq ] can be understood as showing that the asymptotic structure of simple theories is significantly more complex than that of stable theories ( see diagram below ) . moreover , the theories in question are low , with trivial forking . building on @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> our methods here initiate a program of classifying the simple theories according to the complexity of coloring , that is , of the range @xmath3 of a coloring function @xmath4 as it is used in  5 below .    </S>",
    "<S> the key model - theoretic objects in our proof are the generic @xmath5-free @xmath1-hypergraphs , [ d : m - k ] below . </S>",
    "<S> the results from combinatorial set theory have to do with existence of free subsets in set mappings , combined with a major set - theoretic advance already mentioned , the existence theorem for so - called optimal ultrafilters recently proved by the authors in @xcite ( see  [ s : various ] below ) .    </S>",
    "<S> [ d : m - k ] @xmath6 is the model completion of the theory with one symmetric irreflexive @xmath7-ary relation @xmath8 and no complete graphs on @xmath9 vertices . </S>",

    "<S> we will assume @xmath6 is nontrivial unless otherwise stated .    </S>",

    "<S> the freedom to extend given configurations persists for up to @xmath21 steps before being impeded by an amalgamation constraint .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , what are the implications of our main theorem for keisler s order ?        as the diagram indicates , theorem [ t : seq ]  drawn here according to its full statement in section  </S>",
    "<S> [ s : infinite ] below  may be understood in parallel to the results of @xcite proving that any theory with the strong tree property @xmath22 is already maximal in keisler s order . </S>",
    "<S> the unstable theories admit a natural structure / randomness dichotomy ; any unstable theory either contains something akin to a bipartite random graph ( the `` independence property '' ) or akin to a strict linear ordering ( the `` strict order property '' ) , and possibly both . from the point of view of keisler s order , all linear orders , and indeed any theory with the much weaker property @xmath22 , are in the maximum class , indicated by the large shaded region on the right . the infinite descending sequence of theories we find occurs in a comparatively tiny region of the class of independent or random theories , indicated by the arrow . </S>",
    "<S> this region had appeared , to previous instruments , to be relatively tame . </S>",
    "<S> this new picture supports the striking suggestion , hinted at already in @xcite and @xcite , that keisler s order is tied up with many such structure / randomness dichotomies within instability . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , while linear order ( `` structure '' ) is maximally complex , this framework is able to illuminate significant but previously undetected jumps in the complexity of independence . </S>",
    "<S> the complexity we find here , using the lens of keisler s order , has to do with failures of amalgamation and appears orthogonal to forking .    </S>",
    "<S> we thank h. j. keisler for comments on the manuscript . </S>"
