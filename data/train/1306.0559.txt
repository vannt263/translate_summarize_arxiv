    "the detection of a burst of mev neutrinos that will be produced from a galactic supernova can provide the answers to three important observational questions :    * _ if astronomers should look for a milky way supernova_. a high - statistics neutrino burst would decisively indicate that a core collapse had occurred in the milky way or one of its dwarf companions .",
    "the nature of the electromagnetic transient will depend on the success of the explosion , ranging from a full supernova to something weaker to perhaps something near - impossible to detect ; at present , there is no ongoing optical or ir survey that guarantees rapid detection .",
    "contrariwise , if no neutrinos are detected , then any electromagnetic transient is not a nearby core - collapse ; it might instead be a supernova impostor or a type ia supernova . *",

    "this would provide an early warning that could enable the detection of the sbo signal , the early supernova light curve , and any surprises about the first electromagnetic signals following core collapse . the precise timing will also help the detection of possible gravitational - wave signals , which may be detectable for collapses with adequate deviations from spherical symmetry .",
    "the time - integrated neutrino signal is relatively well known and should have relatively modest variations from one event to another , including the case of failed supernovae with black hole formation . *",
    "_ where astronomers should look_. for a milky way core - collapse , the super  kamiokande detector will be able to exploit the directionality in neutrino - electron scattering to restrict the source direction to within a few degrees .",

    ", this information could be distributed in less than a minute .",
    "this directionality will only be valuable if there is a means to quickly exploit it with wide - field instruments to first narrow the search region and then quickly follow up with more powerful instruments .",
    "optical / near - ir observations will remain a crucial component of studies of galactic sne .",
    "this includes traditional uses such as characterizing the external explosion ( energy , mass , composition , velocity ; e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , and constraining the existence of failed sne @xcite . now that large neutrino detection experiments are running , the next galactic ccsne will also provide an unprecedented opportunity to measure the delay time between neutrino detection and shock breakout , which would probe the density structure of the progenitor @xcite .",

    "@xcite use a similar exercise to infer the galactic sn rate ; their model consists of thin disk , thick disk , and halo components as well as a dust distribution , but no further details are given .",
    "given the improvement in models of the galactic dust distribution , it is worth revisiting the estimates of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we model the sne distribution with a double - exponential disk model using modern estimates of the scale lengths and heights for each population , and model the extinction with a similar double - exponential distribution normalized to the line of sight extinction of modern dust maps .",
    "we present results for both v - band and near - ir observability .",
    "we also fold in the observed luminosity functions of sne and estimate the probability of identifying the sne progenitor in archival data .",
    "we separately consider sne ia and ccsne , since they should have differing spatial distributions , and use our modeled sn observability to infer a galactic supernova rate .",
    "we also predict the observability of the shock breakout and failed supernovae .",

    "two appendices outline observational systems to detect galactic sbo emission even in daytime and for observing extragalactic sbo events within the local volume . throughout the paper we use the vega magnitude system .",
    "the basis of our model is a monte carlo simulation of the positions of galactic sne and their corresponding dust extinctions .",
    "we model the progenitor and dust distributions using the double - exponential spatial distribution @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the galactocentric radius and @xmath17 is the height above the galactic mid - plane . we must define @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 for the dust distribution , the core - collapse supernova ( ccsn ) progenitors , and the type ia ( sn ia ) distribution .",
    "we outline our approach for each of these cases in the following subsections . for these models we use several of the same input parameters as trilegal ( tridimensional model of the galaxy ) , a population synthesis code for simulating stellar populations along any direction through the galaxy @xcite .",
    "the sun is placed @xmath21 pc above the mid - plane of the disk at a galactocentric radius of @xmath22 kpc .",
    "the galactic thin and thick disk components are truncated at @xmath23 kpc .",
    "we assume that dust largely traces star formation , and thus use the scale length of the thin disk for the scale length of the dust distribution .",
    "we adopt a scale length of @xmath24 kpc from the trilegal model .",
    "trilegal uses a scale height of @xmath25 pc for the dust and @xmath26 pc for the thin disk .",
    "while we calculated results for both values , the differences were so small that we only discuss the result for @xmath25 pc .",
    "these choices for the spatial distribution are less critical than the estimated total extinction along any line of sight .",
    "we separately consider four possible normalizations for the total line of sight extinction .",
    "the simplest method we use ( hereafter referred to as simple ) distributes the dust following eqn .",
    "[ eq : exp ] and normalizes the distribution to have @xmath27 to the galactic center . in the remaining models , we distribute the dust along any line of sight following eqn .",
    "[ eq : exp ] , but normalize each line of sight using an empirical model for the total extinction in that direction . in our second model ( sfd98 ) , we normalize the extinction along each line of sight by the total extinction from @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite is believed to overestimate @xmath28 in regions of high extinction @xcite . to account for this ,",
    "we consider a modified sfd98 model ( modsfd98 ) , where we correct the high extinction values following @xcite , such that @xmath29 for @xmath30 and @xmath31 for @xmath32 , @xmath33 which significantly reduces the total extinction in the galactic plane .",
    "since the sfd98 dust maps may be completely problematic in the areas of high extinction found near the galactic midplane ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we also consider a model employing the rayleigh - jeans color excess ( rjce ) extinction map of the galactic midplane presented by @xcite where possible , falling back to the modified sfd98 ( eqn .",
    "[ eq : extinction_fiddle ] ) only in the 17% ( 42% ) of cases where our ccsne ( sne ia ) lay outside of the rjce extinction map footprint .",
    "we note that the rjce extinction map is derived from red giant branch stars which lie within the galaxy , and so only estimates the total extinction out to 18 - 20 kpc from the observer .",
    "this should still represent the total extinction for most of the simulated sn positions . for comparison we also present results that assume no extinction ( no dust ) .",
    "we adopt @xmath34 and @xmath35 following @xcite , with @xmath36 .",
    "the extinction law , the value of @xmath37 at its simplest , is not uniform in the galaxy .",
    "the value of @xmath36 we adopt is an average value ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "dense molecular clouds can have far larger values of @xmath37 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but molecular clouds cover a small fraction of the sky .",
    "dust in lower extinction directions towards the bulge show evidence for an @xmath37 significantly below @xmath38 @xcite , but if extinction is low , the particular value of @xmath37 is unimportant .",
    "readers should be aware of these issues , but they will not dominate our results in any typical direction where extinction is dominated by integrating the normal ism over long sight lines .",
    "we assume that ccsne trace the thin disk and use the thin disk parameters from trilegal ( @xmath24 kpc and @xmath26 pc ) described in  [ sec : dust ] .",
    "the distance probability distribution of ccsne for these parameters is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dcomp ] and the extinction probability distributions of ccsne for the different dust models are displayed in the left panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : acomp ] .",
    "we only present results for this single set of thin disk parameters because , to the extent that dust traces massive star formation , the exact choice of disk parameters is relatively unimportant .",
    "first , if the dust distribution traces the distribution of massive star formation , then the differential distribution of ccsne along a line of sight , @xmath39 , is proportional to the differential of the optical depth along the line of sight , @xmath40 .",
    "thus , if dust traces star formation , the differential distribution of the progenitors in optical depth , @xmath41 , is independent of the line of sight spatial distribution chosen for the ccsne and the dust .",
    "second , any effects from changing the spatial distribution are negligible compared to the differences between the extinction models . for example , consider the effects of adding a spiral arm at 1 kpc with a 1 kpc inter - arm distance .",
    "our model will spread the star formation of that arm uniformly over @xmath42 the inter - arm separation rather than putting it in the arm .",
    "this means we spread the distance modulus by @xmath43 mag at most , which is negligible compared to the effects of the dust distribution . for more distant arms ,",
    "the problem rapidly becomes even smaller , so the detailed 3-d structure of the disk is unimportant to our results .",
    ".[fig : dcomp],width=347 ]    given the distances and extinctions to each supernova position , we calculate the apparent magnitude probability distribution of ccsne .",
    "we first consider a case using a fixed magnitude of @xmath44 and @xmath45 , where the color is a  typical \" value from @xcite .",
    "this simple case allows the reader to easily rescale the observability for arbitrary luminosity and color .",
    "we also present the magnitude distribution obtained by folding in the ccsne luminosity function found by @xcite and use this case for quantitative estimates of the observability of ccsne . while folding in the luminosity function",
    "broadens the resulting magnitude distribution only slightly , this effect is easy to include .",
    "we find the apparent magnitude distribution for the ccsne progenitor population by assuming that the number distribution of the population is given by a salpeter imf ( @xmath46 ) with a minimum mass of @xmath47 and a maximum mass of @xmath48 . to find the progenitor luminosity for a given mass , we rely on an interpolation of the padova isochrones @xcite , taking the progenitor luminosity to be the luminosity of the most massive star left on the isochrone .",
    "other models would yield moderately different results due to differing treatments of mass loss and the transition between being red or blue supergiants and wolf - rayet stars at the time of explosion ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the model dependence of the extinction distribution , rather than the distance distribution , is the primary source of uncertainty in the visibility of sne and their progenitors.[fig : acomp],width=347 ]      @xcite and @xcite find that sne ia progenitors can be described by a bimodal progenitor delay time distribution , with approximately half the sne ia occurring at stellar ages of order 100 myr and the remaining half occurring on gyr timescales .",
    "therefore , we draw our sne ia progenitors equally from the thin disk population used for the dust and ccsne in  [ sec : dust ] and  [ sec : ccsne ] and from a thick disk population with @xmath49 kpc and @xmath50 pc , again following the trilegal parameters .",
    "we note that recent work has advocated a continuous delay time distribution @xcite , but this extra complication seemed unnecessary for our present models . as with the ccsne ,",
    "the distance and extinction probability distributions of sne ia are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : dcomp ] and [ fig : acomp ] .",
    "we give the cumulative magnitude probability density for sne ia of a characteristic magnitude of @xmath51 and @xmath52 @xcite and by folding in the sne ia luminosity function from @xcite , using the results of the latter for quantitative estimates of the observability of sne ia . as for the ccsne ,",
    "the elaboration of including the observed luminosity function is simple but only slightly broadens the resulting magnitude distribution .",
    "the observability of sne or their progenitors located towards the galactic center may be reduced by confusion .",
    "we will discuss confusion only in relation to the progenitors of ccsne since the nature of sn ia progenitors is debated .",
    "we note , however , that current searches for binary companions to sn ia in the galaxy and lmc are primarily limited by the difficulties in inferring the position of the sn from the geometry of the remnant ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the position of any new sn ia would be directly measured , greatly simplifying the search for either the progenitor or a surviving companion , donor star . to estimate the effect of confusion in the near - ir",
    ", we measured the density of sources brighter than @xmath53 in the 2mass catalog @xcite towards each simulated progenitor position .",
    "we then extrapolate the integrated surface density , @xmath54 , based on a power law , @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the apparent magnitude of the progenitor , @xmath57 is the power law index , and @xmath58 is the source density to the limiting magnitude .",
    "we estimated @xmath59 by fitting the slope of the log of the number of sources in the 2mass catalog for different limiting magnitudes at different coordinates .",
    "we followed a similar procedure for estimating the effect of confusion in the v - band .",
    "we measured the density of sources brighter than @xmath60 in the usno - b1.0 catalog @xcite towards each simulated progenitor position , with rough @xmath61 magnitudes estimated from the photographic @xmath16 and @xmath62 magnitudes by the relation @xmath63 .",
    "we extrapolate the integrated surface density of sources in v - band by @xmath64 , where we have estimated that @xmath65 . while the available data are not ideal for these estimates , they should be adequate . for each monte carlo realization , the probability , @xmath66 , of finding a source with @xmath67 within a given radius of the target is @xmath68 .",
    "the first electromagnetic signature from a sn is not the familiar rise to peak and then decline over weeks or months , but a short flash of radiation as the shock wave  breaks out \" from the surface of the star . while this sbo phenomenon also occurs in sne ia , we focus on ccsne because sne ia do not emit a ( currently ) detectable neutrino signal that could be used to trigger a search @xcite and the shock breakout from a white dwarf would be much fainter than that from a massive star @xcite .",
    "the breakout pulse from ccsne has only been observed a few times ( grb 060218/sn 2006aj , xrt 080109/sn 2008d , and snls-04d2dc ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",

    "the search for a pulse lasting seconds to hours occurring minutes to days after a neutrino or gravitational wave trigger is challenging for observers based on a rotating earth orbiting a bright star and embedded in a dusty galactic disk .    as a simple approximation for the sbo properties we adopt the @xmath70 ( radiative ) polytrope model of @xcite , similar to the recent work by @xcite .",
    "fixing the explosion energy at @xmath71 erg , simply using thomson opacities and defining the luminosity as the characteristic energy divided by the characteristic time scale , we obtain order of magnitude estimates that @xmath72 and @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the mass of the progenitor , @xmath77 is the mass of the ejecta assuming a neutron star is formed , and @xmath16 is the progenitor radius . combined with our model for the progenitor properties ( see  [ sec : progenitor ] ) , this leads to the predicted distribution of the peak absolute magnitudes of the sbo shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sbo_mag ] if we assume the radiation is thermalized to a blackbody spectrum .",
    "this is an important assumption ( see , e.g. , the discussion in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and requires careful consideration as part of any full design study of our proposal for a galactic sbo detection system in appendix [ app : one ] or extragalactic sbo detection system in appendix [ app : two ] .",
    "@xcite find that the sbo radiation has a shallower spectral slope at low energies than blackbody radiation , meaning that the sbo optical and ir luminosities we present in  [ sec : observing_sbo ] assuming a blackbody spectrum should be taken as lower limits .",

    "* ) , these recent results suggest that the phenomenon is more common than the earlier view that it would be restricted to very high mass stars in low metallicity galaxies .",
    "the upper limit on the fraction of ccsn that fail to explode is @xmath80 with a nominal estimate of @xmath81 @xcite .",
    "it is perfectly feasible to search for such failed sn based on electromagnetic signatures because in the final analysis a massive , luminous star effectively vanishes , potentially with some interim transient @xcite . in the galaxy one has the added advantage that neutrinos will clearly indicate that a core collapse has occurred .",
    "@xcite pointed out that the envelopes of red supergiants in this mass range are so tenuously bound that the drop in gravitational potential energy due to the binding energy carried by the escaping neutrinos during core collapse is sufficient to unbind the envelope .",
    "recently , @xcite have simulated the process using realistic models of @xmath82 and @xmath83 red supergiants and confirmed the effect .",
    "the external signature consists of an sbo , followed by a roughly year long transient with a luminosity of @xmath84 and an apparent temperature of order @xmath85  k as the envelope expands , cools , and releases the energy associated with recombination . because the shock velocities of @xmath86  km / s are much lower than for a true sn , the shock breakout pulse is both much weaker and much cooler .",

    "we then provide new information on the alert procedure of the super  kamiokande collaboration .",
    "most importantly , we also provide the first announcement of a new fast - response capability using the egads experiment .",
    "the case of sn 1987a is instructive for defining the main issues @xcite .",
    "the neutrinos were detected a few hours before the deduced start of the electromagnetic signals , though this was not realized until later . at the time ,",
    "the world first became aware of the event through optical detections of the early light curve @xcite , which were fortuitous and might have been missed until the supernova became brighter .",
    "the neutrinos were easily detected even though the detectors of that time were relatively small and the large magellanic cloud is about five times farther than a typical milky way supernova ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : dcomp ] ) .",
    "the progenitor star was detected in archival images @xcite , and little information was available on possible variations in its pre - explosion luminosity ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the sbo and the earliest supernova light curve were also undetected .",
    "for the next milky way supernova , neutrinos should serve as the starting gun indicating that the race is on to characterize this once - in - a - generation event in detail across many timescales and electromagnetic bands . the key advantage of neutrinos , besides answering the three questions above and thus possibly allowing one last look at the undisturbed star just before it is destroyed , is that they can reveal the conditions and dynamics deep within the star .",
    "a primary goal that we emphasize is to catch not just the early supernova light curve , but also the sbo that precedes it .",
    "this will require getting alerts , times , and directions from the neutrino experiments far more rapidly than envisaged by the current system . some of the present detectors are considerably larger and all have much swifter data processing than those in 1987 , but existing data - sharing plans may still lead to crucial lost opportunities .",
    "the protoneutron star formed after core collapse is nearly at nuclear density and is at a central temperature of tens of mev .",
    "it sheds almost all of its energy by radiating neutrinos , mostly through neutrino pair - production processes ( the neutronization process @xmath194 corresponds to only @xmath193 of the total neutrino emission ) . because the density is so high , even neutrinos have difficulty escaping from the proto - neutron star , and they diffuse out over several seconds with a spectrum characteristic of the temperature , @xmath195 , at the surface of last scattering , typically a few mev .",
    "there are thought to be differences between the six neutrino flavors ( @xmath196 , @xmath197 , @xmath198 , and their antiparticles ) in terms of their total and average energies , but it is a reasonable simplification to say that each flavor should carry about 1/6 of the binding energy release of @xmath199 erg and have an average energy of @xmath200 mev .",
    "core collapses are extremely efficient neutrino generators and the neutrinos carry about @xmath92 times more energy than the eventual optical supernova .",
    "all smaller , less efficient explosions can not possibly produce enough neutrinos to be reliably detected .",
    "the neutrino emission from a type ia supernova arises just from accelerated nuclear burning , is much more modest , and does not include the most detectable flavor , @xmath201 .",
    "supernova impostors , if they really are just non - destructive outbursts of massive stars , should produce essentially no neutrinos . for collapses that lead to black hole production and little or no electromagnetic emission , the time - integrated neutrino signals are similar , essentially because the thermal energy of the hot proto - neutron star must be lost before the final collapse @xcite .",
    "black - hole forming events will show a distinctive truncation of the neutrino signal in time @xcite , which would be very relevant for the subsequent electromagnetic searches .",
    "the most important supernova neutrino detection reaction is inverse beta decay , @xmath202 , where the proton is a hydrogen nucleus ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the total energy of the outgoing positron is @xmath203 , and its direction is nearly isotropic because of the small recoil energy of the nucleon .",
    "there are also interactions with electrons and with nucleons bound in nuclei , but they have smaller cross sections and less favorable kinematics for the detectable particles in the final states .",
    "the super  kamiokande detector @xcite in japan has a nominal fiducial volume of 22.5 kton of ultra - pure water , and for a core collapse at the milky way center , super ",
    "kamiokande expects to detect @xmath204 inverse beta events over several seconds , with a negligible number of background events .",
    "the reconstruction directions of these neutrino events will be nearly isotropic @xcite .",

    "could in principle be estimated with percent - level precision ; however , uncertainties in the emission models will likely restrict this to a few tens of percent .",
    "the icecube detector is vastly larger than super  kamiokande but has a very high detector background rate , which means that individual neutrino interactions can not be separated from non - neutrino events .",
    "nevertheless , for a core collapse in the milky way , the number of neutrino interactions would be so large in such a short time that icecube would see a highly significant increase in the apparent  background \" rate , yielding an unambiguous detection @xcite .",

    "kamiokande should be able to constrain the direction to a galactic ccsn to within a few degrees @xcite .",
    "the prospects for directionality from timing triangulation using multiple detectors are poor , due to the long timescales and low statistics relative to the earth - crossing time @xcite .      as the neutrinos",
    "are generated and arrive at earth before any electromagnetic signals , there will be a brief period , hours at most , during which the detected neutrinos are the only indication , other than gravitational waves , of an ongoing core collapse event .",
    "this places a high burden of responsibility on the neutrino experiments to announce as much information as soon as possible .    on the other hand , milky way core collapses are so rare that false signals , perhaps related to detector electronics , may occur during the decades - long waits .",
    "this gives a strong motivation to the experimentalists to be very careful to avoid announcing possibly false signals .",
    "the human intervention required to have adequate confidence may take hours .    there lies peril on both sides : the consequences of failing to react swiftly to a true signal or of raising a false alarm could be quite detrimental to the reputation of the neutrino experiments .",
    "of these two unpleasant scenarios , however , avoiding even the possibility of issuing a false alarm has traditionally been of greater concern to experimentalists .",
    "none of the present detectors , with the possible exception of baksan @xcite , has ever seen a core - collapse neutrino burst .",
    "couple this with the difficulty inherent in devising a calibration method with which to properly mimic uniformly volume - distributed , sn - like light in the detectors , and the problem becomes evident : how can an experimental collaboration rapidly muster sufficient confidence that what they are seeing is , in fact , a supernova , and get the word out to astronomers in time to catch the sbo ?      in an early attempt to get around the problem of false alarms and to get word out quickly , a few of the world s supernova neutrino detectors have banded together via the supernova early warning system , snews @xcite .",
    "the essential idea is simple : if a participating detector believes it is seeing a supernova neutrino burst , it sends the time of the start of the burst ( and any other data it wishes to release ) to a central server .",
    "if several geographically separated detectors report a burst within a certain period then an automated alert is sent to a pre - determined , open subscription email list .",
    "snews has been operating in one configuration or another since 1998 with between two and four detectors in the network .",
    "it currently contains super  kamiokande , icecube , borexino , and lvd .    in order to avoid false alarms and potential embarrassment of the experimental collaborations , by binding agreement ,",
    "no information whatsoever is ever released unless the snews coincidence threshold determined by the number of participating detectors is reached .",
    "in addition , the false alarm rate of individual participating detectors is required to be low enough  roughly once per month  that random false coincidences should occur less than once per century .",
    "detectors which for any reason temporarily exceed this agreed upon rate are excluded during that period from participating in coincidences .",
    "unfortunately , the statistics are such that based upon arrival times and size of the burst alone  which is all the participating experiments have agreed to release prior to human review  the direction of the burst can not be located @xcite , relegating snews to serve as a wakeup call for those who have signed up .",
    "furthermore , given the limited number of participating collaborations , their overriding desire to avoid false positives , and the resulting strict coincidence conditions , there is inevitably some risk of a false snews negative .",
    "ironically , the magnitude of this important risk can not be known due to the nondisclosure agreements regarding individual detector performance ( i.e. , uptime fraction and false alarm rate ) that made snews possible in the first place .      while it is critical to get the directional information out as soon as possible , only super ",
    "kamiokande will have quality pointing data  a few - degree error circle  for a burst anywhere in the milky way .",

    "near - realtime data analysis processes identify a sudden burst of supernova neutrino - like events in the detector , within approximately two minutes an alert containing the time of the burst is sent to snews .",
    "these processes also initiate a specific , pre - arranged , and rehearsed procedure .",
    "automated phone calls are placed to the surge members as well as the experiment s spokesman and other executive committee members , about twenty people in all .",
    "burst data in various forms are also sent to their mobile phones for review .",
    "a video conference is convened within 15 minutes of the burst s detection , during which the operating condition of the detector is verified , key plots are discussed , and characteristic event displays are shown .",
    "if it is agreed that a real supernova has been detected , the rest of the collaboration is notified via email and pre - worded announcements are sent to iau and atel .",
    "these telegrams contain the universal time of the start of the burst , its duration , how many neutrinos above 7 mev were observed during that time , the right ascension and declination of the radiant , and the errors on the fitted direction .",
    "this is all designed to take place in an hour or less .",
    "drills are held to work out sticking points in the procedure and speed up the entire process as much as possible .",
    "nevertheless , it is clear that the experiment s very careful , very responsible , hands - on approach to building the locally required level of confidence and consensus means that super  kamiokande can not issue its supernova alert as quickly as would be ideal .",
    "how can we build the confidence needed to get the announcement response time of even a single neutrino detector below the one - minute mark , while simultaneously minimizing the risk of both false positives and false negatives ?    presently , the super  kamiokande detector can only detect the positrons in the inverse beta decay reaction , @xmath207 .",
    "if we could detect the neutrons in coincidence , then we could greatly increase the certainty that a supernova was occurring , as there are very few physics processes that could mimic this coincident signal , and none that could fake a burst of many such events . as was first pointed out some years ago @xcite , adding",
    "a 0.2% solution of a water - soluble gadolinium compound like gadolinium chloride or gadolinium sulfate to light water cherenkov detectors would allow such coincident detection , within displacements of centimeters in space and tens of microseconds in time .",
    "gadolinium has a thermal neutron capture cross section of 49,000 barns ( about 5 orders of magnitude larger than that of protons ) and emits a gamma cascade of 8 mev that can be easily detected by detectors like super  kamiokande .",
    "this assertion has since been verified in the super  kamiokande detector itself via the use of a gadolinium - loaded calibration source @xcite .    in an effort to prove that a gadolinium - enriched super ",

    "egads will be converted  primarily via upgraded daq electronics , addition of computing sufficient for 100% real - time event reconstruction , and improved calibration  from an r&d testbed to a dedicated supernova neutrino detector . as part of this process",

    "one second _ of the first neutrino s arrival in the tank .",
    "the confidence required to do this is provided by the gadolinium loading .",
    "if the `` heartbeat '' signature of several coincident inverse beta decay events is seen , the double flash of positron cherenkov light quickly followed by neutron capture gammas from the same spot in the detector , then a milky way burst is most assuredly under way and can be announced immediately without human intervention .",
    "this data will have no directionality unless there is an especially close event ( egads would see @xmath13100,000 events from betelgeuse ) . while officially a standalone , independently - funded project distinct from super  kamiokande , all the members of the considerably smaller egads collaboration are in fact members of both collaborations .",
    "what is more , the pi of the r&d - phase egads ( masayuki nakahata ) and the pi of the supernova detector - phase egads ( mrv , one of this paper s authors ) are both members of surge and are the co - conveners of super  kamiokande s solar and supernova neutrino analysis group .",
    "it is therefore hoped that an immediate , positive supernova detection in egads will supply the neighboring super  kamiokande , even if it has not yet been enriched with gadolinium itself , with sufficient confidence to react much more quickly in releasing its critical directional information . with egads , or a similar solution to the problem of timeliness , and a modest investment as outlined in appendix [ app : one ] , there is no fundamental barrier to observing even the short ephemeral sbo signature of a galactic ccsn .",

    "while @xmath213 galactic sn are of the core - collapse variety @xcite , we note that a galactic sn ia is likely to be appear brighter than a ccsn because sne ia are intrinsically brighter than ccsne and their spatial distribution has a larger scale height , which results in less average line - of - sight extinction .",
    "although a galactic sn ia would not produce a ( currently ) detectable neutrino signal to trigger a search , we find that 92% will have @xmath101 , which is within the limits of current all sky surveys , and if the large synoptic survey telescope ( lsst ) monitors the galactic plane over 99% of sn ia would be detected .",
    "we use our modeled observability of galactic sne , together with the record of historical sne , to estimate the rate of galactic sne , the ratio of galactic core - collapse to type ia sne , and the galactic sfr .",

    "we in turn use this galactic ccsn rate to infer a galactic sfr of @xmath8 m@xmath9yr@xmath10 .    combining the upper limit placed by the non - detection of sn neutrinos over @xmath190 years of measurements by neutrino detection experiments @xcite of @xmath191 core - collapses / century with our inferred luminous ccsn rate allows us to place weak limits on both the rate of core - collapse events and the fraction of such events that fail to produce normal , luminous ccsne ( see fig .",
    "[ fig - failed_vs_rcc ] ) .",
    "this limit on the fraction of core - collapse events that fail to explode is consistent with the upper limit of @xmath192 found by @xcite and the nominal estimate of @xmath193 given by @xcite .",
    "we show that a galactic ccsn could provide a unique opportunity to obtain detailed observations of the sn shock breakout .",
    "we present expected absolute and apparent magnitude probability distributions for the sbo .",
    "we also consider the possibility of detecting the weak sbo of a failed sn occurring when a red supergiant s envelope becomes unbound after its core undergoes a direct collapse to a black hole .",
    "while failed sne from other progenitors ( such as blue supergiants or wolf - rayet stars ) would not produce this sort of signal , we show that those following the red supergiant models of @xcite and @xcite would be even easier to detect in the near - ir than the sbos of normal ccsne .",
    "we note that given the scale of investment in neutrino detection , a dedicated day and night ir sbo detection system could be built and operated at moderate cost ( see appendix [ app : one ] ) and that the existence of such a system could further reduce the potential embarrassment of false detections  it would simply represent another layer of the overall trigger system .",
    "since the sbos of normal sne occur on timescales ranging from minutes to a couple of days after the neutrino burst , it is of paramount importance that neutrino detection experiments provide directional information in near real - time in order for an electromagnetic detection of the sbo to be possible .",
    "we describe the procedure super  kamiokande will follow in the event of a sn detection before releasing this information .",
    "we further describe egads , a system that will provide instant galactic sn alerts .",
    "we also present an outline for a system capable of detecting extragalactic sn sbos ( see appendix [ app : two ] ) that could better cue searches for neutrino bursts that could not be detected directly .",
    "we also model the observability of likely ccsn progenitors .",
    "we find that @xmath214 already have near - ir imaging ( with 2mass ) , but only @xmath215 have v - band imaging ( in the usno - b1.0 catalog ) .",
    "a lack of optical imaging of the progenitor would limit our ability to characterize its temperature and luminosity .",
    "however , the enormous extinction towards the galactic center will make it difficult to substantially increase the fraction of likely progenitors imaged in v - band .",
    "we also consider the potential for observing precursor outbursts , but find that current all - sky surveys are not likely to observe such events .",
    "we note that lsst ( if it images the galactic plane ) or a shallow near - ir all - sky survey would be capable of monitoring a majority of likely progenitors for precursor variability . unfortunately , lsst presently plans to largely ignore the galactic plane , which , as recently discussed by @xcite , may be a suboptimal strategy .",
    "this paper shows that the astronomical community could make important observations of the stages leading up to and including the traditional sn light curve of the next galactic sn . however , there are steps that must be taken by astronomers and neutrino experimentalists working together to insure that the next rare opportunity to observe a galactic sn is not squandered .",

    "here we outline a rough design for an instrument capable of detecting galactic sn shock breakout bursts even in daytime .",
    "this particular design minimizes cost at the price of sensitivity .",
    "sensitivity can be rapidly gained using a larger aperture at the cost of a smaller field of view or more detectors . while the shock breakout pulse peaks in the far - uv / x - ray , a search for a galactic breakout pulse should be done in the near - ir because of galactic extinction and the brightness of the daytime sky .",
    "as noted earlier , we are making assumptions about the thermalization of the sbo radiation , but based on @xcite they are conservative .",
    "we consider an 86  mm aperture , 300  mm focal length , short wavelength ir ( swir ) lens with a 20.5  mm focal plane corresponding to a 3.9  degree field of view ( an optec ob - swir300/3.5 swir lens ) .",
    "we then use a flir systems ingaas @xmath216 detector ( a tau swir bp detector ) with 25@xmath217 m pixels .",
    "this provides a @xmath218  degree field of view with @xmath219  arcsec pixels that is well - matched to the positional uncertainties expected from super  kamiokande ( see  [ sec : neutrino_detection ] ) .",
    "the detector qe ( 80% ) and optical through - puts ( 50% ) are not grossly dissimilar from those of an astronomical infrared instrument , but the read noise and well depths are much higher ( @xmath220 and @xmath221  e@xmath222 , respectively ) , and the detector can be read with a frame time of 30  hz . if we scale from the lucifer exposure time calculator for the large binocular telescope @xcite , we expect 7500 and 18000 counts / second for j / h=6  mag .",
    "however , with the large pixels , the sky count rates are @xmath223 and @xmath224/second , respectively , so to avoid saturation one would operate near the maximum frame rate .",
    "mag per square arcsec @xcite . ] for these nominal parameters , the signal - to - noise ratio is roughly @xmath225 or @xmath226 , for a source with a j or h magnitude of @xmath227 and an integration time of @xmath228 seconds .",
    "the lens and detectors are of moderate estimated price ( @xmath22940,000 ) , so it would be entirely feasible to set up a system that would have a high probability of detecting the shock breakout pulse of the next galactic supernova in either day or night time ( unless the sn occurred at a very small sun angle ) by distributing several such systems around the globe .",
    "four such facilities to cover north / south , east / west , and weather would provide a reasonably high probability of success . the system would also supply a continuous near - ir variability survey of the galaxy . note that such a system requires the directional information supplied by super ",
    "kamiokande to detect the sbo , although on longer time scales it could search the galactic plane for a sn with no neutrino pointing information .",
    "this particular design sketch is meant to minimize cost while maintaining a field of view comparable to the localization accuracies of neutrino and gravitational wave detectors ( see  [ sec : observing_sbo ] ) .",
    "sensitivity scales with aperture , @xmath230 , as @xmath231 , so increasing the aperture rapidly increases the sensitivity .",
    "the price is either a reduced field of view , requiring a scanning strategy until the sbo is identified , or a significantly more expensive detection module . in theory",
    ", existing wide - field ir instruments can make such surveys in daytime if narrow band filters can sufficiently reduce the count rates and there is a means of maintaining thermal stability , but the control , scheduling , and safety concerns for these facilities are likely problematic .",
    "moreover , a sbo detection system run by a neutrino detector group can simply be regarded as part of the overall system , allowing it to internally operate at a triggering rate viewed as unacceptably high for public announcements .",
    "megaton - class neutrino detectors are capable of detecting small numbers of neutrinos from ccsn out to roughly 10  mpc @xcite .",
    "the ccsn rate at these distances is dominated by roughly 40 galaxies , representing 90% of the local rate of 1 - 2/year @xcite .",
    "the key issue for flagging a small number of neutrino events is to narrow the temporal search window so that there is a negligible probability of background events in the window .",
    "narrowing the temporal search window would similarly improve the sensitivity of gravitational wave detectors .",
    "@xcite show that given a well - sampled early - time light curve , particularly one which has some information on the shock breakout signal , the time of the core collapse can be estimated to within hours .",
    "the problem , however , is that the short sbo durations mean that normal surveys are unlikely to catch the breakout pulse except by chance . in this sense , the @xcite emphasis on the importance of finding shock breakouts has the problem backwards ",
    "you want to use a high sensitivity survey for breakout pulses to trigger searches in the low sensitivity neutrino or gravity wave detectors rather than the reverse .",
    "it is feasible to simply monitor all or some of these galaxies for shock breakout events , but it requires a fairly industrial approach to the problem . at 10  mpc , and again assuming the radiation thermalizes , the @xmath232  mag optical sbo events ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sbo_mag ] ) are easily accessible using off - the - shelf equipment .",
    "for example , a 12.5 in planewave telescope with an sbig stxl-1102 camera has a roughly @xmath233 degree field of view that basically covers all the relevant galaxies except m  31 and m  33 in a single exposure and would have @xmath234 at @xmath235 in 60 seconds for a price on the order $ 35,000 per unit after including a paramount me robotic mount and a control computer .",
    "based on the winer observatory , an additional $ 10,000/year would provide space in an existing dome and basic servicing needs .",
    "thus , for an overall system with @xmath236 units , the hardware costs are roughly $ 1,000,000 ( assuming a modest discount from list prices given the scale of the order ) with direct operating costs of order $ 300,000/year .",
    "the telescopes need to be sited relatively uniformly in longitude , with a greater emphasis on the north .",
    "while we did not attempt a detailed optimization , we experimented with the achievable completeness defined by the fraction of the local sn rate which could be monitored at a given cadence .",
    "the rates for each galaxy were set following @xcite based on the galaxy type and absolute magnitude .",
    "we located equal numbers of telescopes at 8 existing observatory sites ( canaries , cerro tololo , hawaii , kitt peak , maidanak , siding spring , sutherland and xinglong station ) and assumed a random and uncorrelated 30% of days were cloudy .",
    "telescopes were assigned to the un - observed , visible ( after @xmath237 twilight , airmass @xmath238 ) galaxy with the highest estimated sn rate .",
    "for a one minute cadence , needed to try to catch breakout events from blue supergiants ( sn  87a , type  iib , type  ib ) , systems with 8 , 16 , 24 , 32 and 40 telescopes achieved 11 , 20 , 26 , 31 and 35% completeness .",
    "for a 5 minute cadence , which would miss most breakouts from blue supergiants but monitor those from red supergiants well , the fractions are 19 , 33 , 40 , 45 and 48% . in practice ,",
    "systems with larger numbers of telescopes have significant `` idle time '' on a strict 5 minute cadence , so there would be significant numbers of observations on shorter time baselines . with 8 sites , our 30% uncorrelated weather losses have negligible effects on the coverage fraction .",
    "it is clear , however , that an optimized design would use still more sites since allowing observations all the way down to the horizon raises the ( 5 minute ) fractions to 31 , 51 , 61 , 69 and 74% respectively .",
    "since there is no need for superb image quality ( darkness , cloud cover and bandwidth are the more relevant criteria ) , we will assume that an optimized system of 32 telescopes can achieve 60% coverage for type  ii ( red supergiant ) breakout shocks .",
    "while some breakout shocks from blue or wolf - rayet stars will be detected , they would not be well sampled .",
    "since type  ii sne then represent @xmath239 of the overall sn rate @xcite , the system would detect shock breakouts from roughly @xmath240 of local sn .",
    "the average rate from these galaxies is somewhat uncertain , but is in the range of @xmath241-@xmath242  sn / year , so the system would detect one breakout event every @xmath243-@xmath225 years .",
    "while the yield is far lower than the uv spacecraft proposed by @xcite , the costs are also much lower and the system will find the closest sn , for which there is the greatest likelihood of a neutrino detection ."
