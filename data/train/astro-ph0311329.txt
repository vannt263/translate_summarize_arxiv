    "the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) polarization observations measured thomson optical depth @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) ( kogut 2003 ) , requiring a full reionization to have occured first at @xmath9 , such as in the double reionization picture ( cen 2003a ) .",
    "this high thomson optical depth is further confirmed by a variety of combined data sets ( tegmark 2003 ) . to ionize the universe at such a high redshift demands both a high formation efficient ( @xmath10 ) for population iii stars and a large escape fraction ( @xmath11 ) for the produced ionizing photons .",
    "quantitatively , one would require the product of the two to be greater than @xmath12 in order to produce @xmath13 ( e.g. , cen 2003b ; haiman & holder 2003 ; wyithe & loeb 2003 ; ciardi , ferrara & white 2003 ; ricotti & ostriker 2003 ) to be consistent with the wmap observations at @xmath14 level .",
    "conventional wisdom may view these assumptions somewhat too optimistic at first sight .    in this _",
    "we suggest that star formation at high redshift ( @xmath0 ) may occur in massive starbursts , triggered by supersonic collisions between constituent cold atomic clouds and blastwaves produced by explosions of first stars .",
    "the consequences are ( 1 ) high star formation efficiency and ( 2 ) high ionizing photon escape fraction .",
    "the slope of density power spectrum is @xmath15 in the cold dark matter cosmological models . as a result",
    ", galaxies over a wide range of mass , @xmath16 of interest here at high redshift , are expected to form nearly simultaneously , when they form .",
    "this would imply that large galaxies of mass @xmath17 ( virial temperature @xmath18k at @xmath0 ) , have most of their mass in small clouds , which are formerly minihalos .",
    "how much mass of a large galaxy is in minihalos ? this is computable approximately using the extended press - schechter ( eps ) theory ( bond 1991 ; bower 1991 ; lacey & cole 1993 , lc hereafter ) .",
    "we use the instantaneous merger rate for a halo of mass @xmath19 to merger with a halo of mass @xmath20 to form a halo of mass @xmath21 ( lc ) : @xmath22 } dm,\\ ] ] where @xmath23 is the density variance of a sphere in the linear density field extrapolated to @xmath24 that contains mass @xmath21 ; @xmath25 is @xmath23 for mass @xmath19 ; @xmath26 is the critical density for collapse ( equation 2.1 of lc ) ; @xmath27 is age of the universe at the epoch examined . the total mass accretion / merger rate of halos of mass in the range @xmath28 to @xmath29 to form a halo of mass @xmath21 at @xmath27 is then @xmath30 figure 1 shows the mass fraction of accreted objects in the mass range @xmath31 by a large halo with @xmath32 as a function of redshift .",
    "we see that @xmath33 of all mass in large galaxies with virial temperature greater than @xmath1k at @xmath0 are in minihalos .",
    "the standard wmap - normalized cold dark matter model ( spergel 2003 ) is used : @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37km / s / mpc , @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "the constituent minihalos do not remain intact in the process of infall and virialization .",
    "first consider the effect due to gravitational tidal field of the large , host halo on minihalos .",
    "for simplicity we will assume that all dark matter halos are singular isothermal spheres truncated at the respective virial radii , @xmath40 for @xmath41 , where @xmath42 , @xmath43 is the mean density of the universe at that redshift and @xmath44 is the virial radius . for illustration",
    "we will consider a large halo of mass @xmath45 at @xmath46 having a virial temperature of @xmath47k .",
    "we assume that @xmath48 of the total mass of the large halo were originally from minihalos ( see figure 1 ) , and all minihalos have the same mass of @xmath49 with a virial temperature of @xmath50k , totaling @xmath51 such minihalos in the large halo .",
    "we denote the virial radius of the large halo as @xmath52 ( @xmath53kpc proper ) and that of the minihalos as @xmath54 ( @xmath55kpc proper ) .",
    "then , a minihalo at radius @xmath56 from the center of the large halo would have its matter exterior to @xmath57 be tidally stripped off .",
    "the mean collision rate between minihalos ( ignoring gravitational focus due to high speed ) is @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the cross section of a minihalo at radius @xmath56 ; @xmath60 is the number density of minihalos at radius @xmath56 ; @xmath61 is the velocity of each minihalo .",
    "assuming also an isothermal distribution of minihalos , @xmath62 , we have @xmath63 this result is obtained only considering the gravitational tidal effect .",
    "let us now consider the effect due to external inter - minihalo medium ( imm ) on the internal gas of minihalos .",
    "consider a minihalo located at @xmath52 .",
    "the imm with @xmath64k and a density of @xmath65 has a pressure higher than the minihalo gas with @xmath66k and a density of @xmath67 .",
    "hence , the gas density in minihalo would be raised by adiabatic compression by the external gas by a factor of @xmath68 and the temperature increases by a factor of @xmath69 , resulting in a pressure equilibrium ( ignoring self - gravity of a minihalo for this simple calculation ) .",
    "the compression would reduce the cross section by a factor of @xmath69 ( a better treatment will be using virial theorem with external pressure but is not given here ) .",
    "the percentage reduction in cross section at other radii is the same .",
    "thus , the average collision time between minihalos is @xmath70 where the minihalo clouds in the large halo are assumed to move at a velocity equal to @xmath71 ( @xmath72 is 1-d the velocity dispersion of the large halo for our illustrated case ) .",
    "it is seen that the collision time among minihalos is about @xmath73 of the age of the universe at @xmath46 .",
    "the time it takes for a minihalo to cross the large halo is @xmath74yr .",
    "thus , on average , a minihalo experiences a collision for every crossing time .",
    "gas within minihalos may be stripped off by ram pressure when traveling through the imm of the large host halo . applying the same physical argument of gunn & gott ( 1972 ) , if the gravitational restoring force of a minihalo is exceeded by ram pressure force , gas and dark matter of the minihalo",
    "will be displaced , i.e. , gas being stripped off .",
    "this may be expressed by the condition @xmath75 , where @xmath76 is the density of the imm ; @xmath77 is the traveling velocity of the minihalo ; @xmath78 is the mean density of a gas parcel of the minihalo in question ; @xmath79 is the 3-d velocity dispersion of the minihalo .",
    "we see that this condition is similar to the pressure equilibrium condition above ( without considering the self - gravity of minihalos ) .",
    "thus , ram pressure stripping is relevant and likely to act at the same time when the cloud is compressed by external thermal pressure .",
    "it is possible that gas in outmost layers of a minihalo may be subject to ram pressure stripping while most interior gas will not be dislodged .",
    "we will ignore the change to @xmath80 ( equation 5 ) possibly caused by ram pressure stripping , because other effects such as deformation of minihalo gas clouds may easily dominate but are hard to characterize simply .",
    "what would happen in a head - on collision between two clouds of cold gas ?",
    "smith ( 1980 ) and struck - marcell ( 1982a , b ) have studied this issue of cloud collision inside galaxies for different ranges of mach numbers using both analytic method and simulations , in somewhat different environments . here",
    "we focus on the thermodynamic properties of post - shock gas , computed assuming that post - shock region is isobaric , while leaving detailed treatment to future 3-d hydrodynamic simulations .",
    "all cooling / heating processes for a primordial gas are incorporated , including atomic cooling , 2 formation and cooling and compton cooling with the rates from abel ( 1997 ) .",
    "radiation background is assumed to exert no significant effect , as shown by mac low & shull ( 1986 ) in the context of intergalactic shocks , which are physically similar to collision - induced shocks considered here .",
    "figure 2 shows the evolution of the postshock gas following a head - on collision between two cold atomic gas clouds .",
    "note that the time for the shock to propagate through an entire cloud is @xmath81yr .",
    "since the shock heated cloud has already cooled to a much lower temperature and the jeans mass has become much smaller than the total baryonic mass of the merged cloud at a time scale shorter than for the shock to transverse the entire cloud , the subsequent rarefaction wave following the thermalization ( shock ) process is insignificant , so are the compression and expansion phases following that .",
    "this indicates that the isobaric assumption is approximately valid and our simple calculation should have captured the essence of the process .",
    "we see that a molecular hydrogen fraction of @xmath82 is reached and gas is cooled to @xmath83k within a fraction of the hubble time after the collision ( @xmath84yr ) .",
    "the final jeans mass is about @xmath85 , indicating that stars formed may be massive . one interesting difference in terms of star formation between this picture and that of abel ( 2001 ) is that multiple stars , possibly a star cluster , may form , which , unlike in a single star case of abel ( 2001 ) , may provide an additional mechanism to remove the angular momentum of the collapsing gas through orbital coupling .    in summary",
    ", supersonic collisions between cold atomic gas clouds within large halos can trigger star formation and star formation efficiency may be quite high , because a large portion of the colliding clouds may be able to cool and form stars .",
    "the spatially distributed star formation will be much more favorable to the escape of ionizing photons .",
    "the possible spread in time among collisions may be @xmath86yr , longer than the lifetime of massive first stars of @xmath87yr .",
    "thus , it is likely that collisions between minihalo clouds can not be considered coeval .",
    "consider two possible scenarios .",
    "in the first scenario , the first stars were so massive that they end their lives imploding and display no explosive events , for example , if the stars are more massive than @xmath88 and non - rotating ( rakavy , shaviv , & zinamon 1967 ; bond , arnett , & carr 1984 ; glatzel , fricke , & el eid 1985 ; woosley 1986 ) , the subsequent star formation in collisions that follow would proceed normally .",
    "star formation efficiency should be high and so is the ionizing photon escape fraction , since star formation will be spatially distributed and extended ( see below ) .    in the second scenario , first stars end in explosions and launch a blastwave .",
    "before computing the dynamics of blastwaves from the explosion of first stars , let us first consider the photoionization effect by the first stars on non - star - forming minihalos , before blastwave encompassing them .",
    "the ionizing photons from the massive stars formed in collisions will propagate outward from the minihalo . since the ionization front ( assuming an ionizing photon emissivity of @xmath89photons  s@xmath90  @xmath91 ; bromm , kudritzki , & loeb 2001 ) travels at a velocity of @xmath92km / s ( assuming no attenuation up to distance @xmath93 from the emitting source ) , much faster than the sound speed in photoionized gas , an r - type ionization front thus develops .",
    "subsequently , a sound wave ( not a shockwave ) will develop driving the ionized gas outward at the sound speed , which would travel @xmath94kpc ( @xmath95 ) in the lifetime of the massive stars . as a result",
    ", the gas density immediately surrounding the stars will be much reduced .",
    "given that the expansion distance is comparable to the original minihalo radius one may expect that the final gas distribution surrounding the stars at the end of their lives may have a density comparable to mean density of the original minihalo . without detailed simulations we resort to some order of magnitude estimates .",
    "let us assume that the clumping factor of the gas in the star forming minihalo cloud is @xmath96 ( in terms of pre - shock gas density ) , then it can be shown that the total amount of gas required to balance the ionizing photon emission from recombination is @xmath97 for an ionizing photon luminosity of @xmath98sec@xmath90 , which should be compared to @xmath99 of the total gas mass of the colliding clouds .",
    "the fact that the former is of the same order of the latter and the fact that the post - collision gas medium of the minihalos is likely to be quite irregular tell us that ( 1 ) a significant fraction of the ionizing photons is likely to escape the star - forming minihalos , and ( 2 ) the strmgren sphere size is not much larger the minihalo itself , which would imply that the ionizing effect from the star - forming minihalos on other minihalos in the same galaxy may be relatively mild . in a fraction of the solid angle , @xmath100 , from the star - forming minihalo optical depth may be small enough to allow for the ionizing photons to escape .",
    "for those directions , ignoring the recombination effect due to the imm , it can be shown that the minimal distance from the star - forming minihalo for the recipient minihalo of ionizing photons to experience a d - type ionization front is @xmath101kpc , which should be compared to the virial radius of the large - host halo of @xmath102kpc .",
    "thus , within the fraction of the solid angle where ionizing photons are able to escape into the imm , it appears that ionization front is r - type initially at the virial radius of a minihalo but turns into a d - type front when penetrating deeper into the minihalo ( at @xmath103 for a minihalo at a distance of @xmath52 ) .",
    "a d - type front may transmit a weak shock causing slight compression of the gas , while the regions cruised through by the r - type front may expand outward . in brief",
    ", we see that a small fraction of non - star - forming minihalos within the solid angle of escaped ionizing photons from star - forming minihalos may experience some dynamic effect due to photoionization , likely resulting in a very compact central region and evaporated outskirts ( barkana & loeb 1999 ; shapiro 2003 ) .",
    "most of the minihalos are , however , not irradiated by ionizing photons from the first stars and would remain neutral and intact .",
    "now consider the effects of the blastwaves produced by the explosions of the first stars in the same large host galaxy .",
    "we will assume that the first stars each have mass of @xmath104 with supernova explosion energy of @xmath105erg .",
    "a star formation efficiency of @xmath10 would give a total explosive energy of @xmath106erg .",
    "it is not required that the mass of the first stars be in the range @xmath107 to induce pair - instability supernovae ; our conclusions remain little changed if the mass of the first stars is the range of @xmath108 .",
    "we will now estimate how far and at what speed the blastwave from such an explosion would travel . for simplicity and easy tractability",
    "we assume that the blastwave has two phases : the sedov - taylor phase followed by a momentum conserving phase ( with an instantaneous cooling phase in - between ) .",
    "the assumed second phase is conservative in the sense that it ignores any pressure of possibly still hot interior gas on the shock shell .",
    "the formula for the first phase is adopted from ostriker & mckee ( 1988 ) assuming a uniform density locally .",
    "cooling rate for a primordial gas is taken from sutherland & dopita ( 1993 ) with compton cooling added .",
    "figure 3 shows the velocity of the blastwave after it has traveled a distance such that it would , on average , hit @xmath109 ( solid curve ) and @xmath110 ( dashed curve ) other minihalos , as a function of the ambient gas density ( depending upon the radius ) .",
    "we see that for density in the relevant range the expected shock velocity sweeping minihalos may be in the range @xmath111km / s .",
    "we note that , with significantly reduced density surrounding the exploding stars due to photoionization , the blastwave only starts cooling way after breaking out the minihalo gas clouds in which the stars were formed .",
    "thus , neglecting the gas in the host minihalo does not introduce significant errors .    what would happen to the minihalos when shocks of this magnitude travel through them ?",
    "a shock with a velocity of @xmath112km / s in the ambient medium would produce a shock of velocity @xmath113km / s ( @xmath114 ) upon entering a minihalo , producing results comparable to those shown in figure 2 .",
    "one important difference is that , in this case of encompassing blastwaves , the external thermal pressure is high and could aid in compressing the shocked and cooled minihalo gas clouds , which will likely enhance star formation in the minihalos .",
    "the reader may consult kang ( 1990 ) for a 1-d treatment in the context of globular cluster formation and klein , mckee , & colella ( 1994 ) for a recent calculation .",
    "in short , blastwaves from first massive stars could cause star formation in other minihalos in the same galaxy , yielding a widespread star formation .",
    "most likely , one generation of stars may be able to trigger star formation in majority of the minihalos .",
    "a higher mach shock compresses the minihalo gas to a higher density , resulting in a lower jeans mass ( roughly inversely proportional to the mach number ) .",
    "thus , earlier collisions between the faster blastwave and minihalos could lead to formation of lower mass stars , even in metal - free gas .",
    "we suggest that the observed , extremely low metallicity , low mass star he0107 - 5240 ( christlieb 2002 ) may be formed during some early time , high mach shocked minihalos , which are slightly contaminated with metals ( see hideyuki & nomoto 2003 ) .",
    "one interesting consequence of sweeping blastwave is that a large bulk velocity will be imparted on the compressed minihalo clouds .",
    "the expected bulk velocity in this case is about @xmath115 , where @xmath116 is the blastwave velocity in the ambient gas and the factor @xmath117 is due to the density ratio of minihalo gas to the ambient gas .",
    "thus , these minihalos may subsequently move at a velocity larger than the escape velocity of the large host halo ( @xmath118 ) , if @xmath119 .",
    "consequently , star formation may be widespread spatially and it is even possible that some stars may form after the minihalos have left the original host galaxy .",
    "one immediate implication is that ionizing photons from these stars will be much easier to escape , giving rise to escape fraction possibly well in excess of @xmath120 , whereas in the conventional picture of central star formation where the escape fraction is estimated to be below @xmath121 ( wood & loeb 2000 ; ricotti & shull 2001 ) .",
    "another implication is that , if some stars have moved outside their original large host galaxy when they explode , the resulting blastwaves will travel much further thanks to the lower density in the intergalactic medium , which , in turn , could shock heat , accelerate and compress minihalos in the intergalactic medium to form stars .",
    "if this chain reaction can be triggered , star formation in minihalos , which are much more abundant ( in total mass ) than large halos and are otherwise unable to form stars , could produce many more ionizing photons than what can be produced by large galaxies alone . in figure 3",
    "the three solid dots show the velocity of the blastwave from a minihalo with an explosion energy of @xmath122erg ( for @xmath123 ) after it has traveled a distance such that it would have , _ on average _ , hit @xmath124 , @xmath125 and @xmath109 other minihalos , respectively ( the fraction of mass in minihalos of mass @xmath126 @xmath127 is assumed ) . if minihalos are strongly clustered with a correlation length smaller than @xmath128 ( where @xmath93 is the mean separation equal to @xmath129kpc proper for @xmath130 at @xmath46 ) , a chain reaction may be sustainable .",
    "minihalos may very well be strongly clustered at high redshift ( barkana & loeb 2003 ) .",
    "we will study this separately .    in any event , blastwaves from stray stars propagating through the intergalactic medium would create dense shells .",
    "figure 4 illustrate the temporal evolution of shocked gas at @xmath46 ( assuming isobaric evolution ) ; preshock gas is at the mean gas density at @xmath46 .",
    "we see that cooling time is longer in this case than shown in figure 2 ; here compton cooling becomes important and its cooling time scale ( i.e , e - folding time ) is @xmath131yr . on the longer time",
    "scales shown in figure 4 the detailed evolution would be affected by concomitant dynamic evolution driven by gravitational instability of large - scale density perturbations .",
    "further investigation is needed to see if star formation in shells occurs .",
    "it is conceivable that a chain reaction may occur , which would result in a picture analogous to the explosion scenario proposed for larger galaxies at lower redshift ( ostriker & cowie 1981 ) .",
    "in the cold dark matter model large , high - redshift ( @xmath0 ) galaxies with virial temperature @xmath18k are shown to be mostly comprised of cold atomic clouds , which were originally minihalos and accreted into larger halos .",
    "it is shown that supersonic collisions of cold atomic gas clouds on time scale of @xmath3yr will shock heat and compress the gas , which then cools and form 2 molecules to further cool to @xmath83k .",
    "massive star formation ensues . the resulting star formation is spatially distributed .",
    "it is then shown that most of the star formation in minihalos may be triggered by shockwaves produced by the first stars formed in collisions .",
    "those shockwave compressed minihalos will be more widespread spatially due to large imparted velocities and some can possibly escape into the intergalactic medium . if minihalos in the intergalactic space are strongly clustered , a chain reaction of star formation in minihalos may be triggered initiated by explosions of these stray stars . in this case ,",
    "far more ionizing photons can be produced than large halos alone can . separately , whether cooling shells of swept - up mean density gas in the intergalactic medium can form stars and possibly trigger an explosion - induced chain reaction even in the absence of strong minihalo clustering is unclear .",
    "more importantly with respect to cosmological reionization , widespread star formation would allow an ionizing photon escape fraction much higher than in the conventional picture where star formation occurs in the central regions of galaxies and whose the escape fraction is estimated to be below @xmath121 for galaxies more massive than @xmath132",
    ".    such star formation may be the norm at @xmath0 and may create the physical basis to reconcile the standard cosmological model with the wmap polarization observations .",
    "an optical depth @xmath4 can be achieved realistically even in the absence of chain reactions forementioned .",
    "a still higher optical depth may indicate that some further enhancement in star formation has occurred , such as through possible chain reactions .",
    "detailed simulations of star formation triggered by collisions and blastwaves at high redshift galaxies would be required to firm up this picture and quantify key parameters , including star formation efficiency and ionizing photon escape fraction .    finally , we note that these widespread star formation outlined above may give rise to metal enrichment of the intergalactic medium far more uniform than any other processes that have been proposed ( e.g. , gnedin 1998 ; aguirre 2001 ; cen 2003 ) .",
