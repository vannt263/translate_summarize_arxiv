    "a part of the outer layers of the white dwarf is ejected as a nova shell .",
    "it is not clear if the expelled material amounts to less or more than the accreted material , although the newest studies point to the former possibility @xcite . in the case of _ classical novae _ , the donor usually is a late - type main - sequence star .",
    "this makes the system hosting the nova event a cataclysmic variable ( cv ) .",
    "since the cv is not destroyed by the explosion , it is safe to assume that a nova eruption is a recurrent event . a typical shell mass of @xmath0@xmath1 ( e.g. , * ?",
    "* ) and an upper limit of the average mass - transfer rate of @xmath2 @xcite then translates to recurrence times @xmath3 .",
    "this is now also supported observationally @xcite .",
    "nova eruptions can thus be expected to be part of the evolution of every cv , assuming that the mass - transfer rate is high enough to accumulate the necessary critical amount of material on the surface of the white dwarf within the lifetime of the system .",
    "hence , once the effects of the nova eruption have worn off , the behaviour of the underlying cv should be determined ( once again ) by the properties that make it part of one of the many subtypes of cvs , i.e.  especially its orbital period , mass - transfer rate and the magnetic field strength of the white dwarf .",
    "there are several post - novae that corroborate this assumption , e.g.  dq her ( nova her 1934 ) is the prototype intermediate polar @xcite , and rr pic ( nova pic 1925 ) belongs to the sw sex stars @xcite .",
    "of special importance in this context is the discovery of an ancient nova shell around the dwarf novae z cam and at cnc @xcite , which made these the first cvs to be established as post - novae not based on the observation of the actual nova eruption .    within our project to establish a sample of post - novae to compare their characteristics as a group we have recently recovered the position of the system v728 sco ( nova sco 1862 ; *",

    "furthermore , the low - resolution spectroscopy from 2011 june 29 apparently was taken when the system was in between the bright and the low state .",

    "the light curves in fig .",
    "[ v728scolc_fig ] indicate that the contribution of the asymmetrically placed hot spot is strongest in the low state and much fainter otherwise .",

    "throughout eclipse ( phases 0.951.05 ) the line presents a single peak , which rapidly changes its position in mid - eclipse .",

    "due to the very faint flux at eclipse minimum ( @xmath94 ) some of the data points around these phases have rather large errors . in spite of this , we here present an attempt to determine some of the binary parameters in a preliminary manner .    for this purpose , we used the geometrical method described in detail by @xcite for the analysis of the data on z cha , a dwarf nova with similar eclipse characteristics . from our light curve",

    "apparently , the mass ratio @xmath86 is strongly dependent on @xmath76 in the present analysis . on the other hand",
    ", there is only a weak dependence between @xmath86 and @xmath76 in our spectroscopic analysis ( section [ syspar_sec ] ) .",
    "we therefore use the spectroscopically determined mass ratio @xmath81 , in order to find the most probable orbital inclination @xmath76 for which this mass ratio is valid , according to the eclipse analysis .",

    "we can now perform an approximate check on the consistency of our results . using @xmath96 from eq .",
    "( [ rrd_eq ] ) , we derive @xmath97 from the photometry .",
    "this fits well with the spectroscopically determined @xmath98 .",
    "one has to keep in mind , however , that those results are not completely independent , because they both depend on our choice for @xmath80 .",

    "this results in @xmath101 .",

    "[ syspar_tab ] we present a first parameter estimation of v728 sco , using the photometrically determined value for the binary separation @xmath89 .",
    "the radii of the central object and the hot spot ( @xmath92 and @xmath93 , respectively ) were calculated using equations 16 and 17 from @xcite .",
    "the radius @xmath92 is at least a factor 6 larger than a typical white dwarf radius , an important observational fact which will be discussed in section [ disc_sec ] .",
    "the observed hump maximum at phase 0.85 mentioned above would correspond to an angle @xmath103 , in agreement with the calculated value in table [ phpar_tab ] .",
    "this can be considered as an additional argument in favour of an orbital inclination near 82@xmath87 .",
    "finally , we can compare the spectroscopically determined distance from the white dwarf to the centre - of - mass @xmath104 with the photometrically derived radius of the accretion disc @xmath105 .",
    "this yields the distance from the hot spot to the centre - of - mass to @xmath106 , which corresponds to a comparatively small keplerian velocity @xmath107 .",
    "this fits quite well with our interpretation of the elongated extension of the emission from the secondary star seen in the @xmath108 quadrant of the doppler map ( fig .",
    "[ hadopn2_fig ] ) .",
    "note that while the latter was taken during decline from outburst , the photometric analysis corresponds to the low state , and thus the disc radii can be expected to be different @xcite . still , due to the apparent short outburst recurrence time ( fig .",
    "[ v728scoltlc_fig ] ) the changes in the disc radius during an outburst cycle are probably smaller than in other cvs .    since there is only a single eclipse light curve available for our analysis , it was not possible to give any error bar on the estimates presented here .",
    "furthermore it is worth repeating at this point that several parameters depend strongly on the mass of the secondary star .",
    "its assumed value is exclusively based on statistics .",
    "the parameters in table [ syspar_tab ] should therefore not be taken at face value , and will have to be tested by future observations .",
    "it is of special interest that v728sco shows strong evidence of having a comparatively low mass - transfer rate .",
    "its orbital period @xmath109 places it right into the regime of the sw sex stars .",
    "these cvs are a group of nova - likes that dominate the orbital period range 2.84 h @xcite .",
    "the typical defining sw sex features suggest that these are high mass transfer systems @xcite .",
    "this is supported by their white - dwarf temperatures which is an indication for the accretion rate and which exceeds the values expected from angular momentum loss through the standard magnetic braking scenario @xcite .",
    "recent investigations have shown that most of the non - magnetic cvs in this range and in fact all nova - likes seem to be of sw sex type .",
    "this includes , e.g. , the old nova rr pic @xcite .",
    "it has been suggested that sw sex stars represent a stage in the secular evolution of cvs and that , in general , cvs reaching that period range share their characteristics ( schmidtobreick et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "in addition , most old novae are indeed high mass - transfer systems @xcite , and so v728 sco appears as something of an oddball .",
    "however , it is not alone .",
    "the old nova xx tau also shows the spectral appearance of a low mass - transfer system @xcite . @xcite",
    "suggest an orbital period close to 3.26 h , i.e.  in the immediate vicinity to v728 sco .",
    "another example is the system v446 her , which has a longer orbital period thorstensen+taylor00 - 1 , and shows stunted dwarf - nova - type outbursts @xcite similar to what is implied by the long - term light curve of v728 sco .",
    "@xcite give a few more examples .",
    "this behaviour of some post - novae has been seen as a strong indication for the validity of the hibernation model which predicts changes of the mass - transfer rate in the evolution of the pre- and post - nova . in that model",
    "the secondary star suffers an enhanced irradiation by the hot post - eruption white dwarf , is strongly driven out of its thermal equilibrium , and as a consequence maintains a much larger volume than according to its mass .",
    "the gradual cooling of the white dwarf permits the secondary to relax into its equilibrium state , ultimately losing contact with its roche lobe , thus terminating the transfer of mass via l@xmath54 , and so the post - novae enters into hibernation. hence , post - novae immediately after eruption are expected to drive a very high mass - transfer rate that will gradually decrease with time @xcite .",
    "once the mass - transfer rate has crossed the limit that allows for disc instabilities , dwarf - nova - type outbursts will occur ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * for a review ) .",
    "the low - state behaviour of v728 sco could be interpreted in this context , especially because we are here confronted with a rather - old nova , more than one century after eruption .",
    "perhaps v728 sco is just entering its transition from a high mass - transfer post - nova stage towards the onset of hibernation .",
    "a different explanation for the observed large spread in mass - transfer rates for cvs was given by @xcite .",
    "in their approach , the interplay between irradiation from the white dwarf and an increase in the roche lobe radius during the phases of high mass - transfer causes long - term ( @xmath110 ) oscillations of the secondary s radius , inducing corresponding variations of the mass - transfer rate . here , the fact that most post - novae seem to have high accretion rates would simply be a consequence of nova eruptions having a higher probability to occur during phases of high mass - transfer .",
    "this model predicts identical behaviour of the pre- and post - novae ( beyond the immediate aftereffects of the nova eruption ) . with v446",
    "her , there is at least one low mass - transfer cv known that represents a strong support for this picture @xcite .",
    "finally , @xcite explain the low amplitudes of the outbursts in post - novae with the system maintaining a hot ionized inner disc due to irradiation by the eruption - heated white dwarf .",
    "this limits the area of the disc that can contribute to the outburst . as the white dwarf cools down",
    ", the size of the hot inner disc will gradually shrink , the outburst amplitude will increase , and the outburst frequency will decrease .",
    "the very similar amplitudes of the variation in pre- and post - eruption v446 her @xcite somewhat contradict that picture .",
    "furthermore , there is as yet no evidence for a change in outburst amplitude or frequency in that post - nova @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "our analysis of the low state eclipse of v728 sco yields a radius of the central object @xmath111 , at least a factor @xmath176 larger than any white dwarf radius within the reasonable white dwarf mass range , and even more so for our estimated mass of 0.81 m@xmath63 @xcite .",
    "this represents strong evidence for the existence of the predicted hot inner disc , which is furthermore supported by the presence of the strong heii @xmath254686 emission line in the spectra which disappears during eclipse ( section [ eclsp_sec ] ) , and thus can be assumed to originate in that small part of the disc . also , the low outburst amplitude of @xmath171.5 mag and the high outburst frequency fit well within the framework of the schreiber et al .  model .",
    "future long - term monitoring is desirable to properly investigate the characteristics of the outburst behaviour .",
    "we have presented photometric and spectroscopic data on the recently recovered old nova v728 sco , 150 yr after its eruption , that reveal it as an eclipsing system .",
    "its orbital period @xmath112 places it in the midst of a region in the period distribution of cvs that is dominated by high mass - transfer systems .",
    "still , the spectroscopic characteristics and the long - term variability that resembles dwarf - nova type outburst behaviour point to a comparatively low mass - transfer rate .",
    "the low - state data are of special interest because its light curve is characterized by a total eclipse of two different bodies , that of a central object surrounding the location of the white dwarf and , phase shifted , that of the hot spot .",
    "this behaviour is well known for su uma type dwarf novae with @xmath113 as z cha @xcite , oy car @xcite and ht cas @xcite , but , to our knowledge , it was never observed in old novae or any other type of cataclysmic variable above the period gap ( @xmath114 ) .",
    "an inspection of published data of about 30 eclipsing old nova remnants revealed always v - shaped eclipse light curves , similar to those of v728 sco at high state ( fig .  [ v728scolc_fig ] ) , sometimes with short totality phases near eclipse centre .",
    "the analysis of that low state eclipse provided strong evidence for the existence of a hot inner disc , as predicted for post - novae by @xcite .",
    "v728 sco could soon play the role of a corner stone in our understanding of post - novae and cataclysmic variables in general .",
    "this , however , will only be possible if more and better photometric and spectroscopic data become available , especially during the interesting low state .",
