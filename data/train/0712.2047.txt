    "micro - swimmers are of general interest lately , motivated by both engineering and biological problems @xcite",
    ". they can be remarkably subtle as was illustrated by e. m. purcell in his famous talk on  life at low reynolds numbers \" @xcite where he introduced a deceptively simple swimmer shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : purcell ] .",
    "purcell asked `` what will determine the direction this swimmer will swim ? ''",
    "this simple looking question took 15 years to answer : koehler , becker and stone @xcite found that the direction of swimming depends , among other things , on the stroke s _ amplitude _ : increasing the amplitudes of certain small strokes that propagate the swimmer to the right result in propagation to the left .",
    "this shows that even simple qualitative aspects of low reynolds number swimming can be quite un - intuitive .",
    "purcell s swimmer made of three slender rods can be readily analyzed numerically by solving three coupled , non - linear , first order , differential equations @xcite . however , at present there appears to be no general method that can be used to gain direct qualitative insight into the properties of the solutions of these equations .",
    "our first aim here is to to describe a geometric approach which allows one to describe the qualitative features of the solution of the swimming differential equations without actually solving them .",
    "our tools are geometric .",
    "the first tool is the notion of curvature borrowed from non - abelian gauge theory @xcite .",
    "this curvature can be represented graphically by landscape diagrams such as figs .",
    "[ fig : optstrkhh],[fig : fphieta=2],[fig : purcellcurvx ] which capture the qualitative properties of general swimming strokes .",
    "we have taken care not to assume any pre - existing knowledge about gauge theory on part of the reader .",
    "rather , we have attempted to use swimming as a natural setting where one can build and develop a picture of the notions of non - abelian gauge fields .",
    "purcell s original question , `` what will determine the direction this swimmer will swim ? ''",
    "can often be answered by simply looking at such landscape pictures .",
    "our second tool is a notion of metric and curvature associated with the dissipation .",
    "the `` dissipation curvature '' can be described as a landscape diagram and it gives information on the geometry of `` shape space '' .",
    "this gives us useful geometric tools that give qualitative information on the solutions of rather complicated differential equations .",
    "we begin by illustrating these geometric methods for the symmetric version of purcell s swimmer , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : symmetric - p ] .",
    "symmetry protects the swimmer against rotations so it can only swim on a straight line .",
    "this makes it simple to analyze by elementary analytical means . in particular , it is possible to predict , using the landscape portraits of the swimming curvature fig .",
    "[ fig : optstrkhh ] , which way it will swim .",
    "in this ( abelian ) case the swimming curvature gives full quantitative information on the swimmer .",
    "we then turn to the non - abelian case of the usual purcell s swimmer which can also rotate .",
    "there are now several notions of swimming curvatures : the rotation curvature and the two translation curvature .",
    "the translation curvatures are non - abelian .",
    "this means that they give precise information of small strokes but this information can not be integrated to learn about large strokes",
    ". this can be viewed as a failure of stokes integration theorem .",
    "nevertheless , as we shall explain , they do give lots of qualitative information about large strokes as well .    .",
    "the location of the swimmer in the plane is determined by two position coordinates @xmath0 and one orientation @xmath1 .",
    "the lengths of each arm is @xmath2 and the length of the body @xmath3.,title=\"fig:\",width=302 ] +",
    "purcell s swimmer , which was invented as  the simplest animal that can swim that way \" @xcite , is not simple to analyze . a variant of it that is simple to analyze is shown in the fig  [ fig : symmetric - p ] .     and the length of the body @xmath3 .",
    "the position of the swimmer is denoted by @xmath4 . , title=\"fig:\",width=8 ] +    the swimmer has four arms , each of length @xmath5 and one body arm of length @xmath3 , ( possibly of zero length ) .",
    "the swimmer can control the angles @xmath6 and the arms are not allowed to touch .",
    "both angles increase in the counterclockwise direction , @xmath7 .",
    "being symmetric , this swimmer can not rotate and can swim only in the `` body '' direction .",
    "it falls into the class of `` simple swimmers '' which includes the `` three linked spheres '' of najafi and glolestanian @xcite and the pushmepullyou @xcite , whose hydrodynamics is elementary because they can not turn .",
    "let us first address purcell s question `` what will determine the direction this swimmer will swim ? '' for the stroke shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : optstrkhh ] . in the stroke ,",
    "the swimmer moves the two arms backwards together and then bring them forward one by one .",
    "the first half of the cycle pushes the swimmer forward and the second half pulls it back .",
    "which half of the cycle wins ?    to answer that , one needs to remember that swimming at low reynolds numbers relies more on effective anchors than on good propellers .",
    "since one needs twice the force to drag a rod transversally than to drag it along its axis @xcite , an open arm @xmath8 acts like an anchor .",
    "this has the consequence that rowing with both arms , in the same direction and in phase , is _ less effective _ than bringing them back out of phase .",
    "the stroke actually swims backwards .",
    "this reasoning also shows that the swimmer is sisyphian : it performs a lot of forward and backward motion for little net gain .",
    "the swimming equation at low reynolds number is the requirement that the total force ( and torque ) on the swimmer is zero .",
    "the total force ( and torque ) is the sum of the forces ( and torques ) on the four arms and body . for the symmetric swimmer ,",
    "the torque and force in the transversal direction vanish by symmetry .",
    "the swimming equation is the condition that the force in the body - direction vanishes .",
    "this force depends linearly on the known rate of change of the controls , @xmath9 and the unknown the velocity @xmath10 of the `` body - rod '' .",
    "it gives a linear equation for the velocity .",
    "for slender arms and body , the forces are given by cox @xcite slender body theory : the element of force , @xmath11 , acting on a segment of length @xmath12 located at the point @xmath13 on the slender body is given by @xmath14 where @xmath15 is a unit tangent vector to the slender - body at @xmath13 and @xmath16 its velocity there .",
    "@xmath17 is the viscosity and @xmath18 the slenderness ( the ratio of length to diameter ) .",
    "the force on the a - th arm depends linearly on the velocities of the controls @xmath19 and swimming velocity @xmath10 .",

    "the requirement that the total force on the swimmer vanishes gives a linear relation between the variation of the controls and the displacement @xmath21 @xmath22 where [ eq : a - def ] a(,)= , = as one expects , the body is just a `` dead weight '' and a trim swimmer with @xmath23 is best .",
    ".,title=\"fig:\",width=453 ] +      the notation @xmath21 stresses that the differential displacement does not integrate to a function of the controls , @xmath24 .",
    "this is the essence of swimming : @xmath25 fails to return to its original value with @xmath26 .",
    "for this reason , swimming is best captured not by the differential one - form @xmath21 but by the differential two - form @xmath27 @xmath28 and @xmath29 is the rational function given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : a - def ] ) .",
    "@xmath30 is commonly known as the curvature @xcite and its surface integral for a region enclosed by a curve @xmath31 gives , by stokes , the distance covered in one stroke .",
    "it gives complete information on both the direction of swimming and distance .",
    "the total curvature associated with the full square of shape space , @xmath32 is 0 by symmetry . the total positive curvature associated with the triangular half of the square",
    ", @xmath33 is 0.274 .",
    "this means that swimmer can swim , at most , about a quarter of its arms length in a single stroke .",

    "purcell swimmer can move in either direction in the plane and can also rotate . since the euclidean group is not abelian ( rotations and translations do not commute ) the notion of `` swimming curvature '' that proved to be so useful in the abelian case needs to be modified .",
