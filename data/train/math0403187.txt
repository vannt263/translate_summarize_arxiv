    "it is well known that the spectrum of the harmonic oscillator hamiltonian @xmath7 acting on @xmath8 consists of the non - degenerate eigenvalues @xmath9 with corresponding normalized eigenfunctions @xmath10 where @xmath11 $ ] is the @xmath12-th hermite polynomial .",
    "the present paper is devoted to studying the spectrum of a matrix version of @xmath13 , the operator @xmath14 acting on @xmath1 , where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are two @xmath4 constant positive definite matrices .",

    ", it is not difficult to find the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of @xmath5 from those of @xmath13 . on the other hand , when @xmath16 , the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of @xmath5 are connected to those of @xmath13 in a highly non - trivial manner ( see theorem [ t3 ] below ) .",
    "our recent interest in describing spectral properties of operators such as @xmath5 arises from two sources . in a series of recent works , parmeggiani and wakayama , cf .",
    "@xcite , @xcite and @xcite , characterize the spectrum of the operator @xmath17 acting on @xmath1 , assuming that @xmath18 is definite positive and @xmath19 . although the two operators are related , it does not seem possible to obtain the eigenvalues of @xmath5 from those of @xmath20 . in @xcite and @xcite the eigenfunctions of @xmath20",
    "are found in terms of a twisted hermite - type basis of @xmath1 . in this basis",
    "the eigenvalue problem associated to @xmath20 becomes a three - term recurrence .",
    "the strategy presented below for analyzing the spectrum of @xmath5 will be similar .",
    "our second motivation is heuristic .",
    "it is known that the scalar harmonic oscillator , @xmath21 , achieves the optimal value for the constant in the lieb - thirring inequalities with power @xmath22 , cf .",
    "it would be of great interest finding hamiltonians with similar properties for lieb - thirring - type inequalities for magnetic schrdinger and pauli operators , cf .",
    "@xcite , @xcite and @xcite . due to their close connection with the harmonic oscillator ,",
    "both @xmath20 and the presently discussed @xmath5 are strong candidates for further investigations in this direction .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows .",
    "section  2 is devoted to describing elementary facts about @xmath5 . in section  3",
    "we consider a basis for which the eigenvalue problem associated to @xmath5 is expressed as a three - term recurrence .",
    "the main results are to be found in section  4 where we establish necessary and sufficient conditions , given explicitly in terms of the entries of @xmath2 and @xmath3 , for an eigenfunction of @xmath5 to be the linear combination of the first four elements of this basis .",
    "we define @xmath5 rigorously as the self - adjoint operator whose domain , denoted below by @xmath23 , is the set of all @xmath24 such that @xmath25 where @xmath26 denotes the sobolev space of index ( 2,2 ) and `` @xmath27 '' denotes fourier transform .",
    "since @xmath28 \\!\\!{\\,\\mathrm{d}}x \\geq 0,\\ ] ] @xmath5 is a symmetric operator .",
    "it is well known ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) that if the domain of @xmath13 is chosen to be @xmath29 , then @xmath13 is self - adjoint , non - negative and @xmath30 , the schwartz space , is a core for @xmath13 .",
    "thus @xmath5 with domain @xmath23 is a self - adjoint non - negative operator with core @xmath31 .",
    "indeed , these properties are obvious when @xmath2 is a diagonal non - negative matrix and @xmath32 , the identity matrix .",
    "the general case follows by considering the factorization @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the jordan diagonalization of the former matrix , and by using the fact that @xmath23 is invariant under the action of constant matrices .",
    "[ t1 ] the spectrum of @xmath5 consists exclusively of isolated eigenvalues of finite multiplicity whose only accumulation point is @xmath35",
    ". moreover , if @xmath36 denotes the @xmath12-th eigenvalue of this operator counting multiplicity , then @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 , are the eigenvalues of @xmath2 and @xmath3 , respectively .",
    "it reduces to showing that @xmath40 where @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "this follows directly from the min - max principle ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , the estimates @xmath43 and .",
    "the above universal bound is not sharp in general and for most pairs @xmath44 , @xmath45 .    as we mentioned earlier , it is not difficult to compute the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of @xmath5 when @xmath2 and @xmath3 commute . indeed",
    "@xmath15 if , and only if , @xmath2 and @xmath3 have one ( and hence both ) eigenvectors in common .",
    "let @xmath46 be such that @xmath47 and @xmath48 , for @xmath49 .",
    "let @xmath50 be , as in , the eigenfunctions of @xmath13 .",
    ". then @xmath52 by choosing @xmath53 , the family @xmath54 is an orthonormal basis of @xmath1 , hence @xmath55    the analysis below will show that finding the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of @xmath5 whenever @xmath16 is by no means of the trivial nature as the above case .",
    "without further mention , we will often suppress the sub - indices in operator expressions .",
    "the structure of @xmath56 allows us to decompose @xmath1 into two invariant subspaces where the eigenvalue problem can be studied independently .",
    "we perform this decomposition as follows .",
    "given @xmath57 , let @xmath58 and denote by @xmath59 .",
    "since @xmath60 are invariant under @xmath61 , multiplication by @xmath62 and action of constant matrices , these spaces are also invariant under @xmath63 .",
    "hence @xmath64 are self - adjoint operators and @xmath65    let @xmath66 be the annihilation and creation operators for the scalar harmonic oscillator .",
    "then @xmath67 from these relations one can easily deduce the recurrent identities @xmath68 where , here and elsewhere , any quantity with negative sub - index is zero . since @xmath69 is an orthonormal basis for @xmath8 , we can expand any vector of @xmath1 via @xmath70 for a suitable unique sequence @xmath71 .",
    "moreover , denoting by @xmath72 and @xmath73 , @xmath74\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty v_n \\phi_n^\\alpha \\\\    & = \\sum_{n=0}b v_n ( -\\partial_x^2 )    \\phi_n^\\alpha+av_nx^2\\phi_n^\\alpha \\\\    & = \\frac{1}{2 } \\sum_{n=0}(n+2)^{1/2}(n+1)^{1/2}n_\\alpha v_n\\phi_{n+2}^\\alpha    + ( 2n+1)m_\\alpha v_n \\phi_n^\\alpha + \\\\ & \\quad    + n^{1/2}(n-1)^{1/2 } n_\\alpha v_n   \\phi_{n-2}^\\alpha \\\\   & = \\frac{1}{2 } \\sum_{k=0}\\left [ k^{1/2}(k-1)^{1/2}n_\\alpha v_{k-2 }   + ( 2k+1)m_\\alpha v_k+ \\right.\\\\ &   \\quad \\left.+(k+2)^{1/2}(k+1)^{1/2 }    n_\\alpha v_{k+2}\\right]\\phi_k^\\alpha .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] thus @xmath75 are , respectively , similar to the block tri - diagonal matrices @xmath76 acting on @xmath77 , where @xmath78    in order to reduce the amount of notation in our subsequent discussion , we consider @xmath5 in canonical form as follows",

    "then @xmath83 where @xmath84 here the positivity of @xmath2 and @xmath3 is equivalent to the conditions @xmath85 furthermore notice that @xmath15 if , and only if , either @xmath86 or @xmath87 . hence , unless otherwise specified , we will consider without loss of generality that the pair @xmath44 is always the pair @xmath88 in .    by virtue of the tri - diagonal representation",
    ", it seems natural to expect that the hermite series may be a good candidate for expanding the eigenfunctions of @xmath63 . not to mention that it is the obvious extension of the scalar and commutative cases . in this respect",
    ", we may consider `` finite lifetime '' series expansions of eigenfunctions @xmath89 of @xmath63 , @xmath90 for suitable finite @xmath91 , @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "the results we present below show that , contrary to the above presumption , is not such a good candidate for expanding @xmath89 for small values of @xmath94 . to be more precise ,",
    "we show that for @xmath95 , an expansion of type is allowed only for a small sub - manifold of the region @xmath96 corresponding to all positive definite pairs @xmath44 .",
    "we first discuss the cases @xmath97 and leave @xmath98 for the forthcoming section .",
    "the following result includes a family of test bases larger than the one considered in .",
    "[ t2 ] let @xmath50 be the eigenfunctions of the scalar harmonic oscillator @xmath13 .",
    "then @xmath5 has an eigenfunction of the type @xmath99 where @xmath100 , @xmath101 and @xmath102 , if and only if @xmath15 .    if @xmath103 , then @xmath104",
    "if @xmath105 or @xmath106 in the above identities , necessarily @xmath87 so @xmath15 . hence without loss of generality we can assume that @xmath107 .",
    "if @xmath108 , once again @xmath87",
    ". then we may suppose that @xmath109 . since both left hand sides of the above identities are equal to @xmath110 , where in both cases @xmath111 is a polynomial of degree @xmath112 , necessarily either @xmath87 or @xmath113 .",
    "in the latter case , the above system is rewritten as @xmath114 since @xmath115 is an eigenfunction of @xmath13 where @xmath57 , necessarily @xmath116 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath117 hence necessarily @xmath86 .",
    "since @xmath118 are invariant under the action of @xmath63 , and the even ( resp .",
    "odd ) terms in the series belong to @xmath119 ( resp .",
    "@xmath120 ) , the above lemma ensures that @xmath121 is an eigenfunction of @xmath63 if , and only if , @xmath2 and @xmath3 commute .",
    "in this section we study necessary and sufficient conditions in order to guarantee that @xmath122 , with finite lifetime expansion of the type for @xmath123 and 3 , is an eigenfunction of @xmath63 for suitable @xmath92 when @xmath16 . in other words , assuming that @xmath89 satisfies the constraint @xmath124 we aim to investigate conditions ensuring @xmath125 .",
    "since @xmath126 for all @xmath127 , and the subspaces @xmath60 are invariant under @xmath63 , we may consider the even and odd cases separately . to this end , let @xmath128 @xmath129 respectively .",

    "a straightforward computation shows that the above system is equivalent to @xmath164 the first equation holds if and only if @xmath109 .",
    "here @xmath165 and @xmath166 notice that in this case @xmath167 let @xmath168 then @xmath169 and @xmath170 decompose @xmath171 for suitable @xmath172 . then the second identity of holds if and only if , @xmath173 and @xmath174 the third identity of can be rewritten as the system @xmath175 in @xmath176 and @xmath177 . by finding @xmath177 from this system ( for instance by newton s method ) and by equating to , a straightforward computation yields .",

    "let @xmath179 and @xmath180 where the sign for the super - index is chosen in concordance to the sign in expression . by computing the partial derivatives of both sides of identities and , a straightforward but rather long computation which we omit in the present discussion ,",
    "shows that these four regions are smooth 3-manifolds embedded in @xmath181 , see .",
    "the fact that @xmath182 are non empty is consequence of the following observation . by fixing @xmath183 and @xmath184 , and by putting @xmath185 ,",
    "condition can be rewritten as @xmath186 \\\\    & = \\pm \\frac{4|\\tilde{\\xi}|}{\\sqrt{\\tilde{b}}}(\\tilde{b}+1)^2-\\beta^2    ( 1 - 9\\tilde{b})(9-\\tilde{b}),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath187 .",

    "all these properties also hold for @xmath199 .    furthermore , @xmath200 indeed , if and hold at the same time for the same tetrad @xmath201 , then , according to theorem  [ t3 ] , @xmath161 should be at the same time eigenvalue of @xmath146 and @xmath152 ( @xmath178 defined with the same sign ) .",
    "obviously the latter is a contradiction .",
    "finally , we may comment on the issue of considering a more general basis for expanding the eigenfunctions of @xmath63 .",
    "one might think that a natural candidate for generalizing is the finite expansion @xmath204 where @xmath205 are complex number and @xmath101 .",
