    "the orbital degree of freedom is an important entity in the condensed matter physics which plays a crucial role in stabilizing many exotic phases observed in the strongly correlated electron systems.@xcite when the degenerate @xmath7 orbitals of the transition metals are partially filled then occupation of a particular orbital at a particular site is expected to be dictated by the occupation of another orbital at another site , which can lead to various kind of orbital ordering ( oo ) similar to the spin ordering .",
    "for example , in the case of lamno@xmath8 degenerate @xmath9 orbitals are occupied by only one electron and predicted to show antiferro - orbital ordering ( afoo ) in the @xmath10 plane in 1955 by goodenough.@xcite the coulomb correlation is found to play an important role in the orbital physics of transition metal oxides .",
    "however , it is still not clear whether it just enhances the effect of lattice distortions or really drives the oo via superexchange.@xcite in spite of the ambiguity about the exact mechanism behind the oo , it is almost clear that such oo is often accompanied by reduction in the crystal symmetry .",
    "thus in the geometrically frustrated system oo is expected to relax the frustration leading to the formation of novel magnetic phases earlier forbidden by the frustration .",
    "spinel vanadates with general formula av@xmath0o@xmath1 ( a - cd , mg , and zn ) is an important geometrically frustrated system which has attracted a great deal of attention for a decade because of oo induced structural transition and formation of fascinating magnetic phases.@xcite all the studied compounds show cubic to tetragonal transition at low temperature and paramagnetic ( pm ) to afm transition at slightly lower temperature.@xcite the consensus is emerging among the researchers regarding the oo induced structural transition , however the exact pattern of oo remains a matter of controversy.@xcite moreover , the exact role of soc along with its strength in stabilizing the magnetic and orbital ordering is yet to be decided in this series of compounds.@xcite in the present work we would like to address these issues for mgv@xmath0o@xmath1 ( mvo ) .",
    "the recent experimental work on this compound has shown quite different results in comparison to the well studied znv@xmath0o@xmath1 ( zvo).@xcite in the tetragonal phase the space group of mvo is _",
    "i@xmath11m2 _ whereas that of zvo is _",
    "i4@xmath12/amd_. the magnetic moment ( mm ) of v ion in mvo is @xmath40.47 @xmath13 which is @xmath40.15 @xmath13 less than that in zvo .",
    "such a reduced value of mm in zvo is due to large but negative contribution from the orbital part of mm .",
    "@xcite however , experimental data of mvo do not suggest such a large contribution from the orbital part and indicating to a deeper reason for observed small mm .",
    "moreover , the mm is also seen to make an angle of @xmath48@xmath5 with the @xmath6-axis indicating to a weak soc in mvo compound .    here",
    "we explore the role played by spin and orbital degrees of freedom in deciding the electronic and magnetic properties of mvo by using _",
    "ab initio _ electronic structure calculations .",
    "the afm interaction in the presence of strong coulomb correlation is found to be crucial in driving the system to insulating ground state .",
    "the @xmath2 and @xmath3 orbitals get ordered in the tetragonal phase and oo becomes more robust in the presence of afm interaction .",
    "the spin and orbital part of mm is found to @xmath41.4 and -0.2 @xmath13 , respectively . in the light of this result and in the presence of large exchange coupling of @xmath458 mev one can suggest that the geometrical frustration may be responsible for the experimentally observed low afm transition temperature ( @xmath442 k ) and small mm ( @xmath40.47 @xmath13 ) .",
    "the non - magnetic ( nm ) , ferromagnetic ( fm ) , and afm solutions of mvo are obtained by using _ state - of - the - art _ full - potential linearized augmented plane wave ( fp - lapw ) method.@xcite the lattice parameters and atomic positions used in the calculations are taken from the literature.@xcite the muffin - tin sphere radii automatically set in the calculations are 1.5664 , 1.7045 , and 1.4943 bohr for mg , v , and o atoms , respectively . for the exchange correlation",
    "functional , we have adopted recently developed generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) form of perdew _",
    "et al._@xcite the effect of on - site coulomb interaction is also considered within gga+@xmath14 formulation of the density functional theory.@xcite in gga+@xmath14 method the @xmath14 and @xmath15 are used as parameters .",
    "we varied @xmath14 from 3 - 5 ev and fixed @xmath15=0.5 ev .",
    "we found similar results for all values of @xmath14 .",
    "the results correspond to @xmath14=4 ev are only discussed in the manuscript . in order to see the role of orbital degrees of freedom on the electronic and magnetic properties of the compound soc",
    "is also considered in the calculations .",
    "the self - consistency was achieved by demanding the convergence of the total energy to be smaller than 10@xmath16 hartree / cell .",
    "the atomic arrangements in the unit cell are shown in fig .",
    "1 . it is evident from fig .",
    "1(a ) that each v atom is surrounded by six o atoms forming an octahedron . the octahedra are edge shared to each other .",
    "the small trigonal distortion splits six v - o bonds of an octahedron in two groups containing three bonds each with bond length of 2.016 and 2.033  .",
    "the four nearby v atoms form a regular tetrahedron with an edge of length 2.98  .",
    "each of the tetrahedron is surrounded by four neighboring tetrahedra via corner sharing and forming the chains of v atoms , see fig .",
    "1(b ) . in the tetragonal phase the tetrahedra become distorted with the v - v bond length of 2.971 and 2.980  .",
    "such a small distortion would reduce the geometrical frustration and is expected to give rise to novel electronic and magnetic phases .    in order to know the exact ground state of the compound we obtained various magnetic solutions using tetragonal structure .",
    "the total density of states ( tdos ) correspond to these solutions are shown in fig .",
    "it is clear from figs .",
    "2(a)-(d ) that the gga solutions provide metallic state as opposed experimentally observed insulating behavior .",
    "this result is not surprising as the gga underestimates the coulomb correlation among the 3@xmath7 electrons which is often found to be responsible for insulating ground state of the transition metal oxides.@xcite the nm and fm solutions obtained from gga+@xmath14 calculations also provide metallic state as evident from figs .",
    "2(e ) and ( f ) .",
    "this indicates that there may be a deeper reason for the insulating ground state of the system . at this juncture , it is important to note that the fm solution of zvo within lsda+@xmath14 is found to derive insulating ground state of the compound.@xcite in order to know the exact cause for insulating ground state of mvo we performed afm calculations .",
    "the afm solution creates a soft gap and in presence of soc it provides a hard gap of @xmath40.16 ev , see figs .",
    "2(g ) and ( h ) .",
    "it is important to note that the increased value of @xmath14 enhances the band gap in both the cases .",
    "thus present work clearly establishes that the afm coupling of v moments in presence of strong on - site coulomb interaction is responsible for insulating ground state and soc provides robustness to the insulating property of the compound .",
    "now we discuss the effect of different interaction parameters on the electronic structure of the compound .",
    "first we start with gga results . in the absence of magnetic interaction",
    "there are large density of states ( dos ) at the fermi level ( @xmath17 ) with dominating contribution from the v 3@xmath7 states .",
    "this may be considered as a signature of magnetic ground state under stoner theory .",
    "the magnetic interaction reduces the dos at @xmath17 by @xmath450% due to exchange splitting of the bands contributing at the @xmath17 and providing almost half - metallic state , see fig .",
    "moreover , the energy of fm solution is found to be @xmath40.65 ev / fu ( fu = formula unit ) less than that of nm solution indicating the magnetic ground state .",
    "the energy difference between the band edge of the up and down spins may be considered as a measure of exchange interaction which is found to be @xmath40.4 ev . the mm of v is found to be @xmath41.25 @xmath13 .",
    "interestingly , fm interaction induces finite mm ( @xmath40.14 @xmath13 ) at the mg ions occupying 2@xmath18 ( 0,1/2,1/4 ) wyckoff sites .",
    "the total mm / fu comes out to be @xmath43.6 @xmath13 , which corresponds to @xmath19@xmath201 state of the v@xmath21 ion .",
    "it is evident from fig .",
    "2(c ) that the afm interaction among the v moments reduces the dos at the @xmath17 drastically ( @xmath44 times less than that of fm ) .",
    "the @xmath17 lies at the minima of dos which is a reminiscence of the pseudo - gap .",
    "the afm interaction reduces the band width ( bw ) of the system and the bw of the deeper bands decreases by @xmath40.3 ev .",
    "further , it decreases the mm of v by @xmath40.1 @xmath13 and does not create any mm at mg sites .",
    "the energy / fu of the afm solution is @xmath40.16 ev less than that of fm solution .",
    "this is a clear evidence of the afm ground state whose spin ordering will be discussed in the later part of the manuscript .",
    "the inclusion of soc at this stage does not have any significant effect on the electronic structure of the compound as evident from fig .",
    "by comparing the energy of the afm and afm+soc solutions one can get the rough estimate of soc strength of v 3@xmath7 electron as the contribution from mg and o atoms is expected to be negligibly small .",
    "our gga calculation gives the strength of soc of @xmath45 mev for the v 3@xmath7 electrons .",
    "2(e)-(h ) depict the effect of on - site coulomb interaction among the v 3@xmath7 electrons on the electronic properties of the compound in the presence of various interaction parameters .",
    "on - site coulomb correlation reduces the bw as it localizes the electrons . in the case of nm and fm solutions",
    "there is a drastic decrease in the v 3@xmath7 dos at the @xmath17 due to transfer of spectral weight ( earlier contributing at @xmath17 ) away from it .",
    "moreover , fm interaction gives rise to a perfectly half - metallic state with a band gap of @xmath42.5 ev in the down - spin channel . in the presence of afm interaction among",
    "the v spins the system becomes insulating due to formation of upper and lower hubbard bands .",
    "further , inclusion of soc increases the separation between upper and lower hubbard bands .",
    "the exchange interaction estimated from the fm solution is @xmath40.5 ev which is 0.1 ev more than that obtained from simple gga calculation .",
    "this enhancement is attributed to increased hund s coupling strength due to increased spatial localization of v 3@xmath7 electrons , which also enhances the mm at v sites by @xmath40.2 @xmath13 .",
    "the total mm / fu comes out to be 4 @xmath13 , which corresponds to @xmath19=1 state of the v@xmath21 ion .",
    "such a large value of magnetic moment at v site is in sharp contradiction with the experimentally observed small magnetic moment.@xcite this clearly indicates that some other parameters are playing important role in deciding the magnetic properties of the compound .",
    "on comparing the energy of various solutions we find that the afm state is the true ground state of the system as energy of nm@xmath22fm@xmath22afm .    in order to study the role of orbital degrees of freedom we have performed fm gga+@xmath14 calculations in both cubic and tetragonal phases . in the cubic phase the occupancies of @xmath2 and @xmath3",
    "orbitals are same at every v sites , whereas for the tetragonal phase the occupancies of these orbitals are found to be different at different site which is a direct evidence of oo taking place in the tetragonal structure . moreover",
    ", the oo pattern does not depend on the nature of magnetic interaction as evident from table 1 where we have listed the occupancy of @xmath23,@xcite @xmath2 , and @xmath3 orbitals of four v atoms forming the tetrahedron and obtained from fm and afm solutions .",
    "it is evident from the table that each site is occupied by @xmath23 orbital .",
    "the v1 and v2 sites are mainly occupied by @xmath2 orbital and that of v3 and v4 sites by @xmath3 . at this juncture it is important to note that oo is observed in the pm phase of the spinel vanadates and in the pm phase there is a local mm at the v site and hence magnetic solutions would provide the better representation of the pm state in comparison to nm solution .",
    "table 1 also indicates the afm coupling between v1 and v2 ( v3 and v4 ) and fm coupling between v1 and v4 ( v2 and v3 ) .",
    "interestingly , afm interaction appears to provide more stability to the oo as the occupancy of @xmath3 ( @xmath2 ) orbital at v1 and v2 ( v3 and v4 ) sites is found to decrease by @xmath40.08 .",
    "moreover the energy / fu of afm solution is also @xmath40.24 ev less than that of fm solution suggesting the afm ground state .",
    "this energy difference between afm and fm solutions is @xmath480 mev less than that obtained from gga solution .",
    "this highlights the importance of coulomb correlation in establishing the afm ground state .",
    "the mm of vanadium ions corresponds to fm and afm solutions are found to be @xmath41.43 and 1.35 @xmath13 , respectively .    as mentioned in the introduction that the oo is normally considered as a cause for the structural transition in the pm phase of spinel vanadates .",
    "however , based on present work it is difficult to say whether oo is the cause of structural transition or it is just an effect of it . in order to understand the cause of oo seen in different transition metal oxides mainly two mechanism exist in the literature which are purely electronic and structural in origin.@xcite to separate out these two contributions to the oo , pavarini _ et al",
    "_ have carried out beautiful work on two canonical oo systems viz . kcuf@xmath8 and lamno@xmath8 , where they have used lda+dmft method.@xcite it is important to note that gga+@xmath14 method used in the present work is a static mean - field theory whereas lda+dmft used in the work of pavarini _ et al .",
    "_ is a dynamical mean - field theory and hence better in approximation .",
    "thus in order to know the exact cause of oo in the mvo compound work in line with pavarini _ et al .",
    "_ is desirable .",
    "now we study the effect of soc on the magnetic state of the compound .",
    "the gga+@xmath14+soc solutions also give afm ground state as the energy / fu of afm solution is found to be @xmath40.18 ev less than that of fm solution . as mention above the afm interaction provides more stability to the oo which further enhances the orbital moment as evident from table 2 where we have shown the spin ( @xmath19 ) , orbital ( @xmath24 ) and total ( @xmath15 ) moment of the v ion corresponds to fm and afm solutions .",
    "the orbital part of mm in the afm state comes out to be @xmath4 - 0.2 @xmath13 which is @xmath47 times less than the spin part of mm suggesting the weak soc in mvo with respect to zvo@xcite where large orbital moment of -0.75 @xmath13 has been reported .",
    "the direction of total mm is found to be @xmath411.3@xmath5 away from the @xmath6-axis .",
    "the small value of orbital moment and the direction of total magnetic moment are in consonance with the experimental findings where neutron scattering studies have revealed the small orbital moment and mm is tilted at @xmath48@xmath5 from the @xmath6-axis.@xcite however , the above calculated values of spin and orbital moments can not account for the experimentally observed magnetic moment of 0.47 @xmath13 . at this point",
    "it is important to note that the experimentally estimated magnetic moment of 0.63 @xmath13 for zvo is well accounted by taking into account the calculated large but negative orbital moment of -0.75 @xmath13.@xcite this indicates that the orbital sector of the mvo is not as influential as found in the zvo in deciding the magnetic state of the v ions .",
    "thus there may be a deeper reason for the experimentally observed small magnetic moment in the mvo which will be discussed in the next paragraph .",
    "the final spin and orbital ordering patterns obtained from the calculations are shown in fig .",
    "the spins are forming afm chains in the @xmath25 and @xmath26 directions and nearest neighbor afm chains are connected by lines with fm ordering .",
    "the afm chains are accompanied by ferro - orbital ordering ( foo ) where @xmath2 and @xmath3 orbitals are occupied along the @xmath25 and @xmath26 directions , respectively .",
    "the afoo supports the formation of fm chains where neighboring sites are alternatively occupied by @xmath2 and @xmath3 orbitals .",
    "these spin and orbital ordering patterns are in accordance with the goodenough - kanamori schemes . here",
    "it is important to note that historically goodenough has given the semi - covalent scheme for explaining the experimentally observed complex magnetic structures in la@xmath27ca@xmath28mno@xmath8 and predicted different oo corresponds to different spin arrangements.@xcite according to this scheme length of fm bond should be greater than that of afm bond .",
    "however , we have observed opposite behavior as afm bond is 0.03  larger than the fm bonds .    as mentioned above that the calculated small orbital moment of -0.2 @xmath13 for mvo can not account for the experimentally observed value of total mm @xmath40.47 @xmath13 , whereas calculated large orbital moment of -0.75 @xmath13 for zvo provides a good description of its experimentally observed total mm of 0.63 @xmath13 .",
    "these results appear to suggest that the geometrical frustration is still active in the tetragonal phase of mvo which can give rise to spin fluctuation at low temperature .",
    "such spin fluctuation is expected to reduce the mm drastically .",
    "the level of frustration in magnetic systems is defined by frustration index @xmath29 @xmath30 @xmath31@xmath32@xmath33@xmath31/@xmath34 , where @xmath32@xmath33 is the curie - weiss temperature and @xmath34 is the critical temperature at which the system ultimately develops long - range spin order.@xcite higher the value of @xmath29 more will be the level of frustration .",
    "thus the above conjecture about the activeness of frustration can further be tested by estimating the heisenberg exchange interaction strength ( @xmath35 ) between v moments on which @xmath32@xmath33 depends .",
    "the rough estimate of it can be found by mapping the energies of fm and afm solutions to the heisenberg hamiltonian.@xcite our calculation gives @xmath35@xmath2058 mev . using this value of @xmath35",
    "we have estimated the afm transition temperature based on mean - field theory and it comes out to be @xmath4925 k , which is closer to the experimental value of @xmath32@xmath33.@xcite using experimental @xmath34@xmath2042 k we have estimated the value of @xmath29@xmath2022 .",
    "such a large value of @xmath29 further strengthens the conjecture about the activeness of frustration in mvo compound .",
    "here it is important to note that the gga+@xmath14 formulation of density functional theory is a mean - field theory , which is not capable of addressing issue related with spin fluctuations directly .",
    "thus , to address this one needs to go beyond the mean - field theory .",
    "in conclusion , we have investigated the electronic and magnetic properties of a geometrically frustrated mgv@xmath0o@xmath1 by using _",
