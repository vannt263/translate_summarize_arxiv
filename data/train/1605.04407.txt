    "finsleroid - finsler metrics were introduced by g. s. asanov in 2006 . as a special case asanov produced singular ( y - local ) examples of landsberg spaces of dimension at least three that are not of berwald type .",
    "the existence of regular ( y - global ) landsberg metrics that are not of berwald type is an open problem up to this day , see d. bao @xcite .",
    "the cronology of the basic steps :    * 1998 - the central symmetric version of the finsleroid - finsler metric in @xcite . * 2003 - the non - symmetric version of the finsleroid - finsler metric in @xcite as _ asanov - type finslerian metric functions_. * 2006 - asanov s examples for ( non - symmetric ) finsleroid - finsler metrics that are of landsberg but not of berwald type in @xcite ; * 2016 - non - symmetric finsleroid - finsler metrics with closed finsleroid axis @xmath0-forms as the solutions of a conformal rigidity problem @xcite .    in this paper we prove that asanov s unicorns belong to the class of generalized berwald manifolds .",
    "more precisely we prove the following theorems : a finsleroid - finsler space is a generalized berwald space if and only if the finsleroid charge is constant .",
    "especially a finsleroid - finsler space is a landsberg space if and only if it is a generalized berwald manifold with a semi - symmetric compatible linear connection .",
    "the paper was motivated by the oral communication with professor david bao at the 50th symposium on finsler geometry ( 21 - 25 . oct .",

    "let @xmath1 be a manifold with local coordinates @xmath2 the induced coordinate system of the tangent manifold @xmath3 consists of the functions @xmath4 and @xmath5 where @xmath6 s refer to the coordinates of the base point and @xmath7 s denote the coordinates of the direction .",
    "a * finslerian metric * is a continuous function @xmath8 satisfying the following conditions : @xmath9 is smooth on the complement of the zero section ( regularity ) , @xmath10 for all @xmath11 ( positive homogenity ) and the hessian @xmath12 is positive definite at all nonzero elements @xmath13 ( strong convexity ) .",
    "it is called the riemann - finsler metric of the finsler manifold .",
    "the riemann - finsler metric makes each tangent space ( except at the origin ) a riemannian manifold with standard canonical objects such as the * volume form * @xmath14 the * liouville vector field * @xmath15 and the * induced volume form on the indicatrix hypersurface * @xmath16 . the coordinate expression is @xmath17 as a general reference of finsler geometry see @xcite ; we will use the following notations and terminology : @xmath18 is the so - called * first cartan tensor*. the first cartan tensor is totally symmetric and @xmath19 .",

    "a finsler manifold is a landsberg manifold if the landsberg tensor vanishes .",
    "the notion of generalized berwald manifolds goes back to v. wagner @xcite .",
    "the basic questions of the theory are the unicity of the compatible linear connection and its expression in terms of the canonical data of the finsler manifold ( intrinsic characterization ) . in case of a classical berwald manifold ( compatible linear connection with zero torsion ) the intrinsic characterization is the vanishing of the mixed curvature tensor of the berwald connection .",
    "this means that the quantities @xmath25 s depend only on the position .",
    "they constitute the coefficients of the compatible linear connection on the base manifold . in general the intrinsic characterization of the compatible linear connection",
    "is based on the so - called * averaged riemannian metric * @xmath26    using average processes is a new and important trend with a rapidly increasing number of papers in finsler geometry ; r. g. torrom @xcite , t. aikou @xcite , m. crampin @xcite and @xcite , v. s. matveev ( et . al .",
