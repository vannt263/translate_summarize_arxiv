    "the radiative return method  @xcite ( rrm ) allows an extraction of the hadronic cross section @xmath2 for hadronic invariant mass squared @xmath3 from the energy threshold up to the nominal energy of the experiment at the fixed beam energy @xmath4 colliders .",
    "high - luminosity meson factories are especially suited for this purpose  @xcite .",
    "interest in _ precise _ measurement of @xmath2 is motivated , in part , by its relevance to the hadronic contribution to the muon anomalous magnetic moment  @xmath5  @xcite and the electromagnetic fine structure constant  @xcite .",
    "however , the method can also be applied to extract the meson form factors and other meson properties .",
    "the rrm uses @xmath6 , a measured differential cross section , for the extraction of @xmath7 . for the theoretical description ,",
    "the perturbative qed diagrams at the leading order in qed coupling @xmath8 ( ) and at the next to leading order ( ) are considered and classified as initial - state radiation ( isr ) or final - state radiation ( fsr ) ones .",
    "the kinematic cuts are applied to sufficiently suppress the fsr , whenever possible , as the factorization @xmath9 , which allows for @xmath10 extraction , holds for diagrams with isr photons only .",
    "the function @xmath11 is given by qed .",
    "the fsr part is model - dependent , thus dedicated numerical studies are needed for correct isr - fsr separation .",
    "the monte carlo generator phokhara was developed for these and related purposes : fsr at  has been included  @xcite for pion pair production and , in addition to scalar qed ( sqed ) , some particular ingredients ( the @xmath12 radiative decay ) were implemented  @xcite .",
    "the fsr was also examined by other monte carlo programs , e.g. , that with the resonance chiral theory ( ) motivated framework  @xcite and phenomenologically - oriented model  @xcite , which was also included into phokhara  6.1  @xcite .",
    "the reaction @xmath13 was explored by kloe  @xcite : the cross section @xmath14 and pion form factor @xmath15 in the range",
    "@xmath16  gev@xmath17  gev@xmath18 were extracted  @xcite from the on - peak ( @xmath19  gev ) data sample by means of the rrm .",
    "however , the kinematic cuts , which were applied in order to suppress fsr , did not allow to measure at @xmath3 below @xmath16  gev@xmath18 .",
    "one can measure the @xmath15 in the threshold region relaxing some of the cuts , but then one has to _ subtract the fsr contribution_. in this scenario , one needs to control the description of the final - state emission process and detailed studies are needed to estimate the theoretical uncertainty . to simplify the analysis , it is better to perform the measurement off the @xmath12 meson peak , because in this case the contributions from the @xmath12 meson radiative decays are small and the fsr models can be controlled easier .",
    "the investigations presented here are of particular importance for the forthcoming kloe rrm analysis of pion pair production .",
    "we focus on the off-@xmath12-peak measurement , at @xmath4 center - of - mass energy @xmath1  gev , for which kloe collected @xmath20  pb@xmath21 of data  @xcite . due to the interest in precision at small @xmath3 ( i.e. , below the @xmath22 resonance ) , the chiral perturbation theory ( )  @xcite can be helpful .",
    "the relevant theoretical aspects are sketched in section  [ section_theory ] .",
    "we use monte carlo generator phokhara to compare several final - sate radiation models . the theoretical heritage of virtual compton scattering ( vcs ) off the pion in  framework  @xcite",
    "is used to estimate the rle of higher order  effects .",
    "the numerical results for cross section and asymmetry are presented in section  [ section_numer ] .",
    "all the parameters of implemented models are fixed independently , thus one deals with model _",
    "predictions_. in section  [ section_conclus ] we present our conclusions .",
    "the transition @xmath23 is described by the model - dependent fsr tensor @xmath24 reads : + @xmath25 , where @xmath26 . ] . in all realistic models",
    "it contains the same born - level contribution @xmath27 , which corresponds to a no - structure approximation for pion ( scalar qed or lowest - order ) .",
    "thus we consider @xmath27 as a model - independent part .    the first correction accounts for the pion structure by means of the pion form factor .",
    "it replaces the born - level amplitude by `` generalized born '' ( gb ) one  @xcite , @xmath28 , which is also called `` sqed*vmd ''  @xcite .",
    "generalized born fsr tensor reads @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the virtual and real photon momenta , @xmath32 and @xmath33  pion momenta ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "limit @xmath35 reproduces the @xmath27 amplitude .",
    "notice , that in @xmath0 at , @xmath36 , thus the form factor @xmath37 and its correction is never negligible .",
    "also this part is well established both theoretically and experimentally .    in the isr amplitude , with @xmath38 transition in the final state , one finds @xmath15 factor in the amplitude .",
    "therefore , the @xmath39 invariant mass distribution is governed by the form factor shape . for consistency",
    ", one has to use the same expression for the pion form factor in the isr and fsr amplitudes .",
    "it is important to take the form factor tested experimentally and not to rely only on a particular model assumptions .",
    "this will be illustrated in the next section . in order to understand the accuracy of @xmath28 approximation , we study further corrections using the models of refs .  @xcite .    the first model , `` vmd * '' , is based on @xmath40 @xmath41 description of vcs @xmath42  @xcite and that in @xmath43 case  @xcite .",
    "the fsr tensor has the form @xmath44 .",
    "the first term is given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : gb ] ) and a straightforward improvement beyond   is supposed ( denoted by prefix `` vmd * '' ) : the pion form factor @xmath45 is an external input ( e.g. , defined by parametrization of the measured @xmath45 ) .",
    "the second term , _ the non - born correction _ to fsr reads : @xmath46 , where f^nb_1 & = & ( ( |l_6 - |l_5 ) + _ ) , + f^nb_1 & = & ( 128 ^2(l^r_9 + l^r_10 ) + ( _ + _ k ) ) in @xmath41 and @xmath43 framework , correspondingly ; see original papers  @xcite for the explicit form of the loop functions @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "numerical values of the low energy constants are @xmath49  mev , @xmath50 and @xmath51  mev , as cited in  @xcite , and @xmath52 at scale @xmath53 , as estimated in  @xcite .",
    "the second model  @xcite , called the `` main model '' further in the text , can be considered as _ a parametrization _ of @xmath54 kloe data , transformed to @xmath55 via isospin symmetry  @xcite .",
    "it was implemented in fasterd monte carlo generator  @xcite and in phokhara  6.1 recently  @xcite .",
    "the fsr tensor contains @xmath28 given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : gb ] ) and the non - born corrections due to important vector - resonance and double - vector - resonance contributions .",
    "we use monte carlo generator phokhara to compare the model - dependent effects in @xmath56 cross section and asymmetry for the off - peak case at @xmath12-meson factory , @xmath1  gev .",
    "first of all , we stress that any simplification of the pion form factor @xmath45 can drastically affect the model results .",
    "figure  [ fig : cs : cs ] shows that rigorous @xmath40  form factor  @xcite gives completely wrong estimate for differential cross section even in the region of @xmath3 below the @xmath22 meson peak .",
    "the theoretical explanation of the form factor rle was given above .",
    "the form factor used in vmd *   and `` main model '' is the parametrization of available data given by gounaris - sakurai version of ref .",
    "@xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : cs : cs ] , one can see the very close cross section predictions , despite the fact , that the models have _ completely different _ non - born corrections .",
    "this is due to the fact that the gb contribution dominate for the given event selection . taking the gb approximation , eq .",
    "( [ eq : gb ] ) , as a reference , we plot @xmath57 - \\dd \\sigma[gb ] ) / \\dd \\sigma[gb]$ ] . to show the relative contribution of loop and `` constant '' terms in  we",
    "consider also the case of @xmath58 and @xmath59 being artificially set to zero .",
    "corresponding results are marked as `` loop only '' in the pictures .",
    "figure  [ fig : cs : nlonb ] shows that the non - born corrections are at a few per cent level . from fig .",
    "[ fig : cs : nlofsrisr ] one concludes that the fsr contribution to the cross section is significant in the whole range of @xmath3 , especially at low @xmath3 .",
    "pion forward - backward asymmetry ( fba ) as a function of @xmath3 reads a_fb(q^2 ) = ( q^2 ) in terms of numbers of events .",
    "origin of the non - zero fba is the interference of c - odd and c - even amplitudes , e.g. , that of isr and fsr at .",
    "thus , fba is sensitive to the relative phase , which may differ among the models even if they predict the same cross section .",
    "notice , that the experimental data on asymmetry and cross section are to large extent independent . therefore the fba is a good test for models",
    ". aspects of using the fba in @xmath0 were discussed in  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : fba ] shows that fba is sizable and relatively easy measurable . from fig .",
    "[ fig : fba : nb ] we conclude that the non - born corrections to the fba are of few per cent order and will not have a big influence on the theoretical uncertainty .",
    "it has to be stressed that if the  corrections were not accounted for in the formulae used to measure the @xmath60 , they are partly accounted for in the experimental parameters of @xmath45 and other model parameters . in other words , one model should be used in all experimental analyzes and adding _ ad hoc _ additional corrections is not appropriate .",
    "using phokhara , we studied the corrections given by  @xcite , and by a phenomenological model including miscellaneous hadronic resonance effects  @xcite .",
    "corrections due to @xmath61 resonance  @xcite are to be considered elsewhere .",
    "the rle of the pion form factor is seen to be very important .",
    "final - state radiation is significant in the whole range of @xmath3 , especially at low  @xmath3 .",
    "we have found the  corrections to be non - negligible , even if the generalized born contribution is dominant .",
    "non - born corrections are of order of few per cent .",
    "they differ among the models , but it will be difficult to distinguish them with the present kloe off - peak statistics .",
    "the results presented here show that one should include the  corrections in the analysis when the accuracy of the experiment reaches a per cent level .",
