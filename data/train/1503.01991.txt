    "<S> the thermal conductivity of ybrh@xmath0si@xmath0 has been measured down to very low temperatures under field in the basal plane . </S>",
    "<S> an additional channel for heat transport appears below 30mk , both in the antiferromagnetic and paramagnetic states , respectively below and above the critical field suppressing the magnetic order . </S>",
    "<S> this excludes antiferromagnetic magnons as the origin of this additional contribution to thermal conductivity . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , this low temperature contribution prevails a definite conclusion on the validity or violation of the wiedemann - franz law at the field - induced quantum critical point . at high temperature in the paramagnetic state , </S>",
    "<S> the thermal conductivity is sensitive to ferromagnetic fluctuations , previously observed by nmr or neutron scattering and required for the occurrence of the sharp electronic spin resonance fracture .        </S>",
    "<S> traditionally , heavy fermion intermetallics are viewed as systems lying close to the instability to an ordered magnetic state . </S>",
    "<S> the instability is driven by the competition between kondo screening of the local moments , and long range order of these moments , induced by rkky interactions . along the past decades </S>",
    "<S> , experimental and theoretical studies have endeavored to unveil the evolution of heavy fermions through the instability , focusing on the role of quantum fluctuations around the quantum critical point ( qcp ) @xcite . presently , the most prominent scenarios involve instabilities approaching the critical point from the paramagnetic ( pm ) side , either on some `` hot spots '' , which is the so - called `` spin density wave '' scenario , or extended over the whole surface , for the `` local quantum critical scenario '' . in the last case , </S>",
    "<S> the kondo screening mechanism would breakdown near the quantum critical point , leading to a change from a large fermi surface ( including the local moments ) in the paramagnetic state , to a `` small fermi surface '' when kondo coupling disappears @xcite . as a consequence </S>",
    "<S> , it is also believed that in this last scenario , which involves a collapse of the mechanism driving the heavy quasi - particles formation , when approaching the well - defined qcp , the low energy excitations would not be described by quasiparticles anymore . </S>",
    "<S> so experiments probing this local quantum critical scenario , are mainly trying to reveal a change of fermi surface ( fs ) volume across the qcp or a clear violation of predictions based on the notion of quasiparticles .    </S>",
    "<S> the antiferromagnetic ( af ) heavy fermion ybrh@xmath0si@xmath0 , has been a main playground for both experimental approaches , and strongly pushed forward as an archetype of heavy fermion driven by the local quantum criticality scenario @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the proximity of ybrh@xmath0si@xmath0 to af quantum criticality is attested by the low value of its nel temperature @xmath1mk , far smaller than its kondo temperature @xmath2k @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> experimentally , a major appeal of this system is that fine field tuning of the af - pm border can be used to monitor the proximity to the qcp @xcite . due to the large anisotropy of the magnetic properties , the critical field </S>",
    "<S> @xmath3 driving the af - pm instability is also anisotropic , respectively 0.066 t and 0.6 t in the easy magnetization plane ( * a*,*b * ) , and along the * c * axis of the body centered tetragonal crystal . </S>",
    "<S> evidence of fs reconstruction at @xmath3 are mainly based on hall effect measurements @xcite </S>",
    "<S> . however , heavy fermions are multiband systems , so that the interpretation of the hall effect is not straightforward . </S>",
    "<S> other concomitant proof of the fs reconstruction in ybrh@xmath0si@xmath0 must be found . </S>",
    "<S> no convincing changes of the fs at @xmath3 appear on the thermoelectric power @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> recently , the debate has been focused on the detection of a breakdown of the fermi - liquid regime at @xmath3 , using thermal transport at low temperature as a probe : a violation of the wiedemann - franz law ( wfl ) would point out a deep change of the electronic excitations responsible for charge and heat transport @xcite . in metallic systems , at @xmath4  k , when quasiparticle scattering is dominated by elastic mechanisms , all reported cases but one satisfy the wfl , stating that @xmath5 in the low temperature limit , where @xmath6 is the lorenz ratio and @xmath7 is the lorenz number ( @xmath8 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the only case reported so far that would not satisfy the wfl in this limit is cecoin@xmath9 , for the heat current along the * c*-axis @xcite , which has been put forward as a demonstration of breakdown of the quasiparticle picture in a `` hot spot '' qcp scenario . </S>",
    "<S> but even in this last case , one can not exclude that measurements below 30mk ( the lowest temperature reached in @xcite ) would invalidate the violation of the wfl .    </S>",
    "<S> three different groups have recently published thermal conductivity ( @xmath10 ) experiments coupled with careful resistivity ( @xmath11 ) experiments in ybrh@xmath0si@xmath0 , in order to study the temperature dependence of the lorenz ratio @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> contradictory conclusions have been drawn by the three groups . </S>",
    "<S> the first one @xcite claims that the wfl is violated at @xmath3 , as @xmath13 , while the others concluded conservatively that @xmath14 at @xmath3 is @xmath15 @xcite . however , all the experimental data of the three groups are in good agreement : the main differences lie in the interpretation , and in the lowest temperature reached , i.e. in the extrapolation of the zero temperature values . </S>",
    "<S> this last point is a very sensitive issue , as an additional contribution to the electronic thermal conductivity appears at very low temperatures ( below 30mk ) in ybrh@xmath0si@xmath0 , which is very difficult to separate from the quasiparticles contribution . </S>",
    "<S> the measurements we report in the present paper , were realized down to 10mk , twice lower than in those reported in @xcite , and with a strong emphasis on the analysis of this extra contribution , notably to detect if anything specific happens at the critical field @xmath3 .    </S>",

    "<S> it is the same as used in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite for the thermoelectric power and magnetoresistance studies . </S>",
    "<S> the residual resistivity ratio rrr @xmath16 of the crystal is 65 , the observation of quantum oscillations in the resistivity indicates its high quality . </S>",
    "<S> the magnetic field was applied parallel to the current ( longitudinal configuration : * h*//**j**@xmath17//[1,1,0 ] ) , up to 4 t . </S>",
    "<S> the zero field measurements have been performed with a zero field cooled magnet . at low field </S>",
    "<S> , a calibrated hall sensor has been used to determine precisely the applied magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> the thermal conductivity was measured using a standard two thermometers - one heater setup , and was checked to be independent of the heat gradient applied , with @xmath18 in the range 0.5 - 10% . </S>",
    "<S> calibration of the thermometers was realized in situ , against a cmn paramagnetic salt in zero field for temperatures below 0.1k and down to 7mk , and against reference thermometers ( calibrated with the cmn ) placed in the compensated zone of the magnet for field measurements . </S>",
    "<S> the electrical resistivity was measured simultaneously , with a conventional lock - in detection at low frequency ( around 2hz , for minimum quadrature signal ) , allowing a precise determination of @xmath19 .    </S>",
    "<S> si@xmath0 at 0 t ( in black ) and at 70mt , close to @xmath3 ( in red ) at low temperature . </S>",
    "<S> clear anomalies are observed in zero field at @xmath20 , and a new channel for heat transport appears below 30mk ( see text ) . </S>",
    "<S> _ inset _ : normalized ratio @xmath21 in the whole temperature range at 0 t and 70mt . , </S>",
    "<S> scaledwidth=75.0% ]    figure [ fig1 ] compares the electrical resistivity @xmath11 , and the thermal resistivity @xmath22 , at low temperature ( below 0.15k ) , for zero magnetic field ( @xmath23 = 0 t ) and very slightly above the critical field @xmath3 ( @xmath23 = 70mt ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is the most important result , but let us first describe the insert which gives a broader view thanks to an extended temperature range ( from 7mk up to 7k ) . </S>",
    "<S> it displays the lorenz ratio @xmath21 for both fields , with a logarithmic temperature scale : there is a large temperature range , from 3k down to 0.02k , where the normalized ratio @xmath21 is clearly below 1 , down to a value @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> this is indicative of dominant inelastic scattering ( the so - called `` vertical processes '' ) , which affect more strongly thermal than electrical transport . </S>",
    "<S> the rather unusual feature is that despite a large residual resistivity ( the rrr is `` only '' 65 for our sample ) , inelastic scattering has a significant contribution down to such low temperatures . but </S>",
    "<S> this is consistent with the marked temperature dependence of the resistivity down to the lowest measured temperatures ( 8mk ) , as can be seen on the main graph . </S>",
    "<S> inversely , the fast increase of the lorenz ratio above 2k , overpassing 1 above 3k , indicates additional contributions to the heat transport ( like phonons ) .    </S>",
    "<S> these `` bosonic '' contributions are expected to vanish rapidly below 1k , and therefore , the new increase of the lorenz ratio above 1 below 20mk is again a very unusual feature , which could not be anticipated from the resistivity behavior . </S>",
    "<S> this low - temperature increase of the lorenz ratio has been already observed below 30mk by pfau _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . _ </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , on a slightly more resistive sample ( rrr @xmath25 instead of 65 ) . </S>",
    "<S> but we insist that this is probably the most puzzling feature of thermal transport in ybrh@xmath0si@xmath0 : how is it that new bosonic excitations , able to contribute as a new heat channel , appear at such low temperatures ? </S>",
    "<S> moreover , contrary to the statement in @xcite , we observe that this increase is essentially unchanged for a field of 70mt , suppressing the long range af order , and the putative magnon ( long lived ) excitations expected in this ordered phase . </S>",
    "<S> discussion of the origin and field evolution of this contribution is continued later in this paper .    the main plot of fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] shows the detailed evolution of @xmath11 and @xmath26 below 0.15k , down to 10mk : in particular , one clearly observes a kink at @xmath20 in zero field on the electrical and thermal transport . </S>",
    "<S> it is suppressed by an applied field of 70mt ( very close to @xmath3 ) , which also lowers both resistivities . </S>",
    "<S> it demonstrates that the critical fluctuations emerging in the neighborhood of the af transition contribute to the scattering of the quasiparticles . </S>",
    "<S> however , this scattering seems to be rapidly damped below @xmath20 , as no change of @xmath26 is observed below 50mk , between zero field and 70mt . </S>",
    "<S> concerning now the additional low temperature contribution , the strong decrease of @xmath26 below 30mk appears independent of the applied field . </S>",
    "<S> it already shows the difficulty to discuss the validity of the wfl : the linear extrapolation of the data of @xmath26 between 30 and 50mk is compatible , within the dispersion of the points , with that of the resistivity at 0k . </S>",
    "<S> the whole question is to control these extrapolations , or to estimate the amplitude and range of the extra contribution responsible for the low temperature drop of @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> but in any case , on the bare data , no drastic change is seen between zero field and @xmath3 .    </S>",
    "<S> figure [ fig3 ] compares the relative temperature variation of @xmath21 for fields above @xmath3 , up to 4 t ( see supplementary material a , figure [ figs2 ] for the data of @xmath10 and @xmath11 ) . </S>",
    "<S> it appears that the low temperature increase of the lorenz ratio is field sensitive above 100mt , and rapidly suppressed for rather weak fields ( above 0.2 t ) . </S>",
    "<S> this supports a magnetic origin for this additional heat channel , which is reasonable as we did not expect a sizable phonon contribution at such low temperatures . in parallel </S>",
    "<S> , we do observe that the decrease below one of the lorenz ratio above 30mk is also progressively suppressed under field , pointing to a magnetic origin of the low temperature inelastic scattering . </S>",
    "<S> however under field , for h @xmath27 t ( see also insert up to 4 t ) , @xmath28 seems to saturate at 0.97 @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> this small deviation from @xmath15 may be due to experimental precision , or related to the complex multiband structure of the fs . </S>",
    "<S> in any case , the fact that this value does not change with fields much larger than @xmath3 means that it can not be seen as a violation of the wfl at the qcp . in the following , particularly to estimate the electronic contribution , the lorenz number is taken at this value found for @xmath29 0k : @xmath30 .     at low temperatures below 1 t . </S>",
    "<S> the dashed lines are the extrapolation to @xmath30 when t @xmath31 30mk . in inset , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath21 at higher fields , which extrapolates also to 0.97 at low temperature.,scaledwidth=75.0% ]        as regards the question of the origin of the additional contribution to thermal transport appearing below 30mk ( hereafter labelled @xmath32 ) , all hints point to a magnetic origin : ( i ) even if it survives the critical field , it is rapidly suppressed by fields of order of 0.5 t ; ( ii ) a new phononic contribution is completely unexpected in this temperature range : it would require a strong lattice instability , which has not been detected so far ; ( iii ) besides the antiferromagnetic long range order at 70mk , other magnetic transitions have been reported at 12mk @xcite and/or 2mk @xcite . in reference </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , @xmath32 has been attributed to magnons , an assumption supported by comparison to the specific heat ( @xmath33 ) data : the temperature dependence of @xmath33 has a bare @xmath34 regime below @xmath35mk @xcite , which is attributed to af magnons . because it exists even when the long range ordered state is suppressed , we would rather compare @xmath32 in ybrh@xmath0si@xmath0 to a similar additional contribution to heat transport observed in the ferromagnet ucoge , both above and below t@xmath36 , and also in a very low temperature range ( for the heat current along the * b*-axis ) @xcite </S>",
    "<S> . obviously </S>",
    "<S> , `` paramagnons '' or overdamped spin fluctuations , can also contribute to an additional heat transport channel .    </S>",
    "<S> quantitatively , we will perform a similar analysis as in @xcite , assuming that we can separate the electronic contribution in a quasiparticle @xmath37 channel , which should follow ( or not ! ) the wfl , and a `` spin - fluctuation '' contribution @xmath32 , expected for example to be much less sensitive to the rrr . </S>",
    "<S> as for the case of ucoge , a difficulty for quantitative estimation of @xmath32 is that the quasiparticle contribution is badly known , due to the importance of inelastic scattering even at 30mk ( see the lorenz ratio in figure [ fig1 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> so we assume that @xmath37 can be described by @xcite : @xmath38    this expression takes into account the stronger effect of the electronic inelastic scattering on the thermal transport ( than on the electrical transport ) , through the factor @xmath39 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath40 is the residual resistivity and @xmath41 , where @xmath42 and @xmath43 are respectively the scattering rates due to vertical ( small wave - vector transfer @xmath44 , inelastic ) and horizontal ( large @xmath44 , mostly elastic ) processes , assuming that mathiessen s rule holds . </S>",
    "<S> the crude simplification is to take @xmath39 constant , which can be valid for temperatures much smaller than the typical energy of the fluctuations responsible for the inelastic scattering . </S>",
    "<S> this simplification has already been widely used for the heavy fermion systems like upt@xmath45 @xcite , cerhin@xmath9 @xcite and ucoge @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the figure [ fig4 ] compares the bare data with different estimates of @xmath37 for @xmath46 i.e @xmath47 and @xmath48 , at 0 t ( in the af state ) , 70mt ( close to @xmath3 ) and 0.27 t ( in the pm state ) . </S>",
    "<S> clearly , @xmath46 overestimates the quasiparticle contribution , whereas @xmath48 ( the best value we found ) gives an estimate of @xmath37 compatible with the data for the three fields . </S>",
    "<S> it even gives a fair account of the data between 30mk and 100mk at 0.27 t . </S>",
    "<S> the extracted extra contribution is shown in the supplementary material a , figure [ figs3 ] .    </S>",
    "<S> the most important information from the analysis shown on figure [ fig4 ] is that little change is observed between zero field and @xmath3 , apart from the suppression of the anomaly at @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> otherwise , ( i ) it is possible to analyze the data of thermal transport in ybrh@xmath0si@xmath0 , assuming that the quasiparticle contribution follows the wfl even at @xmath3 , and with the same coefficient @xmath49 describing the effect of inelastic scattering ; ( ii ) @xmath32 is little influenced by the suppression of the nel temperature at @xmath3 , and really starts to decrease only above this field ( see also figure [ figs3 ] of the supplementary material a ) , pointing to a contribution of driven ( robust ) short range correlations .    for point ( i ) </S>",
    "<S> , it will be very difficult to reach firmer conclusions , as even lower temperature measurements would face the problem of the dominant additional contributions , and of the difficulty of a robust quantitative analysis , together with the regimes introduced by the additional transitions at 12 and 2mk @xcite . for point ( ii ) , this is similar to observations on the thermopower , where the change of regime under field occurs far above @xmath3 @xcite , and little is seen when crossing @xmath3 .    </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the question of the role of magnetic fluctuations in the heat transport in ybrh@xmath0si@xmath0 is not limited to the low temperature regime . also at high temperatures , above 1k </S>",
    "<S> , we can detect a field dependence of @xmath26 , which ( like for resistivity ) , points to a contribution of magnetic fluctuations on the scattering mechanisms . </S>",
    "<S> in this temperature range , microscopic measurements have revealed a complex situation : nmr experiments @xcite have shown that af fluctuations with finite wavevectors compete with ferromagnetic ( fm ) fluctuations ; recent investigations by nmr @xcite gives the image of interfering fermi liquid and non fermi liquid component close to @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> neutron scattering experiments @xcite down to 0.1k up to 10 t along the * c*-axis confirm that incommensurate af correlations become dominant on cooling against the fm correlations , while the magnetic field induces a zeeman resonant excitation . </S>",
    "<S> these fm fluctuations could be an important ingredient to understand the observation of a well defined electron spin resonance in ybrh@xmath0si@xmath0 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> so at least far from @xmath20 or at high magnetic field , fm coupling may be dominant , pointing to the proximity of a fm qcp @xcite . we do find ( see supplementary material b ) that the thermal resistivity above 1k behaves as predicted by ueda and moriya @xcite when inelastic scattering is controlled by ferromagnetic fluctuations .    </S>",
    "<S> to summarize we have investigated in detail the thermal transport of ybrh@xmath0si@xmath0 , in the af phase and in the pm phase , below and above @xmath3 , and extended the measurements down to 10mk . </S>",
    "<S> this study clearly shows that an additional magnetic contribution to thermal conductivity appears below 30mk , with a gradual decrease for fields above the critical field @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> this has been deduced with an electronic quasiparticle contribution , which also has no peculiar singularity at @xmath3 , and satisfies the wfl even at @xmath3 . to conclude unambiguously , by direct measurements , if the wfl is satisfied or violated , would require measurements down to the mk temperature range , where the additional contribution should eventually disappear . </S>",
    "<S> but other recent experiments also challenge the `` local qcp scenario '' , which could have led to the violation of the wfl at the critical field : for example , arpes measurements @xcite show that above @xmath20 , the 4f - electrons in the paramagnetic phase are clearly itinerant , which leaves open the validity of the image of small and large fermi surface fluctuations developed in the kondo breakdown scenario . </S>",
    "<S> a new appealing approach is the so - called `` strong coupling theory '' of heavy - fermion quantum criticality , where large critical spin fluctuations at the af wave - vector induce fluctuations at small wave - vectors , producing a diverging effective mass over the entire fermi surface @xcite </S>",
    "<S> . it would be interesting to see if these fluctuations could be responsible for the detected low temperature contribution , as well as to the large inelastic scattering observed down to very low temperatures ?    </S>",
