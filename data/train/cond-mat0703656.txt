    "uranium dioxide ( uo@xmath0 ) is widely used as fuel material in nuclear reactors .",
    "it was extensively studied from 1940th in physical , chemical and thermodynamic properties by experimental and theoretical methods ( especially during last decade ) due to its important applications .",
    "@xcite the shortage of energy around the world makes us ask for more contribution from nuclear power , where the burn - up efficiency of nuclear fuels is a bottle - neck . in order to tackle",
    "this difficulty , understanding the detailed behavior of fuel materials under burning - up and irradiation is important .",
    "recent use of fuel materials to high burn - up shows many microstructure formations , which is not possible to access by empirical approach and atomic scale theoretical analysis is highly requested.@xcite    previous theoretical studies on uo@xmath0 mainly focused on defects effects arised from irradiation damages@xcite and thermodynamic properties near ambient pressure@xcite with semi - empirical approaches .",
    "electronic properties and large scale intrinsic structural behavior under disturbance ( say , compression , tension and distortion of lattice ) were rarely investigated in despite of its importance in most properties of uo@xmath0 .",
    "this partly is due to the lacking of a reliable method to deal with this kind of complex materials before .",
    "the development of density functional theory ( dft ) changed the situation greatly and provides a quantum mechanics based theoretical approach to tackle this problem.@xcite    however , to our knowledge only a few _ ab initio _ electronic structure studies have been published on uo@xmath0 , most of which were based on conventional lda or gga approximation of the exchange - correlation energy.@xcite it is well recognized that strong coulomb correlation among partly filled _ f _ electrons of uranium atoms makes these approximations failed . usually a metallic ground state is predicted for uo@xmath0 instead of the experimental observed antiferromagnetic semiconductor.@xcite the same problem exists for transition metal oxides , and raises questions about the applicability of dft approach to these materials .",
    "fortunately , a method combining spin - polarized local density approximation ( lsda ) and on - site coulomb repulsion among localized _ d _ or _ f _ electrons,@xcite namely , lsda+u method was proposed and has shown its capability to treat this problem.@xcite    usually a hubbard hamiltonian with two empirical parameters is employed to describe the coulomb interaction between 5__f _ _ electrons localized on uranium sites in uo@xmath0 . adding this hamiltonian to the conventional lsda ( or ggs ) energy functional ,",
    "one arrives at a point where all orbitals except those included in the model hamiltonian are treated within the framework of lsda ( or ggs ) while the localized 5__f _ _ states are treated by the unrestricted hartree - fock ( uhf ) approximation,@xcite namely , @xmath3+\\frac{(u - j)}{2}\\sum_{l , j,\\sigma}\\rho_{lj}^{\\sigma}\\rho_{jl}^{\\sigma } , \\label{eq : lsda+u}\\ ] ] where @xmath4 is the density matrix of electrons occupying a partly filled electron shell ( 5__f _ _ in uo@xmath0 ) , @xmath5 refers to spin direction , and @xmath6 is the kohn - sham eigenvalues .",
    "self - consistent solution of dft with this energy functional gives that strong correlation effects associated with 5__f _ _ states are going to affect all other states as well , in particular though 2__p _ _ states of oxygen do not influenced by hubbard correlations directly , they are really linked to localized 5__f _ _ states via hybridization terms .",
    "it is necessary to point out that lsda+u method is not a self - determined approach .",
    "the results depend on model parameters @xmath7 and @xmath8 very much , which should be chosen carefully by comparing with experimental data .",
    "fortunately this can be done very well with just a small set of data and preserve the predicability of the method mostly.@xcite    there have been several works with lsda+u approximation on uranium dioxide published .",
    "all of them were near the equilibrium volume at ambiance pressure for fluorite structure and focused mainly on electron energy loss spectra@xcite and magnetic structure.@xcite these calculations showed that the results of lsda+u in a well agreement with experiments .",
    "however , no attempt was made to investigate the structural behavior of uo@xmath0 under pressures with lsda+u method , which may be fundamental for understanding the behavior of nuclear fuel under irradiations . by far",
    "the validity of lsda+u method beyond fluorite structure for uo@xmath0 has not been confirmed yet .",
    "recent hydrostatic compression experiment@xcite makes it possible to check it by comparing with measured equation of state .",
    "on the other hand , first principles calculations without hubbard correction on gga(s ) approximation showed that it can give almost correct energy information for uo@xmath0@xcite regardless a wrong electronic band structure was predicted .",
    "specially , by calculating the lattice parameter and bulk modulus of fluorite structure uo@xmath0 with various approximations , j. c. boettger argued that density gradient corrections , spin polarization and spin - orbit coupling effects are equally important , and suggested when only structural properties are concerned lsda+u is not necessary.@xcite however the predicted wrong ferromagnetic ground state weakened the creditability of his argument .",
    "other calculations ignored spin - orbit coupling also gave reasonable lattice parameter and bulk modulus,@xcite indicates spin - orbit coupling is not so important for this case ( though a large impact on magnetic property is expected ) .",
    "we will show in this paper that it should be careful when gga(s ) approximation is used because the coincidence of cohesive energies of uo@xmath0 calculated by ggs with lsda+u approximations is valid only for fluorite phase .",
    "an energy difference will appear if other structures are involved .",
    "in this paper we will study the structural stability of fluorite phase ( with @xmath9 space group ) and cotunnite phase ( @xmath10 space group ) of uranium dioxide under hydrostatic pressures using dft method based on lsda and ggs approximations plus hubbard correction .",
    "calculation methodology is presented briefly in next section .",
    "we will discuss a little bit about the widely used rule of common tangent of energy curves to determine the transition pressure of pressure - induced structural transition , because this rule fails in a case when an energy barrier existed .",
    "a more general rule is proposed , which can give the energy barrier when experimental transition pressure is available .",
    "finally , a detailed comparison of our results with static high - pressure experiments is given , associating with a discussion on ultra - high pressure behavior of uo@xmath0 crystal .",
    "total energy curves of both phases ( @xmath10 and @xmath9 ) at different volumes are computed with vasp code.@xcite the _ pnma _ structure is fully relaxed to get all hellman - feynman forces smaller than @xmath11ev /  , while fluorite structure keeps the ideal geometry due to all coordinates are completely determined by the symmetry . for comparison , both spin - polarized generalized gradient approximation ( ggs)@xcite and local density approximation ( lsda)@xcite with / without hubbard @xmath7 term energy functional are used .",
    "the parameters of hubbard term are taken as @xmath12ev and @xmath13ev , which was checked carefully by s. l. dudarev _",
    "et al . _ for fluorite uo@xmath0.@xcite calculations",
    "employ projector - augmented wave ( paw ) pseudopotentials@xcite with a cutoff kinetic energy for planewaves of 400ev .",
    "integrations in reciprocal space are performed in the first brillouin zone with 18 irreducible k - points for fluorite structure and at least 28 irreducible k - points for cotunnite phase generated with the monkhorst - pack@xcite scheme .",
    "its convergence is well checked .",
    "the energy tolerance for the charge self - consistency convergence is set to @xmath14ev for all calculations .",
    "cohesive energies at different volumes are extracted from the total energies by subtracting spin - polarized isolated atom contributions .",
    "then , they are fitted to a morse - type energy function @xmath15 } -1\\right)^{2}-1\\right ] \\label{eq : morse}\\ ] ] to facilitate post - analysis .",
    "it is necessary to point out that for _ pnma _ phase we also used a different @xmath7 value obtained by fitting to experimental data of @xmath10 phase since @xmath12ev fails to predict the correct transition pressure .",
    "this implies that structure or lattice distortions would have considerable impact on on - site coulomb interaction .",
    "for the same structure , however , we find the dependence of @xmath7 on pressure is ignorable .",
    "the equation of state ( or compression curve ) at zero - kelvin is calculated directly by an infinitesimal variation of cohesive energy with respect to volume given by @xmath16 .",
    "usually the phase transition pressure is determined by the common tangent of their energy curves , which can be derived simply as follows . at thermodynamic equilibrium state under finite pressure , the enthalpy must be minimized , i.e. , @xmath17 . in a case two phases in equilibrium , there is a variation of enthalpy with respect to the concentration of each phase besides with respect to volumes .",
    "the latter gives @xmath18 ( where @xmath19 is phase label ) and the former results in @xmath20 with @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the concentration variation of , say , the first phase and @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) is the energy ( volume ) difference between these two phases .",
    "the balance condition of pressure requires @xmath25 ( for @xmath26 ) , namely , @xmath27 it is exactly the common tangent rule for transition pressure of pressure induced structural transitions .",
    "evidently , @xmath28 provides the least energy @xmath23 required to drive a transition from phase @xmath29 to phase @xmath30 .",
    "the transition pressure equals to @xmath31 if no energy barrier exists , which is a common case for usual metals and alloys .",
    "however , when an energy barrier with an amplitude of @xmath32 is involved,@xcite the work done by external pressure @xmath33 should be large enough to get over the barrier in addition to the energy difference @xmath23 .",
    "then the variation of enthalpy with respect to phase concentration should be @xmath34 .",
    "obviously the common tangent rule becomes invalid here .",
    "the hysteresis pressure is given by @xmath35 .",
    "without knowledge about the energy barrier , one can not determine the transition pressure @xmath33 by energy curves itself .",
    "however , in contrast , one can deduce the energy barrier amplitude with measured transition pressure @xmath33 by @xmath36",
    ".[tab : cohee ] cohesive energies of uranium dioxide at 0 gpa . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      +    calculated cohesive energies with different approximations for fluorite ( @xmath9 ) and cotunnite ( @xmath10 ) structures of uranium dioxide as well as the parameters fitting to eq.([eq : morse ] ) are listed in table [ tab : cohee ] , where the energy is for per atom and equilibrium cell volume is given by @xmath37 .",
    "the cohesive energy for a cell of u@xmath38o@xmath39 is given by multiplying @xmath40 with 12 .",
    "for comparison purpose , other calculated and observed values@xcite are also listed .",
    "it should be noticed that _ pnma _",
    "phase has a smaller effective cubic lattice constant and bulk modulus than fluorite phase at zero - pressure , which implies it will become stable under compression .",
    "variation of cohesive energy of @xmath9 phase along cubic lattice constant ( @xmath41 ) is shown in figure [ fig : cohe - fm3 m ] .",
    "it is interesting to see that ggs and lsda+u give quite similar energy curves , confirming previous calculations that ggs also can give reasonable energy information for fluorite phase of uo@xmath0 in spite of the corresponding electronic density of state ( dos ) is wrong.@xcite however , we should emphasize here that it is just a coincidence .",
    "analogous to the case without hubbard correction , lsda+u overestimates the binding energy slightly and ggs+u underestimates it . on the other hand _",
    "term uplifts the binding energy wholly , and results in this coincidence .",
    "we can also see from table [ tab : cohee ] that paw method outperforms ordinary pseudo - potentials both for ggs and lsda approximations in terms of equilibrium volume , cohesive energy and bulk modulus.@xcite furthermore , our lsda+u calculations with paw potentials give results in perfect agreement with experiments@xcite ( in particular the calculated equilibrium lattice constant of 5.44 vs observed 5.46 and bulk modulus of 208.3gpa vs 208.9gpa ) .",
    "it also predicts an antiferromagnetic ground state with a band gap of @xmath11.45ev , agrees with previous calculation very well.@xcite to reproduce the x - ray photoelectron spectroscopy@xcite observed band gap of @xmath12ev , dudarev _ et al_. argued that to take spin - orbit coupling into account@xcite is necessary .",
    "we confirmed this by a spin - orbit coupling calculation implemented in vasp which gives a band gap of 2.04ev .",
    "ggs+u approximation , however , gives a larger equilibrium lattice constant and smaller bulk modulus , despite the cohesive energy is more close to the observed value , as well as a band gap of 1.6ev .",
    "totally speaking , lsda+u outperforms ggs+u approximation for this set of _ u _ term parameters .",
    "it is necessary to point out that the discrepancy with previous lmto calculation@xcite should be owing to their convergence precision is not so good .",
    "their calculation gave quite poor mechanical properties@xcite that implying the force is inaccurate .",
    "later calculation by the same authors improved this.@xcite the spin - orbit coupling is ignored in our following calculations .",
    "the resulting error can be estimated at a lattice constant of 5.44 for fluorite phase , where spin - orbit coupling decreases the cohesive energy about 0.3ev for per atom , very close to the energy difference between ggs and lsda+u at the same volume .",
    "thus we can expect that neglect spin - orbit coupling will gives an error of 0.012 in lattice constant and 3gpa in bulk modulus , the same difference as ggs .      to optimize the geometry of @xmath10 phase at different pressure , lsda+u method with @xmath12ev is employed . to avoid the pulay stress problem ( which arised from the fact that the plane wave basis set is not complete with respect to changes of the volume ) ,",
    "structure relaxation calculations are performed at fixed volumes rather than under constant pressures .",
    "then pressure is derived from the energy - volume relation .",
    "the structure is fully relaxed to optimize all internal coordinates and cell shape , while the symmetry of @xmath10 space group is kept .",
    "calculated cohesive energy curve is shown in figure [ fig : cohe - pnma - fm3 m ] .",
    "for comparison the curve of fluorite phase is also given as dash - dotted line .",
    "it shows that under high pressure @xmath10 phase becomes stable . a transition pressure of 7.8gpa is given by the slope of common tangent as showing in the inset .",
    "this value is quite unexpected because it is less than @xmath42 of the experiment observation as @xmath142gpa.@xcite it is very small even if compared with another early measurement that predicted a pressure - induced phase transition to orthorhombic @xmath43 phase at @xmath129gpa@xcite ( which has not yet been repeated by other authors ) .",
    "nevertheless , the calculated volume reduction of 6.4% agrees well with the observed 7% at the beginning of cotunnite phase.@xcite    then one may ask what is the matter with it ?",
    "is the lsda+u approximation wrong ? from table [",
    "tab : cohee ] and the comparison of its results at equilibrium volume with experimental data for fluorite phase , we do not think so .",
    "actually , as figure [ fig : eos ] shows , lsda+u gives a compression curve that agrees very well with experiments@xcite for @xmath9 phase , which means that the hubbard @xmath7 parameter is reasonable and insensitive to pressure .",
    "clearly we can not attribute this deviation to the failure of density functional theory or lsda+u approximation .",
    "figure [ fig : eos ] also shows the p - v curve calculated with ggs approximation .",
    "it is worse than lsda+u and the transition pressure is also as low as 32gpa .",
    "a hysteresis pressure about 34gpa is estimated by using the transition pressures observed in experiment and calculated with @xmath12ev , which are marked by arrows b and a in figure [ fig : eos ] , respectively . as discussed in previous section",
    ", this hysteresis of transition pressure would imply an energy barrier existing .",
    "in fact it is very common for ionic crystal and semiconductors.@xcite for example a phase transition of gan from wurtzite to rocksalt phase , where a large hysteresis of pressure is observed . by using eq.([eq : barrier ] ) , the cohesive energy curves of @xmath10 and @xmath9 phases ( eq.([eq : morse ] ) and parameters listed in table [ tab : cohee ] ) , and the experimental transition pressure of 42gpa,@xcite we estimate an energy barrier as @xmath12.1ev per cell ( u@xmath38o@xmath39 ) .",
    "this value is large enough to survive @xmath10 phase to ambient condition .",
    "unfortunately , no experiment shows this event .",
    "therefore , the only possibility is that the discrepancy in @xmath10 phase resulted from the dependence of @xmath7 on structure ( or lattice distortions ) .",
    "we obtained a different @xmath7=6.0ev by fitting to the measured p - v data of @xmath10 phase . the resulting energy curve and morse function parameters",
    "are given in figure [ fig : cohe - pnma - fm3 m ] and table [ tab : cohee ] , respectively .",
    "we can see @xmath44ev gives a quite similar energy curve as @xmath12ev , except the wholly uplifting of the curve .",
    "hereafter , all calculations will be performed for @xmath7=6.0ev and @xmath7=4.5ev separately , so we assign the former case as _",

    "u__6 is more credible than _ _",
    "u__45 since it is compatible with the fact that _ no _ _ pnma _ phase has been observed under ambient condition",
    ". the calculated reduction of volume at transition from @xmath9 to @xmath10 phase is 6.2% , close to _",
    "_ u__45 case , also agrees well with experimental data .",
    "figure [ fig : dos - f ] compares the density of state ( dos ) of 5__f _ _ states in @xmath9 and @xmath10 phases of uo@xmath0 at a cell volume of 131.4@xmath45 , close to the transition pressure of _ _ u__6 case .",
    "the most remarkable difference is the increase of band gap from 0.8ev in fluorite phase to 2.4ev in @xmath10 phase . as a consequence",
    ", unoccupied states also move outwards . below the fermi level , different from fluorite phase where a nearly dispersionless band containing two well - localized 5__f _ _ electrons that lies roughly from -1.8 to 0ev , in @xmath10 phase these localized states are further narrowed to start from -1.0ev , while the valence 5__f _ _",

    "the variation of local magnetic moment of uranium atoms with cell volume is almost the same for @xmath10 and @xmath9 phases in _ _ u__45 case , implying the magnetic property is insensitive to structural transition in uo@xmath0 . as figure",
    "[ fig : mag ] shows , in despite of that ggs+u and lsda+u approximations give much different cohesive energies for the fluorite phase , the calculated magnetic moment of uranium atoms is very close for a large range of volume , except for the highly expansion region ( @xmath46@xmath45 ) where atoms trend to be isolated . at equilibrium volume , our calculation gives a moment of @xmath11.93@xmath47 in a good agreement with previous calculation@xcite and slightly larger than observed @xmath48.@xcite it can be improved by including spin - orbit coupling to @xmath49 with an orbit contribution of @xmath50 .",
    "this value is much smaller than all - electron calculation where an orbit moment of @xmath51 was predicted.@xcite    as shown in figure [ fig : mag ] , there is a flat level for the local magnetic moment of uranium within moderate pressure range . a transition from antiferromagnetism to paramagnetism",
    "is observed at a volume between 102.1@xmath1108.4@xmath45 for _ _ u__45 case ( equivalent to 121 and 159gpa in pressure ) .",
    "it corresponds to a volume of 63@xmath166.4% of the equilibrium volume of fluorite phase and an effective cubic lattice constant as 86@xmath188% of the latter phase .",
    "u _ to 6.0ev postpones the paramagnetic transition to higher pressure as 226@xmath1294gpa , which has an effective cubic lattice constant that is 82@xmath184% of the fluorite phase at ambient condition .",
    "it is worthwhile to point out that at the same volume a metallic transition also occurs due to completely delocalization of 5__f _ _ states .",
    "figure [ fig : tdos ] shows the total dos of @xmath10 uo@xmath0 under high pressures .",
    "we can see the band gap disappear completely between 226@xmath1294gpa .",
    "the transition volume is in a good agreement with previous intuitive analysis that a reduction in the effective cubic lattice parameter to 82% of the equilibrium lattice parameter @xmath52 ( of @xmath9 phase ) is required to have 5__f _ _ states in the conduction band.@xcite it is clear that the paramagnetic transition is driven by the delocalization of the two pre - localized 5__f _ _ electrons which become itinerant at this volume , and it is quite reasonable that the metallization is always accompanied by a paramagnetic transition for materials analogous to uo@xmath0 where both band gap and local magnetic moment are attributed to the same localized states .    below the metallic transition",
    ", we also find a new iso - structural transition occurring between 80@xmath1130gpa for @xmath10 phase .",

    "drastic variations were observed for all lattice parameters between 75@xmath1121gpa for _ _ u__45 and 80@xmath1130gpa for _ _ u__6 , where the smallest axis @xmath53 has a strong rebound and the middle @xmath54 is collapsed . at higher pressure ,",

    "we do not know the exact reason for this discrepancy at present .",
    "but the experiment observed trend of relative lattice parameters can not hold to high pressures because a stronger repulsive force will present along the shorter axis due to higher compression of electronic states .",
