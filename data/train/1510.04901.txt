    "the inner 500-pc region of the galaxy , known as the central molecular zone ( cmz ) , is rich in dense molecular gas , but the current star formation is unusually inactive .",
    "other than the few star forming regions such as sgr  b2 @xcite , sgr  a complex @xcite , and sgr  c @xcite , most cmz clouds appear to be inactive in star formation ( e.g. , g0.253 + 0.016 ; * ? ? ?",

    "this inactivity is in contrast to the general star formation relation that has been established for the galactic disk clouds as well as external galaxies , which presents a good correlation between the amount of dense molecular gas and the star formation rate .",
    "the overall star formation rate in the cmz is an order of magnitude lower than the prediction of this correlation @xcite .",
    "recent theoretical works by @xcite and @xcite point out that star formation in the cmz could be regulated by the strength of turbulence : the inflowing gas through the galactic bar drives strong turbulence , resulting in episodes of low star formation activity ; when the turbulence finally dissipates , a burst of star formation takes place . such dissipation of the turbulence could be induced by compressive tides during a close passage to the bottom of the gravitational potential near sgr  a * @xcite . in the simulations of @xcite , the massive molecular clouds in the cmz are found to be in several streams of open trajectory centered at sgr  a * with a radius of @xmath3100  pc .",

    "* ) molecular cloud named after its radial velocity , appears to be close to pericenter passage with sgr  a * , therefore could be in the process of turbulence dissipation . in this scenario , we expect to observe increasing dense gas fraction and signs of early star formation in the 20 kms@xmath0 cloud .",
    "previous interferometric observations have found one region @xcite , and several h@xmath1o masers @xcite in this cloud .",
    "however , the maser observations were sensitivity - limited ( usually @xmath430  mjybeam@xmath0 per 0.2  kms@xmath0 channel ) , hence could miss faint sources that trace star formation of lower masses or at early evolutionary stages .",
    "here we use interferometric submillimeter observations to trace dense cores , and interferometric h@xmath1o maser observations with a sensitivity of @xmath35 times higher than previous studies to trace embedded protostars . throughout the paper , we adopt a distance to the galactic center of 8.4  kpc @xcite .",
    "in 2013 , we observed a mosaic of eight positions in the 20 kms@xmath0 cloud with the submillimeter array ( sma ) in its compact and sub - compact configurations at 230  ghz band .",

    "in addition , @xcite serendipitously detected 10 h@xmath1o masers in this cloud while studying oh / ir stars , all of which they concluded to be connected to star formation given the non - detection of oh / ir stars .",
    "one of them is consistent with w5 , while the other 9 are scattered in c4 : one is offset from any masers we detected , 8 are likely consistent with w10 , w11w13 , and w15 .",

    "the n@xmath1h@xmath15 line has a critical density of @xmath410@xmath16  @xmath17 , and is superior for tracing dense gas than the spectral lines in our sma data such as c@xmath18o or h@xmath1co . to derive line widths of the cores , we obtain the sma n@xmath1h@xmath15 32 data ( kauffmann et al .  in prep .",
    ") , then fit gaussians to the mean n@xmath1h@xmath15 spectra of the cores . for the 4 cores without n@xmath1h@xmath15 detections ,",

    "three cores have @xmath20 , including c4-p4 which associates with an h@xmath1o maser .",
    "the masses themselves have large uncertainties : the errors in the core masses are a factor of 1.21.8 , while the virial masses are sensitive to the selection of line widths and the errors are a factor of 1.72 , according to the simulations of @xcite that take errors in all variables of the mass estimates into account .",
    "besides , the magnetic field might be dynamically important on pc scales in the cmz clouds , as suggested by the ordered magnetic vectors in g0.253 + 0.016 @xcite which derive a magnetic flux density of @xmath35  mg from the chandrasekhar - fermi method . within these uncertainties ,",
    "the 12 cores with @xmath19 are gravitationally bound .",
    "h@xmath1o masers in star - forming regions are usually excited in shocked ambient gas @xcite , therefore are used to trace protostellar outflows .",
    "however , they can also be excited in the envelope of evolved stars @xcite or excited by shocks created in large - scale dynamic processes ( e.g. , cloud collisions , * ? ? ?",
    "we need to exclude these scenarios before using the h@xmath1o masers as star formation indicators .",
    "first , we compare the coordinates and velocities of the h@xmath1o masers with the evolved star catalogues in @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite which used oh or sio masers as tracers .",
    "two h@xmath1o masers ( w6 , w18 ) are consistent with evolved stars ( red crosses in ) .",
    "the other 16 h@xmath1o masers do not have known evolved star counterparts .",
    "second , we compare with the class i ch@xmath2oh masers in @xcite , which are collisionally pumped and trace large - scale dynamics .",
    "none of the h@xmath1o masers spatially coincide with the class i ch@xmath2oh masers .",
    "most of the h@xmath1o masers coincide with the dense cores , instead of uniformly scatter like the class i ch@xmath2oh masers .",
    "their velocities are usually offset by @xmath1120  kms@xmath0 from the core velocities , which is easily seen in masers tracing outflows , instead of all showing the same value at the presumable shock interaction velocity .",
    "all these facts suggest that the h@xmath1o masers are unlikely connected to large - scale shocks .",
    "therefore , the 16 h@xmath1o masers without evolved star counterparts , in particular , the 13 masers coincident with the dense cores , are likely associated with outflows .",
    "indeed , we find signatures of outflows associated with these cores traced by sio , so , and hnco lines in the sma images , which we will present in a forthcoming paper . a correlation between luminosities of h@xmath1o masers and protostars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) suggests that the more luminous masers ( @xmath410@xmath21  @xmath22 , see ) may correspond to early b - type stars of @xmath410@xmath23  @xmath22 , while the characteristic luminosity of @xmath310@xmath24  @xmath22 for most masers is usually found in low- or intermediate - mass protostars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the free - free emission from regions is a reliable star formation tracer .",
    "however , only one region has been found in this cloud @xcite , which is verified by our vla 1.3  cm continuum observation ( ) .",
    "assuming an electron temperature of 10@xmath25  k , with a continuum flux of 0.12  jy , its ionizing photon rate is 9@xmath510@xmath26  s@xmath0 @xcite , corresponding to an o9 star of 19  @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "the non - detection of any other regions at a sensitivity of 100  @xmath27jy may suggest no protostars earlier than b1 above @xmath310  @xmath7 , or simply an early evolutionary phase without any visible ionizing sources .",
    "@xcite identified ysos in the cmz using the _",
    "spizter _ 8   and 24   emission , and found three in the vicinity of this cloud , but none of them are within the cloud itself .",
    "the only visible infrared point source within the cloud in the _ spitzer _ mid - infrared images is the region",
    ". therefore , the deeply embedded protostars are not observable in the infrared bands , probably due to the large column density ( @xmath410@xmath28  @xmath29 ) which obscures the embedded sources .",
    "ch@xmath2oh masers have been found in star - forming regions in the galactic disk , and are classified as class i or class ii , depending on whether they are collisionally or radiatively pumped @xcite .",
    "recent class i ch@xmath2oh maser observations toward the cmz @xcite suggested that these masers may not trace star formation , but may have cosmic ray or cloud - scale dynamic origins . on the other hand ,",
    "radiatively pumped class ii ch@xmath2oh masers have been reliable tracers of high - mass star formation @xcite . the methanol multi - beam survey ( mmb , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) did not detect any class ii ( 6.7  ghz ) ch@xmath2oh masers at a sensitivity of 0.17  jy in this cloud .",
    "by contrast , four h@xmath1o masers in our results ( w3 , w5 , w11 , w15 ) are detectable at 3@xmath8 levels with the same sensitivity .      as discussed above , we find 13 h@xmath1o masers associated with the dense cores and probably trace protostellar outflows , and 5 dense cores without h@xmath1o maser detection but gravitationally bound . in total , they may represent 18 protostellar candidates . this number should be a lower limit because the dense cores could harbor multiple protostars .",
    "by contrast , previous observations found @xmath310 h@xmath1o masers most of which are concentrated in c4 , corresponding to 6 protostellar candidates in our sample . in the following",
    "we discuss the implication of our results for the evolutionary phase and star formation activity of the 20 kms@xmath0 cloud .",
    "the evolutionary phases of star formation traced by h@xmath1o masers is under debate ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "recent follow - up studies of the unbiased mmb survey suggest that while not as well - defined as the other masers , h@xmath1o masers in general trace the protostellar phase when outflows emerge @xcite . on the other hand , these studies seem to converge to the conclusion that class ii ch@xmath2oh masers trace a well - defined evolutionary phase ( e.g. , after protostars start to heat ambient gas and before the uc region phase ) .",
    "for the 20 kms@xmath0 cloud , the large population of h@xmath1o masers and the virtually non - detection of class ii ch@xmath2oh masers so far , combining with the non - detection of any prominent uc regions , are likely indicative of two alternative scenarios : an early evolutionary phase when high - mass protostars have not started to heat or ionize the ambient gas , but have developed outflows , similar to the situation in infrared dark clouds ( irdcs ) ; or a cluster of low- or intermediate - mass protostars , whose outflows power the h@xmath1o masers but whose radiation is not enough to create class  ii ch@xmath2oh masers or visible regions .",
    "the former may be preferable because the more luminous masers may trace high - mass protostars ( see section  [ subsec : natureofmaser ] ) .",
    "no matter which scenario it is , the 18 protostellar candidates traced by h@xmath1o masers and gravitationally bound cores suggest more active star formation than that traced by free - free or infrared emission ( one region ) .",
    "sensitive maser and submillimeter observations could be a promising method to trace incipient star formation in other massive clouds in the cmz .    in the orbital models of @xcite , g0.253 +",
    "0.016 is also close to pericenter passage with sgr  a * , but in a different gas stream .",
    "g0.253 + 0.016 has a similar mass as the 20 km s@xmath0 cloud ( @xmath31.3@xmath510@xmath6  @xmath7 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but only has one known h@xmath1o maser @xcite and one gravitationally bound dense core associated with the maser @xcite .",
    "the progression of star formation activity from g0.253 + 0.016 to sgr  b2 supports the tidal compression and triggered collapse model proposed by @xcite .",
    "the 20 kms@xmath0 cloud could be a second case of such triggering .",
    "based on the number of masers and the amount of dense gas contained in cores , the current star formation rate in the 20 kms@xmath0 cloud is likely higher than in g0.253 + 0.016 .",
    "the difference might be due to variations in the local environment in the streams .",
    "we have found 18 protostellar candidates traced by dust emission and h@xmath1o masers in the 20 kms@xmath0 cloud , most of which have been missed by previous infrared or radio continuum studies .",
    "systematic studies of other massive clouds in the cmz , using high resolution , sensitive maser and submillimeter observations , will be helpful to establish their star formation status .",
    "one such example is the sma legacy survey of the cmz ( pis : c.  battersby & e.  keto ) that will cover all regions in the cmz above a column density threshold of 10@xmath28  @xmath29 using the same setups as our sma observations .",
    "a virial analysis shows that among the 17 dense cores traced by dust emission , 12 cores are gravitationally bound .",
    "the 13 h@xmath1o masers associated with the dense cores likely trace protostellar outflows .",
    "the star formation in the 20 kms@xmath0 cloud appears to be in an early evolutionary phase , before significant heating or ionization of ambient gas .",
    "this cloud may follow the tidal compression and triggered collapse model of @xcite and @xcite , similar to the dust ridge clouds . however , its star formation rate is higher than in g0.253 + 0.016 , which likely reflects local differences in initial conditions .",

    "<S> we report the discovery of a population of deeply embedded protostellar candidates in the 20 kms@xmath0 cloud , one of the massive molecular clouds in the central molecular zone ( cmz ) of the milky way , using interferometric submillimeter continuum and h@xmath1o maser observations . </S>",
    "<S> the submillimeter continuum emission shows five 1-pc scale clumps , each of which further fragments into several 0.1-pc scale cores . </S>",
    "<S> we identify 17 dense cores , among which 12 are gravitationally bound . among the 18 h@xmath1o masers detected , </S>",
    "<S> 13 coincide with the cores and probably trace outflows emanating from the protostars . </S>",
    "<S> there are also 5 gravitationally bound dense cores without h@xmath1o maser detection . in total </S>",
    "<S> the 13 masers and 5 cores may represent 18 protostars with spectral types later than b1 or potential growing more massive stars at earlier evolutionary stage , given the non - detection in the centimeter radio continuum . in combination with previous studies of ch@xmath2oh masers , </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that the star formation in this cloud is at an early evolutionary phase , before the presence of any significant ionizing or heating sources . </S>",
    "<S> our findings indicate that star formation in this cloud may be triggered by a tidal compression as it approaches pericenter , similar to the case of g0.253 + 0.016 but with a higher star formation rate , and demonstrate that high angular resolution , high sensitivity maser and submillimeter observations are a promising technique to unveil deeply embedded star formation in the cmz . </S>"
