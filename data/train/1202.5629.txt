    "it is well established that non - hermitian hamiltonians , subject to the constraint of the parity - time ( @xmath0 ) symmetry , i.e. , the equilibrium between spatially separated loss and gain , which are set as mirror images of each other , may give rise to entirely real spectra , provided that the strength of the gain and loss does not exceeds a critical level @xcite .",
    "although , generally speaking , @xmath0-symmetric settings belong to the class of dissipative systems , they can support continuous families of both linear and nonlinear modes , thus resembling the main properties of conservative systems .",
    "in fact , @xmath0-symmetric models lie at the borderline between conservative and truly dissipative dynamical systems .    it is straightforward to implement @xmath0-symmetric complex potentials , @xmath1 , which must be subject to the aforementioned equilibrium condition , @xmath2 , by symmetrically juxtaposing elements accounting for the gain and loss  @xcite .",
    "this possibility was elaborated in a number of theoretical  @xcite-@xcite and experimental  @xcite studies .    in optics , the basic @xmath0-symmetric element can be realized as a pair of linearly coupled waveguides , one with a lossy core and the other one carrying a matched compensating gain  @xcite .",
    "a chain composed of such coupled elements was introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite , assuming that each amplified and dissipative waveguide was linearly linked to an adjacent waveguide of the opposite sign , belonging to the neighboring pair .",
    "another type of such a @xmath0-symmetric system was proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , with the gain- and loss - carrying units coupled to their neighboring counterparts of the same sign [ see fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) below ] . assuming that each unit also carried the conservative cubic nonlinearity , discrete solitons were found in this setting .",
    "the subject of this paper is a system of the general same type ( although without nonlinearity ) , but including a defect in the form of the domain wall ( dw ) , as shown below in fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) .",
    "a natural dynamical problem to consider in such an array , in addition to the dw itself , is the scattering of linear waves on the dw , which is another subject of the present work ( the scattering of linear waves on an isolated @xmath0-symmetric complex , including such specific features as amplification of transmitted and reflected waves and fano resonances , was analyzed in refs .",
    "miroshnichenko and @xcite ) .",
    "below we demonstrate that the scattering of waves on the dw gives rise to nontrivial effects , including the transformations between different branches of the traveling - wave modes and their amplification .",
    "the fact that we consider the scattering of incident waves with real frequencies , and the generation of transmitted and reflected waves which are carried by real frequencies too , implies that we are dealing with the case when the spectrum of the @xmath0-invariant system is purely real , under the condition that the gain - loss coefficient is kept below the critical value [ see eq . ( [ restriction ] ) below ] .",
    "it is relevant to mention that this scattering problem is related to the analysis of transport and scattering processes governed by non - hermitian hamiltonians @xcite . in the general case , such hamiltonians are not subject to the @xmath0-symmetry constraint , therefore the corresponding spectrum is complex .",
    "in particular , the analysis of the generic spectra demonstrates that they contain a few eigenvalues with especially large imaginary parts .",
    "the rapid decay of the corresponding eigenstates may be considered as an analog of superradiance in optics superradiance , and , naturally , it strongly affects dynamical features of such systems .",
    "it remains to understand if @xmath0-symmetric systems may give rise to similar ",
    "superradiant \" states in the respective complex spectrum ( above the transition from the real spectrum ) .",

    "we consider the array of paired waveguides with balanced gain and loss ( @xmath3 ) , i.e. , @xmath0-symmetric couplers , as shown in fig .",
    "the linear - coupling constant for the waveguides in the @xmath0 elements is normalized to be @xmath4 , while the coefficient of the linear coupling between adjacent elements in the array is @xmath5 .",
