    "astronomical optical photometric data are usually calibrated using sets of standard stars whose brightness is known from previous work . the most notable modern optical standard star catalogs are landolt standards ( landolt 1992 ) and stetson standards ( stetson 2000 , 2005 ) .",
    "both are reported on the johnson - kron - cousins system ( landolt 1983 and references therein ) .",
    "the landolt catalog provides magnitudes accurate to 1 - 2% in the @xmath5 bands for @xmath4500 stars in the @xmath6 magnitude range 11.516 .",
    "stetson has extended landolt s work to fainter magnitudes , and provided the community with @xmath41 - 2% accurate magnitudes in the @xmath7 bands for @xmath415,000 stars in the magnitude range @xmath8 .",
    "most stars from both sets are distributed along the celestial equator , which facilitates their use from both hemispheres .",
    "the data obtained by the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; york et al .",
    "2000 ) can be used to extend the work by landolt and stetson to even fainter levels , and to increase the number of standard stars to over a million .",
    "in addition , sdss has designed its own photometric system ( @xmath0 , fukugita et al .",
    "1996 ) which is now in use at many observatories worldwide .",
    "this widespread use of the @xmath0 photometric system motivates the construction of a large standard star catalog with @xmath41% accuracy . as a part of its imaging survey",
    ", sdss has obtained many scans in the so - called stripe 82 region , which is defined by @xmath1 1.266@xmath2 and ra approximately in the range 20h  4h .",
    "these repeated observations can be averaged to produce more accurate photometry than the nominal 2% single - scan accuracy ( ivezi et al .",
    ".    the catalog and methods presented here have some similarity with an effort by padmanabhan et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , who developed a new calibration algorithm that simultaneously solves for the calibration parameters and relative stellar fluxes using overlapping sdss observations ( the so - called _ bercalibration _ method ) .",
    "the algorithm decouples the problem of `` relative '' calibrations ( i.e. producing an internally consistent system ) , from that of `` absolute '' calibrations ( i.e. typing the internal system to a physical flux scale ) : the absolute calibration is reduced to determining a few numbers for the entire survey . here",
    "we also decouple `` relative '' and `` absolute '' calibrations and use overlapping observations .",
    "the main difference between their work and this paper is that they are concerned about calibrating the entire sdss survey ( @xmath48500 deg@xmath9 ; most of the surveyed area has at most two overlapping observations ) , while we concentrate here on a much smaller area ( @xmath4300 deg@xmath9 ) with an average of ten overlapping observations .",
    "we also determine flatfield corrections ( relative to the `` standard '' survey reductions ) using different methods : padmanabhan et al .",
    "minimize errors in relative photometry of multiply observed stars , while we require that the stellar locus remains fixed in multi - dimensional color space .",
    "an advantage of the catalog presented here is better averaging of various photometric errors thanks to a larger number of observations , which comes at the expense of a much smaller cataloged area .",
    "it is encouraging that the results of these two complementary approaches agree in the regions of sky common to both catalogs at the claimed level of accuracy ( @xmath41% ) .",
    "additional motivation for the analysis of repeated scans and their impact on photometric accuracy comes from upcoming large - scale optical surveys such as the dark energy survey ( flaugher et al .",
    "2007 ) , pan - starrs ( kaiser 2002 ) and the large synoptic survey telescope ( tyson 2002 , lsst hereafter ) .",
    "for example , the lsst science requirements document calls for a photometric system that is internally consistent across the sky at the 1% level . the sdss stripe",
    "82 repeated scans can be used to gauge the plausibility of delivering such a system .",
    "we describe the construction and testing of a standard star catalog in  2 , and illustrate its several use cases in  3 .",
    "we discuss our results in  4 .",
    "sdss is using a dedicated 2.5 m telescope ( gunn et al .",
    "2006 ) to provide homogeneous and deep ( @xmath10 ) photometry in five bandpasses ( fukugita et al .  1996 ; gunn et al .",
    "1998 , 2006 ; smith et al .  2002 ; hogg et al . 2002 ) repeatable to 0.02 mag ( root - mean - square scatter , hereafter rms , for sources not limited by photon statistics , ivezi et al .  2003 ) and with a zeropoint uncertainty of @xmath40.02 - 0.03 ( ivezi et al .  2004a ) .",
    "the survey sky coverage of close to @xmath410,000 deg@xmath11 in the northern galactic cap , and @xmath4300 deg@xmath11 in the southern galactic hemisphere , will result in photometric measurements for well over 100 million stars and a similar number of galaxies of sky ; see http://www.sdss.org / dr5/. ] .",
    "astrometric positions are accurate to better than 0.1 arcsec per coordinate ( rms ) for sources with @xmath12 ( pier et al .",
    "2003 ) , and the morphological information from the images allows reliable star - galaxy separation to @xmath13 21.5@xmath14 ( lupton et al .  2002 ,",
    "scranton et al . 2002 ) .",
    "data from the imaging camera ( thirty photometric , twelve astrometric , and two focus ccds , gunn et al .",
    "1998 ) are collected in drift scan mode .",
    "the images that correspond to the same sky location in each of the five photometric bandpasses ( these five images are collected over @xmath45 minutes , with 54 sec for each exposure ) are grouped together for simultaneous processing as a field .",
    "a field is defined as a 36 seconds ( 1361 pixels , or 9 arcmin , see stoughton et al .",
    "2002 ) long and 2048 pixels wide ( 13 arcmin ) stretch of drift - scanning data from a single column of ccds ( sometimes called a scanline , for more details please see stoughton et al .",
    "2002 ; abazajian et al .",
    "2003 , 2004 , 2005 ; adelman - mccarthy et al .",
    "each of the six scanlines ( called together a strip ) is 13 arcmin wide .",
    "the twelve interleaved scanlines ( or two strips ) are called a stripe ( @xmath42.5@xmath2 wide ) .",
    "sdss 2.5 m imaging data are photometrically calibrated using a network of calibration stars obtained in 1520 41.5@xmath1541.5 arcmin@xmath11 transfer fields , called secondary patches .",
    "these patches are positioned throughout the survey area and are calibrated using a primary standard star network of 158 stars distributed around the northern sky ( so - called usno standards , smith et al .",
    "the primary standard star network is tied to an absolute flux system by the single f0 subdwarf star bd+17@xmath24708 , whose absolute fluxes in sdss filters are taken from fukugita et al .",
    "the secondary patches are grouped into sets of four , and are observed by the photometric telescope ( hereafter pt ; tucker et al .",
    "2006 ) in parallel with observations of the primary standards .",
    "a set of four patches spans all 12 scanlines of a survey stripe along the width of the stripe , and the sets are spaced along the length of a stripe at roughly 15 degree intervals , which corresponds to an hour of scanning at the sidereal rate .",
    "sdss 2.5 m magnitudes are reported on the `` natural system '' of the 2.5 m telescope defined by the photon - weighted effective wavelengths of each combination of sdss filter , ccd response , telescope transmission , and atmospheric transmission at a reference airmass of 1.3 as measured at apo .",
    "the magnitudes are referred to as the @xmath0 system ( which differs from the `` primed '' system , @xmath16 , that is defined by the usno standards ) .",
    "the reported magnitudes are corrected for the atmospheric extinction ( using simultaneous observations of standard stars by the pt ) and thus correspond to measurements at the top of the atmosphere ( except for the fact that the atmosphere has an impact on the wavelength dependence of the photometric system response ) .",
    "the magnitudes are reported on the ab system ( oke & gunn 1983 ) defined such that an object with a specific flux of @xmath17=3631 jy has @xmath18 ( i.e. an object with @xmath19=const . has an ab magnitude equal to the johnson @xmath6 magnitude at all wavelengths ) . in summary ,",
    "given a specific flux of an object _ at the top _ of the atmosphere , @xmath20 , the reported sdss 2.5 m magnitude in a given band , @xmath21=(@xmath22 ) , corresponds to ( modulo random and systematic errors , which will be discussed later ) @xmath23 where @xmath24 here , @xmath25 is the normalized system response for the given band , @xmath26 with the overall atmosphere + system throughput , @xmath27 , available from the website given above ( @xmath25 for the sdss system are shown in figure  [ comparebandpasses ] , see also   [ sixsystems ] ) .",
    "we reiterate that the _ normalization _ of reported magnitudes corresponds to a source at the top of the atmosphere , while the throughput @xmath25 includes the transmission of a standard atmosphere at a fiducial airmass of 1.3 .",
    "note also that it is only the _ shape _ of @xmath27 , and not its overall normalization , that needs to be known to compute expected sdss magnitudes of a source with given @xmath20 .",
    "that is , the sdss photometric system is fully _ defined _ by the five _ dimensionless _ functions @xmath25 ( by definition , @xmath28 , see eq .",
    "[ phidef ] ) . in reality , for each @xmath0 band there are six devices in the sdss camera ( gunn et al .",
    "1998 ) whose @xmath29 are slightly different ( see   [ sixsystems ] ) .    the quality of sdss photometry stands out among available large - area optical sky surveys ( ivezi et al .",
    "2003 , 2004a ; sesar et al .",
    "nevertheless , the achieved accuracy is occasionally worse than the nominal 0.02 - 0.03 mag ( root - mean - square scatter for sources not limited by photon statistics ) .",
    "typical causes of substandard photometry include an incorrectly modeled point spread function ( psf ; usually due to fast variations of atmospheric seeing , or lack of a sufficient number of the isolated bright stars needed for modeling the psf ) , unrecognized changes in atmospheric transparency , errors in photometric zeropoint calibration , effects of crowded fields at low galactic latitudes , an undersampled psf in excellent seeing conditions ( @xmath30 arcsec ; the pixel size is 0.4 arcsec ) , incorrect flatfield or bias vectors , scattered light erroneously included in flatfield , etc .",
    "such effects can conspire to increase the photometric errors to levels as high as 0.05 mag ( with a frequency , at that error level , of roughly one field per thousand ) .",
    "however , when multiple scans of the same sky region are available , many of these errors can be minimized by properly averaging photometric measurements .      the sdss photometric pipeline ( _ photo _ , lupton et al . 2002 ) measures several types of magnitudes , including aperture , psf , and model magnitudes . here",
    "we briefly describe each type of magnitude ( for more details see stoughton et al .",
    "2002 , and the sdss website www.sdss.org ) and justify the choice of psf magnitudes for catalog construction .",
    "aperture magnitudes computed by _",
    "photo _ are based on the flux contained within the aperture with a radius of 7.43 arcsec . while an aperture magnitude is the most robust flux estimate at the bright end ( because it is essentially seeing independent ) , these magnitudes do not have good noise properties at the faint end where sky noise dominates ( e.g. for a given maximum photometric error , psf magnitudes reach 11.5 mag fainter than do aperture magnitudes ) . in order to improve the depth of the standard star catalog , we opt not to use aperture magnitudes , except for quality tests at the bright end .",
    "the point spread function ( psf ) flux is computed using the psf as a weighting function . while this flux is optimal for faint point sources ( in particular , it is vastly superior to aperture photometry at the faint end ) , it is also sensitive to inaccurate psf modeling as a function of position and time . even in the absence of atmospheric variations ,",
    "the sdss telescope and camera optics deliver images whose fwhms vary by up to 15% from one side of a ccd to the other ; the worst effects are seen in the chips farthest from the optical axis . moreover , since the atmospheric seeing varies with time , the delivered image quality is a complex two - dimensional function even on the scale of a single frame . without accounting for this spatial variation , the psf photometry would have errors up to 0.10 - 0.15 mag .",
    "the description of the psf is also critical for star - galaxy separation and for unbiased measures of the shapes of nonstellar objects .",
    "the sdss imaging psf is modeled heuristically in each band and each camera column using a karhunen - love ( kl ) transform ( lupton et al .",
    "2002 ) . using stars brighter than roughly 20@xmath31 magnitude",
    ", the psf from a series of five frames is expanded into eigenimages and the first three terms are retained .",
    "the variation of these coefficients is then fit up to a second order polynomial in each chip coordinate .",
    "the failure of this kl expansion , typically due to insufficient number of stars , or exceedingly complex psf , results in occasional problems with psf photometry . the main failure mode is inaccurate determination of aperture corrections which statistically tie psf magnitudes to aperture magnitudes using bright stars .      just as the psf magnitudes are optimal measures of the fluxes of stars , the optimal measure of the flux of a galaxy uses a matched galaxy model .",
    "with this in mind , the photometric pipeline fits two models to the two - dimensional image of each object in each band : a pure devaucouleurs profile and a pure exponential profile .",
    "because the models are convolved with a double - gaussian fit to the psf , the seeing effects are accounted for .",
    "aperture corrections are applied to make these model magnitudes equal the psf magnitudes in the case of an unresolved object .",
    "a comparison between aperture , psf and model magnitudes for unresolved sources is done automatically for every sdss observing run ( _ runqa _ pipeline , ivezi et al .",
    "an analysis of over 200 runs indicate that model magnitudes are more robust than psf magnitudes : psf magnitudes show systematic offsets of 0.05 mag from aperture magnitudes three times more often than do model magnitudes ( roughly once per thousand fields ) , as model fits have more degrees of freedom . on the other hand",
    ", an analysis of repeated scans indicates that estimates of photometric errors by the photometric pipeline are more accurate for psf magnitudes ( agreeing at the 10% level with the measured values , see ivezi et al .",
    "2003 ; scranton et al . 2005 ) than for model magnitudes ( which are smaller than the measured values by typically 30 - 50% ) . because the rejection of likely variable sources , which relies on accurate photometric error estimates , is an important step in the construction of the standard star catalog ( see below ) , we choose to use psf magnitudes to construct the catalog .",
    "using 58 sdss - i runs from stripe 82 ( approximately 20h @xmath32 04h and @xmath1 1.266@xmath2 , but not all runs extend over the entire right ascension range ) obtained in mostly photometric conditions ( as indicated by the pt calibration residuals , infrared cloud camera , and tests performed by the _",
    "pipeline ) , candidate standard stars from each run are selected by requiring    1 .",
    "that objects are classified as star ( based on the difference between model and psf magnitudes ) ; this morphological classification really means unresolved ( point ) sources ( e.g. quasars are also included ) , 2 .   that they have quoted photometric errors in the psf magnitude ( as computed by the photometric pipeline ) smaller than 0.05 mag in at least one band , and 3 .",
    "that the processing flags bright , satur , blended , or edge are not set in any band .",
    "these criteria select unsaturated point sources with sufficiently high signal - to - noise ratio per single observation to approach final photometric errors of 0.02 mag or smaller .    after matching all detections of a single source across runs ( using a 1 arcsec matching radius ) ,",
    "various photometric statistics such as unweighted mean , median , their standard errors , root - mean - square scatter , number of observations , and @xmath33 per degree of freedom , are computed for magnitudes in each band .",
    "we use errors reported by the photometric pipeline to compute @xmath33 and note that systematic errors common to all runs do not contribute to its value .",
    "this initial catalog of multi - epoch observations includes 1.4 million point sources with at least 4 observations in each of the @xmath34 , @xmath3 and @xmath35 bands .",
    "the median number of observations per source and band is 10 , and the total number of photometric measurements is @xmath457 million .",

    "these errors are reliably computed by the photometric pipeline , as indicated by the @xmath33 distributions .",

    "we also limit the right ascension to the range from 20h 34 m to 4h 00 m , which provides a simple areal definition ( together with @xmath11.266@xmath2 ) of a 282 deg@xmath11 large rectangular region , while excluding only a negligible fraction of stars . with the final condition that the standard error for the mean magnitude in the @xmath3 band is smaller than 0.05 mag",

    "as evident from a comparison with figure  [ cmd2 ] , the distribution of variable sources in color - color diagrams is markedly different from that of non - variable sources .",
    "it is especially striking how low - redshift ( @xmath43 ) quasars are easily detected by their variability ( for more details see ivezi et al .",
    "however , it is fairly certain that not all variable sources are recognized as such because of the limited number of repeated observations ( @xmath410 ) .",
    "for example , an eclipsing binary with much shorter eclipse duration than the orbital period could easily escape detection .",

    "the sky density of all the sources and those selected as non - variable are shown in figure  [ racounts ] . at high galactic latitudes ( @xmath44 ) the fraction of candidate standard stars sources",
    "is @xmath480% .",
    "photometric errors computed by the photometric pipeline provide a good estimate of random errors in sdss photometry , as demonstrated by the @xmath33 distributions shown in figure  [ multidata ] .",
    "however , the measurements are also subject to systematic errors such as spatial dependence of the internal zeropoints ( calibration errors ) , and the overall deviations of the internal sdss zeropoints from an ab magnitude scale .",
    "formally , the true ab magnitude of an object ( defined by eq.[abmag ] ) in a given band , @xmath45 , can be expressed as where @xmath46 is the cataloged magnitude , @xmath47 describes the spatial variation of the internal zeropoint error around @xmath48 ( thus the average of @xmath49 over the cataloged area is 0 by construction ) , and @xmath48 is the overall ( spatially independent ) deviation of the internal sdss system from a perfect ab system ( the five values @xmath48 are equal for all the cataloged objects ) . here",
    "we ignore systematic effects , e.g. , device non - linearity and bandpass variations between different camera columns , which depend on individual source properties such as brightness and colors ( but see  [ sixsystems ] below ) .",
    "the spatial variation of the internal zeropoint error can be separated into _ color _ errors , relative to a fiducial band , say @xmath3 , and an overall `` gray '' error ( e.g. unrecognized temporal changes in atmospheric transparency due to gray clouds ) below we discuss methods for estimating both the `` gray '' error @xmath50 and the color errors @xmath51 .",
    "the deviation of the internal sdss system from a perfect ab system , @xmath48 , can also be expressed relative to the fiducial @xmath3 band the motivation for this separation is twofold .",
    "first , @xmath52 can be constrained by considering the colors ( spectral energy distributions ) of objects , independently from the overall flux scale ( this can be done using both external observations and models ) .",

    "the catalog presented here is one realization of such a photometric system .",
    "we now proceed to describe methods for constraining @xmath60 .",
    "the region covered by the sdss stripe 82 is an elongated rectangle with an aspect ratio of 1:50 , and with the long side parallel to the celestial equator . because of this large aspect ratio , and because different effects contribute to the ra and dec dependences of @xmath61 , we assume that it can be expressed as a sum of independent functions of ra or dec , respectively with @xmath62 and @xmath63 , where @xmath64 denotes the average of @xmath65 over direction @xmath66 .    the first term , @xmath67 , is dominated by the errors in the flatfield vectors ( for drift scanning , flatfield corrections are one - dimensional ) .",
    "the flatfield determination for sdss was difficult due to scattered light and there are probably systematic errors in the stellar photometry at the 0.01 mag level in the @xmath42 bands and the 0.02 mag level in the @xmath39 band ( perhaps somewhat larger at the edge of the imaging camera ) , as we will demonstrate below . since these systematic errors do",
    "_ not _ cancel when averaging many observing runs ( because most stars are always observed by the same ccd and fall on roughly the same position within the ccd ) , @xmath67 could be as large as @xmath68 mag on spatial scales much smaller than the chip width of 13 arcmin .",

    "while such variations are uncorrelated for different runs , it is possible that they do not average out fully at the 1% level .      before we describe methods for determining @xmath60",
    ", we address the bandpass differences between the six camera columns .",
    "the bandpasses had been measured for each ccd using a monochromator ( m. doi et al .",
    "2007 , in prep . ) and found not to be identical , as shown in figure  [ comparebandpasses ] .",
    "these differences between the bandpasses induce color term errors in the reported sdss photometry because the magnitudes of calibration stars obtained by the pt are transformed to the 2.5 m system using a single set of color terms . in other words ,",
    "the color difference between a blue star and a red star depends on which camera column the stars fall on : _ at the @xmath41% accuracy level discussed here , there are six sdss @xmath0 systems . _    we used the measured response curves to generate synthetic @xmath0 photometry corresponding to six camera columns ( via eq.[abmag ] ) for 175 stars from the gunn - stryker atlas ( 1983 ) .",
    "the differences between the predicted magnitudes for each camera column and the values generated with the response curves which define the sdss system represent photometric corrections due to bandpass differences",
    ". these corrections may be as large as 0.02 mag for the reddest stars , but fortunately admit simple linear fits as a function of color ( @xmath70 for the @xmath39 band , @xmath71 for @xmath34 and @xmath3 , and @xmath72 for @xmath35 and @xmath40 ) .",
    "the @xmath39 band is the only one where piecewise fits are required ( in the range @xmath731.3 , the @xmath71 color provides a better fit than the @xmath70 color ) .",
    "we have applied these best - fit corrections to all sources in the catalog . the median and rms scatter for the distributions of corrections evaluated for all stars , and for each color and camera column combination ,",
    "are listed in table  1 .",
    "the bandpass differences have the largest impact on the @xmath74 color of red sources .",
    "the color term errors result in a rotation of the stellar locus in the @xmath74 vs. @xmath72 color - color diagram ( see the bottom right panel in figure  [ cmd1 ] ) , and we utilize this fact to demonstrate the improvement in photometry due to applied corrections .",
    "we use the mean position of the stellar locus to `` predict '' the @xmath74 color from the measured @xmath72 color , and compute the difference between predicted and measured @xmath74 colors separately for blue ( 0.1@xmath75 ) and red ( 0.8@xmath761.4 ) stars , and in small bins of declination ( cross - scan direction ) .",
    "the difference of these residuals ( blue vs. red stars ) effectively measures the locus position angle and is not sensitive to photometric zeropoint errors and flatfield errors ( which can only induce locus shifts that have no effect on this test because they cancel out ) .",
    "the top panel in figure  [ izresidtest ] shows the median @xmath74 residuals before applying corrections for different transmission curves , and the bottom panel shows results based on corrected photometry .",
    "the rms scatter decreases from 9 millimag to 3 millimag after applying the corrections .",
    "the remaining deviations of residuals from zero could be due to the fact that we have not corrected for dependence of the flatfields on source color ( measurements of this dependence are not available ) . because this is currently the only available sdss catalog with photometry corrected for bandpass differences , it _",
    "effectively _ represents a practical definition of the sdss photometric system ( i.e. it provides photometry for real sources on the sky ; the system is formally defined by @xmath29 , of course ) .",
    "the non - linearity of the detectors ( as a function of source brightness ) has also been measured _ in situ _ by doi et al . and found to be at most a couple of percent effect over the relevant dynamic range .",
    "these corrections are determined with a sufficient accuracy ( @xmath775 millimag impact on photometry ) and are already implemented in the photometric pipeline ( i.e. before performing photometric calibration ) .",
    "similarly to the camera column - to - column bandpass differences , variations in the wavelength dependence of atmospheric transmissivity can also induce systematic errors that depend on source colors . assuming a standard atmosphere , we find using synthetic photometry for stars from the gunn - stryker atlas that this effect can induce offsets of up to @xmath40.01 mag for the @xmath70 and @xmath71 colors when airmass is varied by 0.3 from its fiducial value of 1.3 . however , because all stripe 82 data are obtained at the same airmass , this effect is not relevant for the catalog discussed here . at least in principle ,",
    "similar , and potentially larger , errors could be induced even at a constant airmass if the wavelength dependence of atmospheric transmissivity is significantly different from the assumed standard atmosphere .",
    "given that such errors would probably average out , and that there are no available measurements of the wavelength dependence of atmospheric transmissivity band extinction coefficient is @xmath420% about the mean value , and the wavelength dependence of the variation appears consistent with the addition of a gray opacity source during summer months .",
    "] for sdss data considered here , we ignore this effect hereafter .",
    "we use two methods based on sdss data to constrain @xmath60 : a direct comparison with the secondary standard star network (  [ ptmethod ] ) and a method based on stellar colors (  [ pcmethod ] ) .",
    "each of these methods has its advantages and disadvantages .",
    "we perform the tests of the final catalog quality using a method based on the photometric redshift relation for galaxies (  [ photoz ] ) , and also compare the sdss photometry to an independent set of standards provided by stetson ( 2000 , 2005 ) in  [ stetson ] .",
    "a determination of the @xmath60 error from a direct comparison with the secondary standard star network ( hereafter pt comparison ) might be considered as the best method _",
    "a priori_. however , it is quite possible that the secondary standard star network itself , off of which this catalog is calibrated , may induce a spatial variation of the photometric zeropoints at the 0.01 mag level ( smith et al .",
    "in addition , there are not enough stars to constrain @xmath67 with sufficient spatial resolution ( say , at least @xmath4100 pixels , or @xmath40.01@xmath2 ) . for example , there are @xmath420,000 secondary standards from stripe 82 in the averaged catalog that are not saturated in the @xmath38 bands in the 2.5 m scans , and have pt errors smaller than 0.03 mag ( @xmath48,000 stars are useable in the @xmath40 band , and only @xmath43,000 in the @xmath39 band ) .",
    "if these stars are binned in the declination direction every 0.01@xmath2 ( 250 90-pixels wide bins ) , @xmath78 in each bin can be constrained to about @xmath40.005 mag ( 0.01 mag in the @xmath39 band ) .",
    "this is barely sufficient in the @xmath38 bands , and can not provide satisfactory constraints on the flatfielding errors in the @xmath39 band ( where unfortunately these errors are the largest ) . similarly , @xmath79 can be constrained in 0.5@xmath2 wide right ascension bins with a similar accuracy , but the secondary standard stars are not uniformly distributed in right ascension . for these reasons ,",
    "we combine the pt comparison with the stellar locus method to determine flatfield corrections .",
    "the stellar distribution in color - color space at high galactic latitudes ( @xmath80 ) is remarkably uniform at the faint flux levels probed by sdss , as discussed in detail by ivezi et al .",
    "( 2004a ) .",
    "systematic photometric errors , other than an overall gray error , manifest themselves as shifts in the position of the stellar locus that can be tracked using the four principal colors ( @xmath81 ) defined by ivezi et al .",
    "( 2004a ) .",
    "these colors are linear combinations of magnitudes , @xmath82 where @xmath83 , and measure the distance from the center of the locus in various two - dimensional projections of the four - dimensional stellar color distributions ( @xmath84 : perpendicular to the blue part of the locus in the @xmath34-@xmath3 vs. @xmath39-@xmath34 plane , @xmath85 : perpendicular to the blue part in the @xmath3-@xmath35 vs. @xmath34-@xmath3 plane , @xmath66 : perpendicular to the red part , with @xmath86 , in the @xmath3-@xmath35 vs. @xmath34-@xmath3 plane , and @xmath87 : perpendicular to the locus in the @xmath35-@xmath40 vs. @xmath3-@xmath35 plane ) .",
    "the matrix of coefficients @xmath88 is listed in table  2 ( for more details see ivezi et al .",
    "of course , the measurements must be corrected for the effects of interstellar dust extinction ; we use maps provided by schlegel , finkbeiner & davis ( 1998 , hereafter sfd98 ) .",
    "the properties of two of these colors ( @xmath84 and @xmath85 ) are illustrated in figure  [ pc4 ] .",
    "the fact that the median principal colors are close to zero shows that the averaging procedure did not induce any shifts in zeropoints compared to the average of 291 sdss runs which were used to define the principal colors ( ivezi et al .",
    "the same conclusion is reached by comparing the averaged photometry with the secondary standard star network : the median photometric residuals at the so - called crossing colors are 4 , 6 , 3 , 2 and 2 millimag in the @xmath0 bands , respectively . yet another test is a direct comparison of averaged photometry with single - epoch photometry . using the sdss data release 5 photometry , we find that the largest median magnitude difference between the two sets is 2 millimag in the @xmath39 band .",
    "it is noteworthy that the widths of the principal color distributions ( i.e. the thickness of the stellar locus ) constructed with averaged photometry are much smaller than when using single - epoch data ( see the bottom four panels in figure  [ pc4 ] ) .",
    "indeed , all four principal color distributions are `` resolved '' using this high quality photometry ( see the fifth column in table  3 ) .",
    "because the intrinsic widths of the principal color distributions are so small , principal colors can be used to efficiently track local calibration problems using a small number of stars , allowing a high spatial resolution .",
    "that is , we require that the locus not move in the multi - dimensional color space . in practice , the deviations of the principal colors from 0 can be inverted , using an appropriate closure relation ( see the next section ) , to yield flatfield corrections ( ivezi et al .",
    "2004a ) . with bins 0.01@xmath2 wide in the declination direction , or 1@xmath2 wide in the right ascension direction ,",
    "the flatfield corrections can be determined with an accuracy of 5 millimag , or better .",
    "the main advantage of the stellar locus method is that it can constrain @xmath89 with high spatial resolution .",
    "however , it is insensitive to gray errors , parametrized by @xmath90 ( e.g. an overall gradient of photometric zeropoints in the declination direction that is the same in all five bands would have no effect on stellar colors ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the pt comparison can constrain @xmath90 , but it does not provide enough spatial resolution to derive flatfield corrections , especially in the @xmath39 and @xmath40 bands .",
    "therefore , we combine these two methods to derive flatfield corrections @xmath67 .",
    "the median differences between the averaged 2.5 m photometry and pt photometry for secondary standard stars in the @xmath38 bands are shown in the top panel in figure  [ ffcorrs ] .",
    "the median differences are computed for 0.01@xmath2 wide bins , and then smoothed by a triangular filter ( @xmath91 is replaced by @xmath92 ) .",
    "the residuals in all three bands display similar behavior and imply about 0.02 peak - to - peak variation between the center and edges on each ccd ( resulting in about 6 millimag rms contribution to the overall errors ) , as well as an overall 0.01 - 0.02 mag tilt .",
    "these systematic errors may be due to imperfect flatfield vectors used to reduce the data , incorrectly determined scattered light correction ( the two are somewhat coupled in the data reduction procedures ) , or problems in pt itself ( such as the pt flatfield ) .    at face value , these residuals could be used to correct the averaged 2.5 m photometry in each band ( @xmath38 ) separately . however",
    ", doing so introduces noise in stellar principal colors of about 5 millimag ( rms ) and suggests that the differences in photometric residuals between the three bands are dominated by pt measurement noise . on the other hand ,",
    "the 2.5 m vs. pt residuals do contain information about `` gray '' errors that _ can not _ be determined using stellar locus .",
    "hence , we take the _",
    "mean _ value of the 2.5 m vs. pt residuals in the @xmath38 bands to represent the @xmath90 flatfield correction , and apply it to the averaged 2.5 m photometry in the @xmath3 band .",
    "the applied @xmath3 band correction is shown in the second panel in figure  [ ffcorrs ] and has an rms scatter of 7 millimag ( for 250 bins ) , with the largest correction less than 0.02 mag .    in the second step ,",
    "we use the stellar locus to derive the @xmath89 corrections in each band ( @xmath93 ) .",
    "the derivation of these corrections is essentially identical to the procedure described by ivezi et al .",
    "( 2004a ) .",
    "also , together with a pt - based @xmath90 correction , this is essentially the same method as used to derive flatfield corrections for the whole sdss survey . in particular",
    ", we used here the same closure relation ( stellar locus method gives four equations for five unknowns ) , that is based on averaged 2.5 m vs. pt residuals in the @xmath38 bands .",
    "the resulting flatfield corrections , @xmath89 , in the @xmath93 bands are shown in the third and fourth panels in figure  [ ffcorrs ] and summarized in table  4 .",
    "due to low stellar counts and the strongest scattered light , the @xmath39 band correction is expected to have the largest noise ( @xmath45 - 10 millimag ) , which is consistent with the observed behavior .",
    "it is thus likely that some of the variation on scales of @xmath40.01@xmath2 is not real . on the other hand",
    ", it could be argued that systematic errors could actually be much larger on even smaller spatial scales , but get averaged out in 90 pixel wide bins .",
    "however , in addition to not having a reason to believe in such high spatial frequency effects ( e.g. the sky background does not show any evidence for them ) , no additional scatter , except the expected statistical noise , is observed when the bin size is decreased by a factor of 4 .",
    "last but not least , it is important to emphasize that these corrections are _ not _ setting photometric zeropoints , but only correcting for variations in response across each ccd .",
    "as discussed above , the ab photometric zeropoints , relative to the fiducial @xmath3 band , _ are effectively set by adopting values for _ @xmath52 .        at least in principle , the same methods used to derive @xmath67 could be used to derive @xmath79 . however , in practice this is not possible for at least two reasons : first , the right ascension distribution of secondary standard stars is not as uniform as their declination distribution , and second , the assumption of the constancy of the stellar locus in color space is invalid along the `` long '' scan direction ( discussed below ) . for these reasons , we only use the pt comparison and stellar locus methods to estimate the level of internal zeropoint variations with ra , and do _ not _ correct the data . in the next section , we will also use another method , based on galaxy colors , as an independent test of catalog integrity .",
    "figure  [ pcsra ] shows the median principal colors in bins of right ascension . as evident , the principal colors are close to zero for the right ascension in the range @xmath94 ra @xmath95 , but outside this range deviate significantly from zero .",
    "this does not necessarily indicate problems with photometric calibration , because the stellar locus method is expected to fail at low galactic latitudes due to several reasons .",
    "first , the mean metallicity of stars increases at low galactic latitudes and this change may affect the @xmath84 and @xmath85 colors .",
    "second , at low latitudes red dwarfs are not behind the entire dust screen measured by the sfd98 maps ( see juri et al .",
    "2006 for a discussion of this point ) , and thus the @xmath66 color will be biased blue ( i.e. the colors of red dwarfs are over - corrected for the ism reddening ) . and third , at low latitudes the dust column increases fast ( see figure  [ p8 ] ) and even small errors in the _ assumed _ wavelength dependence of the dust extinction , or the extinction itself as given by the sfd98 maps , will have noticeable effects on principal colors . for these reasons , it seems plausible that the deviations seen in figure  [ pcsra ] are _ not _ dominated by zeropoint errors .",
    "this conclusion is supported by the direct comparison of the averaged and pt photometry ( figure  [ p8 ] ) .",
    "for example , the largest median photometric residual between the averaged catalog and pt observations in the @xmath39 band is @xmath40.02 mag ( see table  5 ) , which is much smaller than the 0.1 mag discrepancy implied by the stellar locus method .",
    "table  5 shows that the rms scatter of median photometric residuals ( evaluated in 2@xmath2 wide bins in the right ascension direction ) between the averaged catalog and pt observations is @xmath770.01 mag in all five bands .",
    "some of that scatter must come from the pt data itself , and thus the true scatter of photometric zeropoints in the averaged catalog is probably even smaller than that listed in table  5 . in addition , table  5 shows that the averaged catalog and pt measurements are on the same system to within a few millimags ( using the recommended photometric transformations between the two telescopes listed at the sdss website , see section  [ photomcalib ] ) .    we have also compared the catalog presented here to photometric reductions described by padmanabhan et al .",
    "( 2007 ) . as discussed in the introduction , they determined flatfields by minimizing errors in relative photometry of multiply observed stars over the whole survey region . hence , this comparison is an essentially independent test of flatfield corrections derived here despite the fact that both catalogs are based on the same observations .",
    "we bin the photometric differences between the catalogs in 0.01@xmath2 wide dec bins and compute the median residual for each bin and band .",
    "the median value of these medians represent zeropoint offsets in each band and are equal to -7 , 2 , -1 , 2 and 5 millimag in the @xmath0 bands , respectively .",
    "the rms scatter of the median residuals reflects systematic errors due to flatfield errors and we measure 27 , 6 , 5 , 6 , and 8 millimag in the @xmath0 bands , respectively . except in the @xmath39 band , these values indicate that systematic flatfield errors are very small . in the @xmath39 band , padmanabhan et al .",
    "( 2007 ) expect errors of about 0.01 mag , and the distribution width of the @xmath84 color implies about 0.01 mag for the catalog discussed here , predicting about 14 millimag instead of the measured 27 millimag .",
    "it is plausible that the @xmath39 band photometry may contain systematic errors unrecognized by any of the methods discussed here .",
    "the color distribution of galaxies is bimodal ( strateva et al . 2001 , yasuda et al . 2001 , baldry et al . 2003 ) .",
    "red galaxies have an especially tight color - redshift relation ( eisenstein et al .",
    "2001 ) , with an rms of 0.12 mag for the @xmath70 color , 0.05 mag for @xmath71 , and 0.03 mag for the @xmath72 and @xmath74 colors ( using model magnitudes ) .",
    "deviations from the mean relations can thus be used to track local calibration problems . of course , since this is a color - based method , it can only constrain @xmath89 , and , because red galaxies are faint in the @xmath39 band , can not achieve high spatial resolution in this band . nevertheless , it is a useful addition to the stellar locus method because it is independent of the milky way structure and secondary star network ( although it is sensitive to errors in the ism dust extinction correction ) .",
    "we select 19,377 red galaxies with sdss spectra from the redshift range 0.020.36 using an empirical condition and determine their median colors as a function of redshift using 0.01 wide redshift bins .",
    "the residuals from the median color  redshift relation",
    "are then binned by declination to constrain @xmath78 and by right ascension to constrain @xmath96 .",
    "the rms for color residuals and the widths of distributions of residuals normalized by statistical noise ( based on quoted photometric errors ) are listed in table  6 .",
    "the residuals binned in the declination direction are generally small and consistent with statistical noise .",
    "the largest deviations from 0 are seen for the @xmath74 color , with an rms of 9 millimag and maximum deviation of 17 millimag ( see top panel in figure  [ izgal ] ) .",
    "although the rms is fairly small , it is a factor of 2.9 larger than the expected noise .",
    "the shape of the @xmath74 residuals is similar to the @xmath74 residuals for stars discussed in   [ sixsystems ] and shown in the bottom panel in figure  [ izresidtest ] .",
    "the rms scatter for the difference between the stellar and galaxy @xmath74 residuals , shown in the bottom panel in figure  [ izgal ] , is 6 millimag .",
    "since the rms for galaxy residuals is larger ( 9 millimag ) , it is plausible that the same systematic effect dominates the remaining photometric errors for both stars and galaxies .",
    "while it is not clear what the cause of this ( small ) effect is , a plausible explanation is the dependence of flatfields on source color color residuals for galaxies without any flatfield corrections are about twice as large than those shown in the top panel in figure  [ izgal ] . ] .",
    "the results for binning in the right ascension direction are shown in figure  [ p10 ] , where we compare different methods .",
    "the rms for implied color errors ( with 2@xmath2 wide bins ) from galaxies is 0.006 mag for the @xmath72 and @xmath74 colors , 0.012 mag for the @xmath71 color , and 0.018 mag for the @xmath70 color .",
    "the overall behavior of red galaxy color residuals agrees better with the pt method , than with color errors implied by the stellar locus method .",
    "in particular , the large errors outside the @xmath94 ra @xmath95 range implied by the latter method are not consistent with red galaxy color residuals . on the other hand ,",
    "both red galaxy colors and stellar locus seem to show a trend that the colors are _ redder _ around ra=@xmath9710@xmath2 than around ra=40@xmath2 .",
    "the amplitude of this effect varies from about 0.02 mag for the @xmath71 color to about 0.01 mag for the @xmath74 color , while the upper limit on such a slope implied by the pt comparison is @xmath770.01 mag .",
    "it is not clear what the cause of this discrepancy is .",
    "the obvious culprit is the correction for interstellar dust extinction , but the implied deviation is too large to be explained by any plausible errors in the sfd98 maps .",
    "as shown in figure  [ p8 ] , the median extinction in the @xmath3 band for the @xmath98 ra @xmath99 range is below 0.1 mag , and the resulting median correction for , e.g. , the @xmath71 color is below 0.04 mag . hence , to induce a 0.02 mag trend in the @xmath71 color , the sfd value for the @xmath3 band extinction , @xmath100 , would have to be in error by 0.05 mag ( the difference between the values provided for ra=@xmath9710@xmath2 and ra=40@xmath2 )",
    "this implies relative errors for the sfd map in the range from 50% ( if @xmath100 at ra=@xmath9710@xmath2 is underestimated ) to 100% ( if @xmath100 at ra=40@xmath2 is overestimated ) , which seems unlikely ( although not impossible ) .",
    "we conclude that the pt comparison provides a good estimate of the remaining zeropoint errors in the catalog , as listed in table  5 , but caution that we do not understand the above systematic behavior of stellar and galaxy colors , and that only the pt constrains possible gray errors . in the next section ,",
    "we discuss a comparison to an external dataset , that supports this conclusion .",

    "note that the systems are tied to each other to within a few millimags by the transformations listed in table  7 ) .",
    "this scatter is consistent with the claimed accuracy of both catalogs ( the magnitude differences normalized by the implied error bars are well described by gaussians with widths in the range 0.70.8 ) .",
    "this small scatter allows us to test for the spatial variation of zeropoints between the two datasets , despite the relatively small number of stars in common .",

    "the discrepancies are much larger for the three red colors in region 4 . a comparison with the results of internal sdss tests described in  [ internal ] and [ photoz ] suggests that these discrepancies are more likely due to zeropoint offsets in stetson s photometry for this particular region , than to problems with sdss photometry .",

    "due to its high stellar density , the standard star catalog described in this paper can be used for calibration of data obtained in grossly non - photometric conditions .",
    "the typical number of calibration stars in each sdss field ( 9@xmath1513 arcmin@xmath11 ) at high galactic latitudes is 10 - 15 in the @xmath39 band , 40 - 50 in the @xmath38 bands , and 30 - 40 in the @xmath40 band .",
    "based on tests of several non - photometric sdss - ii runs , it was found that the cloud extinction variations can be tracked with a sufficient temporal resolution ( @xmath43 sec ) to obtain photometric zeropoint accuracy comparable to that characteristic for photometric nights ( 1 - 2% in @xmath38 and 2 - 3% in @xmath39 and @xmath40 ; ivezi et al .",

    "in the second step , zeropoints are evaluated for each 2048 pixel wide ( cross - scan direction ) and 100 pixel long ( in - scan direction ) image segment , hereafter called a calibration patch ( not to be confused with secondary star patches discussed in  [ photomcalib ] ) .",
    "that is , a calibration patch is a @xmath49 arcmin@xmath11 large rectangle with an aspect ratio 1:20 , and the zeropoints are evaluated every 2.6 seconds of time ( but note that the variations are smoothed out by the 54 sec long exposure time ) .",
    "the patch is much narrower in the in - scan direction because tests have shown that zeropoint gradients across a field are much larger , by a factor 10 - 50 , in this direction ( see figure  [ zpgrad ] ) .",

    "the top panel in figure  [ dmresid1 ] summarizes the behavior of cloud extinction in the @xmath3 band , as measured by the zeropoint @xmath116 discussed above , for an sdss - ii sn run ( 5646 ) obtained in strongly non - photometric conditions .",
    "although the cloud extinction during the first 90 minutes ( corresponding to 150 sdss fields ) varies between 0 and @xmath46 mag , it is possible to robustly calibrate these data .",
    "figure  [ dmresid2 ] zooms in on a 8 minute stretch of the same data where the cloud extinction varies between 0 and @xmath43 mag , with changes as fast as 0.05 mag s@xmath118 ( almost 2 mag per sdss field ! ) .",
    "as shown in the figure ( middle left panel ) , the residuals have a distribution width of only 0.07 mag .",
    "the middle right panels in figures  [ dmresid1 ] and [ dmresid2 ] demonstrate that most of this scatter is contributed by random photometric errors ( i.e. errors in extracted source counts ) , rather than by calibration errors ( large cloud extinction results in a smaller number of calibration stars , as well as in a lower snr for those calibration stars that are detected ) .",
    "even with such a large and rapidly varying cloud extinction , the zeropoint errors are smaller than 0.05 mag , with a median value of less than 0.02 mag .",
    "an example of a run with somewhat thinner and much more stable cloud cover is shown in figure  [ dmresid2y ] .",
    "the calibration performance in other bands is similar .",
    "for example , although the number of calibration stars is smaller in the @xmath39 band than in the @xmath3 band , the median zeropoint error for the same stretch of data as shown in figure  [ dmresid2y ] is still only 0.01 mag , as illustrated in figure  [ dmresid4 ] .",
    "a summary of the final zeropoint errors as a function of cloud extinction and band for one of the worst runs is shown in the left column in figure  [ errvsext ] . as the figure shows , the data can be calibrated with small zeropoint errors even for such a bad case . typically , the zeropoint errors , for the same cloud extinction , are about twice as small as in this run . a calibration summary for a run with optically thick , but exceptionally smooth , clouds is shown in the right column in figure  [ errvsext ] .",
    "overall , _ for cloud extinction of @xmath124 mag , the zeropoint uncertainty is typically smaller than @xmath125 for 95% of calibration patches , with a median of ( 0.01 - 0.02)@xmath124 . _",
    "we detect no dependence of the calibration residuals on the stellar color or cloud thickness at a few millimag level .",
    "this is consistent with the lack of selective extinction by clouds .",
    "the lack of a color correlation in the @xmath39 and @xmath40 bands implies that the well - known cloud greyness extends beyond visual wavelengths .",
    "another method to quantify selective extinction by clouds is to directly compare zeropoints from different bands .",
    "as shown in figure  [ plotcloudcolor ] , the cloud extinction is similar in all bands for most fields .",
    "a few cases where there are deviations of a few tenths of a magnitude can be easily understood as due to temporal changes in the cloud opacity ( recall that the data from different bands are obtained over @xmath45 minutes of time ) .",
    "the calibration accuracy is determined by the size of the calibration patches .",
    "for example , a smaller patch would suffer less from the spatial variation of cloud extinction , but it would nt have enough stars to beat down the noise of their individual photometric measurements ( @xmath40.02 mag for sufficiently bright stars ) .",
    "the detailed scaling of this accuracy with patch size depends on the cloud spatial structure function .",
    "the geometry of the sdss camera allows us to study the cloud sf on scales exceeding 2@xmath2 .",
    "figure  [ zpbands ] compares zeropoints in different columns for two runs with significantly different cloud behavior .",
    "while zeropoints from different columns generally track each other , there can be differences exceeding a magnitude ( they generally scale with the cloud optical thickness ) .",
    "these differences increase with the distance between the camera columns .",
    "figure  [ cloudsf ] shows a typical behavior : for small spatial scales ( @xmath772@xmath2 ) the sf is roughly a linear function of distance , and it scales roughly linearly with the cloud extinction .",
    "_ at a 1@xmath2 scale , the sf is typically of order 2 - 10% of the cloud extinction_. for example , even for clouds 3 mag thick , the sf at 2 arcmin scales is typically @xmath770.01 mag .",
    "the large synoptic survey telescope ( lsst ) is a proposed imaging survey that will attempt to maximize its observing time by accepting non - photometric conditions . at the same time",
    ", it has adopted exquisite requirements for its photometric accuracy , including 1% accuracy of its internal photometric zeropoint errors across the sky .",
    "our analysis allows us to answer the following question : `` what is the largest cloud extinction that still allows photometric calibration accurate to 1% ? '' .    a similar approach to the calibration of lsst data as presented here ( assuming that a standard star catalog is available , e.g. from prior demonstrably photometric nights ) would benefit from several effects :    1 .   the lsst will not use a drift - scanning technique and",
    "thus the calibration patches can be squares ; for the same area , this results in a @xmath45 times smaller angular scale ( @xmath126 arcmin ) , compared to the 1:20 rectangles we have used to calibrate sdss drift - scanning data . on these angular scales , the cloud structure function is roughly linear and thus the zeropoint error would be @xmath45 times smaller , or of the order 1% or less through clouds as thick as 1 mag ( conservatively assuming that sdss errors would be 0.05@xmath124 , see   [ summcalib ] ) .",
    "we note that the shorter exposure time for lsst ( 30 seconds , or about a factor of two shorter than for sdss ) is not relevant because clouds would typically move by more than a degree during the exposure .",
    "this is more than an order of magnitude larger distance than the size of the calibration patch and thus the structure function analysis remains valid . 2 .",
    "lsst data will be deeper than sdss by about 2 - 3 mag . with a conservative assumption that @xmath127 for faint stars ( 0.6 for euclidean counts ) , the surface density of calibration stars will be about ten times larger for lsst than for sdss .",
    "this larger density enables ten times smaller patches , or about three times smaller angular scale for calibration ( @xmath128 arcmin ) , resulting in another factor of three improvement of accuracy .",
    "3 .   fitting a smooth function for cloud opacity over several calibration patches would result in further improvements .",
    "the first two points predict that _ lsst data could be calibrated with the required 1% accuracy even through 3 mag thick clouds_. given the various extrapolations , we conservatively suggest the range of 1 - 3 mag as the upper limit on the acceptable cloud opacity1 mag may be undesireable for reasons other than calibration accuracy . ] .",
    "the improved accuracy of averaged photometry provides `` crisper '' color - color diagrams and also reveals new morphological features .",
    "an example of such a color - color diagram is shown in figure  [ superlocus ] .",
    "this is a similar plot to figure 1 from smoli et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , except that _ only _ non - variable point sources are shown ( note the absence of quasars ) and averaged photometry is used .",
    "the white dwarf / m dwarf `` bridge '' discussed by smoli et al .",
    "is clearly visible , as well as the locus of probable solar metallicity giants ( this identification is based on models , e.g. kurucz 1979 ) which bifurcates from the main locus at @xmath129 and @xmath130 . note also the well - defined bhb locus ( @xmath131 and @xmath71 from @xmath970.3 to 0.1 ) and the white dwarf locus ( @xmath132 and @xmath71 from @xmath970.3 to @xmath40.0 ) . a new locus - like feature , that is _ not _ visible in figure 1 from smoli et al .",
    ", is discernible at @xmath133 and @xmath134 .",
    "the great value of the accurate @xmath39 band photometry is clearly evident at e.g. @xmath135 : the @xmath70 color distribution is tri - modal !",
    "the bluest branch is consistent with he white dwarfs , and the middle branch with hydrogen white dwarfs , as supported by bergeron et al .",
    "( 1995 ) white dwarf models and detailed analysis of sdss spectra ( eisenstein et al .",
    "the reddest branch is made of blue horizontal branch stars ( see sirko et al . 2004 and references therein ) .",
    "the exciting fact that _ one can distinguish he and h white dwarfs using photometry alone _ is a consequence of the improved photometric accuracy due to averaging many epochs .",
    "figure  [ lsstpreview ] reiterates that point .",
    "note the striking difference between the two bottom panels : while one could be convinced that the he white dwarf sequence is a real feature in the bottom right panel , its existence is clearly evident when using the improved photometry , as shown in the bottom left panel . in summary , _ the multi - epoch observations provide both the identification of variable sources and much more accurate colors for non - variable sources .",
    "_ this bodes well for science deliverables from upcoming large - scale imaging surveys .",
    "for example , lsst will obtain over its 10-year long mission similar repeat imaging as discussed here , but about 2.5 mag deeper , with about 100 or more observations per band and object , and over about two orders of magnitude larger area .",
    "although these new surveys will not have a spectroscopic component like sdss did , the multi - epoch nature of their imaging will provide alternative information - rich datasets .",
    "using repeated sdss measurements , we have constructed a catalog of over a million candidate standard stars .",
    "the catalog is publicly available from the sdss website .",
    "several independent tests suggest that both internal zeropoint errors and random photometric errors for stars brighter than ( 19.5 , 20.5 , 20.5 , 20 , 18.5 ) in @xmath0 , respectively , are at or below 0.01 mag ( about 2 - 3 times better than for an individual sdss scan ) .",
    "this is by far the largest existing catalog with multi - band optical photometry accurate to @xmath41% , and breaks the accuracy barrier discussed by e.g. stubbs & tonry ( 2006 , and references therein ) .",
    "these observations were not obtained for the specific purpose of calibration , but were part of the regular sdss observational program . when compared to , for example , the heroic calibration efforts by landolt , stetson , and others",
    ", it seems justified to call the method presented here  industrial  photometry .",
    "however , the catalog presented here is not without its problems .",
    "the selection of candidate stars was simply based on the absence of variability .",
    "it is fairly certain that not all variable sources are recognized because of the limited number of repeated observations ( @xmath410 ) .",
    "for example , an eclipsing binary with much shorter eclipse duration than the orbital period could easily escape detection .",
    "furthermore , some of these sources may not even be stars .",
    "a cross - correlation with the sdss spectroscopic database yields 99,000 matches in the overlapping region , including 44,000 spectra classified as stars .",
    "about 70 candidate standard stars are actually spectroscopically confirmed quasars ! apparently , a small fraction of quasars ( a few percent , for a detailed analysis see sesar et al .",
    "2007 , in prep . ) can not be detected by variability ( at least not using the number of epochs , their time distribution , and photometric accuracy employed in this work ) .",
    "indeed , we have also found three spectroscopically confirmed sdss quasars among stetson s standards which were observed 20 - 30 times and which showed no variation .",
    "similarly , about 300 candidate standard stars have sdss spectra classified as galaxies .",
    "nevertheless , the inspection of color - color diagrams strongly suggest that the overwhelming majority of the standard stars are found on the stellar locus .",
    "remaining systematic errors are another important concern .",
    "effectively , we have assumed that pt problems average out in many patches when deriving flatfield corrections using stellar colors .",
    "this may not be true at a level not much smaller than 1% , and thus the remaining gray problems at such a level may be present in the catalog . despite these residual problems",
    ", we believe that internal consistency of the catalog ( i.e. when ignoring @xmath48 from eq .",
    "[ photosyserr ] ) is such that the rms width for the function @xmath47 from eq .",
    "[ photosyserr ] evaluated for all stars in the catalog is at most 0.01 mag in the @xmath42 bands and perhaps just slightly larger in the @xmath39 band ( very unlikely exceeding 0.02 mag ) .",
    "in addition to gray problems and overall flatfield errors , the dependence of flatfields on source color is probably the largest remaining systematic error .",
    "we illustrate several use cases for this catalog , including the calibration of highly non - photometric data and robust selection of stars with peculiar colors .",
    "we find that lsst and similar surveys will be able to observe in partially cloudy ( non - photometric ) nights because even cloudy data can be accurately calibrated with a sufficiently dense network of calibration stars .",
    "such a dense network will be self - calibrated by lsst very soon after first light , using an approach developed for sdss data by padmanabhan et al .",
    "given such a network , sdss experience suggests that lsst can maintain its required photometric calibration accuracy of 1% even when observing through 1 - 3 mag thick clouds .",
    "we are thankful to peter stetson for his most useful comments and for providing his latest standard star photometry to us .",

    "<S> the catalog includes 1.01 million non - variable unresolved objects from the equatorial stripe 82 ( @xmath1 1.266@xmath2 ) in the ra range 20h 34 m to 4h 00 m , and with the corresponding @xmath3 band ( approximately johnson v band ) magnitudes in the range 1422 . </S>",
    "<S> the distributions of measurements for individual sources demonstrate that the photometric pipeline correctly estimates random photometric errors , which are below 0.01 mag for stars brighter than ( 19.5 , 20.5 , 20.5 , 20 , 18.5 ) in @xmath0 , respectively ( about twice as good as for individual sdss runs ) . </S>",
    "<S> several independent tests of the internal consistency suggest that the spatial variation of photometric zeropoints is not larger than @xmath40.01 mag ( rms ) . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to being the largest available dataset with optical photometry internally consistent at the @xmath41% level , this catalog provides practical definition of the sdss photometric system . using this catalog , </S>",
    "<S> we show that photometric zeropoints for sdss observing runs can be calibrated within nominal uncertainty of 2% even for data obtained through 1 mag thick clouds , and demonstrate the existence of he and h white dwarf sequences using photometric data alone . </S>",
    "<S> based on the properties of this catalog , we conclude that upcoming large - scale optical surveys such as the large synoptic survey telescope will be capable of delivering robust 1% photometry for billions of sources . </S>"
