    "one of the important results in the search for quantum gravity has been the emergence of the concept of minimum length . after the universal acceptance of the planck length @xmath0 as the lower bound on any physical scale , first introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite , several approaches towards understanding physics at this scale , based either on string theory or other quantum gravity paradigm @xcite , have suggested that there should be a minimum length in nature because heisenberg s uncertainty principle might actually be generalized in such a way that a fundamental uncertainty on position is increased by new momentum - dependent terms .    in the generalized uncertainty principle ( gup )",
    ", one finds that the product of the uncertainty on position @xmath1 and the uncertainty on momentum @xmath2 is a function of the uncertainty @xmath2 ( see , e.g. the recent review @xcite ) .",
    "this implies a nontrivial increase in uncertainty on position with respect to the usual uncertainties of quantum mechanics as one increases the energy of the probe .",
    "the implications of this concept of gup have extensively been investigated in recent literature , especially in the domain of black hole thermodynamics as well as in cosmology . in the former",
    ", it has been shown that the gup is responsible for bringing corrections to the bekenstein - hawking entropy formula @xcite .",
    "the resulting entropy on the horizon acquires logarithmic deviations with respect to the pure area - law .",
    "however , the bekenstein - hawking entropy formula also holds for the apparent horizon of the universe .",
    "hence , it is possible to consider similar modifications to the bekenstein - hawking entropy formula for the apparent horizon of the universe , and this can have application in cosmology .",
    "in fact , in the domain of cosmology @xcite , the authors of ref .  @xcite have also demonstrated that if one applies this corrected entropy formula to the apparent cosmological horizon of the universe , an upper bound on the density of the universe emerges and the big bang singularity dissolves . in addition , and still in the domain of cosmology , the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite have successfully applied the gup to obtain a novel relation between entropy , the apparent horizon and the cosmological holographic principle .",
    "as it happens , though , there are two versions of the gup . in the simplest version of the gup , the product of the uncertainty @xmath1 and the uncertainty @xmath2 acquires a single additional term compared to the usual heisenberg uncertainty principle .",
    "this additional term is quadratic in @xmath2 .",
    "it is this additional term that is responsible for the emergence of the maximum density and for avoiding the big bang singularity  @xcite . in the second version of the gup @xcite , which we call here the modified gup , one finds , in addition to the quadratic term in @xmath2 on the right - hand side of the inequality , another term linear in the uncertainty @xmath2 .",
    "the modified gup is consistent with the existence of minimum length as well as doubly special relativity @xcite .",
    "this makes it also consistent with a large number of approaches to quantum gravity , such as discrete space - time @xcite , spontaneous symmetry breaking of lorentz invariance in string field theory @xcite , ghost condensation @xcite , space - time foam models @xcite , spin - networks in loop quantum gravity @xcite , non - commutative geometry @xcite , and horava - lifshitz gravity @xcite . as modified gup",
    "is consistent with such a large number of theories , it is important to analyze the consequences of modified gup for cosmology by considering its effects on the dynamics of the universe .",
    "the aim of this paper is to investigate and study such effects .",
    "the outline of the present paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec:2 ] , we review the derivation of friedmann equations from the thermodynamics approach . in sec .",
    "[ sec:3 ] , we briefly recall the modified formulation of the gup and then use it to calculate the entropy that might be associated to horizons . in sec .",
    "[ sec:4 ] , we apply the formula thus found for entropy to the case of an apparent horizon of the universe and deduce the friedmann equations as well as the density of the universe using the general formula introduced in sec .",
    "[ sec:2 ] .",
    "we then solve the equations , and analyze and discuss the physical meaning of the solution .",
    "we end this paper with a brief conclusion section .",
    "in this section , we shall briefly review the main steps in the derivation of friedmann equations based on the thermodynamic approach@xcite .",
    "the starting point is the metric of the @xmath3-dimensional friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) universe , which can be written in the form @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the time - dependent positive scale factor and @xmath6 is the line element on the unit two - sphere .",
    "the value of @xmath7 depends on the geometry of the universe ; the value @xmath8 corresponds to a flat universe , @xmath9 is for a closed universe , and @xmath10 is for an open universe .",
    "now , the radius @xmath11 of the apparent horizon corresponding to the metric ( [ metric ] ) is found from the condition @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the areal radius of the two - sphere . on",
    "then obtains , @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the hubble parameter ; the dot standing for a time - derivative . if it is assumed that the matter in the flrw universe forms a perfect fluid with the four - velocity @xmath16 , then the energy - momentum tensor can be written as @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the energy density of the perfect fluid and @xmath19 is its pressure . the conservation equation written in terms of the energy - momentum tensor , @xmath20 ,",
    "can then be used to obtain , @xmath21 on the other hand , the misner - sharp energy , @xmath22 , corresponding to the total matter present within the apparent horizon of the universe , whose apparent volume is @xmath23 , simply reads , @xmath24 .",
    "therefore , when differentiating this expression , we find the infinitesimal change in the total energy of the perfect fluid during an infinitesimal interval of time @xmath25 : @xmath26 to obtain this form , use have been made of the continuity equation ( [ continuity ] ) to express the differential @xmath27 in terms of the infinitesimal time - interval @xmath25 .",
    "next , a work density @xmath28 , to be associated with the perfect fluid , is introduced .",
    "this work density is extracted from the energy - momentum tensor of the perfect fluid by projecting ( [ energy - momentum ] ) onto the normal direction to the apparent horizon , i.e. @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the two - metric on the normal direction .",
    "this work density is found to be @xcite : @xmath31 let us now substituting this work density , together with the total differential ( [ denergy1 ] ) , inside the first law of thermodynamics , @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the change of the total heat associated with the perfect fluid . according to the second principle of thermodynamics for reversible processes , which we assume to apply for the perfect fluid as the universe evolves",
    ", we also have @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the temperature and @xmath36 is the corresponding variation of entropy .",
    "the first law then yields , @xmath37    now , since the radius @xmath38 of the apparent horizon is already given in terms of the hubble parameter @xmath39 via identity ( [ app - radius ] ) , it is clear that in order to arrive at a friedmann - like equation , we need only find the temperature @xmath35 , as well as the entropy @xmath40 , to be associated with the apparent horizon of the universe .",
    "the first thing that comes to mind is of course the hawking temperature associated to black holes event horizons , as well as the bekenstein - hawking entropy of that kind of horizons .",
    "what we have here , however , is not a black hole s event horizon , but a cosmological apparent horizon .",
    "therefore , although it seems natural to apply the formalism of black hole thermodynamics to the whole universe , one still needs a physical justification for such a leap .    by now",
    ", it has been widely argued in the literature ( see , e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite for an earlier one and ref .",
    "@xcite for a more recent one , as well as the references therein ) that it is physically justified to apply the thermodynamics of event horizons to the case of apparent horizons based on the holographic principle @xcite .",
    "indeed , although the hawking temperature was originally found by studying a scalar field using quantum field theory techniques in the near - horizon curved spacetime , the fact that the entropy found for black holes is encoded on their boundary rather than their bulk , has given rise to the idea that physical degrees of freedom are always located on the boundaries .",
    "this holographic behavior of degrees of freedom has subsequently been suggested as a simple alternative for dark energy when it comes to explaining the accelerated expansion of the whole universe @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the mere fact that this idea has allowed to recover friedmann equations is actually another argument in favor of the whole approach . in this paper",
    ", we shall therefore adopt this widely held view and adapt the thermodynamics formalism of black holes event horizons to the apparent cosmological horizon .    before proceeding further",
    ", we would like to stress here the fact that our approach is based on the application of the first law of thermodynamics , as well as the concept of hawking s temperature , to the universe s apparent horizon just as it was done in ref .",
    "the apparent cosmological horizon is chosen over both the event and hubble horizons for the reason that these latter do not always exist , unlike the apparent horizon which exists for all values of @xmath7 and to which the two others reduce in the case of a flat universe ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "indeed , it has already been pointed out in detail in ref .  @xcite that one should be careful and distinguish between apparent and cosmological event horizons when studying the thermodynamics of the universe , as the two categories of horizons coincide generally only for the case of a de sitter space - time .",
    "in addition , it has been shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that the flrw apparent horizon , being defined as the marginally trapped surface with vanishing expansion , is endowed with a hawking - like temperature related to its surface gravity .",
    "this is due to the fact that , whereas for stationary black holes one has a time - like killing vector field from which one can define a conserved energy for a particle moving in the space - time , for the case of an apparent horizon one does not have a time - like killing field but a kodama vector field @xmath42 .",
    "this vector field satisfies @xmath43 and , hence , becomes time - like only inside the apparent horizon where the areal radius satisfies , @xmath44 .",
    "one can then also define a conserved energy for a particle moving inside the apparent horizon and , in analogy to what is done for the case of black holes horizons @xcite , one can compute the tunneling amplitude across the apparent horizon .",
    "the corresponding temperature found is indeed the hawking temperature @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the approach based on the apparent horizon allows one to recover the friedmann equation , as we shall see below , for all three values of @xmath7 .",
    "this stems from the fact that in the application of the holographic principle , the specific spatial geometry of the universe does not matter , as long as spherical symmetry of the boundary holds .",
    "this fact is actually yet another reason to apply black holes thermodynamics to apparent horizons regardless of the value of @xmath7 .",
    "let us therefore adopt the hawking temperature for the apparent horizon by associating to the latter , just as it is usually done for the case of black holes , the temperature @xmath45 , where , this time , @xmath46 is the surface gravity evaluated on the apparent horizon .",
    "one finds @xcite , @xmath47 where @xmath48 , appearing in the first line , is again the two - metric of the @xmath49-space in ( [ metric ] ) .    as for entropy",
    ", one also adopts the bekenstein - hawking area - law and associates to the apparent horizon an entropy @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the area of the horizon whose radius is @xmath38 and @xmath52 is newton s gravitational constant .",
    "therefore , using both ( [ kappa ] ) and this linear area - law for entropy , it is possible to express @xmath53 appearing in the left - hand side of ( [ firsttds ] ) in terms of the hubble parameter and the radius @xmath38 : @xmath54 substituting ( [ tds ] ) into the left - hand side of ( [ firsttds ] ) , after using the fact , as it follows from ( [ app - radius ] ) , that @xmath55 , one easily recovers the dynamical friedmann equation @xcite , @xmath56 then , after using the continuity equation ( [ continuity ] ) , this first - order differential equation can easily be integrated to yield the well - known general friedmann equation for an flrw universe : @xmath57    note that , as already emphasized above , the friedmann equation thus obtained is valid for all three possible values of @xmath7 .",
    "this could nt have been found had we used the event or hubble horizon instead of the apparent horizon .",
    "now , this derivation , as we see from ( [ tds ] ) , critically depended on the use of the linear entropy - area law , @xmath58 , for the apparent horizon .",
    "therefore , any modification of this relation between the entropy of the apparent horizon and its area will modify the friedmann equation for an flrw universe .",
    "let us therefore examine here the consequences of such a modification by assuming the following general form of a modified entropy - area law for the apparent horizon : @xmath59 where @xmath60 is any arbitrary smooth function of the area @xmath61 of the apparent horizon .",
    "taking the differential of both sides of this identity , we find @xmath62 where the prime stands for a derivative with respect to the area @xmath61 .",
    "therefore , instead of identity ( [ tds ] ) , we will have to use the following identity : @xmath63 then , by substituting this in the left - hand side of ( [ firsttds ] ) , we find instead of the dynamical friedmann equation ( [ doth ] ) , the following differential equation : ) in ( [ modifiedtds ] ) is not inconsistent with the fact that here we apply it for the general case of extended theories of gravity that yield a general area - law @xmath60 in ( [ generalentropy ] ) .",
    "indeed , identity ( [ firsttds ] ) does not rely on general relativity to hold but on the general laws of thermodynamics .",
    "in fact , as has been shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , einstein equations themselves are derivable from such laws .",
    "moreover , the main point of ref .",
    "@xcite was to obtain friedmann equations from thermodynamics alone as we saw from the derivation of eq .",
    "( [ doth ] ) . on the other hand , the apparent horizon used in ( [ firsttds ] ) , and extracted from the flrw geometry , does not rely on general relativity either as it is obtained from purely geometric arguments in ( [ app - radius ] ) .",
    "furthermore , one uses flrw geometry as a background spacetime on which one tests one s dynamical equations .",
    "the use of flrw geometry does not require general relativity .",
    "such a background has been used in the literature to reconstruct models of @xmath64-gravity , see e.g. ref .",
    "@xmath65 finally , by expressing the left - hand side in terms of @xmath66 thanks again to the fact that @xmath55 , and using on the right - hand side the continuity equation ( [ continuity ] ) , the above differential equation transforms into , @xmath67 which integrates to yield the modified friedmann equation @xcite : @xmath68 note that this formula is what the general formula , given in ref .",
    "@xcite , reduces to when setting @xmath69 there .",
    "this formula says that for each different area - law of the entropy one happens to associate to the apparent horizon one gets a different modified friedmann equation .",
    "now , as this approach is based on the assumption that black hole thermodynamics might be adapted to the study of the apparent horizon of the universe , it is natural to also assume , in accordance with the holographic principle , that any modification of the areal - law coming from the physics of black holes would imply a similar modification to the area - law that one should use to study the apparent horizon of the universe . in the next two sections",
    ", we will find that the new relation between entropy and the horizon area , as it is derived in the literature from the generalized uncertainty principle applied to the case of black holes , will yield yet another modified friedmann equation for the universe when adapted to the case of the apparent horizon .",
    "the generalized uncertainty principle , or gup for short , that most of the approaches to quantum gravity seem to agree upon ( see , e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) is a generalization of heisenberg s uncertainty principle given by the inequality @xmath70 to an inequality of the form @xmath71 where @xmath72 is a dimensionless numerical factor that depends on the model used to investigate the physics at planck lengths . ] and @xmath0 is the planck length . in the new , or modified , version of the gup ,",
    "one finds , in addition to the quadratic term @xmath73 , a linear term in @xmath2 as follows @xcite : @xmath74.\\ ] ] whereas the factor @xmath72 in the purely quadratic version of the gup is left unspecified , the factor @xmath72 in the version ( [ 1 ] ) above has an upper bound whose exact value is left to be determined experimentally @xcite .",
    "@xmath75 in inequality ( [ 1 ] ) is another dimensionless factor whose value has been fixed to @xmath76 @xcite .",
    "let us now follow , using this modified version of the gup , the usual procedure for extracting the horizon s entropy based on the standard gup @xcite .    by extracting the uncertainty on momentum @xmath2 in terms of the uncertainty on position @xmath1 from the above inequality",
    ", one finds @xmath77 where we have set , for ease of notations , @xmath78 and chose the minus sign outside the second square - root in order to recover heisenberg s uncertainty principle in the limit @xmath79 .",
    "now we shall follow the usual steps that lead to the minimum increase in the event horizon s area @xmath61 @xcite .",

    "a good reference discussing the details of this subtlety can be found in , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite . ] allows one to find the lower bound on energy @xmath80 in terms of the uncertainty on position @xmath1 .",
    "then , multiplying the resulting inequality by @xmath1 on both sides and using that the minimum increase @xmath87 in area of the event horizon is related to the energy @xmath80 and spatial extension @xmath1 of the particle by @xmath88 @xcite , leads to @xmath89.\\ ] ] finally , by using the assumption that entropy always increases , according to information theory and the holographic principle , by a constant unit usually denoted @xmath90 , whenever the horizon area @xmath61 increases by the elementary amount @xmath87 , i.e. @xmath91 , we find the following differential equation for entropy : @xmath92^{-1},\\ ] ] where we have set @xmath93 the factor @xmath94 in ( [ 4 ] ) has been introduced to fix the minimum value of the minimum increase @xmath87 and substituted @xmath1 by @xmath95 . the original argument was made using a quantum particle near the horizon of a black hole , and it was argued that it has a natural ` size ' of the order of the schwarzschild radius @xmath96 , i.e. @xmath97 @xcite . however , the bekenstein - hawking entropy formula also holds for the apparent horizon of the universe .",
    "furthermore , this argument also hold any spherical symmetrical horizon , so it will also hold for the apparent horizon of the universe .",
    "hence , we apply this argument directly to the apparent horizon , and argue that the gup will also modify the entropy - area law of the apparent horizon .",
    "we see that in order to recover the original entropy - area law of the apparent horizon in the limit @xmath98 , we should chose @xmath99 . note that the value found in ref .",
    "@xcite for this ratio is twice the present value .",
    "this is due to the extra factor of @xmath100 present in inequality ( [ 1 ] ) used here compared to inequality ( 4.1 ) used in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the next section",
    ", we will use this new entropy - area law for the apparent horizon to analyze the modification to the friedmann equation .",
    "in this section , we shall examine the implications of the differential equation ( [ 4 ] ) , that gives entropy in terms of the area of the event horizon , on the cosmic density @xmath18 .",
    "for that purpose , we shall use eq .",
    "( [ fr2 ] ) that relates the cosmic density @xmath18 to the area @xmath61 of the universe s apparent horizon .",
    "first , note that the differential equation ( [ 4 ] ) is of the form @xmath101 , where @xmath60 is some function of the area @xmath61 such that its first derivative with respect to the latter is , @xmath102^{-1},\\ ] ] where we have used the previous choice of @xmath99 and the fact that in the natural units used here , @xmath103 . using the thermodynamic approach reviewed in sec .",
    "[ sec:2 ] and based on a different form of @xmath104 than expression ( [ f(a ) ] ) , the authors in ref.@xcite have found a specific friedmann equation . in using the above expression for @xmath104",
    "we will find a different friedmann equation , with different and interesting physical implications .",
    "when substituting expression ( [ f(a ) ] ) inside the general integral in the right - hand side of ( [ fr2 ] ) , we find the following expression of the density @xmath18 in terms of the area @xmath61 : @xmath105+c,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have set @xmath106 the constant of integration @xmath107 in ( [ 7 ] ) can be fixed by noticing , as done in ref .",
    "@xcite , that for @xmath108 we should find a cosmic density @xmath18 dominated by the cosmological constant @xmath109 , i.e. that@xmath110 . with this requirement , ( [ 7 ] ) leads to @xmath111 note that for @xmath112 , identity ( [ 7 ] ) reduces , when using ( [ 9 ] ) , to @xmath113 .",
    "this , after expressing the area @xmath61 in terms of the radius of the apparent horizon , is actually nothing but the friedmann equation with a cosmological constant , @xmath114 .",
    "we shall use identity ( [ 7 ] ) to deduce below the upper bound on the cosmic density . to do so , however , we must first deduce the condition that the area @xmath61 should satisfy in order to make @xmath18 acquire a real value . indeed , given the presence of the half - integer powers of @xmath115 in identity ( [ 7 ] ) , it is clear that the density @xmath18 might come out complex .",
    "so we must demand that @xmath115 be positive or null .",
    "in fact , this condition is also the same that avoids that the horizon s entropy , as constrained by ( [ f(a ) ] ) , comes out complex - valued . indeed , for entropy @xmath40 to be real , the derivative @xmath104 as given by the right - hand side of ( [ f(a ) ] ) should be real too .",
    "this , in turn , simply amounts to demand that the argument of the square root in ( [ f(a ) ] ) be positive or null .",
    "this latter condition is in fact nothing but a requirement that @xmath116 .",
    "therefore , we have the following unique constraint that would make both the entropy @xmath40 and the density @xmath18 of the universe real : @xmath117    given that in an flrw universe whose scale factor is @xmath5 , the area of the apparent horizon @xmath61 is related to the hubble parameter @xmath39 and the gaussian curvature @xmath7 by @xmath118 , substituting this inside identity ( [ 7 ] ) gives the generalized friedmann equation as implied by the modified gup .",
    "more importantly , however , when substituting this value for @xmath61 in inequality ( [ 10 ] ) the latter transforms into @xmath119    note that after substituting the definitions ( [ 5 ] ) of @xmath120 and @xmath121 in this equation , the latter gives for the simple case of a flat universe , @xmath41 , the constraint @xmath122 $ ] .",
    "this is a constraint on the early - times evolution of the universe and , hence , on the inflationary energy scale .",
    "using the estimate @xmath123 for the numerical factor @xmath75 , gives the following maximum value for the inflationary scale : @xmath124 where @xmath125 is the planck mass .",
    "for an upper bound of @xmath126 for @xmath72 @xcite , we recover the minimum value of @xmath127 tev for the the inflationary energy scale .",
    "conversely , since the maximum energy scale for inflation should not be more than @xmath128 gev , the above result constrains the minimum value that @xmath72 could take on to be greater than @xmath129 .",
    "now , eq .  ( [ 11 ] ) also suggests that the hubble parameter can never exceed a given value and , hence , the universe could be prevented from reaching a singularity .",
    "this fact becomes actually even more apparent after computing the maximum density @xmath130 as it follows from ( [ 7 ] ) due to the lower bound imposed on the area @xmath61 by ( [ 10 ] ) .",
    "indeed , notice first that when @xmath61 takes on the minimum value @xmath131 as given by the right - hand side of inequality ( [ 10 ] ) , @xmath115 in identity ( [ 7 ] ) vanishes .",
    "therefore , the latter identity yields @xmath132 where we have chosen the value @xmath133 for the inverse function @xmath134 when its argument equals @xmath135 instead of @xmath136 in order to keep the density @xmath130 positive .",
    "thus , the result ( [ 12 ] ) is the maximum value of the density that the universe is allowed to reach if the modified gup holds . the analysis done in ref .",
    "@xcite concerning the interpretation of the existence of this upper bound for the density of the universe can be repeated here verbatim except for the intriguing presence of the inverse @xmath134 function .",
    "this single difference brings actually non - trivial consequences as it will be apparent from the analysis to which we turn now .    in order to analyze the above",
    "result more rigorously , let us write the dynamical friedmann equation by substituting ( [ f(a ) ] ) inside the general formula ( [ fr1 ] ) .",
    "this gives , @xmath137,\\ ] ] where of course one should substitute @xmath138 for @xmath61 in the above differential equation .",
    "note that for @xmath112 , the content of the square brackets reduces to @xmath100 in this last identity and we recover the usual friedmann equation @xmath139 .",
    "instead of solving exactly this differential equation to obtain @xmath140 , we shall examine , as it was done in ref .",
    "@xcite , the behavior of @xmath141 by plotting the latter vs. @xmath39 . for simplicity",
    ", we shall assume a spatially flat flrw metric by taking @xmath41 .",

    ".,title=\"fig : \" ] +    from this graph , we see that the rate of change of @xmath39 stays negative within the whole range of allowed values for the hubble parameter , i.e. from @xmath146 and all the way to @xmath147 .",
    "starting from the right at the maximum value @xmath146 , the rate of change @xmath141 decreases in absolute value but stays nevertheless negative .",
    "this simply means that the hubble parameter keeps decreasing until it completely vanishes .",
    "the corresponding value then for @xmath141 is @xmath148 .",
    "thus , when the hubble parameter vanishes we find that , because its rate of change is still negative , the hubble flow should change sign and become negative too .",
    "this just means that the universe enters a new phase which is a contracting phase .    next ,",
    "following the curve towards the left , we see that since the velocity is negative and increases in absolute value , the hubble flow keeps becoming more negative faster , i.e. the contraction accelerates , until the maximum allowed density @xmath130 is reached again .",
    "now , at that point of the graph the following issue arises .",
    "the velocity @xmath141 is still negative whereas the hubble parameter is not allowed to decrease further given that it has reached the minimum value , @xmath147 , it is allowed to take on .",
    "the only way to solve this issue and still rely on our equations above is to go back and look closer at the primary cause behind such dynamics for the universe .",
    "in fact , the origin of the negative sign of @xmath141 in the graph came from eq .",
    "( [ fr1 ] ) , for the left - hand side of that equation is negative whereas the factor @xmath104 is strictly positive .",
    "that equation , in turn , was found from the first law @xmath149 , where we used @xmath34 .",
    "examining the variation of entropy @xmath36 in the latter identity closer , however , reveals that if taken as it is without carefully paying attention to the signs , an issue with the second law of thermodynamics arises .",
    "indeed , we clearly see from eq .",
    "( [ ds ] ) that whenever @xmath66 is negative , entropy decreases .",
    "in fact , to be more precise , we actually find that , after substituting @xmath150 in eq .",
    "( [ ds ] ) , the latter is written as , @xmath151 it is therefore clear that whenever both @xmath152 and the content of the parenthesis are of different signs , as it is the case on the second branch of the graph in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , we will have a decreasing entropy with time , which is in contradiction with the second principle of thermodynamics . in order",
    "therefore to remain in accordance with the second principle for all values of @xmath39 , we shall define the variation of entropy for @xmath39 negative as the absolute value of the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ firstds ] ) .",
    "therefore , whenever @xmath39 is negative , as it is the case on the left branch of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , the variation of entropy should be written more correctly as @xmath153    doing so , however , will entail to choose for the second principle of thermodynamics the following sign convention : @xmath154 .",
    "this simply amounts to rely again on the second principle of thermodynamics but taking into account the fact that the universe is in a contracting phase , for as we saw the identity worked perfectly for the expanding universe but for the contracting universe an issue in the dynamics arose .",
    "physically , this could be understood by recalling that during the contracting phase the universe should be gaining heat . to obtain that from a negative @xmath35 but a positive @xmath36 one in fact only needs to write the equality with a different sign convention .",
    "now , when the form ( [ newds ] ) for entropy variation and the present sign choice for @xmath33 are substituted in the first law @xmath149 , the latter reads , @xmath155    notice that this latter form is still consistent with the fact that for negative values of @xmath39 , the rate of change @xmath141 on the second branch of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] comes out negative too .",
    "it is just that the equation is capable of giving us the rate of change only up to a sign , which , in this case , should be deduced from the one it had in the previous phase .",
    "this simple sign ambiguity actually makes all the difference in the resulting dynamics .",
    "indeed , the fact that the dynamical equation ( [ newdoth ] ) contains information on the dynamics of the hubble parameter only up to a sign means that the full dynamics could not be obtained from thermodynamics alone .",
    "this observation allows us in fact to solve the issue we discussed above , concerning the fate of the hubble parameter , when the latter reaches its minimum value @xmath147 .",
    "indeed , we may extrapolate eq .",
    "( [ newdoth ] ) beyond that point just by removing the absolute value symbol there without violating in any case the equation itself . at @xmath156 ,",
    "therefore , we will have the velocity @xmath141 in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] acquire the inverse sign as it sweeps the same values of the hubble parameter towards the right .",
    "the resulting new curve will then be the symmetric , with respect to the @xmath39-axis , of the previous one and appear as another branch in the plot .",
    "the full plot is depicted in the figure below .     after extrapolating the equations beyond the value @xmath156.,title=\"fig : \" ] +    let us now provide the interpretation of the whole graph in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] with its four branches starting from the bottom - right .",
    "the universe starts with an initial maximum density @xmath130 and a positive hubble parameter @xmath146 .",
    "it expands along the first branch while its rate of expansion @xmath39 keeps decreasing until it vanishes at the top of the lower curve .",
    "there , the universe stops from expanding and starts contracting .",
    "the rate of contraction keeps increasing along the second branch as the absolute value @xmath39 keeps increasing too .",
    "the universe then reaches its maximum rate of contraction @xmath147 but not yet its maximum density @xmath130 .",
    "indeed , thanks to the presence of the multivalued inverse sine in identity ( [ 7 ] ) , the values that the density @xmath18 will acquire when the apparent horizon s area @xmath61 starts decreasing , i.e. when the universe starts contracting , might be different from those acquired during the expansion phase when passing over the same absolute values of the hubble parameter @xmath39 . using this fact will actually make the reverse evolution consistent without preventing the density @xmath18 from being a continuous function .",
    "this is possible thanks to the fact that the constant of integration @xmath107 in ( [ 9 ] ) is bound to respect the same choice for the inverse function @xmath134 as the one appearing in the density @xmath18 .",
    "given that one can always make the redefinition @xmath157 for any integer @xmath158 , this implies that the density in ( [ 7 ] ) could be found only up to @xmath159 $ ] but will nevertheless be continuous when it reaches its minimum value @xmath160 for @xmath108 , as long as the constant of integration @xmath107 in ( [ 9 ] ) follows also this redefinition of the @xmath134 appearing there .",
    "thus , when @xmath18 reaches the value @xmath160 , the universe starts contracting but the subsequent evolution of the density will be governed by the following equation , @xmath161+c,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] therefore , the density @xmath18 will indeed not acquire exactly the same values it had previously during the expansion phase when passing again through the same absolute values of @xmath39 since it always acquires smaller values than during the previous phase .    next ,",
    "after reaching the lowest point of the second branch , as we saw , the subsequent dynamical evolution of the hubble rate will be dictated by the third branch in fig .",
    "thus , as the velocity @xmath141 becomes now positive on this branch , the hubble parameter increases from @xmath147 to zero . during this phase , however , the universe keeps contracting , since the hubble flow remains negative during all the phase and the universe has not yet reached its maximum density . the hubble flow remains negative but changes in absolute value .",
    "this means that the contraction will still be taking place , only less quickly .",
    "it is only when the hubble parameter vanishes at the end of the third branch , that the universe stops contracting and the big crunch comes to an end .",
    "since the rate of change @xmath141 at the end of the third branch is still positive , the hubble parameter rises again from zero and starts increasing towards the right .",
    "this is where the bounce happens .",
    "this forms the fourth branch of the graph . during this phase",
    "the universe expands from its much contracted state and slowly increases in size , but that happens faster and faster as time goes by because the hubble parameter keeps increasing too .",
    "when the highest point of the fourth branch in the upper - right is reached , the universe achieves its maximum expansion rate but with a different maximum density @xmath130 , due again to its dependence on the multivalued inverse sine . at that point",
    ", the velocity flips sign again so that the remaining phase will be described by the first branch , starting from the bottom - right , and the process described above will recommence again .",
    "here we would like to emphasize the fact that , although the curve is traversed reversibly from negative to positive values of @xmath39 , it should be kept in mind that this just shows the evolution of the hubble flow .",
    "so at the end of the fourth branch , the size of the universe is still very tiny so that everything looks as if a big bang is taking place again , exhibiting a sudden accelerated expansion , when in fact the expansion started way before ; it just reached its maximum rate there .",
    "now , this looks pretty much like the familiar cyclic universe scenario ( see e.g. @xcite ) , where here the big bang and big crunch happen many times but with different initial and final densities each time .",
    "it is important to keep in mind though that although this conclusion has been reached using the first and second law of thermodynamics , the details of the dynamics , i.e. the origin of the phase transitions responsible for the discontinuity in the rate of change @xmath141 , could only be inferred but not found from thermodynamics alone .",
    "in this paper , we have applied the new version of the generalized uncertainty principle ( gup ) , recently introduced in the literature , to the study of the dynamics of the universe .",
    "in contrast to the standard gup which generalizes heisenberg s uncertainty principle by adding to the right - hand side of the inequality a term quadratic in the uncertainty on momentum @xmath2 , the version of the gup we used in this paper contains one more additional term which is linear in the uncertainty @xmath2 . as such , and given that the standard gup has already been successfully applied in the literature to investigate its consequences for cosmology , it appears of considerable interest to examine what new consequences , if any , such a modification of gup would bring for cosmology and what it could add to our current understanding of the latter .",
    "this analysis was performed using jacobson s approach .",
    "the modified gup deformed the entropy - area relation for the apparent horizon , and this in turn produced correction terms for the friedmann equations .",
    "we were able to obtain , just as it was the case with the standard gup , an upper bound for the density of the universe , using these modified friedmann equations . just as it was found in ref .",
    "@xcite , although with different numerical factors , the maximum density we found here ( as it follows from eqs .",
    "( [ 9 ] ) and ( [ 12 ] ) , after keeping only the leading terms when @xmath112 ) is also of the order of @xmath162 .",
    "this was used as an argument for the absence of any singularity at the big bang .",
    "now it is well - known that the existence of a maximum density for the universe already emerges in loop quantum cosmology within which one finds for @xmath130 a value of the order @xmath163 , where @xmath164 is the planck density @xcite . in our case , the specific value we find from eqs .",
    "( [ 12 ] ) and ( [ 9 ] ) , after keeping only the leading terms , is @xmath165 $ ] . in ref .",
    "@xcite , however , the result was @xmath166 , where the dimensionless parameter @xmath120 was left unspecified there .",
    "this difference might actually be of great importance when one tries to decide between the two versions of the gup to use to study the physics of the early universe , and even for confronting our results with those of loop quantum cosmology to establish the correctness of our approach .",
    "a rigorous analysis of this point will be attempted in a separate work . nevertheless , it is already clear that the present method reproduces the cyclic universe scenario arising both in loop quantum cosmology @xcite and the ekpyrotic scenario @xcite , whereas it is impossible to consistently make it emerge within the purely quadratic version of the gup due to the absence of the multivalued function @xmath134 there @xcite .",
    "where the two approaches , the one based on the standard gup and the present one based on the modified gup , also differ is on the details of the dynamics for the flrw universe .",
    "the rate of change of the hubble parameter implied by the modified gup - based approach is slightly different from what is found when using the standard gup ( compare ( [ 15 ] ) with eq .",
    "( 6.3 ) of ref .",
    "such a difference , albeit very small , could be used as a means to distinguish experimentally between the two versions of the gup , as used in the framework of our approach , since this result is particularly relevant to the early inflationary expansion of the universe .",
    "it is not hard to conduct a similar analysis within other cosmological models",
    ". it would be interesting for example to analyze the effect such a deformation of the friedmann equations could have on bianchi cosmologies .",
    "furthermore , it is expected that this approach will also deform the wheeler - dewitt equation for the universe .",
    "it would therefore also be interesting to investigate the consequences of this approach on the wheeler - dewitt equation .",
    "indeed , any modification of the latter is expected to bring non - trivial modifications to most models of quantum cosmology @xcite .",
    "in fact , it would certainly be very illuminating to analyze first some simple models of quantum cosmology within the framework of the present approach .",
    "finally , we would like to recall here the fact that the modified gup used in this paper is actually consistent with other axes of research investigating the physics of space - time , such as , discrete space - time @xcite , spontaneous symmetry breaking of lorentz invariance in string field theory @xcite , ghost condensation @xcite , space - time foam models @xcite , spin - networks in loop quantum gravity @xcite , non - commutative geometry @xcite , and horava - lifshitz gravity @xcite .",
    "therefore , another way to assess the correctness of the approach developed in this paper is to confront our results found here with similar case studies based on these other axes of research besides those of loop quantum cosmology discussed above .",
    "in addition , since phase - space non - commutativity has been introduced based on the generalized uncertainty principle @xcite , it might also be of interest to adapt our approach to other similar physical situations as a gravitational collapse of a star which has been studied recently in ref .",
    "@xcite or to study cosmic expansion in alternative theories of gravity as done in ref .",
    "@xcite , both based on non - commutativity in phase - space .",
    "any sign of disagreement could then be used either , to rectify the new version of gup adopted here , or to reexamine the whole approach followed here which consists in applying horizon thermodynamics to the universe s apparent horizon .",
