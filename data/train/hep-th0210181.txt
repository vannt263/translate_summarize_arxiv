    "extra dimensions at the tev scale  @xcite have become a popular feature in nowadays model building .",
    "they can provide possible explanations to some of the present problems within the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model ( mssm ) like supersymmetry breaking , the flavour structure , electroweak symmetry breaking , or even unification with gravity .",
    "in particular , one of the most appealing possibilities to break supersymmetry in theories with extra dimensions is the scherk - schwarz ( ss ) mechanism  @xcite , based on non - trivial twists that generate a mass term through compactification  @xcite .",
    "this mechanism appears to be natural in any locally supersymmetric five - dimensional ( 5d ) theory , since it has been proven that the ss mechanism can be seen as a spontaneous breaking of the @xmath2 via some off - shell auxiliary fields  @xcite .",
    "being spontaneous this kind of supersymmetry breaking is quite desirable since it will not generate any quadratic divergences  @xcite .",
    "the most common way of compactifying extra - dimensional theories is by using orbifolds  @xcite which allow for chirality and partial breaking of supersymmetry ; this is needed because theories in extra dimensions are in general non - chiral and have extended supersymmetry .",
    "orbifolds introduce fixed points in the theory , where translational invariance is broken .",
    "therefore terms localized at those points can arise without spoiling the higher dimensional poincare invariance in the bulk .",
    "this type of localized interactions can be used to break supersymmetry dynamically , e.g.  via gaugino condensation , or by any other kind of mechanism that could generate a brane mass term for gravitinos .",
    "the possibility of supersymmetry restoration between the ss mechanism and brane localized supersymmetry breakdown was already proposed in the context of the heterotic horava - witten m - theory  @xcite .",
    "also , this kind of interactions have been studied in the past in the context of generalized ss mechanism  @xcite , since these terms completely change the spectrum and moreover any fermion mass term localized on a brane will generate discontinuities in the wavefunctions .",
    "the aim of this paper is to generalize previous results  @xcite and make a systematic analysis of a very general class of models that could shed light on the mechanism of supersymmetry breaking .    in this paper",
    "we will study a 5d theory compactified on @xmath3 with ss supersymmetry breaking plus the most general fermion mass terms on the brane , which do not necessarily have to respect @xmath2 since the latter is broken by the compactification .",
    "we will perform a fully analytic study of both the cp - even and the cp - odd brane mass terms and find out the cases where there are massless states in the spectrum , corresponding to situations where there is cancellation of supersymmetry breaking between the different sources .",
    "we will also show how the discontinuities of the fields are treated consistently and are independent of any regularization of the brane .",
    "we will perform all explicit calculations for the case of gauginos that are symplectic majorana spinors transforming as doublets with respect to @xmath2 .",
    "our results will be straightforwardly generalized to the case of symplectic majorana 5d gravitinos that also transform as doublets of @xmath2 .",
    "all our analytic results have been numerically checked using regularized @xmath1-functions .",
    "the layout of the paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "we will present the model with both the bulk lagrangian plus possible mass terms localized on the brane that will be classified according to its transformation properties under the four - dimensional cp - invariance .",
    "section 3 will be devoted to the full analysis of the cp - even brane whereas section 4 contains the cp - odd case .",
    "finally our conclusions will be drawn on section 5 .",
    "we will consider a five - dimensional model compactified on the orbifold @xmath0 where @xmath4 transforms the fifth coordinate @xmath5 into @xmath6 .",
    "fermions in five dimensions can be described by a pair of symplectic majorana spinors @xmath7 that transform as a doublet under @xmath2 and such that @xmath8 where @xmath9 are the two - component spinors @xmath10 and @xmath11 . under @xmath4",
    "the transformation law of @xmath12 is @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the intrinsic parity of the spinor @xmath12 , the matrix @xmath15 is acting on @xmath2 indices , @xmath16 and we are using the metric @xmath17 . then for a spinor with intrinsic parity @xmath18 it turns out that @xmath19 is an even and @xmath20 an odd two - component spinor",
    ".    we will find it convenient to define 4d majorana spinors as @xmath21 although obviously they do not transform irreducibly under @xmath2 nor are they covariant under the 5d lorentz group . under @xmath4 parity",
    "@xmath22 is even and @xmath23 odd .",
    "the lagrangian for @xmath12 in the bulk contains @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the covariant derivative with respect to local lorentz and gauge transformations and summation over the @xmath2 indices is always understood .",
    "the kinetic lagrangian is obtained from the 4d covariant derivative @xmath26 as @xmath27 while the kk - mass bulk term comes from the @xmath28 term in @xmath29 as @xmath30 in the off - shell formulation of 5d supergravity  @xcite it was proven that @xmath25 also contains the covariant derivative with respect to local @xmath2 tansformations , @xmath31 , where @xmath32 are auxiliary fields in the minimal supergravity multiplet .",
    "this fact was used in refs .",
    "@xcite to interpret the scherk - schwarz ss breaking of supersymmetry as the background configuration @xmath33  . restoring",
    "the @xmath34-dependence at any stage should be a trivial task . ] .",
    "this gives rise to the ss - lagrangian @xmath35 the bulk lagrangian can then be written as @xmath36 in the brane the different possible @xmath4-even mass terms can be either @xmath37-even or @xmath37-odd .",
    "@xmath37-even mass terms on the brane are provided by the following contributions @xmath38 and @xmath39 or an arbitrary linear combination of ( [ cp1 ] ) and ( [ cp2 ] ) .",
    "we will then consider possible mass terms localized at one of the branes , e.g. @xmath40 , as @xmath41\\ ] ] where @xmath42 is an arbitrary real parameter .",
    "@xmath37-odd mass terms on the brane can be provided by the contributions @xmath43 and @xmath44 or any arbitrary linear combination of ( [ nocp1 ] ) and ( [ nocp2 ] ) .",
    "we can then consider the brane lagrangian @xmath45\\ ] ] where @xmath42 is an arbitrary real parameter .",
    "five - dimensional theories where brane mass terms ( [ cp1 ] ) and ( [ cp2 ] ) , or ( [ nocp1 ] ) and ( [ nocp2 ] ) , appear can be found in the recent literature . on the other hand solving theories where the brane lagrangians ( [ cpeven ] ) and ( [ cpodd ] ) interfere with the scherk - schwarz breaking has been done only for some cases .",
    "in particular the lagrangian ( [ cpeven ] ) for @xmath46  @xcite and the lagrangian ( [ cpodd ] ) for @xmath47  @xcite . in the following sections we will analyze the general cases both for ( [ cpeven ] ) and ( [ cpodd ] )",
