    "it is thus suggestive to consider a phenomenological model for qcd , where the transverse momenta of all constituents are neglected . at a semi - classical level",
    ", one can think of this approximation as a formulation of qcd in a `` tube '' with periodic boundary conditions . by taking the radius of the tube very small , all modes other than @xmath1",
    "have a very high energy and thus freeze out . the model which will be considered in this work",
    "is based on such a classical reduction of the qcd lagrangian to an effective 1 + 1 dimensional theory , which is subsequently quantized .",
    "it should be emphasized that the model thus obtained is not a dimensional reduction at the level of the full quantum theory , which is slightly more subtle . as a consequence",
    ", the model should not be considered a rigorous approximation to full qcd but rather a phenomenological model .",
    "furthermore , it should be noted that even though the model is formulated in 1 + 1 dimensions , one should not consider it a mere toy model but rather a simple ( because all @xmath2 vanish ) phenomenological model for @xmath3 .",
    "while it may be possible to understand many features of high energy scattering experiments in terms of a simplified effective theory , which is reduced to degrees of freedom with vanishing transverse momenta , boost invariance often seems essential for microscopic descriptions of such experiments .",
    "furthermore , high energy scattering experiments typically probe correlations along light - like directions @xcite",
    ". it thus makes sense to employ light - front ( lf ) quantization @xcite when studying dimensionally reduced qcd .",
    "such a model has been considered in ref .",
    "@xcite for glueballs and in ref .",
    "@xcite for mesons , where discrete light - cone quantization ( dlcq ) @xcite has been used as a numerical tool .",
    "however , due to the rather singular behavior of the fermion wave functions , the resulting spectra are not very well converged numerically when the quark masses become small . for form factors , which we would like to consider in this work ,",
    "it is even more important to describe the end - point behavior of the wave functions very accurately .",
    "improvement methods based on dlcq @xcite have so far only been developed for gluons .    in order to develop a model which can be solved semi - analytically",
    ", we will consider a modified version of the model in ref .",
    "@xcite where we assume that the mass term for the effective gluon is very large and thus gluon degrees of freedom can be eliminated perturbatively .",
    "the resulting effective interaction for the quarks resembles t hooft s large-@xmath4 qcd in 1 + 1 dimensions @xcite with an additional helicity dependent gross - neveu interaction @xcite    because the matter degrees of freedom in collinear qcd couple to a 1 + 1 dimensional gauge theory , confinement is an almost trivial feature of the model .",
    "the effective gross - neveu interaction , which arises from eliminating the transverse gluons , provides an induced mass for the quarks and thus leads to spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry .",
    "furthermore , the gross - neveu interaction is also asymptotically free .",
    "thus , even though collinear qcd can not be derived rigorously as an approximation to full qcd , the mere fact that it shares with real qcd the important properties of confinement , chiral symmetry breaking as well as asymptotic freedom makes it worth while to investigate collinear qcd as a phenomenological model .    as a first application of the model , we will study the low lying meson spectrum .",
    "this part of the calculation will also be used to determine the free parameters of the model .",
    "once all terms in the hamiltonian are fixed , we will then proceed to calculate other observables , specifically distribution amplitudes ( i.e. light - cone wave functions ) and form factors .",
    "the basic idea of collinear qcd ( also referred to as the tube model ) is to start from the classical qcd lagrangian and to neglect all dependences on transverse coordinates ( transverse with respect to an arbitrarily chosen , but fixed direction ) , yielding @xmath5\\psi \\nonumber\\\\ & - & \\frac{1}{2}\\mbox{tr } g^{\\mu \\nu}g_{\\mu \\nu } -\\frac{\\lambda^2}{2}{\\vec a}_\\perp^2 , \\label{eq : lager}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have introduced lf coordinates @xmath6 . to keep the calculations simple ,",
    "which will help in identifying the essential physics , only the limit @xmath7 will be considered here .    neglecting modes with @xmath8 breaks invariance under @xmath9 dependent gauge transformations .",
    "therefore a mass for the transverse component of the gauge field has been added , since it is now no longer protected by gauge invariance .",
    "( [ eq : lager ] ) is still invariant under gauge transformations that depend on @xmath10 only and we are thus free to choose the gauge @xmath11 .. , will be neglected throughout this work . ]",
    "neither @xmath12 nor @xmath13 ( where @xmath14 ) are dynamical degrees of freedom , since their lf - time ( @xmath15 ) derivative does not enter the lagrangian ( [ eq : lager ] ) .",
    "this degrees of freedom are eliminated from the lagrangian [ eq .",
    "( [ eq : lager ] ) ] using the corresponding constraint equations ( euler lagrange equations ) before quantizing the theory",
    ".    the dynamical degrees of freedom of the model are @xmath16 and @xmath17 , which are quantized canonically . in summary , what the dimensional reduction yields is a 1 + 1 dimensional gauge theory , coupled to both scalar matter in the adjoint representation ( @xmath17 ) and fermionic matter in the fundamental representation ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "both @xmath17 and @xmath18 have internal helicity degrees of freedom  remnants of the underlying 3 + 1 dimensional theory .",
    "in addition to the coupling of the matter fields to the 1 + 1 dimensional gauge theory , there is also a direct , yukawa - like , coupling between fermions and @xmath17 , which flips the helicity of the fermions .",
    "note that the dimensional reduction procedure , the choice of gauge ( @xmath11 ) as well as the quantization plane ( @xmath19 ) are all manifestly invariant under rotations about the @xmath20-axis . as a result , the @xmath20-component of the total angular momentum is a conserved quantity in the model .",
    "since there is no orbital angular momentum left after the dimensional reduction , this means that the total z - component of the spin , i.e. the sums of z - components of the spins of quarks , plus anti - quarks plus gluons , is conserved .",
    "this feature of the model will be very helpful when it comes to classifying states .",
    "such a model has been studied in ref .",
    "@xcite , where approximate numerical solutions have been obtained using a fock space expansion and dlcq @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , one can also find an explicit expression for the dimensionally reduced lf hamiltonian for qcd , which will not be reproduced here in its full generality , since we will consider only a solvable limiting case of the model in this work .    by allowing the mass term for @xmath17 to become arbitrarily large ( with appropriate rescaling of the coupling constant in order to keep the physics nontrivial ) , it is possible to systematically eliminate @xmath17 , yielding an effective interaction which acts only on the fermion degrees of freedom . for this",
    "we note that , as long as they are not diverging , all interactions of @xmath17 become negligible in this limit .",
    "furthermore , we can neglect all interactions in intermediate states which contain quanta of @xmath17 and are thus highly off - shell .",
    "this makes it an easy task to eliminate @xmath17 using a lf tamm dancoff procedure .",
    "first this gives rise to a kinetic mass counter - term for the fermions .",
    "as is explained in the appendix , the tamm - dancoff procedure also requires to renormalize the one gluon vertex . after eliminating all gluon dressing from the quark lines ,",
    "we are thus left with a fermion field that has a mass term @xmath21 . , choosing them equal gives rise to a consistent solution . ]    in order to determine the effective @xmath22 interaction arising from eliminating @xmath17 , let us consider @xmath22 scattering ( fig .",

    "1.cm    ( 15,6)(1,1 )    since the quark helicity flips at the quark gluon vertices and since total ( quark+gluon ) helicity is conserved at each vertex , the one gluon exchange interaction vanishes identically for helicity @xmath23 mesons , i.e. when quark and antiquark have the same helicity .",
    "thus , as our first result , we find that mesons with helicity @xmath23 are in our model described by t hooft s equation only @xmath24 the only role played by the transverse gluons for these mesons is to give the quarks a `` constituent mass '' @xmath21 .",
    "the situation is different for mesons with helicity zero , i.e. when quark and antiquark have opposite helicity , in which case the one gluon exchange matrix element is nonzero and reads for the time ordering depicted in fig .",

    "( [ eq : voge ] ) have been separated .",
    "let us first consider the `` pion '' channel , i.e. mesons with helicity zero , an odd spin wave function and an even orbital wave function for the quarks . in this channel ,",
    "the effective interaction reads @xmath30   \\label{eq : voge2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath31 the first interaction term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : voge2 ] ) is the same as what one gets in the chiral gross - neveu model , i.e. an attractive s - channel @xmath32 interaction , where @xmath33 are color indices .",
    "such an interaction leads to a divergence when it is iterated and one has to introduce a cutoff . from studies of the gross - neveu model @xcite",
    ", it is known that the the coupling @xmath34 goes to zero as the cutoff is sent to infinity ( asymptotic freedom ! ) .",
    "the other two terms in eq .",
    "( [ eq : voge2 ] ) are what one gets if one introduces an s - channel vector interaction of the form @xmath35 in @xmath36 dimensions .",
    "such an interaction does not lead to divergences ( in covariant perturbation theory )  neither when iterated with itself nor in conjunction with the @xmath37 or gross - neveu interactions .",
    "thus as the running coupling goes to zero , this s - channel vector interaction becomes less and less important , until it disappears when the cutoff goes to infinity . in the effective interaction",
    ", one can thus omit this term entirely , yielding @xmath38 in the scalar channel ( total helicity zero , spin part odd , orbital part odd ) one finds the same result as for the chiral gross - neveu model in the scalar channel @xmath39 and also the relative sign and strength between the @xmath40 and @xmath41 channel are consistent with the chiral gross - neveu model .",
    "in addition to this contact interaction from eliminating the transverse gluon field , the mesons are also governed by the @xmath37 interactions .",
    "thus , after all the dust has settled , we are left with an effective two dimensional field theory , describing mesons both in the @xmath40 and @xmath41 channels , which in covariant notation reads @xmath42 , \\label{eq : hgn0}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath43 is a two - spinor with @xmath44 color components ( fundamental representation ) , @xmath45 $ ] is the gauge field and the limit @xmath46 is implied .",
    "obviously , for @xmath47 one obtains the t hooft model ( @xmath37 in the limit @xmath46 ) @xcite ,    finally , let us turn to mesons with zero total helicity , but even helicity wave functions .",
    "by the same reasoning as above , one obtains the same interaction as in the @xmath48 channels , but with the sign reversed ( because the interaction is a spin exchange interaction ) , i.e. they act repulsively . in non - perturbative calculations",
    ", there is a crucial difference between renormalized zero - range interactions that are attractive and those that are repulsive !",
    "this fact is best illustrated in the context of a simple example , the non - relativistic schrdinger equation in two spatial dimensions with a delta function interaction .",
    "since a delta function in two dimensions leads to a logarithmic divergence , one needs to introduce a cutoff .",
    "suppose now that the delta function is attractive .",
    "then , in order to keep a finite mass of the bound state , the coupling constant must go to zero as the cutoff goes to infinity  otherwise the wave - function gets sucked into the singularity .",
    "now suppose one calculates the effect of a repulsive interaction with the same strength but opposite ( repulsive ) sign .",
    "in this case , there is no enhancement of the interaction due to being sucked in and as a consequence the repulsive effects of the interaction completely disappear as the cutoff is sent to infinity .",
    "the same happens here with the spin - even helicity zero interaction .",
    "because of the symmetries of the underlying action , the coupling constant is the same as in the attractive case ( @xmath48 channel ) but of opposite ( repulsive ) sign .",
    "since non - perturbative renormalization for the @xmath48 channel ( as done in appendix [ sec : hgn ] ) yields a vanishing bare coupling , and since the same bare coupling acts in the repulsive case , one finds that the effective interaction from one gluon exchange in the repulsive channels completely disappears .",
    "the spin - even helicity 0 mesons are thus described by t hooft s equation ( without gross - neveu interaction ) .",
    "this is a very interesting result , since it implies that the spin - even helicity 0 mesons are described by the same bound - state equation as the helicity @xmath23 mesons , and they thus form degenerate triplets  just as one would expect from vector and axial vector mesons !    in summary , after separating the spin part of the effective interaction induced by the transverse gluons , one finds that scalar and pseudo - scalar mesons are described by the t hooft  gross  neveu interaction [ eq .",
    "( [ eq : hgn0 ] ) ] , while vector and axial vector mesons are described by t hooft s equation [ eq . ( [ eq : hgn0 ] ) , but with @xmath47 ] .",
    "this is one of the principal results of this paper .",
    "quantum numbers are associated with these states by considering vacuum to meson matrix elements of operators with definite quantum numbers ( such as @xmath50 and @xmath51 ) .",
    "the resulting quantum numbers are consistent with the quantum numbers that one can intuitively guess by merely considering the degeneracy of states and their naive quark model parity properties .",
    "using these rules , one obtains the assignments of quantum numbers shown in table i. of course , while the above assignment of quantum numbers may appear reasonable , it is still to some extent arbitrary , since the model has no rotational symmetry .",
    "one should always keep this fact in mind when comparing the model results to the experimentally measured meson spectra .",
    "note that , in the limit of infinite mass for the @xmath52 field considered here , the model supports only states with helicity up to @xmath53 .",
    "tensor and higher spin mesons are absent in this limit of the model .",
    "[ tab : jp ]    .assignment of @xmath54 quantum numbers to the states of the model .",
    "one of the remarkable results of this model is that , despite the rotationally non - invariant formulation , states with @xmath55 and those with @xmath56 are exactly degenerate ( this is true for both vector and axial vector mesons ) . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the light - cone wave functions for mesons containing strange quarks are quite similar to wave functions of non - strange mesons and there is thus no reason to display them here .",
    "the only difference is that the wave - functions are no longer symmetric under @xmath57 , but they are slightly shifted such that the @xmath58 quark tends to carry more momentum than the light quark , as one would naively expect .    with the high quality electron beam now available at jefferson laboratory , there will be attempts to measure the electro - magnetic form factor of the @xmath59-meson over a wide momentum range @xcite .    in order to calculate this observable from our collinear qcd model we concentrate on fit 2 ( gross - neveu coupling adjusted ) , since it is crucial to have both the correct @xmath59-meson mass as well as the @xmath60-meson mass in order to obtain a reasonable model for the kaon form factor",
    ". application of above formulas for the form factor is tedious but straightforward and the result of such a calculation is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : formk ] .",
    "1.cm    ( 15,7)(1.2,-9.5 )    a comparison with fig .",
    "[ fig : formpi ] shows that the form factors of @xmath40 and @xmath59 mesons are rather similar . at first , this seems surprising , but the physics of this result becomes clear when one decomposes the form factor of the @xmath61 into the contributions from the @xmath62 and the @xmath63 quark .",
    "the various form factors now find a simple interpretations in a quark model : clearly , the @xmath62 form factor falls off faster than the @xmath58 form factor , since the heavier @xmath58 quark is more localized than the @xmath62 quark .",
    "furthermore , when comparing the @xmath62 form factor in a @xmath59 with the @xmath62 form factor in a @xmath40 we find that the @xmath62 quark is more localized in the @xmath40 than in the @xmath59 .",
    "there are two reasons for this trend .",
    "first of all , the gross - neveu coupling is weaker in the @xmath59 and thus there is a little less attraction in the @xmath59 compared to the @xmath40 ( this compensates perhaps for the increased reduced mass ) .",
    "furthermore , while the mean separation between quark and anti - quark changes perhaps only little when going from the @xmath40 to the @xmath59 , the center of mass gets shifted towards the @xmath58 quark , which means that the @xmath62 quark gets `` pushed out '' a little .",
    "the combination of a slightly faster ( compared to the @xmath40 ) falloff of the @xmath62 form factor and the slower falloff of the strange form factor ( compared to the @xmath64 in the @xmath40 ) then results in a net electro - magnetic form factor for the @xmath59 meson which is very similar to the @xmath40 form factor .",
    "for the rms radii one finds @xmath65 and @xmath66 resulting in a net ( electro - magnetic ) rms radius of @xmath67 ( experiment : @xmath68 @xcite ) , which is almost identical to the rms radius of the @xmath40 @xmath69 in this model .",
    "for the neutral @xmath70 , the model predicts @xmath71 , which is consistent with the experimental result @xmath72 @xcite .",
    "while numerical model results are consistent with available experimental data @xcite , the error bars of the latter are large and more precise data , over a larger momentum range , would be very useful @xcite .",
    "we have considered the collinear model for qcd where all modes with nonzero transverse momentum ( relative to an arbitrary , but fixed , direction ) are neglected .",
    "such a model has not been derived from qcd , and should thus be regarded as a purely phenomenological model . within this model , we focussed on the limit where the effective mass of the transverse gluon becomes very large , but with an appropriately rescaled coupling to the quarks . as a result ,",
    "one obtains a model that resembles the t hooft model but with helicity degrees of freedom for the quarks and point - like helicity - dependent quark - antiquark interactions that resemble the chiral gross - neveu model .",
    "this limiting case of collinear qcd is solvable for large @xmath73 .",
    "given the ad - hoc truncation of the degrees of freedom , one would be tempted to dismiss such a model as not being a very useful model for @xmath3 . however , as the physical observables presented in this paper indicate , the model yields a remarkably good description for many experimental data .",
    "first of all , the spectrum of vector and axial - vector mesons turns out to be rotational invariant ( i.e. helicity independent ! ) .    secondly , with only three free parameters available [ which are fixed to reproduce the @xmath40 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 masses ] one obtains an extraordinarily good result for the masses of other non - strange mesons .",
    "one of the most surprising result in the calculations of the spectrum was the excellent agreement with the mass of the @xmath76 , which is often difficult in quark models and which is believed to possess a large @xmath77 component ( which is not there at large @xmath73 ) .",
    "we have no explanation for this surprisingly good agreement of the model results with the experimental data .",
    "this agreement might be accidental and it does also depend on which physical mesons are identified with meson states within the model . since the model lacks transverse momenta , the model contains of course much less states than for example the quark model and therefore one must pick a subset of states with which the model states are identified .",
    "while the choice made in the paper seemed by far the most reasonable , there is some uncertainty in the assignment of quantum numbers since the model lacks full rotational invariance .",
    "the spectra of mesons containing strange quarks , were less well reproduced .",
    "if one uses the same coupling in the strange and non - strange sectors , then it turns out to be impossible to fit the @xmath59 and @xmath78 masses at the same time . while the fit improves considerably , when one allows the gross - neveu coupling for strange quarks to differ from the coupling for light quarks , the overall fit for mesons with strange quarks never reaches the quality of the fit for non - strange mesons .",
    "specifically , the @xmath79 meson is not very well reproduced , which might be a hint that the agreement in the non - strange sector is to some extent accidental .    motivated by the success of the meson spectrum calculations , we considered other observables as well .",
    "an observable which is particularly easily accessible in the lf framework are the lf wave functions of hadrons .",
    "the wave function for the @xmath40 turned out to be almost completely flat [ @xmath80 in the chiral limit ] . in contrast , the wave function of the @xmath74 turned out to be strongly peaked in the middle , which is more reminiscent of a weakly bound state . physically , this difference did arise because the model has an attractive zero - range interaction which acts only in the @xmath40 channel .",
    "a similar picture arises when one considers the lf wave functions for the @xmath81 and @xmath82 mesons .",
    "both wave functions have nodes in the middle , which reflects the parity of these mesons , but only the wave function for the @xmath81 is non - vanishing at the boundary .",
    "one feature which makes this model particularly useful for form factor calculations is that it is fully covariant under boosts in the longitudinal direction , which makes the extraction of form - factors frame independent . despite the differences in their lf wave functions , the @xmath74 and @xmath40 meson turn out to have almost the same rms radius ( i.e. slope of the vector form factor .",
    "the main reason for this result is vector meson dominance for the vector form factor at small momentum transfers , which is also a feature of collinear qcd . at large momentum transfers",
    ", the @xmath74 form factor falls off much faster than the @xmath40 form factor .",
    "roughly speaking , a flat lf wave function corresponds to an equal time wave function which has a very large high momentum component ( the end points of the lf wave function correspond to infinite momenta for the constituents in an equal time framework ) thus resulting in less wave function suppression for the large momentum transfer form factor .    in order to obtain a reasonable fit for the spectrum of mesons containing strange quarks",
    ", it turns out to be necessary to re - fit the gross - neveu coupling . after having done",
    "this one obtains an electro - magnetic form factor for the @xmath59 meson , which is very similar to the form factor of the @xmath40 .",
    "this result is `` explained '' by @xmath58 form factor which falls of slower and a @xmath62 form factor that falls of faster than @xmath83 and @xmath62 form factors in the @xmath40 so that the net difference between @xmath59 and @xmath40 nearly vanishes .",

    "here we will use a trick to arrive at a renormalized bound state equation : the operator identity @xmath105 where @xmath106 is the current quark mass , together with lorentz covariance , implies for vacuum to meson ( on shell ) matrix elements @xmath107 i.e. in terms of the wave - function @xmath108 the reason @xmath21 and not @xmath106 appears in the lf expression for @xmath109 is again the tamm - dancoff expansion used .",
    "we can use this identity to express the divergent integral in eq .",
    "( [ eq : gnlf1 ] ) by a convergent integral , yielding the renormalized ( but non - hermitian , since the hamiltonian depends on the eigenvalue ) bound state equation for the pion channel @xmath110 this `` miracle '' is possible since the current quark mass itself is cutoff dependent and goes to zero ( for fixed physical masses ) as the cutoff is sent to infinity . in fact , it goes to zero in such a way that the ratio @xmath111 stays finite , which motivates the definition @xmath112 a consistency check of this result is obtained by explicitly solving the renormalized integral equation . from eq .",
    "( [ eq : gnlf2 ] ) one finds @xmath113 consistency requires that @xmath114 which we recognize as the pole condition for @xmath98 [ eq .",
    "( [ eq : ps2point2 ] ) ] with @xmath115 replaced by @xmath116 .",
    "let us now proceed to the full t hooft  gross -neveu model ( [ eq : hgn ] ) .",
    "a calculation analogous to the covariant procedure discussed above can again be obtained by summing up a chain of pseudo - scalar bubbles , but now each bubbles is dressed by the @xmath37 interactions as well as by the gross  neveu ( tadpole ) self - energy .",
    "interactions only changes the self - mass by a finite amount . since the induced mass is only a bare parameter anyway , this additional renormalization of a parameter that is already renormalized has no further consequences . ]        in practice , these bubbles can be evaluated by inserting a complete set of ( t hooft- ) meson states @xmath117 where the @xmath118 and @xmath119 are the masses and pseudo - scalar couplings of the n - th meson solution for the t hooft equation .",
    "the masses are most conveniently calculated in terms of the lf wave - functions @xmath120 the sum in eq .",
    "( [ eq : hgn1 ] ) diverges , but since @xmath37 is superrenormalizable , this is only the free field divergence .",
    "we renormalize again by performing a zero momentum subtraction , yielding @xmath121 where @xmath122 is finite . for the scalar channel we are _ not _ free to renormalize independently , since chiral symmetry demands that the scalar and pseudo - scalar couplings are the same .",
    "this yields @xmath123 where @xmath124 are the scalar couplings and @xmath125 accounts for the ( finite ) differences in the zero momentum subtraction in the scalar and pseudo - scalar channels . for practical calculations , the following representation is also useful @xmath126 eqs .",
    "( [ eq : hgn2 ] ) and ( [ eq : hgn4 ] ) or ( [ eq : hgn4b ] ) are perfectly suitable for a numerical determination of the spectrum of the t hooft  gross  neveu model . however , since we want to determine lf wave - functions and parton distribution functions , we also need to understand how to renormalize the lf wave equation for this model .",
    "the canonical procedure ( modulo renormalization of both kinetic and vertex masses as explained above ) yields the ( still ill defined ) lf bound state equation for this model @xmath127 in the pseudo - scalar channel , we can use the same procedure that we introduced in connection with the gross  neveu model , namely replacing the pseudo - scalar coupling by the vector coupling , which yields the renormalized lf bound state equation for the hooft  gross  neveu model in the pseudo - scalar channel ( i.e. only even wave functions ) @xmath128 it is quite easy to verify consistency of the renormalized lf equation ( [ eq : hgnlf2 ] ) with the more conventionally obtained result ( [ eq : hgn2 ] ) . using the green s function for the t hooft equation , @xmath129 one can rewrite eq .",
    "( [ eq : hgnlf2 ] ) in the form @xmath130 upon integrating over @xmath131 and using the fact that the solutions to t hooft s equation satisfy @xmath132 we recover eq .",
    "( [ eq : hgn2 ] )  provided we identify @xmath116 with @xmath115 .    for scalar mesons , we have not been able to derive a renormalized lf bound state equation .",
    "however , this does not prevent us from calculating the lf wave functions of scalar resonances , using the following trick : from eq .",
    "( [ eq : hgnlf1 ] ) one notes that the wave functions for scalar states satisfy @xmath133 where @xmath134 is the invariant mass of the bound state . thus one can first obtain the bound state mass from the poles of @xmath135 [ i.e. from eq .",
    "( [ eq : hgn4b ] ) ] and then one determines @xmath136 ( up to a normalization factor ) by solving the linear equation corresponding to eq .",
    "( [ eq : trick ] ) , i.e. one solves @xmath137 for @xmath138 , where @xmath139 is the  t hooft hamiltonian .",
