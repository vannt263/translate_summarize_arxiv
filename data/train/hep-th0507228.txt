    "there are strong indications that a black hole ( bh ) of mass @xmath1 and horizon area @xmath2 possesses entropy and temperature , given respectively by @xcite : s_bh = , t_h = , ( _ pl = planck  length ) .",
    "the above entropy and temperature satisfy the laws of _ bh thermodynamics _ t_h=  ,   d(mc^2 ) = t_h ds_bh +  ,   ( s_bh + s_matter ) 0 where ` work terms ' are relevant for bhs with charge(s ) and angular momenta , and @xmath3 refers to the entropy of matter outside the bh .",
    "usually the latter can be given a microscopic interpretation by the relation @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the number of accessible micro - states , compatible with the various macroscopic parameters such as temperature , pressure and volume .",
    "although such an interpretation for @xmath6 is incomplete , important progress has been made in various approaches to quantum gravity @xcite .",
    "this , coupled with the area proportionality of bh entropy ( as opposed to volume proportionality ) , has raised a fundamental question in quantum gravity , namely : _ what is the origin of bh entropy ? _",
    "potential candidates include strings , @xmath7-branes , spin - network states and conformal degrees of freedom at the horizon .",
    "another popular ( and also incomplete ) approach to the bh entropy is entanglement entropy , which is a measure of the information loss due to the spatial separation between the degrees of freedom inside and outside the horizon .",
    "the so - called brick wall model has been a concrete realization of this idea , in which entanglement entropy of the scalar ( and other ) fields have been computed by tracing over their degrees of freedom outside the horizon @xcite .",
    "the brick - wall entropy turns out to be proportional to the bh horizon area .",
    "the problem , however , is that due to the infinite growth of the density of states close to the horizon , one has to impose ultraviolet cut - off near the horizon and hence the entropy depends on the cut - off scale .",
    "this clearly is an undesirable feature .",
    "a simpler physical system was considered in refs.@xcite , in which the entropy of a scalar field on a suitably discretized _ flat _",
    "space was computed numerically , by tracing over the degrees of freedom of a hypothetical sphere of radius @xmath0 .",
    "this gave the remarkable result that the entanglement entropy was indeed proportional to the area of the spherical surface ( also see @xcite for analytical proofs of the result ) .",
    "this further supported the idea that entanglement was responsible for bh entropy .",
    "one of the key assumptions in refs.@xcite was that the harmonic oscillators ( hos ) resulting from the scalar field , on discretization of space , were _ all _ in their ground states .",
    "in this article , we would like to relax this assumption , and investigate the robustness of the entropy - area relation in these physical systems .",
    "as a step towards understanding of the entanglement entropy of @xmath8 coupled harmonic oscillators ( by tracing over @xmath9 degrees of freedom ) , in this work we consider two hos ( @xmath10 ) in two physically interesting limits : coherent states and superposition of excited and ground states .",
    "we show , numerically , that the presence of excited states results in an increase of entropy .",
    "the generalization to arbitrary @xmath8 will be left to a future publication @xcite .    in the next section , we will briefly review the entanglement entropy for ground state ho . in section ( [ secexcited ] ) , we will generalize the results for the two ho wave - function which is a superposition of ground state and the first excited state , and show that the entropy increases . in the concluding section",
    ", we will remark on the possible implications of our results to the physically interesting case of a large number of oscillators , whose couplings are determined by the lagrangian of a free scalar field .",
    "we will follow the notations of ref.@xcite to provide easy comparison , and henceforth use @xmath11 .",
    "the hamiltonian for two coupled hos of unit masses : h = has the ground state solution in terms of normal modes ( @xmath12 ) : _ 0 ( x_1 , x_2 ) = _ 0 ( x_+ ) _ 0(x_- ) = .",
    "when traced over the oscillator characterized by @xmath13 , the resultant density matrix is : _ 0 ( x_2 , x_2 ) = _ -^dx_1 _ 0 ( x_1 , x_2 ) _ 0^ ( x_1 , x_2 ) =  , whose eigenfunctions and eigenvalues , respectively are f_n(x ) = h_n ( x ) ( - x^2/2 ) , p_n = ( 1 - ) ^n   .",
    "the above density matrix gives rise to the following entropy @xcite : s ( ) = -tr(_0_0 ) = -_n=0^p_np_n = -(1- ) - , where r^2 <",
    "1,= _- r , = , = , = ( ) ^2 . note that @xmath14 correspond to the strongly coupled and uncoupled limits respectively .",
    "the hamiltonian for a free , massless scalar field @xmath15 in flat space - time is given by : h = d^3x  .",
    "discretizing the space ( @xmath16 being the lattice spacing , @xmath17 signifying the infrared cutoff , and @xmath18 are the parameters in the spherical harmonics @xmath19 ) : h =",
    "_ lm h_lm = _ j=1^n  .",
    "the above expression for @xmath20 is a special case of the general @xmath8-coupled oscillator hamiltonian : h = _",
    "i=1^n p_i^2 + _ i , j=1^n x_i k_ij x_j",
    ". the corresponding @xmath8-ho ground state wave function is given by : _ 0(x_1, ",
    ",x_n , x_n+1, ",
    ",x_n ) = ^1/4 , where @xmath21 .",
    "it can be shown that for the ground state wave function , the density matrix ( when one traces over @xmath22 oscillators ) can be factorized into a product of @xmath23 @xmath24-ho density matrices .",
    "thus the total entropy is simply the sum of the entropies . for the scalar field",
    ", @xmath25 is taken to be proportional to the radius of the sphere which is traced over , i. e. , @xmath26 .",
    "for the hamiltonian ( [ scham1 ] ) the interaction matrix @xmath27 can be read - off , resulting in the entanglement entropy s = 0.3 ( n+1/2)^2 ^2  , signifying area proportionality .",
    "it is worth noting , again , that all the oscillators are assumed to be in their ground states .",
    "let us now consider the excited states of the @xmath8 hos discussed in the previous section .",
    "the corresponding wave - function is : ( x_1,  ,x_n , x_n+1, ",
    ",x_n ) = ^1/4   _ i=1^n   h__i ( k_d^_i  x_i )  , where @xmath28 is a diagonal matrix ( @xmath29 ) , @xmath30 and @xmath31 are indices of the hermite polynomials .",
    "the density matrix , tracing over first @xmath25 of @xmath8 oscillators , is & & _ 0 ( x_n+1 ,  , x_n ; x_n+1, ",
    ",x_n ) = ^1/2 _ i=1^n dx_i + & & _",
    "i=1^n   h__i ( k_d_i^  x_i ) _",
    "j=1^n   h__j ( k_d_j^  x_j ) .",
    "the evaluation of the integral of the product of @xmath32 hermite polynomials , although may not be impossible , is in general , non - trivial . in order to keep the calculations simple ,",
    "we consider two specific physical cases : ( i ) coherent states and ( ii ) superposition of ground and first excited states .",
    "the coherent states , which are eigenstates of the harmonic oscillator annihilation operator with real eigenvalues , are described by the following wave function : _ cs ( x , a ) _ 0(x - a ) = e^-ip a  _ 0 ( x )  .",
    "the expectation of the position operator , w.r.t the coherent state wave function , oscillates in time with an amplitude @xmath16 and the state has the minimum allowable uncertainty p  x = , same as that of the ground state . for two coupled oscillators ,",
    "the corresponding coherent state is : _",
    "cs(x_1,x_2 ) _ cs ( x_+,a ) _ cs ( x_-,b ) = _ 0 ( x_+-a ) _ 0 ( x_b ) . defining @xmath33",
    "it is easy to show that the corresponding density matrix retains the same form as ( [ dens1 ] ) , albeit in terms of these new variables : _",
    "cs(x_2,x_2 ) = _ out ( x_2,x_2 ) .",
    "thus , from eqs .",
    "( [ ev1 ] ) , it follows that the eigenfunctions are @xmath34 and eigenvalues remain unchanged ( @xmath35 ) , and we get the interesting result that the entropy is the same as that for the ground state !",
    "presumably , this is because of the fact that coherent states are obtained by translating the ground state in phase space .",
    "the result can be easily generalized to an arbitrary number of harmonic oscillators @xcite .",
    "next , we consider the superposition of the ground and first excited state of the 2-ho system : ( x_1,x_2 ) = _ 1   _",
    "1(x_+ ) _ 0(x_- ) + _ 1  _ 0(x_+ ) _",

    "although from the identity of particles one would expect @xmath37 , we do not impose such a condition at this point . from ( [ dens3 ] )",
    ", the density matrix follows : ( x_2,x_2 ) = _ 0(x_2,x_2 ) [ a ( x_2 ^ 2+x_2^2 ) + b x_2 x_2 + c ( x_2 + x_2 ) + d ] , where @xmath38 is the ground state density matrix given by eq .",
    "( [ dens1 ] ) , and the constants are given as : & & a = _ 1 ^ 2 a + _ 1 ^ 2 a_3 + _",

    "it can be verified that : @xmath39 to find the eigenvalues of the density matrix ( [ dens2 ] ) , we follow the general procedure outlined in ref .",
    "first , we expand @xmath40 in terms of general ho eigenstates ( although , in principle any complete set of functions should suffice ) : ( x_2,x_2 ) = _ n=0^h_n ( x_2 ) g_n(x_2 )  ,   h_m(x_2 ) = n_m ( ) ( - ) h_m (  x_2 )  .",
