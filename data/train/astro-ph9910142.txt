    "( 1989 ) proposed the wind  outflow ",
    "inflow ( woi ) scenario as a possible explanation for one of the most striking properties of the x  ray emission of elliptical galaxies , i.e. , the large scatter in the @xmath1 diagram of roughly two orders of magnitude in @xmath0 at any fixed @xmath3 ( fabbiano 1989 , fabbiano , kim & trinchieri 1992 ) . in their subsequent extensive exploration of 1d hydrodynamical models",
    "ciotti et al .",
    "( 1991 , hereafter cdpr ) assumed that the type i supernova ( snia ) rate decreases in time as @xmath4 , faster than the decrease of the mass return rate from the ( passively ) evolving stellar population , which varies in time approximately as @xmath5 . in these models ,",
    "the gas lost by the stars is initially driven out of the galaxy through a supersonic wind powered by the thermalization of the kinetic energy injected in the interstellar medium ( ism ) by the snias .",
    "as the specific energy input decreases , the wind turns into a subsonic outflow and eventually the flow reverts to an inflow regime , at the time of the so  called _ cooling catastrophe _ ( @xmath6 ) . in pace with the content of the x ",
    "ray emitting hot gas , @xmath0 decreases during the wind phase and increases during the outflow regime up to a maximum reached at @xmath6 .",
    "later on , @xmath0 slowly decreases roughly following the quenching of the snia heating @xmath7 .",
    "cdpr ran several 1d numerical simulations , showing how @xmath6 critically depends on the values of the structural parameters of the host galaxy , such as the scale  length of the stellar distribution ( e.g , the effective radius for de vaucouleurs profiles or the so  called core radius for king profiles ) , the scale  length of the dark matter halo , the relative amount of total masses of the two distributions .",
    "small changes in one ( or more ) of these parameters produce a large shift ( of the order of some gyr ) of @xmath6 , causing two galaxies of virtually the same @xmath8 to be caught at very different @xmath0 after a hubble time . as a consequence , the above  mentioned @xmath0 scatter at fixed @xmath8 finds a simple explanation in the woi scenario .",
    "the main objection raised against this scenario has been the claimed detection of low iron abundance in the ism of ellipticals .",
    "in fact , under the assumption of solar abundance ratios , the analysis of the available data suggests a very low iron abundance , consistent with no snias enrichment , and even lower than that of the stellar component ( ohashi et al .",
    "1990 , awaki et al .",
    "1991 , ikebe et al .",
    "1992 , serlemitsos et al .",

    "1994 , awaki et al .",
    "1994 , arimoto et al .",
    "1997 , matsumoto et al .",
    "however , some authors have found that more complex multitemperature models with a higher abundance give a better fit to the data ( kim et al .",
    "1996 , buote & fabian 1998 ) .",
    "this is rather puzzling , in that a value as high as one fourth of the standard tammann ( 1982 ) rate @xmath9 snu ( for @xmath10 km s@xmath11 mpc@xmath11 ) agrees with the current optical estimates of the present day snia rate ( cappellaro et al . 1997 ) .",
    "several models have been calculated with this new rate ( pellegrini & ciotti 1998 , dercole & ciotti 1998 , hereafter dc ) , resulting in the main features of the woi scenario being preserved , provided the amount of dark matter is properly scaled down .    in any case , even though @xmath12 , it is well known that the pure cooling flow scenario is unable , in isolated galaxies , to reproduce the observed scatter ( see , e.g. , cdpr ) . as a consequence ,",
    "the possible environmental origin of the @xmath1 scatter has been proposed .",
    "although some discussion was dedicated to environmental effects , the bulk of the cdpr simulations did not consider ambient influences .",
    "it is known , however , that the majority of early type galaxies is found in clusters , where they certainly suffer several environmental interactions .",
    "more specifically , 1 ) thermal conduction with the intracluster medium ( icm ) ; 2 ) ram pressure stripping of the ism due to the motion of the galaxies with respect to the icm ; 3 ) influence of the cluster tidal field ; 4 ) galaxy  galaxy gravitational encounters .    because the icm in rich clusters is much hotter ( @xmath13 k ) than the galactic gas flows ( @xmath14 k )",
    ", heat is expected to flow into the galactic ism if thermal conduction is not suppressed by magnetic fields .",
    "it is easy to show that the heat transferred by an unimpeded thermal conduction is much larger than any other galactic energy budget , and evaporation can hardly be avoided .",
    "the very existence of bright x  ray ellipticals thus suggests that heat conduction must be suppressed to a great extent ( see , e.g. , cdpr , and references therein ) .",
    "the ram pressure effect of the icm on the ism of the elliptical galaxies was discussed by dercole et al .",
    "( 1993 ) in the woi scenario , and , e.g. , by balsara , livio & odea ( 1994 , and references therein ) in the cooling flow scenario .",
    "while numerical models show that ram pressure is very effective in stripping galaxies of gas , observations reveal that numerous cluster galaxies are strong x  ray emitters , thus showing their ability to retain their hot ism . for example",
    ", dow & white ( 1995 ) , found that ellipticals in coma are as x  ray bright as in virgo .",
    "this situation appears rather puzzling , and certainly not satisfactorily understood .",
    "the mean cluster gravitational field acts on the structure of each galaxy and its gaseous halo , as a weak tidal field .",
    "@xmath15body numerical simulations ( e.g. , ciotti & dutta , 1994 ) show that its effect on the galactic stellar component is very small , consisting essentially in a re  orienting of the galactic major axis with respect to the cluster center .    in summary ,",
    "while some effort was spent by several authors in considering the influence of the icm on the ism of ellipticals , up to now no attempt was made to study the response of the x  ray emitting ism of cluster ellipticals to the tidal interaction due to the cluster field and to a close encounter with a nearby galaxy .",
    "as we will see , in a typical cluster , encounters close enough to have non negligible dynamical effects on the ism are likely to occur .    in this paper",
    "we show the results of 2d numerical hydrodynamical models focusing on the influence both of the cluster tidal field and of a transient external gravitational field on the evolution of the ism of ellipticals in the woi and cooling flow scenarios . in ",
    "2 we describe the galaxy model , the hydrodynamical equations , and the assumptions adopted in our simulations .",
    "the results are presented in  3 . a discussion and the conclusions are finally given in  4 .",
    "in order to better compare the present results with those obtained by cdpr , we adopt for the model galaxy the same bright and dark matter ( dm ) distributions considered by these authors for their basic model ( the so  called _ king reference model _ , krm ) .",
    "the stellar density distribution is a truncated king ( 1972 ) model @xmath16 and the dm density profile is a truncated quasi ",
    "isothermal model @xmath17 here @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the central density and scale  length of the luminous and dm density distributions , respectively , while @xmath20 is their common truncation radius .",
    "the total galaxy density , potential , and mass are @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 .    as for the krm in cdpr we assume @xmath24 g @xmath25 , @xmath26 g @xmath25 , @xmath27 pc , @xmath28 and @xmath29 kpc . with these parameters @xmath30 and @xmath31 , respectively , and the galaxy lies on the so  called fundamental plane . it should be noted that several recent indications , from high  resolution @xmath15body simulations ( dubinski & carlberg 1991 ; navarro , frenk & white 1997 ) as well as from theoretical arguments ( evans & collett 1997 ; ciotti 1996,1999 ) , seem to suggest a peaked density distribution for the dm halos , as for example that used in the numerical simulations of gas flows carried out by pellegrini & ciotti ( 1998 ) . in spite of this",
    ", we decided to maintain here the functional form for the halo as in the krm , in order to better understand the effects of the tidal interactions by comparison with the unperturbed model .",
    "of course , a self  consistent treatment of the evolution of galactic gas flows in the cluster environment is a formidable task , both for the complexity of the involved physics , and for the high dimensionality of the parameter space ( requiring very large computational resources to be fully explored ) .",
    "our aims are far more narrow , focusing on the qualitative understanding of the effects of a representative tidal encounter . in this line , the mass @xmath32 of the perturbing galaxy ( the _ perturber _ ) is assumed to be equal to the mass of the galaxy , @xmath33 , because we are not interested here in the effects of interactions with significantly less massive galaxies . in a subsequent paper ( pellegrini , dercole & ciotti , in preparation )",
    "we explore the effects produced on the x  ray emission of a galaxy model similar to that here discussed by a collision with a significantly less massive cluster galaxy .",
    "we derive and discuss here the hydrodynamical equations describing the evolution of the gas flows in our models , using the general equations given in appendix a.2 . in the following , bold ",
    "face symbols represent vectors . in the ( baricentric ) cluster inertial reference frame",
    "@xmath34 , the center of mass of the galaxy and of the perturber are @xmath35 and @xmath36 , respectively ; moreover , @xmath37 and @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the standard norm . for computational reasons",
    "these equations are written in a non  inertial reference system @xmath40 fixed by the following rules : the origin of @xmath40 coincides with @xmath35 , @xmath41 is the position vector in @xmath40 , the @xmath42 axis points at all times towards @xmath36 , and finally @xmath43 .",
    "we derive first the effective gravitational field experienced by the gas in the frame @xmath40 ( see equation [ a16 ] ) , and we discuss two assumptions used in our models , namely that 1 ) the cluster tidal field is negligible during the encounter , and that 2 ) the perturber trajectory can be approximated by a straight line , covered with constant velocity .",
    "although in the numerical code the gravitational forces are not approximated by their linear expansion ( tidal regime ) , here we consider the associated tidal fields , in order to obtain the geometrical conditions for the validity of the assumptions above .    at any position @xmath44 in the cluster frame @xmath34",
    ", the total acceleration is @xmath45 , where @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 are the cluster , perturber , and galaxy potentials , respectively , and @xmath49 is the gradient operator with respect to @xmath44 .",
    "note that the self  gravity of the gaseous component is not considered .",

    "are expanded up to the second order around @xmath35 , i.e. , @xmath52 where @xmath53 , @xmath54 is the standard inner product , and @xmath55 is the tidal tensor associated with @xmath46 , whose elements are given by @xmath56 a similar relation holds for the gravitational field produced by the perturber , where now @xmath57 and @xmath58 is the tidal tensor associated with @xmath47 . in this approximation ,",
    "simple calculations show that the effective gravitational field entering equation ( a16 ) is given by @xmath59(\\xv-\\rv)+\\gvg,\\ ] ] where @xmath60 .",

    "actually , the galaxy and the perturber will change their shape during the interaction .",
    "however , for small deformations the potential remains rounder than the underlying density distribution ( see , e.g. , binney & tremaine 1987 , hereafter bt ) , and so we regard equation ( 6 ) as still largely valid for our problem .",
    "moreover , the effect of the deformation of the pertuber density influences the tidal tensor @xmath58 given in equation ( 7 ) only at higher order in @xmath63 ( see , e.g. , danby 1962 , chapter 5 ) . as a consequence , in all simulations",
    "the ( visible and dark ) mass densities of the galaxy and of the pertuber are assumed to maintain their initial spherical symmetry .    as anticipated in point 1 ) above , in our simulations we do not consider the term @xmath55 appearing in equation ( 5 ) , in order to reduce the dimensionality of the parameter space .",
    "the influence of the cluster tidal field in absence of close encounters was explored separately , and it is discussed in  4 .",
    "we now determine when the perturber tidal field @xmath58 is dominant over @xmath55 .",
    "the cluster tidal field at distance @xmath64 from the cluster center is given by equation ( 4 ) , and its explicit expression is @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the cluster mean density inside @xmath67 , and @xmath68 .",
    "the matrix expression of @xmath55 is obtained in the reference frame @xmath34 with its @xmath69 axis aligned along @xmath35 ( see , e.g. , ciotti & dutta 1994 ) . as a consequence , in equation ( 8) the _ radial _ and the _ tangential _ components of the cluster tidal field are apparent , and by substitution of @xmath70 with @xmath71 . ] . in order to obtain a simple estimate of the relative importance of the cluster and",
    "pertuber tidal fields , we consider a typical cluster with a density profile @xmath70 as that given in equation ( 1 ) , with a core radius @xmath72 kpc , and a central velocity dispersion @xmath73 km s@xmath11 ( sarazin 1986 ) .",
    "we compare the _ minimum _ ( absolute ) value of the perturber tidal field components , @xmath74 , with the radial and tangential components of the cluster tidal field . in fig .",
    "1 these quantities are showed , and it turns out that the cluster tidal field can be neglected for @xmath75 kpc everywhere but inside the cluster core .      following the arguments above",
    ", we assumed in our simulations @xmath76 kpc as the minimum distance during the encounter , in order to safely neglect the cluster tidal force on the ism .",
    "actually , the ( full ) perturber gravitational field is taken into account for distances much larger than @xmath77 , i.e. , for @xmath78 kpc .",
    "this in order to avoid a sudden change in the total gravitational field experienced by the gas flow , that could be at the origin of unphysical oscillations . in other words ,",
    "up to the time @xmath79 ( a free parameter in the simulations , whose choice is given in  3 ) the gas flow evolves as in cdpr , successively the perturber is placed at a distance of @xmath80 kpc , with an initial velocity of @xmath81 km s@xmath11 relative to the galaxy .",
    "we indicate with @xmath82 the time at which @xmath83 , and with @xmath84 .    in order to follow the time evolution of the ism",
    ", we obviously need to know how @xmath63 changes with time . adopting equation ( 3 ) to describe the effect of the cluster gravitational field on the galaxy and pertuber motions ,",
    "one obtains @xmath85 with the assumed parameters for the galaxy , the perturber , and the cluster density distribution , it is easy to verify from the equation above that the effects of @xmath55 on the motion of the two galaxies are non negligible for values of @xmath63 in the range of interest , and so the relative orbit can not be described by a two  body problem . as anticipated by point 2 ) in  2.1.1 , we arbitrarily adopt a linear trajectory for @xmath86 , described at constant velocity @xmath87 . in this assumption @xmath88 myr , and simple geometrical arguments show that the only non  zero component of the angular velocity in @xmath40 , entering equation ( a16 ) , is given by : @xmath89 we point out that , as a consequence of the geometry of the problem , the non  inertial forces associated with the rotation of @xmath40 can not be taken into consideration by our 2d code , and so we drop these terms in the hydrodynamical equations used in the numerical simulations ( equations [ 12]-[14 ] ) . in ",
    "4 we will calculate _ a posteriori _",
    ", from the computed models , the ratio between the gravity and the fictitious forces associated with @xmath90 , in order to obtain a rough estimate of the severity of this approximation .",
    "although this assumption may appear rather rough , the computed models show that the perturbations in the ism do not depend on the details of the physical process which generate them .",
    "thus our assumption is not particularly severe .      as already discussed in the literature ( mathews & baker 1971 ) , the mass and energy sources in elliptical galaxies are associated with their evolving stellar population : the two main contributions are due to the gas lost by the red giants and to the ejecta of snias .",
    "the total mass return rate , expressed in the general case in equations ( a15)-(a17 ) , is given here by @xmath91 , where @xmath92 .",
    "we adopt the same @xmath93 as in cdpr ( equations [ 3 ] and [ 7 ] there ) .",
    "in particular , this corresponds to a present day @xmath94 snu , i.e. , 2/3 of the standard tammann s rate .",
    "moreover , we assume that the internal energy associated with the mass ejection in both processes is negligible with respect to the thermalization of the stellar velocity dispersion and to the snia ejection velocity .",
    "the _ exact _",
    "expression for the _ injection energy _ is given by @xmath95 where the last formula is derived under the hypothesis that 1 ) the velocity of stellar winds is considerably lower than the stellar velocity dispersion ( i.e. , @xmath96 ) , and that 2 ) the stellar velocity dispersion is lower than the velocity of snia ejecta ( i.e. , @xmath97 ) . in accordance with the previous works we adopt the second , approximate expression for @xmath98 , but we remind that in some circumstances the full one should be used .",
    "the cooling rate per unit volume is given by @xmath99 , where we parametrize @xmath100 following the prescription of mathews & bregman ( 1978 ) , after correction of a wrong sign in their equation ( a2 ) .",
    "finally , no streaming velocity of the stellar component is assumed to be present in @xmath40 , and accordingly in the momentum and energy equations ( a16)-(a17 ) we set @xmath101 .",
    "this assumption can be qualitatively explained considering that , when the mutual interaction between the galaxy and the perturber starts , their stellar and dark matter distributions are distorted .",
    "these deformations are responsible for the appearance of a net torque acting on the galaxy density distribution , from which an angular momentum is originated .",
    "of course , the real situation is much more complex , but our simple assumptions should capture the kinematical behavior of the galaxy stellar and dark matter components .      as a consequence of all the previous assumptions and discussions , equations ( a15)-(a17 ) are specialized in the numerical code as follows :    @xmath102    @xmath103    @xmath104    @xmath105 , @xmath106 , and @xmath107 are respectively the density , the internal energy per unit volume , and the velocity of the gas , expressed in @xmath40 .",
    "the explicit expressions of @xmath108 and @xmath109 in this frame are given in equations ( 6 ) and ( 7 ) .",
    "the gas pressure is @xmath110 , where @xmath111 is the ratio of the specific heats . to integrate the set of equations we used a second  order , upwind ,",
    "2d numerical code described in dc , coupled with a staggered , spherical , eulerian grid .",
    "given the symmetry of the problem , the grid covers polar angles @xmath112 with 82 equally spaced angular zones .",
    "the radial coordinate is divided into 72 zones and extends up to 95 kpc . in order to get a reasonable spatial resolution in the inner region ,",
    "a geometrical progression is adopted for the radial mesh size , the first one being 100 pc wide . reflecting boundary",
    "are assumed everywhere but at the outer boundary , where outflow conditions are adopted . with the adopted non  inertial reference frame @xmath40 and numerical grid ,",
    "the perturber is always outside the grid and moves along the @xmath113 direction ( i.e. , along the @xmath42 axis ) . as in cdpr",
    ", the gas temperature is not allowed to drop below @xmath114 k , to avoid an excessive reduction of the time step when a rapid cooling is present .",
    "we assume the model galaxy to be initially devoid of gas due to the previous activity of the type ii sne . a discussion on the reliability and implications of this assumption is given in cdpr .",
    "given the courant condition on the angular mesh close to the center , the time steps for the numerical computations are rather short ( few 10@xmath115 yr ) .",
    "we thus computed only few models .",
    "we first ran a model without the perturber and cluster gravitational field ( hereafter model m0 ) , i.e. , a model analogous to the krm presented in cdpr .",
    "as for the krm , the cooling catastrophe occurs before 15 gyr , and all the three dynamical phases  wind , outflow and inflow  are recovered is greater than in the krm ( 11 gyr instead of 9.3 gyr , see fig .",
    "3 ) . this depends on the different value assumed for the mean molecular weight ( 0.62 instead of 0.5 ) which enters quadratically in the cooling term . by the way",
    ", this shows once more the extreme dependence of the woi models on the parameter values . ] .    in order to understand whether there are differences in the flow evolution depending on the time @xmath82",
    "at which the maximum approach happens , we ran three models ( m1 , m2 , m3 ) for three different values of @xmath82 , namely @xmath116 gyr . in each of these models",
    "the initial conditions are given by the hydrodynamical quantities of model m0 at @xmath117 . in model m1",
    "the galaxy starts to be perturbed when it is still in its wind phase , while in models m2 and m3 the galaxy is perturbed when is in the outflow and inflow phase , respectively ( see fig .",
    "we also ran a pure cooling flow model ( hereafter model mc ) in which the energy injection by snia is absent . for this model we set @xmath118 gyr .",
    "although this model is expected to be rather similar to model m3 , we ran it to ascertain whether the presence of the sne energy input may affect the perturbed gas flow , even in the inflow phase .    finally , we ran two more models without perturber , in order to check the sensitivity of our results to some of the assumptions made .",
    "namely , 1 ) model mp is analogous to model m3 , but with a _ random _",
    "large  scale velocity field perturbation added to the initial conditions , as done by kritsuk , bhringer & mller ( 1998 ) in their simulations ; and 2 ) model mt is analogous to model mc , but with the cluster tidal field taken into account during a galaxy orbit inside the cluster .",
    "we discuss here in detail the m1 model , in which the galaxy starts to be perturbed during the wind phase .",
    "the other m2 and m3 models are presented by comparison with the m1 model , pointing out differences and analogies .",
    "figure 2 shows the density contours and the velocity field of the gas at four different times .",
    "panel @xmath119 is a shot taken at a time very close to @xmath82 , when the distance to the perturber is slightly larger than @xmath77 ; the exact time and relative distance are @xmath120=(6.4 gyr , 141.4 kpc ) .",
    "the ism in the galactic region facing the perturber accelerates toward the right direction ( where the perturber is located ) , and is lost by the galaxy at higher velocity than in the opposite direction .",
    "this apparent asymmetry is due to the fact that in the code the full gravitational field of the perturber is considered , which , for short distances , differs significantly from the associated ( symmetric ) tidal field . in panel",
    "@xmath121 ( @xmath122 gyr ) the effects of the encounter are still clearly visible , although the perturber distance from the galaxy ( for the assumed rectilinear trajectory ) is @xmath123 mpc .",
    "this is also true at later times ( panels @xmath124 and @xmath125 ) , where eddies are established and different dynamical regimes are present , some regions being in outflow and others in inflow , a situation analogous of that found in dc on their investigation on gas flows in ( isolated ) s0 galaxies .",
    "the x  ray luminosity evolution of model m1 is shown as a solid line in fig . 3a . for comparison ,",
    "the dashed line represents the @xmath0 temporal evolution of the model m0 , and the dotted line shows the time evolution of the snia energy input for unit time , @xmath126 .",
    "as the encounter with the perturber occurs , the cooling catastrophe is anticipated , as a consequence of the increase in the mean density in the galactic central regions produced by the tidal perturbation , and @xmath0 reaches its ( first ) maximum at @xmath127 gyr , earlier than for model m0 ( @xmath128 gyr ) .",
    "this is an interesting result .",
    "in fact , note that considering spherical coordinates with the @xmath42 polar axis ( @xmath129 ) oriented towards the perturber ( the coordinate system actually adopted in the numerical code ) , from equation ( 7 ) one obtains that the radial component of the tidal force ( for unit mass ) is given by @xmath130 and is _ expansive _ for @xmath131 and @xmath132 . on the complementary spherical sector",
    "the field is _",
    "compressive_. due to the strong non  linear dependence of the cooling function on the gas density , it is not easy to determine without the aid of numerical simulations which effect prevails in determining the successive evolution of the flow , i.e. , if the cooling catastrophe is anticipated or retarded by the effect of the tidal field .",
    "our results show that actually compression wins the game and cooling increases .    successively",
    ", strong and fast oscillations in @xmath0 occur , whose amplitude may reach an order of magnitude .",
    "these oscillations are due to correspondent oscillations of the ism density in the galactic central regions : in fact , most of the x  ray luminosity is emitted there , the oscillations in @xmath0 are basically due to variations and/or rearrangements in the hot gas density , because @xmath133 is nearly constant in the range of x  ray temperatures . ] , for @xmath134 .",
    "it is important to note that , while these density oscillations reflect dramatically on @xmath0 , they have little effect on the overall content of the hot gas which decreases monotonically in this phase , as shown in fig .",
    "3d ( medium solid line ) .",
    "this strongly unsteady evolution is due to the non  spherical gas accretion onto the galaxy central region .",
    "converging to the center , non  radial gas streams interact and compress each other , giving rise to tongues of dense cold gas ( see fig .",
    "4 , where enlargements of the gas distribution and of the velocity field in the central region are shown ) .",
    "these tongues are rapidly accreted onto the galaxy center .",
    "when the compressed gas quickly cools , @xmath0 suddenly increases .",
    "the cooled gas disappears in the center , leaving behind regions of low gas density which do not radiate efficiently and tend to expand as they are heated by snia : as a consequence @xmath0 abruptly decreases .",
    "new streams of hot gas coming from the outer regions contrast the expansion of the gas close to the center and form new cold filaments .",
    "this cycle is fed by gravity and amplified by @xmath126 . actually , the hot gas mass decreases after every spike of @xmath0 ( fig .",
    "3d , medium solid line ) , while the cold gas mass increases specularly ( fig .",
    "3d , light solid line ) .",
    "when the mass of the hot ism is sufficiently reduced , @xmath0 falls by nearly two orders of magnitude .",
    "successively , the low density , non radiating hot gas is able to revert the flow on large scale , and a new wind phase starts ( see fig.3a and fig.3d for @xmath135 gyr ) .",
    "the importance of snia in maintaining this cycle is apparent when considering the x  ray luminosity evolution of model mc , shown in fig .",
    "5 . in this model ,",
    "where @xmath136 , the oscillations of @xmath0 have smaller amplitudes and the dramatic drop shown by the model m1 is absent . in fact , the @xmath0 oscillations in model mc never exceed a factor of three relatively to the unperturbed cooling flow solution .",
    "concerning the total mass budget ( fig.3d , heavy solid line ) , it is apparent its substantial reduction when compared to model m0 ( fig.3d , heavy dashed line ) .",
    "thus , the tidal encounter is able to strip a significant fraction of ism from the m1 model .",
    "figure 3bc show that models m2 and m3 ( where the maximum approach happens in the outflow and inflow phase , respectively ) exhibit @xmath0 oscillations similar to model m1 .",
    "it is however apparent that in these latter models the dramatic drop in @xmath0 ( occurring in model m1 at @xmath137 gyr ) , is absent over an hubble time .",
    "this is due to the fact that @xmath126 at the time of the encounter is lower than in model m1 ( fig.3abc , dotted line ) .",
    "thus less energy is available to sustain a turbulent flow , and the @xmath0 ( and mass budget ) evolution of models m2 and m3 is more similar to model mc .",
    "the hot and cold ism masses of models m2 and m3 ( medium and light solid lines in fig .",
    "3ef ) evolve in the same qualitative way as in model m1 ( fig .",
    "3d ) . on the contrary , their total mass ( heavy solid line ) increases , at odd with model m1 .",
    "this result at first could seem surprising because model m1 is in a wind phase for @xmath135 gyr , and one could expect an easier degassing than in models m2 and m3 .",
    "actually , the hot gas density in model m1 is _ lower _ than in models m2 and m3 ( as can be seen considering the amount of hot gas mass in the three models ) : as a consequence , the mass loss at the outskirts ( @xmath138 ) of the galaxies _ increases _ from model m1 to model m3 . in model m1",
    "the mass loss rate is lower than the mass return rate from the evolving stellar population , @xmath139 , the opposite is true for models m2 , and this explains the different time behavior of the total mass in the three models .",
    "the surface brightness profiles of all computed models do not result strongly influenced by the tidal interaction .",
    "as a representative case we describe the x  ray surface brightness distribution @xmath140 of model m1 only . during all the model evolution ,",
    "the isophotes remain rather circular , although locally distorted , even for a viewing angle @xmath141 ( i.e. a direction perpendicular to the line joining the galaxy and the perturber , where the effect is maximum ) .",
    "this can be seen in fig .",
    "6 , where two sets of isophotes are superimposed , referring to @xmath122 gyr ( solid lines ) and @xmath142 gyr ( dotted lines ) .",
    "these times correspond to a local maximum and minimum of @xmath0 , respectively ( black dots in fig .",
    "radial cross sections of @xmath140 are shown ( after an angular mean ) in fig .",
    "note that when @xmath0 is higher ( @xmath122 gyr ) the extra ",
    "luminosity is radiated mostly from the center , and so density oscillations here are by far more important than in the rest of the galaxy .",
    "in this paper we have investigated the consequences of a gravitational encounter on the dynamics of the hot , x  ray emitting ism of cluster elliptical galaxies .",
    "we adopted a spherical model galaxy identical to the king reference model described in cdpr in order to better compare our results with the `` standard '' woi picture .",
    "it turns out that once the gas is perturbed by the gravity of a galaxy passing nearby , it remains turbulent for the rest of the time .",
    "in fact , when the spherical symmetry is broken by the tidal interaction , non  radial streams converging toward the center merge thus compressing the gas , which quickly cools and `` disappears '' into the center . some regions close to the center",
    "are then formed where the gas is rarefied and tends to expand as heated by the sourcess terms .",
    "this expansion is contrasted by the outer ism which is falling to smaller radii , and new cold filaments are formed . from an observational point of view",
    "the most striking consequences are the large oscillations of @xmath0 coupled to the oscillations of the gas density .",
    "these oscillations may have amplitudes ranging over two orders of magnitude while the x  ray surface brightness does not stray dramatically from spherical symmetry .",
    "thus , at least for woi models , the x  ray luminosity does not represent a good diagnostic of the dynamical state of the gas when tidal interactions are present .",
    "the mechanism described above has been proven to be self  sustaining and independent of the external cause which initially originated it .",
    "in fact , we ran the model mp where , as anticipated in  3 , the perturber is absent , the galaxy is at rest in a inertial reference system , and a random large ",
    "scale `` noise '' is superimposed on the initial velocity field . in model",
    "mp the maximum allowed relative amplitude of the perturbation with respect to the unperturbed velocity field is 20 per cent . apart from this , the initial conditions are the same as for model m3 .",
    "the mass budget and @xmath0 evolution of model mp are shown in fig .",
    "8 , which should be compared with fig .",
    "as can be seen , this model behaves mostly as model m3 .",
    "the spikes in @xmath0 are somewhat larger , but this is due to our ( arbitrary ) choice of the maximum amplitude of the velocity perturbations .",
    "we point out that model mp is rather similar to models discussed by kritsuk et al .",
    "however , a significant comparison between these models and model mp can not be made because the latter authors stop their simulations after only 50 myr , a time interval too short to predict the behaviour of the flow on cosmological times .",
    "the major insight derived from model mp is that _ the evolution of perturbed woi models is weakly dependent on the specific nature of the perturbation .",
    "_    we also ran a pure cooling flow model with a tidal perturbation ( model mc ) : in this case the @xmath0 oscillations are significantly reduced ( approximately of a factor of ten ) with respect to those exhibited by model m3 .",
    "the most important consequence is that _ tidal interactions can not be at the origin of the spread in the @xmath143 diagram if the pure cooling flow scenario applies_.    as discussed in  2 , in our simulations we neglected the cluster tidal field , which is present in equation ( 5 ) .",
    "although the magnitude of the cluster tidal field during the encounter is negligible ( see  2.1.1 ) , one can ask whether the _ cumulative _ effects of such field over cosmological times are significative . in order to check this possibility , as anticipated in  3 we ran the model mt , in which @xmath136 , no perturber is present , and only the cluster tidal field is considered .",
    "the resulting evolution of this model ( not shown here ) is very similar to that of model mc , but the amplitudes in the @xmath0 oscillations are much reduced .",
    "we thus conclude that the cluster tidal field can be safely neglected when studying the effects of galaxy  galaxy encounters like those considered here on the x  ray properties of early  type galaxies .",
    "moreover , it must be added that the role of the cluster tidal field is further reduced by the fact that during a hubble time a galaxy may experience several encounters of the type discussed here .",
    "a simple estimate of this number can be obtained as follows .",
    "suppose that the galaxy belongs to a typical rich cluster like that described in  2.1.1 , and containing @xmath144 galaxies , whose luminosity function is given by @xmath145 where @xmath146 @xmath147 , @xmath148 ( schechter 1976 , sarazin 1986 ) , and with lower and upper limits of @xmath149 and @xmath150 , respectively .",
    "using simple geometrical arguments it is easy to show that , for an impact parameter less than or equal to @xmath77 , the _",
    "mean _ number of interactions per galaxy during an hubble time @xmath151 is given by @xmath152 in the equation above @xmath153 is the fraction of the total number of galaxies with luminosity greater than @xmath8 .",
    "for example , @xmath154 for @xmath155 ( the luminosity of our galaxy model ) ; @xmath156 for @xmath157 ( one third of the luminosity of our galaxy model ) .",
    "it turns out that @xmath158 for @xmath159 .",
    "the same result is obtained considering galaxies with @xmath160 in a poor cluster ( or loose groups ) , with @xmath161 , @xmath162 kpc and @xmath163 km s@xmath11 ( see , e.g. , bahcall 1998 ) .",
    "obviously the above analysis does not apply to small compact galaxy groups containing only a few members .",
    "in fact , these systems are highly collisional , and the mean separation between galaxies is comparable to their dimensions ( see , e.g. , kelm , focardi , & palumbo 1998 ) . as a consequence ,",
    "strong gravitational interactions are frequent , the evolution of gas flows is higly perturbed , and the results of our simulations can not be directly applied in this case .    from a more observational point of view , the importance of the discussion above is also strengthen by the fact that , while it is true that the majority of elliptical galaxies are found in clusters , the galaxies from which the @xmath1 diagrams are constructed are either in groups or in the virgo cluster ( which is less rich than the cluster assumed in our simulations ) .",
    "hovewer , from the discussion above it results that the `` turbulent '' mechanism here described should be quite common in ellipticals in clusters and groups , while galaxies in compact groups can hardly avoid strong gravitational interactions , that should produce either strong variations in their x  ray luminosity or even substantial degassing .    as pointed out in  2.2 , with the computed models available , we are now in the position to evaluate the error induced by neglecting the non  inertial forces associated with the rotation of the adopted reference frame . from an analysis of the model s velocity field at different times ,",
    "it turns out that , when the perturber is closest , the coriolis and centrifugal forces are larger than the gravitational forces only within a small volume ( with a characteristic size of @xmath164 kpc ) at the edge of the galaxy facing the perturber , where the total gravity is very low .",
    "later ( @xmath165 myr ) , the gravity largely prevails ( by a factor 1001000 ) all over the computational grid .",
    "this is mainly due to the fact that for the assumed orbit @xmath166 ( see equation [ 10 ] ) , and so it quickly reduces after the encounter ; moreover , the non inertial force associated with @xmath167 vanishes when @xmath168 , and , for @xmath169 myr , @xmath170 . as a consequence , we believe that our results are reliable , and ,",
    "although neglecting the fictitious forces due to rotation may prevent from obtaining the exact values of the @xmath0 spikes , the essential physics is captured by the computed models .    in conclusion ,",
    "the main results of this work can be summarized as follows :    * in woi models the @xmath0 oscillations induced by tidal encounters last for several gyrs after the encounter is over .",
    "the qualitative evolution of these oscillations is not strongly dependent on the flow phase ( wind , outflow , or inflow ) occurring when the encounter starts ; moreover , they appear to be rather independent of the physical process generating them . the characteristic period of such oscillations is of the order of the sound crossing time of the hot gas in the galactic inner region . if the encounter happens quite early , when @xmath126 is still relatively high , then a catastrophic drop of @xmath0 is produced",
    ". these oscillations can contribute to the observed spread in the @xmath171 diagram for galaxies in clusters and groups .",
    "of course , this mechanism can not be at the origin of the @xmath0 scatter in isolated galaxies .",
    "* when compared to woi models , the amplitude of the @xmath0 oscillations in cooling flow models ( with @xmath136 ) is substantially reduced . as a consequence , tidal interactions can not be at the origin of the observed spread in the @xmath1 diagram in the `` pure '' ( no snia heating ) cooling flow scenario .",
    "* in all computed models , the x  ray surface brightness @xmath140 does not appear to be strongly distorted by tidal interactions .",
    "however , the ( angular mean ) radial profile of @xmath140 is steeper in the inner region in coincidence with the @xmath0 spikes .",
    "* we found that the tidal stripping due to the perturber is effective .",
    "in fact , approximately half of the gas content of the galaxy is lost in perturbed woi models when compared to the unperturbed one . in our pure cooling flow model the fraction of lost mass",
    "is reduced to one fourth . *",
    "the cluster tidal field _",
    "alone _ appears to be ineffective in producing large @xmath0 oscillations when compared to tidal interactions .",
    "moreover , during a hubble time , galaxies in clusters suffers several encounters of the kind described here , and so the importance of the cluster tidal field on the x  ray properties of early  type galaxies is further reduced .",
