    "magnetic ordering is a primary concern of classical magnetism .",
    "long - range order can be disrupted by the presence of disorder or of frustration between the magnetic degrees of freedom .",
    "quantum fluctuations form also an important path to destroy long - range order , specifically antiferromagnetic ( af ) order .",
    "they are particularly strong for low values of the spin @xmath10 and in low dimensionality .",
    "the prototypical model to study quantum fluctuations is the @xmath11 af heisenberg model @xmath12 where @xmath13 denote nearest - neighbor ( nn ) sites on a hypercubic lattice , and @xmath14 the spin operator [ of amplitude @xmath15 on site @xmath16 . while long - range order in the ground state of eq .",
    "is prohibited in one dimension ( 1d )  @xcite , it can be shown rigorously  @xcite that the system displays long - range order in @xmath17 for all @xmath18 . for @xmath11",
    ", there is no exact proof but the numerical computations  @xcite leave no doubt that this is also the case . in this paper",
    ", we deal only with this extreme quantum case @xmath11 and assume an even number @xmath19 of spins .",
    "the hamiltonian eq .   exhibits su(2 ) symmetry , as it commutes with the total spin operator @xmath20 .",
    "the total spin quantum number @xmath21 is defined by the eigenvalue @xmath22 of the operator @xmath23 . for af interactions , the ground state for finite @xmath19 of the hamiltonian eq .   on the hypercubic lattice can be proven  @xcite to be a total singlet @xmath24 .",
    "natural objects to describe such a singlet state are _ valence bonds _ ( vbs ) , which are intrinsically non - magnetic and antisymmetric objects , with two spins @xmath0 coupled into a singlet .",
    "this notion was introduced in the early days of quantum mechanics  @xcite and has regained interest thanks to the proposal that wave functions composed of vbs [ `` resonating valence bond ( rvb ) wave functions '' ] could describe a quantum spin - liquid phase without any magnetic order , for heisenberg models on frustrated lattices  @xcite .",
    "the idea is that local ( typically nn ) superpositions of vbs can effectively accommodate the constraint imposed by frustration in the building blocks of such lattices and lower the energy of the full system . while the original suggestion  @xcite of this scenario taking place on the triangular lattice is now abandoned ( since this lattice supports af long - range order  @xcite )",
    ", it stimulated many investigations which led to significant progresses in quantum magnetism .",
    "in fact , the existence of the rvb phase is established in several quantum dimer models  @xcite , which are effective models of quantum antiferromagnets .",
    "furthermore , the usefulness of vb wave functions has been demonstrated for the understanding of the low - energy physics of heisenberg af models on other frustrated lattices , such as kagome  @xcite or frustrated square lattices  @xcite .",
    "these developments have confirmed the importance of the vb picture in understanding quantum antiferromagnets .",
    "much of the studies of quantum antiferromagnets based on the vb picture is aimed at quantum spin liquids without a long - range antiferromagnetic order .",
    "however , it should be noted that the set of vb states , once including longer - range vbs beyond nearest neighbors , is _ overcomplete _ in the total singlet sector  @xcite .",
    "thus , any singlet state can be represented as a superposition of vb basis states .",
    "the finite - size ground state of the antiferromagnetic hamiltonian on the hypercubic lattice in @xmath7 dimensions is no exception , despite its long - range antiferromagnetic order .",
    "this somewhat counterintuitive fact is indeed consistent with the existence of symmetry - broken ground states in the thermodynamic limit , thanks to the asymptotic degeneracy in the thermodynamic limit @xmath25 of the `` anderson tower of states '' of nonzero total spin @xmath21 with the ground state  @xcite .",
    "an antiferromagnet is called a bipartite antiferromagnet if the sites can be grouped into two sublattices , and the heisenberg exchange interactions exist only between two sites belonging to different sublattices .",
    "examples include the antiferromagnets on a hypercubic lattice with only nearest - neighbor interactions .",
    "it is then natural to consider a restricted set of vb basis states , bipartite vb basis states , in which only vbs connecting different sublattices are allowed  @xcite .",
    "even the bipartite vb basis , if longer - range vbs are included , is overcomplete in the total singlet sector ( see _ e.g. _ ref .   or ref .  ) and",
    "thus can represent any singlet ground state of an @xmath11 antiferromagnet .",
    "in fact , in a pioneering work by liang , douot and anderson ( lda )  @xcite , the long - range - ordered af ground state of the heisenberg antiferromagnet on the square lattice was described in terms of bipartite vb basis states , including bipartite vbs of arbitrary length . in practice , this was done by defining a so - called amplitude product state , where the weight of every valence bond state is factorized into weights @xmath26 coming from contributing valence bonds of length @xmath27 .",
    "the original results of lda pointed to a minimal variational energy for the square lattice heisenberg model reached for a power law decay @xmath28 , with @xmath29 .",
    "the vb basis provides a new perspective for understanding quantum antiferromagnets , which is complementary to the more traditional @xmath30 basis . as an indication of its significance , a quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) algorithm based on the vb basis",
    "was proposed  @xcite and proved to be useful .",
    "the more recent numerical results from the vb - based qmc simulation  @xcite , obtained without assuming the power - law decay , imply @xmath31 rather than @xmath32 suggested by lda .",
    "this power - law decay and the value @xmath31 can be understood through a master equation  @xcite or other mean - field  @xcite approaches , which moreover predict @xmath33 to be the best variational ansatz for the ground state of eq .   in dimension @xmath34 , within amplitude product states .",
    "these previous works were explicitly assuming a certain amplitude product variational ansatz for the antiferromagnetic ground state  @xcite .",
    "however , one could instead also ask for the length distribution @xmath3 of valence bonds in the _ real _ ground state of heisenberg antiferromagnets .",
    "this question may at first glance seem ill defined since the expression of singlet states in terms of valence bonds is in general non - unique .",
    "fortunately , the occupation number of _ bipartite valence bonds _ is nevertheless still well defined  @xcite .    in this paper , we compute by analytical means the distribution of vb lengths @xmath3 for antiferromagnetic heisenberg models on hypercubic lattices in dimension @xmath34 . somewhat",
    "surprisingly , the question of vb distribution can be reduced to a problem of _ boundary field theory_.  @xcite boundary field theory has been found useful , not only in boundary critical phenomena and quantum impurity problems , but also in recent topics such as entanglement entropy .",
    "@xcite the vb distribution may be added to the list of applications of boundary field theory .",
    "the key in the relation is the identity  @xcite between the bipartite vb distribution and an overlap with the reference state , which is naturally related to boundary correlation functions .    in principle , any field theory , which is an appropriate effective theory for the bulk , can be used to calculate the bipartite vb distribution with a certain boundary condition .",
    "the ground state and low - energy excitations of the heisenberg antiferromagnet on the hypercubic lattice in @xmath7 spatial dimensions are believed to be described by the o(3 ) non - linear @xmath2 model .",
    "in fact , in the ground state , the su(2 ) symmetry is spontaneously broken in the non - linear @xmath2 model in @xmath7 , as is the case in the heisenberg antiferromagnet on the hypercubic lattice .",
    "the effective field theory in the low - energy limit is then reduced to the field theory of two massless nambu - goldstone modes .",
    "we will apply such a field theory with boundary , in order to study the bipartite vb distribution in @xmath7 dimensions .",
    "on the other hand , in @xmath6 , the physics is quite different as there is no spontaneous breaking of the symmetry .",
    "the system belongs to the universality class of tomonaga - luttinger liquids , which can be described by a free - boson field theory in @xmath6 spatial dimension .",
    "again , together with an appropriate boundary condition , it is applied to the bipartite vb distribution in @xmath6 dimension . as a result , in @xmath35 dimensions ,",
    "we find a power - law dependence @xmath36 , confirming previous results based on mean - field approximations  @xcite as well as a previous numerical qmc estimate  @xcite .",
    "the analytical predictions are compared in detail to the results of qmc simulations of the heisenberg model in dimension @xmath6 , 2 and 3 .    while `` free - boson field theory '' is a common ingredient for the cases @xmath6 and @xmath7 , the correspondence between the field theory and the quantum antiferromagnet is quite different , reflecting the very different physics .",
    "in fact , the difference between @xmath6 and @xmath7 becomes apparent in the _ correlations _ between vbs , as follows . in the wave function studied by lda",
    ", it is assumed that the weight of each vb configuration can be factorized in products of weights carried by each vb individually : @xmath37 where @xmath38 denotes a vb configuration composed of different vbs @xmath39 formed between spins at sites @xmath16 and @xmath40 .",
    "the amplitude @xmath41 is often chosen as depending on the distance @xmath42 between @xmath16 and @xmath40 , _",
    "i.e. _ , the `` length '' of the vb @xmath39 .",
    "the factorization of vb amplitudes means the absence of correlation among vbs .",
    "it is indeed a strong assumption in the ansatz lda wave function , and very few works  @xcite to our best knowledge went beyond it until recently  @xcite .",
    "in fact , it is very natural to ask whether this assumption is correct or can be justified for realistic ( short - range ) heisenberg models .",
    "the boundary field theory approach allows us to elucidate analytically the correlation among vbs .",
    "we find that , whereas there are nontrivial correlations between vb occupation numbers even at large distances for @xmath6 , no correlations are asymptotically present in @xmath1 .",
    "the analytical prediction is then carefully verified via a numerical investigation with qmc simulations .",
    "this difference between @xmath6 and @xmath1 is another manifestation of different physics , in terms of the vb picture .",
    "our results for @xmath1 also justify the use of factorized wave functions of the lda type .",
    "the plan of the paper is the following . in sec .",
    "[ sec : def ] , we review the notion of valence bond occupation and correlation in a singlet wave function , giving a pedagogical derivation of a simple formula to effectively count the `` average '' number of vbs shared by two sites . in sec .",
    "[ sec : qmc ] , we present a method to measure these quantities numerically using qmc algorithms in the vb basis , and discuss in particular a specific improved algorithm for doing so .",
    "we then consider the case of @xmath1 heisenberg antiferromagnets using a non - linear @xmath2 model description in sec .",
    "[ sec : sigma ] , computing the vb length distribution as well as correlations .",
    "we furthermore compare the analytical predictions for the heisenberg model on the square and simple cubic lattices with qmc results . in sec .",
    "[ sec : bos ] , we study the more complicated case ( from the analytical point of view ) of @xmath6 with bosonization , showing the presence of correlations between vbs .",
    "the numerical computations in @xmath6 are simpler and allow for an exhaustive comparison with bosonization results .",
    "we further discuss the implication of our results in sec .",
    "[ sec : discussion ] and give a conclusion .",
    "consider a bipartite lattice , such that interactions in the hamiltonian eq .",
    "occur only between sublattice @xmath43 and sublattice @xmath44 .",
    "every bipartite valence bond state @xmath45 on such a lattice may be written as @xmath46 with @xmath47 on sublattice @xmath43 and @xmath48 on sublattice @xmath44 . in this notation the pairs @xmath49 represent precisely the bipartite valence bonds @xmath50 that form the state @xmath45 .",
    "we may then define the occupation number @xmath51 of a valence bond state as @xmath52 note , that this definition is rather formal and not always very useful . using the nel state @xmath53 an interesting alternative expression can be given in the form of a scalar product  @xcite : @xmath54 therein , the operator @xmath55 permutes the spins @xmath56 and @xmath57 within the nel state @xmath58 , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : occupation ] . notice that here we swap only a single spin ( @xmath59 ) , with @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "obviously , a valence bond @xmath49 in @xmath45 contributes a factor of @xmath62 when overlapped with @xmath63 and @xmath64 for the overlap with @xmath65 .",
    "hence , a valence bond connecting @xmath66 and @xmath67 must yield a factor of @xmath68 in eq .",
    ", as required . on the other hand , if there are valence bonds @xmath69 that connect @xmath66 and @xmath70 ( see fig . [",
    "fig : occupation ] ) , then the overlap with a triplet state vanishes @xmath71 , thus showing the equivalence of eq .   with eq .  .",
    "it is also straightforward to generalize eq .   to arbitrary singlet states  @xcite , which can always be expressed as ( albeit non - unique ) superpositions of bipartite vb states .",
    "writing a given singlet state @xmath72 as @xmath73 we can immediately generalize eq .   to the `` average '' vb occupation number for @xmath72 as @xmath74 even though the expression eq .   of the singlet state in terms of vb basis states",
    "is not unique , the vb occupation number eq .   is unique and well defined .",
    "since every vb basis state has the same overlap with the nel state , that is , @xmath75 , eq .",
    "is thus an `` average '' defined with respect to the coefficients @xmath76 themselves as the weight , and not to their squares @xmath77 .",
    "if some of the coefficients @xmath76 can be negative , the average eq .   may be ill defined . however , for the ground state of a bipartite quantum antiferromagnet , all the coefficients @xmath76 of the bipartite vb basis states are non - negative upon a proper choice of the overall phase factor , thanks to marshall s sign rule  @xcite .",
    "thus the average occupation number is always well - defined for such a ground state and satisfies @xmath78 .",
    "we emphasize that this only applies to bipartite valence bonds  @xcite .",
    "we define the single vb distribution function @xmath79 where two sites @xmath80 are separated by the vector @xmath81 .",
    "as we consider translationally invariant systems , @xmath82 should not depend on the choice of the site @xmath56 and is a function of the separation @xmath27 only .",
    "moreover , since the site @xmath56 must belong to one vb in any of the vb basis states , we find the sum rule @xmath83    this construction carries over immediately to the more general problem of simultaneous occupation numbers of multiple vbs .",
    "this can be done by choosing the set of sites @xmath66 and @xmath67 from each sublattice @xmath43 and @xmath44 , so that @xmath84",
    ". then , the `` number of vbs connecting @xmath66 and @xmath67 '' can be obtained as @xmath85 we note that , in this quantity , one no longer sees which sites precisely in @xmath66 and @xmath67 are connected to each other .",
    "for example , with the choice of @xmath86 and @xmath87 , we measure the simultaneous occupation of two vbs connecting the two sets .",
    "this may be interpreted as a sum of the occupation numbers for the two possible vb configurations @xmath88 and @xmath89 : @xmath90 we assert that , however , the occupation numbers for the individual vb configurations @xmath88 or @xmath89 are not well defined , and only the combination eq .   is uniquely defined .",
    "measuring valence bond occupation numbers or correlations is straightforward using eq .   if one has direct access to the wave function studied , such as within exact diagonalization or density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) calculations ( see ref .   for a more precise discussion and an example of such computations ) . since , however",
    ", we would like to study asymptotic , long - distance , properties of @xmath91 quantum antiferromagnets on large systems , these methods are not practical and we have to resort to stochastic qmc schemes .",
    "recent qmc state - of - the - art algorithms allow access to quantities in the valence bond language directly , by projecting out the ground state from some trial wave function .",
    "the trial wave function is usually chosen to be some special singlet state , such as the amplitude product state eq .",
    ", in order to achieve a significant reduction of computational cost  @xcite .    initially , two such schemes have been devised  @xcite , which are often referred to as single projection and double projection , respectively .",
    "the choice between these two schemes depends on the observable we want to measure .",
    "observables that commute with the hamiltonian can be measured within the single projection scheme , where some power @xmath92 of the hamiltonian @xmath93 is applied to a singlet trial state @xmath94 , @xmath95 herein , @xmath96 is a reference state , which is in principle arbitrary .",
    "however , it turns out that the nel state @xmath97 is a particularly good choice , as it has the same overlap with all singlet states .",
    "furthermore , @xmath98 is chosen to be the energy of the maximally polarized state @xmath99 , such that the projection reveals the ground state .",
    "notice , that such a scheme requires the ground state @xmath100 to be an eigenstate of the observable @xmath101 . in cases",
    "where this does not apply we have to carry out the double projection scheme , where the ground state projection occurs on both sides , @xmath102    valence bond occupation , eq .  , is a rather peculiar quantity , which measures properties of a given singlet state without being an observable .",
    "there are however different ways to generate related observables , which can be measured within double projection , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xmath103 unfortunately , it turns out that simulations converge rather badly when carrying out a double projection scheme with these observables .",
    "this is due to the fact that the appropriate estimator fluctuates exponentially , like the one for fidelity  @xcite and rnyi entropies  @xcite and in contrast to the energy estimator and other quantum mechanical observables  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , one notices that eq .",
    "looks very similar to the single projection expression eq .  , suggesting an implementation of this last scheme .",
    "indeed valence bond occupations ( through the related valence bond entanglement entropy  @xcite ) have already been measured with the single projection method using a local update algorithm . however , whereas for the double projection method very efficient loop updates are known  @xcite , this seems not to be the case for the single projection algorithm .",
    "we devote the next section to the description of such a method .      in order to carry out a single projection scheme ,",
    "we first rewrite expression eq .   and decompose the projection step as a sum over all possible contributing bond operator strings  @xcite @xmath104 every one of such operator strings is a product of bond singlet projectors , @xmath105 and @xmath106 is a multi - index that is summed over .",
    "notice , that the singlet projector @xmath107 on a given bond @xmath108 between sites @xmath16 and @xmath40 is related to the spin - spin interaction by @xmath109    with these notations and noting that the singlet trial state can be decomposed as a superposition of bipartite vb states @xmath110 , eq",
    ".   reads @xmath111 where @xmath97 is used as the reference state and the sums over @xmath112 and @xmath16 can be sampled stochastically . the way this is done",
    "is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : loopgraph ] , where an example bond operator string is explicitly written out .",
    "we use the following updates in order to sample the configuration space of different bond operator positions and valence bond states .    , residing on @xmath113 sites ( drawn vertically ) .",
    "herein , the singlet projectors ( red shaded squares ) are intentionally represented by two valence bonds .",
    "notice that the nel state on the left ( represented by black and white circles ) does not close the red ( dashed ) loops , whereas the blue ( continuous ) loops are closed intrinsically or by the valence bond state ( yellow shaded rectangle ) on the right .",
    "it is very straightforward to see , that the above expression can be evaluated by sutherland s",
    "@xcite overlap rule @xmath114 , where @xmath115 denotes the number of _ closed _ loops and @xmath116 the _ total _ number of valence bonds .",
    "here we count @xmath117 closed loops and @xmath118 valence bonds . ]    _ loop updates . _",
    "the loop updates  @xcite can be applied here with a slight modification , where loops passing through the nel state can not be flipped as in the double projection scheme  @xcite .",
    "this can be understood in two different ways : first , in the original scheme loop flips correspond to a flip of underlying spin configurations . whereas every valence bond and every singlet projector contains two such configurations ,",
    "the nel state is a single spin configuration .",
    "therefore , loops through the nel state exist only in one flavor and can not be flipped , in contrast to all other loops that exist in two flavors .",
    "another way of seeing this is by looking at the interpretation of sutherland s overlap rule  @xcite described in fig .",
    "[ fig : loopgraph ] , which deals only with closed loops but not with open ones .",
    "the loop algorithm aims precisely to mimic the varying contributions from the number of loops , by rewriting the term @xmath119 as a sum over different configurations .",
    "allowing each closed loop to take two different flavors generates exactly the required sum , whose stochastic sampling is computationally cheaper than counting the number of closed loops in a given overlap graph .    as a result",
    ", we keep the flavor of the red ( dashed ) loops in fig .",
    "[ fig : loopgraph ] constant , while we flip every blue ( continuous ) loop with a probability of @xmath120 between the two flavors . as in the original scheme  @xcite ,",
    "the different flavors represent a constraint for all other updates , which can be carried out in completely the same manner as in the original work .",
    "this includes _ operator updates _",
    ", which are used to move the bond operators into different positions of the overlap graph , as well as",
    "_ state updates _ , in order to sample the different valence bond states @xmath121 .",
    "self - optimized amplitude product states  @xcite turn out to be an advantageous choice for the single projection scheme as well , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : selftrial ] .",
    "we observe the same benefit for quantities such as eq .  .",
    "the probabilities of both such updates remain the same as for the double projection scheme  @xcite .",
    "sites versus the projection length @xmath92 in a single projection scheme .",
    "inset is a zoom on the low - energy part . for the self - optimized amplitude product state a significant convergence speed up",
    "is achieved ( error bars are smaller than the point sizes ) . ]    _ measurements . _ as the sampling weight @xmath122 is simply given by @xmath123 where the remaining factors keep constant during the simulation , the estimator is given by @xmath124 notice that the evaluation of this last expression is very simple , since the denominator is a constant and cancels most of the terms in the numerator . at the end",
    "one only has to determine the projected valence bond state @xmath125 , which can directly be read out of the overlap graph ( fig .",
    "[ fig : loopgraph ] ) in the following way : two sites form a valence bond in @xmath125 if they are linked together by an open loop in fig .",
    "[ fig : loopgraph ] . graphically , one just needs to start from any initial site on the nel state side and follow the open loop until it reaches a second site on the nel state : the initial and second sites are then coupled in a valence bond in @xmath125 .",
    "the operator @xmath101 has then to be inserted between this resulting valence bond state and the nel state itself .      in the case of valence bond occupations and valence bond correlations",
    "the operator @xmath101 is replaced by @xmath126 , which amounts to measure @xmath68 , if the projected valence bond state @xmath125 contains a valence bond @xmath49 , and @xmath127 if not . in practice , we measure a histogram of all valence bonds in @xmath125 , where we record the length @xmath128 of the valence bonds in case of valence bond occupations , or their lengths together with their separation distance in case of valence bond correlations .    whereas in one dimension it is possible to collect all data for every single valence bond , in higher dimensions we will restrict ourselves to measuring only specific configurations , as the amount of data would otherwise not be manageable .",
    "let us consider the statistics of vb occupations eq .  , in a field theory framework .",
    "we note that , when @xmath72 is a ground state , the average vb occupation number between sites @xmath56 and @xmath57 [ eq .  ]",
    "for example is given as @xmath129 where @xmath130 is the initial state , which is arbitrary as long as the overlap @xmath131 does not vanish .",
    "this can be interpreted as a correlation function @xmath132 , in the presence of a boundary described by the `` boundary state '' @xmath133  @xcite .",
    "the boundary condition in the field theory , which exactly matches the nel state @xmath133 as the boundary state , is unknown .",
    "nevertheless , the large - distance asymptotic behavior of boundary correlation functions is governed by fixed points of boundary renormalization group flow .",
    "those boundary fixed points correspond to conformally invariant boundary conditions .",
    "thus , as long as we are concerned with the large - distance asymptotic behavior of the vb distribution , we can replace the boundary condition with the conformally invariant one corresponding to the infrared fixed point for the boundary rg flow starting from @xmath134 .",
    "in general , tracking the boundary rg flow is a difficult problem .",
    "however , in the circumstances we will consider , we can find a natural candidate for such a boundary condition .",
    "this approach is generally applicable to the evaluation of the amplitude ( inner product ) between a reference state and the groundstate of a quantum many - body system in any dimension , at least in principle .",
    "we note that this approach indeed has been employed  @xcite in @xmath6 dimension , for problems closely related to ( but somewhat different from ) the present one . here",
    "we demonstrate that it is also useful in @xmath7 , and we will come back to @xmath6 in sec .  [",

    "the theory of free nambu - goldstone bosons   is asymptotically exact in the large - distance limit , in the symmetry - broken phase .",
    "while , in general , the direction of ordering in the reference nel state can be arbitrary in eq .  , in the present case we have to choose the reference nel state with the same ordering direction as in the ground state @xmath72 .",
    "otherwise , the overlap would vanish .",
    "thus , here we take the reference nel state with the ordering in the @xmath139 direction and use eq .  .",

    "for instance , the wave functions composed of the equal - weight linear combinations of nearest - neighbor valence bonds on the simple cubic or diamond lattices have been shown to sustain af long - range order  @xcite ( see also ref .  ) .",
    "however , their description is most certainly beyond the non - linear @xmath2 model approach , which probably can not describe the dipolar dimer correlations observed in these wave functions  @xcite .",
    "finally , we suggest several further investigations as possible extensions of our work . for one - dimensional systems , the bosonization analysis of sec .",
    "[ sec : bos ] carries over for the critical phase of the @xmath311 anisotropic spin chain . while the su(2 )",
    "symmetry is lost in this more general case , analytical predictions for mixed expectation values of the type @xmath312 [ such as in eq .  ]",
    "can be made and tested through , for instance , dmrg or qmc calculations . in general , the power - law exponent will depend on the anisotropy parameter through the compactification radius @xmath242 . another interesting problem would be to calculate analytically logarithmic corrections to the power - law decays of valence bond occupations and correlations in one dimension , which most certainly exist in the su(@xmath8 ) case .",
    "we note , however , that these are presumably small , hard to detect , effects as the qmc results are already very well described by the pure power - law decays .    in dimensions larger than 1",
    ", the non - linear @xmath2 model approach may also be used to describe the behavior of valence bond distributions and correlations at a quantum critical point between the antiferromagnet and a paramagnet , such as for a bilayer heisenberg model  @xcite .",
    "this could be useful in explaining and improving variational approaches based on valence bonds that aim to describe this quantum phase transition ( such as , _",
    "e.g. _ , ref .  ) . more generally , the current formalism based on the overlap eq .",
    "could be used with any effective field theory which describes a particular quantum phase or a quantum critical point of quantum antiferromagnets on bipartite lattices .",
    "finally , it would be very interesting to see whether an approach similar to the one developed here could be applied to describe the `` spinon detection '' procedure recently advocated by tang and sandvik  @xcite , which is also based on a valence bond description of a spin system with one or two unpaired spins ( _ i.e. _ , that do not belong to a valence bond ) .",
    "this is a more challenging case as one would first need to derive equations similar to eq .   or   for this situation .",
