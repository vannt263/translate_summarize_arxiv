    "a bykov cycle is a heteroclinic cycle between two hyperbolic saddle - foci of different morse index , where one of the connections is transverse and the other is structurally unstable  see figure [ orientations ] .",
    "there are two types of bykov cycle , depending on the way the flow turns around the two saddle - foci , that determine the _ chirality _ of the cycle . here",
    "we study the non - wandering dynamics in the neighbourhood of a bykov cycle where the two nodes have the same chirality .",
    "this is also studied in @xcite , and the case of different chirality is discussed in @xcite .",
    "a simplified version of the arguments presented here appears in @xcite .",
    "we assume here that the nodes have the same chirality : trajectories turn in the same direction around the connection .",
    "when the endpoints of a nearby trajectory are joined , the closed curve is always linked to the cycle . ]",
    "our starting point is a fully @xmath2-symmetric differential equation @xmath3 in the three - dimensional sphere @xmath4 with two saddle - foci that share all the invariant manifolds , of dimensions one and two , both contained in flow - invariant submanifolds that come from the symmetry .",
    "this forms an attracting heteroclinic network @xmath5 with a non - empty basin of attraction @xmath6 .",
    "we study the global transition of the dynamics from this fully symmetric system @xmath3 to a perturbed system @xmath7 , for a smooth one - parameter family that breaks part of the symmetry of the system . for small perturbations",
    "the set @xmath6 is still positively invariant .",
    "when @xmath8 , the one - dimensional connection persists , due to the remaining symmetry , and the two dimensional invariant manifolds intersect transversely , because of the symmetry breaking .",
    "this gives rise to a network @xmath9 , that consists of a union of bykov cycles , contained in @xmath6 .",
    "for partial symmetry - breaking perturbations of @xmath10 , we are interested in the dynamics in the maximal invariant set contained in @xmath6 .",
    "it contains , but does not coincide with , the suspension of horseshoes accumulating on @xmath9 described in @xcite . here",
    ", we show that close to the fully symmetric case it contains infinitely many heteroclinic tangencies . under an additional assumption ,",
    "we show that @xmath11 contains attracting limit cycles with long periods , coexisting with sets with positive entropy .",
    "homoclinic and heteroclinic bifurcations constitute the core of our understanding of complicated recurrent behaviour in dynamical systems .",
    "this starts with poincar on the late @xmath12 century , with major subsequent contributions by the schools of andronov , shilnikov , smale and palis .",
    "these results rely on a combination of analytical and geometrical tools used to understand the qualitative behaviour of the dynamics .",
    "heteroclinic cycles and networks are flow - invariant sets that can occur robustly in dynamical systems with symmetry , and are frequently associated with intermittent behaviour .",
    "the rigorous analysis of the dynamics associated to the structure of the nonwandering sets close to heteroclinic networks is still a challenge .",
    "we refer to @xcite for an overview of heteroclinic bifurcations and for details on the dynamics near different kinds of heteroclinic cycles and networks .",
    "bykov cycles have been found analytically in the lorenz model in @xcite and the nearby dynamics was studied by bykov in in @xcite .",
    "the point in parameter space where this cycle occurs is called a _",
    "t - point _ in @xcite .",
    "recently , there has been a renewal of interest in this type of heteroclinic bifurcation in the reversible @xcite , equivariant @xcite and conservative cases @xcite .",
    "see also @xcite .",
    "the transverse intersection of the two - dimensional invariant manifolds of the two equilibria implies that the set of trajectories that remain for all time in a small neighbourhood of the bykov cycle contains a locally - maximal hyperbolic set admitting a complete description in terms of symbolic dynamics , reminiscent of the results of shilnikov @xcite .",
    "an obstacle to the global symbolic description of these trajectories is the existence of tangencies that lead to the birth of stable periodic solutions , as described for the homoclinic case in @xcite .",
    "all dynamical models with quasi - stochastic attractors were found , either analytically or by computer simulations , to have tangencies of invariant manifolds @xcite . as a rule ,",
    "the sinks in a quasi - stochastic attractor have very long periods and narrow basins of attraction , and they are hard to observe in applied problems because of the presence of noise @xcite .    motivated by the analysis of lamb _ et al _ @xcite in the context of the michelson system ,",
    "bykov cycles have been considered by knobloch _",
    "et al _ @xcite . using the lin s method , the authors extend the analysis to cycles in spaces of arbitrary dimension , while restricting it to trajectories that remain for all time inside a small tubular neighbourhood of the cycle",
    "we also refer the reader to @xcite , where the authors consider non - elementary @xmath13-points in reversible differential equations .",
    "the leading eigenvalues at the two equilibria are real and the two - dimensional invariant manifolds meet tangentially .",
    "they found chaos in the unfolding of this @xmath13-point and bifurcations of periodic solutions in the process of annihilation of the shift dynamics .",
    "bykov cycles appear in many applications like the kuramoto - sivashinsky systems @xcite , magnetoconvection @xcite and travelling waves in reaction - diffusion dynamics @xcite .      for a bykov cycle in a 3-dimensional manifold",
    ", we say that the nodes have the same chirality if trajectories turn in the same direction around the common 1-dimensional invariant manifold .",
    "if they turn in opposite directions we say the nodes have different chirality .",
    "a more formal definition , using links , will be given in section  [ object ] below , showing this to be a global topological invariant of the connection that is well defined only in a 3-dimensional ambient space .",
    "these cycles have been studied by different authors who were not aware of the chirality , ignoring what looked like a very small and unimportant choice in local coordinates .",
    "for instance , bykov in @xcite addresses the case of different chirality without mentioning it explicitly  see a discussion in section 7 of @xcite .",
    "cycles with the same chirality are treated in @xcite and they occur naturally in reversible differential equations @xcite .",
    "dynamical features that are irrespective of chirality are described in @xcite .",
    "arbitrarily close to bykov cycles of any chirality there are suspended horseshoes and multi - pulse heteroclinic cycles  see theorem  [ teorema t - point switching ] below . around bykov cycles where the nodes have different chirality",
    ", heteroclinic tangencies occur generically in trajectories that remain close to the cycle for all time , as shown in @xcite .",
    "this is not the case when the nodes have the same chirality , but we show here that heteroclinic tangencies appear when the equations are approaching a more symmetric one .",
    "heteroclinic cycles involving equilibria are not a generic feature in differential equations , but they can be structurally stable in systems which are equivariant under the action of a symmetry group , due to the existence of flow - invariant subspaces @xcite .",
    "thus , perturbations that preserve the symmetry will not destroy the cycle .",
    "explicit examples of equivariant vector fields for which such cycles may be found are reported in @xcite .",
    "symmetry , exact or approximate , plays an essential role in the analysis of nonlinear physical phenomena @xcite .",
    "it is often incorporated in models either because it occurs approximately in the phenomena being modelled , or because its presence simplifies the analysis . since reality has not perfect symmetry , it is desirable to understand the dynamics that are being created under small symmetry breaking perturbations .",
    "symmetry plays two roles here .",
    "first , it creates flow - invariant subspaces where non - transverse heteroclinic connections are persistent , and hence bykov cycles are robust in this context .",
    "second , we use the proximity of the fully symmetric case to capture more global dynamics .",
    "symmetry constrains the geometry of the invariant manifolds of the saddle - foci and allows us some control of their relative positions , and we find infinitely many heteroclinic tangencies corresponding to trajectories that make an excursion away from the original cycle . for bykov cycles with the same chirality ,",
    "tangencies only take place near symmetry .    in the analysis of the annihilation of hyperbolic horseshoes associated to tangencies ,",
    "on the one hand , the symmetry adds complexity to the problem , because the analysis is not so standard as in @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", symmetry simplifies the analytic expression of the return map .",
    "it is clear that , for bykov cycles of the same chirality , the annihilation of hyperbolic horseshoes associated to tangencies only takes place near symmetry . in the fully asymmetric case , the general study seems to be analitically untreatable .",
    "many questions remain for future work .",
    "one obvious question is to assume different chirality of the nodes . due to the infinite number of reversals described in @xcite",
    ", other types of bifurcations may occur .",
    "the second question is to observe whether the non - wandering set may be reduced to a homoclinic class .",
    "we study the dynamics arising near a symmetric differential equation with a specific type of heteroclinic network .",
    "we show that when part of the symmetry is broken , the dynamics undergoes a global transition from hyperbolicity coexisting with infinitely many sinks , to the emergence of regular dynamics .",
    "we discuss the global bifurcations that occur as a parameter @xmath14 is used to break part of the symmetry .",
    "we complete our results by reducing our problem to a symmetric version of the structure of palis and takens result @xcite on homoclinic bifurcations .",
    "being close to symmetry adds complexity to the dynamics .",
    "chirality is an essential information in this problem .",
    "this article is organised as follows . in section  [ secobject ] , after some basic definitions , we describe precisely the object of study and we review some of our recent results related to it . in section  [ secstatement ] we state the main results of the present article .",
    "the coordinates and other notation used in the rest of the article are presented in section  [ localdyn ] , where we also obtain a geometrical description of the way the flow transforms a curve of initial conditions lying across the stable manifold of an equilibrium . in section [ sec tangency ] , we prove that there is a sequence of parameter values @xmath15 accumulating on @xmath16 such that the associated flow has heteroclinic tangencies . in section [ bif ] , we discuss the geometric constructions that describe the global dynamics near a bykov cycle as the parameter varies .",
    "we also describe the limit set that contains nontrivial hyperbolic subsets and we explain how the horseshoes disappear as the system regains full symmetry . we show that under an additional condition this creates infinitely many attracting periodic solutions .",
    "in the present section , after some preliminary definitions , we state the hypotheses for the system under study together with an overview of results obtained in @xcite , emphasizing those that will be used to explain the loss of hyperbolicity of the suspended horseshoes and the emergence of heteroclinic tangencies near the cycle .",
