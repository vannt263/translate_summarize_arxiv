    "mixtures of granular material composed of particles with different sizes , densities , or other material properties , exhibit a propensity to segregate when subject to external excitation such as vibration @xcite or shear @xcite .",
    "in particular , sheared granular mixtures differing in particle size present a common and challenging problem in many industrial contexts due to their tendency to form undesirable inhomogeneous particle configurations in tumblers , heaps , chutes , and silos @xcite . these sorted ( or unmixed )",
    "configurations resulting from size segregation occur also in natural phenomena such as debris flows @xcite .",
    "many studies have been devoted to understanding the underlying mechanisms and developing predictive frameworks for size segregation and pattern formation in polydisperse , sheared granular flow @xcite .",
    "these studies have identified several driving mechanisms for segregation , pattern formation , and mixing of bidisperse particles . in the dilute , energetic flow regime , where particles interact mainly through binary collisions ,",
    "the gradient of granular temperature alone can drive size segregation , which is successfully modeled by kinetic theory @xcite .",
    "in contrast , in the dense granular flow regime , particle geometry appears to be the primary driving mechanism . a percolation mechanism @xcite in which smaller particles are more likely than larger particles to fall through shear generated voids results in smaller particles moving downward while larger particles move upward , an effect that is characterized by a `` percolation '' velocity .",
    "segregation due to percolation , along with other effects including advection @xcite , convection by secondary flow @xcite , and collisional diffusion @xcite , determine particle distributions in bidisperse dense flow , sometimes leading to complex patterns @xcite .",
    "recently @xcite extended kinetic theory to predict segregation of binary granular mixtures in dense flow and obtained qualitative agreement with discrete element method ( dem ) simulations , but a first - principles based theory capable of quantitatively predicting segregation for dense flow is still lacking . in the meantime , a broad theoretical framework for segregation - driven pattern formation in dense flows is emerging @xcite .",
    "this framework incorporates advection due to mean flow , percolation - driven segregation , and diffusion due to random particle collisions , in a continuum transport equation for the volume concentration of species @xmath2 : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the velocity of species @xmath2 and @xmath5 is the collisional diffusion coefficient .",
    "although diffusion can be anisotropic @xcite , for simplicity here we assume that @xmath5 is isotropic .",
    "this approach has yielded results that qualitatively reproduce data from experiment and simulation in a variety of flows including plug @xcite , chute @xcite , and annular shear @xcite .",
    "however , quantitative agreement has , until this work , been harder to achieve .",
    "possible reasons for the lack of quantitative agreement in earlier work are the omission of one or more of advection , diffusion , or the dependence of percolation velocity on spatially varying shear rate @xcite .    in this work",
    "we include all three mechanisms and examine their effects on segregation in a granular flow with non - trivial spatial variation : the quasi - two - dimensional ( quasi-2d ) bounded heap ( figure [ geometry](a ) ) . in quasi-2d bounded heap flow , granular material is fed by gravity at one end of the heap , flows down hill in a thin flowing layer at the free surface , and is ultimately constrained by the downstream endwall . in the steady filling stage ( after the heap reaches the downstream bounding endwall ) for continuous ( non - avalanching ) flow , the free surface rises steadily and uniformly along the length of the heap with rise velocity @xmath6 , and the local flow rate decreases linearly along the streamwise direction to zero at the downstream endwall .",
    "we use a coordinate system rising at @xmath6 with its @xmath7axis rotated clockwise from vertical by the dynamic angle of repose , @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the streamwise direction , @xmath10 is the spanwise direction , @xmath11 is the free surface normal direction , and the origin is at the intersection of the free surface and the right edge of the inlet feed stream ( dashed line extending from the @xmath7axis in ( a ) ) .",
    "we denote the velocity components as ( @xmath12 ) in the @xmath13 , and @xmath7direction , respectively .",
    "the decrease of local flow rate induces a gradient of @xmath14 in the @xmath15direction .",
    "in addition , @xmath14 and @xmath16 decrease from maximum values at the free surface to zero at the bottom of the flowing layer in the @xmath7direction @xcite .",
    "when a bidisperse mixture falls onto a heap and flows downhill , small particles fall into voids between large particles and sink to the bottom of the flowing layer , while large particles rise to the free surface .",
    "as the heap rises , small particles drop out of the flowing layer sooner and remain in the upstream region of the heap , while large particles are advected to the downstream region of the heap .",
    "this results in a separation of large and small particles in the streamwise direction @xcite , which is also similar to segregation patterns in avalanche flows @xcite .     with dynamic repose angle , @xmath8 .",
    "granular material is fed onto the heap at a volumetric feed rate @xmath17 , and the heap rises with velocity @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the gap thickness between the front and back walls .",
    "( b ) sketch ( not to scale ) of the flowing layer in a rotated coordinate system ( see text ) .",
    "we model the entire flowing layer from the granular material inlet to the downstream end of the flowing layer where the flow vanishes .",
    "particles enter the flowing layer at the left boundary ( the inlet ) after leaving the feed zone and exit the flowing layer at the bottom boundary at uniform normal velocity . @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the thickness and length of the flowing layer , respectively . @xmath14 and @xmath16 are velocity components in the @xmath15 and @xmath7directions , respectively . ]    there have been several attempts at modeling size segregation in bounded heap flow .",
    "@xcite proposed a screening layer model in which the flowing layer is divided into three sublayers  large particles , mixed particles , and small particles  from the free surface to the bottom of the flowing layer . invoking mass conservation in each sublayer and accounting for particle migration between adjacent layers , they derived a model that qualitatively predicted the local particle concentration of each species with several arbitrarily adjustable fitting parameters ( e.g.  the velocity ratio of different sublayers and the penetration rate of segregating components in @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite modeled particle exchange between the flowing layer and the static bed using a set of collision functions that are _ a priori _ unknown and incorporated these collision functions into the mass conservation equations of each species .",
    "this model predicts the local particle concentrations qualitatively , but requires fitting parameters without clear physical interpretation ( e.g.  the characteristic length of segregation in @xcite from which boutreux _ et al . _",
    "s model was adopted ) .",
    "the necessity of fitting parameters and the lack of quantitative agreement with experiments in both models are likely due to the oversimplification of flow kinematics .    here , we present a model for predicting local particle distributions in quasi-2d bounded heap flow using a general scalar transport equation   and incorporating the effects of kinematics through advection , segregation , and diffusion .",
    "the theoretical predictions match quantitatively with both experiments and simulations .",
    "compared to the models by @xcite and boutreux _",
    "et al_. @xcite , our model relies on parameters characterizing the kinematics of the flow instead of arbitrarily adjustable parameters .",
    "the model demonstrates that the particle configuration is determined by the interplay of advection , segregation , and diffusion , which can be characterized by two dimensionless parameters , @xmath0 and @xmath1 , that depend only on physical on control parameters ( feed rate , particle sizes , and system size ) and kinematic parameters ( diffusion coefficient , flowing layer depth , and percolation velocity ) , which have a clear physical meaning and are determined from dem simulations .",
    "the framework developed here for bounded heap flow can be generalized to other flow geometries with non - trivial flow kinematics .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in  [ simulation ] , the transport equation for quasi-2d bounded heap flow is developed and dem simulations are used to obtain the values and expressions used in the model , including the mean velocity profiles , the percolation velocity , and the diffusion coefficient . in  [ govern ] , a dimensionless governing equation is developed , which yields the two dimensionless control parameters , @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "the theoretical predictions are compared with both dem simulations and experiments in  [ results ] , and a systematic parametric study is carried out in  [ discussion ] to elucidate how @xmath0 and @xmath1 control particle configurations in the heap through the underlying physics .",
    "concluding remarks are provided in  [ conclusion ] .",
    "to model segregation of bidisperse granular material in bounded heap flow , we apply the transport equation to the flowing layer ( see figure [ geometry](b ) ) since this is where segregation occurs .",
