    "the _ phase time _ is the time between the instant in which the peak of the incoming wave packet reaches the barrier and the instant in which the peak of the transmitted wave packet appears in the free region after the barrier . by using the stationary phase method",
    ", hartman@xcite observed that the tunneling thorugh opaque barriers is independent of the barrier length .",
    "this surprising result is due to the fact that the stationary phase method was applied without considering the _ filter effect_. in the study presented in ref.@xcite and briefly summarized in section iii , the integral of the transmitted wave function for dirac particles was calculated taking into account the filter effect .",

    " superluminality \" for the phase time is seen for relativistic potentials .",

    "the numerical data also present a still more surprising result . in fig3 , it is clear that superluminal tunneling velocities appear not only in the opaque limit ( very wide barriers ) but also for _ thinner _ barriers .",
    "this stimulated a numerical analysis in which the transmission across free space , see fig.4.a , and through potential barriers of different widths , see fig.4.b - c , is compared .",
    "superluminal transmissions appear .",
    "this apparent paradox clearly shows that the phase time is _ not _ the correct tunneling time definition .",
    "the peak of the transmitted wave packet could be _ not _ related to the peak of the incoming one . when a wave packet with a given momentum distribution strikes a barrier , the transmitted wave packet will exhibit a distribution displaced to higher momenta .",
    "consequently , the transmitted packet moves faster that the incident packet@xcite . observing that the transmitted coefficient only depends on the barrier width and not on its position , see eq.([trac ] ) ,",
    "the transit time does not change if we displace the barrier from ( @xmath15,@xmath5 ) to ( @xmath118,@xmath119 ) .",
    "this means , for example , that the time in which the peak of the transmitted wave packet reaches the point @xmath120 in fig.4 is the same for barriers located at @xmath6 or at @xmath121 . due to the fact that for @xmath121 the free region after the barrier is reduced",
    ", the outgoing peak can not be related to the incoming one .",
    "once again the _ filter effect _ explains the apparent paradox .",
    "only higher momenta in the incoming packet contribute to tunneling .    in view of the last comment",
    ", it could be interesting to review the results reported in this paper in terms of other definitions of tunneling times .",
    "the _ dwell time_@xcite is defined as the ratio of the number of particles within the barrier to the incident flux .",
    "the average of the time spent by the particle inside the barrier obviously does not distinguish whether , at the end of the process , the particles are reflected or transmitted . due to the fact that the effects shown in this paper imply a very small transmission , the average dwell time should be related , in this case , to the well - known delay time of quantum mechanics@xcite ( obviously using the dirac formalism it should contain the appropriated relativistic corrections ) .",
    "a more complicated analysis is required if we introduce a time - modulated barrier@xcite , @xmath122 . in non - relativistic quantum mechanics , the crossover between small and large frequencies yields to the _ traversal time_. the study of emitted and absorbed modulation quanta",
    "should be investigated in terms of relativistic transmitted particles . in this spirit , it could be also interesting to consider relativistic corrections to larmor precession when @xmath123-polarized particles which move in the @xmath52-direction encounter in the barrier a small magnetic field pointing in the @xmath124-direction .",
    "the precession angle determines the time spent by the particle in the barrier@xcite . nevertheless , in recent papers",
    ", it was observed , for relativistic particles , the phenomenon of spin@xcite and helicity@xcite flip for planar motion .",
    "thus , it could be very interesting to investigate , for dirac planar motion , possible consequences in the spin and helicity flip related to transversal times .",
    "we conclude this discussion with our last suggestions on possible future studies in which the numerical analysis done in this paper could find possible applications . in recent papers@xcite ,",
    "the tunneling time problem for non - relativistic rectangular potential barriers was analyzed in terms of the _ tempus _",
    "operator@xcite , @xmath125 .",
    "the tunneling time is expressed by an energy average of the phase time and there is no fundamental problem with the hartman effect@xcite .",
    "this conclusion is similar to our analysis for non - relativistic potentials .",
    "in@xcite , it was shown that when the energy of the incoming particle is near to a resonance pole of the tunneling barrier , an intrinsic tunneling time does exist , but when the energy is near the branch point there is no intrinsic tunneling time .",
    "it could be interesting to calculate the expectation value of the time operator , the resonance poles and the branch points for relativistic particles . observing that the local value of the _ tempus _ operator gives a complex time for a particle to traverse a barrier",
