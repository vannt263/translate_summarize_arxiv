    "the two bhs start experiencing their own gravitational interaction , binding in a bh binary ( bhb ) .",
    "observing bhbs is challenging , since they can not be spatially resolved in optical and x - ray .",
    "the only spatially resolved bhb candidate to date is hosted by the elliptical galaxy 0402 + 379 @xcite .",
    "the two flat - spectrum radio sources , corresponding to the two components of the candidate bhb , have a projected separation of @xmath3 pc . at the distance of 0402 + 379 ( @xmath4 )",
    "this corresponds to few milliarcsec , an angular scale that can be probed only through radio interferometry .",
    "a second bhb candidate is the bl lac oj287 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "it shows a @xmath5 yr modulation in its light curve , that has been interpreted as related to the orbital period of a bhb lurking in the nucleus of the agn .",
    "all the other bhb candidates discussed to date have been identified by studying their optical and near  infrared spectra . in a bhb scenario ,",
    "the broad lines ( bls ) emitted by gas bound to each bh may be red- or blue - shifted with respect to their host galaxy redshift , as a consequence of the keplerian motion of the binary @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the bl region of each bh can be perturbed and stripped by the gravitational potential of the companion , resulting in peculiar flux ratios between bls with different ionization potential @xcite .",
    "this spectroscopic approach does not suffer any angular resolution limitations : actually , the closer ( and more massive ) the binary is , the more shifted / deformed the bls are .",
    "thanks to the existence of large spectroscopic surveys , such as the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) , a large region of the sky can be probed . up to date five",
    "spectroscopically identified candidates have been presented : j0927 + 2943 @xcite , j1536 + 0441 @xcite , j1050 + 3456 @xcite , 4c+22.25 ( j1000 + 2233 in this paper , * ? ? ?",

    "such a small number of objects is marginally compatible with the theoretically predicted number of sub - parsec bhbs at @xmath6 ( 510 , given the merger rate and under reasonable assumptions on the binary lifetime and observability ; see * ? ? ?",
    "the spectroscopic approach has an obvious drawback : a peculiar spectrum does not guarantee the presence of a bhb in the nucleus of the host . as an example",
    ", an unobscured bhb with both bhs active could resamble the spectrum of a double peaked emitter ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , where broad double  peaked lines are emitted because of the almost edge  on , disk  like structure of the bl region of a single bh .",
    "a binary with a single accreting bh would show a single shifted bl .",
    "if the shift corresponds to a relatively small velocity along the line of sight ( @xmath7 km s@xmath8 ) , the same signature could be emitted by a remnant of a binary coalescence , recoiling because of anisotropic gravitational wave emission ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "finally , both the cases can be reproduced by a chance superposition of two agn ( or an agn - galaxy superposition ) within the angular resolution of the used spectrograph ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the simplest way to discriminate between these scenarios and the bhb hypothesis would be to look for a periodic oscillation of the bl shifts around the host galaxy redshift .",
    "however , the orbital period of the binary could be too long to be easily observed @xcite . for these reasons",
    "other possible explanations have been proposed for all the bhb candidates discussed in literature .    to overcome the paucity of bhb candidates and the uncertainties related to their interpretation",

    "+ _ observationally _ all the bhb candidates lurking in large spectroscopic catalogue must be identified , through a meticulous study of all the possible spectra , in order to allow for follow - up studies on a significant sample of objects .    in this paper",
    "we explore the second path , describing the results we obtained from a comprehensive search of bhbs in the sdss dr7 .",
    "the code we use , described in section  [ sec_method ] , automatically detects sources with a spectrum consistent with a bhb , a double peaked emitter , a superposition , or a recoiling bh .",
    "we present all the peculiar objects we find in section  [ sec_results ] , where , for each object , we compare our results with previous findings available in the literature .",
    "conclusions are drawn in section [ sec_conclusions ] . throughout the paper",
    "we will assume a standard cosmology with @xmath9 km s@xmath8 mpc@xmath8 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "in this study we perform an automatic and systematic search for bhb candidates in sdss catalogue , looking for composite spectra of two sources with a velocity difference up to 30000 km s@xmath8 . more specifically , we look for the presence of two sets of emission lines ( one broad and one narrow ) with a small separation between them , caused by the keplerian rotation of one component of the binary system . for this purpose",
    "we use the method described in @xcite . as a first step",
    "we extract a small set of components that can sufficiently reconstruct the sdss qso spectra by using hmf ( heteroscedastic matrix factorization or hmf ) , a bilinear model optimized with probabilistically justified weighted least - squares objective function , analogous to principal components analysis but making use of the observational noise model .",
    "the method uses a subset of data at rest - frame wavelengths , described in detail in section  ( [ sample ] ) , as a training set to define the set of basis functions that minimize the scalar @xmath12 :    @xmath13 ^ 2}{\\sigma^2_{ij } } \\nonumber\\\\   + \\epsilon\\,\\sum_{k=1}^k \\sum_{\\ell=2}^{m }   \\left[g_{k\\ell}-g_{k(\\ell-1)}\\right]^2 \\quad , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where the first term corresponds to the total @xmath14 of the fit of the training data points @xmath15 with errors @xmath16 , by a set of k components @xmath17 and coefficients @xmath18 , over all the n spectra and the m pixels of the training set .",
    "the second term corresponds to a smoothing prior or regularization that prefers small pixel - to - pixel variations in each resulting component .",
    "the strength of the smoothing is set by the scalar @xmath19 .",
    "an iterative procedure is used to minimize @xmath12 . in each step",
    ", we fix @xmath17 and estimate the optimal @xmath18 , and then hold the @xmath18 fixed and estimate the optimal @xmath17 .",
    "the procedure is repeated until the solution converges .",
    "we initialize the fitting with the output of pca when applied to an extended set of training spectra .",
    "we then use the resulting set of components to fit each observed spectrum at the redshift provided by sdss .",
    "after that , we repeat the fitting using _ two _ sets of components at different redshifts . here",
    "one set is assumed to be at the sdss redshift , while the second is free to vary over a broad range of @xmath20 , corresponding to velocity differences up to 30000 km s@xmath8 .",
    "if a second redshift system is present , we expect the fit to significantly improve when we add the second set of components .",
    "this procedure has already been proven to successfully identify four of the known bhb candidates ( j0927 + 2943 , j1536 + 0441 , j1050 + 3456 , and j1000 + 2233 , see * ? ? ? * ) with an estimate of the velocity shifts between the two sets of lines consistent with what obtained in previous studies .",
    "to train the hmf we use the same training set of quasar spectra that was used in @xcite .",
    "the sample consists of spectra in the redshift range 0.1 - 1.5 .",
    "however , since we are mainly interested in detecting shifts between the narrow and the broad emission lines in the qso spectra , we check if our method is more sensitive in detecting interesting objects when one of the two sets of components used to fit each spectrum is representative of spectra with only narrow emission lines . to define components that include only narrow lines , we use galaxy spectra for the training of the hmf .",
    "the galaxy sample consists of spectra classified spectroscopically as galaxies in sdss with s / n@xmath2120 and ew of the and lines larger than 20 ( 10856 spectra ) .",
    "all spectra used for the training and the application of the method are derived from the 7th data release ( dr7 ) of sdss .",
    "pixels with any of the flags : sp_mask_fullreject , sp_mask_brightsky , sp_mask_nodata , sp_mask_nosky or pixels that correspond to zero noise were treated as masked .",
    "all the spectra and their noise were moved to the rest - frame ( assuming @xmath22 ) , resulting in spectra with different spectral coverage .",
    "however , both hmf and pca ( the output of which was used as an initialization to the hmf ) require common wavelengths for all the training spectra .",
    "the common wavelength range was defined by the pixels that included information for at least 10 spectra of each type ( i.e. galaxies or qsos ) .",
    "the final wavelength coverage was 1522.299 - 8352.183    for the qsos and 3044.388 - 9193.905    for the galaxies , corresponding to 7394 and 4801 pixels respectively .",
    "as a last step before the application of the method all spectra were interpolated to common wavelengths selected for each type of source using cubic splines .",
    "the selected wavelengths are uniformly distributed in log space as in the case of the original sdss wavelengths . for the resulting spectra we interpolated linearly the values of the masked pixels .",
    "pca was performed separately for the qso and the galaxy sample , using a number of spectra equal to the number of pixels selected for each source .",
    "the training spectra were first projected into a subspace orthogonal to the mean spectrum of the data set and the flux in each spectral bin was divided with the rms of the noise in that bin , for all the non - masked pixels in the training sample .",
    "the pca results were used as an initialization to the hmf .",
    "the method was run for a subset of approximately 1000 spectra of each type for a different number of components and for 16 iterations , until convergency .",
    "this test was also performed for four different values ( 1,3,10 and 30 ) of the smoothing scalar @xmath19 . to perform a simple cross validation ,",
    "the resulting components were also used to fit another subset of 1000 test spectra for each type . based on these tests",
    ", we decided to use 14 and 7 components for the qsos and galaxies and @xmath19 values of 10 and 1 respectively .",
    "those numbers were also defined by using the spectra of the known bhb candidates and testing the ability of the components to detect them .",
    "we apply our newly developed fitting scheme to all the 54586 qso spectra of sdss in the redshift range 0.1 - 1.5 .",
    "additionally , since one of the known bhb candidates ( 4c+22.25 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is classified spectroscopically as a galaxy in the sdss catalog , we also applied the method to objects with redshift from 0.2 - 1.5 , that are classified by sdss as galaxies and have fiber magnitudes that correspond to @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "we note that the majority of these sources ( 3518 out of 3929 ) were targeted as quasar candidates by sdss .",
    "for each spectrum the fitting was performed for all the combinations of the extracted qso and galaxy components : i ) two qso components for both the spectral components ( hereafter qso - qso ) , ii ) a qso component for the spectrum at the sdss redshift and a galaxy components at the second redshift ( qso - galaxy ) and iii ) the opposite of case ( ii ) ( galaxy - qso ) . out of the 175,545 fitting results we assigned priority based on the following criteria :    * the fit significantly improves by adding a set of components at a second redshift",
    ", i.e. it corresponds to large @xmath14 difference .",
    "the threshold was set based on the values extracted for the four known candidates and by visual inspection of the fitting results for various @xmath14 difference values .",
    "* the peaks of the @xmath14 difference do not correspond to fits with unphysical properties ( e.g. negative emission lines ) .",
    "negative residuals are common when fitting the spectra with one set of components",
    ". their strength , and therefore their impact in the results , can vary from very weak features usually caused by details in the continuum fitting and the presence of noise , to very strong features caused by poor fitting of emission lines . to exclude the latter cases ( but not the former ) from our final sample we examine only peaks of the @xmath14 differences that correspond to positive differences between the 99.5% and the 0.5% quartiles of the distribution of fluxes per pixel in each fitted spectrum ( for each set of components ) . *",
    "the peaks of the @xmath14 difference correspond to a difference in redshift between the two sources larger than 0.01 .    in the case",
    "that galaxy - qso fitting was performed to the spectra , there was a lot of contamination to our results due to two additional reasons :    * in most of the cases the fitting of the narrow emission lines at the sdss redshift by the galaxy components was resulting to unusual residuals of the broad lines , ( e.g. in the case that no significant shift was present between the nls and bls ) , which were then fitted very poorly by the second set of components . to exclude these objects from our final sample we also measured the @xmath14 value of the fit by the second set of components restricted to an area of 500   around the line and 200   around the line .",
    "peaks corresponding to a very large value of @xmath14 at the areas of the bls were excluded .",
    "* in all cases the fitting of a qso spectrum by the galaxy components will improve significantly when the qso components are added to the fit .",
    "that is due to the fit of the broad emission lines by the second set of components . to make sure that the observed improvements were not only caused by this , we re - perform the fitting of the spectrum by two sets of qso components , at the redshifts suggested by the galaxy - qso fitting .",
    "the fits of the spectra selected using the above criteria were visually inspected independently by two of the authors ( pt and rd ) .",
    "the fitting results showed that there is a lot of contamination , e.g. from obvious double peaked emitters ( dpes ) , misclassified objects in sdss or spectra with wrong estimated redshifts . by excluding all those cases ,",
    "the most interesting objects were identified . in figure [ f1 ]",
    "we provide an example of the fitting output for one of those sources .",
    "the objects selected here are presented in detail in the following section .",
    "we should point out that all the objects selected for their interesting features are at redshifts below 0.8 . for higher redshifts the line",
    "is not included in the spectra and the differences in the fitting are detected mainly based on the line , which in most of the cases is very faint or not well detected .",
    "for this reason no reliable information for the narrow emission lines are included in most of the spectra at higher redshifts .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     our selection produced a list of 32 candidates of particular relevance ( see table [ tab_candidates ] ) . for each target , we re - analyzed the sdss spectrum , modeling it with a power law for the qso continuum emission , a host galaxy template at the redshift of the nls and a template of the iron complex , as described in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we fitted the broad components of , and with 2 gaussian functions at the same peak .",
    "this fitting approach aims to better constrain the peak wavelength , and is not meant to reproduce the line profile in detail .",
    "narrow lines are masked when fitting the broad component ; by construction of our sample , there is a velocity offset between bls and nls .",
    "this simplifies the measurement of the peak wavelengths of the two components .",
    "peak wavelengths are then converted into velocity shifts : @xmath27 continuum - subtracted velocity plots of all the interesting targets are shown in figure [ fig_all ] .    a rough classification scheme was set according to : 1 ) the magnitude of the velocity shift , in particular when comparing and balmer lines ; 2 ) the presence of strong asymmetries in the line profiles ; 3 ) the occurrence of secondary bumps or peaks ; 4 ) additional information from other emission lines or from the sdss images .",
    "we define five classes of objects , namely ; @xmath28 ) * black hole binary candidates * , which are expected to show similar velocity shifts for all the bls , and a variety of line profiles ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "@xmath29 ) quasars with * asymmetric line profiles * , with small ( @xmath30 ) shifts of bl peaks .",
    "these features are observed in some `` normal '' type - i agn , and they are possibly related to asymmetries in the bl region ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "they may also be associated to a velocity - dependent balmer decrement of broad lines .",
    "@xmath31 ) * double peaked emitters * ( dpes ) , characterized by symmetric features in line profiles ( e.g. , a secondary peak in the red wing of the line , at the opposite velocity with respect to a blue - shifted peak ) .",
    "another property of dpes is that different lines ( in particular low- and high - ionization lines ) may show very different shapes and shifts @xcite .",

    "this quasar has few spectral features in common with the bhb candidate j0927 + 2943 , with a set of broad and narrow emission lines shifted with respect to a brighter set of narrow emission lines .",
    "however , the velocity shift is extremely high ( @xmath100 ) . as a consequence , this object",
    "can not be explained in terms of a recoiling bh , since the maximum kick velocity has been constrained with fully gr simulations to be @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "a natural explanation can be a superposition of an agn and a galaxy within a galaxy cluster .",
