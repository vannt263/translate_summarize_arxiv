    "the purpose of the work we present here is to obtain a model for the membrane potential of a single cell which is reasonably realistic , and yet so simple that it can be used in practice to simulate numerically single cells or several coupled cells . for simplicity ,",
    "experimentally observed currents ( boyett et al . 1993 ) are omitted if they seem too small to have a significant influence on the intracellular ion concentration , or at least too small to change the dynamics of the cell . on the other hand",
    ", we try to make the theory realistic by using equations that are compatible with , or can be derived from , basic physical principles .",
    "it is a basic assumption of most models ( wilders 1993 ) for the electrical activity of cells that only the motion of positive ions , and specifically those of potassium , calcium and sodium , influence the membrane potential .",
    "this assumption is usually expressed as a differential equation for the time dependence of the potential .",
    "we observe that this differential equation can be integrated exactly , and argue that the integration constant is given by the requirement that the potential is zero when the ion concentrations on both sides of the membrane are equal , as the density of negative charge happens to be the same on both sides .",
    "then it follows that the potential is directly proportional to the excess number of positive ions inside the cell , a formula which is nothing but the one for an electric capacitance that follows from gauss s law in electrostatics .",
    "we derive equations for ionic currents flowing through channels , exchangers and electrogenic pumps .",
    "these are based on the boltzmann distribution law ( boltzmann 1868 ) , which states that a particle in thermal equilibrium spends less time in states of higher energy than in states of lower energy , the markov assumption ( markov 1906 ) which says that the transition probabilities of a stochastic system ( of markov type ) is only dependent on its present state , and the principle of detailed balance ( onsager 1931 ) which says that the microscopic laws of physics are invariant with respect to the reversal of time .",
    "our equations were inspired by ehrenstein and lecar s model of channel gating ( 1977 ) , nonner and eisenberg s model for channel current ( 1998 ) , mullins model of the @xmath0 exchanger ( 1977 ) , and chapman s model of the @xmath1 pump ( 1978 ) .",
    "in particular the book of lorin john mullins ( 1981 ) `` ion transport in heart '' has been a major source of inspiration for us .",
    "the theory is illustrated with a simple model of spontaneously active cells in the rabbit sinoatrial node .",
    "the observable parameters in the model are based on the experiments of shibasaki ( 1987 ) , hagiwara et al .",
    "( 1988 ) , muramatsu et al .",
    "( 1996 ) and sakai et al .",
    "the non  observable parameters in the model are determined numerically , in the same way as in an earlier study ( endresen 1997a ) , by comparing the action potentials generated by the model with the shape of the action potentials recorded by baruscotti et al .",
    "( 1996 ) .    by using an algebraic equation for the potential in place of the standard differential equation ,",
    "as mentioned above , we obtain a model which is stable against a slow drift of the intracellular ion concentrations , sometimes seen in other models .",
    "furthermore , by fixing the integration constant for the voltage we obtain from the model a prediction of the steady state ion concentrations in the cell .",
    "it is even possible to predict these steady state concentrations by starting with an initial state having equal concentrations inside and outside the cell , and integrating the equations of motion over a long time interval .    from the equations of motion we obtain an equation that explicitly demonstrates the energy balance in the process of moving ions in and out of the cell .",
    "the energy to make the cell function comes from breakdown of atp that runs the @xmath2 pump .",
    "part of this free ( or useful ) energy is dissipated while the rest enters the cell . in the cell",
    "some of this energy is used to create a potential energy that depends upon the ionic concentrations in the cell , while the rest is dissipated by the currents in the ionic channels and the @xmath0 exchanger .",
    "this potential energy function is thus such that the work associated with ionic currents balances exactly the change in potential energy . in a numerical integration of the differential equations",
    "one may compute separately the work and potential energy , comparing the two in order to check ( and maybe control ) the accuracy of the numerical integration . in our long time integration",
    "we observe indeed a balance between work and change in cell membrane potential energy .",
    "there are two basic principles behind the average motion of particles .",
    "the first is diffusion , which is general ; the second applies only to charged particles such as ions in solutions .",
    "simple diffusion is described by the empirical law of fick ( 1855 ) , @xmath3 \\;,\\ ] ]    where @xmath4 is the ionic flux , @xmath5 $ ] the concentration of ions and @xmath6 the ratio of the velocity to the force acting on a particle , known as the mobility .",

    "there is reason to ask whether the linear voltage profile @xmath71 can be a reasonable approximation in the presence of a pore .",

    "they indeed find that only part of the voltage drop is across the pore ( something like half of it ) . in their numerical simulations the voltage in the pore",

    "two of the differential equations in the model have almost identical but opposite dynamics .",

    "this computational saving will be irrelevant for the computation of one action potential , but is important in an extended model with thousands of coupled cell , or in a long  time integration of the one cell model .",
    "the relative amplitude of the ionic currents that drive membrane depolarization during diastole is still a matter of debate .",
    "difrancesco ( 1993 ) argues that the hyperpolarization activated current ( @xmath191 ) is the only current that can generate and control the slow depolarization of pacemaker cells .",
    "the @xmath191 current is normally carried by @xmath111 and @xmath149 .",
    "guo et al .",
    "( 1995a ; 1995b ; 1996 ) reported another current , called the sustained inward current @xmath190 , where the major charge carrier is believed to be @xmath111 .",
    "also a @xmath223 `` window '' current has been observed in rabbit sinoatrial node cells ( denyer & brown 1990 ) .",
    "it is possible that any one of these currents , or a combination of them , is responsible for membrane depolarization during diastole .",
    "however , the estimates of the net membrane current during diastole is so imprecise ( zaza et al .",
    "1997 ) , that we could not form a judgment on the question .    during diastole",
    "the electrochemical driving forces produce outward @xmath149 currents and inward @xmath111 and @xmath223 currents , and the driving force for @xmath223 is much larger than that for @xmath111 .",
    "these findings implies that a significant background influx of @xmath223 is possible during diastole , and that this current might be responsible for the pacemaker activity in sinoatrial node cells .",
    "we denote the conductance for this current @xmath224 , and modify ( [ eq33 ] ) combined with ( [ eq85 ] ) to read as @xmath225\\,\\sinh\\left(\\frac{v - v_{\\rm ca}}{v_t}\\right ) \\;,\\ ] ]    with @xmath226 . in our model @xmath224",

    "( 1995b ) , it is indeed possible that the sustained inward current @xmath190 may largely replace the role of the @xmath223 currents , assumed here and in previous studies ( wilders 1993 ) .      the density of ionic channels , exchangers and pumps ( i.e. @xmath227 , @xmath224",
    ", @xmath100 , @xmath95 , @xmath228 and @xmath229 ) can vary significantly from cell to cell . in order to reproduce recorded action potentials ( fig .",

    "more details of the method are given in ( endresen 1997a ) .",
    "many different combinations of @xmath99 , @xmath224 , @xmath100 , @xmath230 , @xmath228 , and @xmath229 resulted in good approximations to the experimentally recorded waveform , from which we conclude that different cells can produce the same action potential although they have different mixtures of ionic channels , exchangers , and pumps .",
    "the five differential equations in the model were solved numerically using a fifth  order runge ",
    "kutta method with variable steplength .",
    "more details are given in ( endresen 1997b ) .",
    "we computed the work @xmath231 , defined as minus the integral on the right hand side of ( [ eq70 ] ) , to check that the equation @xmath232 was satisfied numerically .",
    "this could also be used for varying the steplength in an efficient way ( marthinsen et al .",
    "1997 ) , since the solution of our differential equations must satisfy this constraint .",

    "1 ( a ) the modeled action potential is shown together with the experimental curve of baruscotti et al .",
    "the curves are identical in shape , but we adjusted the modeled curve somewhat ( we multiplied the voltage amplitude by a factor 1.25 , without changing the minimum value ) to obtain the same voltage amplitudes . at present",
    "it is not clear to us which mechanism is needed in the model in order to avoid this factor .",
    "1 ( b ) shows the five membrane currents in the model , @xmath180 , @xmath139 , @xmath137 , @xmath184 , and @xmath181 .",
    "2 shows the spontaneous action potentials together with the intracellular ionic concentrations and the osmotic pressure across the cell membrane .",
    "these computations used the initial conditions stated in table [ table4 ] .",
    "cells must generate their membrane potential by actively transporting ions against the respective concentration gradients . to examine this process in our model , we ran a simulation starting with equal intracellular and extracellular ionic concentrations : @xmath233_{\\rm i } } = { [ \\rm k]_{\\rm e } } = 5.4 \\ , { \\rm mm}$ ] , @xmath234_{\\rm i } } = { [ \\rm ca]_{\\rm e } } = 2 \\ , { \\rm mm}$ ] , and @xmath235_{\\rm i } } = { [ \\rm na]_{\\rm e } } = 140 \\ , { \\rm mm}$ ] .",
    "the results are presented in fig .",
    "3 , that shows the voltage and nernst potentials ( a ) , and the energies ( b ) in a long time simulation . after approximately 750 seconds ( 12.5 minutes ) the system reaches oscillations identical to the original oscillations shown in figs . 1 and 2 ( this can not be seen from fig .",
    "3 since the time scale is very different ) .",
    "this long time simulation is a numerical indication that the oscillations in fig . 2 and 3 indeed correspond to a stable limit cycle .",
    "we have presented a simple model for the cells of the rabbit sinoatrial node .",
    "our model involves only @xmath2 , and @xmath223 ions , their respective channels , the @xmath236 exchanger , and the @xmath2 pump .",
    "the equations were derived using basic physical principles and conservation laws .",
    "since the only source of energy in our model is the sodium potassium pump , we can easily track the flow of energy , and show that the pump works to generate a transmembrane voltage , osmotic pressure difference , and an entropy .",
    "our equations also account for the energy lost due to downhill ionic fluxes through the exchanger and channels .",
    "a prediction of osmotic pressure variations is a novel result of our energy analysis .",
    "the intracellular ionic concentrations are dynamic variables in our model , governed by the conservation eqs .",

    "this allows us to replace the standard differential equation for the voltage ( [ eq52 ] ) with the algebraic eq .",
    "( [ eq63 ] ) . although a number of other ionic models also keep track of intracellular ionic concentrations ( see wilders ( 1993 ) ) , we are unaware of any other model using an algebraic equation for the membrane potential",
    ". models that use the standard voltage differential eq .",
    "( [ eq52 ] ) have a phase space with one superfluous extra dimension .",
    "the initial condition for this extra differential equation can not be chosen independently of the initial conditions for the conservation eqs .",
    "( [ eq53 ] ) , ( [ eq54 ] ) , and ( [ eq55 ] )  if it is , the computed membrane potential will be erroneous . for these reasons",
    ", we suggest that our algebraic expression for the membrane potential should replace the standard voltage differential equation in models where intracellular ionic concentrations are dynamic variables .",
    "our model does not include the funny current ( @xmath191 ) , atp sensitive channels , stretch - activated channels , or other ion channels that may be important ( boyett 1996 ) .",
    "we also ignored the effect of calcium uptake and release from the sarcoplasmatic reticulum , which would affect the nernst potential of calcium , but not the membrane potential .",
    "we have assumed that the ionic channels are governed by a markov process , that the maximum of the activation / inactivation time constant occurs at the same voltage as the inflection point of the sigmoidal steady state activation / inactivation curve , and that the steady state activation / inactivation curves were temperature independent .",
    "also , we have assumed that the cell volume is constant .",
    "while such assumptions reduce the number of parameters in the model , they may also result in discrepancies with experiment .",
    "finally , we would like to point out that our model is based on experiments where some were conducted at room temperature ( 22@xmath237 ) ( baruscotti et al .",
    "1996 ; muramatsu et al .",
    "1996 ) , while others were performed at @xmath238 ( shibasaki 1987 ; hagiwara et al . 1988 ; sakai et al . , 1996 ) .",
    "it is not clear what effect varying temperature has in our model as this was not checked out numerically .",
    "the values of the parameters @xmath99 , @xmath100 , @xmath95 , @xmath228 and @xmath229 , given in table [ table3 ] , are only an estimate of the actual physiological parameters .",
    "we did not systematically study the dynamics of the model for different values of the parameters , but we hope that future experiments will help to discriminate between different parameter sets that may reproduce the experimentally recorded action potentials .",
