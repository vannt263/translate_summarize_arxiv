    "percolation is one of the most interesting and fundamental critical phenomena @xcite defined on complex networks @xcite .",
    "it characterizes the non - linear response of a network to random damage of its nodes ( or links ) by evaluating the size of the giant component that results after the initial perturbation . in network science percolation",
    "has received an ever - lasting attention and currently methods and ideas developed in the framework of percolation theory are widely used to study social , technological and biological networks . at the beginning of field , percolation theory on complex networks has been pivotal to characterize the robustness of scale - free networks @xcite .",
    "more recently generalized percolation processes including k - core percolation @xcite , bootstrap percolation @xcite , percolation of multilayer networks @xcite have greatly enriched our understanding of the interplay between the structure of networks and their response to perturbations . in locally tree - like networks",
    ", percolation can be studied using message passing algorithms @xcite .",
    "these algorithms are becoming increasingly popular in network theory and they have been used to characterize the percolation of single @xcite and multilayer networks @xcite , to predict and monitor epidemic spreading @xcite , to identify the driver nodes of a network ensuring its controllability @xcite and to solve a number of other optimization problems on networks @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we aim at using a message - passing algorithm valid in the locally tree - like approximation , to evaluate the fluctuations that can be observed in the response of a network to random damage .",
    "this problem is of wide interest for the network science community and can be applied to a variety of real biological , social and technological networks to gain a comprehensive understanding of their robustness properties .    in all percolation - like studies the goal is to characterize the fraction of nodes in the giant component ( or in the considered generalization of the giant component ) after an initial damage is inflicted to the nodes ( or the links ) of the network .",
    "however , it is usually the case that the real entity of the initial damage is not known .",
    "instead often only the probability that a random node or a random link of the network is initially damaged is known . in this case",
    "it is standard to characterize the response of the network to the external perturbation by considering the expected fraction of nodes remaining in the giant component ( or in its generalization ) after a random initial damage .",
    "for instance , very reliable predictions of this average response of a single network to a random damage of its nodes or links can be obtained by message - passing techniques @xcite as long as the network is locally tree - like .",
    "our aim here is to go beyond this approach proposing a framework able to characterize the fluctuations observed in the response of a network to different realizations of the initial damage considering also the case in which these initial perturbations are correlated . to start with a simple case , we address exclusively percolation of single sparse networks ( i.e. the emergence of the giant component ) . given two random realizations of the initial damage , where the second realization of the initial damage can be correlated with the first realization of the initial damage , we characterize which is the probability that a node is found in the giant component in both realizations or just in one realization of the initial damage . in this way we identify when the network has the most unpredictable response to damage",
    "this point is signalled by a maximum in the fraction of nodes that are found in the giant component for one realization of the damage but are not found in the giant component for the other realization of the damage .",
    "the proposed message - passing algorithm is here tested over real networks including food - webs and infrastructure networks .",
    "finally the critical behavior observed in uncorrelated sparse network ensembles with given degree distribution is here characterized by deriving the relevant critical indices .",
    "consider two different realizations of the initial damage of the nodes indicated respectively by @xmath0 .",
    "each realization of the initial damage @xmath0 , is fully characterized by the set of variables @xmath1 where @xmath2 indicates whether a node @xmath3 is initially removed ( @xmath4 ) or not ( @xmath5 ) from the network . in a locally tree - like network ,",
    "a well known message passing algorithm @xcite is able to predict whether a node @xmath3 belongs ( @xmath6 ) or not ( @xmath7 ) to the giant component after the initial damage indicated by @xmath1 has been inflicted to the network .",
    "specifically the values of the indicator functions @xmath8 are determined by a set of messages @xmath9 that are exchanged between connected nodes @xmath3 and @xmath10 .",
    "these messages take values zero or one ( i.e. @xmath11 ) and indicate whether @xmath12 or not ( @xmath13 ) node @xmath3 connects node @xmath10 to other nodes in the giant component .",
    "these messages are determined by the following recursive set of equations n_ij^(q)=s_i^(q)(1-_n(i)j(1-n_i^(q ) ) ) , where @xmath14 indicates the set of neighbors of node @xmath3 . in other words",
    "node @xmath3 connects node @xmath10 to nodes in the giant component ( @xmath15 ) if and only if it is not initially damaged ( i.e. @xmath5 ) and it has at least a neighbor node @xmath16 different from node @xmath10 that at its turn connects node @xmath3 to other nodes in the giant component .",
    "the messages @xmath9 determine the value of the indicator functions @xmath8 . each indicator function",
    "is set equal to one ( i.e. @xmath6 ) if and only if node @xmath3 is not initially damaged ( i.e. @xmath5 ) and it has at least a neighbor node @xmath16 that connects it to other nodes in the giant component , ( i.e. @xmath17 ) .",
    "therefore we have that the indicator functions @xmath8 are determined by n_i^(q)=s_i^(q)(1-_n(i)(1-n_i^(q ) ) ) .",
    "it is often the case that the exact realization of the initial random damage is not known , and only the probability that the initial damage occurs on any given node of the network is available .",
    "it order to treat this scenario , the probability that a node is in the giant component is usually studied @xcite . when two independent realizations of the initial damage are applied to a given network the response show fluctuations .",
    "these fluctuations can become highly non - trivial in the case in which the two realizations of the initial damage are correlated . to characterize the fluctuations in the general case of node - dependent and correlated damage",
    ", we consider two realizations ( @xmath0 ) of the initial random damage . each node @xmath3 is damaged just in one or in both realization of the damage with a node - dependent probability .",
    "it follows that in a pair @xmath0 of realizations of the initial damage , the initial damage configuration @xmath18 has probability ( \\{s_i^(1),s_i^(2)})&=&_i=1^n , [ hp ] where @xmath19},p_i^{[01]},p_i^{[10]}$ ] and @xmath20}$ ] indicate respectively the probability that node @xmath3 is not initially damaged for both @xmath21 and @xmath22 ; the probability that it is initially damaged for @xmath21 and not for @xmath22 ; the probability that it is not initially damaged for @xmath21 and is initially damaged for @xmath22 ; or the probability that it is initially damaged for both @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
