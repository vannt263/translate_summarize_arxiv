    "the singular perturbed square billiard , also called eba billiard @xcite by several authors , is one of the key models for quantum chaotic systems . while the unperturbed square billiard with side ratio @xmath0 shows poissonian level - spacings statistics @xcite and",
    "the sinai billiard , being proved to be a fully chaotic system @xcite , exhibits goe - statistics @xcite , the `` intermediate '' case of a singular perturbed billiard is expected to demonstrate some transient behavior @xcite .",
    "however it was reported , that the billiard with a point perturbation can exhibit `` fully developed quantum chaos '' @xcite .",
    "it may seem strange , since a point perturbation has almost no influence on the classical phase space of the billiard .",
    "thus it is natural to assume that in the semiclassical limit the billiard with a point perturbation shows a similar statistics to an unperturbed one .",
    "the proposed explanation of the given paradox was based on the argument that for zero - range perturbation for any wavelength one can never reach the limit of the classical billiard with a point - perturbation , since the wavelength is finite while the perturbation radius is zero .",
    "therefore the quantum system becomes chaotic while its classical analog is almost integrable .",
    "this argument seemingly was justified experimentally @xcite .    in the presented report",
    "we show that the level - spacings statistics of eba billiards actually tends to poissonian when the number of taken eigenvalues tends to infinity .",
    "these findings are in accordance with the intuitive `` classical '' argument given above , but are in contradiction with previous theoretical @xcite and experimental @xcite results . for a narrow window of eigenvalues",
    "some conclusions of refs . @xcite",
    "remain valid , however one can not directly apply the results to a wide eigenvalue range .",
    "this discrepancy traces back to the procedure applied by the authors to take care of the singularity of the green function , by replacing the `` bare '' coupling constant by a renormalized one absorbing the infinity .",
    "although this renormalization technique is standard in quantum electrodynamics , it is not appropriate to compute the spectrum of a eba billiard . in this paper",
    "we present the suitable renormalization procedure .    [ cols=\"^ \" , ]     in this section we are presenting a number of numerical results . figures [ fig::seba1]-[fig::seba3 ] show level - spacings distributions for the perturbed part of the spectrum for various situations to be discussed in detail below . for comparison the curves corresponding to poissonian , semi - poissonian and goe distributions are plotted by solid , dashed , and solid lines , respectively . in each of the figures subfigure ( a )",
    "shows the level - spacings distribution for the unperturbed system to make sure that the distribution is really poissonian , since it is well - known that there may be deviations for small distances depending on the side ratio of the rectangle .",
    "subfigures ( b)-(d ) show level - spacings distributions for @xmath1 respectively .",
    "note that a decreasing value of @xmath2 means an increase of the perturbation .    in figure [ fig::seba1 ]",
    "the scatterer is placed in the center whereas in figure [ fig::seba2 ] it is at the point @xmath3 . in both cases about 1500",
    "lowest perturbed eigenvalues have been considered . for @xmath4 ,",
    "i.e. for a weak perturbation , the distribution shows a linear repulsion for small distances and an exponential tail , but not a semi - poissonian behavior in the strict sense ( dashed line ) . with @xmath5",
    "there is a gradual transition to a broader distribution , resembling goe one for the scatterer in the center ( figure [ fig::seba1](d ) ) and a semi - poissonian distribution for the scatterer in the off - center position ( figure [ fig::seba2](d ) ) .",
    "this observation would deserve more quantitative treatment , but this goes beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "qualitatively it may be understood from the fact that in the center of the billiard all perturbed eigenfunctions have the same value , while for an off - center position there is a distribution of eigenfunctions amplitudes giving rise to a corresponding distribution of resonances shifts .",
    "figure [ fig::seba3 ] finally shows the level - spacings distribution again with the perturbation in the center but now for the numbers of perturbed eigenvalues from 25000 to 27000 .",
    "comparison of figures [ fig::seba1 ] and [ fig::seba3 ] shows a pronounced change of the distribution towards poissonian with increasing eigenvalues numbers .",
    "this is particularly evident for the weaker perturbations @xmath6 ( figure [ fig::seba3](b)-(c ) and demonstrates the main result of this paper : _ with increasing eigenvalues numbers eventually the level - spacings distribution of the unperturbed system is recovered . _",
    "let us now conclude . first of all we have presented in the paper the complete solution of the spectral problem for the rectangular billiard with a single point perturbation . in contrast to previous studies",
    "@xcite we have shown that the statistics of the eba billiard tends to a poissonian when the number of levels taken into account tends to infinity . the estimation given at the end of section 5 showed , however , that the transition to poissonian statistics appears , depending on the scattering length , only at exponentially large quantum numbers .",
    "the solution is based on the _ ewald representation of the renormalized green function _ ( [ eq::xiewald ] ) .",
    "this representation contains exponentially rapidly convergent series . together with the ewald representation of the usual green function ( [ eq::g1f - uv ] ) , ( [ eq::g1 ] ) , ( [ eq::g2em ] ) the presented approach is a powerful tool to analyze various experiments made in rectangular billiards .",
    "the authors gratefully acknowledge useful discussions with p.  eba , p.  exner , v.  g.  papanicolaou , n.  makarov , f.  izrailev , m. miski - oglu , b. dietz , p.  kurasov , s.  fishman and a.  potzuweit .",
    "this work was supported by the deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft via an individual grant .",
    "in the appendix we show that the explicit application of the poisson resummation in the derivation of ewald s representation of the green function can be avoided . these findings",
    "simplify the technical calculations .",
    "let us consider the initial problem ( [ eq::ginit ] ) in the rectangular billiard with proper boundary conditions .",
    "then the solution can be written in two equivalent forms : in the form of the images representation @xmath7 and in the form of eigenmodes representation @xmath8 : @xmath9 t } \\psi_{nm}(x , y)\\psi_{nm}(x',y').\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] then we write @xmath10 where @xmath11 performing the integration in eqs .",
