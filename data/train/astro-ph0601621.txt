    "there is evidence for some evolution at the highest masses as ellipticals grow by spheroid - spheroid or `` dry '' mergers @xcite , but this , by definition , proceeds strictly hierarchically , and _ can not",

    "a number of theoretical models have been proposed to explain the evolution of these populations with redshift , and their correlations with one another ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "in many of these models , the merger hypothesis @xcite provides a potential physical mechanism linking galaxy star formation , morphology , and black hole evolution and explaining these various manifestations of cosmic `` downsizing . '' in this scenario , gas - rich galaxy mergers channel large amounts of gas to galaxy centers ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) , fueling powerful starbursts ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) and buried bh growth ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) until the bh grows large enough that feedback from accretion rapidly unbinds and heats the surrounding gas @xcite , leaving an elliptical galaxy satisfying observed correlations between bh and spheroid mass .",
    "major mergers rapidly and efficiently exhaust the cold gas reservoirs of the progenitor systems , allowing the remnant to rapidly redden with a low specific star formation rate , with the process potentially accelerated by the expulsion of remnant gas by the quasar ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this naturally explains the observed close association between the elliptical and red galaxy populations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in a qualitative sense , the evolution of the characteristic mass at which these processes occur can be understood as follows .",
    "mergers proceed efficiently at high redshift , occurring most rapidly in the regions of highest overdensity corresponding to the most massive galaxies , building up the high - mass elliptical mf .",
    "however , once formed these galaxies are `` dead '' , and mergers involving gas - rich galaxies must transition to lower masses",
    ".    recent hydrodynamical simulations , incorporating star formation , supernova feedback , and bh growth and feedback @xcite make it possible to study these processes self - consistently and have lent support to this general picture .",
    "mergers with bh feedback yield remnants resembling observed ellipticals in their correlations with bh properties @xcite , scaling relations @xcite , colors @xcite , and morphological and kinematic properties @xcite .",
    "the quasar activity excited through such mergers can account for the qlf and a wide range of quasar properties at a number of frequencies @xcite , and with such a detailed model to `` map '' between merger , quasar , and remnant galaxy populations it is possible to show that the buildup and statistics of the quasar and red galaxy populations are consistent and can be used to predict one another @xcite .",
    "however , it is by no means clear whether this is , in fact , the dominant mechanism in the buildup of early - type populations and quasars and their evolution with redshift .",
    "for example , many semi - analytic models incorporate quasar triggering / feedback and morphological transformation by mergers @xcite . however , some models tie quasar activity directly to star formation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , implying it will evolve in a manner tracing star - forming galaxies , with this evolution and the corresponding downsizing effect roughly independent of mergers and morphological galaxy segregation at redshifts @xmath11 .",
    "others invoke post - starburst agn feedback to suppress star formation on long timescales and at relatively low accretion rates through e.g.  `` radio - mode '' feedback @xcite , which , if this is also associated with optical qso modes , would imply quasars should trace the established `` old '' red galaxy population at each redshift .",
    "there are , of course , other sources of feedback , with galactic superwinds from star formation presenting an alternative means to suppress subsequent star formation , although the required wind energetics are sufficiently high to prefer a quasar - driven origin ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "several models invoke a distinction between `` hot '' and `` cold '' accretion modes @xcite , in which new gas can not cool into a galactic disk above a critical dark matter halo mass , potentially supplemented by agn feedback @xcite , as the dominant distinction between the blue cloud and red sequence , essentially independent of effects on scales within galaxies .",
    "it is also important to distinguish the processes which may be associated with the initial movement of galaxies onto the red sequence from their subsequent evolution .",
    "once morphologically transformed by a gas - rich merger , for example , mass can be moved `` up '' the rs ( galaxies increased in mass ) by gas - poor mergers , but it can not be _ added _ to the red sequence in this manner .",
    "it also remains an important cosmological question to understand how , once formed , further growth of ellipticals by accretion or `` cooling flows '' may be halted .",
    "the models above invoke various feedback processes , including `` radio mode '' activity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , cyclic quasar or starburst - driven feedback @xcite , massive entropy injection from a single quasar epoch ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and `` hot mode '' accretion @xcite to address this problem .",
    "although critical to our understanding of galaxy formation , these processes must operate over timescales of order the hubble time for all massive galaxies once formed , and therefore are _ not _ necessarily associated with the _ addition _ of mass to the red sequence .",
    "as such , the details of these long - term suppression mechanisms should be studied in different ( e.g.  already formed elliptical ) populations , and are outside the scope of this paper .",
    "observationally , it is still unclear whether mergers can account for the the buildup of elliptical and/or quasar populations ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "even within the context of the merger hypothesis , the relative importance of dissipational ( gas rich , disk ) vs.  dissipationless ( gas poor , spheroid - spheroid ) mergers is unclear ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although all measurements agree that the `` dry '' merger rate is much less than the gas - rich merger rate at all observed redshifts @xcite .",
    "this is essentially related to the critical question of whether the buildup of the red sequence and elliptical populations is dominated by the formation or movement of `` new '' early - type galaxies onto that sequence or instead by the hierarchical assembly of small `` seed '' early - types and substructure formed at high redshift ( which will also not trigger quasar activity ) .",
    "fundamentally , it is not clear and has not yet been tested whether the observed downsizing trends in the transition mass , galaxy stellar populations , quasars , and other populations are in fact _",
    "quantitatively _ the same trend , or merely _ qualitatively _ similar .",
    "this represents a key test which can distinguish between several of the various scenarios above . attempting to predict the values of this transition mass in an a priori cosmological manner",
    "is inherently model dependent and , at least at low redshift , degenerate between the various models described above .",
    "however , if mergers are indeed the critical link in the process causing the flow of galaxies from the blue to red sequence and triggering quasar activity , then it is a strong prediction of these theories , and specifically the modeling of hopkins et al .",
    "( 2005a - d,2006a - d ) that the same mergers are responsible for the bulk of the bright quasar population and the buildup of the new mass on the red sequence at each redshift .",
    "in other words , these downsizing trends must quantitatively reflect one another .",
    "in this picture , the `` transition mass '' ( @xmath12 ) may represent the `` smoking gun '' of mergers causing the flow of galaxies from the blue to red sequence .",
    "therefore , to the extent that @xmath12 traces the mass at which the red sequence is being `` built '' at some @xmath13 , it should also trace the characteristic mass of star - forming galaxies merging at that time , and the characteristic mass of galaxies hosting quasars which are initially triggered by those mergers .",
    "of particular interest , the empirical test of this association does not require the adoption of some a priori model for galaxy formation .    here , we consider the observed @xmath12 over the interval @xmath6 , and compare it to the characteristic masses of quasar hosts and merging galaxies over the same range in redshift .",
    "we demonstrate that they appear to be evolving in a manner consistent with a merger - driven unification model of quasars , interacting galaxies , and the red galaxy population .",
    "note that we use the term `` quasar '' somewhat loosely , as a proxy for high - eddington ratio accretion inevitably caused by gas - rich mergers , although there may be other triggering mechanisms as well @xcite .",
    "such activity will of course be significantly weaker in small systems ( especially those typical of local ulirgs ) and may not technically qualify as a `` classical '' optical quasar @xcite , but this distinction is essentially arbitrary and has little impact on our analysis ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "we adopt a @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 cosmology .",
    "all stellar masses are rescaled to a @xcite imf .",
    "various studies have used different definitions and terms for the mass which separates the dominance of old , red , low - sfr elliptical galaxies from that of young , blue , star - forming disk galaxies .",
    "it is also possible to divide the galaxy population along any one of those quantities .",
    "although it has been established in a number of observational studies that the galaxy population is bimodal with respect to color , specific star formation rate , and morphology ( e.g. , * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and that this bimodality extends at least to @xmath5 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , it is still possible that the various definitions used to separate these bimodal distributions could result in a systematically different `` separation point . ''    in what follows , we consider several definitions of the `` transition '' galaxy stellar mass in terms of the mfs ( @xmath17 ) of early and late type systems : the @xcite transition mass @xmath12 at which the density of early and late type systems are equal , @xmath18 the @xcite `` quenching '' mass @xmath19 at which the contribution of late types to the total mass function cuts off , @xmath20 and the @xcite `` downsizing '' mass @xmath21 above which @xmath22 of the @xmath8 rs mf has been assembled by a given redshift , @xmath23 for each , we consider a division between early and late types defined by either a color ( i.e.   separating galaxies on the redshift - dependent rs from the `` blue cloud '' ; see e.g.  @xcite ) , star formation rate ( generally from detailed population synthesis modeling , although we include looser emission / absorption galaxy spectral type separations ) , or morphology ( either by visual morphological identification or concentration / surface brightness ) criteria . above these masses , early type galaxies in the red , low - sfr , high - concentration , morphologically elliptical `` half '' of the bimodal distribution dominate the total galaxy mf , and below , late type galaxies in the blue , high - sfr , low - concentration , morphologically disk - like or irregular bimodal `` half '' dominate ( generally true also for @xmath21 , though it is technically independent of @xmath24 ) .",
    "we determine these masses from a number of compiled type - separated mass functions , shown in figure  [ fig : oplot.mfs ] ( for clarity , just the early - type mfs are shown ) .",
    "data in all cases are converted to our adopted cosmology and rescaled to a @xcite imf .",
    "at all redshifts , only points above the quoted completeness limits of each study are shown .",
    "errors are as published , and generally account for cosmic variance similar to e.g.  @xcite . at @xmath8 , we generally adopt the local mf determinations from @xcite from 2mass+sdss observations , but find no change in our results considering e.g.  the 2mass+2dfgrs @xcite determination . at higher redshifts ,",

    "each of these considers the separate mfs of early and late types , divided according to at least one of the criteria above .",
    "although many of these surveys cover a small area and thus may be subject to significant cosmic variance , our conclusions are unchanged if we restrict ourselves to the largest fields , and are in fact most robust for the wide - field surveys from combo-17 ( @xmath30 ) and deep2 ( @xmath31 ) .",

    "these samples generally derive masses from optical+near - ir spectral and photometric fitting . to compare",
    ", we also consider the evolution in @xmath21 ( color - selected ) determined by @xcite .",
    "they compile the @xmath32-band early - type ( red ) galaxy luminosity functions from combo-17 @xcite , deep2 @xcite , and the subaru/_xmm - newton _ deep survey @xcite at @xmath33 ( typical @xmath34 between luminosity functions ) , and use the redshift - dependent evolution of @xmath32-band mass - to - light ratios determined from fundamental plane studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "we fit a simple relation of the form @xmath38 in each panel ( for illustrative purposes only , we do not intend for this to be considered a rigorous estimate of the evolution in these characteristic masses ) .    despite the different selection and type separation methods and definitions of a characteristic mass , a nearly identical trend with redshift is recovered in every case .",
    "in fact , the best - fit slopes @xmath39 for most selection methods and definitions are statistically indistinguishable from the cumulative best - fit slope , and several of the definitions agree nearly exactly in figure  [ fig : compare.methods ] .",
    "it is also reassuring that the indirect estimates from optical luminosity functions , which generally involve the largest samples and most finely probe the redshift evolution of @xmath21 , agree well at all redshifts with the mf estimates .",
    "this suggests that the trend with redshift is real , and that it is independent of the potential systematics in sample selection , as these systematics can be quite different for the various criteria shown .",
    "the absolute normalization of the `` transition '' mass does depend systematically on the definition chosen .",
    "for example , same separation by color or sfr gives a systematic factor @xmath40 lower mass than separation by morphology , and @xmath19 is systematically higher than @xmath41 by about the same factor for all separation methods ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "the systematic difference in @xmath41 and @xmath19 can be understood as a consequence of their definitions ( essentially one could define arbitrary schechter functions for early and late - type systems , and as long as the early - type function has a shallower slope and larger @xmath42 , this small systematic offset in the two measurements would be guaranteed ) .",
    "the systematic offset between color / sfr and morphological selection is best demonstrated in the detailed comparison of local color and morphologically selected mfs in e.g.  @xcite .",
    "these authors find that although the different selection methods preserve the same qualitative behavior , and result in early and late - type samples which are identical in @xmath43 of the included galaxies , the color criterion does result in a slightly larger number of early - type systems ( probably owing to the large scatter in blue galaxy colors , with a non - negligible highly dust - reddened population ) , which will push the characteristic separation mass slightly lower .",
    "this may also explain why there appears to be a larger scatter between samples at a given redshift in the morphologically - defined @xmath41 and @xmath19 , as such an effect will be sensitive to a given sample s resolution and imaging depth .",
    "there may also be an interesting timescale effect , as discussed in @xcite , if galaxies redden onto the red sequence somewhat more rapidly than they morphologically relax following mergers ( perhaps suggesting different mechanisms for morphological and color transformation ) .",
    "however , that @xmath44 ( depending only on @xmath45 ) is similar regardless of selection method suggests that these differences may be an artifact of the selection / identification of _ blue _ galaxies . in any case , further detailed study of these intermediate objects and comparison between different samples is needed to understand these differences .",
    "these systematic distinctions caution against mixing definitions in determining the redshift evolution of these masses .",
    "however , for our purposes , the systematic normalization scatter of a factor @xmath40 is not large  this is comparable to the inherent ambiguity in defining a `` characteristic mass '' of any population ( e.g.  schechter @xmath42 ) . as long as we are careful about the relatively small normalization offsets between selection criteria",
    ", we can safely compare the `` transition '' mass and its evolution with redshift to the masses of other populations .",
    "it has been suggested ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that the `` transition '' mass may represent the mass at which the early - type mf is `` building up '' at each redshift , in the sense that `` new '' spheroids are being added to the rs mf at this mass . if cosmic downsizing applies to galaxy assembly to any extent ",
    "i.e.  this `` building up '' extends at higher masses at higher redshift ( or `` peaks '' at lower redshift for lower masses ) , then this implies a shift of @xmath21 to lower mass at lower redshift @xcite .",
    "to the extent that the shape of the late - type mf does not dramatically change over this redshift interval ( observed in the samples above and e.g. * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) this will , by definition , manifest in a similar evolution of @xmath41 and @xmath19 . in this scenario ,",

    "the number density declines steeply with @xmath13 ( roughly @xmath47 with @xmath48 ) .",
    "although the statistics are poor and variance large at high @xmath42 , there is a significant trend ( @xmath49 ) for a shallower decline in number density at higher masses ( @xmath50 , i.e.   little evolution in number density , at @xmath51 ) . above @xmath5 ,",
    "the various samples plotted begin to disagree , and the @xmath47 functional form may not be a good approximation , so we reconsider this , fitting only the data at @xmath28 ( @xmath52 ) , and find the same trend at @xmath53 ( @xmath54 ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : ell.buildup.mfs ] considers the differential growth of the early - type mf in more detail .",
    "we show the time - averaged buildup of early - type mfs in several redshift intervals from @xmath55 . where a given sample measures the elliptical mass function at two redshifts @xmath13 and @xmath56 , we differentiate the observed elliptical mass function at every mass with respect to the two redshifts to obtain the time - averaged rate of creation of ellipticals of that mass , over that redshift interval . in total , we show four redshift intervals : @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , and @xmath60 .",
    "of course , we only compare mass functions measured with the same technique and sample in the same study , since systematic offsets in methodology could severely bias such an estimate .",
    "although the scatter is large ( especially at low masses ) , the observations all trace a similar elliptical formation rate as a function of mass , with a similar break traced in the different samples at each redshift .",
    "the shape of this function is not the same as that of the early type mass functions  i.e.   we are not simply recovering the fact that the mass function builds up uniformly over these intervals .    at low redshift ( @xmath2 ) ,",
    "comparison with the early - type mfs in figure  [ fig : oplot.mfs ] shows that sub-@xmath42 ( @xmath61 ) ellipticals are `` building up '' in number density by @xmath62 per gyr , whereas the most massive systems build up by only @xmath63 per gyr . in other words",

    "the best - fit schechter functions plotted in each redshift interval reflect this , with the schechter @xmath42 shifting from @xmath66 ( @xmath2 ) to @xmath67 ( @xmath68 ) .",
    "the low-@xmath13 growth estimate of @xmath63 per gyr in the most massive systems is in excellent agreement with that from @xcite and @xcite determined from local red galaxy ( spheroid - spheroid or `` dry '' ) merger rates . in detail , observations suggest that the typical massive red galaxy undergoes @xmath69 major dissipationless mergers since @xmath70 @xcite . if this is representative , it is trivial to predict the corresponding rate of buildup of the elliptical population , assuming every red galaxy undergoes this number of major ( @xmath71 mass ratio ) mergers in this time .",
    "this is shown in figure  [ fig : ell.buildup.mfs ] , calculated from the local mf of @xcite .",
    "although these mergers appear to be important for building up the most massive galaxies at low ( @xmath2 ) redshift , their contribution cuts off completely below @xmath72 ( and will cut off at higher masses at higher @xmath13 , generally about @xmath40 times the break in the `` buildup '' mass function ) .",
    "such mergers move galaxies from the low - mass end of the elliptical mass function to the high mass end , and since the low - mass slope of the elliptical mass function is not steep , this can only _ decrease _ the number density of low - mass objects . by definition ,",
    "then , dry mergers can not account for the ( substantial ) buildup of _ total _ mass on the rs nor the buildup at low and intermediate masses .",
    "if these lower - mass ellipticals are formed by gas - rich mergers , then there must be at least @xmath40 times as many gas - rich mergers moving new galaxies onto the elliptical mass function as there are dry mergers ( in fact , the actual observed ratio is @xmath73 , @xcite ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : compare.mcrit.mstar ] compares the `` transition '' mass determined above with the characteristic masses ( schechter @xmath42 ) of the red , blue , and all galaxy populations . for clarity , we show just @xmath21 , as it is the most well - determined of the masses in figure  [ fig : compare.methods ] , as well as being most robust with respect to sample definitions / selection , and further it has the most direct physical interpretation ( as it is not degenerate with blue cloud evolution ) . our conclusions here and subsequently , however , are unchanged regardless of the mass definition from figure  [ fig : compare.methods ] .",

    "[ sec : compare.mstar ] , allowing for more complex and realistic distributions of galaxies in transition to the rs can affect quantities such as the `` break '' mass @xmath42 and `` transition '' mass in a non - trivial manner .",
    "but there is also the possibility that the `` transition '' to the rs requires additional processes beyond the initial cutoff of new gas supplies in `` hot mode '' accretion , such as gas exhaustion , mergers , and/or quasar activity to operate , which are what we see traced by the observed transition mass .",
    "it is also worth considering whether or not the flow of galaxy host halos across @xmath163 is consistent with the number and mass densities of `` transition '' objects and the buildup in early - type populations which we have estimted from the observations .",
    "the rate at which halos cross a given mass threshold @xmath164 is straightforward to calculate in linear theory from the press - schechter formalism , @xmath165 and adopting either a simple mean stellar - to - dark matter mass ratio ( from the calibration of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or integrating ( at this halo mass ) over the population of inferred hosted galaxies from the conditional galaxy mass functions ( cmfs ; i.e.  probability that halos of mass @xmath164 host galaxies of stellar mass @xmath42 ) yields an estimate of the rate at which stellar mass crosses this threshold .",
    "the local cmf is determined ( albeit indirectly ) entirely from observations of galaxy mass / luminosity functions and clustering ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and has been subsequently measured directly in 2dfgrs group catalogues by @xcite , and is well - constrained with typical uncertainties smaller than or comparable to those in our estimate of the rate of early - type `` buildup '' ( at least for @xmath166 of interest here ; the mf at lower masses depends on the mass threshold for inclusion of satellite systems ) .",
    "@xcite extend the clf / cmf to high redshifts ( @xmath167 ) using a large number of luminosity function and clustering estimates from wide - area surveys .",
    "note that @xcite and @xcite actually measure the conditional luminosity function ( clf ) ; we convert to a cmf using the appropriate @xmath37 ratios as a function of mass from @xcite , and assume these @xmath37 values evolve with redshift following the best - fit stellar population models as a function of mass from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "checking directly ( following the methodology of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) shows that this agrees with the @xcite mass functions ( see also their figure  19 ) and the @xcite measured clustering as a function of stellar mass , and furthermore , these cmfs agree well with those directly determined in @xcite .",
    "ultimately , there are a number of systematic ( factor @xmath168 ) uncertainties in this comparison , and our ( admittedly crude ) empirical calculation ignores the fact that , in `` quenching '' models , crossing the quenching threshold itself may change the stellar - to - dark matter mass ratios and stellar @xmath37 values .",
    "however , within these rather large uncertainties , our purely empirically estimated rate at which galactic host halos cross @xmath163 is consistent with the possibility that this is a necessary prerequisite for `` transition '' to the rs .",
    "we compare the populations we have considered in an independent manner by examining their clustering properties . if a population ( i.e.  a given set of `` parent '' halos ) clusters with a given bias @xmath169 at some redshift @xmath13 , then the subsequent evolution in their bias is trivially calculated in linear theory @xmath170 ,   \\label{eqn : bias}\\ ] ] where @xmath171 is the growth factor @xcite , regardless of the processes ( accretion , mergers , etc . ) that affect the halos ( and galaxies ) themselves .",
    "the bias of galaxies ( specifically red / elliptical galaxies ) as a function of stellar mass is well - determined at @xmath8 ( we adopt the recent determination from the sdss in * ? ? ? * with typical @xmath172 uncertainty ) , so given the bias of a population at @xmath13 and evolving it to @xmath8 with equation  ( [ eqn : bias ] ) yields the characteristic @xmath8 stellar mass of this population ( i.e.  the average stellar mass of which the population is the `` parent '' ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : clustering ] shows this @xmath42 , calculated from various clustering measurements @xmath169 of quasars , mergers ( ulirgs and smgs ) , and e+a galaxies as a function of redshift , and compares to the `` transition '' mass @xmath21 at each redshift .",
    "we invert this as well ; knowing @xmath44 , evolve @xmath173 with equation  ( [ eqn : bias ] ) to estimate @xmath169 .",

    "the absolute value of the bias as plotted is then weakly dependent on cosmology ( and this conversion , of course , is inexact ) , but the important point for our purposes is that the _ relative _ bias of all points plotted ( and @xmath178 with which we compare ) is insensitive to the cosmology .",
    "these comparisons do assume that the stellar mass of individual systems does not change much from @xmath13 to @xmath8 , i.e.  that , once formed , ellipticals are passively evolving .",
    "however , we can easily eliminate this assumption , by considering the clustering directly observed for red galaxies of mass @xmath44 at that redshift , and figure  [ fig : clustering ] shows this as well . in either case , the agreement with the clustering of quasars and ( albeit much less well - constrained ) merger / e+a populations is good .",
    "this also agrees with determinations of e.g.  the typical overdensities and small - scale clustering of quasars and ulirgs @xcite .",
    "this method by which we compare clustering is only weakly dependent on cosmology , through the growth factor @xmath171 ( independent of e.g.  @xmath179 ) .",
    "there are some caveats , however .",
    "technically , we are estimating the mass which has exactly the observed bias ; this is some weighted mean mass .",
    "however , theoretical expectations from physically motivated quasar light curve models @xcite and direct observations of clustering as a function of luminosity @xcite suggest that quasar clustering depends only weakly on luminosity , reflecting a reasonably well - defined characteristic host mass .",
    "these comparisons will also , of course , be affected if the clustering of mergers is different on large scales from that of non - merging halos of the same mass ( a so - called `` merger bias '' ) . however , a number of investigations have found no such dependence ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and even where more recent investigations have seen such an effect @xcite it has been restricted to small mass halos ( below the `` collapse mass '' , i.e.  where @xmath180 ) at @xmath8 , and therefore the assumption of no merger bias has generally been adopted in quasar clustering studies @xcite .",
    "we can repeat this comparison using the formalism of @xcite from linear collapse theory , which yields a characteristic halo mass from a given observed @xmath169 .",
    "we use the observed stellar mass - halo mass relations calibrated for elliptical galaxies from weak lensing measurements in @xcite to convert these halo masses to a stellar mass @xmath41 .",
    "we convert between halo mass and bias with the method of @xcite modified following @xcite in our adopted cosmology ( in detail assuming @xmath181 , @xmath182 ) with the power spectrum computed following @xcite .",
    "the results are similar , but are much more sensitive to the adopted cosmology and systematics in the stellar mass - halo mass relation in this approach .    in considering the clustering of @xmath21 objects , we have considered the directly measured bias of objects with mass @xmath44 at redshift @xmath13 , as well as the `` passively evolved '' clustering from the @xmath8 bias as a function of mass .",
    "we can gain further insight into the evolution of these populations by comparing the two . knowing the observed bias of @xmath44 objects at @xmath13",
    ", we can evolve this to @xmath8 given equation  ( [ eqn : bias ] ) , and then use @xmath183 to obtain the typical stellar mass hosted by these systems _ at @xmath8 .",
    "_ comparing that to their stellar mass at @xmath13 , namely @xmath44 , shows by how much the typical stellar mass of the population has grown .",
    "we could also estimate this in a more indirect fashion , using linear theory to estimate a host halo mass @xmath184 given @xmath169 , then knowing the @xmath8 mass of a halo with mass @xmath184 at @xmath13 , use the local galaxy stellar - halo mass calibrations from @xcite to obtain @xmath185 .",
    "again , this approach is considerably more sensitive to the assumed cosmology , but in our adopted case yields similar results .    in figure",
    "[ fig : clustering.to.m.z0 ] , we use this to compare @xmath44 , the stellar mass of `` transition '' mass objects at @xmath13 , with @xmath185 , i.e.  the mean @xmath8 stellar mass which is typically hosted by the evolved `` parent halos . '' unless `` transition '' mass objects comprise some unusual outlier in their halo properties , this should represent the typical stellar mass these objects will grow to by @xmath8 .",
    "we compare with the expectation , following e.g.  @xcite , that these stellar masses grow at a rate corresponding to one major ( mass ratio @xmath186 ) merger since @xmath70 .",
    "we also consider the case if the stellar mass in these objects grows in fixed proportion with their host dark matter halos .",
    "the systematic uncertainties ( and measurement errors in @xmath169 ) are sufficiently large that we should regard these comparisons with caution , and _ not _ consider this as evidence for a particular `` amount '' of dry merging .",
    "however , the estimated @xmath185 demonstrates that the @xmath44 measurements are completely _ consistent _ with subsequent growth by dry mergers at observationally inferred rates .",
    "growth in proportion to the host halo mass , by contrast , is extremely difficult to reconcile with observed properties of the galaxies .",
    "this is not surprising , as the existence of any significant @xmath187 galaxy population at @xmath70 without a corresponding @xmath188 galaxy population at @xmath8 implies that , at least for some objects assembled most rapidly , subsequent galaxy _ assembly _ must lag behind halo growth ( or subsequent growth in these halos must be anomalously slow ) .",
    "this does mean , however , that it is _ not _ possible to reconcile the observations with a model in which galaxy assembly uniformly tracks halo assembly , even allowing for the final galaxy stellar - halo mass ratio to be a function of halo mass ( i.e.  setting in all progenitors the effective @xmath37 of the @xmath8 halo , which then simply assembles ) .",
    "we compile a large number of observations of red / elliptical galaxy mass functions , and use these to determine the rate of `` buildup '' of the red sequence ( rs ) as a function of mass and redshift .",
    "comparing these with observations of other populations allows us to test a number of different models for the possible associations between these populations and the `` transition '' of galaxies from blue , star - forming disks to red , `` dead '' ellipticals .",
    "independent of the nature of `` downsizing '' in the buildup of rs mass functions ( discussed below ) , the rate of rs `` buildup '' is sufficiently well - determined to place meaningful constraints on a number of models .",
    "dissipationless ( gas poor , red , or `` dry '' ) mergers can account for the buildup of the rs at only the largest masses @xmath1 at low redshift ( @xmath2 ) . at higher redshifts ( @xmath189 ) ,",
    "the dry merger rate would have to be at least an order of magnitude larger than observationally estimated @xcite to account for observed rs buildup , even at the highest masses .",
    "this is perhaps unsurprising , as these and other observations find the _ gas - rich _ merger rate / fraction is an order of magnitude or more larger at all but the lowest redshifts .",
    "furthermore , the total mass density on the rs is observed to increase by a factor @xmath190 since @xmath5 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and dry mergers can not , by definition , move / form `` new '' galaxies and mass on the rs",
    ".    however , we find the _ total _ observed merger population ( gas rich+gas poor ) agrees very well with that expected if all rs galaxies are formed in mergers . both the detailed mass distribution and fraction / rates of galaxy mergers are consistent with the rate of rs buildup at all masses and redshifts observed .",
    "this merger population is dominated by gas - rich mergers at all masses at high redshifts ( @xmath189 * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and at low masses at low redshifts , morphologically identifiable as bright ( i.e.  star - forming or starbursting ) interacting systems ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in detail , completely neglecting dry mergers ( or merger mass functions sensitive to them",
    ") , this agreement is unchanged except for the highest masses at low-@xmath13 discussed above .",
    "there is substantial systematic uncertainty in converting a merger fraction to a merger rate ; our comparisons assume a characteristic observable merger timescale @xmath191gyr .",
    "however , this is a theoretically reasonable timescale ( see   [ sec : compare.merger.mass ] ) , and given the scatter in the observations , our conclusions are not changed for systematic shifts within a factor @xmath118 , nor for allowing the merger timescale to scale with halo dynamical times ( @xmath117 ) .",
    "furthermore , this has no effect our comparison of the mass distributions of these populations .",
    "similarly , we find the rate at which host galaxies trigger quasars , determined as a function of the host stellar mass and redshift from the quasar luminosity function , agrees well with the observed rs buildup at all masses and redshifts observed .",
    "there is some discrepancy at the lowest redshifts and highest masses , but this is again where the dry merger contribution can account for the observed buildup , and dry mergers ( by definition being gas - poor or gas - free ) are not expected to trigger quasar activity .",
    "we consider this comparison first in a purely empirical fashion , using observed quasar eddington ratios and the black hole - host mass relation to estimate quasar host masses as a function of redshift , and then in greater detail adopting the models of quasar light curves and lifetimes as a function of luminosity and host properties from the simulations of merger - induced quasar activity in @xcite .",
    "the latter introduces some model dependence ( although it is consistent with the eddington ratio and black hole - host mass relation estimates ) , but allows us to consider this comparison in greater detail and to make specific predictions for the characteristic host masses of quasars as a function of their position on the qlf and for the agn or `` active '' fraction of galaxies as a function of stellar mass . in either case , the agreement between the rates of quasar formation / triggering as a function of host stellar mass and the buildup of rs galaxies is similar .",
    "we independently test these possible associations by comparing clustering measurements of the relevant populations as a function of redshift , and find similar results .",
    "the clustering of quasars and systems `` in transition '' to the rs agree at all redshifts as if they trace the same mass distribution .",
    "clustering properties of merger ( ulirg and smg ) and post - merger ( e+a ) populations are consistent , but considerably less well - constrained .",
    "although the above comparisons do not technically depend on it , we determine the `` transition '' mass ( @xmath12 , @xmath19 ) , i.e.  the mass which separates the blue , star - forming disk and red , non star - forming elliptical populations , as a function of redshift .",
    "it has been suggested ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that this represents the characteristic mass at which galaxies are forming on or being added to the rs as a function of redshift , but quantified in this manner , it is not obviously so ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we therefore also determine ( @xmath21 , following * ? ? ?",
    "* ) the minimum mass above which the rs mass function is @xmath3 assembled at a given redshift .",
    "regardless of definition , and furthermore regardless of the criterion used to separate early and late - type populations ( whether e.g.  a color , star formation rate , or morphology criterion ) , @xmath12/@xmath19/@xmath21 shift to systematically larger masses at higher redshift ( significant at @xmath192 ) , tracing a very similar trend as a function of redshift .",
    "this trend , especially in @xmath21 ( which is independent of possible evolution in late - type mass functions ) suggests that `` downsizing '' applies not just to galaxy _ star formation _ , but also in some sense to galaxy _ assembly _ , as suggested by the studies of e.g.  @xcite . in greater detail , considering the full rate of rs buildup as a function of stellar mass and redshift , low mass ( @xmath193 )",
    "galaxies appear to be building up rapidly / continuously at low redshifts ( @xmath62 per gyr ) , but the most massive systems do not ( @xmath63 per gyr growth at @xmath194 ) .",
    "the growth of the most massive systems instead appears to be rapid at significantly higher redshifts ( e.g.  rising to @xmath65 per gyr by @xmath5 ) .",
    "equivalently , the characteristic mass ( schechter function @xmath42 ) defined by this `` formation '' rate appears ( albeit at only @xmath195 ) to increase with redshift in a similar fashion to the `` transition '' mass .",
    "we compare the `` transition '' mass with the characteristic masses of mergers and quasars and again find they trace similar masses as a function of redshift , with `` downsizing '' evident in all three populations ( @xmath109 for mergers , @xmath192 for quasars ) , further supported by their observed clustering .",
    "we compare with the characteristic ( schechter function ) @xmath42 of the entire , red , and blue galaxy populations , and rule out at high significance the possibility that `` transition '' mass objects are drawn uniformly from any of these populations .",
    "even with the systematic uncertainties in this mass estimate , it is also clearly distinct as a function of redshift from the characteristic masses of e.g.  cluster , radio galaxy , ero , drg , or lbg populations ( see e.g.  figure  2 of * ? ? ?",
    "these observations are all consistent with and suggest a scenario in which major mergers , quasars , and the transition from blue disk to red elliptical galaxies are associated .",
    "they do not inform us regarding , for example , whether gas exhaustion or stellar or quasar feedback is the specific mechanism for the reddening which accompanies the merger - driven morphological transformation and quasar episode .",
    "however , they support the hypothesis that mergers drive the transition from blue disks to red elliptical galaxies , terminating in decaying , feedback - driven bright quasar phases .",
    "the transition mass and break in the qlf appear to reflect the characteristic mass of gas - rich objects merging at a given redshift , which may build up the _ new mass _ on the red sequence at progressively lower masses at lower @xmath13 as gas supplies are exhausted in more massive systems .    that quasar host masses trace the `` transition '' mass and not , e.g.  the blue galaxy population @xmath42 ( see also figure  [ fig : compare.models ] ) rules out the possibility that quasar activity _ generically _ traces star formation , as variants of e.g.  the @xcite models might predict .",
    "likewise , that quasar masses do not trace the red galaxy @xmath42 , as they would if quasar activity was long - lived or randomly ( but uniformly as a function of mass ) episodic in high - mass black holes . the former case would be expected from the low - level agn activity invoked in e.g.  @xcite , if `` radio '' and optical or high - eddington ratio quasar activity were associated , but they are in fact generally believed to be distinct ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the latter case implies strong limits on implementations of e.g.  the @xcite model , which seek to suppress cooling flows through sporadic but potentially high accretion rate agn activity .",
    "although we can rule out some alternatives to the merger scenario , there remain a number of viable variants of `` quenching '' models , in which crossing the critical halo mass @xmath163 and entering a `` hot '' accretion regime plays a key role in the `` transition '' to the rs .",
    "especially given that some feedback mechanism is typically required , even in the `` hot '' accretion regime , to prevent the formation of cooling flows , it is easy to imagine a scenario in which , upon entering this regime , new infalling halo gas is shock - heated , but feedback from e.g.  a central disk galaxy with a small black hole is inefficient , cold gas reservoirs remain large , and cooling flows can form . thus the system will not redden until it subsequently undergoes a major merger , which morphologically transforms the system , rapidly exhausts the remaining cold gas reservoir , and triggers a quasar and builds up a massive black hole , injecting some level of feedback and enabling efficient future ( e.g.  cyclic agn or radio - mode ) feedback . the `` hot '' accretion regime may be a necessary prerequisite for feedback to efficiently prevent subsequent cooling , and as discussed in   [ sec : halomass ] , our comparisons are all consistent with this possibility .",
    "this is generally similar to the scenario assumed in e.g.  @xcite , although they do explicitly incorporate quasar light curves or feedback . recognizing these distinctions ( as opposed to e.g.  assuming a system simply `` shuts down '' upon reaching @xmath163 )",
    "will probably have little effect on the @xmath8 predictions of semi - analytic models , since in either case star formation will be effectively suppressed at relatively early times in the most massive systems ( see also * ? ? ?",
    ". however , at higher redshifts when massive objects are still forming , the distinctions will almost certainly be significant .",
    "we note that none of our conclusions conflict with the hypothesis that , once formed , elliptical galaxies can continue to grow by dry mergers . however , they emphasize that the importance of such mergers is restricted to the most massive galaxies at low redshifts . our results ,",
    "even the steep evolution of @xmath21 implying some `` downsizing '' in red galaxy assembly , are all consistent with ( and in fact , marginally _ favor _ ) the relatively low observationally inferred dry merger rate ( @xmath100 major dry merger since @xmath5 ) . essentially , `` downsizing '' in galaxy assembly as we have quantified it is not , strictly speaking , `` anti - hierarchical . ''",
    "massive galaxies still continue to build up their populations to the present ; it is simply a statement that the _ relative _ rates of red galaxy formation / assembly decrease or `` slow down '' at late times in the most massive systems .",
    "this could be related to pure dark matter processes , for example the rapid evolution in large overdensities could simply exhaust the `` supply '' of galaxies with which to merge , or the cluster environments of massive systems at low redshift attain sufficient circular velocities as to rapidly reduce merger rates ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "the evolution of the `` transition '' mass may , alternatively , be a statement that galaxy assembly does not strictly trace halo assembly .",
    "there are a number of baryonic processes which make this possible , as it simply requires that the effective baryon conversion efficiencies in galaxies be a function of time , or different for central vs.  satellite systems .",
    "improved measurements of early - type mass functions at high redshift ( @xmath5 ) , larger samples of mergers from which to construct merger mass functions , revised or direct determinations of high - redshift conditional mass functions , and direct observations of the masses of quasar hosts will substantially improve the constraints in this paper .",
    "ultimately , the integration of the merger and quasar host mass functions may enable a purely observational comparison with the remnant , red galaxy mass function .",
    "calibration of the observable merger `` timescale '' with realistic high resolution galaxy merger simulations , i.e.  calibration of selection efficiencies for observed merger fractions , can further remove the factor @xmath40 uncertainty in comparing the rates of elliptical buildup and observed merger populations .",
    "the association favored here between mergers , quasars , and elliptical buildup also makes specific predictions for the characteristic masses of e+a galaxies and quasar hosts as a function of redshift , which should be testable in future wide - field surveys .",
    "the scenario we have described does not , of course , imply that mergers , quasars , and remnant ellipticals will necessarily be recognizable as the same , singular objects at a given instant  in fact , simulations which follow the transition through these stages ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , predict that they will be seen as distinct phases in merger - triggered evolution , and observations tracking e.g.  the associations between dynamical merger state and quasar activity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) support this distinction .",
    "what we ultimately find evidence for here in the masses , luminosities , and clustering properties of mergers , galaxies being `` added '' or `` in transition '' to the red sequence , and quasars is that they are drawn from the same `` parent '' population , and that this population is distinct from the `` quiescent '' all / red / blue galaxy population . again , none of this strictly implies causality , but it does favor models which associate these populations with the same event , a natural expectation if mergers of gas - rich galaxies trigger quasars and morphologically transform disks to spheroids , moving `` new '' mass to the early - type population and leaving an elliptical , gas - poor , rapidly reddening remnant galaxy .",

    "<S> we compile a number of recent observations to estimate the time - averaged rate of formation or `` buildup '' of red sequence galaxies , as a function of mass and redshift . comparing this with the mass functions of mergers and quasar hosts , and independently comparing their clustering properties as a function of redshift </S>",
    "<S> , we find that these populations trace the same mass distribution , with the same characteristic masses and evolution , in the redshift interval @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> knowing one of the quasar , merger , or elliptical mass / luminosity functions , it is possible to predict the others .    allowing for greater model dependence </S>",
    "<S> , we compare the rate of early - type `` buildup '' with the implied merger and quasar `` triggering '' rates as a function of mass and redshift , and find agreement . </S>",
    "<S> we show that over this redshift range , observed gas - rich merger fractions can account for the entire bright quasar luminosity function , and buildup of the red sequence at all but the highest masses at low redshift ( @xmath1 at @xmath2 ) where dissipationless `` dry '' mergers appear to dominate . </S>",
    "<S> this supports a necessary prediction of theories which postulate that mergers between gas - rich blue galaxies produce ellipticals with an associated phase of bright quasar activity , after which the remnant becomes red . </S>",
    "<S> all of these populations , regardless of sample selection , trace a similar characteristic `` transition '' mass reflecting the characteristic mass above which the elliptical population is mostly ( @xmath3 ) assembled at a given redshift , which increases with redshift over the observed range in a manner consistent with previous suggestions that `` cosmic downsizing '' may apply to red galaxy _ assembly _ as well as star formation . </S>",
    "<S> we show that these mass distributions as a function of redshift do not uniformly trace the all / red / blue galaxy population , ruling out models in which quasar activity is generically associated with either star formation or is long - lived in `` old '' systems . </S>"
