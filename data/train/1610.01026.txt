    "in a recent paper @xcite , using symmetry considerations , we pointed out that the spatial inhomogeneity caused by a harmonic trap potential , which breaks the local spatial inversion symmetry of the system except at the trap center , may induce an odd - parity ( spin - triplet ) cooper - pair amplitude in the even - parity ( spin - singlet ) @xmath2-wave fermi superfluid , when the spin rotation symmetry is also broken . here , the local spatial inversion symmetry is the inversion symmetry of the system with respect to an inversion center .",
    "for example , when we carry out this symmetry operation for a one - dimensional harmonic potential @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) with respect to @xmath5 , one finds the breakdown of this symmetry as , @xmath6 , unless @xmath7 ( trap center ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the spin rotation symmetry in the present case is the symmetry with respect to exchange of two pseudospins @xmath8 . in ref .",
    "@xcite , to confirm the above - mentioned parity - mixing effect in a simple manner , we explicitly evaluated the induced odd - parity pair amplitude in a toy two - dimensional lattice fermions satisfying the above two conditions .    the above - mentioned work @xcite is strongly motivated by the current status of cold fermi gas physics .",
    "that is , the @xmath1-wave superfluid phase transition has not been realized yet , in spite of great experimental efforts @xcite .",
    "one serious reason for this is that , while a @xmath1-wave pairing interaction is necessary to realize a @xmath1-wave superfluid fermi gas , it also causes the three - body loss @xcite , as well as dipolar relaxation @xcite , leading to very short lifetime of @xmath1-wave cooper pairs . because of this , when one tunes an external magnetic field to be close to a @xmath1-wave feshbach resonance , although , theoretically , a strong @xmath1-wave pairing interaction is expected to give a high @xmath1-wave superfluid phase transition temperature @xcite , the @xmath1-wave pairs are actually destroyed before the @xmath1-wave condensate grows enough .    however , if one can prepare a non - vanishing @xmath1-wave pair amplitude ( which is symbolically written as @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the field operator of a fermion with spin-@xmath11 ) _ without _ using a @xmath1-wave pairing interaction , this current situation would be improved to some extent , because one can then avoid the serious short lifetime problem of @xmath1-wave cooper pairs .",
    "of course , the system is still _ not _ in the @xmath1-wave superfluid state , because of the vanishing @xmath1-wave superfluid order parameter , @xmath12 due to the absence of a @xmath1-wave pairing interaction @xmath13 . in this case , however , when one rapidly introduces a @xmath1-wave pairing interaction @xmath13 associated with a @xmath1-wave feshbach resonance by adjusting an external magnetic field , a non - vanishing @xmath1-wave superfluid order parameter ( which is given by the product of this interaction and the @xmath1-wave pair amplitude which has already been prepared before this manipulation ) is immediately obtained .",
    "then , by definition , the @xmath1-wave superfluid state which is characterized by the @xmath1-wave superfluid order parameter @xmath14 would be realized , at least just after the introduction of the @xmath1-wave interaction .",
    "once the @xmath1-wave superfluid state is realized , as usual , the @xmath1-wave interaction would cause the particle loss , as well as dipolar relaxation .",
    "however , this idea might be alternative to the conventional approach where a @xmath1-wave interaction is used _ from the beginning_.    the purpose of this paper is to assess to what extent the parity - mixing effect discussed in our recent paper @xcite can be used to prepare a @xmath1-wave pair amplitude in the above idea . for this purpose , beyond the previous toy two - dimensional lattice model , we deal with a realistic three - dimensional _ continuum _ @xmath2-wave superfluid fermi gas in a harmonic trap .",
    "this extension is very relevant , because all the current experiments on @xmath2-wave superfluid fermi gases @xcite are done in the absence of deep optical lattice .    between the above - mentioned two conditions for the parity - mixing effect",
    ", the local spatial inversion symmetry is always broken in a harmonic trap , when one takes the inversion center away from the trap center .",
    "thus , no additional setup is necessary for this first condition .",
    "however , we should note that the local density approximation ( lda ) , which has widely been used in considering a trapped fermi gas @xcite , can not correctly treat this symmetry breaking .",
    "this is simply because lda deals with the system at each spatial position as a uniform system with a position dependent fermi chemical potential involving effects of a trap potential .",
    "thus , in this paper , we employ the real - space bogoliubov - de gennes mean - field theory @xcite , to fully take into account the spatial inhomogeneity in a trap .    for the second required condition for the parity - mixing effect ( broken spin rotation symmetry ) , a spin - imbalanced @xmath2-wave fermi superfluid , which has already been realized in @xmath15li fermi gases @xcite , is most promising , where the density difference between two fermi species naturally breaks this symmetry . in a trapped @xmath2-wave superfluid fermi gas with spin imbalance ,",

    "one crucial difference is that , in these cases , the phase separation between the superfluid region and the normal region does not occur , in contrast to the spin - imbalanced case , so that the triplet cooper pairs are induced in the wider spatial region , compared to the case of the spin imbalance .",

    "<S> this indicates that , when one suddenly changes the @xmath2-wave pairing interaction to an appropriate @xmath1-wave one by using a feshbach technique in this case , a non - vanishing @xmath1-wave superfluid order parameter is immediately obtained , which is given by the product of the @xmath1-wave interaction and the @xmath1-wave pair amplitude that has already been induced in the spin - imbalanced @xmath2-wave superfluid fermi gas . </S>",
    "<S> thus , by definition , the system is in the @xmath1-wave superfluid state , at least just after this manipulation . </S>",
    "<S> since the achievement of a @xmath1-wave superfluid state is one of the most exciting challenges in cold fermi gas physics , our results may provide an alternative approach to this unconventional pairing state . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , since the parity - mixing effect can not be explained as far as one deals with a trap potential in the local density approximation ( lda ) , it is considered as a crucial example which requires us to go beyond lda . </S>"
