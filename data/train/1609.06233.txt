    "thus at least to this level of co substitution , as shown in fig .",
    "[ summ ] for co - rich side of the phase diagram , the cef splitting does not change significantly from the pure ybco@xmath5zn@xmath3 .",
    "in addition , since the temperature of c@xmath38 sets an upper limit of the total cef splitting , the total cef splitting does not change much across the whole substitution range and may have increased slightly when approaching the ybfe@xmath5zn@xmath3 side .",
    "in contrast , the cef effect is more apparent for ybco@xmath5zn@xmath3 .",
    "the difference in kondo physics between ybfe@xmath5zn@xmath3 and ybco@xmath5zn@xmath3 most likely originate from the difference in density of states as well as kondo coupling strength .",
    "going back to the generalized kadowaki - woods plot shown in fig .",
    "[ c](c ) , upon co substitution up to x = 0.170 , the degeneracy that is responsible for the kondo effect is still very close to the full degeneracy : @xmath6 = 8 .",
    "however , the temperatures at which kondo coherence is developed have become comparable or even smaller than the estimated cef splitting .",
    "this trend can be clearly represented by @xmath37 shown in fig .",
    "it may be possible that , for x = 0.170 as an example , the kondo temperature is still at a relatively higher temperature than the cef splitting , which quenches the local moment with a degeneracy close to 8@xcite . on the other hand , kondo coherence , as tracked by @xmath37 , does not significantly affect the way magnetic entropy is removed . with an even lower kondo energy scale , the cef feature would have enough room to be more apparent , like in the case for x = 0.222 .",
    "finally , as for the low - temperature rise in the specific heat of yb(fe@xmath62co@xmath63)@xmath2zn@xmath3 , since there is no magnetic ordering or applied magnetic field , there should not be a nuclear schottky anomaly due to zeeman splitting of nuclear levels in specific heat measurement .",
    "however , the low - temperature upturn in the specific heat data observed below 100 mk could still come from a nuclear quadrupolar splitting of the @xmath70yb nuclear moment@xcite .",
    "such quadrupole splitting for yb in a cubic point symmetry may arise from the electric field gradient caused by chemical substitution induced distortion . even though transition metal is not the first , nor the second nearest neighbors of yb , as substitution increases , the distortion to the original cubic symmetry increase .",
    "this is consistent with our observation that the low - temperature rise only emerges with chemical substitution and becomes more pronounced in the middle of the doping range .",
    "an alternative scenario is that the upturn is of a kondo origin .",
    "however , that requires a decreasing cef split energies upon substitution and a very small first excited cef energy which was not observed in specific heat data .",
    "instead , the c@xmath39 feature stays unchanged for the majority of the substitution range which otherwise should also evolve and split .",
    "we would also like to mention a similar doping series : ceni@xmath71 ( @xmath72 = si , ge)@xcite .",
    "changing from ceni@xmath73ge@xmath45 to ceni@xmath73si@xmath45 , the kondo temperature increases from @xmath264 k to @xmath2670 k with ground state cef degeneracy changing from 4 for @xmath72 = ge to 6 for @xmath72 = si@xcite . upon doping",
    ", the coherence temperature drops quickly from both sides . in the middle of the doping ,",
    "specific heat shows continuous evolution from high @xmath19 , ge side , to the low @xmath19 , si side .",
    "understanding the suppression of kondo coherence in these two systems might offer useful insights into the formation of kondo coherence .",
    "in conclusion , we studied the evolution of kondo effect in yb(fe@xmath0co@xmath25)@xmath5zn@xmath3 via resistivity and specific heat measurements . with co substitution ,",
    "the kondo coherence temperature of ybfe@xmath5zn@xmath3 decreases gradually with emerging features in specific heat that can be associated with cef effect . on the ybco@xmath2zn@xmath3 side ,",
    "the coherence temperature is also suppressed at the beginning of fe substitution . in between ,",
    "0.4@xmath8x@xmath80.9 , cef features can be observed in both resistivity and specific heat data whereas showing no clear feature of coherence down to 500 mk .",
    "however , only qualitative information can be obtained in this middle region due to a large substitution level variation . comparing all the experimental results",
    ", the cef splitting stays roughly unchanged across the substitution series .",
    "the ground state of the compound evolves from a @xmath6 = 8 coherent state for ybfe@xmath5zn@xmath3 to a @xmath6 = 2 coherent state in ybco@xmath5zn@xmath3 .",
    "more measurements are needed to reveal the mechanism behind the suppression of coherence on the ybfe@xmath5zn@xmath3 and ybco@xmath5zn@xmath3 side .",
