    "in quantum chemistry , biophysics , and more recently in some problems in quantum computation , the time evolution of systems of large size and at high excitations is in the center of interest .",
    "generally , a full quantum treatment of such systems is practically impossible . in order to get a first insight into the behavior of such systems",
    ", they are usually propagated using the associated classical equations of motion .",
    "this approach , which disregards all possible quantum effects , is known as molecular dynamics ( md ) . often , the scales involved in a problem call for a semiclassical approximation where molecular dynamics would constitute the zeroth order . to next order , one obtains the well - known van vleck - gutzwiller propagator @xcite .",
    "this quantity is arguably one of the most fundamental elements of semiclassical theory .",
    "it constitutes , e.g. , the starting point for the derivation of the celebrated gutzwiller trace formula @xcite and also for the semiclassical reaction rate theory @xcite .",
    "traditionally , semiclassical methods have been developed in position representation .",
    "this implies , however , that i ) determinants arising from the projection along momentum appear in the prefactor , ii ) they are formulated in terms of double - sided boundary condition problems and iii ) are based on wave functions .",
    "thus , they do not speak the same language as classical mechanics , which certainly would be desirable in order to describe and study the quantum - classical transition @xcite . in view of these drawbacks ,",
    "semiclassical methods in phase space offer a conceptually clearer and possibly a numerically more efficient approach @xcite .    recently",
    ", significant progress has been achieved as to semiclassical approximations to the wigner propagator corresponding to the unitary quantum dynamical group .",
    "the case of damped nonunitary time evolution , giving rise to a semi - group , is different even in its basic mathematical structures and largely requires to reconsider the phase - space approach . in order to clearly distinguish the two cases",
    ", we shall use the term `` propagating function '' instead of `` propagator '' in the context of this semi - group .    to be sure , a semiclassical phase - space analysis of open quantum systems",
    "has recently been presented in the markovian limit @xcite on the basis of the lindblad master equation which can be extended to the general non - markovian case @xcite for a system bilinearly coupled to a bath consisting of harmonic oscillators . in order to illustrate the latter approach by means of an analytically solvable case , we here present a study of the damped harmonic oscillator in phase space .",
    "while certain aspects will turn out to be specific for this linear system , we expect the overall picture to be useful to understand the more general case of nonlinear systems for which details will be discussed elsewhere @xcite .    in an attempt to make the discussion accessible to readers with different backgrounds , we review in the next three sections the basic ideas of the semiclassical phase - space approach , the influence functional theory , and the quantum damped harmonic oscillator as far as they are needed for the following . section  [ sec : qdhophasespace ]",

    "we will argue that a gaussian broadening arises due to the nonlocal interaction of the system degree of freedom mediated by the coupling to the environment .",
    "furthermore , we demonstrate the nonclassical nature of the trajectories contributing within the phase - space path - integral representation of the wigner propagating function .",
    "before discussing the case of a damped quantum system , it is useful to fix the main ideas and the notation by considering the unitary time evolution of an isolated system degree of freedom in real space as well as in phase space . in later sections , we will be forced to employ a density operator to describe the state of a damped quantum system .",
