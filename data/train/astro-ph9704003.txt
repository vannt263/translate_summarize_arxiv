    "irregular x - ray variability is a common phenomenon of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) .",
    "the power spectra of the observed lightcurves exhibit an ` observational noise floor ' at high frequencies , an increase of power towards low frequencies ( @xmath0 behavior ) and , most often in long term lightcurves , a flat top at the low frequency end of the spectrum ( mchardy 1988 ) . as a commonly applied method",
    "the periodogram is used to estimate part of the power spectrum with a slope @xmath1 usually between 0 and 2 and a mean of about 1.5 ( lawrence and papadakis 1993 ) .    when the periodogram is computed , the window function ( the fourier transform of the observational sampling ) is convolved with to the true spectrum of the source .",
    "this can produce artefacts in the power spectrum , which make a proper interpretation more difficult ( papadakis and lawrence 1995 ; priestley 1992 ) . in the case of agn",
    "spectra the sidebands of the window function yield spectral leakage to higher frequencies which will cause the spectra to appear less steep and the spectral slope will be underestimated ( deeter and boynton 1982 ; deeter 1984 ) .",
    "consequently a model is required which operates in the time domain and avoids any misleading systematic effects . as an alternative approach",
    ", we have used the linear state space model ( lssm ) .",
    "the lssm is a generalization of the autoregressive ( ar ) model invented by yule ( 1927 ) to model the variability of wolf s sunspot numbers .",
    "the ar model expresses the temporal correlations of the time series in terms of a linear function of its past values plus a noise term and is closely related to the dynamics of the system .",
    "lssms generalize the ar processes by explicitly modelling observational noise .",
    "the variable @xmath2 that has to be estimated can not be observed directly since it is covered by observational noise @xmath3 .",
    "the measured observational variables @xmath4 do not generally agree with the system variables @xmath2 . thus an lssm is defined with two equations , the system or dynamical equation  ( [ eq : sys ] ) and the observation equation  ( [ eq : obs ] ) .",
    "@xmath5 this definition is a multivariate description , which means that the ar[p ] process is given as a @xmath6-dimensional ar process of order one , with a matrix @xmath7 that determines the dynamics .",
    "the matrix @xmath8 maps the unobservable dynamics to the observation .",
    "the terms @xmath9 and @xmath3 represent the gaussian dynamical noise with covariance matrix @xmath10 and the gaussian observational noise with variance @xmath11 , respectively . we have used the expectation - maximization algorithm to estimate the dynamics and a ks test to quantify the order of the hidden ar process ( honerkamp 1993 , knig and timmer 1997 ) .",
    "as the x - ray lightcurves from the x - ray satellite exosat are the longest existing observations of agn , we have used individual observations longer than 25ks to create an exosat agn timing sample ( see table  1 ) .",
    "we use the lightcurve of the seyfert galaxy ngc  5506 as an example for a brief description of how to apply lssm and interpret lssm results .",
    "we have found that the x - ray lightcurve of ngc  5506 can be well modelled with a lssm ar[1 ] model , since the residuals between the estimated ar[1 ] process and the measured data are consistent with gaussian white noise .",
    "the corresponding dynamical parameter of the lssm ar[1 ] fit corresponds to a relaxation time of about 1.6 hours .",
    "higher order lssm ar[p ] models can not improve the fits significantly .",
    "therefore more complex models ( with additional relaxators and damped oscillators ) are not needed to describe the dynamics of the agn lightcurve .",
    "in addition , an ar[1 ] model provides all features occuring in agn power spectra , especially the flat top at low frequencies which can not be described by the @xmath12 models ( knig and timmer 1997 ) .",
    "the physical interpretation of the discovered ar[1 ] dynamics is a stochastic superposition of single shots all decaying with the same relaxation time .",
    "the assumption of an exponentially decaying shot seems to be reasonable as time - dependent inverse comptonisation ( ic ) models lead to such a pulse profile ( liang and nolan 1983 ) . in this scenario",
    "inhomogeneities in the accretion flow produce single uv flares .",
    "these uv photons are then upscattered in the comptonising medium producing the observed x - ray energy spectrum .",
    "since harder x - ray photons need more interactions in the compton cloud and thus have experienced a longer stay in the medium , they are temporally delayed with respect to the soft x - ray photons .",
    "the lssm fits of the exosat agn sample yield a relationship between the spectral hardness ( expressed by the slope @xmath13 of the power - law fit of the photon spectrum ) , and the estimated relaxation time of the ar process ( table  1 ) , which might be a fingerprint of the ic process .",
    "the relation is derived to @xmath14  sec with a corresponding kendalls tau value of 0.744 and a two - sided significance level of @xmath15 for the hypothesis of uncorrelated data . since the @xmath16@xmath13 relation is independent of the agn type , a common physical mechanism for the spectral and temporal behavior",
    "is needed for all kinds of agn  possibly in support of the unifying model of active galactic nuclei ( netzer 1990 ) .",
