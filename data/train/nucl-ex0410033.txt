    "there are now four years of beam data on high  hadron spectra available from the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) covering multiple configurations ( p+p , d+au , au+au ) and beam energies ( 62.4 , 130 , 200 gev ) .",
    "the four rhic experiments , brahms , phenix , phobos and star have observed and reported on several striking features from this new era of collider data , where the high cross - section for pqcd hard - scattering processes plays an important role in heavy ion collisions for the first time . in particular , jets of high transverse momentum hadrons which come from the fragmentation of hard - scattered partons can be experimentally observed in heavy ion collisions using two - particle azimuthal correlations@xcite .",
    "the yield of single inclusive high  charged hadrons leading these jets is observed to be substantially suppressed ( by a factor of 3 - 5 for 6 gev / c ) in the most central au+au collisions at = 130 and 200 gev compared to the expectation from scaling the yield in p+p collisions at the same beam energy by the average number of binary nucleon - nucleon collisions in au+au@xcite .",
    "the yields in d+au collisions are slightly enhanced at intermediate  and consistent with binary - collision scaling for @xmath27 gev / c@xcite .",
    "detailed studies of the two - particle azimuthal correlations as a function of centrality in au+au collisions at = 200 gev reveal that the correlations at @xmath3 expected from the balancing partner jet created in the partonic hard - scattering become more and more suppressed in central au+au collisions in stark contrast to p+p and d+au collisions .",
    "the back - to - back partner of the di - jet effectively `` disappears '' into the bulk matter soft hadronic background generated in the collision@xcite .",
    "these features , along with the observed large azimuthal anisotropy of hadron distributions at large  in non - central au+au collisions@xcite , provide strong evidence that a dense , strongly interacting medium is formed in au+au collisions at rhic , substantially effecting the production and dynamics of jets which traverse it . in this article",

    "the addition of terms to account for finite transverse momentum  of the partons within the nucleus improves the agreement with the experimental data in both cases .",
    "the success of this description in describing the hadron spectra in p+p(@xmath6 ) collisions suggests that a similar formalism may be a useful starting point for the more complex systems : p(d)+a and a+a .",

    "the reference had to be derived from a compilation of the world s data on hadron production in p+p(@xmath6 ) collisions over a broad range of collision energies because no data exist at = 130 gev .",

    "the influence of nuclear gluon shadowing is shown within pqcd - i as the dashed lines of the left panel of figure [ fig3 ] .",

    "the fact that two models based on entirely different physics , one incorporating strong initial - state effects and one with strong final - state effects , can both explain the suppression data was the primary reason that d+au collisions were run at rhic .",

    "the enhancement observed for 26 gev / c is similar to the enhancement seen in p+a collisions at lower energies@xcite , called the `` cronin effect '' .",

    "the factor 4 - 5 suppression in central au+au collisions must be attributed to final - state , not initial - state nuclear effects .",

    "the features of the data are indeed reproduced , but hadronic interactions are found to contribute very little to the suppression for 6 gev / c , where inelastic , possibly colored partonic interactions of leading `` pre - hadrons '' with the dense medium are responsible for the observed suppression .",

    "interesting dynamics are clearly at play in the intermediate  region , which should be investigated more thoroughly .",
    "what is also clear is the importance of carrying all leading hadron observables , such as spectra , di - hadron correlations and azimuthal anisotropies to the highest  available and at minimum for 6 gev / c .",
    "this ensures that they can be used as reliable hard probes of the medium properties while minimizing complications from the dynamics of additional effects .",

    "it appears that there is no strong evolution of the suppression pattern as a function of pseudorapidity in au+au , while in figure [ fig8 ] there is a clear change from cronin enhancement at midrapidity to a suppression at forward rapidities in the au - going direction of d+au collisions .",
    "such a pattern is expected in saturation models@xcite but may not be a unique signature of gluon saturation .",
    "in fact , energy - momentum conservation in the hadron fragmentation region alone should result in a reduction of @xmath26 of about 30% between @xmath29 and @xmath30@xcite .",

    "the choice of beam energy was motivated by the fact that it lies roughly halfway between the sps and rhic top energies on a logarithmic scale and there exists a large body of reference data from p+p collisions at the isr at this beam energy@xcite .",
    "as it turns out , two key findings underscoring the importance of a reliable reference dataset have emerged from this exploration .",
    "first , a recent re - analysis of the parameterization used for the sps @xmath18 reference reveals large variations in the extracted @xmath18 depending on the choice of data and functional form used to fit them@xcite .",
    "in fact , a parameterization using the best fit to all of the available data results in @xmath18 for @xmath32 with 24 gev / c that is consistent ( within large uncertainties ) with binary collision scaling at = 17 gev .",
    "@xmath24 may even be slightly suppressed at the sps@xcite .",
    "second , it is challenging to find a reference spectrum within the isr datasets@xcite that has systematic uncertainties at the same level of precision as the rhic data . even compiling a composite spectrum from all available publications results in minimum systematic uncertainties of 20 - 30% .",
    "therefore , the significance of @xmath18 measurements at this beam energy may remain small until a reference run at rhic can be performed . nevertheless , given these large uncertainties , preliminary results presented at the rhic / ags users meeting in may 2004 show that even at = 62.4 gev there is substantial suppression for 6 gev / c@xcite .",
    "figure [ fig9 ] shows preliminary results on @xmath18 ( left ) and @xmath24 ( right ) for @xmath4 measured by the star experiment at midrapidity ( @xmath33 ) and slightly forward ( @xmath34)@xcite . the intermediate  region is less suppressed at = 62.4 gev than 200 gev , but for 6 gev / c , the suppression is comparable and may also be approximately -independent .",
    "this beam energy and -independence of @xmath18 is intriguing .",
    "one possibility is that it may be due simply to the interplay of the evolving power - law shape of the underlying partonic spectrum and the medium - induced energy loss for media of varying size and density@xcite . for central au+au at = 200 gev , calculations with a time - averaged transport coefficient of @xmath35=5 - 15 gev@xmath36/fm for the medium and a pqcd parton spectrum from pythia",
    "reproduce the observed @xmath18 for 5 gev / c and are -independent even to the highest accessible .",
    "this has intriguing consequences for @xmath18 at the lhc : the strong suppression in the denser , more opaque system expected in pb+pb collisions at = 5.5 tev is balanced by the shallower partonic spectrum , which results in more high  hadrons from hard - scatterings near the surface .",
    "the overall effect is @xmath18 with similar shape and magnitude at rhic and lhc , in contrast to other models@xcite .",
    "it is suggested that @xmath18 may only be able to set a lower limit for the system density when @xmath37 4 gev@xmath36/fm@xcite .    at = 62.4 gev ,",

    "the suppression is substantial , -independent and reasonably consistent with the preliminary data for 6 gev / c and with several other recently published predictions@xcite .",

    "systematic high - precision studies of single hadron inclusive spectra measured in p+p , d+au and au+au collisions at rhic have yielded several exciting observations : the -independent factor 4 - 5 suppression for 6 gev / c , the complex composition of hadron species at intermediate 26 gev / c and the possible beam energy independence of @xmath18(6gev / c ) for 62.4200 gev .",
