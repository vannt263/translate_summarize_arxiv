    "if the external environment is not rigid , the minimization problem also requires solving for the shape of the body .",
    "it is this latter category that shall be discussed in this paper , which we refer to as shape - order problems since they require simultaneous solution of both shape and ordering .",
    "one situation where the variable shape problem may occur is when droplets or shells of liquid crystalline phase are dispersed in an isotropic fluid . for thermotropic liquid crystals ,",

    "the mesh for a finite element approachmust be co - evolved during the minimization along with the boundary . in this paper , we discuss some initial explorations and propose a regularization scheme to address these difficulties .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : in section [ sec : model ] the numerical challenges in this class of problem are discussed and a regularization strategy proposed . in section [ sec : applications ] we apply this algorithm to two problems of increasing difficulty : in subsection [ sub : a - flexible - capacitor ] a flexible capacitor for which an analytical solution is available and in subsection [ sub : tactoids ] liquid crystal tactoids . conclusions and prospects for future work are presented in section [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "as an illustration of the challenges associated with shape minimization problems , consider perhaps the simplest possible example : minimize the length of a loop subject to a constant enclosed area of unity .",
    "the problem may be solved in discrete form by defining linear elements between adjacent points @xmath1 with @xmath2 $ ] and imposing a periodic condition @xmath3 .",
    "the program is then , @xmath4 by differentiating the target and constraint functionals , we obtain generalized forces @xmath5 and @xmath6 representing the generalized force on vertex @xmath7 exerted by the length functional and area constraint respectively . from an initial configuration @xmath8 ,",
    "the program ( [ eq : program ] ) is solved by taking gradient descent steps , @xmath9 where the component of @xmath10 that tends to change the area is subtracted off .",
    "the stepsize @xmath11 is determined by a line search , i.e. performing a 1d minimization of the energy functional with respect to @xmath11 .",
    "after each step , the solution is rescaled to have unit area .",
    "although simple , this algorithm is at the core of programs like _ surface evolver _ whose complexity arises from the wide variety of energy functionals available . to obtain a solution , the user performs a succession of relaxation steps from an initial guess to find a solution and is able to interactively refine the mesh .",

    "b * length of the line minus the analytical perimeter @xmath17 as a function of iteration .",
    "* c * stepsize determined from linesearches as a function of iteration . ]    if the initial guess is far from the solution , however , problems can occur . in fig .",
    "[ fig : noreg ] we display a minimization starting from an initial elliptical loop of aspect ratio @xmath18 and unit area .",
    "the solution converges toward the correct circular solution , but very slowly . in fig .",
    "[ fig : noreg]a , note that mesh points that started at the ends of the ellipse become bunched together .",
    "hence , even after @xmath16 iterations , only a relatively poor approximant to the circle has been found . in fig .",
    "[ fig : noreg]b the quantity @xmath19 is reported on log - linear scales as a function of iteration number , where @xmath20 is the length of the loop and @xmath21 is the analytical perimeter of a circle with unit area . for a good initial guess , this quantity should converge exponentially , i.e. @xmath22 with some rate @xmath23 and hence would appear on this plot as a straight line ; the line observed shows that the convergence is subexponential .",
    "the reason for this is apparent from a plot of the stepsize @xmath11 as a function of iteration , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : noreg]c , that shows that the algorithm is forced to take smaller and smaller steps as the points become bunched together .",
    "bunching arises because the solution of the program ( [ eq : program ] ) possesses a null space with respect to the position of the vertices .",
    "suppose all vertices other than @xmath1 are fixed , but the @xmath7th vertex is perturbed @xmath24 where @xmath25 is a unit vector .",
    "expanding the length of a loop as a series in @xmath26 we obtain , @xmath27 the change in length can be cancelled to linear order if the direction of the perturbation is chosen to be perpendicular to the second factor in the dot product .",
    "the factor in question is , by definition , the generalized force acting on the vertex @xmath7 . at equilibrium , this must balance the force due to the area constraint , which always points along the normal .",
    "hence , for the solution of ( [ eq : program ] ) , the nullspace lies for each vertex locally along the tangent line .",
    "the existence of the nullspace reveals that the problem is underconstrained , and this characteristic is generic for shape evolution problems .",
    "for instance , if the interior of the loop were to be meshed as well , the position of these additional mesh points does not enter the program ( [ eq : program ] ) , and so they would not be moved .",
    "moreover , it is an issue fundamentally associated with the discrete system as the continuous functional possesses a unique solution .",

    "this is effective , but means that the number of mesh points can not be controlled as easily and requires discrete changes to the mesh . here",
    ", we propose a different solution that allows continuous regularization of the mesh .",
    "the idea is to supplement the minimization problem with an auxiliary functional that captures our intuition of mesh quality . for the present problem ,",
    "a suitable functional is , @xmath32\\label{eq : regularization}\\ ] ] where @xmath33 , i.e. the mean length of the two linear elements at point @xmath7 . this functional favors equally spaced mesh points . by differentiating the regularization functional",
    ", a corresponding generalized force @xmath34 may be obtained .",
    "it is essential that the regularization functional does not interfere with the solution of the program ( [ eq : program ] ) , so the regularization functional is minimized separately in the nullspace of the target functional , i.e ensuring that @xmath35 .",
    "following each gradient descent step eq .",
    "( [ eq : gradientdescent ] ) , a regularization step is then taken ,    @xmath36    where the regularization stepsize @xmath31 is found by performing a linesearch on the regularization functional ( [ eq : regularization ] ) .    execution of this algorithm on the same elliptical initial configuration as above yields a plot displayed in figure [ fig : reg]a that has converged onto the correct circular solution with the mesh points are approximately evenly spaced as desired .",
    "inspection of the length as a function of iteration @xmath19 in figure [ fig : reg]b shows that the algorithm converges exponentially , within around @xmath14 iterations , even from this poor initial guess .",
    "while the new algorithm involves approximately twice the work per iteration , i.e. an additional force evaluation and line search , this is clearly a considerable improvement over the naive algorithm .",
    "the value of the @xmath37 is shown in figure [ fig : reg]c indicating that the solution is not fully converged with respect to the regularization functional .",
    "while the stepsizes @xmath11 and @xmath38displayed in figure [ fig : reg]d and [ fig : reg]e respectivelyare very different in value and rather noisy , it is apparent that they remain approximately constant with iteration , explaining the fast convergence .",
    "the strategy developed for the very simple problem considered in the present section is readily usable to any combination of target functionals , constraints and regularization functionals .",
    "in particular , it is also applicable to problems where the minimization must be performed not only on the shape of the domain but on field quantities defined upon it ; it is to such a problem that we turn in the following section .",
    "we now examine a more complex problem , a cylindrical capacitor made from flexible electrodes shown schematically in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : conformal]a . normal capacitors with rigid plates held at fixed potential difference experience a force that tends to separate the plates . here , the capacitor is initially circular in the absence of an electric field and tends to elongate in the vertical direction when a potential difference is applied to the terminals .",
    "the device is filled with an incompressible fluid dielectric and so maintains a constant area .",
    "the energy functional contains three terms , a line tension that minimizes droplet circumference , the electrostatic energy resulting from the electric field , and an anchoring energy used to enforce a boundary value @xmath39 without discontinuities on the electric potential , @xmath40 this is to be minimized on a 2d domain @xmath41 with respect to the electric potential @xmath42 and the shape of the boundary @xmath43 , subject to fixed area , @xmath44 the parameters @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 represent the surface tension , anchoring and electrostatic energies respectively ; @xmath48 is a length of the order of the size of the droplet .",
    "note that this problem is easily transformed into a liquid crystal problem by replacing the electric potential with the director angle @xmath49 , modifying the elastic term to include variable elastic constants and replacing @xmath50 with a spatially varying easy axis .",

    "there are two dimensionless parameters , @xmath55 , which represents the ratio of line tension to applied field , and @xmath56 , which represents the relative importance of anchoring and electric forces .",
    "the problem is discretized using a conventional finite element approach : the domain is represented by an initially circular mesh with triangular elements .",
    "the potential @xmath42 is represented on the vertices and a linear interpolation is used on the interior of the triangles , hence @xmath57 is constant in each triangular element . using this discretization ,",

    "formulae for these expressions are available in standard finite element textbooks ; we do not supply them here . from these , it is possible to obtain the generalized force @xmath58 acting on each vertex of the mesh , and also a scalar generalized force @xmath59 acting on the field .",
    "boundary vertices experience a contribution to the force from all terms in ( [ eq : energy - nodim ] ) ; the interior vertices only experience forces due to the electrostatic term . because of this , it is clear that the problem is underconstrained with respect to the interior vertices .",

    "<S> we apply this algorithm to a flexible capacitor , as well as to determine the shape of liquid crystal tactoids as a function of the surface tension and elastic constants . </S>",
    "<S> these are compared with theoretical predictions and experimental observations of tactoids from the literature . </S>"
