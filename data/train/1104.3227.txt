    "<S> recently nelson _ et al . _ proposed an interesting flavor symmetric model to account for the top quark forward - backward asymmetry and the dijet anomaly at cdf simultaneously with just three parameters : a coupling constant of order one , and two scalar masses of 160 gev and 220 gev . </S>",
    "<S> however these fiducial values of the parameters lead to the branching ratio of a almost pure penguin @xmath0 decay about one hundred times larger than the experimental results . </S>",
    "<S> consider also the precision electroweak constraints , the scalar masses should be at least around 500 gev . actually with the coupling constant larger than one , it is impossible to explain either of the two cdf measurements consistently in this model . </S>",
    "<S> but one may raise the charged scalar mass to , for example , @xmath1 gev and reduce the coupling strength to @xmath2 to meet the b physics constraints . with this parameter set </S>",
    "<S> , the wjj cross section is found to be in the right range . </S>",
    "<S> but due to the scalar mass splitting , its correction to t - parameter is about @xmath3 away from the precision electroweak constraints . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the top quark forward - backward asymmetry should be well below @xmath4 with this small coupling constant .    </S>",
    "<S> the cdf collaboration has recently updated the measurements on the forward - backward asymmetry in top quark pair production with a larger data sample about @xmath5 fb@xmath6@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , deviations from the standard model ( sm ) predictions are observed in the total forward - backward asymmetry both in the semi - leptonic @xmath7 data and in the di - lepton channel . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , a distributional measurement found that @xmath8 in the @xmath9 rest frame , which deviates from the qcd correction prediction @xmath10 by @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> the cdf collaboration has also reported another @xmath12 anomaly in the @xmath13 gev range of the invariant dijet mass distribution in association with a w boson @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> a flavor symmetric model was proposed in @xcite to explain simultaneously the @xmath7 asymmetry and wjj excess at cdf . </S>",
    "<S> gauge boson , though the predicted total cross section of @xmath9 production seems to be too small at the tevatron ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) ] a @xmath14 triplet of complex scalar fields @xmath15 is introduced in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these color - singlet weak - doublet scalars respect the flavor symmetry : @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 have charge @xmath19 under @xmath20 and @xmath21 , respectively , while @xmath22 is in a fundamental representation of @xmath23 . </S>",
    "<S> this flavor symmetry is also preserved in the sm without yukawa interactions .    in this model </S>",
    "<S> the interaction of the scalars @xmath24 with the sm quarks are completely determined by the flavor symmetry with a universal coupling strength . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath25 anomaly can then be interpreted as @xmath26 via a s - channel @xmath27 exchange , and @xmath28 decays subsequently to a jet pair with its mass to be around @xmath29 gev . </S>",
    "<S> the top quark forward - backward asymmetry can be explained by @xmath30 via a t - channel @xmath31 exchange and @xmath32 via a t - channel @xmath33 exchange . at first glance </S>",
    "<S> , this seems to be in contradiction with the observation of @xcite that t - channel exchange of a color - singlet scalar has great difficulty to produce a large positive contribution to the top quark forward - backward asymmetry . </S>",
    "<S> however a closer look at fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 of @xcite reveals that there does have a narrow window with the scalar mass lighter than @xmath1 gev </S>",
    "<S> .    however this flavor symmetry model also contributes to hadronic b decays . </S>",
    "<S> although there is no new cp phase introduced , we will show in the following that the effective operator @xmath34 via an exchange of such a light @xmath24 is constrained severely by the penguin dominant processes , such as @xmath0 decays .    in this flavor symmetry model , </S>",
    "<S> the color - singlet weak - doublet scalars @xmath24 are charged @xmath35 under @xmath36 and singlets under @xmath37 . </S>",
    "<S> the interaction between @xmath38 and the sm quarks @xcite @xmath39 is completely determined by the flavor symmetry in which @xmath38 ( @xmath40 ) are charged as @xmath41 under @xmath42 , and charged as @xmath43 under @xmath44 . </S>",
    "<S> then the only free parameters are the coupling constant @xmath45 and the scalar masses @xmath46 and @xmath47 .    to interpret </S>",
    "<S> the cdf anomalies of wjj and forward - backward asymmetry of top quark , @xmath48 , @xmath49 gev and @xmath50 gev have been chosen in @xcite as `` fiducial '' values . </S>",
    "<S> however in the mass basis , eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : interaction ] ) also generates effective four fermion operators , among which contains @xmath51 as noticed in @xcite , this operator contributes to the charmless process @xmath52 in comparison to the relevant effective hamiltonian of the sm ( where electroweak penguin operators have been neglected ) @xcite @xmath53 with @xmath54 since eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : bsuu ] ) is obtained at tree level , we will also consider the wilson coefficients in the sm at leading order . </S>",
    "<S> matching the effective operators to the full theory at @xmath55 , one finds @xmath56 and other wilson coefficients to be zero at leader order in the sm . </S>",
    "<S> but the flavor symmetry model contributes to @xmath57 as @xmath58 which is even comparable to @xmath59 in the magnitude .    running the scale down from @xmath60 to @xmath61 , one finds in the sm @xmath62 but </S>",
    "<S> when the new scalar contributions are included , the wilson coefficients @xmath63(@xmath64 ) are changed to be @xmath65 one may easily notice that @xmath66 is surprisingly large in this flavor symmetry model . </S>",
    "<S> even considering the theoretical uncertainties on hadronic b decays , it will lead to too large branching ratios on the penguin dominant decays , such as @xmath0 channels as we will show immediately .    </S>",
    "<S> for charmless b decays , there are three factorization approaches being widely used : qcd factorization @xcite , the perturbative qcd method ( pqcd ) @xcite and soft collinear effective theory ( scet ) @xcite . here </S>",
    "<S> we will adopt qcd factorization method . </S>",
    "<S> notice that the new physics amplitude is calculated at tree level , correspondingly the wilson coefficients are calculated at leading logarithm . to be consistent , </S>",
    "<S> the decay amplitudes of qcd factorization are also evaluated at leading order of @xmath67 . </S>",
    "<S> let s consider the almost pure penguin process @xmath68 decay . </S>",
    "<S> taking @xmath69 mev , the form factor @xmath70 @xcite , the current quark mass @xmath71 mev @xcite and the relevant ckm parameters @xcite @xmath72 , @xmath73 , we obtain @xmath74 which is about one hundred times larger than the experimental measurement @xmath75 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> therefore the fiducial values of @xmath48 , @xmath50 gev taken by nelson _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . _ </S>",
    "<S> @xcite are apparently inconsistent with the penguin dominant b decays .     </S>",
    "<S> branching ratio of @xmath68 decay as a function of the mass of charged scalar @xmath76 . </S>",
    "<S> the blue band shows the experimental measurements , while the red curve represents the predicted branching ratio including new physics contributions and the horizontal purple line denotes the sm predictions at leading order of @xmath67 . ]    in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:1 ] , we show the branching ratio of @xmath68 decay as a function of @xmath47 with the coupling strength @xmath45 fixed . </S>",
    "<S> it indicates that the charged scalars should be heavier than about @xmath77 gev to be consistent with the charmless b decays . </S>",
    "<S> noticed that the leading order sm prediction is about half less than the experimental measurements , as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:1 ] . </S>",
    "<S> this is because next - to - leading order amplitudes are not small in qcd factorization method , especially for chirally enhanced power corrections and annihilation diagrams ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> but for the purpose of this paper , it should be enough to be confined at leading order .    </S>",
    "<S> the cdf dijet anomaly was explained in this flavor symmetry model by the process @xmath78 via s - channel @xmath79 exchange , with the cross section to be about @xmath80 pb . </S>",
    "<S> now to satisfy b physics constraints , the charged scalar masses have to be raised from @xmath81 gev to around @xmath77 gev . as a result </S>",
    "<S> , the corresponding cross section must be well below @xmath82 pb , which is too small to account for the cdf dijet excess . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , keeping @xmath48 and @xmath49 gev unchanged while rasing the mass of charged scalars to @xmath83 gev , one might worry about its correction to the electroweak parameter @xcite @xmath84 which turns out to be @xmath85 . </S>",
    "<S> notice that @xmath86 gev is taken in the above formula . </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately this strongly contradicts the precision electroweak constraint @xcite @xmath87 assuming the higgs mass @xmath88 gev . </S>",
    "<S> therefore the mass splitting between the charged and the neutral scalars should be quite small to satisfy the precision electroweak constraint , which means the neutral scalar masses should also be raised from @xmath29 gev to around @xmath89 gev . </S>",
    "<S> for the color - singlet scalars in this mass range , one can see from fig . 2 of @xcite that the total forward - backward asymmetry of produced top pair may even be negative , which is opposite in sign to the experimental observations .    </S>",
    "<S> another possibility is to reduce the coupling strength @xmath45 , and at the same time raising the charged scalar mass moderately to satisfy the constraints of electroweak parameter t and charmless b decays simultaneously . noticed that taking the neutral scalar mass fixed at @xmath29 gev , its correction to @xmath90 is @xmath91 with @xmath92 gev , which corresponds to @xmath93 . </S>",
    "<S> this already deviates from the precision electroweak constraint @xmath87 by more than @xmath94 sigma . </S>",
    "<S> but if the standard model higgs is very heavy , it will contribute negatively to the @xmath95 parameter . keeping only leading logarithms in the higgs mass , </S>",
    "<S> the contribution can be expressed approximately as @xcite @xmath96 where @xmath97 denotes the reference value of the higgs mass . </S>",
    "<S> this means , for the sm higgs as heavy as @xmath82 tev , the precision electroweak constraint on t parameter would be around @xmath98 , which is consistent with the flavor symmetric model with @xmath92 gev .    in any case </S>",
    "<S> , it is unlikely for the charged scalar mass in this model to be heavier than @xmath1 gev . </S>",
    "<S> one may observe from fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:2 ] that , taking @xmath92 gev , @xmath45 should be around @xmath2 to satisfy the restriction of @xmath68 decay . </S>",
    "<S> notice that it was shown in @xcite that in this model the top quark forward - backward asymmetry @xmath99 for @xmath100 gev with @xmath48 . </S>",
    "<S> it is then clear that this asymmetry must be well below @xmath4 if the coupling constant @xmath45 is lowered to around @xmath2 </S>",
    "<S> . therefore it should be really hard , if not impossible , to explain the measured large forward - backward asymmetry of produced top pair under this circumstance .    as to the wjj anomaly , </S>",
    "<S> the resonant production @xmath101 which subsequently decays to @xmath102 can enhance the wjj cross section . </S>",
    "<S> it is easy to calculate first the decay width of @xmath79 , @xmath103 with the phase factor @xmath104 . </S>",
    "<S> correspondingly , the wjj cross section is found to be @xmath105 pb for @xmath106 . actually , the wjj cross section from resonant @xmath79 production is not very sensitive to the value of @xmath45 , because the total width of @xmath79 also changes with @xmath45 . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , the cross section is calculated to be @xmath107 pb with even smaller @xmath108 .     branching ratio of @xmath68 decay as a function of the coupling strength @xmath45 , with the charged and neutral scalar masses taken at @xmath1 gev and @xmath29 gev , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the meaning of the lines is the same as in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:1 ] . ]    in summary , we consider the constraints of charmless b decays on a flavor symmetric scalar model proposed in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the color - singlet weak - doublet scalars are introduced in the model which respects the flavor symmetry of @xmath109 . </S>",
    "<S> it was shown in @xcite that the top quark forward - backward asymmetry and the dijet excess at cdf could be explained simultaneously with the parameters chosen as @xmath48 , @xmath49 gev and @xmath50 gev . </S>",
    "<S> however the flavor symmetry of the scalars also contributes to @xmath110 decays . with the above fiducial values of the parameters , the pure penguin decay @xmath68 is predicted to have a branching ratio about one hundred times larger than the experimental results . </S>",
    "<S> to avoid this constraint , the charged scalars should be heavier than around @xmath77 gev with @xmath48 fixed . as a result </S>",
    "<S> , the production cross section of dijet plus a w boson would be too small to account for the cdf dijet excess . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the precision electroweak constraints force the neutral scalar masses to be also around @xmath89 gev . </S>",
    "<S> then it also becomes hard for this model to account for the forward - backward asymmetry in top quark pair production .    </S>",
    "<S> another possibility is to raise the charged scalar mass so that @xmath111 decay channel is allowed kinematically . in this scenario </S>",
    "<S> the wjj cross section is enhanced due to the resonant production of @xmath112 so that the coupling constant @xmath45 may be lowered to evade the b physics constraint . specifically , one may take @xmath92 gev , @xmath49 gev and @xmath106 . with this parameter </S>",
    "<S> set , the wjj cross section is found to be @xmath94 pb , which is in the right range to explain the cdf dijet excess . </S>",
    "<S> but the scalar mass splitting will contribute to @xmath113 , which is about @xmath3 deviation from the precision electroweak constraint . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the smaller coupling strength will lead to too small @xmath9 forward - backward asymmetry to account for the experimental measurements . </S>"
