    "since their discovery during the 1980s , much progress has been made on the study of high - temperature superconductors .",
    "these materials are classified as type ii superconductors , for which there is only a partial meissner effect when the external magnetic field is in the range @xmath3 @xcite . inside the superconductors ,",
    "the magnetic field survives in the form of quantized flux lines ( fls ) , called vortices , each with a quantum unit of flux @xmath4 .",
    "the vortices form a periodic hexagonal lattice ( abrikosov lattice ) at low temperatures and melt into a vortex liquid at higher temperatures @xcite .",
    "high - temperature superconductors are ceramic materials which have the common structure of layered superconducting copper - oxide planes .",
    "they are anisotropic materials , with anisotropy defined as @xmath5 , where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the effective masses of electrons moving perpendicular to the superconducting planes and along to them respectively .",
    "one of the commonly studied materials bi@xmath0sr@xmath0cacu@xmath0o@xmath1 , known as bscco , is highly anisotropic .",
    "it is estimated to has an anisotropy in the range of 300 - 500 for optimally doped samples .    in high anisotropic materials ,",
    "vortices can be described as stacks of pancake vortices @xcite .",
    "the `` pancakes '' are centered at their corresponding planes and can only move within their own planes .",
    "the interaction between the pancakes consists of two parts : the electromagnetic interaction and the josephson interaction .",
    "the electromagnetic interaction originates from the screening currents that arise in the same plane where a pancake resides as well as in more distant planes .",
    "it is repulsive among pancakes in the same plane and attractive for those in different planes @xcite .",
    "this interaction exists even in the case where the superconducting planes are completely decoupled , so no current can flow along the @xmath8 axis ( perpendicular to the planes ) of the sample .",
    "the josephson interaction @xcite originates from the josephson current flowing between the superconducting planes , which is proportional to the sine of the gauge invariant phase difference between two planes @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the phase of the superconducting order parameter and @xmath11 is the vector potential .",
    "when two pancakes belonging to the same stack and residing in adjacent planes move away from each other , the phase difference that originates causes a josephson current to begin flowing between the planes .",
    "this results in an attractive interaction between pancakes that for distances small compared to @xmath12 is approximately quadratic @xcite in the distance . here",
    "we denoted by @xmath13 the inter - plane separation .",
    "when the two adjacent pancakes are separated by a distance larger than @xmath14 , a `` josephson string '' is formed , whose energy is proportional to its length @xcite .",
    "recently the effect of columnar defects ( cds ) on the melting transition was investigated both experimentally @xcite and numerically @xcite .",
    "columnar defects can be induced artificially by irradiating the sample with high energy heavy ions , like 1 gev lead ions .",
    "the heat released by the ions create tubes of damaged , non - conducting material .",
    "it is customary to measure the density of cds by the value of the `` matching field '' by @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the number of cds per unit area . in the limit @xmath17 the vortex solid becomes a bose glass as most fls are trapped by cds located at random positions @xcite . on the other hand",
    "our interest is in the case @xmath18 , in which there are more fls than cds . in this case",
    "the picture that emerged from experiments @xcite and from numerical investigations @xcite and analytical calculations @xcite is that of the `` crystallites in the pores '' , also referred to as the `` porous '' vortex solid . at low temperatures a skeleton ( or matrix ) of vortices localized on cds",
    "is formed , while the excess ( interstitial ) fls try to form hexagonal crystallites in the lacuna between cds .",
    "thus this phase has a short ranged translational order , which extends to a distance of the order of a typical pore size .    as the temperature",
    "is increased , and if the magnetic field is large enough , this heterogeneous structure melts in two stages : first the crystallites in the pores melt into a nanoliquid while the skeleton remain intact , and subsequently the skeleton melts and the liquid becomes homogeneous . when the magnetic field is lowered",
    "these two transitions coincide into one .",
    "this is usually associated with a kink in the first order melting line .",
    "the first stage melting of the crystallites is observed in the experiments as a step in the equilibrium local magnetization @xcite and in the simulations as a sharp increase in the transverse fluctuations of the fls , among other signatures .",
    "the second transition was not observed in the experiments as a similar jump in the magnetization or another equilibrium property .",
    "it was observed in transport measurement @xcite involving transport currents with alternating polarity .",
    "this establishes the transition as dynamical in nature .",
    "it remains to be established that this is also an equilibrium thermodynamic transition . in order to support this assertion",
    "it was argued @xcite that the second `` delocalization '' transition is associated with the restoration of a broken longitudinal gauge symmetry .",
    "however , at this time it can not be ruled out that the second transition is only a crossover associated with a gradual equilibrium change over a finite range of temperatures .",
    "recently one of us published a short paper @xcite reporting on multilevel monte carlo simulations of the vortex matter in the highly anisotropic high - temperature superconductor bscco .",
    "we introduced low concentration of columnar defects satisfying @xmath19 . both the electromagnetic and josephson interactions among pancake vortices",
    "were included .",
    "the nanocrystalline , nanoliquid , and homogeneous liquid phases were identified in agreement with experiments .",
    "we observed the two - step melting process and also noted an enhancement of the structure factor just prior to the melting transition .",
    "we also proposed a simple theoretical model to explain some of the findings . in this paper",
    "we would like to give more details of the simulation results but we use a different method than in the previous work , i.e. we use molecular dynamics instead of multilevel monte carlo .",
    "this enables us to carry out dynamical measurements that clearly identifies the second melting transition ( delocalization ) .",
    "we also report in this paper simulations of tilted columnar defects .",
    "a short summary of our findings for tilted defects has recently been submitted @xcite .",
    "molecular dynamics ( md ) is a powerful tool for simulations of physical systems and it often serves as an alternative to monte carlo ( mc ) simulations .",
    "its advantage is that it can be used to investigate the real dynamics of the system as opposed to mc simulations that are used for obtaining equilibrium properties .",
    "however md simulations could be plagued by the absence of ergodicity when applied to systems represented by path integrals @xcite and there is also the problem of implementing permutations for the case of identical particles like bosons .",
    "the problem of ergodicity is really not much of an issue for langevin simulations since the thermal noise helps the system explore the configuration space and it can be shown by using the corresponding fokker - planck equation that equilibrium is reached in the long time limit . for flux - lines",
    "we have found a way to implement `` permutations '' in the md simulations by flux cutting and recombining and this was explained in a recent publication @xcite which reported on md simulations of the melting transition in pure bscco without columnar or point defects .",
    "we were also able to implement periodic boundary conditions in all directions ( including the @xmath20 direction ) , and to include the in and out of plane electromagnetic interaction as well as the josephson interaction using the new approximation we have recently obtained @xcite .",
    "results for the first - order melting transitions in bscco for fields of 100 - 200 gauss were found to be in an excellent agreement with the results of our previous multilevel monte carlo simulations @xcite including the proliferation of non - simple loops corresponding to flux entanglement above the melting transition . in this paper",
    "we extend the md simulations to systems with columnar defects , both for the case that the columns are parallel to the c - axis and for the case when the columns are tilted at an angle @xmath21 with respect to the c - axis .",
    "the external field is taken to be aligned along the c - axis .",
    "we would like to check if the location of the melting transition in the b - t plane is sensitive to the tilting angle of the columnar defects .",
    "recently experiments were carried out to investigate this problem @xcite .",
    "the conclusions were that while static thermodynamical signatures like the location of the melting and delocalization lines do not depend ( within the experimental errors ) on the angle between the applied field and the columnar defects , non - equilibrium properties like the position of the irreversibility line do depend on the angle .",
    "in this paper we use the london - langevin molecular dynamics simulation method .",
    "the details of the simulation method , for a system without columnar defects is given in our previous paper @xcite .",
    "here we summarize the main ingredients of the method .",
    "the equation of motion for the @xmath22th pancake vortex is @xmath23 the pancake label @xmath22 stands actually for two indices @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the plane label and @xmath26 is the pancake label in that plane .",
    "the position @xmath27 is a two component vector in the plane .",
    "we use the over - damped model for vortex motion in which the velocity of the vortex is proportional to the applied force and @xmath28 is the viscous drag coefficient per unit length given by the bardeen - stephen expression @xcite . in eq.([langevin ] ) @xmath13 is the interlayer spacing between cuo@xmath0 planes that is taken to be equal to the width of the pancake vortex .",
    "@xmath29 is the potential energy depending on the position of all pancakes and includes both the magnetic energy and josephson energy , and the interaction between a pancake and the columnar defects .",
    "the force is minus the gradient of the potential energy with respect to the position of the @xmath22th pancake .",
    "@xmath30 is a driving force ( if present ) , for example the lorentz force induced by a current .",
    "@xmath31 is a white thermal noise term which satisfies @xmath32 in eq.([noise ] ) @xmath33 and @xmath34 refer to the @xmath35 and @xmath36 components of the vector @xmath37 and @xmath22 and @xmath38 are pancake labels .",
    "@xmath39 is boltzmann s constant . in the simulations we use a discrete form of the dirac delta - function .",
    "we measure distances in units of @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the magnetic field .",
    "we measure energy in units of @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the basic energy scale per unit length and @xmath44 is the penetration depth .",
    "we measure time in units of @xmath45 .",
    "for example for @xmath46 and @xmath47 , @xmath48  , @xmath49erg @xmath50 k / k . ref .",
    "[ ] quotes a value for @xmath28 for a single crystal bscco of around @xmath51 g/(cm s ) .",
    "based on this value the time unit is about @xmath52 ns . these values change when the temperature and field are varied .",
    "the simulation cell was chosen to have a rectangular cross section of size @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the number of flux lines ( number of pancake vortices in each plane ) .",
    "we usually worked with 36 flux lines but to check for finite size effect we also used 64 fls in some simulations .",
    "the aspect ratio of the cell was chosen to accommodate a triangular lattice without distortion , such that each triangle is equilateral .",
    "in the z - direction we take @xmath55 layers of width @xmath13 each , where in practice we have chosen @xmath55 to be 36 or 200 , as will be indicated below .",
    "thus the number of pancakes used is from 1296 up to 7200 .",
    "note that our system is effectively bigger since every pancake interacts not only with all other pancakes in the simulation cell but with infinitely many images of these pancakes in neighboring cells in all directions .",
    "the electromagnetic ( em ) interaction occurs between any pair of pancakes . to produce more realistic results for the small system simulated",
    "we have implemented periodic boundary conditions ( pbc ) in all directions including the z - direction .",
    "periodic boundary conditions mean that every pancake interact not only with the actual pancakes in the simulation cell but also with all their images in other cells which are part of an infinite periodic array",
    ". each image of a pancake is located at the same position in the corresponding cell as the original pancake in the simulation cell .",
    "the details are explained in ref .",
    "the final expression we used for the pair energy of two pancakes with fully implemented pbc is @xmath56\\!,\\nonumber\\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for pancakes in different planes separated by a vertical distance @xmath57 and a lateral separation @xmath58 , and similarly @xmath59\\!,\\nonumber\\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for pancakes in the same plane . the functions @xmath60 and @xmath61 represent the periodic screened and bare greens functions for the coulomb interactions in 2d and are given in the appendix of ref .  [ ] .",
    "the factor @xmath62 comes from the summation of the em interaction between a pancake and another pancake in the same cell and all its images along the z - direction .",
    "it is given by @xmath63 where we put @xmath64 .",
    "the dependence of @xmath62 on @xmath65 is rather weak .",
    "the approximations are valid provided @xmath66 .",
    "we have also implemented the josephson interaction among adjacent pancakes belonging to the same fl @xcite .",
    "the approximate formula we use is based on our recent paper that derives a numerical solution to the nonlinear sine gordon equation in two dimensions @xcite .",
    "the formula interpolates between an @xmath67 dependence for small @xmath68 to @xmath69 dependence for large @xmath68 , where @xmath68 is the lateral separation of the pancakes , @xmath70 , @xmath71 is the anisotropy and @xmath13 is the inter - plane separation .",
    "this interpolation is an modification of a similar interpolation formula previously used by ryu , doniach , deutscher and kapitulnik @xcite .",
    "the josephson interaction diminishes with increasing anisotropy , and we choose the anisotropy parameter to be 375 to obtain reasonable agreement with recent experiment on pristine melting . in this work",
    "we neglect josephson interaction between pancakes belonging to different stacks because on the average those pancakes are farther away .",
    "in addition we view the stack as the collection of pancakes carrying the unit quantum of flux from one side of the sample to the other .",
    "since the josephson interaction is proportional to the gauge invariant phase difference @xmath72 , the second term involving the vector potential will be larger for pancakes belonging to the same stack than to pancakes belonging to different stacks .",
    "this argument works in the solid phase but not deep into the liquid phase where eventually stacks may lose their meaning , especially if the density of pancakes is large so the average distance is much smaller than @xmath44 ( high temperatures and high fields ) .",
    "since the josephson interaction is between nearest neighbor pancakes in adjacent planes it is quite straight forward to implement pbc .",
    "a pancake at the top plane ( @xmath73 ) interacts with the closest pancake in the bottom plane @xmath74 as well as with a pancake in plane @xmath75 .",
    "when calculating the lateral distance between pancakes we always measure the `` shortest distance '' defined as follows : if the actual @xmath76 separation is larger than @xmath77 we subtract or add @xmath78 depending on the sign of @xmath79 , and similarly for @xmath80 with @xmath81 replacing @xmath78 . this way the correct distance",
    "is obtained even when the adjacent pancake in the plane above has exited the simulation cell and emerged close to the other side of the simulation cell .    in the case of @xmath82 ,",
    "string - string interactions that involve three and four - body interactions become important @xcite . however near the melting transition for the range of magnetic fields investigated in this paper @xmath83  whereas @xmath84 . thus large transverse fluctuations for which the string - string interactions become important are statistically rare and",
    "can be neglected . even in the case of tilted cds",
    "we verified that the kinks present ( see later discussion ) are not fully developed josephson strings .",
    "thus in this work we do not include string - string interactions .",
    "the modeling of the interaction between pancakes and cds was discussed by goldschmidt and cuansing @xcite .",
    "there are two major sources of pinning : core pinning and em pinning .",
    "core pinning @xcite arises when the vortex core overlaps with a normal state inclusion similar to the one inside a cd .",
    "since condensation energy is lost in the vortex core , part or all of this energy is restored when a vortex resides inside a cd .",
    "em pinning arises @xcite when the supercurrent pattern around the vortex is disturbed by the non - conducting defect .",
    "these two mechanisms combine together to yield the expression for the potential energy at a distance @xmath68 away from the cd as felt by an individual pancake @xcite : @xmath85,\\ \\ r >",
    "\\epsilon_0 d\\ \\ln\\left[1-\\left(\\frac{r_r}{r_r+\\xi/\\sqrt{2}}\\right)^2\\right],\\ \\ r < r_r , \\end{array}\\right .    \\label{eq : bind}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath86 is the radius of the cd .",
    "the long range tail contribution @xmath87 is due mainly to the em pinning and the short range flat region of depth @xmath88 is due to the combined effects of em and core pinning .",
    "this formula is valid provided @xmath89 . if @xmath90 a slightly different expression should be used , but we have determined , see below , that in order to get good agreement with experiments we need to use @xmath89 . note that in this expression @xmath91 is temperature dependent and is proportional to @xmath92 . for example the pinning strength reduces to realistic values of 113 k at t=80 k and 79k at t=83k assuming @xmath93k .",
    "after experimenting with cds of different radii ( @xmath94 nm @xmath95 nm ) we concluded that in order to obtain a good agreement with experimental results we needed to choose @xmath96 nm in which case the formula given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : bind ] ) is the correct one .",
    "different heavy ions with different energies give rise to tracks of various sizes , normally reported to be in the range of @xmath97 nm in diameter .",
    "it may be that the actual damage caused by a track exceeds its apparent size , thus leading to a higher effective radius .",
    "for tilted cds it may be appropriate to take a potential with an elliptical cross section rather than a circular one . since our simulations for tilted cds are mainly for angles of @xmath2 which are not that large and since the radius of our cds is already larger than the actual experimental radius , we did not use elliptical cross sections in the present simulations .",
    "the simulation cell is divided into a @xmath98 mesh of small cells of area @xmath99 each , where @xmath100 ( in units of @xmath101 ) .",
    "we tabulate the functions @xmath102 and @xmath103 using a less refined cell structure creating two large @xmath104 matrices . during the simulations we use the tables as a lookup to calculate the pair interaction and use interpolation to find the applicable values . for each table",
    "we also calculate the negative of the gradient and save the two components of the gradient in their own tables .",
    "we also tabulate the josephson interaction and its gradient and the columnar defect potential and its gradient but for these quantities we used a @xmath98 matrices . when simulating we allow pancakes to move to arbitrary real locations , but in order to calculate the forces we divide the actual position by @xmath105 and round to the nearest integer to use for the lookup tables .    in each simulation step",
    "we move all the pancakes at the same time , using the instantaneous forces .",
    "this is done using a time step @xmath106 . in these simulations",
    "we used the second order runge kutta method to advance the solution of the differential equations , which requires an additional virtual move for any real move .",
    "it is very important to chose the time step correctly , especially when cds are present .",
    "we used a variable size time step that limit how much a pancake can move in each step .",
    "the maximum distance allowed was 0.06 @xmath101 .",
    "thus if the maximum force on the pancakes is very large , a small time step is used .    in the simulation",
    "we apply a procedure to implement flux cutting and recombination .",
    "we assume that within the coupled - planes model , vortices may switch connections to lower their elastic energy ( in this case josephson energy ) when they cross each other @xcite . in the simulation",
    "we construct two matrices of size @xmath107 which we call the `` up '' matrix and the `` down '' matrix . for a given pancake @xmath26 in plane",
    "@xmath25 the `` up '' matrix points to the pancake in the plane @xmath108 ( or 1 if @xmath109 ) that is connected to the given pancake @xmath24 via a josephson interaction .",
    "generally this is the pancake closest to the given pancake in the next plane .",
    "the `` down '' matrix similarly points to the closest pancake below ( or in plane @xmath73 for @xmath110 ) .",
    "when we start from an initial configuration in which the fls are straight stacks of pancakes , the matrices simply point to the pancake just above or below a given pancake .",
    "when constructing the force matrix after each time step we check if indeed the `` up '' matrix points to the closest pancake above .",
    "if there is a closer pancake than the one given by the pointer then we find out its parent in the plane @xmath25 by using the down matrix , and we check if switching the two connections will decrease the sum of the squares of the two distances . if it does we cut and switch connections and update the `` up '' and `` down '' matrices .",
    "we term this process an `` _ exchange _ '' .",
    "the reason we use the square of the distances is that in most instances the josephson interaction is proportional to the square of the transverse distance .",
    "this procedure mimics the actual dynamics in which we expect the magnetic flux to choose a path that minimizes the josephson energy .",
    "we implement the flux cutting procedure after every update move of the system , but not during the virtual half - step in the runge - kutta procedure .",
    "our simulations show that just below the melting transition , even though some exchanges occur , they soon reverse or undo themselves , and thus they do not lead to what we refer to as an entangled state where composite loops or permutations are abundant . on the other hand when exchanges proliferate through the system , a phenomenon that occurs in our simulations just above the melting transition , the exchanges do not undo each other , and the system of fls changes from being composed of simple loops each made up of a single fl ending on itself , to a system composed mainly of composite loops that wind up several times around the simulation cell in the @xmath20 direction before returning to the original point .",
    "the reason that the exchanges proliferate above the melting transition is that the transverse fluctuations become strong enough to overcome the potential barriers due to the repulsion among pancakes residing in the same plane and thus the crossing of fls occur .",
    "we measured the following physical quantities . for details the reader",
    "is referred to our earlier work @xcite .",
    "the translational structure factor was also measured but we do not report on it in the present paper .",
    "we calculated the average energy per pancake .",
    "the total energy is the sum of the contributions from the em energy of all pairs of pancakes , the josephson energy of nearest neighbor pancakes in adjacent planes and the binding energy of pancakes trapped by columnar defects .",
    "for the first part , the em energy of a perfect abrikosov lattice at the same temperature and magnetic field was subtracted from the total em energy @xcite .      for each individual flux - line",
    "we define the position of the lateral center of mass as @xmath111 , where the sum goes over all the pancakes belonging to it .",
    "we then define the mean square deviations as @xmath112 where the sum is over all pancakes belonging to an individual flux - line and the average is over all flux - lines of the system and then taking a time average . the melting transition is expected to occur when this quantity satisfies @xmath113 where @xmath114 is the lindemann coefficient .      as we allow for flux cutting and recombination",
    ", we can define the number @xmath115 as that fraction of the total number of fls which belong to loops that are bigger than the size of a `` simple '' loop .",
    "a simple loop is defined as a set of @xmath73 beads connected end to end ( due to the periodic boundary conditions in the @xmath20 direction ) .",
    "loops of size @xmath116 , @xmath117 ... start proliferating at and above the melting temperature .      for the dynamical measurements ,",
    "a uniform driving force of proper magnitude was applied along positive @xmath35 direction .",
    "the average drift velocity of each pancake was measured .",
    "both the distribution and the average value of these velocities are studied .",
    "they provide evidence on the delocalization transition and the melting transition .",
    "parameters for bscco were taken as follows : @xmath118 , @xmath119 , @xmath120 and @xmath93 k. the temperature dependence of @xmath44 in this work was taken to follow the ginzburg - landau convention @xmath121 and similarly for @xmath122 .",
    "see discussion in ref .",
    "[ ] on the agreement of this choice with experiments . for the anisotropy @xmath123 we have used value of 375 . for columnar defects",
    "we have used a radius of 30 nm .",
    "in this section , we concentrate on the simulations of systems with vertical cds . both static measurements and dynamical measurements have been done . for the static measurements , we start from a hexagonal lattice of straight and vertical fls .",
    "the cds attract those fls which are near them and rapidly become occupied . for temperatures close to and above the melting transition ,",
    "the fls also become entangled .",
    "it takes relatively long for the entangling process to reach equilibrium , especially near the transition .",
    "we took 50 units of model time ( time is measured in unit of @xmath124 ) for equilibration and another 50 units of model time on measurements .",
    "simulations have been done on systems with 36 fls and 36 layers .",
    "columnar defect density @xmath125 was set to be 50 g .",
    "magnetic fields from 50 g to 200 g were investigated . for each field value ,",
    "10 different cd configurations were simulated and the measurement results were averaged .    according to the periodic boundary condition along @xmath20 direction ,",
    "the top of each fl is connected via the josephson interaction with the nearest pancake in the bottom plane . below the melting transition",
    ", the pancake usually belongs to the same fl as the top pancake .",
    "we say , the fl form a simple loop . as temperature increases ,",
    "the thermal motion of the pancakes starts to make some pairs of fls get close enough that flux cutting and reconnection happens , and some fls become part of a non - simple loop .",
    "figure [ fig01_a ] shows the fraction of fls belonging to non - simple loops . below the melting transition",
    ", none of the fls entangle with others and the curves lie exactly at zero ; above the delocalization transition , nearly uniform liquid is formed and the curves approach one .",
    "the criteria for melting can be taken to be that the fraction of non - simple loops reaches @xmath126 0.1 - 0.2 .",
    "it shows that the melting temperature decreases as the magnetic field increases .",
    "figure [ fig01_b ] shows the average mean square deviation of the pancakes on each fl relative to their `` center of mass '' @xcite .",
    "the results are in units of @xmath127 for b = 100 g .",
    "the melting transition is characterized by the sharp change of slope .",
    "for example , for b = 50 g , the change happens around effective temperature 600 , which is about 78k , with mean square deviation @xmath126 0.1 - 0.2 .",
    "another quantity of interest is the number of trapped pancakes .",
    "usually , each cd is occupied by a single fl . the trapped fls form a cage for the interstitial fls .",
    "below the melting , the interstitial fls form crystallites in the pores . at temperatures slightly above the melting transition ,",
    "the crystallites melt locally and form nanoliquid in the pores .",
    "higher temperature enables the trapped fls to escape out of the cds and the cage also melt , so a homogeneous liquid is formed . to compare results of different magnetic fields , fig .",
    "[ fig02](a ) plots the fraction of occupied cds , which is given by the fraction of trapped pancakes multiplied by fl to cd ratio . as a common character for all the field values , the fractional values decrease as temperature is increased .",
    "the curve for @xmath41 = 50 g is significantly lower than that of higher field values at low temperatures . even though the fl to cd ratio is one , the repulsion between the fls tries to make them evenly spaced and some fls have to be interstitial and some defects become unoccupied .",
    "figure [ fig02](b ) shows the normalized binding energy , which is the binding energy per plane per cd . as a consequence of fig .",
    "[ fig02](a ) , the values increase as the temperature increases because the fraction of occupied cds decrease . as a comparison with our previous work @xcite , fig .",
    "[ fig02](c ) is the average binding energy per pancake .    in order to verify that our system is large enough and finite size effects will not significantly change the results , we carried out simulations with 64 fls in 36 planes .",
    "a comparison between the results of 36 and 64 fls is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig03 ] .",
    "we see that the results are very similar , the transition for 64 lines is slightly sharper but this is not a significant effect .",
    "next , we discuss the dynamical measurements which were performed in order to locate the delocalization transition and the irreversibility line .",
    "the system is also started from a hexagonal lattice of straight and vertical fls .",
    "after 20 to 50 units of model time for equilibration without driving force , a uniform in - plane driving force @xmath128 is applied on all the pancakes along the @xmath35 direction .",
    "we used @xmath129 0.025 and 0.1 , which are small compared with the binding force on the trapped pancakes .",

    "the sudden change in the curves slopes reflects the position of the melting transition of the interstitial fls . figure [ fig08](c ) might suggest a one degree increase in the melting temperature for tilted cds , but this is within the simulation error .",

    "i.e. _ the fraction of non - simple loops .",
    "the flat area of the curves is an indication for the melting transition .",
    "first , we note that for straight cds , the fraction of non - simple loops at the transition for 200 layers is higher than the corresponding value for 36 layers , which is about 0.2 .",
    "this is because for longer fls , there is more chance to cross and also to form occasional kinks involving the cds .",
    "this figure is the only one that shows a significant difference between the straight and tilted cds in terms of the absolute value of their entanglement .",
    "this is likely due to the fact that fls trapped on cds are tilted and so are those fls in the vicinity of a cd .",
    "thus the top and bottom of those fls are not adjacent and they may connect to other fls to form loops .",
    "this interpretation is favored by the fact that the number of exchanges for the tilted cd case is not larger than for the case of straight cds but the amount of their entanglement is larger nevertheless .",
    "thus this criterion ( of entanglement ) using the boundary conditions may not be a good indication for the melting transition in the case of tilted cds as it is for the case of pure system or a system with straight cds .",
    "the flat plateau region of the curve should give a rough indication where the melting takes place .",
    "thus for tilted cds , we base our criterion for the melting on the transverse fluctuations of the fls and on the number of exchanges per unit time rather than on the amount of entanglement .",
    "we now account for the energies involved : the electromagnetic energy cost per layer associated with the tilting of an infinitely long stack of pancakes is given by @xcite @xmath144 .",
    "this cost is exceeded , for angles less than about @xmath145 , by the energy gain from the pinning of columnar defects , which is of the order of @xmath42 per layer .",
    "in addition , one should also include the energy @xmath146 , which favors to align the average vortex orientation with @xmath147 , which is implemented in the simulation by the periodic boundary conditions : when a stack is tilted , the stacks of images along the @xmath20 direction are not positioned along the tilted direction but are above ( and below ) the center of mass of the tilted stack and because of the electromagnetic interaction they pull the stack in the z - direction , acting like the @xmath148 term .",
    "the competition between the binding energy gain and the loss of electromagnetic energy associated with a tilt favors the formation of kinks .",
    "the trapped fls tilt to take advantage of the binding energy of the tilted cds , and the interstitial fls tilt because of repulsion by the trapped pancakes .",
    "but in order to relieve the frustration of the electromagnetic interaction , kinks are formed and the fls jump back to align with the z axis which is the external field direction .",
    "the larger the tilting angle of the cds the more kinks appear along the fls . the kinks on neighboring fls tend to align with each other .",
    "the formation of the kinks increases the josephson interaction part , however , in high anisotropic materials like bscco , this cost is negligible compared with the total energy @xcite .",
    "near the transition the transverse fluctuations due to the tilt - kink combination is not much different from the transverse fluctuations due to temperature fluctuations .",
    "our simulations show that the vortices form a tilted rigid matrix which is parallel to the cds , and the cds are almost fully decorated by pancakes . because of the kinks",
    ", the interstitial vortices can switch cage after a certain distance along the @xmath20 direction , but each section is still caged by the trapped pancakes on the cds .",
    "also interstitial fls can themselves by trapped on cds for some portion of their length . in the vicinity of the melting transition ( @xmath149 = 73k to 77k ) , considering the error bars of the measurements , we found that systems with cds tilted at @xmath2 have nearly the same total energy as those with non - tilted cds .",
    "one can conclude that the enhanced caging potential created by the cds , which raises the melting temperature @xcite , is not significantly affected when increasing the angle between @xmath150 and the cds , thus the thermodynamic properties , _",
    "i.e. _ , the melting transition and the delocalization , are angle independent .",

    "the two curves coincide within the range of the error bars , especially at temperatures near the delocalization transition .",

    "another feature is that the interstitial fls break into segments , which are titled to some degree along the direction of the cds .",

    "our results are in full agreement with our previous multilevel mc simulations reported in ref .",
    "furthermore we measured also dynamical properties of the system under an external current that applies force on the vortices and these located the melting and delocalization transitions at the same temperatures as the static measurements , giving a more precise identification of the location of the delocalization transition . for the melting transition the dynamical measurement actually identifies the irreversibility line associated with partial depinning , and this occurs at the same temperature as the melting for the case of vertical cds .    for the case of tilted cds , the porous vortex matter in bscco",
    "is shown to preserve its thermodynamic properties even when the field is tilted away from the cds .",
    "the positions of the melting and delocalization lines remain unchanged while the tilting angle of the cds vary , at least up to angles of @xmath153 .",
    "our simulations show that increasing the angle between the field and the cds leads to formation of weakly pinned vortex kinks , while preserving the basic structure of a rigid matrix of pancakes residing along the cds with nanocrystals of interstitial vortices embedded within the pores of the matrix .",
    "we also showed that under the influence of an applied force ( like a current ) the kinks slide down and lead to a global motion of the pancakes in the direction of the applied force .",
    "thus we expect that for large tilting angle between the cds and the magnetic field , which result in the proliferation of kinks , the irreversibility line should move to lower temperature , closer to the location of the melting in the pure system ( no cds ) . to measure this shift explicitly in the simulations as a function of the angle requires much more computational time than currently available , but it was verified in the recent experiments @xcite .",
