    "the discoveries of the first @xmath4-ray afterglow ( costa et al . 1997 ) and optical transient ( ot ) ( van paradijs et al . 1997 ) of a gamma - ray burst ( grb ) have led to a major breakthrough in grb research .",
    "the determination of a redshift of 0.835 for ( metzger et al .",
    "1997 ) , and the subsequent determination of redshifts of more than a dozen bursts with a median redshift of @xmath51.0 , have firmly established their cosmological origin ( e.g. kulkarni et al . 2000 and references therein ) .    in several cases supernovae ( sne )",
    "have been connected to grbs .",
    "attention to this connection was , from the observational side , first drawn in the remarkable case of that was associated with ( galama et al .",
    "furthermore , the light  curves of grb  970228 and grb  980326 ( reichart 1999 , galama et al . 2000 ; castro - tirado and gorosabel 1999 ; bloom et al .",
    "1999 ) have bumps that are consistent with a contribution from an underlying sn . in no cases",
    "the presence of an underlying sn contribution to the light ",
    "curve has been firmly excluded .",
    "the exclusion of a sn contribution from the light ",
    "curve of grb  990712 ( hjorth et al .",
    "2000 ) was based on a wrong identification of the ot in the _ hst _ image .",
    "a revised analysis indeed shows an underlying sn contribution to the light  curve ( bjrnsson et al .",
    ".    moreover , for less than half ( @xmath6 30% ) of all grbs with well - determined coordinates have searches for optical counterparts been successful . in some cases",
    "the lack of detection can be easily explained by too bright detection limits ( e.g. due to light from the moon , nearby bright stars or twilight ) , too slow reaction time or high foreground extinction in the galaxy .",
    "however , grb  981226 ( frail et al .",
    "1999 ) and grb  990506 ( taylor et al .",
    "2000 ) displayed no optical afterglow down to r  band limits of r=23 and r=23.5 less than half a day after the bursts ( jensen et al . 1999 ; pedersen et al .",
    "1999 ) , and both had a detectable radio afterglow .",
    "grb  970828 ( groot et al .",
    "1998a ) had a weak x - ray counterpart , but no ot was detected down to an r - band limit of 23.8 only 3 hours after the burst .",
    "it is still not known whether these ` dark ' bursts constitute the faint end of a ( continuous ) ot luminosity function or whether they represent a special class of grbs that are truly dark in the optical ( in other words a dichotomy similar to the radio - loud vs. radio quiet dichotomy for qsos ) .    in this paper",
    "we present the detection of the ot of grb  000630 .",
    "grb  000630 was observed by ulysses , konus - wind , near , and the bepposax grbm june 30.02 ut ( hurley et al . 2000 ) .",
    "grb  000630 had a duration of @xmath520 s , and a 25100 kev fluence of @xmath52@xmath710@xmath8 erg @xmath9 .",
    "these gamma - ray properties are consistent with the long  duration class of bursts ( hurley 1992 ; kouveliotou et al .",
    "1993 ) . in sect .",
    "[ observations ] and in sect .",
    "[ results ] we present our optical observations and the results we have obtained .",
    "we also discuss the implications of our results on our understanding of the @xmath6 70% of grbs with no detected optical counterparts .",
    "finally we summarize our results in sect .",

    "the ipn error - box of ( hurley et al .",
    "2000 ) was observed in the r  band with the 2.56-m nordic optical telescope ( not ) on 2000 june 30.90 ut ( 0.88 days after the burst ) using the andaluca faint object spectrograph ( alfosc ) . comparing with red and blue palomar optical sky survey  ii exposures no ot",
    "was found ( jensen et al .",
    "further r  band imaging of the field was carried out on july 1.9 ut .",
    "one object was found to have faded about one magnitude from june 30.90 to july 1.9 .",
    "subsequent deep r  band imaging obtained on july 3.9 ut confirmed the transient nature of the object and hence established this object as the likely optical afterglow of grb  000630 ( jensen et al .",
    "further deep r  band imaging of the ot was obtained at the not on july 10.9 ut and on july 25.9 ut .",
    "we have also obtained r  band imaging with the u.s . naval observatory flagstaff station ( usnofs ) 1.0-m telescope and the calar alto ( ca ) 2.2-m telescope ( greiner et al . 2000 ) , and b and v images with the 3.5-m telescopio nazionale galileo ( tng ) .",
    "the journal of observations is reported in table  [ obslog ] .",
    ".the journal of observations . [ cols=\"<,<,<,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     it is still not understood why ots have only been detected for about 30% of well localized grbs .",
    "possible explanations are _",
    "i ) _ there is a optically bright vs. optically dark dichotomy for grbs similar to the radio quiet vs. radio loud dichotomy for qsos ( i.e. a bimodal ot luminosity function ) , _ ii ) _ a large fraction of grbs occur at redshifts @xmath10 7 and are hence invisible in the optical due to ly-@xmath1 blanketing and absorption by intervening lyman - limit systems , _ iii ) _ a large fraction of grbs occur in highly obscured galaxies similar to the scuba - selected galaxies ( e.g. ivison et al .",
    "2000 ) so that the optical emission never escapes the host galaxies , or _",
    "iv ) _ the shape of the ot luminosity function is such that with the search strategies applied in the period 19972000 we would not expect to detect ots for more than 30% of the well localized grbs .    in order to shed some light on this problem",
    "we have compiled in table  [ darkdata ] , mainly using the gcn circular archive[multiblock footnote omitted ] , the most stringent r  band upper limits to magnitudes and their observation epochs relative to the grb epoch ( @xmath11 ) for 43 grbs with no detected ot .",
    "the left panel in fig .",
    "[ dark ] shows the upper limits plotted against @xmath11 for the 43 grbs .",
    "also plotted is the light ",
    "curve of the ot of grb  000630 ( full - drawn line ) and its extrapolation to earlier times than the first observing epoch ( dashed line ) . as seen , except for grb  990316 , all upper limits are above the _ observed _ ( @xmath3 1 day after grb event ) light  curve of grb  000630 .",
    "however , the strong upper limit on the magnitude of grb  990316 is only valid for a 2@xmath72 arcmin@xmath12 region around a candidate lotis transient that may be unrelated to the grb .",
    "the upper limits for grb  970815 , grb  970828 , grb  981226 , grb  990217 , grb  990506 , grb  990704 , grb  990806 , grb  991014 , grb  991105 , and grb  000615 are below the extrapolation of the light ",
    "curve to earlier times .",
    "two of these , grb  991014 and grb  991105 , occurred in fields with relatively high foreground extinction ( with e(b@xmath2v ) values 0.268 and 0.598 respectively ) .",
    "note here , that not all ot light  curves peak at @xmath13t@xmath141 day ( guarnieri et al .",
    "1997 , but see also galama et al .",
    "2000 ; pedersen et al .",
    "1998 ) . in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ dark ] we show the histogram of r  band magnitudes at @xmath13t=1 day ( in 0.5 mag bins ) of the 13 ots ( prior to and including grb  000630 ) that were detected earlier than 24 hr after the burst .",
    "it is much more difficult to detect an ot at r=23 than at r=19.5 , and an ot having r=24 at @xmath13t=1 day would almost certainly not be detected with current search strategies .",
    "therefore the observed distribution is _ not _ the real distribution of apparent ot magnitudes .",
    "the real distribution must have a larger fraction of bursts in the fainter bins .",
    "from the two plots in fig .",
    "[ dark ] we conclude that the majority ( @xmath3 75% ) of grbs without detected ots are consistent with no detection if they were similar to dim bursts like grb  980329 , grb  980613 , and grb  000630 at optical wavelengths .    in fig .",
    "[ compare]a  c we compare the properties of batse - detected grbs with and without detected ots . in fig .",
    "[ compare]a we show the spectral hardness vs. duration plot for 1959 batse bursts ( shown as contours following jensen et al .",
    "( 2001 ) ) . superimposed as filled circles and crosses are the positions of grbs with and without detected ots .",
    "as seen , the two groups populate the same region in the long - duration part of the diagram . in fig .",
    "[ compare]b we show the channel 3 fluence histogram in 0.1 dex bins for all batse bursts .",
    "the grbs with and without detected ots again show similar distributions . finally , in fig .",
    "[ compare]c the r  band magnitude of the ot at @xmath11 = 1 day in 0.5 mag bins for grbs with detected ots or the upper limit for grbs without detected ots are plotted against the logarithm of the channel 3 fluence .",
    "we have shifted the upper limits to @xmath11 = 1 day assuming a decay slope of @xmath15 .",
    "intuitively one might expect a correlation between the energy released at gamma - ray wavelengths and in the optical _ at some level _ , although different redshifts and different amounts of dust obscuration will increase the scatter . however , fig .",
    "[ compare]c does not indicate any correlation .",
    "moreover , the upper limits for the majority of grbs with no detected ots do not place them in regions of the diagram that are not already populated by grbs with detected ots .",
    "this means that based on the gamma - ray properties of the current sample we can not conclude that grbs with no detected ots belong to another class of grbs than grbs with detected ots .",
    "the ot of grb  000630 was detected with the not 21.1 hours after the high energy event with an r  band magnitude of 23.04@xmath00.08 .",
    "the ot subsequently followed a power - law decay characterized by a slope of @xmath1 = @xmath21.035@xmath00.097 . from the deep r  band image obtained 25.9 days after the event we find that there is no evidence for an underlying sn .",
    "furthermore , there is no indication of a host galaxy down to a 5@xmath16 limit of r=25.2 right underneath the point source emission from the ot .",
    "the closest galaxy is a blue galaxy located 2.0 arcsec north of the ot .    for the problem of dark bursts",
    "we find that the majority ( @xmath3  75% ) of grbs for which searches for optical afterglow have been unsuccessful are consistent with no detection if they were similar to bursts like grb  000630 at optical wavelengths .",
    "we at present can not exclude nor confirm any of the explanations _ i ",
    "iv _ listed above ( see sect  3.5 ) for why some bursts are darker than others . in order to establish the reasons why most grbs searches for ots up till now have been unsuccessful , and thereby obtain a more complete understanding of optical afterglows to grbs and the relation between optical and high energy properties of grbs , it is therefore essential to conduct deep ( r@xmath17 24 at @xmath181.0 day ) follow - up imaging at optical wavelengths and also deep infra - red follow - up of a sample of well localized and homogeneously selected grbs .",
    "this is feasible with the next generation of grb satellites and 8m class telescopes .",
    "we thank our anonymous referee for comments that helped us improve the discussion of dark bursts significantly .",
    "some of the data presented here have been taken using alfosc , which is owned by the instituto de astrofisica de andalucia ( iaa ) and operated at the nordic optical telescope under agreement between iaa and the nbifafg of the astronomical observatory of copenhagen .",
    "support for this programme by the director of the nordic optical telescope , professor piirola , is much appreciated .",
