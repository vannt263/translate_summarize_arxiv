    "scalar - tensor theories of gravity  @xcite are among the oldest and most natural alternatives to general relativity ( gr ) .",
    "in addition to the usual spin-2 graviton of gr , these theories present an additional spin-0 graviton polarization , i.e. gravity is encoded not only by the metric , but also by a gravitational scalar field .",
    "possible candidates for this scalar field include , for instance , the dilaton field of string theory .",
    "this scalar field couples non - minimally to the metric , but does not couple directly to matter ( because if it did , it would introduce a fifth force in the interactions of matter , which is not observed experimentally ) .",
    "nevertheless , because the scalar couples non - minimally to the metric , which in turn is coupled to matter through gravity , an effective coupling appears between the scalar field and matter . being mediated by gravity , however , this coupling is generally weak and only important in suitable astrophysical contexts .",
    "this effective coupling depends , for generic scalar tensor theories , on the local value of the scalar field , i.e. the effective ( dimensionless ) coupling constant @xmath0 can be taylor - expanded around the minkowski vacuum @xmath1 const of the ( dimensionless ) scalar field @xmath2 as  @xcite @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are dimensionless constants .    the simplest theory in the class of scalar - tensor theories",
    "was proposed in the 1950 s by fierz  @xcite and jordan  @xcite , and later rediscovered by brans and dicke  @xcite , hence it is usually called fierz - jordan - brans - dicke ( fjbd ) theory .",
    "this theory truncates the effective coupling at the lowest order , i.e. it assumes @xmath6 and neglects the higher - order @xmath7 terms . because gravity behaves very much as predicted by gr in the solar system , the effective coupling of fjbd theory",
    "is then constrained to very small values by solar - system tests , and in particular the cassini mission  @xcite , which requires @xmath8 .",
    "under such a tight experimental constraint , fjbd theory is essentially indistinguishable from gr as far as astrophysical tests are concerned ( except perhaps with space - based gravitational - wave detectors such as elisa  @xcite ) .",
    "it is important to stress that solar - system experiments are characterized by velocities @xmath9 , and weak gravitational fields @xmath10 .",
    "thus they do not constrain the strong - field , very relativistic regime where the most surprising predictions of gr , such as black holes ( bhs ) and neutron stars ( ns ) , arise . in this regime ,",
    "the fjbd assumption of retaining only the first term in the expansion is not necessarily justified from an effective field theory point of view .",
    "furthermore , the second term in that expansion has been shown to produce dramatic effects in strong - field regimes such as the interior structure of nss  @xcite ( see also refs .",
    "@xcite for the rotating ns case ) .",
    "more specifically , if @xmath5 is sufficiently negative and for ns compactnesses above a critical value , the trivial vacuum of the scalar field becomes unstable .",
    "it then becomes energetically favorable for the scalar field to settle on a non trivial configuration inside the ns ( `` spontaneous scalarization '' ) .",
    "this new non - trivial vacuum not only affects the relation between the ns mass and its radius , but also the orbital evolution of binary ns systems .",
    "such behavior arises because scalarization enhances the gravitational attraction between the binary s components , and triggers the emission of dipolar scalar radiation  @xcite .",
    "these effects allowed constraints to be placed on the constant @xmath5 using binary pulsar data  @xcite , which require @xmath11 .",
    "it has also been suggested that negative values of @xmath5 might produce significant effects in supernova explosions and in inflationary scenarios  @xcite , as well as affect the gravitational wave spectrum of vibrating scalarized nss  @xcite .",
    "all these results , however , probe the strong - field _ mildly relativistic _",
    "regime , because they involve either static / stationary configurations or velocities much smaller than the speed of light ( e.g. binary pulsars have velocities @xmath12 ) .",
    "the first investigations of the strong - field relativistic regime of scalar tensor theories were performed by ref .",
    "@xcite for a close binary system of bhs , and by ourselves in ref .",
    "@xcite for close binary ns systems .",
    "not surprisingly , the behavior of binary bh systems turns out to be essentially indistinguishable from gr  @xcite , as expected from results obtained in isolated bhs  @xcite and for binary bh systems in the weak - field , mildly relativistic regime  @xcite . on the other hand , the strong effects and deviations discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite were unanticipated from the intuition drawn from weak - field , mildly relativistic analysis .",
    "in particular , we showed  @xcite that the second term in the expansion can have strong consequences in the late stages of the evolution of ns binaries , even in cases where no effects are observed in the weak - field , mildly relativistic regime .",
    "( see also ref .",
    "@xcite for later exploration and further evidence of this result ) .",
    "in fact , we observe large deviations away from the gr behavior at separations much smaller than those probed by binary pulsars , providing signals that are at least in principle observable with existing gravitational - wave detectors such as advanced ligo / virgo .",
    "these facilities are expected to detect ( from several to hundreds ) ns binaries per year of operation  @xcite , and are sensitive from tens of hz up to a khz range . while the plunge and merger of binary nss is outside advanced ligo / virgo s sensitivity band in gr , our results  @xcite",
    "show that negative values of @xmath5 can trigger earlier plunges in scalar - tensor theories , thus moving the plunge and merger to frequencies of about 500 - 600 hz , within the detectors reach .    in this paper",
    ", we provide a deeper insight into the physical origin of these earlier plunges .",
    "we show that according to the binary system s parameters , they can either be triggered by the _",
    "induced scalarization _",
    "( is ) of one ( initially non - scalarized ) star under the influence of the `` external '' scalar field produced by the other ( initially scalarized ) star , or by a genuine phase transition of the full , initially non - scalarized system , i.e. a _ dynamical scalarization _ ( ds ) .",
    "while the interpretation of is is quite straightforward , the physical process at play in ds is less obvious . expanding on our discussion in ref .",
    "@xcite , we show that the ds phase transition generalizes the _ spontaneous scalarization _ of refs .",
    "indeed , spontaneous scalarization takes place when an isolated ns has a compactness @xmath13 ( where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the stellar mass and radius ) above a certain critical threshold , while we argue that ds occurs when a suitably defined `` effective '' compactness of the binary rises above a certain critical value in the last stages of the post - newtonian ( pn ) inspiral  .",
    "note that ds thus allows for a richer phenomenology , enabling scalarization of stars unable to scalarize in isolation ; stronger scalarization of compact binaries as their orbit shrinks ; and even a _ transient dynamical scalarization _ in ( close ) eccentric encounters .",
    "all these phenomena produce strong deviations away from the gr behavior , which may be observable with electromagnetic or gravitational probes .    to obtain the generic behavior of ns binaries prior to merger in an efficient , semi - analytical form",
    ", we present a formalism that describes the orbital evolution within an improved version of the pn dynamics for scalar - tensor theories .",
    "more specifically , we modify the pn equations of motion for binary systems  @xcite to account for the changes in the stars scalar charges produced by is and ds . also , we unify the treatment of these two phenomena , and describe their effects by a system of non - linear algebraic equations , which we solve at each step of the orbital evolution to compute the scalar charges . for simplicity , we restrict here to polytropic equations of state , but our method can be straightforwardly modified to consider more general equations of state .",
    "this approach , besides highlighting the physical origin of the deviations from gr , provides an efficient and inexpensive way to compute gravitational - wave templates for advanced ligo / virgo .",
    "these can be used to devise strategies to detect these effects once signals from ns binaries are detected , a problem which will be the subject of future work .    throughout this work we set @xmath16 , but reinstate powers of @xmath17 to keep track of the various pn orders when needed .",
    "let us consider a scalar - tensor theory with action @xmath18 + s_m[g_{\\mu\\nu},\\psi]\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath19 , @xmath15 and @xmath20 are respectively the ricci scalar and the determinant of the metric , @xmath21 is the gravitational scalar field , @xmath22 is a function that characterizes the theory , and we denote the degrees of freedom of matter collectively by @xmath23 . as can be seen ,",
    "the matter fields are not coupled directly to @xmath21 to avoid producing a scalar `` fifth force '' , as discussed earlier .",
    "we stress that eq .",
    "is not the most generic action for scalar tensor theories with second - order field equations ( because for instance the scalar field may have a potential , or there may be galileon - type terms in the action  @xcite ) , but is general enough to highlight the physics of spontaneous scalarization , ds and is .",
    "the action is often referred to as the `` jordan - frame '' action .",
    "an alternative form for the action ( usually called `` einstein - frame action '' ) can be obtained by introducing a new metric @xmath24 , conformally related to the jordan frame metric by @xmath25 , and a new scalar field @xmath26 defined ( up to integration constants ) by @xmath27 $ ] . in terms of these variables",
    "the action becomes @xmath28\\!\\!\\!\\ ] ] note that the matter fields @xmath23 still couple to the physical metric @xmath29 , i.e. weakly gravitating bodies follow geodesics of the physical metric and _ not _ the ones of the einstein frame metric .",
    "the advantage of using einstein frame variables is that the metric @xmath30 and the scalar field couple minimally , as can be seen from the action .",
    "this means that at the linear level ( on a flat background ) the einstein frame metric and the scalar field decouple , i.e. the einstein - frame metric represents the spin-2 graviton polarizations , while the scalar field represents the spin-0 polarization .",
    "the spin-2 and spin-0 polarizations are instead mixed in the jordan - frame metric .",
    "variation of the action yields the following field equations @xmath31 where indices are raised / lowered with the einstein - frame metric .",
    "also , @xmath32 , and the stress energy tensors for matter and the scalar field in the einstein frame are defined as @xmath33 while the relation to the `` physical '' matter stress - energy tensor ( i.e. the one in the jordan frame ) is given by @xmath34    from eq .",
    ", it is clear that a coupling appears between the einstein - frame scalar field @xmath26 ( or the jordan - frame scalar field @xmath21 ) and matter .",
    "first , this implies that in vacuum ( i.e. in the absence of matter ) the scalar field is not excited , hence the vacuum solutions of gr ( e.g. minkowski , bhs , etc . )",
    "are still solutions , with @xmath35 const .",
    "second , because in the original jordan - frame action the scalar field does not couple to matter directly , it is clear that this coupling simply appears because the scalar field couples non - minimally to the jordan - frame metric , which is in turn coupled to matter via gravity ( i.e. by the einstein equations ) .",
    "in fact , eq .",
    "can also be derived from the jordan - frame action , by combining the equation of motion for the scalar field with the trace of the einstein equations . introducing a dimensionless scalar field @xmath36",
    ", we can characterize this gravity - mediated effective coupling by the dimensionless coupling constant @xmath37 comparing this equation to eq .",
    "we obtain @xmath38 \\,,\\ ] ] where have defined @xmath39 and @xmath40 is to be interpreted as the asymptotic value of the scalar field at spatial infinity . in what follows , and",
    "as done e.g. also in ref .",
    "@xcite , we will therefore neglect the higher - order terms and consider scalar - tensor theories with @xmath41 [ corresponding to @xmath42 , with the additional requirement that the scalar field @xmath26 approach @xmath43 far from the system under consideration ( i.e. the role of the fjbd parameter @xmath4 is played by the value @xmath43 of the einstein - frame scalar field near spatial infinity ) .",
    "because essentially of eq .  , and since solar - system tests bound @xmath8 , @xmath43 is constrained to be very close to zero , while @xmath44 because of binary - pulsar measurements  @xcite .    in ref .",
    "@xcite we performed an exact integration ( up to numerical errors ) of the field equations  for close binary ns systems . in this paper",
    ", we seek instead an approximate and further elucidating physical description of such systems , hence it is natural to resort to pn theory , i.e. to expand the field equations in orders of @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the binary s velocity .",
    "pn theory describes extended bodies ( i.e. nss in our case ) with a point - particle model , and in gr the masses of these particles are constant , as one would intuitively expect . however , the description of analog systems in scalar - tensor theories is more complicated .",
    "as can be seen from the action , the scalar field @xmath21 multiplies the ricci scalar , which in gr is only multiplied by @xmath47 .",
    "therefore , it is not surprising that in scalar - tensor theories the measured value of the gravitational constant depends on the local value of the scalar field @xmath21 , i.e. the local gravitational constant @xmath48 measured by cavendish - type experiment is related to the bare @xmath49 appearing in the action by  @xcite @xmath50 this in turns implies that the binding energy of a body , being proportional to the gravitational constant , depends on the value of @xmath21 , which in general changes with position . as a result , when representing strongly - gravitating bodies ( such as nss and bhs ) , for which the binding energy provides a significant portion of the gravitational mass , the masses of the point - particles ( @xmath51 , where the index @xmath52 characterizes the particle ) can not be assumed to be constant in scalar tensor theories .",
    "more precisely , the dependence of the masses on the scalar field is parametrized by the `` sensitivities '' , which are defined by  @xcite @xmath53 where the derivative is taken while keeping the ( jordan - frame ) baryonic mass @xmath54 fixed . for fjbd , the sensitivities scale roughly as the binding energy per unit mass ; thus , they are negligible for stars like the sun ( @xmath55 ) and white dwarfs ( @xmath56 ) .",
    "however , they are significant for nss ( @xmath57 ) and for bhs ( @xmath58 )  @xcite .    in the context of the scalar - tensor theories that we consider in this work , it is convenient to introduce also the scalar charges @xmath59  @xcite , which are defined as @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the mass in the einstein frame , and",
    "where the derivative is again taken while keeping the jordan - frame baryonic mass @xmath54 fixed .",
    "( note also that our @xmath59 differs from the scalar charge used in refs .",
    "@xcite by a minus sign . ) from this definition , one can show that the scalar charges are related to the sensitivities by  @xcite @xmath62 as we will see , in the last stages of the evolution of ns binaries or close transient encounters , ds and is produce scalar charges that are @xmath63 for nss , even in the limit @xmath64 ( i.e. @xmath65 ) , and that corresponds to diverging sensitivities .",
    "modeling therefore a binary system with point particles having masses that depend on the local value of the scalar field , and performing a pn expansion of the field equations in the ratio between the binary s velocity and the speed of light , one finds , after laborious calculations , the pn equations of motion for each binary s component  @xcite .",
    "in particular , in terms of the binary s separation @xmath66 , the equations of motions through 2.5 pn order take the schematic form  @xcite @xmath67 \\nonumber\\\\              & &   + \\frac{8}{5 } \\eta \\frac{\\left(g_{\\rm eff } m\\right)^2}{r^3 } \\left[\\left ( \\frac{\\mathcal{a}_{1.5pn}}{c^3 } + \\frac { \\mathcal{a}_{2.5pn}}{c^5}\\right ) \\dot{r } \\mathbf{n } \\right .",
    "\\nonumber\\\\              & &   \\left.- \\left ( \\frac{\\mathcal{b}_{1.5pn}}{c^3 } + \\frac{\\mathcal{b}_{2.5pn}}{c^5}\\right ) \\mathbf{v}\\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath68 is the total mass of the system , @xmath69 is the symmetric mass ratio , @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 is the relative velocity of the system , and @xmath73 .",
    "the first term on the right - hand side is the newtonian acceleration , but the `` effective '' gravitational constant @xmath74 that appears in it is related to the local gravitational constant @xmath48 by @xmath75\\\\=g_n   \\left[1+\\alpha_1\\alpha_2+{\\cal o}\\left(\\frac{1}{\\omega_0}\\right)\\right]\\,,\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] i.e. the scalar charges tend to enhance the gravitational pull between the two stars .",
    "the second group of terms are the ( conservative ) 1pn and 2pn corrections to the newtonian dynamics , and the third group of terms are the dissipative corrections that account of the backreaction of gravitational - wave emission .",
    "note that dissipative effects appear already at 1.5pn order in the equation of motion , while they only appear at 2.5pn order in gr .",
    "this is because the sensitivities actually source the emission of dipolar scalar radiation with energy flux @xmath76 which is potentially larger than the usual quadrupolar emission of gr .",
    "the explicit expressions for the coefficients @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 and @xmath84 can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite , and depend on the sensitivities of the two stars .",
    "it should be noted , however , that the expressions presented in ref .",
    "@xcite also depend on the first and second derivatives of the sensitivities and of @xmath85 with respect to the scalar field , evaluated at the asymptotic value @xmath43 .",
    "those terms appear because ref .",
    "@xcite expresses the scalar charges evaluated at the local value of the scalar field as a taylor expansion around the scalar field @xmath43 at spatial infinity .",
    "in fact , it is possible to write the lagrangian regulating the motion of binary systems in scalar - tensor theories simply in terms of the scalar charges @xmath86 evaluated at the local scalar field  @xcite .",
    "because , as we will explain in the next section , the formalism that we present in this paper provides directly the scalar charges @xmath86 , we need to use that information in the equations of motion expressed in terms of @xmath86 alone , i.e. without performing the taylor expansion of ref .",
    "@xcite . because , as far as we are aware , the equations of motion in terms of @xmath86 have not been derived explicitly through 2.5 pn order , we reconstruct them by setting to zero all the terms depending on derivatives of the sensitivities and of @xmath85 in the expressions for the coefficients @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 and @xmath84 presented by ref .",
    "are kept in the expressions of ref .",
    "@xcite . ]    because the motion of a binary system depends on the sensitivities / scalar charges , which are non - zero for strongly gravitating objects ( i.e. ones for which the binding energy is not negligible with respect to the gravitational mass ) and are in general different for different bodies , the strong - equivalence principle is violated in scalar - tensor theories .",
    "we recall that the equivalence principle states the universality of free fall for strongly gravitating bodies ( in its strong version ) or for weakly gravitating ones ( in its weak version ) .",
    "clearly , free fall is not universal in scalar tensor theories due to the presence of the sensitivities / scalar charges in the equations of motion ( this effect is known as `` nordtvedt effect ''  @xcite , and takes place generically in the presence of gravitational degrees of freedom coupled non - minimally to the metric , see e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite ) . however , the weak version of the equivalence principle is satisfied because the sensitivities go to zero for weakly gravitating bodies .    in the rest of this paper",
    ", we will devise a formalism to calculate the scalar charges / sensitivities for a close binary ns system , simply by solving a system of algebraic equations , and use them in the pn equations of motion .",
    "as we will show , our framework allows us to take into account the changes in the scalar charges during the system s evolution due to the ds and is , which were discovered with fully relativistic simulations in ref .",
    "therefore , our formalism generalizes purely pn approaches such as those of refs .",
    "@xcite , which assume constant or mildly varying scalar charges / sensitivities and thus do not account for the effects of ds and is at small binary separations .",
    "as already mentioned , in scalar tensor theories where @xmath5 is sufficiently negative , a non - trivial vacuum for the scalar field develops inside sufficiently compact isolated nss , i.e. the scalar field undergoes a `` phase transition '' that is known as `` spontaneous scalarization ''  @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon can be studied in detail by solving the generalized tolman - oppenheimer - volkoff ( tov ) equations governing the structure of isolated nss in these theories  @xcite . in particular , as proven in ref .",
    "@xcite ( appendix a ) , the scalar charge of a ns ( formally defined by eq .  )",
    "can be extracted from the behavior of the scalar field near spatial infinity , i.e. @xmath87 using the following expression  @xcite @xmath88 where @xmath89 is a length scale defined by the asymptotic expansion @xmath90",
    "( i.e. @xmath89 is proportional to the mass of the star in the einstein frame ) .",
    "one can therefore obtain the scalar charge @xmath91 as a function of @xmath5 , the asymptotic value @xmath43 of the scalar field , and the compactness @xmath92 of the star , where the lenghtscale @xmath93 is defined by the asymptotic expansion @xmath94 of the jordan frame metric near spatial infinity .",
    "note that the gravitational mass @xmath95 of the star [ which is related to @xmath93 through @xmath96 m$ ]  @xcite ] and its radius @xmath15 are _ not _ independent , once an equation of state for the ns material has been chosen . here , for concreteness , we adopt the same polytropic equation of state as in ref .",
    "@xcite , i.e. we choose @xmath97 and @xmath98 , which yields a maximum mass @xmath99 both in gr and in the scalar - tensor theories we consider , and which provides a reasonable approximation for the equation of state of cold nss .",
    "( nevertheless we stress that the procedure outlined in our model is general , and can be easily extended to any relevant equation of state . )",
    "results for the scalar charge are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : alpha_singlestar ] . in the top panel , as an illustration , we consider a theory with @xmath100 and various values of @xmath43 , as a function of the ns compactness .",
    "as can be seen , for @xmath101 a sharp discontinuity ( corresponding to the spontaneous scalarization mentioned above ) develops at a critical compactness @xmath102 .",
    "this sharp transition gets increasingly blurred as @xmath43 increases , in agreement with the results of ref .",
    "note that the maximum @xmath43 allowed by solar - system tests is given by eq .   with @xmath103 , and",
    "that for @xmath104 the bound is even tighter  @xcite .",
    "however , as we pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , the `` effective '' @xmath43 relevant for stars in a binary system can be much larger then the solar - system limit .    we also stress that for @xmath101 , there are actually two families of solutions .",
    "the first corresponds to non - scalarized stars whose structure is the same as in gr and which have @xmath105 .",

    "@xcite we uncovered , through numerical evidence and analytical arguments , that a `` phase transition '' akin to spontaneous scalarization takes place in dynamical contexts .",
    "in particular , we showed that in binary ns systems ( which are brought to sufficiently small separations by the loss of energy and angular momentum through gravitational waves ) , a feedback mechanism appears that can induce scalarization in one or both stars .",
    "we refer to this process as dynamical scalarization , and subsequent numerical confirmation of its existence has been recently brought forward by ref .",
    "@xcite .    as we discuss next",
    ", ds is similar to spontaneous scalarization , but is regulated by the `` effective '' value of the background scalar field felt by each star in the binary , as well by the `` effective '' compactness of the system .",
    "the former case ( i.e. ds regulated by the `` effective '' value of the scalar field ) is most relevant in binaries consisting of a scalarized star and a non - scalarized one . in this case ,",
    "ds amounts to a non - linear version of is  @xcite , where the non - scalarized star is immersed in an increasingly large scalar - field background produced by the scalarized star .",
    "therefore , the unscalarized star acquires a scalar charge , in agreement with the top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : alpha_singlestar ] , which shows that @xmath91 grows with @xmath43 , even for stars with negligible scalar charge for @xmath119 .",
    "an important observation is that this process is _ non - perturbative _ because the newly - scalarized star will in turn induce a growth in the scalar charge of its companion .",
    "in other words , a dynamical interplay arises because either star ( say star 1 ) is not only sensitive to the asymptotic value of the scalar field far away from the binary , but also to the contribution due to its companion ( say star 2 ) , hence @xmath120 where @xmath121 ( @xmath122 ) is the `` background '' value of the scalar field in which star @xmath52 is immersed , and we recall that the coefficient @xmath123 [ defined by the asymptotic expansion ] is proportional to the scalar charge [ cf .",
    "eq .  ] , and thus a function of the scalar - field background in which the star is immersed ( cf . fig .",

    "the feedback mechanism described above becomes important .",

    "radiation is not produced , so the behavior observed is driven by the modified gravitational attraction between the stars , which affects ( through the dynamics ) the emission of quadrupolar gravitational waves .",

    "such oscillations induce a scalar charge , whose behavior is naturally tied to the separation .",
