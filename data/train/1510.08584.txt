    "<S> the description of physical processes in accelerated frames opens a window to numerous new phenomena . </S>",
    "<S> one can encounter these effects both in the subatomic world and on a macroscale . in the present work we review our recent results on the study of the electroweak interaction of particles with an accelerated background matter . in our analysis </S>",
    "<S> we choose the noninertial comoving frame , where matter is at rest . </S>",
    "<S> our study is based on the solution of the dirac equation , which exactly takes into account both the interaction with matter and the nonintertial effects . </S>",
    "<S> first , we study the interaction of ultrarelativistic neutrinos , electrons and quarks with the rotating matter . </S>",
    "<S> we consider the influence of the matter rotation on the resonance in neutrino oscillations and the generation of anomalous electric current of charged particles along the rotation axis . </S>",
    "<S> then , we study the creation of neutrino - antineutrino pairs in a linearly accelerated matter . the applications of the obtained results for elementary particle physics and astrophysics are discussed .    nowadays </S>",
    "<S> it is understood that noninertial effects are important in various areas of modern science such as elementary particles physics , general and special relativity , as well as condensed matter physics  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> recently in refs .  @xcite it was realized that the electroweak interaction of particles with accelerated matter leads to interesting applications in physics and astrophysics . in those works , </S>",
    "<S> the treatment of the particle evolution was made in the comoving frame , where matter is at rest , with the noninertial effects being accounted for exactly . in the present work we review our recent results on the particle interaction with accelerated matter .    </S>",
    "<S> our study of the fermion propagation in an accelerated matter is based on the dirac equation in a comoving frame . in this situation </S>",
    "<S> one can unambiguously define the interaction with background matter . </S>",
    "<S> it is known that the motion in a noninertial frame is equivalent to the interaction with an effective gravitational field having the metric tensor @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the dirac equation for the particle bispinor @xmath1 in curved space - time has the form  @xcite , @xmath2    \\psi =    \\gamma_{0}(x )    \\left\\ {      \\frac{v_{\\mathrm{l}}}{2 }      \\left [        1-\\gamma^{5}(x )      \\right ] +      \\frac{v_{\\mathrm{r}}}{2 }      \\left [        1+\\gamma^{5}(x )      \\right ]    \\right\\ }    \\psi,\\ ] ] where @xmath3 are the coordinate dependent dirac matrices , @xmath4 is the covariant derivative , @xmath5 is the spin connection , @xmath6 is the particle mass , @xmath7 are the effective potentials of the interaction of left and right chiral projections with background matter , @xmath8 is the fermi constant , @xmath9 is the effective density of background particles , @xmath10 , @xmath11 is the covariant antisymmetric tensor in curved space - time , and @xmath12 . in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite we found the solution of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : depsicurv ] ) for an ultrarelativistic neutrino moving in a rotating matter . </S>",
    "<S> note that , in case of neutrinos , we should set @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> choosing the appropriate vierbien vectors , we obtained @xmath1 , which is expressed in terms of the laguerre functions . </S>",
    "<S> then we generalized our result to include different neutrino eigenstates and mixing between them . </S>",
    "<S> we obtained that the resonance condition is shifted by the matter rotation contrary to our previous claim in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this effect can have the implication for the explanation of great linear velocities of pulsars since there is a correlation between the linear and angular velocities of a pulsar  @xcite .    in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , we obtained the solution of eq .   for ultrarelaticistic electroweakly interacting electrons and quarks in the rotating matter . </S>",
    "<S> using this solution we derived the nonzero electric current along the rotation axis in the form , @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the angular velocity , @xmath16 is the electric charge ( including the sign ) of a test fermion , and @xmath17 are the chemical potentials of right and left fermions . </S>",
    "<S> the existence of the nonzero current in eq .   is attributed in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite to the new _ galvano - rotational effect _ </S>",
    "<S> ( gre ) . </S>",
    "<S> gre is analogous to the chiral vortical effect  @xcite , in which the induced current is @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> however , in the later case the current is vanishing in the equilibrium at @xmath19 , whereas @xmath20 in eq .   </S>",
    "<S> is nonzero in this situation .    </S>",
    "<S> gre can be used for the generation of a toroidal magnetic field ( tmf ) in neutron and quark / hybrid stars . </S>",
    "<S> it is well known that , in a star , a purely poloidal magnetic field , which is observed by astronomers , is unstable . </S>",
    "<S> a toroidal component , which lays inside a star and can be of the same magnitude as a poloidal one , is required . in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite we estimated the strength of tmf generated owing to gre as @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the star radius . using the characteristics of the background matter in a compact star , </S>",
    "<S> one gets that @xmath23 can be generated  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this tmf strength is comparable with the observed magnetic fields in old millisecond pulsars  @xcite .    in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite we solved eq .   for an ultrarelativistic neutrino interacting with a linearly accelerated matter . in this case </S>",
    "<S> @xmath1 is expressed via the whittaker functions . </S>",
    "<S> the obtained solution turned out to reveal the instability of the neutrino vacuum leading to the creation of the neutrino - antineutrino ( @xmath24 ) pairs . </S>",
    "<S> this phenomenon is analogous to the well known unruh effect  @xcite consisting in the emission of the thermal radiation by an accelerated particle , with the effective temperature @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the particle acceleration .    </S>",
    "<S> requiring that the probability of the creation of @xmath24 pairs is not suppressed , in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , we obtained the upper bound on the neutrino mass , @xmath27 if we study the creation of @xmath24 pairs in a core collapsing supernova ( sn ) at the bounce stage , one gets that @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> the obtained upper bound is comparable with the constraint on neutrino masses established earlier in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , where we studied the @xmath24 pairs creation in sn at the neutronization .    </S>",
    "<S> in conclusion we mention that we have studied various phenomena happening with particles electroweakly interacting with accelerated background matter . </S>",
    "<S> we have considered two types of the acceleration : due to rotation and a linear acceleration . </S>",
    "<S> the exact solutions of the dirac equation for a test fermion , accounting for both the matter interaction and the noninertial effects , have been found . </S>",
    "<S> then we have discussed the influence of the matter rotation on the resonance in neutrino oscillations , the generation of the electric current flowing along the rotation axis , and the creation of @xmath24 pairs in a linearly accelerated matter . </S>",
    "<S> finally we have considered the possibility of the implementation of our results in various astrophysical media such as neutron and quark / hybrid stars as well as sns . </S>"
