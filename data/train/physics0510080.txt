    "one of the goals of physics education research is to identify sources of student difficulties in learning physics and to devise and assess novel curricula and pedagogy that may reduce the difficulties  @xcite .",
    "investigation of student difficulties related to various physics concepts is important for devising instructional strategies to reduce or eliminate the problems .",
    "previous investigations have documented difficulties in various introductory and advanced physics courses  @xcite , but only few examine the student understanding of rotational motion and notions associated with it @xcite .",
    "this study focuses on the difficulties in learning rotational and rolling motion concepts covered in a typical introductory physics course .",
    "in particular , we investigate the understanding of torque , moment of inertia , rotational energy , and rolling motion by interviewing students enrolled in the introductory calculus- and algebra - based courses , and in a junior level classical mechanics course using piagetian style demonstration - based tasks  @xcite .",
    "we also compare the interview findings with response to the multiple - choice and free - response questions on these topics administered to large introductory physics classes .",
    "in general , we found a good agreement between the findings of the interviews and written tests , and the large population of students involved in the study ( as described in sec .",
    "ii ) suggests that the difficulties related to rotational and rolling motion discussed here are common .",
    "our investigation was composed of two parts . the first consisted of demonstration - based interviews with individual students ( lasting about 60 minutes each ) , in which students were asked a set of questions about lecture - demonstration based tasks .",
    "once students made their initial predictions , they were asked to perform the demonstration and reconcile any differences in their expectations and observation .",
    "we employed a ",
    "think - aloud \" protocol  @xcite and asked students to make explicit their thought processes verbally as they reasoned about the questions .",
    "we intervened minimally while they were thinking aloud but prodded them to  keep talking \" when they appeared to be reasoning silently .",
    "after they had finished answering to their satisfaction , we asked further questions to clarify points that were not made clear earlier .",
    "since we were interested in understanding conceptual difficulties , qualitative reasoning was considered sufficient .",
    "think - aloud demonstration - based interviews were conducted with ten students enrolled in calculus- or algebra - based introductory physics courses ( typically science or engineering majors who had completed the part of the course dealing with rotational and rolling motion concepts ) and six physics juniors enrolled in a classical mechanics course who had recently learned rotational and rolling motion using the lagrangian formulation at the university of pittsburgh .",
    "all students were paid volunteers .",
    "introductory students participating in the interviews received at least a b grade in their physics midterm examination covering rotational and rolling motion concepts .",
    "although interviews provide an excellent means for probing student reasoning and depth of understanding , they are time consuming , and only a subset of students can be examined using this method . on the other hand ,",
    "multiple choice questions are easy to grade , compare , and analyze quantitatively , but the thought process may not be revealed as clearly by the test answers alone . in particular , it is not easy to distinguish correct understanding from right answers for wrong reasons or  recall \" of concepts and formulas without understanding .",
    "however , well - designed multiple - choice tests administered to a large group of students in conjunction with in - depth interviews of a subset of students can be an effective tool for understanding student difficulties .",
    "thus , in the second part of our investigation , we designed several free - response questions guided by the students performance in the demonstration - based interviews , and administered them to students in introductory physics classes . after gaining further insight",
    ", we devised a multiple - choice test , which required concise justifications for each answer .",
    "the design of the alternative answer choices in the test was based upon the common difficulties that were identified in the interviews and free - response questions .",
    "the multiple - choice test was not meant to be comprehensive and cover all topics involved with rolling and rotational motion , but it focused on important concepts underlying the demonstration - based interview tasks ( see table  [ table1 ] ) .",
    "we revised the test in several iterations with the help of five faculty members at the university of pittsburgh , while administering it to students in several introductory physics courses and interviewing six introductory physics students individually on the test questions .",
    "about 3000 students were involved in the entire study , including the period when test questions were being revised .",
    "the item analysis was performed for every version of the test to assess how well the distractor choices worked .",
    "the final version of the multiple - choice test consisted of 30 questions , and it was administered to 652 students from seven calculus- and algebra - based introductory physics courses ( including one honor class ) .",
    "the reliability index @xmath0 for the multiple - choice test for different classes ranged from @xmath1 to @xmath2 ( which is considered good by the standards of test design  @xcite ) , and the point biserial discrimination coefficients were between 0.2 and 0.7 for all questions . due to lack of class time , only 11 test questions were administered to 17 students in an intermediate level mechanics class ( included in appendix  b ) .",
    ".the different concepts covered and the questions in the multiple - choice test that addressed them ( see appendix b ) . [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "our investigation involving individual student interviews using demonstration - based tasks and written tests suggests that students have many common difficulties about rotational and rolling motion concepts covered in the introductory physics courses .",
    "regardless of their level , students share difficulties with fundamental concepts such as torque , moment of inertia , rotational energy , rolling , and the related role of friction .",
    "some of the problems identified here propagate from similar ones with linear motion , while others are due to the more intricate nature of rotational and rolling motion .",
    "many students acted as though they were applying rotational principles to real physical situations for the first time .",
    "they seemed uncomfortable in predicting the outcome of experiments and in reconciling the differences between their initial predictions and observations by taking advantage of the tools they had learned .",
    "they in general had difficulty applying the principle of conservation of energy and relative velocity concepts .",
    "instructional strategies that focus on improving student understanding of rotational and rolling motion concepts should take into account these difficulties .",
    "the multiple - choice test that we have developed can help assess the effectiveness of strategies to improve student understanding of these concepts .",
    "we wish to thank jim stango for his care in setting up the demonstration apparatus , and all faculty members ( y.  choi , r.  p.  devaty , w.  goldburg , a.  janis , r.  johnsen , j.  levy , j.  mueller , g.  a.  stewart , j.  a.  thompson , m. vincent , and x.  l.  wu ) for helping with the design and administration of the free - response and multiple - choice questions .",
    "this work was supported in part by the national science foundation .",
    "* can you explain why it will start to rotate when let go ?",
    "* can you predict whether this particular rotor ( shown to the student ) will rotate clockwise or counter - clockwise ?",
    "why ? * what will be the effect of increasing the wing angle with respect to the horizontal keeping all the other parameters fixed ?",
    "in particular , what will happen if the wings were completely vertical or horizontal and why ? * what will be the effect of increasing the length of the wing for a fixed angle keeping all the other parameters fixed ( i.e. , assume the total mass and moment of inertia of the rotor are not affected significantly ) ?",
    "* what will be the effect of increasing the relative displacement of the two wings from the central vertical axis laterally , keeping all the other parameters fixed ( students were shown with gesture what was meant by increasing the lateral displacement of the two wings to make the question clear to them ) ? why ?",
    "in particular , how will the motion change if the wings were not displaced with respect to the center ? * how will the magnitude of the linear downward acceleration of the rotor compare to the magnitude of acceleration due to gravity , _ g _ ?",
    "we hoped that students would have noticed that the air resistance or drag force , @xmath3 , acted perpendicularly to the wings , and since the wings were displaced , the horizontal component of @xmath3 caused a torque about the central vertical axis ( but no net horizontal force ) on the rotor , as shown in fig .",
    "this torque makes the helicopter rotate when let go .",
    "the direction in which the helicopter rotates can be predicted by noting the direction of the net torque ( inferred from the way in which the wings are displaced ) .",
    "the dependence of the torque on the wing angle ( with respect to the horizontal ) is nonmonotonic . in the extreme case when the wings are completely vertical",
    ", the drag force perpendicular to the wing surfaces is negligible . on the other hand , for perfectly horizontal wings",
    "the air resistance is maximized , but no horizontal component of the drag force is generated .",
    "hence in both cases the torque vanishes , while it reaches a maximum value for some intermediate angle ( which is not trivial to compute , considering that the terminal speed of the helicopter depends on the wing angle too ) .    keeping all the parameters fixed ,",
    "if the wings are made longer but the angle with the horizontal is kept fixed , both the vertical and horizontal components of the drag force increase due to an increase in the surface area .",
    "if changes in the rotor mass and moment of inertia are negligible ( i.e. , most of the mass is distributed in the central part of the rotor , and not in its wings ) , then a stronger torque leads to a larger terminal angular velocity ( we note that air resistance suppresses the angular acceleration rather quickly , at least for a paper rotor , and then the rotor falls uniformly while rotating at constant @xmath4 ) .    the increase in the relative displacement of the two wings from the vertical central axis keeping all the other parameters fixed increases the torque due to an increase in the lever arm .",
    "in particular , if the wings are not displaced with respect to the central axis , the horizontal components of the drag forces on the two wings are not displaced from each other ( the lever arm is zero about the central vertical axis ) so that there is no torque to start the rotational motion .    finally , the vertical downward acceleration of the rotor is smaller than @xmath5 because of the air resistance , the turbulences created by the rotational motion , and the rotation of the rotor ( in fact , the gravitational potential energy of the rotor - earth system as the rotor falls is not converted wholly to linear kinetic energy but also to rotational kinetic energy ) . once the terminal speed is reached ,",
    "the vertical acceleration of the rotor becomes zero . if students mentioned any one of the above qualitative reasons for why the vertical downward acceleration of the rotor was smaller than @xmath5 , it was considered sufficient .",
