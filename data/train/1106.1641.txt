    "since the description of the hubble sequence ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) we have learned that position along the hubble sequence correlates with parameters like color , stellar age , and gas fraction ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , morphologies by themselves provide very limited information , as they are scale free and do not include physical parameters such as surface brightnesses , sizes , luminosities and masses . using the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss , @xcite ) , @xcite showed that the main parameter driving galaxy properties is stellar mass .",
    "high mass galaxies are generally red , have old stellar populations and low specific star formation rates ( ssfrs ) , while low mass galaxies are generally blue , have young stellar populations and high ssfrs .",
    "a key question is what the structure was of the progenitors of low redshift galaxies .",
    "hubble space telescope studies out to redshift @xmath5 indicate that the morphological variation is comparable to that at low redshift ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "more recent studies of @xmath7 galaxies using the hst nicmos camera have yielded varying results , largely due to different selection criteria .",
    "for example , @xcite studied the rest - frame optical morphologies of a flux - limited sample of galaxies at @xmath8 and found that they are generally irregular .",
    "@xcite , on the other hand , investigated the rest - frame optical and uv morphologies of distant red galaxies ( drgs ) in the hubble ultra deep field ( hudf ) , and found both galaxies with irregular morphologies and galaxies with smooth morphologies .",
    "additionally , they showed that the rest - frame optical morphologies of these galaxies are much more regular and centrally concentrated than the rest - frame uv morphologies .    with the advent of the wide field camera 3 ( wfc3 ) , with its vastly improved sensitivity and resolution",
    "compared to nicmos , it has become possible to analyze the rest - frame optical structure of high redshift galaxies with an unprecedented level of detail . @xcite",
    "have used data from the first year of observations of the hudf and the early release science field to classify the rest - frame uv and optical morphologies of galaxies up to @xmath9 .",
    "these authors confirm results by e.g. @xcite , who showed that massive galaxies at @xmath10 can be separated into two distinct classes : blue star - forming galaxies with irregular morphologies on the one hand , and red quiescent galaxies with smoother morphologies on the other .    in this letter",
    ", we extend the previous results using the full two - year ultradeep near - infrared ( nir ) imaging of the hudf taken with the hst wfc3 .",
    "these data are the deepest ever obtained in the nir and make it possible to analyze the morphologies , colors and structure of galaxies to @xmath11 in the rest - frame optical . using the incredible sensitivity and angular resolution of the wfc3 images we analyze the rest - frame optical surface brightness profiles of a mass - selected sample of galaxies at @xmath0 .",
    "we use these profiles to derive structural parameters such as size and profile shape , and obtain rest - frame color profiles .",
    "we study the correlations between these parameters as a function of redshift in order to investigate the hubble sequence at different epochs in the history of the universe . throughout the letter",
    ", we assume a @xmath12cdm cosmology with @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 km s@xmath16 mpc@xmath16 .",

    "these images were reduced using an adapted pipeline ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the fwhm of the point - spread function ( psf ) is @xmath20 arcsec .",
    "the images are combined with very deep advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) images of the hudf @xcite to construct color images of the massive galaxies in the field .",
    "we use the @xmath21-selected catalog of @xcite to select galaxies in the hudf for which wfc3 imaging is available .",
    "this catalog combines observations of the chandra deep field south ranging from ground - based @xmath22 band data to spitzer @xmath23 m data , and includes spectroscopic redshifts where available , as well as photometric redshifts derived using eazy @xcite .",
    "stellar masses were estimated from spectral energy distribution fits to the full photometric data set ( frster schreiber et al . , 2011 in preparation ) , assuming a kroupa initial mass function and the stellar population models of @xcite . to study the morphological variation at @xmath0",
    ", we select the 16 most massive galaxies with @xmath24 .",
    "these galaxies have stellar masses between @xmath25 m@xmath26 to @xmath27 m@xmath26 .",
    "color images of these galaxies are shown in figure  [ fig : z2galaxies]a .",
    "a summary of their properties is given in table  [ tab : table ] .    from figure",
    "[ fig : z2galaxies]a it is apparent that galaxies at @xmath0 show a large variation in morphology , size and color .",
    "one can distinguish red , smooth , compact galaxies ; blue galaxies with disk - like structures , some even with apparent spiral arms ; and other star forming galaxies which appear more irregular .",
    "most of the galaxies have a well - defined , red center .",
    "this is further illustrated in figure  [ fig : z2galaxies]b , where galaxy morphology is shown as a function of wavelength .",
    "four massive galaxies are shown in the observed hst / acs @xmath28 band @xcite , hst / wfc3 @xmath19 band and @xmath21 band ( based on ground - based imaging by labb et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "the morphology of the sources differs strongly as a function of wavelength .",
    "the rest - frame uv morphology is always more clumpy and extended than the rest - frame optical morphology .",
    "in addition , the rest - frame optical images show well - defined centers for all our sources , whereas these are very often lacking in the rest - frame uv images .",
    "this confirms that the mass distribution of @xmath0 galaxies is smoother and more centrally concentrated than would be concluded from rest - frame uv imaging ( see e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "in order to quantify the morphological properties of @xmath0 galaxies we measure their surface brightness profiles .",
    "in contrast to conventional model - fitting techniques where a simple model is used to approximate the intrinsic surface brightness profile ( e.g. , using the galfit package of @xcite ) , we measure the actual profile using the approach of @xcite .",
    "the intrinsic profile is derived by fitting a srsic model profile convolved with the psf to the observed flux , and then adding the residuals from this fit to the unconvolved model profile .",
    "effectively , the model profile is used to deconvolve the majority of the observed flux , after which this deconvolved profile is combined with the residuals to account for deviations from the assumed model .",
    "@xcite have shown that it is thus possible to accurately measure the true intrinsic profiles out to large radii and very low surface brightness , even in cases where galaxies comprise a bright compact bulge and a faint extended disk .",
    "in addition to the @xmath0 galaxies we measure the profiles of galaxies at @xmath5 and @xmath29 . the @xmath5 sample is taken from the same dataset as the @xmath0 sample , whereas the @xmath6 galaxies are taken from the @xcite sdss catalog of central galaxies .",
    "the galaxies are selected to lie in the same mass interval as the @xmath30 sample : @xmath31 .",
    "the sdss redshifts are required to be @xmath32 and the @xmath5 galaxies have @xmath33 .",
    "this results in a sample of 27 galaxies at @xmath5 and 84 galaxies at @xmath6 .",
    "stellar masses and ssfrs for the sdss sample are obtained from the mpa / jhu datarelease ( see @xcite ; @xcite for details ) .",
    "a summary of the properties of the @xmath5 and @xmath6 galaxies is given in table  [ tab : table ] .",
    "in figure  [ fig : profiles ] we show surface density profiles , @xmath34 color profiles , and @xmath34 color gradients for galaxies in all three redshift bins .",
    "the surface density profiles are obtained by multiplying the surface brightness profiles in the @xmath19 band ( @xmath35 band for the sdss galaxies ) with the galaxies average @xmath36 ratios in that band ( where @xmath37 is the total mass from the @xcite catalog ( mpa / jhu catalog for the sdss galaxies ) and @xmath38 is derived from the surface brightness profiles ) .",
    "this approach ignores gradients in the @xmath36 ratios and is therefore not exact ; however , it allows for a more quantitative comparison between galaxies at different redshifts and with different colors .",
    "the color gradients are derived from fits to the @xmath1 profiles between the half - width at half - maximum ( hwhm ) of the psf ( @xmath39 arcsec for the sdss galaxies , @xmath40 arcsec for the hudf galaxies ) and the radius where the errors in the flux measurement reach 20% .",
    "the majority of @xmath0 galaxies in our sample have negative color gradients , which do not vary strongly with redshift : @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 for @xmath0 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively ( where the errors give the 1-@xmath44 interval around the median ) .",
    "thus , galaxy color gradients seem to be remarkably constant with redshift , both for quiescent and star - forming galaxies . it should be noted that this is not a comparison of low - redshift galaxies to their high - redshift progenitors ; the @xmath0 galaxies are expected to evolve into more massive galaxies at low redshift , due to mergers and accretion .",
    "since we use mass - limited samples , the @xmath0 galaxies we consider will most likely fall outside of our mass - limits at low redshift ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "finally , we study the relations between structure , color and ssfr as a function of redshift in figure  [ fig : hubble ] . in the top row",
    "we show srsic index against ssfr for the @xmath6 , @xmath5 and @xmath30 samples . in the bottom row",
    "we show srsic index against rest - frame @xmath1 color for the same galaxies .",
    "the srsic indices are derived from fits to the residual - corrected @xmath19-band ( @xmath35-band for the @xmath6 galaxies ) surface brightness profiles .",
    "there is a clear relation between these parameters at all redshifts : star - forming galaxies have `` diskier '' ( lower @xmath45 ) profiles and bluer colors than quiescent galaxies .",
    "there is a large variation in the ssfrs , colors and srsic indices of @xmath0 galaxies , and the spread in these parameters is of roughly the same order of magnitude in all redshift bins .",
    "we note that the relation shows systematic evolution : the median ssfr increases with increasing redshift and the median color and srsic index decrease , from log ssfr = @xmath46 yr@xmath16 at @xmath6 to log ssfr = @xmath47 yr@xmath16 at @xmath0 , from @xmath48 to @xmath49 , and from @xmath50 to @xmath51 ( where the errors give the 1-@xmath44 interval around the median ) .",
    "these results are qualitatively consistent with the trends derived in e.g. , @xcite .",
    "the relations between structure , color and ssfr are further illustrated in figure  [ fig : images ] , which shows rest - frame @xmath1 color images of a selection of galaxies at @xmath6 , @xmath5 and @xmath30 , as a function of ssfr . from each redshift bin",
    "we select seven galaxies , evenly spaced in log ssfr .",
    "this figure very clearly illustrates the morphological variety present at @xmath30 .",
    "additionally , it confirms the relations shown in figure  [ fig : hubble ] : star - forming galaxies are blue and extended , while quiescent galaxies are red and relatively compact .",
    "thus we find that the variation in galaxy structure at @xmath0 is as large as at @xmath6 .",
    "furthermore , the systematic relationships between different structural parameters are very similar between @xmath6 and @xmath30 .",
    "this , in addition to the lack of evolution in the @xmath34 color gradients shown in figure  [ fig : profiles ] , suggests that the underlying mechanisms that give rise to the hubble sequence at @xmath6 may already be in place at @xmath0 .",
    "we have shown that the morphologies of massive @xmath0 galaxies in the hudf are complex and varied : from compact , apparently early - type galaxies to large star forming systems superficially similar to nearby spirals .",
    "many of these galaxies seem to be composed of multiple components with large differences in stellar age .",
    "we conclude that the variety in morphologies which is observed at @xmath29 also exists in galaxies at @xmath0 .",
    "this is confirmed by an analysis of the surface density profiles , which reveals a large range in profile shapes .",
    "the profiles of the large star forming systems are close to exponential , whereas the profiles of the quiescent systems are more concentrated .",
    "the correlations between morphology and ssfr are similar at all redshifts between @xmath6 and @xmath0 .",
    "this does not mean that morphologies and profiles are static : galaxies evolve quite strongly between @xmath52 and @xmath29 .",
    "quiescent galaxies are much more compact at high redshift , and can not evolve passively into low redshift quiescent galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "a similar size evolution is required for the star forming galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we note that due to the evolution in the mass function of galaxies the @xmath0 galaxies considered here will almost certainly not evolve into the low - redshift galaxies in this paper",
    ". it would be very informative to examine the morphologies of number density - limited galaxy samples over this redshift range , in order to investigate the evolution of the same galaxy population over time ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "additionally , we have derived @xmath34 color gradients of our galaxy sample , and have shown that massive @xmath0 galaxies have negative color gradients that are comparable to those of low redshift galaxies in the same mass range . these color gradients may partly be caused by radial variations in dust extinction , but it is likely that radial changes in stellar populations play a large role ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this supports a galaxy growth scenario where small galaxies formed at high redshift grow by accreting material onto their outer regions .",
    "however , more detailed studies are needed in order to disentangle dust and stellar age effects on the color gradients of high redshift galaxies .",
    "the results seem to contrast with earlier analyses of galaxies at @xmath0 in the hdfn ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "these authors concluded that all galaxies at this redshift are irregular and compact , with little difference between the rest - frame uv and optical .",
    "field - to - field variations may play a role ; as shown in @xcite the hdfn contains very few massive high - redshift galaxies .",
    "indeed , the galaxies studied by these authors have lower masses ( @xmath53 ) than the galaxies we consider , which could result in the difference with the study presented here .",
    "additionally , we note that recent kinematical studies of massive @xmath0 galaxies also indicate that many contain gas with ordered motion ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the results presented in this letter are fully consistent with those .",
    "our results raise the question at what redshift the first `` ordered '' galaxies appeared , with structures similar to the hubble sequence .",
    "there are indications that at redshifts beyond 3 such galaxies may be much harder to find .",
    "typical high redshift lyman break galaxies are very clumpy and irregular ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and differ significantly in appearance from regular spiral galaxies .",
    "furthermore , the population of massive galaxies that are faint in the uv may be very small at redshifts beyond 3 ( e.g. , @xcite ) , at least in the mass regime that is considered in this paper ( e.g. , @xcite ) . with current observational capabilities",
    "we are severely limited in studying the rest - frame optical properties of galaxies at redshifts beyond @xmath9 , due to rest - frame optical emission moving redward of the observers @xmath54 band . with improved capabilities it may become possible to study the red massive galaxy population at these redshifts .",
    "several candidates have been found at @xmath55 with significant balmer discontinuities ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , and many more are speculated to exist .",
    "these galaxies could very well be the centers of multi - component galaxies at redshifts between @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",

    "we thank the lorentz center for hosting workshops during which this paper was written .",
    "we thank joop schaye , phil hopkins , lars hernquist and rachel somerville for discussions . support from nasa grant hst - go-10808.01-a is gratefully acknowledged .",
