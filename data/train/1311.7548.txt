    "the lyapunov exponents are fundamental quantifiers of chaos @xcite .",
    "the directions in phase space associated with them are generally referred to as the lyapunov vectors ( lvs ) .",
    "it is clear that the lyapunov vectors should play an important role , at least conceptually , in predictability questions in meteorology @xcite and related sciences , or in achieving a microscopic description of many particle systems @xcite .    since 2007",
    "@xcite , there has been a growing awareness in the scientific community that the set of vectors obtained as a byproduct of the standard method to compute the lyapunov exponents @xcite is not the most suitable way of defining the lyapunov vectors due to a series of artefacts these vectors exhibit . the so - called characteristic ( or covariant ) lyapunov vectors ( clvs ) are known since long time ago @xcite to be the only intrinsic ( metric - independent ) basis of lvs , but only since 2007 their computation has become more or less routinary .",
    "the use of these vectors has been probably more abundant in the field of meteorology due to their implication in predictability questions @xcite .",
    "clvs define the so - called oseledec splitting or decomposition of tangent space .",
    "the concept of dominated decomposition is used in the mathematical literature and basically implies that the oseledec subspaces are dynamically isolated .",
    "this is supposed not to be generically the case in extended systems with spatio - temporal chaos @xcite .",
    "however there is a lack of theoretical tools allowing to know in advance how the angles between subspaces should be distributed .",
    "questions concerning the angles between the clvs and the subspaces they span have been addressed numerically in the context of hydrodynamical lyapunov modes @xcite , inertial manifolds @xcite , and hyperbolicity @xcite . in sum",
    "there is a growing interest on the angles among clvs in spatially extended chaotic systems , which reflects in the latest publications on this subject @xcite .    the seminal work by demonstrated that in extensive chaos , the first lv exhibits universal scaling laws in space and time falling into universality class of the kpz equation @xcite . some system - independent scaling laws have been much more recently detected for lvs corresponding to les smaller than the largest one @xcite .",
    "this justifies the expectation that the angle between the lvs should obey as well some universal features at a scaling level . eventually , the final picture of the relations between different clvs should be consistent with the extensive nature of spatio - temporal chaos @xcite .    in this work",
    "we demonstrate that the probability density function ( pdf ) of the angle between the two leading clvs has universal features . for small angle values ,",
    "we uncover a universal ( i.e.  system - independent ) scaling law with the system size .",
    "our theoretical arguments make use of ( i ) the formulas intrinsic to the method by , and ( ii ) the belonging ( under a suitable transformation ) of the first lv to the universality class of the kpz equation .",
    "in a @xmath7-dimensional dynamical system infinitesimal perturbations @xmath8 evolve governed by linear equations ( the so - called ` linear tangent model ' ) . this implies the existence of a linear operator @xmath9 that transforms the perturbation at a given time @xmath10 into the perturbation at another time @xmath11 : @xmath12 with the obvious properties @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "the multiplicative ergodic theorem @xcite ( see e.g. ,  @xcite ) establishes the existence of a limit operator @xmath15^{\\frac{1}{2(t_0-t_1 ) } } \\nonumber\\ ] ] where the asterisk denotes the adjoint operator , such that the logarithms of the eigenvalues of @xmath16 are the les @xmath17 . by convention",
    "we assume @xmath18 .",
    "note that , in contrast to the les , the operator @xmath16 depends on the position in the attractor ( parametrized by @xmath11 ) .",
    "moreover the metric determining the adjoint of @xmath9 is relevant ( although irrelevant concerning the les ) .",
    "thus the eigenvectors of @xmath16 form an orthonormal basis @xmath19 , within the particular metric adopted .",
    "this set of eigenvectors , so - called _ backward _ lvs  @xcite , serve to define a set of nested subspaces .",
    "the first lv @xmath20 generates the straight line @xmath21 corresponding to infinitesimal perturbations at @xmath22 that shrink as @xmath23 as @xmath24 .",
    "@xmath20 and @xmath25 define the plane @xmath26 , such that the modulus of infinitesimal perturbations initially inside @xmath26 , but outside @xmath21 , obeys @xmath27 as @xmath24 .",
    "recursively , we define a set of nested subspaces , @xmath28 such that if @xmath29 then @xmath30 .",
    "( in the case degenerate les exist , trivial modifications in the above expressions have to be performed . ) the backward lvs coincide with the orthonormal vectors obtained as a byproduct of the standard algorithm via gram - schmidt orthogonalizations to compute the les  @xcite .",
    "the oseledec theorem can be also formulated in the opposite time limit , defining an operator @xmath31^{\\frac{1}{2(t_2-t_0)}}\\ ] ] such that the les are the logarithms of the eigenvalues of @xmath32 and the eigenvectors form an orthogonal basis , called the forward lvs @xmath33 .",
    "these vectors are the counterpart of the backward lvs , but now indicating the directions that will grow in the future with exponents @xmath34 . like with the backward lvs",
    ", the gram - schmidt procedure can be used to obtain forward lvs , but now going backwards in time and using the adjoint ( e.g. , the transposed ) jacobian matrix . as noted by",
    ", the use of the transposed jacobian makes the forward lvs to come up with the standard ordering .",
    "this means that to obtain the first @xmath35 forward lvs we need to integrate only @xmath35 perturbations .    for numerical purposes ,",
    "note that computing forward lvs requires to be able to trace backwards a certain trajectory .",
    "this can be done in three different ways :    1 .   storing a complete trajectory in the computer ( ideally in the ram memory ) .",
    "this is adequate if the system is not invertible , or in time - delayed systems @xcite .",
    "2 .   storing periodically the state of the system along the forward integration .",
    "this allows to integrate the system backwards , rectifying the trajectory periodically to cancel out the departure from the attractor ( now , a repellor ) with exponent @xmath36 .",
    "3 .   integrating backward with a `` bit reversible '' algorithm .",
    "this procedure has no cost of memory but it works only with hamiltonian systems @xcite .",
    "the clvs @xmath37 form the only truly intrinsic set of lyapunov vectors , and we will refer to them hereafter simply as the lyapunov vectors .",
    "clvs are the floquet eigenvectors in the case of a periodic orbit , they are independent of the definition of the scalar product , and the associated expansion rates are recovered in both , future and past , limits : @xmath38 this property entails covariance with the ( forward and backward ) dynamics : @xmath39 we use the symbol of proportionality `` @xmath40 '' instead of `` @xmath41 '' because the norm and orientation of the vector is arbitrary .",
    "in 2007 put forward a method to compute the clvs from backward and forward lvs , solving a linear set of equations ( see below ) .",
    "a remarkable feature of wolfe and samelson algorithm is that it contains formulas that should allow to achieve some theoretical progress in questions so far tackled only numerically .",
    "the @xmath35-th ( characteristic ) lv can be expressed as a linear combination of the first @xmath35 backward lvs : @xmath42 wolfe and samelson found that in addition to the first @xmath35 backward lvs , the coefficients @xmath43 require the computation of only the first @xmath44 forward lvs .",
    "( this is a great advantage if @xmath35 is much smaller than the dimension @xmath7 of phase space . )",
    "thus the @xmath35-dimensional vector of coefficients @xmath45 is solution of a equation of the form @xmath46 where the @xmath47 matrix @xmath48 is equal to @xmath49 .",
    "hence , as noticed by kuptsov and parlitz @xcite , it suffices to solve the equation @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the @xmath52-dimensional null vector , and @xmath53 is a @xmath54 matrix with elements @xmath55 @xmath56 denotes the scalar product , and the vectors are assumed to be normalized : @xmath57 .",
    "equation consists of @xmath44 equations for @xmath35 unknowns .",
    "this under - determination is not a problem because ( assuming the le is not degenerate ) there exist an obvious indetermination in the modulus and sign of the lv .",
    "we impose @xmath58",
    "^ 2=1 $ ] , and hence only the orientation of the vector is not specified .",
    "in this work we restrict our study to the angle @xmath0 between the first and the second lvs : @xmath59 as the signs of @xmath60 and @xmath61 are arbitrary , we are free to choose them restricting @xmath0 to the interval @xmath62 $ ] .",
    "after some algebra we can obtain from ( or ) a relation between @xmath0 and the angles between the two leading backward lvs and the main forward lv , @xmath63 and @xmath64 : @xmath65    in a high - dimensional systems forward and backward lvs are expected to be very seldom parallel .",
    "( for instance , the angle @xmath66 between two random vectors in @xmath67 is distributed as @xmath68 . ) hence , the high dimensionality of phase space suggests to work with the displacements from orthogonality : @xmath69 equation ( [ psi ] ) may be written in these new variables : @xmath70 in high - dimensional spaces the constraints of @xmath71 are so weak that we can legitimately expect @xmath72 and @xmath73 to be very similarly distributed .",
    "notice that as a consequence , since @xmath74 , @xmath0 should be in good approximation distributed symmetrically around @xmath75 ( particularly if the system is large ) . moreover , as @xmath72 and @xmath73 are expected to be near zero , their quotient should favour values of @xmath0 close to 0 or @xmath76 . in fact a probability density function ( pdf ) of @xmath0 has been recently measured in numerical simulations of a quasi - one - dimensional system of hard disks by ( see figure 18 ) , finding the aforementioned properties : approximately symmetric around @xmath75 and peaks at 0 and @xmath77 .",
    "these features are also observed in our simulations ( see below ) in one - dimensional systems with extensive chaos .",
    "note though that eq .",
    "is valid in any dimension .",
    "a much finer analysis is needed to understand the statistics of @xmath0 , particularly close to the tangency of leading oseledec subspaces @xmath78 .",
    "this is studied in detail in section [ sec : pdf ] .",
    "in this section we introduce the two systems we have numerically investigated , and present our first numerical results .",
    "the first one is a coupled - map lattice ( cml ) , and the second one is a minimal stochastic model of the lvs .",
    "both systems were previously studied by and , respectively , and are good test - bed systems with generic properties of spatio - temporal chaotic system .",
    "our one - dimensional cml reads : @xmath79+f[u_{j-1}(t)]\\right\\}+(1 - 2\\epsilon ) f[u_j(t)],\\ ] ] where the index @xmath80 runs from 1 to @xmath5 ( the system size ) , with periodic boundary conditions : @xmath81 and @xmath82 . like in @xcite ,",
    "the coupling parameter is chosen to be @xmath83 , and @xmath84 is the logistic map @xmath85 . with these parameters",
    "the system is hyperchaotic with @xmath86 for @xmath87 .",
    "our numerical simulations confirm that as anticipated in the previous section the pdf of @xmath0 is roughly symmetric around @xmath75 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : hist ] .",
    "@xmath88 is peaked at @xmath89 and @xmath77 .",
    "however the distribution is not perfectly symmetric , and this unbalance becomes more significant as the system size increases . which is the asymptotic behaviour of this unbalance as the system size increases",
    "will be a subject for future research .    concerning the spatial organization of the clvs , as they are are known to be highly localized @xcite , a probability of @xmath0 peaked at @xmath89 , is consistent with an intermittent coincidence of the localization sites of the first and second lvs .",
    "this is observed in this cml @xcite and other systems with spatio - temporal chaos @xcite , and in time - delayed systems @xcite .     for the cml and three different system sizes .",
    "the percentages refer to cumulative probabilities @xmath90 and @xmath91.,width=453 ]      in two seminal works and proposed the multiplicative stochastic linear equation @xmath92 as a minimal model for the tangent space dynamic of spatio - temporal chaos .",
    "@xmath93 represents the infinitesimal perturbation and @xmath94 is a stochastic forcing that mimics the chaotic forcing of the field .",
    "@xmath95 is in general short - range correlated , and hence it can be simply assumed to be zero - mean white noise with @xmath96 , as this assumption does not affect the long - scale and long - time scaling properties of @xmath93 . under a hopf - cole transformation , @xmath97 ,",
    "equation becomes the kpz equation @xcite @xmath98 ^ 2 + \\partial_{xx } h(x , t ) , \\label{kpz}\\ ] ] which is a paradigmatic equation in the field of growing rough surfaces @xcite . under a hopf - cole transformation",
    ", the first lv falls into the universality class of the kpz equation .",
    "and thus , the large - scale spatial and temporal scaling properties of the lv are common to very different system types @xcite , excluding hamiltonian lattices @xcite and disordered systems @xcite",
    ".    in dynamical systems generic infinitesimal perturbations tend to align with the first lv , whereas a measure zero set of perturbations may approach saddle - solutions of the linear tangent model , which are precisely the subleading lvs ( i.e. , corresponding to les smaller than the largest one ) . in our previous work",
    "@xcite we resorted to as a minimal equation for the sub - leading lvs .",
    "we assumed sub - leading lvs correspond to saddle solutions of for a given realization of the noise .",
    "in fact we observed that sub - leading lvs in systems with spatio - temporal chaos and the saddle solutions of display the same scaling and statistical properties .",
    "this similarity is realized after after taking the hopf - cole transformation of the lvs @xcite .    in our simulations of the minimal stochastic model we have selected @xmath99 , like in @xcite , for the variance of the noise .",
    "integration of several copies of under periodic orthonormalizations produces a set of vectors with the same spatio - temporal structure than backward lvs @xcite in a typical spatially extended chaotic system .",
    "the equation for forward lvs is exactly the same as ( because the operator in the right - hand side is self - adjoint ) .",
    "this means that a meaningful @xmath35-th clv can be computed from the sets of @xmath35 backward and @xmath44 forward lvs obtained with the standard method @xcite integrating eq .   with independent white noises @xmath100 and @xmath101 , respectively .",
    "note that the obtained clv at time @xmath11 is indeed a saddle solution of ( [ noise ] ) for a particular realization of the noise : @xmath102 ( for @xmath103 ) and @xmath104 ( for @xmath105 ) .",
    "the advantage of this procedure is that we can achieve good statistics for the clvs without the need for time - reversing the trajectory ( i.e.  the noise ) .",
    "the result of our numerical simulations is shown in figure [ fig : hist_ruido ] and , as expected , exhibits the same qualitative features observe in figure [ fig : hist ] for the cml .     for the minimal stochastic model .,width=453 ]",
    "to analyse the asymptotics of @xmath88 for @xmath78 , it is useful to use the log - transformed variable @xmath107 denoted by the subscript @xmath108 , likewise for @xmath109 and @xmath110 .",
    "let @xmath3 be the pdf of @xmath111 , with the trivial relation @xmath112    the occurrence of tangencies ( @xmath106 ) corresponds to a nonvanishing probability at zero , i.e.  @xmath113 .",
    "making a transformation into variable @xmath111 this tranlates into an exponential dependence : @xmath114 this asymptotic dependence in logscale is observed in figure [ scaling_cml](a ) for the cml , and we conclude that @xmath115 with @xmath116 monotonically increasing with @xmath5 . remarkably , despite the similarities observed between the cml and the minimal stochastic model , the latter behaves differently : in figure [ scaling](a ) we may see that the pdf of @xmath111 decays faster than the exponential for the minimal stochastic model . in fact we may proof that @xmath117 : in the minimal stochastic model the first lv ( either backward or forward because obey the same equation ) has the same sign in all the domain @xcite , and in consequence @xmath118 in eq .   can not vanish .",

    "the decay as @xmath121 is faster than @xmath122 , and consistent with @xmath117 .",
    "( b ) data collapse via the scaling relation .",
    "the region of data collapse progressively enlarges as the system size grows.,width=453 ]    the pdf of @xmath0 for the cml and the minimal stochastic model in figures [ fig : hist ] and [ fig : hist_ruido ] look similar , but figures [ scaling_cml](a ) and [ scaling](a ) evidence that the behaviour of the pdf for @xmath123 is very different in each model .",
    "we have found nonetheless that if @xmath0 is small but not extremely small , there exist large enough values of @xmath5 such that the pdf @xmath3 satisfies the scaling relation : @xmath124 we may see in figures [ scaling_cml](b ) and [ scaling](b ) that there is a very good data collapse after scaling @xmath111 by @xmath125 .",
    "only when @xmath126 becomes smaller than a certain value @xmath127 the peculiarities of each model show up .",
    "note that as @xmath127 decreases with @xmath5 the departure from the scaling law is not detectable for large systems .",
    "remarkably the departure from due to the finiteness of @xmath5 occurs upwards for the cml , and downwards for the minimal stochastic model , reflecting their intrinsically different values of @xmath128 .",
    "we emphasize that it is crucial to distinguish between the limit @xmath123 at large ( but finite ) @xmath5 and the limit @xmath129 at small ( but nonzero ) @xmath0 . in the former case",
    "each model exhibits its peculiarities and the stochastic model does not capture the true behaviour for chaotic systems , which we expect to be generally like the cml .",
    "in fact , tangencies are believed to occur between `` physical '' modes @xcite .",
    "however in the limit @xmath129 the stochastic model captures the statistics of @xmath111 in the cml and presumably other chaotic systems .",
    "moreover we can justify the form of the scaling relation in eq .   by virtue of some theoretical arguments that we develop in the next section .",
    "close to tangency we can approximate @xmath130 by @xmath0 . in addition we recall that @xmath72 and @xmath131 can be expected to be close to zero most of the time ( as observed in the simulations , and not shown ) . hence in good approximation : @xmath132 in the log - transformed variables this relation becomes a subtraction @xmath133    let @xmath134 to denote the joint pdf of @xmath109 and @xmath110 .",
    "an auxiliary variable @xmath135 allows to relate @xmath3 and @xmath136 through the integral : @xmath137 where we are assuming @xmath138 .",
    "@xmath72 and @xmath73 are not completely independent variables ( e.g. , in the seldom event that one of them equals @xmath77 the other one becomes 0 ) .",
    "however when both of them are close to zero which occurs most of the time we can expect them to be basically independent and the pdf factorizes : @xmath139 .",
    "we get then @xmath140 we are interested in the @xmath141 limit of this formula .",
    "it is convenient to make a change of variable : @xmath142 , such that @xmath143 this equation suggests that the asymptotics of the pdf of @xmath0 as @xmath123 ( @xmath121 ) is highly influenced ( if not determined ) by @xmath144 .",
    "so we focus our interest in the next section on the distribution of @xmath72 .",
    "recall @xmath145 is the angle between the first backward lv and the first forward lv . in a previous work @xcite we found that both vectors are well modeled by the multiplicative stochastic equation ( [ noise ] ) . as we reasoned in sec .",
    "[ msm ] the stochastic equation can be used to get the statistics of characteristic lvs .",
    "we have to integrate the fields @xmath146 and @xmath147 , and the angle @xmath145 between them is obtained from a continuous version of the euclidean scalar product ( in practice the fields are discretized so we compute the usual euclidean scalar product ) : @xmath148    a logarithmic transformation allows to define the associated surface for the first backward lv , @xmath149 , and the first forward lv , @xmath150 . under this transformation @xmath151 and @xmath152",
    "are governed by the kpz equation .",
    "we further decompose @xmath151 into the spatial average and the fluctuating part @xmath153 ( and likewise for @xmath152 ) .",
    "@xmath154 is fixed by the norm of the vector and therefore the result must be independent of the norm used .",
    "some algebra yields the expression : @xmath155 @xmath156 and @xmath157 are independent profiles _ with zero mean_. in particular , @xmath156 and @xmath157 are at long scales indistinguishable from a brownian path in one dimension , see @xcite , like solutions of the kpz equation . this kind of integrals in have been subject of some mathematical interest @xcite but unfortunately the theory is not mature yet as to provide results that one can readily use here , specially if different integrals are correlated .    equation ( [ integral2 ] ) suggests small @xmath111 is controlled by the pdf asymptotic behaviour of @xmath158 , so we make the approximation @xmath159 , in the left hand side of ( [ bbb ] ) .",
    "next , taking the logarithms we obtain : @xmath160      from eq .  , and",
    "recalling @xmath156 and @xmath157 are like two independent brownian paths , we can expect a scaling with the system size of the form @xmath161 .",
    "this is expected to translate to @xmath111 in the form of the scaling relation in eq .  .",
    "we may also conjecture that in two spatial dimensions the scaling factor in should be @xmath162 , @xmath163 @xcite , instead of @xmath125 .",
    "we can also conjecture that in the minimal stochastic model the pdf @xmath88 vanishes not only at @xmath106 but in an interval below a certain value @xmath164 ; i.e.  @xmath165 .",
    "note that in the most unfavourable situation , if @xmath166 , the numerator of equals @xmath5 . and",
    "the denominator is maximal if @xmath156 ( and @xmath157 ) has a triangular shape . in this case",
    "the denominator grows exponentially with @xmath5 , and in turn @xmath109 is likely to have the infimum @xmath167 decreasing exponentially with @xmath5 .",
    "hence @xmath168 , and looking at eq .",
    "we presume a similar dependence for the bound for @xmath169 .",
    "in the first part of this paper we have seen that wolfe and samelson formulas allow to foresee the general form of @xmath88 , which should be general in high - dimensional systems and irrespective of the dissipative or conservative character of the dynamics and of the spatial dimensionality . in the second part of the paper",
    ", we obtained a scaling law resorting to a minimal stochastic model of the lvs for spatio - temporal chaos .",
    "the reason for the general validity of our scaling law is that although specific system - dependent correlations between forward and backward lvs exist due to the deterministic nature of the dynamics , these correlations are not expected to span much beyond the lyapunov time @xmath170 . in contrast , in typical systems with spatio - temporal chaos @xcite , see also @xcite , the backward ( forward ) lvs depend on the past ( future ) within large temporal range of order @xmath171 ( with @xmath172 for the kpz universality class in one spatial dimension ) .",
    "our scaling should be generally observed in spatially extended systems , but the exact asymptotics of the pdf at extremely small @xmath0 is specific for each system , which would be far beyond numerical capabilities already for moderately large systems .",
    "our results should be taken into account in numerical experiments with clvs because if @xmath5 is large we may not detect what is peculiar for each model , but just generic model - independent features .",
