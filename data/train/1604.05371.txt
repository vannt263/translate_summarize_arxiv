    "<S> we derive electronic structure models for weakly interacting bilayers such as graphene - graphene and graphene - hexagonal boron nitride , based on density functional theory calculations followed by wannier transformation of electronic states . </S>",
    "<S> these transferable interlayer coupling models can be applied to investigate the physics of bilayers with arbitrary translations and twists . </S>",
    "<S> the functional form , in addition to the dependence on the distance , includes the angular dependence that results from higher angular momentum components in the wannier @xmath0 orbitals . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate the capabilities of the method by applying it to a rotated graphene bilayer , which produces the analytically predicted renormalization of the fermi velocity , van hove singularities in the density of states , and moir pattern of the electronic localization at small twist angles . </S>",
    "<S> we further extend the theory to obtain the effective couplings by integrating out neighboring layers . </S>",
    "<S> this approach is instrumental for the design of van der walls heterostructures with desirable electronic features and transport properties and for the derivation of low - energy theories for graphene stacks , including proximity effects from other layers . </S>"
