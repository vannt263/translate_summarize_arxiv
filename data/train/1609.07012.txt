    "magnetic skyrmions correspond to localized spin configurations , where the directions of the magnetic moments span the whole unit sphere@xcite . due to their small size and the ability to set them into motion with significantly smaller current densities than magnetic domain walls@xcite",
    ", they hold promising aspects as bits of information in future magnetic logic and memory devices@xcite . recently",
    ", their creation and manipulation was also demonstrated experimentally under room - temperature environments@xcite .",
    "although localized spin configurations also exist as metastable states in the two - dimensional scale - free heisenberg model@xcite , stabilizing the radius of magnetic bubbles or skyrmions requires a further interaction term in the hamiltonian .",
    "the possible candidates for such an interaction identified so far include the magnetostatic dipolar interaction@xcite , the dzyaloshinsky  moriya interaction@xcite , the frustration of heisenberg - type exchange interactions@xcite , and four - spin interactions@xcite .",
    "although bubble domains created by the dipolar interaction have been discussed already in the 1960s@xcite , recent investigations have mostly focused on dzyaloshinsky  moriya systems since the discovery of the skyrmion lattice phase in mnsi@xcite .",
    "this type of interaction only appears in noncentrosymmetric systems , and is caused by the spin ",
    "orbit coupling .",
    "besides in bulk materials of certain symmetry classes@xcite , the presence of skyrmions has also been demonstrated in ultrathin and multilayer films@xcite .",
    "these layered systems naturally break inversion symmetry , and combining heavy nonmagnetic elements with magnetic transition metals provides a way of enhancing the dzyaloshinsky ",
    "moriya interaction@xcite .",
    "localized topological spin configurations may be classified according to the topological charge @xmath6 and the helicity @xmath7@xcite . in dzyaloshinsky  moriya systems a given rotational sense of the spins is preferred , which selects a fixed value of topological charge and helicity for magnetic skyrmions .",
    "in contrast , dipolar systems allow for two helicity values which are degenerate in energy@xcite , while in frustrated systems a continuous degeneracy arises@xcite .",
    "furthermore , the presence of biskyrmions ( bound pairs of skyrmions ) was recently demonstrated in several centrosymmetric materials@xcite .",
    "skyrmions with different topological charges have also been identified in numerical calculations and simulations performed for frustrated systems@xcite . in this paper",

    "@xcite that the competition between ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic isotropic exchange interactions is sufficiently strong in the considered system to create an oscillating skyrmion - skyrmion interaction potential , previously only calculated for frustrated centrosymmetric systems@xcite . here",
    "we will demonstrate that the same mechanism is also capable of stabilizing localized spin configurations with topological charges @xmath8 and @xmath9 , although the dzyaloshinsky ",
    "moriya interaction deforms their shape .",

    "[ sec2 ] , we present the parameters of the model hamiltonian , and discuss the spin dynamics simulation method . in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] , we introduce the topological charge @xmath6 , the vorticity @xmath10 , and the helicity @xmath7 in the continuum model , which quantities characterize the different types of skyrmions .",

    "[ sec4 ] , with a detailed discussion about the preferred orientation of skyrmions with respect to the lattice in sec .",
    "the conclusions are drawn in sec .",
    "[ sec6 ] .",
    "the topological characterization of different skyrmions by calculated spin - polarized scanning tunneling microscopy images is treated in ref .",
    "@xcite , the second part of this paper .",
    "for the description of the fe magnetic moments in the ( pt@xmath2ir@xmath3)/fe / pd@xmath4 ultrathin film , we have applied a model hamiltonian with classical spins @xmath11 , @xmath12 where @xmath13 denotes the external magnetic field .",
    "the magnetic moment @xmath14 , the coupling coefficients @xmath15 and the on - site anisotropy tensor @xmath16 have been determined from _ ab initio _ calculations based on the screened korringa ",

    "moriya interaction . finally , we mention that the difference between the diagonal components of @xmath15 will induce an energy difference between the out - of - plane and in - plane ferromagnetic orientations , which we will refer to as two - site anisotropy .",
    "the interaction coefficients between the fe spins are summarized in table  [ table1 ] .",
    "the ground state of the system is a right - rotating cycloidal spin spiral state , which transforms into the collinear field - polarized state when a magnetic field of @xmath21 is applied perpendicularly to the surface@xcite .",
    "we will identify the topological objects in this field - polarized state .",
    "we note that the metastable localized spin configurations reported below could also be observed with the other sets of interaction parameters reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , obtained for different concentrations of ir in the overlayer .",
    ".isotropic exchange interactions @xmath22 and in - plane components of the dzyaloshinsky",
    " moriya vectors @xmath23 between the fe spins as a function of their distance @xmath24 , given in terms of the lattice constant of the triangular lattice on the pd@xmath4 surface ( @xmath25 ) .",

    "@xmath28 denotes that the dzyaloshinsky  moriya vector prefers the right - handed rotation of the spins , @xmath29 stands for left - handed rotation .",
    "the magnetic moment is @xmath30 .",
    "the total anisotropy energy between the out - of - plane and in - plane orientations is @xmath31 , which includes both on - site and two - site contributions.[table1 ] [ cols=\">,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     as it was discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] , topological objects with @xmath32 always possess both right - handed and left - handed segments . since the dzyaloshinsky ",
    "moriya interaction switches the preferred domain wall direction for right - handed walls , for left - handed walls the preferred direction must be the same as for the isotropic interactions , since these domain walls lose energy due to the chiral interaction . in this case",
    ", the antiskyrmion with @xmath33 can minimize its energy when its left - handed cross - section is along the @xmath34 $ ] axis or a symmetrically equivalent direction ( next - nearest neighbors on the lattice ) , which yields the value @xmath35 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3a](e ) .",
    "simultaneously , its right - handed cross - section is along the perpendicular @xmath36 $ ] direction ( nearest neighbors on the lattice ) , which is also energetically favorable .",
    "we could not observe such a preferred orientation when we used only isotropic exchange interactions in the simulations as in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] ; this is expected as the domain wall energy does not depend on the rotational sense of the spins in this case .",
    "the same argument can be used to explain the orientation of the `` chimera '' skyrmion , since the only difference is that the completely left - handed cross - section is replaced by a pair of left - handed and right - handed @xmath37 domain walls following each other . in the skyrmion with @xmath0 , a full @xmath38 left - handed domain wall can only be observed when moving along its short axis , which is parallel to the @xmath34 $ ] direction . along the long axis , one can observe a @xmath38 right - handed domain wall , with a shorter segment with reversed chirality in the middle ; this is the preferred orientation of right - handed domain walls according to table  [ table4 ] .    regarding the skyrmion with @xmath39 , the above argument would predict that its longer axis , containing mostly right - handed domain walls , would be oriented along the nearest - neighbor direction ( @xmath40 ) , while it is parallel to the next - nearest - neighbor direction ( @xmath41 ) in fig .",
    "[ fig3a](b ) .",
    "this discrepancy may be explained by the very strongly distorted spin configuration , resembling two individual skyrmions along the next - nearest - neighbor direction ( @xmath41 ) which are weakly connected to each other . as it was demonstrated in ref .",
    "@xcite , the next - nearest - neighbor direction is preferable for creating bonds between individual skyrmions . increasing the field to @xmath42 ( see table  [ table2 ] ) compresses the skyrmion with @xmath39 into a more circular shape , and its preferred orientation on the lattice also rotates to @xmath40 , which value is in agreement with the prediction based on left - handed and right - handed domain walls .",
    "finally , we note that the above argument is insufficient for explaining the orientation of the antiskyrmion with @xmath1 with respect to the lattice , because its cross - section along the symmetry axes of the triangle corresponds to a pair of right - rotating and left - rotating @xmath37 domain walls .",
    "we have examined localized metastable spin configurations in the field - polarized state of ( pt@xmath2ir@xmath3)/fe bilayer on pd@xmath4 surface by using spin dynamics calculations .",
    "the interaction parameters in the hamiltonian have been determined from _ ab initio _",
    "methods earlier@xcite .",
    "we could identify objects with topological charges @xmath43 and @xmath9 , and explained their presence by the interplay between the frustrated isotropic exchange interactions and the dzyaloshinsky  moriya interaction .    in agreement with the theoretical prediction based on the continuum model , we have demonstrated that the dzyaloshinsky ",
    "moriya interaction selects skyrmions with @xmath5 as the energetically most favorable configuration .",
    "however , the other topological objects also remain stable due to the presence of the frustrated isotropic exchange interactions , although their shape becomes distorted because of the chiral interaction , and they assume preferred orientations on the lattice . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the second part of this paper , it is discussed how the skyrmions can be characterized by scanning tunneling microscopy images .    it was demonstrated in ref .",
    "@xcite that if only isotropic exchange interactions are considered , the extra degree of freedom connected to the helicity of the skyrmions significantly influences their current - driven motion . in the system considered in this paper , this continuous symmetry is broken by the presence of the dzyaloshinsky  moriya interaction , but rotating the topological objects by @xmath44 still leads to an energetically degenerate configuration due to the symmetry of the lattice .",
    "this discrete symmetry offers new implications for the current - driven motion of skyrmions with different topological charges .",
