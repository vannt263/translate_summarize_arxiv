    "fractional delay filters are digital filters to delay discrete - time signals by a fractional amount of the sampling period .",
    "such filters have wide applications in signal processing , including sampling rate conversion  @xcite , nonuniform sampling  @xcite , wavelet transform  @xcite , digital modeling of musical instruments  @xcite , to name a few . for more applications ,",
    "see survey papers  @xcite .    conventionally , fractional delay filters are designed based on the shannon sampling theorem  @xcite for strictly bandlimited analog signals . based on this theory ,",
    "the optimal filter coefficients are obtained by sampling a delayed sinc function .",
    "this ideal low - pass filter is however not realizable because of its non - causality and instability , and hence many studies have focused their attention on approximating the ideal filter by , for example , windowed sinc functions  @xcite , maximally - flat fir approximation  @xcite , all - pass approximation  @xcite , and minmax ( chebyshev ) optimization  @xcite .",
    "in particular , @xmath2 ( or weighted least - squares ) design has been prevalent in the literature  @xcite .",
    "this method minimizes the @xmath2 norm of the weighted difference between the ideal low - pass filter and a filter to be designed , and is based on the projection theorem in hilbert space .",
    "there are , however , two major drawbacks in this conventional approach .",
    "one is that due to the averaging nature of the @xmath3 criterion , the obtained frequency response can have a sharp peak at a certain frequency , thereby yielding a poor performance at that frequency , while still maintaining small @xmath3 error in the overall frequency response .",
    "the other is that @xmath3 criterion can yield a truncated frequency response as an optimal approximant of the ideal low - pass filter , which yields a distortion due to the gibbs phenomenon in the time domain .",
    "furthermore , such a design is mostly executed in the discrete - time domain , which yields poor intersample response .    in view of these problems",
    "we employ _ sampled - data @xmath1 optimization , _ recently introduced for signal processing by  @xcite .",
    "this is based on _ sampled - data control theory _",
    "@xcite which accounts for the mixed nature of _ continuous- and discrete - time _ thereby enabling optimization of the intersample signals via discrete - time controllers ( filters ) .",
    "this also allows for optimization according to the @xmath1 norm , namely _ minimizing the maximum of the error frequency response_. this worst - case design is clearly desirable in that it does not have the drawback due to the averaging property of the @xmath3 criterion . due to the nature of the @xmath0 norm ,",
    "however , this optimization problem has been difficult to solve , but one can now utilize a standardized method to solve this class of problems  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the obtained filter shows greater robustness against unknown disturbances due to the nature of the _ uniform attenuation _ of the error frequency response ; see  @xcite for details . based on this @xmath0 optimization method",
    ", we formulate the design of fractional delay filters as a sampled - data @xmath1 optimization problem , appendix [ app : proof1 ] ) .",
    "simulation results in section [ sec : example ] are also new . ] .    in order to optimize the intersample behavior",
    ", we must deal with both continuous- and discrete - time signals , and hence the overall system is not time - invariant .",
    "the key to solving this problem is _ lifting _ , which is introduced in the early studies of modern sampled - data control theory  @xcite . indeed",
    ", continuous - time lifting gives an exact , not approximated , time - invariant discrete - time model for a sampled - data system , albeit with infinite - dimensional input and output spaces .",
    "hence the problem of the mixed time sets is circumvented without approximation .",
    "lifting can also be interpreted as a _ continuous - time blocking or polyphase decomposition_. as in multirate signal processing  @xcite , lifting makes it possible to capture continuous - time signals and systems in the discrete - time domain without approximation ; see section [ subsec : lifting ] for details .",
    "the remaining system becomes a _ time - invariant discrete - time _",
    "system , albeit with infinite - dimensional input and output spaces . in view of this infinite - dimensionality",
    ", we retain the term lifting to avoid confusion . with such a representation , we show that our design problem is reducible to a finite - dimensional discrete - time @xmath1 optimization without approximation .",
    "this type of @xmath1 optimization is easily solvable by standard softwares such as matlab  @xcite .    in some applications , digital filters with variable delay responses ( _ variable fractional delay filters _",
    "@xcite ) are desired . in this case",
    ", a filter should have a tunable delay parameter , and hence a closed - form formula should be derived .",
    "in general , @xmath1 optimal filters are difficult to solve analytically .",
    "however , we provide a closed - form formula of the optimal filter with the delay variable as a parameter under the assumption that the underlying frequency characteristic of continuous - time input signals is governed by a low - pass filter of first order . while this assumption may appear somewhat restrictive , it covers many typical cases and variations by some robustness properties @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec : problem ] defines fractional delay filters , and reviews a standard @xmath3 design method .",
    "we then reformulate our design problem as a sampled - data @xmath1 optimization to overcome the difficulty due to the @xmath3 design .",
