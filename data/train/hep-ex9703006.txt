    "the former would give a larger average number of @xmath10 and @xmath11 quarks , @xmath46 , per @xmath0 decay . since @xmath47 and @xmath48 transitions ( where the @xmath49 can also be the decay product of charm resonance ) account for a large fraction of the charm quarks produced in @xmath0 decay , it is important to measure accurately the branching fractions for these transitions .",
