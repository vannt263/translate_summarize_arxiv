    "the quintuplet cluster ( afgl  2004 ) , roughly 30  pc in projection from the nucleus of the galaxy , contains a number of massive and luminous stars which are not detected at visible wavelengths due to heavy extinction by dust along the line of sight",
    ". some of the brightest of these stars are enshrouded by circumstellar dust and have featureless infrared spectra , apart from interstellar absorption bands ( okuda et al .",
    "others are not enshrouded and show line absorption and emission from their photospheres and winds .",
    "cotera et al .",
    "( 1996 ) and figer et al .",
    "( 1998 , hereafter f98 ) have demonstrated that one such object , originally reported as object no . 25 by nagata et al .",
    "( 1993 ) , first singled out by moneti , glass & moorwood ( 1994 ) , and now known as the pistol star , has a luminosity of @xmath2  , making it one of the most luminous stars known .",
    "figer , mclean and morris ( 1995 ) suggested that this star is a luminous blue variable ( lbv ) , a hypothesis supported by its position in the hr diagram ( f98 ) , photometric variability ( glass et al 1999 ; figer , mclean , & morris 1999a , hereafter fmm99 ) , and circumstellar ejecta ( figer et al .",
    "1999b ) .",
    "fmm99 have recently identified a second candidate lbv in the quintuplet cluster , their source 362 , hereafter 362 .",
    "the identification was based on the star s infrared brightness , photometric variability ( confirmed by glass et al .",
    "1999 ) , and a low - resolution spectrum obtained by figer ( 1997 , unpublished ) .",
    "photometry by fmm99 and by glass et al .",
    "suggest that at maximum 362  is nearly as bright as the pistol star .",
    "we have obtained spectra of 362  in the h and k bands and near 4  at ukirt with the facility 1 - 5  grating spectrometer , cgs4 , which was configured with a 256x256 insb array and a 0.6  ( one - pixel ) wide slit .",
    "an observing log is provided in table  1 .",
    "the nearby featureless quintuplet source gcs  3 - 2 ( nagata et al 1990 , okuda et al . 1990 ; also listed as source 2 by glass et al 1990 ; as source 24 in nagata et al 1993 and source vr 5 - 2 in moneti , glass & moorwood 1994 ) was used as a comparison star , although it is a suspected variable ( glass et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "the h and k spectra were wavelength - calibrated with the aid of arc lamp spectra .",
    "the 4  spectrum was wavelength - calibrated by comparison to the spectrum of the planetary nebula ngc  6572 ( @xmath3 = @xmath4",
    "/s ) . flux calibration in the h and k bands assumed that the dereddened spectrum of gcs  3 - 2 is that of a 889  k blackbody ( okuda et al .",
    "1990 ) with k  =  6.28 ( glass et al . 1999 ) .",
    "because of the uncertainty in this approximation , the line fluxes far from 2.2  and the overall spectral shape are probably not accurate . from our data we derive k=7.5 for 362 .",
    "the brightness is consistent with previous photometry .",
    "we believe that our relative spectrophotometry is accurate to @xmath520% .",
    "the low resolution k - band spectrum of 362  from 1999 is shown in fig .",
    "1 and the higher resolution spectra are shown in figs .",
    "2  4 . measured parameters of detected lines are given in table  2 .",
    "we note a modest , but significant weakening of those spectral lines ( 2.102.18  ) observed on both dates . in spectral intervals where both the pistol star and 362  have been measured ,",
    "their spectra are quite similar .",
    "in addition to lines of hydrogen , the same permitted lines of sodium , magnesium , and iron are in emission in both stars and the he i lines , where clearly detected , are in absorption . the principal difference between",
    "the spectra is the lower equivalent widths of lines ( in particular those of hydrogen ) in 362 .",
    "a possible additional difference between the two stars is that forbidden lines are clearly seen only in the pistol star .",
    "however , these are weak and , considering the smaller equivalent widths of the lines in 362 , non - detections there are probably not surprising .    the 4  spectrum ( fig .",
    "2 ) is dominated by a strong hydrogen br  @xmath6 line at 4.05  , which because of its strength and equivalent width appears more suitable than other lines for providing accurate velocity information .",
    "the  5 - 4 triplet line , shifted @xmath7  /s  relative to br  @xmath6 , is weak but clearly present .",
    "although the core of the br  @xmath6 line is symmetric , even after allowing for the  line there is considerably more emission at high negative velocities than at high positive velocities .",
    "this is caused by continuum opacity ( najarro et al 1998a ) , which weakens the redshifted emission wing , an effect also evident in the pistol star ( figer et al .",
    "we estimate that in 362  the wings extend roughly to -250  /s and + 125  /s  from the peak , somewhat further than those of the pistol star .",
    "the velocity of peak emission is + 121  @xmath5  15  /s  ( lsr ) .",
    "this is very close to the velocity of 130  /s  determined for the pistol star ( f98 ) and other members of the cluster ( figer 1995 ) , clearly establishing 362  as a cluster member .    a number of ,  and  lines are prominent in figs . 3 - 4 . the  5s@xmath8s@xmath9 - 5p@xmath8p@xmath10  1.691  and 5s@xmath8s@xmath9 - 5p@xmath8p@xmath9",
    "1.698  doublet is a powerful diagnostic tool , as it appears in emission for only a very narrow range of stellar temperatures and wind density structures , indicating the presence of amplified nlte effects ( najarro et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "several of the  lines observed in the h and k - bands have the 5p@xmath11p level in common .",
    "those with it as the upper level ( the 2.13/14  and 2.40/41  doublets ) are much stronger than those with it as a lower level ( in the h band ) , revealing that pumping through the resonance 3s@xmath11s - np@xmath11p lines must be a significant populator of the np@xmath11p levels .",
    "two types of lines are found for : the so - called semi - forbidden lines ( denoted in table  2 and in the figures by single left - hand brackets ) such as  z@xmath12f@xmath13-c@xmath12f@xmath13 1.688  and  z@xmath12f@xmath10-c@xmath12f@xmath10  2.089  with very weak oscillator strengths ( gf@xmath1410@xmath15 ) which form in the outer stellar wind ; and permitted ( gf@xmath141 ) lines connecting higher lying levels , such as the e@xmath16g-5p@xmath16f lines near 1.733  , which form much closer to the atmosphere .    except for br  @xmath6 ( 54 ) ,",
    "the rest of the observed brackett series lines ( 114 , 104 , and 74 ) show p cygni profiles with the emission strengthening and absorption weakening with decreasing series number .",
    "this is expected in a dense wind where line emission increasingly overwhelms the absorption profiles for lower series ( higher oscillator strength ) lines , since these form further away from the photosphere .",
    "the same trend is seen in the humphreys series ( 146 ) hydrogen line at 4.02  . because of non - negligible continuum opacity effects at 4  , br  @xmath6 can only provide a lower limit to .",
    "the  z@xmath12f@xmath13-c@xmath12f@xmath13 1.688  line profile is much less influenced by opacity effects . from it",
    "we estimate  to be @xmath17160  /s .",
    "finally , it is noteworthy that the 1.700  and 2.112  lines of  appear weakly in absorption , while the  2.06  line is not convincingly detected and the ( 54 ) emission components around br  @xmath6 are very weak .",
    "this behavior , together with the complete absence of  lines , is a strong indicator of a low temperature ( and low ionization state ) .",
    "a rough estimate of basic stellar parameters of 362  can be made by comparison of its spectrum with that of the pistol star , for which values have been derived ( f98 ) .",
    "in particular , the presence of the  lines in absorption as well as observed ratio of the fe  ii 2.089  and  2.14  lines tightly constrain the parameters of 362  as they did for the pistol star .",
    "for the pistol star two families of models with t@xmath18 = 14,000  k , l = 10@xmath19  and t@xmath18 = 21,000  k ,",
    "l = 10@xmath20  fit the r  @xmath17  1,000 infrared spectra .",
    "new higher resolution spectra of the pistol star ( najarro et al .",
    "1998b ) , when analyzed with the model atmospheres of hillier and miller ( 1998 ) , favor the lower temperature solution .",
    "given the similarities in their spectra , the effective temperature of 362  probably also is low ; additional support for this is given in section 4.3 .",
    "monitoring has shown that the stars are nearly the same average brightness at k , whereas in 1996 the pistol star was 0.5 mag brighter than 362  at j band ( figer , mclean and morris 1996 ) .",
    "assuming that the two stars have the same temperature and that in 362  the infrared bound - free and free - free excess in the continuum is negligible ( as is the case for the pistol star below 3  ) , their luminosity ratio is given by the extinction - corrected flux ratio . from the close proximity of the two stars it is reasonable to assume that the extinctions are the same , indicating that 362  is at least half as luminous as the pistol star .      as there are only about a half dozen lbvs known in the galaxy ( nota et al .",
    "1995 ) , one must question the identification of two lbvs in a single cluster .",
    "however , the quintuplet is one of the most massive young clusters in the galaxy , containing over 150 o - stars at birth ( fmm99 ) and lbvs are thought to be evolved o - stars ( see langer et al .",
    "1994 for one proposed evolutionary sequence ) .",
    "the cluster age , 4  myr ( fmm99 ) , is that when o - stars should be evolving through the lbv stage .",
    "the number of cluster lbv stars at any time during this stage is roughly n@xmath21 = ( @xmath22lifetime)/(@xmath23/n@xmath24 ) = 25,000 yr/(6 myr/150 o - stars ) = 2/3 , where @xmath23 is the production timescale .",
    "there are many uncertainties in this estimate : e.g. , the assumptions that all o - stars become lbvs ; that the lbv lifetime is roughly equal to the ratio of known galactic lbvs to known galactic o - stars times a typical o - star lifetime ; and that the o - stars become lbvs at a constant rate .",
    "nevertheless , we conclude that it is not unreasonable to find two lbvs in this cluster .",
    "the equivalent widths of the emission lines in 362  are lower than in the pistol star , not only for hydrogen , but also for , , , and .",
    "this suggests that the stellar wind of 362  is less dense than that of the pistol star .",
    "our inference that the bound - free and free - free contributions to the continuum are insignificant below 3  lead us to conclude that the equivalent widths of the emission lines are proportional to the wind density ( see simon et al 1983 or najarro 1995 ) and hence that the value of /r@xmath8 for 362  is roughly a factor of two less than for the pistol star . from luminosity considerations we estimate ( r*@xmath25/r*@xmath26  @xmath17  1.5 .",
    "taking into account the scaling equations for  and r ( najarro et al 1997 ) and that @xmath27  @xmath17  160  /s ( from the  1.688  line ) we conclude that @xmath25  @xmath17  1.5  @xmath27 .",
    "important constraints on the stellar temperature ( ionization ) are set by the weakness of the  2.06  line and especially by the weakness of the  ( 5 - 4 ) components near 4.05  .",
    "the observed ratio of the h and  component exceeds by a large factor the expected value even for cosmic  value , if there were any significant amount of  in the wind .",
    "this indicates that  must recombine to  very close to the photosphere , implying an upper limit of around 13,000  k for the temperature of the object",
    ". a lower limit on the effective temperature is set by the non - detection of the 3s@xmath113p@xmath11s@xmath9 - 3s@xmath114p@xmath11p@xmath10  2.180  and 3s@xmath113p@xmath11s@xmath9 - 3s@xmath114p@xmath11p@xmath9  2.209  intercombination lines of  in absorption ( note that the latter would be contaminated by  emission ) , since these lines are expected to be in absorption if the temperature is below 10,000  k.    from the observed weak  lines one might easily conclude that helium is not enhanced at all .",
    "however , preliminary analysis ( najarro et al , in preparation ) shows that an enhancement as large as he / h@xmath141 can be completely masked . only the 2.06  line is strengthened by increasing he / h to this value , but the strength of this line also depends strongly on blanketing .",
    "the spectrum of 362 at 2.06  has been observed at low resolution only .",
    "therefore , although we suspect that the value of he / h is not far from normal , we can not rule out a much higher value .",
    "finally , we consider the abundances of mg , si , and fe .",
    "the striking similarity of the  lines in 362  to those in the pistol star support a higher than solar mg abundance for 362  ( najarro et al 1998b ) .",
    "the case of the  lines is different .",
    "although in principle a high si abundance is needed to obtain the h band lines in emission , the behavior of these lines is controlled to first order by the wind density structure and to second order by the effective temperature .",
    "different velocity fields and transition zones between photosphere and wind can easily mask a factor of five change in si abundance ( producing similar  1.7  emission line strengths and profiles ) , even if the stars have the same effective temperature , radius , and mass - loss rate .    to derive the iron abundance two sets of  lines can be used .",
    "the z@xmath12f - c@xmath12f lines are formed in the outer regions of the wind where the levels suffer from severe departures from lte .",
    "line strengths are extremely sensitive to the ionization structure of fe in the outer wind .",
    "initial tests ( najarro et al 1998b ) showed that a high iron abundance is required to reproduce these semi - forbidden lines . however , if charge exchange reactions fe@xmath28  +  h  @xmath29   fe@xmath30  +  h@xmath31 are included ( see oliva et al 1989 and hillier 1998 ) , the ionization structure of fe can be dramatically altered in the outer parts of the wind , producing a net enhancement of  and increased strengths of the semi - forbidden lines , implying a lower fe abundance .",
    "the e@xmath16f-5p@xmath16d transitions , arising from higher lying levels which are formed much closer to the star s photosphere , also are available .",
    "their successful use as abundance diagnostics depends crucially on the reliability of the atomic  data . for the important infrared lines of  important discrepancies",
    "exist between the best two available datasets : the iron project data ( seaton et al .",
    "1994 ) and the data of kurucz ( 1999 ) .",
    "first tests using an model  atom which optimizes both datasets for the e@xmath16f-5p@xmath16d transitions favor an fe abundance not very far from solar , a value that has been recently found by carr et al ( 1999 ) for the galactic center source irs  7 .",
    "thus both  line diagnostic methods may converge to a unique iron abundance and the derived iron abundance may be compatible with the enhanced magnesium and silicon values .",
    "it is necessary to perform accurate quantitative analysis to obtain more realistic estimates of the metallicity and stellar parameters of 362 .",
    "we have begun such work following the method described in najarro et al ( 1998b ) ; the results will be presented in detail elsewhere ( najarro et al , in preparation ) .",
    "the united kingdom infrared telescope is operated by the joint astronomy centre on behalf of the u.k . particle physics and research council .",
    "we thank the staff of the joint astronomy centre for its support of these measurements .",
    "we also are grateful to d. j. hillier for his atmospheric code .",
