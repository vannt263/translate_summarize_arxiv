    "it is now clear from the deepest chandra and xmm observations ( e.g. , @xcite ) that a combination of obscured and unobscured active galactic nuclei ( agn ) are needed to explain the observed properties of the extragalactic x - ray background ( xrb ) . while unobscured agn are readily detected using , for example , optical color - selection techniques , the optical - uv - soft x - ray signatures of nuclear activity are not visible in obscured agn , making their detection and identification much harder .",
    "the effects of obscuration are less important at high energies , hence deep , hard x - ray ( 210  kev ) surveys with chandra and xmm have revealed a less biased view of the agn population ( e.g , @xcite and references therein ) , although they are still insensitive to the most obscured sources , like compton - thick agn ( e.g. , @xcite ) . however , these surveys rely mostly on optical spectroscopy to find redshifts and thus luminosities , hence they preferentially exclude obscured agn , which have fainter optical counterparts ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "this means the observed spectroscopically identified population is not representative of the underlying agn population .    one fundamental ingredient in our understanding of the agn population is the ratio of obscured to unobscured agn , and whether this ratio depends on parameters like intrinsic luminosity or redshift .",
    "according to the unification paradigm @xcite , the ratio depends on the geometry of the circumnuclear obscuring material . in the simplest version of unification",
    ", this ratio is independent of source properties like luminosity or redshift .",
    "however , there are physical reasons to expect a dependence ; for example , more luminous accretion disk emission may correspond to a larger dust sublimation radius @xcite , thus increasing the fraction of unobscured agn at higher luminosities .",
    "similarly , if the dust content of the agn host galaxy is important for the obscuration of the central engine , a dependence of the obscured agn fraction on redshift would be expected ( e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) , given the evolution of the amount of dust in galaxies .",
    "thus , a measurement of the fraction of obscured agn and its possible dependence on critical parameters can be used to study agn structure and to probe the connection between agn activity and the formation of the host galaxy .",
    "the xrb also constrains the fraction of obscured agn .",
    "early agn population synthesis models for the xrb ( e.g. , @xcite ) required a strong increase of the fraction with redshift , while recent versions ( e.g. , @xcite ) assume only a decrease with increasing luminosity , although @xcite concluded that a evolving obscured agn fraction provides a better fit .",
    "deep x - ray surveys confirm that the obscured agn fraction depends on luminosity @xcite , while the dependence on redshift is less clear .",
    "@xcite , using a larger heterogeneous sample and x - ray spectral fitting to classify agn , concluded that the relative fraction of obscured agn increases with redshift .",
    "however , although @xcite found a similar evolution , they concluded from simulations that such a correlation can be induced by the k correction of the x - ray spectra .",
    "in this work , we generate an agn sample with high optical spectroscopic completeness , the largest such sample to date by a factor of @xmath104 , in order to study the evolution of the obscured agn fraction . using optical spectroscopy",
    "we characterize agn as unobscured if they have broad emission lines , and we measure the dependence of the obscured fraction on redshift . throughout this paper",
    "we assume @xmath11 km s @xmath7 mpc@xmath7 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "to distinguish between the effects of redshift and luminosity , our sample needs to probe a range of luminosities at each redshift over a reasonable a range of redshifts .",
    "wide area , shallow x - ray surveys sample moderate luminosity agn at low redshifts and only high luminosity sources up to high redshifts , while deep pencil - beam surveys are useful to study the moderate luminosity population at high redshifts , but only provide a small number of the more rare , high - luminosity sources . combining",
    "the two covers the luminosity - redshift plane effectively ( see fig .  [ area ] ) .",
    "here we combine seven wide and deep surveys , for a total sample of 2341 agn selected in the hard x - ray band .",
    "( we define an agn as an x - ray source more luminous than @xmath14  ergs / s . )",
    "table 1 summarizes the surveys used in this work and their main characteristics .",
    "when necessary , hard x - ray fluxes in the 28  kev band were converted to the 210  kev range assuming a power - law spectrum of the form dn / de@xmath15e@xmath16 with @xmath17=1.7 , consistent with the average observed agn spectrum ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the total area of this super - sample as a function of x - ray flux is shown in fig .",
    "[ area ] .    to classify",
    "the sample by optical spectroscopy requires high spectroscopic completeness ; all the constituent surveys used here are at least 40% complete ( most are much higher ) and a total of 1229 sources ( 53% of our sample ) have reliable redshifts . these are spectroscopic redshifts except in the chandra deep field south , where the photometric classification by @xcite was used when spectroscopic information was not available ( i.e. , for about half the 227 objects ; the photometric redshifts include combo-17 data and so are quite accurate ) .",
    "sources were classified as unobscured agn when broad emission lines were present in the optical spectrum ( or using the optical / ir continuum shape for the cdf - s agn with photometry only ) ; the 631 sources ( 51% ) without broad emission lines and with x - ray luminosities greater than 10@xmath18  erg  s@xmath7 were classified as obscured agn .",
    "this is a more robust classification scheme than using x - ray - determined @xmath19 because there are no k correction effects , since lines are present in the optical spectrum at most redshifts ( line dilution by the host galaxy is not important ; @xcite .    for obvious reasons ,",
    "the spectroscopic completeness of any survey depends on the brightness of the optical counterparts . to describe this effect quantitatively , we characterize the identified fraction of each constituent survey by a simple 3-parameter function that is constant at bright magnitudes and declines linearly to faint magnitudes .",
    "these 3 independent parameters ( break and limiting magnitudes in the r band , and maximum completeness at bright fluxes ) provide a very good description of the identified fraction in all 7 surveys , with values for the reduced @xmath20 lower than 0.5 in each case .",
    "the fitted parameters for each survey are given in table 1 .",
    "the effective area as a function of x - ray flux and optical magnitude was then calculated by weighting the area versus x - ray flux relation for each survey by its sensitivity ( i.e. , the fraction of identified agn ) at each optical magnitude , and summing the results .",
    "the total effective area for the super - sample is shown in fig .",
    "[ area ] .    with the selection function of the super - sample",
    "quantified , we can now interpret the observed demographics of x - ray sources .",
    "the observed fraction of obscured agn as a function of redshift is shown ( data points ) in the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ red_ratio ] .",
    "this fraction remains almost constant at a value of @xmath100.6 - 0.7 up to @xmath0=1.5 and drops to @xmath100.2 - 0.3 at higher redshifts .",
    "a much steeper decline is expected because the measured redshifts require an optical spectrum . for obscured agn the optical emission",
    "is dominated by the host galaxy , which can be studied spectroscopically up to @xmath51 but then becomes too faint for even 8m - class telescopes , hence the decline at high redshift @xcite .    to account quantitatively for this selection effect",
    ", we calculate the ratio one should observe for an intrinsically non - evolving population , taking into account the effects of the sensitivity and completeness of each survey .",
    "this was done using the agn population synthesis model of @xcite as modified by @xcite .",
    "this model explains at the same time the x - ray , optical and infrared number counts of agn in the great observatories origins deep survey @xcite and the spectral shape and intensity of the extragalactic xrb @xcite . in practice ,",
    "most of the model parameters are irrelevant to the present calculation , as it depends mainly on the host galaxy luminosity and evolution .",
    "we assumed an @xmath21 luminosity and a sc - like evolution as given by @xcite .",
    "( we checked that the results do not depend significantly on the type of host - galaxy evolution assumed . )",
    "we also assume a local ratio of obscured to unobscured agn of @xmath103:1 , in agreement with observations ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and this ratio was assumed to decline with increasing luminosity but to remain constant with redshift .",
    "the expected fraction of obscured agn as a function of redshift for the observational parameters of our super - sample declines sharply above @xmath22 ( line , upper panel , fig .",
    "[ red_ratio ] ) , mainly because of spectroscopic incompleteness .",
    "the observed fraction of obscured agn at high redshift is higher than expected if the intrinsic fraction does not evolve . in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ red_ratio ] we show the obscured agn fraction relative to the expected value . clearly , it increases significantly with redshift , roughly as ( 1+@xmath0)@xmath23 , with @xmath2=0.3 - 0.5 ( thin dashed lines , bottom panel , fig .",
    "[ red_ratio ] ; best fit , @xmath2@xmath30.4 , thick dashed line ) .",
    "this value of @xmath2 does not change significantly if a different host galaxy evolution is assumed , and it is consistent with the value of 0.3 reported by @xcite .",
    "similar evolution was found by @xcite and @xcite , based on a much smaller sample , but we classify agn via optical spectroscopy rather than x - ray spectral fitting and so avoid their k - correction bias .",
    "the xrb also constrains the relative fraction of obscured agn and its evolution .",
    "the strongest constraints come from 110  kev , since at high energies the effects of obscuration are less important , and fortunately , the spectrum of the xrb in this energy range has been well measured .",
    "based on xmm observations , @xcite reported an integrated xrb flux in the 210  kev band of 2.24@xmath40.16@xmath2410@xmath25  erg  cm@xmath6  s@xmath7 . integrating our agn population synthesis model gives , for @xmath2=0 ( i.e. , a non - evolving obscured agn fraction ) , 2.3@xmath2410@xmath25  erg  cm@xmath6  s@xmath7 . incorporating the evolution with redshift , we obtain 2.1 , 2.04 , and 2.00 @xmath2410@xmath25  erg  cm@xmath6  s@xmath7 for @xmath2=0.3 , 0.4 , and 0.5 , respectively .",
    "( larger values of @xmath2 imply a lower integrated flux at low energies because of a higher relative fraction of obscured agn , in which most of the soft x - ray emission is absorbed . )    similarly , using @xmath27 observations , @xcite report an integrated flux value of 1.7@xmath40.2@xmath2410@xmath25  erg  cm@xmath6  s@xmath7 for the 28  kev band . in comparison , for @xmath2=0",
    "we find 1.8@xmath2410@xmath25  erg  cm@xmath6  s@xmath7 in the 28  kev band , and 1.7 , 1.6 , and @xmath2810@xmath25  erg  cm@xmath6  s@xmath7 for @xmath2=0.3 , 0.4 , and 0.5 , respectively .",
    "we conclude that the xrb favors @xmath2@xmath30.3 , in good agreement with the value found from the observed fraction .    since forming galaxies",
    "may be expected to have more dust , the increase in the relative fraction of obscured agn at high redshift may be due to an increase in the contribution to obscuration by galactic dust . combining hard x - ray and mid - infrared observations , @xcite found a similar ratio of hard x - ray to mid - infrared flux for obscured and unobscured agn , contrary to the predictions of the simplest agn unification paradigm , in which the obscuration comes from the dusty torus and therefore the mid - infrared emission is reduced due to self - absorption .",
    "this result can be explained if the obscuration comes from a much more extended region , i.e. , kiloparsec , galactic scales rather than a compact parsec - scale torus .",
    "furthermore , signatures for extended absorbing regions have been detected in nearby galaxies like ngc 1068 ( e.g. , @xcite ) and ngc 4151 @xcite .",
    "heavy absorption at kpc - scales has routinely been found in ultra - luminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) , which suffer a very strong evolution ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "hence , it seems likely that the change in the relative fraction of obscured agn could be related to galactic - scale absorption , in particular since some ulirgs also contain an obscured agn ( e.g. , arp 220 ; @xcite ) .",
    "the contribution of agn to the bolometric energy budget of the universe is a matter of debate .",
    "while it is now clear that agn are the major contributor in x - rays , they only constitute @xmath105 - 10% , depending on wavelength , of the total infrared emission ( e.g. , @xcite ) . here",
    "we calculate the total light from agn integrated across all wavelengths ; bolometric corrections to the 210  kev luminosity are derived from the agn spectral energy distributions of @xcite , as described by @xcite .",
    "this leads to luminosity - dependent corrections that range from @xmath1025 for low - luminosity agn to @xmath10100 for quasars , in good agreement with observations ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "integrating over the full agn population , the total bolometric light from agn is 3.8  nw  m@xmath6  sr@xmath7 .",
    "this value is independent of the obscured agn fraction , since we are calculating the total agn output , regardless of processes of absorption and re - emission at different wavelengths and depends only on the agn luminosity function .",
    "observations of the extragalactic background light integrated over all wavelengths yielded a value of 55@xmath420 nw  m@xmath6  sr@xmath7 @xcite , while @xcite found values in the range 45170  nw  m@xmath6  sr@xmath7 .",
    "hence , the contribution of agn to the total extragalactic light is at most @xmath108% .",
    "this contribution can be larger by @xmath102@xmath24 if a large number of compton - thick agn are missed by current x - ray surveys ; however , this is unlikely based on hard x - ray observations with integral and swift @xcite .    according to the soltan argument @xcite",
    ", agn luminosity traces the accretion of mass onto the central black hole .",
    "the conversion factor between the emitted luminosity and the accreted mass is the efficiency , @xmath29 . using our estimate of the integrated agn luminosity together with the observed local black hole mass density , @xmath30=4.6@xmath3110@xmath32  m@xmath33mpc@xmath34 @xcite",
    ", we find @xmath29=0.11@xmath35 .",
    "if instead we use the observed value of @xmath30=2.9@xmath40.46  @xmath2410@xmath32m@xmath33mpc@xmath34 reported by @xcite , we get @xmath29=0.17@xmath40.02 .",
    "the derived accretion efficiency is thus comparable to the typically assumed value , @xmath360.1 .    in summary , the fraction of obscured agn increases with redshift , following an evolution of the form ( 1+@xmath0)@xmath37 .",
    "this evolution could be related to an increase in the dust content of host galaxies at earlier epochs .",
    "the agn contribution to the total extragalactic light is small , @xmath388% . combining this estimate with the observed local black hole mass density",
