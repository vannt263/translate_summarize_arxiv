    "the galactic source first j102347.6 + 003841 was discovered by @xcite who initially classified it as a magnetic cataclysmic variable .",
    "subsequent studies @xcite concluded that this object is more likely a neutron star low - mass x - ray binary .",
    "its true nature was finally unveiled with the green bank telescope discovery of 1.69-ms radio pulsations ( archibald et al .",
    "2009 ) , establishing it as a compact binary containing a rotation - powered millisecond pulsar ( msp ) .",
    "the pulsar , psr j1023 + 0038 , is in a circular 4.8-hour binary orbit with an optically identified non - degenerate low - mass ( @xmath6@xmath7 m@xmath8 ) companion star @xcite .",
    "perhaps more importantly , it is the first radio msp binary to have exhibited past evidence for an accretion disk . in 2001 , double - peaked emission lines characteristic of accretion disks , accompanied by short - timescale flickering and a blue spectrum , were observed at optical wavelengths @xcite .",
    "there is no evidence that a disk is currently present in the system @xcite .",
    "a plausible interpretation of this behavior is a very recent transition from an accretion- to a rotation - powered neutron star .",
    "if this is indeed the case , psr j1023 + 0038 lends strong observational support for the long - suspected evolutionary connection between accreting msps in low - mass x - ray binaries ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) and rotation - powered `` recycled '' msps @xcite .    in its present `` quiescent '' state ,",
    "psr j1023 + 0038 exhibits radio eclipses at superior conjunction , when the secondary star is between the pulsar and observer , as well as short , random and irregular eclipses and dispersion measure variations at all orbital phases @xcite . based on the orbital parameters of the binary and an assumed @xmath9 m@xmath8 pulsar , for the implied orbital inclination of @xmath1046@xmath11 , the line - of - sight between the pulsar and the earth does not intersect the roche lobe of the companion at any point in the orbit @xcite .",
    "therefore , the eclipses must be caused by material driven off the surface of the secondary by the impinging pulsar wind .",
    "such eclipses and dispersion measure variations seen in similar msp binaries both in globular clusters ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* for the case of psr j17405340 in ngc 6397 ) and in the field of the galaxy ( see * ? ? ?",

    "@xcite for 15 ks , with all instruments in full imaging mode , and revisited in a target of opportunity observation for 34.5 ks , with the epic pn instrument configured in fast timing mode @xcite . the latter observation , in addition to detecting variability correlated with orbital phase , has revealed compelling evidence for x - ray pulsations at the pulsar s rotational period .",
    "the x - ray spectrum is relatively hard with power - law spectral photon index @xmath12 and luminosity @xmath13 ergs s@xmath2 ( 0.510 kev ) , plus a possible thermal component . the nature of the j1023 + 0038 system and the evidence for variability in the x - ray lightcurve favor interaction of the relativistic particle wind from the pulsar with matter from the close stellar companion as the source of the non - thermal radiation . the detection of x - ray pulsations by @xcite in the _ xmm - newton _",

    "extended x - ray emission has only been observed from two msps : the canonical `` black widow '' psr b1957 + 20 @xcite and the nearby isolated psr j21243358 ( hui & becker 2006 ) . as psr j1023 + 0038 moves through the ambient interstellar medium",
    ", it may also generate sufficient ram pressure to confine the pulsar wind , resulting in the formation of a bow shock , accompanied by a synchrotron - emitting `` cometary '' tail trailing behind the pulsar . given the strong possibility that psr j1023 + 0038 is a recently activated radio msp , it is important to search for an associated wind nebula .",
    "the spatial structure of any x - ray tail along the proper motion direction could , in principle , be employed as a `` timeline '' of the pulsar wind activity .",
    "this is possible because any accretion onto a radio pulsar would presumably extinguish the pulsar wind , which in turn would result in interruptions in the injection of the energetic wind into the interstellar medium .",
    "herein , we report on a _ chandra x - ray observatory _ advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis ) imaging spectroscopic observation of psr j1023 + 0038 .",

    ", the extracted source counts in the 0.38 kev range were grouped in energy bins so as to ensure at least 15 counts per bin .",
    "the background was taken from three source - free regions in the image around the pulsar .",
    "for the variability analysis , the photon arrival times were translated to the solar system barycenter using the ciao tool axbary assuming the de405 jpl solar system ephemeris and the pulsar position derived from radio timing @xcite .",
    "we note that the 3.2-s time resolution of the acis - s precludes the study of pulsations at the pulsar spin period .",
    "the study by @xcite uncovered large amplitude x - ray variability from j1023 + 0038 .",
    "however , due to the short exposure , it was not possible to establish whether the flux modulations were truly periodic .",
    "we have used the radio timing ephemeris of psr j1023 + 0038 @xcite to fold the barycentered _ chandra _ source photons at the binary period . as the observation covers over five binary orbits",
    ", we can definitively confirm that the x - ray flux is modulated at the binary period ( figures 1 and 2 ) .",
    "the variations are characterized by a factor of @xmath62 - 3 decline in the photon count rate at superior conjunction ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "a kuiper test @xcite on the folded , unbinned lightcurve , weighted to account for the non - uniform exposure across the orbit , indicates a @xmath23 ( 12.5@xmath0 ) probability that photons being drawn from a constant distribution would exhibit this level of non - uniformity .",
    "statistically , the individual lightcurves from the five binary orbits are consistent with having the same shape .",
    "there is no indication of statistically significant spectral variability throughout the orbit ( bottom panel of figure 2 ) . as discussed in  6 ,",

    "it is important to note , however , that the msp outflow most likely exhibits significant anisotropy , with the bulk of the wind emitted equatorially ( as seen in the crab pulsar ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "since the spin axis of the pulsar has likely aligned with the orbital angular momentum vector during the lmxb accretion phase @xcite , the wind of psr j1023 + 0038 should thus be preferentially emitted in the orbital plane . in the extreme case of a sheet - like wind confined entirely to the orbital plane",
    ", the secondary star would receive @xmath176 of the pulsar wind s power .",
    "based on this , we set @xmath177 .",
    "using the count rate maxima predicted by the model lightcurves shown in figure 8 , the intrinsic synchrotron luminosity of the shock in the absence of eclipses is estimated to be @xmath178 ergs s@xmath2 for particles with @xmath179 in a band @xmath180 kev centered on @xmath181 kev . with @xmath182 as deduced from the spectral fits , we obtain @xmath183 ( @xmath152 ) and @xmath184 ( @xmath154 ) . for @xmath152 , the derived @xmath166 for an isotropic wind exceeds unity and even in the highly anisotropic case is unrealistically high .",
    "the same applies if we consider a factor of @xmath185 larger emission region and stronger upstream magnetic field . since it is likely that @xmath186 ( e.g. , @xmath187 for the crab pulsar and nebula ) , the unphysical values of @xmath166 for @xmath152 suggest that at the distance of the shock , the wind of psr j1023 + 0038 is magnetically dominated ( @xmath154 ) .",
    "furthermore , for @xmath154 , a value of @xmath166 comparable to that of the crab pulsar requires significant anisotropy in the wind .",
    "it is interesting to highlight the apparent enhancement of emission at eclipse egress ( @xmath188 ) since it likely arises due to doppler beaming in the direction of the post - shock flow @xcite .",
    "similar , albeit much less statistically significant features have been seen in other eclipsing msp systems ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for psr j1023",
    "+ 0038 , the implied flow direction is opposite to the sense of motion of the secondary star in its orbit , indicating that the combined effects of the gravitational , pulsar wind pressure , and coriolis forces together with the outflow velocity relative to the orbital velocity , conspire to force the outflowing gas towards the trailing edge of the eclipse ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this effect can also account for the absence of a matching x - ray flux increase at ingress as it results in a weaker outflow towards the leading edge of the eclipse . within the available photon statistics ,",
    "the factor of @xmath189 increase in brightness at @xmath188 relative to the flux outside of eclipse ( @xmath190 ) is in agreement with the range @xmath191 predicted by @xcite based on the expected range of post - shock wind flow velocities ( @xmath192 ) .",
    "we have presented _ chandra _ acis - s observations of the psr j1023 + 0038 binary system .",
    "the data definitively confirm the x - ray flux variability at the binary orbital period .",
    "a simple geometrical model can account for the general shape of the x - ray lightcurve of the binary , indicating that the observed variability is primarily due to a partial geometric eclipse of the intrabinary shock by the secondary star .",
    "the model suggests that the shock is likely localized near l1 and/or is formed by the interaction of the pulsar wind and matter at the surface of the secondary star .",
    "the energetics of the shock emission favor a magnetically dominated ( @xmath154 ) pulsar wind at the shock front .",
    "this is not surprising , given that the shock occurs in a @xmath6@xmath193 times stronger magnetic field than in the case of the crab pulsar ( where the wind is dominated by kinetic energy ; see * ? ? ?",
    ". the x - ray data also favor a significantly anisotropic pulsar wind that is preferentially emitted in the orbital plane , which , in turn , requires close alignment of the pulsar spin and orbital angular momentum axes , as expected from binary evolution .",
    "combined with the study presented in @xcite , the spectral continuum suggests a dominant non - thermal component and the presence of a fainter thermal component that , at least in part , originates from the hot polar caps of the pulsar . in this sense , in terms of its x - ray properties , the pulsar itself appears to be similar to the majority of `` recycled '' msps detected in x - rays to date @xcite .",
    "a portion of the thermal x - ray emission may also come from an optically - thin thermal plasma , possibly the same plasma responsible for the radio eclipses .",
    "we find no evidence for a wind nebula associated with the pulsar .",
    "the shape , luminosity , and spectrum of a pwn depend on the angular distribution , magnetization and energy spectrum of the unshocked wind , as well as on the pulsar velocity and the properties of the ambient medium .",
    "therefore , the absence of a nebula down to a fairly deep limit of @xmath3@xmath134 ergs s@xmath2 , corresponding to @xmath3@xmath4 of the pulsar s @xmath104 , implies that the combination of low ambient density , moderate space velocity , and/or unfavorable wind geometry are insufficient to drive an x - ray - luminous bow shock .    owing to its proximity , psr j1023 +",
    "0038 is one of the best - suited targets for studies of these rare `` transition '' systems and thus warrants further x - ray observations , especially in combination with optical spectroscopy and @xmath17-ray variability study ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for the recent detection of this system with the _ fermi _ large area telescope ) .",
    "constraining the properties of the intrabinary shock in j1023 + 0038 and similar systems has important implications for understanding the x - ray properties of accreting msps in quiescence , such as the prototypical sax j1808.43658 @xcite .",
    "it has been suggested that the non - thermal x - ray radiation observed from certain quiescent low - mass x - ray binaries is also due to an active rotation - powered wind but this can not be directly confirmed due to the absence of radio pulsations @xcite .",
    "alternative scenarios such as on - going , low - level accretion ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) or a propeller regime ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) have also been proposed as explanations for the non - thermal emission .",
    "an x - ray spectroscopic and variability study analogous to that presented above could reveal the signature of an interacting rotation - powered pulsar wind in such systems , thereby providing further evidence for the evolutionary relation of lmxbs and msps .",
