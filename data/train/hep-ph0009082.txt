    "<S> if this is the case , all the methods which we mentioned above will extract the exactly same @xmath0 . * </S>",

    "<S> therefore , we will describe in more detail for this second case .    </S>",
    "<S> in fact , in models beyond the sm , the ckm matrix may not be unitary ; for instance , in a model with an extra down quark singlet ( or more than one ) , or an extra up quark singlet , or both up and down quark singlets , the ckm matrix is no longer unitary @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> if the unitarity constraint of the ckm matrix is removed , the generalized ckm matrix possesses 13 independent parameters ( after absorbing 5 phases to quark fields )  it consists of 9 real parameters and _ 4 independent phase angles_. the generalized ckm matrix can be parameterized as @xcite @xmath112 with the possibility of the non - unitary ckm matrix , one has to carefully examine the effects from the non - unitarity on the previously proposed methods where the unitarity of the ckm matrix was assumed to test the sm for cp violation . </S>",

    "<S> ( [ abcd ] ) is replaced by @xmath115 this leads to the result that the phase @xmath0 in the expressions for @xmath59 and @xmath60 in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ dd ] ) should be replaced by @xmath116 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , in this case , our method can measure the non - unitary phase @xmath117 .    in the ads method , </S>",
    "<S> besides @xmath53 is changed into the one in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ ci ] ) , the phase @xmath0 in @xmath51 is also replaced by @xmath118 . as a result , the new phase @xmath8 is automatically cancelled to disappear in the expressions for @xmath59 and @xmath60 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the ads method would still measure @xmath0 that _ is the phase of _ @xmath1 .    </S>",
    "<S> the glw method @xcite was suggested for extracting @xmath0 from measurements of the branching ratios of decays @xmath119 , @xmath120 and @xmath121 , where @xmath122 is a cp eigenstate . </S>",
    "<S> however , the glw method suffers from serious experimental difficulties , mainly because the process @xmath123 ( and its cp conjugate process @xmath124 ) is difficult to measure in experiment . </S>",
    "<S> that is , the rate for the ckm and color  suppressed process @xmath123 is suppressed by about two orders of magnitudes relative to that for the ckm and color  allowed process @xmath21 , and it causes experimental difficulties in identifying @xmath44 through @xmath125 since doubly cabibbo  suppressed @xmath126 following @xmath21 strongly interferes with @xmath127 following the rare process @xmath128 . with the non - unitary ckm matrix , this method would measure the angle @xmath129 ( see figure 1 ) , instead of @xmath0 as originally proposed in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite two groups , gronau and rosner ( gr ) , jang and ko ( jk ) , proposed a method to extract @xmath0 by exploiting cabibbo  allowed decays @xmath130 and using the isospin relations . in the gr / jk method , </S>",
    "<S> the decay modes @xmath131 with the quark process @xmath132 contain the ckm factor @xmath133 and their amplitudes can be written as @xmath134 where @xmath135 and @xmath136 denote the amplitude and the strong re - scattering phase for the isospin @xmath137 state . </S>",
    "<S> note that the weak phase angle @xmath118 appears in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ aaa ] ) rather than @xmath0 as in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . in this method , </S>",
    "<S> three triangles are drawn to extract @xmath138 , using the isospin relation @xmath139 and the following relations @xmath140 where @xmath141 is a cp eigenstate of @xmath142 meson , defined by @xmath143 . </S>",
    "<S> the appearance of @xmath144 in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ aaa ] ) results in extraction of @xmath145 , by this method , rather than @xmath138 as in the above reference , as shown in fig </S>",

    "<S> obviously , assuming that the glw method works , the method would extract @xmath145 rather than @xmath138 . </S>",
    "<S> we note that the impact on the glw method from the sizable @xmath77 mixing via new physics effects has been also investigated in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    in conclusion , </S>",
    "<S> we have presented a new method to determine @xmath152 in the ckm paradigm of the sm , using @xmath153 and @xmath154 decays , where @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath7 , _ etc . _ the experimental feasibility of our method , comparing with the ads method , has been studied . </S>",
    "<S> although experimentally challenging at present asymmetric @xmath9 factories of belle and babar , the analysis using our method can be carried out in details at hadronic @xmath9 experiments such as btev and lhc - b , where more than @xmath90 @xmath9 mesons will be produced per year .    with possibility of new phases in the ckm matrix , we have re - examined some of the previously proposed methods for determining the weak phase @xmath0 using @xmath155 or @xmath19 decays . </S>",
    "<S> we have shown that our method would extract @xmath156 with the new phase @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> the ads method would measure @xmath0 , while the glw method or the gr / jk method would measure @xmath118 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , if one uses the above methods independently and compares the results , it would be in principle possible to identify @xmath0 and @xmath8 separately . </S>",
    "<S> if this is the case and @xmath8 is not negligible , this would be a clear indication of the new phase in the ckm matrix , _ </S>",

    "<S> we note that , in fact , inconsistencies between the values of @xmath0 can arise from final state interactions ( fsis ) which are known to be important in @xmath111 decays and , consequently , may modify quark - level description of @xmath9 decays . </S>",
