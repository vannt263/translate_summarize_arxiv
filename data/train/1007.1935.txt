    "various experimental and theoretical studies in the recent past have indicated a clear demarkation of colliding matter into participant and spectator matter especially at high incident energies @xcite .",
    "this is characterized by the formation of hot & dense fireball .",
    "in addition , the size of the participant volume or ` source size ' is also linked with the emission of composite particles and ultimately with the mechanism of the production of entropy @xcite .",
    "the highly dense fireball formed for a very short duration ( @xmath2 ) can be of importance for probing the properties of condensed nuclear matter .",
    "the formation of the fireball is reported to be affected by many factors such as beam energy , overlapping volume , as well as density reached in a reaction .",
    "earlier experimental studies using the plastic ball / wall detector @xcite showed that the deuteron - to - proton yield ratio varies with the impact parameter of the reaction indicating a strong dependence on the participant volume .",
    "such behavior is believed to be resulted from the coalescence production mechanism @xcite .",
    "experimentally , the study of @xmath3 ratios obtained in asymmetric collisions of p+kr , o+kr , and ne+ar also indicates the importance of coalescence mechanism @xcite . in this study , it was observed that @xmath3 ratio increases with the beam energy .",
    "the baryonic entropy , however could nt be directly measured from these ratios , since total yield is required from the source .",
    "the measurement of the yield ratios and baryonic entropy produced are , therefore , very promising candidates for estimating the fireball produced in the hot & dense nuclear matter .    as a matter of fact",
    ", the pion production also contributes significantly @xcite towards the entropy generation at sps @xcite and higher energies . at sps energies ( @xmath4160 agev fixed target ) , the pion number increases with beam energy to about ten times the number of the nucleons @xcite .",
    "there , an increase in the entropy production was observed with beam energy as one moves from ags energies towards sps and higher energies @xcite .",
    "this enhancement may also be conjectured as manifestation of the change in the collision dynamics at such high energy @xcite . for the incident energy range considered ( 400 - 1050 amev ) in the present work , the inclusion of the pion production is not going to affect the entropy production appreciably @xcite .",
    "for instance , at sis energies ( upto 2 agev ) , the total number of pions is only 10 % of the nucleons @xcite .    in the present work",
    ", we aim to estimate the baryonic entropy @xmath5 generated in the fireball via the yields of free particles and light clusters ( _ i.e. _ protons , neutrons , deuteron , tritium , helium-3 , and @xmath6-particles ) .",
    "we made a systematic study of symmetric heavy - ion ( hi ) collisions in the incident energy range 400 - 1050 amev within dynamical model namely , _",
    "quantum molecular dynamics _ ( qmd ) model @xcite .",
    "we shall also compare our results with experimental data taken with plastic ball / wall detector .",
    "the dynamical approach such as qmd model provides an useful platform to estimate the yield of composite particles in terms of _ n - n _ correlations from the start when the colliding nuclei are well separated to the final state where matter is cold and fragmented . as reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , the production of light charged particles carries vital information about the stopping and equilibration of nuclear matter during a collision .",
    "the quantum molecular dynamics ( qmd ) model is a _",
    "n_-body transport theory that describes hi reactions in intermediate energy regime ( 20 mev / nucleon @xmath7 2 gev / nucleon ) on event by event basis .",
    "the two essential ingredients of the model are nucleon - nucleon ( _ n - n _ ) potential and stochastic scattering . here",
    "each nucleon follows the trajectory according to the classical equations of motion @xcite : @xmath8 the expectation value of the total hamiltonian @xmath9 consists of kinetic and potential energies terms as : @xmath10    the @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 in eq.([h ] ) are , respectively , the local skyrme , long range yukawa , an effective charge coulomb and momentum dependent parts of the interaction @xcite . the potential part without momentum dependent interactions ( mdi )",
    "is called static equation of state ( eos ) . for the present study ,",
    "we employ a soft equation of state represented by incompressibility @xmath15 and energy dependent _ n - n _ cross section @xcite .",
    "the equation of state with mdi is labeled as ` sm ' whereas without mdi , it is labeled as ` s ' . since many studies reveal the nuclear matter to be softer @xcite , we also prefer the soft eos .    the entropy information may be obtained from a classical charge symmetric _ gas _ of nucleons and deuterons in thermal and chemical equilibrium using the relation suggested by kapusta _",
    "@xcite : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the ratio of deuterons to protons established during early stages of the fireball .",
    "one source of error arises due to the neglect of other light composite particles _ viz . _",
    "t , @xmath18 and @xmath6 .",
    "bertsch and cugnon @xcite proposed to take into account these lighter fragments as well generalizing eq.([rd ] ) as : @xmath19 where @xmath20 as seen , quantity ` @xmath21 ' measures the yield ratio of deuteron - like ( @xmath22 ) to proton - like ( @xmath23 ) fragments .",
    "it has been well established from experiments that highest proton multiplicity accounts for most of the charges in hi system , thus leaving no room for heavier clusters .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite , we define the yield ratio of deuteron - like ( @xmath22 ) to proton - like ( @xmath23 ) clusters in the following way : @xmath24 where y(a ) stands for the number of fragments with mass ` a ' in one event .",
    "analogous to experimental results , we calculate the total participant multiplicity @xmath25 as : @xmath26,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath27 and @xmath28 define the total charge and mass of the colliding system .",
    "this procedure allows us to calculate the entropy produced in a reaction .",
    "we have calculated these ratios within qmd model for unfiltered events , employing _ minimum spanning tree _ ( mst ) procedure of clusterization @xcite . in this clusterization approach",
    ", we assume that two nucleons sharing the same cluster if their centroids are closer than a spatial radius @xmath29 .",
    "one generally choose the radius @xmath30 fm .",
    "it may be mentioned that some other sophisticated algorithms have also been developed which are based on relative momentum of nucleons @xcite , fragments binding energy minimization @xcite , and _ backtracing _ procedure @xcite to study the fireball and spectator matter physics .",
    "since it is well established that the production of light charged particles and clusters , and ultimately the entropy is related to the fireball , it is of interest to see their phase space . in fig . 1",
    ", we display the space ( x - z ) of @xmath31 collision at 650 amev and at a reduced impact parameter @xmath32=0.6 .",
    "the chosen time represents the freeze out time when density reaches asymptotic value .",
    "first of all , consistent with earlier attempts , we see that heavier fragments belong to the residue of either projectile or target , whereas lighter clusters like free nucleons and light charged particles lcps [ @xmath33 are produced due to the coalescence and emerge from the mid - rapidity region . as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , these light charged particles carry vital information about the stopping as well as thermalization of the nuclear matter , therefore , are also good candidates for the study of production of entropy in hi reactions . a very little influence can be seen of momentum dependent interactions .",
    "next we study the final state composite particle yield ratios x / p for the soft ( s ) and soft momentum dependent ( sm ) interactions .",
    "this is shown in fig . 2 for the collisions of @xmath31 at incident energy of 650 amev as a function of impact parameter .",
    "here ` x ' stands for a=2 , 3 and 4 clusters . on",
    "can see that curves for different x / p ratios exhibit similar trends : + ( i ) the x / p ratio decreases with impact parameter ( alternately , increases with @xmath34 ) indicating more production in central collisions compared to peripheral collisions . as shown by many authors",
    "@xcite , @xmath35 remains same for nearly central collisions and decrease sharply for semi - central collisions and peripheral collisions .",
    "+ ( ii ) for central impact parameters ( or , higher @xmath34 values ) , x / p ratios reach an asymptotic value indicating that for central events , small variation in impact parameter does not give different results .",
    "+ ( iii ) role of momentum dependent interactions is nearly marginal justifying the earlier attempts @xcite and use of soft equation of state .",
    "+ since entropy production is mostly measured for central collisions , the use of momentum dependent interactions will not give different results compared to static soft equation of state .",
    "these different yield ratios implied that one also obtains different behavior of density reached , collision rate and multiplicity of various light mass fragments for s and sm interactions .    in fig .",
    "3 , we extend the above study by including the ratio of deuteron - like ( @xmath22 ) to proton - like ( @xmath36 ) clusters .",
    "the calculations for @xmath0 are made using soft ( s ) equation of state for the collisions of @xmath37 ( at 400 and 1050 amev ) and @xmath31 ( at 400 and 650 amev ) as a function of participant proton multiplicity .",
    "the results of the plastic ball experiments @xcite are also displayed for comparison .",
    "the plastic ball data takes into account the overlap region for the yield of deuteronlike and protonlike clusters , while our ratios are calculated for the unfiltered events using mst procedure .",
    "the yield ratios are calculated typically after 40 fm / c , when average nucleonic density saturates and _",
    "n - n _ collisions practically cease . at this time , yields of composite particles is well established and may be compared with experimental data .",
    "one clearly sees that our model describes well the functional form of experimental @xmath0 ratio which is found to increase with @xmath34 ( or centrality of the collision ) and saturates at higher multiplicity end . at low @xmath34",
    ", there is a large drop in the yield ratio for model calculations as also found for individual cluster - to - proton ( x / p ) ratios ( see fig.2 ) .",
    "these trends are closely related with nuclear matter stopping and flow effect in the formation of hot and dense fireball .",
    "recently , dhawan _ et al . _",
    "@xcite studied impact parameter dependence of light charged particles ( lcps ) yield and anisotropy ratio .",
    "it was found that lcps production was maximum at central collisions where maximum stopping of nuclear matter is also achieved .",
    "thus , production of light clusters can act an indicator of global stopping achieved in the nuclear matter .",
    "interestingly , @xmath0 ratio calculated using dynamical approach is in good agreement with experimental data .",
    "this shows that one can reliably explore the applicability of dynamical approach such as qmd model to further investigate the formation of fireball at intermediate energies .",
    "it should be emphasized that model of kapusta @xcite is highly idealized one that relies on the assumption of thermal and chemical equilibrium in the system , for extraction of @xmath5 using eqs .",
    "( [ rd ] ) and ( [ rdp ] ) .",
    "the heavy - ion collisions at higher incident energies evolve from an initial non - equilibrium momentum distribution to a thermalized distribution . in a heavy - ion system ,",
    "full equilibrium is not , however , always possible even at central geometry @xcite . at large impact parameters ,",
    "the momentum distribution of nucleons further deviates from the degree of full equilibrium @xcite .",
    "it is worthwhile to study the equilibration of the nuclear matter produced at the time of fireball formation and role of secondary de - excitation of heavier clusters on proton - like and deuteron - like abundances during the expansion stage .",
    "the anisotropy ratio , which is also a measure of the degree of equilibration reached in a heavy - ion reaction , is defined as @xcite : @xmath38 the full equilibrium corresponds to @xmath39 value close to unity . in fig .",
    "4(a ) , we plot the time evolution of anisotropy ratio @xmath40 for the reactions of nb+nb at incident energies of 400 and 650 amev , respectively .",
    "the shaded area corresponds to the time zone for highly excited nuclear matter which is followed by the decompression phase . beyond this region , the nucleon density saturates and hard _",
    "n - n _ collisions cease almost .",
    "one can see that @xmath39 values approach close to asymptotic value just after the compression ( t@xmath4 40 - 45 fm / c ) irrespective of the incident energy chosen .",
    "the @xmath39 values at both incident energies are still less than 1 .",
    "it clearly shows that the hi system has still not achieved full equilibrium at the expansion stage of the collision .",
    "it also indicates that _",
    "n - n _ collisions occurring at later times do nt alter the momentum space of nucleons significantly . in the lower panels ( b)-(c ) , we display the yields of @xmath23 and @xmath22 clusters .",
    "one can see that in low - density phase , the secondary emission from heavier clusters tend to populate the abundances of deuteron - like and proton - like clusters slightly .",
    "since full thermodynamical equilibrium is not visible for the participant zone , we shall estimate _ apparent _ entropy ` @xmath41 ' produced in the hi reactions using eq.([rdp ] ) .",
    "we display in fig .",
    "5 , the apparent entropy @xmath41 as a function of participant proton multiplicity @xmath35 for the reactions of @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 at incident energies of 400 and 650 amev .",
    "one can clearly see that at a given beam energy , it is the volume of participant nucleons ( that is , @xmath35 ) which governs the apparent entropy produced rather than the total number of nucleons in the phase space .",
    "this clearly brings out the participant - spectator picture of hi collisions at relativistic beam energies .",
    "it depicts that participant volume is solely contributing towards deuteronlike and protonlike cluster abundances independent of the target - projectile combination .",
    "these results are in agreement with the experimental data and theoretical approaches .",
    "it may be mentioned that apparent entropy of the fireball would approach realistic baryonic entropy using eq.([rdp ] ) only when full thermodynamical equilibrium is achieved for the participant zone .",
    "finally we display in fig .",
    "6 , the apparent entropy ` @xmath41 ' extracted for the central collisions of @xmath42 ( at 400 and 1050 amev ) and @xmath43 ( at 400 and 650 amev ) . also shown here is the baryonic entropy obtained in plastic ball experiment @xcite using the model of kapusta .",
    "our model entropy values are in close agreement with experimental observations @xcite .",
    "nearly no effect of beam energy is visible in experimental as well as in model entropies .",
    "in this paper , we have modeled the dynamical emission of light clusters in highly excited nuclear matter and estimated specific entropy based upon the formalism proposed by kapusta _",
    "et al_. our model calculations are done within the framework of _ quantum molecular dynamics _ ( qmd ) model for unfiltered events . the comparison of model calculations of yield ratios as a function of participant proton multiplicity @xmath35 with experimental data gives quite encouraging results . from these results",
    ", we conclude that it is the volume of participants in a reaction system that governs deuteronlike and protonlike cluster abundances in early interaction stage .",
    "the time evolution of momentum anisotropy ratio shows that full thermodynamical equilibrium is nt , however , achieved even at later expansion stage of the heavy - ion collisions .",
    "our model calculations for _ apparent _ entropy produced in the central collisions of ca+ca and nb+nb indicate close agreement with experimental results based upon kapusta s formalism .",
