    "the popularity of ieee 802.11 or wireless fidelity ( wi - fi ) networks among users as an affordable data access network is increasing tremendously , and consequently , causing an increase in the number of access points ( aps ) deployed in places like residential / apartment buildings , hotels , airports , campuses and enterprise buildings .",
    "the unprecedented demand for affordable high data rate and the emergence of bandwidth intensive applications is also a contributing factor .",
    "similarly , the emerging cellular - wifi offloading trend requires a high density of aps to handle the huge mobile data traffic @xcite . with this promising solution to explosive mobile data traffic",
    "comes increased inter - ap interference , which degrades the capacity of dense wireless local area networks ( dwlans ) .",
    "although densification of aps provides extended coverage and affordable data access in homes , offices and campuses , deploying large numbers of aps over a confined network area increases the interference domain of each ap and causes severe interference to neighboring aps .",
    "this becomes worrisome in cases where ap cells overlap leading to overlapped basic service sets ( obss ) where inter - bss or inter - ap interference becomes significant @xcite ; a bss consists of an ap and its associated stations ( stas ) .",
    "in addition to increasing ap s interference domain , uncoordinated distribution of stas among aps causes overwhelming channel access contention at overloaded cells due to the carrier sense multiple access collision avoidance ( csma / ca ) protocol specified in the ieee 802.11 standard for channel acquisition .",
    "interference , data collisions and congestion are major concerns in dwlan .",
    "one technique to improve system performance in the presence of multiple interference sources is to coordinate ap selection based on key performance metrics such as sinr and packet error rate ( per ) .",
    "currently , the ap selection process in wlan is based on the strongest received signal strength ( rss ) or strongest signal first ( ssf ) , a method whereby an sta selects ap that offers strongest rss without considering interference , congestion and load at the candidate ap .",
    "this legacy ap selection scheme defined in the 802.11 standard might cause a high degree of contention in some bsss , and consequently degrades aggregate network performance .",
    "studies @xcite - @xcite focus on proposing new schemes for ap selection in 802.11 networks and demonstrate the inability of an rss - based scheme to guarantee a level system performance .",
    "in @xcite and @xcite , authors focus primarily on achieving a fair distribution of stas among aps to achieve load balancing as opposed to the ssf ap selection scheme that has the tendency to cause load imbalances among aps @xcite . the probe delay ( pd ) and mean probe delay ( mpd ) algorithms@xcite select the ap with minimum probe delay .",
    "similarly , an ap association control scheme is proposed in @xcite to achieve proportional fairness .",
    "a graph matching approach to coordinate ap association and maximize uplink throughput is proposed in @xcite , where the links between stas and aps are modeled as graph edges with uplink sinrs as edge weights . in @xcite",
    ", virtualizing wireless network interfaces enables stas to associate with multiple aps and switch between aps without severe overhead thereby making the ap selection dynamic .    in @xcite , by introducing a quality of service ( qos ) differentiated information element ( ie ) in frames advertised by aps , stas are aware of the _ call blocking _ probability when selecting an ap . by measuring channel utilization , the authors in @xcite proposed an ap selection scheme that allows stas to select ap with minimum hidden terminal effect . similarly , using a channel measurement approach , the authors in @xcite suggest that the hidden terminal problem and frame aggregation are factors in selecting an ap that guarantees better throughput .",
    "another measurement - based ap selection approach is presented in @xcite using a supervised learning technique ( multi - layer feed - forward neural network ) with multiple inputs , which allows stas to select the ap that offers best performance .",
    "thus far , inter - bss interference at the target ap has not been considered when selecting ap .",
    "the proposed ap selection scheme exploits awareness of inter - ap interference by allowing stas to estimate the received sinrs from a set of candidate aps and select an ap with the best sinr .",
    "the goal is to improve system performance by associating stas with aps that offer best sinr .",
    "enhancing performance in the presence of inter - ap interference is important in dwlans for two reasons .",
    "first , the problem of obss is inevitable in large - scale dense ap deployments , leading to severe inter - ap interference , which degrades performance due to close proximity of co - channel aps .",
    "second , the majority of the traffic is in the downlink .",
    "taking video streaming as an example , after a user requests the service in the ul , the entire video streaming session occurs in the downlink .",
    "the remaining parts of this paper are organized as follows .",
    "first , we present the system and network model in section  [ sysmodel ] .",
    "the proposed scheme is presented in sections  [ dlassoc ] and [ opasa ] while simulation results are presented in section  [ eval ] .",

    "[ eval ]    this section presents the simulation methodology , scenario and results . for performance benchmarking",
    ", opasa mainly serves as an optimal benchmark while dasa ( algorithm  [ dlassocal ] ) is compared with the ssf scheme in 802.11 standards and the state - of - the - art _ mean probe delay _ ( mpd ) ap selection algorithm in @xcite .",
    "[ simset ]    to simulate the channel access coordination at the mac layer in a wifi network , we have implemented the distribution coordination function ( dcf ) with a slot - time of @xmath0 , short inter - frame space ( sifs ) @xmath1 , difs = @xmath2 and a cca time of @xmath3 in matlab .",
    "the simulated network emulates a random ap deployment where aps and stas are deployed on an area of @xmath4 .",
    "this network consists of 400 stas and 50 aps deployed on three non - overlapping channels of ieee 802.11b phy on a 2.4ghz band .",
    "all aps have identical coverage areas of @xmath5 radius and transmit with a uniform power of @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "table  [ table : simpara ] summarizes other key parameters and the received power at sta@xmath8 from ap@xmath9 is measured using @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the channel gain characterized by an exponential distribution i.e. @xmath12 to account for fading and shadowing effects , and @xmath13 is used as the path loss exponent .",
    "the minimum receiver sensitivity is set as @xmath14 .    for carrier",
    "sensing , the pcs is enabled with minimum and maximum contention window ( cw ) sizes 32 and 1024 , respectively , while request to send ( rts)/clear to send ( cts ) frames are used to minimize the effect of the _ hidden terminal problem _ - a node does not transmit immediately after sensing the channel to be idle under pcs . rather , it transmits the rts frame and begins transmission of payload when the cts frame is received . to emulate the asymmetric traffic requests in wi - fi networks , aps and stas transmit packets of varying sizes ( between 1400 to 1500 bytes ) with a mean packet size of 1460 bytes while the mac header , cts / rts frame and ack frame sizes are 34 , 14/20 and 14 bytes respectively as defined in the 802.11 standard",
    "it is assumed that the ` p_res ` and ` p_req ` frames have same size as the rts .",
    "packets arrive at each node s buffer at an exponential rate with parameter @xmath15 .",

    "the probe delay is measured for the same duration and the ap with minimum probe delay is selected . from figure",
    "[ fig : res1 ] , as expected , we infer that under any network size , dasa improves aggregate throughput . for instance , when the number of contending stas is 300 , dasa achieved @xmath18 ( 43.22 to 61.84 @xmath19 ) and @xmath20 ( 31.02 to 61.84 @xmath19 ) throughput gains over mpd and ssf , respectively . with increasing network size",

    ", dasa obtains higher throughput closer to the optimal opasa than mpd and ssf . observing the 40@xmath25 percentile , the performance of mpd over ssf fluctuates while dasa achieves nearly @xmath26 gain over both ssf and mpd . at the @xmath27 of the same figure  [ fig : res2 ] , dasa maintains @xmath28 gain over ssf while achieving 96.6% gain over mpd . between the @xmath29 and @xmath30 percentile throughputs under mpd and dasa schemes",
    "converge .",
    "figure  [ fig : res3 ] illustrates end - to - end throughput of each of the 400 ap - to - sta links versus frame size .",
    "the first observation in figure  [ fig : res3 ] is that as the frame size becomes larger , the throughputs achieved under mpd and dasa converge .",
    "this is likely due to the fact that delay becomes a factor in transmitting more bits and since mpd chooses links with less delay , more bits are likely to traverse the links at the same rate in dasa .",
    "although , both mpd and dasa significantly outperform ssf , opasa doubles the throughputs over dasa , ssf and mpd for frame sizes below and above 1485 bytes .",
    "stas versus frame size.,width=480 ]    figure  [ fig : res4 ] depicts the mean frame delay versus network size . here , frame delay is the cumulative time from when a packet arrives at an ap s buffer and the ap contends for a channel , to successful reception of packet at the sta . for a small network size of 50 stas",
    ", the delay is below @xmath31 for ssf , mpd , opasa and dasa while for larger network size of 400 users , the mean delay is higher in ssf . for 400 stas under the ssf scheme , the average frame delay is nearly @xmath32 while dasa and mpd maintain delays of @xmath33 and @xmath34 , respectively . for lower network sizes ( 50 to 150 stas ) , opasa , mpd and dasa",
    "achieve nearly same performance in terms of delay , the slight superiority of mpd over opasa and dasa becomes obvious when the network size increases from 200 to 400 stas .",
    "this discrepancy is as a result of increased contentions among aps frequently trying to serve more stas in the dl .",
    "the problem of inter - bss interference is inevitable in dense 802.11 networks and degrades performance .",
    "in fact , selecting an ap with strongest rss does not always guarantee highest throughput due to interference at the target ap .",
    "we have shown that selecting ap based on sinr reduces the effect of interference among basic service sets ( bss ) .",
    "this paper presents a new scheme for ap - sta association that takes the ap interference into account .",
    "the opasa algorithm serves as the optimal throughput benchmark while the much simpler proposed dasa algorithm provides significant gain in aggregate throughput while taking ap interference into account .",
    "simulation results reveal that selecting the ap offering best sinr improves throughput . through extensive simulation ,",
    "the dasa algorithm is compared to the default ssf scheme used in current 802.11 standards and the mpd algorithm proposed previously ; significant throughput gain over both the ssf and the mpd schemes is observed .",
