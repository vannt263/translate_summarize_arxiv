    "showing the hook lengths of each box . ]      recall that the _ hook length _ of a box in the young diagram of a partition is the number of boxes to the right ( the arm ) plus the number of boxes below it ( the leg ) plus one ( the head ) .",
    "( we use the english convention for young diagrams ; see figure [ fig : young ] . )",
    "a partition is an @xmath6-_core _ if its young diagram avoids hook length @xmath6 and an @xmath5-_core _ if it avoids hook lengths @xmath6 and @xmath7 [ ahj ] .",
    "for example , the partition @xmath8 in figure 1 is a @xmath9-core but not a @xmath10-core .",
    "the number of @xmath5-core partitions is finite iff @xmath6 and @xmath7 are coprime , which we shall assume from now on [ ahj ] .",
    "let @xmath11 be the random variable  size of an @xmath5-core partition , \" where the sample space is the set of all @xmath5-core partitions , equipped with the uniform distribution . in [ ez ] , with the help of maple",
    ", zeilberger derived explicit expressions ( as polynomials in @xmath6 and @xmath7 ) for the expectation , variance , and numerous higher moments of @xmath11 .",
    "the original paper noted that  from the ` religious - fanatical ' viewpoint of the current ` mainstream ' mathematician , they are ` just ' conjectures , but nevertheless , they are * absolutely certain * ( well , at least as absolutely certain as most proved theorems ) , \" and a donation to the oeis was offered for the theory to make the results rigorous .",
    "later , it was found that such theory did exist and the results are entirely rigorous ; see the updates at the paper s site .",
    "zeilberger also computed some standardized central moments of @xmath11 and the limit of these expressions as @xmath12 with @xmath13 fixed . from this",
    "he conjectured the limiting distribution .",
    "perhaps surprisingly , it is abnormal .",
    "things are not as easy if look at the random variable `` size of an @xmath5-core partition _ with distinct parts_. '' in this case , there does not seem to be one nice formula for the moments in terms of @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "however , we can consider certain indexed families of core partitions and look for explicit formulas for the moments .",
    "for example , in [ s ] , straub remarks in a lemma that a partition with distinct parts is an @xmath0-core iff it has perimeter ( largest hook length ) less than @xmath4 . using this , it is easy to show that the number of such partitions is the fibonacci number .",
    "further , in [ z ] , we used straub s lemma and some experimentation with maple to derive explicit expressions for the moments , as rational functions of fibonacci numbers .",
    "our results give strong evidence that the limiting distribution as @xmath14 _ is _ normal in this case .",
    "unfortunately , we do not see how to generalize the characterization above to other indexed families of partitions .",
    "however , we do have another characterization of @xmath5-core partitions due to anderson [ a ] .",
    "given coprime @xmath6 and @xmath7 , define the poset @xmath15 where @xmath16 , and the partial - order relation @xmath17 holds whenever @xmath18 can be expressed as @xmath19 for some @xmath20 .",
    "( it can be shown that @xmath21 is finite with largest element @xmath22 . )",
    "anderson defined a bijection between @xmath5-core partitions and _ order ideals _ of @xmath21 .",
    "( under our convention , a subset @xmath23 of a poset @xmath24 is an order ideal iff @xmath25 @xmath26 @xmath27 . )",
    "further , the hook lengths of the boxes in the leftmost column in the partition s young diagram correspond to the labels of the order ideal .",
    "now , a partition has distinct parts iff there are no consecutive hook lengths in the leftmost column .",
    "thus :    * _ @xmath5-core partitions with distinct parts are bijective to order ideals of @xmath21 with no consecutive labels .",
    "_      so , given a family of core partitions , we have a corresponding sequence of posets which we can hopefully understand . in [ zz ]",
    ", we plotted some of the posets corresponding to @xmath1-core partitions with distinct parts and were able to see recursive structure .",
    "this led to recursions for the generating functions of the partitions .",
    "we were again able to derive explicit expressions for the moments in terms of @xmath4 and show that the distribution of size is not asymptotically normal as @xmath14 .",
    "in [ s ] , straub generalizes the problem in section 1.2 by considering @xmath2-core partitions with distinct parts , where @xmath4 and @xmath3 are natural numbers .",
    "he proves in theorem 4.1 that the number of such partitions , call it @xmath28 , satisfies a generalized fibonacci recurrence : @xmath29 of course , this reduces to the plain vanilla fibonacci numbers when @xmath30 .",
    "note that we can view @xmath28 as a sequence of polynomials in @xmath3 .    here , we shall use the poset characterization in section 1.3 to easily recover straub s result and discover new conjectures about the distribution of the sizes of the partitions .      by section @xmath31 , we know that @xmath2-core partitions with distinct parts are bijective with order ideals of @xmath32 containing no consecutive labels .",
    "we can use the procedure ` pw ` in the maple package ` armin ` accompanying [ zz ] to plot @xmath32 for various @xmath4 and @xmath3 .    .",
    "]    for example , figure [ fig : pw ] depicts the poset @xmath33 , i.e. , the @xmath34 case .",
    "( when plotting @xmath21 , we use the convention to increment @xmath6 in the @xmath35 direction and @xmath7 in the @xmath36 direction .",
    "thus , the largest label , @xmath22 , is in the lower left corner . )",
    "it is easy to show that this general trapezoidal shape persists for arbitrary values of @xmath4 and @xmath3 .",
    "we can also see @xmath32 as a colonnade of @xmath37 vertical pillars with heights @xmath38 .",
    "further , the tops of the pillars have labels @xmath39 .      next",
    ", we recover the recursion by enumerating the order ideals of @xmath32 with no consecutive labels .    referring to the @xmath34 example ,",
    "let @xmath23 be an order ideal of @xmath33 .",
    "let @xmath40 be the part of @xmath23 contained in the @xmath41th pillar .    * if @xmath42 , then @xmath23 is isomorphic to an order ideal of @xmath43 . *",
    "otherwise , let @xmath44 be the largest member of @xmath45",
    ". then @xmath46 . for if @xmath47 , then @xmath48 , contradicting the assumption that @xmath23 contains no consecutive labels",
    "so there are @xmath49 choices for @xmath45 .",
    "further , @xmath50 must be empty ; otherwise , again , we have @xmath51",
    ". thus the remainder of @xmath23 is isomorphic to an order ideal of @xmath52 .    to summarize , if @xmath23 is an order ideal of @xmath32 with no consecutive labels , then either @xmath23 is isomorphic to an order ideal of @xmath53 , or @xmath45 has @xmath3 options and the rest of @xmath23 is isomorphic to an order ideal of @xmath54 .",
    "this proves .    from the above observation",
    ", we have the following characterization :    * any order ideal of @xmath32 with no consecutive labels is of the form @xmath55 , where * * each @xmath40 is either empty or of the form @xmath56 , where @xmath57 if @xmath58 , and @xmath59 .",
    "* * if @xmath40 is nonempty , then @xmath60 is empty .    in short :",
    "to make an order ideal , we hang strings of beads from the tops of the pillars in such a way the strings are not too long and adjacent pillars are not both decorated .",
    "our ultimate goal is investigate the distribution of the size of @xmath2-core partitions with distinct parts .",
    "to this end , we define the generating function @xmath61 where @xmath62 ranges over @xmath2-core partitions with distinct parts , and @xmath63 denotes the size of the partition @xmath62 , i.e. , the sum of its parts",
    ". we shall give an efficient scheme for computing @xmath64 for fixed @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "proceeding as in [ zz ] , we first compute the auxiliary generating function @xmath65 where @xmath23 ranges over all order ideals of @xmath32 with no consecutive labels ; @xmath66 is the sum of the labels in @xmath23 ; and @xmath67 is the number of labels in @xmath23 . then , as explained in [ zz ] , we can obtain @xmath68 by replacing occurrences of @xmath69 in @xmath70 with @xmath71 .    to compute @xmath70",
    ", we use the reasoning of the previous section , but this time we keep track of the weight of the order ideal .",
    "first , we introduce yet another auxiliary generating function . for @xmath72 , let @xmath73 be the sub - poset of @xmath32 obtained by chopping off everything to the left of the @xmath41th column ( note @xmath74 ) . define @xmath75 as in , except @xmath23 ranges over order ideals of @xmath73 with no consecutive labels ( note @xmath76 ) .    by the reasoning of the previous section ,",
    "the first column of an order ideal of @xmath73 is either empty or of the form @xmath77 , where @xmath78 ) .",
    "since the latter set has weight @xmath79 we have the recursion @xmath80    note that this is a recursion in the auxiliary index @xmath41 , not in @xmath4 and @xmath3 .",
    "given @xmath4 and @xmath3 , we can use to find @xmath76 .",
    "finally , we make the substitution @xmath81 to find @xmath64 .",
    "all of this is done in the procedure ` gdn ` in the maple package .",
    "given fixed @xmath4 and @xmath3 , we can pick a uniform random @xmath2-core partition with distinct parts , and consider its its size , call it @xmath82 .",
    "then @xmath83 is a random variable , so it makes sense to inquire about its distribution .",
    "since @xmath84 is the generating function for @xmath83 , we can easily compute as many moments of the distribution as we please , for fixed @xmath4 and @xmath3 .    using this information",
    ", we can investigate how the moments behave as functions of @xmath4 and @xmath3 .",
    "we consider two cases : @xmath4 is variable and @xmath3 is fixed , and vice versa . in each case , we consider the behavior of @xmath83 as the variable tends to infinity ; in particular , we address the question of asymptotic normality .",
    "finally , we derive formulas for the first few moments as functions of _ both _ @xmath4 and @xmath3 .      first , we introduce some terminology . given a natural number @xmath41 ,",
    "let us denote @xmath85_{q=1}\\ ] ] the @xmath41th `` pre - moment '' of @xmath83 .",
    "thus , @xmath86\\ ] ] is the @xmath41th ( straight ) moment of @xmath83 .",
    "for example , the mean is @xmath87 .",
    "we denote the @xmath41th _ central moment _ by @xmath88.\\ ] ] for example , the variance is @xmath89 .    finally , the @xmath41th _ standardized moment _ is @xmath90 note that the central , straight , and standardized moments can easily be computed from the pre - moments .",
    "now , for numeric values of @xmath3 and @xmath4 , we can easily compute all the quantities above . analyzing moment data for many values of @xmath3 and @xmath4",
    "confirms the following :    for each @xmath4 , the @xmath41th pre - moment @xmath91 of @xmath83 is a polynomial in @xmath3 .",
    "further , the degree of this polynomial is @xmath92 .",
    "for example , our experimental evidence indicates that    @xmath93    recall that the standard normal distribution has moments @xmath94 .",
    "the sequences above seem to approach this as @xmath14 , leading us to the following :    for each fixed @xmath4 , the distribution of @xmath83 is _ not _ asymptotically normal ; in fact , @xmath95 tends to some abnormal distribution @xmath96 as @xmath97 .",
    "however , @xmath96 _ is _ asymptotically normal ; that is , @xmath98 tends to the standard normal distribution as @xmath14 .",
    "next , we fix @xmath3 , and look at @xmath83 as a sequence of random variables indexed by @xmath4 . the @xmath30 case was already addressed in [ zz ] , where we found that the pre - moments are given by polynomials in @xmath4 and the fibonacci numbers . in light of",
    ", we might expect the same to be true for arbitrary @xmath3 , except we use the generalized fibonacci numbers , @xmath28 :    for each @xmath3 , the @xmath41th pre - moment @xmath91 of @xmath83 is of the form @xmath99 , where @xmath100 and @xmath101 are polynomials in @xmath4 .",
    "again , experimental evidence verifies this claim .",
    "the one anomalous case seems to be @xmath102 , for which @xmath103 . in this case ,",
    "our methods do not yield nice formulas for the moments .    upon computing the limits standardized moments , we do get the familiar sequence @xmath94 in this case , leading to the following :    for fixed @xmath3 , the distribution of @xmath83 is asymptotically normal .",
    "that is , @xmath95 approaches the standard normal distribution as @xmath104 .      finally , it is possible ( but computationally taxing ) to obtain a single formula for the @xmath41th moment as a function of _ both _ @xmath41 and @xmath3 . in the previous section ,",
    "we _ fixed _",
    "@xmath3 and @xmath41 , we and used ` guessrecpol ` to fit the sequence @xmath105 to the ansatz @xmath99 , where @xmath106 and @xmath107 are polynomials .",
    "however , using the methods section 3.1 , we can fix _ only _ @xmath41 and look at @xmath105 as a sequence of polynomials in @xmath3 .",
    "further , due to maple s ability to handle linear systems with symbolic coefficients , ` guessrecpol ` can still be applied to this sequence . of course ,",
    "now @xmath106 and @xmath107 will be polynomials in @xmath4 whose coefficients are rational functions in @xmath3 :    the @xmath41th pre - moment @xmath91 of @xmath83 is of the form @xmath108 , where @xmath109 and @xmath110 are degree @xmath111 polynomials in @xmath4 whose coefficients are rational functions in @xmath3 .    due to the amount of data needed to fit the @xmath41th moment to the ansatz , it takes a few minutes even to generate the formula for the 3rd moment .      here",
    ", we present a small taste of the conjectures yielded by our maple package . in the first two conjectures to follow , we could easily have presented formulas for many more moments , but we omit them to save space .",
    "see the next section for instructions to replicate these results and many more for yourself .    in general , we conjectured that @xmath112 is a rational function in @xmath3 for @xmath4 fixed .",
    "however , for @xmath113 the straight moments seem to be polynomials :    the expectation of @xmath114 is @xmath115 , and the variance is @xmath116 .",
    "here is an example where we fix @xmath3 .",
    "the expectation of @xmath117 is @xmath118    finally , here is the expectation once and for all , in terms of both @xmath4 and @xmath3 :    the expectation of @xmath83 is @xmath119    note that this formula is singular at @xmath102 , explaining anomaly mentioned earlier .",
    "however , we can still make sense of the @xmath102 case by first plugging in a numeric value of @xmath4 , ( so that the @xmath120 s become polynomials in @xmath3 ) , then taking the limit as @xmath121 .",
    "so this formula effectively works for _ all _ @xmath4 and @xmath3 .",
