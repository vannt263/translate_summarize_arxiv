    "in recent years , the number of known white dwarfs ( wds ) has grown significantly .",
    "optical spectroscopy shows that most of these objects are hydrogen - atmosphere wds with a mass distribution that peaks at @xmath5 @xcite . among the new wds , there are also a handful of extremely low mass ( elm ) wds with @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "elm wds are rare , comprising @xmath70.2% of spectroscopically confirmed wds .",
    "more importantly , single star evolution can not produce such low mass wds in the age of the galaxy .",
    "thus , these wds yield interesting tests of stellar evolution theory .",
    "elm wds must undergo significant mass loss during their formation .",
    "in one scenario , they form in close binaries whose evolution includes a phase of mass transfer , during which much of the wd progenitor s envelope is removed .",
    "this prevents a helium flash in the progenitor s core and results in the observed low - mass , helium - core wd ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "existing observations of elm wds do not detect the photometric excess or the spectroscopic signature expected from main sequence companions .",
    "hence , the binary companions of known elm wds are probably either wds or neutron stars .",
    "this result is consistent with spectroscopic studies of large samples of hydrogen - atmosphere wds , which conclude that in the majority of cases low - mass wds are likely to have degenerate companions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "elm wds are also frequent companions to millisecond pulsars , although in these radio - selected systems the wds are frequently too faint for optical spectroscopy to confirm that they are indeed wds ( cf .",

    "@xcite estimate that the binary fraction for wds with @xmath8 is @xmath9 .",
    "they also predict that the binary fraction rises to @xmath10 for wds with @xmath11 , since such extreme mass loss rates are not expected even for the most metal - rich stars in the galaxy .",
    "spectroscopic radial velocity studies of the newly discovered low - mass wds are therefore essential if we are to discriminate between these mass loss scenarios by measuring the binary fraction of low - mass wds and/or to characterize the currently unseen companions .    a radial velocity study of sdss j091709.55 + 463821.8 ( hereafter sdss j0917 + 46 ) , the lowest gravity wd currently known , revealed velocity variations with an orbital period of 7.6 hr .",

    "all spectra were obtained with a 1.0@xmath14 slit yielding a resolving power of @xmath15 4300 .",
    "exposure times ranged from 5 to 10 minutes and yielded a composite spectrum with a signal - to - noise ratio @xmath16 in the continuum at 4000  .",
    "all spectra were obtained at the parallactic angle , and comparison lamp exposures were obtained after every exposure .",
    "we checked the stability of the spectrograph by measuring the radial velocity of the hg emission line at 4358.34 and found it to be stable to within 3 km s@xmath1 .",
    "the spectra were flux - calibrated using blue spectrophotometric standards @xcite .",
    "heliocentric radial velocities were measured using the cross - correlation package rvsao @xcite .",
    "we obtained preliminary velocities by cross - correlating the observations with bright wd templates of known velocity .",

    "runaway disk stars are explained by velocity kicks from 3- or 4-body dynamical interactions or from binary companions that explode as supernovae .",
    "depending on the orbital separation and binary mass fraction , a supernova explosion may or may not disrupt the binary system . if the companion to lp400@xmath022  is a neutron star , it could be responsible for the observed high velocity of the system .",

    "<S> we report the detection of a radial velocity companion to the extremely low mass white dwarf lp400@xmath022 . </S>",
    "<S> the radial velocity of the white dwarf shows variations with a semi - amplitude of 119 km s@xmath1 and a 0.98776 day period , which implies a companion mass of @xmath2@xmath3 . the optical photometry rules out a main sequence companion . </S>",
    "<S> thus the invisible companion is another white dwarf or a neutron star . using proper motion measurements and the radial velocity of the binary system , we find that it has an unusual galactic orbit . </S>",
    "<S> lp400@xmath022  is moving away from the galactic center with a velocity of @xmath4 km s@xmath1 , which is very difficult to explain by supernova runaway ejection mechanisms . </S>",
    "<S> dynamical interactions with a massive black hole like that in the galactic center can in principle explain its peculiar velocity , if the progenitor was a triple star system comprised of a close binary and a distant tertiary companion . </S>",
    "<S> until better proper motions become available , we consider lp400@xmath022  to be most likely a halo star with a very unusual orbit . </S>"
