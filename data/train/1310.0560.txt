    "disk accretion of gaseous material onto a massive black hole ( mbh ) is believed to be the central engine of qso and active galactic nucleus ( agn ; e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    ". in the thin disk accretion scenario , the emergent spectrum of a qso is mainly determined by several parameters , including the mbh mass ( @xmath11 ) and spin ( @xmath12 ) , the accretion rate ( @xmath13 ) , and the inclination angle ( @xmath14 ) of the disk to the line of sight ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* see also @xcite ) .",
    "measuring the mbh mass ( @xmath15 ) and spin ( @xmath12 ) for each individual qsos is of fundamental importance and has been one of the major goals for the qso and mbh studies . as illustrated by a number of studies ( e.g. , * ?",

    "@xmath11 , @xmath13 and @xmath12 can be estimated through the fitting of the multi - wavelength spectrum of each qso by dedicated disk model(s ) ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , it is practically not easy to estimate these parameters simultaneously with considerable accuracy , partly because of the complications in disk accretion model(s ) and partly because of lack of measurements at the euv to soft x - ray bands , where the disk emission is expected to be most prominent , for most qsos .",
    "alternative methods to estimate @xmath11 and @xmath12 are necessary for understanding the evolution and assembly history of mbhs .    the mass of a mbh in a qso can be estimated through the reverberation mapping ( rm ) technique @xcite , which is time consuming and currently is not possible for all qsos .",
    "fortunately , recent developments in measuring the masses of mbhs through the rm technique have resulted in some empirical scaling relations , i.e. , the virial mass estimators , which offer simple ways to estimate the mbh mass of a qso ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "@xcite have obtained the mbh masses for most sdss qsos by using the qso optical luminosities and the width of some broad emission lines ( such as h@xmath16 , civ , and mg ii ) in the qso spectra .",
    "if the mbh mass is known for a qso , the absolute accretion rate @xmath13 can be estimated based on the optical band luminosity by using the thin disk accretion model . the radiative efficiency is then obtained by @xmath17 , where @xmath1 is the bolometric luminosity .",
    "the mbh spin @xmath12 can be inferred from @xmath0 as @xmath0 is simply determined by @xmath12 in the thin disk accretion model . with this method , it may be possible to indirectly infer the mbh spin and its distribution for a large sample of qsos .",
    "( note here that direct measuring the spins of mbhs through features like the broad fe k@xmath18 line is currently possible only for a limited number of cases ( e.g. , mcg-6 - 30 - 15 and a dozen of other agns ; see @xcite ; and reference therein ) .",
    "@xcite estimated @xmath0 for @xmath6 pg qsos ( hereafter dl sample or dl qsos ) by adopting the above method and found that @xmath0 is strongly correlated with @xmath11 , i.e. , @xmath19 , and they argued that such a correlation is unlikely induced by selection effects ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see also @xcite ) .",
    "if the above correlation is intrinsic , it might suggest that the spin of a big mbh is relatively larger than that of a small mbh and the growth histories of big mbhs are systematically different from that of small mbhs .",
    "however , @xcite argued that such a correlation is most likely an artifact of the small parameter space in both luminosity and redshift covered by the dl sample , and additional factors , such as the host galaxy and dust contamination , uncertainties in the bolometric luminosity estimations , may also bias the estimations of @xmath0 .",
    "@xcite concluded that the radiative efficiency itself can not be accurately measured due to the large errors in the relevant observed parameters .",
    "therefore , it is still not clear whether @xmath0 really intrinsically correlates with @xmath11 or not .    in this study , we extend the work of @xcite to the type 1 sdss qsos , in order to further study the radiative efficiency of individual qsos and its relation , if any , with mbh mass .",
    "such a study should be helpful to identify various biases involved in the estimations of @xmath0 and address the question of whether @xmath0 correlates with @xmath11 or not , as the sdss sample has many more qsos and covers larger luminosity and redshift ranges compared to the dl sample .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : sdssqso ] , we introduce the sdss qso sample adopted in this study . in section  [ sec : estepsilon ] , we first introduce the method to estimate the radiative efficiency and then obtain the radiative efficiency for individual type 1 sdss qsos .",
    "similar to @xcite , we also find that the estimated radiative efficiency appears to be strongly correlated with the mbh virial mass at redshift @xmath20 .",
    "such a strong correlation appears to exist for the sdss qsos at @xmath21 but not at @xmath22 . in section  [ sec : bias ] , we investigate various biases that could be involved in the @xmath0 estimations and the selection effects of the qso sample , and adopt monte carlo simulations to generate mock qso samples to simulate the effects of these biases .",

    "estimations of the mbh masses of the qsos in this sample have been obtained by using the virial mass estimators based on scaling relationships calibrated for four different emission lines , i.e. , h@xmath18 , h@xmath16 , mg ii , and civ .",

    "it is possible to statistically model the various biases in the estimations of the radiative efficiency and the selection effects of the sdss qsos .",
    "to do so , we generate mock sdss qso samples according to the true mbh mass function and the eddington ratio distribution obtained in @xcite , by involving the selection criteria of the sdss qsos and the uncertainties in the mbh virial mass estimations and the inclination angles .",
    "we estimate the radiative efficiency for qsos in each mock sample by adopting the same method as that for the sdss qso and obtain the probability density distribution of those mock qsos in the radiative efficiency versus the mbh virial mass plane .",
    "we find that the @xmath0@xmath102 correlations for the sdss qsos in different redshift bins can be well explained by the selection effects and the biases induced by the usage of @xmath102 as the true mbh mass , and the selection effects play the dominant roles in leading to the @xmath0@xmath102 correlation , as suggested by @xcite .",
    "we conclude that the current sdss qso data is consistent with no intrinsic correlation between the qso radiative efficiency and the true mbh mass .    in principle ,",
    "the accretion rate of a qso may be better determined by fitting the qso spectrum covering a wide range of wavelengths ( e.g. , from the infrared band to the hard x - ray band ) , through an elaborate accretion disk model , and the constraints on the mbh spin and consequently the radiative efficiency may be also simultaneously obtained . in the future , if observations can obtain the spectra for a large sample of qsos , with good wavelength , luminosity and redshift coverage , it may be possible to estimate their radiative efficiencies in a more self - consistent way and then further investigate the relationship , if any , between the radiative efficiency and the mbh mass , which would shed light on not only the assembly history of mbhs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) but also the physical reasons for the small spread in the sed shapes of qsos pointed by @xcite .",
