    "yig also offers a playground for exploring non - linear magnetization phenomena at high microwave power levels , such as spin wave instabilities , foldover and bistable behaviour.@xcite in recent years , there has been significant interest in observing non - linear spin dynamics in yig via ishe measurements and harnessing these effects in spintronics devices.@xcite    the simplest example of a non - linear regime in spin pumping is the effect of decreasing static component of magnetization .",

    "<S> we report on the deformation of microwave absorption spectra and of the inverse spin hall voltage signals in thin film bilayers of yttrium iron garnet ( yig ) and platinum at high microwave power levels in a 9.45-ghz te@xmath0 cavity . as the microwave power increases from 0.15 to 200 mw , the resonance field shifts to higher values , and the initially lorentzian spectra of the microwave absorption intensity as well as </S>",
    "<S> the inverse spin hall voltage signals become asymmetric . </S>",
    "<S> the contributions from opening of the magnetization precession cone and heating of yig can not well reproduce the data . </S>",
    "<S> control measurements of inverse spin hall voltages on thin - film yig@xmath1pt systems with a range of line widths underscore the role of spin - wave excitations in spectral deformation . </S>"
