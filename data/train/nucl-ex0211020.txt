    "this experiment determines the parity - violating longitudinal analyzing power , @xmath5 , in @xmath1 elastic scattering , where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the scattering cross sections for positive and negative helicity .",
    "the measurements were performed in transmission geometry , with beam energy and detector geometries selected to ensure that parity mixing in the lowest order @xmath8 partial wave amplitude did not contribute to the measured @xmath0 , hence leaving a parity violating asymmetry arising almost entirely from @xmath9 mixing @xcite .",
    "this amplitude has not previously been studied experimentally , and the possibility is unique to the energy regime accessible with the triumf cyclotron .",
    "the energy at which the contribution to @xmath0 from the lowest order @xmath8 mixing vanishes is determined by the well known strong nuclear phase shifts .",
    "the scale factors multiplying this and other partial wave contributions are set by the weak interaction .",
    "@xmath1 parity violation experiments determine these scale factors experimentally . in the context of the weak meson exchange model @xcite , the triumf measurement of @xmath0 determines primarily the weak @xmath10-meson - nucleon coupling constant @xmath3 = ( @xmath11 ) , where the superscripts refer to isospin change @xcite .",
    "precision results already obtained by the sin group at 45 mev @xcite and the bonn group at 13.6 mev @xcite determined essentially the sum @xmath12 , where @xmath13 . with the addition of the triumf result at 221.3 mev , @xmath3 and @xmath4 are now determined separately for the first time .",
    "it is important to have experimentally determined values of the weak meson - nucleon couplings , as theoretical calculations of their values are quite uncertain and the correct values are helpful in the interpretation of the results of other parity violation experiments .",
    "they are needed , for example , in calculations of the proton anapole moment @xcite , one of the radiative corrections to the electron - nucleon isovector axial form factor in experiments such as sample @xcite and g@xmath14 @xcite .",
    "triumf e497 @xcite , was first funded in 1988 , and the required new beamline was completed in 1994 . a major effort to understand and minimize systematic error contributions was then undertaken .",
    "following many years of effort that resulted in the reduction of both the helicity correlated beam modulations @xmath15 and the sensitivities @xmath16 , to these modulations , the first significant data set for e497 was acquired in february and march of 1997 , with a statistical error on @xmath0 of @xmath17 , and most systematic errors at or below the 10@xmath18 level .",
    "that result represented a major milestone for the experiment @xcite .",
    "data taking continued in 1998 and 1999 , the final re - analysis of all the data was completed in early 2001 @xcite , and the result for @xmath0 was published @xcite .",
    "the present paper presents detailed descriptions of the experiment , the data analysis , and systematic error corrections , that were not included in the letter @xcite .",
    "the principle of the experiment is straightforward .",
    "a longitudinally polarized proton beam is passed through a liquid hydrogen target and the change in transmission when the spin of the incident protons is reversed is the parity violating signal . to measure this , the beam current before and after the liquid hydrogen target was measured and the signals were subtracted ( fig . [ principle ] ) .",
    "the spin state was then changed in a special pattern at 40 spin states per second and synchronous detection was used to extract that component of the difference signal that was synchronized with the spin flip .",
    "unfortunately , beam parameters other than spin changed when the spin was flipped , and great pains had to be taken to measure , and correct for , the false signals resulting from these unwanted helicity correlated changes . technical details of the systems required to do this will be described in detail in what follows , but an idea of the complexity can be obtained from fig .",

    "[ timing ] , showing the sequencing of the control measurements within a 200 ms , eight spin - state cycle .        because of the importance of understanding systematic errors in such an experiment , essentially all the pieces of equipment , from the ion source to the beam dump , had to be considered integral parts of the parity experiment .",
    "figure [ general ] shows the main subsystems of the experiment  the triumf optically pumped polarized ion source ( oppis ) , the cyclotron , the beam transport , and the specialized parity instrumentation @xcite .",
    "a 5 @xmath19a transversely polarized beam was transported to the cyclotron through an approximately 50 m long injection beamline .",
    "a 200 na beam at 75 - 80% vertical polarization was extracted at 221.3 mev .",
    "spin precession through pairs of solenoid and dipole magnets resulted in delivery of a longitudinally polarized beam to the parity apparatus .",
    "there were two complementary states of the spin transport , the `` positive helicity '' and `` negative helicity '' beamline tunes , which transported spin - up in the cyclotron into either @xmath20 or @xmath21 helicity at the parity apparatus .",
    "in the last section of the beam line , the longitudinally polarized beam first passed through a series of diagnostic devices  two beam intensity profile monitors ( ipms ) and two transverse polarization profile monitors ( ppms )  before reaching the @xmath22 target , which was preceded and followed by transverse electric field , parallel plate ionization chambers ( trics ) to measure the target transmission .",
    "a third ipm was located immediately in front of the @xmath22 target , inside the cryostat vacuum .      in the ion source ,",
    "9 w of 795 nm laser light was used to optically pump a rubidium vapor whose polarization was ultimately transferred to the protons of the @xmath23 beam .",
    "the polarization was reversed using small tilting etalons to make rapid frequency adjustments to the two pumping lasers to match either the @xmath6 or @xmath7 component of the rubidium d@xmath24 transition ; the two are separated by 93.5 ghz .",
    "no macroscopic electric or magnetic fields were altered .",
    "this minimized helicity correlated changes in accelerated beam parameters other than polarization .",
    "this was very important to the success of the experiment .",
    "the ion source is the ultimate origin of all helicity correlated modulations , and the more that unwanted modulations could be reduced at the source the less corrections were required later .",
    "the extracted beam current required by the experiment was not large ( 200 na ) so , to reduce unwanted helicity correlated modulations , it was possible to sacrifice most of the oppis intensity in return for beam quality .",
    "for example , the rf bunchers in the injection beamline , which enhance the cyclotron transmission by a factor of five , also amplify the coherent energy modulations by two orders of magnitude , and could not be used during the parity experiment .",
    "high - current oppis development @xcite for high energy accelerators proceeded at the same time as development of the triumf source and contributed greatly to the parity violation experiment .",
    "the polarization of the rubidium vapor was monitored and controlled on - line by observing the faraday rotation of light from an additional 100 mw , tis probe laser that emitted 780.8 nm light ",
    "close to the d@xmath25 transition of rubidium .",
    "the polarization of the linearly polarized probe laser light rotated through an angle proportional to the rubidium vapor polarization .",
    "the faraday measurements also provided confirmation of the helicity state of oppis .",
    "the faraday rotation signal was encoded as a frequency to prevent helicity correlated signals from being present in the electronics racks .",
    "details of the oppis faraday rotation system are described elsewhere @xcite .",
    "every effort was made to tune oppis for minimum intensity change on spin flip .",
    "the main technique used to do this was to keep the rubidium polarization , as measured by the faraday rotation , at close to 100% and with the two spin states matched to better than @xmath260.5% .",
    "it was not possible to eliminate helicity correlated current modulation completely , but under normal data taking conditions , helicity - correlated current modulations @xmath27 of a few parts in @xmath28 were routinely achieved .",
    "to enable measurement of the sensitivity of the experiment to coherent intensity modulation , provision was made at the ion source to produce an intentional , controlled , intensity modulation when desired .",
    "this was done using an auxiliary 18 w green argon laser ( spectra physics inc .",
    ", operating on all lines with most power at 514 nm and 488 nm ) beam that co - propagated with the @xmath23 beam along the 30 m long horizontal section of the injection beam line , neutralizing through photodetachment a small fraction of the beam .",
    "the photodetachment laser could be interrupted synchronously with the parity spin sequence , so that the beam current in every other `` spin off '' ( i.e. with the optical pumping lasers blocked with a shutter ) data taking cycle was modulated at the 0.1% level .",
    "after extraction from oppis , the @xmath23 beam passed through a wien filter that was tuned to produce vertical polarization at the entrance to the cyclotron .",
    "the injection line from the ion source to the cyclotron used electrostatic elements and was magnetically shielded from the fringe field of the cyclotron .",
    "instabilities in the polarized ion source , beamline power supplies , and mechanical vibrations of the whole injector building structure , cause the beam position at the injection point to fluctuate .",
    "these fluctuations are converted to energy and current modulations of the accelerated beam .",
    "these were significantly reduced by a position stabilization feedback system installed in the vertical section of the injection beamline @xcite .",
    "the system was based on two split - plate beam position monitors , with correction voltages applied to electrostatic steering plates .",
    "about 50% of the beam was lost on the split - plates , but the result was a significant improvement in the beam stability , and a reduction in noise .",
    "the sampling rate of the integrated current feedback amplifier was 1 khz , so spin - flip correlated position modulations produced in the source at 40 hz were also reduced by the position stabilization system .",
    "after injection into the cyclotron , the beam was accelerated to 221.3 mev in the cyclotron , and was extracted by a thin stripping foil .",
    "various stripping foil designs were tried , but most of the data were taken with a 2.5 mm wide x 26 mm high x 5 mg/@xmath29 thick , pyrolytic graphite foil .",
    "this foil was mounted in a special `` bow - saw '' shaped holder that supported the foil from both ends to prevent curling . following extraction from the cyclotron ,",
    "the proton polarization vector was precessed through @xmath30 in the first solenoid , 88.61@xmath31 in the first ( 40@xmath31 ) dipole , @xmath32 in the second solenoid , and 26.58@xmath31 in the final ( 12@xmath31 ) dipole , resulting in a longitudinally polarized beam that was transported to the parity apparatus .",
    "the sign of the solenoid rotation was chosen depending on the desired helicity of the tune and the exact solenoid strengths were fine tuned empirically to produce pure longitudinal polarization in the presence of the cyclotron fringe field .",
    "in contrast with systems using only one solenoid and one dipole , which can produce longitudinal polarization only at one energy , the triumf system is capable of producing longitudinal polarization at any proton energy up to 500 mev .",
    "@xcite .",
    "ideally , the beam transport should produce an achromatic waist downstream of the @xmath22 target , to minimize the effect of first moments of transverse polarization , which are the dominant source of systematic error in this experiment , as they couple to the large ( @xmath33 ) parity allowed transverse analyzing power @xmath34 .",
    "the rotation of phase space introduced by the superconducting solenoid magnets was approximately compensated for by rotating the quadrupole doublet before the final 12 degree bend by @xmath35 and the quadrupole triplet following the bend by @xmath36 . to reverse the spin direction at the parity target relative to the spin in the cyclotron",
    ", the directions of the solenoidal fields and the signs of the quadrupole rotations were reversed . in principle , that should have been be all that was required . in practice ,",
    "small adjustments to some quadrupole and steering magnets were necessary , but empirical tunes were developed that kept these changes very small ( 1 - 2% ) .    between the second solenoid magnet and the final @xmath37 bend , where the polarization of the beam has both a longitudinal and a sideways component , a four branch polarimeter @xcite was used to measure the transverse polarization components at regular intervals . since the angle of the polarization vector is known at this location , the absolute beam polarization could be determined . once the beam passed the final dipole magnet , the polarization was longitudinal and the ppms determined the small transverse components .",
    "the upstream polarimeter was also used , with purely vertically polarized beam , to check the absolute calibration of the ppms .",
    "just after the upstream polarimeter , a beam energy monitor ( bem ) @xcite was available to measure the energy of the proton beam .",
    "the bem achieves a statistical precision of @xmath26 20 kev in approximately one hour .",
    "the absolute calibration is known to @xmath38 kev @xcite .",
    "the ( bem ) target could not be inserted during normal data taking , so periodic bem measures were made to check the beam energy .",
    "table [ energies ] summarizes the beam energy measurements .",
    "lr running period & beam energy + 1997 & @xmath39 mev + 1998 & @xmath40 mev + 1999 & @xmath41 mev +    [ energies ]      the beam energy of 221.3 mev at the target entrance was chosen so that the @xmath42 contribution would be zero when the acceptance of the detectors and the energy loss in the target was taken into account .",
    "this was done using a monte carlo program that simulated the experiment using detailed target and detector geometries , and including the energy dependence of the strong @xmath43 phase shifts .",
    "it was found that the beam energy was not overly critical ; a departure of one mev from the energy for which the @xmath44 contribution integrated to zero caused this mixing to contribute only @xmath45 to @xmath0 .",
    "theoretical calculations of @xmath0 based on total cross section , and which assume no energy loss in the target , show the @xmath44 zero at 225 mev , where the @xmath46 and @xmath47 strong phase shifts are equal and opposite @xcite . according to the monte carlo simulation , this theoretical @xmath0 at 225 mev",
    "should be compared to the triumf @xmath0 multiplied by @xmath48 .",
    "very strict constraints had to be imposed on the incident longitudinally polarized beam to limit both random and helicity correlated modulations of the beam intensity , energy , horizontal ( @xmath49 ) and vertical ( @xmath50 ) position and direction , beam width ( @xmath51 and @xmath52 ) , transverse polarization ( @xmath53 and @xmath54 ) , and first moments of transverse polarization ( @xmath55 and @xmath56 ) .",
    "the approach followed was to design the experimental apparatus for minimum sensitivity to beam property variations , to monitor helicity - correlated beam properties during data taking , and to correct the data for all significant helicity correlated effects .",
    "a program of auxiliary calibration measurements was interwoven in the regular data taking cycle in order to establish the sensitivity of the apparatus to all measurable systematic effects under data taking conditions .",
    "the custom - built parity instrumentation occupied approximately the last 10 m of the beamline , between the last quadrupole magnet and the west wall in the triumf proton hall ( beamline 4a/2 ) .",
    "transverse field parallel plate ion chambers tric1 and tric2 measured the beam current incident on and transmitted through the target .",
    "the parity violation signal was derived from the helicity - correlated analog signal difference between the beam currents measured by the two trics .",
    "upstream of the target were two polarization profile monitors ( ppms ) to measure the distributions of transverse polarization @xmath57 and @xmath58 across the beam .",
    "the three intensity profile monitors ( ipms ) , measured the intensity distribution of beam current in @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "two of the ipms were coupled to a pair of fast ferrite cored steering magnets ( fcsms ) that locked the beam path on the desired axis through the equipment .",
    "the ipm signals were based on secondary emission from thin nickel foil strips arranged in harps placed between 8 @xmath19 m thick aluminum foils ( a very similar , earlier version is described in @xcite and @xcite ) . for ipm1 and ipm2",
    "the nickel strips were 3 @xmath19 m thick , 1.5 mm wide , and spaced 2.0 mm center to center .",
    "in ipm3 , the nickel strips were 10 @xmath19 m thick , 2.5 mm wide , and spaced 3.0 mm center to center .",
    "each ipm contained a vertical and a horizontal harp with 31 strips per harp .",
    "ipm1 also contained an aluminum normalization foil that provided a beam current signal to the liquid hydrogen target controller .",
    "the 31 signals from the strips of each of the six planes were individually amplified and digitized to provide the beam intensity profiles in each spin state .",
    "hardware beam centroid evaluators delivered signals proportional to the beam centroids .",
    "corresponding correction signals were used to drive feedback loops to the pair of horizontal and vertical fast fcsms ( fig [ general ] ) .",
    "this allowed the beam intensity profile centroids to be kept within @xmath59 m with a dc offset less than 50 @xmath19 m from the desired axis .",
    "sensitivities to helicity - correlated position and size modulations were determined with the beam unpolarized and with enhanced modulations introduced using the fast , fcsms synchronized to the spin sequence .",
    "blades through the beam .",
    "the blades measure 5 mm x 1.6 mm in cross section and extend 85 mm beyond the holders .",
    "each ppm has two horizontally scanning and two vertically scanning blades .",
    "this figure shows a blade at the middle of a vertical scan.,width=151 ]    the ppms are described in detail in @xcite .",
    "each ppm has four high density polyethylene ( ch@xmath25 ) blades , 5 mm x 1.6 mm in cross section .",
    "the blades were mounted on wheels rotating at 5 revolutions per second , and were scanned through the beam as shown in fig .",
    "[ blades ] , two blades scanning vertically through the beam and two blades scanning horizontally .",
    "the figure shows one blade in the middle of a vertical scan .",
    "protons elastically scattered from hydrogen in the blades were detected by sets of forward and recoil scintillator telescopes , the geometry of which was set to select only @xmath1 elastic events at 17.5@xmath60 laboratory angle , near the maximum in the parity allowed analyzing power , @xmath34 . during vertical scans the up - down asymmetry was measured , and during horizontal scans the left - right asymmetry was measured .",
    "information from each blade was stored in 80 time bins of 80 @xmath19s each , for a total time window of 6.4 ms per blade .",
    "as the radius of rotation is 215 mm , this corresponds to @xmath61 mm @xmath62 mm centered on the nominal beam axis . from the up - down or left - right asymmetry in each bin ,",
    "a distribution of transverse polarization across the beam profile was generated .",
    "the two ppms were operated with a 180@xmath31 angular mismatch , producing 8 equally spaced profiles in 1/5 second , or 40 profiles per second .",
    "( this is also the spin flip rate ",
    "[ timing ] )    the master clock for sequencing the whole experiment , including helicity changes , was derived from 2500-line optical encoders mounted on the ppm drive shafts .",
    "each shaft encoder produced two 2500 cycle per revolution square waves in phase quadrature , permitting the direction of rotation to be determined from whether one signal was high or low at the positive going transition of the other . by recording both the rising and falling edges of both quadrature signals ,",
    "the ppm control electronics obtained an effective resolution of 4 @xmath63 2500 = 10,000 lines .",
    "the rotation of the two ppms was synchronized by electronic gearing using position information provided by the shaft encoders . during steady state rotation at 5 revolutions per second ,",
    "the servo system was able to control the angle between the two ppms to @xmath64 milliradian , corresponding to one - third of the 1.6 mm target blade thickness at the location of the proton beam .",
    "the @xmath22 target had a flask 0.10 m in diameter and 0.40 m long .",
    "the target scattered @xmath654% of the beam .",
    "it was important that the windows on the hydrogen volume be flat and parallel to prevent motion of the proton beam from creating intensity noise .",
    "the hydrogen was contained by 25 @xmath19 m thick stainless steel windows .",
    "upstream and downstream of these inside the vacuum vessel were two helium filled chambers , 21 mm thick on the upstream side and 10 mm thick on the downstream side , ensuring that the inner windows were flat .",
    "the outer windows of the helium cells were 50 @xmath19 m thick stainless steel .",
    "the cryostat vacuum vessel was sealed with 25 @xmath19 m thick copper windows .",
    "although a thick target is desirable from the standpoint of increasing the signal , it was also very important that the tails of the beam profile be well contained in the 150 mm @xmath63 150 mm aperture of the detectors ; beam blow - up due to multiple coulomb scattering limited the target flask length , as well as the thickness of various entrance and exit windows and the thickness of the upstream ipm foils . with the target full , the beam size increased from approximately 4 mm ( @xmath66 of projected profile ) at the center of the the upstream detector to 15 mm at the center of the downstream detector , and 22 mm by its exit .",
    "rapid circulation ( 5 @xmath67 ) of the @xmath22 reduced density gradients and prevented boiling . a feedback loop using fast and slow heaters controlled the target temperature .",
    "the fast heater responded to a beam current signal from ipm1 ( sec .",
    "[ subsubsec : ipm ] ) , and kept the heat load essentially constant when the beam current changed .",
    "the slow heater made fine adjustments to hold the lh@xmath25 temperature at 19.3 k to within @xmath68 k over a several week data taking period .",
    "each tric ( a smaller earlier version is described in @xcite ) consisted of a cylindrical enclosure filled with 750 liters of ultra - high purity hydrogen gas at a pressure of about 150 torr , and contained an upper cathode plate operated at -8 kv , and a grounded lower signal plate .",
    "the trics also contained field shaping electrodes plus guard rings to ensure a uniform sense region , 150 mm wide by 150 mm high by 600 mm long between the parallel electrodes .",
    "high - z , low - energy spallation products from the chamber windows can cause large fluctuations in the signal , so the entrance and exit windows were located approximately 900 mm from the center to prevent spallation products from entering the active region .",
    "other considerations in the design of the trics were noise due to delta ray ( @xmath69-ray ) production and ion pair recombination .",
    "recombination is reduced by lower gas pressure and higher voltage , both of which reduce the space charge density in the active volume . in practice , compromises must be made because too high a voltage causes increased noise from corona discharge and low pressure reduces the desired signal .",
    "@xmath69-rays are electrons produced by collisions of the protons with the detector gas .",
    "the @xmath69-ray signal is noisy , and the major contribution to this signal is from @xmath69-rays at large angles .",
    "the transverse dimension of the ion chamber was a trade - off between a small transverse size which would minimize @xmath69-ray noise and a large transverse dimension which accepts all the beam .",
    "the 150 mm transverse dimension was the smallest that gave an acceptably low sensitivity to beam size modulation based on simulations .",
    "the main signal from the proton beam increases with the length of the active region .",
    "this was limited by the available space in the beamline ; 600 mm was the longest practical length .",
    "the noise in the ion chamber signals has two incoherent contributions  shot noise from the statistical nature of the proton beam , and noise contributed by the chamber itself .",
    "the noise figure , @xmath70 , expresses the chamber noise as a fraction of the shot noise .",
    "when the difference between the upstream and downstream chambers is taken , most of the shot noise contribution disappears because , except for the 4% scattered by the target , each upstream proton also passes through the downstream chamber . the chamber noise , on the other hand",
    ", does not cancel , and the running time is dominated by chamber noise . in this experiment",
    "the counting time was approximately 15 times that which would have been expected from counting statistics alone .",
    "the fact that the run time was dominated by chamber noise resulted in the seemingly paradoxical result that better precision was obtained by lowering the beam current , because this reduced the detector noise figure . in a series of test runs at progressively reduced beam currents ,",
    "the @xmath0 distribution became narrower until approximately 100 na .",
    "the 200 na selected for running was a compromise between lower current for better precision on @xmath0 and higher current for better precision from the ppms , which _ were _ limited by counting statistics .",
    "the data were taken in @xmath71 second ( 200 ms ) cycles , each cycle consisting of eight @xmath72 second ( 25 ms ) spin states arranged in the pattern ( @xmath73 ) or ( @xmath74 ) .",
    "this pattern makes the result insensitive to linear or quadratic drifts .",
    "the cycles were further arranged in an eight cycle ( 64 spin state ) `` supercycle '' , with the starting state of each cycle following the same ( @xmath73 ) or ( @xmath74 ) pattern .",
    "the initial spin state of each supercycle was chosen at random . in the frequency domain",
    ", this switching pattern contains odd multiples of 5 hz , with the largest harmonic content at 15 hz .",
    "the data acquisition produced on - line values for the amplitude and phase of the dominant 15 hz component .",
    "this was derived from a 16 spin state cycle .",
    "the 64 spin state supercycle gave the option of using more advanced digital filtering schemes on the difference signal , but these were only used during early development runs .",
    "20% of the data were taken with all the spin flipping equipment running , but with the pumping lasers blocked with a shutter to guarantee zero polarization .",
    "in addition , as mentioned earlier , half of these `` spin off '' data were taken with an artificially enhanced intensity modulation synchronized with the spin flip .    as shown in fig .",
    "[ spinstate ] , each 25 ms spin state was divided into polarization measuring and asymmetry measuring intervals .",
    "following a short dead time to allow the mechanical etalons which change the ion source spin state time to stabilize , was a 6.4 ms window during which one of the 8 blades of the scanning polarimeters passed through the beam . the tric and ipm signals were then integrated over exactly 1/60 second to eliminate sensitivity to 60 hz or harmonics of 60 hz .",
    "the dead interval at the end of each state was intended as a buffer to absorb any timing jitter due to imperfect rotation speed of the ppms .",
    "as it turned out , the timing jitter was less than 0.1 ms and this buffer zone was more than adequate .",
    "the minimum data set for which a full set of helicity correlated beam properties could be extracted was a 0.4 s `` event pair '' corresponding to two full 360@xmath31 rotations of the ppms , as this gave both spin states for each ppm blade .",
    "as noted in the ion source section , the spin state was transmitted as a frequency to prevent coupling the spin flip signal into the data acquisition .",
    "the effectiveness of this isolation was checked by running the complete data acquisition system including the ion source , but with detector signals supplied by a battery .",
    "false @xmath0 from electronic crosstalk was found to be less than @xmath75 , an upper limit determined by the statistics of the test ( crosstalk was probably less ) .",
    "the rotation speed of the ppms is locked to a signal derived from the zero crossing of the 60 hz ac line . since",
    "the 0.2 s taken for one ppm rotation is exactly 12 cycles of the 60 hz line , one would expect a given ppm blade to always pass through the beam at the same phase of the ac line . to prevent this , a small controlled phase slip was introduced .",
    "the rate of slip was programmable . for data taking it",
    "was set for one complete cycle of the 60 hz line in 18 minutes .",
    "although the phase of one ppm relative to the other is `` quantized '' by the finite resolution of the encoders , the angular frequency of rotation is not , and in principle can be locked to a square wave of any frequency . in practice , roundoff error in the motor control computer limited the choices of the reference frequency .",
    "the 18 minutes for 360@xmath31 of slip corresponded to one of the acceptable values .",
    "in addition to the regular data taking runs , many dedicated control measurements were made to measure the sensitivity of the apparatus to helicity correlated beam properties , specifically : position , size , intensity , transverse polarization , and energy modulation at the ion source .",
    "the parity data used in the final analysis were acquired during three major data taking periods  february - march 1997 , july - august 1998 , and may - june 1999 .",
    "the data were recorded as a series of `` runs '' of approximately one hour each .",
    "statistics for the combined set are    * 3.8 million event pairs * 375 runs in positive beamline helicity * 368 runs in negative beamline helicity * 80 position modulation runs * 81 size modulation runs * 40 energy modulation runs * 109 neutral axis scans    the runs were grouped into 23 sets , a new set being started following each re - tune of the beamline ( usually involving a reversal of the helicity at the parity apparatus relative to the ion source ) .      during data taking every effort was made to maintain the optimum beam conditions ( quiet beam , good longitudinal polarization , low transverse polarization , low first moments of transverse polarization , beam on axis , stable position and size , low intensity modulation ) , and to stop data taking to correct the beam and cyclotron tune when these conditions were not met .",
    "nevertheless , some data were recorded for which conditions were not ideal .",
    "the raw data sample was therefore subjected to data quality cuts prior to inclusion in the final analysis .",
    "the data quality cuts were conservatively chosen to ensure that corrections to the reduced data set based on critical helicity - correlated beam parameters would be consistent with sensitivities measured in ancillary calibration experiments .",
    "the data quality cuts first eliminated 46 data runs for which the tric difference signal was anomalously noisy , indicating unstable beam conditions .",
    "they also eliminated any data for which diagnostic monitor outputs could be considered spurious .",
    "the cuts used are summarized in table [ cuts ] .",
    "there were both `` hard cuts '' at a fixed value of beam parameter and `` soft cuts '' at @xmath76 from the mean value .",

    "it proved to be a net advantage to devote significant beam development time to producing quiet , stable , beam .",
    "the approach to minimizing and correcting for the false @xmath0 signal due to helicity correlated beam property changes was as follows :    * careful design and operation of the triumf optically pumped polarized ion source and cyclotron made it possible to change the spin direction with very little effect on the other beam properties . * the design of the parity equipment and the operating conditions of the experiment were carefully chosen to minimize the sensitivity to helicity correlated changes . *",
    "calibration runs determined the sensitivity to helicity correlated modulations . *",
    "the beam properties were continuously monitored during data taking so the actual helicity correlated changes were known , and appropriate corrections were applied .",
    "the effects of modulations in beam intensity , position , size , transverse polarization , and energy were considered .",
    "measurements made early in the experimental program revealed significant correlations between beam parameters .",

    "large values of modulation were used to give accurate results in a short time . to determine the sensitivity to first moments of transverse polarization , which gave the largest false asymmetry , much larger transverse polarizations were used for calibration than were present in the parity beam .",
    "this was justifiable because false asymmetries must be linear in polarization , and the use of large polarizations allowed the displacements needed for the calibration to be reduced .",
    "the measured false asymmetry was linear in polarization moment .",
    "as the energy of the beam was 27 mev lower at tric2 than at tric1 , the tric2 gas pressure was lowered relative to tric1 to equalize ion chamber currents . a hardware gain on the tric1 signal",

    "because of the nonlinearity term , @xmath85 must be reset if the beam current changes .",
    "a beam current stabilization system was implemented which restricted beam current excursions to the range @xmath95 na @xcite .",
    "the current stabilization system took a current signal from the upstream ionization chamber ( tric1 ) and fed a correction voltage to an electrostatic quadrupole lens just upstream of a set of slits in the injection line .",
    "the injection line was tuned with a slight excess of current so that , at the set point , about 10% of the beam was skimmed by the slits . to exclude coupling of current modulation to position and energy modulations , the sampling rate was slow ( 0.5 hz ) , much slower than the spin - flip rate of 40 hz .",

    "the energy modulation sensitivities depended on the beamline tune , so the distribution of measured oppis energy modulation values and @xmath219 sensitivities was examined for a given beamline tune , and a correction and a `` worst case '' uncertainty in the correction were estimated .",
    "+ net corrections were calculated for energy modulation on a year by year basis .",
    "1998 and 1999 required two corrections each , one for each beamline helicity .",
    "1997 needed four corrections , as two wien filter settings were used .",
    "finally all the energy modulation corrections were combined and one correction was applied to the final @xmath0 .",
    "+ the energy modulation correction shown in table [ corr ] is the net effect of energy modulation over the three runs .",
    "the net correction was zero .",
    "the @xmath275 uncertainty comes from the quadrature sum of the uncertainty in energy modulation plus the uncertainty in the energy modulation sensitivities .",
    "this was not included in the individual error bars for the 23 @xmath0 numbers because the energy modulation was not known well enough . as a result , the reduced chi squared of 1.08 for the 23 sets is larger than it really `` should '' be if the energy modulation uncertainty was determined individually for each of the 23 sets and included in the individual set by set error bars .     and the most precise experimental data at 13.6 mev ( bonn ) , 45 mev ( psi ) and 221 mev ( triumf ) .",

    "the overall result for @xmath0 from the 23 sets is summarized in table [ corr ] . after correcting for systematic errors ,",
    "the longitudinal analyzing power is found to be @xmath276 at 221.3 mev incident proton energy and the target and detector geometry of this experiment . correcting for finite geometry and target thickness ( see sec .",
    "[ subsec : energy ] ) and combining the errors in quadrature , gives @xmath277 at 225 mev for comparison with theoretical calculations .",

    "theoretical predictions for @xmath0 from several models are shown .",
    "the model of driscoll and miller @xcite is based on the bonn potential to represent the strong n - n interaction , together with the weak meson - nucleon coupling constants as given by desplanques , donoghue , and holstein ( ddh ) @xcite .",
    "the prediction of iqbal and niskanen @xcite has a @xmath279 isobar contribution added to the driscoll and miller model on a semi - ad - hoc basis .",
    "the theoretical prediction of driscoll and meissner @xcite is based on a self - consistent calculation , with both weak and strong vertex functions obtained with a chiral soliton model .",
    "finally , the quark model calculation of grach and shmatikov @xcite takes explicit account of quark degrees of freedom .",
    "none of these predictions are in good agreement with the data , although they all have similar shapes due to the energy dependence of the strong interaction .",
    "a major source of uncertainty in these calculations is the value of the weak meson - nucleon couplings .",
    "starting with the work of desplanques , donoghue , and holstein ( ddh ) @xcite , many theoretical calculations of these quantities were made @xcite but theoretical uncertainties remained large . until the triumf experiment ,",
    "the coupling constants were very poorly constrained by experiment .",
    "figure [ couplings ] shows the limits on the weak meson - nucleon couplings @xmath3 and @xmath4 now imposed by the low energy results @xcite and the present triumf result .",
    "the error bands are based on a calculation by carlson _",
    "_ @xcite assuming the argonne @xmath280 ( av-18 ) potential @xcite , the bonn 2000 ( cd - bonn ) @xcite strong interaction coupling constants , and including all partial waves up to j=8 .",
    "although the triumf measurement is not sensitive to @xmath0 from @xmath281 mixing , and the contribution from @xmath282 mixing contains no @xmath283 contribution , there is some @xmath283 dependence arising from the higher partial wave mixings .",
    "the net result is that the acceptable band defined by the triumf measurement is almost orthogonal to that defined by the low energy measurements , and greatly reduces the acceptable ranges of both @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",

    "@xcite estimate @xmath284 and @xmath285 , compared to the ddh `` best guess '' values of @xmath286 and @xmath287 .",
    "the solid curve in fig . [ theory ] is calculated using the carlson _",
    "adjusted couplings .",
    "the reduction in the experimentally allowed range for weak meson - nucleon coupling constants also has implications for the analysis of electroweak radiative corrections in backward angle parity violating electron scattering . by combining back angle electron scattering data for hydrogen @xcite and deuterium @xcite ,",
    "the sample collaboration was able to extract values for both the isovector axial @xmath288-@xmath289 form factor , @xmath290 , and the strange magnetic form factor , @xmath291 at a momentum transfer @xmath292 ( gev / c)@xmath293 .",

    "_ @xcite by applying one quark and many quark ( proton anapole moment ) radiative corrections to the well known nucleon axial charge as measured in neutron @xmath296-decay .",
    "@xmath3 enters in the calculation of the proton anapole moment , but its contribution is small and one would require @xmath297 to bring the value up to the @xmath298 of the sample measurement .",
    "such a value of @xmath3 is now clearly ruled out by the @xmath43 parity violation data .",
    "the parity violating analyzing power , @xmath0 , in @xmath1 elastic scattering has been measured at 221.3 mev incident proton energy .",
    "the result constrains theoretical calculations of @xmath0 in an energy region not previously covered experimentally . in the case of meson exchange calculations , it constrains principally the value of the weak rho meson - nucleon coupling @xmath3 , but , when the low energy @xmath1 data are included , strong constraints are placed on the acceptable values of both @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
