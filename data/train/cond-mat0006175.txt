    "expreimental studies of coherent backscattering ( cbs ) of light from disordered media have been completed by many groups during the last decade.@xmath1 cbs measurements are of great interest because they have allowed to test the physics of weak localization , which was first uncovered in electronic transport,@xcite when applied to light waves and also to determine the light mean - free - path , @xmath2 in random media . in cbs measurements",
    "the normalized reflected light intensity ( also called the albedo , @xmath3 ) is monitored versus the deviation angle , @xmath4 from the backscattering direction of the incident laser beam . in the multiple scattering regime interference effects are averaged out except in a small angular range around @xmath5 , where constructive interference originating from reciprocal light paths enhance the diffusive reflection from the sample . as a result a coherent scattering intensity cone is formed in the albedo , @xmath6 for small @xmath7 . from the full width , @xmath8 of the cbs cone at quarter maximum , @xmath2 is obtained using the relation @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the impinging laser wavelengh .",
    "the first cbs measurements were performed on suspensions of polystyrene spheres.@xcite since the suspension particles were very small in diameter , their brownian motion provided a natural ensemble averaging . for solid materials",
    ", however cbs usually shows a noisy but repeatable mesoscopic pattern.@xcite under these conditions the cbs cone around @xmath5 can be obtained by applying an elaborate ensemble - averaging technique in order to suppress the dominant mesoscopic fluctuations . the averaging techniques employed to get the cone include spot variation,@xcite tilt angle variation,@xcite and sample spin - rotation.@xcite all the above experimental studies@xmath1 were performed on completely disordered , isotropic and homogeneous media .",
    "photonic crystals have recently attracted a lot of attention@xcite because of potential optical device applications .",
    "these applications pertain to photonic crystals with _",
    "complete _ band gaps _",
    "i.e. _ with no propagating solutions of the maxwell equations within a certain frequency range",
    ". however , most of the available three dimensional photonic crystals nowadays have _",
    "incomplete _ gaps in their photonic band structure , with light propagation forbidden only along certain directions . along these directions and for frequencies within the gap the light intensity decays with a certain decrement @xmath11-that is the bragg attenuation length . in the ideal case ( when disorder is negligibly small ) the length @xmath11 can be extracted from spectroscopic reflectivity measurements .",
    "since @xmath11 is directly related to the gap width , then its value can be deduced from the angular ( or spectral ) width of the bragg peak in reflectivity . however , in the more realistic situation disorder is present in the sample and this broadens the bragg band .",
    "we also note that even if @xmath12 broadening can be substantial due to the sensitivity of the bragg diffraction to the properties of the surface boundary . under these conditions",
    "a separate determination of @xmath11 and @xmath2 is a challenge .    in general , despite the conceptual elegance of the cbs technique ,",
    "the main quantitative information it has provided@xmath13 so far is @xmath2 value in _ macroscopically homogeneous _ and isotropic disordered media .",
    "we note that @xmath2 value in such media can be also determined from more conventional measurements of the transmission versus thickness@xcite that do not rely on the interference of clockwise and anticlockwise scattering paths .    in the present work",
    "we show that for optically _ periodic _ structures _ with disorder _ the cbs measurements provide a unique opportunity to separate the two effects , namely bragg attenuation and light diffusion lengths .",
    "this reveals the tremendous potential of the cbs technique as compared to the more conventional optical spectroscopies .",
    "for our studies of periodic structures we have chosen the synthetic @xmath14 opals that are actually three - dimensional photonic crystals.@xcite the synthetic opal single crystals were fabricated from a colloidal suspension of mono - dispersed silica ( @xmath14 ) spheres with a mean diameter , @xmath15=@xmath16 and dispersion in @xmath15 of about @xmath17 .",

    "a sintering process leads to the formation of inter - sphere necks that mechanically connect neighboring silica spheres in a face - centered - cubic ( fcc ) lattice .",
    "the opals with air - filled voids are chalk - like diffuse light scatterers that show some iridescence due to bragg diffraction from their crystal planes .",
    "the iridescence is dramatically enhanced , however if the voids are filled with an index matching liquid .",

    "a possible model is given in the next section .",
    "the bragg - related anomalies of the cbs cones show that light transport and localization is substantially affected by the @xmath30 $ ] photonic band gap in the opal , where light becomes more localized . to understand these results we first recall the most transparent derivation of the cbs cones in the literature and apply it to laser frequencies outside the photonic gap.@xcite",

    "( [ alpha ] ) contains only a single free parameter , namely @xmath2 .",
    "we used eq .",
    "( [ alpha ] ) to fit the cbs cones in @xmath99 at various @xmath39 outside the anomaly angle interval @xmath45 around @xmath100 .",
    "the excellent fits shown in fig .",
    "1 for @xmath101 and @xmath102 were obtained with a single @xmath103 . from this value for the optical mean - free - path length and eq .",
    "( [ alpha ] ) , we calculated the width of the albedo for the cbs cone at quarter maximum , @xmath8 , versus @xmath39 , as shown in fig .",
    "2 . except near @xmath104 the overall agreement between the calculated and the experimentally determined @xmath8 is excellent showing that light transport is quite ordinary for frequencies outside the photonic gap .    for describing the cbs process at @xmath65 and",
    "correspondingly at @xmath105 we note that the diffusive propagation of light between the first and last scattering events that is given by @xmath86 in eq .",
    "( [ albedo ] ) is affected very little by the bragg diffraction .",
    "the reason for this is the small angle interval , @xmath106 , around @xmath104 where bragg condition is satisfied .",
    "an upper bound estimate for @xmath106 can be obtained by relating it to the spectral width of the bragg gap @xmath107 , where @xmath108 .",
    "if we choose for @xmath109 the measured value of the reflectivity peak @xmath110 , then for @xmath111 and @xmath112 we calculate @xmath113 to be @xmath114  radian .",
    "this forms a stereo - angle of about @xmath115 stereo - radian around the bragg direction that is only about @xmath116 of the complete @xmath117 stereo - angle .",
    "therefore , even if the light beam is incident at @xmath100 , it is diverted after the first scattering event and is then followed by an almost regular diffusion ; this is true since the probability for light to propagate close to @xmath104 again is very small .",
    "this permits the generalization of the cbs theory to photonic crystals with relatively small stop bands , simply by only modifying the probability densities @xmath83 and @xmath84 in eq .",
    "( [ albedo ] ) . for @xmath65 ,",
    "light intensity decays as @xmath118 due to the bragg diffraction from the photonic crystal planes .",
    "therefore @xmath83 can be written at @xmath100 as a product of the surviving probabilities : @xmath119 and the bragg attenuation , @xmath118 .",
    "equivalently , we may represent @xmath120 at @xmath100 as a single exponent , @xmath121 , where @xmath122 .",
    "this expression shows that eq .",
    "( [ alpha ] ) describing the cbs cone is still valid at @xmath63 , but with a smaller effective mean - free - path , @xmath123 . a smaller @xmath123 leads to a broader cbs cone at @xmath63 , as indeed seen in fig . 2 for @xmath124 .",
    "if @xmath39 and @xmath67 are close , but not equal to @xmath104 , then the bragg attenuation becomes weaker .",
    "it can be shown that this effect is taken into account by the following modification of @xmath125 @xmath126^{1/2}.\\ ] ] since the argument under the square root in eq .",
    "( [ eff ] ) must be positive , we use this constraint to estimate the angle interval @xmath45 around @xmath104 where the cbs anomalies due to the photonic crystal are observed .",
    "this leads to the expression : @xmath127 .",
    "2 shows that an excellent fit is obtained for both @xmath8 enhancement and @xmath45 , using eqs .",
    "( [ alpha ] ) and ( [ eff ] ) with @xmath128 and the previously obtained @xmath103 . using these values of @xmath2 and @xmath11 along",
    "@xmath30 $ ] we evaluated @xmath129 , which agrees well with the data of fig .",
    "we also calculated the `` pure '' bragg band @xmath107 to be @xmath130 .",
    "we note , that this value is 3 times smaller than @xmath131 extracted from the bragg reflectivity band in fig .",
    "3 . this illustrates the ambiguity in determining the photonic band structure form the more conventional reflectivity spectroscopy .    for @xmath132",
    "_ i.e. _ close to normal incidence and @xmath133 , eq .",
    "( [ eff ] ) is no longer valid , since @xmath134 . in this case",
    "it can be shown that the expression for the effective light mean - free - path is given by @xmath135^{1/2}.\\ ] ] again the constraint that the argument under the square root is positive now yields @xmath136 .",
    "this value is much larger than the obtained @xmath129 for @xmath44 .",
    "however this much larger value is consistent with our measurements at @xmath137 ( fig .",
    "4 ) . moreover , from eq .",
    "( [ eff1 ] ) we calculated theoretical curve @xmath8 @xmath138 shown in fig .",
    "4 . this curve fits very well the width enhancement of the cbs cone at @xmath53 , when @xmath39 is changed for a fixed @xmath10 ( fig . 4 for @xmath139 ) .",
    "( [ eff1 ] ) is also consistent with the obtained results when @xmath10 is changed for a fixed @xmath140 ( fig",
    ". 4 inset ) .",
    "the agreements obtained validate both our modified cbs model and the extracted optical parameters for the opal photonic crystal .",
    "we again emphasize that consistent values of @xmath11 were inferred from both the magnitude @xmath48 @xmath141 and the width @xmath142 of the cbs anomaly .",
    "the widths of cbs cones from @xmath143 planes measured with @xmath144 are shown in fig .",
    "5 , where @xmath8 is plotted versus the incident angle @xmath39 measured from @xmath31 $ ] direction . for @xmath144 the bragg cbs anomaly in @xmath8 occurs at @xmath145 , and is clearly seen in fig .",
    "5 . fitting this cbs anomaly in a similar way as that at @xmath146 in fig .",
    "2 , we deduced a bragg length , @xmath147 for the photonic gap in @xmath31 $ ] direction . in our fitting",
    "we used the value of mean - free - path , @xmath148 that was extracted from the widths of the cbs cones for incident light beams close to the normal direction to the @xmath143 planes .",
    "we note that , in addition to @xmath11 along @xmath31 $ ] , @xmath2 is also different from that extracted before from measurements along @xmath30 $ ] .",
    "apart from the bragg - related anomalies we note that three _ qualitative _ features of the data presented above indicate that the description of cbs from opal photonic crystal within the conventional model of a medium with randomly positioned point - like scatterers is not completely adequate .",
    "these features are :    ( _ i _ ) the rayleigh scattering law @xmath149 that is characterisitc for point - like scatterers does not hold in opals .",
    "this fact becomes evident from fig .",
    "4 inset ; except for a narrow @xmath10 interval near @xmath150 , the cbs cone width @xmath8 remains approximately unchanged with @xmath10 for @xmath10 interval between @xmath151 to @xmath152 .",
    "( _ ii _ ) the value of @xmath153 for @xmath30 $ ] direction appreciably exceeds @xmath154 for @xmath31 $ ] direction .    ( _ iii _ )",
    "the cone width @xmath8 increases with @xmath39 for cbs along @xmath30 $ ] ( fig .",
    "2 ) but shows no dependence on @xmath39 for cbs along @xmath31 $ ] ( fig . 5 ) .",
    "the question that we would like to address here is whether these cbs features can help in pinpointing the size , shape , and orientation of the generic defect scatterers in opal .",
    "firstly , independence of @xmath2 on @xmath10 suggests that the size of the defects is larger than @xmath10 . on the other hand , defects with size @xmath155 scatter most of the light in the forward direction .",
    "more precisely , the scattered light intensity is restricted to a cone with aperture @xmath156 . as a direct consequence of this almost forward scattering",
    ", we should have @xmath157 , where @xmath158 is the _ transport _ mean - free - path that determines the diffusion coefficient ( @xmath159 ) in this case .",
    "the conclusion that @xmath158 is much bigger than @xmath2 in opal has some dramatic consequencies . as can be seen from the general expression for the coherent albedo [ eq .",
    "( [ albedo ] ) ] , the dependence @xmath99 is determined by two factors : the surviving probabilities @xmath160 , @xmath161 and the propagator @xmath88 . for point - like",
    "scatterers both ingredients change within the same characteristic spatial scale , namely @xmath2 . however if @xmath157 , then the scale of the propagator that describes the diffusion process is @xmath158 , whereas the scale of @xmath160 , @xmath161 is still @xmath2 .",
    "this would make the cone width @xmath162 rather than @xmath163 as in the usual case .",
    "consequently @xmath8 would be _ independent _ of the incident angle @xmath39 , and , correspondigly insensitive to the bragg anomaly , contrary to the data .",
    "a possible resolution of this apparent contradiction with the experiment that we can suggest here is to assume that the scatterers are _ highly anisotropic _",
    ", such as disk - like with radius @xmath164 and thickness @xmath165",
    ". moreover , in order to insure that cbs is different from the @xmath50 and @xmath143 opal surfaces as found experimentally , we have to assume that the disks are not oriented randomly , but rather their orientation is correlated .",
    "although we did not extend the quantitative theory of cbs to this situation , intuitively it seems likely that the disks normals be parallel to the @xmath30 $ ] direction .",
    "for such an orientation the light would diffuse easier _ along _ the @xmath50 planes . under these conditions of strongly anisotropic diffusion , longer paths do not necessarily lead to narrower cones as in the case of isotropic scatterers . since cbs is essentially the `` structure factor '' of the propagation _ along the boundary_,@xcite then the easier diffusion along @xmath50 would lead to narrower cones , _",
    "i.e. _ to @xmath166 } < \\delta\\theta_{\\left[220\\right]}$ ] , in agreement with the experimental results ( figs .  2 and 5 ) .",
    "a possible realization of the geometry and arrangement of scatterers as conjectured above can be provided by stalking faults defects .",
    "such defects can be easily created along the @xmath30 $ ] opal fastest growing direction . also , this type of defects has been recently shown to dominate disorder in colloidal crystals,@xcite and we note that synthetic opals grow from silica colloids .",
    "in conclusion , we have demonstrated that cbs is a powerful technique for investigating photonic crystals with incomplete photonic band gaps .",
    "these measurements show that the remarkable universality of cbs characteristics for diverse disordered materials is not valid for photonic crystals at near bragg conditions . using the major effects on light transport near bragg conditions and their influence on cbs cones , we deduce the values of several fundamental parameters of an opal photonic crystal .",
    "remarkably , despite the existence of substantial scattering due to disorder , nevertheless we showed in this work that the bragg attenuation length and , thus the photonic band gap width of an `` ideal '' crystal along @xmath30 $ ] , as well as light mean - free - path can be readily extracted from the cbs measurements , even if they are comparable in magnitude ( unlike the situation in ref . ) .",
    "the reason why for @xmath167 disorder is unable to completely mask the contribution of bragg scattering to the cbs inside the photonic crystal , is that at bragg conditions the cbs involves @xmath168 light propagation _ before the first _ and _ after the last _ scattering events , when the existing disorder is _ not yet relevant_. this makes the cbs measurements a much more sensitive tool for characterizing the inherent band gap features for disordered photonic crystals as compared to the more conventional measurements of optical reflectivity .    the only other study of cbs from photonic crystals that we know of was recently reported in ref . .",
    "the cbs measurements in that work were performed on photonic crystals based on polystyrene spheres and also on crystals composed of air spheres in a @xmath169 matrix .",
    "in contrast to the present study that has been performed on a _ single _ opal sample where the stop - band was `` swept '' by changing the angle of incindence , @xmath39 ; in ref .",
    ", on the contrary the incident angle was kept close to normal . under this condition , in order to explore the cbs within the stop - band frequency range in the polystyrene opals , the authors measured cbs on a _ set _ of samples with different sphere diameters using three different wavelenghts for the incident light beam . also the band edge frequencies were determined from _ reflectivity _ measurements , rather than by cbs as in our work . even under these assumptions , the authors failed to measure cbs cones _ inside _ the stop - band.@xcite    for air - sphere @xmath169 crystal , however , the authors@xcite used a setup allowing continuous tuning of @xmath10 .",
    "they observed that between the red and blue edges of the stop - band , @xmath8 _ decreases _ by a factor of @xmath170 .",
    "this observation , which actually contradicts our own study , was explained on the basis of a previous theoretical work.@xcite it was claimed that for light frequencies above the lower band - edge the electromagnetic wave , in course of the diffusion process , can occasionally `` hit '' the boundary interface at the bragg angle @xmath63 ; thus rather than exiting the sample , it experiences instead the bragg diffraction to the interior . as a result of such events",
    "the diffusive trajectories become longer ( on average ) leading to the narrowing of the cbs cone .    in light of the cbs model that was outlined in section iii",
    ", the above explanation corresponds to the modification of the propagator @xmath86 in eq .",
    "( [ albedo ] ) .",
    "in contrast , our analysis suggests that @xmath88 is not appreciably affected by the bragg conditions , whereas the prime effect of the photonic band structure is the modification of the surviving probability densities @xmath83 and @xmath171 in eq .",
    "( [ albedo ] ) . the apparent contradiction between our results and those of ref .",
    "can be probably accounted for by the difference in the `` strenghts''of the bragg diffraction process , or @xmath11 in synthetic @xmath14 opals and air - sphere crystals in @xmath169 .",
