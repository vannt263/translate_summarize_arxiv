    "moreover , we use a classical potential model , i.e. a kind of action at a distance , to derive the total energy density and thus the equation of state . in this non - relativistic model , @xmath114 may only measure the stiffness of equation of state , and the real sound speed is too difficult to calculate . from the picture of the mechanism for interaction in our model ,",
    "the interaction is mediated by mesons , so the real speed of interaction is obviously smaller than the speed of light , i.e. , the signal propagation speed remains subluminal .",
    "our equation of state is very stiff because of two main reasons .",
    "firstly , quark - clusters are non - relativistic particles . for the system composed of non - relativistic particles , ignoring the interaction , the momentum of each particle",
    "could be approximated as @xmath116 ( from heisenberg s relation ) , and the total energy density @xmath117 .",
    "the kinetic energy per particle @xmath118 , and then the kinetic energy density @xmath119 , so pressure @xmath120 . on the other hand , for extremely relativistic particles , from the same estimation , @xmath121 .",
    "therefore , the equation of state of non - relativistic system is stiffer than that of relativistic one .",
    "secondly , each quark - cluster is trapped inside the potential well formed by the neighboring quark - clusters , and the in - medium stiffening effect makes the shape of potential well to be stiffer . from the above arguments , our model is different from the mainstream that quark stars , composed of relativistic and weakly interacting quarks , are characterized by soft equation of state .",
    "phenomenologically , a corresponding - state approach to quark - cluster matter  @xcite also results in a very stiff equation of state .      at the highest density of the stars , with @xmath122 ,",
    "the distance between two nearby @xmath0-clusters is about 1.1 fm .",
    "the size of @xmath0-dibaryons could be a little larger than that of nucleons , and then at the center of the star they could be so crowded that they touch the nearby ones , but they should be safe against being crushed .",
    "we assume that the touch of nearby @xmath0-clusters does not influence our overall picture , since it only happens at the very center of the star and the degree of touch is not high to cause dissociation .",
    "in fact , the dependence of binding energy of quark - clusters on density is still unknown . however , if the mass of @xmath0-dibaryons decreases with increasing densities like baryons and mesons , this could be equivalent to the increasing of binding energy of @xmath0-dibaryons . at densities beyond @xmath3 ,",
    "the degrees of freedom become complex due to the non - perturbative nature of qcd , which could be responsible to the different binding behavior to the case at densities below @xmath3 .    conventional strange quark matter",
    "( without quark - clustering ) is thought to be stable in bulk but unstable in the case of light strangelets when the baryon number @xmath123 is as small as 6  ( see a review in * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "although quark - clusters are similar to light strangelets , they could still be stable as they are in medium but not in vacuum .",
    "the highly dense environment makes the energy per baryon of @xmath0-clusters to be lower than that of neutron and nucleon matter , as has shown above . as a kind of light strangelets , @xmath0-dibaryons are unstable in vacuum , which make it difficult to study them experimentally ; however , inside compact stars , the in - medium effect could stabilize them .",
    "it is worth noting that , although composed of @xmath0-clusters , @xmath0-cluster stars are self - bound .",
    "they are bound by the interaction between quark - clusters ( the @xmath0-clusters here ) .",
    "this is different from but similar to the traditional mit bag scenario .",
    "the interaction between @xmath0-clusters could be strong enough to bind the star , and on the surface , the quark - clusters are just in the potential well of the interaction , leading to non - vanishing density but vanishing pressure .",
    "it is surely possible that there could be normal matter surrounding a self - bound @xmath0-cluster star , but initially the surroundings would not remain because of energetic exploding  @xcite .",
    "quark - clusters could emerge in cold dense matter because of the strong coupling between quarks .",
    "the quark - clustering phase has high density and the strong interaction is still dominant , so it is different from the usual hadron phase . on the other hand ,",
    "the quark - clustering phase is also different from the conventional quark matter phase which is composed of relativistic and weakly interacting quarks .",
    "the quark - clustering phase could be considered as an intermediate state between hadron phase and free - quark phase , with deconfined quarks grouped into quark - clusters , and that is another reason why we take quark - cluster stars as a special kind of quark stars .",
    "@xmath0-cluster stars are self - bound due to the interaction between clusters , with non - vanishing surface density but vanishing surface pressure . whether the chiral symmetry broken and confinement phase transition happen simultaneously inside compact stars is a matter of debate  ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) , but here we assume that the chiral symmetry is broken in quark - clustering phase .",
    "it is well know that there is an asymmetry term to account for the observed tendency to have equal numbers of protons ( @xmath124 ) and neutrons ( @xmath125 ) in the liquid drop model of the nucleus .",
    "this nuclear symmetry energy ( or the isospin one ) represents a symmetry between proton and neutron in the nucleon degree of freedom , and is actually that of up and down quarks in the quark degree  @xcite .",
    "the possibility of electrons inside a nucleus is negligible because its radius is much smaller than the compton wavelength @xmath126 .",
    "the lepton degree of freedom would then be not significant for nucleus , but what if the nuclear radius becomes larger and larger ( even @xmath127 ) ?    electrons are inside a large or gigantic nucleus , which is the case of compact stars .",
    "now there is a competition : isospin symmetry favors @xmath128 while lepton chemical equilibrium tends to have @xmath129 . the nuclear symmetry energy @xmath130 mev ( at saturated nuclear matter density @xmath3 ) , where @xmath131 , could be around 30 mev per baryon if @xmath132 .",
    "interesting , the kinematic energy of an electron is @xmath133 mev if the isospin symmetry holds in nuclear matter .",
    "however , the situation becomes different if strangeness is included : no electrons exist if the matter is composed by equal numbers of light quarks of @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 with chemical equilibrium . in this case , the 3-flavor symmetry , an analogy of the symmetry of @xmath5 and @xmath6 in nucleus , may result in a ground state of matter for gigantic nuclei .",
    "certainly the mass different between @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 quarks would also break the symmetry , but the interaction between quarks could lower the effect of mass differences and try to restore the symmetry . although it is hard for us to calculate how strong the interaction between quarks is , the non - perturbative nature and the energy scale of the system make it reasonable to assume that the degree of the light flavor symmetry breaking is small , and there is a few electrons ( with energy @xmath134 mev ) .",
    "heavy flavors of quarks ( @xmath135 , @xmath136 and @xmath137 ) could not be existed if cold matter is at only a few nuclear densities .",
    "the above argument could be considered as an extension of the bodmer - witten s conjecture .",
    "possibly it does nt matter whether three flavors of quarks are free or bound .",
    "we may thus re - define _ strange matter _ as cold dense matter with light flavor symmetry of three flavors of @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 quarks .",
    "we propose in this paper that the strong interaction between quarks inside compact stars renders quarks grouped into a special kind of quark - clusters , @xmath0-clusters , leading the formation of @xmath0-cluster stars .",
    "although there are many uncertainties about the stability of @xmath0-cluster matter , it could be possible that at high densities @xmath0-cluster matter is stable against transforming to nucleon matter .",
    "the equation of state of @xmath0-cluster stars is derived by assuming the yukawa form of @xmath0-@xmath0 interaction under meson - exchanges , and the in - medium effect from brown - rho scaling law of meson - masses is also taken into account .",
    "@xmath0-cluster stars could have stiff equation of state , and under a wide range of parameter - space , the maximum mass of @xmath0-cluster stars can be well above 2@xmath2 . furthermore",
    ", if we know about the properties of pulsars from observations , we can get information on @xmath0-@xmath0 interaction ; for example , if a pulsar with mass larger than @xmath138 is discovered , then we can constrain the coefficient of brown - rho scaling @xmath110 .",
    "although the state of cold quark matter at a few nuclear densities is still an unsolved problem in low energy qcd , various pulsar phenomena would give us some hints about the properties of elemental strong interaction  @xcite , complementary to the terrestrial experiments .",
    "pulsar - like compact stars provide high density and relatively low temperature conditions where quark matter with @xmath0-clusters could exist .",
    "@xmath0-cluster has been the subject of many theoretical and experimental studies .",
    "it is in controversy that whether @xmath0-cluster is a bound state , which depends on the quark - masses  @xcite , and the binding behavior at high densities is still unknown .",
    "whether quark matter composed of @xmath0-clusters could achieve at supra - nuclear density is still uncertain , and on the other hand , the nature of pulsar - like stars also depends on the physics of dense matter .",
    "these problems are essentially related to the non - perturbative qcd , and we hope that future astrophysical observations would test the existence of @xmath0-cluster stars .    finally , we would clarify two questions and answers , which should be beneficial to make sense about the conclusions presented in this paper .",
    "( 1 ) _ why does not an @xmath0-particle on the surface decay into nucleons ?",
    "_ the reason could be similar to that why a neutron does not decay into proton in a stable nucleus .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that significant gravitational energy would be released if neutrons are concentrated in the core of a star , it is now recognized , however , that fundamental color interaction is more effective and stronger than gravity to confine nucleons .",
    "the equality condition of chemical potentials at the boundary between two phases applies for gravity - confined stars  @xcite , but may not for self - bound objects by strong interaction .",
    "( 2 ) _ why can hardly normal matter be converted into more stable @xmath0-cluster matter in reality ?",
    "_ we know @xmath139fe is most stable nucleus , but it needs substantial thermal kinematic energy to make nuclear fusion of light nuclei in order to penetrate the coulomb barrier .",
    "strong gravity of an evolved massive star dominates the electromagnetic force , compressing baryonic matter into quark - cluster matter in astrophysics .",
    "this is expensive and rare .",
