    "it has been known for some time now that supersymmetric [ susy ] grand unified theories [ guts]@xcite    @xmath1 suppress the non - susy gut prediction for proton decay , via heavy gauge boson exchange , by increasing the gut scale , and    @xmath1 lead to a 10% increase ( for one pair of higgs doublets ) in the gut prediction for the weak mixing angle , @xmath2 , compared to non - susy guts .",
    "now , since @xmath2 is known to better than 1% accuracy , one naturally uses the values of the two low energy parameters , the fine structure constant , @xmath3 , and @xmath2 as input to determine the gut coupling , @xmath4 , and the gut scale , @xmath5 , and predicts the value of the strong coupling , @xmath6 .",
    "[ note , all low energy parameters are typically evaluated at the scale , @xmath7 . ]",
    "this prediction is in excellent agreement with the low energy data@xcite .",
    "the global fit to @xmath6 from measurements at all energies@xcite gives @xmath8 with low ( high ) energy measurements favoring values of @xmath9 .",
    "a global fit to all electroweak data@xcite gives @xmath10 . in comparison , susy guts predict@xcite @xmath11 , where the first error is the uncertainty in the low energy sparticle spectrum , and the second , the top and higgs masses .",
    "note that the non - supersymmetric gut prediction@xcite @xmath12 is clearly ruled out .",
    "in addition , susy guts contain new sources of proton decay ( dimension 5 operators ) mediated by color triplet higgs fermions@xcite .",
    "they typically lead to the dominant decay mode @xmath13 with the lifetime , @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is an effective color triplet mass .",
    "these results are valid for any grand unified symmetry group , as long as su(3)@xmath16 su(2)@xmath16 u(1 ) is embedded in an unbroken simple subgroup above the gut scale .",
    "consideration of fermion masses , however , leads us to the special grand unified symmetry group so(10)@xcite .",
    "it is the unique group which combines all the fermions of one family \\{u , d , e , @xmath17 } into one irreducible 16 dimensional representation with the addition of only one electroweak singlet state , @xmath18 , the so - called right - handed neutrino .",
    "consequently , so(10 ) clebschs can be used to relate all charged fermion mass matrices . in this context , a paper by anderson et al.@xcite[paper i ] showed how all charged fermion masses and mixing angles can be reasonably described in terms of four dominant effective mass operators at @xmath5 .",
    "hall and one of us ( s.r.)@xcite [ paper ii ] then showed how to extend the effective theory at @xmath5 to a complete so(10 ) susy gut valid up to the planck or string scales , @xmath19 .",
    "that theory included several sectors necessary for  ( 1 ) gut symmetry breaking , ( 2 ) doublet - triplet splitting ( higgs sector ) , ( 3 ) charged fermion masses ( fermion mass sector ) and also ( 4 ) giving a large mass to the electroweak singlet neutrinos ( neutrino mass sector ) .",
    "it contained sufficient symmetry to be  natural . \"",
    "hence , it included all operators consistent with the symmetries and only contained the so(10 ) states  @xmath20 with @xmath21 specific integers .",
    "finally , the effective mass operators of paper i were recovered upon integrating out states with mass greater than @xmath5 .    in any complete gut , the prediction for @xmath6 receives corrections at one loop from thresholds at the weak scale , including the sparticle spectrum , and at the gut scale from states with mass of order @xmath5 .",
    "the dominant contribution at @xmath5 comes from states in the symmetry breaking and higgs sectors .",
    "the higgs sector , on the other hand , also affects the proton decay rate .",
    "the effective color triplet higgs fermion mass , @xmath15 , must be significantly larger than @xmath5 in order to increase the proton lifetime .",
    "the higgs doublets on the other hand must remain massless at the gut scale .",
    "in this paper ,    @xmath1 we show that the threshold corrections due to doublet - triplet splitting , in the simplest models , increases the predicted value for @xmath0 .",
    "thus , while the gut predictions for @xmath6 and @xmath22 are unrelated at the tree level , at one loop the two effects are coupled .",
    "one can not suppress proton decay without at the same moment increasing the prediction for @xmath6 .",
    "we then show that the model of paper ii is ruled out by this effect .",
    "@xmath1 we also present a new complete susy gut which appears to be consistent with all low energy data at the @xmath23 level@xcite .",
    "this model has in fact a much simpler gut symmetry breaking sector than that in paper ii with fewer states .",
    "we present some typical results for proton decay rates in this model . in a future paper@xcite",
    ", we will present a more detailed study .",
    "one loop threshold corrections at @xmath5 for gauge couplings are given by@xcite @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the leading log threshold correction to @xmath26 .",

    "we show that these symmetries impose stringent constraints on the form of @xmath38 . in brief , @xmath38 is implicitly a function of the vacuum expectation values [ vevs ] of fields in the symmetry breaking sector .",
    "these vevs transform under the u(1 ) and r symmetries . as a consequence of the invariance",
    ", we find @xmath54 where the first term represents the contributions from @xmath52 .",
    "it is only a function of u(1 ) and r invariant products of powers of vevs \\{@xmath55}. the second term , coming from the higgs sector , is discussed further in the next section and the ellipsis refers to the small additional contribution arising from the fermion mass sector .",
    "note , @xmath56 only include those states , from @xmath57s and @xmath58s of su(5 ) contained in @xmath52 and @xmath53 , _ which mix with the higgs sector _",
    "( see the next section ) .",
    "we assume the higgs sector includes any number of * 10*s with , for simplicity , only one of these , say @xmath59 , coupling to light fermions .",
    "we also include the doublet - triplet splitting mechanism introduced by dimopoulos - wilczek  @xcite .",
    "accordingly , the terms in the superspace potential relevant for doublet - triplet splitting are of the form @xmath60 \\;5_1 - \\bar{5}_1 \\;[a_1 \\,{3 \\over 2}\\;(b~-~l)]\\ ; 5_2 + \\sum_{i , j \\ge 2}m_{ij } \\;\\bar{5}_i\\ ; 5_j \\label{eq : wdt}\\ ] ] where @xmath61 is the vev of the field @xmath62 in the 45 dimensional representation and @xmath63 is the [ baryon - lepton number ] charge matrix ( see eqn .",
    "( [ eq : a1 ] ) ) .",
    "thus , since the doublets in @xmath64 have zero @xmath65 , they remain massless .",
    "[ note , some of the @xmath66 states may come from @xmath67 and @xmath68 representations , respectively , in @xmath52 .",

    "proton decay in this model is mediated by the higgses in @xmath69 .",
    "hence , the coefficient of the resulting effective dimension 5 baryon violating operators@xcite is given by the inverse of the triplet mass matrix in the 11 direction , i.e. @xmath75 \\over { \\det } \\bar m_t } = { { \\det } \\bar m'_d \\over { \\det } \\bar m_t } \\times   g\\ ] ] where @xmath76 \\over { \\det } m[d]}$ ] .",
    "we show , in appendix 2 , that @xmath77 is a holomorphic function of the set of u(1 ) and r invariant products of powers of vevs .",
    "if we now define the effective triplet mass by @xmath78 , we obtain the final form for the factor in eqn .",
    "( [ eq : ep3 ] )  @xmath79 . as a consequence , eqn .",
    "( [ eq : ep3 ] ) becomes @xmath80 where @xmath81 and @xmath82 are absorbed in the function @xmath83 .",

    "was discussed earlier by hisano et al.@xcite . ]      as an example , for the particular model of paper ii , there is only one independent invariant ratio of the gut scale vevs given by @xmath85 . in principle",
    ", @xmath38 could depend on an arbitrary function @xmath86 .",
    "however , when we put the effective determinants for this model in equation  ( [ eq : grandexpression ] ) we find @xmath87 remarkably , all dependence of @xmath38 on the gut scale vevs has dropped out except for the dependence on @xmath88 .",
    "unfortunately , the large positive constant that appears in the expression means that in order to get @xmath38 negative , the proton s lifetime would be many orders of magnitude lower than the experimental bound .",
    "in addition , changing the yukawa coupling coefficients of the terms of @xmath52 can not cure this problem . for the most part , changing the yukawa coupling constants of one of the terms of @xmath52 has the result of multiplying the effective determinants of the mass matrices @xmath89 in eqn .",
    "( [ eq : epsilon ] ) , for states @xmath46 in a complete su(5 ) multiplet , all by the same amount .",
    "thus , this multiplicative factor has no effect on @xmath38 .",
    "hence , as a consequence of ( [ eq : modelii ] ) , we find that the symmetry breaking sector of the model of paper ii is ruled out by the dual constraints coming from the low energy measurement of @xmath6 and the proton lifetime .",
    "is it possible to find a symmetry breaking sector which has all the u(1 ) symmetries required for the naturalness of the theory and is consistent with the constraints of @xmath6 and @xmath22 ? in the next section",
    "we describe a new so(10 ) susy gut which satisfies all our criteria .",
    "in fact it may contain the minimal symmetry breaking sector consistent with the requirements of ( 1 ) obtaining the effective fermion mass operators of paper i , ( 2 )  naturalness , \" and ( 3 ) retaining only those states at energies below @xmath5 , which either have trivial sm charge or are contained in the minimal supersymmetric standard model [ mssm ] .",
    "for this model , @xmath90 where the fields \\{@xmath91 } , \\{@xmath92 } , @xmath93 , \\{@xmath94 } are in the 45 , 54 , 16 , @xmath95 and 1 representations , respectively .",
    "[ note , traces and contractions of indices are implicit . ]",
    "the supersymmetric minimization condition @xmath96 gives four discrete choices for the direction of the vev of @xmath62 .",
    "we will assume that nature chooses the b  -  l direction .",
    "the second term gives @xmath97 a vev in the x direction , @xmath98 a vev in the y direction , and @xmath99 and @xmath100 vevs in the right - handed neutrino - like direction ( see eqn .",
    "( [ eq : a1 ] ) below ) .",
    "the third and fourth terms , and the @xmath101 subterm of the first term , were added to give mass to all non - mssm fields which are not in a singlet representation of the standard model gauge group .",
    "the last term was added in accordance with our  naturalness \" criterion , namely that the theory should be the most general one consistent with the symmetries .",
    "the term @xmath102 is consistent with the u(1 ) and r symmetries of the symmetry breaking sector of the theory that will be discussed below , and we are aware of no other additional symmetry that might exclude this term . therefore the term must be included .",

    "two caveats ",
    "@xmath1 note at tree level the gut symmetry breaking vevs are undetermined since the potential in these directions are both supersymmetric and flat",
    ". we will not discuss the process for fixing these vevs in this paper .",
    "that analysis must necessarily include supersymmetry breaking effects as well as supergravity and radiative corrections .",
    "@xmath1 we do not describe the source of supersymmetry breaking in this paper .",
    "soft susy breaking operators are included at the gut scale and renormalized down to the weak scale when making any comparison with the low energy data .",
    "the same doublet - triplet splitting mechanism that was used in paper ii can be used in this model .",
    "accordingly , the higgs sector of the lagrangian is given by @xmath113 where the first term is @xmath53 and the second generates a @xmath114 term when the f component of the hidden sector field @xmath115 gets a vev of order @xmath116 .",
    "we then obtain @xmath117 .",
    "@xmath118 has a [ u(1)]@xmath119 r symmetry as is summarized in table [ t : u1 ] .",
    "up to arbitrary yukawa coupling coefficients assumed to be of @xmath120 , @xmath118 is the most general superspace potential consistent with these symmetries . using @xmath121 , and @xmath101 as independent variables ,",
    "the only invariant under a [ u(1)]@xmath119r rotation of the vevs is @xmath122 . after evaluating @xmath38 explicitly using equation ( [ eq : grandexpression ] )",
    "we obtain    @xmath123    before we can check whether the experimental measurement of @xmath0 in this model is consistent with the non - observation of proton decay , we must discuss the fermion mass sector of the theory .",
    "the proton lifetime and branching ratios depend crucially on the couplings of the color triplet higgses to fermions . in a theory of fermion masses ,",
    "these couplings are related to the yukawa couplings of fermions to higgs doublets , _ but they are not identical_. for example , the dimension 5 operators responsible for proton decay are given by @xmath124 where @xmath125 and @xmath126 are 3@xmath163 complex matrices .",
    "the matrices @xmath127 and @xmath128 , the up quark yukawa matrix , contain the same independent parameters but the so(10 ) clebschs are different .",
    "an example is presented in the next section .",
    "we take the flavor sector of our model to be that of model 4 in paper i. preliminary results of blazek , carena , wagner and one of us ( s.r.)@xcite suggest that this model provides the best fit to the low energy data .",
    "the flavor sector is specified by a particular set of four operators @xmath129 , @xmath130 .",
    "three of these operators  @xmath131 , and @xmath132  are uniquely specified by choosing model 4 .",
    "on the other hand there are 6 choices for operator @xmath133 , labelled @xmath134 , as all give identical entries in the charged fermion yukawa matrices . as a result",
    "we can construct 6 possible models @xmath135 .",
    "the four effective fermion mass operators for model @xmath136 are given by @xmath137    the superspace potential for the complete theory above the gut scale which reproduces model @xmath136 is given by ( see fig .",
    "1 ) @xmath138    this superpotential is consistent with the symmetries discussed previously with the addition of one new u(1 ) given in table  [ t : u1 ] .",
    "however it is not the most general fermion sector consistent with these symmetries .",
    "in fact _ one and only one _ new operator must be added @xmath139 it is easy to see that this operator leads to one new effective operator at the gut scale when heavy states are integrated out ( see fig .",
    "the new operator is @xmath140 the complete model 4c is thus defined with this new operator and includes the operators in eqn .",
    "( [ eq:4coper ] ) and ( [ eq:13oper ] ) .",
    "a fit of model 4c to the low energy data@xcite for certain ranges of soft susy breaking parameters agrees to better than @xmath23 for all observables . a global @xmath141 analysis of models 4 , 6 ( a - f ) ( paper i ) for all regions of parameter space is now underway@xcite .",
    "it is already clear , however , that an additional operator such as the 13 operator in eqn .",
    "( [ eq:13oper ] ) is absolutely necessary to fit the data .",
    "whether this model fits the data better than any other remains to be seen .",
    "for example , a different choice of 22 operator results in a different u(1 ) symmetry and thus by  naturalness , \" a distinct theory .",
    "in particular , we have checked that for model 4b there are no new effective fermion mass operators generated , while for model 4a the new 13 operator @xmath142 is needed .",
    "finally , consider the matrices relevant for proton decay for the case of model 4c .",
    "in particular , the matrix @xmath127 is given by @xmath143 this should be compared with the up quark yukawa matrix in the same model given by @xmath144 where the 7 yukawa parameters @xmath145 and @xmath146 are obtained by fitting to quark and lepton masses and the ckm mixing angles@xcite .",
    "note that the clebschs in the two matrices differ by as much as a factor of 4 .",
    "these clebschs affect proton decay branching ratios .",
    "it is thus important to calculate the branching ratios in models which are consistent with the observed fermion masses and mixing angles .",
    "the dominant effective operators at the scale @xmath5 are obtained by integrating out states with mass greater than @xmath5 .",
    "higher order corrections to these operators are also obtained .",
    "these typically lead to @xmath147 corrections to the leading terms in the yukawa matrices .",
    "of course the terms in the yukawa matrices will also receive corrections at one loop .",
    "we have neglected these corrections in the following analysis .      for completeness",
    "we include a minimal neutrino mass sector @xmath148 where the states @xmath149 are so(10 ) singlets .",
    "this term has the effect of giving gut scale dirac masses to the right - handed neutrinos in the 16 s .",
    "thus , the sm left - handed neutrinos are absolutely massless in this theory .",
    "if necessary , left - handed neutrinos can be given masses as described in paper ii@xcite .",
    "however , in order to do so we must either break one linear combination of the u(1)s or introduce additional so(10 ) singlets . in either case , we must then check for  naturalness \" and add any operator allowed by the symmetries of the theory .",
    "this theory has 5 global u(1 ) symmetries and a global continuous r symmetry .",
    "the charges of most of the states are given in table [ t : u1 ] .",
    "the charges of the other states can easily be derived .",
    "we have checked our theory for  naturalness . \"",
    "we find that only 3 additional operators need to be added to the superpotential @xmath150 these three operators have no direct effect on any observable properties since the vev of @xmath151 vanishes . with the inclusion of these three operators",
    "the total superspace potential for model 4c is  natural \" ( i.e. no additional operators consistent with these symmetries are allowed ) _ for all possible powers of the fields_. in addition the theory has a matter reflection symmetry ( see dimopoulos and georgi , ref .",

    "some problems , however , remain to be solved in our model . given the states and symmetries , we find that @xmath152 , the coefficient of the general gauge kinetic term , is trivial in this model .",
    "thus we have not explicitly included the sector of the theory which generates gaugino masses once susy is broken .",
    "in addition , the u(1 ) symmetries of the theory are not sufficient to significantly constrain the kahler potential .",
    "for example , terms such as @xmath153 are allowed which mix light generations with heavy states . this term ( and others like it )",
    "is allowed since it already appears in the structure of the feynman diagrams of fig .",

    "is it natural to have such light higgs doublets ? are we populating the gut desert ?",
    "to address this question we should compare the higgs doublet mass with the spectrum of masses for states in the symmetry breaking sector of the theory .",

    "( [ eq : epsilon ] ) readily follows .          1 .   the effective determinants of mass matrices are holomorphic functions of the symmetry breaking vevs , and 2 .",
    "the effective determinants have simple phase rotations under u(1 ) and r symmetry transformations .",
    "we first discuss the case for mass matrices which do _ not _ include vector multiplets , followed immediately by the case for mass matrices including vector multiplets .",
    "note , in the first case the mass matrices themselves are , by construction , holomorphic functions of vevs .",
    "this is however not true for the latter case which is why it requires a separate discussion .",
    "consider a general superspace potential @xmath209 whose superfields rotate under a u(1 ) symmetry as @xmath210 by defining the shifted fields @xmath211 and expanding the superspace potential about @xmath212 we can find the fermion mass matrices . @xmath213",
    "now consider what would happen if the superfields received a different vacuum expectation value , @xmath214 under this change , the mass matrices would change .",
    "@xmath215 where @xmath216 however , if we rotate the shifted fields @xmath217 by @xmath218 , the superspace potential will be invariant under the combined rotation of @xmath219 and @xmath220 .",
    "@xmath221 therefore , @xmath222 rotates in a very simple way .",
    "@xmath223 thus , @xmath224 where the sum is over all fields that have columns in the mass matrix .    similar arguments can show that under an r symmetry rotation , @xmath225 , @xmath222 is equal to @xmath226 where @xmath227 is the charge of the superspace potential under the r symmetry",
    ". therefore , @xmath228 where @xmath229 .",
    "the situation is a bit more complicated for mass matrices which receive contributions from vector multiplets .",
    "the proof that the determinants and hence the effective determinants have simple phase rotations under the u(1 ) and r symmetry transformations can readily be extended to these mass matrices .",
    "however , since the entries in the gaugino - chiral fermion mixing rows are actually the complex conjugates of vevs , the determinants of these matrices are not holomorphic . however , in the following we prove that the _ effective determinants _ of these mass matrices , which include vector multiplets , _ are _ in fact holomorphic functions of the vevs .",
    "since the would - be goldstone fermion states are perpendicular to the massive chiral fermion states , any mass matrix containing gaugino - chiral fermion mixing can be written in the form @xmath230 with @xmath231 , @xmath232 and the @xmath199s , @xmath233s , and @xmath234s are functions of the vevs but not of their conjugates . the rows and columns of the mass matrix can be rearranged so that @xmath235 and @xmath236 are not zero .",
    "however , the determinant of this matrix can be reduced by elementary row and column operations .",
    "namely , by adding to the last column the second column multiplied by @xmath237 plus the third column multiplied by @xmath238 , and so forth , the determinant of the mass matrix becomes @xmath239 doing the analogous operation on the rows , the determinant becomes @xmath240 thus , the determinant is equal to @xmath241 where @xmath81 is a holomorphic function of the vevs . by setting @xmath242 , @xmath243 will equal @xmath244 and the mass of the vector multiplet is @xmath245 . therefore , the determinant is equal to @xmath246 times @xmath81 and the effective determinant is just the function @xmath81 .",
    "note , @xmath247 is thus always canceled from the denominator of the effective determinant ( eqn .",
    "[ eq : epsilon ] ) and no conjugates of vevs can appear in the effective determinant .",
    "thus , the effective determinants for mass matrices containing gauginos are holomorphic functions of the vevs ; just as those discussed earlier for mass matrices which do not have gaugino - chiral fermion mixing entries .",
    "these simple transformation properties of the mass matrices , under u(1 ) rotations of the vevs , have significant consequences for the form of @xmath248 .",
    "consider the following expression entering @xmath248 ( see eqn .",
    "[ eq : grandexpression ] )  @xmath249 @xmath250 it is now easy to show that it is invariant under the u(1 ) and r symmetries .",
    "namely , the u(1 ) charge of the determinant of @xmath251 ( eqn . [ eq : u1charge ] ) is equal to the charge of the determinant of @xmath252 which is equal to -2 times the sum of u(1 ) charges of all fields in the 24 representation of su(5 ) .",
    "therefore , the u(1 ) rotation of @xmath253 will cancel the rotation of @xmath254 in expression , eqn .",
    "( [ grandexpression ] ) .",
    "in addition , we note that the u(1 ) charges of the effective determinants of \\{@xmath255 , @xmath256 } , \\{@xmath257 , @xmath258 } , and @xmath259 equal -1 times the sum of u(1 ) charges of all fields in the \\{15 and @xmath260 } ; \\{10 and @xmath261 } , and \\{10 , 15 , @xmath261 and @xmath260 } representations of su(5 ) , respectively",
    ". therefore , the u(1 ) rotation of @xmath262 is canceled by the rotations of the effective determinants of @xmath263 and @xmath256 in expression , eqn .",
    "( [ grandexpression ] ) .",
    "similar arguments show that the expression in eqn .",
    "( [ grandexpression ] ) is invariant under an r symmetry rotation .",
    "thus finally we arrive at the conclusion that the expression in eqn .",
    "( [ grandexpression ] ) is invariant under the u(1 ) and r symmetries of @xmath264 for any superspace potential built with 1 , 10 , 16 , @xmath68 , 45 , and 54 representations of so(10 ) .",
    "moreover , since expression , eqn .",
    "( [ grandexpression ] ) , is holomorphic , the contribution of the gut symmetry breaking sector to @xmath38 is only a function of u(1 ) and r invariant products of powers of vevs .",
    "the same is not true for the contributions from either the higgs or fermion mass sectors .",
    "this is because both the higgs and fermion mass sectors contain massless states that must be projected out of the mass matrices before the effective determinants are taken .",
    "after this projection , the determinants of the resulting mass matrices are no longer holomorphic functions of the vevs .",
    "nevertheless for the higgs sector we can prove a similar but limited result , namely , that @xmath265 \\over { \\det } m[d ] } = g(\\zeta_1 , \\cdots , \\zeta_m)$ ] ; i.e. , @xmath82 is a function of u(1 ) invariants only . by eqns .",
    "( [ eq : u1charge ] ) and ( [ eq : rcharge ] ) , we see that @xmath266 $ ] and @xmath267 $ ] transform in the same way under the u(1 ) and r symmetries ; therefore the ratio is invariant .",
