    "the standard approach to cosmological modelling commences with the assumption that our @xmath1dimensional space is homogeneous and isotropic at large scales .",

    "a third assumption in this approach is that the large scale structure of the universe is essentially determined by gravitational interactions , and hence can be described by a metrical theory of gravitation such as general relativity ( gr ) , which we assume in this work .    under these very general premises , the total density @xmath10 and the total pressure @xmath11 of the cosmological fluid as a function of scale factor @xmath12",

    "note that if now one wishes to constrain the physical properties that hold for the matter fields in the universe it is convenient to impose the so - called _ energy conditions _",
    "@xcite that limit the arbitrariness of the energy - momentum tensor @xmath0 of these fields or , equivalently , of the physical behavior of their associated energy density @xmath10 and pressure @xmath11 .",
    "these conditions can be stated in a coordinate - invariant way , in terms of @xmath0 and vector fields of fixed character ( timelike , null and spacelike ) .",
    "the most common energy conditions are is perhaps the best known example of matter fields that violates the strong energy condition , but fulfills the weak energy condition ( @xmath15 and @xmath16 ) .",
    "see , e.g. @xcite for a short historical review . ] :    * the null energy condition ( nec ) .",
    "nec states that @xmath17 for null vectors @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is a real 4-dimensional space - time manifold and @xmath20 denotes the tangent space to @xmath19 at a point @xmath21 .",
    "* the weak energy condition ( wec ) .",
    "wec states that @xmath22 for any timelike vector @xmath23 .",
    "this will also imply , by continuity , the nec . *",
    "the strong energy condition ( sec ) .",
    "sec is the assertion that for any timelike vector @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the trace of @xmath0 . * the dominant energy condition ( dec ) .",
    "dec requires that @xmath22 for any timelike vector @xmath23 and the additional requirement that @xmath26 be a non - spacelike vector . by continuity",
    "this will also hold for any null vector @xmath18 .    in terms of the energy - momentum tensor for a perfect fluid , @xmath27",
    ", the above conditions ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) reduce to @xmath28 where the nec restriction ( @xmath29 ) has been incorporated by the wec .",
    "thus , from equations ( [ rho - eq])([p - eq ] ) one can easily rewrite the energy conditions as a set of dynamical constraints involving the scale factor @xmath8 and its derivatives for any spatial curvature , i.e. , @xmath30 \\leq   \\frac{\\ddot{a}}{a }   \\leq   \\frac{\\dot{a}^2}{a^2}+\\frac{k}{a^2 }   \\label{dec - eq}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] clearly , in a expanding flrw universe the sec implies that the expansion of the universe is decelerating irrespective of the sign of the spatial curvature . furthermore , since most of the ordinary forms of matter obey the dec they inevitably fulfill the less restrictive wec",
    ". however , violation of the dec does not necessarily implies violation of wec or even of the sec .    in this",
    "_ brief report _ , to shed some light on the energy conditions interrelations from an observational viewpoint , we use the above dynamical formulation of the energy conditions to derive model - independent bounds on the luminosity distance @xmath31 of cosmic sources in the expanding flrw flat universe .",
    "we then concretely confront these bounds with current sne ia observations , as provided by the _ high - z supernovae team _ ( hzst ) @xcite and the _ supernova legacy survey _ ( snls ) collaboration @xcite .",
    "in practice , distance measurements to distant sources are made in terms of _ distance modulus _ @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the apparent magnitude of the source and @xmath19 its absolute magnitude .",
    "as it is well known , the distance modulus is related to the luminosity distance @xmath31 via @xmath34 where @xmath35 is measured in mpc . in an expanding flrw spatially flat universe @xmath35",
    "is given by @xmath36 where the subscript @xmath37 stands for the present - day quantities . in what follows",
    "we focus our attention only on the flat ( @xmath38 ) case .",
    "model - independent bounds on the distance modulus @xmath39 as a function of the redshift for two different values of the hubble parameter , i.e , @xmath40 ( dashed lines ) and @xmath41 ( solid lines ) . from top",
    "to bottom the curves correspond to the wec , sec and dec @xmath39 predictions .",
    "note that , in the _ hierarchy _ of the predictions for @xmath39 , violation of the wec also means violation of both sec and dec.,width=245,height=302 ]    * a. wec *    in order to obtain the bounds provided by the wec on @xmath39 we note that eq .",
    "( [ wec - eq ] ) can be written as @xmath42 or , equivalently , @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the velocity of expansion of the universe as a function of scale factor , and @xmath45 is the hubble parameter today .",
    "now , making use of the inequality  ( [ wec - ineq ] ) we integrate  ( [ dist - lumin ] ) to obtain the following upper bound for the distance modulus : @xmath46 + 25,\\ ] ] where we have used that @xmath47 .",
    "clearly , if the wec is obeyed then @xmath39 must take values such that eq .",
    "( [ wec - bound ] ) holds .",
    "note also that the condition @xmath48 gives no further restrictions on the distance modulus , and therefore the wec and nec bounds on @xmath39 coincide [ eq .",
    "( [ wec - bound ] ) ] .",
    "* b. sec *    similarly to the sec , eq .  ( [ sec - eq ] ) implies @xmath49 the inequality above , along with equations  ( [ dist - mod ] ) and  ( [ dist - lumin ] ) , furnishes @xmath50 + 25 \\;.\\ ] ]    * c. dec *    dec provides an upper and a lower bound on the rate of expansion .",
    "indeed , from  ( [ dec - eq ] ) one obtains @xmath51 and @xmath52 @xmath53 @xmath54 .",
    "again , these inequalities , along with  ( [ dist - mod ] ) and  ( [ dist - lumin ] ) , give the following upper and lower bounds for the distance modulus : @xmath55 + 25 \\leq   \\mu(z ) \\nonumber \\\\   &   & \\leq 5\\,\\log_{10}\\ , \\left[\\,h_0^{-1}\\,z(1+z)\\,\\right ] + 25.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as expected [ see eqs .",
    "( [ wec - eq ] ) and ( [ dec - eq ] ) ] , the upper bound of dec coincides with the wec-@xmath39 prediction . in this case , we find , respectively , for wec , sec and dec , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 . ] .",
    "figure 1 shows the distance modulus @xmath39 inequalities [ eqs .",
    "( [ wec - bound]-[dec - bound ] ) ] as a function of the redshift parameter by taking @xmath59 mpc . from top",
    "to bottom the curves correspond , respectively , to the wec , sec and dec predictions for @xmath39 . to plot these curves",
    "we have assumed two different values for @xmath60 , i.e. , @xmath40 ( dashed lines ) and @xmath41 ( solid lines ) , which correspond to @xmath61 of the value provided by current cmb measurements @xcite .",
    "note that , in the _ hierarchy _ of the predictions for @xmath39 , violation of the wec also means violation of both sec and dec , although the opposite does not necessarily hold true .",
    "note also that the curves depend very weakly on the value adopted for the hubble parameter . as an example , at @xmath62 , the difference between the sec-@xmath39 prediction for these two values of @xmath60 is smaller than 1% , which is also maintained for higher values of @xmath63 .    in figure 2",
    "we confront the ec predictions for @xmath39 with the current sne ia observations .",
    "the data points appearing in the first row ( panels 2a , 2b and 2c ) correspond to the so - called _ gold _ sample of 157 events distributed over the redshift interval @xmath64 @xcite , whereas in the second row ( panels 2d , 2e and 2f ) the data set corresponds to the first year results of the planned five years snls collaboration @xcite .",
    "the snls sample includes 71 high-@xmath63 sne ia in the redshift range @xmath65 and 44 low-@xmath63 sne ia ( @xmath66 ) . in all the panels above we have adopted @xmath67 , in agreement with third - year wmap results @xcite .",
    "figures 2a and 2d show the upper - bound curves @xmath39 for the wec - fulfillment .",
    "an interesting aspect of these panels is that they seem to suggest that the wec might have been violated by some of the nearby sne ia ( @xmath68 ) in both samples . as an example , let us take the cases of the sne 1992aq , 1996ab and 1997n ( from _ gold _ sample ) which are , respectively , at @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 . while their observed distance modulus are @xmath72 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 @xcite , the upper - bound wec predictions for the corresponding redshifts are @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 , respectively .",
    "a similar example of wec violation also happens for some sne ia from the slns sample .",
    "besides the low-@xmath63 cases of the sne 1992bs and 1992bh , the high-@xmath63 snls-04d3cp at @xmath78 has @xmath79 @xcite whereas the upper - bound wec prediction is @xmath80 , i.e. , about @xmath81 below the central value observed by the snls collaboration .",
    "note that these same considerations are also applied to the upper - bound dec predictions [ eq .",
    "( [ dec - bound ] ) ] .",
    "note also that the lower - bound of dec is not violated by the current sne ia data ( figs .",
    "2c and 2f ) .",
    "still on wec and dec violations , it is worth mentioning that the observed luminosity distance derived from sne ia observations may be fitted by a dark energy component violating these energy conditions , the so - called phantom fields , first noticed by caldwell  @xcite ( see also @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "however , differently from the above indications of wec and dec violations , most of these results are derived in a model - dependent way and under the assumption that the dark energy equation of state @xmath82 is constant .",
    "a similar analysis for the sec - fulfillment is shown in figs .",
    "2b and 2e . for sec , which is responsible to ensure the attractiveness of gravity and , consequently , a decelerating cosmic expansion , the plots clearly indicate a breakdown for essentially all the sne ia in the redshift interval covered by _",
    "gold _ and snls samples .",
    "the interesting aspect here is that the violation of sec happens even at very high-@xmath63 , as indicated by the examples of the sne 2003az ( _ gold _ ) and 04d3dd ( snls ) at @xmath83 and @xmath84 and whose observed distance modulus are , respectively , @xmath85 and @xmath86 . for these redshifts ,",
    "the corresponding upper - bound sec predictions are @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "the most interesting example , however , comes from the sn 2002fw ( _ gold _ ) at @xmath89 .",
    "while its observed magnitude is @xmath90 , the upper - bound sec prediction for the same redshift is @xmath91 , which is about @xmath92 below the central value measured by the hzst collaboration .",
    "the energy conditions play an important role in the understanding of several properties of our universe , including the current and past accelerating expansion phases in the context of flrw models .",
    "they are also necessary in the formulation and proof of various singularity theorems in classical black hole thermodynamics ( e.g. , the proof of the second law of black hole thermodynamics requires the null energy conditions ( @xmath16 ) , whereas the hawking - penrose singularity theorems invoke the strong energy condition , @xmath93 and , by continuity , @xmath16 ) @xcite .    in this paper , by using the fact that the classical energy conditions can be translated into differential constraints involving the scale factor @xmath12 and its derivatives [ see eqs.([wec - eq]-[dec - eq ] ) ] , we have derived model - independent bounds on the luminosity distance of extragalactic sources . we have confronted these energy - condition - fulfillment bounds with current sne ia observations from _ gold _ and snls samples and shown that all the energy conditions seem to have been violated in a recent past of the cosmic evolution .",
    "the most surprising fact is that these violations may have happened even at high-@xmath63 [ @xmath94 , when the universe is expected to be dominated by usual matter fields .",
    "finally , we emphasize that in agreement with other recent studies @xcite , the results reported here reinforce the idea that no possible combination of _ normal _ matter is capable of fitting the current observational data .",
