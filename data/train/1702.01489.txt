    "the plan of the paper is as follows :    in the text section , we will formulate and solve the continuity and the euler equation for the flow of fractal medium by using a mapping of the fractal matter distribution onto its continuum counterpart , and will obtain the corresponding first integrals of motion , both for accretion governed by the polytropic as well as the isothermal equation of state .",

    "the integrals on this network of fractals can consequently be approximated by fractional integrals ( ren et al .",

    "<S> for three different geometric configurations of matter and two different thermodynamic equations of state , low angular momentum , multi - transonic , axially symmetric accretion flow of matter having fractional dimension of mass distribution onto a rotating black hole has been studied by employing certain post - newtonian pseudo - kerr black hole potential . </S>",
    "<S> such task has been accomplished mathematically by mapping the fractal nature of accreted medium onto its continuum counterpart . </S>",
    "<S> the difference between spin dependence of accretion dynamics of the fractal medium and the continuous medium has been highlighted . by employing a time dependent linear perturbation scheme , it has been demonstrated that accretion of matter with fractional dimension of density distribution can be considered as a natural example of classical analogue model . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding acoustic surface gravity has been estimated in terms of accretion variables . the value of the surface gravity changes as the accreted matter makes a transition from its fractal nature to the corresponding continuum distribution </S>",
