    "<S> we probe the strength of electron - electron interactions using magnetoconductivity measurements of two - dimensional non - degenerate electrons on liquid helium at 1.22 k. our data extend to electron densities that are two orders of magnitude smaller than previously reported . </S>",
    "<S> we span both the independent - electron regime where the data are qualitatively described by the self - consistent born approximation ( scba ) , and the strongly - interacting electron regime . at finite fields </S>",
    "<S> we observe a crossover from scba to drude theory as a function of electron density .    </S>",

    "<S> 2    electrons supported by a liquid - helium surface form a low density , non - degenerate two - dimensional ( 2d ) electron gas . aside from the non - degeneracy </S>",
    "<S> , it differs from other 2d electron systems in the strength of the electron - electron ( e - e ) interaction@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the coulomb interaction is weakly screened by metallic plates that are separated from the electron layer by about 1 mm . </S>",
    "<S> it is an ideal system for testing the properties of strongly - interacting electrons .    </S>",
    "<S> one of the interesting properties of this non - degenerate 2d electron gas is the density of states ( dos ) in a magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> the dos peaks at the landau levels ( lls ) have a width that depends both on the scattering rate and the e - e interaction . </S>",
    "<S> the width of the dos peaks has been calculated@xcite in the self - consistent born approximation ( scba ) and has been studied experimentally@xcite through measurements of the magnetoconductivity . </S>",
    "<S> we report magnetoconductivity measurements from an extremely low density , @xmath0 x@xmath1 m@xmath2 , where e - e interactions are negligible , to densities where coulomb interactions dominate the width of the dos peaks .    in this system </S>",
    "<S> , electron - helium atom scattering dominates at temperatures above @xmath3 k , while electron - ripplon scattering is important at lower temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> each collision between an electron and a helium atom changes the electron energy by about one percent . </S>",
    "<S> thus , scattering is quasi - elastic . </S>",
    "<S> the helium atoms in the vapor act as short range - scatterers to a very good approximation .    in zero magnetic field </S>",
    "<S> the density of states is constant : @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> the magnetoconductivity of electrons , @xmath5 , is given in the drude model for @xmath6 as @xmath7},\\ ; \\ ; \\ ; \\ ; \\ ;   \\sigma_{xx}(0)=ne\\mu_0,\\ ] ] where @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 are the zero field conductivity , mobility and scattering time , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the drude model assumes that electrons are independent and move in straight paths ( in zero field ) and in classical orbits ( in a magnetic field ) .    </S>",
    "<S> a magnetic field transverse to the 2d electrons changes the density of states , and consequently the magnetoconductivity of electrons dramatically . in a magnetic field , </S>",

    "<S> the broadening @xmath13 due to collisions with helium atoms and the broadening @xmath14 due to electron - electron interactions enter the @xmath12 as@xcite @xmath15 once lls form , the drude model loses its validity and a crossover to the scba regime occurs . in scba , the dos and thus the magnetoconductivity is obtained self consistently in the born approximation . </S>",
    "<S> the broadening @xmath13 has been calculated@xcite in the scba limit for a semi - elliptic dos and short range scatterers and given by @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the cyclotron frequency and @xmath18 is the scattering rate in a magnetic field . for @xmath19 and @xmath20 , we assume that the broadening @xmath13 is determined by the zero field scattering time and is on the order of @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> the crossover is delayed by many electron effects@xcite as seen in eq . </S>",

    "<S> the broadening @xmath14 is given by theory@xcite as @xmath22 where @xmath23 , @xmath24 is the fluctuating field@xcite an electron feels due to redistribution of other electrons as it moves , and the thermal wavelength @xmath25 is the characteristic size of an electron in the classical limit @xmath26 , which holds for our experimental data .    </S>",
    "<S> the scba is valid for static scatterers and a vanishing coherence time@xcite . for electrons on helium </S>",
    "<S> the coherence time is on the order of @xmath10 , and the scattering is dynamic , i.e. , the vapor atoms move slowly . for this case </S>",
    "<S> the behavior should be qualitatively given by the scba expression .    </S>",
    "<S> the crossover to the scba regime has already been confirmed by earlier experiments in the quantum limit where @xmath27 , whereas no such crossover has been reported in the classical limit . </S>",
    "<S> this resulted from the electron densities being too high ( greater than @xmath28 m@xmath2 ) in previous experiments.@xcite at those densities the lls can separate only at very high magnetic fields due to many electron effects . in our experiment , we were able to reduce the electron density another two orders of magnitude to @xmath29 m@xmath2 . </S>",

    "<S> , we show the normalized inverse magnetoconductivity @xmath52 as a function of @xmath45 for six electron densities . </S>",
    "<S> we see a crossover from the scba magnetoconductivity ( @xmath45 dependence ) to the drude magnetoconductivity ( @xmath46 dependence ) as the electron density is increased for @xmath53 . </S>",
    "<S> the dashed line is the normalized theoretical drude magnetoconductivity calculated using the experimental parameters of the highest density curve . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain the zero - field mobility and the density for the highest density curve from a fit to the drude theory in small fields . </S>",
    "<S> then , we calculate the electron densities for the lower density curves using the measured zero - field resistivitiy @xmath54 and assuming the same zero - field mobility of @xmath51 m@xmath35/vs obtained for the highest density curve . the fact , that the magnetic field region @xmath55 within which the drude - like behavior is observed gets smaller as the electron density is reduced , prevented us from obtaining the zero - field mobilities accurately and the densities independently for the lower density curves .    </S>",
    "<S> the effect of ll broadening due to e - e interactions is seen clearly in the figure as the crossover to the scba regime occurs at a lower magnetic field as the electron density is reduced . </S>",

    "<S> the crossover is seen more clearly in the inset of the figure where we show a blow up of the same graph at small fields . </S>",

    "<S> the fit gives a zero field mobility of @xmath6610 m@xmath35/vs which is smaller than the value @xmath67 m@xmath35/vs . </S>",
    "<S> this is in agreement with a lower value of the mobility obtained from fits to the scba formula in earlier measurements reported in the quantum limit.@xcite    our data would appear to disagree with theory , which predicts that the contribution @xmath14 to the total broadening @xmath12 becomes negligible at electron densities below @xmath28 m@xmath2 and that the crossover to scba should occur at fields @xmath68 . </S>",
    "<S> the scba magnetoconductivity is not fully developed at @xmath69 t even at the low density of @xmath70 m@xmath2 as a @xmath71 vs. @xmath72 graph yields a slope of @xmath73 which is still greater than the value of @xmath74 in scba . </S>",
    "<S> the contribution @xmath14 to the total broadening is more significant than predicted by theory .    in order to obtain a quantitative result for the crossover field </S>",
    "<S> , we plot our data as @xmath75 - 1 $ ] and fit it with the following function @xmath76 @xmath77(\\mu_0 b)^2\\\\ + \\frac{3\\pi^{3/2}}{8 \\sqrt{2 } } \\ ; c(b , b_c)(\\mu_0 b)^{3/2},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath78 and @xmath62 are the free parameters . </S>",

    "<S> the fitting function @xmath83 starts in the drude regime at @xmath84 and goes into scba at a magnetic field characterized by @xmath62 : @xmath85 the values of @xmath62 obtained from the fits are a measure of the actual crossover field and thus the width @xmath12 , but do not necessarily represent the actual widths of the lls , since the overlap between neighboring levels at the actual crossover field is not known exactly and the fitting function has no theoretical basis .     </S>",
    "<S> vs. @xmath45 . ]    in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4 . , we show the curves with their non - linear least square fits , shown by the solid lines , to eq . 7 . </S>",
    "<S> the best fits are obtained allowing @xmath78 and @xmath62 to be free parameters . </S>",
    "<S> we leave the curves with the highest two densities out of this analysis since , for those data , the crossover region extends too far beyond the magnetic fields used in the experiments , and this results in an error in the fitting parameter @xmath62 .    </S>",
    "<S> the values of @xmath62 obtained from the fits above give an approximate width @xmath86 of the lls for each electron density . </S>",
    "<S> we set @xmath87 , and plot the values of @xmath86 as a function of electron density in fig . </S>",

    "<S> 2 as a solid line in the figure for @xmath88 mk and @xmath89 . </S>",
    "<S> although the values of @xmath86 obtained from the fits differ from the theoretical values by a factor of @xmath90 , they give the correct functional dependence on the electron density .     as a function of electron density . </S>",
    "<S> the solid line is described in the text . ]    the values of @xmath78 from the fits correspond to a reduced mobility for low densities . in our initial fits to the data we allowed for different mobilities in the two regimes as adjustable parameters . </S>",
    "<S> the best fits were given with equal mobilities for the two regimes . </S>",
    "<S> at higher densities van der heijden et al.@xcite deduced a mobility from the scba regime that was a factor of two smaller than the drude mobility . </S>",
    "<S> however , our fits required an adjustment of the drude mobility as well . </S>",
    "<S> the smaller apparent mobility occurs in part , because the low - density data is weighted by the scba regime , and we observe no well - developed drude regime at low densities . </S>",
    "<S> deviations from drude behavior begin at zero field in our data . despite this fact , the strong variation in the field where the data crossover to the scba regime is apparent in both the data curve shown in fig . 2 and the fits shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4 . </S>",
    "<S> the crossover function @xmath79 under - weighs the drude part , but fits very well because there is no well developed drude regime at very low densities in our data .    in conclusion , we measured the magnetoconductivity of non - degenerate electrons in the very low - density limit . </S>",
    "<S> the effect of e - e interactions is clearly demonstrated in these data . </S>",
    "<S> electron - electron interactions have a significant effect on the magnetoconductivity causing a delay in the transition from drude to scba regime as a function of a magnetic field . when the many electron effects are negligible the transition is observed in classical fields . </S>",
    "<S> we studied the dependence of the ll width on the electron density for the first time . </S>",
    "<S> our results agree with the theory qualitatively , but differ by a large numerical factor . a more detailed theoretical analysis of classical electron scattering from dynamic scatterers in a magnetic field is required to reconcile experiment and theory . </S>"
