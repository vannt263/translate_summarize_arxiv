    "idealizations are often employed , when modeling real magnetization dynamics . far from equilibrium , magnetic fluctuations , modeled by white noise",
    "are examples of such an idealization and the magnetization processes predicted in this way have been observed in ultrafast reversal magnetization experiments . however real fluctuations always have finite auto - correlation time and the corresponding spin system dynamics is , rather , described by non - markovian stochastic processes @xcite . despite the practical relevance of non - markovian processes , however , these have received much less attention than markovian processes , chiefly , because of the simplicity of the theory and the familiarity of the corresponding mathematical tools @xcite .",
    "the study of the magnetization dynamics of super - paramagnetic systems , however , is a suitable framework and provides motivation to describe magnetic fluctuations , induced by contact to a heat bath@xcite , that are sensitive to non  markovian effects .",
    "the effective magnetization dynamics of a spin system and a noise is described by a stochastic differential equation of langevin type , also known as the stochastic landau - lifshitz - gilbert ( sllg ) equation  : @xmath0 the einstein summation convention is adopted , with latin indices standing for vector components , @xmath1 is the anti - symmetric levi - civita pseudo - tensor and @xmath2 is a magnetization 3-vector , whose norm is fixed and can be set to unity . here",
    "@xmath3 is the precession frequency which derives from a spin hamiltonian and is such connected to the spin vector .",
    "@xmath4 is the damping coefficient .",
    "the stochastic properties of @xmath5 describe the fluctuations of external and/or internal degrees of freedom , random perturbations and noise .",
    "its correlation functions are assumed to satisfy the relations @xmath6 with @xmath7 and @xmath8 is the time - ordered statistical average product of stochastic variables @xcite and @xmath9 is a single characteristic constant time . with proper conditions gaussian process ,",
    "poisson process and two - state ( dichotomy ) markov process enjoy this `` time derivative property '' @xcite .",
    "in general a detailed description of the stochastic processes in the extended phase space @xmath10 is not easy to establish  @xcite .",
    "stochastic processes are completely described by an infinite set of multivariate probability distributions . in practice ,",
    "not all multivariate distributions are not desirable but only a few , mainly the one - variable distribution @xmath11 and the two - variable distribution , @xmath12 .",
    "the former is used to determine the average @xmath13 of any functional @xmath14 of the process @xmath15 , e.g. its statistical moments .",
    "the latter is used to determine two - time statistics , e.g. , the correlation function @xmath16 . in the white noise limit ,",
    "a fokker - planck equation on @xmath17 has been established only for a thermally interacting spin system subject to a constant external field @xcite . beyond the mean - field approximation , the explicit spin dependance of the effective field , including a magnetic anisotropy , on the probability distribution @xmath18 , may be addressed .",
    "in contact with a thermostat , described by the stochastic vector , @xmath19 , the spin system precesses about the axis of magnetic effective field , defined by both a uniform external magnetic field with @xmath20 and an anisotropic single - axis .",
    "this can be observed in super - paramagnetic nano - magnets which behave as effective , two - state , anisotropic spin systems @xcite .",
    "the deterministic frequency vector is given by @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the anisotropy single - axis and @xmath23 the anisotropy frequency .",
    "the noise vector , @xmath19 , is assumed to be described by a gaussian stochastic process , that is completely defined by its 1-point function @xmath24 and 2point function @xmath25 .",
    "therefore the only non  trivial information is contained in the these , that we assume to define an ornstein - uhlenbeck process  @xcite , which means that @xmath26 and @xmath27 it can be shown that this process does converge to the centered white noise process , when @xmath28 .",
    "moreover , it is assumed that the thermostat can be described by a fluctuation - dissipation theorem that relates the strength of the noise , @xmath29 , with the temperature @xmath30 by the relationship @xmath31 , where @xmath4 is the parameter that appeared in eq.([llg0 ] ) .",
    "these microscopic degrees of freedom give rise to average quantities , that probe collective properties .",
    "such quantities can be operationally defined by taking statistical averages over the noise of eq.([llg0 ] ) at equal times . in the limit of low damping ( i.e. @xmath32 ) ,",
    "the equation for the magnetization , @xmath33 , is  : @xmath34 and implicates higher order correlation functions of noise and spin that have to be determined in turn . by applying the shapiro - loginov formulae of differentiation @xcite to the components of the @xmath35 at equal times",
    ", we obtain the equation @xmath36 introducing the right - hand side of eq.([llg0 ] ) into eq.([shapiro ] ) , evolution equations for the mixed moments @xmath37 are obtained .",
    "due to the non - linearity of the sllg equation , an infinite hierarchy arises @xcite : the equations for the second - order moments depend on third - order moments , and so on . in order to solve the system ,",
    "closure relationships need to be found .",
    "so the equations for the moments @xmath38 are now required and are provided by @xmath39 . assuming that this identity holds , the time derivative of @xmath40 is replaced by the right - hand side of eq.([llg0 ] ) inside the statistical average .",
    "this leads to an additional set of equations for the second - order moments of the microscopic spin degrees of freedom , that are closely related to those written by garanin _",
    "et al _ ( see eq.(6)@xcite ) and garcia - palacios _ et al .",
    "_ ( see eq.(2.10 )  @xcite ) . as long as the stochastic variables follow individual gaussian processes , their connected moments ( labelled as @xmath41 ) , beyond the second moment are zero @xcite .",
    "the case of the mixed connected moments of spin and noise is more subtle .",
    "if a linear coupling between the spin and the noise is assumed , the mixed cumulants , above the second will , also , vanish .",
    "if the gaussian hypothesis is dropped , the general relations , at equal times , between the desired moments are  : @xmath42 these considerations lead to the following system of equations  : @xmath43 these expressions are closed by considering first the independence of gaussian processes , the form of the effective frequency vector and the expression of the autocorrelation function of the noise .",
    "one has explicitly  : @xmath44    combined with eqs.([sys1],[sys2],[sys3 ] ) , the derived system of equations is called the dynamical landau - lifshitz - bloch model ( dllb ) . in the limit of @xmath28 , eq.([sys2 ] ) gives a direct expression for the mixed moment of the noise and the magnetization as @xmath45 , which makes the @xmath46 matrix antisymmetric .",
    "once introduced into eq.([sys1 ] ) , a longitudinal contribution for the spin dynamics appears in which the amplitude of the noise is proportional to the square root of the temperature . for finite values of @xmath9 , eq.([sys1 ] ) exhibits a `` memory effect '' which shows that the value of @xmath47 for the time @xmath48 depends on all the previous values of @xmath49 before the time @xmath48 .",
    "numerical experiments were performed to test the consistency of the closure hypothesis . for `` low '' values of @xmath9 ,",
    "the dynamics is close to markovian and eqs.([sys1],[sys2],[sys3 ] ) are expected to match the results obtained from an averaged markovian stochastic dynamics . in order to realize these comparisons , a reference model is constructed from eq.([llg0 ] ) with a white noise random vector @xmath50 .",
    "multiple spin trajectories with the same initial conditions are generated and followed in time according to a previously detailed symplectic integration scheme @xcite .",
    "a statistical average is taken over all the realizations .",
    "eqs.([sys1],[sys2],[sys3 ] ) are integrated with an eight - order runge - kutta integration scheme , with adaptive steps , constructed from the jacobian of the whole system .",
    "the figure ( [ fig1]-left ) ( resp . [ fig1]-right ) exhibits the average magnetization ( resp .",
    "spin - spin autocorrelation function ) from the stochastic llg equation and our dllb model for the same value of the amplitude @xmath29 in the white noise limit .    for low value of @xmath29 ( i.e. in the normal phase ) ,",
    "the average stochastic dynamics follows our dllb model .",
    "a similar situation has been already investigated for an external constant field only @xcite .",
    "when @xmath9 increases , the noise is no longer white and does not follow a markov s process .",
    "a complete stochastic system of equations for both the spin and the noise is built by supplementing eq.([llg0 ] ) with @xmath51 where @xmath52 is a gaussian centered stochastic process  @xcite , but with @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "formally , this system is integrated as @xmath55 with @xmath56 is the liouville operator corresponding to eq.([stochnoise ] ) . because the liouville operators of the spin and the noise commute , an integration of the colored system is performed by the combination of the two operators as @xmath57 .",
    "this is performed for larger values of @xmath9 for which the figure  ( [ fig2 ] ) exhibits @xmath47 and the diagonal part of @xmath58 .",
    "it is observed that , even for `` large '' values of @xmath9 , our dllb model continues to track the dynamics of the colored stochastic llg system .",
    "the influence of the higher than second - order cumulants on the dynamics of the average magnetization and spin autocorrelation function is mitigated by a large damping factor @xmath4 which prevents detailed descriptions of the magnetization dynamics .",
    "moreover , because of the link between the amplitude @xmath29 and the damping factor @xmath4 , through a to - be - derived fluctuation - dissipation theorem in the special case of an explicit dependance of the spin in the effective field , the domain of validity of our dllb model in temperature could be significantly controlled .",
    "when the intensity of the noise increases , the spin dynamics is no longer gaussian .",
    "it is observed numerically , in the stochastic dynamics , by calculating the cumulant function @xmath59 .",
    "the ten independent spin cumulants are depicted , for several values of the amplitude @xmath29 in the figure ( [ fig3 ] ) .",
    "as shown , for this particular situation , some terms go to zero in time , whereas some remain finite , depending on the underlying symmetries . at the expense of higher order expressions , the eqs .",
    "( [ sys1],[sys2],[sys3 ] ) can be supplemented by an expansion of @xmath60 and integrated together .",
    "this represents an option where the deviation off the gaussian character of the spin distribution is explicitly treated at the third - order .",
    "the third - order correlation functions for the dynamical variables @xmath61 satisfying a stochastic langevin - like equation are generally determined by first solving this equation in the presence of the noise and then averaging the product of these variables over the ensemble of the random noise .",
    "a path integral formalism can be established for deducing identities between the correlation functions .",
    "this strategy has been tested in various approximation schemes , including the quenched approximation ( i.e. @xmath62 ) .",
    "a shortcut might be to look for an alternate description of an effective system of equations in a closed time path formalism of schwinger allowing to describe a general non - equilibrium field theory at finite temperature @xcite .",
    "this is why a closure approximation was proposed by martin , siggia and rose @xcite which represents the classical limit of the closed time path formalism and will be the subject of further investigation ."
