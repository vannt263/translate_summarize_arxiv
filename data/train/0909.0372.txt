    "light - cone distribution amplitudes ( das ) , which denote the momentum fraction distributions of partons in a hadron , play important roles in hard exclusive processes @xcite and the light - cone qcd sum rule applications . furthermore , das are of eminent importance themselves because of their ability to reveal the internal structure of the composite particles .",
    "studies on the nucleon octet das were first carried out early in late 1980s with qcd sum rules on the moments up to the leading twist @xcite .",
    "more than ten years later , braun @xmath6 @xmath7 gave a systematic investigation on the higher order das of the nucleon based on the conformal expansion @xcite .",
    "recently , an overview was given in ref .",
    "@xcite , in which the authors present a comparison of the nucleon das with various approaches and models . in our previous work @xcite , we have given the das of the @xmath8 and @xmath9 baryons on the conformal partial wave expansion to the leading order conformal spin accuracy .",
    "as composite particles with two @xmath10-quarks , @xmath0 have the same lorentz structures as other @xmath11 octet baryons in the @xmath12-flavor symmetry limit , but the @xmath12-flavor breaking effects may play more important roles than in the cases of the other octet baryons , provided that the masses of the @xmath10-quarks are considered .",
    "thus investigations on the @xmath0 baryon das are of interest and somewhat complicated .",
    "the higher order twist contributions to das have several origins , among which the main contribution comes from `` bad '' components in the wave function and in particular of components with `` wrong '' spin projection for the case of baryons @xcite .",
    "we focus on higher order twist contributions from `` bad '' components in the decomposition of the lorentz structure in this paper .",
    "the general description of das is based on the conformal symmetry of the massless qcd lagrangian dominated on the light cone .",
    "the conformal partial wave expansion of the das can be carried out safely in the limit of the @xmath12-flavor symmetry approach . however ,",
    "when terms connected with the @xmath10-quark mass are considered , the @xmath12-flavor breaking effects need to be included .",
    "we assume that the conformal expansion of the nucleon das can be extrapolated to our cases , which is similar to the arguments for mesons and baryons with a single @xmath10-quark @xcite . in the present work ,",
    "effects from the @xmath12-flavor symmetry breaking are considered as the corrections , which originate from two sources : isospin symmetry breaking and corrections to the noperturbative parameters .",
    "the related processes containing the baryons can be investigated in the framework of the light - cone qcd sum rule ( lcsr)@xcite with the das .",
    "lcsr is a developed noperturbative method of the traditional qcd sum rule @xcite .",
    "its main idea is to expand the correlation function between the vacuum and the hadron state on the light cone @xmath13 , while the noperturbative effects , which correspond to the condensates in traditional qcd sum rules , are described by the das connected with the final hadron state .",
    "lcsr has been widely used to investigate the electromagnetic ( em ) form factors and various decay processes related to the baryons @xcite . in the applications , we take advantage of the lcsr approach to investigating the em form factors of @xmath0 and form factors of the weak transition @xmath14 . both the magnetic moments of @xmath0 baryons and decay width of the semileptonic transition @xmath4 will be estimated .",

    "[ sec : sum ] . finally , we give the explicit expressions of the @xmath0 baryon das in the appendix .",
    "our discussion of the @xmath0 baryon das in this section is an extension and a complement of @xcite , so we just list the results following their procedures , and it is recommended that the original papers be consulted for details . generally , das of the @xmath11 octet baryons can be defined by the matrix element of the three - quark operator between the vacuum and the baryon state @xmath15 in the limit of @xmath12-flavor symmetry : @xmath16 where @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 refer to the lorentz indices and @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 the color indices , @xmath23 represents the light quark , @xmath24 is a lightlike vector which satisfies @xmath25 , and @xmath26 are real numbers denoting coordinates of valence quarks .    for the case of @xmath0 , after taking into account the lorentz covariance , spin and parity of the baryons , the matrix element ( [ matele ] ) is decomposed as @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the spinor of the baryon with the quantum number @xmath29 ( @xmath30 is the isospin , @xmath31 is the total angular momentum and @xmath32 is the parity ) , @xmath33 are certain dirac structures over which the sum is carried out , and @xmath34 are the distribution amplitudes which depend on the scalar product @xmath35 .    as these `` calligraphic '' invariant functions",

    "note that in the case of the nucleon , the isospin symmetry can be used to reduce the number of the independent das to eight . however , there are no similar isospin symmetric relationships that existe when the @xmath0 baryon is considered , which is the same as the cases of the @xmath9 and @xmath8 baryons",
    ". therefore , we need altogether @xmath57 chiral - field representations to express all the das .",
    "in this section we will give the explicit expressions of the das with the aid of the conformal expansion approach .",
    "the conformal expansion of the das is based on the conformal symmetry of the massless qcd lagrangian , which makes it possible to separate longitudinal degrees of freedom from transverse ones .",
    "the properties of transverse coordinates are described by the renormalization scale that is determined by the renormalization group , while the longitudinal momentum fractions that are living on the light cone are governed by a set of orthogonal polynomials , which form an irreducible representation of the collinear subgroup @xmath58 of the conformal group .",
