    "low - mass stars are generally believed to form as a result of the gravitational collapse of molecular cloud cores .",
    "the cores are initially supported by thermal and magnetic forces , but because of ambipolar diffusion ( the drift of ions , to which the magnetic field lines are attached , relative to the dominant neutral gas component ) , they gradually lose their magnetic support and eventually collapse after becoming `` supercritical '' ( see , e.g. , mouschovias 1987 for a review ) . the most detailed numerical treatments to date of the problem of the ambipolar diffusion - initiated formation of supercritical cores and the early stages ( prior to point mass formation ) of their subsequent dynamical collapse have been presented by mouschovias and collaborators ( fiedler & mouschovias  1992 , 1993 ; ciolek & mouschovias  1993 , 1994 , 1995 , hereafter cm93 , cm94 , cm95 ; basu & mouschovias  1994 , 1995a , 1995b , hereafter bm94 , bm95a , b ) . because the timescale for core formation is much longer than the timescale for dynamical collapse , special numerical techniques had to be employed in these calculations .",
    "the simulations were terminated when the central densities reached @xmath0 and the underlying assumptions of isothermality ( e.g. , gaustad  1963 ) and flux freezing onto the ions ( e.g. , pneuman & mitchell  1965 ) broke down .",
    "these calculations were nevertheless able to demonstrate that _ supercritical cores begin to collapse dynamically before a point mass ( i.e. , a protostar ) appears at the origin_.    the dynamical evolution of supercritical cores after their formation has been studied by many researchers .",
    "solutions exist for the collapse of nonrotating , self - gravitating spheres without thermal support ( henriksen  1994 ) , self - gravitating spheres with thermal support ( penston  1969 ; larson  1969 ; shu  1977 ; hunter  1977 ; boss & black  1982 ; whitworth & summers  1985 ; foster & chevalier  1993 ) as well as with a combined thermal and isotropic magnetic pressure support ( chiueh & chou 1994 ) , and self - gravitating disks with thermal support ( narita , hayashi , & miyama  1984 ; matsumoto , hanawa , & nakamura  1997 ) and also with ordered , frozen - in magnetic fields ( nakamura , hanawa & nakano  1995 ; li & shu  1997 , hereafter ls ) . in order to choose a particular solution for a given problem",
    ", one needs to know the properties of the supercritical core at the time of its formation .",
    "this information , however , can only be gleaned from a study of the preceding , quasi - static evolution of the core under the influence of ambipolar diffusion .",
    "although different assumptions about the initial state of the core yield solutions that are qualitatively similar in their gross behavior ( the core collapses with near free - fall speeds and a point mass eventualy forms at the center ) , the solutions do differ in such important details as the accretion rate onto the central point mass and the formation ( or absence ) of shocks .",
    "the well - known examples of the larson - penston ( 1969 ) and shu  ( 1977 ) similarity solutions in fact represent two extremes of a whole continuum of self - similar collapse solutions specified by a cloud s initial configuration and the conditions at its boundary ( hunter 1977 ; whitworth & summers 1985 ; see also chiueh & chou 1994 for a generalization to the case of an isotropic internal magnetic pressure ) .",
    "the larson - penston ( 1969 ) solution is characterized by a spatially uniform , supersonic ( at @xmath1 times the isothermal speed of sound @xmath2 ) infall speed and an inverse - square dependence of the density @xmath3 on the radius @xmath4 at the instant of point - mass formation ( pmf ) ; the mass accretion rate at the center is @xmath5 ( where @xmath6 is the gravitational constant ) at that instant and increases to @xmath7 immediately after pmf .",
    "numerical simulations of the collapse of nonmagnetic isothermal spheres ( hunter 1977 ; foster & chevalier 1993 ) have indicated that this solution provides a good approximation to the conditions near the center at the pmf epoch for clouds that are initially near a marginally stable equilibrium .",
    "the shu ( 1977 ) solution strictly applies only to the post - pmf evolutionary phase : it consists of an inner free - fall region and a hydrostatic outer envelope that are separated by an outward - propagating ( at a speed @xmath2 relative to the gas ) expansion wave .",
    "the envelope corresponds to a singular isothermal sphere ( @xmath8 ) and the mass accretion rate onto the center is @xmath9 . in applying this solution to real systems ,",
    "it was proposed to identify the initial core configuration at the end of the quasi - static ambipolar - diffusion phase with a singular isothermal sphere ( or , more generally , a toroid ) at the instant of pmf ( e.g. , shu , adams , & lizano 1987 ; li & shu 1996 ) .",
    "however , as we noted above , the conclusion from detailed numerical simulations has been that the dynamical phase of core collapse generally commences well before the pmf epoch , so that the innermost region is not well represented by a quasi - static solution at the time of point - mass formation .",
    "another interesting effect that depends on the specific choice of initial conditions and on the detailed physical properties of the collapsing core is the formation ( or absence ) of shocks ( e.g. , tsai & hsu 1995 ; ls ) .",
    "for example , ls discovered that when , instead of a spherical core , one considers the collapse of a flattened disk , the expansion wave of shu  ( 1977 ) becomes a shock . as we show in this paper , when one takes proper account of the fact that supercritical cores collapse dynamically before a point mass first forms at the origin , that shock disappears .",
    "nevertheless , a physical basis for the formation of shocks in collapsing magnetized molecular cloud cores has been discussed by li & mckee ( 1996 ) , who argued that a hydromagnetic c - shock will appear as a result of the outward diffusion of inwardly advected magnetic flux .",
    "the existence of such a shock has been confirmed in the numerical simulations of ciolek & knigl ( 1998 , hereafter ck ) , and it is , in fact , a salient feature of the semianalytic solutions derived in this paper .",
    "the aim of the present work is to clarify the effects of ambipolar diffusion in dynamically collapsing supercritical cores . toward this goal",
    ", we construct semianalytic , time - dependent similarity solutions of gravitationally contracting , magnetized , isothermal disks .",
    "although the evolution of real molecular cloud cores is not expected to be exactly self similar , we demonstrate , through a comparison with the detailed numerical simulations of ck , that our solutions capture the main traits exhibited by the latter calculations . based on an analogous comparison with the results of numerical simulations ,",
    "basu ( 1997 ) showed that a self - similar scaling describes the pre - pmf evolution in the innermost flux tubes of collapsing supercritical cores quite well . to complement his study",
    ", we concentrate in this paper on the post - pmf evolutionary phase .",
    "our approach differs , however , from that of basu ( 1997 ) in that we explicitly solve the induction equation , whereas he accounted for the effects of ambipolar diffusion only in a phenomenological manner .",
    "in fact , the solutions that we derive , while involving various simplifications , are nevertheless the first to consistently incorporate ambipolar diffusion into a self - similar representation of the collapse of a magnetized cloud core . we formulate the problem in  2 , present our solutions in  3 , and discuss the results in  4 .",
    "our conclusions are summarized in  5 .",
    "the problem of the self - initiated formation and contraction of cloud cores due to ambipolar diffusion in axisymmetric , self - gravitating , isothermal , magnetic molecular clouds was formulated in detail in cm93 . in the presence of",
    "an ordered , large - scale magnetic field the contracting cloud core assumes a disk - like configuration on account of the fact that the magnetic stresses inhibit motion normal to the field lines ( see fiedler & mouschovias 1993 ) . along the field lines it is a good approximation to assume that the cloud is at all times in hydrostatic equilibrium , with thermal pressure providing support against vertical gravity . for simplicity ,",
    "we neglect both the pressure support provided by internal hydromagnetic waves ( i.e. , `` turbulence '' ) and the vertical squeezing of the core by the external thermal and magnetic pressure ( including , in particular , the squeezing induced by the radial field component at the disk surface ; see eq . [ 9 ] in ck ) . for a self - gravitating disk with possibly a point mass at the center",
    ", the hydrostatic balance equation can thus be written as @xmath10 where @xmath4 is the cylindrical radius , @xmath11 is the surface density , @xmath3 is the gas density , @xmath12 is the vertical scale height ( assumed to be @xmath13 ) , @xmath14 is the isothermal speed of sound ( with @xmath15 being the boltzmann constant , @xmath16 the temperature , and @xmath17 the mean mass of a gas particle ) , and @xmath18 is the mass of the star that forms at the center .",

    "in deriving equation ( [ induction ] ) we have assumed that the disk is weakly ionized and that the magnetic field is `` frozen '' into the ions ( valid for disk densities @xmath37 ) .",
    "the first assumption implies @xmath38 where the subscripts @xmath39 and @xmath40 refer , respectively , to the ions and neutrals . under this assumption",

    "although this expression ( which was used in deriving the dependence of @xmath51 on @xmath52 in eq . [ [ ionize ] ] ) is strictly valid only for densities @xmath53 ( at densities @xmath54 , @xmath55 ; see figs .",

    "equation  ( [ induction ] ) follows from combining equations  ( [ ionind ] ) and ( [ drift ] ) and taking the ion mass to be @xmath57 .",

    "it is seen that contributions to the gravitational acceleration at a radius @xmath34 arise from disk material both interior _ and _ exterior to @xmath34 . there",
    "exist , however , two limits in which the simple expression @xmath71 holds true , where @xmath72 is the mass interior to the radius @xmath34 at time @xmath35 : ( a ) when @xmath73 , and ( b ) when the gravitational pull of a point mass at the center dominates over the disk self - gravity . as we demonstrate below , equation  ( [ simplegravity ] ) is a very good approximation to the true value of @xmath28 during the post - pmf phase of the disk evolution . for future reference , we note here that the mass conservation equation ( [ sigma ] ) can be rewritten in terms of @xmath74 in the form @xmath75    what about @xmath23 ? assuming that the medium surrounding the disk is current - free , the magnetic field can be expressed as the gradient of a potential : @xmath76 .",
    "now , since @xmath77 , this scalar potential satisfies laplace s equation @xmath78 with neumann boundary conditions @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the uniform and constant large - scale magnetic field that is frequently observed to thread molecular clouds on scales that are large in comparison with their ( flattened ) inner cores ( e.g. , hildebrand , dragovan , & novak 1984 ; novak , predmore , & goldsmith  1990 ; kane et al .",
    "1993 ) . therefore ,",
    "in the ideal case of a current - free medium outside a thin disk , the function @xmath81 satisfies the same equation and ( neumann ) boundary conditions as the gravitational potential @xmath82 ( where @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 at @xmath25 , and @xmath86 at infinity ) .",
    "hence , by direct analogy with the expression for @xmath28 in equation  ( [ gravity ] ) , one can write @xmath87 where the last approximation is valid when @xmath64 at the disk surface is @xmath88 ( see cm93 , cm94 , cm95 , bm94 , and bm95a , b ) . when one considers _ only _ the inner parts of the collapsing disk , as in the present analysis , one can neglect @xmath80 .",
    "no longer holds , as is the case in the outer parts of the supercritical core , the expressions in equations  ( [ gravity ] ) and ( [ bra ] ) differ , and magnetic tension can indeed `` overwhelm '' self - gravity .",
    "this should clarify the issue raised in the footnote on p. 248 of ls .",
    "] pursuing the analogy with gravity even further , one sees that it is possible to use the simple expression @xmath89 when either ( a ) @xmath90 or ( b ) the magnetic field advected to the center can be represented by a split monopole that dominates over the disk magnetic field .",
    "we will demonstrate that either ( a ) or ( b ) are applicable in a collapsing disk following the formation of a central point mass , so that equation  ( [ simplebr ] ) provides a good approximation to @xmath23 during that phase .",
    "although one can in principle integrate equations ( [ sigma])([induction ] ) for any set of physically reasonable initial conditions [ expressed by the functions @xmath91 , @xmath59 , and @xmath60 ] , one particular set of initial distributions makes it possible to obtain self - similar solutions that compare very favorably with detailed numerical simulations . )",
    "conditions , only one particular set of distributions corresponds to exact self - similarity at @xmath61 . ] specifically , the only initial surface - density and magnetic - field distributions that are consistent with a self - similar evolution are @xmath93 for these distributions the initial mass - to - flux ratio is constant throughout the disk : @xmath94 as it turns out , the scalings given by equation ( [ sb ] ) are indeed representative of the central region of a collapsing core at the time of point - mass formation ( see cm94 , cm95 , bm94 , bm95a , b , and basu 1997 ) .",
    "we therefore associate that instant with the time @xmath61 , and , adopting the nomenclature introduced by li & shu  ( 1996 ) , we denote the corresponding disk configuration as the `` pivotal '' state of the model .",
    "we emphasize once again the point first made in  1 that the pivotal state is _ not _ the end state of the sequence of subcritical quasi - static equilibria that slowly evolve due to ambipolar diffusion .",
    "surface - density and magnetic field distributions ( eq .",
    "[ [ sb ] ] ) are the same as those of the static pivotal state in the ls similarity solution , which corresponds to a singular isothermal disk ( see li & shu 1996 ) . ]",

    "this result should be contrasted with the criticality condition for ideal mhd , which involves the magnetosonic speed instead of just the thermal sound speed ( see  3.3 ) .",
    "the mathematical reason for this difference is that magnetic diffusivity introduces derivatives of higher order than in ideal mhd ( e.g. , ferreira & pelletier 1995 ) .",

    "information propagates via magnetosonic and sonic waves .",
    "the critical surfaces that appear in steady - state problems can be thought of as being the relics of the time - dependent problem in which the various waves had sufficient time to propagate to the exterior boundaries and communicate the information associated with those boundaries to the whole flow ( blandford & payne  1982 ) . when diffusivity is present , the only waves that can survive propagation to and from infinity are the sonic waves ( since the magnetosonic waves simply dissipate away ) : this is the physical reason why only the sonic critical point appears in steady - state , diffusive mhd .",

[ [ induction ] ] ) greatly exceeds the advective term near the origin . in practice , the outward diffusion prevents the formation of the split monopole field configuration in the first place , and a _ different _ solution is established near the origin .",
    "this solution is characterized by the magnetic flux being left behind while matter continues to fall into the center and forms there a point mass that grows with time according to equation ( [ pointmass ] ) .",
    "the flow consequently turns into an `` undiluted '' free fall at small @xmath113 , @xmath175 with coresponding field components @xmath176 in this case , although the magnetic field grows with decreasing distance from the origin , the magnetic force remains negligible in comparison with the gravitational pull of the central point mass .",

    "it may at first seem counterintuitive that , in the nonideal case , the local mass - to - flux ratio decreases with decreasing @xmath113 , since one could expect ambipolar diffusion to become progressively more efficient at loading magnetic field lines with matter as one approached the densest parts of the core near the center .",

    "figures  2@xmath1812@xmath182 show the derived solution for the parameter set @xmath104 , @xmath183 , @xmath105 , and @xmath155 .",
    "these parameter values are typical of the outer layers of a supercritical core in the ck simulations and are consistent with physical quantities deduced from observations of protostellar cores ( e.g. , crutcher et al . 1993 , 1994 ) .",
    "it is seen that , while the solution is everywhere continuous , it exhibits an abrupt change in the flow parameters at a certain value of @xmath113 .",
    "this transition , which is characterized by a continuous evolution of the physical parameters , a neutral flow velocity that remains supersonic throughout , and a faster deceleration of the ions than of the neutrals , represents a _ c - shock _",
    "( e.g. , draine & mckee  1993 , smith & mac low  1997 ) .",
    "a similar ambipolar diffusion - induced c - shock has been found in the numerical simulations of ck ( see  4 for a detailed comparison between the self - similar solution and the ck results ) .",
    "we identify the position of the shock with the location of the abrupt drop in the ion velocity and determine the shock speed from the motion of this transition relative to the origin .",
    "the numerical integration yielded @xmath184 and @xmath185 , or , equivalently , @xmath186 as an aid in visualizing this self - similar solution , we present in figure  3 time sequences of the disk density and radial velocity during the collapse up to the time when a 1.1  @xmath187 star is assembled at the center .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that the c - shock we have found is _ required _ by ambipolar diffusion and _ is not _ the shock discussed in ls ( which , as we pointed out in  3.3 , is avoided altogether in an isopedic disk that has a nonzero initial infall velocity ) . in the present ( diffusive ) case the magnetic field can not remain attached to the matter as mass starts to accumulate in the origin , so the field decouples from the gas as soon as a point mass appears at the center .",
    "the region of decoupled flux grows outward at a fraction of the speed of sound and a c - shock develops at its outer boundary .",
    "an interesting and somewhat counterintuitive result is that the accretion rate onto the central point mass is _ smaller _ ( albeit only slightly ) in the case with ambipolar diffusion than in the flux - frozen case ( compare figs .",
    "2@xmath188 and 2@xmath182 ) .",
    "the reason is that , as we have noted , the local mass - to - flux ratio decreases when the magnetic field decouples from the matter .",
    "the corresponding increase in the magnetic force slows down the inflow and thereby reduces the inflow rate .",
    "note that the two components of the magnetic force , the field tension and the field pressure gradient , are everywhere of comparable magnitude , so one can not neglect either of them in the analysis .",
    "it is of interest to compare our self - similar model results with the detailed numerical simulations of ck .",
    "the model they present is of a @xmath189 molecular cloud core with temperature @xmath190 . just prior to pmf ( @xmath191 )",
    "the accretion rate is @xmath192 and the mass - to - flux ratio at the center is @xmath193  note , however , that unlike the self - similar model , neither @xmath194 nor @xmath195 are uniform at that time in the model core of ck ( see their figs .",
    "1@xmath56 and 1@xmath182 ) .",
    "immediately after pmf the accretion rate rises to @xmath196 , and it then decreases to @xmath197 by the time a @xmath198 protostar forms at the origin ( which occurs at @xmath199 ) . , where @xmath200^{1/2}$ ] is the gravitational contraction ( @xmath201 free - fall ) time at the location @xmath202 within the core , which contains @xmath203 at @xmath61 .",
    "this result is similar to that observed in the nonmagnetic collapse solutions of shu ( 1977 ) , hunter ( 1977 ) , and foster & chevalier ( 1993 ) . ]",
    "rapid ambipolar diffusion in the inner flux tubes halts the inward advection of magnetic flux , which piles up and propagates outward as a hydromagnetic disturbance . as the front of piled - up flux moves out to larger radii , the magnetic field behind the disturbance and the neutral  ion collisional coupling become strong enough to affect the infalling neutrals , and a shock forms in the core .",
    "the shock is of the c type ( e.g. , mullan 1971 ; draine 1980 ) : the infall speed of the neutrals ( in the shock frame ) remains supersonic while the infall speed of the ions is much smaller than the ion alfvn speed . by the time a @xmath204 protostar has formed at the origin in their typical model calculation ,",
    "the shock is located at a radius @xmath205 and propagates outward with a speed ( in the stellar rest frame ) @xmath206 .",
    "( for comparison , eq .",
    "[ [ results ] ] yields @xmath207 , @xmath208 , and @xmath209 , respectively , for the accumulated central mass , shock location , and shock speed at that time . ) as the hydromagnetic disturbance propagates outward , the postshock accretion rate decreases due to the fact that the neutrals are `` hung up '' ( i.e. , decelerated ) in the region of amplified magnetic field behind the shock front ( see fig .",
    "6@xmath133 of ck ) .",
    "this is also what happens in the self - similar model ( fig .",
    "2@xmath182 ) .",
    "as discussed in ck ( see also li & mckee 1996 ) , the postshock region is potentially susceptible to interchange instabilities ( i.e. , the gravitationally - induced interchange of magnetic flux tubes ; e.g. , spruit & taam 1990 ; spruit , stehle , & papaloizou 1995 ) : this issue , however , can not be fully addressed until nonaxisymmetric collapse simulations are performed .    in the limit @xmath210 ( or @xmath211 ) the column density and the infall speed of the neutrals are both @xmath212 ( @xmath213 , see eq .",
    "[ [ va ] ] and figs . 2@xmath181 , 2@xmath214 , 3@xmath215 , and 3@xmath216 ) , reflecting the `` undiluted '' free - fall collapse induced by the central point mass .",
    "a similar behavior is also revealed in the numerical simulations ( see figs . 6@xmath56 and 6@xmath181 of ck ) .",
    "as mentioned in  3.4 , ambipolar diffusion `` unloads '' the mass in the effectively stationary ( see fig .",
    "2@xmath181 ) flux tubes behind the shock front . as a result , the local mass - to - flux ratio @xmath217 is no longer a monotonically decreasing function behind the shock ( see figs .",
    "2@xmath214 , 2@xmath133 , and 3@xmath216 ) ; this behavior is also seen in the ck simulations ( see their fig .",
    "8@xmath215 ) .    one obvious advantage of",
    "the simple self - similar model is that one can scan the space of model parameters much more easily than is possible in the case of the time - consuming numerical simulations .",
    "for instance , the typical model presented in ck took @xmath218 two weeks of computer time ( running in background on an sgi r-4000 indigo workstation ) for the central mass to accumulate @xmath219 of material .",
    "by contrast , calculation of our self - similar models is usually completed within half a minute ( for typical models ) when run on the same workstation .",
    "we note that li & mckee ( 1996 ) suggested that ohmic dissipation [ a process that , for the assumed cloud composition and cosmic ray ionization rate , becomes important for densities @xmath220 ( e.g. , nakano & umebayashi  1986a , b ) , or , equivalently , on scales @xmath221 would halt the accretion of flux onto a protostar , with the flux consequently presenting an obstacle to the neutrals and thereby giving rise to a shock .",
    "however , as shown by ck and verified by our self - similar model , ambipolar diffusion is sufficiently efficient at much lower densities ( or much larger radii ) to halt flux advection and cause the formation of a hydromagnetic shock , independent of the effect of ohmic dissipation . despite the misidentification of the shock formation mechanism and the fact that the induction equation was not solved for the magnetic field structure , the simplified model of li & mckee was found by ck to provide a reasonably good approximation to the results of their numerical simulations .",
    "as we have already noted in  3.1 , the numerical results of core collapse and point - mass formation presented in ck can be described by a self - similar model only in an approximate sense .",
    "in particular , the condition of the spatial uniformity of @xmath27 , @xmath194 , and @xmath195 at the instant of pmf , as well as the scaling @xmath222 , are generally not strictly valid in the cores of the models presented in cm94 , cm95 , bm94bm95b , and ck .",
    "furthermore , the temporal behavior of the physical quantities in our self - similar solution deviates from that in ck .",
    "for example , ck find that in the region of free - fall collapse near the central point mass @xmath223 , which is different from the self - similar result @xmath224 ( see eqs .  [ [ nondimensional ] ] and [ [ va ] ] ) .",
    "it is worth stressing , however , that , in spite of these differences , the self - similar solution accurately describes the formation of an outward - propagating ambipolar - diffusion shock as well as the other basic characteristics of the evolution of a protostellar core during the post - pmf epoch .",
    "as discussed in ck , the numerical simulations of this model are consistent with observations of accreting protostars .",
    "in particular , the inferred evolution of the mass accretion rate is similar to that deduced for the protostellar objects hl tauri and l1551-irs5 , and the calculated magnetic field structure agrees with polarimetric observations of dense protostellar cores ( see   4.2 of ck ) .",
    "in this paper we have presented a self - similar solution of the collapse of a magnetized molecular cloud core ( assumed to also be nonrotating and isothermal ) that , for the first time , incorporated the effects of ambipolar diffusion in a self - consistent manner .",
    "we have focused on the post - pmf ( point - mass formation ) phase of the collapse of a disk - like core , noting that basu ( 1997 ) had previously explored the self - similar nature of the collapse before a central mass ( i.e. , a protostar ) first appears at the origin .",
    "we clarified the distinction between the ideal and nonideal mhd cases by plotting the singular lines in the position ",
    "velocity space and showing that they correspond to different critical speeds ( the magnetosonic speed and thermal sound speed in the ideal and nonideal problems , respectively ) .",
    "we obtained a solution for the ideal ( flux - frozen ) case that exhibits a split - monopole field topology near the center .",
    "this solution differs from the one obtained by li & shu ( 1997 ) in that it involves no shocks .",
    "we showed that the shock in the ls solution is a direct consequence of their assumption that the core at the time of pmf is described by a stationary density distribution ( corresponding to a singular isothermal toroid ) , and we pointed out that a shock will generally _ not _ be present under the more realistic assumption of a nonzero inflow speed near the origin at that instant .",
    "we demonstrated , however , that a shock is a generic feature of the solution in the nonideal ( ambipolar diffusion ) case .",
    "this ( c - type ) shock is a direct consequence of the action of ambipolar diffusion in the central region of the core following pmf : the magnetic diffusivity decouples the field from the matter , causing the gas to free - fall to the center ( where it accumulates in a point mass ) and the field to stay behind and drive a shock outward .",
    "we have compared this solution with the results of the numerical simulations of ciolek & knigl ( 1998 ) and confirmed that , while the more realistic numerical models are not strictly self - similar , our simplified solution nevertheless captures the main features of the core evolution after pmf .",
