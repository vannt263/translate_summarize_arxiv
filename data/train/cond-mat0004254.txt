    "electronic structure of 3@xmath4-transition metal compounds has been an active area of research for many decades , owing to their rich and diverse physical properties , often exhibiting exotic transport and magnetic properties . in particular ,",
    "the electronic structure of the hexagonal nickel sulphide  ( nis ) has attracted a lot of interest @xcite due to the fact that it has a first - order phase transition as a function of temperature at about 260  k. the high - temperature phase is a pauli paramagnetic metal , transforming isostructurally to an antiferromagnetic state with nearly temperature independent resistivity @xcite .",
    "the high temperature phase is metallic with a resistivity in the order of 10@xmath5  ohm - cm @xcite which is comparable with other highly metallic inorganic compounds of 3@xmath4 transition elements @xcite .",
    "the metallic state can be stabilized by the application of pressure or substitution with se for s. a pressure of more than 20  kbar @xcite or a se percentage of more than 13% @xcite suppresses the electronic phase transition , stabilizing the metallic phase down to the lowest temperature . at room temperature ,",
    "the hexagonal nis crystallizes in the nias structure having space group @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) and lattice parameters , @xmath8 = 3.440    and @xmath9 = 5.351    @xcite .",
    "the ni@xmath10 is in an octahedral environment of sulphur atoms in nis and these nis@xmath11 octahedra are edge - shared within the @xmath12-plane and face - shared along the @xmath9-axis , forming a three - dimensional network of ni - s connectivity in this system .    in spite of its interesting properties , there have been few studies to understand the electronic structure of these compounds .",
    "band structure calculations @xcite indeed yield a metallic ground state for the high - temperature phase .",
    "however , the details of the electronic structure , as shown in the present work , can not be entirely described within the band theory due to the presence of substantial correlation effects even in the metallic phase .",
    "different configuration interaction models have been employed in order to explain the valence band @xcite and the transition metal core level spectra @xcite ; however , there has not been any attempt to describe both using a single model and with a single set of parameters . in the present paper",
    ", we investigate the electronic structure of metallic nis@xmath0se@xmath1 system using @xmath13-ray photoemission ( xp ) , ultra - violet photoemission ( up ) , and bremsstrahlung isochromat ( bi ) spectroscopic measurements in conjunction with _ ab - initio _ band structure calculations as well as parameterized many - body calculations , in order to provide a consistent and quantitative description of the electronic structure and the electronic parameter strengths controlling the physical properties of this system .",
    "polycrystalline samples of nis@xmath0se@xmath1 with @xmath13 = 0.0 and 0.15 used for the present study were prepared following the standard solid state reaction techniques reported in the literature @xcite ; @xmath13-ray diffraction patterns as well as resistivities of the samples were found to be in agreement with the reported data in the literature @xcite .",
    "spectroscopic measurements were carried out in a combined vsw spectrometer with a base pressure of 2@xmath14 mbar equipped with a monochromatized al  k@xmath15 @xmath13-ray source , he discharge lamp and an electron gun .",
    "xp , bi , and up spectroscopic measurements were performed on the samples with an overall instrumental resolution of better than 0.8  ev , 0.8  ev , and 90  mev , respectively .",
    "bi spectra have been recorded by monochromatizing the emitted photons at 1486.6  ev .",
    "the sample surface was cleaned _ in situ _ periodically during the experiments by scraping with an alumina file and the surface cleanliness was monitored by recording the carbon 1@xmath16 and oxygen 1@xmath16 xp signals .",
    "the reproducibility of the spectral features was confirmed in each case .",
    "the binding energy was calibrated to the instrumental fermi - level which was determined by recording the fermi - edge region from a clean silver sample .",
    "experimental spectra of nis reported here were collected for the highly conducting state at room temperature ( @xmath17  k ) , while those of nis@xmath18se@xmath19 , which does not exhibit any transition , were collected at @xmath20  k. using high resolution photoemission spectroscopy , it has been established @xcite that the electronic structure close to @xmath21 changes across the electronic transition at @xmath22  k. however , our low - resolution spectroscopic results show hardly any change in the spectra across the transition either in the valence band or in the core levels , in agreement with previous studies @xcite establishing similar gross electronic structures with comparable electronic parameter strengths for both phases across the electronic transition .",
    "scalar relativistic linearized muffin - tin orbital ( lmto ) band structure calculations have been performed within the atomic sphere approximation ( asa ) for the paramagnetic phase of nis with the real crystal structure .",
    "the unit cell has two formula units and the sphere radii for ni and s were 2.4 and 3.12  au , respectively . in this calculation ,",
    "convergence was obtained self - consistently using @xmath16 , @xmath2 and @xmath4 basis at each atomic sphere with 186  @xmath23 points in the irreducible part of the brillouin zone . in order to understand and compare the experimental electronic structure with",
    "that obtained from the band structure calculations , it is necessary to include the effects of photoemission cross - sections of various levels .",
    "thus , the theoretical spectra based on the band structure calculations were constructed by multiplying the various partial densities of states ( dos ) with the corresponding cross - sections computed within the formalism of ref .",
    "the cross - section weighted dos was then convoluted with a lorentzian with energy dependent full - width at half maximum , to account for the lifetime broadening and a gaussian to describe the instrumental resolution broadening .",
    "core level and valence band  ( vb ) spectra were calculated for a nis@xmath11 cluster with the geometry in accordance with the bulk crystal structure of this compound , within a parameterized many - body multi - band model including orbital dependent electron - electron ( multiplet ) interactions @xcite .",
    "the multiplet interactions within the @xmath24 manifold were expressed in terms of slater integrals @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 and those within the @xmath28 manifold were expressed in terms of @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "the values @xmath26 ( = 9.79  ev ) , @xmath27 ( = 6.08  ev ) , @xmath30 ( = 6.68  ev ) , @xmath31 ( = 5.07  ev ) and @xmath32 ( = 2.88  ev ) were taken to be 80% of the ni atomic hartree - fock values .",
    "the monopole terms , @xmath25 and @xmath29 were treated as parameters and therefore , varied to fit the experimental spectrum .",
    "it is often more convenient to discuss the electron - electron interaction strengths in terms of the multiplet averaged quantities , @xmath33 and @xmath34 , where    @xmath35",
    "@xmath36    the multiplet averaged @xmath34 term was set to have a value 1.2 times that of @xmath33 @xcite , thus reducing the number of freely adjustable parameters in the model .",
    "the hopping interaction strengths between ni  3@xmath4 and s  3@xmath2 were expressed in terms of the slater - koster parameters @xmath37 and @xmath38 and that between the different bonding s  3@xmath2 orbitals were expressed in terms of @xmath39 and @xmath40 @xcite .",
    "we fixed the ratio between @xmath38 and @xmath37 to be -0.5 , while that between @xmath40 and @xmath39 to be -0.2 , in these calculations .",
    "the calculations were performed in the symmetry adapted ( @xmath41 and @xmath42 ) basis including the transition metal 3@xmath4 and the bonding sulphur 3@xmath2 orbitals . in the calculation for the valence band spectrum ,",
    "the s  3@xmath2 spectral contribution was also calculated within the same parameterization . as the size of the hamiltonian is large ,",
    "the lanczos method was used to evaluate the spectral function and the calculated one - electron removal spectra were appropriately broadened to simulate the experimental spectra . in the ni  2@xmath2 core level calculation ,",
    "doniach - sunjic line shape function was used for broadening the discrete energy spectrum of the cluster model , in order to represent the asymmetric line shape of core levels from these highly metallic compounds , consistent with other core levels in the system . in the case of vb calculations ,",
    "energy dependent lorentzian function was used for the lifetime broadening .",
    "other broadening effects such as the resolution broadening and solid state effects were taken into account by convoluting the spectra with a gaussian function .",
    "the broadening parameters were found to be consistent with values used for similar systems @xcite .",
    "taking into account the different atomic cross - sections for the ni  3@xmath4 and s  3@xmath2 states , it is necessary to calculate a weighted average of these two contributions to the valence band .",
    "the atomic cross - section ratio @xcite between s @xmath43 and ni @xmath24 states ( @xmath44 0.17 ) is not appropriate in this context , since solid - state effects alter this ratio significantly .",
    "it was found that s 3@xmath2/ni 3@xmath4 cross - section ratio of approximately 5.5 times that obtained from the atomic calculations gives the best result for the cluster calculations .",
    "the total density of states ( dos ) for nis along with the ni  @xmath4 and s  @xmath2 partial dos obtained from the band structure calculations for the paramagnetic phase are shown in fig .  1 .",
    "the calculated dos is in good agreement with previous reports @xcite .",
    "the fermi level lies close to a minimum in the dos , and there is a finite dos at the @xmath21 , consistent with the metallic nature of the system .",
    "the total dos between -3 and 1  ev is dominated by ni  @xmath4 contributions with the energy region around the most intense peak in the dos at about -1.65  ev dominated by the ni  @xmath41 states and the features at higher energies ( @xmath45  ev ) arising primarily from the @xmath42 states . as a consequence of the high covalency of the system ,",
    "the ni  3@xmath4 ( @xmath42 ) states have substantial contribution from s  3@xmath2 states .",
    "these states constitute the antibonding states due to ni  @xmath4-s  @xmath2 interactions .",
    "their bonding counterparts are located between -5 and -3  ev and have dominant s  3@xmath2 contributions .",
    "the non - bonding states of the system , centered around -7  ev is weaker in intensity and is stabilized at a higher binding energy compared to ni  @xmath4-s  @xmath2 bonding states , which is a generic feature as seen in the case of the transition metal monosulphides @xcite .",
    "we compare the experimental xp valence band and bi spectra corresponding to the occupied and unoccupied parts of the electronic structures for nis and nis@xmath18se@xmath19 in fig .",
    "2(a ) and ( b ) , respectively .",
    "the calculated spectra for nis , obtained using various partial dos as explained in the previous section , are also shown for comparison .",
    "the xp and bi spectra of nis and nis@xmath18se@xmath19 show finite spectral intensity at @xmath21 , indicating their highly metallic conductivity .",
    "it is clear from the experimental spectra in figs .",
    "2(a ) and ( b ) that the substitution of se in place of s does not cause any perceptible change in the xp valence band spectra as well as in the bi spectra .",
    "this indicates that the occupied as well as the unoccupied parts of the electronic structure in these two compounds are similar , in agreement with the similar magnetic and transport properties of the two compounds .",
    "2(a ) shows that the peak in the experimental spectra around 1.3  ev binding energy ( marked a ) essentially consists of ni  @xmath24 states , while that at @xmath46  ev binding energy ( marked b ) is due to the s  3@xmath2 contribution .",
    "however , the calculated spectrum does not describe the experimental spectra accurately , as the energy positions of the different features , a and b are not correctly predicted by the calculation , but are shifted to higher binding energies compared to the experiment .",
    "additionally , the experimental feature a is narrower compared to the calculated one .",
    "moreover , the structure around 7  ev binding energy ( marked c ) in the experimental spectra is absent in the theoretical spectrum . in the unoccupied part of the electronic structure ,",
    "the peak at around -0.7  ev in the experimental bi spectra is contributed mainly by the unoccupied e@xmath47 states of the ni  @xmath24 manifold , strongly hybridized with the s  @xmath43 bands , as seen from fig .  1 . the strong suppression in the s  3@xmath2 contribution in the calculated spectrum ( fig .",
    "2(b ) ) compared to the partial dos ( fig .",
    "1 ) in the vicinity of @xmath21 arises from a substantially lower photoemission cross - section for the s  3@xmath2 states compared to ni  3@xmath4 at al k@xmath15 @xmath13-ray energies .",
    "the broad spectral features above 4  ev are due to the various high energy unoccupied states in the system , such as ni  @xmath48 and s  @xmath24 .",
    "similar to the case in xp spectra , the band structure calculation , while providing a reasonable description of the overall spectral features observed in the bi spectra , fail to reproduce the energy position of the feature a in fig .",
    "2(b ) by approximately 0.3  ev . these failures of the band theory to explain the electronic structure of this system indicates that electron correlation effects are important even in the paramagnetic metallic phase .",
    "the valence band spectra of nis and nis@xmath18se@xmath19 recorded using different photon energies , namely 1486.6  ev ( xps ) , 40.8  ev ( ) and 21.2  ev ( ) are compared in fig .",
    "the various features are marked as a , b and c and represent the same features as in fig .",
    "at all the photon energies , there is a finite spectral intensity at @xmath21 . besides providing a much higher resolution compared to the xps ,",
    "up spectra with and ii radiations allow for a wider variation in the relative photoemission cross - sections of ni  3@xmath4 and s  3@xmath2 , leading to an easy identification of their relative contributions to the valence band spectra .",
    "the marked loss in the intensity of the feature b for a moderate increase of the photon energy between  and  radiations arises from the cooper minimum in the s  @xmath43 photoionization cross - section at around 50  ev , clearly establishing the dominance of s  3@xmath2 contributions in the energy range of the feature b , with feature a having predominantly ni  3@xmath4 contributions , in agreement with previous works @xcite .",
    "the valence band spectra for nis and nis@xmath18se@xmath19 taken at various photon energies are very similar , showing the similarity in their electronic structure within the solid solution , nis@xmath0se@xmath1 for @xmath49 .",
    "the transition metal @xmath50 core level spectra in transition metal compounds often reveal important information on their electronic structures .",
    "the ni  @xmath50 core level spectra for nis and nis@xmath18se@xmath19 are shown in the inset of fig .  4 ; the two spectra are very similar to each other .",
    "each spectrum consists of spin - orbit split , @xmath51 and @xmath52 peaks at 853.4  ev and 870.7  ev binding energies , respectively with pronounced satellite features at 860  ev and 876  ev , suggesting that electron correlations are important in the system .",
    "the satellite intensity relative to the main peak is considerably more in the @xmath52 region compared to that in the @xmath51 region .",
    "while it is indeed possible to have different shapes and intensity for the two satellite features accompanying @xmath51 and @xmath52 features due to details of the multiplet interactions , such a strong variation between the two satellites as observed here is unexpected . in order to explore the possibility of strong variations in the inelastic background function , normally assumed to vary smoothly , we have performed electron energy loss spectroscopy ( eels ) on these samples , with the same primary energy as that of the ni  @xmath50 core level peak .",
    "the inelastic loss background appropriate for the ni  2@xmath2 photoemission spectrum was constructed from the experimental eels spectrum by convoluting it with a gaussian to obtain similar width for the elastic peak as that in the core level main peak .",
    "the region near the elastic peak was replaced by an integral background function .",
    "the total inelastic background was then generated by adding the loss functions corresponding to the @xmath51 and @xmath52 features with the intensities given by the degeneracy ratio ( 2:1 ) of the core levels .",
    "the resulting background function is shown in the inset of fig .  4 as a solid line .",
    "we find that there is an intense and structured contribution to the background function arising from a plasmon band overlapping the @xmath52 satellite region and resulting in the anomalously large satellite intensity in the @xmath52 region compared to that in the @xmath51 region .",
    "it is also seen that at around 856  ev , there is a peak - like structure in the inelastic background ; this appears at the same position as that of a weak intensity feature at about the same energy in the core level experimental spectrum as shown by the vertical dashed lines in the inset of fig .",
    "this structure in the inelastic scattering background could have its origin from the inter - band @xmath53 transitions .",
    "thus , it appears that this weak intensity shoulder in the experimental ni  2@xmath2 spectrum is largely due to this extrinsic loss feature in the background function .",
    "our explanation is contrary to the earlier interpretation @xcite of this feature as arising from intrinsic processes .    in order to obtain a quantitative description of the electronic structure of this system , we have calculated the ni  @xmath50 core level and valence band ( vb ) spectra within a single model involving a nis@xmath11 cluster , retaining the local geometry of the real solid . the calculated ni  @xmath50 spectrum ( solid line ) for the parameter set s - ni @xmath37 = -1.4  ev , s - s @xmath39 = 0.7  ev , @xmath54 = 2.5  ev and @xmath33 = 4.0  ev , including the experimentally determined inelastic background is superposed on the experimental spectrum ( open circles ) in the main panel of fig .  4 , exhibiting a good agreement ; the calculated spectrum without any broadening is presented as bar diagrams .",
    "there is an underestimation of the intensity around the shoulder to the main peak near 857  ev and around 883  ev binding energies .",
    "these small discrepancies are possibly due to the differences between the experimental eels spectrum used for generating the background function and the actual inelastic loss background for the photoemission spectrum .",
    "the previous estimates @xcite of the various parameter strengths in nis obtained from a model that included a fictitious conduction band in addition to ni  3@xmath4-s  3@xmath2 basis within the cluster model used for the core level calculation , are @xmath37 = -1.47  ev , @xmath54 = 2.5  ev , and @xmath33 = 5.5  ev .",
    "thus , the present estimates differ significantly only for @xmath33 , for which we have obtained a smaller value .",
    "the @xmath37 values estimated for nis is similar to that estimated for other divalent nickel sulphides , for example , @xmath37 = -1.5  ev for nis@xmath55 and banis@xmath55 @xcite , and for trivalent ni oxide systems , such as lanio@xmath56 ( @xmath37 = -1.57  ev @xcite ) .",
    "however , divalent ni oxide systems , such as nio , typically exhibit a ni  3@xmath4-o  2@xmath2 @xmath37 = -1.25  ev @xcite .",
    "this decrease in the strength of @xmath37 for the divalent oxides compared to trivalent ones is due to an increase in the ni - o distances in the divalent oxides .",
    "the similarity in the @xmath37 of nickel sulphides and the trivalent ni oxides , in spite of the differences in their ni - ligand bond length ( @xmath57  1.93    for lanio@xmath56 compared to @xmath58  2.39    in nis ) arises from the fact that s  3@xmath2 orbitals are much more spatially extended in nature than o  2@xmath2 and hence have a larger overlap integral with ni  3@xmath4 orbitals . in general , @xmath54 is expected to be smaller for sulphides compared to oxides , since the o  @xmath50 levels are more stable than the s  @xmath43 levels ; for example , the estimated @xmath54 for nio is 5.5  ev @xcite compared to 2.5  ev in nis .",
    "the value of @xmath33 for nis ( 4.0  ev ) is much smaller than that in nio ( 6.5  ev ) possibly due to a more efficient screening in nis , arising from the smaller charge transfer energy , @xmath54 and larger hopping strength , @xmath37 , leading to stronger covalency effects .",
    "we have analyzed the ground state wavefunction of nis corresponding to the estimated parameter strengths in terms of the various electron configurations .",
    "the ground state of the system was found to consist of 60.7% , 35.8% and 3.4% of @xmath59 , @xmath60 , and @xmath61 configurations with a high - spin configuration ( @xmath62 ) .",
    "the average value of the @xmath63occupancy @xmath64 is found to be 8.43 , showing a highly covalent ground state of the system . in the case of nio , a typical divalent oxide of ni , @xmath65",
    "is found to be @xmath66 @xcite .",
    "we have analyzed the characters of the final states of the system responsible for different features in the experimental spectrum , in order to understand their origins .",
    "the analysis was carried out for the final state energies marked 1 - 10 in fig .",
    "the different contributions to the final states from various electron configurations ( @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 ) are listed in table .",
    "i. these features can be grouped into three different regions ; the main peak region , 852 - 856  ev ( labeled 1 - 3 in fig .",
    "4 ) ; intense satellite region , 858 - 861  ev ( labeled 4 - 6 ) , and weak satellites in the region 863 - 866  ev ( labeled 7 - 10 ) .",
    "the first group of features in the main peak region has a dominant @xmath60 character as seen from the table , which are the  well - screened \" states of the system and correspond to one ligand ( sulphur ) electron being transferred to the ni site to screen the ni  @xmath50 core - hole potential created by the photoemission process .",
    "the second group of features , has a mixed character with significant contributions from all the configurations .",
    "this is in contrast to the case of nio where the intense satellite structure results primarily from the  poorly - screened \" @xmath59 configuration .",
    "the third group of features has a dominant @xmath61 contribution for the lower energy region ( labeled 7 and 8) and a dominant @xmath59 character for the higher energy region ( labeled 9 and 10 in fig .",
    "4 ) , with a considerable amount of @xmath60 character for the entire region .",
    "the xp valence band spectrum of nis has also been calculated within the same model .",
    "an important feature of the present calculation is that the s  @xmath43 contribution to the vb spectrum has been calculated on the same footing as the contribution from the ni  3@xmath4 within the _ same _ model without the need to adjust either the shape or the energy position of the ligand contribution to the valence band region , thereby enhancing the reliability of the estimated parameter strengths .",
    "the calculated spectrum ( solid line ) along with the ni  @xmath24 ( dashed line ) and s  @xmath43 ( dot - dash line ) contributions for nis are shown superimposed on the experimental data ( open circles ) in fig .",
    "an inelastic scattering background function ( dotted line ) is also included in the total calculated spectrum . the calculated contributions from the ni  @xmath24 to the total spectrum for nis is also shown without any broadening effect as an energy stick diagram in fig .",
    "the parameter set used for the vb calculation is similar to that used for the core level calculation , but with a ni  3@xmath4-s  3@xmath2 @xmath37 of -1.2  ev instead of -1.4  ev .",
    "such minor adjustments of parameter strengths between the simulations for the core and valence level photoemission spectra , are of common occurrence .",
    "the present estimates of the electronic structure parameters are similar to that obtained from the previous valence band calculations @xcite within the cluster - model .",
    "the agreement between the experimental spectrum and the calculated spectrum in the present study ( see fig .",
    "5 ) is remarkable over the entire energy range .",
    "the main peak in the valence band spectrum in fig .",
    "5 at about 1.3  ev arises essentially from ni  3@xmath4 photoemission contribution , though there is a small contribution arising from s  3@xmath2 states also due to the covalent mixing of states .",
    "it is possible to delineate such contributions only in the present approach where s  3@xmath2 contribution is also calculated within the same model . within the traditional approach ,",
    "s  3@xmath2 contribution would be approximated by a single gaussian with its peak position , width and intensity being freely adjusted to obtain the best possible description .",
    "clearly the present approach is more reliable and satisfactory . a second , and",
    "more intense , s  3@xmath2 contribution is responsible for the experimental spectral feature near 4  ev binding energy .",
    "the shoulder appearing between about 6 and 9  ev is once again dominated by the ni  3@xmath4 contributions .",
    "this observation along with the fact that this feature is not in agreement with the _ ab - initio _ band structure results ( see fig .",
    "2 ) , clearly suggests that this feature is driven by correlation effects .",
    "the analysis of the ground state wavefunction for the parameter set used for the vb spectrum shows that the ground state has 64.9% , 32.6% and 2.5% of @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 characters giving rise to an average @xmath63occupancy ( @xmath65 ) of 8.38 electrons with a high - spin configuration for the ni@xmath10 , similar to that obtained from the core level calculation .",
    "the parameter strengths estimated here place nis@xmath0se@xmath1 samples in @xmath3-metal region of the zsa phase diagram @xcite .    the results of the character analysis of the final states labeled 1 - 11 in the figure corresponding to the ni  @xmath24 contribution in the vb spectrum of nis are shown in table .",
    "ii . on the basis of this analysis",
    ", the spectral features can be grouped into three regions , the main peak region ( 0 - 6  ev , labeled 1 - 6 ) , the strong satellites in the 6 - 8.5  ev range ( labeled 7 - 9 ) and weaker satellites beyond 8.5  ev ( marked 10 and 11 ) .",
    "the final states in the main peak region predominantly consist of @xmath67 states with a non - negligible contributions from @xmath68 and @xmath69 configurations .",
    "this is similar to the scenario as observered in the case of other charge - transfer systems , like nio . in the satellite region",
    "( 6 - 8.5  ev ) , the final states are dominated by @xmath68 and @xmath69 configurations .",
    "the weak intensity features at higher energies are dominated by @xmath69 configuration with a substantial contribution also from @xmath67 states .",
    "it is to be noted that the first ionization state , marked 1 in the figure , is not at the fermi energy .",
    "this is the well known artifact of finite cluster - model calculations which invariably exhibit a gap in the charge excitation spectrum due to the discrete eigen - spectrum of a finite cluster .",
    "it is believed that this ionization state acquires a band width in the thermodynamic limit closing the discrete gap and overlaping the @xmath21 .",
    "a dispersion width of less than 1  ev is seen to be sufficient to bring this about ; such a dispersion is consistent with our results obtained from lmto band structure calculations for the infinite solid .",
    "while we have not performed an analysis of the orbital symmetry , our analysis for the first ionization state shows it to be a spin - doublet state .",
    "it is evident that the shoulder - like structure at around 7  ev in the experimental vb spectra is primarily due to the satellite structure of ni  @xmath24 states and is expected to have some non - bonding s  @xmath43 contribution as seen from its photon energy dependence ( see fig .  3 ) .",
    "this explains the inability of the band structure calculations to explain this feature , as the origin of this feature is primarily due to the electron correlations present in the system , giving rise to strong satellite structures .",
    "the same correlation effects are also responsible for shifting the main peak to a lower energy and making it narrower compared to the band structure results ( see fig .  3 ) .",
    "this satellite structure , with a dominant @xmath68 character , is the spectral signature of the lower hubbard band .",
    "this observation along with the highly conducting pauli paramagnetic property of these compounds suggests that the hubbard side - bands exist deep inside the metallic regime .",
    "this is in accordance with the predictions of the dynamical mean field theory ( dmft ) calculations based on the hubbard model @xcite , that well defined hubbard bands continue to exist in the spectral functions even far away from the mott transition in the metallic region , though the mott - hubbard gap collapses by the transfer of spectral weight from the hubbard side - bands to the coherent spectral features near @xmath21 region .    in conclusion , we have investigated the electronic structure of the system , nis@xmath0se@xmath1 , using various electron spectroscopic techniques to elucidate the underlying electronic structure .",
    "the substitution of se in place of s does not show appreciable changes in the electronic structure of the system , indicating similar electronic parameters for this solid solution .",
    "the band structure results do not describe well the details of the spectral features in the paramagnetic phase of the system , while a parameterized many - body multi - band model is found to be successful in describing the core level and valence band spectrum of the nis .",
    "the core and valence band spectral calculations of paramagnetic metallic phase of nis show that it is a correlated metal with a highly covalent character .",
    "the asymmetric line shape as well as the weak feature in the core level spectra have been ascribed to extrinsic loss processes in the system .",

    "<S> the asymmetric line shape as well as the weak intensity feature in the ni  2@xmath2 core level spectrum has been ascribed to extrinsic loss processes in the system . the presence of satellite features in the valence band spectrum shows the existence of the lower hubbard band , deep inside the @xmath3 metallic regime , consistent with the predictions of the dynamical mean field theory . </S>"
