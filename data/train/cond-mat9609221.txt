    "metal - insulator transitions of purely electronic origin , i.e. those for which the structure of the ionic background does not play a role , are commonly divided into two categories . in one category",
    "the transition is triggered by electronic correlations , or interactions , and in the other it is driven by disorder . the first case is known as a mott transition,@xcite and the second one as an anderson transition.@xcite it is believed that for many real metal - insulator transitions both correlations and disorder are relevant . the resulting quantum phase transition , which carries aspects of both types of transitions , we call an anderson - mott transition ( amt).@xcite    until very recently virtually all approaches@xcite studied the amt only in the vicinity of two dimensions by generalizing@xcite wegner s theory@xcite for the anderson transition .",
    "renormalization - group methods lead to a critical fixed point in @xmath5 dimensions , and standard critical behavior with power - law scaling was found .",
    "however , the framework of these theories does not allow for an order parameter ( op ) description of the amt , and does not lead to a simple landau or mean - field theory.@xcite as a result , the physics driving the amt remains relatively obscure in this approach , compared to standard theories for other phase transitions .",
    "an alternative line of attack has recently been explored by the present authors.@xcite we have shown that an op description of the amt is possible with the tunneling density of states ( dos ) as the op .",
    "a simple landau theory then yields the exact critical exponents , above the upper critical dimension , @xmath6 . in this respect",
    "the amt is conceptually simpler than the anderson transition , which has no known simple op description , and whose upper critical dimension may be infinite .",
    "one of the most far - reaching implications of our approach is that the amt is in some respects similar to magnetic transitions in random fields .",
    "qualitatively , this can be understood as follows .",
    "consider a model of an interacting disordered electron gas . in terms of anticommuting grassmann fields , @xmath7 and @xmath8 , the action can be written,@xcite    @xmath9    with ,    [ eqs:1.2 ] @xmath10\\,\\psi_{\\sigma}(x)\\quad , \\label{eq:1.2a}\\ ] ]    the kinetic or free part of s ,    @xmath11    the disorder part of s , and    @xmath12    denoting the interaction part of s. in these equations , @xmath13 with @xmath14 denoting imaginary time , @xmath15",
    ", @xmath16 is the electron mass , @xmath17 is the chemical potential , @xmath18 is a spin label , and for simplicity we have assumed an instantaneous point - like electron - electron interaction with strength @xmath19 .",
    "@xmath20 is a random potential which represents the disorder . for simplicity",
    "we also assume @xmath20 to be @xmath21-correlated , and to obey a gaussian distribution with second moment    @xmath22    where the braces denote the disorder average , @xmath23 is the bare dos per spin at the fermi energy , and @xmath24 is the bare elastic mean - free time . for future use",
    "we write @xmath25 as ,    @xmath26    where a matsubara frequency decomposition of @xmath27 and @xmath28 has been used .    as mentioned above , the most obvious candidate for an op for the amt",
    "is the single particle dos , @xmath29 , at the fermi level . in terms of grassmann variables",
    "this quantity is proportional to the zero - frequency limit of the expectation value of the variable @xmath30 :    [ eqs:1.5 ] @xmath31    with ,    @xmath32    where we have normalized the dos by @xmath33 , and the brackets denote an expectation value with respect to the action @xmath34 .",
    "note that the so defined dos is actually a local dos , i.e. it depends on * x*. examining eqs .",
    "( [ eq:1.4 ] ) and ( [ eqs:1.5 ] ) , we see that the local op for the amt couples linearly to the random potential , and depending on the sign of @xmath20 it will favor either an increasing or a decreasing dos .",
    "similarly , @xmath35 , i.e. @xmath36 always favors a decreasing dos .",
    "we conclude that the interaction term in general frustrates the disorder term , just like in a random field ( rf ) magnet problem .",
    "this conclusion has a number of important implications .",
    "for example , if conventional scaling exists at the amt , then one expects hyperscaling to be violated due to a dangerous irrelevant variable ( div ) , as it is in rf magnets.@xcite as a consequence of this , we argue below that wegner s scaling law relating the conductivity exponent @xmath3 to the correlation length exponent @xmath37 is modified .",
    "furthermore , if the amt shares all of the features known to be induced in magnets by a random field , then one would expect glasslike features and unconventional or activated scaling similar to what has been predicted@xcite and observed@xcite in classical rf magnets .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows . in section ii",
    "we give a sketch of our order - parameter theory of the amt .",
    "an explicit scaling theory near @xmath38 is constructed . in the first part of section iii",
    "we give a general scaling theory of the amt , assuming it is a conventional phase transition . in the second part of this section we review some aspects of an activated scaling theory for the amt .",
    "we conclude in section iv with a short discussion .",
    "here we briefly review the formalism we have used to show that at least near @xmath38 , the amt and the magnetic transition in a rf ising model have many features in common . for details we refer to two recent papers.@xcite    our starting point is the nonlinear sigma model ( nl@xmath18 m ) that has been used to describe the amt near two dimensions .",

    "a wilson - type rg procedure generates this term as well as others .",

    "the main idea is that under renormalization , the disorder @xmath131 scales to infinity while u , the coefficient of the quartic term in eq .",
    "( [ eq:2.6 ] ) , scales to zero such that their product    @xmath132    scales to a stable fixed point value that is of @xmath133 in all of the other flow equations only the product @xmath134 appears so that a stable critical fixed point is obtained .",
    "to first order in @xmath135 the resulting critical exponents are,@xcite    [ eqs:2.17 ] @xmath136",
    "@xmath137    @xmath138    @xmath139    @xmath140    we finally mention that the rg flow properties , @xmath141 @xmath142 , have an interesting physical interpretation .",
    "@xmath131 represents the disorder , while @xmath89 is a measure of the importance of quantum fluctuations about the sp .",
    "because @xmath89 determines physical quantities like the order parameter , this implies that quantum fluctuations are dangerously irrelevant near the op driven amt .",
    "this in turn modifies the standard hyperscaling equalities .",
    "based on the known or suspected behavior of the random field ising model , there are two distinct scaling scenarios one can imagine for the amt .",
    "the first is a conventional one,@xcite that takes into account in a general way the dangerous irrelevant variable discussed in section ii .",
    "the second , strikingly different one is new in the context of metal - insulator transitions , and is called the activated scaling scenario.@xcite      there are standard ways to construct conventional scaling descriptions of either classical or quantum @xmath143 phase transitions . for the random field like transition considered here ,",
    "one of the most important features is the presence of a dangerous irrelevant variable ( div ) , namely @xmath89 .",
    "suppose that @xmath144 is characterized by an exponent @xmath145 , defined so that @xmath146 .",
    "one - loop perturbation theory gives @xmath147 , but here we keep @xmath148 general .",
    "this adds a third independent exponent to the usual two independent static exponents .",
    "in addition , there is the dynamical scaling exponent @xmath149 . for the case considered here",
    "it turns out that @xmath149 is not independent , but rather it is equal to the scale dimension of the field conjugate to the op .",
    "this is due to the fact that rf fluctuations are much more important than quantum fluctuations .",
    "the dominance of rf fluctuations compared to either thermal or quantum fluctuations is a general feature of rf problems .",
    "the net result , confirmed explicitly near @xmath38 , is ,    @xmath150    as for the classical rf problem , the div @xmath89 , changes @xmath151 in all scaling relations to @xmath152 .",
    "for example , near the transition the op obeys a scaling or homogeneity relation ,    [ eqs:3.2 ] @xmath153 with @xmath154 related to @xmath155 and @xmath156 by the usual scaling law , but with @xmath157 due to the violation of hyperscaling by the div , @xmath158 similarly , the exponents @xmath159 and @xmath160 are given by ,    [ eqs:3.3 ] @xmath161 @xmath162    next we consider the transport coefficients .",
    "the charge , spin , or heat diffusion coefficients , which we denote collectively by @xmath163 , all scale like a length squared times a frequency , so that    [ eqs:3.4 ] @xmath164 denoting the static exponent for the diffusion coefficient by @xmath165 , defined by @xmath166 , we have found ,    @xmath167    the behavior of the electrical conductivity @xmath168 which is related to the charge diffusion coefficient by means of an einstein relation , @xmath169 , depends on the behavior of @xmath170 .",
    "if @xmath170 has a constant contribution at the amt , then @xmath171 vanishes as @xmath172 , so that    @xmath173    dimensionally , however , all of the thermodynamic susceptibilities scale like an inverse volume times a time , which implies a singular part @xmath174 of @xmath175 that scales like ,    @xmath176    if there is no constant , analytic , background term , then eqs .  ( [ eqs:3.4 ] ) and ( [ eq:3.6 ] ) give ,    @xmath177    in either case , wegner s scaling law @xmath178,@xcite which previously had been believed to hold for the amt as well as for the anderson transition , is violated , unless eq .",
    "( 3.5 ) holds _ and _ @xmath179 .",
    "finally , we note that eqs .",
    "( [ eq:3.5 ] ) and ( [ eq:3.7 ] ) are identical if @xmath180 , and that this result is consistent with wegner scaling apart from the replacement @xmath181 , and with @xmath170 being noncritical across the amt .",
    "however , eq .  ( [ eq:3.2b ] ) shows that this result is not consistent with a vanishing op unless the theory has multiple dynamical scaling exponents.@xcite      an important characteristic of a glass transition is the occurrence of extremely long time scales . while critical slowing down at an ordinary transition means that the critical time scale grows as a power of the correlation length , @xmath182 with @xmath149 the dynamical scaling exponent , at a glass transition the critical time scale grows exponentially with @xmath183    @xmath184    with @xmath185 a microscopic time scale , and @xmath8 a generalized dynamical scaling exponent .",
    "effectively , eq .  ( [ eq:3.8 ] ) implies @xmath186 . as a result of such extreme slowing down ,",
    "the system s equilibrium behavior near the transition becomes inaccessible for all practical purposes .",
    "that is , realizable experimental time scales are not sufficient to reach equilibrium , and one says that the system falls out of equilibrium .",
    "it has been proposed@xcite that the phase transition in classical rf magnets is of this type , and there are experimental observations that seem to corroborate this suggestion .",
    "here we speculate that the analogy between rf magnets and the amt leads to such ` activated ' scaling for the amt as well .",
    "for this quantum phase transition one expects time and inverse temperature to show the same scaling behavior , irrespective of whether the critical slowing down follows an ordinary power law , or eq .",
    "( [ eq:3.8 ] ) .",
    "quantum mechanics thus makes it very difficult to observe the static scaling behavior , since it requires exponentially small temperatures .",
    "thus from eq .",
    "( [ eq:3.8 ] ) we see that static zero temperature scaling will be observed only if    @xmath187    with @xmath188 some microscopic temperature scale on the order of the fermi temperature @xmath189 .",
    "this is potentially a crucial point in the interpretation of experimental data .    activated scaling , as described by eq .",
    "( [ eq:3.8 ] ) , follows from a barrier picture of the system s free energy landscape .",
    "the physical idea we have in mind is that while a repulsive electron - electron interaction always leads to a decrease in the local dos , the random potential can in general lead to an increase in the local dos as well .",
    "the competition between these two effects leads to frustration and to , for example , large insulating clusters within the metallic phase .",
    "delocalizing these large clusters requires energy barriers to be overcome , which are assumed to grow like @xmath190 as the amt is approached .",
    "a further notion of the barrier model is that the frequency or temperature argument of the scaling function is expected to be @xmath191 rather than @xmath192 as in , for example , eq .",
    "( [ eqs:3.2 ] ) and ( [ eqs:3.4 ] ) .",
    "the reason is that one expects a very broad distribution of energy barriers .",
    "the natural , self - averaging , variable is therefore @xmath193 rather than @xmath14 .",
    "it makes physical sense to assume scaling forms only for self - averaging quantities . for a system with quenched disorder",
    "it is known that the free energy is self - averaging , while the partition function is not , and correlation functions in general are not , either .",
    "therefore , all thermodynamic quantities , which can be obtained as partial derivatives of the free energy , are self - averaging . for a general thermodynamic quantity , @xmath194 ,",

    "while in principle this should be straightforward , similar checks for the rf problem have shown that a very large dynamical or temperature range is needed to produce conclusive results .",

    "physically , one of the main results in this second approach is that static or zero - temperature scaling is expected to set in only at exponentially low temperatures , and that for practical purposes it is inaccessible close to the amt .",
    "electron - electron interactions are necessary in order for the amt discussed here to exist , since for noninteracting electrons one has an anderson transition with an uncritical dos.@xcite this point is correctly reflected by the theory since @xmath85 in eq .",
    "( [ eq:2.8a ] ) vanishes for noninteracting systems , so that the critical point discussed here is never reached : for @xmath225 the critical disorder for the amt increases without bound , @xmath226 .",
    "this suggests a number of distinct phase transition scenarios .",
    "the simplest one is that for sufficiently small interaction constants , or large @xmath227 , the amt discussed here gets preempted by some other transition , such as a pure anderson transition . this scenario is particularly likely if @xmath228 , and if the electron - electron interactions are short ranged , since in this case @xmath62 is irrelevant near the anderson transition fp , at least near @xmath229 . for this case a likely phase diagram is shown in fig .  [ fig:1 ] .",
    "a different possibility is that in the above picture the anderson transition is replaced by an amt of a different type than the one discussed here , possibly one that is related to the transition studied near @xmath229 for the case when either @xmath62 and @xmath63 are nonzero , or the electron - electron interaction is of long range.@xcite      in section iii.b we suggested that the amt is a quantum glass transition.@xcite following this notion , our chief results are as follows : ( 1 ) the specific heat and spin susceptibilities are singular as @xmath230 even in the metallic phase .",
    "these results are consistent with existing experiments , and the theory given here provides an alternative to the previous exploration in terms of noninteracting local moments .",
    "( 2 ) the dos is the order parameter for the quantum glass transition . at criticality it is predicted to vanish logarithmically with temperature .",
    "( 3 ) the electrical conductivity @xmath210 is so broadly distributed that it is not a self - averaging quantity , but log @xmath210 is both self - averaging and a scaling quantity .",
    "this result may be relevant to explain the sample - to - sample fluctuations in the conductivity that are observed in si : p at low temperature near the amt .",
