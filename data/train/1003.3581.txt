    "@xmath4 , and finite first moment @xmath5 $ ] . in this paper",
    ", we introduce and describe detailed distributional properties of a class of random time changes @xmath6 , which we call _ quantile clocks_. these processes are defined as , @xmath7 where @xmath0 is a subordinator , and @xmath8 . while applicable in many settings ,",
    "we follow the framework in @xcite and discuss the modeling advantages of quantile clocks as _ business activity times _ in time changed models for asset prices .",
    "the quantile clocks , may be written as special cases of _ convoluted subordinators _ , which are processes described in bender and marquardt @xcite .",
    "that is to say , processes defined as @xmath9 , for @xmath10 a known kernel .",
    "the authors @xcite , proposition 1 , provide mild conditions on @xmath10 and @xmath0 such that a process @xmath11 has almost surely strictly continuous and increasing sample paths . in terms of applications , @xcite argue that one can use @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is a brownian motion with drift , as time changed models for the log price of assets that possess continuous trajectories , where @xmath14 is now interpreted as _ business activity time_. furthermore , such models can correct deficiencies in black  scholes type price models .",
    "in particular , it is known that ( i ) the log returns of asset prices have nonnormal distributions , and often exhibit semi - heavy or heavier tail behavior , ( ii ) the volatility or variance is dependent on time , ( iii ) asset prices exhibit volatility _ clustering _ or _ persistence . _",
    "reference @xcite also describe a general formula for european style option prices that depend on the marginal distribution of @xmath15 for some fixed time to maturity @xmath16 . for other applications of processes representable as convoluted subordinators ,",
    "see , for instance , @xcite and references therein",
    ".    in the literature , exponential lvy price models , defined as @xmath17 for a lvy process @xmath18 on @xmath19 , have been quite successful in terms of their ability to capture some of the stylistic features of asset prices ( i ) and ( ii ) listed above .",
    "in addition , there are many choices of @xmath18 where one can easily calibrate pricing models to the options market , capturing volatility smiles and skews , via monte carlo methods or perhaps more generally by the fast fourier transform ( fft ) methods outlined in carr and madan @xcite . many lvy processes @xmath18 , can be expressed as @xmath20 for some subordinator @xmath21 . however , the precise @xmath21 that is associated with a @xmath18 is not always known explicitly , and @xmath18 is often modeled via its lvy density .",
    "arguably , the most popular models of this type include the variance gamma process ( vg ) by @xcite , where @xmath21 is a gamma subordinator , the carr ",
    "madan  yor ( cgmy ) process @xcite , where @xmath21 has only recently been identified by madan and yor @xcite , and the normal inverse gaussian ( nig ) process @xcite , where @xmath21 is an inverse gaussian process .",
    "the popularity of these models is due to their relative simplicity and distributional flexibility .",
    "however , since @xmath18 has independent increments , exponential lvy processes are unable to capture effects due to volatility clustering .",
    "one approach discussed in @xcite , which is related to the price models in @xcite , is to further time change @xmath18 by a stochastic volatility process of the form @xmath22 , where @xmath23 represents the instantaneous volatility either following a mean reverting cox ",
    "ingersoll  ross ( cir ) process or a non - gaussian ornstein  uhlenbeck ( bns  ou ) model of barndorff - nielsen and shephard @xcite , specified by the dynamics @xmath24 where @xmath25 is a subordinator we shall call an ou  bdlp .",
    "ou model @xmath26 , possesses jumps , and has a stationary distribution with laws equating to the class of laws of self - decomposable random variables that remarkably one can choose based on a prescribed choice of @xmath25 .",
    "this latter fact is important for our exposition .",
    "in contrast , the integrated volatility @xmath22 is continuous and has nontypical marginals laws ( obviously depending on @xmath27 ) . in the case of the cir process",
    ", @xmath26 is a diffusion having a transition density following a noncentral chi - squared distribution .",
    "we will not consider models of this type .",
    "the authors @xcite demonstrate that their approach , involving convoluted subordinators , can be viewed as viable variations of the idea in @xcite .",
    "furthermore , their work essentially contains the popular model of @xcite .",
    "however , as noted by the authors , there are practical issues arising for instance in the pricing of options that relate to the marginal distributions of @xmath15 at maturity times @xmath28 . while @xmath15 are infinitely divisible",
    ", their marginal distributions and also characteristic functions depend on @xmath29 and @xmath28 , in a nontrivial way .",
    "hence , leading in general to nonfamiliar distributions for @xmath15 . related to this point ,",
    "is a classical problem where in general it is not clear how to _ exactly _ sample infinitely divisible random variables , even in the case of a subordinators @xmath30 for each fixed @xmath28 .",
    "some notable exceptions for @xmath21 are gamma , positive stable and inverse gaussian processes whose marginals for each fixed time point are gamma , positive stable and inverse gaussian random variables , and hence are easily sampled . more generally , one can resort to sampling methods based on truncation of infinite series representations , but these do not yield exact samples and it is not always clear how to control the level of accuracy . reference @xcite do point out that if @xmath15 has an analytically tractable characteristic function then one can apply the popular fast fourier transform ( fft ) techniques in carr and madan @xcite to obtain explicit option prices .",
    "they also provide supporting results for some choices of @xmath31 and @xmath0 .",
    "however , due to the generality of @xmath10 , it appears difficult to apply the ( fft ) for option price formula depending on general @xmath15 .",
    "these points do not reflect a deficiency in the approach of @xcite but rather that the class of convoluted subordinators is quite general .",
    "the task then becomes how to choose kernels @xmath31 and subordinators @xmath0 that are convenient in terms of implementation as well as having general modeling flexibility .      in section [ sec3 ] ,",
    "we show that quantile clocks , which arise by setting @xmath32 , can be chosen to have continuous trajectories and in general have marginal distributions that , for each fixed time @xmath27 , equate to a single subordinator @xmath21 .",
    "that is @xmath33 for fixed @xmath27 .",
    "we also highlight a very tractable example related to @xcite . of course , in general , the law @xmath21 , that is , the marginal laws of @xmath34 , depends on @xmath35 , and hence the deterministic quantile function @xmath36 .",
    "however , in section [ sec4 ] , we show that there are many quantile clocks whose marginal distributions can be chosen such that they do not obviously depend on @xmath36 .",
    "in fact for these given @xmath36 , we show that one can choose @xmath0 , and a random variable @xmath37 , such that the marginals of @xmath34 have specific laws in the jurek s @xcite @xmath38 class of _ generalized _ @xmath1-selfdecomposbale laws , for @xmath39 .",
    "these classes contain the important class @xmath40 of self - decomposable distributions on @xmath41 .",
    "see @xcite for the relevance of self - decomposable lvy processes in financial modeling .",
    "this ability to choose specific ( familiar ) marginal laws for price processes , while allowing for quite varied path properties induced by different quantiles  @xmath36 , gives modelers a great deal of flexibility .",
    "it is also reminiscent of how one might choose a bns ",
    "ou model @xmath42 to have a specific stationary distribution , that is , @xmath43 for all fixed @xmath27 , in @xmath40 based on the ou  bdlp @xmath25 appearing in ( [ bnsousde ] ) .",
    "however , recall that @xmath42 has jumps and the law of @xmath34 obviously must depend on @xmath27 .",
    "the precise methods we use to establish these results , and identify @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath0 , are given in sections [ sec4 ] , [ sec5 ] and [ sec6 ] , and should also be of general interest to experts in lvy processes . in section [ sec7 ] ,",
    "we exploit the fact that @xmath33 for each @xmath27 , and we show that compositions ( or time changes ) involving quantiles clocks behave marginally like subordinators . in section [ sec8 ] , we show that as consequences of our results , that we are able to identify price processes whose marginal behavior coincides with those of exponential lvy price processes . in particular , we identify explicitly many processes whose marginal distributions are equivalent to vg , cgmy and nig price processes , but whose trajectories are continuous and otherwise quite varied , and additionally exhibit volatility clustering .",
    "we also identify models possessing jumps that otherwise have the properties mentioned above . in section [ sec9 ] ,",
    "we show how one can use our results for quantile clocks to specify laws for the convoluted subordinator referred as a short memory kernel in @xcite .",
    "while quantile clocks are our main focus , in section [ sec2 ] , we also describe results that apply to the practical implementation of log price models @xmath12 , considered in @xcite , where @xmath14 is based on a general kernel @xmath10 . in particlar , if @xmath0 is chosen to have laws in the class of generalized gamma convolutions with finite thorin measure , see @xcite , call this class @xmath44 , then the random variable @xmath15 can be exactly sampled in many instances .",
    "this is based on a very recent work of devroye and james @xcite where a double coupling from the past ( double cftp ) perfect sampling routine is devised , and also results described in james @xcite .",
    "furthermore , for this choice of @xmath0 , by using a deterministic time - change we obtain a simplified version of the option price formulae given in @xcite .",
    "we now present some concepts and notation we shall use throughout .",
    "first , for fixed positive numbers @xmath45 , let @xmath46 denote a @xmath47 random variable with shape parameter @xmath48 and scale @xmath49 , let @xmath50 denote a beta @xmath45 random variable .",
    "furthermore , @xmath51 will always denote a uniform@xmath52 $ ] variable , and recall that for any @xmath39 , @xmath53 .",
    "@xmath54 is a bernoulli random variable with success probability @xmath55 .",
    "in addition for a generic random variable @xmath37 , @xmath56 will denote a variable equivalent in distribution but otherwise independent .",
    "@xmath57 will denote a homogeneous poisson process with intensity @xmath58=s$ ] .",
    "for a ( nonrandom ) function @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 with denote its first and second derivatives .    formally , recall that a subordinator @xmath62 , is an increasing process with right continuous paths and stationary independent increments , whose law is specified by its laplace transform for some @xmath63 @xmath64={{\\mathrm{e}}}^{-t\\psi_{\\zeta } ( \\omega)},\\ ] ] where for some @xmath65",
    ", @xmath63 @xmath66 is finite and is called the _ laplace exponent _ of @xmath21 , @xmath67 is its lvy measure , @xmath68 is the lvy density .",
    "we will work with the case where @xmath69 .",
    "it follows that the laws of @xmath21 can be specified by any of these quantities .",
    "@xmath21 is said to be of _ infinite activity _ if @xmath70 and otherwise of _ finite activity_. in the latter case , @xmath21 corresponds to compound poisson process whose jumps have a common probability density / mass function proportional to @xmath71 . throughout we shall reserve the notation @xmath72 for generic subordinators , and corresponding random variables , and the notation @xmath25 for the ou  bdlp .",
    "as is well known , for each fixed @xmath27 , @xmath73 is a random variable in the class @xmath74 of infinitely divisible random variables ( taking values in @xmath41 ) .",
    "we now describe the characteristics of some important subclasses of @xmath74 , say @xmath75 and @xmath44 , satisfying @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "we say that a random variable @xmath78 is in the class @xmath40 of self - decomposable variables if @xmath79 , with @xmath80 decreasing .",
    "we also note that from jurek and vervaat @xcite that , with respect to the ou process in ( [ bnsousde ] ) , there is the relationship @xmath81 note that we will say that @xmath21 is a subordinator in @xmath40 to mean that it is a subordinator whose lvy density corresponds to that of a variable in @xmath40 , of course @xmath73 is in @xmath40 for each fixed @xmath27 .",
    "similar statements will apply for other classes .",
    "we say that @xmath78 is a variable in bondesson s @xcite , section 9 , @xmath82 class , or the class of generalized convolutions of mixtures of exponential distributions ( gcmed ) , if the lvy density is completely monotone , that is , @xmath83 , for some nonnegative measure @xmath84 .",
    "we now describe the classes @xmath85 and @xmath44 .",
    "@xmath78 is a variable that is a generalized gamma convolutions ( ggc ) , see @xcite , if it is in the class @xmath85 , characterized by @xmath86 for some sigma - finite measure @xmath87 , formally known as a thorin measure .",
    "we say that @xmath21 is a @xmath88 subordinator .",

    "moreover , @xmath73 is a @xmath93 variable for each fixed @xmath27 , and @xmath21 is referred to as a @xmath92 subordinator .",
    "we now highlight some important properties of @xmath92 random variables , and subordinators that for instance allow them to be exactly sampled by the methods in @xcite .",
    "these facts can found in @xcite as well as @xcite , and depend heavily on the results for dirichlet means in @xcite . letting @xmath94 denote a @xmath92 subordinator , it follows that @xmath95 .",

    "can be set to @xmath114 , for some integer @xmath115 and @xmath112 , it follows that @xmath116 can be exactly sampled by at most exactly sampling @xmath115 copies of the random variable @xmath117 .",
    "we note that in general @xmath118 for @xmath90 , does not have a simple expression for its density .",
    "so the exact sampling method suggested above relies solely on the ability to sample the variable in @xmath107 in ( [ uni ] ) , for each @xmath55 .",
    "this is possible provided that @xmath110 is analytically tractable .",
    "however , since @xmath3 can be quite arbitrary this will not always be true .",
    "fortunately , there is the recent double cftp perfect sampling method by @xcite that can be used to exactly sample any of the variables satisfying ( [ recursionm ] ) , ( [ recursionm2 ] ) or ( [ uni ] ) .",
    "this procedure applies provided that @xmath3 is a bounded variable and one has a method to sample @xmath3 , but otherwise does not require any potentially complicated calculations .",
    "hence , any @xmath101 variable , with @xmath3 bounded , can be exactly sampled by drawing an independent gamma variable and applying the double cftp .",
