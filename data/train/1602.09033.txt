    "synchrotron radiation is of extreme importance in many relativistic plasma and is widely prevalent in extragalactic radio sources , supernovae remnants , the galaxy , and many other astrophysical phenomena .",
    "a power - law spectrum is the main characteristic of this radiation process .",
    "as electrons emit radiation and thereby lose energy , the radiation spectrum steepens .",
    "this steepening of the spectrum causes even a break in the spectrum slope .",
    "this break is a direct indication of the radiative life - time of electrons and tells us about the age of the source of synchrotron radiation .",
    "therefore it is important to understand these radiation losses in detail .",
    "formulas for synchrotron radiative losses were derived more than about 50 years back and have been in use ever since for calculating radiative losses in a variety of radio sources . in these formulas",
    ", it has always been assumed that the pitch angle of the radiating charged particle remains constant and the dynamics and the life - time of radiating electrons are accordingly derived @xcite .",
    "this formulation is now a standard text - book material @xcite .",
    "however , it turns out that this formulation is not relativistically covariant .",
    "it will be shown here that in the case of synchrotron losses , the pitch angle in general changes .",
    "we shall derive the exact formulation for radiative losses , taking into account the pitch angle changes .",
    "we use gaussian ( cgs ) system of units throughout .",
    "a relativistic charged particle , say , an electron of charge @xmath0 , rest mass @xmath1 , having a velocity @xmath2 and energy @xmath3 ( with lorentz factor @xmath4 ) , moves in a magnetic field @xmath5 in a helical path with @xmath6 as the pitch angle , defined as the angle that the velocity vector makes with the magnetic field direction .",
    "we assume the magnetic field to be uniform , say , along the z - axis ( fig.(1 ) ) .",
    "as there is no force component due to the magnetic field parallel to itself , a charge with a velocity component @xmath7 only along the @xmath8-axis keeps on moving unaffected by the field .     along pitch angle @xmath6 in a uniform magnetic field @xmath9 .",
    "@xmath10 is the velocity component parallel to @xmath9 while @xmath11 is the perpendicular velocity component . ]",
    "the charge spiraling in a magnetic field radiates in the forward direction of its instantaneous motion . for a highly relativistic motion of the charge , like in a synchrotron case , all the radiated power , as calculated from larmor s formula ( or rather from linard s formula ) , is confined to a narrow cone of angle @xmath12 around the instantaneous direction of motion of the charge .",
    "therefore the momentum carried by the radiation will be along the direction of motion of the charge . from the conservation of momentum",
    "it can then be construed that the radiation should cause only a decrease in the magnitude of the velocity vector without affecting its direction . as a result",
    "it is expected that the pitch angle @xmath6 of the motion should not change due to radiative losses @xcite .",
    "thus the ratio @xmath13 , will not change .    with the pitch angle as a constant of motion , half life - times of radiating electrons",
    "have been calculated , using an approximate power loss formula @xcite , @xmath14 where @xmath15 .",
    "let @xmath16 be the initial energy at @xmath17 , then from eq .",
    "( [ eq:30.1 ] ) the energy of the radiating charge at @xmath18 is calculated to be , @xmath19 from eq .",
    "( [ eq:30.4 ] ) it follows that the electron loses half of its energy in a time @xmath20 .",
    "one thing we note from eq .",
    "( [ eq:30.4 ] ) is that it can be true only for a highly relativistic charge ( @xmath21 ) and that it is not a general equation .",
    "this can be seen immediately from @xmath22 , where @xmath23 implying @xmath24 , while we know that @xmath25 always . actually an approximation @xmath26 has been used right from the beginning and instead of eq .",
    "( [ eq:30.1 ] ) , the exact equation for the energy loss rate is @xcite , @xmath27 we can rewrite the power loss rate in terms of the lorentz factor @xmath28 ( @xmath29 , which implies expressing energy in units of the rest mass energy ) , to write , @xmath30 here @xmath31 .",
    "consider a charge particle in its gyrocenter ( gc ) frame @xmath32 , which is moving with a velocity @xmath7 with respect to the lab frame @xmath33 . in @xmath32",
    "therefore the charge has no component of velocity parallel to the magnetic field and has only a circular motion in a plane perpendicular to the magnetic field ( with a pitch angle @xmath34 ) . in this frame , due to radiative losses by the charge",
    ", there will be a decrease in the velocity which is solely in a plane perpendicular to the magnetic field , and the charge will never ever attain a velocity component parallel to the magnetic field .",
    "now we look at this particle from the lab frame @xmath33 , in which the charge has ( at least to begin with ) a motion , @xmath7 along the magnetic field .",
    "since in the inertial frame @xmath32 , the charge never gets a velocity component parallel to the magnetic field and the two inertial frames ( @xmath33 and @xmath32 ) continue to move with reference to each other with a constant @xmath35 , the parallel component of velocity of the charge should remain unchanged even in @xmath33 .",
    "however , magnitude of the perpendicular component of velocity is continuously decreasing because of radiative losses , therefore the pitch angle of the charge , @xmath36 , should decrease continuously with time and the velocity vector of the charge should increasingly align with the magnetic field vector .",
    "thus we have a paradox here . while conservation of momentum argument led us to the conclusion that the pitch angle of the charge is a constant , the second argument from relativistic transformation considerations showed that the pitch angle will be progressively reducing as the charge radiates with time . which of the two is true then ?",
    "it turns out that the second argument is correct and we shall show that the pitch angles of the radiating charges decrease continuously and due to that their angular distribution in the momentum space changes with time .",
    "even if to begin with there were an isotropic energy distribution of electrons in a synchrotron source , electrons radiating synchrotron radiation develop a pitch angle anisotropy because of @xmath37 dependence of the radiated power ( eq .  ( [ eq:30.2 ] ) ) .",
    "then there is the additional fact that the pitch angle of radiating electrons monotonically decreases with time , and as we shall show the rate of change of the pitch angle depends upon the value of the pitch angle itself .    instead of calculating the effects of radiation on charge energy from larmor s formula ( or its relativistic generalization linard s formula )",
    "if we use the lorentz s radiation reaction formula and apply it in frame @xmath32 , we get a force along @xmath38 , which is in a direction opposite to the velocity vector in @xmath32 , and the charge accordingly would have a deceleration vector only in a plane perpendicular to the magnetic field .",
    "it should be noted that in all reference frames gyro acceleration @xmath39 always lies in the plane perpendicular to the magnetic field and so is the vector @xmath40 therefore . and a relativistic transformation of acceleration due to radiation losses , between frames @xmath33 to @xmath32 , gives a non - zero vector only along the direction perpendicular to the magnetic field and a nil acceleration along the parallel direction @xcite , consistent with conclusions reached based on the theory of relativity .",
    "there is another way of arriving at the paradox .",
    "larmor s formula says that a charge moving with non - relativistic speeds radiates energy at a rate @xmath41 .",
    "however , the radiation pattern of such a charge has a @xmath42 dependence @xcite , about the direction of acceleration . due to this azimuthal symmetry the net momentum carried by the radiation is nil .",
    "therefore the charge too can not be losing momentum .",
    "thus we have the paradox of a radiating charge losing its kinetic energy but without a corresponding change in its momentum .",
    "we first calculate the power losses in the gc frame @xmath32 , where pitch angle is a constant ( @xmath34 ) and thus the standard formulation should be applicable , and then using special relativistic transformations , convert them to the lab frame @xmath33 .    in the gc frame",
    "@xmath32 , there is no motion along the @xmath8 direction and the charge moves in a circle in the @xmath43-@xmath44 plane .",
    "the velocity @xmath45 of the charge as well as the force @xmath46 due to radiation losses are perpendicular to the @xmath47-axis in frame @xmath32 and there is hardly any ambiguity about that . from the 4-force transformation @xcite to the lab frame @xmath33 , with respect to which the gc frame @xmath32 is moving along the @xmath8 direction with a velocity @xmath35 , we get , @xmath48 @xmath49    there is of course no acceleration component @xmath50 along the @xmath8-axis , even though a finite parallel force component @xmath51 exists . from a relativistic transformation of acceleration",
    "@xcite we can verify that there is no parallel component of acceleration in frame @xmath33 if it is zero in frame @xmath32 ( i.e. , @xmath52 if @xmath53 ) .",
    "actually in frame @xmath33 , a force component along @xmath8 direction shows up solely because of a rate of change of @xmath28 due to @xmath54 , even though @xmath52 .",
    "it can be recalled that in special relativity , force and acceleration vectors are not always parallel , e.g. , in a case where force is not parallel to the velocity vector , the acceleration need not be along the direction of the force .",
    "when the applied force is either parallel to or perpendicular to the velocity vector , it is only then that the acceleration is along the direction of force @xcite .",
    "it has to be further kept in mind that the acceleration we are talking about here is not that due to the force by the magnetic field on the moving charge ( which is perpendicular to the instantaneously velocity of the charge ) , but the acceleration ( or rather a deceleration ) caused on the charge due to the radiation reaction force .",
    "an alternative derivation of radiation losses and the pitch angle changes based on radiation reaction force is available in singal @xcite .    in eq .",
    "( [ eq:30.2 ] ) @xmath55 is a variable , but we can write this equation for the gc frame @xmath32 , where pitch angle is always a constant ( @xmath56 )",
    ". then we have , @xmath57    equation  ( [ eq:30.7 ] ) has a solution , @xmath58 let @xmath59 be the initial energy at @xmath60 in frame @xmath32 , then @xmath61 and at time @xmath62 we have , @xmath63 which complies with the expectations that as @xmath64 , @xmath65 .    now a transformation between @xmath32 and @xmath33 gives @xmath66 and @xmath67 or @xmath68 @xcite .",
    "also we have @xmath69 or @xmath70 . for the transformation of acceleration",
    "we then get @xmath71 with @xmath72 .    equation  ( [ eq:30.2e3 ] ) can then be transformed in terms of quantities expresses in the lab frame @xmath33 , @xmath73 this is a general solution for all values of @xmath28 .",
    "we can rewrite it as , @xmath74 for an initially ultra relativistic charge ( @xmath75 ) , we have @xmath76 .",
    "that also implies that ( except for initially small pitch angle cases ) @xmath77 or @xmath78 , and from eq .",
    "( [ eq:30.2e4 ] ) we could write , @xmath79 this implies that for @xmath80 , we have @xmath81 . thus even if an electron had started with an almost infinite energy , it loses most of its kinetic energy in a time interval of the order of @xmath82 , reducing to perhaps a mildly relativistic status ( for not too small an initial pitch angle ) . for instance let us consider @xmath83 and @xmath84 , then @xmath85 , then from eq .",
    "( [ eq:30.2e4 ] ) or eq .",
    "( [ eq:30.2e1a ] ) we get for @xmath86 , @xmath87 . in another example , taking @xmath88 and @xmath89 , for @xmath86 we get @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "thus @xmath82 represents the characteristic decay time of synchrotron electrons over which they turn from ultra relativistic into mildly relativistic ones .",
    "equation  ( [ eq:30.7 ] ) can be also written as , @xmath92 or @xmath93    then transforming to the lab frame @xmath33 we have , @xmath94 both @xmath95 and @xmath6 in @xmath96 are functions of time .",
    "therefore we can rewrite eq .",
    "( [ eq:30.8c ] ) as , @xmath97 also from @xmath98 we get , @xmath99 eliminating @xmath100 from eqs .",
    "( [ eq:30.6c1 ] ) and ( [ eq:30.6d ] ) , we get , @xmath101 this is the relation for the rate of change of the pitch angle of a charge undergoing synchrotron radiative losses .",
    "the negative sign implies that the pitch angle decreases with time and the velocity vector gets increasingly aligned with the magnetic field .",
    "the rate of alignment is very slow for low pitch angles ( @xmath102 ) as well as for high pitch angles ( @xmath103 ) , and the highest rate of change of the pitch angle is for @xmath104 .      in eq .",
    "( [ eq:30.6i ] ) , @xmath109 , because pitch angle always reduces with time .",
    "there are many notable points .",
    "if @xmath110 , then @xmath111 also , which is because if the pitch angle is @xmath112 , then the radiating electron always moves in a circular path in the plane perpendicular to the magnetic field . and",
    "if @xmath113 , then @xmath114 too as there is no more reduction in the pitch angle . for any @xmath115 , @xmath116 as @xmath117 . for large @xmath118 values , @xmath119 which can be used to estimate change in pitch angle with time .",
    "for example for say , @xmath120 , and @xmath121 , @xmath122 , which gives @xmath123 for this change in the pitch angle .",
    "thus there are appreciable pitch angle changes in time @xmath124 ( except for in the vicinity of very small pitch angles ) .",
    "all charges of a given energy and pitch angles , directed towards the observer in a narrow angle @xmath12 around the line of sight not only lose energy but will also get shifted outside the angle @xmath12 around the line of sight towards the observer , in a time @xmath124 .",
    "thus in a mono - energetic and a narrow pitch angle distribution , the pitch angle changes might be quite relevant .",
    "but it may be of less importance when there is a wide angular ( isotropic ! ) distribution of pitch angles .",
