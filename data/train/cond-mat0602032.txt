    "recent experiments @xcite on trapped ultracold atoms have refocused theoretical attention on pairing between distinct fermion species , in situations in which the densities of the two species are unequal . in these experiments",
    "unequal numbers of two hyperfine states of fermionic @xmath0li atoms were mixed and scanned across a feshbach resonance .",
    "on one side of the resonance the fermions bind to form a bosonic molecule which can condense into a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) , while on the other side they experience a weak attractive interaction which leads to formation of cooper pairs in a bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) state .",
    "when the densities of the hyperfine species are unbalanced , some fermions are unpaired , and this raises the possibility of co - existence of a bosonic condensate and one or more fermi surfaces in the ground state .",
    "this paper will describe the constraints that luttinger s theorem places on the volumes enclosed by fermi surfaces under such conditions .",
    "such constraints are distinct in different phases , and we will also describe the quantum phase transitions across which the statement of luttinger s theorem changes .",
    "we note that these fermi surface volume constraints are exact , and apply even in strongly interacting regimes where the fermions fluctuate into bosonic molecular states at short scales . in such situations short - range spectroscopic observables may indicate that fermions exist in molecules , but the true ground state will nevertheless have the undiminished fermi surface volume(s ) , albeit with a reduced quasiparticle residue at the fermi surface .",
    "our results indicate that the volumes of the fermi surfaces are sensitive to the presence or absence of a bose condensate of the molecules ; thus they can also be used to probe superfluidity or pair coherence . in principle",
    "the fermi surface volumes can be measured from the momentum distributions of the atoms .",
    "such a measurement was recently performed in a gas of @xmath1k across a feshbach resonance@xcite . in this experiment",
    "the effect of the trap on the momentum distribution appears to be quite strong , such that the discontinuity in momentum distribution gets wiped out even for non - interacting fermions .",
    "we hope that by manipulating the form of the trap potential , its effect can be minimized so that discontinuities in momentum distribution associated with fermi surfaces can be detected in future experiments ; this would probably require a trap potential that is flat inside the trap and rises very fast near the boundary .",
    "we note that luttinger s theorem for bose - fermi mixtures has also been investigated in recent work @xcite in which a boson and a fermion bind to form a fermionic molecular state . here",
    "we will show that these results can be straightforwardly extended to the case of interest to the recent atomic experiments : two fermions binding to form a bosonic molecular state .",
    "we also use non - perturbative arguments similar to those of yamanaka , oshikawa and affleck @xcite to establish analogous results in one dimension .",
    "our results are rather general , and apply to a wide class of hamiltonians of the form @xmath2 where @xmath3 are annihilation operators of the two fermion species , @xmath4 is the annihilation operator of the bosonic molecule , @xmath5 and @xmath6 involve fermionic and bosonic operators only ( which contain their kinetic energies and may also include additional interactions ) .",

    "@xmath10 is the ` field ' which unbalances the fermion densities , and @xmath11 is the ` detuning ' across the feshbach resonance which scans between the bcs and bec limits .",

    "we conclude this paper by presenting the field theories controlling the various quantum phase transitions and multicritical points in fig .",
    "[ phase ] in the following subsections .",
    "some aspects of these theories were also discussed in ref .  .",
    "we begin with the transition between the 2fs and 1fs phases at large @xmath10 . here",
    "a fermi surface gradually shrinks to zero volume , in the absence of any bosonic condensate . denoting the fermionic quasiparticle excitations of this small fermi surface by @xmath86 , and following the analysis of the dilute fermi gas critical point in chapter 11 of ref .",
    ", we initially guess that the critical theory is given by the free fermion form @xmath87 where @xmath88 is imaginary time , and @xmath89 is the parameter which tunes across the transition . in this case",
    ", the quantum critical point is at @xmath90 , and the small fermi surface is present for @xmath91 .",
    "the simplest four fermi interaction must involve two gradients because of the pauli principle , and is of the form @xmath92 .",
    "a scaling analysis with dynamic exponent @xmath93 @xcite shows that the dimension of this term is @xmath94 , and so such interactions are always irrelevant .",
    "however , here we have a second large fermi surface present , and we have to allow for long - range interactions induced by the fluctuations of this fermi surface .",
    "the oscillations of this second fermi surface will couple to @xmath95 , and integrating these out following hertz @xcite we obtain the following long - range interaction ( for @xmath96 ) @xmath97_{{\\bf k } , \\omega } \\",
    ", \\frac{|\\omega|}{k } \\ , [ \\psi^\\dagger \\psi]_{-{\\bf k } , -\\omega } \\label{zs}\\ ] ] power - counting with @xmath93 shows that @xmath98 has scaling dimension @xmath99 , and so is irrelevant .",
    "the @xmath100 case requires special treatment , and we will not consider it here .",
    "this is just like the 2fs/1fs transition above , except that a background bose condensate is present .",
    "fluctuations in the superflow of this condensate induce long - range interactions , which could be important at the critical point . with @xmath101 being the phase of the condensate , the coupling to the @xmath86 excitations of the current - current type @xcite : @xmath102 . integrating out the @xmath101 , we now generate the interaction @xmath103 again , simple power - counting shows that this term has scaling dimension @xmath94 , and so is irrelevant .",
    "so the critical theory remains the free fermion theory @xmath104 .",
    "this is a novel transition involving the simultaneous appearance of two fermi surfaces at a spherical minimum in the fermionic quasiparticle dispersion .",
    "this was considered in a separate paper @xcite for the case of non - singular ( or short - range ) fermionic interactions .",
    "the superflow fluctuations will also introduce here an interaction between the fermions of the form in eq .",
    "( [ superflow ] ) . because we are now interested in fermions at large momentum fermi surface , the @xmath105 in eq .",
    "( [ superflow ] ) will be replaced by @xmath106 , where @xmath107 is the minimum of the fermion dispersion ( that forms a sphere ; it also becomes the fermi wavevector once fermions start to populate these modes ) , and @xmath108 is its normal direction .",
    "this changes the power - counting in the scaling dimension of this coupling .",
    "we discuss the renormalization group ( rg ) flow of such anisotropic , long - range interactions below .    as discussed in ref . , the relevant fermionic modes near the critical point are those within a thin spherical shell in momentum space : @xmath109 , where @xmath110 is a cutoff scale .",
    "phase space restriction thus divide the possible scattering processes into two classes , which need to be treated separately : + ( _ i _ ) the cooper channel , in which @xmath111 , and the momentum transfer @xmath112 can be as large as @xmath113 . in this channel",
    "the interaction of eq .",
    "( [ superflow ] ) simply reduces to those studied in ref . , and",
    "the results there can be applied directly to the present case .",
    "+ ( _ ii _ ) forward scattering channel , in which @xmath114 , and the magnitude of momentum transfer is constrained to be @xmath115 . in the absence of long - range interactions",
    ", we can then take the limit @xmath116 , and assume that there is no further dependence on its orientation @xmath117 .",
    "however , with the anisotropic long - range interactions induced by superflow fluctuations in eq .",
    "( [ superflow ] ) , the limit of vanishing @xmath118 can be taken , but there remains a residual dependence on @xmath119 .",
    "here we perform an rg analysis of the most general interaction of fermions on the fermi surface dependent upon @xmath117 , and for simplicity focus on two - dimensional ( 2d ) systems ; the situation in 3d is expected to be similar qualitatively .",
    "such an interaction takes the following form in 2d : @xmath120 where @xmath121 is the angle between @xmath122 and @xmath123 , and @xmath124 is the angle between @xmath125 and @xmath126 . for short - range interactions only the @xmath127 term exists , and",
    "this case was analyzed in ref .  .",
    "the interaction in eq .",
    "( [ superflow ] ) generates a term with @xmath128 .",
    "we now perform a one - loop rg analysis @xcite of the interactions in eq .",

    "it is clear from eq .",
    "( [ flow ] ) that only @xmath134 gets renormalized under rg transformations , while interactions with @xmath135 remains marginal .",
    "physically this is because the renomalization is due to multiple virtual scattering processes whose momentum transfers are of order the cutoff @xmath136 , resulting in renomalization that is not sensitive to the net momentum transfer much smaller than @xmath136 at low - energy .",
    "thus the @xmath137 quasiparticle interactions remain at their bare values , and are finite and non - universal in the low - energy limit . for the case of the quantum phase transition of interest in this subsection , the @xmath128 interaction in eq .",
    "( [ superflow ] ) therefore acquires no loop corrections .",
    "furthermore , in the presence of @xmath138 , @xmath134 will always be driven negative and flow away , even if it is initially positive ( or repulsive ) .",
    "the situation was very different when only the short - range interaction @xmath134 was present ; in that case it was found @xcite that for repulsive interactions , it flows to zero logarithmically , which leads to an effective quasiparticle interaction that takes a universal form in the low - energy limit due to this renormalization .",
    "here , we observe from eq .",
    "( [ flow2 ] ) that the @xmath128 interactions leads to a _ run - away _ flow of @xmath134 that has no fixed point .",
    "physically , this suggests that either the transition from bec to 2fs+bec is first order , or that the instability of the bec in this case is toward a state with other symmetry properties , like the fflo state .",
    "we note that related observations were made in ref . based on quite different considerations .",
    "this involves the appearance of a bec in the presence of fermi surface .",

    "however , this coupling is _ dangerously _ irrelevant , because a @xmath143 is required to stabilize the system for @xmath144 .",
    "couplings to fermi surface fluctuations will induce a long - range interaction analogous to eq .",

    "( [ zs ] ) however , power - counting near a @xmath93 transition shows that this coupling has scaling dimension @xmath99 , and so is irrelevant .",
    "the considerations for this are nearly identical to the 1fs/1fs+bec transition discussed above . here",
    ", we also have to consider the decay of a boson into two fermions , one each on the respective fermi surfaces . however , this is a low energy process only at finite wavevectors which connect the the two fermi surfaces .",
    "consequently it can be safely neglected for the low momentum @xmath4 critical theory .",
    "the theory for this point is essentially the direct sum of the theories for the two transition lines which intersect at m. there is a bosonic critical mode , @xmath4 , described by @xmath146 , and a fermionic critical mode @xmath86 , described by @xmath104 .",
    "these two critical modes can interact with each other via the contact term @xmath147 and @xmath148 has dimension @xmath141 .",
    "so it will have appreciable effects in @xmath149 which can be computed along the lines of ref .  .",
    "the coupling @xmath148 will also be very important in @xmath100 .",
    "this is a ` lifshitz ' point , which was considered in ref .  ,",
    "albeit with a different perspective .",
    "this is the point where the fermionic dispersion minimum moves from @xmath150 to a non - zero @xmath151 .",
    "consequently , the dispersion at small @xmath152 is @xmath153 , and the multicritical theory has @xmath154 : @xmath155 the simplest four fermi interaction is again @xmath92 , and a scaling analysis with @xmath154 shows that this has scaling dimension @xmath141 .",
    "the superflow fluctuations will also induce a long range interaction as in eq .",
    "( [ superflow ] ) , and this again has scaling dimension @xmath141 .",
