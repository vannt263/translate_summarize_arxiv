    "the inference of the three - dimensional structure of the magnetic field in a source of synchrotron radiation from the observed emission at a single frequency is not unique , but considerable progress can be made if well - resolved images of total intensity and linear polarization are available .",

    "our fundamental assumption about the field structure is that it is random on small scales , but made anisotropic by shear and compression . given the large number of observed data points , the need to integrate along the line of sight and the iteration required to optimize the fit between model and data , we found that existing algorithms for the calculation of synchrotron emissivity from disordered fields were too cumbersome . in order to minimize the resulting computation ,",
    "we have developed an efficient method of evaluating the stokes parameters @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 for synchrotron radiation from electrons radiating in a three - dimensional , anisotropic magnetic field .",
    "this technique should be applicable to a variety of astrophysical synchrotron sources and is the subject of the present paper .",
    "the basic theory of synchrotron emission from an optically - thin power - law energy distribution of relativistic electrons @xmath3 is well - documented ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the spectrum of the emitted radiation also has a power - law form with spectral index @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) . for a uniform field , @xmath6 , at an angle @xmath7 to the line of sight",
    ", the emissivity is @xmath8 and the degree of polarization has its maximum value @xmath9 . the observed @xmath10-vector is perpendicular to the projected field direction on the sky in the absence of propagation effects .",
    "@xcite pointed out that the same results hold for a one - dimensional disordered field with many reversals : @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 depend only on the orientation of the field , not on its vector direction .",
    "expressions for synchrotron emission from a two - dimensional disordered field with equal component variances along two orthogonal directions and no component in the third were derived by @xcite , and discussed further by @xcite .",
    "the more general case of an initially isotropic field compressed by an arbitrary factor along one direction was considered by @xcite .",
    "these authors wrote down expressions for elements of field in terms of spherical polar angles and averaged over the angles to derive the emitted stokes parameters . for a field structure described by one compression factor ,",

    "their formulae also include the effects of inverse compton and synchrotron losses , which cause a deviation of the emitted spectrum from a power - law form . in this paper , we describe a simplified version of their method , which applies to the three - dimensional case , but is restricted to power - law spectra .",

    "we make the conventional assumptions that the pitch - angle distribution of radiating electrons is isotropic .",
    "the observing frequency is taken to be high enough that faraday rotation may be neglected , or corrected accurately .",
    "the magnetic field is assumed to be disordered on small scales with zero mean .",
    "we and others have argued that this is likely to be a good approximation for extragalactic radio sources , except perhaps on the smallest linear scales ( @xcite ; laing & bridle , in preparation ) .",
    "we note , however , that if one of the three field components is vector - ordered , then the results of our emissivity calculations are unaltered .      following ms ,",
