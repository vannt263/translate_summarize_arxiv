    "the description of exclusive diffractive processes has been proposed as a probe of the quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) dynamics in the high energy limit ( for a recent reviews see , e.g. ref .",
    "it is expected that the study of these processes provide insight into the parton dynamics of the diffractive exchange when a hard scale is present . in particular , the diffractive vector meson and photon production at large momentum transfer is expected to probe the qcd pomeron , which is described by the balitsky , fadin , kuraev , and lipatov ( bfkl ) equation @xcite . in the last years , the h1 and zeus collaborations at desy - hera have measured the exclusive production of @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 with hadron dissociation and large values of @xmath4 , the square of the four - momentum transferred across the associated rapidity gap .",

    "@xcite indicate that this approach describes the energy dependence of the cross section but it is unable to describe its @xmath4 dependence .",
    "it is important to emphasize that in @xcite the free parameters present in the bfkl formalism at leading order has been constrained using the experimental data for the total cross section and the differential cross section was predicted and compared with the data .",
    "this procedure is the opposed from that used in refs .",
    "@xcite in order to describe the vector meson data , where the experimental data for the differential cross section for a fixed energy were used to constrain the free parameters and the energy dependence of the total cross section was predicted by the lo bfkl equation .",
    "the possibility that the use of a different procedure allow us to obtain a better description of the experimental data is our first motivation to revisit the description of the diffractive photon production in the bfkl formalism .",
    "the second one is associated to the fact that in the last years the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) corrections to the bfkl kernel were determined @xcite and the origin of the instabilities in the perturbative series was understand and the problem was solved using methods based on the combination of collinear and small-@xmath5 resummations @xcite .",
    "it allow us to include , for the first time , the nlo corrections for the bfkl characteristic function in the analysis of the diffractive photon production at large-@xmath4 .",
    "this is a first step in the direction of a full nlo calculation , since we are not including the nlo corrections to the impact factor associated to the photon - photon transition .",
    "it has been calculated in refs . @xcite and",
    "its analytical form was recently presented in @xcite .",
    "thus , we are aware that our phenomenological study is a educated guess to a complete nlo calculation . however , we hope that this gives some enlightenments about the underlying qcd dynamics .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section we present a brief discussion about the diffractive photon production at large-@xmath6 in @xmath7 collisions . in section [ sec : bfkl ] we present the formalism for the calculation of the cross section is presented and the next - to - leading order corrections to the bfkl kernel are briefly revised , as well as , the different schemes used to improve the convergence of the perturbative series . in section [ sec : res ] we present our predictions and compare with the available data . finally , a summary of our main conclusions is presented in section [ sec : concl ] .",
    "diffractive processes such as @xmath8 , where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are hadronic systems of the dissociated photon and proton , respectively , have been studied extensively at hera in the last decades ( for a recent review see , e.g. , ref .",
    "one of the cleanest of the diffractive processes is that of diffractive photon production ( @xmath11 ) , with the final state photon having a large transverse momentum and being well separated in rapidity from the hadronic system @xmath10 .",
    "the cross section for the process of electron - proton scattering measured in hera is directly related with photon - proton scattering by the relation  @xcite , @xmath12 where @xmath13 , @xmath14 is the center - of - mass energy of the @xmath15 system and @xmath16 is the weizscker - williams approximation of the flux of photons produced by the electron given by @xcite @xmath17\\,\\,.\\ ] ] in the photoproduction regime studied by the h1 collaboration , this flux is integrated over the range @xmath18{gev^2}$ ]  @xcite , which implies @xmath19,\\ ] ] with @xmath20 .",

    "[ fig : proc ] ) . in this regime ,",
    "the cross section for the process photon - proton can be fully calculated in the factor impact representation and is given by the convolution of the hard partonic cross - section with the parton distribution function in the proton @xcite .",

    "the basic idea is that at large - @xmath4 , the gluonic ladder probes a parton inside the target and the struck parton initiates a jet which carries the fraction @xmath27 of the longitudinal momentum of the incoming hadron , being given by @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the mass of the products of the target dissociation and @xmath30 is the mass of the target .",
    "the minimum value of @xmath27 , @xmath31 , is calculated considering the experimental cuts on @xmath29 . in what follows we consider a fixed value @xmath32 following ref . @xcite and the theoretical studies presented in refs .",

    "the photon and the jet are separated by a large rapidity gap among them .",
    "the diffractive photon production can be modelled in the rest frame of the proton by a sequence of three events : first , the fluctuation of the incoming photon into a quark - antiquark pair a long distance from the proton target .",
    "second , the pair interacts with the parton @xmath33 via the exchange of a color singlet state ( the gluon ladder ) .",

    "the main advantage present in photon production is that the theoretical calculations are simplified by the absence of a vector meson wave function , with the only non - perturbative part being the parton distribution functions of the proton .",
    "however , the cross section is suppressed relative to that of vector meson production by the electromagnetic coupling of the @xmath34 pair to the final state photon . in the next section we present a brief review of the description of this process in the bfkl formalism",
    "the energy and momentum transfer dependences of the cross section for the diffractive photon production is directly related to the description of the differential cross section for the partonic process @xmath26 , which can be expressed by @xcite , @xmath35 where the scattering amplitudes @xmath36 depend of the polarization states of the photons ( represented by the plus / minus signs ) through the impact factors for the transition @xmath37 . as the pomeron couples directly to the partons in the proton , the scattering amplitude factorizes in the impact factor associated to the transition of the virtual photon into the real photon , the gluonic ladder and the coupling of the pomeron with the parton in the proton . at leading order",
