    "quantum entanglement acts as crucial resources in the area of quantum information processing .",
    "it makes various quantum information tasks to be possible , while these tasks , such as quantum teleportation @xcite , quantum dense coding @xcite , etc .",
    ", are impossible for classical information",
    ". the generation of quantum entanglement will continue throughout the development of quantum information processing .",
    "how to increase the length of quantum entanglement and reinforce the ability to generate various forms of quantum entanglement have been a long hotter topics in the research of quantum entanglement generation .",
    "recently , many exciting progress are reported to set the new records of the length of quantum entanglement . in 2009 ,",
    "et al _ reported the creation of 14-qubit entanglement with trapped ions @xcite , and later in 2011 , x. c. yao _ et al _ @xcite and y. f. huang _",
    "et al _ @xcite had reported the generation of 8-photon entanglement , respectively . on the other hand , in the past years",
    ", various forms of quantum entanglement have also been generated in optical system , e.g. , ghz state @xcite , w state @xcite , cluster state @xcite , etc .",
    "besides of these traditional entangled qubits , there is a special form of quantum entanglement , the so - called high dimensional entangled states , or called entangled qudits . with the qudits and",
    "entangled qudits , we could increase the security of quantum cryptography @xcite and the efficiency of quantum logic gates @xcite .",
    "moreover , high dimensional universal resources ( e.g. aklt states ) for measurement based quantum computation can be related to the ground states of certain many - body strongly correlated hamiltonian @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we will focus on the optical system and consider how to generate entangled qudit efficiently .",
    "there are many qudit definitions in optical systems , what we concern is the polarization degree of freedom of multi - photon qudit @xcite . using the photon number of vertical polarization as encoding , the definition of polarization qudit could be expressed as @xmath3 , for @xmath4 , where @xmath1 is the dimension , and h and v represent the horizontal and vertical polarizations .",
    "this definition requires that the @xmath5 photons are in the same spatial and temporal mode , therefore it is hard to operate each photon respectively , which increases the difficulty to generate various forms of entangled qudits . if the independent qudits are available , the success probability of entangled qudit generation is only @xmath6 @xcite ; while only the qubits and entangled qubits are available , the success probability of entangled qutrit generation is 3/16 in ref .",
    "@xcite or 1/4 in ref .",
    "moreover , almost all the former entangled qudit generation schemes only involved the case of symmetric entangled qudits , which could be expressed as follows,@xmath7 where @xmath8 however , the following asymmetric entangled qudits are also valuable , @xmath9 where @xmath10 , and @xmath8 especially , when @xmath11 ( where @xmath12 ) , the asymmetric entangled qudits and the symmetric entangled qudits constitute the maximally entangled basis of two qudits .    here",
    "we will use the cross - phase modulation ( xpm ) approach @xcite to develop the generation of asymmetric entangled qudits .",
    "briefly , the xpm approach bases on the interaction between a fock state @xmath13 and a coherent state @xmath14 , resulting in the transformation @xmath15 , where the phase shift of coherent state is determined by the photon number of the fock state . assisted with the xpm approach",
    ", the generation scheme is heralded , and then the generated entangled qudit could be used flexibly in the further quantum information processing .",
    "we should note that our approach is available for the generation of symmetric entangled qudits as well , and could be generalized to the case of multi - partite , but not limit to only two - partite .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we first introduce the ancilla single - photon qudit and then use the xpm approach to generate asymmetric entangled qutrits . then in the next section , we will develop the approach to generate asymmetric entangled qudits . sec .",
    "iv is for discussion and conclusion remark .",
    "before we outline the generation scheme , we will first introduce a single - photon qudit , which is encoded by the spatial modes of the single photon .",
    "after that , we will use the single - photon qudit as ancilla to generate entangled qudits .",
    "is injected into a series of proper unitary operations and polarized beam spitters , the balanced single - photon qudit encoded by the spatial modes could be generated.,width=479 ]    the balanced single - photon qudit could be expressed as follows , @xmath16 , and then will be transformed into the state @xmath17 by the first single - photon unitary operation @xmath18{cc}% \\sqrt{\\frac{n-1}{n } } & -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}}\\\\ \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n } } & \\sqrt{\\frac{n-1}{n}}% \\end{array } \\right )   $ ] .",

    "to show our generation scheme clearly , we first use the generation of asymmetric entangled qutrit as example and in follows will generalize it to generate asymmetric entangled qudit .",
    "the balanced single - photon qutrit , as well as two qubus beams @xmath25 are required as ancilla .",
    "the initial state is supposed to be an independent bi - photon qutrit as @xmath26 , where @xmath27 .",
    "these independent qutrits could be created by higher - order parametric down - conversion process @xcite , by the hong - ou - mandal ( hom ) interference of two single - photon qubits @xcite , or by the transformation from single - photon qutrit @xcite .",
    "this qutrit is injected into a pbs and the upper mode , associated with the modes @xmath28 , @xmath29 of the single - photon qutrit , will be coupled to one of the qubus beam as depicted in fig.2 .",
    "the xpm phase shifts induced by the couplings of the upper mode and the mode @xmath28 are supposed to be @xmath30 , while that of the mode @xmath29 is supposed to be @xmath31 .",
    "after that , we will get the following state,@xmath32 to the second qubus beam and let the two qubus beams interfered on the 50:50 beam splitter ( bs ) , which will implement the transformation @xmath33 will yield the following state,@xmath34 where @xmath35 @xmath36 if the vacuum component @xmath37 can be well distinguished from the other components @xmath38 , we could achieve the following state , @xmath39 ) and the corresponding error probability due to the overlap of the vacuum component and the other components is @xmath40 which could tend to @xmath41 under the conditions @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "this requirement could be satisfied by increasing the amplitude of coherent state @xmath44 , when it works in the weak nonlinearity regime ( @xmath45 ) .",
    "evidently , if we introduce another independent bi - photon qutrit and repeat the above processes , we could get the symmetric entangled qutrit . on the other hand ,",
    "if we want to obtain the asymmetric entangled qutrit , the experimental setups must be adjusted slightly , which is shown in the right side of fig.2 .",
    "firstly , we introduce another bi - photon independent qutrit which is prepared as @xmath46 , where @xmath47 .",
    "similarly , this qutrit is injected into a pbs and the upper mode , associated with the modes @xmath21 , @xmath28 of the ancilla single - photon qutrit , is coupled to the second qubus beam as depicted in fig.2 .",
    "after that , the following state could be achieved,@xmath48 where @xmath49 denote the other components that the qubus beam catches different phase shifts other than @xmath31 .",
    "one more displacement @xmath50 is implemented and the interference of two qubus beams will yield the state,@xmath51 obviously , using an ideal pnnd to detect the first coherent state component , the above state could be projected into the following state,@xmath52 .",
    "if the coefficients @xmath53 , for @xmath54 the success probability is also 1/3 .",
    "moreover , it is easy to find that the corresponding error probability is the same as eq .",
    "( [ p2 ] ) .    finally , to achieve the desired asymmetric entangled qutrit , we should erase the ancilla single - photon qutrit without changing anything else .",
    "we firstly perform the following fourier transformation by a so - called linear optical multi - port interferometer ( lomi ) @xcite on the single - photon qutrit , @xmath55 where @xmath56 denote the spatial modes .",
    "after performing some phase shifts controlled by the detection on this single photon through the classical feedforward , we could get the desired asymmetric entangled qutrit , @xmath57    by properly setting the coefficients @xmath58 , the following maximally entangled qutrits could be obtained,@xmath59 where @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "totally , the success probability is 1/9 .",
    "moreover , exchanging the order of two qutrits and properly setting the coefficients , we could achieve the following maximally entangled qutrits,@xmath62 these six asymmetric entangled qutrits associated with the other three symmetric entangled qutrits constitute the maximally entangled basis of two qutrits .",
    "we should note here that the generation scheme does not require any postselection processes , that is it is heralded by the detection of the coherent state component .",
    "if the detector registers any signals , the generation scheme is failure , while no detection means the success of the generation .",
    "therefore , the generated entangled qutrit could be used flexibly in the further quantum information processing .",
    "determined by the dimension @xmath1 . here",
    "we suppose @xmath63 , which corresponds to the case of asymmetric entangled qudits generation .",
    "if the xpm phase shifts induced to the two independent qudits are the same , the symmetric entangle qudits could be generated .",
    "moreover , if more independent qudits are introduced and the similar processes are repeated , multi - partite entangled qudits could be generated with the success probability @xmath0 determined by the dimension @xmath1 and partite @xmath2.,width=479 ]    the above scheme could be generalized to realize the generation of arbitrary forms of entangled qudits ( expressed in eq . ( 2 ) ) . at first",
    ", we introduce a single - photon qudit @xmath64 as ancilla .",
    "suppose an independent multi - photon qudit is prepared as @xmath65 , where @xmath66 .",
    "after the multi - photon qudit is injected into a pbs , its upper mode associated with the spatial modes of the single - photon qudit are coupled to the second qubus beam as depicted in fig.4 . the xpm phase shift induced by the upper mode",
    "is supposed to be @xmath30 and those by the spatial modes @xmath67 ( @xmath4 ) are supposed to be @xmath68 .",
    "after the interaction , we will get the following state,@xmath69 where @xmath49 denote the components that the qubus beam catches the phase shifts other than @xmath70 .",
    "after that , implement a displacement @xmath71 to the second qubus beam and let the two qubus beams interfered on a 50:50 bs .",
    "the above state will be transformed into the follows,@xmath72 using an ideal pnnd to detect the first coherent state component will project the above state to @xmath73 when the detection is @xmath74 .",
    "the corresponding success probability is @xmath6 .",
    "similarly , we should introduce another independent multi - photon qudit , which is supposed to be @xmath75 .",
    "if we want to achieve the symmetric entangled qudit , what we should do is to repeat the above processes with the same experimental setups .",
    "while we want to achieve the asymmetric entangled qudit , we should adjust the experimental setups .",
    "as shown in the right side of fig.3 , the corresponding xpm phase shifts induced by the upper mode of second multi - photon qudit is also supposed to be @xmath30 , while the other xpm phase shifts induced by the spatial modes of the single - photon qudit are supposed to be @xmath76   \\theta$ ] .",
    "after the interaction , we could get the following state,@xmath77 next we implement a displacement @xmath71 to the second qubus beam and let two qubus beams interfered on a 50:50 bs .",
    "then the following state could be achieved after detecting the first coherent state component with the result @xmath74,@xmath78 finally , the ancilla single - photon qudit must be erased before we get the desire quantum state . to complete the erasure , we first implement the following fourier transformation,@xmath79 by a @xmath1-port lomi @xcite .",
    "after that , detecting the single - photon qudit and using the detection to controlled the conditional phase shifts through the classical feedforward will yield the desired asymmetric entangled qudit,@xmath80 by properly setting the coefficients , we could get the following states , @xmath81 where @xmath82 and @xmath12 .",
    "these states constitute to be the maximally entangled basis of two qudits and the corresponding success probability is @xmath83 .",
    "furthermore , if we introduce one more multi - photon qudit and repeat the above processes , we could achieve three - partite entangled qudits . in other words , the above scheme could be easily generalized to create any forms of multi - partite entangled qudits , including symmetric and asymmetric multi - partite entangled qudits .",
    "the corresponding success probability is @xmath0 , which determined by the dimension @xmath1 and partite @xmath2 .",
    "in this paper , we propose a scheme to generate entangled qudits , including the symmetric and asymmetric forms . using a balanced single - photon qudit encoded by its spatial modes as ancilla",
    ", the forms of generated entangled qudits could be flexible by setting the proper xpm phase shifts .",
    "the success probability for maximally entangled qudits is determined by the dimension and the partite as @xmath0 .",
    "it looks that to be not high .",
    "however , this scheme is heralded , but not based on the post - selection . if any of the ideal pnnds register any signals ,",
    "the scheme is failure ; otherwise , it is successful . while many other optical schemes are based on the post - selection , and then when we use the generated quantum entanglement , we will encounter many limitations , e.g. , no further interference is allowed . in other words ,",
    "only single - photon operations are allowed to performed on the generated quantum entanglement . obviously , the generated entangled qudits in our scheme could be used without any limitations in the further quantum information tasks , since the generation is heralded .    actually , the probabilistic quantum gate is still valuable for quantum information processing .",
    "for example , the universal resource , e.g. , cluster state could be generated efficiently even with the probabilistic quantum gate @xcite .",
    "developing the idea in ref .",
    "@xcite , we could generate the high dimension universal resource , e.g. , aklt states efficiently by the probabilistic gate presented in this paper as well .",
    "now , we discuss the feasibility of the present scheme briefly .",
    "the ideal pnnd used in this scheme seems unrealistic , however , we could use the common pnnd , e.g. silicon avalanche photodiode ( apd ) , to replace the ideal pnnd .",
    "though the quantum efficiency of common pnnd is lower than 1 ( @xmath84 ) , it could works well in our scheme .",
    "what we want is to distinguish the vacuum state from the other coherent components .",
    "if we choose the proper parameters , e.g. , the xpm phase shift @xmath85 and the amplitude of qubus beam @xmath86 , the average photon number of the coherent components @xmath87 and @xmath88 are about 13 and 50 , respectively . in this case",
    ", the vacuum state could be well separated from the coherent components even with the common pnnd , though the corresponding error probability @xmath89 .    finally , the core element of our scheme is the proper design of xpm phase shifts based on the weak cross - kerr nonlinearity .",
    "since we had theoretically demonstrated that a small xpm phase shift with high fidelity is feasible in the weak nonlinearity regime @xcite , even the so - called multi - mode effect is considered , then the weak nonlinearity in the idealized single - mode picture is valid .",
    "associated the mature linear optical techniques , e.g. the interference of two qubus beams , the detection of single photons , etc .",
