    "recently new experiments are proposed to determine the neutrino mixing angle @xmath2 using reactor anti - neutrinos with sensitivity in sin@xmath3 on the order of 0.01 @xcite , about a factor of ten better than the current limit @xcite . comparing to the past reactor neutrino experiments @xcite , the systematic error of the proposed experiments",
    "will be greatly reduced by carrying a relative measurement with detectors located at two different baselines to cancel the reactor - related errors , and other improvements to the detectors for reducing the detector systematic errors .",
    "however , the cosmogenic @xmath0li and @xmath1he background will remain an irreducible systematic uncertainty in the measurement .",
    "the proposed reactor neutrino experiments detect the anti - neutrinos via the inverse @xmath4-decay reaction with liquid scintillator .",
    "the inverse @xmath4-decay process is the interaction of an electron anti - neutrino with a proton ( hydrogen ) resulting in the production of a positron and a neutron .",
    "a neutrino event is identified by the coincidence of the energy deposited by the positron ( 1 mev to 8 mev ) followed by the energy released from neutron capture .",
    "although the proposed experiments will be carried out underground , a nontrivial number of cosmic - ray muons can still pass through the hermetically shielded detectors .",
    "some of these cosmic muons interact with the carbon nuclei in the liquid scintillator to produce unstable isotopes . among them , @xmath0li and @xmath1he have @xmath4-neutron cascade decay modes , with branching fraction of 49.5% and @xmath5% , respectively .",
    "the @xmath4-decay of @xmath0li and @xmath1he has a q value of 13.6 mev and 10.7 mev , respectively , which overlaps with the positron signal of the neutrino events .",
    "the beta particle can thus mimic the prompt signal of a neutrino event while the neutron provides the delayed signal .",
    "hence the cosmogenic @xmath0li and @xmath1he isotopes are indistinguishable from the neutrino events . since these two isotopes are relatively long - lived , with a half - life of 0.178 s for @xmath0li @xcite and 0.119 s for @xmath1he @xcite , they are difficult to reject with a muon veto .",
    "production of @xmath1he and @xmath0li has been measured with 190 gev muons on a liquid - scintillator target at cern @xcite . since their lifetimes are so close it is hard to determine their individual cross sections .",
    "the cross section @xmath6 is measured to be @xmath7 , and the energy dependence of the cross section is suggested to be @xmath8 , with @xmath9 . in the kamland experiment , about 85% of the isotopes are found to be produced by inelastic scattering of energetic muons @xcite . from the time distribution and the @xmath4-energy spectrum of the @xmath4-neutron events , the contribution of @xmath1he relative to @xmath0li is less than 15% at the 90% confidence level .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath1he contribution could be determined by tagging the cascade @xmath1he @xmath10li @xmath10be decay sequence @xcite .",
    "hence , for simplicity , we assume that the cosmogenic isotope background is solely @xmath0li in our investigation .    while kamland can measure the @xmath0li background well from the time distribution of the @xmath4-neutron event since last muon , it is not necessarily true for other experiments with less overburden .",
    "the average overburden of the kamland detector is 2700 m.w.e .",
    "( meter - water - equivalent ) , resulting in a muon flux of 0.0015 hz / m@xmath11 , or 0.2 hz of cosmic - ray muons in the active volume of the detector .",
    "this implies the mean time interval of two adjacent muons is 5 s , much longer than the lifetime of @xmath0li . for most reactor experiments proposed to measure @xmath2 , the overburden ranges from about 300 to 1 200 m.w.e .",
    "@xcite . the muon rate can be as high as 20 hz , resulting a mean time interval of muons significantly shorter than the lifetime of @xmath0li .",
    "however , we find that it is still possible to determine the @xmath0li content since the anti - neutrino rate and the @xmath0li rate are significantly lower than the muon rate .",
    "the probability of having two @xmath4-neutron events ( either neutrino or @xmath0li candidates here ) in the time window used in the analysis is negligible .",
    "thus the muons immediately following neutrino candidates can simply be ignored . in this paper , we show that it is possible to measure the @xmath0li and @xmath1he background in - situ even when the cosmic - ray muon rate , comparing to the isotope lifetime , is relatively high .",
    "suppose the muons are randomly distributed in time .",
    "the time interval @xmath12 of two adjacent muons follows a normalized exponential function @xmath13 where the constant @xmath14 is the mean time interval between two adjacent muons , @xmath15 , with @xmath16 being the muon rate .",
    "the neutrino events are also randomly distributed and independent of the muons . the time interval between a neutrino event and the last muon preceding it obeys the same exponential distribution , but with a different constant @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the neutrino rate .",
    "the neutrino rate is normally several orders lower than the muon rate .",
    "the difference in @xmath19 and @xmath14 can thus be ignored .",
    "therefore , we have @xmath20 . here , the variable @xmath12 is the time of the neutrino event since the last muon .",
    "the @xmath0li events are correlated with the muons .",
    "if the muon rate is high , a @xmath0li event might be the product of any of the preceding muons . when summed over the contributions of all preceding muons , the probability density function ( p.d.f . ) of the @xmath0li events in terms of the time since last muon @xmath12 is @xmath21    where @xmath22 s is the lifetime of @xmath0li , and @xmath23 is the time interval of two adjacent preceding muons .",
    "the first term corresponds to the contribution from the last muon .",
    "the second term is that from the second - to - the - last muon , and so on . because the time since last muon is @xmath12 , the time interval between the two muons immediately before and after a @xmath0li event must be greater than @xmath12 .",
    "this condition has a probability of @xmath24 .",
    "therefore the p.d.f . of the time since",
    "last muon @xmath12 for the @xmath0li events becomes @xmath25 in a reactor neutrino experiment , the observed distribution of the time since last muon @xmath12 for all @xmath4-neutron events is a combination of the distribution of the genuine neutrino events and that of the @xmath0li events . as a result , the observed distribution can be described by @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are number of @xmath0li and neutrino events , respectively .",
    "the background - to - signal ratio is simply @xmath29 .",
    "the amount of the @xmath0li background can then be measured by minimizing the @xmath30 function which is a sum of the squares of the residuals of the observed time distribution divided in bins from the expectation given by eq .",
    "[ eqn : chi2 ] .",
    "in the least - squares method , contributions of all preceding muons are included in the p.d.f . and expressed as a function of the time since last muon .",
    "similarly , an unbinned maximum - likelihood fit can be performed with the same p.d.f .. the log - likelihood function ( mla ) is thus defined as @xmath31 \\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath23 is the time of the @xmath32-th @xmath4-neutron event since last muon . here",
    "we assume that each @xmath4-neutron event has a probability of @xmath33 being a @xmath0li event and @xmath34 to be a neutrino candidate . to precisely determine @xmath2 ,",
    "it is desirable to have the background - to - signal ratio as small as possible . in this case",
    ", @xmath33 can be taken as such a ratio .",
    "alternatively , the maximum - likelihood method can exploit the contributions to a @xmath4-neutron event from each preceding muons , instead of averaging them into the time distribution since last muon . when the muon rate is not too high but contributions from the preceding muons other than the last one",
    "can not be ignored , we can construct a log - likelihood function ( ml ) as @xmath35     \\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath32 sums over all @xmath4-neutron events in the sample and @xmath36 sums over all preceding muons of the @xmath32-th @xmath4-neutron event . here",
    "@xmath37 is the time of the @xmath32-th @xmath4-neutron event since last muon , and @xmath38 is its time since the @xmath36-th preceding muon . as in the least - squares method , the term @xmath39 is included in the probability density function of the @xmath0li to account for the condition that there is no muon between the @xmath4-neutron event and the last muon . in practice ,",
    "only muons in a finite time window are included .",
    "this truncation will lead to an error in the probability on the order of @xmath40 for a two - second window .",
    "the statistical error of the parameter in the fit can be estimated for the maximum - likelihood method when the sample size is very large . in this case , the variance @xmath41 of the parameter @xmath42 is given by  @xcite @xmath43_{\\theta=\\hat{\\theta } }     \\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath44 is the density function , @xmath45 is the expectation of the parameter @xmath42 , @xmath46 is the sample space , and @xmath47 denotes the mathematical expectation in the sample space . for the mla given in eq .",
    "[ eqn : mla ] , the variance is @xmath48 if @xmath49 , which is the case for most reactor neutrino experiments , the above integral can be simplified . the statistical error of @xmath33 is approximated to be @xmath50    where @xmath51 is the total event number of @xmath4-neutron events .",
    "it is interesting to note that the error is independent of @xmath33 .",
    "when the muon rate is high , as expected , the error gets worse .",
    "to validate the formulation , we have simulated data samples of a reactor neutrino experiment , with neutrino , muon , and @xmath0li events taken into account . for each sample ,",
    "two independent data sets are first generated , one contains neutrino events , and the other contains muons and @xmath0li events .",
    "the neutrino events are generated randomly in time .",
    "for a given muon rate @xmath16 , the number of muons is determined .",
    "muons are then generated randomly in time .",
    "the probability of producing the @xmath0li isotope by each muon is calculated with a poisson distribution based on the production cross section measured at 190 gev .",
    "if a @xmath0li is created , its decay time is generated according to an exponential function using the @xmath0li lifetime .",
    "neither the energies of the @xmath0li and neutrinos nor the muon - energy dependence of the yield of @xmath0li is taken into account here .",
    "the two independent data sets are then combined and sorted by time to form the @xmath4-neutron sample for analysis .    the distribution of the time since last muon for all the @xmath4-neutron events in a monte carlo sample with an input muon rate of 4 hz and a value of 0.01 for b / s is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : beta - n ] .",
    "the red curve is the best fit of eq .",

    "in addition , 400 samples are generated and analyzed for each given muon rate to investigate the potential bias and precision of the fit .",
    "it is clear from fig .",
