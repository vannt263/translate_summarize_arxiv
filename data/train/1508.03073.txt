    "are suppressed at weak coupling and the nonequilibrium quantum dynamics in this transient regime can be accurately mapped onto a classical - statistical problem .",
    "the latter can be solved using real time lattice simulation techniques  @xcite .",
    "the classical - statistical field description is limited to the early stages of the evolution since the typical occupancies decrease at later times .",
    "it is well known that classical dynamics can not describe the late time evolution towards thermal equilibrium due to the rayleigh - jeans divergence nor can it isotropize in the presence of rapid longitudinal expansion .",

    "we should nevertheless first observe that our results suggest that a comprehensive strategy for weak coupling thermalization is to start with classical - statistical field theory at early times and to continue later with an appropriate kinetic theory , passing from one regime to the other in the time window where both descriptions are valid .",

    "<S> in phys .  rev .  lett .  114 ( 2015 ) 6 , 061601 , we reported on a new universality class for longitudinally expanding systems , encompassing strongly correlated non - abelian plasmas and @xmath0-component self - interacting scalar field theories . </S>",
    "<S> using classical - statistical methods , we showed that these systems share the same self - similar scaling properties for a wide range of momenta in a limit where particles are weakly coupled but their occupancy is high . here </S>",
    "<S> we significantly expand on our previous work and delineate two further self - similar regimes . </S>",
    "<S> one of these occurs in the deep infrared ( ir ) regime of very high occupancies , where the nonequilibrium dynamics leads to the formation of a bose - einstein condensate . </S>",
    "<S> the universal ir scaling exponents and the spectral index characterizing the isotropic ir distributions are described by an effective theory derived from a systematic large-@xmath0 expansion at next - to - leading order . </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , this effective theory can be cast as a vertex - resummed kinetic theory . </S>",
    "<S> the other novel self - similar regime occurs close to the hard physical scale of the theory , and sets in only at later times . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that the important role of the infrared dynamics ensures that key features of our results for scalar and gauge theories can not be reproduced consistently in conventional kinetic theory frameworks . </S>"
