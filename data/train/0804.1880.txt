    "two dimensional systems with short range interactions and @xmath2 symmetry undergo a kosterlitz - thouless ( kt ) phase transition @xcite .",
    "this phase transition is of particular interest because of its peculiar nature and the large number of effectively two dimensional systems that are supposed to undergo such a transition .    following the theorem of mermin and wagner @xcite the magnetisation of two dimensional systems with short range interactions and a continuous symmetry vanishes at any finite temperature .",
    "kosterlitz and thouless @xcite have argued that nevertheless two dimensional systems with @xmath2 symmetry undergo a phase transition at a finite temperature . in the low temperature phase",
    ", the decay of the correlation function follows a power law . at a sufficiently high temperature , pairs of vortices unbind and disorder the system , resulting in a finite correlation length @xmath3 ; i.e. the correlation function decays exponentially .",
    "starting from the seminal work of kosterlitz and thouless a rather solid theoretical understanding of the transition has been established .",
    "see e.g. refs . @xcite .",
    "furthermore , there are exactly solved models @xcite that display the behaviour predicted by kt - theory .",
    "this excellent theoretical understanding is contrasted by the fact that monte carlo studies of the kt - transition are notoriously difficult .",
    "these difficulties are related with logarithmic corrections that are present in the neighbourhood of the transition .    in monte carlo studies of critical phenomena , renormalization group",
    "invariant quantities , which are also called phenomenological couplings , are very useful tools . in finite size",
    "scaling ( fss ) , they allow to locate the transition point , to determine the nature of the transition and , in the case of a second order transition , to determine the critical exponent @xmath4 of the correlation length .",
    "the prototype of such a quantity is the so called binder cumulant @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the magnetisation of the system .. ] while the binder cumulant is a standard tool in the study of second order transitions , only a few authors have advocated its use in the case of a kt - transition @xcite .",
    "this is due to the fact that little is known about the behaviour of the binder cumulant in the neighbourhood of the kt - transition .",
    "the main purpose of the present paper is to fill this gap .",
    "the outline of the paper is the following : first we define the models and the observables that we study .",
    "next we summarize the results from kt - theory which are relevant to our problem .",
    "then we derive the fixed point value of the binder cumulant and the coefficient of the leading logarithmic correction .",
    "we discuss our monte carlo simulations of the xy model , the villain model and the dual of the absolute value solid - on - solid ( asos ) model at the kt - transition .",
    "the monte carlo results for the binder cumulant , the second moment correlation length and the helicity modulus are confronted with the theoretical predictions . based on this discussion",
    ", we propose to determine the transition temperature of a model which is supposed to undergo a kt - transition by simultaneously matching the values of the second moment correlation length and the binder cumulant with those obtained for the three models studied in this paper .",
    "this method is tested at the example of the two - component @xmath1 model on the square lattice .",
    "finally we give our conclusions .",
    "we study the xy model on the square lattice and two generalizations of it : the villain model and the dual of the absolute value solid - on - solid model .",
    "this allows us to check the universality of the behaviour of the binder cumulant and other phenomenological couplings .",
    "the boltzmann factor of these models can be written as a product of weights for pairs of nearest neighbour sites on the lattice . in all three cases",
