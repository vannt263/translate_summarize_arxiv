    "in the case of the nv defect the branching of the decay of the optical excited state through non - radiative paths can be reduced greatly by exciting from the @xmath26 ground state . since one can optically pump the nv into this state with high efficiency before initializing the cooling we first assume @xmath27 .",
    "we also expect that the long wavelength irradiation required for cryocooling will continue to pump the nvs into this ground state .",
    "we now consider a roughly spherical diamond particle which is held in a 3d trap . to estimate",
    "the change in temperature ( the cooling region of the laser and diamond is cylindrical ) , one must determine the thermal load and this depends on the physical surroundings .",
    "in @xcite , the primary thermal load arises from blackbody absorption of ambient room temperature radiation by the cold particle . assuming the change in temperature of the material @xmath28 , is small as compared with the ambient temperature then one has @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the stefan - boltzmann constant , @xmath31 is the effective emissivity of the cylinder , i.e. the fraction of energy emitted or absorbed relative to that emitted by a thermal black body , and @xmath32 is the surface area of the spherical diamond particle .",

    "we have assumed no direct thermal contact between the levitated diamond in vacuum and its surroundings ( purely radiative contact ) , and thus the only methods to measure the temperature of the diamond is to either study the spectrum of the blackbody radiation emitted by the diamond or by analyzing temperature dependent features @xcite , of the emitted photoluminescence of the defects themselves .",

    "the development of all optical cryocooling has potentially numerous applications ranging from situations which require low - power and low - vibration , through to refrigeration in difficult environments eg .",

    "traditional materials for optical cryocooling include rare - earth crystals and semiconductors however such materials are typically highly toxic in biological environments . in contrast , in this work we have found that diamond doped with nitrogen vacancy defects show potential for optical cryocooling .",
    "we proposed the optical cryocooling of levitated diamond crystalites which , due to their thermal isolation , may exhibit large temperature reductions using optical cryocooling . for our work we found that cryocooling requires",
    "the defects to possess high quantum efficiencies and nv defects with such high levels of quantum efficiencies have been experimentally demonstrated in nanodiamonds @xcite , and post - selecting nanodiamonds to achieve a uniformly high quantum efficiencies is feasible .",
    "another route to increase the optical quantum efficiency which is particularly suited to the nv defect is to enhance the zpl emission using the purcell effect via coupling the defects to an optical cavity .",
    "optical cryo - cooling is based on the principle that more phonons are absorbed than created . since the nv centre has a strong phonon - sideband and",
    "hence produces lots of phonons during its radiative decay , cooling effects only start at wavelengths considerably above the zpl and are highly dependent on quantum efficiency .",
    "this could be fundamentally improved by a change of the relative emission pathways associated with the purcell - enhancement of a particular emission wavelength of the nv centres inside a cavity .",
    "purcell enhancement is , by now , an established technique @xcite .",
    "an enhancement of the zpl has a twofold advantage : the emission on the phonon sideband is reduced relative to the zpl which does not create any phonons and the optical life - time of the nv is shortened , strengthening the radiative decay relative to any non - radiative pathways , which do not change in their decay rate , i.e. increasing the quantum efficiency .",
    "while nv diamond inside a cavity sets some limitations in terms of applicability it might provide strong advantages for cooling : lowering the effective excitation wavelength above which a cooling effect starts , which in turn increases the absorption cross - section , i.e. the cooling effect at the same power as well as improving the cooling effect through an effective increase of the quantum efficiency",
    ". this might be an interesting avenue for further improvements .",
    "thus we have found that the optical cryocooling of nv doped diamond crystalites is viable and there may be potential use for this in biocompatible applications e.g. in cryosurgery or cryotherapy .",
    "the use of other defects in diamond with higher debye - waller factors and near unity quantum efficiency would prove even better candidates for optical cryocooling of diamond .",
    "the absorption cross section of the negatively charged nv centre is well known only for the excitation wavelength @xmath108 nm . for cryocooling",
    "it is important to measure the absorption cross section as a function of wavelength for @xmath109 nm without relying on typically inaccurate estimates for the number of emitting nv centers and the laser spot size .",
    "we achieved this by comparing the emission from the nv@xmath110 centers ( zero phonon - line emission at 637 nm ) for different excitation wavelengths and relying on the literature value for 532 nm excitation @xcite .",
    "we ensured that the excitation power was consistently at 200@xmath36w for all high wavelengths and accounted for the reduced power of our 532 nm reference measurement .",
    "we also ensured that the excitation power is low enough to not reach any saturation within the measurement to guarantee linear behavior with excitation power and comparability across all excitation wavelengths .",
    "different excitation wavelengths were created by a supercontinuum source with a tunable filter , see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] and focused onto a single crystal diamond sample with very high nv centre density to ensure a good signal . a 650 nm short",
    "pass and 532 nm notch blocked the sensor from reflections of the excitation light , which were much stronger than the signal .",
    "the incoming light was then directed to a spectrometer and measurements with an acquisition time of 1s were taken .",
    "we compared the signal at the nv@xmath110 zero - phonon line and the relative signals as a function of wavelength were then linearly scaled to an absorption cross - section by equating the reference intensity , measured with 532 nm excitation , to the literature value of 0.95@xmath111 @xmath112 @xcite .",
    "note that this measurement is more precise than an absorption measurement because out of all the possible absorption mechanisms we select only that of the nv centers by measuring the emission of nv centers rather than the reduction in the transmitted light .",
