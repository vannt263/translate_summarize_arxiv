    "although a relationship exists between the evolution of galaxies and their environment , as demonstrated by correlations between density and galaxy color ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , star - formation @xcite , and morphology @xcite , the physical processes that drive these changes and the connection between those processes and environment are not established . while the cores of clusters are the final resting place for quiescent galaxies and are where these trends were discovered , the key to understanding the implicit quenching of star formation and morphological transformation is to study galaxies in the environment where they are being transformed , not where they ultimately reside .",
    "quenching and morphological transformation do not occur primarily in the cores of clusters , at least not at redshifts @xmath12 .",
    "the decrease in star formation sets in at several virial radii @xcite , and the increase in the s0 fraction since @xmath13 @xcite is most dramatic in less - massive clusters @xcite .",
    "environmentally - driven evolution occurs primarily at intermediate densities , which should include the environs outside the cluster virial radius .",

    "a number of studies have begun to target the outskirts of @xmath14 massive clusters ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "however , such studies have been limited to a few clusters ( @xmath15 ) , making general conclusions difficult to reach given the variation in properties from cluster to cluster . because of the high masses of these targeted clusters , and correspondingly large virial radii , some of these studies do not probe very far past the virial radius and may miss a significant fraction of the infalling galaxies .",
    "furthermore , such clusters are also rare , hence the infalling population of more typical clusters has not been explored .",
    "this bias may lead to an incomplete picture , given the cluster - mass dependence of s0 evolution @xcite .",
    "a fundamental difficulty in studying cluster infalling populations is the contamination of interloping foreground / background galaxies , an issue that becomes more important at larger cluster - centric radii where the relative fraction of interlopers is larger .",
    "the studies listed above use spectroscopic redshifts for this purpose , but this approach requires significant telescope time and is thus limited to those few clusters .",
    "the alternative approach using photometric redshifts ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) comes with much lower observational cost , but photometric redshifts are insufficiently precise to securely associate a galaxy to a particular cluster , where @xmath16  km  s@xmath11 resolution is needed .",
    "we adopt a hybrid approach .",
    "we isolate the infalling galaxy population of @xmath17 clusters at @xmath0 using the low - dispersion prism ( ldp ) installed in the inamori - magellan areal camera and spectrograph ( imacs ; * ? ? ?",

    ", we measure the number of galaxies these clusters will accrete by @xmath6 to establish how many galaxies may be influenced by the accretion process .",
    "we also measure the scatter in this number to estimate the range in accretion histories .",
    "we compare models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that predict the amount of mass accreted by these clusters to our observations",
    ". finally , we measure the optical properties and clustering amplitude of infalling galaxies to quantify the amount of evolution that takes place outside the virial radius .",

    "<S> we present results from a low - resolution spectroscopic survey for 21 galaxy clusters at @xmath0 selected from the eso distant cluster survey ( ediscs ) . </S>",

    "<S> we find @xmath2 galaxies that are brighter than @xmath3 in the large - scale cluster environs . </S>",
    "<S> we identify the galaxies expected to be accreted by the clusters as they evolve to using spherical infall models , and find that @xmath4@xmath5 of the @xmath6 cluster population lies outside the virial radius at @xmath7 . for analogous clusters at @xmath6 , we calculate that the ratio of galaxies that have fallen into the clusters since @xmath7 to that which were already in the core at that redshift is typically between @xmath8 and @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> this wide range of ratios is due to intrinsic scatter and is not a function of velocity dispersion , so a variety of infall histories is to be expected for clusters with current velocity dispersions of @xmath10  km  s@xmath11 . within the infall regions of @xmath7 clusters </S>",
    "<S> , we find a larger red fraction of galaxies than in the field and greater clustering among red galaxies than blue . </S>",
    "<S> we interpret these findings as evidence of  preprocessing \" , where galaxies in denser local environments have their star formation rates affected prior to their aggregation into massive clusters , although the possibility of backsplash galaxies complicate the interpretation . </S>"
