    "a general theory of linear response functions has been formulated several decades ago @xcite , @xcite , @xcite that became the basis of numerous studies of correlation functions , susceptibilities and transport properties in solid matter .",
    "although early attempts were already devoted within this theoretical framework to magneto - optical phenomena , i.e. , the faraday and the kerr effect , @xcite,@xcite it was the rapid development of both , band structure methods and computational facilities that brought about the renaissance in this field from the end of the 1980 s ( see @xcite , @xcite and refs . therein ) .",
    "this progress was built on the assumption that the original expression for linear response functions , derived on the basis of a non - relativistic approach , is still valid when applying relativistic band structure methods .",
    "recently , this has indeed been rigorously confirmed by huhne and ebert @xcite .    within an independent particle picture the interband part of the optical conductivity tensor at finite temperatures ,",
    "@xmath0 is given by @xcite , @xcite    @xmath1    where @xmath2 is the frequency , @xmath3 is the fermi function , @xmath4 is the volume of the system , the @xmath5 are the matrix elements of the current density operator @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) with respect to the eigenfunctions @xmath8 of the one - electron hamiltonian corresponding to energy eigenvalues @xmath9 .",
    "life - time broadening effects due to different scattering processes are partially accounted for by a finite value of @xmath10 ry , where @xmath11 can be associated with a relaxation time @xcite .",
    "such a life - time effect can naturally be incorporated into linear response theory either by assuming an adiabatic switch on of the external field @xmath12 @xcite or , equivalently , by convoluting the corresponding frequency dependent conductivity for @xmath13 by a lorentzian of a finite halfwidth @xmath14 .",
    "expression ( [ sigma1 ] ) is usually directly evaluated by applying standard band structure methods for ordered bulk ( three - dimensional translational invariant ) systems by associating the states @xmath15 with ( three - dimensional ) bloch - functions @xcite,@xcite .",
    "this kind of approach , however , can not be extended easily to layered systems or systems with a surface , i.e. , to systems with ( at best ) two - dimensional translational symmetry .",
    "furthermore , it is totally unsuited to deal with disorder such as interdiffusion effects in magnetic multilayer systems .    for zero life - time",
    "broadening an alternative approach consists of splitting eq .",
    "( [ sigma1 ] ) into an absorptive and a dispersive part , which in turn are interrelated via the kramers - kronig relations @xcite,@xcite .",
    "thus it is sufficient to directly calculate the absorptive part only , the corresponding kubo - formula of which can be expressed in terms of green s functions as was shown by butler @xcite for @xmath16 , and was used recently by banhart @xcite for @xmath17 . even much earlier",
    ", luttinger @xcite derived a general formula of the conductivity tensor which builts on the green s function of the system .",
    "however , when using this method the corresponding energy integrals have to be performed along the real axis which makes a calculation of @xmath18 enormously tedious and also numerically hard to control .    in the present work a suitable extension of luttinger s formula is given in terms of contour integrations that avoids the above mentioned numerical difficulties , is suitable for applications to magnetic multilayer systems and for treating alloying effects ( interdiffusion etc . ) by means of the coherent potential approximation ( cpa ) .",

    "it should be noted that in the case of site - diagonal terms , see @xcite , in principle for the evaluation of the contour integrals also the ` irregular ' part of the green s function has to be included . since the inhomogeneous cpa for semi - infinite systems and the corresponding kubo - greenwood approach to electric transport is discussed at length in @xcite , no further discussion with respect to layered systems is needed .",
