    "the process of subdiffusion can occur in media in which particles movement is strongly hindered due to the internal structure of a medium .",
    "subdiffusion is usually defined as a random walk process in which @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is a mean square displacement of a random walker , @xmath6 is a subdiffusion parameter ( @xmath7 ) , @xmath8 is a subdiffusion coefficient and @xmath9 denotes the gamma function ; for normal diffusion there is @xmath10 .",
    "subdiffusion is mostly described by means of subdiffusion equations with a fractional time derivative derived from the continuous time random walk formalism @xcite .",
    "when the subdiffusion process is extended to a subdiffusion  reaction process then the form and the position of the reaction term within the subdiffusion ",
    "reaction equation is not clear .",
    "namely , in paper @xcite the reaction term is located outside the riemann ",
    "liouville fractional derivative operator whereas in @xcite this term is located under this fractional operator .",
    "we should mention here that there are various forms of subdiffusion  reaction equations which are not equivalent ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "the ambiguities concerning the form of the reaction term are related to assumptions concerning the influence of a subdiffusive medium on a reaction kinetic .",
    "hereafter , we will consider a subdiffusion process in which a particle can vanish with some probability which does not depend on both time and space variables .",
    "such a process can formally be treated as a subdiffusion  reaction process .",
    "normal diffusion or subdiffusion processes with particles vanishing occur in biology , for example , in drug absorption via passive diffusion @xcite or in a system in which the absorption of particles is weakened by mucus which is treated as a diffusional barrier @xcite . in order to model such processes , ( sub)diffusion  reaction equations with appropriate boundary conditions set at walls bounding the system",
    "are needed .",
    "however , the choice of boundary conditions is obvious neither for normal diffusion  reaction processes @xcite nor for subdiffusive systems in which reactions are absent @xcite .",
    "thus , it is not difficult to realise that the boundary conditions at the walls for a subdiffusion  reaction equation can be set ambiguously . in order to avoid the difficulties with the choice of boundary conditions we propose the following method of modelling subdiffusion  reaction processes . in order to find a subdiffusion  reaction equation and green s function describing the subdiffusion of a particle @xmath1 that can also vanish with some probability , we will primarily use a random walk model with both discrete time and space variables .",
    "then , the obtained results will be transformed to both continuous time and space variables by means of the formulae presented in this paper .",
    "the reason for the choice of such a methodology is as follows .",
    "difference equations describing the random walk with both discrete time and space variables can be explicitly solved by means of the generating function method , which means this method can be also applied to study subdiffusion ",
    "reaction processes in more complex systems containing various ` obstacles ' such as partially absorbing or partially reflecting thin membranes .",
    "we should mention here that a random walk on a lattice with absorption has been mostly studied by means of the continuous time random walk formalism @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we will consider two particle s vanishing processes .",
    "in the first process a particle @xmath1 can vanish according to the formula @xmath3 . in the second process",
    "a particle @xmath1 has to meet an absorbing centre before the particle s @xmath1 vanishing takes place . in this case",
    "the vanishing process is represented by the reaction @xmath0 ; the absorbing centre is represented by a static particle @xmath2 . both of the processes can be observed in nature , among other things , in engineering , in biological systems or in ecological systems .",
    "the reaction @xmath3 can be observed in filtration processes when particles in any ` active state ' are moved through a filter .",
    "the filter can be a subdiffusive medium in order to give a time to deactivation of particles during its movement inside this medium ( see , for example , @xcite and references cited therein ) .",
    "unimolecular reactions are also an example of such processes .",
    "examples of unimolecular reactions include a radioactive decay , cis - trans isomerization @xcite , thermal decomposition @xcite , ring opening @xcite , unimolecular nucleophilic substitution reactions @xcite and racemization @xcite .",
    "we can also mention here an infected living organism randomly moving in a complex medium ; the organism is to die due to the infection .",
    "the subdiffusion with @xmath0 reaction can also be observed in a filtration process in which particles react with other particles in a thick filter @xcite .",
    "the example of the absorbing subdiffusive medium is halloysite , in which absorbing centers are present @xcite . as was mentioned in @xcite , a catalytic quenching of excitations observed in luminescence",
    "is also an example of this reaction .",
    "the case of an antibiotic treatment is another example of the second reaction .",
    "the movement of some bacteria , especially non motile bacteria , can be characterized as a random walk @xcite .",
    "antibiotics can destroy bacteria in two ways : by killing bacteria or by inhibiting the growth of bacteria @xcite . in both cases antibiotics connect in a specific chemical compound occurring in bacteria @xcite .    in the paper @xcite sokolov ,",
    "schmidt and sagus have considered the subdiffusion ",
    "reaction process in which a subdiffusive particle @xmath1 can vanish according to the formula @xmath3 with a constant probability independent of time . assuming that a probability density @xmath11 of a particle s vanishing reads @xmath12 where @xmath13 is a reaction rate , the authors have shown that the concentration of particles @xmath1 , @xmath14 , is as follows @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the concentration of particles @xmath1 in a system in which reactions are switched off , @xmath17 is the probability that a particle continues to exist at time @xmath18 .",
    "an important statement presented in the paper cited above is that the concentration is not a solution to the previously mentioned fractional subdiffusion ",
    "reaction equations .",
    "therefore , a new equation describing this process is required .",
    "the main idea which is the base of the derivation of the new equation ( see eqs .",
    "( [ eq36 ] ) and ( [ eq37 ] ) later in this paper ) presented in  @xcite is as follows .",
    "a reaction can only occur for particles @xmath1 which have not vanished before the reaction takes place .",
    "a new equation of a somewhat unexpected form has been derived under this assumption .",
    "the above considerations lead to the questions : ` should the subdiffusion ",
    "reaction equations previously used in many papers be revised ? ' and ` is this equation still valid when a particle s vanishing is caused by reaction @xmath0 ? ' in this paper we will find the answers to these questions .    in every case",
    "we will start our considerations with both discrete time and space variables and next we transform them into continuous ones .",
    "although the model of a subdiffusive system in which mobile particles @xmath1 can react with static particles @xmath2 according to the formula @xmath19 is presented in the above cited paper , we will consider this process again using a discrete model presented in this paper .",
    "this model is based on a random walk model for a system without reactions .",
    "the influence of reactions is included in functions describing a particle s waiting time to take its next step .",
    "we will pay more attention to subdiffusion processes with @xmath0 reactions .",
    "to describe this process we will use three models .",
    "the first model will be similar to the model which describes the process of subdiffusion with @xmath3 reactions .",
    "the previously mentioned assumption according to which reactions can occur between these particles which continue to exist in the system is included in the model . within this model",
    "we will assume that a reaction can occur at any time ( with the reaction probability density ( [ eq0 ] ) ) if particle @xmath1 meets particle @xmath2 after its jump .",
    "` particles ' meeting here means that particle @xmath1 will come inside the reaction region of particle @xmath2 after particle @xmath1 s jump .",
    "it is assumed that the particles meeting will occur with some probability @xmath20 ( for @xmath21 we obtain results which are equivalent to the case of subdiffusion with @xmath3 reaction ) .",
    "we will show that the introduction of the parameter @xmath20 into the model provides particle concentration which qualitatively differs from ( [ eq1 ] ) .",
    "thus , the models of subdiffusion processes with both types of reactions which have been mentioned above are of a different character",
    ". the second model of subdiffusion with @xmath22 reactions will utilize difference equations describing random walk , with the particles vanishing process .",
    "this model , in contradiction to the first model , explicitly includes an absorption probability .",
    "we will show that the results obtained within both models mentioned above are similar for @xmath23 but the probability distributions obtained within these models differ by the factor @xmath24 , which is included into the green s function obtained for the first model for @xmath18 less or equal to @xmath25 .",
    "the third model is equivalent to the second model and assumes that particle @xmath1 performs an ` ordinary ' random walk ( i.e. just like in a system without reactions ) but the parameters describing the walk depend on the reaction parameter .",
    "additionally , we will find the relation between the parameters occurring in these three models .",
    "finally , we will compare the results obtained within all models mentioned above including the subdiffusion model with the @xmath3 reaction .",
    "as an example of extending the considerations beyond the infinite homogeneous system we will derive the probability describing the random walk of a particle in a system bounded by a partially absorbing wall for both of the reactions described above .",
