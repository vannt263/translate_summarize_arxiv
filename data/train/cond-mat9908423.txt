    "the possibility that very large magnetic structures , such as domain walls and other magnetic solitons , might behave quantum mechanically , is of considerable current interest .",
    "many experiments in disordered magnets have given some indications of domain wall tunneling , but these are difficult to analyse ( as is any other experiment in a disordered sample , either in the classical or quantum regimes ) .",
    "an obvious alternative is to perform experiments on samples containing only 1 or 2 domain walls , with a coercivity controlled by one or a few energy barriers . since the tunneling process is itself stochastic , randomness is still present , but this is of course inevitable in any quantum system .",
    "however even in a completely pure system there is a source of _ intrinsic _ randomness , coming from the nuclear spins , which couple strongly to any magnetic soliton . in this paper , we examine some consequences of nuclear @xmath1 fluctuations for domain wall motion in general ( including tunneling , already discussed in @xcite ) .",
    "we do not propose a complete solution to the problem , but we show how stochastic concepts , not generally associated with quantum problems , may be relevant to the recent single wall tunneling experiments .",
    "the motion of a smooth domain wall can in general be described by some collective coordinate @xmath2 with @xmath3 represent the coordinates in the plane of the wall . to this coordinate",
    "is associated an effective mass @xmath4 , arising from the demagnetisation fields , and the force acting on the wall results from some potential @xmath5 . in many cases , due to the combined effects of demagnetisation and surface energies",
    ", we can consider a flat wall , described by a single coordinate @xmath6 , with an effective mass @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the surface of the wall , @xmath9 its width , and @xmath10 the gyromagnetic factor .",
    "a magnetic field @xmath11 adds a linear `` pressure '' @xmath12 , while a defect or non - magnetic impurity yields an attractive potential @xmath13 .",
    "the problem is then similar to the tunneling of a non - relativistic particle in a potential @xmath5 , and the escape rate of a wall from the combined defect - external field potential is given @xcite , in the absence of dissipation , by @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the `` bare '' wkb tunneling exponent , and @xmath16 is the small oscillation frequency of the wall in the potential . here",
    "@xmath17 is the number of spins in the wall , @xmath18 the wall coercive or `` escape '' field and @xmath19 the saturation magnetisation .",
    "the control parameter @xmath20 goes to zero when @xmath21 .",
    "notice that @xmath22 is also the `` bounce '' frequency of the problem , so that @xmath23 is the barrier traversal time of the wall .",
    "although these results were originally derived for the particular case of a @xmath24 bloch wall and short - ranged defect pinning potential , they have a more general applicability- for small @xmath25 almost any pinning potential acting on the wall will give similar results , and almost any magnetic soliton will have a similar tunneling exponent .",
    "another quantity of experimental interest is the temperature @xmath26 at which quantum tunneling starts to dominate over thermal activation .",
    "usually @xmath27 but it is important to realise that this only estimates a _",
    "crossover _ temperature ( there can be no `` phase transition '' ) and that any meaningful discussion of @xmath26 must include a heat bath , and consequently , dissipation . for wall tunneling ,",
    "detailed discussions have been given of the role of magnons @xcite , electrons @xcite , and phonons @xcite .",
    "a list of references , along with a brief review of both theory and experiments on domain wall tunneling up to mid-1997 , appears in the introduction of dub and stamp @xcite . in the present paper",
    "we wish to further develop our preliminary discussion @xcite of the effect of the nuclear spin bath on magnetic wall dynamics .    before doing so",
    ", we briefly consider the way in which the tunneling experiments are done .",
    "we emphasize that the tunneling relaxation rate @xmath28 it is not directly accessible in experiments- rather , one performs a series of `` trial '' tunneling experiments to establish various probability distributions . the most common method is to `` ramp '' the applied magnetic field and record the field at which a tunneling event occurs .",
    "this yields the so - called `` switching field '' distribution , whose mean and the variance can be related to the tunneling rate @xmath28 .",
    "all the recent experiments on single domain wall tunneling have been based on this method .",
    "let us consider 3 examples .",
    "wernsdorfer et al .",
    "@xcite studied the process of _ homogeneous _ magnetisation reversal in single nickel wires ( but not the depinning process ) . by magnetoresistance measurements , hong and giordano @xcite followed the depinning of a domain wall in a nickel wire .",
    "the exact nature of the soliton was not known , nor the nature of the pinning site ( most likely due to variations in the width of the wire , see ref .",
    "@xcite for similar effects ) , but apparently quantum tunneling took place below @xmath29 . in a further set of experiments , they irradiated the sample with microwaves , causing transitions between the energy levels of the domain wall in the pinning potential , and increasing the transition rate . finally , mangin et al .",
    "@xcite studied the propagation of a domain wall across an energy barrier in a domain wall junction .",
    "preliminary investigations seems to indicate the possibility of quantum tunneling below @xmath30 . for references to some other wall tunneling experiments ,",
    "see dub and stamp @xcite .",
    "the set of nuclear spins @xmath31 couples to the electronic spins @xmath32 by the hyperfine interaction , of strength @xmath33 ) .",
    "the _ intrinsic _ dynamics of the nuclear spins comes from internuclear dipolar interactions @xmath34 , which cause flip - flop transitions between the nuclear spins at a rate @xmath35 .",
    "the exchange energy between electronic spins transforms the microscopic hyperfine interaction into an interaction between the domain wall and all the nuclear spins in it .",
    "this total coupling can then be decomposed into 2 principal terms @xcite :    * ( i ) * a longitudinal potential @xmath36 coming from the sum of the fields produced by the nuclear spins . up to a time",
    "@xmath37 ( where @xmath38 is the lattice parameter ) , the dynamic nuclear spin polarisation performs a random walk , and the ensemble averaged correlation @xmath39 ) for a wall at 2 different positions and times is thus @xmath40 where @xmath41 is a function of the number of nuclear spins swept by the domain wall between positions @xmath42 and @xmath43 . at high temperatures , @xmath44 , a volume containing @xmath45 nuclear spins has root mean square polarisation @xmath46 .",
    "one then finds that for a wall of surface @xmath8 , in which a fraction @xmath47 of all the states are occupied by nuclear spins , @xmath48 .",
    "however at very low t , when @xmath49 , the nuclear spins line up with the electronic spins in the wall , and @xmath50 . thus the wall is trapped in a potential which increases _ linearly _ ( on average ) in both directions away from the wall centre .    *",
    "( ii ) * there is also a transverse term , causing both topological decoherence and dissipation in general @xcite .",
    "it describes the flipping of nuclear spins when the wall moves ; one finds that the number @xmath51 of flipped spins caused by a single excursion between 2 points @xmath52 and @xmath53 ( sweeping out @xmath54 nuclear spins ) is @xmath55 , provided @xmath56 ( which will usually be the case in wall tunneling experiments ) .",
    "the problem we are now interested in is the quantum dynamics of a particle in a 1-dimensional potential fluctuating randomly in time ( in either the quantum or classical regimes ) .",
    "the problem of tunneling in such a potential seems hardly to have been considered before ( we know of only 2 attempts @xcite ) .",
    "we consider here the specific example of a domain wall moving through the fluctuating nuclear field , where as we have just seen , the fluctuating nuclear component @xmath57 adds on to a static or slowly varying ( ie",
    ". , ramped ) bare part @xmath5 .",
    "the nuclear component can either be weak ( as in materials like ni and fe ) , or much larger than the bare part ( as in rare earth magnets ) .    in the _ classical _ regime ,",
    "the decay rate simply depends on the height of the potential barrier , which has fluctuations produced by the nuclear spins contained within the width ( of order @xmath58 ) of this barrier .",
    "the total potential barrier height now has a gaussian probability distribution @xmath59 with mean value @xmath60 and variance @xmath61 .",
    "this implies that the decay rate has a _ log - normal _ distribution @xcite , ie .",
    ", it is the quantity @xmath62 which is gaussian distributed .",
    "furthermore , since @xmath28 can not be larger than @xmath22 by definition , this distribution is truncated at a value @xmath63 ( the appearance of a broad distribution has already been noted in a related problem @xcite , although the connection to the log - normal distribution was missed ) .",
    "the log - normal distribution has some very interesting properties .",
    "if the ratio of the gaussian variance to the gaussian mean is large enough , the tail of the distribution is identical to a broad levy distribution @xcite - the stochastic process is dominated by rare events .",
    "note however that in a genuine levy distribution , the mean and/or variance are formally divergent , which is not the case with the log - normal distribution- in the present problem the average thermal decay rate is @xmath64    although both mean and variance are well defined , the convergence of a series of measurements of @xmath28 ( in a switching field experiment ) to the mean value of the distribution may be extremely slow , because of the truncation of the distribution .",
    "this effect is most pronounced for large gaussian variance @xcite .",
    "notice also that depending on the desired degree of accuracy , a lognormal distribution may be approximated as a `` @xmath65 '' distribution ( ie . , @xmath66 ) , or to give an approximate `` stretched - exponential '' relaxation profile @xcite .    in the _ quantum _ regime ,",
    "the analysis of nuclear spin fluctuations is similar , but slightly more technical @xcite . since the barrier traversal time @xmath67 , the tunneling process takes place in a quasi - static nuclear spin potential .",
    "one can then introduce a `` typical '' potential @xmath68 , where @xmath69 for @xmath70 , where the bare pinning potential @xmath71 has a minimum at @xmath72 , and a tunneling end - point is at @xmath73 .",
    "the value @xmath74 refers to the ensemble - averaged `` gaussian half - width '' value .",
    "this simplification allows the calculation of the tunneling in the limit @xmath75 ; the tunneling exponent becomes @xmath76 , the appearance of the factor @xmath77 coming from the shift of the tunneling end - points by the nuclear potential .",
    "the distribution of the decay rates is now narrower than the log - normal distribution , but the qualitative behaviour is similar to the thermal case .",
    "the average decay rate is now @xmath78 with @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the bare tunneling rate .",
    "we emphasise that these results are valid for @xmath81 , a condition not necessarily satisfied in rare - earth materials .",
    "they also ignore the dissipative effects of phonons , magnons , and electrons , which have been treated previously @xcite .",
    "let us now discuss the experimental consequences of these results .",
    "they apply directly to metals like ni and fe , where hyperfine interactions are weak . for all the experiments mentioned above ,",
    "it is easy to verify that the rate of change @xmath82 of the external `` ramped '' potential is always much smaller than the fluctuation rate of the hyperfine potential . since @xmath83 , the domain wall samples virtually the whole distribution of nuclear spin potentials and the observed relaxation rate is then the @xmath84 described above , in both quantum and classical regimes (",
    "although in the classical regime there will be strong corrections coming from interactions with magnons @xcite ) .",
    "we re - emphasize that the slow convergence of the truncated log - normal distribution should be taken into account in analysing experiments .",
    "finally , we also note that @xmath85 processes may also play a role at not too low @xmath0 ; moreover , nuclear spin fluctuations must certainly affect strongly the low - temperature barkausen noise spectrum in magnets ( particularly rare - earth magnets ) ; these points will be discussed elsewhere .",
