    "in addition to the lattice potential , an `` external '' potential is present , due to the presence of a magnetic trap and also to the optical confinement provided by the gaussian - shaped lattice beams .",

    "we assume for simplicity that the width of @xmath30 is lower or comparable to @xmath31 ( this should hold in the situations where the population in the first excited bloch band is negligible ) .",
    "then , substituting @xmath32 with @xmath33 leads to @xmath34 where we introduced the lattice spacing @xmath35 , a global factor @xmath36 .",
    "the visibility as defined in @xcite follows from @xmath37 where @xmath38 is measured at the first lateral peaks of the interference pattern , _",
    "e.g. _ at @xmath39 , and where the minimum density @xmath40 is measured along a diagonal with the same distance from the central peak , _",

    "when condensed and non - condensed components coexist , the planar momentum distribution @xmath29 splits naturally into a condensate contribution @xmath42 and a non - condensed contribution @xmath43 .",
    "let us first consider the relative scaling of the condensate and non - condensate contributions .",
    "we write the condensate momentum distribution , characterized by the condensed atom number @xmath44 and a momentum width @xmath45 , as @xmath46 where @xmath47 is a periodic , dimensionless function . similarly , introducing the number of of non - condensed atoms @xmath48 , we write the non - condensed contribution as @xmath49 we assume the condensate contribution to produce a sharp interference pattern ( @xmath50 and @xmath51 ) , whereas the non - condensed part extends over the whole brillouin zone ( @xmath52 ) .",
    "the visibility then reads @xmath53 where we introduced @xmath54 which take values of order unity .",
    "the `` suppression factor '' @xmath55 sets the importance of the non - condensed fraction ; if this ratio is very small , then even a tiny condensed number will yield a visibility close to unity .",

    "the momentum width for the condensate is diffraction limited to @xmath58 .",
    "essentially this amounts to the assumption that the _ post - expansion _ momentum distribution of the condensate is a delta function . in @xcite , any structure in the non - condensed component",
    "is neglected , so that @xmath59 is uniform .",

    "@xcite comes from , up to a factor @xmath62 which depends on how the @xmath63 integral is handled . in fig .",
    "[ graphnk ] ( upper panel ) the momentum distribution for such a case is displayed . essentially , the momentum peaks approach delta functions , explaining why tiny condensate fractions can lead to visibilities very close to unity .",
    "we note that a better way of analyzing the visibility , is to measure the weight , i.e. the integral over a peak over a finite area , which accounts for finite resolution effects that are inevitably present in experiments .    .",
    "the upper panel is plotted for a uniform ideal gas with @xmath64 sites and one atom per site , and for a condensed fraction @xmath65  % .",
    "the lower panel is plotted for our harmonic trap model with interactions ( using @xmath66 ) , also for a condensed fraction @xmath65  % and a total number @xmath67 using the trap parameters given in @xcite .",
    "note the vastly different scales on the vertical axes.,width=328 ]",
    "as mentioned above , current experiments are carried out in the presence of a harmonic trap superimposed on the lattice . in this case , one expects the ground state wavefunction to be localized on a scale given by the harmonic potential ground state extension @xmath68 , and not by the `` number of lattice sites '' ( roughly equivalent to the size @xmath25 of the laser beams ) .",
    "in fact , usually one has @xmath69 .",
    "the main point here is that the suppression factor is no longer hopelessly small , especially when most atoms are non - condensed .",
    "however , as well known , this ideal gas model for the condensate is a poor description of realistic experimental situations @xcite .",
    "to obtain a better description , it is necessary to include interatomic interactions in the picture . in the thomas - fermi limit , which usually applies to experimental situations , the in - trap spatial condensate wavefunction will be significantly broader than in the ideal gas case , implying a narrower momentum distribution .",
    "however , as argued above , the post - expansion momentum profile can be very different from the sharply peaked in - trap profile .",
    "first , the interaction energy is released as kinetic expansion energy , and second , for a finite time - of - flight @xmath20 the initial size of the distribution is not necessarily negligible .",
    "due to these effects , the actual momentum distribution will differ from the one calculated using eq .",
    "( [ ntof ] ) .    here , we handle them in a heuristic way , by approximating the maxima in the planar momentum distribution for the condensate as gaussians , @xmath70",
    "we assume an effective spatial width given by the quadratic sum of the initial width @xmath71 and of the expansion width @xmath72 corresponding to the release energy . in momentum space",
    ", this corresponds to @xmath73 . in the thomas - fermi limit , both",
    "the post - expansion momentum width @xmath74 and the initial size @xmath71 are determined by the interaction energy , which itself is proportional to the chemical potential @xmath75 .",
    "accordingly , one has @xmath76 where the coefficients @xmath77 and @xmath78 are of order unity .",
    "the final result is @xmath79 corresponding to a suppression factor @xmath80 proportional to @xmath81 much larger than expected from eq .",
    "( [ vuniform ] ) ( we estimate below the proportionality factor ) .",
    "hence , one expects the observed visibility to follow the evolution of the condensed fraction at least qualitatively .",
    "the argument also holds for the quantum - depleted part of the non - condensed cloud .      to make the preceding arguments more precise , we introduce a semiclassical description of the thermal cloud , for which interaction effects can usually be neglected to a first approximation @xcite .",

    "we can obtain the thermal fraction by integration over phase space , @xmath85 here @xmath86 is a bessel function and @xmath87 the thermal cloud radius .",
    "the critical temperature for condensation follows from eq .",
    "( [ nth ] ) by setting the chemical potential @xmath88 @xcite .",
    "integrating the phase space distribution over position and @xmath63 gives the planar momentum distribution , @xmath89 this takes the form announced in eq .",

    "( [ dk_eff2 ] ) , we impose that our gaussian model should reproduce the same interaction and potential energy as a condensate in the thomas - fermi limit , with chemical potential given by @xcite @xmath90 the potential energy per particle @xcite @xmath91 gives a coefficient @xmath92 .",
    "the coefficient @xmath77 depends on how the interaction energy is redistributed during the expansion .",
    "we consider the two limits , where the interaction energy is entirely concentrated either into the single diffraction peak under consideration ( @xmath93 , or @xmath94 ) , or in the central peak avoided by the visibility measurement ( @xmath66 ) .",
    "this provides upper and lower bounds for the actual visibility .",
    "the results of the calculations is plotted in fig .",
    "[ graphv ] for various assumptions : no trap , ideal gas in a trap , interacting gas in a trap with @xmath66 or @xmath94 . comparing the two latter cases , one sees that the final result depends sensitively on the value of @xmath77 .",
    "a more complete calculation would probably yield a curve lying in between the two bounds plotted .",
    "nevertheless , irrespective of the particular model , the curves demonstrate that the visibility falls well below unity in a broad temperature range , where the condensate fraction stays non - zero .      in conclusion",
    ", we have calculated the visibility of the interference pattern observed when releasing a finite temperature , bose - condensed gas from an optical lattice . using a realistic model for the condensate momentum distribution , we find that the evolution of the visibility with temperature or lattice depth follows the evolution of the condensed fraction at least qualitatively .",
    "we therefore disagree with the conclusion made in ref .",
    "@xcite , that a measured visibility deviating from unity necessarily implies the absence of a bose condensate in the system .",
    "this claim originates essentially from neglecting interaction effects on the gas expansion , which is a valid approximation close or in the mott insulator regime , but a poor one for a system including a sizeable condensate , with or without @xcite an optical lattice .",
    "we do however agree with the authors of @xcite on the importance of finite temperature effects in current experiments , as implied by recent experimental @xcite and theoretical work @xcite , and certainly consider this topic to warrant further investigations ."
