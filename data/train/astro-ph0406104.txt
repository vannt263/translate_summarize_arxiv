    "the scientific interpretation and modeling of the spectra produced by the infrared spectrograph ( irs ; * ? ? ? * ) onboard the _ spitzer _",
    "space telescope @xcite require accurate spectrophotometric calibrations , which depend stars with well known environmental and atmospheric properties .",
    "we have a unique opportunity to use the state - of - the - art marcs - code , developed by the uppsala group and modified substantially in the numerical methods and input line and continuous opacities , to compute synthetic spectra of the irs standard stars .",
    "the iteration between stellar models and instrument calibrations has been described by , with applications to calibrations of the short wavelength spectrometer ( sws ) onboard the infrared space observatory ( iso ) .    in this paper",
    "we describe the synthetic spectra based on the marcs - code model atmospheres tailored to a set of standard stars that are relied upon for the photometric calibration of the irs .",
    "we overview the calibration strategy , and summarize the primary irs stellar standards .",
    "the latest generation model spectra of these stars are discussed , presented in comparison to irs spectra of three standards .",
    "we finally contrast our synthetic spectrum for @xmath7  dra ( k5 iii ) with widely available kurucz model and composite spectra , and summarize the current photometric uncertainties .",
    "the basic strategy for spectrally and photometrically calibrating the irs modules has been outlined by @xcite . each spectral order in the short low and long low ( sl and ll , respectively ; @xmath8 ) long slit spectrographs , and the short high and long high ( sh and lh , respectively ; @xmath9 700 ) echelle spectrographs is individually calibrated      spectral calibrations are determined by observations of a combination of smooth , extended celestial sources , and emission line sources .",
    "the zodiacal light at its maximum intensity and extended nebulae pointed off the central source are useful for determining the order widths , which reflect the widths of the slits , spectrally imaged into the arrays .",
    "the order widths are measured at the 45% crossing point of the illumination profile for each order , and are very nearly 5 pixels for each of the sh and lh echelle orders , and 36 pixels for the low resolution orders . the output signal from the zodiacal light measurements",
    "can also be used to characterize the pixel - to - pixel response variations along the cross - dispersed direction of the sl and ll orders , but is not sufficiently strong for accurately determining these response variations in the high resolution orders .",
    "emission line sources such as be stars p cygni ( b2pe i ) and @xmath7 cas ( b0.5e iv ) , planetary nebulae ngc7027 , ngc6543 , smp083 , and smp031 , and saturnian moon titan all provide strong , unresolved lines to determine the wavelength solutions , spectral resolutions , and instrument profiles . moving the sources to different locations in the slits allows us to further characterize impacts on the wavelength calibration by pointing offsets , and by pixel undersampling of the point spread function ( psf ) .",
    "all four arrays undersample the psf , due to the excellent focus of the telescope and of the f/12 light beamed onto the irs arrays , which maximizes the sensitivities .",
    "however , the undersampling leads to various spectral and photometric complications , such that ( for example ) line centroiding accuracies are reliable to @xmath61/5 a resolution element , about half of the accuracy achievable for a critically sampled psf .",
    "measurements from flight observations of celestial sources supersede the laboratory measurements , carried out in pre - launch tests to verify design requirements .",
    "relative spectral response calibrations are determined by placing photometric standards at as many locations in the slits as is feasible ( executed as fine spectral maps ) , processing and combining the data collection events into a single 2-d image plane , and removing signature of the celestial source by means of the synthetic spectra .",
    "ideally the spectral flatfield for each array is determined by a weighted mean of flats individually derived from different stars ; initially they are determined for each array from a single star .",
    "the resultant flatfield is then applied to observations of other standards , and the spectral extractions are analyzed to determine the flux conversion coefficients ( electrons / second to janskys ) and polynomial `` tuning '' coefficients to correct for the effects of diffraction losses on point source observations , and systematic low frequency residual errors from the flatfielding .",
    "the flatfields are stored as fits image files to be used in the irs basic calibrated data ( bcd ) science pipeline , and the flux conversion and tuning coefficients are stored in ascii - format tables for application to 1-d spectral extractions in the post - bcd science pipeline .",
    "the implementation of the above scheme requires staged efforts . in the science verification ( sv )",
    "phase only sparse spectral maps of the calibration stars could be acquired , and depended on zodiacal light observations to spatially fill in the orders . due to the relatively low zodiacal fluxes ( in sh , lh , and sl-2nd order )",
    ", the effects of psf undersampling , and space weather on the detectors , exhaustive observations of the standard stars continue to be carried out in order to meet the radiometric requirement of 5% .",
    "the details of the stellar atmosphere models are especially important at this stage .",

    "table [ calsources ] summarizes the stars which have been selected and observed during sv and in irs science campaigns for the purposes of photometrically calibrating irs spectroscopy .",
    "the stars were chosen in the pre - launch preparatory phase , to meet ( as closely as possible ) specific criteria on the availability of observational data to make reasonable estimates of the stellar parameters ( described in the next section ) , their environments , and absence of chromospheric activity , circumstellar dust shell or disk , multiplicity , or peculiar spectral activity .",
    "the irs operating at low resolution is @xmath6300 times more sensitive than sws was at 10 @xmath0 m , and consequently the fainter standard stars may meet the aforementioned requirements to a lesser extent than stars in the iso calibration programs .",
    "we make use of observations from the iso ground - based preparatory program and detailed theoretical work where possible .",
    "in particular , hr  6688 , hr  6705 , hr  7310 , and hr  2491 in table  [ calsources ] have been previously modeled by @xcite using ground - based and 2.4  12@xmath0 m iso - sws spectroscopy .",
    "generally , g - k giants are used to calibrate the lh , ll , and sh modules , and the a dwarfs to calibrate sl .",
    "this balance is struck by the higher potential for debris disks around the a stars , and non - photospheric molecular and dust layers around late - type m giants .",
    "the selection of the g and k standard stars was nevertheless made on a very restricted basis : several infrared studies based on the co @xmath10 lines ( at 2.3@xmath0 m ) and the co @xmath11 lines ( at 4.6@xmath0 m ) have revealed a thermal dichotomic structure in the outer layers of later - type stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "a new set of theoretical reference seds has been calculated using the marcs and turbospectrum code , using the same physical input parameters of atomic and molecular equilibrium constants , solar abundances , continuous opacity sources , etc .",
    ", as the ones described by @xcite . for line opacities in the irs spectral range , a database of infrared lines with atomic and molecular transitions ( co , sio , h@xmath12o , oh , nh , hf , hcl , ch , and no ) has been prepared .",
    "references and discussion of the inputs can be found in @xcite .",
    "the standard assumptions of homogeneous stationary layers , hydrostatic equilibrium and lte were made .",
    "energy conservation was required for radiative and convective flux , where the energy transport due to convection was treated through a local mixing - length theory .",
    "the turbulent pressure was neglected .",
    "the rosseland optical depth scale has been chosen to span values from 6@xmath1310@xmath14 to 300 in order to ensure the fulfillment of the diffusion approximation adopted as lower boundary condition for all frequencies , and to minimize the the number of frequencies for which the surface layers are still optically thick .",

    "nevertheless , it should be noted that since the final calibration of the iso - sws relative spectral response functions ( rsrf ) was also based on marcs model atmospheres , the irs spectral response calibration and methods to iterate between the input parameters and spectroscopy ( e.g. , ) are linked to the sws - rsrfs .",

    "the uncertainties associated with the zodiacal light model ( including the likely presence of silicate dust bands ) , and with the aperture solid angles , limit the accuracy of the corrections to @xmath620% at any wavelength . a residual tilt may also remain from the fact that both extended and point source signal may fall through the slits , while calibrations are based solely on point sources ( such that corrections for diffraction losses would not be adequately compensated by simple scalings using a zodiacal light model ) .",
    "the photometric calibration schemes of the iso and _ spitzer _ instruments have been partly based on templated datasets , such as those constructed by m. cohen and collaborators ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , with both observational and theoretical components to them .",
    "the cohen datasets can be divided into three categories : ( a ) a collection of absolutely calibrated photometric and spectroscopic data , merged to create a continuous spectrum with uncertainties traceable to a specific group of stars such as @xmath36 tau and vega ; ( b ) a kurucz model adopted at a literature concensus of , log(g ) , and metallicity , then fit to available photometry ; and ( c ) a template constructed from a star from ( a ) and/or ( b ) with the same spectral type , and scaled to the observed photometric data . stars with the same spectral type may exhibit a different abundance pattern , affecting e.g.  the sio band strengths and continuum levels .",
    "products in the ( a ) group when available are helpful to the irs since they rely on no theoretical assumptions , _ except _ for the use of an engelke function at @xmath37 @xmath38 20 @xmath0 m , and some products in the ( c ) group are also useful for `` testcase '' standards which can be observed to monitor the external photometric stability of the instrument in conjunction with pointing performance of the spacecraft , aot repeatibility , and statistical measures .",
    "a number of stars not listed in table  [ calsources ] are being observed in normal operations for these activities , and we rely on products in groups ( a ) and ( c ) for stars whose individual value is their membership in the ensemble .    for the stars listed in table  [ calsources ] , we rely explicitly on the marcs synthetic spectra for the detailed calibration analyses , noting that while a composite is available for hr  6705 @xcite , it makes use of an engelke function extrapolation beyond 18.5 @xmath0 m , which we prefer to avoid ( see next paragraph ) . for a wider ( secondary ) set of stars , which are generally too uncertain in their stellar or environmental parameters to initially justify the computational resources of marcs modeling , we can use composite observations templated by spectral type and luminosity class , or kurucz synthetic spectra with the understanding that they are calculated assuming a plane - parallel geometry , solar abundances ( scaled to the metallicity ) , and a microturbulent velocity of 2 km s@xmath20 , while these are all free input parameters for the marcs atmosphere models .",
    "note also that some of the line lists for diatomic molecules used in kurucz models are fifteen years old , incomplete , and do not reproduce line positions very well for high @xmath39 and high @xmath40 .",
    "the stars of this group are typically used for trending and checks of order - to - order and module - to - module calibrations , and response to high and low flux point sources .    to illustrate these differences over the mid - ir spectral range , we show three datasets created for hr  6705 in fig .",
    "[ gamdra ] .",
    "the composite constructed by @xcite is plotted in black , with the photometric points and the various spectral fragments indicated .",
    "of great importance to the irs occurs at @xmath41@xmath0 m , where fluxes are approximated with the engelke function @xcite , which offers an analytical implicit scaling of a semi - empirical solar atmospheric temperature profile to differing effective temperatures .",
    "this analytical ( plane - parallel ) approximation should be valid for the 260@xmath0 m continuum for giants and dwarfs with effective temperature 3500k @xmath42  @xmath42 6000k , where scattering of electrons from h@xmath43 dominates the continuum opacity . by fitting this function to a set of standard stars , @xcite concluded that the estimated probable error in estimated flux is @xmath44% below 10@xmath0 m , up to @xmath45% in the vicinity of 25@xmath0 m , and 6% at 60@xmath0 m .",
    "the main spectral difference between the marcs and kurucz theoretical spectra is the absence of the sio fundamental ( around 8@xmath0 m ) and first - overtone ( around 4@xmath0 m ) lines in the kurucz spectrum .",
    "smaller differences do occur due to the use of a different abundance pattern . with an extension @xmath46 being only 3.7%",
    ", the spectral differences between a plane - parallel and spherical geometry are only marginal .",
    "the lowermost plot in fig .",
    "[ gamdra ] focuses on the wavelength ranges of the sl , ll , sh , and lh modules .",
    "two main differences between the 3 data - sets are of major concern for irs calibrations : ( 1 ) around 8@xmath0 m where the sio @xmath1 lines occur , and ( 2 ) for @xmath41@xmath0 m .    \\(1 ) comparison to the lrs data indicates that the abundance pattern used as input for the marcs model and synthetic spectrum calculation should be altered , in particular the oxygen ( and carbon ) abundance . with the moderate resolution of irs ( @xmath47 ) and the sl mode only starting around 5@xmath0 m ( being in the middle of the co @xmath11 band for cool giants ) , it will be very difficult to constrain the stellar parameters ( and in this case more specifically the oxygen abundance ) from the irs data .",
    "this situation can be avoided by relying on a dwarfs and g giants in this wavelength range .",
    "\\(2 ) at ll and lh wavelengths , we see a clear difference between the slope of the marcs , kurucz , and cohen ( engelke ) spectrum . with the engelke function being a plane - parallel approximation , we have compared this function with marcs plane - parallel spectra for  between 3500 and 6000k for different values of the gravity .",
    "the best agreement occurs for = 6000k , which is not surprising since engelke s function is based on a scaled solar model . for lower effective temperatures , the role of the gravity becomes more important : a higher gravity results in a higher opacity ( from the free - free transitions of h@xmath43 ) , a more compact object and a smaller temperature gradient due to the requirement of flux conservation . as a consequence ,",
    "the infrared continuum slope ( @xmath48@xmath0 m ) is less steep for a higher gravity model . from a comparison with the marcs continua",
    ", we may conclude that the uncertainties quoted by @xcite do not account well for the influence of gravity . for hr  6705",
    ", the difference in slopes between the model and the composite spectrum ( using an engelke function at @xmath49 18.75  @xmath0 m ) produces _ systematic _ underpredictions of fluxes in the composite by 4.2% at 30  @xmath0 m , and 6.3% at 70  @xmath0 m .",
    "these differences are easily within grasp of the sensitive irs and the mips detectors .",
    "first , we estimate that for well - pointed observations of point sources , the relative photometric uncertainties within any spectral order generally meet the 5% radiometric requirement , over the spectral ranges committed to observers .",
    "the exception is the two reddest orders of lh ( 34.2  37.2 @xmath0 m ) , where throughput response to hr  6688 is low , and will be improved with hr  6705 calibration observations by the time that this paper is published .",
    "it must also be noted that the ranges of 14.115.4  @xmath0 m in sl 1st order and 3842.4 @xmath0 m in ll 1st order may be contaminated with light from around 78 and 1921 @xmath0 m , respectively , due to a weakness in the transmission cutoff of the filter in the 2nd spectral orders .",
    "the level of contamination depends on the color of the source in the slit .",
    "the photometric performance of the irs is very sensitive to pointing effects , due to the sizes of the slits and the psf widths .",
    "combined with the effects of psf undersampling , the absolute flux calibration is estimated at this point to be uncertain by 20% in the sh and lh data overall , and 15% in sl and ll data .",
    "generally , order - to - order calibrations are 10% or less , for point sources in the low background ( or background - corrected ) limit and well - placed in the center or nod positions of the slits .",
    "the errors are easily recognized , and can be mitigated by scaling to photometry , where available ."
