    "the flavor evolution of supernova ( sn ) neutrinos , is strongly impacted by the self - induced effects , associated with instabilities induced by the the neutrino - neutrino interactions in the deepest stellar regions  @xcite ( see also  @xcite for a recent review ) . in this context a key ingredient in the characterization of these effects is related to the current - current nature of low - energy weak interactions , which implies a `` multi - angle term ''  @xcite @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the neutrino velocity  @xcite . till recently",
    ", all studies have assumed the axial symmetry for this term , that would then depend only on the zenith - angle .",
    "it has been shown that the `` multi - zenith - angle '' ( mza ) term in some cases can hinder the maintenance of the coherent oscillation behavior for different neutrino modes  @xcite .    a valuable tool to diagnose the possible instabilities of a dense neutrino gas is given by the linearized stability analysis of the neutrino equations of motion .",
    "the linearized equations including generic azimuthal and zenith angle distributions for neutrinos were first worked out in  @xcite . then , the formalism for the azimuthal symmetric case was further developed in  @xcite .",
    "the stability method would allow one to determine the possible onset of the flavor conversions , seeking for an exponentially growing solution of the eigenvalue problem , associated with the linearized equations of motion for the neutrino ensemble .",
    "recently , this method has been applied in  @xcite removing the assumption of axial symmetry in the @xmath6 propagation . as a result , a multi - azimuthal - angle ( maa )",
    "instability was found in addition to the bimodal  @xcite and mza ones  @xcite . in particular , it was considered a neutrino ensemble with a strong excess of @xmath7 over @xmath8 , as expected during the sn accretion phase ( at post - bounce times @xmath9  s ) . in this situation , the instability has been found in normal mass hierarchy ( nh , @xmath10 ) , where the system would have been stable imposing the perfect axial symmetry .",
    "subsequently , the role of this instability has been clarified in  @xcite with simple toy models .",
    "the discovery of the new maa effects , has also motivated first numerical studies of the non - linear neutrino propagation equations in sn , introducing the azimuthal angle as angular variable in the multi - angle kernel , in addition to the usual zenith angle  @xcite .",
    "remarkably it was considered the @xmath6 propagation only along a radial direction , i.e. a local solution along a specific line of sight , under the assumption that the transverse variations of the global solution are small . in this approximation , for the unstable case discussed above , maa effects lead in nh to spectral swaps and splits analogous to what produced in inverted hierarchy ( ih , @xmath11 ) by the known bimodal instability  @xcite also in a completely isotropic neutrino gas  @xcite .",
    "all these recent works assume that the maa effects can develop without any matter hindrance .",
    "remarkably , a crucial ingredient to be considered to determine the impact of self - induced flavor instabilities is the ordinary matter term , associated with the net electron densities @xmath12 in sne .",
    "as pointed out in  @xcite for the axial - symmetric case , when @xmath12 is not negligible with respect to the neutrino density @xmath13 , the large phase dispersion induced by the matter for @xmath6 s traveling in different directions , would partially or totally suppress the self - induced oscillations through peculiar mza effects .",
    "recent studies of this case performed with realistic sn models , indicates that this situation is realized during the supernova accretion phase ( at post - bounce times @xmath9  s ) . as a consequence",
    ", the self - induced flavor conversions found in ih in the axial - symmetric models are strongly inhibited  @xcite .    from a preliminary schematic study done in  @xcite it results that the matter density required to suppress the mma instability in nh",
    "is larger than the one necessary to suppress the self - induced conversions in ih for the axial symmetric case .",
    "motivated by these previous results , we find it is mandatory to understand what is the role of the dense matter on the maa effects during the accretion phase . we will use as benchmark for the neutrino and matter density profiles the sn models from recent long term simulations of core - collapse explosions , performed by the basel - darmstadt model .",
    "these were already considered by some of us in  @xcite .",
    "the plan of our work is as follows . in sec .  2 we present the neutrino equations of flavor evolution without imposing axial asymmetry .",
    "then , we describe the setup to perform the stability analysis of the linearized equations of motion . in sec .",
    "3 we present the results of the stability analysis and we compare them with the numerical solution of the equations .",
    "we focus on the accretion phase for two different sn progenitor models . finally , in sec .",
    "4 we comment on our results and we conclude .",
    "in the axial symmetric case , the sn neutrino flavor evolution is described by ordinary differential equations  @xcite , characterizing the flavor changes along a radial direction .",
    "when axial symmetry is broken by the maa effects , in order to get the global solution of the problem in general one would consider also variations along the transverse direction to the neutrino propagation .",
    "this would imply passing from ordinary to partial differential equations , with a big layer of complication in the numerical solution .",
    "however , in our study we are mostly interested in answering the question of the stability of the dense neutrino gas under mma effects , in the presence of a large matter term .",
    "therefore , _ before _ the maa instability emerges , we can still consider the ordinary differential equations in the only radial direction .",
    "these are enough to determine which cases are completely stable under maa effects . in the other cases , in which the maa instability develops",
    ", these equations would be useful to determine the onset radius of the flavor conversions .",
    "nevertheless , the subsequent flavor evolution can be taken just as indicative , since it is based on the assumption that variations in the transverse direction always remain small .    under this approximation",
    ", the flavor evolution depends only on @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath5 .",
    "then , following  @xcite we write the equations of motion for the flux matrices @xmath16 as function of the radial coordinate .",
    "we use negative energy @xmath15 for anti - neutrinos . following the usual prescription",

    "we normalize the flux matrices to the @xmath22 number flux at the neutrinosphere .",

    "we work in a two - flavor scenario , associated with the atmospheric mass - square difference @xmath26  ev@xmath27 and a small ( matter suppressed ) in - medium mixing @xmath28 .",
    "we will always consider nh , where maa effect could emerge for the flux ordering we are considering .",
    "the matrix @xmath29 in flavor basis , contains the net electron density and is responsible for the mikheyev - smirnov - wolfenstein ( msw ) matter effect  @xcite with the ordinary background .",
    "finally , the term at second line represents the @xmath6-@xmath6 refractive term , where @xmath30 . in the multi - angle term of eq .",
    "( [ eq : eom2 ] ) , the radial velocity of a mode with angular label @xmath31 is @xmath32  @xcite and the transverse velocity is @xmath33  @xcite .",

    "concerning neutrino emission model , in order to simplify the complexity of our numerical simulations of the flavor evolution , we assume all @xmath6 s to be represented by a single energy , that we fix at @xmath39  mev . this approximation is reasonable since our main purpose is to determine only if the dense matter effects block the development of the self - induced transformations .      in order to perform the stability analysis , we linearize the equations of motion [ eq .",

    "we find that the @xmath84 function in this case is completely suppressed .",

    "this result is consistent with the output of the numerical simulations that show for all the considered time snapshots @xmath98 .",
    "finally we mention that in  @xcite it has been claimed that possible residual scatterings could affect @xmath6 s after the neutrinosphere , producing a small `` neutrino halo '' that would broaden the @xmath6 angular distributions  @xcite at @xmath99  km .",

    "<S> it has been recently pointed out that removing the axial symmetry in the `` multi - angle effects '' associated with the neutrino - neutrino interactions for supernova ( sn ) neutrinos , a new multi - azimuthal - angle ( maa ) instability would arise . in particular , for a flux ordering @xmath0 , as expected during the sn accretion phase , this instability occurs in the normal neutrino mass hierarchy . </S>",
    "<S> however , during this phase the ordinary matter density can be larger than the neutrino one , suppressing the self - induced conversions . at this regard </S>",
    "<S> , we investigate the matter suppression of the maa effects , performing a linearized stability analysis of the neutrino equations of motion , in the presence of realistic sn density profiles . </S>",
    "<S> we compare these results with the numerical solution of the sn neutrino non - linear evolution equations . </S>",
    "<S> assuming axially symmetric distributions of neutrino momenta we find that the large matter term strongly inhibits the maa effects . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the hindrance becomes stronger including realistic forward - peaked neutrino angular distributions . as a result , in our model for a @xmath1  @xmath2 iron - core sne </S>",
    "<S> , maa instability does not trigger any flavor conversion during the accretion phase . instead , </S>",
    "<S> for a @xmath3  @xmath2 o - ne - mg core sn model , with lower matter density profile and less forward - peaked angular distributions , flavor conversions are possible also at early times . </S>"
