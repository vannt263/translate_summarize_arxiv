    "wave scattering from irregular surfaces continues to present formidable theoretical and computational challenges @xcite , especially with regard to analytical treatment of statistics , and numerical solution for wave incidence at low grazing angles @xcite , where the insonified / illuminated region may become very large .",
    "computationally , the cost of the necessary matrix inversion scales badly with wavelength and domain size and can rapidly become prohibitive ; this is compounded by the large number of green s function evaluations , whose overall cost is therefore sensitive to the form which this function takes . under the assumption of purely forward - scattering ,",
    "a successful approach has been the parabolic integral equation method ( pie)@xcite .",
    "this makes use of a ` one - way ' parabolic equation ( pe ) green s function , leading to the replacement of the helmholtz integral equations by their small - angle analogue . for 2d problems this green s function takes a particularly tractable form ;",
    "this , together with the volterra ( one - sided ) form of the governing integral operator , affords the key advantage of high numerical efficiency , and in the perturbation regime allows derivation of analytical results @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the method yields no information about the field scattered back towards the source .    on the other hand , where backscatter is required ,",
    "operator series solution methods such as left - right splitting and method of ordered multiple interactions @xcite have proved highly versatile , in both 2 and 3 dimensions .",
    "these use the full free - space green s function and proceed by expanding the surface fields about the dominant ` forward - going ' component , and thereby circumvent the difficulties of tackling the full helmholtz equations .    in this paper",
    "we combine these approaches , extending the standard pie description to a ` two - way ' method , thus allowing for both left- and right - travelling waves .",
    "this is obtained in the obvious way by replacing the parabolic equation green s function by a form symmetrical in range",
    ". the integral operator can be split into left- and right - going parts ; under the assumption that forward scattering dominates , the solution can then be written as a series and truncated .",
    "every term of this series is a product of volterra operators and is therefore treated as efficiently as the standard pie method , which corresponds approximately to truncation at the first term .    in the second part of the paper",
    "we impose the additional restriction to the perturbation regime of small surface height @xmath0 , within which analytical expressions for the mean field and autocorrelation function are obtained .",
    "this extends the corresponding results@xcite derived under the pie method .",
    "the approach there was first to obtain the scattered field to second order in @xmath0 at the mean surface plane , and find the far - field under the assumption that propagation outwards from the surface is governed by the full helmholtz equation . in the standard pe case",
    ", this modification allows a small amount of backscatter , but precludes any backscatter enhancement which can be thought of as due to coherent addition of reversible paths@xcite , because interactions at the surface are assumed to be take place in the forward direction only .",
    "the formulation presented here allows one to remove this restriction , and separate the forward and backward going interactions to various orders , although this aspect is not explored in detail here .",
    "in particular this method produces a correction term , whose statistics can be obtained in the perturbation regime .",
    "the paper is organised as follows : the standard parabolic integral equation method and preliminary results are given in section [ i ] .",
    "in section [ ii ] the full two - way parabolic integral equation method is set out , and the iterative solution explained .",
    "analytical results for the statistics under the extended method are derived in section [ iii ] .",

    "this is the analogue of equation ( 2 ) , effectively containing a back - scatter correction .",
    "taking the limit of ( 7 ) as @xmath41 yields an integral equation relating the incident field to the scattered field at the surface : ( x , h(x ) ) = -_0^g(_s, ) ( )z dx [ 8 ] where now @xmath42 , @xmath40 both lie on the surface .",
    "( note that the addition of a correction to the parabolic equation is closely related to a method proposed by thorsos@xcite . )",
    "equations ( 7 ) , ( 8) can be written in operator notation : _ s ( x , z ) = -(l+r)z [ 9 ] ( x , h(x ) ) = ( l+r)z [ 10 ] where @xmath43 , @xmath44 are defined by lf(x , z)=_0^x g(, ) f(x ) dx ,   rf(x , z)=_x^g(, ) f(x ) dx and @xmath39 , @xmath40 . these integral operators and their inverses",
    "are volterra , or ` one - sided ' in an obvious sense .",
    "the main computational task in any such boundary integral method is the inversion of the integral equation ( [ 10 ] ) .",
    "one of the principal advantages of the standard forward - going pie method ( equations ( [ 1])-([2 ] ) ) is that its one - way form allows gaussian elimination to be used , so that inversion is highly efficient . in the above two - way formulation this advantage",
    "is initially lost , since direct inversion of @xmath45 in eq .",
    "( [ 10 ] ) offers no benefit compared with solving the full helmholtz equations .",
    "however , the computational advantage can be regained by forming an iterative series solution , in which each term is a product of volterra integral operators .",
    "integral equation ( [ 10 ] ) has formal solution = ( l+r)^-1[11 ] which can be expanded in a series = [ 12 ]    under the assumption that @xmath44 is small in the following sense the series ( [ 12 ] ) is convergent , as is already required implicitly for the standard pie solution ; the series can then be truncated after finitely many terms . by ` small ' we mean that @xmath46 is small for all terms @xmath47 in the series .",
    "it can be shown that this assumption is indeed justified at low grazing angles for surfaces whose slopes are not too large , since the kernel of @xmath44 oscillates rapidly especially at small wavelengths .",
    "it is nevertheless difficult to give this a precise range of validity , and we will not attempt to do so here .",
    "solution for the field can therefore be obtained by truncating the series ( [ 12 ] ) and substituting into the integral ( [ 7 ] ) .",
    "the _ first term _",
    "@xmath48 in series ( [ 12 ] ) corresponds to the solution for @xmath29 under the standard pie method ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "denote this first approximation by @xmath49 , i.e. = l^-1 . [ 13 ] note however that the integral ( [ 7 ] ) allows for outgoing components scattered to the left , unlike its pie analogue ( [ 2 ] ) , so even this lowest order truncation gives backscatter .",
    "this can be considered the _",
    "direct backscatter _ component .",
    "truncation of ( [ 12 ] ) at the _ second term _ gives : + c [ 14 ] where @xmath50 is a correction term , c= l^-1rl^-1_i .",
    "[ 15 ] the above expression will be used in section [ iii ] to obtain some statistical measure of the backscattered component in the perturbation regime of small surface height .",
    "we remark that this is the lowest - order truncation consistent with reversible ray paths .      the general term of ( [ 12 ] )",
    "is a product of the operators @xmath51 and @xmath44 .",
    "evaluation of the integral @xmath44 is straightforward . for computational purposes",
    "we assume that the incident wave insonifies only a finite region of the rough surface ; the source may for example be a gaussian beam . a finite upper limit of integration @xmath52 , say ,",
    "may then be assumed .",

    "<S> this paper extends the parabolic integral equation method , which is very effective for forward scattering from rough surfaces , to include backscatter . </S>",
    "<S> this is done by applying left - right splitting to a modified two - way governing integral operator , to express the solution as a series of volterra operators ; this series describes successively higher - order surface interactions between forward and backward going components , and allows highly efficient numerical evaluation . </S>",
    "<S> this and equivalent methods such as ordered multiple interactions have been developed for the full helmholtz integral equations , but not previously applied to the parabolic green s function . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the form of this green s function allows the mean field and autocorrelation to be found analytically to second order in surface height . </S>",
    "<S> these may be regarded as backscatter corrections to the standard parabolic integral equation method .    </S>",
