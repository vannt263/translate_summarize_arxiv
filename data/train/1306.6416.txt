    "a similar procedure has been adopted to reduce the flat - fielded ( flt ) wfpc2 images .",
    "since the acs images heavily suffer from geometric distortions within the field of view , we corrected the instrumental positions of stars by applying the equations reported by @xcite .",
    "we then placed , through cross - correlation , the acs and the wfpc2 data sets on the same astrometric system of the wfc3 sample , for which the astrometric solution has an accuracy of @xmath14 in both right ascension and declination @xcite .",

    "during a systematic study of the gc m28 aimed at searching for the companion stars to binary msps , we found a peculiar object ( see figure [ map ] ) located at @xmath15 and @xmath16 , in very good agreement with the position of the x - ray source # 23 reported by @xcite and of the variable atca radio source discussed by pavan et al .",
    "( atel # 4981 )",
    ".    in ep2 this star showed a strong and irregular variability in each filter , on a timescale of @xmath17 hours ( figure [ time ] ) . based on the mean magnitudes ( @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 )",
    ", this star turns out to be about 0.5 - 1 magnitude fainter than the main sequence ( ms ) turn off ( to ) and bluer than the ms both in the ( , - ) and in the ( , - ) color magnitude diagrams ( cmds ; see figure [ cmd ] ) .",
    "even more interesting is the comparison of the photometric properties among the three epochs of observations . unlike the cmd location in ep2 , the magnitudes derived for ep1 ( @xmath22 and @xmath23 ) and for ep3 ( @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 ) approximately locate the star onto the ms",
    "unfortunately , given the different instruments and filters , it is not possible to directly compare the magnitudes but , both from the visual inspection of images ( see figure [ map ] ) and from the cmd locations with respect to the to point , it turns out that during ep1 and ep3 the star was about 2 - 3 magnitudes fainter than the to , and hence @xmath27 mag fainter than in ep2 .",
    "this likely indicates that the observations during ep1 and ep3 sampled the object in quiescence , while ep2 data caught the star in an outburst state .",
    "in addition , during each epoch a magnitude modulation is present , with an indication of a smaller amplitude in ep3 with respect to the variability detected during the ep2 outbursting state .",
    "in fact , the frame - to - frame magnitude scatter of the peculiar star during the outburst epoch ( ep2 ) is @xmath28 larger than the scatter of normal stars in the same magnitude bin , while this value decreases to @xmath29 in ep3 .    in principle , for actively accreting lmxbs ,  emission is expected from the accretion disk , while the contribution from the heated companion star should be minimal or even absent .",
    "a visual inspection of ep2 images already suggests that this peculiar star also has  excess : in fact , in the  image ( panel @xmath30 in figure [ map ] ) it is significantly brighter than its southern neighbor , while these two objects show essentially the same magnitude in broad band filters ( as the , see panel @xmath31 in figure [ map ] ) . in order to quantify this excess we used a photometric technique based on the comparison between the magnitudes obtained from broad band and  narrow filters @xcite . in particular , in this work we used a method",
    "commonly applied to star forming regions ( de marchi et al . , 2010 ) and recently tested for the first time in the gc 47tucanae ( beccari et al . , mnras submitted ; see also * ? ? ?",
    "first of all , we corrected all magnitudes for reddening by adopting @xmath32 @xcite , then we selected the peculiar star in the ( -)@xmath33 vs ( -)@xmath33 color - color diagram . note",
    "that this color combination well samples the continuum of stars with no  emission for different spectral types through the ( -)@xmath33 color index , and it provides a good estimate of the  emission through the ( -)@xmath33 color index , since the  line contribution to the  band is negligible .",
    "the  excess ( @xmath34 ) can be evaluated from the distance between the ( -)@xmath33 color index of the considered star and an empirical line color as function of ( -)@xmath33 for stars with combined photometric error smaller than 0.05 magnitudes .",
    "as shown in figure [ halpha ] , this empirical relation agrees very well with the theoretical one , obtained from atmospheric models @xcite .",
    "we also emphasize that , while m28 may be affected by mild differential reddening , the reddening vector is almost parallel to the empirical line tracing the continuum ( see figure [ halpha ] ) .",
    "this means that even large fluctuations in the reddening of individual stars would not significantly affect the identification of objects with  excess @xcite .",
    "] representative of the continuum .",
    "in addition , the equivalent width ( ew ) of the  emission can be quantitatively estimated from @xmath34  by applying equation ( 4 ) in @xcite : @xmath35 $ ] , where rw is the rectangular width of the filter , ( see table 4 in * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "with such a method we estimated the  excess ( @xmath36 ; upper panel in figure [ halpha ] ) and the ew of the  emission ( @xmath37  , where the uncertainties take into account the errors in both colors ) during the ep2 outburst state . by applying an analogous method",
    "to ep3 data , making use of a suitable combination of ,  and  filters , we find that the star is located on the continuum reference line during its quiescent state ( see the lower panel in figure [ halpha ] ) .",
    "hence there is no indication of  emission in that epoch .    finally , we tried to investigate the possible presence of uv emission by using the ep1 dataset in filters  and .",
    "no source is detected at the location of the peculiar star , most probably because the images are not deep enough to reach its faint magnitudes .",
    "the photometric analysis revealed the presence of a very peculiar star , which underwent a strong luminosity increase and showed significant  excess in ep2 . even if this optical outburst occurred a few years before the integral discovery , this evidence , combined with the positional coincidence with the atca variable source recently detected by pavan et al .",
    "( atel # 4981 ) and with the chandra x - ray source # 23 revealed by @xcite and firmly associated to  by homan ( atel # 5045 ) , strongly suggests that we have identified the optical counterpart to . indeed",
    "several outbursts separated by a few years delay are quite typical of lmxbs containing a ns ( e.g 4u 1608 - 52 , aquila x-1 ; * ? ? ?",
    "unlikely , the poor and irregular time coverage of our data prevented us to firmly determine the period of the magnitude modulation , which is expected to be correlated with the binary orbital motion .",
    "however , the non regular shape of the light curve ( likely due to an insufficient sampling of the orbital period ) , seems to suggest that the variability is occurring in a timescale a few times shorter than the duration of the observations ( @xmath38 hours ) .",
    "this seems to be in agreement with the known properties of previously identified low mass x - ray transients , that have orbital periods in the range between 40 min and 4.3 hours @xcite and even shorter in gcs ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and reference therein ) .    during the quiescent state",
    "the companion star is approximately located on the ms , @xmath39 magnitudes fainter than the to , while during the outburst it is @xmath27 magnitudes brighter and it is characterized by a bluer color .",
    "as known from the study of companions to msps and lmxbs , such an anomalous position is indicative of a perturbed state ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in fact tidal deformations , heating processes and the presence of an accretion disk can significantly affect the magnitude and temperature of the star ( e. dalessandro et al .",
    ", in preparation ) , thus also altering its position in the cmds .",
    "the main tool to discriminate between these effects is the determination of the light curve shape , but the available data - sets prevent us to perform this study .",
    "finally , the presence of strong  emission ( with @xmath40  ) during the outburst phase suggests the presence of material accreting onto the ns . on the other hand ,",
    "no  has been detected in quiescence , in agreement with the fact that when the accretion rate is slow , the disk is much weaker and the  absorption from the companion star dominates the spectrum .",
    "further optical studies are required to better constrain this system .",
    "first of all , a photometric follow up , with a suitable time sampling is needed to obtain accurate light curves and hence constrain the orbital parameters of the system . also a spectroscopic analysis ,",
    "that , given the high crowding and the relative faint magnitude , is possible only during a bright state , could help to characterize such system and the possible presence of an accretion disk through the study of the radial velocity curve , the chemical abundance patterns and uv emission lines . however to properly derive the companion radial velocity curve , it is needed to detect the spectral lines associated with the companion and to avoid those coming from the accretion disk .",
