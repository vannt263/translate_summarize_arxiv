    "parity - violating electron scattering ( pves ) has become an established component of the nuclear physics research program at a variety of accelerators .",
    "prior to the late 1990 s , the field was considered somewhat esoteric , with the completion of roughly one experiment per decade : the deep inelastic @xmath1 experiment at slac in the 1970s@xcite ; the quasielastic beryllium experiment at mainz in the 1980s@xcite ; and the elastic carbon measurement culminating in a publication in 1990@xcite . in the last few years",
    ", the rate at which new results are being reported has accelerated dramatically compared that of the past 30 years , and in the next several years , we anticipate even more results from the sample collaboration at mit - bates@xcite , the happex@xcite , g0@xcite , pavex@xcite , and q - weak@xcite collaborations at jefferson lab , the a4 experiment at mainz@xcite , and the e158 experiment at slac@xcite .",
    "looking further down the road , the prospective up - grade of cebaf may open up additional possibilities for pves studies beyond those currently on the books . suffice it to say ,",
    "pves has come into its own as an important tool for the study of a broad range of questions in nuclear and particle physics , moving far beyond its earlier incarnation as an almost exotic area of physics ( for a review , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    at the end of the day",
    ", what physics do we hope to have accomplished with this tool , and what important questions do we hope the field will have answered ? in this talk ,",
    "i would like to give my view . at the same time",
    ", i will discuss some recent developments that have opened up new directions for study of both hadron structure and particle physics .",
    "of course , this theorist s perspective will be weighted in favor of new theory , but i want to emphasize that these theoretical developments would have only academic interest were it not for the substantial progress on the experimental side .",
    "in fact , one of the attractive features of the pves community is the close interplay between theory and experiment .",
    "the proper interpretation of the very tiny asymmetries measured with pves requires careful theoretical delineation of various contributions .",
    "conversely , the judicious choice of target and kinematics , together with hard - nosed experimental study of the systematic effects that could generate false \" asymmetries , provide theorists with a clean and unambiguous probe of nucleon structure and the weak interaction .",
    "this kind of syngergy between theory and experiment is a hallmark of our field .",
    "the present burst of activity in the field has been motivated by a desire to probe the strange quark content of the nucleon .",
    "understanding strange quarks is important from a number of perspectives :    _ flavor decomposition of nucleon properties_. how much do the different flavors of light quarks contribute to the low - energy properties of the nucleon ?",
    "for many years , the standard lore was that up- and down - quark degrees of freedom were sufficient to account for the most familiar aspects of the nucleon , such as its mass , spin , and magnetic moment .",
    "analyses of the @xmath2n @xmath3-term suggested that light - quarks were not , in fact , the whole story , and that possibly 20 - 30% of @xmath4 came from @xmath5 pairs@xcite .",
    "later , polarized deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) measurements implied that only 30% of the nucleon spin came from quark spin , with the remainder being supplied by quark orbital angular momentum and by gluons@xcite .",
    "part of the picture associated with the spin - crisis \" was that the fraction of nucleon spin coming from @xmath5 pairs was about 10% , and that these pairs were polarized opposite to the direction of the total spin . in the quark model framework , this idea is a complete mystery . as a result , one would like to know what other nucleon properties are substantially affected by strangeness . hence , the current program of measurements aimed at the strange quark contributions to nucleon electromagnetic properties .",
    "the pves strange quark program offers one advantage over other flavor decomposition studies , namely , the theoretically clean character of interpretation . obtaining the @xmath5 contribution to the nucleon mass requires extrapolation of @xmath2n scattering amplitudes into the unphysical regime using a combination of dispersion relations and chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) .",
    "the value for the @xmath6  relative to @xmath7  has varied somewhat over the years , in part due to the ambiguities associated with this extrapolation .",
    "the situation regarding the strange quark contribution to the nucleon spin , @xmath8 , is even more ambiguous .",
    "the extraction of @xmath8 from polarized dis measurements relies on the assumption of flavor su(3 ) symmetry .",
    "the relevant matrix element is not measured directly in the experiments , and information on neutron @xmath9-decay and hyperon semileptonic decays must be incorporated into the analysis using su(3 ) symmetry . for some time",
    ", people have worried about the uncertainties associated with su(3)-breaking .",
    "recently , my collaborators and i studied these effects in chpt and found them to be potentially serious@xcite .",
    "specifically , one has @xmath10 -\\frac{5\\sqrt{3}}{6 } g_a^8 \\\\ \\nonumber & = & 0.14 - [ 0.12 + 0.25 + 0.10 ] \\ \\ \\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the @xmath11 are the integrals of @xmath12 taken from experiment and @xmath13 is the eighth component of the octet of axial current matrix elements .",
    "a value for the latter can only be obtained from experimentally measured axial current matrix elements by invoking su(3 ) symmetry .",
    "the chiral expansion of this su(3 ) relationship is shown in the square brackets in the second line of eq .",
    "( [ eq : deltas ] ) ( the first term is the experimental value for the sum of @xmath14 integrals ) . the first , second , and third terms represent the @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 contributions , respectively .",
    "it is a manifestly non - converging series . based on the formula , we have no way of estimating the theoretical su(3)-breaking uncertainty in @xmath8 , nor can we really say what the value of @xmath8 is .",
    "the advantage of pves is that the interpretation of the results in terms of strange quarks does not suffer from these kinds of ambiguities .",
    "once we have sufficiently precise measurements of the proton and neutron electromagnetic and weak neutral current form factors , we know the relative contributions of @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20-quarks to the nucleon vector current matrix elements .",
    "the relative importance of the strange quark contribution may be either large or small , but either way , the answer will be clear .",
    "we will know the flavor decomposition of the nucleon vector current matrix elements and are , thus , negligible@xcite . ] .",
    "_ sea quarks and the quark model_. why does the constituent quark model work so well in describing low - energy nucleon properties ? in light of what we know about the presence of sea quarks and gluons in the nucleon , the success of the constituent quark description of the nucleon remains a puzzle .",
    "a variety of solutions have been proposed .",
    "it may be that sea quarks are simply inert `` when viewed over long - distance scales .",
    "a more interesting possibility is that the sea quarks are not inert but that their effects are hidden in the effective parameters of the quark model , such as the constituent quark mass and the string tension '' of the @xmath21 potential",
    ". it may also be that nature is more devious than either of these other possibilities suggest and has conspired to conceal the effects of sea quark dynamics through a series of cancellations .",
    "the latter view seems to emerge from dispserion relation analyses of isoscalar electromagnetic and strange quark form factors , as i discuss below . in any case",
    ", the beauty of the pves measurements is that they probe the @xmath5 sea over distance scales relevant to the quark model description .",
    "if either the effective quark model parameters or nature itself has hidden sea quark effects , the measurements will lift the veil of secrecy and allow us to see what the sea is up to at low - energies .",
    "_ z - graphs vs. loops_. how do we relate the quark model description of the nucleon with one built out of hadronic degrees of freedom ?",
    "in the latter framework , for example , the low - momentum , isovector electromagnetic properties of the nucleon involve a combination of the pion cloud and @xmath22-meson resonance . at the most naive level , one may think of the @xmath22-meson resonance as a z - graph \" effect and the pion cloud as involving disconnected quark loops ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) . in the @xmath23-channel ,",
    "the @xmath24 coupling involves @xmath25 pair creation , and in order to connect to a nucleon , it must also involve the negative frequency part of the constituent quark propagator ( the z - graph ) . in the same channel ,",
    "the pion cloud contains a @xmath26 intermediate state . at the quark level ,",
    "the non - resonant part of this contribution involves the presence of two @xmath27 pairs . with only three constituent quarks in the nucleon",
    ", this effect looks like a disconnected quark loop  a sea quark effect . on the other hand , in the non - relativistic quark model ( nrqm ) , neither z - graphs or loops are present , and yet one can still reproduce the low - momentum isovector properties of the nucleon . how can this be ?    the strange quark contributions to the vector current form factors necessarily involve disconnected quark loops , since there are no valence strange quarks in the constituent quark model nucleon wavefunction . in a hadronic langauge , these loops look , for example , like @xmath28 pairs .",
    "dispersion relations also suggest that this kaon cloud is actually dominated by the @xmath29 resonance  a z - graph effect that would imply more sizeable strangeness form factors than one gets from loops only .",
    "if this picture is confirmed by experiment , then it will force us to think more carefully about how to relate the quark and hadronic descriptions of the nucleon .",
    "_ perturbation theory may not apply_. the mass of the strange quark forces us into a theoretical no man s land where we can not easily apply our usual perturbative techniques for making predictions .",
    "the strange quark is not heavy enough to use heavy quark effective theory ; since @xmath30 , we have no small expansion parameter as we do for heavier quarks . at the same time , the strange quark may not be light enoughto make su(3 ) chiral perturbation theory applicable ; @xmath31  not a particularly small expansion parameter either .",
    "thus , from the theoretical side , the study of strange quarks presents a particularly challenging situation .",
    "_ symmetry is impotent_. because the strange quark vector current contains a component that is a flavor su(3 ) singlet , we can not use su(3 ) symmetry to relate the strangeness form factors to any other presently measured quantities .",
    "specifically@xcite @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the baryon number , or su(3 ) singlet current , and @xmath34 is the isoscalar electromagnetic ( em ) current .",
    "we know quite a bit about the latter , but the pves measurements will , in fact , give us our first information on the form factors associated with @xmath33 .",
    "this means that , even if the su(3 ) chiral expansion were well - behaved , there would appear counterterms or low - energy constants ( lec s ) that we can not obtain from other experiments .",
    "consequently , we can not in general use chpt to predict @xmath35 and @xmath36 , the strangeness electric and magnetic form factors , respectively .",
    "clearly , the study of these form factors will lead to new insights into nucleon structure , and pves provides us with a theoretically clean probe of this physics .",
    "the theoretical challenge is to translate the results of pves measurements into a clear understanding of sea quark dynamics at distance scales for which traditional methods of treating nucleon structure run into trouble .      generally speaking ,",
    "theorists have taken one of three approaches to the study of @xmath35 and @xmath36 : hadron models , dispersion relations , and lattice qcd .",
    "of these , the latter two represent first principles methods at the hadronic and microscopic levels , respectively .",
    "models have their place , but they necessarily involve assumptions and approximations that are not always clearly identified or controlled . for this reason , we have witnessed a substantial number of model predictions for @xmath35 and @xmath36 and a correspondingly wide range of values . should experiment agree with any subset of these calculations , it will be hard to gauge the significance of this agreement .",
    "for this reason , my bias favors the first principles treatments , even if they can not yet be implemented in a completely successful way .",
    "although  as i emphasized above  chpt can not provide predictions for @xmath35 and @xmath36 , it nevertheless provides a convenient framework in which to discuss the physics coming out of other non - perturbative methods . for concreteness ,",
    "i will focus on @xmath36 at small @xmath37 . in this kinematic domain",
    ", one has an expansion @xmath38 the strangeness magnetic moment @xmath39 is given by@xcite @xmath40 where @xmath41 is an _ a priori _ unknown low - energy constant that governs the lowest order [ @xmath16 ] contribution and the @xmath43 denote higher order contributions arising from loops and subleading operators . as noted earlier , one can not use existing measurements to predict @xmath39 because @xmath41 contains an su(3 ) singlet component .",
    "in contrast , the lowest order [ @xmath17 ] contribution to the magnetic radius arises entirely from chiral loops@xcite : @xmath45 where @xmath46 and @xmath47 are the usual su(3 ) reduced matrix elements and the @xmath43 denote higher order contributions .",
    "since @xmath46 and @xmath47 are known from other experiments , to @xmath48 we have a parameter - free prediction for the strange magnetic radius .",
    "this result has been used to extrapolate the sample determination of @xmath36 at @xmath49 ( gev@xmath50 to the photon point in order to obtain results for @xmath39@xcite .    given the size of the expansion parameter @xmath51 , however , one might worry about the possible importance of higher - order contributions . to that end ,",
    "the @xmath52 contributions to @xmath53 were recently computed in ref .",
    "the loop effects arising at this order nearly cancel those appearing at @xmath17 , and one also encounters a new lec .",
    "the resulting expression is @xmath54 \\ \\ { \\rm fm}^2\\ \\ \\ , \\ ] ] where the first term in the square brackets gives the loop contribution and @xmath55 is the @xmath52 magnetic radius lec . on general grounds , one would expect the magnitude of @xmath55 to be of order unity with undetermined sign . in principle , then , its contribution could be an order of magnitude more important than the loop contribution . until we are able to determine its value ,",
    "we really do not know the either the magnitude or the sign of the slope of @xmath36 at the origin . as a result ,",
    "the determination of @xmath36 at a single kinematic point is not sufficient to determine @xmath39 .",
    "this new development has a couple of implications .",
    "first , in order to learn how much the strange quarks contribution to the nucleon magnetic moment , we will require an experimental determination of the @xmath37-dependence of @xmath36 at low-@xmath37 .",
    "accomplishing this determination will require completion of the the backward angle , low-@xmath37 program as envisioned for the g0 experiment .",
    "second , it means that understanding the non - perturbative dynamics of the strange sea  as parameterized by @xmath41 and @xmath55  will be key to achieving a theoretical understanding of the strange magnetism .",
    "the strangeness electric form factor has a similar chiral expansion .",
    "since the nucleon has no net strangeness , the leading @xmath37-dependence is governed by the strangeness electric radius , @xmath56 . in chpt , this term arises at @xmath17 , and both loops and an electric radius lec ",
    "@xmath57  appear at this order@xcite : @xmath58\\ \\ { \\rm fm}^2\\ \\ \\   .\\ ] ] as in the case of the strangeness magnetic moment and radius , we require input from non - perturbative methods in order to obtain predictions for @xmath56 .    _",
    "lattice qcd_. in principle , lattice qcd computations provide a means of obtaining values for the constants @xmath41 , @xmath55 , and @xmath57 .",
    "the two most recent lattice computations provide conflicting results for these constants .",
    "both computations were carried out in the quenched approximation , so that @xmath5 pairs appear only via the operator insertion . even under this quenched approximation ,",
    "computation of such disconnected loop `` contributions is difficult .",
    "for connected insertions , wherein the operator is inserted on a line originating from the hadronic source , one must compute quark propagators from a fixed point in spacetime to all possible points on the lattice .",
    "in contrast , disconnected insertions require computation of quark propagators from all points on the lattice to all other points on the lattice . carrying out such",
    "a computation is inordinately expensive . to get around this barrier ,",
    "one employs noise '' methods , in which one computes quark propagators from a random selection of initial points to a random set of final spacetime points@xcite . for a sufficiently large number of noise vectors , operator matrix elements computed using these quark propagators will approach the value one would obtain by computing propagators @xmath59 for all @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "the two recent lattice computations adopted different philosophies for treating the noise method .",
    "the kentucky - adelaide group employed a relatively small number of gauge field configurations but a large number of noise vectors@xcite .",
    "they obtained statistically signficant signals for @xmath35 and @xmath36 at a variety of @xmath37 values , and from these results , one may infer values for the strangeness lec s .",

    "@xcite used on the order of 1000 gauge field configurations but a relatively small number of noises . in this calculation , no significant signal was observed for the strangeness vector current matrix elements , but a non - zero value for the scalar density @xmath62 was obtained .",
    "resolution of this disagreement will require signficant future work , and the two groups are pursuing new , refined calculations of the strangeness form factors .",
    "until a consensus emerges , it is difficult to draw any strong conclusions from lattice computations . for purposes of illustration , however , i will use the results from ref .",
    "@xcite below .    achieving firm lattice qcd predictions for @xmath63 will ultimately require resolution of a number of issues .",
    "clearly , one would like to have in hand an unquenched calculation .",
    "in addition , one would like to use sufficiently small values for the light quark masses that one can extrapolate to the physical values using chpt . in this respect ,",
    "use of chiral fermions  either domain wall or overlap  is likely to be critical .",
    "recent work by the kentucky group suggests that one must use very light quarks in order for the chiral extrapolation to be accurate , and in this respect , overlap fermions may provide some advantage@xcite .",
    "_ dispersion relations_. athough the use of dispersion relations is not a microscopic method , it nevertheless provides a first principles approach to computing form factors in a hadronic basis .",
    "the inputs required include the analyticity properties of form factors , causality , unitarity , and experimental scattering amplitudes .",
    "to be concrete , the dispersion relation for the strangeness magnetic and electric radii is @xmath64 the spectral function @xmath65 can be related to experimental scattering amplitudes by drawing upon some basic ideas in field theory .",

    "although pions themselves have no valence strange quarks , three pions can resonate into an @xmath71 and , by virtue of @xmath71-@xmath29 mixing , can give non - zero contributions to the strangeness vector current matrix elements .",
    "we have no indication that the @xmath72 and @xmath73 states resonate into an @xmath74 vector meson , so they are usually omitted from the analysis .    in order of mass , the next state  and",
    "the most intuitive contributor  is the @xmath75 state .",
    "the chpt expressions for loop contributions to @xmath39 and @xmath76 are derived by computing the @xmath75 contribution at one - loop order . however , the work of ref .",
    "@xcite implies that the one - loop approximation is physically unrealistic . in order to satisfy the requirement of s - matrix unitarity",
    ", one must sum up kaon rescattering corrections to _ all orders_. after doing so , one finds that the kaon cloud contribution to the spectral functions is dominated by the @xmath77 resonance .",
    "moreover , the presence of this resonance signficantly enhances the kaon cloud contribution to the form factors .",
    "an interesting picture of form factor dynamics then emerges . to illustrate ,",
    "consider the isoscalar and strangeness magnetic moments . in the case of @xmath78 ,",
    "the @xmath70 and @xmath75 contributes have nearly equal magnitude but opposite sign , and the resulting cancellation leads to the very small value for the isoscalar moment . for @xmath39 , in contrast",
    ", the @xmath70 contribution gets suppressed by the @xmath71-@xmath29 mixing angle ( @xmath79 ) , while the kaon cloud contribution gets enhanced roughly by the inverse of the strange quark s electric charge , or @xmath80 .",
    "the resulting value for @xmath39 is roughly @xmath81  sizeable enough to be seen by experiment . in short , nature conspires to hide the effects of resonating @xmath5 pairs in @xmath78 through a cancellation against resonating light quark pairs .",
    "far from being inert , the @xmath5 sea is quite active , though hidden from view in purely electromagnetic ( em ) processes .",
    "measuring the strangeness form factors directly should allow one to uncover the conspiracy .",
    "there is one possible loop hole in this picture .",
    "so far , we have only been able to include states up through the @xmath75 state in a rigorous way .",
    "the limitation is the absence of strong interaction scattering data involving higher - mass states .",
    "if the isovector em form factors are any guide , then the low - mass states ought to suffice to describe the leading strangeness moments . indeed , the non - resonant @xmath26 continuum and @xmath22-meson resonance give nearly all of the low-@xmath37 behavior of the isovector form factors .",
    "for the strangeness form factors , however , there is no guarantee that inclusion of the low - mass region is enough .",
    "considerations of the large @xmath37-behavior of these form factors along with simple quark counting arguments suggests that higher - mass states ( _ e.g. _ , @xmath82 , _ etc_. ) may be required .",
    "unfortunately , our ability to carry out a dispersion theory treatment of the higher - mass region is presently limited by the dearth of data .    on the other hand",
    ", one could ultimately intepret the results of the @xmath35 and @xmath36 measurements in terms of the relative importance of this higher - mass region .",
    "if , for example , the value of @xmath39 differs substantially from @xmath81 as suggested by the sample results , then there would have to be important higher - mass effects in order to overcome the fairly sizeable low - mass contribution .",
    "moreover , these higher - mass effects would have to be relatively strong for the strangeness current but relatively small for the isoscalar em current .",
    "such a situation would suggest that nature is an even more devious conspirator than we might otherwise think .",
    "_ hadronic models_. while i can not review the full breadth of hadron model predictions for @xmath83 , a few comments are warranted . from the standpoint of the dispersion theory treatment described above , many hadronic models are based on the idea of kaon cloud dominance .",
    "intuitively , this idea is appealing .",
    "it says the strange sea gets polarized because the nucleon fluctuates into a kaon - hyperon pair .",
    "many calculations  including some i carried out in the past  relied on one - loop computations to estimate this effect . the dispersion relation analysis",

    "inclusion of rescattering effects , encoded by the lec s @xmath41 , @xmath55 , _ etc .",

    "finally , one may encounter cancellations between various contributions . in this respect ,",
    "the quark model calculation of geiger and isgur is suggestive@xcite . in that work ,",
    "a sum over a tower of two hadron intermediate states was considered , with the quark model providing the relevant couplings .",
    "as one proceeds up the tower , strong cancellations occur between various contributions , leading to small strangeness form factors in the end . by necessity ,",
    "however , the calculation was carried out to one - loop level only .",
    "whether this pattern of cancellations would persist after rescattering and resonance effects were included is hard to guess .    _",

    "even the signs of the two calculations of @xmath76 differ . clearly , there is room for improvement in the theory . on the experimental side ,",

    "a new idea for a future measurement of pv pion photoproduction on the @xmath85 resonance has emerged recently  a measurement which may shed new light on an old problem in hadronic weak interactions .",
    "it is now well known that the importance of electroweak radiative corrections to the axial vector form factor are enhanced relative to the naively expected @xmath86 scale .",
    "this enhancement occurs because ( a ) the tree - level coupling is suppressed by the small vector coupling of the electron to the @xmath87 , @xmath88 , and ( b ) the corrections themselves contain large logarithms .",
    "these logarithms only appear in amplitudes involving @xmath89-exchange  so they do not affect neutrino probes of the axial vector hadronic current .",
    "the large @xmath89-exchange contributions can also be affected by parity - violating quark - quark interactions , which induce a parity - violating @xmath90 coupling .",
    "people sometimes refer to this coupling as the nucleon anapole moment coupling .",
    "the anapole moment _ per se _ is not a physical observable , since its value depends on the choice of electroweak gauge parameter , @xmath91 .",
    "moreover , anapole moment effects can never be distinguished from other electroweak radiative corrections in any experiment .",

    "however , the elastic @xmath93 asymmetry itself receives hadronic contributions in the guise of nucleon form factors .",

    "susy remains one of the most strongly - motivated extensions of the standard model for a number of reasons : it gives a solution to the hierarchy problem `` in particle physics ( essentially , the question as to why the electroweak scale is stable ) ; it generates unification of the electroweak and strong couplings close to the planck scale ; it gives a natural candidate for cold dark matter ( the neutralino , @xmath201 ) ; and it contains new sources of cp violation that could help us account for the observed predominance of matter over anti - matter ( the baryon asymmetry of the universe ) .",
    "of course , since no one has yet seen any of the superpartners '' of sm particles , they must be heavier than the particles in the sm .",

    "one might also ask about observing their effects indirectly . for example , superpartners can contribute to precision electroweak observables through radiative corrections",

    "consequently , the magnitude of susy loop effects , _ relative _ to the sm prediction , is generically of order @xmath106 .",
    "however , since @xmath167 are suppressed in the sm , one actually needs a precision of order a few percent  rather than a few tenths of a percent  to be sensitive to susy radiative corrections .",

    "there are some phenomenological constraints .",
    "the absence of proton decay highly constrains the possibility of b - violating interactions .",
    "however , the constraints on l - violating sources of r - parity violation ( rpv ) are much less severe .",
    "the existence of any such interactions would , however , sound the death knell for susy dark matter , since the lightest superpartner ( presumably the @xmath201 ) would no longer be stable .",
    "thus , one would like to know from experiment whether or not the mssm respects r parity .    to that end , a comparison of @xmath165 and @xmath166 measurements could be quite interesting . in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , i show the possible deviations of these quantities from the sm values due to rpv effects . the interior of the truncated ellipse is the region allowed by other precision measurements at 95% confidence .",
    "note that for most of this region , the relative sign of the deviation in @xmath165 and @xmath166 is negative  in contrast to the situation for susy loops .",
    "in fact , there is nearly no overlap between the regions in this plane associated with the different effects .",
    "thus , a comparison of these two measurements could , in principle , serve as a diagnostic \" for susy with our without r parity .    in fact",
    ", the diagnostic potential of these two experiments is even greater if one considers other models of new physics .",
    "for example , e@xmath227 grand unified theories allow for the possibility of a relatively low mass , extra neutral gauge boson models are actually a very broad class of models , though they do not encompass all possibilities for a low - mass \" @xmath228 . ] . in these models ,",
    "the effect of a @xmath228 on @xmath165 and @xmath165 would also be correlated ( having the same relative sign ) .",
    "however , a sizeable shift in these weak charges would also imply a sizeable deviation of the cesium weak charge from the sm prediction .",
    "since @xmath163 currently agrees with the sm , this scenario appears to be disfavored . in contrast , the effects of susy loops on @xmath162 is tiny  below the current experimental plus theoretical error  due to cancellations between up- and down - quark contributions .",
    "thus , one could still have sizeable loop - induced shifts in @xmath167 without being inconsistent with cesium atomic pv .",
    "similarly , the allowed rpv region shown in fig . [ fig4 ] already incorporates the constraints from the @xmath163 determination .",
    "i am convinced that pves will remain a highly interesting field for some time to come .",
    "in addition to providing a definitive answer to the question about strangeness , pves has also opened up possibilities for studying other aspects of hadronic and nuclear structure .",
    "these studies rely on our present understanding of the weak neutral current interaction in order to probe novel aspects of low - energy qcd . at the same time",
    ", the success of this program has opened the way for new experiments to study the weak interaction itself .",
    "looking further into the future , one might anticipate new pv deep inelastic scattering experiments after the cebaf upgrade that may offer new glimpses of higher - twist physics , or even a more precise measurement of the m \" oller asymmetry . suffice it to say , however , that completion of the current program of pves measurements is essential to the long - term success of the field .",
