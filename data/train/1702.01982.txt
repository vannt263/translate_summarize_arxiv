    "reinforced random walks have been studied extensively since the introduction of the ( linearly)-reinforced random walk of coppersmith and diaconis @xcite . in this paper",
    "we study once - reinforced random walk , which was introduced by davis @xcite as a possible simpler model of reinforcement to understand .",
    "while there have been recent major advances in the understanding of linearly reinforced walks on @xmath0 ( see e.g.  @xcite and the references therein ) , rather less is known about once - reinforced walks on @xmath0 .    in this paper",
    "we consider a class of random walks ( on trees ) characterised by two parameters @xmath1 .",
    "the relative probability of stepping to a given previously unvisited child compared to the probability of stepping to one s parent is @xmath2 , while the relative probability of stepping to a given previously visited child as compared to the parent is @xmath3 .",
    "this class of walks includes once - reinforcement of biased random walks on galton - watson trees @xmath4 . the underlying walk ( when the reinforcement parameter is set to 0 )",
    "can be described as follows : when the walker is at @xmath5 , each of the @xmath6 children of @xmath7 receive weight @xmath8 , while the parent of @xmath7 receives weight 1 .",
    "the walker chooses to step to a neighbouring vertex ( i.e.  one of its children , or its parent if it has one ) with probability proportional to the weights .",
    "this walker has a drift ( or bias ) away from the origin on this step provided that @xmath9 .",
    "the once - reinforced biased random walk on @xmath4 is a perturbation of this walk where vertices , or equivalently edges , that have been visited before have their weights increased .",
    "consider a rooted tree @xmath10 ( where @xmath11 is the set of vertices and @xmath12 is the set of edges ) , augmented by adding a parent @xmath13 to the root @xmath14 , the two being connected by an edge .",
    "if two vertices @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the endpoints of the same edge , they are said to be neighbours , and this property is denoted by @xmath17 .",
    "the distance @xmath18 between any pair of vertices @xmath19 , not necessarily adjacent , is the number of edges in the unique self - avoiding path connecting @xmath15 to  @xmath16 .",
    "we set @xmath20 . for any other vertex @xmath15 , we let  @xmath21 be the distance from  @xmath15 to the root  @xmath14 .",

    "multiplicative reinforcement has the property that",
    "if all neighbours of @xmath63 have been visited by the walk , then the step probability from @xmath15 is that of an unreinforced random walk ( i.e.  the reinforcement vanishes at such locations ) .",
    "additive reinforcement is the situation that gives the natural criterion for transience versus recurrence on regular trees ( based on the sign of @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is the number of children of each vertex ) .",

    "we use the notation @xmath68 to denote the averaged law of a mad walk on a random tree @xmath4 with law @xmath66 , defined by @xmath69    our first main result is the following theorem which reveals a non - trivial ( in the case of multiplicative reinforcement ) phase transition for recurrence / transience .",

    "a phase transition is shown for the ( non - biased ) once - reinforced random walk on @xmath0-like trees , which are inhomogeneous trees with polynomial growth .",
    "it should be noted that , in both @xcite and the conjecture of sidoravicius , although the underlying walk is transient , it always has zero - speed .",
    "here , we provide examples where the underlying walk has positive speed , but its once - reinforced counterpart is recurrent .    in order to state the result , let @xmath71 denote the event that @xmath4 survives forever . clearly on @xmath72",
    "the walker is recurrent under the so - called _ quenched _ measure @xmath73 .",
    "therefore our main results are stated for the supercritical setting @xmath74 , whence @xmath75 .",
    "for positivity of the speed we assume that every individual has at least one child , i.e. @xmath76 this is equivalent to saying that we restrict ourselves to the subclass of ( rooted ) trees with no leaves ( apart from @xmath29 ) . + here",

    "one might be surprised to see the phase transition at @xmath91 rather than at @xmath92 in the multiplicative reinforcement regime , but that surprise dissipates somewhat after considering the following heuristic , in which we assume that @xmath93 and @xmath4 is a regular tree :    note that wherever the walker is at @xmath42 , the edge to its parent @xmath94 is always reinforced so it has weight @xmath95 .",

    "now , @xmath104 when @xmath74 and @xmath93 , so corollary [ cor : add ] of the theorem affirms that non - extreme environments are encountered _ often enough _ in the setting of additive reinforcement too .",

    "+ as @xmath575 and @xmath576 reach a new maximum at time @xmath596 , never go back below @xmath757 and @xmath758 , and because the steps of these walks depend only on the local environment , it is clear that the item @xmath746 of lemma [ lem : super0 ] holds as well .",

    ", the three walks keep on jumping forward until time @xmath588 .",
    "this implies that no negative discrepancy can be created on @xmath766 , proving the first part of the statement . +",
    "as for note that @xmath768    consider the event on which the increments of @xmath578 are ( in order ) @xmath769 , with @xmath770 , and that the second step of @xmath576 is towards the root while the second step of @xmath575 is away from the root .",

    "hence , @xmath772 and a simple computation gives @xmath773 as required .",

    "hence , on @xmath779 , we almost surely have that @xmath780 . using lemma [ majtau ]",
    "this implies that @xmath781 , almost surely on @xmath779 . therefore @xmath782 where we have used the fact that on @xmath783 we must have @xmath784 and @xmath785 .",

    "@xmath797 only and that @xmath798 as soon as @xmath278 is small enough",
    ". therefore , @xmath170 takes a step back on @xmath795 , but takes a step forward on @xmath796 .",
    "using in we obtain @xmath799 written in terms of the variables @xmath800 , and using independence and the fact that @xmath801 , the first term in the right hand - side of is equal to @xmath802 using the inequality @xmath803 , which holds for any @xmath804 , see @xcite , for @xmath805 we have @xmath806 together with the fact that @xmath807 , we have that is at most @xmath808 now @xmath809 , so this is at most @xmath810 similarly , we have that @xmath811 where we used the definition of @xmath658 . together with and this provides the conclusion .      using lemma [ mind1 ] , lemma [ majdk ] and the fact that @xmath812 for any @xmath813 , a straightforward computation yields @xmath814 one can check that the function defined by @xmath815 has positive derivative and that @xmath816 . recalling that @xmath774 , this implies the conclusion , by lemma [ almadelta ] .",
    "one can improve the threshold for which we prove monotonicity .",
    "first , when @xmath170 steps back only once and the walks decouple , then they create a discrepancy of @xmath645 , as they have to decouple while having no reinforced children .",
    "in other words , the discrepancy created as lemma [ mind1 ] is in fact @xmath817 .",
    "next , note that no negative discrepancy can be created when the walk @xmath170 takes only two steps back before time @xmath588 . indeed , the only possibilities on @xmath818 are that :    * the walks decouple at the first step back of @xmath170 and thus @xmath819",
    ". therefore , as @xmath170 will take only one more step back @xmath820 .",
    "* the walks do not decouple at the first step back of @xmath170 , hence they both step back and have a reinforced child . if @xmath170 steps back again right after , then , if the walks decouple at this time then @xmath821 , and in any case they only step forward up to time @xmath588 , therefore @xmath822 .",
    "if @xmath170 does not step back right away , then , when it does , @xmath575 and @xmath576 will have no reinforced child , hence @xmath823 .",
    "* if the walks decouple strictly after the second back step of @xmath170 , then @xmath824 .",
    "a consequence of this is that the item @xmath746 in lemma [ almadelta ] can be replaced by @xmath825 in turn , mimicking the proof in section [ sec : end ] , this implies that we are looking for the greatest @xmath826 such that @xmath827 if @xmath828 , then @xmath829 .",
    "this implies that monotonicity occurs for some non - empty interval of reinforcement parameter , as soon as @xmath114 .      for the additive case",
    ", we can follow exactly the same blueprint as in the multiplicative case .",
    "the biggest difference is the way to define the coupling , which is a little bit more cumbersome .",
    "indeed , the transition probabilities of @xmath575 and @xmath576 on a given vertex do not behave monotonically .",
    "more precisely , here is what happens :    * as long as the walks have the same local environment , @xmath576 is always more likely to walk on its trace compared to @xmath575 ; * if @xmath100 and if , at a given time , @xmath575 and @xmath576 are still coupled and the number of reinforced children is greater than @xmath650 , then @xmath575 is more likely to step back compared to @xmath576 ; * @xmath576 is more likely to walk on a reinforced child than @xmath575 , except if @xmath569 and if all children are reinforced ( recall that in the additive case , we do not recover the initial law once all the children are reinforced ) .",
    "the walk @xmath193 would remain the same , just as in , taking a step back with probability @xmath830 .",
    "we can then define a coupling of @xmath170 , @xmath575 and @xmath576 in the additive case such that :    * whenever @xmath170 steps forward , then @xmath575 and @xmath576 both step forward .",
    "hence , if @xmath575 or @xmath576 steps back then @xmath578 steps back . * the probability that @xmath575 and @xmath576 decouple is proportional to @xmath278 .",
    "* whenever @xmath575 walks on its trace , @xmath576 walks on its trace . *",
    "@xmath761 .",
    "it is legitimate to try to obtain a monotonicity result on galton - watson trees without leaves .",
    "again , the only fact that we need in order to apply the method is a nice way to couple two once - reinforced random walks @xmath575 and @xmath576 to the same highly biased random walk on @xmath106 .",
    "one way to do this is to apply the same procedure as in @xcite : we couple the walks @xmath575 and @xmath576 in a similar manner as previously described , except that we define them on two different galton - watson trees that we sample sequentially as the walks explore them .",
    "let @xmath831 be an i.i.d .",
    "sequence of offspring random variables .",
    "if @xmath575 or @xmath576 discovers a new site at time @xmath41 , then this site is given @xmath391 children ( note that @xmath575 and @xmath576 do not live on the same tree ) .",
    "hence , every time the walks discover a new site at the same time , they are given the same offspring .",
    "as previously , the two walks are jointly coupled to a one - dimensional biased random walk jumping to the right with probability @xmath832 , where @xmath833 is the minimal degree of the tree .",
    "+ such a coupling would allow us to conclude monotonicity in a non - empty interval for @xmath107 as soon as @xmath650 is large enough .",
