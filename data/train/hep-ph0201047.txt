    "deep inelastic lepton nucleon scattering ( dis ) experiments have played a key role in the understanding of hadronic matter . they have revealed the structure of hadrons being made out of constituents and the interaction between the latter .    in fixed target dis experiments scaling violations",
    "have been observed , i.e. the variation at fixed values of bjorken-@xmath1 of the structure functions with @xmath2 , the squared four - momentum transfer between lepton and nucleon .",
    "these scaling violations are well described by perturbative quantum chromodynamics ( pqcd ) .",
    "the @xmath2 evolution of the proton structure function @xmath3 is related to the gluon momentum distribution in the proton , @xmath4 , and the strong interaction coupling constant , @xmath5 .",
    "both , @xmath5 and @xmath4 , can be determined with precision @xmath6 dis cross section data .",
    "hera offers the possibility to study the structure of the proton over a wide kinematic range of @xmath1 and @xmath2 , several orders of magnitude larger than in the earlier fixed target experiments . already",
    "first measurements of @xmath7 at hera , for @xmath8 and @xmath9 20 gev@xmath10 , revealed a steep rise of @xmath3 towards low @xmath1 for fixed @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "later measurements of @xmath7 by h1@xcite and zeus@xcite in a wide kinematic range , for @xmath2 values from @xmath11 to 30000 gev@xmath10 and for @xmath12 , have confirmed this trend .",
    "the strong scaling violations observed at low @xmath1 are attributed to the high gluon density in the proton .",
    "the validity of the dglap evolution equation @xcite , which neglects higher - order terms @xcite proportional to @xmath13 , is questionable in the low @xmath1 range and therefore has to be tested against the data . at sufficiently low @xmath1 , non - linear gluon interaction effects",
    "have been considered in order to damp the rise of the cross section in accordance with unitarity requirements @xcite .",
    "the measurement of the longitudinal structure function @xmath14 is of great theoretical importance , since it may allow distinguishing between different models describing the qcd evolution at low @xmath1 .",
    "in fact , the structure function measurements at hera remain incomplete until the longitudinal structure function @xmath15 is actually measured .",
    "the direct , classical @xmath15 measurement by substantial variation of the beam energies@xcite is yet to come at hera .",
    "however , while waiting for this to happen in the hera ii period , the h1 collaboration have extracted experimental results on @xmath15 by measuring the cross section in a kinematic region where the @xmath15 contribution is substantial ( the high @xmath16 region , see below ) and comparing these measurements with the extrapolation of the @xmath7 measurements .",
    "these results are described in this report .",
    "the cross section of the inclusive electron - proton dis neutral current process ( figure  1 ) , @xmath17 , depends on the three independent variables @xmath1 and @xmath2 and @xmath18 , the center of mass energy squared .",
    "@xmath2 and @xmath1 are defined in terms of the four momenta of the incident and the scattered electron , @xmath19 and @xmath20 , and of the incident proton , @xmath21 as @xmath22 another important variable is the inelasticity @xmath23 which is related to @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath18 by @xmath24 .    in the one - photon exchange approximation ( @xmath25 exchange neglected : @xmath26 )",
    "the cross section of the @xmath17 process can be expressed as @xmath27 here @xmath28 denotes the leptonic tensor , describing the interaction between the electron and the virtual photon . in qed the lepton - photon vertex is well defined and therefore @xmath28 can be calculated exactly .",
    "the hadronic tensor @xmath29 corresponds to the photon - proton interaction and is not calculable .",
    "however , using lorenz invariance and current conservation the hadronic tensor can be reduced to only two functions related to the structure of the proton .",
    "the double differential dis cross section can then be written as @xmath30    one can consider the @xmath6 scattering process as the interaction of a flux of virtual photons @xcite with the proton . the dis cross section can then be written as @xmath31 where @xmath32 stands for the flux factor , @xmath33 defines the photon polarization and @xmath34 correspond to the cross sections of the interaction of transverse and longitudinally polarized photons , respectively .",
    "these cross sections are related to the structure functions as @xmath35 the longitudinal structure function @xmath0 is directly proportional to @xmath36 . due to the positivity of the cross sections , the two structure functions @xmath7 and",
    "@xmath15 obey the relation @xmath37    the `` reduced '' cross section is defined as @xmath38 since the contribution of the longitudinal structure function @xmath15 to the cross section can be sizeable only at large values of @xmath16 , in a large kinematic range the relation @xmath39 holds to a very good approximation .    in the quark parton model ( qpm )",
    "@xcite the structure function @xmath7 can be expressed as a sum of the quark - antiquark momentum distributions @xmath40 weighted with the square of the quark electric charges @xmath41 @xmath42 for spin 1/2 partons qpm also predicts @xmath43 , which leads to the so - called callan - gross relation @xcite : @xmath44 .",
    "the naive qpm has to be modified in qcd as quarks interact through gluons , and can radiate gluons . radiated gluons in turn can split into quark - antiquark pairs ( `` sea quarks '' ) or gluons . the gluon radiation results in a transverse momentum component of the quarks .",
    "consequently , quarks can also couple to longitudinally polarized photons and the callan - gross relation is no longer satisfied exactly .",
    "thus , in qcd the longitudinal structure function @xmath15 is non - zero . due to its origin ,",
    "@xmath15 is directly dependent on the gluon distribution in the proton and therefore the measurement of @xmath15 provides a sensitive test of perturbative qcd .",
    "at hera 27.5 gev positrons collided with 820 gev protons . for the last two years",
    "the proton beam energy was increased to 920 gev , and consequently the center of mass energy from 300 to 319 gev .",
    "the kinematic variables @xmath16 ( or @xmath1 ) and @xmath2 can be reconstructed either from the energy and the polar angle of the scattered positron , or from the energy and the polar angle of the hadronic final state , or using a combination of these energies and polar angles .",
    "the overconstrained kinematics allows cross checks , as well as the choice of the method with the best experimental precision for a given kinematic range .    in the `` electron method '' the event kinematics",
    "is reconstructed using the energy @xmath45 and the polar angle @xmath46 of the scattered positron @xmath47 while the electron method is accurate at large values of @xmath16 , corresponding to low energies @xmath45 , the resolution rapidly degrades for @xmath48 where @xmath45 approaches the positron beam energy @xmath49 .",
    "the kinematic variables at low @xmath16 are reconstructed using also information from the hadronic final state .",
    "the inelasticity @xmath16 can also be determined as @xcite @xmath50 where @xmath51 and @xmath52 are energy and longitudinal momentum components of the particle  @xmath53 in the hadronic final state . in the `` @xmath54  method '' @xcite @xmath2 and @xmath16 are reconstructed as @xmath55 the @xmath54  method has good resolution also at low @xmath16 , and is insensitive to the initial state radiation .",
    "the cross section is extracted using a combination of the electron method and the @xmath54  method .",
    "the h1 detector @xcite combines tracking in a solenoidal magnetic field of 1.15 t with nearly hermetic calorimetry to investigate high energy @xmath6 interactions at hera . for polar angles",
    "@xmath56 the scattered positron energy @xmath45 is measured in the backward electromagnetic lead - fibre scintillator calorimeter ( spacal ) @xcite which has an integrated timing function to veto proton beam induced background interactions . here",
    "@xmath57 is defined with respect to the proton beam direction .",
    "identification of the scattered positron is improved and the polar angle measured with a backward drift chamber ( bdc ) , situated in front of the spacal , and with the new backward silicon detector ( bst ) @xcite .",
    "the bst consists of four detector planes , arranged perpendicular to the beam axis and equipped with 16 wedge shaped , double metal silicon strip detectors .",
    "the bst measures the polar angle of the crossing tracks with an internal resolution of about 0.2 mrad for @xmath57 between 172@xmath58 and 177@xmath58 . for polar angle @xmath59",
    "the scatterd positron is measured in the lar calorimeter .",
    "the hadronic final state is reconstructed using the liquid argon ( lar ) calorimeter , tracking detectors and the spacal .",
    "the interaction vertex is determined with the central drift chambers , the jet chamber cjc and two layers of @xmath60 drift chambers , mostly using the hadronic final state particles .",
    "this vertex determination is complemented by the inner proportional chamber cip , for @xmath61 , and by bst , for @xmath62 .",
    "the luminosity is determined with a precision of 1.5% using the small - angle bremsstrahlung process @xmath63 @xcite .",
    "the final state photon and positron , scattered at very low @xmath2 , can be detected in calorimeters ( `` photon and electron taggers '' ) which are situated close to the beam pipe at distances of 103 m and 33 m from the interaction point in the positron beam direction .",
    "the event selection criteria are slightly different in the low @xmath2 and in the high @xmath2 ranges . in the low @xmath2 range the scattered positron is identified in the spacal . in the high @xmath2 range",
    "the positron is seen in the lar calorimeter as that cluster of maximum transverse energy , for which the requirements on the cluster shape are satisfied .",
    "the difference is then mainly in the cluster definition and in the track validation . in the lar cluster - track validation we use cjc tracks for @xmath64 , in the spacal cluster case we use cjc , bdc and bst tracks , where appropriate .",
    "longitudinal momentum conservation in neutral current dis events gives the constraint that @xmath65 , summed over the final state particles , is about equal to @xmath66 . in events with initial state radiation",
    "the radiative photon may carry a significant fraction of the @xmath65 sum .",
    "such events are thus suppressed by requiring @xmath67 35 gev .",
    "distributions of the selected events were compared with simulations of deep inelastic scattering , photoproduction and compton scattering .",
    "the simulated monte carlo events were submitted to the same reconstruction and analysis chain as the real data .",
    "the track detection efficiencies were determined from the data utilizing the redundancy of the central and backward tracking detector system .",
    "agreement at the few per cent level was reached between experiment and simulation for the large set of technical and physics distributions studied .",
    "for the measurement of the longitudinal structure function it is essential to reach the highest possible values of @xmath16 .",
    "this requires the identification of scattered positrons with energies down to only a few gev as well as the efficient rejection of photoproduction background events in which low energy deposits in the spacal can mimic the signature of a deep inelastically scattered positron .",
    "the main part of the background is due to photons from @xmath69 decays . in the low @xmath2 region a sizeable fraction of this background can be removed by requiring a track signal in the bst .",
    "the remaining background is due to photon conversion and showering in the passive material in front of the detectors , possible overlap of @xmath70 decays with charged tracks , and misidentified charged pions .",
    "it is subtracted bin by bin using the phojet @xcite mc simulation .",
    "the photoproduction background can be estimated experimentally using tagged events in which the scattered positron is detected in the electron tagger .    at @xmath2 above 10 gev@xmath10 , for @xmath71 the photoproduction background is subtracted using the phojet simulation . for @xmath16 values",
    "above 0.75 experimental information is used by employing the charge assignment of central tracks associated with spacal energy clusters .",
    "this allows the energy range to be extended down to @xmath723 gev , corresponding to @xmath73 .",
    "the candidates with negative charge are taken to represent the background in the positron data sample .",
    "this statistical subtraction procedure requires the study of any process which may cause a charge asymmetry .",
    "suchs asymmetry is e.g. due to the antiproton interaction cross section exceeding that for proton interactions at low energies @xcite .",
    "annihilation leads to larger energy deposits in spacal than proton interactions which introduces an asymmetry for low energies above a given threshold .",
    "this charge asymmetry can be measured using tagged photoproduction events which fulfill the dis event selection criteria and is taken into account in the measurement of the positron dis cross section at high @xmath16 .    as already stressed above",
    ", the detailed understanding of the data down to 3 gev scattered positron energy is essential for the measurement of the dis cross sections at high @xmath16 , enabling the determination of @xmath0 .",
    "control plots illustrating the cross section measurements at high @xmath16 are shown in figures 2 and 3 .",
    "the cross section is determined by converting the measured number of events , after background subtraction , in bin averaged cross sections using acceptance calculations from the monte carlo sample .",
    "the precision for this measurement is dominated by systematic uncertainties of typically 3% , extending to about 7% at the edges of the covered @xmath16 range .",
    "the measured reduced cross section @xmath74 is shown in figures 4 and 5 for two @xmath75 data samples , taken in 1996/97 and 1999 with 820 gev and 920 gev proton beam energy , respectively .",
    "the cross section rises towards low @xmath1 , turning over at @xmath1 values corresponding to @xmath760.6 .",
    "this behaviour , for @xmath77 3.5 gev@xmath10 , is well described by the nlo qcd fit @xcite to the 820 gev data .",
    "note that this fit used h1 data with a minimum @xmath78 = 3.5 gev@xmath10 .",
    "the extrapolation of the fit to @xmath2 values lower than 2.5 gev@xmath10 falls below the measured data .",
    "the extraction of the longitudinal structure function @xmath0 is based on the reduced cross section ( 8) , which depends on @xmath79 and @xmath14 .",
    "the effect of @xmath0 is enhanced with @xmath80 , and the reduced cross section @xmath74 tends to @xmath81 as @xmath82 . for the extraction of the longitudinal structure function from the inclusive cross section",
    "the data at large @xmath16 are very important .",
    "an important advantage of hera , compared to fixed target dis lepton - nucleon experiments , is the wide range of @xmath16 values covered .",
    "this allows the behaviour of @xmath7 at low @xmath16 to be determined reliably and to be extrapolated into the region of high @xmath16 .",
    "two methods are used by h1 to perform the extraction of the longitudinal structure function :    for @xmath83 10 gev@xmath10 the `` extrapolation method '' , introduced in @xcite , is used .",
    "a nlo dglap qcd fit is used to extrapolate @xmath7 into the high @xmath16 region .",
    "this fit uses only h1 data in the restricted kinematic range @xmath84 and @xmath85 gev@xmath10 . in figure 4",
    "the fit is compared with the measured cross section for @xmath2 bins above 10 gev@xmath10 , accessing the high @xmath16 region .",
    "the difference between the measured @xmath74 and the extrapolated @xmath7 is used to determined @xmath14 .",
    "systematic errors , which are common to the lower @xmath16 and the larger @xmath16 region , are considered in the fit as described in @xcite .    at low @xmath86 10 gev@xmath10 ,",
    "the behaviour of @xmath7 as a function of @xmath87 is used in a new extraction method @xcite .",
    "this so called `` derivative method '' is based on the cross section derivative @xmath88 .",
    "the derivative of the reduced cross section , taken at fixed @xmath2 , is given by @xmath89    for @xmath82 the cross section derivative tends to the limit @xmath90 , neglecting the contribution from the derivative of @xmath0 .",
    "at largest @xmath16 the @xmath0 contribution dominates the derivative of the reduced cross section @xmath74 .",
    "this is in contrast to the influence of @xmath0 on @xmath74 which is dominated by the contribution of @xmath7 for all @xmath16 .",
    "a further advantage of the derivative method is that it can be applied down to very low @xmath91 1 gev@xmath10 where a qcd description of @xmath3 is complicated due to higher order and possible non - perturbative corrections .",
    "the cross section derivatives are shown in figure 6 as function of @xmath16 .",
    "this measurement of @xmath92 was used to determine the longitudinal structure function .",
    "the assumption has been made that the derivative @xmath93 is a linear function of @xmath87 up to large @xmath16 . in each @xmath2",
    "bin straight line fits were made to the derivative data for @xmath94 0.3 .",
    "the line fits describe the data very well and the extrapolation of the straight line was taken to represent the contribution of @xmath7 at high @xmath16 .",
    "the extrapolations were compared with the values obtained from qcd and good agreement was found .",
    "the uncertainties of the straight line extrapolation were included into the systematic errors of the measurement .",
    "the small contribution of @xmath95 to the derivative was corrected for by using nlo qcd and the size of the full correction was added to the overall error of the measured @xmath0 .",
    "the longitudinal structure function @xmath14 determined by the derivative method is shown in figure 7 .",
    "the data extend into the lower @xmath1 range and are consistent with previous h1 results .",
    "the curves represent nlo qcd calculations of @xmath0 based on a fit to the 1996/97 data for @xmath94 0.35 , i.e. in a region where @xmath7 can be measured practically independently of @xmath0 .    in figure 8 the determination of @xmath14 at high @xmath2",
    "is shown for @xmath75 and @xmath96 data sets .",
    "the extrapolation method is used . both data sets",
    "are consistent and in agreement with the qcd fit .",
    "the possible extreme values for @xmath0 ( @xmath97 and @xmath98 ) are shown for comparison .",
    "an overview of all current h1 data on @xmath14 , from @xmath2 = 2.2 gev@xmath10 to 700 gev@xmath10 is given in figure 9 .",
    "the data extend the knowledge of the longitudinal structure function into the region of low @xmath1 , much beyond the region of fixed target lepton - proton scattering experiments .",
    "the increase of @xmath14 towards low @xmath1 is consistent with the nlo qcd calculation , reflecting the rise of the gluon momentum distribution in this region .",
    "the values of @xmath14 are thus severely constrained by the present data , unless there are deviations from the assumed extrapolation of @xmath7 into the region of large @xmath16 corresponding to the smallest @xmath1 .",
    "a measurement of the @xmath1 dependence of @xmath14 , independent of assumptions about the behaviour of @xmath7 , can be performed with a variation of the proton beam energy at hera @xcite .",
    "a nlo qcd fit has also been performed by the zeus collaboration @xcite . within this fit @xmath0",
    "was calculated , and found to be consistent with the h1 @xmath0 data .",
    "several theoretical models were compared to the h1 data .",
    "predictions based on the saturation model @xcite are shown in figure 10 together with the h1 @xmath14 data points . at large @xmath1 and @xmath2 values data",
    "are well described by the model , while at low @xmath1 and low @xmath2 higher twist contributions are clearly needed to describe the @xmath14 distribution .    in figure 11",
    "the h1 data are compared to the donnachie - dosch model @xcite predictions .",
    "this model is based on a dipole picture in which large dipoles couple to a soft pomeron and small dipoles couple to a hard pomeron .",
    "the parameters are fixed by proton - proton scattering data and by the measured proton structure function @xmath3 .",
    "this simple approach is able to describe the @xmath0 data well .",
    "one can see that with increasing @xmath2 the importance of the hard pomeron is increasing , and it is dominating at the high @xmath2 values .",
    "new results on the extraction of the longitudinal structure function @xmath14 are presented for a wide @xmath2 range from 2.2 gev@xmath10 to 700 gev@xmath10 and for much lower @xmath1 values ( @xmath99 ) , compared to the fixed target experiments .",
    "the extraction results are possible due to the improved detectors in the h1 backward region , used for the identification and measurement of the scattered positrons at low @xmath2 and high @xmath16 .",
    "two different methods are used to determine @xmath0 .",
    "the partial derivative of the reduced cross section , @xmath88 , is used to extract @xmath0 at low @xmath86 10 gev@xmath10 . at @xmath83 10",
    "gev@xmath10 the difference between the measured reduced cross section @xmath74 and @xmath7 , calculated from an extrapolation of a nlo qcd fit to low @xmath16 data , is used for the @xmath0 determination .",
    "thus the longitudinal structure function @xmath0 at low @xmath1 is determined more precisely than hitherto and in a larger @xmath2 range .",
    "the observed rise of @xmath14 towards low @xmath1 is consistent with the nlo qcd calculations and reflects the rise of the gluon momentum distributions in this kinematical region .",
    "the data are also well described by calculations based on a colour dipole model and on a combination of the colour dipole with a two pomeron model .",
    "i would like to thank the organizers for the excellent organization and for creating an inspiring conference atmosphere .",
    "the results presented here are due to the common efforts and the success of the hera machine group and of the h1 collaboration and it is a pleasure for me to thank all their members .",
