    "a superluminal propagation has recently been studied in the context of the casimir effect in quantum electrodynamics .",
    "scharnhorst has demonstrated @xcite that , when vacuum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field obey periodic boundary conditions in one spatial dimension ( corresponding to parallel casimir plates ) , then the two - loop corrections to the photon polarization tensor lead to a superluminal propagation of photons . a similarity between the effects of casimir plates and that of finite temperature on the propagation of photons has been discussed @xcite , and more general conditions that lead to a superluminal propagation of photons have also been identified .",
    "a similar effect has been found for photons interacting with fermions @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that the transverse photons coupled to fermions obeying periodic boundary conditions are faster than light when propagating perpendicularly and are slower than light when propagating parallelly to the compactified dimension .",
    "since our fermions obey the usual antiperiodic boundary conditions in the compact temporal dimension , one would expect no superluminal effects .",
    "however , we demonstrate that in a certain region of temperature and chemical potential below the symmetry restoration point , massless pions propagate faster than light .",

    "it is important to check how sensitive the onset of superluminal propagation is to the variation of the parameters of the model . in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] we plot the superluminal onset temperature @xmath119 as a function of the fermion - boson coupling @xmath12 keeping the boson self - coupling @xmath11 fixed .",
    "contrary to what one would naively expect , the superluminal onset shifts to larger temperatures with increasing @xmath12 .",
    "the reason is that in this temperature range the contribution of fermions ( [ eq305 ] ) , relative to that of bosons ( [ eq205 ] ) , decreases with increasing @xmath12 owing to the fermion mass dependence of the distribution function .    .",
    "]        the behavior of the pion velocity near the critical temperature should be analyzed with special care .",
    "it is well known that the phase transition in the su(2)@xmath120su(2 ) linear sigma model at @xmath71 is of second order @xcite and that the one - loop approximation violates this prediction by producing a weak first - order transition @xcite .",
    "calculations of the chiral condensate in the chiral perturbation theory @xcite show the deviation from nonperturbative renormalization group calculations @xcite at temperatures of about @xmath121 . as our results depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( upper left plot ) show that the superluminal pion propagation starts at temperatures of about 50 mev , one would perhaps be inclined to think that the superluminal effect was an artifact of the one - loop approximation . however , as we have already pointed out , the superluminal pion velocity is a consequence of the negative fermion loop contribution .",
    "the proportion of the fermion part to that of the boson depends on the parameters of the model .",
    "for example , a decreasing of @xmath12 with other free parameters fixed , increases the negative fermion contribution given by eq .",
    "( [ eq305 ] ) , which in turn yields a superluminal propagation even at temperatures much below 50 mev ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "hence , we believe that the onset of superluminal propagation coincides only accidentally with the window where perturbation theory starts to deviate from nonperturbative calculations . for a firm judgment whether a superluminal pion propagation is a genuine effect or an artifact of the perturbation expansion one should go beyond the one - loop approximation or apply a nonperturbative technique such as monte carlo calculations on the lattice or the @xmath37 expansion of the o(@xmath122)/o(@xmath38 ) nonlinear sigma model with fermions .",
    "next we discuss the case @xmath70 and @xmath71 with one spatial dimension compactified to the size @xmath73 .",
    "the pion velocity @xmath123 parallel to the compact direction is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] for both periodic and antiperiodic fermions . in the case of antiperiodic fermions",
    ", the compactification size plays the role of inverse temperature and chiral symmetry gets restored at the critical size @xmath124 . in this case , the velocity plot is just the inverse of the first plot in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .    for periodic fermions",
    "we find the minimum of the thermodynamic potential corresponding to a nonzero sigma to be always below the minimum corresponding to @xmath112 .",
    "in this case , the right - hand side of ( [ eq505 ] ) is negative and no restoration of chiral symmetry takes place . owing to the opposite sign of the fermion contribution",
    "the velocity @xmath123 is always superluminal , monotonously approaching the velocity of light as the size of the compactification @xmath125 approaches infinity .    to gain a physical insight into why the pions become superluminal",
    "it is worthwhile making a comparison with the similar effects found for photons propagating in a medium and in a casimir vacuum . in qed at either finite temperature or finite boundaries the genuine change of the speed of massless photons is a two loop effect related to the coherent light - by - light scattering @xcite .",
    "however , a one loop superluminal effect has been found in qed with one space dimension compactified @xcite .",
    "modifications of the vacuum that change the population of real and virtual particles introduce coherent scattering which decreases or increases the speed of massless photons . in a casimir vacuum",
    "some of the virtual modes are eliminated and consequently their would be scattering @xcite . as a result the speed of massless photons is increased . roughly speaking , the negative casimir energy density results in massless photons being superluminal . in our case , a superluminal propagation is , formally , a consequence of the negative fermion one - loop contribution to the @xmath126 coefficient in the inverse pion propagator ( [ eq202 ] ) .",
    "it is conceivable that , for the parameters close to the phase transition point , the specific interaction between the chiral fields and fermions reduces the effective vacuum energy density and as a result the massless pions become superluminal .",
    "we have analyzed the propagation of massless pions at nonzero temperature and nonzero finite baryon density in a sigma model with two quark flavors . by calculating the pion dispersion relation at one - loop order",
    "we have shown that pions in the presence of fermions become superluminal in a certain range of temperatures and baryon chemical potential .",
    "furthermore , we have studied the case when one of the spatial dimensions is compactified with fermions obeying periodic or antiperiodic boundary conditions . restricting attention to @xmath13 ,",
    "we have calculated the pion velocity @xmath123 along the compact direction .",
    "we have found that for antiperiodic fermions , pions will propagate superluminally or subluminally , depending on the size of the compact dimension . with periodic fermions ,",
    "the velocity @xmath123 is always larger than the velocity of light .",
    "a superluminal propagation of massless particles may naively seem to contradict special relativity and lorentz invariance .",
    "the most disturbing consequence of a superluminal propagation would be an apparent violation of causality .",
    "however , it has been convincingly argued that superluminal effects realized in quantum field theories with a nontrivial vacuum do not lead to causal paradoxes @xcite .",
    "the basic argument goes as follows : once the conditions that determine the vacuum fluctuations are fixed , the propagation velocity in a given reference frame is _",
    "unique_. this implies that it is not possible to send signals both forwards and backwards in time within one reference frame .",
    "in other words , the causal loops are forbidden .",
    "it is important to bear in mind that we have considered an idealized situation when there is no explicit chiral symmetry breaking of the original lagrangian ( [ eq100 ] ) and pions are exactly massless in the broken symmetry phase . in reality ,",
    "chiral symmetry is explicitly broken owing to nonvanishing current quark masses . to make the pions massive",
    "we could have , as usual , introduced an explicit chiral symmetry breaking term in the original lagrangian . in that case",
    "the quantity @xmath43 , defined in ( [ eq015 ] ) and calculated in the limit @xmath47 , would no longer have the meaning of the pion velocity . instead , given the dispersion relation @xmath127 , with both @xmath43 and @xmath128 being @xmath8 and @xmath9 dependent",
    ", one would define a group velocity @xmath129 .",
    "it may easily be verified that for @xmath130 the quantity @xmath131 is below one even if @xmath132 .",
    "of course , the situation could change for @xmath133 . that would involve a calculation of @xmath43 at non - zero momenta which is beyond the scope of the present paper .",
