    "three dimensional ( 3d ) toric codes @xcite and color codes @xcite are topological quantum codes defined on 3d lattices . like their 2d counterparts , they are also calderbank - shor - steane ( css ) codes @xcite where the bit flip and phase errors can be corrected independently .",
    "three dimensional topological codes are inherently asymmetrical in their error correcting capabilities for the bit flip errors and the phase flip errors , which is perhaps one of the reasons why they have not received as much attention as their 2d analogues .",
    "however , the growing interest in asymmetric error models @xcite motivates us to study them in closer detail .",
    "another reason for studying 3d codes , specifically the 3d color codes , comes from the fact that in some ways they are also richer than 2d codes .",
    "certain 3d color codes also possess a transversal non - clifford gate @xcite .",
    "this is not possible for 2d codes or 3d toric codes .",
    "while the 3d toric code on a cubic lattice has been studied in @xcite , the general case of an arbitrary lattice has not been investigated as much .",
    "for these codes to be useful for fault tolerant quantum computing it is necessary to develop efficient decoding algorithms .",
    "however , there appears to be no previous work on the decoding of 3d color codes .",
    "while we do not solve this problem in this paper , we make some progress in the decoding of 3d color codes by reducing it to the decoding of the 3d toric codes .",
    "errors corresponding to chains in the lattice can be easily decoded on a 3d toric code .",
    "but efficient decoders are not known for errors corresponding to surfaces except in the case of cubic lattice . in this case a decoder similar to the decoder for the 4d toric code in @xcite can be used .",
    "the central result of our paper is a mapping from 3d color codes to 3d toric codes . by exploiting the topological properties of color codes ,",
    "we establish a mapping between 3d color codes and 3d toric codes .",
    "the work most similar to ours is that of kubica , yoshida , and pastawski @xcite who showed , among other things , that the 3d color code can be mapped to three copies of 3d toric codes .",
    "our results give a different mapping from the color code to the toric codes .",
    "our map also preserves the css nature of the color code .",
    "we project the @xmath1 errors and @xmath2 errors onto different sets of toric codes unlike @xcite which employs just one set of toric codes .",
    "their map also implies that a 3d color code can be decoded via 3d toric codes .",
    "the question of which map is better for decoding is not yet known .",
    "this will be investigated in a later work .",
    "another work related to ours is that of delfosse who showed that 2d color code can be projected onto surface codes @xcite using the machinery of chain complexes derived from hypergraphs .",
    "our results generalize his approach to 3d .",
    "we take a somewhat simpler approach and do not explicitly make use of chain complexes based on hypergraphs . in passing",
    "we mention that similar mappings were known in 2d @xcite .",
    "their approaches can also be generalized to 3d .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : bg ] we give a brief review of 3d toric codes and color codes . in the subsequent section we present the central result of the paper showing how to project a 3d color code onto a collection of 3d toric codes and propose a novel decoding scheme for color codes .",
    "we then conclude with a brief discussion and outlook for further research .",
    "we assume that the reader is familiar with stabilizer codes @xcite .",
    "we briefly review 3d topological codes . a 3d toric code is defined over a cell complex ( denoted @xmath3 ) in 3d .",
    "we assume that qubits are placed on the edges of the complex . for each vertex @xmath4 and face @xmath5 , we define stabilizer generators as follows : @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the set of edges incident on @xmath4 and @xmath8 is the set of edges that constitute the boundary of @xmath5 . when there are periodic boundary conditions , the stabilizer generators @xmath9 and @xmath10 are constrained as follows : @xmath11 where @xmath12 is any 3-cell and @xmath13 is the collection of faces that form the boundary of @xmath12 .",
    "if @xmath3 has boundaries , then the constraints have to be modified accordingly .",
    "additional constraints could be present depending on the cell complex .",
    "sometimes it is useful to define the ( 3d ) toric codes using the dual complex .",
    "we denote the dual of @xmath3 by @xmath14 .",
    "qubits are placed on the faces of the dual complex .",
    "the stabilizer generators for a 3-cell @xmath12 and an edge @xmath15 in the dual complex are defined as @xmath16 where @xmath13 is the boundary of @xmath12 and @xmath17 the boundary of @xmath5 .",
    "phase flip errors on the toric code are detected by the operators @xmath9 .",
    "phase flip errors can be visualized as paths or strings on the lattice",
    ". the nonzero syndromes always occur in pairs .",
    "the bit flip errors on the other hand are detected by the operators @xmath18 .",
    "they are better visualized in the dual complex . since qubits are associated to faces in the dual complex , an @xmath1 error can be viewed as a surface obtained by union of faces ( with errors ) and the ( nonzero ) syndrome as the boundary of the surface . also note that since the boundary of each face is a cycle of trivial homology , the syndrome of @xmath1 errors is a collection of cycles of trivial homology in @xmath14 .",
    "consider a complex with 4-valent vertices and 3-cells that are 4-colorable .",
    "such colored complexes are called 3-colexes , @xcite .",
    "a 3d color code is a topological stabilizer code constructed from a 3-colex .",
    "the stabilizer generators of the color code are given as @xmath19 where @xmath12 is a 3-cell and @xmath5 a face .",
    "it turns out that for each 3-cell @xmath20 we can define a ( dependent ) @xmath2 stabilizer as @xmath21 .",
    "a 3-colex complex defines a stabilizer code with the parameters @xmath22 $ ] where @xmath23 is the first betti number of the complex , @xcite .",
    "we can also define the color code in terms of the dual complex .",
    "now qubits correspond to 3-cells , @xmath1-stabilizer generators to vertices and @xmath2-stabilizer generators to edges of @xmath14 .",
    "@xmath24    we quickly review some relevant colorability properties of 3-colexes .",
    "the edges of such a 3-colex can also be 4-colored : the outgoing edges of every 3-cell can be colored with the same color as the 3-cell .",
    "we can color the faces based on the colors of the 3-cells .",
    "a face is adjacent to exactly two 3-cells .",
    "a face adjacent to @xmath25-cells colored @xmath26 and @xmath27 is colored @xmath28 .",
    "this means that the 3-colex is @xmath29-face - colorable . in view of the colorability of the 3-colex we refer to a @xmath26-colored @xmath25-cell as @xmath26-cell without explicitly mentioning that it is a 3-cell .",
    "likewise we can unambiguously refer to the @xmath28-colored faces as @xmath28-cells or @xmath28-faces , @xmath26-colored edges as @xmath26-edges and @xmath26-colored vertices as @xmath26-vertices .",
    "we denote the @xmath30-dimensional cells of a complex @xmath3 as @xmath31 and the @xmath30-dimensional cells of color @xmath26 as @xmath32 .",
    "in this section we state and prove the central result of the paper , namely , 3d color codes can be projected onto a finite collection of 3d toric codes .",
    "a more precise statement will be given later .",
    "first , we give an intuitive explanation and then proceed to prove it rigorously .",
    "the main intuition behind the projection of color codes onto toric codes is that any such mapping should preserve the error correcting capabilities of the color code and enable decoding . from the point of view of a decoder ,",
    "the information available to it is simply the syndrome information . in a topological code",
    "this syndrome information can be represented by the cell complex .",
    "our main goal is to preserve the syndrome information on the 3-colex while translating it into a different cell complex .    in a 3-colex ,",
    "qubits reside on the vertices while the checks correspond to faces and volumes .",
    "if we look at the dual complex , the qubits correspond to 3-cells which are tetrahedrons ; the @xmath1-type checks to vertices and the @xmath2-type checks to edges . due to this correspondence",
    "we often refer to the boundary of a qubit or a collection of qubits wherein we mean the boundary of the 3-cells which correspond to those qubits in the dual complex .",
    "we address the bit flip and phase flip errors separately .",
    "suppose that an @xmath1 error occurs .",
    "since the qubits correspond to volumes , error correction is equivalent to ( i ) identifying the boundary which _ encloses _ the qubits in error and ( ii ) specifying whether the erroneous qubits lie inside or outside the boundary .",
    "the second step is necessary because the qubits with errors have the same boundary as the qubits without errors . in case of bit flip errors ,",
    "the syndrome information is present on the edges ; this is clearly not the boundary of a volume .",
    "the question then arises how do we recover the boundary of the erroneous qubits when we appear to be in possession of some partial information about the boundary .    to see how we might solve this problem ,",
    "let us assume that there is just one bit flip error , see fig .",
    "[ fig : single - tetra - x ] for illustration .",
    "this causes all the six edges of the tetrahedron to carry nonzero syndromes .",
    "while these edges are contained in the boundary of the tetrahedron it is not the surface we are looking for .",
    "one way to recover the boundary of the tetrahedron is as follows .",
    "imagine we deleted one vertex of the tetrahedron , then we would also be deleting three of the four faces of the tetrahedron and we would end with just one face .",
    "all the edges of this remaining face carry nonzero syndromes .",
    "these edges are precisely the boundary of that face . similarly deleting other vertices of the tetrahedron ( separately )",
    "we would be able to recover all the faces of the tetrahedron . since the union of these faces constitutes the boundary of the erroneous qubit we are able to recover the boundary of the error . however , error correction is not complete .",
    "both the single qubit in error and the collection of the qubits without error have the same boundary . to complete error correction we also need to choose which of these sets of qubits are in error .",
    "we can decide on the volume which contains fewer number of qubits . in the present case",
    "we would choose the qubit in error completing the error correction .",
    "let us identify the key ideas in the previous procedure :    we construct a collection of complexes obtained by deleting @xmath26-vertices of tetrahedrons .    then in each complex ,",
    "from the edges carrying nonzero syndrome we recover part of the boundary of the erroneous qubits .",
    "then we combine the boundary pieces found in ( ii ) to recover the boundary of the erroneous qubits .",
    "finally we decide whether the interior or the exterior set of qubits enclosed by the boundary are in error .",
    "step ( ii ) is key to making the connection with the 3d toric codes .",
    "this step is identical to the correction of the @xmath1-type errors in 3d toric codes .",
    "a similar idea will lead us to the procedure for decoding the phase flip errors , see fig .",
    "[ fig : single - tetra - z ] . in this case",
    "the syndromes that detect the phase flip errors correspond to the vertices in the dual complex .",
    "suppose now that there is a single phase flip error .",
    "the vertices of the erroneous tetrahedron will carry the syndrome information about the error .",
    "now we seem to have even lesser information about the boundary of the erroneous tetrahedron than before .",
    "however , we can recover the boundary by the following procedure .",
    "delete any pair of vertices of the tetrahedron .",
    "we will be left with one edge and two vertices .",
    "we can first identify the edge as piece of the boundary we are looking for . deleting all the six possible pairs of vertices , we are able to recover the six edges which are in the boundary of the tetrahedron . now the problem is identical to the one we solved for correcting bit flip errors .",
    "we summarize the key steps :    we construct new complexes from the original complex by deleting pairs of vertices of each tetrahedron .",
    "then we recover the edges which are in the boundary of the erroneous qubits .    at this point",
    "the problem is same as the problem of decoding bit flip errors which can be solved using the previous procedure .    in correcting the @xmath2-type errors the connection to the toric codes happens in ( ii )",
    "this is precisely the process used to decode @xmath2-type errors in 3d toric codes .",
    "the procedures we outlined are heuristic and somewhat imprecise ; they need a rigorous justification as to correctness and efficiency .",
    "we also need to consider the cases where the boundary recovery procedure can fail .",
    "we now turn to address these issues in the next section .",
    "to recover the boundary of the tetrahedron . ]      as we saw in the previous section , our approach to decoding color codes leads us to duals and minors of complexes .",
    "so we begin by studying the properties of the 3-colexes and their minors .",
    "first we state some properties of the dual of a 3-colex . since they are immediate from the properties of the 3-colex we omit the proof . for the rest of the paper",
    "we assume that @xmath3 is a 3-colex .",
    "[ lm : face - colorability - dual - colex ] let @xmath3 be a 3-colex .",
    "then the dual complex @xmath14 is 4-vertex - colorable , 6-edge - colorable , 4-face - colorable .",
    "every qubit in the 3-colex is identified with a tetravalent vertex incident on four 3-cells which are 4-colorable .",
    "therefore in the dual complex , every qubit corresponds to a tetrahedron whose vertices are of different colors . similarly",
    "the four faces of each tetrahedron are also of different colors .",
    "( follows from lemma  [ lm : face - colorability - dual - colex ] . )",
    "let us denote the minor complex of @xmath14 , i.e. the complex obtained by deleting all the vertices of color @xmath26 , by @xmath33 .",
    "we denote this operation as @xmath34 so that @xmath35 the resulting structure @xmath36 is a well defined complex .",
    "clearly , its vertices and edges are a subset of the parent complex @xmath14 .",
    "the structure of the faces and 3-cells is not so obvious .",
    "a face in @xmath14 that is incident on a @xmath26-vertex will not survive in @xmath36 .",
    "therefore only the @xmath26-faces of @xmath14 which are not incident on a @xmath26-vertex will be faces of @xmath36 .",
    "the 3-cells of @xmath36 are formed by merging all the tetrahedrons that are incident on a @xmath26-vertex .",
    "we can now extend the action of @xmath34 to the individual cells of @xmath14 , there is some freedom on how to extend as long as we retain the information needed for error correction .",
    "we are primarily interested in extending @xmath34 so that it captures the information about ( i ) the qubits , ( ii ) the errors on them and ( iii ) the associated syndrome .",

    "an edge that is not incident on a @xmath26-vertex will be mapped to an edge in @xmath36 .",
    "edges that are incident on a @xmath26-vertex can be thought as being mapped to the empty set .",
    "a @xmath26-face in @xmath37 will continue to be a face in @xmath36 as it is not incident on any @xmath26-vertices .",
    "a 3-cell has exactly 4 faces and on the deletion of a @xmath26-vertex just the @xmath26-face in its boundary will be left in @xmath36 .",
    "a @xmath25-cell in @xmath14 corresponds to a qubit , so we can interpret the @xmath26-face in its boundary as the qubit in @xmath36 . since every face is shared between two 3-cells ,",

    "so an open question for further research is to study the decoding of 3d toric codes .",
    "this map could also find application in the decoding of gauge color codes @xcite by projecting onto 3d toric codes .",
    "another avenue for further research is to study the possible use of this map for fault tolerant quantum computing protocols .",
