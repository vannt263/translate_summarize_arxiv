    "the hadron production in nuclear collisions at relativistic and ultrarelativistic energies is under extensive experimental and theoretical investigation @xcite .",
    "one question of debate is whether hadron production is thermal ,  i.e. , whether the hadron multiplicities for a given volume and energy density are distributed according to maximum entropy , or whether the particle multiplicity distribution reflects additional dynamical constraints .",
    "this question is not easy to answer .",
    "first the thermal model has various versions and depending on the additional input the answers on thermal parameters differ @xcite .",
    "some of the differences in the various models are the number of included resonance states @xcite , the use of a canonical or grand canonical framework @xcite , the inclusion of hard core repulsion @xcite , the inclusion of strangeness suppression @xcite , the inclusion of other off - equilibrium parametrizations @xcite , or the inclusion of finite size corrections in the density of states @xcite .",
    "the second important source of uncertainty in the judgment of thermal behavior is the incomplete measurement of the final hadronic state .",
    "not all particles which are stable with respect to the strong interaction can be measured , and all measurements cover only a finite part of the complete momentum space .",
    "some measurements cover nearly the full solid angle , e.g. , na49 @xcite , in symmetric collision systems , but some are restricted to only a small kinematic window @xcite .",
    "the bias of the restricted information is the goal of our study here .",
    "we use the transport approach rqmd(version 2.3 ) @xcite for generating the full momentum space information on all stable particles .",
    "rqmd provides a microscopic description of heavy ion collisions which has been quite successful in predicting most of the observed features over a wide range of conditions and is therefore very well suited for our investigations .",
    "the parameters of the thermal model may be understood as lagrangian multipliers in extremizing the total entropy under certain constraints . for a given point particle volume",
    "@xmath0 we have as parameters the temperature @xmath1 ( the lagrangian multiplier to achieve a certain average energy density ) and chemical potentials @xmath2 ( the lagrangian multipliers to constrain the system on average to a conserved total charge @xmath3 )",
    ". in our case the conserved charges are baryon number @xmath4 , strangeness @xmath5 , and electrical charge @xmath6 . instead of @xmath4 , @xmath6 , and @xmath5 one",
    "can equivalently conserve the net number of valence quarks for each flavor , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , since on the relevant time scale only strong interactions are important .",
    "the relations between the chemical potentials in both descriptions are @xmath10 the corresponding fugacities are defined by @xmath11    we know from pp collisions that strangeness is not in full chemical equilibrium with the nonstrange hadrons @xcite . therefore we allow for a deviation of strange particles from complete chemical equilibrium .",
    "however , we force the strange particles to be in chemical equilibrium among each other @xcite .",
    "this requirement is equivalent to the introduction of the additional constraint that the total number of strange valence quarks @xmath12 be conserved on the average . the lagrangian multiplier for this constraint",
    " expressed as a fugacity  is @xcite @xmath13 @xmath14 is a measure of the chemical saturation of strangeness with @xmath15 meaning undersaturation , @xmath16 saturation , i.e. , chemical equilibrium , and @xmath17 oversaturation .    in the grand canonical description with the parameters introduced above the multiplicity @xmath18 of a particle @xmath19 with mass @xmath20 and spin degeneracy @xmath21",
    "is given by @xmath22 the @xmath23 denote the corresponding valence quark contents of particle species @xmath19 .",
    "the upper sign is for fermions , the lower sign for bosons . with the exception of pions we use for all particles the boltzmann approximation ; i.e.",
    ", the sum over the index @xmath24 is truncated at @xmath25 .    for broad resonances ( @xmath26 mev ) we replace the @xmath27 function in eq .",
    "( [ yields ] ) by a breit - wigner distribution @xmath28 @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the width of the resonance @xmath19 , @xmath31 a threshold for the production of resonances , and @xmath32 an upper cutoff .",
    "we use @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "the normalization @xmath35 is determined by @xmath36 .",
    "equation ( [ yields ] ) gives the multiplicity of primary hadrons and resonances .",
    "the index for the particle species @xmath19 runs over all hadrons of the review of particle properties @xcite with @xmath37 gev .",
    "the final hadron yields of stable hadrons include the decay contributions of the resonances . unless otherwise stated we consider all these hadrons as stable which are stable with respect to strong decays .",
    "an exception is the @xmath38 which is taken to be stable in order to be in agreement with the special mode of rqmd used here ( see below ) .",
    "the branching ratios are taken from @xcite , where missing or inaccurate entries have been completed by the requirement that all branching ratios for a resonance have to add to 1 .",
    "the thermal model used here is in practical respects very similar to the one in @xcite .",
    "the main difference is the use of the grand canonical approach for all conserved charges in the study here .",
    "in addition there are small differences in the implementation of particle properties and decays where accurate numbers are missing in @xcite .",
    "we use the following values for the assignment of hidden strangeness : @xmath39    we show in tables [ tab1 ] and [ tab2 ] a comparison between the fits using the fully grand canonical approach and the partly canonical approach of@xcite .",
    "the two additional chemical potentials in our approach are determined by the same constraints as used in @xcite , i.e. , strangeness neutrality and electric charge conservation : @xmath40 @xmath41 is the ratio of charge over mass number of the colliding nuclei .",
    "we have the same number of degrees of freedom as in the canonical approach .",
    "we see from tables [ tab1 ] and [ tab2 ] that the two approaches are equivalent on the level of a few percent .",
    "we now turn to rqmd(version 2.3 ) as the source for our particle multiplicities .",
    "the rqmd transport model @xcite is based on the excitation and fragmentation of colour strings followed by hadronic reinteractions .",
    "the version used [ rqmd(version 2.3 ) ] contains the color rope mechanism @xcite , an important source for the production of the strange hadrons which are of special interest in our study .",
    "it has been shown by comparison with experimental data @xcite that rqmd reproduces the main properties in hadron production .",
    "it is therefore a reliable model for generating the full momentum space information of all produced stable hadrons . in order to get also a @xmath38 multiplicity we treated in this investigation the @xmath38 as a stable particle .",
    "we generated about 400 rqmd events each for s+s and pb+pb collisions with a centrality of 5% of @xmath43 .",
    "the error on the input data is very important in the minimization of @xmath44 .",
    "hadron yields from rqmd have only a statistical error which can be made arbitrarily small if only enough events are generated . in order to put thermal fits to experimental data and thermal fits to rqmd yields on the same footing we give the multiplicities calculated by rqmd the same relative error as the corresponding experimental value .",
    "the actual statistical errors from 400 rqmd events were in nearly all cases smaller than the corresponding experimental ones .",
    "we show in table [ relerror ] a summary of relative errors used for rqmd multiplicities , either taken directly from experiment or related to other entries of experimental relative errors .    in tables",
    "[ s5stat ] and [ pb5stat ] ( rightmost column ) the @xmath42 yields of the rqmd(version 2.3 ) simulation are shown as well as yields counted in a central rapidity window of varying size .",
    "the given multiplicities do not contain any decay contributions from weak or electromagnetic decays .",
    "the cited rqmd multiplicities differ in this respect from the experimental ones . in",
    "the thermal fits the corresponding changes have always been incorporated by the use of the appropriate decay channels .",
    "we performed different thermal fits to the rqmd @xmath42 multiplicities .",
    "first , we included in the thermal fit only the subset of particles as used in the thermal model description of experimental data in @xcite .",
    "the result is shown in table [ rqmd1 ] .",
    "compared to the thermal fit of experimental data in @xcite ( see also table [ tab2 ] ) we see that the thermal fit parameters of the rqmd analysis are close to the experimental ones only in the case of s+s collisions .",
    "a significant discrepancy is seen for the pb+pb collisions .",
    "the extracted temperature for example differs by about 30 mev .",
    "we interpret this as an indication of larger differences in the hadron production between rqmd and the experiment .",
    "we do not try to investigate where the main differences between rqmd and the data lie , since this is , first of all , out of scope of this paper and , second , most of the experimental data are preliminary and thus it is too premature to speculate about physical reasons",
    ". the reader should further note that a direct comparison of experimental yields and the here calculated yields from rqmd is not reasonable since the yields of @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 contain no weak or electromagnetic contribution in the case of rqmd while such decays are partly included in the data .",
    "in addition , the experimental data of pb+pb collisions contain hadron yields and ratios which were measured in a limited acceptance and were extrapolated to @xmath42 .",
    "for all these reasons a thermal fit to the experimental pb+pb data would be premature .",
    "we would also like to draw the attention to the very low @xmath48 compared to the experimental fit .",
    "the small value of @xmath48 is partly a result of the used relative errors for rqmd .",
    "since this error was taken from experiment , it contains the systematic error of the corresponding experiment . as a result of  perfect reconstruction efficiency \" in rqmd the error",
    "is overestimated . using only the statistical error of rqmd would lead to a @xmath49 for s+s collisions and @xmath50 for pb+pb collisions .",
    "nevertheless , we keep the relative experimental error for rqmd yields , since we want to have the same relative weights of hadrons in a thermal fit as it is typical for an analysis of experimental data .",
    "we discuss the thermal character of rqmd yields in more detail below .",
    "we now show in the rightmost column of tables [ s5statsum ] and [ pb5statsum ] the resulting thermal parameters of a thermal fit including all stable particles from rqmd .",
    "the comparison between the rqmd yields and the thermal ones is given in tables [ s5stat ] and [ pb5stat ] , respectively .",
    "the most striking difference to the fit with the reduced number of hadrons is the increase in the @xmath48 by a factor of about 25 , while the thermal parameters are basically the same .",
    "only for @xmath14 do we observe a small decrease with increasing number of stable particles .",
    "the result is understood by looking at the largest deviations of the thermal fit from the rqmd yields in tables [ s5stat ] and [ pb5stat ] . in terms of standard deviations ( s.d . ) between the @xmath42 thermal fit and rqmd we have the largest deviations for @xmath51 ( s+s , 29 s.d . ;",
    "pb+pb , 15 s.d . ) , @xmath52 ( s+s , 9 s.d . ; pb+pb , 8 s.d . ) , @xmath38 ( s+s , 6.7 s.d . ; pb+pb , 4.7 s.d . ) and k@xmath53 ( s+s , 9 s.d . ) .",
    "interestingly , also in the thermal fit of ref .",
    "@xcite to the pb+pb data the @xmath52 and @xmath51 spoil the otherwise good fit , although their deviations go into the opposite direction .",
    "the above result shows that the thermal fit gets worse if all stable particles are considered , while a reduced number of particle species suggest a better thermal behavior .",
    "the multistrange baryons are mostly responsible for the breakdown of the otherwise nice thermal behavior .",
    "this is illustrated in figs .",
    "[ figure1 ] and [ figure2 ] where the result of the thermal fit with the reduced number of input particles of table [ rqmd1 ] is displayed .",
    "in addition to the fitted input particles ( solid squares ) the resulting other multiplicities of these thermal fits are shown as open circles . for both collision systems the @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and @xmath54 show the largest deviations .",
    "the @xmath48 of the thermal model with the parameters of table [ rqmd1 ] applied to all stable multiplicities of tables [ s5stat ] and [ pb5stat ] , respectively , leads to @xmath55 for s+s and @xmath56 for pb+pb , while excluding @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , and @xmath60 leads to @xmath61 for s+s and to @xmath62 for pb+pb .",
    "we see here the breakdown of the concept of relative strangeness equilibrium @xcite which is violated by various strange particle species .",
    "the thermal fit has the tendency to underestimate the meson yields , and the thermal @xmath63 and @xmath64 ( anti)baryons are roughly in agreement with rqmd , while the @xmath65 ( anti)baryons are overpredicted by the thermal model with optimized parameters relative to rqmd . the decrease of @xmath14 from the thermal fit with a reduced number of hadrons compared to the fit with all stable hadrons is a result of the above - mentioned undersaturation of the rqmd multistrange hadrons .",
    "this can nicely be seen in figs .",
    "[ figure1 ] and [ figure2 ] .",
    "an explanation for the above findings was offered in @xcite where the unexpectedly small inverse slope @xcite of the @xmath51 @xmath66 spectrum was investigated within the rqmd model .",
    "it was found that the @xmath51 decouples very early from the rest of the fireball .",
    "it is therefore very unlikely that the @xmath51 comes into chemical equilibrium with the rest of the hadrons .",
    "the same may also partly be true for the @xmath54 .",
    "a word of caution is necessary here .",
    "we see in figs .",
    "[ figure1 ] and [ figure2 ] that the @xmath51 and @xmath52 have the largest deviations from the thermal fit .",
    "however , one must note that the physics of the @xmath51(@xmath52 ) production in rqmd is not treated on the same high quality level as the other particles . since the @xmath51 was of minor physical relevance before",
    " this has changed with the high precision measurement of @xmath51 ratios @xcite and slopes @xcite  a precise implementation of the @xmath51 production physics in rqmd was neglected .",
    "the used strangeness suppression factors and decuplet - octet suppression factors result already in @xmath67 collisions in @xmath51 and @xmath52 yields which are a factor of 2 too low .",
    "so far no @xmath51(@xmath52 ) production via resonance states has been incorporated .",
    "the above - mentioned shortcomings reduce the @xmath51(@xmath52 ) yields .",
    "therefore an improvement of the @xmath51 physics within rqmd will lead to smaller deviations from the thermal fit than seen now .",
    "we conclude from this section that a relatively small subset of hadrons looks more thermal than the complete set of stable particles .",
    "thermal behavior should therefore always be tested taking as many hadron species into account as possible .",
    "nevertheless , we saw only minor changes in the thermal parameters between the thermal fit with a reduced number of hadrons and the thermal fit with all stable hadrons .",
    "therefore , the experimentally accessible subset of hadrons is suited to determine the thermal parameters temperature , chemical potentials and the fireball point particle volume .",
    "@xmath14 , however , is sensitive ( at least in the case of rqmd ) to the multistrange ( anti)baryons and should therefore be extracted by considering the full set of particles .",
    "particle yields or ratios are very often only accessible in a limited kinematic range . while an extrapolation in @xmath66 can be performed rather reliably due to the observed nearly exponential behavior of the @xmath68 spectra , an extrapolation in rapidity is much more difficult because different hadron species are known to have quite differently shaped rapidity spectra .",
    "a thermal fit in case of kinematic cuts needs model assumptions about the momentum distributions of the particles .",
    "the simplest assumption one can make is the assumption of bjorken scaling in rapidity @xcite .",
    "however , as a result of the much too low beam energy , bjorken scaling has not been seen in rqmd or in the experimental data at sps energies .",
    "taking , however , the analyzed rapidity window to be very narrow around midrapidity the bjorken scaling assumption might be approximately valid . in @xcite",
    "it is shown that within the hydrodynamic model the extraction of thermal parameters from yields in a limited rapidity range works quite reasonably .",
    "we like to investigate the systematic error of rapidity cuts in a similar way with the help of rqmd events .    for this investigation we first integrate the particle momentum distribution over various rapidity intervals ( see , e.g. , table [ pb5stat ] ) .",
    "then we assume bjorken scaling around midrapidity in the sense that these yields or ratios are fitted by eq .",
    "( [ yields ] ) without correction due to the finite rapidity interval .",
    "therefore the fitting procedure is the same as for the full momentum space yields , but the volume has to be considered as the sum of comoving subvolumes .",
    "we show in tables [ s5stat ] and [ s5statsum ] the results for central s+s collisions and in tables [ pb5stat ] and [ pb5statsum ] the corresponding results for pb+pb collision .",
    "in s+s collisions we see a clear decrease of the temperature with decreasing width of the rapidity window which is accompanied by an increase in @xmath14 and a decrease in @xmath69 .",
    "the decrease of @xmath69 is a result of the baryon hole around midrapidity in s+s collisions @xcite .",
    "the increase in @xmath14 reflects the fact that rqmd , like the experiment , produces strange quarks more efficiently in the central region . on a weaker scale the same tendencies",
    "are seen for pb+pb collisions .",
    "an interpretation of this result is done in connection with a similar study of s+s collisions within the hydrodynamic model @xcite . in this study",
    "much smaller deviations between a global thermal fit and particle yields resulting from integration over different rapidity windows were found . in order to understand the difference one has to realize that in rqmd the physics , especially the physics of strange particle production , in the central region is different from the fragmentation regions .",
    "therefore the change here in thermal parameters with the analyzed rapidity window resembles mostly a change in physics , while in the case of the hydrodynamical model by construction the pure kinematic bias was investigated . while a purely kinematic influence increases the temperature in the central region @xcite the differences in physics decrease the central temperature compared to a @xmath42 analysis .",
    "it was further found @xcite that for systems with large longitudinal flow the artificial change of thermal parameters is small .",
    "therefore the change of thermal parameters with the rapidity window in the case of rqmd is clearly dominated by the physics component .",
    "thus we interpret the large change of thermal parameters with different rapidity window size as a result of no global equilibrium in these collisions and the deviations from a global equilibrium is much larger in s+s collisions compared to pb+pb collisions",
    ". however , there might still be local thermal and chemical equilibrium in the experiments as well as in the rqmd model . for a study of local equilibrium in rqmd",
    "we refer to @xcite and in urqmd to @xcite .",
    "we only want here to emphasize that rapidity cuts can lead to considerable changes in the thermal parameters adjusted to a collision system .",
    "the change is the larger the further away the system is from global equilibrium .",
    "in addition we see that the @xmath48 is best for @xmath42 integrated input data ; as the rapidity interval is narrowed , we see a fluctuating but increasing @xmath48 .",
    "we have used the rqmd model to address some questions arising in the application of the thermal model to particle production in ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions .",
    "we have performed a thermal fit to rqmd multiplicities , where the errors in the rqmd yields have been adjusted to be of the same order as typical for experiments .",
    "first we found that for an input consisting of only a small number of hadron species  typical for existing experiments  the rqmd yields can be nicely reproduced by a thermal model .",
    "this suggests at a first glance global thermal behavior .",
    "however , comparing the thermal model with the full set of stable particles leads to significant deviations .",
    "the largest discrepancy from thermal behavior is found for the multistrange hadrons .",
    "the usual small sample of particle species still gives nearly the same thermal parameters as the fit with the full set of stable hadrons .",
    "experimentally the @xmath42 data are very scare and extrapolation is always required when a thermal fit is performed .",
    "our results imply that one must be careful when using the thermal model to analyze the experimental data since the constrain is global , _ not local _",
    "@xcite .",
    "it is difficult to assess whether the complete set of @xmath42 multiplicities including the multistrange ( anti)particles from rqmd shows still  good \" thermal behavior .",
    "a judgment on the basis of the absolute value of @xmath48 is not reasonable because @xmath48 depends strongly on the assumed error of the multiplicities and , given certain existing deviations of the rqmd output from thermal behavior , becomes arbitrarily large as the statistical error on the yields becomes smaller and smaller by generating more and more events .",
    "a more useful criterion for judging the quality of the thermal fits may be given by the average deviation of the best thermal fit ( with the relative errors from experiment ) from the rqmd mean multiplicity .",
    "it is of the order of 20% for the fit in tables [ s5stat ] and [ pb5stat ] , of order 8% for a fit excluding the @xmath51 and @xmath52 , and of order 4% for a fit excluding @xmath51 , all @xmath54 states and the corresponding antiparticles .",
    "given that the absolute yields of the different hadrons species vary over three orders of magnitude these numbers suggest that rqmd yields are roughly in agreement with a thermal model interpretation .",
    "however , it must be shown  similar to the studies for the kinetic freeze - out in rqmd @xcite or as done for the urqmd model in @xcite  that the extracted chemical freeze - out parameters are meaningful in the sense that the microscopic state of rqmd at chemical freeze - out is in agreement with chemical and kinetic equilibrium and that the resulting microscopic thermal parameters are the same as for the analysis presented here .    in a very recent publication the result of a thermal fit to urqmd midrapidity ratios",
    "was presented @xcite . in the case of pb",
    "+ pb @xmath70 gev collisions an agreement was found between the urqmd multiplicities and the thermal model on the same quality level as presented here but with slightly different parameters for temperature 140 mev@xcite vs 154 mev here ( see table [ pb5statsum ] left column ) and @xmath71@xcite vs 1.57 here .",
    "the detailed microscopic study in @xcite revealed that two fundamental assumptions of the  thermal model , \" i.e. , universal freeze - out and global equilibrium , are violated ; from this the authors @xcite concluded that thermal fits to particle ratios are meaningless .",
    "we , on the other hand , would like to reserve judgement on the meaningfulness of thermal fits to particle multiplicities until we understand why a thermal fit to particle yields works much better than the large violation of common freeze - out @xcite and global equilibrium @xcite would suggest .",
    "we also investigated the influence of rapidity cuts on the extracted thermal parameters .",
    "there is a change of thermal parameters with decreasing size of the analyzed rapidity window .",
    "this change is dominantly due to nonglobal equilibrium effects in these collisions .",
    "thus one has to keep in mind that there is a nonnegligible bias on the extracted thermal parameters due to cuts in rapidity .    *",
