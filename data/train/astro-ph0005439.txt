    "ultra high energy astrophysical neutrino ( uhe@xmath16 ) from pevs ( @xmath17 ev ) up to ( @xmath18 ev ) eev and gzk cut off energies ( @xmath19 ev ) might be traced by @xmath0 induced air showers and by their millions to hundred billions multiplicity in secondaries particles , ( @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 ) .",
    "+ indeed astrophysical pevs uhe anti - neutrino electrons , @xmath14 , near the glashow w resonance peak , @xmath23 , ( dominant over expected uhe pev atmospheric neutrino signals ) , may be observable by their secondary horizontal @xmath0 air showers originated by uhe chain reaction @xmath24 inside the concrete rock of a high mountain .",
    "also uhe @xmath10 , @xmath25 at ( @xmath26 - @xmath27ev ) interacting with nuclear matter ( @xmath10 @xmath28 ) must be observable if flavor mixing @xmath29 take place as shown by superkamiokande data , because of huge astrophysical distances respect to oscillation ones . +",
    "therefore uhe @xmath1 and @xmath30 may be converted and they may reach us from high energy galactic sources , as pulsars , snrs , black holes or galactic sgrs microquasars , as well as from powerful extragalactic agns , quasars or grbs , even for any small mass mixing , ( @xmath31 ev @xmath32 ) or any high ( gzk ) energy because of the large galactic ( kpcs ) and extreme cosmic ( mpcs ) distances :    @xmath33    rare upward uhe @xmath0 , born by @xmath1 and @xmath30 nuclear ( or rare @xmath34 interactions near the upward earth surface ) , may escape outside on air where they may spontaneously decay triggering upward vertical , oblique or near horizontal @xmath0 air showers .",
    "the vertical ones ( by small nadir angle ) occur preferentially at low energies nearly transparent to the earth ( @xmath35 ev ) .",
    "the oblique @xmath0 air showers whose arrival directions have large nadir angle , are related mainly to higher energy @xmath1 , or @xmath30 nuclear interactions ( @xmath36 ev ) .",
    "indeed these horizontal - upward uhe @xmath1 cross a smaller fraction of the earth volume and consequently they suffer less absorption toward the horizon .",
    "+ these huge horizontal or upward air - shower signals being at least million to billion times more abundant than the original and unique uhe @xmath0 or uhe @xmath8 track in underground km cube detectors are much easier to be discovered with no ambiguity .",
    "we remind that long tracks in km@xmath37 detectors are mostly noisy signals by tevs to tens of tevs muons secondaries generated by atmospheric neutrinos born by common cosmic ray interactions in upper atmosphere .",
    "the @xmath0 air shower is analogous to the learned and pakwasa @xmath38 `` double bang '' in underground neutrino detectors .",
    "the novelty of the present `` one bang in '' ( the rock ) - `` one bang out '' ( the air ) lays in the self - triggered explosive nature of @xmath0 decay in flight and its consequent huge amplified air shower signal at a characteristic few kms distance .",
    "detectable horizontal gamma bursts ( mainly bremsstrahlung photons ) are among the most abundant signal .",
    "the source of uhe @xmath1 , since super kamiokande evidence of neutrino flavour mixing , must be as abundant as muon @xmath39 ones .",
    "+ moreover the expected @xmath40 signals , by their secondary tau tracks at highest cosmic ray energy window @xmath41 , must exceed the corresponding @xmath42 ( or muonic ) ones , making uhe @xmath43 above @xmath44 eev the most probable uhe signal .",
    "indeed , the lorentz - boosted tau range length grows ( linearly ) above muon range , for @xmath45 ; ( see fig ( 1 ) eq.3 ) : the tau track reaches its maxima extension , bounded not by pair production ( eq .",
    "2 ) , but by growing nuclear electro - weak interactions ( eq .",
    "4 ) , @xmath46 , at energy @xmath47 .    @xmath48}{(\\ln \\ , 10 ^ 4 ) } \\right\\ } .\\ ] ]    @xmath49    @xmath50    at this peak the tau range is nearly @xmath51 times longer than the corresponding muon range ( at the same energy ) implying , for comparable fluxes , a ratio 20 times larger in @xmath40 over @xmath42 detection probability .",
    "this dominance , may lead to a few rare spectacular event a year ( if flavor mixing occurs ) preferentially in horizontal plane in underground @xmath52 detectors .",
    "the earth opacity at those uhe regimes at large nadir angles ( nearly horizontal , few degree upward direction ) is exponentially different for uhe muons respect to tau at gzk energies ( corresponding to 500 kms uhe tau lenghts ) , making the muon / tau flux ratio of such lenghts severely ( half billion time ) suppressed .",
    "uhe @xmath16 above gzk are transparent to bbr cosmic photons and they may easily reach us from far cosmological distances . therefore the puzzle of uhecr above gzk cut off may be solved assuming that neutrinos ( possibly of heaviest muon / tau nature)share a light mass of few ev , in the frame - work of hot dark matter halos clustered around galaxies .",
    "such light neutrinos may form a huge hidden dark calorimeter able to beam dump uhe @xmath16 via @xmath53 ( s - channel ) , via virtual @xmath54 ( @xmath55 channel ) or w pair productions .",
    "the corresponding cross sections for such @xmath16 @xmath16 interactions are shown in fig .",
    "2 ; their secondaries may be final uhe anti - protons ( or anti - neutrons ) or uhe protons ( or neutrons ) ( fargion , mele , salis 1997 - 1999 ) responsible of final observed uhecr above gzk cut off .",
    "the interaction efficency by relic light neutrinos via uhe @xmath16 at gzk cut off is thousands times larger than uhe @xmath16 interactions on earth atmosphere and/or direct uhecr ( nucleons , nuclei ) propagations above gzk distances .",
    "therefore light neutrino mass may explain both hot dark matter and uhecr above gzk ( as well as their recent clustering in triplets or doublets ) .",
    "just to emphasize the @xmath16 mass roles in high energy astrophysics , we remind the important case of a sn mevs neutrino burst arriving slowed by its mass relativistic flight and its delayed arrival from far sn ( galactic or better extragalactic ) events respect to the massless ( prompt coeval ) gravitational waves .",
    "the expected time delay between the massless graviton wave burst ( by supernova quadrupole emission at distance l and the @xmath56 neutronization neutrino burst ) , will be an additional tests test to the elusive mass detection : @xmath57 sec @xmath58 .",
    "( fargion 1981 ) .",
    "let us remind that massive neutrino imply new right handed interactions in early universe ( antonelli , r.konoplich , d.fargion 1981 ) and multifluid gravitational clustering during galaxy formation epochs ( d.fargion 1981 , 1983 ) .",

    "additional energy calibration may be derived sampling shower intensities .",
    "+ hundreds of detectors in deep wide valley would be necessary to get tens taus of event a year .",
    "+ screening by undesirable lateral or downward noisy cosmic rays or natural radiation is possible by directional and time clustering filter ; therefore the induced @xmath62 air shower even in absence of @xmath63 oscillation should be identified and detectable soon .",
    "its unique @xmath14 origin is marked by the peaked w resonance , and by the small mountain @xmath14 opacity and its high neutrino cross - section .",
    "its identity is marked by the expected fine tuned pev energy at w peak and the tau air - shower birth place near ( a hundred meter ) the mountain wall . + more copious ( @xmath64 times more ) events by pev up to tens pev @xmath65 @xmath4 interaction occur if , as most of us believe , @xmath66 oscillate in @xmath1 . + it will be also possible to discover uhe @xmath0 , by observing the upward tau air - shower arriving from hundred kilometers away ( near horizontal edges ) from high mountains , high balloon and satellites ; such uhe tau created within a wide ( tens thousands to millions square km@xmath32 wide and hundred meter uhe tau depth in earth crust ) target would discover easely uhe @xmath10,@xmath2 neutrinos at pev up to eev energies and above , just within the mysterious gzk frontiers .",
    "the discover will need capable gamma , optical and mainly muon bundle detectors within present technology as studied elsewhere .",
    "+ from the same highest mountains , balloons and near orbit satellite , looking more downward toward the earth it is possible to discover more frequent but lower energetic astrophysical @xmath67 pev - tens pev neutrinos still nearly transparent to the earth volumes and ( gandhi et al .",
    "1998),(see fig.3 ) .",
    "+ the uhe neutrinos @xmath68,@xmath69 @xmath70 are default and expected uhecr ( @xmath71 ev ) secondary products near agn or microquasars by common photo - pion decay relics by optical photons nearby the source ( psrs , agns ) ( @xmath72 ) , or by proton proton scattering in galactic interstellar matter .",
    "the maximal observational distances from mountains , baloons or satellites , may reach @xmath73 110 km @xmath74 toward the horizon , corresponding to a uhe @xmath0 energy @xmath75 ev @xmath76 .",
    "therefore we propose to consider such upward shower nearly horizontal detection from high mountains to test this highest @xmath77 energy window almost opaque to glashow uhe @xmath68 fluxes .",
    "the expected downward muon number of events @xmath78 in the resonant energy range , in km@xmath37 , [ table 7,the gandhi et all,1998 ] was found to be @xmath79 a year .",
    "one expect a comparable number of reactions @xmath80 .",
    "however the possible presence of primordial @xmath81 by flavor mixing and @xmath82 charged current interactions lead to a factor 5 larger rate , @xmath83 event / year .",
    "+ if one immagines a gamma / optical detector at 5 km far in front of the alps argentier mountains ( size 10 km , height 1 km ) one finds a @xmath0 air shower volume observable within a narrow beamed cone ( moliere radius @xmath84 m / distance @xmath85 km ) : ( @xmath86 , @xmath87 ) and an effective volume @xmath88 km@xmath37 for each observational detector ( fargion 2000 ) .",
    "each one is comparable to roughly twice a super kamiokande detector .",
    "we expect , following agn - ss91 model [ the gandhi et all,1998 ] a total rate of : ( 6 ) ( @xmath89 ) + ( 29 ) ( @xmath4 ) = 35 uhe @xmath1 event / year / km@xmath37 ; at energies above 3 pev we may expect a total rate of n@xmath90 @xmath73 158 event / year in this alps argentiere mountains valley and nearly 3.2 @xmath91 event / year for each detector . in a first approximation , neglecting earth opacity , it is possible to show that the earth volume observable from the top of a mountain at height @xmath92 , due to uhe @xmath0 at 3 pev crossing from below , is approximately v @xmath93 km@xmath37 @xmath94 .",
    "the upward shower would hit the top of the mountain .",
    "for the same @xmath0 air shower beaming ( @xmath95 , @xmath96 ) we derive now an effective volume @xmath73 1 km@xmath37 .",
    "therefore a detector open at @xmath97 angle on a top of a 2 km height mountain may observe nearly an event every two month from below the earth .",
    "the gamma signal above few mev would be ( depending on arrival nadir angle ) between @xmath98 @xmath99 ( for small nadir angle ) to @xmath100 @xmath99 at far distance within 3 pev energies .",
    "a contemporaneous ( microsecond ) optical flash ( @xmath101 ) must occur . keeping care of the earth opacity , at large nadir angle ( @xmath102 ) where an average earth density may be assumed ( @xmath103 ) the transmission probability and creation of upward uhe @xmath0 is approximately      this value , at pev",
    "is a fraction of a million .",
    "+ the corresponding angular integral effective volume observable from a high mountain ( or baloon ) at height @xmath92 ( assuming a final target terrestrial density @xmath105 ) is :      this rate is quite large and the expected @xmath0 air airshower signal ( gamma burst at energies @xmath107 ) should be @xmath108 @xmath99 , while the gamma flux at ( @xmath109 ) or lower energies ( from electron pair bremsstrahlung ) may be two order of magnitude larger .",
    "+ the optical cherenkov flux is large @xmath110 @xmath99 .",
    "the tau upward air showers born in a narrow energy window , @xmath111 ev @xmath112 ev ( fig.3 ) may penetrate high altitude leaving rare beamed upward gamma shower bursts whose sharp ( @xmath113 hundreds @xmath8sec because of the hundred kms high altitude shower distances ) time structure and whose hard ( @xmath114ev ) spectra may hit near terrestrial satellites .",
    "we claim ( fargion 2000 ) that such gamma upward events originated by tau air showers produce gamma bursts at the edge of gro - batse sensitivity threshold .",
    "in particular we argue that very probably such upward gamma events have been already detected since april 1991 as serendipitious sharp ( @xmath115 sec ) and hard ( @xmath116 ev ) batse gamma triggers originated from the earth and named consequently as terrestrial gamma flashes ( tgf ) .",
    "the visible earth surface from a satellite , like batse , at height @xmath117 km and the consequent effective volume for uhe @xmath4 pevs interaction and @xmath0 air shower beamed within @xmath118 is : ( note @xmath119 because 70 % of the earth is covered by seas ) @xmath120 the effective volume and the event rate should be reduced , at large nadir angle ( @xmath121 ) by the atmosphere depth and opacity ( for a given @xmath122 energy ) .",
    "therefore the observable volume may be reduced approximately to within 15 km@xmath37 values and the expected uhe pev event rate is @xmath123    the tgf signals would be mainly @xmath7 at flux @xmath124 @xmath99 at x hundred kev energies .",
    "the observed tgf rate is lower by nearly an order of magnitude , and this suggests higher @xmath125 energies ( to overcome batse threshold ) and consequently small additional probability suppression leading to observed tgf events rate .",
    "however since 1994 ( fishman et al . ) tgf understanding of presently known 75 records over nearly eight thousand batse triggers is based on an unexpected and mysterious high latitude lightening of geophysical nature ( the so called `` sprites '' or `` blue jets '' ) .",
    "we do not believe in that interpretation .",
    "we notice that among the 75 records only 47 are published in their details , while 28 tgf are still unpublished .",
    "their data release is therefore urgent and critical . while blue jets might be in principle triggered by upward tau air showers in the atmosphere ( a giant `` wilson '' room ) we believe they are not themselves source of tgf .",
    "in particular their observed characteristic propagation velocity ( @xmath126 km / s ) from distances @xmath73 500 km , disagree with short tgf millisecond timing and would favor a characteristic tgf time of few seconds .",
    "+ moreover tgf data strongly disfavor by its hard spectra the terrestrial sprites connection . on the contrary the expected uhe tau upward air showers lead to a gamma burst flux , spectra , and fine time structure fluence in agreement with the observed tgf ones and in agreement with the expected flux models .",
    "the correlations of these clustered tgfs directions toward + ( 1 ) well known and maximal powerful galactic and extra - galactic sources either at tev , gev - mev , x band , ( 2 ) recent first anisotropy discovered on uhecr at eev by agasa , ( see fig.4 , and hayoshida et al .",
    "1999 ) ( 3 ) the milky way galactic plane , support and make compelling the tgf identification as secondary gamma burst tail of uhe @xmath0 induced upward air shower .",
    "the present tgf-@xmath0 air - shower identification could not be produced by uhe @xmath14 charged current resonant event at ( @xmath127 ev ) , and therefore it stand for the uhe @xmath77 existence .",
    "consequently it gives support to the superkamiokande evidences for @xmath29 flavor mixing from far psrs or agns sources toward the earth . at the present the very probable @xmath128 source of tgfs and their probable partial galactic location",
    "infer a first lower bound on @xmath129 ( @xmath130 kpc , @xmath131 ev@xmath32 ) and it offers a first direct test of the same existence of the last missing , yet unobserved , fundamental neutral lepton particle : @xmath1 and @xmath132 .",
