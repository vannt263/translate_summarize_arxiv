    "the _ nariai spacetime _ was discovered by nariai in 1950 ( see the reprints of the original works in @xcite ) .",
    "it is the solution of einstein s vacuum equations for spacetime metrics and the sign convention for curvature tensors in @xcite . in this convention",
    "the de - sitter spacetime is a solution of eq .   with @xmath0 . ]",
    "@xmath1 where either as _ any _ positive constant or set @xmath2 .",
    "] @xmath0 is the cosmological constant and @xmath3 is the einstein tensor associated with the metric @xmath4 , with spatial topology @xmath5 and @xmath6 here , @xmath7 is the standard coordinate along the spatial @xmath8-factor and @xmath9 is the metric of the standard round unit two - sphere . the time coordinate is @xmath10 . in the last years",
    ", the nariai spacetime has become an object of special interest since ginsparg and perry @xcite found that it can be interpreted as a de - sitter universe containing a black hole of `` maximal size '' . thanks to its geometrical properties , the nariai spacetime has been used to model several situations .",
    "one of the most remarkable applications was carried out by bousso and hawking @xcite who used this spacetime to study the quantum pair creation of black holes during inflation .",
    "these cosmological models , at the borderline between inflation and gravitational collapse , restricted to spherically symmetric perturbations of the nariai spacetime .",
    "it was found that under certain conditions those models asymptotically approach the de sitter universe in agreement with the _ cosmic no - hair conjecture _ @xcite .",
    "it states that this behavior is _ generic _ for inhomogeneous and anisotropic expanding solutions of eq .  .",
    "although there is some mathematical evidence @xcite that supports the validity of this conjecture , the general case still remains unclear .",
    "a particular property of the nariai spacetime itself is its peculiar time dependence which is _ not _ consistent with this .",
    "while the spatial @xmath8-factor expands exponentially for large @xmath11 , the geometry of the spatial @xmath12-factor remains constant .",
    "thus , the expansion of this solution is very anisotropic , and , in fact , is _ inconsistent _ with the cosmic no - hair paradigm . in more geometric terms , this corresponds to the fact , which was proven for the first time in @xcite ( an alternative proof was given in @xcite ) , that the nariai spacetime does not possess even a piece of a smooth conformal boundary .",
    "if the cosmic no - hair conjecture really holds , the nariai spacetime must be therefore `` very special '' , and hence in particular be unstable under `` generic '' perturbations .    in @xcite one of us has initiated the study of _ homogeneous _ ( but fully nonlinear ) perturbations of the nariai spacetime .",
    "the nariai solution is a member of the class of _ kantowski - sachs _ spatially homogeneous ( but anisotropic ) solutions @xcite of einstein s vacuum equation with a positive cosmological constant .",
    "the spatial topology of all of these models is @xmath5 .",
    "it was found there that the nariai solution is _ critical _ in this family in the following sense .",
    "for all kantowski - sachs models , except for the nariai solution , we can choose the time orientation such that the solution either collapses to the future ( a _ big crunch _ characterized by the formation of a curvature singularity and all future inextendible causal curves are incomplete ) or expands eternally to the future in consistency with the cosmic no - hair picture ( existence of a smooth future conformal boundary in consistency with the future asymptotics of de - sitter space so that all future inextendible causal curves are complete ) .",
    "the nariai solution is exactly at the borderline between these two extremes as the curvature is bounded everywhere and all inextendible causal curves are both future and past complete , but it nevertheless does not agree with cosmic no - hair .    the first rigorous work in @xcite on this topic has recently been extended in @xcite .",
    "the numerical studies in @xcite of gowdy - symmetric @xcite ( see section  [ sec : formulationeqs ] for more details on gowdy symmetry ) inhomogeneous fully nonlinear perturbations of the nariai solution have revealed evidence that the analogous critical phenomenon also exists in much larger classes of spacetimes . in particular , it was found that all solutions , which are obtained from initial data not too far away from the nariai solutions , always either globally collapse or expand in the same manner as in the spatially homogeneous case  with the exception of _ critical solutions _ which are exactly at the borderline between these two cases .",
    "in particular , it was found that in contrast to the spherically symmetric models considered by bousso et al .  above @xcite , gowdy symmetric models never _ locally _ collapse or expand , and the formation of cosmological black holes in this class was therefore ruled out . because the perturbations considered in @xcite were small in some sense , the question remained open whether this may be different for larger gowdy symmetric perturbations .",
    "one of the finding in our paper here now suggests that gowdy symmetric models indeed never form cosmological black holes . for future work",
    ", it will be interesting to pose this question again within more general classes of spacetimes , for example @xmath13-symmetric spacetimes , and study whether cosmological black holes may be created by perturbations of the nariai spacetime .",
    "before we continue , let us remind the reader about the heuristic idea of the study of the criticality of the cosmological models in @xcite .",
    "there we worked with gowdy symmetric initial data ( which satisfy the constraint equation implied by eq .  )",
    "given by two real parameters @xmath14 and @xmath15 whose precise definition is irrelevant now ( cf .  @xcite for the details ) .",
    "the special choice @xmath16 corresponds to nariai initial data while @xmath17 and @xmath18 yields a class of spatially homogeneous models .",
    "the larger the value of @xmath19 is , however , the `` more spatially inhomogeneous '' the initial data are .",
    "the idea was to fix some non - zero value of the `` inhomogeneity parameter '' @xmath15 and then to study a sequence of ( fully nonlinear ) cosmological models given by a sequence of values of @xmath14 .",
    "on the one hand , it was found that if @xmath14 is sufficiently large , the corresponding model expands globally to the future ; in fact , the solution develops a smooth conformal boundary to the future in this case and is hence fully consistent with the cosmic no - hair conjecture .",
    "if @xmath14 is sufficiently small on the other hand , the model collapses globally to the future and eventually forms a curvature singularity . at the borderline between these two regimes corresponding to a critical value for @xmath14 , the corresponding model _",
    "neither _ collapses nor expands to the future .",
    "however , no further information about such critical models was extracted in @xcite .    the purpose of our present paper is manifold .",
    "again , we restrict to the class of gowdy - symmetric models with a positive cosmological constant and we revisit the same situation , but tackle it with a more advanced approach . to this end",
    ", we use a different class of initial data which now depends on _ three _ parameters @xmath20 ( which has a similar meaning as the `` inhomogeneity parameter '' @xmath15 above ) , @xmath21 ( which has a similar meaning as the parameter @xmath14 above ) and an additional parameter @xmath22 which essentially controls the wave number of the inhomogeneous perturbation ( the initial data in @xcite restricted to the case @xmath23 ) . the details are discussed in section  [ sec : familyidn ] . on the one hand , we confirm and strengthen the findings in @xcite by performing a similar numerical analysis . on the other hand ,",
    "however , we shall focus in great detail on the _ critical solutions _ here and thereby reveal an interesting new oscillatory phenomenon which could potentially be interpreted as gravitational waves . the main finding of our paper are now summarized as three main results .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to provide the details and give justifications .    in all of what follows",
    "we shall assume .",
    "the case @xmath24 is a special borderline case which turns out to be not well described by our analytic method discussed in section  [ sec : heuristicmode ] .",
    "we therefore completely disregard the case @xmath24 in this paper . ]",
    "notice that the well - understood @xcite homogeneous case of our models corresponds to @xmath26 .",
    "the nariai solution is determined by @xmath27 .",
    "one can easily check that if @xmath28 or @xmath29 , the corresponding solution of eq .",
    "is not isometric to the nariai solution by comparing the kretschmann scalar with the particular globally constant value for the nariai solution .",
    "our first main finding is summarized as follows .",
    "[ conj1 ] pick any real value @xmath20 and integer @xmath25 .",
    "then there is a constant @xmath30 such that the solution of eq .  , determined by initial data given by the parameter @xmath20 , @xmath22 and any real value @xmath21 as in section  [ sec : familyidn ] , globally collapses and forms a curvature singularity if @xmath31 and globally expands in consistency with the cosmic no - hair conjecture if @xmath32 .    for small values of @xmath20 ,",
    "this result is in full consistency with the findings in @xcite .",
    "here we claim now that this also holds for large values of @xmath20 .",
    "as mentioned earlier , this rules out in particular the possibility of `` local '' collapse and hence there are generically indeed only two kinds cosmological models in this class . in this paper here",
    "we provide some more refined numerical evidence complemented by a heuristic mode analysis ( see section  [ sec : heuristicmode ] ) .",
    "we call any of our models _ critical _ if @xmath33 for any given @xmath20 and @xmath22 , and _ almost critical _ or _ close - to - critical _ if @xmath34 , but @xmath35 .    the second main finding of our work which significantly goes beyond the results in @xcite",
    "is summarized as follows .",
    "[ conj2 ] for any non - zero value of @xmath20 , the critical and close - to - critical solutions asserted in result  [ conj1 ] are oscillatory .",
    "based on the before - mentioned heuristic analysis in section  [ sec : heuristicmode ] , we are able to derive formulas for oscillation frequencies , amplitudes and phases and how these depend on the initial data parameters .",
    "the only non - oscillatory solutions correspond to the spatially homogeneous case @xmath26 in which the critical solution is known to coincide with the nariai solution ( see @xcite ) and therefore has the peculiar asymptotics discussed above .",
    "our numerical work here suggests that _ all _ the critical models , also the inhomogeneous ones , are _ nariai - like _ in the following sense .",
    "[ conj3 ] the critical solutions behave asymptotically as follows .",
    "while the spatial @xmath8-factor expands exponentially , the spatial @xmath12-factor geometry oscillates around the round unit @xmath36-sphere geometry and is therefore in particular bounded .",
    "all these models therefore violate the cosmic no - hair picture by these highly anisotropic asymptotics .",
    "we emphasize that our work here is _ not _ actually concerned with the _ instability of the nariai solution _ ; this issue is addressed elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the point of our work here is now to identify and describe inhomogeneous critical models and their nariai - like asymptotics _ all _ of which violate the cosmic no - hair paradigm .",
    "we remark that all our numerical studies were conducted with slight generalizations of the numerical code presented in @xcite .",
    "more details and references regarding our numerical infrastructure are given in section  [ sec : evolutionn ] .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec :",
    "setup ] , we discuss the general setup , i.e. , the formulation of einstein s equation in the presence of symmetries via _ geroch s symmetry reduction _ , our extraction of evolution equations with a well - posed initial value problem and of constraint equations from this , our numerical implementation and our particular family of initial data",
    ". section  [ sec : criticalnariai ] is devoted to our analytical and numerical studies .",
    "first we discuss our heuristic mode analysis which is the basis for all of what follows .",

    "we start by equipping the spatial manifold @xmath5 with coordinates @xmath37 where @xmath38 $ ] is the standard parameter on the @xmath39-factor and @xmath40 are standard polar coordinates on the @xmath41-factor . with respect to these",
    "coordinates it turns out that a spacetime with spatial @xmath5-topology is gowdy ( or @xmath42-)symmetric if the metric is invariant both under translations along the @xmath39-factor ( i.e. , is independent of @xmath7 ) , and , under rotations of the @xmath41-factor around the polar coordinate axis ( i.e. , is independent of @xmath43 ) .",
    "one can show that einstein s equations for this class of spacetimes can be formulated in almost exactly the same way as for the class of gowdy symmetric spacetimes with spatial @xmath44-topology which was discussed in detail in @xcite . because of the close similarity we shall refer to that paper for all the details and only give a quick summary of the necessary results now .",
    "when geroch s symmetry reduction @xcite is performed with respect to the gowdy killing vector fields @xmath45 for any @xmath46-dimensional gowdy - symmetric metric @xmath4 in a spacetime @xmath47 , one finds that einstein s vacuum field equations with cosmological constant imply the system @xmath48 on the @xmath49-manifold @xmath50 where @xmath51 is a metric on @xmath52 with signature @xmath53 , @xmath54 is its covariant derivative and @xmath55 is the corresponding ricci tensor .",

    "both metrics @xmath51 and @xmath72 will play a role in our discussion later .",
    "the system of equations takes care of only _ one _ of the two gowdy killing vector fields @xmath45 ( i.e. , translations along the spatial @xmath39-factor ) so far .",
    "it turns out that the second killing field @xmath73 prevails on @xmath52 , i.e. , all quantities @xmath51 , @xmath56 and @xmath61 on @xmath52 defined above are _ axi - symmetric _ and therefore invariant under the action of @xmath73 ( i.e. , under rotations around the polar coordinate axis of @xmath41 ) .",
    "we remark that one could perform geroch s symmetry reduction a second time , but now with respect to this killing field ( see also @xcite ) .",
