    "observations of starburst galaxies have found that relatively bright diffuse soft x - ray emission is always present ( e.g. * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "these regions of hot ( @xmath3 ) gas have been observed to extend far beyond the starburst itself . in starbursts located in edge - on disk galaxies , the emission",
    "can be traced many kpc out into the galactic halo .",
    "this diffuse x- ray emission is thought to be a prime manifestation of the effects of `` feedback '' from star formation",
    ". short lived massive stars in the starburst inject kinetic energy and highly metal - enriched gas into their surroundings through stellar winds and supernovae .",
    "the collective effect is to drive a galaxy - scale outflow known as a `` superwind '' @xcite out of the starburst and into the galaxy halo and perhaps beyond .",
    "these outflows could play a major role in the evolution of galaxies and the intergalactic medium ( igm ) .",
    "for example , by propelling metals out of star - forming galaxies , they could explain both the mass - metallicity relation of galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) and the presence of substantial amounts of metals in the intergalactic medium ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and in the intracluster medium ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "spectroscopy in the rest - frame ultraviolet has shown that starburst - driven outflows are a characteristic feature of starburst galaxies at high redshift @xcite . however , the best laboratories for studying the astrophysics of these winds are in local galaxies in which their complex multi - phase nature can be investigated in detail in the x - ray , ultraviolet , optical , and radio regimes ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "x - ray observations with high spatial resolution are particularly crucial , as they most directly trace the hot gas that powers the wind .    in recognition of this ,",
    "the _ chandra _ x - ray observatory has devoted significant amounts of time to the observation of starburst galaxies and their winds .",
    "the galaxies studied span a broad range from dwarf starbursts ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , to edge - on disk galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* b ) , to interacting and merging systems @xcite , to the ultra luminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "halos of diffuse x - ray emission are seen in all these types of starburst , and in many cases the properties of the hot gas have been shown to be consistent with the superwind model .",
    "however , investigations to date have mostly been of individual starburst systems , or ( in few cases ) of small samples of similar objects .",
    "the time is now ripe for an investigation that exploits the _ chandra _ archive to uniformly analyze the properties of the diffuse x - ray emission in starburst galaxies spanning the widest possible range in the properties of both the starburst itself and of its `` host '' galaxy . in the present paper ,",
    "we use _ chandra _ acis - s data to study the impact of starbursts in three distinct samples of starbursts : seven dwarf starbursts , six edge - on starburst galaxies of intermediate luminosity , and nine ulirgs . by combining the data from the three galaxy types we cover a range of roughly @xmath4 in x - ray luminosity , and several thousand in star formation rate and k - band luminosity ( a proxy for stellar mass ) .",
    "note that the edge - on starburst sample has been previously examined extensively in two papers by ( * ? ? ?",
    "the properties of the nuclear x - ray emission in the ulirgs have been discussed in @xcite .",
    "each of the three samples was selected to be complete and unbiased .",
    "the ulirg sample consists of the eight nearest such objects ( @xmath5 15,000 km / sec ) .",
    "following @xcite we have additionally included ngc 6240 , whose far - ir luminosity is just below the ulirg range .",
    "the members of the edge - on sample were selected to be the nearest ( closer than 20 mpc ) starbursts of intermediate far - ir luminosity ( @xmath6 few @xmath7 ) in moderately massive disk galaxies ( @xmath8 to @xmath9 ) viewed nearly edge - on ( inclinations greater than 60 degrees ) .",
    "this range in luminosity and mass is representative of typical infrared selected starbursts in the present universe .",
    "finally , our sample of dwarf starbursts includes the five brightest ( sum of ultraviolet plus far infrared flux ) starbursts in low mass galaxies ( @xmath10 below @xmath11 ) .",
    "we have added two similar galaxies he 2 - 10 and ngc 3077 .",
    "the samples are listed along with their most salient quantities in table [ lumin ] .",
    "the x - ray data for our sample is based on _ chandra _ acis - s observations of 22 galaxies . in order to obtain a consistent data sample we have reanalyzed these observations for all of the ulirgs  and all but one of the dwarf starbursts . for the edge - on starbursts we have used the luminosities , temperatures , and images derived in @xcite .",
    "these were created in manner similar to that described below for our analysis .",
    "the data and analysis for the dwarf starburst ngc 4214 was provided by @xcite . from their background subtracted image and exposure maps",
    "we have calculated the appropriate surface brightness and radial values .",
    "we have also used their derived flux and mekal temperature .",
    "exposure times , pointing information , and observation dates for all of the galaxies are summarized in table [ obsdata ] .    for our analysis ,",
    "data reprocessing and flare removal was done as described in the ciao threads from the cxc .",
    "ciao 3.01 with caldb 2.23 was used throughout the processing and analysis .",
    "the two observations of iras  05189 - 2524  were combined using the ciao task reproject_events .",
    "as the two observations are only separated by 3 months we have ignored differences in time dependent calibrations such as the acis optical blocking filter contamination .",
    "only data from the s3 chip has been included so we have not attempted any charge transfer inefficiency corrections .    to isolate the central sources in the ulirgs   we have split each observation into an inner ( nuclear ) and outer ( halo ) region . in @xcite 2-d elliptical gaussians",
    "were fit to the inner source of each ulirg .",
    "we have doubled the minor and major axis of the elliptical gaussian fits and used that to define our inner region ( table [ innerregion ] ) .",
    "the outer regions were manually chosen to include the rest of the galaxies extent ( from broad band smoothed images ) and exclude the central region .",
    "extraneous point sources detected by wavdetect are excluded from the regions during spectral extraction . for the dwarf starbursts",
    "we have defined a single region that includes all the x - ray emission from the galaxy and excludes all point sources .",
    "accurate background subtraction is important when studying diffuse x - ray emission .",
    "spatial , spectral , and time variations in the x - ray background complicate background analysis .",
    "therefore a region enclosing the entire s3 chip but excluding extended and point sources was defined for each observation .",
    "the count rate in these regions was then calculated over several energy bands and for the appropriate cxc - provided blank field datasets @xcite . if the count rates and spectral shapes were similar ( @xmath12 change )",
    "the blank field background was renormalized by the ratio of the background rates in the 4 - 7 kev range .",
    "the renormalized blank sky background was then used for both the spectral and image analysis .    the background rates for iras  05189 - 2524 , iras  17208 - 0014 , iras  23128 - 5919 , mkn231 , ngc 1705 , and ngc 5253 were all above normal quiescent levels even after solar flare removal .",
    "several of these observations were affected by extreme solar activity which multiply impacted chandra observations during october 2001 . due to the background spectral changes during periods of high solar activity it is inappropriate to rescale the quiescent blank field background datasets .",
    "we have therefore used local backgrounds for these observations .",
    "the local backgrounds are centered on the galaxies but exclude sources and the diffuse emission around the galaxy .",
    "this local background was then used for spectral background subtraction .",
    "the image background however was created by rescaling the blank field background images as described above for the galaxies with quiescent background levels .      using the renormalized quiescent background",
    ", background subtracted images were produced for every object in the sample .",
    "the images were created in a variety of energy bands and then adaptively smoothed using the ciao task csmooth .",
    "adaptively smoothed images for all of the ulirgs  and dwarf starbursts in the 0.3 - 8 kev energy band can be found in figures [ smoothulg ] and [ smoothdwarf ] . in order to create representative color images for every galaxy we first divided the 0.3 - 1.0 kev , 1.0 - 2.0 kev , and 2.0 - 8.0 kev images by the monoenergetic exposure map for each observation .",
    "the images were adaptively smoothed and combined into a single representative color image .    to derive the radial extent of the galaxies we focused on the 0.3 - 1.0",
    "kev background subtracted image .",
    "this energy range was chosen as it is dominated by the diffuse thermal emission .",
    "circular annuli starting at the galaxy center and radiating outward to the end of the diffuse x - ray emission were created for each observation . excluding all point sources except the central source , the number of counts in each annulus was extracted .",
    "the 50% , 75% , 90% , and 95% counts enclosed radii were then calculated ( table [ obsradii ] ) .",
    "the same annular regions were also used on an exposure map corrected image of the galaxy to calculate the surface brightness at the various radii .",
    "an isometric radius was defined as the radius that the surface brightness was @xmath13 . the agn ulirg  iras",
    "05189 - 2524  is essentially pointlike in the chandra observations .",
    "therefore we are unable to determine iras  05189 - 2524 s spatial extent and have not used it in our analyses of galaxy size and surface brightness .    in the previous analysis of edge - on starburst galaxies @xcite , distances and surface brightness computations",
    "are computed separately for both directions along the major and minor axis .",
    "as the other galaxies in our sample represent a variety of orientations we have reanalyzed the edge - on starburst data using the same simple radial geometry we used in analyzing the ulirgs  and dwarf starbursts above .",
    "spectra were extracted for all of our defined regions .",
    "after background subtraction the spectra were rebinned to a minimum of 20 counts per bin to allow use of the @xmath14  statistic . for every fit we have included galactic absorption and an acis contamination model @xcite .",
    "the galactic absorber column was fixed to the value obtained from colden using the nrao h  i dataset and found in table [ obsdata ] @xcite . allowing the absorption column to vary did not significantly improve fits and generally was consistent within one sigma of the colden value .",
    "the extracted spectra are plotted in figures [ agnulgspectra ] , [ ulgspectra ] , and [ dwarfspectra ] .",
    "a thermal component is clearly present in all but the lowest quality data .",
    "as our objective is to compare the global properties of our galaxies in a consistent manner , we have used a single thermal model in all of our fits ( vmekal in xspec ) .",
    "although there is strong evidence for spatial variations in temperature for several of our galaxies we have found generally , that a single thermal model adequately represents each galaxy s flux averaged properties . while other spectral models were examined , including two temperature models , intrinsically absorbed temperature models , and simpler thermal models",
    ", these models generally resulted in higher values of the reduced @xmath14 .",
    "as any thermal model would be a simplification of the true multi - temperature non - ionizational equilibrium physical conditions , we have used the simplest acceptable spectral fits throughout our analysis .",
    "this allows us to analyze all of the galaxies in as uniform manner as possible .",
    "this consistency is important when we compare the global properties of the x - ray gas throughout our sample .",
    "the vmekal model allows for variations in elemental abundances .",
    "however low signal to noise data and weak or unresolved emission lines make it impossible to constrain many of the elemental abundances .",
    "following @xcite we have therefore tied many of the weakly constrained abundances to other similarly evolving elements .",
    "mg , si , ne , s , and ar are then tied to o to form our @xmath2-element  abundance .",
    "we also tie the fe abundance to ni , ca , al , and na .",
    "ca has been included with the fe elements as it is similarly depleted onto dust grains and has a negligible contribution to the x - ray emission at these temperatures .",
    "although tied to other elements in the vmekal model , the fe and @xmath2 abundances are dominated by the contributions from fe and o respectively .",
    "the absolute @xmath2 and fe abundances are degenerate and relatively unconstrained for many of the galaxies .",
    "as we are primarily interested in @xmath2-element  enrichment relative to fe we have only listed the @xmath15  ratio for which we can derive limits .",
    "the spectra from the outer regions of the ulirgs  and most of the the dwarf starbursts have significantly less high energy ( @xmath16 ) emission than the inner regions of the ulirgs . for several",
    "there is no high energy emission detected . for this sample",
    "we have restricted our fits to only include the 0.3 - 3.0 kev energy band .",
    "a single thermal plasma ( vmekal ) model , without an additional powerlaw component , provides an excellent fit for the 8 ulirgs  with detectable outer region emission and 5 of the dwarf starbursts .",
    "fitting models to the outer regions of the ulirgs  is complicated by low number counts in several of the ulirgs . in the case of iras",
    "05189 - 2524  there are too few counts ( if any ) to attempt spectral fitting .",
    "the other eight ulirgs  do have detectable diffuse emission ranging from 76 counts above background in ugc  05101  to over 4100 counts for ngc  6240 .",
    "an absorbed powerlaw was required to fit the inner regions of the ulirgs  and the dwarf galaxies he 2 - 10 and ngc 4449 .",
    "the redshift of the absorption column was set to that of the host ulirgs  and the column density was allowed to vary freely . as the flux above 3.0 kev is dominated by the powerlaw emission we have fit these spectra in the 0.35 - 8.0 kev energy region .",
    "this allows a much more accurate determination of the powerlaw parameters .    in @xcite @xmath17  emission",
    "was strongly detected in ngc  6240 and mkn  273 .",
    "for the inner region in ngc  6240 we have added a gaussian component centered at 6.4 kev .",
    "this provides an excellent fit for the spectrum of ngc  6240 .",
    "the fit to the inner region of mkn  273 however is more complicated . to fit the @xmath17  line we have also added a gaussian .",
    "however we have found that an additional unabsorbed powerlaw is required .",
    "we have set the unabsorbed powerlaw to have the same slope as the absorbed powerlaw .",
    "the additional powerlaw is motivated by examining representative color images of mkn  273 . the central source is strongly absorbed along some lines of sight but not others .",
    "the final fit to mkn  273 gives us an acceptable reduced @xmath14@xmath18 .",
    "the inner spectra of iras  20551 - 4250  suggests the need for a multiple temperature model .",
    "although a two temperature model improves the reduced @xmath14  from 1.6 to 1.4 the derived parameters are not significantly affected .",
    "the derived flux weighted temperature from the two temperature model is consistent with the single temperature model .",
    "the powerlaw , redshifted hydrogen absorption column , @xmath15 , and flux are also found to be similar for both fits . for consistently with the other spectral fits we have used the results from the one temperature model for iras  20551 - 4250 .",
    "the set of spectral fitting parameters for both the inner and outer regions for all the ulirgs   and for the dwarf starbursts can be found in table [ spectra ] .      to characterize the basic properties of the starbursts and their host galaxies , we have assembled a combination of near - infrared ( k - band ) , far - infrared ( iras ) , and vacuum ultraviolet data from the literature ( see table [ lumin ] ) .",
    "we will use the near - ir luminosity as a rough tracer of the stellar mass of the galaxy , since the k - band mass - to - light ratio is only a weak function of the age of a stellar population ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we note however that this approximation may not be valid for all the ulirgs , in which the extremely high star formation rate and possible presence of an agn mean that the k - band light will not necessarily be dominated by the older stars that dominate the galaxy mass ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "in fact , the agn is known to dominate the k - band luminosity of mkn 231 , so we have dropped mkn 231 from our results involving its k - band luminosity .",
    "the k - band cousins - glass - johnson luminosities were derived for every galaxy in our sample using the 2mass large galaxy atlas @xcite .",
    "the k and j band fluxes given in the catalog were converted to k - band cgj using the transformations from @xcite .",
    "the bulk of the bolometric luminosity of the ulirgs and edge - on starbursts emerges in the far - infrared .",
    "@xcite argue that the hard x - ray properties of the ulirgs ( with the exception of the near - ulirg ngc  6240 ) do not support the idea that an agn makes a dominant contribution to the far - infrared luminosity .",
    "we will therefore use the far - infrared luminosity as a proxy for the star formation rate in the ulirgs and edge - on starbursts .",
    "the dwarf starbursts are substantially less dusty than the other two classes , and a significant amount of the starburst luminosity escapes in the uv . following @xcite",
    ", we will use the sum of the uv and far - infrared luminosities as a proxy for the star formation rate in the dwarf starburst .",
    "the _ iras _ fluxes @xcite and transformations from @xcite were used to calculate fir luminosities .",
    "note that no iras color correction term has been applied to our fir luminosities .",
    "the uv flux measurements we used have mean wavelengths in the range @xmath19 to @xmath20 .",
    "uv fluxes are defined as @xmath21 .",
    "the uv flux measurement for ngc 1569 comes from @xcite , for ngc 1705 from @xcite , for ngc 3077 from @xcite , for ngc 4214 and ngc 5253 from c.  hoopes ( private communication , based on uit observations ) , and for ngc 4449 and he 2 - 10 from ned ( based on oao and iue observations ) .",
    "the uv fluxes were corrected for foreground galactic extinction at the effective wavelength of the appropriate filter using the extinction law of @xcite and the values of the galactic optical extinction from @xcite .",
    "luminosities are listed in table  [ lumin ] .",
    "in this section we will compare the principal properties of the diffuse x - ray emission in our sample of dwarf starburst , edge - on starbursts , and ulirgs .",
    "we begin by comparing the structure and morphology of the diffuse x - ray emission and its morphological connection to the warm optically - emitting plasma .",
    "we will then examine how the size and luminosity of the source of diffuse emission scales with the luminosity ( the star formation rate ) of the starburst .",
    "finally , we will use the spectra to examine the thermal and chemical properties of the hot gas .      a simple visual comparison of the morphology suggests a similar physical origin for the diffuse x - ray emission in dwarf starbursts , starbursts , and ulirgs ( figure [ 3types ] ) .",
    "these three representative color images are very similar to one another , not only in morphology , but in `` color '' ( the broad - band x - ray spectral shape ) .",
    "although the physical scales differ by almost a factor of 50 from dwarf to ulirgs , it is difficult to separate these galaxies based on the morphology of their diffuse x - ray emission .",
    "the biggest visible difference is in the edge - on starburst galaxy ngc 3628 , but this is due to photoelectric absorption from the edge - on large scale ism of the galaxy ( i.e. it is simply an orientation effect ) .",
    "we can examine the structure of the diffuse x - ray emission by using the images to define its characteristic x - ray surface brightness .",
    "specifically , we have compared the mean surface brightness of the soft ( 0.3 - 1 kev ) x - ray emission interior to the radius enclosing 90% of the total soft x - ray flux .",
    "figure [ s90vlfir ] shows that this surface brightness is relatively constant over the almost four orders of magnitude of sfr spanned by our samples .",
    "a comparison of the diffuse x - ray and @xmath22  images also shows morphological relations between these two gas phases in all three images .",
    "this can be seen in in figure [ ha ] .",
    "although the x - ray images are adaptively smoothed and have a lower spatial resolution than the @xmath22  images , there is a relationship between the morphologies of the @xmath22  and diffuse x - ray emission in all three classes of galaxies . for every galaxy , including the ulirgs , in our sample where extended @xmath22  emission has been detected there is a qualitative physical correspondence in size and shape between the extended soft x - ray and @xmath22  emission .",
    "similarly , regions lacking in extended x - ray emission lack extended @xmath22  emission . because of the large distances of the ulirgs even x - ray observations with _",
    "chandra _ lack the spatial resolution to determine whether the soft x - ray and @xmath22  emission are correlated ( as seen in the edge - on spirals ngc 253 and ngc 3079 , @xcite ) or anti - correlated ( as seen in the dwarf starburst ngc 3077 , @xcite ) .",
    "our point is merely that the hot and warm ionized gaseous phases around these galaxies are physically related . in the superwind model ,",
    "the strong morphological connection between the x - ray and @xmath22  emission is most likely a consequence of the hydrodynamical interaction between the hot outflowing wind and ambient gas in the disk and halo of the galaxy ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we now examine how the basic physical properties of the diffuse x - ray emission ( luminosity and size ) scale with the fundamental properties of the starbursts and their host galaxies ( luminosity , mass ) .    to do so , we have compiled information about the x - ray emission for different spatial regions in each galaxy type . for reference , for the ulirgs  we have previously defined inner and outer regions . for the edge - on starbursts we have three regions , nucleus , disk , and halo @xcite . the dwarf starbursts however have only a single spatial region which includes the entire galaxy .",
    "this variety of spatial regions complicates comparison between the galaxy types .",
    "an additional issue is that some regions also include powerlaw components in the x - ray spectral fits .    for simplicity",
    ", we have just added the total luminosities of the thermal component in each region together to get the total luminosity of the hot gas for each galaxy . to obtain an average gas temperature",
    "we have luminosity - averaged the temperatures of the separate spatial regions .    in figure [ lxrayvslfir ]",
    "we have plotted the thermal x - ray luminosity versus far infrared luminosity ( including the uv luminosity for the dwarfs ) . as the fir luminosity is proportional to the star formation rate",
    ", we see a correlation between the thermal x - ray emission and the star formation rate . while the good correlation between star formation rate and x - ray luminosity has been widely noted ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , our result differs from these in that we have isolated the x - ray emission due to hot diffuse gas ( excluding the contribution to the total x - ray luminosity from x - ray binaries and -in some cases- agn ) .    on the right side of figure [ lxrayvslfir ]",
    "we also show the ratio of the thermal x - ray luminosity to the far infrared luminosity , so that we could examine the relation more closely . over nearly four orders - of - magnitudes of far infrared luminosity ,",
    "this ratio is roughly constant ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "quantitatively , we find a scatter of 0.38 dex for the x - ray luminosity / fir luminosity ratio .",
    "the rate at which a starburst generates mechanical energy is about 1% of its bolometric luminosity ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "figure [ lxrayvslfir ] thus implies that typically only about 1% of the mechanical energy is lost in the form of x - ray emission from hot gas .",
    "this fraction evidently does not depend on the star formation rate itself .",
    "note that in figure [ lxrayvslfir ] we have separately color encoded those ulirgs  having agn ( based on their optical emission line properties ) .",
    "see @xcite for details .",
    "apart from the `` nearly - a - ulirg '' ngc6240 ( in which an agn likely contributes to the soft x - ray emission ) , the agn ulirgs  have ratios of thermal x - ray to fir luminosities that are similar to the other ulirgs , edge - on starbursts , and dwarf starbursts .",
    "the correlation between fir and thermal x - ray luminosities is not simply an artifact of plotting luminosity vs. luminosity ( e.g. bigger galaxies have more of everything ) . in figure [ div_l_k ]",
    "we have divided both the thermal x - ray and fir luminosities by the k - band luminosity . by renormalizing this way",
    ", we see a clear correlation between the sfr per unit galaxy stellar mass and the thermal x - ray luminosity per unit mass .",
    "the size of the x - ray emitting region is also closely correlated with both the fir and k - band luminosities .",
    "we have plotted the 90% flux enclosed radii vs luminosities in figure [ r90 ] .",
    "a correlation analysis using kendall s @xmath24 rank order correlation coefficient finds the probability of a spurious correlation of @xmath25 for the fir to 90% flux enclosed x - ray radii and @xmath26 for the k - band . therefore both the k - band and fir luminosity",
    "are strongly correlated to the size of the x - ray emitting region .",
    "the k - band relationship is marginally stronger than that in the fir .",
    "this relation was seen in the starburst sample by @xcite .",
    "we conclude that although the host galaxy affects the spatial extent of the x - ray emission , the power of the x - ray emission is determined primarily by the star formation rate .",
    "the spectral degeneracy of the @xmath2 and fe abundances in the vmekal models makes it difficult to determine their absolute abundances .",
    "however , we are able to determine @xmath15  ratios for the majority of the ulirgs  and dwarf starbursts ( table [ spectra ] )",
    ". taken as a whole we find clear evidence of enhanced @xmath15  ratios relative to solar abundances . excluding a few measurements with extremely large errors we find a fairly constant ratio of about @xmath27 across the sample .",
    "we find this enrichment even in the outer halos of the ulirgs .",
    "similar results have been previously noticed in other starbursting galaxies ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "the enhanced @xmath15  ratios in the diffuse x - ray emission would be expected if the x - ray emitting gas has been significantly enriched by the metals returned by the starburst s supernovae .",
    "it is also possible that the subsolar ratio is caused by significant depletion of fe onto dust grains in the hot gas .",
    "we have previously concluded that star formation rate is correlated with the x - ray luminosity .",
    "this suggests that the gas mass transported by the outflow is determined by the mechanical energy supplied by the supernovae and stellar winds .",
    "however the gas temperature might be affected by other factors . to test this ,",
    "we have plotted the @xmath28 relation for our sample in figure [ kt ] .",
    "the luminosity - weighted mean temperatures are @xmath6 0.3 to 0.7 kev , with no strong correlation between x - ray luminosity and gas temperature .",
    "it does appear that the ulirgs as a class tend to preferentially occupy the high end of this temperature range .",
    "there are reasons to suggest this is not caused by contamination from the nuclear sources in the ulirgs .",
    "first , the halos of the ulirgs  also have higher gas temperatures even at large physical distances from the nuclear sources . and second",
    ", the ulirgs  with the lowest gas temperature is iras  05189 - 2524 .",
    "as it is the most agn - dominated of the ulirgs , it provides a counterexample to attributing the higher gas temperatures to agn contamination .",
    "also , as the outer halos are well fit by just a thermal model it is also probably not caused by a biased fit due to unresolved point sources in the outer regions of the ulirgs .",
    "one physical difference between the ulirgs and the other starbursts ( apart from simply their larger star formation rates ) , is their larger star formation rates per unit area inside the starburst .",
    "the star formation rate per unit area in starbursts is known to be a key parameter in determining the observed properties of their superwinds @xcite . as shown by @xcite the luminosity - weighted dust temperature ( as probed by the ratio of iras 60 and 100 @xmath29 m fluxes ) correlates strongly with the star formation rate per unit area in starbursts .",
    "a comparison of the dust temperature and the luminosity averaged temperatures of the x - ray emitting gas appears in figure [ f60o100vkt ] .",
    "kendall s tau statistic shows a rough correlation does exist which a chance of being spurious of less than @xmath30 .",
    "we begin by summarizing our primary conclusions , and then briefly discuss their implications .",
    "our general conclusion is that the properties of the diffuse thermal x - ray emission in starbursts are remarkably homogeneous and follow simple scaling relations over ranges of nearly four orders - of - magnitude in x - ray luminosity and over three orders - of - magnitude in sfr and galaxy mass . more specifically :    * the soft x - ray morphology is independent of the star formation rate , and the same morphological relationship between the hot x - ray emitting gas and warm optical line emission is seen in the dwarf starbursts , the edge - on starbursts , and the ulirgs . *",
    "the x - ray luminosity is linearly proportional to the star formation rate ( estimated from the sum of the far - ir and uv luminosity ) .",
    "this simple scaling holds between the star formation rate and x - ray luminosity when both are normalized by the galaxy mass , so it is not simply a matter of big galaxies having more of everything . *",
    "the characteristic surface brightness of the diffuse thermal x - ray emission ( defined as the mean surface brightness interior to the radius enclosing 90% of the flux ) occupies a relatively narrow range and is independent of the star formation rate . *",
    "the characteristic size of the diffuse x - ray emission ( the radius enclosing 90% of the flux ) increases systematically with increasing star formation rate . these radii range from @xmath60.5 to 2 kpc in the dwarf starbursts , to 3 to 10 kpc in the edge - on starbursts , to 5 to 30 kpc in the ulirgs .",
    "however , the correlation of this size is slightly stronger with k - band luminosity ( a proxy for galaxy mass ) than with the star formation rate . *",
    "the emission - weighted mean temperature of the diffuse x - ray is @xmath1 0.25 to 0.75 kev .",
    "there is a tendency for the ulirgs to occupy the high end of this range ( above @xmath60.6 kev ) . *",
    "the ratio of the abundances of the @xmath2-elements to fe in the diffuse gas is several times the solar value , with no dependence on star formation rate .",
    "these results strongly support the idea that the diffuse thermal x - ray emission in starburst galaxies has a common physical origin . in particular , we can briefly discuss the above results in the context of the model of a galactic superwind driven by the collective energy input from supernovae and stellar winds in the starburst .",
    "the dynamical evolution of a starburst - driven outflow has been extensively discussed ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "briefly , the deposition of mechanical energy by supernovae and stellar winds results in an over - pressured cavity of hot gas inside the starburst .",
    "this hot gas will expand , sweep up ambient material and thus develop a bubble - like structure .",
    "if the ambient medium is stratified ( like a disk ) , the superbubble will expand most rapidly in the direction of the vertical pressure gradient .",
    "after the superbubble size reaches several disk vertical scale heights , the expansion will accelerate , and it is believed that raleigh - taylor instabilities will then lead to the fragmentation of the bubble s outer wall ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this allows the hot gas to `` blow out '' of the disk and into the galactic halo in the form of a weakly collimated bipolar outflow .",
    "the strong morphological relationship between the x - ray and optical emission in galactic winds has led to a picture in which both trace the collision of the wind with denser ambient material in the disk and halo of the starburst galaxy .",
    "the simplest picture is one in which the optical line emission is produced by a shock driven into the ambient gas by the wind , and the x - rays arise in the `` reverse shock '' in the wind where its kinetic energy is transformed to thermal energy and its density increases ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this picture is consistent with the results summarized above .",
    "the proportionality of the x - ray luminosity and star formation rate simply means that a roughly constant fraction ( @xmath61% ) of the kinetic energy supplied by the starburst is converted into soft x - ray emission in the wind / cloud shocks .",
    "this is consistent with the simplest relevant theoretical model of a galactic wind , namely a spherically symmetric wind - blown bubble in which the ratio of the x - ray to mechanical energy input is given by @xmath31 @xcite . here",
    "@xmath32 is the rate of mechanical energy injection in units of @xmath33 erg / s ( characteristic of edge - on starbursts ) , @xmath34 is the ambient particle density ( @xmath35 ) , and @xmath36 is the age of the bubble in units of @xmath37 years .",
    "the lack of a strong dependence of temperature on star formation rate implies that the wind s dynamics are relatively insensitive to the star formation rate .",
    "note that @xmath38 0.25 to 0.75 kev corresponds to shock speeds of @xmath6 450 to 800 km / s .",
    "if these speeds are identified with that of the wind fluid , then that implies that the wind is strongly `` mass - loaded '' . this is consistent with the modest enhancements seen in the abundance ratio of the @xmath2-elements relative to iron , since this ratio would be boosted by the contribution from the core - collapse supernovae that drive the wind ( e.g. *",
    "* ) .    finally , since the x - ray emission traces the interaction between the wind and the halo / ism , its size should be related both the size / mass of the galaxy and to the star formation rate ( a higher star formation rate leads to a wind with more kinetic energy which can plough its way further into the gaseous halo of the starburst galaxy ) .    in summary , we believe that not only are our the results consistent with the expectations for galactic superwinds , they also provide an important benchmark against which increasingly detailed and more physically realistic hydrodynamically simulations of galactic superwinds can be judged .    lccccccccc + & & inner & outer + arp 220 & & @xmath39 & @xmath40 & & & @xmath41 & 0.92 & @xmath42 + iras 05189 - 2524 & & @xmath43 & & & & @xmath44 & 0.82 & @xmath45 + iras 17208 - 0014 & & @xmath46 & @xmath47 & & & @xmath48 & 0.89 & @xmath49 + iras 20551 - 4250 & & @xmath50 & @xmath51 & & & @xmath52 & 1.28 & @xmath53 + iras 23128 - 5919 & & @xmath50 & @xmath50 & & & @xmath54 & 0.98 & @xmath55 + mkn 231 & & @xmath56 & @xmath57 & & & @xmath58 & 1.06 & @xmath59 + mkn 273 & & @xmath60 & @xmath61 & & & @xmath62 & 1.02 & @xmath63 + ngc 6240 & & @xmath61 & @xmath64 & & & @xmath65 & 0.57 & @xmath66 + ugc05101 & & @xmath67 & @xmath68 & & & @xmath69 & 1.11 & @xmath66 +   + & & nucleus & disk & halo + ngc 253 & & @xmath70 & @xmath71 & @xmath72 & & @xmath73 & 0.5 & @xmath74 + ngc 1482 & & @xmath75 & @xmath76 & @xmath75 & & @xmath77 & 0.7 & @xmath78 + m 82 & & @xmath76 & @xmath76 & @xmath79 & & @xmath80 & 0.97 & @xmath81 + ngc 3079 & & @xmath82 & @xmath83 & @xmath84 & & @xmath77 & 0.49 & @xmath85 + ngc 3628 & & @xmath86 & @xmath87 & @xmath88 & & @xmath89 & 0.48 & @xmath90 + ngc 4631 & & @xmath91 & @xmath92 & @xmath93 & & @xmath94 & 0.4 & @xmath95 +   + & & all + he 2 - 10 & & @xmath96 & & & & @xmath97 & 0.91 & @xmath98 + ngc 1705 & & @xmath99 & & & & @xmath100 & 0.38 & @xmath101 + ngc 1569 & & @xmath102 & & & & @xmath103 & 0.96 & @xmath104 + ngc 3077 & & @xmath99 & & & & @xmath105 & 0.54 & @xmath100 + ngc 4214 & & @xmath106 & & & & @xmath107 & 0.62 & @xmath108 + ngc 4449 & & @xmath109 & & & & @xmath110 & 0.49 & @xmath111 + ngc 5253 & & @xmath112 & & & & @xmath113 & 0.97 & @xmath114    lrllllll +   + iras 05189 - 2524 & 05 21 01.5 & -25 21 45 & 200 & 0.82 & 10/30/2001 & 5.3 & 1.93 + & & & & & 01/30/2002 & 13.1 + ugc 05101 & 09 35 51.6 & + 61 21 11 & 185 & 0.76 & 05/28/2001 & 46.4 & 2.68 + mkn 231 & 12 56 14.2 & + 56 52 25 & 200 & 0.82 & 10/19/2000 & 25.3 & 1.25 + mkn 273 & 13 44 42.1 & + 55 53 13 & 176 & 0.74 & 04/19/2000 & 38.8 & 1.09",

    "<S> we have analyzed observations with the chandra x - ray observatory of the diffuse emission by hot gas in 7 dwarf starburst galaxies , 6 edge - on starburst galaxies , and 9 ultra luminous infrared galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> these systems cover ranges of @xmath0 in x - ray luminosity and several thousand in star formation rate and k - band luminosity ( a proxy for stellar mass ) . despite this range in fundamental parameters , we find that the properties of the diffuse x - ray emission are very similar in all three classes of starburst galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> the spectrum of the diffuse emission is well fit by thermal emission from gas with @xmath1 0.25 to 0.8 kev and with several - times - solar abundance ratios of @xmath2 elements to fe . </S>",
    "<S> the ratio of the thermal x - ray to far - infrared luminosity is roughly constant , as is the characteristic surface brightness of the diffuse x - ray emission . </S>",
    "<S> the size of the diffuse x - ray source increases systematically with both far - infrared and k - band luminosity . </S>",
    "<S> all three classes show strong morphological relationships between the regions of hot gas probed by the diffuse x - ray emission and the warm gas probed by optical line emission . </S>",
    "<S> these findings suggest that the same physical mechanism is producing the diffuse x - ray emission in the three types of starbursts , and are consistent with that mechanism being shocks driven by a galactic `` superwind '' powered by the kinetic energy collectively supplied by stellar winds and supernovae in the starburst . </S>"
