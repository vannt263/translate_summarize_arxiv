    "with their proximity , their unextinguished lines of sight , and their profuse star formation , the magellanic clouds are some of the best extragalactic objects in which to study the relationship between molecules and star formation .",
    "because the interstellar medium ( ism ) in the magellanic clouds is deficient in heavy elements and dust , molecular observations of these objects probe an interesting regime , perhaps more similar to the conditions in early protogalaxies rather than those prevalent today in the milky way .",
    "indeed , studies of active , metal ",
    "poor , nearby dwarf galaxies such as the magellanic clouds should offer insight into the processes at work in primeval sources .    )  maps obtained toward our detected sources in the lmc / smc .",
    "the coordinates of the central positions of the maps ( offsets 0,0 ) are listed in table 1 .",
    "the contours are logarithmically spaced , starting at 1.5 k  km  s@xmath2  and increasing by factors of 1.3 ( except for n  79 , n  83a , n  113 , and n  159w , where they start at 2.5 k  km  s@xmath2 ) .",
    "these maps were produced by convolving the data with a gaussian of fwhm=1 .",
    "most maps are sampled on a 30  grid , except for n  48 and n  55a where the grid spacing used was 60 .",
    "the positions marked by the crosses are those of the co ( @xmath3)sources , where we measured the intensities used in the lvg analysis . [ maps ] ]    what are the effects of low metallicities on the star  forming molecular ism ? we know that molecules are more difficult to form both in the gas phase ( less o , c , and n ) and on grain surfaces ( fewer grains ) , and that they are easier to destroy ( diminished dust shielding of the uv radiation ) in low metallicity environments .",
    "thus , molecules other than @xmath4 are more rare in these sources which in particular translates into a dearth of co emission in the magellanic clouds and other dwarf irregulars ( e.g. , israel et al . , 1986 ; israel , tacconi & baas 1995 , taylor , kobulnicky , & skillman 1998 ; leroy et al . 2005 ) . furthermore , because the fir and submillimeter lines of the different forms of carbon and oxygen ( c@xmath5 , c , o , and co ) dominate the cooling of the star  forming ism ( e.g. , le bourlot et al .",
    "1993 ; wolfire et al .",
    "1995 ) , the lower abundances of these elements will make the cooling of the molecular gas less efficient .",
    "however , at the same time smaller dust  to  gas ratios will yield lower heating of the molecular gas , as photoelectric ejection of electrons from small dust grains is the chief mode by which starlight heats the gas phase of the ism .",
    "if molecular gas temperatures were considerably affected by the metallicity of the ism , we expect important consequences for star formation in such environments .",
    "in particular , if the jeans criterion is relevant to star ",
    "formation , the mass of collapsable clouds grows for decreasing metallicity as the jeans mass increases @xmath6 .",
    "such change could have important effects on the initial mass function of stars in these systems .",
    "to a first approximation , models suggest that lowering the metallicity causes a similar decrement in both heating ( by diminishing the dust  to  gas ratio ) and cooling ( by diminishing the c and o abundances ; wolfire et al .",
    "1995 ) .",
    "it is important to realize , however , that there are many possibilities likely to complicate this simple picture .",
    "for example , if the dust  to  gas ratio were to decrease faster than the metallicity ( as suggested by lisenfeld & ferrara 1998 ) , or if there were a lack of very small dust grains in the low metallicity ism ( as suggested by the faintness of the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon emission observed toward some of these sources ; e.g. , madden 2000 ) , the heating processes may become less efficient and the balance may be shifted toward lower temperatures . furthermore , because it is also necessary to consider the metallicity threshold below which hitherto secondary heat sources ( e.g. , chemical heating ) become important , the effects of metallicity on the heating and cooling balance of molecular clouds are very difficult to address from a purely theoretical approach .    answering some of these questions observationally requires studying the physical conditions of the molecular gas in nearby , low metallicity sources .",
    "at distances of 55 and 63 kpc , the proximity of the magellanic clouds affords single  dish millimeter ",
    "wave observations excellent spatial resolution attainable in other galaxies only through the use of interferometers , which permits detailed studies of individual clouds instead of ensemble properties .",
    "in particular , the ability to spatially separate the emission from different regions makes the magellanic clouds ideal targets to study the excitation of the molecular gas and its relationship with star formation .",
    "multitransition studies of co and other molecules are very useful tools to determine the physical conditions of the h@xmath7 ( e.g. , johansson et al .",
    "1998 ; heikkil 1998 ; chin et al . 1998",
    "; heikkil et al .",
    "1999 ) , but their application is limited if there is no information on the intensities of the higher co transitions , which are extremely sensitive to density and temperature .",
    "because of their southern declination , however , there is a dearth of submillimeter observations of the clouds .",
    "we present here a survey of  ( @xmath0 )  in the molecular peaks of the magellanic clouds , and the results of an excitation analysis using these and lower @xmath8 observations .",

    "<S> we present the first survey of submillimeter  ( @xmath0 )  emission in the magellanic clouds . </S>",
    "<S> the survey is comprised of 15 @xmath1 maps obtained using the ast / ro telescope toward the molecular peaks of the large and small magellanic clouds . </S>",
    "<S> we have used these data to constrain the physical conditions in these objects , in particular their molecular gas density and temperature . </S>",
    "<S> we find that there are significant amounts of molecular gas associated with most of these molecular peaks , and that high molecular gas temperatures are pervasive throughout our sample . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss whether this may be due to the low metallicities and the associated dearth of gas coolants in the clouds , and conclude that the present sample is insufficient to assert this effect . </S>"
