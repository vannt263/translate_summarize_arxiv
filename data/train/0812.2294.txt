    "the sun s 22-year cycle of activity is most clearly seen in solar surface magnetic fields ( see for example the review by for a good discussion of the solar dynamo and solar magnetic fields ) .",
    "although the sunspot number ( ssn ) is the most readily available indicator of the state of the solar cycle , the magnetic fields over the whole surface provide a more complete measure of the dynamo process .",
    "a variety of questions arise in using the surface magnetic fields to study the solar cycle  which fields are most important , the weak general field or the strong field and associated sunspots , how do the field strengths change over various time scales from instabilities with changes in seconds or less to trends lasting many decades .",
    "the connection between photospheric magnetic fields and magnetic fields near earth or at interplanetary spacecraft requires knowledge of the field strength at the solar surface .",
    "is the overall strength of the magnetic field stationary or does it have any multi - decade trends ( cf : ) ?",
    "these surface fields are also needed to calculate the strength measured by interplanetary spacecraft such as _ ulysses _ @xcite .",
    "the topology of the field in the solar surface regions introduces additional uncertainty since the field of one polarity lower in the atmosphere may be canceled by the opposite polarity before it can emerge into the corona and heliosphere @xcite .",
    "questions such as these involving magnetic field strength can only be addressed when we are confident in the quantitative interpretation of the measured quantity .    the 150-foot solar tower telescope on mt .",
    "wilson has been dedicated to the synoptic measurement of solar surface magnetic fields using a babcock magnetograph observing the fe i spectral line at @xmath0 .",
    "although other spectral lines and observing techniques offer advantages over these choices , the uniformity of the data set extending back to 1967 is a strong reason to leave the observing system as nearly unaltered as possible .",
    "the application of these data to modeling the heliospheric magnetic field then depends on our ability to understand how to interpret the magnetograms .",
    "an early step toward this goal was carried out by and subsequently extended by and using a cross - correlation of fields observed simultaneously from two or more pairs of spectral samples .",
    "a compelling feature of the scatter diagrams from these simultaneous measurements is the linearity between the magnetic fields obtained from the different spectral samplings .",
    "each spectral sample measures a different altitude in the solar atmosphere and is influenced by different thermal properties of the atmosphere at that altitude . if the altitude dependent part of the relationship were also to depend on the field strength at each point on the solar surface , the scatter diagram would not be confined to a straight - line band passing through the zero - zero point . the observed straight line distributions found on the scatter diagram establish that variable filling factor is the only cause for varying field strength , all flux tubes being essentially identical .",
    "the fact that the slope is not unity can be used to study the altitude dependence of the flux tubes .    throughout this paper",
    "we will use the term `` magnetic field strength '' and usually mean the apparent field strength which is the product of a flux tube field strength and a filling factor .",
    "this quantity is actually the magnetic flux per unit area and is the quantity we wish to measure .",
    "the extensive literature devoted to the determination of the flux tube fields and the filling factors is of interest to us and is referenced where appropriate below .",
    "however , questions of flux tube physics are of secondary importance to our objectives in this paper .",
    "where the flux tube field strength is discussed , it is made explicit .",
    "otherwise , the term magnetic field strength should be read to mean the magnetic flux per unit area as measured in the observed pixels .",
    "the essential step in our study of magnetic field strength is the choice of a comparison line .",
    "our objective is to learn the relationship between measured circular polarization of a relatively large pixel ( 12 arcseconds squared or 20 arcseconds squared ) and the magnetic flux in that area .",
    "we are less concerned with questions of the structure of magnetic flux tubes or the strength of the field within the flux tubes  we only seek to learn the best way to estimate the product of the filling factor and the magnetic field in the flux tubes .",
    "in addition , we need to be able to observe the line simultaneously with @xmath0 . for this purpose the line at @xmath2  is ideally suited due to its large width and depth and due to the good linearity of its line wings . for a related objective of determining the flux tube magnetic field strength the comparison line chosen by",
    "was @xmath11  to take advantage of the fact that the two lines have differing @xmath12 values but very similar thermal response and line formation properties .",
    "however in both this paper and the subsequent study by the reference to @xmath2 was retained with the assumption that magnetic fluxes from this line are obtained directly from the polarization factors and the line profile .",
    "an interesting citation to a private communication by livingston in this last paper suggests that the magnetic fields derived from @xmath2  depend on position within this line .",
    "we verify below that the deduced magnetic field strength for any particular area on the sun s surface that depends on the spectral sampling of @xmath2 .",
    "our previous results based on @xmath2  yielded a correction factor of 4.5 to be applied as a multiplier for the magnetic fields obtained from @xmath0  whereas found only a factor of two .",
    "our correction factor is larger due partly to the fact that the shifted zeeman components at @xmath0  are shifted beyond the sampling pass - band of the mwo babcock magnetograph .",
    "we refer to the reduced apparent field due to the large line shift as the `` classical saturation effect '' since it depends only on the actual line profile , the strength of the flux tube magnetic fields and the spectral resolution of the observing system .",
    "as a first step in establishing a more complete understanding of the scale factors relating different observing methodologies we have carried out a new series of observations utilizing simultaneous magnetic field measurements with six different spectral configurations .",
    "the mwo system integrates all spectral channels continuously with all integrator registers being emptied sequentially at a rate of 40 hz . due to this feature of the system image motion and smearing",
    "affects all spectral samples identically so that the spatial average of spatial inhomogenieties is also identical",
    ". thus ratios of magnetic fields calculated from different sampling pairs yield relative magnetic fields from identical solar surface structures . starting with the concept that the magnetic field from @xmath2  indicates the true magnetic flux",
    ", the ratio @xmath13 should be the scale factor that converts the mwo synoptic program magnetic fields to the appropriate value emerging from the photospheric layers .",
    "for the actual observations we need to specify the spectral sampling as well as the spectral line .",
    "the study by used @xmath14m  and @xmath15m  to yield the scale factor of 4.5 .",
    "contrary to the assumptions of , and we find that the field measured by @xmath2  depends on the spectral sampling so that we must generalize the notation .",
    "we do this by defining a new quantity @xmath16 which relates the magnetic field for the spectral line at wavelength @xmath17 having spectral sampling offset by @xmath18 to the magnetic field for the spectral line at wavelength @xmath19 having spectral sampling of @xmath20 with @xmath17 and @xmath19 in ngstroms and @xmath18 and @xmath20 in m .",
    "thus we write : @xmath21 so that the previously defined @xmath4 is : @xmath22 the fact that the magnetic field derived from @xmath2  depends on the sampling separation is not a surprise in view of the complexity of the atmospheric flux tube structure but it does present us with the additional task of determining which portion of this line is most appropriate as an indicator of the emergent magnetic flux .    during the interval 18 april 2007 to 8",
    "may 2007 a set of five special magnetograms were obtained using the 24-channel system described by with the blue , 10-channel fiberoptic reformattor centered on @xmath2  instead of the @xmath23  line of nad .",
    "this configuration provided us with five line pairs having separations of @xmath24m .",
    "the observations in 1992 were made using a different spectrograph configuration wherein the spectral line sampling was at @xmath25m .",
    "the sampling of @xmath0  was left as in the synoptic program at @xmath26m . during the scanning process",
    "the light entering the spectrograph is unfiltered .",
    "the dispersed light passes through narrow - band blocking filters where it falls on all spectral sampling pickups simultaneously .",
    "the output currents from all photomultiplier tubes are summed individually and simultaneously into a set of registers .",
    "we refer to the sequence from the entry window of a single spectral sample to the summing register as a channel .",
    "the final digitization numbers for all channels for each pixel then originate from identical portions of the solar surface even though the sampled area is not precisely defined by the entrance aperture due to distortions of the solar image by the earth s atmosphere .",
    "we compute magnetic fields from each spectral sampling pair and compare the derived fields in a scatter - diagram format . since we expect the interrelationships to depend on position within the solar image , we restrict the scatter diagrams to pixels having a specified range in center - to - limb angle @xmath5 .",
    ".the correlation slopes @xmath27 and their errors as a function of @xmath20 and @xmath28 . [ cols=\"<,>,<,>,<,>,<,>,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     to investigate the properties of the stokes @xmath3 profiles and deduced magnetic field strengths based on such profiles , 23 line scan sets were obtained over a period of several months during the declining phase of solar cycle 23 .",
    "we use observations obtained between june and august 2007 . at this stage of the solar cycle ,",
    "the number of active regions available for study is limited .",
    "the observing system is that described by and utilized the 10-channel fiber - optic reformatter normally used for magnetograms in the @xmath29 line of sodium ( see for the details of the spectral sampling ) . with this system",
    "we obtain spectral line profiles from a square selected by our entrance aperture which has sides of 12 arc - sec ( other apertures are available but were not used in this study ) .",
    "this entrance aperture tracks solar rotation using the nominal differential rotation rate for the position observed . at the final spectrograph",
    "focus the spectrum is sampled by one of four sets of fiber - optic image reformatters that are carried on two independently movable stages .",
    "a small portion of the solar spectrum including the target spectral line is scanned by moving its stage alternately redward and blueward over the solar spectrum repeatedly for a total duration of 20 minutes with each scan requiring 20 seconds .",
    "the second stage is left stationary and its output is used to remove sky transparency fluctuations .",
    "the length of each scan is 1  and the spectral output from each fiber is sampled at an interval of 5.31m  ( the spectral resolution is about 30m ) .",
    "the temporal resolution was not used and all scans were summed to a single profile for each spectral pickup .",
    "finally the ten profiles were shifted by the known fiber - optic separation so that all are superposed for a single final profile .",
    "the offset between the fiber - optic inputs means that the portion of the spectrum scanned is also offset .",
    "the overall scan length was large enough that all ten inputs covered the range of interest for comparison to the magnetogram scatter diagram results .",
    "the circular polarization modulation was retained to permit the calculation of a single stokes @xmath3 profile . following the convention described by the blue shifted component",
    "is left circularly polarized in a positive magnetic field region .",
    "although we retain knowledge of the polarity of each set of line profiles , we do not consider the sign of the field to be important in this application and present the stokes @xmath3 parameter and the derived magnetic fields as if all polarities are positive .",
    "table [ t2 ] gives the parameters for these scans including the nominal magnetic field strength based on the line bisectors for a bisector width @xmath30 of @xmath31m .",
    "the line scan set numbers given in table  [ t2 ] are not sequential because a number of line scan sets for @xmath0  were also obtained during this time frame and these observations will be discussed in a future publication .",
    "the stokes @xmath3 profiles from the observations summarized in table  [ t2 ] are shown in figure  [ f5a ] .",
    "the scale of the stokes @xmath3 plots is based on a continuum @xmath32 of unity .",
    "the discussion in the following sections emphasizes the set of line scans from july 13 , 2007 since that region was more highly magnetized than was the case for subsequent observations .",
    "the apparent noise for the low field strength stokes @xmath3 profiles comes from a combination of factors including photon noise and the formation of interference fringes by filters , windows and other plane - parallel optics in the system .",
    "we have mitigated these residual fringes by tilting the blocking filter but the effect is not eliminated by this technique .",
    "we estimate the uncertainty in the stokes @xmath3 profile over the spectral range needed for the field determination is @xmath33 .",
    "the line slope is @xmath34(m)@xmath35 at the points @xmath31m  from line center so that the zeeman shift error due to this noise is about @xmath36m  for an estimated uncertainty in the field strength of 0.1 gauss as observed by the channel at @xmath37 .",
    "we can also estimate the photon noise error in the deduced magnetic field using measurements from the normal synoptic program magnetograms .",
    "the integration time for each magnetogram pixel is 0.127 seconds while the integration time on each pixel in the spectral scans is very similar at 0.1 seconds .",
    "the final profile information is the result of combining scans from all 10 fiber - optic reformattor channels and from all 60 scans .",
    "thus the relative photon noise for each line profile point compared to the synoptic program magnetograms should be reduced by a factor of @xmath38 .",
    "the line scanning process provides four times as many spectral points compared to the magnetogram leading to a further reduction of 2 in the expected photon noise . according to the discussion of section  [ scat ] ,",
    "the gaussian width from the magnetograph distribution function is 4 gauss for the above spectral channel so that again we arrive at an estimate of 0.1 gauss for the spectral scans . for observations with the synoptic program channel at @xmath0",
    "the equivalent error would be 0.025 gauss .",
    "these errors are substantially lower than has been previously reported and allow us to study the magnetic fields in regions that would normally be classified as unmagnetized .      for this section",
    ", we exclusively use the profile sequence number 022 of july 13 , 2007 to illustrate different ways of interpreting the profiles .",
    "figure [ f6 ] compares the quiet and plage profiles .",
    "the two states of circular polarization are combined for the low magnetization profile but separated for the magnetized case .",
    "because we are not concerned here with doppler shifts , the low magnetization line has been shifted so its bisector position coincides with the average bisector position for the two magnetized components at a bisector half - width @xmath30 of 75 m .",
    "this parameter measures the product of the filling factor and the flux tube field strength and represents the magnetic flux emerging from the pixel .",
    "not only do the two circularly polarized line profiles differ significantly from the quiet sun profile , they also differ from each other in such a way as to yield a magnetic flux which depends on position within the profile .",
    "the strength of this line and its high altitude of formation at line core make it difficult to attribute this effect to typical flux tube physics where thermal effects can produce line weakening or strengthening relative to the surrounding quiet atmosphere .",
    "clearly then this spectral line does not define a single magnetic flux and our problem becomes that of deciding how to interpret the observations in such a way as to find the best estimate of the magnetic flux emerging from the solar atmosphere .      the stokes @xmath3 profile is often used as the basis for this estimate .",
    "as an alternate way of thinking about the different parts of the spectral line it is worth considering how a babcock magnetograph might work .",
    "if we could simultaneously track the spectral line in both states of circular polarization , the babcock magnetograph would evaluate the magnetic field on the basis of central wavelengths where the red and blue wing intensities are equal in each state of polarization . the wavelength difference between these two balance points",
    "would then define a magnetic field from the spectrally resolved line profiles .",
    "in general , a line bisector can be considered as either a function of the intensity relative to the continuum intensity or as a function of the wavelength separation between the equal intensity points . in view of the dependence of the line core intensity on the strength of the magnetic field ,",
    "we find it advantageous to use bisector half - width @xmath30 as the defining parameter .",
    "corresponding bisectors for the two states of circular polarization at a fixed but arbitrary value of @xmath30 are shown in figure [ f6 ] . the separation between the two central wavelengths at this @xmath30",
    "is indicated as @xmath39 from which a magnetic flux per unit area @xmath40 can be deduced .",
    "for the observation shown in figure [ f6 ] we show the derived bisector field strength as a function of @xmath30 in figure [ f7 ] .",
    "figure [ f8 ] which gives both the stokes @xmath3 parameter and the slope of the quiet sun line profile .",
    "the scale factor for the stokes @xmath3 has been adjusted so that the curves agree near the line center . the magnetic field can be calculated from this scaling factor if we use the linear approximation .",
    "this gives a field strength based on the point - wise slope of the spectral line and the corresponding stokes @xmath3 value so that a magnetic field can be deduced from both wings of the spectral line .",
    "we refer to a magnetic field deduced this way as @xmath41 . these fields along with the values of @xmath42 are shown in figure [ f9 ] .",
    "note for this plot we use @xmath43 .",
    "while @xmath41 can be calculated for both red and blue wings of the line , @xmath42 applies to both wings equally and has been plotted symmetrically .",
    "although the stokes @xmath3 parameter gives independent magnetic fields in the blue and red wings of the line , a babcock magnetograph responds to the average magnetic field from the two line wings .",
    "consequently , apart from figures [ f8 ] and [ f9 ] , the magnetic field derived from the stokes @xmath3 parameter has been made symmetric by averaging the blue and red wing field values .",
    "the comparison between @xmath41 and @xmath42 indicates that the pointwise slope leads to a smaller deduced field strength than the bisector by 25%  near the line core , a larger field in the mid part of the line wing then good agreement in the outer line wings .",
    "we do not have a definitive interpretation of this result but point out that it could be a consequence of microturbulent broadening of the line core in the flux tube .",
    "the influence of variable microturbulent line broadening on the interpretation of spectropolarimetry of @xmath0  has been discussed recently by .      because the line wings are nearly linear over much of the line , the classical saturation effect does not influence the measurement .",
    "the classical saturation factor derived from the stokes @xmath3 parameter is shown in figure  [ f10 ] . in order to illustrate @xmath44 for a case of interest ,",
    "a flux tube field of 1500 gauss was used for this calculation although the appropriate field strength for the line core is closer to 400 gauss according to table [ t1 ] .",
    "even with this higher than appropriate field assumption , the value of @xmath44 deviates from unity by only 10% .",
    "the @xmath2  has nine zeeman components . as a simple numerical test",
    ", the unmagnetized profile was shifted and weighted by these nine amounts and a simulated profile was then produced .",
    "this numerical test gave essentially the same result as we find by shifting the line an amount equal to the weighted mean of the zeeman factors .",
    "we conclude from this simulation that the saturation factor is not substantially influenced by the presence of the nine sub - components .",
    "these parts of the line may however play a role in the line transfer process in a manner that is not captured by our simple approach ; the multiple zeeman components may produce the equivalent of an excess of microturbulence .",
    "we conclude that the dependence of the deduced field strength on position within the spectral line for @xmath2  is not consequence of the classical saturation effect even for points near the line core .",
    "the @xmath44 parameter can also be derived for the @xmath0  line . in this case",
    "the greater curvature of the line profile leads to @xmath45 at our working point of @xmath26m .",
    "the factor is only 35%  of the slope of the relationship indicated by figure  [ f3 ] confirming that thermodynamic effects play a dominant role in the modification of the apparent magnetic field strength .",
    "at each point on the solar surface we now have a range of estimates for the magnetic field : @xmath47 with @xmath48 and @xmath49 , @xmath42 and @xmath41 .",
    "we should choose the estimate which gives the product of the field strength and filling factor appropriate to the pixel area contribution to the magnetic flux above the solar atmosphere .",
    "for this purpose , the portion of the line nearest the line center would appear to be the best choice since this part of the line is highest in the atmosphere .",
    "however , as we show in this section , the choice has to be tempered by the fact that the line core shows an excess range of variability and is vulnerable to line broadening uncertainties from microturbulence .    for portions of the solar surface outside of sunspots",
    "the apparent magnetic field strength is not greater than about 500 gauss . for zeeman shifts from fields of this strength",
    "the linear approximation is applicable and the field deduced from a magnetograph observation depends on the spectral line slope at the point of the line where the spectrograph sampling is selected .",
    "this means that the magnetogram field is consistent with what we derived above from the ratio of the stokes @xmath3 parameter to the local spectral line slope ",
    "i.e.  the magnetogram magnetic field should be consistent with the stokes @xmath3 magnetic field interpretation of the spectral line rather than the bisector interpretation of the spectral line even though the the babcock magnetograph follows the average spectral line bisector .",
    "thus , it is reasonable to expect that the observed magnetogram correlations shown in figures  [ f1 ] to [ f3 ] and table  [ t0 ] between different deduced fields should be consistent with the stokes @xmath3 deduced fields .",
    "the line profile observations come from a relatively small number of selected regions on the solar surface that may or may not be representative of a general case .",
    "however , since many of the slopes from different spectral sampling configurations are well correlated , these particular observed profiles must be representative of the general case since otherwise , there would be a wider scatter in the correlation diagrams .",
    "thus the implied field values from different parts of the line profile can be normalized so that the stokes @xmath3 field strengths and bisector field strengths give scale factors that can be used in bringing the different deductions to a common value .",
    "the 23 sets of line scans have been reduced to yield the three estimates of the field strength indicated above .",
    "the value of @xmath50 was chosen to provide a set of field strengths roughly similar to the other two estimates .",
    "the value of @xmath51 was interpolated in @xmath28 to be appropriate to the position of each line scan field strength function .",
    "selected line scan results illustrating this comparison are shown in figure [ f11 ] .",
    "the s indicate the rescaled correlation coefficients obtained from the magnetograms , the solid and dashed lines give the symmetrized fields from figure [ f9 ] .",
    "in addition to the cases of @xmath52 from table [ t0 ] we have included the implied slope at @xmath2@xmath25m  by combining the slope in figure [ f3 ] with the correlations from the observations of 1991 .",
    "this point is shown as the symbol .",
    "the choice of cases to present in figure  [ f11 ] was made to illustrate four points : 1 ) the weaker field cases are erratic , 2 ) the bisector fields show less dependence on position in the line than is the case for the stokes @xmath3 field , 3 ) for the stronger field cases the slope dependence on spectral sampling is similar to the stokes @xmath3 dependence on @xmath53 and 4 ) there does not seem to be a dependence of the results on the center - to - limb angle . for field strengths above about 40 gauss , the patterns for the cases shown in the top four plots are typical . for the weaker fields there is a considerable range of behavior with that for the bottom left case being an extreme .",
    "the implied line core field for this case is only 20%  of that implied at @xmath54m .",
    "other cases of weak field actually have the core field greater than that at @xmath54m .",
    "in contrast the higher field cases show the pattern of the bisector field being less dependent on @xmath30 than the stokes @xmath3 field is on @xmath53 for portions of the line nearer the line core .",
    "since the stokes @xmath3 field @xmath55 gives a good reproduction of the correlation coefficients from the scatter diagrams and since the core parts of the bisector field @xmath42 are less sensitive to @xmath30 than @xmath41 is to @xmath53 , we adopt a model that the most appropriate field to use in determining the magnetic flux above the solar atmosphere is @xmath42 where @xmath30 approaches zero .",
    "we believe that correlation coefficient field as well as the stokes @xmath3 field near the line core are influenced by extra line broadening in the magnetized flux tube .",
    "since we are unable to observe this line profile we must use the profile from a standard quiet region which has a steeper slope near the line core so that the apparent falloff in field strength is due to division by too large a number .",
    "it is possible to estimate some properties of the spectral line profile in the magnetized flux tube by integrating the stokes @xmath3 parameter .",
    "this gives a shape near the line core which is indeed broader compared to that of the unmagnetized line in the case of the observations of july 13 , 2007 .",
    "the bisector field does not depend on the line slope but only on the requirement of equal intensity on the red and blue wings so that its falloff toward the line core must be a consequence of some other effect such as flux cancelation . to combine the results of the magnetogram scatter diagrams and the line profile data using our adopted model , we identify the line profile quantity @xmath56 as corresponding to @xmath50 used in the scatter diagram and we identify the line profile quantity @xmath57 as the recommended field .",
    "the ratio : @xmath58 is then a factor which will convert @xmath59 into the final correction factor for our observed magnetograms using @xmath60 in the mwo synoptic program . we show the derived values of @xmath61 in figure [ f12 ] as a function of @xmath56 .",
    "it is noteworthy that for areas with fields @xmath56 larger than about 30 gauss the values of @xmath61 are quite stable and do not depend on the center - to - limb angle .",
    "the variations in @xmath61 for smaller fields are not due to error of measurement of the fields but rather are a consequence of some structural property of the solar surface . for our purpose",
    ", we do not need to understand the cause for this behavior and can simply adopt the value of @xmath61 to be @xmath62 which is the average and error of the mean of all the cases with @xmath63gauss .",
    "examination of figure [ f5a ] reveals that the raw @xmath3 profiles for the weaker field cases are much less regular than the stronger field cases .",
    "the flux tube structure implies that the weaker field areas have a small number of flux tubes .",
    "the @xmath3 irregularities may be a consequence of statistical fluctuations around a fairly stable mean structure .",
    "theoretical studies of the @xmath2  line would be helpful in understanding the properties of this line in the magnetized and unmagnetized solar atmosphere as well as providing a separate indication of the relationship between the various observed magnetic field strength indicators and the magnetic flux emerging into the heliosphere .",
    "based on the adoption of the @xmath57 as the recommended field value , we can use the magnetogram correlation diagrams to obtain a new scale factor for the mt .",
    "wilson 150-foot tower telescope synoptic program which utilizes the fei line at @xmath0 . for notation",
    ", we retain the traditional quantity @xmath4 first defined by wherein the recommended field @xmath64 is : @xmath65 the previous correlation analysis by as represented by was : @xmath66 the present analysis is shown in figure [ f13 ] and gives : @xmath67 note that this correction factor is simply to take into acount line formation processes and does not include effects related to the geometry of the field .",
    "in particular an additional @xmath68 correction is required if one adopts a model wherein the magnetic field is radial .",
    "our principal result is given above and provides a small correction to the procedure previously applied to the mt .",
    "wilson observatory magnetogram observations . the previous description of this correction factor as a saturation correction is false .",
    "the various interpretations on the polarimetry of the spectral lines used in our observations differ from one another due to processes involved with transfer of radiation through an inhomogeneous , magnetized atmosphere .",
    "a full analysis of this problem is beyond the scope of the present investigation but is obviously needed to fully understand the changes in shape of the polarized spectral lines .",
    "we base our recommended correction factor on the fact that the magnetic field deduced from the spectral line bisector is less variable than the field deduced from the monochromatic stokes @xmath3 parameter .",
    "we further adopt the magnetic field implied by the properties of the spectral line near its core on the grounds that this part of the line is closest to the outer edge of the solar atmosphere .",
    "we find that the line profile properties are most stable in regions where the field strength is significantly larger than that found in the completely quiet sun .",
    "the line profiles for the weakly magnetized regions are well determined by our system but they show substantial deviations from symmetry . we suspect that this is a consequence of the reduced effect of adjacent flux tubes as a constraint on the flux tube structure in cases where the field is so weak that there are no adjacent flux tubes .",
    "the unconstrained flux tubes can then adopt a wider range of structure including perhaps cases where the field lines return locally to the solar interior rather than extending out of the solar atmosphere .",
    "the fact that the error of measurement of the fields is well below 1 gauss for our line profile system means that the measured profiles can be used to constrain models of flux tubes in regions where the field strength is very low .",
    "our determination that the differing deduced magnetic field strength for differing spectral sampling configurations has a general potential impact on the measurement of magnetic fields with other observing systems .",
    "all programs provide maps which give a single magnetic field strength for each observed point . had the adjustment of the mt .",
    "wilson fields been a consequence of a saturation effect unique to this system , the potential implications would also have been limited to the mt .  wilson system .",
    "however , our determination that the effect comes from a spectral transfer effect means that other observing programs need to determine how to relate their field measurements to measurements made by other systems . even within a single observing programs ,",
    "multiple deduced magnetic fields could occur depending on the exact specification of the algorithm bringing the spectropolarimetric data to a deduced magnetic field strength .",
    "examples where a direct comparison has been made on a pixel by pixel basis include and .",
    "we are also in a position to update discussion from [ profandmag ] which compares our scale factor to the deductions of .",
