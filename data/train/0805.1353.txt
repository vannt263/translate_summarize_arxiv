    "the dynamics of many complex systems , not only in natural sciences but in economical and social contexts as well , is usually presented in the form of time series .",
    "these series are frequently separated by random events which , in spite of their randomness , show some structure and apparent universal features  @xcite . during the last few years",
    "there have been endeavors to explain the sort of actions involved in interhuman communication  @xcite . according to this framework , decisions are taken based on a queuing process and are aimed to be valid for a wide range of phenomena such as correspondence among people , the consecutive visits of a web portal or even transactions and trading in financial markets  @xcite .",
    "the main conclusion of these studies is that , in order to reproduce the empirical observations as well as to give reason of the heterogeneous nature of outgoing tasks , the timing decision has to adopt a rule of non - trivial priority . otherwise , the implementation of , for instance , the simple rule : `` first - in - first - out '' leads to poissonian timing between consecutive outgoing events and this seems to deviate from many empirical observations .",
    "one convenient frame to approach these phenomena is provided by the continuous time random walk ( ctrw ) . within this frame one",
    "is basically concerned with the appropriate description of @xmath0 , the so - called pausing - time density ( ptd ) , which gives the probability of having a certain time interval @xmath1 between two consecutive events .",
    "many empirical ptd s present long - tailed profiles suggesting a self - similar hierarchy in the entire probability distribution . following",
    "this indication some authors  @xcite claim that the slow decay of the ptd obeys a power - law @xmath2 whose exponent is almost universal in the sense that it seems to adopt only two different values @xmath3 and @xmath4  @xcite . in the next section",
    "we will present a simple approach which gives a power - law reproducing these exponents .",
    "besides the ptd which doubtlessly provides maximal information on interevent statistics , the deep structure of the fractal hierarchy is perhaps more easily unveiled by looking at the @xmath5-moments of the interevent times instead of solely observing the ptd tails .",
    "one is thus able to answer questions such as whether the process is monofractal or multifractal and if there eventually exist different regimes depending on the value of @xmath5 ( the order of the @xmath5-moment ) .",
    "this information obtained from data can afterwards guide us to find out the main ingredients of a more refined theoretical model for human decision dynamics .",
    "this is certainly the chief motivation of this work .",
    "herein we propose an alternative framework to the existing ones which are basically based on queuing processes but that it still considers the heterogeneous nature of the executed tasks . within our approach",
    "it is possible to deal with analytical expressions , not only simulations , and we believe we provide good tools to describe the more subtle structure arisen from @xmath5-moments .",
    "the approach we propose has its roots in physics and is reminiscent of mixture of distributions hypothesis in finance that can be traced back to the 1970s  @xcite , the variational principle of energy dissipation distributions at different timescales in turbulence in the 1990s  @xcite , the superstatistics and nonextensive entropy  @xcite .",
    "in fact , the ptd @xmath0 was first introduced within the ctrw model which was originally established by montroll and weiss  @xcite . under this very general",
    "setting , the present development has been inspired by the work of scher and montroll  @xcite who in 1975 proposed the so - called `` valley model '' to describe the power - law relaxation of photocurrents created in amorphous ( glossy ) materials .",
    "we shall use the same idea but in a completely different background .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sect .",
    "[ sec2 ] we present the fundamentals of scher and montroll s model and apply it to explain the emergence of long - tailed distributions in the pausing - time statistics . in sect .",
    "[ sec3 ] we address the question of the moments of the interevent times and obtain the conditions for the multifractal behavior of such moments . in sect .",
    "[ sec4 ] we test multifractality on large financial data sets .",
    "conclusions are drawn in sect . [ sec5 ] and",
    "some technical details are in the appendix .",
    "scher and montroll s `` valley model '' proposes a conditional ptd @xmath6 as the starting distribution .",
    "this conditional density accounts for the probability that a given carrier is trapped during a time interval @xmath1 within a potential well of depth @xmath7 .",
    "after this time interval has elapsed the carrier jumps to another potential valley .",
    "it is next assumed that the energy @xmath7 is a random variable described by a density @xmath8  @xcite .",
    "we thus have a `` superstatistics '' with the unconditional pausing - time density @xmath0 given by @xmath9 the conditional ptd is assumed to be the simple exponential ( poisson ) form  @xcite @xmath10 .",
    "\\label{rown : psicond}\\ ] ] this choice is quite reasonable since for a given @xmath7 the emerging statistics is homogeneous because all occurrences have the same origin and in consequence they enjoy an identical characteristic time scale @xmath11 .",
    "scher and montroll also assume that the relationship between the random energy @xmath7 and the characteristic time of the distribution is given by the simple exponential form : @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 , a fundamental constant of the model , is measured in units of energy .",
    "we should note that in scher - montroll s approach @xmath15 is the thermal energy of the environment at temperature @xmath16 ( @xmath17 is the boltzmann constant ) .",
    "we remark at this point that the valley model is consistent with the most basic properties of a queuing process recently addressed by vazquez et al  @xcite .",
    "indeed , in that process a set of incoming messages , or tasks , arrives at random . to these messages",
    "a certain priority labeled by @xmath7 is attached .",
    "the execution time of a given task with priority @xmath7 is described by the conditional density @xmath6 . in the most general",
    "setting @xmath7 is also a random variable characterized by a density @xmath8 .",
    "we are thus faced again with the `` superstatistics '' mentioned above since the timing of the outgoing tasks is governed by the unconditional ptd @xmath0 given by eq .",

    "the system has a finite average time between consecutive outgoing events , while in the latter case , i.e. , for the  low - temperature phase \" , such a time ceases to exist , which means that the long term localisation for the whole observational time has sufficient probability .",
    "we can say that in this phase event statistics is dominated by rare and extreme events  @xcite .",
    "we may therefore assert that when @xmath53 the system undergoes a `` phase transition '' .",

    "( [ laplace ] ) ) for the random variable @xmath7 .",
    "note that in deriving the power law ( [ zipf_law ] ) no other power - laws had to be imposed in intermediate stages such as the in the conditional ptd , which still maintains the poissonian form , nor in the characteristic time scale @xmath62 given by eq .",

    "we also observe that , contrary to the uniform distribution where @xmath7 is limited by the fixed length @xmath63 , there is now no upper or lower bound for the random variable @xmath7 .",

    "the ptd @xmath0 provides maximal information about the timing between successive events .",
    "there are , nonetheless , other quantities that can more easily unveil hidden but relevant features of the process such as multifractality .",
    "this is precisely the case of the pausing - time moments : @xmath65 within our framework based on a superstatistics with some weight function @xmath8 , @xmath5-moments are written as @xmath66 where @xmath67 are the conditional pausing - time moments defined by @xmath68 from eqs .",

    "moreover , for the moments to exist , @xmath8 must decay faster than @xmath73 as @xmath74 .    before proceeding ahead",

    "we will now explore the possible emergence of multifractality depending on the choice of the weight function @xmath8 .",
    "the simplest assumption is @xmath19 , that is , there is no heterogeneity and all the `` valleys '' have identical depth @xmath78 .",
    "in such a case we readily obtain the monofractal behavior @xmath79 where @xmath80    we have shown in the previous section that the uniform @xmath8 and the laplace @xmath8 both result in long - tailed expressions for the ptd @xmath0 .",
    "it is thus natural to ask ourselves whether those two long - tailed distributions ( cf . eqs .",
    "( [ psi_t1_exact ] ) and ( [ exact_ptd ] ) ) are also responsible for any multifractal behavior of the @xmath5-moments .    for the uniform distribution @xmath22 ( @xmath81 ) we have @xmath82 where @xmath83 .",
