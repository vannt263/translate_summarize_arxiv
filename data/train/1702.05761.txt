    "the quasi - one - dimensional ( quasi-1d ) quantum gases can be realized by introducing a two - dimensional deep optical lattice in the transverse plane . in this situation ,",
    "the kinetic energy of the particles is too weak to drive them to the transversal excited energy levels .",
    "when the two - body interaction can not support a bound state , the transverse confinement can be used to modify scattering along the unconfined direction by providing an additional structure of the transverse energy levels .",
    "varying the trapping frequencies , the effective one - dimensional scattering length even becomes divergent , which is the so - called confinement - induced resonance ( cir )  @xcite .",
    "the transverse anisotropy is a basic tunable parameter for a quasi-1d quantum gas .",
    "the cir for an ultracold quasi-1d gas has been observed by measuring the atom loss and heating rate with respect to different transversely anisotropic confinements  @xcite .",

    "we propose to tune the width of the cir with the transverse frequency ratio .",
    "furthermore , we carefully study the thermodynamics of this system and find the change of the cir width can manifest itself in the position of the discontinuity in the interaction energy density . at first , we analytically calculate the resonance position @xmath5 and width @xmath6 of the cir .",
    "we find that both @xmath5 and @xmath6 can be tuned by varying the ratio between the two transverse trapping frequencies .",
    "typically , we find that , for quasi-1d @xmath7cs bose gases , @xmath6 diverges at two critical frequency ratios @xmath8 and @xmath9 , while there is no divergence in the cir width for @xmath10k atoms .",
