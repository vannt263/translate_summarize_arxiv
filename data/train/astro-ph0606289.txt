    "determinations of elemental abundances and structures in a various of stars belong to the most important tasks of observational astronomy and the understanding of the evolution of chemical elements .",
    "the temperature structure of emitting layers such as the stellar coronae must be known before elemental abundances can be determined .",
    "the density is another important physical parameter to describe the magnetically confined plasma in outer atmospheres of late - type stars , which can be used to estimate the spatial information for the stellar coronae . for those pre - main sequence stars ,",
    "the constrained density can give us clues for the origin of the x - ray production such as magnetics alike the stellar coronae or a shock due to accretion processes .",
    "before the launch of missions with high resolution spectrograph such as the @xmath3 and xmm-@xmath4 , a determination of the electron temperature of x - ray emitting layers usually adopts a technique of global - fitting to spectra .",
    "the determined temperature structure from this technique strongly depends on the determination of continuum level of the observed spectra .",
    "the measurement of electron density is not possible for non - solar stars with previous x - ray satellites such as asca and rosat configured with low- and medium - resolution spectrographs .",
    "the observation data provided by high - resolution spectrograph on board new generation satellites @xmath3 and xmm-@xmath4 , allow us to estimate this parameter .",
    "individual emission lines can be resolved from high - quality spectra , further the electron temperature can be derived from line intensity ratios such as @xmath5 value ( between intercombination @xmath6 and forbidden @xmath7 lines _ vs",
    "_ resonance line @xmath8 ) of he - like ions which was described by @xcite in detail .",
    "since then , the estimation of the electron density becomes possible from x - ray emission line ratios such as @xmath9 value between @xmath6 and @xmath7 lines he - like ions .",
    "using observation data with lower spectral resolution , @xmath10 and emission measures @xmath11 can not be obtained independently , such that no emitting volumes @xmath12 could be estimated from the relation of @xmath13 .",
    "the structural information of the outmost atmosphere of stars was accessible from the analysis of lightcurves for a few special systems such as rotational modulation , eclipse mapping , etc .",
    "however , the solution of the reconstructed differential em is always nonunique , and involves the difficulty of disentangling time - dependent versus geometric variability @xcite . since the operation of the two satellites with high - resolution and high - collecting areas ,",

    "* etc . ) . using he - like triplet lines ,",
    "a systematic investigation of the electron temperature and density for late - type stars with various levels of activity , has been made by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "however , the uv field significantly affects the he - like triplet lines .",
    "recently , @xcite presented a density diagnostic ratio being independent from the uv field , that therefore allows to disentangle @xmath10 and uv field that both affect the o  vii triplet lines .",
    "additionally , the derived density has also been used to estimate the production mechanism ( alike stellar corona or accretion ) of the x - ray emission in pre - main sequence stars @xcite .",
    "soft x - ray emissions of l - shell ions of silicon have been detected extensively in spectra of stellar coronae .",
    "these emissions carried out information of the two physical parameters for the solar - like coronae . in our previous work , we investigated the emission lines of si x , and diagnosed the coronal electron density using them for late - type star  procyon @xcite .",
    "the soft x - ray emissions arising from 3d2p , 3s2p and 3p2s transitions of si xi have also been detected obviously for some cool stars , such as procyon and @xmath0 cen a&b @xcite . and",
    "the temperature ( 1.6  mk ) of maximum formation of si  xi ion in the ionization equilibrium @xcite , is the typical temperature of corona of stars with low activities , which makes the analysis of si  xi soft x - ray emission lines interesting .",
    "euv features arising from 2s@xmath142s2p and 2s@xmath142p@xmath14 transitions of si xi have been used to derive the electron temperature and density for solar flares .",
    "@xcite presented seven line ratios whereas these ratios are usually sensitive to both the electron temperature and density of the emitting plasma .",
    "moreover measured ratios obtained with the naval research laboratory s s082a spectrograph on board _ skylab _ , are larger than theoretical high - temperature and high - density limits @xcite . later , @xcite calculated these line ratios again and compared with solar observations obtained with normal incidence spectrometer on board soho cds , as well as laboratory measurements performed by @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the euv lines , there has been little work on the soft x - ray transitions of si xi in astrophysical literatures , probably as a result of the limited availability of high quality spectra of stellar in this wavelength region .",
    "this paper is organized as following , we firstly investigate the si  xi soft x - ray emission lines and present theoretical calculations of temperature- and/or density - sensitive line intensity ratios in sect .",
    "a brief description of observations and extractions of line fluxes is presented in sect .",
    "results and discussions are outlined in sect .",
    "our conclusions are given in sect .",
    "our model of si xi consists of energetically lowest 350 fine - structure energy levels belonging to configurations 2s@xmath14 , 2s2p , 2p@xmath14 , 2l3l@xmath15 , 2l4l@xmath15 , 2l5l@xmath15 , 2l6l@xmath15 and 2l7l@xmath15 ( l = s , p ; l@xmath16 ) .",
    "some energy levels are replaced by available experimental values from the nist databaseasd ] and results of @xcite .",
    "the theoretical calculation is performed using a fully relativistic method  flexible atomic code ( fac ) developed by @xcite .",
    "self - consistent results of electron impact excitation , de - excitation rates and einstein @xmath17-coefficient ( including electric- and magnetic - dipole , as well as quadrupole transitions ) among the 350 levels were also included in present model .",
    "the input atomic data of our model significantly differs from that of chianti code , in which only 46 low - lying energy levels , and the excitation and radiative decay among the 46 levels were included .",
    "present model is an extensive one , and cascade effects on the upper levels of interested transition lines from higher excited levels up to @xmath18 ( @xmath19 is the main quantum number ) , have been considered . in our recent work @xcite , a detailed assessment for the calculated data is performed , which reveals that the atomic data is reliable for diagnostic application . here",
    ", a brief comparison of our data with the input atomic data of chianti code is made as shown in fig .",
    "1 . the top panel of fig . 1 illustrates the comparison of different theoretical predictions of energy levels with the available experimental ones ( the nist data and that of @xcite ) .",
    "this panel indicates that our energy levels agree with the experimental values within 0.7% , which is better than the theoretical data in the chianti database .",
    "nist only lists the energy levels being less 20  @xmath20 . for higher energy levels of above",
    "@xmath2120_ryd _ ,",
    "@xcite reported some values and determined the energy levels from observed wavelengths by an interactive optimization procedure using the program elcalc @xcite . comparing with their energy levels also can benchmark our prediction in a certain extent .",
    "a better agreement is shown by the filled circles in the upper panel of fig .",
    "the comparison of weighted oscillator strengths is illustrated in the middle panel of fig .",
    "1 , which reveals the two different data is comparable within 20% for most strong transitions ( _ gf_@xmath220.1 ) . for those transitions involved in below interested ratios ( filled up - triangle in fig .",
    "1 ) , the two different predictions show a good agreement within 20% .",
    "the prominent 3d2p transitions exhibit a better agreement . for some weak transitions ( _ gf _",
    "@xmath230.1 ) , large discrepancies up to several factors appear .",
    "we suggest such differences are due to different inclusions of configuration interaction ( ci ) in the different data sources .",
    "the work of @xcite and @xcite has revealed that the consideration of an elaborate ci is very necessary , which support our performance of atomic data calculation .",
    "for the effective collision strength ( @xmath24 ) obtained under the maxwellian distribution , only the data at a temperature of 1.0  mk ( the bottom panel of fig .",
    "1 ) is compared for concision , because the temperature is the typical coronal temperature of stars with less activity .",
    "proton impact excitation is important process for population and de - population of the lowest levels with @xmath25 complexes .",
    "data from @xcite was employed in present model , in which the close - coupled impact - parameter method was adopted in the calculation .",
    "the theoretical line intensities are obtained by solving steady - state rate equations with optically thin assumptions , as described by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "such assumptions are based on the following reasons .",
    "firstly , photon - excitation and de - excitation rates are negligible in comparison with the electron impact excitation rates in stellar corona , tokamak and laser - produced plasmas , so the processes are nt considered ; secondly , the rates of ionization to and recombination from other ionic stages are lower than bound - bound transition rates ; finally , emitted photon directly escapes the plasma , does not collide with particles again .",
    "the line intensities are calculated over a wide range of the electron temperature and density . here",
    ", we pay careful attention on five prominent lines of si xi , as listed in table 1 .",
    "the @xmath26 line at 52.306 is a strong and isolated line in these selected features .",
    "a detailed analysis indicates that following emission line intensity ratios of si xi ion are sensitive to the electron temperature and/or density : @xmath27 and @xmath28 therefore they may be useful diagnostic techniques for the electron temperature and density for all kinds of hot plasma .",
    "2 plots these ratios as a function of the electron temperature at @xmath10=1.0@xmath2910@xmath30  @xmath31 , and _ vs _ the electron density at log@xmath32(k)=6.2 which is the temperature of maximum formation of si  xi(see solid line in the figure ) .",
    "the ratios are given in photon units , and used throughout the paper .",
    "the ratio @xmath33 varies from 1.7 to 0.9 over the temperature range of log@xmath32(k)=6.06.4 , and no variation occurs through a large range of density 10@xmath3410@xmath35  @xmath31 , which is the typical condition of astrophysical , tokamak and ebit plasmas .",
    "this indicates the ratio @xmath33 is a powerful diagnostic technique of the electron temperature for the hot astrophysical and laboratory plasmas .",
    "ratio @xmath36 exhibits the same behavior as @xmath33 , yet this ratio shows a less temperature - sensitivity than that of @xmath33 .",
    "the ratio @xmath37 appears to be sensitive to the electron density ( shown in fig .",
    "3 ) , simultaneously it displays a certain sensitivity to the electron temperature .",
    "for example , increasing log@xmath32(k ) from 6.2 to 6.4 leads to 8  per  cent variation at @xmath10=1.0@xmath2910@xmath30  @xmath31 .",
    "the feature at 46.391   being correlative to ratios @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 has been identified to be 46.410   line arising from @xmath40 transition of si xi in work of @xcite . after adjusting by experimental value from the nist database , a better wavelength 46.401  ",
    "is obtained in present work .",
    "we noticed that the emissivity of the line at 46.404   is about 10  per  cent relative to that of 46.401   , whereas the two lines can not be resolved using present available spectrographs .",
    "the expected blending of 46.404   line is rather smaller than both the theoretical uncertainty and statistical error in the line flux measurement , however the blending effect was considered in this study .",
    "ratio @xmath38 is also sensitive to the electron density , but it is insensitive to the electron temperature in the density - sensitive region , as shown in the lower panel of fig .",
    "2 . the variation is less than 4  per  cent when log@xmath32(k ) changes 0.2  dex .",
    "this indicates @xmath38 is a powerful @xmath10-diagnostic tool for the line formation region . as @xmath37 , the blending effect in 46.391",
    " line has been also considered in the prediction of @xmath38 .",
    "ratios @xmath39@xmath41 show obvious @xmath10 and @xmath32-dependence , as shown by curves of @xmath39 and @xmath42 in fig .",
    "2 . for clearness , the curve of @xmath41 _ vs _ @xmath32 is not given , only its dependence on @xmath10 is plotted in fig .",
    "the resolved lines and their blending contributions are listed in table 1 . from above analysis , we distinguish that @xmath33 and @xmath38 are powerful @xmath43 and @xmath10 diagnostic method , respectively . using the properties of si  xi , we can estimate the electron temperature and density in si xi emitting region for cool stars .",
    "in this work , we re - analyze the spectra of stars including three normal dwarf stars , i.e. , @xmath0  cen  a&b , procyon and @xmath2  eri , and an active binary system capella .",
    "the detailed descriptions and analyses for these stars are available from many literatures ( * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* etc . ) . here",
    ", we briefly describe the observations and data reductions for these stars .",
    "cen  a and b are firstly resolved from spectral observation with low energy transmission grating spectrometer ( letgs ) instrument on board _ chandra _ observatory , a detailed description about it was given by @xcite .",
    "all observations use the letgs combined with high resolution camera ( hrc ) detector .",
    "reduction of the letgs datasets adopts ciao3.2 software with the science threads for letgs / hrc - s observations . for the extraction of the spectra of @xmath0  cen  a&b , a similar procedure used by @xcite",
    "is adopted here under the ciao environment .",
    "line fluxes are obtained by locally fitting the emission features using multiple overlapping gaussian profiles , together with a constant value representing background and ( pseudo-)continuum emission , which was determined in line - free regions such as ( 5152 ) .",
    "the positive order spectra was used to derive the line fluxes because some lines such as 52.306   of si xi lie in the gap between chips in the negative spectra .",
    "determinations of the line fluxes of si xi lines are difficult because a large amount of emissions of highly ionized magnesium , sulfur and argon is also present in this wavelength range of 4353 . here",
    "we choose procyon as an example to illustrate . at the shorter wavelength wing of si  xi line at 43.743   , a weak line of s  xii at 43.649",
    " appears as illustrated in the left panel of fig .",
    "4 . two emission lines of s  ix at 49.107   and 49.324   broaden the shoulder of si  xi line at 49.207   as shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "4 . by the best - fitting to the spectra ,",
    "observed line fluxes are obtained as listed in table 1 with 1@xmath44 statistical error . in this table , labels such as @xmath45 and @xmath46 in first column denote this line is blended . for procyon and @xmath0  cen  a&b , all prominent lines of si xi have been identified by @xcite , and line fluxes are consistent with those derived by us within 1@xmath44 statistical error .",
    "however , for @xmath2  eri and capella , only the line at 49.207   is reported in available literatures .",
    "sect . 2 has revealed that @xmath33 and @xmath36 are good @xmath32 diagnostic tools . by comparing observed line ratios @xmath33 and @xmath36 with the theoretical predictions as shown in fig .",
    "5 , the electron temperature of the si xi emitting region is obtained , as listed in table 2 .",
    "the observed ratio @xmath33 of @xmath0  cen  a slightly higher than other observed ratios , and the value is up to 1.72 .",
    "this implies that the diagnosed temperature is lower than that of other stars .",
    "in other cases , the observed ratios of @xmath33 are ranging from 1.2 to 1.4 . in consequence ,",
    "the diagnosed electron temperatures lie within @xmath211.52.4  mk . these results are consistent with the temperature ( 1.6  mk ) of maximum formation of si xi in the ionization equilibrium @xcite .",
    "the results also agree with the peak temperature of differential emission measure ( dem ) constructed from a global spectral fitting for normal stars including procyon and @xmath0  cen @xcite , and low - temperature component of dem for active binary system  capella @xcite . for @xmath0  cen binary system ,",
    "our results further confirms raassen s conclusion derived from he - like triplet that @xmath0  cen  b ( k1v ) component is hotter than the @xmath0  cen  a ( g2v ) component @xcite .    as stated in sect.2 , @xmath36 shows a less sensitivity than that of @xmath33 , so measured ratios are compatible with the upper limit of the theoretical prediction within 1@xmath44 statistical error . in the case of procyon ,",
    "@xcite have reported that the si  xi line at 49.207 is contaminated by ar ix line at 49.181   which can not be resolved out by present letgs instrument on board _ chandra _ observatory .",
    "therefore , the correct extraction of the fraction of ar  ix line is very important .",
    "fortunately , @xcite also detected this line in their recent experiment conducted in ebit measurement for l - shell spectra of highly charged argon . using the experimental ratio ( 1.11 ) between the lines at 48.737   and 49.181   of ar ix measured in the ebit facility",
    ", we extracted the contribution of ar ix line and rederived the ratio @xmath36 .",
    "the weak @xmath32-dependence of the ratio of the two ar  ix lines supports the direct application of the experimental value .",
    "taking procyon star as an example , the ar ix line at 48.730   has been obviously detected and no other contamination .",
    "we conclude that the ar ix line at 49.181   occupies about 18  per  cent to the total flux around 49.207 .",
    "the intensity of the ar  ix line is nearly 2@xmath44 errors . by considering the @xmath2118  per  cent contribution ,",
    "the ratio @xmath36 increases from 0.52@xmath470.13 to 0.64@xmath48 , accordingly the derived temperature drops from 7.07 to 2.24  mk which shows consistency with that derived from @xmath33 within error . for our other sample ,",
    "we measured the line flux of ar  ix around 48.730 , and performed similar procedure as in procyon .",
    "the derived temperatures show an good agreement with those from @xmath33 within @xmath49 error .",
    "we also notice that the intensity of ar  ix line relative to si  xi lines changes with the coronal temperature , and specifically , a lower contamination from ar  ix lines is expected for more active stars .",
    "2 indicated that @xmath38 is a powerful diagnostic tool for the electron density in the si xi emitting region of hot plasma . by comparing the observed ratios with theoretical prediction",
    ", we derived the electron density in the si xi emitting region of coronal plasma , as shown in fig . 5 . here",
    ", the comparison of @xmath38 together with @xmath37 is illustrated in fig .",
    "table 3 lists the observed line ratios with 1@xmath44 statistical error and the diagnosed density for our sample .    the first impression of fig .",
    "6 is the uncertainty of observed line ratios appearing to be large , and almost all the observed ratios of @xmath38 agreeing with high - density limit in statistical error with exception of @xmath0  cen  b case being agreement with low - density limit .",
    "a long exposure times are necessary to better constrain the density from @xmath38 . yet",
    "present line ratio measurements still can give us some clues for the si xi emitting region , that is the lower or upper density limit can be constrained from our measurements .",
    "we note that mean value of the electron density for our sample is above 2@xmath50  @xmath31 , which is the typical density of solar quiescent coronal plasma .",
    "for the ratio @xmath37 , the contaminated si  xi line at 49.207 is concerted , so the blending effect due to the ar  ix line is considered as above subsection .",
    "taking procyon as an example , @xmath37 drops from 3.60@xmath471.07 to 2.95@xmath51 by taking into account the contamination .",
    "a density of @xmath52  @xmath31 is obtained , which agrees with that constrained by @xmath38 within @xmath49 statistical error . since the large statistical errors ,",
    "only the lower or upper limit of the density is given for our sample as listed in table 3 .",
    "the temperature of maximum formation of si xi is close to that of n vii emission lines , therefore the physical conditions in si xi and n vii emitting region can be compatible . for n vii , the temperature can be derived in principle from ratio between ly@xmath0 line and ly@xmath53 line .",
    "however the ly@xmath53 line generally is faint .",
    "so the temperature derived from ratio between ly@xmath0 line and resonance line of he - like ion can trace the this information .",
    "firstly , we compare our results of @xmath32 with those derived from emissions of h- and he - like n ions as shown in table 4 . in this table , ly@xmath54 column represents temperature derived from ratio between ly@xmath0 and resonance line @xmath8 of he - like n vi , while the next column represents temperature constrained by ratio between ly@xmath0 and sum of triplet lines of he - like n vi , whereas the last column @xmath5 denotes the temperature obtained from the ratio @xmath55 _ vs _ resonance line .",
    "all the earlier results are from work of @xcite .",
    "present results are slightly higher than those determined from emissions of h- and he - like n , whereas they agree within 1@xmath44 statistical error .",
    "the results from @xmath5 ratio seem to systematically underestimate @xmath32 as reported by @xcite .",
    "secondly , we compare present results of @xmath10 with those available from literatures as shown in table 5 . in available literatures ,",
    "the density of cooler plasma of stellar coronae are usually derived from the ratio between the intercombination ( @xmath6 ) and forbidden ( @xmath7 ) lines of he - like carbon , nitrogen and oxygen ions . above comparison",
    "has denoted the temperature of si xi ( or n vii ) emitting region is consistent with that of n vi and n vii mixing region .",
    "so we presumed the emissions of n  vi - vii and si  xi are emitted by the same plasma , that is the density derived from different techniques should be comparable .",
    "table 5 reveals present results agree with the previous work of @xcite from emissions of h- and he - like nitrogen . in the case of @xmath0",
    "cen  b , the constrained upper limit of density is obviously lower than the density determined by @xcite within @xmath49 error , however they agree within @xmath56 error , such deviation can attribute to the low s / n . in the work of @xcite , the effect of radiative field has been considered .",
    "large errors in ratios of si xi result in large uncertainties in deduced electron temperatures and densities , which imply large uncertainties in derived electron pressures . here , we adopt the @xmath10 corresponding to the best - fit value of @xmath38 to trace the information about the pressures and structures in line forming regions .",
    "evaluating now the coronal pressure ( @xmath57 ) for stars studied here as shown in table 6 .",
    "for procyon , present result is similar to that derived from n vi ( 4.4  dyn / cm@xmath14 ) by @xcite . @xcite also evaluated the pressure using the derived @xmath32 and @xmath10 from o  vii for capella , and a upper limit of @xmath216.0  dyn / cm@xmath14 was obtained , which is in good agreement with present result of 5.57  dyn / cm@xmath14 .",
    "the electron pressure of @xmath2  eri appears higher than other cases by a factor of @xmath212 , and which is also slightly higher than that ( 6.60  dyn / cm@xmath14 ) derived by @xcite using uv emission lines of si  iii and o  iv .    in terms of these deduced @xmath10 and @xmath32",
    ", we further estimate the coronal structure through filling factors in the line forming region .",
    "we firstly derive emitting ( coronal ) volumes @xmath59 according to a formula @xmath60 , whereas @xmath61 represents a ion - specific emission measure which is determined by the correlation between ion - specific luminosity ( @xmath62 ) and line peak emissivity ( @xmath63 ) , @xmath64 here , the cleanest line at 52.306   is used to deduce the ion - specific emission measure . for the peak emissivity",
    ", two different values from present calculation and the astrophysical plasma emission code ( apec ) database are adopted .",
    "secondly , we estimate available volumes @xmath65 which can potentially be filled with coronal plasma . and an assumption is made to derive @xmath65 , that is the plasma is confined in an uniform distribution of loop structures obeying the loop scaling law of ( * ? ?",
    "* hereafter rtv ) : @xmath66 with the electron density @xmath67 and the plasma temperature @xmath68 at the loop top .",
    "@xcite regarded the loop - top temperature as equivalent to the hotter component of a two - temperature distribution , while the temperature of the hotter component has a such relation : @xmath69 the density at the loop - top @xmath67 we derive it from the measured density @xmath10(si  xi ) assuming pressure equilibrium in a given loop , i.e. , @xmath70 . from these considerations ,",
    "the available volumes @xmath71 can be expressed as @xmath72 in cgs units .",
    "the ratio of these volumes is defined as the filling factor @xmath73    in table 6 , we derive the filling factor for si xi emitting regions along with the deduced electron pressures .",
    "a few percent of the filling factor for stellar surface is derived again from another line ratios .",
    "present peak emissivity ( 4.31@xmath74phot.@xmath75s@xmath76 ) is lower than the apec result ( 5.72@xmath74phot.@xmath75s@xmath76 ) by 25% , which straightforward results in the filling factor slightly higher as indicated in table 6 . in our prediction ,",
    "silicon abundance of the solar photospheric of @xcite is adopted , and the ionization equilibrium calculation of @xcite is used to deduce the emissivity for si  xi emission lines .",
    "the different peak emissivity might be due to the different atomic data performed with the different inclusion of ci .",
    "moreover , cascade effects from higher excited levels has been considered in present prediction .",
    "@xcite also derived the filling factor for a large sample of stellar coronae using o  vii and ne  ix lines , and very small filling factor was found again .",
    "assuming balance between radiation losses and the net conductive flux , @xcite derived _ area _ filling factor ranging from the transition to the inner corona for @xmath2  eri . the derived temperature from si  xi emission is @xmath212  mk . so",
    "the derived filling factors may be comparable with ones from o  vii .",
    "the comparison illustrated in table 6 confirms this point .",
    "@xcite also investigated filling factors using mg  xi and o  vii for 22 active stars . and they concluded that the surface coronal filling factors are @xmath77@xmath78 and @xmath791 for the hotter plasma with @xmath80  k and the cooler plasma with @xmath81  k , respectively . using the derived electron temperature and density from si  xi , filling factor of @xmath82 to @xmath83 is estimated from si  xi , which shows an agreement with that derived from o  vii by @xcite for active stars .",
    "since the lower or upper limits of the density are obtained from si  xi for our sample , we further present the real constraints on the pressure and filling factors as shown in table 7 .",
    "we estimated the pressure in magnetic loops is larger than @xmath210.5  dyn / cm@xmath14 for our sample except for procyon .",
    "this result is complementary to the work of @xcite , who derived the upper limits from o  vii triplets .",
    "the filling factors being less than @xmath214% are estimated , which shows good consistency with results constrained by o  vii triplets . for @xmath0  cen  b , the lower limit of @xmath7 ( 0.36% ) and upper limit of @xmath84 ( 2.75  dyn / cm@xmath14 )",
    "are estimated .",
    "in summary , we investigate l - shell soft x - ray emission lines of si xi by using a more complete kinetic model . in this model , cascade effect from higher excited levels with @xmath18 on the upper levels of the present interested lines has been included .",
    "our analysis reveals that some line intensity ratios such as @xmath33 and @xmath36 , provide useful temperature diagnostics in a temperature range of 5.56.5 ( in log@xmath32(k ) ) , while @xmath38 is useful to diagnose the density in a range of @xmath85  @xmath31 .    by comparing the observed ratios with theoretical prediction , the electron temperature and density for our sample including normal stars ( procyon and @xmath0  cen  a&b ) and active binary system  capella ,",

    "the constrained temperatures by @xmath33 with 1.62.4  mk , are consistent with the temperature of maximum si xi fractional abundance in the ionization equilibrium @xcite and the peak temperature of the dem constructed from a global fitting of spectra for inactive stars .",
    "since the blending effect in @xmath36 from ar  ix line at 49.181   , the correct line flux measurement of 49.207   may induce a certain of systemical errors . using the experimental ratio ( 1.11 ) of ar  ix lines between 48.730   and 49.181   , we re - derived @xmath36 and the temperatures , yet",
    "they show a good agreement with those constrained by @xmath33 . taking into account the contamination of ar  ix line ,",
    "densities constrained by @xmath37 also show agreement with those by @xmath38 within @xmath49 statistical error .",
    "temperatures determined by si  xi emissions slightly higher than ones constrained by emissions of h- and he - like n , whereas they are in agreement within 1@xmath44 error .",
    "so we presume the emissions of n  vi - vii and si  xi are emitted by the same plasma .",
    "the yielded temperatures from @xmath5 ratio are systematically lower than present ones as reported by @xcite",
    ". this may be due to the slightly lower peak temperature ( 1.4  mk ) of the contribution function of the n  vi triplets .",
    "an agreement of the densities from the two different line ratios of highly charged silicon and nitrogen , is found .",
    "this further suggests that the si  xi and n  vi - vii emitting plasma may be confined in the same loop .    a filling factor of @xmath82 to @xmath83",
    "is derived for our sample from si  xi , and a upper limit of 4% is obtained .",
    "such results are consistent with the findings of @xcite and @xcite that filling factors are much smaller than unity ; they also support the findings of @xcite that the filling factor of cooler plasma is directly proportional to the x - ray surface flux of stars .",
