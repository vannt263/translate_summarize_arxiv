    "more precisely , our interest focuses on the set @xmath10 of @xmath0 matrix pencils with complex coefficients and normal rank at most @xmath1 , with @xmath11 if @xmath6 and @xmath12 if @xmath7 .    in the contexts where matrix pencils usually arise , e.g. , systems of first order ordinary differential equations with constant coefficients @xmath13",

    "the computation of the kcf of a given pencil @xmath4 is a delicate task , because it is not a continuous function of the entries of @xmath15 and @xmath16 ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "nonetheless , when a good algorithm ( for instance , the backward stable one in @xcite ) is used to compute the kcf , the output is the kcf of a pencil @xmath17 , nearby  to the exact one , more precisely , a kcf that contains the exact kcf in its orbit closure , as explained in the next paragraph . in this setting",
    ", the analysis of the geometry of the set of @xmath0 matrix pencils may be useful @xcite .",

    "we identify each orbit under strict equivalence with the kcf of any pencil in this orbit ( by definition , they all have the same kcf ) .",
    "then we say that some kcf , @xmath23 , degenerates to the kcf @xmath24 if @xmath24 belongs to the closure of the orbit of @xmath25 .",
    "in other words , if there is a sequence of matrix pencils , @xmath26 , all having the same kcf , namely @xmath25 , which converges to a pencil whose kcf is @xmath24 .",
    "there are some cases where it is easy to determine , even at a first glance , whether a given kcf degenerates to some other one or not .",
    "this happens , for instance , with the following two pencils in kcf : @xmath27 it holds that @xmath28 degenerates to @xmath29 , since the sequence @xmath30 , with @xmath31 consists of pencils which are strictly equivalent to @xmath28 and it converges to @xmath29 .",

    "consider the following two pencils in kcf : @xmath32 it is clear by the normal ranks that @xmath29 can not degenerate to @xmath28 , but the question as to whether or not @xmath28 can degenerate to @xmath29 is more subtle .",

    "the set of @xmath0 singular matrix pencils is an algebraic set , so it is natural to analyze it from the point of view of algebraic geometry .",
    "the approach to the description of subsets of matrix pencils using algebraic geometry can be traced back to the 1980 s with the work by waterhouse @xcite , who identified the irreducible components of @xmath33 .",

    "it seems natural to ask whether these @xmath2 subsets are related with the @xmath2 irreducible components provided in @xcite .    in this paper",
