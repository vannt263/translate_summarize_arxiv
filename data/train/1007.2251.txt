    "the coupling constants determined from the fits are @xmath41  k and @xmath4  k. the model describes well the temperature dependence and also the magnitude of the measured susceptibility for both salts .",

    "the temperature dependence of the esr line width of an anisotropic exchange coupled chain with @xmath47 , where an anisotropy axis is along _ p _ , was calculated@xcite in the @xmath48 parameter range : @xmath49 where @xmath50 for an applied field @xmath51 perpendicular ( parallel ) to the anisotropy axis , @xmath52 .",
    "the behavior is t - linear at low temperatures .",

    ", there is a smooth crossover to the high - temperature kubo - tomita limit of a constant line width of the order of @xmath54 .",
    "if the perturbation is a staggered magnetic field with amplitude @xmath55 alternating along the chain , @xmath56 , then the resulting broadening and shift@xcite are : @xmath57 the effective staggered field may arise from an alternating g - tensor or the dm interaction . in these cases the perturbation amplitude , @xmath58 is proportional to the external field and @xmath59 depends on the direction of applied field .",
    "the field dependence distinguishes the broadening and shift due to @xmath60 from the field independent effects of the uniform exchange or dipolar anisotropy of @xmath61 . here",
    "again , we included only the largest term of the low temperature approximation .",
    "the high temperature limit of the line width arising from a staggered field is not well known .",
    "oshikawa and affleck@xcite proposed that it is qualitatively different for an alternating g - factor and dm interactions . in the former case",
    "the well known motional narrowing argument applies and the limiting line width is of the order of @xmath62 . on the other hand , for the dm interaction",
    "there is a field independent and field dependent term , proportional to @xmath63 and @xmath64respectively .       and g - shift @xmath65 of measured at @xmath25  ghz in the @xmath66 and @xmath67 planes .",

    "lines are results of linear fits .",
    "note that the discontinuity of the data at @xmath18  k is likely to be associated with the orthorhombic to monoclinic phase transition@xcite , and that the topology of the co structure in the low temperature monoclinic phase is not known yet .",
    "[ fig : asf6:lw : x - band : tempdep],width=321 ]    we first discuss the low frequency limit at 300  k. the room temperature anisotropy of the line width , @xmath8 and the shift relative to the free electron g - value , @xmath35 , measured at @xmath25  ghz are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : asf6:rt : x - band : rot ] for the asf@xmath19 compound and in fig .",
    "[ fig : br : rt : x - band : rot ] for the br compound . since the frequency dependence is small , the data at 9.4 ghz correspond to the @xmath71 limit .",
    "the simplest explanation is that most of the angular dependence of the g - factor reflects the g - factor anisotropy of the cation molecules .",
    "the angular dependence of @xmath35 is the same in the two systems , supporting that this is a property related to the cations . for a magnetic field in",
    "the _ a _ direction , spins are on equivalent sites with the same g - factor . here",
    "a `` site '' consists of a pair of neighboring high and low charge molecules along _",
    "a_. since the high charge molecule carries most of the spin , the g - factor of the compound along _ a _ is close to that of a singly charged cation with field perpendicular to the molecular plane . in the _ b _ and _ c _ directions there are two sites with respect to the magnetic field .",
    "however , by symmetry , the g - factors of the two sites are the same for these particular directions .",
    "the g - factors are different in general directions , but the two esr lines of the isolated chains are `` motionally '' narrowed by the perpendicular exchange interaction between chains .",
    "the angular dependent parts of @xmath8 and @xmath35 are proportional within experimental accuracy",
    ". it would be tempting to assign the anisotropy of the line width to an incomplete motional narrowing of the inhomogeneity of the g - factors .",
    "however , as discussed below , the small frequency dependence of the line widths contradicts such an assignment , and we conclude that most of the zero frequency line width is from anisotropic exchange and dipolar coupling .",
    "the high temperature limit for the narrowing , @xmath72 , is of the order of @xmath73 and the measured line width is @xmath74  t .",
    "consequently @xmath75",
    "t is sufficient to narrow lines .",
    "now we turn to the temperature dependence in the low frequency limit . the line width in the high - temperature orthorhombic phase is anisotropic and changes little with temperature for all frequencies and crystal orientations .",
    "@xmath8 has a small linearly temperature dependent contribution . on fig .",
    "[ fig : asf6:lw : x - band : tempdep ] we plot the temperature dependence of the line width of measured at 9.4  ghz frequency .",
    "the rate of increase of @xmath8 with temperature is @xmath76 in the three crystallographic orientations respectively .",
    "the low temperature linear limit does not apply since the exchange integral @xmath3  k determined from the bonner - fisher fits of the susceptibility ( fig .",
    "[ fig : asf6:br : susc ] ) is not much larger than the temperature .",

    "( [ eq : anis ] ) .      [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     k. measurements in the _ a _ , _ b _ and _ c _ orientations are plotted by solid circle , square and triangle respectively .",

    "b ) frequency dependent part of the g - factor @xmath79 .",

    "the solid lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : br : freq : temp : lw ] are fits to eq .",
    "[ eq1 ] and [ eq2 ] .",
    "clearly , both the g - value and @xmath8 have a quadratic frequency dependence in all three crystallographic orientations .",
    "the frequency and temperature dependence is similar in the asf@xmath0 compound ( not shown ) .",
    "the coefficients measured at @xmath80 , @xmath81 and 200  k are tabulated in table  [ table:1 ] .",
    "the following arguments suggest that in these compounds the unusual quadratic frequency dependence arises from a staggered dm field .",
    "another mechanism could be an incomplete motional narrowing of a g - factor inhomogeneity@xcite . as discussed above ,",
    "the g factor of sites is uniform within the chains and alternates only from chain to chain .",
    "the quadratic dependence of the line width is largest for magnetic fields in the _ a _ direction where the g - factor is obviously homogeneous .",
    "in fact , the g factors of all sites are the same for magnetic fields in all three principle directions .",
    "thus only in general directions can the g - factor anizotropy contribute to the frequency dependence of the line width . on the other hand , the dm interaction between neighboring sites results in an alternating effective field along _ a _ direction chains .",
    "the neighboring sites are not related by inversion symmetry and thus the dm interaction is non - zero .",
    "the dm interaction is also non zero between sites of neighboring chains in the _ ( a , b ) _ plane .",
    "although the quadratic frequency dependence of the line width is well explained by the dm mechanism , the temperature dependence of the quadratic term does not follow eq .",
    "( [ eq : dmanish ] ) .",
    "the same applies to the quadratic field dependence of the g - factor which does not strengthen at lower temperatures as predicted by eq .",
    "( [ eq : dmanisg ] ) .",
    "it is quite possible that the low temperature limit is no more valid above 200  k and a better approximation is given by the high temperature limit .",
    "an order of magnitude estimate of the magnitude of the dm vector , @xmath82 from the quadratic dependence of the line width , @xmath83 is @xmath84  t. the magnitude of @xmath85 is not unrealistic , it is an order of magnitude less than in another organic weak ferromagnet , @xcite , where the interaction is between singly charged pairs of et molecules .",
    "we presented an experimental study to test theoretical predictions for the temperature and magnetic field dependence of the esr spectrum of a quantum @xmath86 antiferromagnetic chain with small anisotropic and alternating interactions .",
    "we find that above 190  k the quasi one dimensional compounds have a @xmath2 heisenberg antiferromagnetic chain - like magnetic susceptibility with @xmath3  k and @xmath4  k coupling constants for x = asf@xmath0 and br respectively . from a weak temperature dependence of @xmath8 in the @xmath87 temperature range we estimate an exchange anisotropy @xmath88 in the asf@xmath89 compound .",
    "we argue that the unusual quadratic magnetic field dependence of the line width and g - factors arise from a dzyaloshinskii - moriya anisotropic exchange interaction .",
    "the dm interaction , observed here as a small anomaly in the esr parameters , has important implications for the low temperature antiferromagnetic phase : namely the material is likely to be a weak ferromagnet .",
    "earlier magnetization measurements@xcite report an increase of magnetization below @xmath90  k. this small ferromagnetic contribution was attributed to a small impurity phase@xcite , but it could also be from a weak ferromagnetism .",
