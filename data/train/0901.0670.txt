    "the broad emission iron lines are well - known features found in about two dozens of spectra of active galactic nuclei and black hole binaries .",
    "they are supposed to originate close to the black hole by the reflection of the primary radiation on the accretion disc .",
    "the spin of the black hole plays an important role in the forming of the line shape .",
    "especially , it determines the position of the marginally stable orbit which is supposed to confine the inner edge of the accretion disc ( see figure  [ intro ] ) .",
    "the innermost stable orbit occurs closer to a black hole with a higher spin value .",
    "however , the spin affects also the overall shape of the line .    over almost two decades",
    "the most widely used model of the relativistic disc spectral line has been the one by , which includes the effects of a maximally rotating kerr black hole . in other words",
    ", the laor model sets the dimensionless angular momentum @xmath1 to the canonical value of @xmath0  so that it can not be subject of the data fitting procedure .",
    "have relaxed this limitation and allowed @xmath1 to be fitted in the suite of ky models .",
    "other numerical codes have been developed independently by several groups ( , , ) and equipped with similar functionality .",
    "however , the laor model can still be used for evaluation of the spin if one identifies the inner edge of the disc with the marginally stable orbit . in this case",
    "the spin is actually estimated from the lower boundary of the broad line .",
    "the comparison of the laor and model is shown in the right panel of figure  [ intro ] .",
    "the other parameters of the relativistic line models are inclination angle @xmath2 , rest energy of the line @xmath3 , inner radius of the disc @xmath4 , outer radius of the disc @xmath5 , emissivity parameters @xmath6 , @xmath7 with the break radius @xmath8 .",
    "the emissivity of the line is given by @xmath9 for @xmath10 and @xmath11 for @xmath12 .",
    "the angular dependence of the emissivity is characterized by limb darkening profile @xmath13 in the laor model .",
    "the model enables to switch between different emission laws .",
    "we used further two extreme cases , the with the same limb - darkening law as in the laor model and * with the limb - brightening law @xmath14 .",
    "the aim of this paper is to compare the two models applied to the current data provided by the xmm - newton satellite , and to the artificial data generated for the on - coming x - ray mission . for this purpose",

    "we used the sas software version 7.1.2 ( http://xmm.esac.esa.int/sas ) to reduce the xmm - newton data of the sources .",

    "the 97@xmath22 of photons are lost during the reading cycle in this mode , which results into 2.25ks total exposure time .",
    "we rebinned all the data channels in order to oversample the instrumental energy resolution maximally by a factor of 3 and to have at least 20 counts per bin .",

    "the iron line is statistically better constrained for the active galaxy mcg-6 - 30 - 15 due to a significantly longer exposure time of the available observations  for comparison of count rates of the sources see table  3 .",
    "the spectra of both sources are well described by a continuum model plus a broad iron line model .",
