    "if elongated active , _ i.e. _ self - propelled , objects interact by pushing each other in a dissipative medium or substrate , the objects will tend to locally align  @xcite as shown in fig .",

    "since these object are self - propelled , once aligned , they will move together in the same direction for a given time .",
    "this simple effective alignment mechanism among active objects lead to interesting collective effects  @xcite , as the formation of moving cluster as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : myxo ] with experiments of myxobacteria .",
    "there is a broad range of real - world active systems that consist of active elongated object where this mechanism is at work : gliding bacteria  @xcite , dried self - propelled rods  @xcite , chemically - driven rods  @xcite , and it has been recently argued that also  neglecting hydrodynamic effects over steric effects  in swimming bacteria  @xcite and motility assays  @xcite .",
    "[ b ]    here , we review the large - scale properties of collections of active brownian elongated objects , in particular rods , moving in a dissipative medium / substrate .",
    "we address the problem by presenting three different models of decreasing complexity , which we refer to as model i , ii , and iii , respectively .",
    "model i is the full physical active brownian rod model introduced in  @xcite where particles exhibit a well - defined shape , possess an active force acting along the longest axis of the rod , and interact  via volume exclusion effects  by pushing each other . in model",
    "i there exists a coupling of local density , orientational order , and speed , known to lead to density instabilities and collective phenomena in other active models  @xcite .",
    "more importantly , in model i active stresses coexist with an an effective local alignment mechanism . due to the combined effect of these two elements , model i displays exciting new physics unseen in other active models , such as the formation of highly dynamical aggregates that constantly eject giant polar cluster containing thousands of active rods  @xcite .",
    "if we remove from model i the active force , we end up with an equilibrium system ( if noise terms have been adequately chosen ) . with the elongated rods interacting through steric repulsive forces ,",
    "onsager s argument on thin rods applies  @xcite and the system exhibits local nematic order above a given critical density .",
    "we discuss the possibility of local nematic order and quasi - long - ranged order ( qlro ) in two - dimensions by introducing model ii , which is a simplified version of model i without anactive force .",
    "model ii allows us to argue that the symmetry of the interaction potential in model i is nematic .",
    "we introduce model iii to show that the peculiar large - scale properties displayed by model i do not result , as has been argued , from the combined effect of self - propulsion and an effective nematic velocity alignment mechanism .",
    "model iii is an active version of model ii and a simplified version of model i without volume exclusion interactions .",
    "let us recall that hat most flocking models assume a velocity alignment mechanism whose symmetry is ferromagnetic  @xcite . from model iii , we learn that active particles with a nematic velocity alignment exhibit macroscopic nematic structures  @xcite , which are not present in model i , which displays polar order at short scales and highly dynamical , highly fluctuating phase - separated phase  @xcite .",
    "comparing model i , ii , and iii we disentangle the role of activity and interactions and identify the contribution of every modeling element . in particular",
    ", we find that by ignoring volume exclusion effects , local and global nematic order seems to be possible , while by adding steric interactions the system is dominated by the interplay of active stresses and local alignment , which prevents the formation of orientational order at large scales in two - dimensions .",
    "the physics of active elongated objects , despite its ubiquity in experimental systems , remains still poorly understood . here",
    ", we present a detailed state of the art of the unique collective properties of this fascinating physical system .",
    "let us consider @xmath0 active brownian rods ( abr ) moving in a two - dimensional space of linear size @xmath1 with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "each rod is driven by an active stress / force @xmath2 that is applied along the long axis of the particle .",
    "interactions among rods are modeled through a repulsive potential , which we denote , for the @xmath3-th particle , by @xmath4 .",
    "the substrate where the rods move acts as a momentum sink .",
    "there are three friction drag coefficients , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 , which correspond to the drags experienced by the rods as the rod moves along the long axis , perpendicular to it , or as it rotates , respectively . in the over - damped limit ,",

    "the interactions among the rods are modeled by a soft - core potential that penalizes particle overlapping . for the @xmath3-th rod",

    "( [ eq : evol_x ] ) , while requiring that @xmath21 and @xmath22 allow us to define a temperature , the resulting system is the equilibrium system of passive rods studied by onsager  @xcite to describe , in a simple way , rod - like liquid crystals in two - dimensions .",
    "let us recall that according to the so - called mermin - wagner theorem  @xcite , this equilibrium system in two - dimensions can not exhibit long - ranged order ( lro ) .",
    "furthermore , it is believed that this system exhibits ( in two - dimensions ) a defect - mediated phase transition analogous to the berezinskii - kosterlitz - thouless ( bkt ) transition  @xcite .",
    "this means that above a given critical point , the system exhibits quasi - long - ranged order ( qlro ) , implying that by increasing the system size , while keeping all intensive parameter fixed , the order parameter ( associated to orientational order ) decreases algebraically  . at the mean - field level , _",
    "i.e. _ by neglecting fluctuations , the equilibrium model ii displays an isotropic - nematic transition , which can be understood by considering two rods separated ( their center of mass ) a given distance @xmath45 . to simplify the reasoning ,",
    "let us neglect the dynamics of the center of mass of the rods and consider them fixed . in this scenario ,",
    "it is clear that if the interaction between the rods is modeled by an interaction potential that penalizes the overlapping of the rods ( as in model i ) , by making the orientation of the rods parallel to each other , we minimize the interaction potential ( moreover , particles may not even interact ) . in addition , since the interaction potential does not distinguish head and tail of the particles , it should be such that we obtain the same by flipping the orientation of one of the particles by @xmath46 .",
    "in short , the interaction potential has to be a function of overlapping area of the two rods , which is , as observed by onsager  @xcite , proportional to @xmath47 , where @xmath3 and @xmath28 refer to the label of the particles we are looking at .",
    "since @xmath48 , for simplicity we express the potential directly as : @xmath49 where the sum runs over all @xmath28 particles such that @xmath50 , with @xmath51 defining the interaction range , which we could assume to be @xmath52 , and @xmath53 a constant .",
    "this defines a simplified dynamics where the equation of motion of the @xmath3-th particle is given by : @xmath54 where @xmath55 and where we have simplified further the model by assuming that @xmath56 is an isotropic delta - correlated vectorial noise .",
    "it is important to stress that eqs .",
    "( [ eq : evol_x_model_ii ] ) and ( [ eq : evol_theta_model_ii ] ) do not correspond ( exactly ) to eqs .",
    "( [ eq : evol_x ] ) and ( [ eq : evol_theta ] ) with @xmath44 , but to a simplified version of model i for @xmath44 that shares the same symmetry .",
    "the fundamental difference between model i with @xmath44 and model ii is the absence of a term proportional to @xmath57 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : evol_x_model_ii ] ) . despite of this difference",

    "( [ eq : evol_x_model_ii ] ) and ( [ eq : evol_theta_model_ii ] ) to display a behavior analogous to that of model i with @xmath44 . we know that a system evolving according to eqs .",

    "( [ eq : evol_x_model_ii ] ) and ( [ eq : evol_theta_model_ii ] ) exhibit an isotropic - nematic transition , characterized by the absence of local and global polar order .",
    "we will use model ii as a reference model .",
    "the message is that in the absence of activity ( meaning for @xmath44 ) and in two - dimesions , we do not expect the system to exhibit lro but rather qlro .",
    "furthermore , from model ii we could imagine that if activity induces order at large scales ( _ i.e. _ lro ) such order should be nematic .",
    "we will see that this is the case in model iii , which we introduce next , but counterintuitive not for model i.      the third and final model we introduce here is an active version of model ii  @xcite .",
    "the equations of motion of the @xmath3-th particle are given by : @xmath58 where @xmath59 . despite the fact that the interaction potentials in model i and model iii are short - ranged and share the same symmetry",
    ", there is a fundamental difference between both models : the equation for @xmath60 in model iii does not possess a term @xmath57 .",
    "the absence of this term implies that in model iii there is no volume exclusion , and thus particles are point - like .",
    "as it will become clear below , this leads to the absence of active stresses in model iii , which are present in model i. due to this difference , which may appear at first glance minor , model i and iii exhibit qualitatively different large - scale properties .",
    "another difference between model i and iii is the absence of a noise terms in eq .",
    "( [ eq : evol_x_model_iii ] ) , while such terms are present in eq .",
    "( [ eq : evol_x ] ) .",
    "such noise terms do not have an impact on the ( qualitative ) large - scale properties of the systems .",
    "finally , the difference between model ii and iii is given by the so - called active term , @xmath61 , in eq .",

    "( [ eq : evol_x_model_ii ] ) .",
    "note that in model iii the equations for @xmath60 and @xmath62 are thus coupled through @xmath63 , while this does not occur in model ii .",
    "we will see below that the presence of the active term in model iii has a strong impact on the large - scale properties , which turn to be qualitatively different from those of model ii .",
    "we characterize the resulting macroscopic patterns by their level of orientational order through @xmath64 where the averages run over the number of particles and time .",

    "the @xmath67 and @xmath68 correspond to global order parameters , _",
    "i.e. _ obtained by performing an average over the entire system .",
    "local order parameters can be also defined and should be noticed that a system can exhibit no global order , while still displaying local order .",
    "the distribution of particles in space as well as information on the interaction structure can be studied by looking at the cluster size distribution ( csd ) .",
    "we use the ( weighted steady state ) csd @xmath69 defined as the time average ( after an initial transient ) of the instantaneous csd : @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the number of clusters of mass @xmath72 present in the system at time @xmath73 .",
    "notice that the normalization of this distribution is ensured since @xmath74 ( with @xmath0 the number of particles in the system as defined above ) .",
    "clusters are collections of interconnected particles , where any two particles are considered as ( directly ) connected if they interact to each other . for simplicity and to speed up the numerics , the criterion is usually relaxed and particles are considered as connected if they are separated a given distance which is typically of the order of the interaction radius ( the details vary from model to model ) .",
    "the functional form of @xmath69 indicates whether the system is `` homogeneous '' , when the csd displays an exponential tail , or phase - separated , when the csd exhibits a peak at large cluster sizes .",

    "global order patterns are not present in the thermodynamical limit , with the phase transition occurring , in this limit , between a disordered gas and a phase - separated state with no global orientational order .",
    "the reason for observing non - vanishing global order in small systems is the presence of few giant polar clusters as illustrated by the simulation snapshot in fig .",
    "[ fig : pt ] .",
    "such giant polar clusters can become so big and elongated that they can can even percolate the system , as shown in panel i ) of fig .",
    "[ fig : band ] .",
    "we refer to such polar percolating structures as bands . inside bands ,",
    "rods are densely packed , point into the same direction , and exhibit positional order .",
    "notice that these bands are distinct from the bands observed in the vicsek model , which are elongated in the direction orthogonal to the moving direction of the particles  @xcite .",
    "more importantly , the observed polar bands are also fundamentally different from those observed in model iii , where we saw that the point - like self - propelled particles form nematic bands , inside which 50% of the particles move in one direction and 50% in the opposite one . more importantly , our finite size study indicates that the polar patterns observed in abr are a finite size effect that disappear for large enough systems . in short , several of the phases reported for @xmath135 in",
    "previous abr works  @xcite such as the so - called swarming phase and the bio - turbulence phase vanish in the thermodynamical limit . the abrupt change in scaling of @xmath67 with @xmath0 in fig .",
    "[ fig : fss ] suggests that above the crossover system size @xmath154 the polar structures are no longer stable .",
    "arguably , the decay in @xmath67 with @xmath0 is due to the fact that rods inside polar clusters are densely packed and hold fixed positions , not being able to exchange neighbors in contrast to other active systems  @xcite .",
    "[ fig : band ] shows that @xmath155 , _",
    "i.e. _ the total time @xmath156 the system spends in the aggregate phase with respect to the total simulation time @xmath157 .",
    "we observe that @xmath156 increases with @xmath0 , in such a way that @xmath158as @xmath159 .",
    "this means that the probability of observing the system in an aggregate phase also increases with @xmath0 . for small system sizes",
    "@xmath160 we observe moving clusters and bands .",
    "large polar structures such as bands form , remain in the system for quite some time , and then quickly break and reform , typically adopting a new orientation . as @xmath161 ,",
    "bands survive for relatively short periods of time , and quickly bend and break . interestingly , at such large system sizes other macroscopic structures start to frequently emerge . these new macroscopic structures  which we refer to as _ aggregates _ ",
    "are formed by polar clusters of rods that exert stresses on each other and exhibit vanishing polar order , see panel ii ) of fig .  [",
    "fig : band ] . in summary , for @xmath162 , the system continuously transitions between highly ordered phases ",
    "e.g. phases with either a few giant polar clusters or a band  and aggregates , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : band ] . for system size",
    "larger than @xmath154 bands and polar phases disappear in the thermodynamical limit , while the aggregate phase survives .",
    "the transitions between aggregates and bands ( or highly ordered phases ) for @xmath162 results from the competition between elastic energy and the impossibility of the system to sustain long - range polar order . for not too large system sizes , _",
    "i.e. _ for @xmath163 , the shape of the aggregates is roughly circular ( fig .",
    "[ fig : band ] , panel ii ) ) and at the center of the aggregate we find one single topological defect : i.e. at the mesoscale , at the center of the aggregate we can not define an average orientation for the rods . due to the active forces , at the center of the aggregate rods are strongly compressed , which implies that the potentials @xmath4 adopts high values .",
    "this implies that when one of these aggregates is formed , the total elastic energy of the system @xmath164 increases . on the contrary , in large polar structures such as bands , rods are roughly parallel to each other and therefore are much less compressed by their neighbors , and",
    "the total elastic energy is low .",
    "the dynamics at @xmath162 can be summarized as follows .",
    "large polar clusters form and eventually a band emerges , but since the system is too big for the band to remain stable , at some point the band breaks .",
    "the collapse of the band gives rise to the formation of new giant polar clusters which eventually collide head on leading to a large aggregate : a process reminiscent of a traffic jam .",
    "the formation of the aggregate leads to a sharp increase of the total elastic energy .",
    "let us recall that forces and torques act in such a way that they tend to minimize @xmath4 . in short , the system relaxes by destroying the new formed aggregate , which give rise to the formation of new polar clusters and the cycle starts again . in larger system sizes ,",
    "i.e. for @xmath165 , aggregates are more complex .    inside aggregates ,",
    "the competition between active forces and local polar alignment leads to new physics .",
    "this is particularly evident for very large system sizes , i.e. for @xmath166 , that is when aggregates are big enough to exhibit multiple topological defects of the local orientation of the rods .",
    "let us recall that aggregates are formed by polar clusters of rods that are trapped inside these structures .",
    "topological defects are areas where , at the mesoscale , as mentioned above , we can not define an average orientation of the rods as illustrated in inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : aggregate ] ( areas where the arrows meet ) . in such areas , due to the active forces",
    ", rods are strongly compressed by the active push of all surrounding abr ( see inset in fig .  [",
    "fig : aggregate ] ) .",
    "since the compression is due to the presence of active forces , we refer to this phenomenon as _",
    "active stresses_. for @xmath166 , we observe the emergence of multiple defects that lead to an increase of the elastic energy and the build - up of stresses .",
    "notice that more topological defects imply larger values of the elastic energy .",
    "there are two clear consequence of the presence of multiple topological defects . on the one hand , aggregates are no longer roundish but rather irregular as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : aggregate ] . on the other hand ,",
    "now the system can relax the elastic energy by reducing the number of topological defects .",
    "notice that for @xmath162 , aggregates are relatively small and exhibit one topological defect , and thus , the only way to eliminate the topological defects is by destroying the aggregate . for @xmath166 ,",
    "given the presence of multiple topological defects , eliminating one topological defect does not require to eliminate the aggregate . as a matter of fact ,",
    "for very large system sizes , the interplay between topological defects and active stresses lead to large fluctuations of the aggregate boundary and aggregate mass ( i.e. aggregate size ) as indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig : aggregate ] .",
    "the most distinctive feature of the observed phenomenon is the large fluctuations experienced by the aggregate mass correspond to ejections of remarkably large macroscopic polar clusters from the aggregate , that can be as large as 10% of the system size ( i.e. involving more than @xmath167 rods ) , fig .",
    "[ fig : aggregate ] . by this process ,",
    "i.e. the ejection of large polar clusters , the aggregate manages to decrease its elastic energy .",
    "the ejected polar clusters typically dissolve while moving through the gas phase outside the aggregate , leading to a sudden increase of the gas density , top panel in fig .",
    "[ fig : aggregate ] .",
    "this results in a higher absorption rate of abr by the aggregate that starts again to increase its mass .",
    "the comparison of models i , ii , and iii is insightful .",
    "model ii and iii share the same interaction potential , which we refer here to as alignment mechanism : eq .",
    "( [ eq : evol_theta_model_ii ] ) is identical to ( [ eq : evol_theta_model_iii ] ) . despite of this , on large scales , model ii and model iii display qualitatively different features . while model ii exhibits for low noise values qlro , as expected for an equilibrium system with continuum symmetry in two - dimensions , model iii at low noise displays nematic lro  .",
    "the active term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : evol_theta_model_iii ] ) , @xmath168 , makes possible the emergence of stable nematic bands and an homogeneous nematically ordered phase ( phase i ) . in summary , in model ii we observe local nematic order and qlro at large scales , while in model iii we find again local nematic order and lro at large scales .",
    "importantly , at the meso and macroscopic sale model ii and iii do not exhibit polar order .    in model",
    "i , on the other hand , nematic order is never observed ( at least up to packing fractions @xmath169 ) .",
    "the difference between model i and model iii is due to the presence of the repulsive term @xmath57 in the equation for @xmath60 .",
    "we have learned that the addition of volume exclusion interactions in the evolution of the position of the particle has a dramatic effect on the large - scale properties of the system . at small system sizes and for large enough aspect ratios ( or equivalently packing fractions )",
    "particles self - organize into large moving polar clusters and the system displays global polar order . moreover , the observed bands are polar instead of being nematic as the ones observed in model iii .",
    "however , the performed finite size study reveals that polar order ( or any orientational order ) vanishes in the thermodynamical limit ( at least up to packing fractions @xmath169 ) .",
    "thus , from model i we learn that volume exclusion effects induce local polar and absence of orientational order at large scale . despite the lack of orientation order , model i undergoes a genuine phase - separation .",
    "the phase - separation process , as well as the phase - separated phase are qualitatively different from the ones observed in model iii , where the system spontaneous phase separates in the form of nematically ordered , high - density bands ( referred above as phase ii and iii ) . in model",
    "i , phase separation starts with the formation if giant polar clusters  @xcite that jam to form what we have called aggregates",
    ". the most distinctive feature of these aggregates is the constant ejection from the aggregate of thousands of particles in the form of densely packed and polarly ordered clusters , which leads to large fluctuation of the aggregate size and its boundary .",
    "this occurs due to the combined effect of an effective alignment mechanism ( also present in model iii ) and the active pushing ( or stresses ) acting among the particles that requires not only an active force but also a term @xmath57 in the evolution of the position of the particles .",
    "the combination of these elements ( active stresses and alignment ) is not present in other active system , making the physics of active brownian rods unique .",
    "for instance , self - propelled disks ( spd ) exhibit active stresses but no alignment among the spd  @xcite .",
    "thus , phase separation in spd resembles a classical coarsening process  @xcite which can be described by an effective cahn - hilliard equation  @xcite . finally , it important to stress that the phase separation in model i is different from the one observed in active system with an alignment mechanism and a density - dependent speed  @xcite . here , while alignment among particles is present , there are no active stresses  .    in summary",
    ", we have characterized the large - scale properties of abr for packing fractions smaller than or equal to @xmath169 .",
    "we have shown that large - scale ( orientational ) order patterns can not exist in the thermodynamic limit for ( physical ) abr ( _ i.e. _ in model i ) due to combined effect of active stresses and alignment , which leads to exciting new physics . in particular , we have seen that the interplay of these two elements ( active stresses and alignment ) gives rise to a novel highly fluctuating phase - separated phase characterized by the ejection of giant polar clusters .",
    "we point out that the presented evidence can not be used to preclude the emergence of orientational order at higher packing fractions .",
    "let us recall that even for brownian rods we expect for large enough packing fractions some kind of isotropic - nematic transition . in simulations with abr at",
    "high packing a transition to laning has been reported  @xcite .",
    "the observed laning phase may remain even in the thermodynamic limit , though its existence should be confirmed by a careful finite size study .",
    "finally , the model presented in  @xcite for penetrable abr suggested a possible crossover between the large - scale properties exhibited by model i and iii . while this scenario can not be _ a priori _ excluded in  @xcite , a finite size study may reveal some of the reported phases vanish in the thermodynamical limit ."
