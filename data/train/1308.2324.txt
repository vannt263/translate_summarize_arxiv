    "the portfolio selection problem published by markowitz @xcite in 1952 is formulated as an optimization problem in a one - period static setting with the objective of maximizing expected return , subject to the constraint of variance being bounded from above . in 2005 ,",
    "bielecki et al . @xcite",
    "published the solution to this problem in a dynamic complete market setting . in both cases ,",
    "the measure of risk of the portfolio is chosen as variance , and the risk - reward problem is understood as the `` mean - variance '' problem . much research has been done in developing risk measures that focus on extreme events in the tail distribution where the portfolio loss occurs ( variance does not differentiate loss or gain ) , and quantile - based models have thus far become the most popular choice . among those ,",
    "conditional value - at - risk ( cvar ) developed by rockafellar and uryasev @xcite and @xcite , also known as expected shortfall by acerbi and tasche @xcite , has become a prominent candidate to replace variance in the portfolio selection problem . on the theoretical side , cvar is a `` coherent risk measure '' , a term coined by artzner et al . @xcite and @xcite in pursuit of an axiomatic approach for defining properties that a ` good ' risk measure should possess . on the practical side , the convex representation of cvar from rockafellar and uryasev @xcite opened the door of convex optimization for mean - cvar problem and gave it vast advantage in implementation . in a one - period static setting ,",
    "rockafellar and uryasev @xcite demonstrated how linear programming can be used to solve the mean - cvar problem , making it a convincing alternative to the markowitz @xcite mean - variance concept .    the work of rockafellar and uryasev @xcite has raised huge interest for extending this approach .",
    "acerbi and simonetti @xcite , and adam et al .",
    "@xcite generalized cvar to spectral risk measure in a static setting .",
    "spectral risk measure is also known as weighted value - at - risk ( wvar ) by cherny @xcite , who in turn studied its optimization problem .",
    "ruszczynsk and shapiro @xcite revised cvar into a multi - step dynamic risk measure , namely the  conditional risk mapping for cvar \" , and solved the corresponding mean - cvar problem using rockafellar and uryasev @xcite technique for each time step . when expected return is replaced by expected utility , the utility - cvar portfolio optimization problem is often studied in a continuous - time dynamic setting , see gandy @xcite and zheng @xcite .",

    "no complete characterization of solution has been done for the mean - cvar problem in a continuous - time dynamic setting .",
    "similar to bielecki et al .",
    "@xcite , we reduce the problem to a combination of a static optimization problem and a hedging problem with complete market assumption .",
    "our main contribution is that in solving the static optimization problem , we find a complete characterization whose nature is different than what is known in literature . as a pure cvar minimization problem without expected return constraint ,",
    "sekine @xcite , li and xu @xcite , melnikov and smirnov @xcite found the optimal solution to be binary .",
    "this is confirmed to be true for more general law - invariant risk ( preference ) measures minimization by schied @xcite , and he and zhou @xcite .",
    "the key to finding the solution to be binary is the association of the mean - cvar problem to the neyman - pearson problem .",
    "we observe in section [ subsection : outline ] that the stochastic part of cvar minimization can be transformed into shortfall risk minimization using the representation ( cvar is the fenchel - legendre dual of the expected shortfall ) given by rockafellar and uryasev @xcite .",
    "fllmer and leukert @xcite characterized the solution to the latter problem in a general semimartingale complete market model to be binary , where they have demonstrated its close relationship to the neyman - pearson problem of hypothesis testing between the risk neutral probability measure @xmath0 and the physical probability measure @xmath1 .    adding the expected return constraint to wvar minimization ( cvar is a particular case of wvar )",
    ", cherny @xcite found conditions under which the solution to the mean - wvar problem was still binary or nonexistent . in this paper , we discuss all cases for solving the mean - cvar problem depending on a combination of two criteria : the level of the radon - nikodm derivative @xmath2 relative to the confidence level of the risk measure ; and the level of the return requirement . more specifically , when the portfolio is uniformed bounded from above and below , we find the optimal solution to be nonexistent or binary in some cases , and more interestingly , take three values in the most important case ( see case 4 of theorem [ t : solution to step 2 ] ) . when the portfolio is unbounded from above , in most cases ( see case 2 and 4 in theorem [ t : unbounded above ] ) , the solution is nonexistent , while portfolios of three levels still give sub - optimal solutions .",
    "since the new solution we find can take not only the upper or the lower bound , but also a level in between , it can be viewed in part as a generalization of the binary solution for the neyman - pearson problem with an additional constraint on expectation .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ section : portfolio selection ] formulates the dynamic portfolio selection problem , and compares the structure of the binary solution and the ` three - level ' solution , with an application of exact calculation in the black - scholes model .",

    "in addition , we require uniform lower bound @xmath20 and upper bound @xmath21 on the value of the portfolio over time such that @xmath22 .",
