    "multifragmentation ( mf ) is the dominant decay mode in heavy ion reactions when the excitation energy is comparable to the nuclear binding energy .",
    "the recent use of 4@xmath22 detectors capable of observing a substantial fraction of the particles and fragments emitted in a given interaction has been invaluable in furthering the elucidation of this complex phenomenon @xcite .",
    "several review articles of mf have been published in recent years @xcite .",
    "one of the most complete mf experiments to date has been that performed by the eos collaboration for the @xmath23au on c system @xcite . the use of seamless detectors such as the eos time projection chamber coupled with the multiple sampling ionization chamber ( music ii ) permitted the observation of practically all the charged particles and fragments emitted in each event , ranging from protons to heavy fragments .",
    "full reconstruction was therefore possible for a large fraction of the events .",
    "the high energy asymmetric collision of a 1a gev projectile on a light target is uniquely favorable for the kinematic separation of the initial nuclear collision and the subsequent mf transition .",
    "this data set permitted us to establish that mf occurs following the expansion of a remnant formed with charge @xmath1 , mass @xmath0 and excitation energy @xmath2 after the prompt ejection of high momentum light particles @xcite .",
    "we have applied model independent methods used in the study of critical phenomena to extract the value of several critical exponents @xcite .",
    "the critical scaling function , which describes the behavior of the nuclear remnant near a critical point , was determined @xcite . in performing this analysis",
    "we were aided by percolation calculations @xcite , which served as a quantitative guide to the application of the methods developed for the study of critical exponents in small systems .",
    "the eos experiment was an outgrowth of earlier inclusive studies of mf in the interaction of xe and kr with high - energy protons @xcite . in this work high precision counter techniques",
    "were used to obtain accurate information about the kinetic energy spectra of _ isotopically _ resolved nuclear fragments . the reduced coulomb barrier seen in the fragment spectra indicated that nuclear fragments are emitted from an expanded nuclear system .",
    "systematics of the fragment kinetic energy spectra also showed that the remnant was lighter than the target nucleus implying that _ the nuclear remnant existed for a time _ after the initial collision .",
    "the relative fragment yields of 63 isotopes could be understood using a thermal droplet model @xcite with a free energy parameterization based on the semi - empirical mass formula . for energy depositions of @xmath248 mev per nucleon",
    "this multi - isotope thermometer gave a freezeout temperature of @xmath245 mev .",
    "the systematic variation of the `` kinetic temperature '' ( exponential slope parameter extracted from fragment kinetic energy spectra ) as a function of the fragment mass also indicated that fermi momentum in the remnant must play a significant role in the fragment formation process .",
    "more speculative was the suggestion that the power law yield of the fragment masses y=@xmath25 with @xmath262.6 observed in 50 - 400 gev p on xe collisions showed that nuclear fragmentation might give information about a possible `` liquid - gas '' thermal phase transition in charged nuclear matter @xcite .",
    "important support for this view came from the exclusive emulsion data of waddington and freier @xcite , which were analyzed by campi to show that the conditional moments of the individual fragment events exhibited features characteristic of a critical transition @xcite .",
    "the occurrence of thermal equilibrium in the mf process was strongly supported by the experiments of the aladin collaboration , which showed that fragment yields were independent of the entrance channel when the data was scaled for projectile or target mass @xcite .",
    "the above cited evidence for the formation of a substantially equilibrated remnant which expands prior to mf suggests that it would be appropriate to compare the eos results with a thermal model in which mf occurs from an expanded state .",
    "two widely used thermal multifragmentation models are the copenhagen ( smm ) @xcite and berlin ( mmmc ) @xcite statistical treatments .",
    "these models differ in their parameterization of the expansion and in technical details but are similar in their thermodynamic approach .",
    "for very small systems both these microcanonical models predict the onset of a very inhomogeneous state at a definite excitation energy .",
    "this inhomogeneous excited state consists of a number of normal density fragments accompanied by a statistically insignificant number of nucleons .",
    "subsequently these fragments cool by light particle emission .",
    "we present here a comparison of the eos data with smm .",
    "several data and model comparisons have been made previously @xcite .",
    "these comparisons seriously suffered from the fact that the experiments did not determine the @xmath1 , @xmath0 , and @xmath27 of the remnant . instead , these @xmath1 , @xmath0 , @xmath2 values , which constitute the proper input to test models of mf , were obtained either by use of a dynamical first stage model @xcite , by using a comparison of some of the data with smm to constrain them @xcite , or by more complex backtracing from fragment data @xcite .",
    "a great advantage afforded by asymmetric reverse kinematics collisions is that they permit an accurate separation of the initial reaction phase from the subsequent decay of the excited remnant .",
    "the use of smm also permits us to examine several aspects of the eos critical exponent analysis that are potentially problematic .",
    "the eos results were obtained for fragments in their final , cold state .",
    "however , the fragments are presumably formed in an expanded hot state . in smm",
    "the remnant is equilibrated , the fragments are formed in the hot system , then separate under the influence of the coulomb force and undergo deexcitation . as has been noted elsewhere @xcite , the distribution of the hot ,",
    "primary fragments may be affected by secondary decay .",
    "the difference between the two distributions could , in principle , affect the values of the critical exponents .",
    "since smm gives separate results for hot and cold fragments , the effects of secondary decay can be probed .",
    "the eos results indicate that the first prompt step leads to a distribution of remnants .",
    "the analysis groups these remnants according to the total charged particle multiplicity , @xmath28 , which serves as the control parameter .",
    "events characterized by a given multiplicity will generally include a range of remnant @xmath29 values .",
    "it has been noted that such event mixing can affect the values of the critical exponents @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the use of multiplicity instead of temperature or excitation energy as the control parameter has been questioned @xcite .",
    "comparison of smm results obtained for the experimental distribution of remnants with those obtained for a single remnant permits us to probe the importance of these effects .",
    "this paper is organized in the following manner .",
    "section ii gives a brief summary of smm and shows how the data determine the variable volume of smm .",
    "only a single adjustable parameter remains .",
    "section iii summarizes the properties of the experimental remnant distribution , which serves as the input data to smm .",

    "the comparison between experimental and model results is presented in section iv .",
    "the various factors that can affect the fragment yields , the extraction of critical exponents , and the critical multiplicity are considered in section v. in sec .",
    "vi , the physics of mf and the nature of the thermal phase transition in smm as a function of the remnant mass and charge is explored .",
    "the identification of the order of a thermal phase transition for the mf of au on c requires the use of the microcanonical equation of state .",
    "a summary of the results and our conclusions are given in section vii .",
    "smm is a statistical description of the simultaneous breakup of an expanded excited nucleus into nucleons and hot fragments @xcite .",
    "individual fragments at normal nuclear density are described with a charged liquid drop parameterization .",
    "the free energy of a fragment @xmath30 is given by @xmath31 and is used to determine the fragment formation probability .",

    "the critical temperature , at which the surface tension of neutral nuclear matter droplets would go to zero , is in the range suggested by infinite neutral nuclear matter calculations @xcite .    in smm",
    "the translational free energy depends on the _ free _ volume .",
    "the free volume , @xmath34 , can be expressed in terms of the volume of the multifragmenting system at normal nuclear density , @xmath35 , @xmath36 where the free volume parameter @xmath37 depends on the smm fragment multiplicity according to the relation : @xmath38 ^ 3 -1\\ ] ] where @xmath39=1.17 @xmath40 fm and @xmath41 is the _ charged plus neutral _ hot fragment multiplicity .",

    "the freeze out volume calculated in our earlier publication @xcite is different as it was obtained using initial volume of au nucleus and not the remnant volume .",
    "thus , experiment confirms the structure ( m dependence ) and scale ( crack width parameter @xmath42 ) of the volume parameterization of smm for the 1a gev au on c experiment .",
    "in addition to these experimental arguments , theoretical arguments based on buu modeling of the nuclear collision @xcite also suggest that the expansion of the remnant is energy dependent .",

    "<S> multifragmentation ( mf ) results from 1a gev au on c have been compared with the copenhagen statistical multifragmentation model ( smm ) . the complete charge , mass and momentum reconstruction of the au projectile was used to identify high momentum ejectiles leaving an excited remnant of mass @xmath0 , charge @xmath1 and excitation energy @xmath2 which subsequently multifragments . </S>",
    "<S> measurement of the magnitude and multiplicity ( energy ) dependence of the initial free volume and the breakup volume determines the variable volume parameterization of smm . </S>",
    "<S> very good agreement is obtained using smm with the standard values of the smm parameters . </S>",
    "<S> a large number of observables , including the fragment charge yield distributions , fragment multiplicity distributions , caloric curve , critical exponents , and the critical scaling function are explored in this comparison . </S>",
    "<S> the two stage structure of smm is used to determine the effect of cooling of the primary hot fragments . </S>",
    "<S> average fragment yields with @xmath3 are essentially unaffected when the excitation energy is @xmath4 7 mev / nucleon . </S>",
    "<S> smm studies suggest that the experimental critical exponents are largely unaffected by cooling and event mixing . </S>",
    "<S> the nature of the phase transition in smm is studied as a function of the remnant mass and charge using the microcanonical equation of state . for light remnants </S>",
    "<S> @xmath5 100 , backbending is observed indicating negative specific heat , while for @xmath6 170 the effective latent heat approaches zero . </S>",
    "<S> thus for heavier systems this transition can be identified as a continuous thermal phase transition where a large nucleus breaks up into a number of smaller nuclei with only a minimal release of constituent nucleons . </S>",
