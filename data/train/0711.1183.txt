    "the muon neutrino - nucleon inclusive charged current ( -n cc ) cross - section has been well measured at high neutrino energies ( @xmath5  gev ) , primarily by the ccfr  @xcite and the cdhsw  @xcite experiments .",
    "the average absolute -n cc cross - section , where ` n ' is a nucleon in an isoscalar target , above  of 30  gev , @xmath6gev , is measured to a 2.1% precision .",
    "in contrast the @xmath7 is imprecisely measured below 30  gev .",
    "previous measurements are shown in figure  [ figure - fine - cc - crs ] and summarised in  @xcite .",
    "accurate determination of @xmath7 below  of 30  gev is of interest in its own right , and offers insight into cc processes such as quasi - elastic and resonance interactions , and their transition into the deep inelastic scattering region .",
    "the current and the proposed long baseline neutrino experiments , such as minos and no@xmath8a at fermilab and t2k in japan , address the atmospheric @xmath8 oscillations at the mass - difference , @xmath9  ev@xmath10 . given their typical flight path of a few hundred kilometers , they use neutrino beams with energies well below 30  gev .",
    "cross sections in this region should be precisely known to accurately interpret the results of these experiments .",
    "the nomad data are suitable for such a precision @xmath7 measurement due to the large @xmath8-interaction sample , good low - energy resolution and a @xmath11 flux which spans @xmath12  gev with a mean energy of 24.3  gev .",
    "the neutrino oscillation magnetic detector ( nomad ) experiment at cern used a neutrino beam produced by the 450  gev sps - protons striking a beryllium target and producing secondary @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 mesons .",
    "the positively charged mesons were focussed by a system of collimators , a magnetic horn and a reflector into a 290  m long evacuated decay pipe .",
    "decays of @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 produced the sps neutrino beam .",
    "the average flight path of the neutrinos to the nomad was 628  m ; the detector being 836  m downstream of the be - target . the sps beamline and the neutrino flux incident at nomad are described in  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "nomad was designed to search for  oscillations at @xmath16  ev@xmath10 , and in this @xmath17 range it set the current best limit on this search  @xcite .",
    "the experiment recorded over 1.7 million neutrino interactions in its active drift - chamber ( dc ) target .",
    "these data are unique in that they constitute the largest high resolution neutrino data sample with accurate identification of , , , and   in the energy range @xmath18  gev . in addition , upstream of the active - dc target , the experiment recorded over 2 million @xmath8-interactions in the al - coil , and over 20 million in the fe - scintillator calorimeter ( fcal ) .    the nomad apparatus , described in  @xcite , was composed of several sub - detectors .",
    "the active target comprised 132 planes of @xmath19  m@xmath10 drift chambers with an average density similar to that of liquid hydrogen ( 0.1  gm/@xmath20 )  @xcite . on average , the equivalent material in the dc encountered by particles produced in a @xmath8-interaction was about @xmath21 and a quarter of an interaction length ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "the fiducial mass of the nomad dc - target , composed primarily of carbon ( 64% ) , oxygen ( 22% ) , nitrogen ( 6% ) , and hydrogen ( 5% ) , was 2.7 tons .",
    "the measured composition of the target was 52.43% protons and 47.57% neutrons .",
    "the correction for non - isoscalarity was about 5% .",
    "downstream of the dc , there were nine modules of transition radiation detectors ( trd ) , followed by a preshower ( prs ) and a lead - glass electromagnetic calorimeter ( ecal ) .",
    "the ensemble of dc , trd , and prs / ecal was placed within a dipole magnet providing a 0.4  t magnetic field . outside",
    "the magnet was a hadron calorimeter ( hcal ) , followed by two muon - stations comprising large area drift chambers separated by an iron filter .",
    "the two muon - stations , placed at 8- and 13-@xmath22 downstream of the ecal , provided a clean identification of the muons .",
    "the charged tracks in the dc were measured with an approximate momentum ( p ) resolution of @xmath23 , @xmath24 in gev and @xmath25 in meters , with unambiguous charge separation in the energy range of interest .",
    "the @xmath26 component of the @xmath8-hadronic jet was measured by the ecal with a resolution of @xmath27 .",
    "the detailed individual reconstruction of each charged and neutral track and their precise momentum vector measurement enabled a quantitative description of the event kinematics : the strength and basis of nomad analyses . in a @xmath28-cc interaction , in addition to the three traditional variables , energy ( @xmath29 ) , angle ( @xmath30 ) of the emergent muon , and the hadron energy ( @xmath31 ) , the detector uniquely offered a measurement of the missing transverse momentum ( ) vector in a plane transverse to the neutrino direction .",
    "the @xmath7 was measured by dividing the fully corrected -cc data by the corresponding -flux as a function of @xmath32 .",
    "we first describe the measurement of the numerator . in a -cc interaction , the neutrino energy ( @xmath32 )",
    "was measured by adding the energies of the muon ( ) and particles composing the hadron - jet ( ) yielding the total visible energy ( @xmath33 ) of the interaction .",
    "the observed cc - data , binned in  commensurate with resolution and statistics , were corrected for the detector acceptance , the efficiency of the cross section selection cuts , and the reconstruction smearing effects using -cc monte carlo ( mc ) samples .    to produce a clean sample of -cc events ,",
    "the following selection criteria were imposed .",
    "since the @xmath7 analysis was entirely dominated by systematic errors , more stringent fiducial cuts were imposed than those used in statistical - error limited analyses such as  @xcite .",
    "next , a successful match between a drift chamber track to track - segments in both muon chambers yielded the muon identification ( @xmath34-id ) . the polar angle of the muon with respect to the incident neutrino direction , @xmath30 , was required to be less than 0.5 radians .",
    "the @xmath35  gev cut , dictated by the thickness of the hcal preceding the first muon station , defined the low energy limit of our measurement .",
    "finally , for the 1-track sample a cut on the transverse muon - momentum , @xmath36  gev@xmath10 , was used to eliminate the inverse muon decay events with minimal loss of efficiency .",
    "the standard nomad @xmath8-event generator , neglib , and the detailed monte carlo simulation was based upon lepto 6.1  @xcite and jetset  @xcite generators for neutrino interactions and on a geant  @xcite based program for the detector response .",
    "the parton content of the nucleon were taken from ref .",
    "the -mc included deep - inelastic scattering ( dis ) , resonance ( res ) , and quasi - elastic ( qe ) processes . the relative abundance of dis : res : qe samples , averaged over the -flux , was taken to be 1.0:0.031:0.024 .",
    "the ( qe+res ) to dis , and qe to res , cross sections were separately varied by @xmath37 and the resulting small difference in @xmath7 was taken as a systematic error .",
    "the acceptance computed using the total number of generated mc in the standard nomad fiducial volume  @xcite and the corresponding number of reconstructed mc events passing event selection cuts took into account the bias in the true average energy due to the event reconstruction and selection process .",
    "it should be noted that the standard nomad fiducial volume used for generated mc ( the denominator in acceptance calculation ) was about 22% larger than that used for the reconstructed sample . a small impurity ( 0.7% ) due to neutral - current ( nc ) , from @xmath8 and @xmath38 interactions , induced @xmath39-sample",
    "was corrected using the nc - mc estimation .",
    "the effects of the selection cuts on data and monte carlo are summarized in table  [ table - cutcc ] .",
    "cross - section measurements require a knowledge of the @xmath8-flux .",
    "neutrinos in the sps beam were mainly from @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath34 decays .",
    "the uncertainty in modeling these secondary particles , and hence the @xmath8-flux , was  and for all the @xmath7 measurements has been  the dominant source of systematic error .",
    "fortunately for nomad , a dedicated measurement of @xmath40/k yields in 450  gev p - be collision at various secondary energies and angles was undertaken by the spy experiment  @xcite .",
    "the spy measurement of the @xmath42 yields was carried out at discrete energies spanning 7 to 135  gev , and a detailed transverse - momentum ( @xmath43 ) scan at 15 and 40  gev that were especially useful to the present measurement .",
    "a previous measurement of @xmath40/k yield in a 400  gev p - be collision by atherton @xmath44 @xmath45  @xcite was also used in the @xmath8-flux determination .",
    "other systematic uncertainties in the -flux determination arose from the variation in the position of the primary proton beam and the simulation of the propagation of secondaries through the beam line .",
    "the energy dependent relative  flux errors  @xcite were the largest source of systematic error in this analysis .    in this analysis",
    "only the relative @xmath11-flux , i.e. number of  in @xmath32 bins , obtained using the spy / atherton measurements , was used .",
    "the absolute normalization of the -flux was fixed using the world average of @xmath46 above 40  gev .",
    "the absolute flux normalisation was computed in the following energy regions : 40 - 100  gev , 40 - 150  gev , 50 - 150  gev , and 50 - 200  gev .",
    "variations in the normalisation , from these control regions , bracketed the error in the absolute flux normalisation process .",
    "in addition , the 2.1% error in world average cross section was included into our error calculation .",
    "in what follows , we enumerate sources of systematic errors affecting the numerator . the muon identification - efficiency and energy - scale were the two most important measurables in the @xmath7 analysis .",
    "first , a precise understanding of the muon - chamber efficiency and stability was crucial . in a dedicated run in 1996 during the gap between the two neutrino spills from the sps",
    ", we accumulated a large statistics of muons .",
    "this ` flat - top @xmath34 ' sample was identified by the veto - counter and the most upstream dcs .",
    "the energy spectrum of the flat - top muon sample , spanning 4 to 50  gev with a mean energy of 16  gev , was similar to that induced by the -cc events .",
    "the measured absolute efficiency of the @xmath34-id for this sample was 99.96% , in agreement with a detailed monte carlo simulation of the flat - top muons .",
    "next , we studied the stability of the @xmath34-identification by using the fraction of events with an identified muon , @xmath47 $ ] , as a function of time spanning 1995 through 1998 , and as a function of 15 sections of the muon chambers .",
    "the @xmath48 was stable to better than 1% over this four - year period .",
    "the distribution of @xmath48 , measured over 47 running periods , was consistent with a gaussian distribution with an error in the mean of 0.15% .",
    "these consistency between data and mc simulation of @xmath34-identification ensured the accuracy of the -cc efficiency computed by the monte carlo .    in nomad ,",
    "the @xmath29-scale was determined by the accurately measured b - field and a precise dc - alignment accomplished by using several million beam muons traversing the detector throughout the neutrino runs .",
    "the momentum scale was checked by using the invariant mass ( @xmath49 ) of over 30,000 reconstructed @xmath50 in the cc and nc data . for the @xmath50-momenta above 1  gev ( 5  gev )",
    ", the data yielded 30,831 ( 13,765 ) @xmath50 with an average @xmath51  mev ( @xmath52  mev ) ; the corresponding mc , with a + 0.25% shift in momentum , yielded @xmath53  mev ( @xmath54  mev ) . the error in the average was estimated by rms ( = 12  mev)/@xmath55 , where @xmath56 was the number of @xmath50 .",
    "in contrast , if the momentum were shifted by -0.5% , the mc would yield @xmath57  mev in disagreement with the data . the systematic error on the @xmath29-scale",
    "was determined to be 0.2% .",
    "neutrino - induced hadron jets , including charged and neutral particle multiplicity and fragmentation , are poorly understood resulting in a discrepancy between the hadronic energy of data and mc . we reduced this discrepancy by correcting the simulated hadronic energy @xmath31 by a constant factor @xmath58 , based on the distribution of @xmath59 in monte carlo and data .",
    "we relied on the precise measurement of @xmath29 . to determine the @xmath58 trials were made to minimize the @xmath60 between data and mc @xmath61- and @xmath31-distributions , for events with @xmath62  gev , by varying @xmath58 from 0.9 to 1.1 in steps of 0.002 in the mc .",
    "the @xmath60 was minimised at @xmath58 of 0.950 , @xmath63 the mc overestimated  by 5% .",
    "the comparison of the @xmath61 distribution between data and the uncorrected - mc is shown in figure  [ fig - dtmc - ybj - eh : a ] , where @xmath64 is @xmath65 . the corresponding comparison after correcting the mc-@xmath31 is shown in figure  [ fig - dtmc - ybj - eh : b ] , where @xmath64 is @xmath66 . to determine the error on @xmath58 we formed a ` scaled'-@xmath60 which yielded the scaled-@xmath64 equal to unity at @xmath58 of 0.950 .",
    "this was achieved by increasing the errors by 40% .",
    "figure  [ fig - dtmc - ybj - eh : c ] shows the scaled-@xmath60 as a function of @xmath58",
    ". an increase of 1.0 from the minimum in the the scaled-@xmath60 ( see the inset ) was used to set the uncertainty on the optimum @xmath58 value of @xmath67 .",
    "additionally , the fiducial and kinematic cuts were varied and the range in @xmath58 was redetermined for unity variation in the scaled-@xmath60 .",
    "we concluded that an error of @xmath68 bracketed the error on @xmath58 .",
    "since @xmath58 was determined over the entire range of @xmath32 , to cover possible variations in @xmath58 as a function of @xmath32 , we increased the scale - error by 50% . correcting @xmath31 in the mc by @xmath58 also improved the agreement between the data and mc distributions of other kinematic variables : @xmath69 , @xmath70 , and @xmath71 where the improvement was comparable to that shown in figure  [ fig - dtmc - ybj - eh : b ] .",
    "the @xmath31 correction factor determined in this analysis is closer to unity than the value of 0.93 used in our previous analyses  @xcite because of better tuning of the monte carlo and a reprocessing of the data that improved the reconstruction of high multiplicity events .",
    "the difference in the @xmath7 due to the @xmath72 uncertainty on @xmath58 was computed and assigned as the systematic error .",
    "this systematic uncertainty would have to be a factor of 2.5 times larger to make it one of the dominant systematic errors in the analysis .",
    "although the 0.9% error in the @xmath31-scale is adequate for the present inclusive @xmath7 measurement , efforts are underway to reduce this error to the 0.5% level using improved modeling  @xcite and analysis for the future -cc differential cross - section as a function of @xmath32 , @xmath71 , and @xmath61 , and the weak mixing angle measurements .",
    "table  [ table - errors ] lists the systematic errors on the @xmath73 as a function of visible energy .",
    "+    radiative corrections  @xcite that affected measurables , such as @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 , were folded into the @xmath7 measurement as a function of @xmath32 .",
    "the dominant radiative effect , typically less than 1% on @xmath74 , occurred when a photon , radiated by the muon , was measured as part of the hadronic system .",
