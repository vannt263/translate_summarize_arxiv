    "acoustoelasticity is now a well established experimental technique used for the non - destructive measurement of third - order elasticity ( toe ) constants of solids , and its principles can be found in standard handbooks of physical acoustics , such as @xcite . the underlying theory , however , is quite intricate , and over the years several authors have produced different and irreconcilable expressions for the shift experienced by the wave speed when elastic wave propagation is coupled to a pre - strain .",
    "a common mistake found in the literature consists of the implicit assumption that since a small pre - strain and a small - amplitude wave are described by linearized equations , they can be superposed linearly . with that point of view , the coupling between the two phenomena is of higher order and can be neglected in the first approximation .",
    "the flaw in that reasoning is simply that these phenomena are _ successive _ , not linearly superposed .",
    "experiencing an infinitesimal pre - strain from a stress - free configuration is a linear process ; propagating an infinitesimal wave in a stress - free configuration is another linear process .",
    "but in acoustoelasticity , the wave travels in a pre - stressed , not a stress - free solid , and the laws of linear elastodynamics must be adapted to reflect this fact .",
    "the final outcome of this analysis is that not only second - order , but also toe constants appear in the expression for the speed of an acoustoelastic wave .",
    "for example , a longitudinal wave travelling in a solid subject to a hydrostatic stress @xmath1 will propagate with the speed @xmath2 given by @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the mass density _ in the unstressed configuration _ ,",
    "@xmath5 and @xmath6 are the ( second - order ) lam coefficients , and @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 are the ( third - order ) landau coefficients @xcite .",
    "this equation was correctly established as early as 1925 by brillouin and confirmed in 1953 by hughes and kelly , although several erroneous expressions have appeared in between and since ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .    from our contemporary perspective , the easiest way to re - establish and further this expression is to rely on the modern theory of incremental ( also known as small - on - large ) elasticity , which presents compact expressions for the tensor of _ instantaneous elastic moduli _ , @xmath10 , given by its components @xmath11 & \\mathcal{a}_{0ijij } = j^{-1}\\frac{\\lambda_i w_i - \\lambda_j w_j}{\\lambda_i^2 -\\lambda_j ^2 } \\lambda_i^2 , & i \\ne j , \\ ; \\lambda_i \\ne \\lambda_j , \\\\[1ex ] & \\mathcal{a}_{0ijji } = j^{-1}\\frac{\\lambda_j w_i - \\lambda_i w_j}{\\lambda_i^2 -\\lambda_j ^2 } \\lambda_i \\lambda_j , & i \\ne j , \\ ; \\lambda_i \\ne \\lambda_j , \\\\[1ex ] & \\mathcal{a}_{0ijij } = j^{-1 } ( \\lambda_i^2 w_{ii } - \\lambda_i\\lambda_jw_{ij } + \\lambda_i w_i)/2 , &   i \\ne j , \\ ; \\lambda_i = \\lambda_j,\\\\[1ex ] & \\mathcal{a}_{0ijji } = j^{-1 } ( \\lambda_i^2 w_{ii } - \\lambda_i\\lambda_jw_{ij } - \\lambda_i w_i)/2 , &   i \\ne j , \\ ; \\lambda_i = \\lambda_j ,   \\end{aligned } \\right .",

    "the corresponding principal cauchy stresses are given by @xmath17 .",
    "it is worth noting here for later reference that it follows from @xmath18 that @xmath19    a small - amplitude body wave may travel at speed @xmath20 in the direction of the unit vector @xmath21 with polarization in the direction of a unit vector @xmath22 provided the eigenvalue problem @xmath23 is solved with @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the _",
    "acoustic tensor _ , which has components @xmath26 note that sometimes the acoustic tensor is defined by _ without _ the factor @xmath27 , in which case the @xmath4 in would be replaced by the density in the deformed configuration , i.e. @xmath28 .",
    "notice that in this theory the amplitude of the acoustic wave is infinitesimal , but that there is _ no restriction _ on the choice of @xmath12 or on the magnitude of the underlying pre - strain because we are in the context of _ finite _ nonlinear elasticity .",
    "it follows that the expressions can be specialized in various ways , in particular to _ weakly _ nonlinear elasticity ( where @xmath12 is expanded in terms of some measure of strain ) and to special pre - strains .    hence , to access the toe constants , we take @xmath12 as @xmath29 where @xmath30 , are invariants of the green  lagrange strain tensor @xmath31 .",
    "the components can then be expanded to the first order in terms of , for example , the volume change @xmath32 in the case of a hydrostatic pressure , or of the elongation @xmath33 in the case of uniaxial tension .    to access fourth - order elasticity ( foe ) constants ,",
    "we take @xmath12 as @xmath34 where @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 are the foe constants and we push the expansions of the wave speed up to the next order in the strain .",
    "this is what we refer to as the _ large acoustoelastic effect_. in fact , the main purpose of this investigation is to provide a theoretical backdrop to the current drive to determine experimentally the foe constants of soft solids such as isotropic tissues and gels in order to improve acoustic imaging resolution ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .    because soft solids are often treated as _",
    "incompressible _ , so that the constraint @xmath39 must be satisfied , we shall also consider the expressions for the toe and foe strain - energy densities in their incompressible specializations , specifically @xmath40 for toe incompressibility and @xmath41 for foe incompressibility .",
    "hence , in the transition from compressible to incompressible elasticity , the number of second - order constants goes from two to one , of third - order constants from three to one , and of fourth - order constants from four to one .",
    "this was established by hamilton et al . in 2004 , although it can be traced back to ogden in 1974 and even earlier , to bland in 1969 .",
    "specifically , in that transition we note that the elasticity constants behave as @xcite @xmath42 for the second - order constants , where @xmath43 is the ( finite ) young s modulus , @xmath44 for the third - order constants , @xmath45 for the fourth - order constants , and @xmath46 for a combination of second- and third - order constants .",
    "some constants have the explicit limiting behaviour @xmath47 where @xmath0 remains a finite quantity , of the same order of magnitude as @xmath6 ; see @xcite for analysis of the behaviour of @xmath7 , @xmath8 ,  , @xmath38 in the incompressible limit and the connection with @xmath0 .",
    "note that the limiting behaviour for @xmath35 in terms of the initial poisson s ratio @xmath48 and young s modulus @xmath43 is thus @xmath49 .",
    "this was shown in @xcite , but mistyped in equations ( 49 ) and ( 89 ) therein as @xmath50 .    in this paper , we treat in turn the case of hydrostatic pre - stress ( section [ hydrostatic pressure ] ) and of uniaxial pre - stress ( section [ uniaxial tension ] ) , and we provide expansions of the body wave speeds up to the second order in the pre - strain , and also in the pre - stress , for compressible solids and in the relevant incompressible limits .",
    "consider first a cuboidal sample of a compressible solid with sides of lengths @xmath51 in its ( unstressed ) reference configuration .",
    "we define the reference geometry in terms of cartesian coordinates @xmath52 by @xmath53 .",
    "the material is then subject to a pure homogeneous strain @xmath54 and deformed into the cuboid @xmath55 , where @xmath56 are the cartesian coordinates in the deformed configuration , and the constants @xmath13 are the principal stretches of the deformation .",
    "we now specialize the deformation to a pure dilatation so that @xmath57 . since the material is isotropic the cauchy stress @xmath58 is spherical , @xmath59 say , with @xmath60 corresponding to hydrostatic tension ( pressure ) .",
    "the pre - stress is computed as @xmath61 or , more conveniently , as @xmath62 , where @xmath63 . up to the second order in the volume change @xmath64",
    ", we find @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the infinitesimal bulk modulus , and @xmath67 ( it is a simple matter to check that the expansion is equivalent to one first established by @xcite . )",
    "conversely , the volume change is expressed in terms of the hydrostatic stress as @xmath68    here the pre - stress does not generate preferred directions and the solid remains isotropic .",
    "it follows that two waves may propagate in any direction , one longitudinal , with speed @xmath69 , and one transverse , with speed @xmath70 , given by @xmath71 where these quantities are computed from the formulas .",
    "expanding in terms of the volume change , we obtain @xmath72 where @xmath73 are the coefficients for the classical ( linear ) acoustoelastic effect , and @xmath74 b_{t } & = & \\frac{1}{2 } \\lambda + \\frac{5}{9 } \\mu+   \\frac{1}{2 } a   + \\frac{13}{6 } b + c + e +   f + \\frac{2}{3 } g\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] are the coefficients of the large ( quadratic ) acoustoelastic effect .    alternatively , we may use to express the wave speeds in terms of the pre - stress rather than the pre - strain , as @xmath75 thus recovering the classical formulas @xmath76 for the ( linear ) acoustoelastic effect @xcite , and establishing the formulas @xmath77 for the large ( quadratic ) acoustoelastic effect , where @xmath78 is given in .    for an application of these results",

    "they performed acoustoelastic experiments and plotted the stress - dependent shear and bulk moduli , defined as @xmath79 against the hydrostatic pressure @xmath80 for polysterene and for pyrex .",
    "for the former , the variations are clearly linear , and nothing would be gained by including foe effects . for the latter ,",
    "there is a marked departure from the linear acoustoelastic effect at high pressures , and we thus use to obtain a better fit to the data . by digitizing the data and performing a standard least square optimization , we found that for pyrex , @xmath81 k(p ) & = & 3.27 - 7.80 \\times 10^{-5}p + 4.07 \\times 10^{-9}p^2,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath82 and @xmath83 are expressed in units of @xmath84 bars and @xmath85 in bars .",

    "specifically , we may solve to find the lam constants as @xmath86 similarly , we find two linearly independent combinations of the three third - order constants : @xmath87 - 4 m(0 ) , \\quad a + 9b + 9c = - 9k(0 )   \\left[1+k'(0 ) \\right]/2.\\ ] ] finally , we also find two combinations of the fourth - order constants : @xmath88 & \\phantom { e + f   + \\dfrac{2}{3}g = \\dfrac{7}{6}k(0 ) }   + \\dfrac{1}{2}k(0)\\left [ k'(0 ) + \\dfrac{13}{3}m'(0 ) + k'(0)m'(0 ) + k(0)m''(0 ) \\right],\\notag \\\\[4pt ] & e + 3f + g + 9h =   \\dfrac{17}{24}k(0 ) + \\dfrac{3}{2}k(0)\\left[k'(0 ) + \\dfrac{1}{4}\\left(k'(0 ) \\right)^2 + \\dfrac{1}{4}k(0)k''(0)\\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] hence , for the pyrex data : @xmath89 clearly , the data of @xcite are not sufficient to determine all the third- and fourth - order constants . an additional relation is needed to determine experimentally all the third - order constants , and a further two relations to determine the fourth - order constants .",
    "these may be provided from , for example , wave speed measurements in uniaxially deformed samples , as we show in the following section .",
    "we conclude this section by evoking the work of p.w .",
    "bridgman on `` the physics of high pressures '' @xcite , which won him the 1946 nobel prize .",
    "he carried out countless high pressure measurements on solids , and fitted his data with a quadratic equation for the volume change , in the form @xmath90 .",
    "direct comparison of this experimental law with reveals the identifications @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",

    "in particular , the dependence of @xmath177 on an initial hydrostatic stress @xmath178 can be put in the simple form @xmath179 where @xmath180 and @xmath181 are now stress - dependent lam moduli , with @xmath182 corresponding to tension ( pressure ) , their precise functional dependence determined by the choice of strain - energy function .",
