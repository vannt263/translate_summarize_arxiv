    "one of the most successful approaches in the field of random processes is the gaussian approximation .",

    "the probability distribution @xmath10={\\mathcal{p}}[{\\{a_1 , a_2 , \\dots\\}}]$ ] then factorizes into a product @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is a gaussian with zero mean and variance @xmath15 .",
    "the idea behind this representation is to approximate the translation - invariant action of a complicated interacting problem by a quadratic ( gaussian ) action which yields the same two - point correlation functions as in the original problem . in the particularly important case of",

    "the gaussian approximation is in outstanding quantitative agreement with the full theory @xcite , and reproduces very well even the higher - order correlation functions .    because of",
    "its decoupled fourier modes , the gaussian approximation is considerably simpler than the full theory and the function @xmath0 can easily be generated through eqn  ( [ e : rough_equation ] ) from gaussian random numbers @xmath18 ( see fig .  [",
    "f : samples ] ) . however , the price to pay for this simplicity in fourier space is to have non - trivial long - range correlations in real space .",
    "as we will discuss in detail , the real - space action contains generalized derivatives which , in the sense of the riemann  liouville derivative , can be expressed as an integral convolution with a long - range kernel @xcite . for non - integer values of @xmath19 , the real - space gaussian action is non - local and the geometrical properties of the function @xmath0 are intricate .    for @xmath20 , the gaussian approximation corresponds to the notorious random walk . in this case",
