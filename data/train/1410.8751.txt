    "in ref . @xcite we have studied the behavior of masses of the isovector @xmath2 mesons @xmath8 upon subtraction of the lowest - lying eigenmodes of the manifestly chirally - invariant overlap dirac operator @xcite from the valence quark propagators ( for a previous lattice study with a chirally - improved dirac operator see refs .",
    "@xcite ) . a non - vanishing density of the quasi - zero modes of the dirac operator ( in the infinite volume limit ) represents , through the banks - casher relation @xcite , the quark condensate of the vacuum .",
    "consequently , a removal of a sufficient amount of the lowest - lying dirac eigenmodes should eventually lead to the artificial restoration ( `` unbreaking '' ) of chiral symmetry .    of course",
    ", correlators obtained after such a truncation do not correspond to a local quantum field theory @xcite and we call that case qcd@xmath9 in order to distinguish it from the full , untruncated qcd . despite that fact the correlators shown intriguing behavior .",
    "firstly , they have a very clean exponential decay for all isovector @xmath2 mesons , suggesting that these states survive the unbreaking procedure .",
    "secondly , they have interesting symmetry patterns : all @xmath8 states become degenerate .",
    "certainly this degeneracy is not accidental and tells us something important about the underlying dynamics . from this degeneracy",
    "we could infer a simultaneous restoration of both @xmath10 and @xmath11 symmetries .",
    "however , a degeneracy of all isovector states implies a larger symmetry that includes @xmath10 and @xmath11 as subgroups . this larger symmetry would require a degeneracy of all possible chiral multiplets that contain both isovector and isoscalar @xmath2 mesons .",
    "one of the principal purposes of the present study is to investigate the isoscalar @xmath2 states from all possible chiral multiplets and clarify whether they become degenerate upon unbreaking of the chiral symmetry .",
    "this larger symmetry has been identified in ref .",
    "@xcite as an @xmath12 , that mixes components of the fundamental four - component vector @xmath13 .",
    "this symmetry , which is a symmetry of the confining interaction in qcd@xmath9 , is not a symmetry of the original qcd lagrangian and should be considered as an emergent symmetry that appears from the qcd dynamics upon subtraction of the quasi - zero modes of the dirac operator . from the degeneracy of all possible @xmath2 chiral multiplets and from this symmetry it was possible to conclude that there is no color - magnetic field in the system suggesting that we observe quantum levels of a dynamical qcd@xmath9 string .",
    "our second aim in the present paper is to study the fate of the ground states of the @xmath14 mesons upon unbreaking of the chiral symmetry .",
    "one naturally expects a disappearance of the pion as a goldstone boson from the spectrum .",
    "however , a priori it is not clear what behavior to expect for the other @xmath1 mesons .",
    "we find that the disconnected contributions vanish and that the point - to - point correlation functions in all @xmath1 channels become indistinguishable after removal of the lowest - lying modes .",
    "this confirms a restoration of the @xmath10 and @xmath11 symmetries .",
    "the eigenvalues of the correlation matrices that correspond to the ground states of @xmath14 mesons loose , however , the exponential decay property implying that the unbreaking removes the physical ground states of @xmath14 mesons from the spectrum .",
    "as was discussed in the introduction we use in our study the overlap dirac operator .",
    "the gauge ensemble consists of 100 gauge configurations generated with @xmath0 mass degenerate dynamical overlap fermions on a @xmath15 lattice with a lattice spacing @xmath16 fm @xcite .",
    "the gauge configurations were generated by constraining the simulation always to the same topological sector @xmath17 .",
    "the effect of this was discussed in ref .",
    "while it is known that there is a slight dependence @xmath18 of the bound state masses on the topological sector @xcite it is expected to be very small @xcite compared to our statistical error and should become irrelevant in the infinite volume limit .",
    "the pion mass in this ensemble is @xmath19 mev @xcite .",
    "the overlap quark propagators and gauge configurations were generously provided by the jlqcd collaboration @xcite .",
    "the quark propagators were computed by the combining of the exact 100 low modes ( eigenvectors of the dirac operator ) with the stochastic estimates for the higher modes , ( see appendix a for details ) .    to unbreak the chiral symmetry we exclude the lowest - lying modes from the valence quark propagators .",
    "we introduce the reduced valence quark propagators using the spectral representation where an increasing number @xmath20 of the near - zero modes is excluded from the full propagator : @xmath21 full ( not reduced ) quark propagators correspond to @xmath22 and all reduced to @xmath23 .",
    "meson spectroscopy is done by means of the standard variational approach @xcite . in each channel",
    "we use a set of interpolators with all possible chiral structures @xcite , see table [ tab : int ] .",
    "each of these operators is constructed from quark propagators with smeared sources .",
    "the exponential type of smearing with a set of different smearing parameters is used at the source / sink and summarized in appendix a ( for the computational techniques see @xcite ) .",
    "this way we have several interpolators in each quantum channel and can use the variational method .",
    "after construction of the cross - correlation matrices @xmath24 with the size of the matrices @xmath25 ranging from @xmath26 to @xmath27 we solve the generalized eigenvalue problem @xmath28 resulting masses of the states are obtained by identifying the exponential behavior of the eigenvalues @xmath29 with @xmath30 .",
    "such states are extracted for each truncation level @xmath20 in a given quantum channel .",
    "we are deeply grateful to s. aoki , s. hashimoto and t. kaneko for their suggestion to use the jlqcd overlap gauge configurations and quark propagators , for their help and hospitality during our visit to kek .",
    "the calculations were performed on computing clusters of the university of graz ( nawi graz ) .",
