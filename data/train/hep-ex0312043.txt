    "is suppressed and the production of isolated photons is mainly due to final state radiation ( fsr ) from the primary quark - antiquark pair .    the aim of the analysis of hadronic events with fsr presented in this paper is to measure the electroweak couplings to up- and down - type quarks .",
    "the measurement is based on the photon s property of coupling to the electric charge . by selecting hadronic",
    "z decays with fsr a subsample can be extracted which is enriched in up - type quarks since the strength of the coupling is proportional to the charge squared . combining the measured rates of hadronic events with final state photon radiation with the total rate of hadronic z",
    "decays permits the simultaneous determination of the partial decay widths into up - type and down - type quarks .",
    "this approach is complementary to analyses of partial decay widths dealing with either heavy or light quark flavour tagging .",
    "this analysis determines the electroweak coupling of the up - type quarks u , c and the down - type quarks d , s , b for the flavour admixture present on the z resonance .",
    "the lep experiments have already published qcd measurements and electroweak quark coupling measurements based on final state photon production  @xcite .",
    "this analysis is based on a larger data sample and updates earlier opal measurements  @xcite .",
    "the z decay into a quark - antiquark pair can be described by effective vector and axial - vector couplings , @xmath90 and @xmath91 , where q = u or d , representing up - type or down - type quarks .",
    "the z decay widths depend on the sums of the squares of these couplings .",
    "writing effective couplings @xmath92 as @xmath93 the total hadronic width of the z , which is calculated to third order in @xmath94  @xcite , is given by :    @xmath95    where @xmath94 is the strong coupling constant , @xmath96 is the fermi constant , @xmath97 is the mass of the z , and @xmath98 is the number of colours . the electromagnetic quark couplings also enter the hadronic partial width of the z with a final state radiation ( fsr ) photon ; @xmath99 where @xmath100 is the electroweak coupling constant , @xmath101 and @xmath102 are the charges of up - type and down - type quarks , @xmath103 is a correction factor determined from perturbative calculations , and @xmath104 is a jet resolution parameter , which determines whether a photon is merged into a nearby jet .",

    "each block subtended an angular region of approximately @xmath122 .",
    "half of the block width corresponded to 1.9 molire radii .",
    "deposits of energy in adjacent blocks were grouped together to form clusters of electromagnetic energy .",
    "the intrinsic energy resolution of @xmath123 was substantially degraded ( by a factor @xmath124 ) by the presence of two radiation lengths of material in front of the lead glass . for the intermediate region , @xmath125 , the amount of material",

    "jets were then reconstructed in events with a photon candidate .",
    "the jet reconstruction implied an additional isolation requirement on the photons , as a function of the jet resolution parameter .",

    "the data taken above and below the z resonance during those years were not analysed . using the criteria described in reference  @xcite , @xmath128  3022897",

    "it also enabled the use of a shower shape fit , for which the description of the monte carlo was not satisfactory below 7  gev .",
    "the shape of the cluster was required to be consistent with a single photon .",
    "the number @xmath130 of lead glass blocks contributing more than 0.02  gev to the cluster energy was required to be less than 16 .",

    "this was taken from the best fit of the shower profile parametrisation to the observed energy sharing between the calorimeter blocks assuming that the cluster was produced by an isolated photon .",

    "two categories of background were considered .",
    "the first was the contribution from misidentified neutral hadrons and their decay products .",
    "the second was from genuine photons originating from initial state radiation .",
    "the sequence in which the data were corrected for background and efficiency reflects this difference in background sources .",
    "first , the background contribution from neutral hadrons was estimated by a fit to the shower shape distribution in data , using the difference in shower shape to distinguish genuine photons from hadron background .",
    "second , a correction for detector effects was applied . in particular this",
    "corrected for the photon detection efficiency and compensated for the requirements on the shower shape and measurement uncertainties .",
    "it was calculated using a full simulation of the opal detector .",
    "third , events with photons produced by isr were subtracted . their number was estimated with monte carlo simulations at the hadron level .",
    "finally , the number of events remaining at the hadron level was corrected for hadronisation and selection efficiencies , so that it could be compared with results from matrix element calculations at the parton level . in this analysis ,",
    "hadron and parton level were defined as in reference @xcite .",
    "neutral hadrons and their decay products can produce isolated clusters in the electromagnetic calorimeter which pass the selection for photon candidates .",
    "this background was simulated using a sample of 8.4 million events generated with jetset  7.4  @xcite , which were processed with the opal detector simulation program  @xcite .",
    "the hadronic background comes mainly from events with a @xmath127 decay , and has a small contribution from @xmath158 decays and k@xmath159 .",
    "there is also a contribution below 1% of the total hadronic background from neutrons , @xmath160 and @xmath161 .",
    "the simulated @xmath140 distributions are shown in figure  [ fig - c_dist_mc ] for single photon clusters and for clusters produced by the hadronic background sources . by fitting the data distribution to a linear combination of the expected distribution of the shower - shape parameter @xmath140 for the background and the measured distribution for single photons taken from a data sample of @xmath162 events , the fraction of single photon events was extracted  @xcite . in figure [ fig - c_dist_mu ] the @xmath140 distributions are plotted for isolated neutral clusters from @xmath162 events in data and monte carlo and good agreement",
    "is observed .",
    "the fit is a binned maximum likelihood fit which takes into account the effects of data and monte carlo statistics  @xcite . for each @xmath104 value",
    "considered , the fit was performed in eight cluster energy bins to extract the fraction of single photon events .",
    "the total fraction @xmath163 of single photon events for each @xmath104 value was estimated by calculating the weighted average of the results for the eight energy bins .",

    "the jet finding scheme was in this case jade  e0 , with @xmath164 .",
    "table  [ tab - all_main_ycut ] shows the extracted fraction of single photon events in the selected samples for three of the @xmath104 values in each jet finding scheme , spanning the phase space studied .",
    "the quoted @xmath165 confidence level error was obtained by studying the variation of @xmath166  @xcite .",
    "it combines the uncertainty due to limited data statistics ( 2526 @xmath162 events , and between 1900 and 9000 candidates , see table  [ tab - n_vs_ycut ] ) and due to limited monte carlo statistics ( between 548 and 1695 clusters from neutral hadrons ) .",
    "the background estimate was found to be consistent with previous measurements performed by opal and l3 .",
    "opal measured  @xcite that jetset  underestimates the rate of isolated @xmath158 with an energy @xmath167  gev by a factor @xmath168 , and the rate of isolated @xmath127 in the energy range @xmath169  gev by a factor @xmath170 .",

    "the data were corrected for detector effects : @xmath174 with @xmath175 as the number of photon events before the background correction , and @xmath163 as the fitted single photon fraction ( isr+fsr ) in the selected sample at detector level , which has been derived as discussed in the previous section . the correction factor @xmath176 , which takes into account detector inefficiencies , was calculated for each  and each jet finding algorithm using the sample of 8.4 million fully simulated jetset  events .",
    "the same cuts on the photon energy , polar angle and isolation were applied at the hadron level .",
    "the correction factors @xmath176 are shown in table  [ tab - all_main_ycut ] , again for three values of  in each jet finding scheme .",
    "the efficiency losses are mainly due to photon conversions in the two radiation lengths of material in front of the electromagnetic calorimeter , e.g. the beam pipe , the central tracking system and the magnet coil .",
    "the photon conversion rate was calculated to be around 8% .",
    "initial state radiation photons are indistinguishable from photons from final state radiation .",
    "although the energy and angular cuts on the electromagnetic clusters reduce the amount of initial state radiation , which is already small when working at the z resonance , initial state photons can still make a contribution of several percent to the selected sample .",
    "this contribution was evaluated using the @xmath177 monte carlo  @xcite without the full detector simulation ; the @xmath177 generator has the most accurate isr modeling for collisions .",
    "the data which are corrected for detector effects are directly comparable to the @xmath177 hadron level predictions . the number of fsr events at the hadron level is therefore given by @xmath178 with @xmath179 as the number of isr events as calculated with the @xmath177 monte carlo program and normalized to the number @xmath180 of selected hadronic z decays .",
    "the same cuts on the photon energy , polar angle and isolation were applied at the hadron level for both the jetset  and @xmath177 monte carlo samples .",
    "the numbers of isolated initial state photons @xmath179 to be subtracted are shown in table  [ tab - all_main_ycut ] for three values of  in each jet finding scheme .      in order to compare the measured final state photon rate with the matrix element predictions ,",
    "the measurements must be corrected for the remaining acceptance cuts on the polar angle and the cone isolation , for hadronisation , and for fragmentation , which affect the number of jets in the event . a correction factor @xmath181 which takes into account the cuts mentioned above",
    "was calculated using jetset  7.4 .",
    "no further correction was made for the energy cut @xmath182  gev , to avoid introducing additional uncertainties .",

    "the systematic studies from which the other uncertainties were obtained are described below .",
    "the estimate of the hadronic background which results from the fit of the shower - shape parameter @xmath140 relies on the proper simulation of the shower for the background , as well as on the simulation of the yield of the various hadronic background sources . to quantify the systematic uncertainty originating from the description of the hadronic background",
    ", the fit procedure was repeated for all  values and the two jet finding algorithms after changing the monte carlo input distributions to which the data are fitted by varying the composition of the hadronic background . the contribution from @xmath127 and @xmath158",
    "was doubled to account for the observed underestimation of isolated neutral pions and @xmath158-mesons in the monte carlo  @xcite .",
    "the contribution from k@xmath159 was increased by 18% , which was extrapolated from the observed differential cross - section in @xcite .",
    "the observed differences from the results of the default procedure were not statistically significant , and showed no systematic trend , so no systematic uncertainty was assigned .",
    "further systematic studies have been made by varying the bin size and the upper boundary of the @xmath140 distribution .",
    "again , no significant change in the resulting rate was observed .",
    "the effect of the interference between initial state radiation and final state radiation was checked by comparing prompt photon samples from the @xmath177 monte carlo generated with and without isr - fsr interference .",
    "the average difference of around 1 per mill in the rate of isolated prompt photons with an energy of larger than 7  gev was assigned as systematic uncertainty on the corrected rate and is listed in table  [ tab - allsyst ] .",
    "several systematic effects coming from the description of the detector were investigated :    *   the track parameters were smeared by 10% to estimate the effect of the reconstruction on the jet finding and the isolation criteria  @xcite . *",
    "the effect of the energy resolution of the electromagnetic calorimeter was evaluated by smearing the energy of clusters by 20% .",
    "this number is chosen since the energy resolution of isolated photon clusters selected in jetset  and in a @xmath162 reference data sample differ by up to 20% .",
    "the cluster energies were also shifted by 0.1 - 0.2  gev .",
    "this shift reflects the difference in the mean values of the distributions of @xmath185 from the simulation and of @xmath186 in data , where @xmath187 is the kinematically reconstructed energy of the isolated photon in the reference sample .",
    "these effects would modify the correction factor @xmath176 . in all cases , the systematic uncertainty on the correction factor was found to be below the per mill level .",
    "an important contribution to the systematic error comes from the simulation of photon conversions .",
    "an error of 10% on the photon conversion rate  @xcite results in an error on the correction factor of about 0.8% .",
    "the jet reconstruction was also tested for systematic effects .",
    "the energy resolution was checked using a subsample of the candidate events with two jets and one isolated photon .",
    "the measured energy of each jet was compared to the energy of the same jet calculated by imposing energy / momentum conservation in the final state .",
    "the measured shift in the jet energy was used to estimate the systematic error on the photon rate . a variation between 0.1% and 0.6% in the rate of photons",
    "was found for the jade  e0 jet finding scheme as a function of @xmath104 , and between 0.1% and 0.3% for the durham scheme .",
    "the jet angle reconstruction was tested using the same sample of two - jet events .",
    "the hadronic part of each event in both monte carlo and data was boosted into its centre of mass using the photon momentum . in this system",
    "the two jets should be collinear .",
    "the angular shift between the monte carlo expectation and the data was taken to calculate a systematic uncertainty .",
    "this uncertainty varied between 0.1% and 1.7% for both jet finders .",
    "studies of the photon angular resolution showed that the effect on the rate was negligible .",
    "the combined systematic uncertainties obtained from these studies are given in table  [ tab - allsyst ] as the contribution to the error from the determination of the correction factor @xmath176 .",
    "three methods were used to evaluate the uncertainty arising from fragmentation and hadronisation .",
    "they affect the determination of the correction factor @xmath181 , which compensates for the geometrical acceptance , i.e.  the extrapolation of the result to the total @xmath143 range , and for the isolation cone around the photon candidate .",
    "an uncertainty is not trivial to assign since we largely rely on monte carlo studies .    * * parton shower model * + the jetset  predictions were compared with those of herwig@xcite and ariadne  @xcite , which use different parton showering schemes .",

    "they are listed in table  [ tab - allsyst ] as the error contribution from the determination of @xmath181 and they are typically largest for small  values , smaller for intermediate  values , and increase again for large  values .",
    "this indicates that the correction @xmath181 and therefore the final result is more sensitive to details of the energy flow around the photon candidate for very large and very small values of @xmath200 , i.e. near the phase space boundaries .",

    ", we obtain @xmath218 for the jade  e0 jet finding algorithm ( @xmath211 ) and @xmath219 for durham ( @xmath212 ) .",
    "the first error is due to statistics , the second error is due to systematics and the third error comes from the uncertainty in @xmath220 and the theoretical cut off @xmath208 .",
    "the results derived with the jade  and durham schemes are consistent and the result with the smaller uncertainty ( jade  scheme ) is considered the main result .",

    "also shown are the standard model prediction and the correlation obtained from the measurement of @xmath221 . combining the information on @xmath222 and @xmath223 , the decay widths for up - type and down - type quarks can be extracted for @xmath224 in the jade  scheme : @xmath225 note that in this measurement @xmath108 and @xmath109 are 100% anti - correlated .",
    "the standard model predictions  @xcite for these widths are : @xmath226 in good agreement with the measurement .",
    "the result is also in good agreement with previous measurements from delphi  @xcite , l3  @xcite , and opal  @xcite and is significantly more precise .",
    "the analysis in  @xcite used high - momentum stable particles as a tag , while the other three were based on the determination of the fsr rate in hadronic z decays .",
    "using the entire opal lep1 on - peak z hadronic decay sample a measurement of the partial decay widths of the z into up- and down - type quarks was performed .",
    "the measurement was based on 12626 observed candidate hadronic z decays with final state photon emission .",
    "the partial width @xmath222 for such decays was calculated as a function of the partial widths of the z into up- and down - type quarks with the aid of a matrix element monte carlo program of @xmath111 .",
    "the calculated value for @xmath222 was combined with the pdg average of the total hadronic z width @xmath223 to determine @xmath227  mev and @xmath228  mev .",
    "the result is consistent with the standard model expectation and with previous measurements  @xcite .",
    "its precision is significantly improved compared to previous measurements using a similar method of selecting hadronic z decays with highly isolated and energetic photons due to increased data and monte carlo statistics . with respect to the previous opal measurement  @xcite a different approach was chosen to estimate the background rate of neutral hadrons being misidentified as genuine photons .",
    "the previous measurement invokes isospin symmetry to estimate the background rate of neutral hadrons and measures the rate of isolated charged pions to extract the rate of isolated neutral pions .",
    "the present analysis utilises the different shapes of the distribution of the shower - shape parameter @xmath140 for neutral hadrons and genuine photons . the larger data and monte carlo statistics allowed us to choose this method which exhibits a smaller systematic uncertainty .",
    "we particularly wish to thank the sl division for the efficient operation of the lep accelerator at all energies and for their close cooperation with our experimental group .",
