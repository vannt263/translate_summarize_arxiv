    "numerous studies of the two - dimensional ( 2d ) quantum heisenberg antiferromagnet ( qhaf ) undertaken in the last few years have significantly improved our understanding of the behavior of these systems at low temperatures  @xcite .",
    "there is no ordered state at any finite @xmath4 ( and hence , no phase transitions ) , but there are nevertheless three distinct low-@xmath4 regimes depending on the relative values of the temperature and the coupling constant , @xmath7 .",
    "these three regimes are  @xcite : _ ( i ) _ renormalized - classical ( rc ) regime , where @xmath4 is smaller than the spin stiffness in the ordered ground state , @xmath8 ; _ ( ii ) _ quantum - disordered ( qd ) regime , when @xmath7 is larger than the critical coupling for the @xmath9 disordering transition , and @xmath4 is smaller than the gap , @xmath10 , between the singlet ground state and the lowest excited state with @xmath11 ; _ ( iii ) _ quantum - critical ( qc ) regime , which lies between the other two , and in which temperature is the largest infrared cutoff , @xmath12 .",
    "it is very likely that the low - energy physics of a 2d qhaf , at least in the vicinity of the disordering transition , is adequately described by the @xmath13 nonlinear sigma - model ( see sec  [ sec1 ] ) .",
    "some information about the properties of this model can be obtained from the bethe - ansatz solution  @xcite , but most of the thermodynamic properties have been studied using several available perturbative techniques .",
    "the first perturbative approach to the @xmath13 sigma - model was initiated many years ago by polyakov  @xcite . in this approach ,",
    "one departs from the ordered state at @xmath9 , and applies renormalization group theory which accounts for the effects of classical fluctuations at small but finite @xmath4 .",
    "the expansion parameter for the rg studies is @xmath14 .",
    "it has to be small , i.e. , the system should be in the rc regime .",
    "the rg approach allows one to obtain a scale at which the fluctuation corrections to the spin - wave coupling constant become comparable to its bare value .",
    "this scale is then identified with the correlation length in a system .",
    "calculations along these lines yielded @xmath15  @xcite and @xmath16  @xcite . here",
    "@xmath17 is a constant ( @xmath18  @xcite ) , @xmath19 is the static structure factor , @xmath20 is the staggered magnetization , and @xmath21 tends to a finite value at @xmath22 .",
    "another widely used approach is the @xmath5 expansion for the @xmath6 sigma - model .",
    "the physical results are obtained in this approach by extending the perturbation series in @xmath5 to @xmath23 .",
    "the advantage of the @xmath5 expansion is that it works in all three scaling regimes , and the point of departure is a _ disordered _ state at any finite temperature .",
    "the weak point of the theory is the absence of the physically motivated small parameter for the physical case @xmath23 . in the rc regime , however , the series of @xmath5 terms can be explicitly summed up , and for the physical case of @xmath23 one obtains _ exactly _ the same results as in the rg approach . at arbitrary @xmath24",
    ", one finds @xmath25 and @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "the results of @xmath5 expansion for all three scaling regimes are collected in  @xcite .",
    "finally , the third approach is based on the spinon representation for spin operators ( schwinger boson theory ) .",
    "read and sachdev have shown explicitly  @xcite that the low - energy limit of the schwinger boson theory is described by a @xmath28 sigma - model for a two - component complex unit field ( see below ) . to obtain this model , one has to express the unit vector field of the @xmath13 sigma - model as a bilinear combination of two bose fields ( @xmath28 representation ) , @xmath29 where @xmath30 are @xmath31 indexes , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 are the pauli matrices .",
    "this representation also introduces a @xmath34 gauge degree of freedom , because @xmath35 remains invariant under the transformation of the bosonic fields , @xmath36 .",
    "each @xmath37 field quantum carries @xmath38 and is therefore a bosonic spinon .",
    "the condition @xmath39 , however , imposes a local constraint @xmath40 , which implies that spinons can appear only in pairs .",
    "a mean - field version of the schwinger - boson theory has recently received a lot of attention  @xcite . in the mean - field approximation ,",
    "one reduces the on - site constraint to a constraint imposed on the averaged quantities , and decouples the term that is quartic in @xmath41 in the spin hamiltonian . from the solution of the self - consistent equations in the rc regime one then obtains the spin correlation length , @xmath42 , and the static structure factor , @xmath43 , where @xmath44 has the same asymptotic behavior as @xmath21  @xcite .",
    "the temperature dependence of @xmath19 and the exponent in the expression for the correlation length are the same as in other approaches but the correlation length aquires an extra power of @xmath4 in the prefactor . because of",
    "this incorrect prefactor in @xmath45 , the validity of the schwinger - boson mean - field theory has been questioned  @xcite .",
    "more recently , however , the schwinger - boson approach to a 2d antiferromagnet has been applied in a systematic way , by means of a controllable @xmath0 expansion  @xcite . to generate this expansion , each @xmath37 field",
    "was assumed to have @xmath46 components rather than two ( this changes the symmetry of the underlying sigma - model to @xmath1 ) .",
    "the @xmath0 computations have been performed for field - theory  @xcite and condensed - matter  @xcite applications .",
    "it has been shown that the extra power of @xmath4 in the prefactor is indeed an artifact of the mean - field , @xmath2 , approximation : the correct prefactor is @xmath47 , and it reduces to a constant for the physical case of @xmath48 . at the same time , the @xmath0 corrections to the static structure factor do not change the power of @xmath4 , and the mean - field result for @xmath19 is therefore valid for all @xmath46 .",
    "clearly then , for physical spins , the @xmath49field and the schwinger - boson approaches yield the same temperature dependence of the observables in the rc regime , as they indeed should .",
    "one can therefore safely use any of these perturbative techniques .",
    "notice however , that the series of regular @xmath0 corrections are poorly convergent while the regular @xmath5 corrections are usually small .",
    "this makes the schwinger boson approach less reliable for practical purposes than the @xmath5 expansion for the @xmath6 sigma - model .",
    "there is , however , another discrepancy between the schwinger - boson and the @xmath49field approaches , which in our opinion has not been fully clarified in the literature .",
    "namely , in the @xmath49field approach , the staggered static spin susceptibility @xmath50 is proportional to the static @xmath49 field propagator which has a simple pole along the imaginary @xmath3 axis , at @xmath51 .",
    "the residue of the pole is finite at @xmath52 , and remains finite in the physical case of @xmath23 .",
    "this result is valid in all three scaling regimes . on the other hand , in the schwinger - boson formalism",
    ", the staggered spin susceptibility is a convolution of two spinon propagators . at the mean - field level , spinons behave as free particles , and elementary calculations show that the staggered susceptibility has only a branch cut singularity at @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the mass ( inverse correlation length ) of a schwinger boson . since the behavior near the singularity in @xmath55 determines the long - distance properties of the spin correlators , the difference in the type of the singularity in the two models leads to different predictions about the long - distance behavior of the correlation function .",
    "obviously , one of these predictions must be wrong .    in this paper",
    ", we show that the branch cut behavior of @xmath55 is also an artifact of the mean - field schwinger - boson formalism .",
    "we will see that @xmath0 corrections are divergent near the branch cut , and eventually transform the branch cut into a simple pole .",
    "this phenomenon is closely related to the confinement of spinons in the @xmath1 model in @xmath56 dimensions , first studied by witten  @xcite .",
    "he found that massless gauge fluctuations in the @xmath1 model give rise to a linear confining potential between spinons , and this yields a bound state with a mass , @xmath57 , which is a nonanalytical function of @xmath0 : @xmath58 .",
    "this result was reproduced in a number of more recent papers ( for a review see , e.g. , ref.@xcite and references therein ) . however , to the best of our knowledge , the effect of the @xmath0 corrections on the staggered susceptibility has not been studied in detail .",
    "the results of such study will be reported in this paper .",
    "besides the rc regime , we will also study staggered susceptibility in the qd and qc regimes .",
    "before we proceed to the description of our calculations , it is useful to specify which @xmath0 corrections are essential to our analysis .",
    "the point is that in the rc regime , there exists a self - energy correction to the spinon propagator of the form @xmath59 .",
    "since @xmath54 is itself exponential in @xmath4 , the double logarithm in fact reduces to @xmath60 .",
    "a series of these logarithmic terms give rise to the above mentioned change in the power of temperature in the preexponential factor in @xmath45 from @xmath4 to @xmath61 . below we will assume that these corrections are _ already _ included into the expression for the schwinger boson mass",
    ". we will therefore consider only _ regular _",
    "@xmath0 corrections which , as we will show , are responsible for the confinement .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "we report analogous calculations for qd and qc phases , respectively .",

    "a more detailed discussion of the derivation of the @xmath1 model can be found in ref.@xcite .    at @xmath2 ,",

    "the key point in the computation of @xmath160 , as well as in other computations later in the paper , is that for @xmath161 ( which is the only one we consider ) , the angular integration is confined to a region where @xmath162  @xcite . for practical purposes ,",
    "it is convenient to restrict the angular integration to the vicinity of @xmath163 , but extend the integration over @xmath164 and @xmath165 from @xmath166 to @xmath167 . rescaling the angular variables , @xmath168",

    "calculations for @xmath176 proceed along the same lines , and the result is @xmath177    the @xmath0 corrections to the polarization operator in the rc regime were studied earlier by campostrini and rossi @xcite .",
    "they numerically evaluated the leading singularity in @xmath178 for @xmath179 and found the same result as in ( [ b5 ] ) , with the numerical prefactor @xmath180 which , as we show , is in fact exactly @xmath181 .",
    "however , their estimate for @xmath160 for negative @xmath182 is inconsistent with ( [ b55 ] ) .",
    "let us now discuss the @xmath0 results .",
    "our first observation is that the @xmath183 divergence of @xmath160 is stronger than one could expect assuming that @xmath104 preserves its form ( [ b2 ] ) , and the two - spinon mass has a regular @xmath0 expansion ( the latter would correspond to @xmath184 ) .",
    "a crude estimate that provides insight into this singularity may be obtained by absorbing the @xmath0 correction into a mass renormalization and solving a self - consistent equation for the mass  @xcite .",
    "one then obtains @xmath185 , where @xmath186 , which is consistent with witten s result for the mass renormalization .",
    "however , this self - consistent procedure is clearly not exact , even for large @xmath46 , because near @xmath187 , @xmath188 , and the @xmath0 contribution to @xmath134 has the same order @xmath189 as the leading term .",
    "moreover , simple estimates show that the higher - order @xmath0 corrections behave as @xmath190 and therefore all have the same order near @xmath191",
    ".    we will demonstrate in the next section that the self - consistent procedure  @xcite yielding @xmath192   is actually incomplete because the @xmath0 corrections contribute to both the mass renormalization and to the renormalization of the spinon wave function . to see this",
    ", we will need to solve the problem exactly by summing up the series of the most divergent @xmath0 corrections ( but we will still assume that @xmath193 and neglect terms which have relative smallness in @xmath0 ) .",
    "the relevant diagrams at each order in @xmath0 are presented in fig  [ ladder ] .",
    "these diagrams form a ladder series .",
    "we will first discuss the solution of the ladder series and then show that other diagrams are relatively smaller at large @xmath46 .",
    "it is convenient to formally include both self - energy and vertex renormalization terms into an effective vertex renormalization , such that @xmath194 the integral equation for the vertex can be written down as @xmath195 again , the angular integration over both @xmath157 and @xmath196 is confined to a narrow region ( @xmath197 in which both internal momenta are nearly orthogonal to the external momentum @xmath99 .",
    "we assume that @xmath198 and @xmath199 are nonsigular for these values of the angles .",
    "we then can set @xmath200 to be orthogonal to @xmath99 in @xmath201 and perform angular intergation in the green functions .",
    "restricting , as before , to the integration only near @xmath163 , and extending the integration over @xmath164 and @xmath165 from @xmath166 to @xmath167 , we obtain @xmath202 where @xmath203 substituting now @xmath204 , we can rewrite ( [ b99 ] ) as @xmath205 finally , performing a fourier transformation to real space , @xmath206 we obtain for @xmath207 an _ one - dimensional _ schrodinger equation with a source @xmath208 the potential @xmath209 is given by @xmath210 notice that the integral over @xmath165 is free from divergencies .",
    "this is again the result of including both self - energy and vertex corrections in the ladder series .",
    "going back to ( [ b9 ] ) , we see that @xmath104 takes a simple form @xmath211 we emphasize at this point that @xmath212 is _ not _ a wave function of the 1d schrodinger equation , but rather a green s function of the inhomogeneous differential equation ( [ b7 ] ) .",
    "this equation was solved earlier in the content of the weak localization theory @xcite , and we simply quote the result : @xmath213 where @xmath214 , @xmath215 is the airy function , and @xmath216 is its derivative with respect to the argument . for positive @xmath217 , both @xmath218 and @xmath216 decay exponentially , but for negative @xmath217 , they have zeros  @xcite .",
    "the singular contributions to @xmath219 indeed come from the zeros of @xmath216 .",
    "expanding near each of these zeros , we obtain @xmath220 where @xmath221 is the n - th zero of the derivative of the airy function .",
    "clearly , the polarization operator now has a set of simple poles at @xmath222 .    finally , we remind that we are actually interested in the long - distance behavior of the spin correlation function . at long distances ,",
    "only the pole with the smallest mass is relevant . near this pole",

    "( [ b100 ] ) is the key result of this section .",
    "we see that the series of divergent @xmath0 corrections near the branch cut not only produce nonanalytical renormalization of the two - spinon mass , but also change the branch cut behavior of the staggered susceptibility to a set of poles at discrete values of @xmath3 . in real space",
    ", we then have @xmath228 at very large distances which agrees with the result for the @xmath49field sigma - model .",

    ", the spacing between neighboring poles vanishes , and one recovers the mean - field branch - cut solution for @xmath104 , and hence @xmath230 .",
    "it is not difficult to show that at finite but large @xmath46 , the asymptotic behavior associated with the lowest pole exists only at very large distances , @xmath231 , while at smaller distances the behavior of spin correlations remains the same as in the mean - field theory . indeed , at large @xmath46",
    ", the asymptotic behavior is of no practical relevance , since at @xmath232 , the spin correlation function is already negligibly small .",
    "however , for the physical case of @xmath48 , we expect the behavior associated with the pole to dominate at all scales larger than the correlation length .",
    "notice , however , that the existence of the nonanalytical corrections to the spin correlation length makes it very difficult to obtain the exact expression for @xmath233 in the @xmath1 model .",
    "the exact value of @xmath45 in the @xmath6 model is known at arbitrary @xmath24  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath48 value of the overall factor @xmath234 in the staggered susceptibility ( [ b100 ] ) ( @xmath235 ) is also substantially larger than @xmath236 expected for the @xmath13 model from the @xmath5 expansion  @xcite .    before concluding this section ,",
    "we show that the terms not included in the ladder series do not contribute to the renormalization of the polarization operator to leading order in @xmath0 .",
    "the key point is that if we allow the gauge field propagators to cross each other even once , the integral over the internal momentum of the two green functions located between the propagators gives zero because the poles are located in the same half - plane . to illustrate this ,",
    "consider the second , `` umbrella''-like , diagram in fig  [ wrong_dia ] .",
    "the analytical expression for this diagram is @xmath237 here @xmath238 and @xmath239 are the angles between the external momentum @xmath172 and the internal ones @xmath240 , and @xmath241 , respectively . as before ,",
    "the relevant @xmath242 contribution from this diagram is confined to the integration over internal momenta which are nearly orthogonal to @xmath172 .",
    "expanding the angles around @xmath163 , rescaling them in the same way as in ( [ b4 ] ) , and shifting the variable @xmath243 , we find that the angular integration in ( [ b8 ] ) reduces to @xmath244 the integration over @xmath156 then gives zero .",

    "note that this result does not depend on the dimensionality .",
    "we now perform the same type of analysis for the qd regime .",
    "this is the low - temperature regime at @xmath245 , when long - range order in the ground state is destroyed by quantum fluctuations .",
    "the ground state is then a total spin singlet , and there is a gap , @xmath10 , towards the lowest excited triplet state with @xmath11 .",
    "the temperature corrections to the staggered susceptibility in the qd regime are exponentially small , and we therefore restrict our analysis in this section to @xmath9 . at zero temperature frequency becomes a continuous variable , and perturbative @xmath0 expansion has to be performed in a three - dimensional spacetime .",
    "the higher dimensionality has already shown up in the computation of the the polarization operator at @xmath2 , which in the qd regime has only a weak , logarithmic singularity at @xmath246  ( see eq .",
    "( [ b22 ] ) ) .",
    "the computation of the leading @xmath0 corrections proceeds exactly in the same way as in the rc regime .",
    "one can easily verify that the typical internal momenta in the @xmath247 analog of ( [ b3 ] ) are of the order of @xmath122 and nearly orthogonal to the external momentum @xmath172 .",
    "this , in turn , implies that all internal momenta are confined to the plane perpendicular to @xmath172 , which makes the problem effectively @xmath248 .",
    "technically this can be seen as follows .",
    "consider @xmath247 vectors @xmath249 and @xmath250 .",
    "let them form angles @xmath155 and @xmath156 with @xmath172 , respectively",
    ". then @xmath251 , where @xmath252 is the azimuthal angle @xmath253 . in the spirit of our approximation , we expand @xmath155 and @xmath156 around @xmath163",
    ". then immediately @xmath254 , which is the scalar product in 2d .",
    "performing the angular integration in the same way as in the previous section , we obtain @xmath255    evaluating this integral , we find @xmath256 where @xmath257 is a constant . as in the rc regime ,",
    "the @xmath0 correction to @xmath134 has a stronger dependence on @xmath122 than is required for a regular @xmath0 expansion for the two - spinon mass in ( [ b22 ] ) .",
    "however , contrary to the previous case , the @xmath258 corrections come only from the self - energy term .",
    "vertex corrections only contribute to a constant @xmath257 term in ( [ n1 ] ) .",
    "meanwhile , if we look back on how the transformation of a branch cut into a pole was obtained in the previous section , we can see that this transformation is primarily due to vertex corrections .",
    "the inclusion of the self - energy terms only serves to make the fourier transform of @xmath259 infrared - finite , and allows the correct mass renormalization . by analogy",
    ", we can expect that the series of logarithmic terms will only contribute to the mass renormalization , but the mean - field form of the polarization operator will survive .",
    "we performed an explicit computation of the ladder series of the logarithmic @xmath0 corrections , and found that with the logarithmic accuracy , the polarization operator is given by @xmath260 where @xmath261 we see that @xmath262 still has a logarithmic singularity at @xmath263 .",
    "however , this result is still incomplete , and , in fact , we have to go beyond the logarithmic accuracy and include vertex corrections , which are crucial for the renormalization of the functional dependence of the propagator .",
    "therefore , we must again consider the full ladder equation for the polarization operator .      as before , the ladder equation for the polarization operator",
    "is obtained by multiplying the equation for the vertex function @xmath264 ( which is a 3d analog of ( [ b12 ] ) ) by @xmath265 and integrating over @xmath247 momentum @xmath249 .",
    "this procedure is completely equivalent to that in the rc regime , and we present only the result . introducing @xmath266 , we obtain @xmath267 in real space , this equation is again equivalent to the schrodinger equation with a source @xmath268 where @xmath269 is the fourier transform of the gauge field propagator @xmath270 the integral over @xmath250 is again infrared finite .",
    "the dependence on @xmath46 in this equation can be eliminated by a rescaling @xmath271 , and we obtain @xmath272 where the derivatives are taken with respect to @xmath273 , and we introduced @xmath274 where @xmath275 is given by ( [ c3 ] ) . polarization operator is again related to @xmath276 via @xmath277 .    surprisingly , to the best of our knowledge , no exact solution of the 2d schrodinger equation with a logarithmic potential (  2d hydrogen atom \" ) is known .",
    "however , as @xmath278 is unbounded from above , there exists a discrete set of energy levels for the homogeneous schrodinger equation , and , just as in the rc regime , @xmath279 will have an infinite number of simple poles at some discrete @xmath280 : @xmath281 here @xmath282 is the ( unknown ) residue of the n - th pole . using the wkb approximation it is easy to estimate that at large @xmath125 , @xmath283 , and @xmath284 .",
    "also observe that momentum @xmath3 in ( [ cc ] ) is a vector in @xmath285 space - time dimensions .",
    "hence , eq.([cc ] ) in fact describes the dynamic staggered susceptibility .",
    "( [ cc ] ) is the key result of this section .",
    "we have found that , just as was the case in the rc region , the mean - field expression for the staggered susceptibility is also invalid at finite @xmath46 in the qd region , although the corrections to the two - spinon mass and to the susceptibility have different dependence on the expansion parameter @xmath0 in the qd case . the staggered susceptibility computed to order",
    "@xmath0 contains an infinite number of simple poles .",
    "the lowest pole governs the behavior of the spin correlation function at very large distances . performing the fourier transform of ( [ cc ] )",
    ", we obtain for equal - time spin - spin correlator @xmath286 , compared to the mean - field expression @xmath287 . as in the rc regime , there is a crossover between the two regimes , which occurs at @xmath288 .",
    "a confinement of spinons due to the logarithmic potential was qualitatively discussed by wen  @xcite .",
    "a complimentary scenario of spinon confinement in the qd phase was considered by polyakov  @xcite , and more recently by read and sachdev @xcite and murthy and sachdev  @xcite .",
    "they argued that the instanton tunneling events ( which we do not consider ) lead to a _ linear _ confining potential between spinons at distances @xmath289 , @xmath290  @xcite . at large @xmath46 , this scale is much larger than the typical confinement scale , @xmath291 , which appears in our consideration .",
    "the two scales , however , may become comparable at small @xmath46 .",
    "finally , we consider the qc regime , which is the intermediate regime between the rc and the qd regimes . at @xmath9 ,",
    "the @xmath1 model action describes d=3 critical theory which possess no confinement  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath2 susceptibility behaves as @xmath292 , and the @xmath0 corrections from both constraint and gauge fluctuations are of the form @xmath293 .",
    "evaluating the @xmath0 terms and exponentiating the result we obtain @xmath294 , where @xmath295 .",
    "notice that the correction to the mean - field result for @xmath296 is large .",
    "on the contrary , for @xmath6 sigma - model at the critical point we have @xmath297 which is much closer to the monte - carlo result for the @xmath13 model - @xmath298  @xcite .    at finite temperature ,",
    "the confinement does exist , and we proceed in exactly the same way as in the two previous sections . in the qc regime ,",
    "the typical frequencies are of the order of @xmath299 , so , in principle , one has to perform full frequency summation in the @xmath0 formulas for the polarization operator .",
    "however , the situation is simpler , as our earlier results show that the confining potential is much stronger in the rc regime than in the qd regime . as a result",
    ", the most divergent contributions in the @xmath0 series always come from the @xmath109 terms in the frequency summations .",
    "this observation makes the analysis of the confinement in the qc regime very similar to that in the rc regime ; the only difference is in the form of the gauge field propagator . using ( [ gauge ] ) and the results of sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] , we obtain after simple manipulations that the branch - cut behavior of the spin susceptibility is indeed replaced by a set of poles . near the lowest pole , the polarization operator behaves as @xmath300 where @xmath301 , and the bound state mass is given by @xmath302",
    "we summarize the key results of the paper .",
    "we considered here the form of the static staggered susceptibility in the @xmath1 model of an @xmath303 component @xmath304 unit vector in two spatial dimensions .",
    "the @xmath48 limit of this model describes two - dimensional heisenberg antiferromagnet , and the @xmath0 expansion we discuss in this paper is a systematic way to calculate various observables .",
    "the elementary excitations in the @xmath1 model are @xmath38 bosonic spinons .",
    "the spin variables are bilinear in spinon fields , and all physical excitations are collective modes of two spinons . in the mean - field approximations ,",
    "the spinons behave as noninteracting particles , and the static staggered spin susceptibility has a branch cut along the imaginary @xmath3 axis , terminated at @xmath305 , where @xmath54 is the mass of a spinon .",
    "we have shown that in all three scaling regimes at finite @xmath4 , the fluctuations of the gauge field give rise to divergent @xmath0 corrections near the branch cut .",
    "we selected the most divergent corrections and have shown explicitly that they form ladder series .",
    "we then found that the ladder problem is equivalent to a schrodinger equation with the @xmath306functional source in dimension @xmath307 , where @xmath308 is the spacetime dimension for the original problem .",
    "schrodinger equation has a discrete set of solutions , and expanding near each of the solutions , we obtained , instead of a branch cut , a sequence of simple poles .",
    "this in turn quantitatively changes the behavior of the spin correlation function at large distances compared to the mean - field predictions .",
    "the result that the staggered susceptibility has a pole , and not a branch cut , is consistent with the results of the alternative perturbative technique for 2d antiferromagnets , which is the @xmath5 expansion for the @xmath6 sigma - model for an @xmath309component @xmath310 unit field .",
    "the latter model describes heisenberg antiferromagnet at @xmath23 .",
    "elementary excitations in the @xmath6 sigma - model carry @xmath11 , and , at any @xmath24 , the static staggered spin susceptibility has a well defined single pole at imaginary momentum @xmath311 , where @xmath45 is the correlation length in the system .    comparing now for the @xmath1 and the @xmath6 sigma - models , we conclude that although the differences between them found at the mean - field level are now gone , in practical calculations it is more convenient to use the @xmath6 model .",
    "the reason is that the perturbative series in @xmath5 is regular for this model , and converges much better than the @xmath0 series for the @xmath1 model .",
    "the latter can even be nonanalytical in some cases , e.g. when calculating the spin correlation length .",
    "our results still leave a minor discrepancy between the two approaches : in the @xmath6 model , the static mean - field susceptibility has a @xmath312 pole , and @xmath5 corrections do not lead to the appearance of new singularities . on the contrary , in the @xmath1 model , we found , to leading order in @xmath0 , an infinite set of poles . indeed",
    ", @xmath6 and @xmath1 models are equivalent @xmath313 for @xmath23 and @xmath48 , when they both describe heisenberg antiferromagnet .",
    "however , bethe - ansatz solution for the @xmath13 model also indicates that there is a single mass in the problem because the free energy as a function of the uniform magnetic field , @xmath314 , has a single threshold at @xmath315  @xcite .",
    "we therefore expect that all the poles , that we have found in the @xmath1 model , except for the lowest one , should disappear for @xmath48 . at present",
    ", we can only speculate how this may occur - the most likely possibility , in our opinion , is that the solutions of the schrodinger equation with @xmath316 simply acquire a finite lifetime due to higher - order corrections in @xmath0 .",
    "if this is true , then the susceptibility in the @xmath1 model has a single stable pole at @xmath317 @xmath46 , while all other poles that we have found to first order in @xmath0 , form an incoherent continuum where both real and imaginary part of susceptibility are present .",
    "this is corroborated by an observation that the @xmath125-field propagator of the @xmath13 model , evaluated at zero frequency and along imaginary @xmath3 axis , also has an imaginary part for @xmath318 ( @xmath319 ) due to decay of a @xmath11 quanta into three others ( the simplest way to see this is to substitute a fixed - length constraint on @xmath320 field by the @xmath321 interaction term and do a perturbative expansion in @xmath322  @xcite ) .",
    "we , however , emphasize that this issue is irrelevant for the long - distance behavior of the spin correlation function as this behavior is associated with the lowest - energy ( @xmath323 ) pole , which is always stable .    a final remark .",
    "in this paper , we considered a field - theoretic description of the @xmath324 antiferromagnet .",
    "one can also study the anisotropic version of the @xmath1 model , with the extra factor @xmath325 in front of @xmath326 in ( [ zzz ] ) ( @xmath327 ) .",
    "for @xmath328 the gauge - field propagator acquires a mass , which prevents the effective potential @xmath269 in the schrodinger equation from becoming arbitrary large . as a result , even without damping , the number of poles in the staggered susceptibility decreases and finally , when @xmath239 exceeds some critical value , the disordered phase possesses deconfined @xmath38 bosonic spinons  @xcite .",
    "the disordered phase with deconfined spinons was also obtained in  @xcite by a direct @xmath0 expansion at small @xmath329 .",
    "this limit is of particular interest as the @xmath37 field model with @xmath330 describes incommensurate quantum antiferromagnet near the critical point .",
    "it is our pleasure to thank d. frenkel , g. reiter , s. sachdev , c.s.ting and p. wiegmann for useful discussions .",
    "the work was supported by the university of wisconsin - madison graduate school ( a.c . ) and by a grant from the state of texas ( o.s . ) .",
    "the contribution to @xmath335 of the same order of magnitude as in ( [ b5 ] ) ( @xmath336 ) could , in principle , also come from the region in the momentum space where @xmath337 , while the values of the angles are arbitrary .",
    "however , we have verified by direct calculations that the net contribution to @xmath335 from this region is zero to order @xmath338 ."
