    "the subsystem @xmath14 is analogous to the inside of a black hole horizon for an observer sitting in @xmath13 , i.e. , outside of the horizon .",
    "indeed , an original motivation of the entanglement entropy was its similarity to the bekenstein - hawking entropy @xcite .",
    "the entanglement entropy is of growing importance in many fields of physics in our exploration for better understanding of quantum systems .",
    "for example , in a modern trend of condensed matter physics it has been becoming clear that quantum phases of matter need to be characterized by their pattern of entanglement encoded in many - body wave functions of ground states , rather than conventional order parameters @xcite .",
    "recently , the entanglement entropy has been extensively studied in low - dimensional quantum many - body systems as a new tool to investigate the nature of quantum criticality ( refer to @xcite and references therein for example ) .    for one - dimensional ( 1d ) quantum many - body systems at criticality ( i.e. 2d cft )",

    "a comprehensive gravitational interpretation of the entanglement entropy has been lacking so far . here , we present a simple proposal on this issue in the light of ads / cft duality .",
    "earlier discussions from different viewpoints can be found in e.g. papers  @xcite .",

    "intuitively , this suggests that the minimal surface @xmath37 plays the role of a holographic screen for an observer who is only accessible to the subsystem @xmath13 .",
    "we show explicitly the relation ( [ arealaw ] ) in the lowest dimensional case @xmath38 , where @xmath34 is given by a geodesic line in ads@xmath3 .",

    "we can also define the entanglement entropy at finite temperature @xmath41 .",

    "the subsystem @xmath13 is the region @xmath56 .",

    "the minimal surface provides the severest entropy bound when we fix its boundary condition . in our case",

    "then we expect that the entropy can be computed from the geodesic distance between the boundary points @xmath74 at a fixed time . to find the geodesic line , it is useful to remember the familiar fact that the euclidean btz black hole at temperature @xmath75 is equivalent to the thermal ads@xmath3 at temperature @xmath76 .",
    "this equivalence can be interpreted as a modular transformation in the cft side @xcite .",
    "if we define the new coordinates @xmath77 then the metric ( [ btz ] ) indeed becomes the euclidean version of ads@xmath3 metric ( [ ads ] ) .",
