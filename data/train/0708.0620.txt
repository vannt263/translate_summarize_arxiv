    "in the early works of albrecht , magueijo and barrow @xcite for presenting a varying speed of light theory , the lorentz invariance is broken and thus there is a preferred frame to formulate the physical laws .",
    "these authors have assumed that there is a preferred frame in which the speed of light is only a time dependent field and this frame is identified with the cosmological frame . moreover in this theory a minimal coupling principle is assumed . according to it , in the preferred frame",
    "the curvature and the einstein s tensor are computed by fixing the speed of light .",
    "thus the einstein s equations do nt have any correction terms in this frame and one should only replace a fixed speed of light by a time ",
    "dependent one .",
    "although this theory has the ability to solve some of the problems of the standard big ",
    "bang cosmological models@xcite , it is not covariant and the comoving time is chosen as a specific time coordinate .",
    "therefore varying speed of light theory in its minimal formulation starts from the einstein - hilbert action in which the speed of light is substituted by a scalar field .",
    "in addition the matter lagrangian is assumed to be explicitly independent of the velocity of light and a term in the lagrangian is introduced which depends only on the velocity of light field in order to determine its dynamic .    in order to make more simplification",
    ", barrow @xcite considers cases called pre ",
    "set @xmath0 in which the speed of light varies as a power of the expansion factor and so there is no dynamical term in the lagrangian for the velocity of light .",
    "it is shown that it is possible to generalize these ideas @xcite to have a varying speed of light theory , in addition to preserving the general covariance and local lorentz invariance .",
    "the price that have to be paid for this is to introduce a time  like coordinate @xmath1 which is not necessarily equal to @xmath2 . in terms of @xmath1 and @xmath3 , one has local lorentz invariance and general covariance .",
    "the physical time @xmath4 , can only be defined when @xmath5 is integrable .",
    "of course introduction of a varying speed of light in the einstein - hilbert action is not unique .",
    "this is because of the fact that multiplying it by any power of light velocity and then introducing a varying speed of light would give different results .",
    "this leads a more general theory@xcite .",
    "moreover the cosmological constant generally depends on the velocity of light .",
    "if one assumes that it has field theoretical origin , it should scales as @xmath6 . in general",
    "one can assume @xmath7 dependence for the cosmological constant @xcite .",
    "( see @xcite and references therein for a comprehensive review of varying speed of light theories . )",
    "using quantum cosmology with varying speed of light , the semiclassical tunneling probability in a minimal coupling model with pre ",
    "set @xmath0 is disscused in @xcite and it is shown that it is different from the corresponding one in quantum cosmology with constant velocity of light .",
    "furthermore in @xcite the quantum cosmological aspects of the minimal varying speed of light theory is discussed considering cosmological constant term and instantons .    on the other hand , applying bohmian causal interpretation of quantum mechanics to quantum cosmology has several positive aspects compared to the copenhagen interpretation@xcite .",
    "for example , it provides time evolution of dynamical variables via bohmian trajectories , whether the wavefunction depends or not on the time variable .",
    "it also leads to the possibility to avoid the initial singularity via the quantum force .",
    "it can lead to a graceful exit from inflation epoch .",
    "investiagation of causal interpretation of quantum cosmological models with varying speed of light could be fruitful .",
    "it is interesting to see how the admission to the velocity of light to be a function of cosmological time can affect the bohmian trajectories in early universe .    here",
    "we shall consider the general action of @xcite and find it s exact classical cosmological solution for the flat universe and with or without cosmological constant , but without matter fields .",
    "after this we shall quantize this model and obtain the exact solutions of wheeler  dewitt equation for flat and non  flat and with or without cosmological constant .",
    "we shall show that it is possible to present a causal interpretation of the theory .",
    "the quantum trajectories are calculated and compared with the classical ones .",
    "the model for varying speed of light theory we use here is the one presented in @xcite , with the action functional : @xmath8 in which @xmath9 , @xmath10 is a constant velocity and we put @xmath11 .",
    "we also have a dynamical term for the velocity of light with the coupling constant @xmath12 , and @xmath13 represent matter fields . in the above action",
    "one assumes that the @xmath6 factor of einstein  hilbert action is broken into a part @xmath14 behind the gravitational term of the action and a part @xmath15 behind the matter term . in order to remain faithful to the standard action of general relativity",
    ", one should set @xmath16 .",
    "another point is that , here we have assumed that there is a time  like coordinate @xmath1 , which is not equal to @xmath2 .",
    "in fact , since @xmath0 is a field , @xmath17 is not necessarily integrable .",
    "therefore definition of physical time is only possible when one can integrate @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "here we shall deal with the minisuperspace of isotropic and homogeneous cosmology . denoting derivative with respect to the coordinate @xmath1 with a dot , the action functional for a flrw model would be : @xmath18\\right .\\ ] ] @xmath19",
    "in which @xmath20 is the three ",
    "space volume and @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the cosmological constant , the scale factor and curvature parameter respectively . depending on the nature of the cosmological constant one can distinguish two cases .",
    "first , gravitational cosmological constant @xmath24 which we assume that it is a fundamental constant of dimension @xmath25 and hence it is @xmath26independent .",
    "second , field theoretical cosmological constant ( i.e. one obtained from the field theoretical vacuum contribution to the cosmological constant ) @xmath27 . in this paper",
    "we shall choose @xmath28 .",
    "the corresponding canonical momenta are : @xmath29 @xmath30 @xmath31 the hamiltonian can be calculated as : @xmath32 @xmath33 where : @xmath34 @xmath35 @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the zero  zero component of the energy - momentum tensor of the matter field .",
    "let us choose @xmath38 in this section .",
    "we shall distinguish three cases . by a @xmath0dominated universe we mean @xmath39 .",
    "a @xmath40dominated universe means that @xmath41 but @xmath42 is not zero and is of gravitational kind , that is @xmath26independent .",
    "finally a @xmath43dominated universe is one with @xmath41 and @xmath44 .",
    "the classical equations of motion in this case can be derived from the action ( [ act ] ) via putting @xmath41 and @xmath45 .",
    "they are : @xmath46 @xmath47 these equations have the following solutions : @xmath48 @xmath49 where @xmath50 and @xmath51 are one of these cases : @xmath52 the first solution is the flat minkowski space ",
    "time , with constant speed of light . for the other two cases time can be defined as : @xmath53 so that : @xmath54 @xmath55 depending on the values of @xmath56 and @xmath12 these can be either decreasing or increasing functions of time . in order to solve the horizon problem of cosmology",
    ", one should set @xcite @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "this leads to some limitations on @xmath50 and @xmath51 ( and therefore on @xmath56 and @xmath12 ) : @xmath59      the equations of motion are : @xmath60 @xmath61 with the following solutions : @xmath62 @xmath63 where @xmath64 and @xmath65 are one of these four possibilities : @xmath66 although all of these solutions are acceptable , but the third one leads to anti  de sitter space ",
    "time for @xmath67 and @xmath68 and the fourth one is de sitter space ",
    "time in this limit .",
    "time can be defined as : @xmath69 so that : @xmath70 @xmath71 in this case the speed of light decreases as time increases .",
    "again the horizon problem can be solved provided : @xmath72      the equations of motion are : @xmath73 @xmath74 with the solution : @xmath75 @xmath76 where @xmath77 and @xmath78 satisfy these algebraic equations : @xmath79 @xmath80    in this case time is defined as : @xmath81 and thus : @xmath82 @xmath83 again the speed of light is a decreasing function of time , and the solution of horizon problem leads to : @xmath84",
    "the classical model of previous sections can be quantized through the method of canonical quantization , i.e. by setting @xmath85 , @xmath86 and @xmath87 in the hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) . here",
    "we set @xmath88 and ignore factor ordering ambiguity . since the theory is invariant under @xmath1 reparametrization , the hamiltonian should be set equal to zero , and the wdw equation is then : @xmath89 @xmath90 in which @xmath91 is the wavefunctional .",
    "let us now try to solve the wdw equation for some cases .",
    "the wdw equation would be : @xmath92 this equation can be solved via separation of variables method leading to the general solution :    * @xmath38 @xmath93 where @xmath94 the general solution is the linear combination of this solution .",
    "* @xmath95 @xmath96 where @xmath97 @xmath98 @xmath99      here we choose @xmath38 .",
    "the wdw equation would be : @xmath100 with the solution : @xmath101 where : @xmath102 @xmath103 @xmath104      again choosing @xmath38",
    ". the wdw equation would be : @xmath105 with the solution : @xmath106 where : @xmath107 @xmath108 @xmath109",
    "it is shown by de - broglie and bohm@xcite that it is possible to build a causal interpretation on the top of quantum theory .",
    "this is achieved by adding some axioms to quantum theory and removing some others . in de - broglie ",
    "bohm theory , the state of the system is denoted by @xmath110 in which @xmath65 represents the degrees of freedom of the system , @xmath111 is the wavefunction , and @xmath112 is the trajectory of the system .",
    "the wavefunction dynamics is governed by schrdinger equation , while the trajectory is defined via the _ guidance relation _ , @xmath113 .",
    "@xmath114 is the conjugate momentum of @xmath65 , and @xmath115 is @xmath116 times the phase of the wavefunction .",
    "therefore what is added to quantum theory is that the state of the system is not determined by the wavefunction only , but one should add the trajectory of the system to it .    on the other hand in de - broglie ",
    "bohm theory one does not need to use the projection axiom of the quantum theory .",
    "in fact , it can be shown easily@xcite that when some property of the system is measured , the trajectory of the system is such that after a very short time the state of the system is one of eigenstates of the observable and the probability of finding any eigenvalue is given by the born law .",
    "therefore de - broglie ",
    "bohm theory has not the measurement axiom .    in this way , the quantum theory of de - broglie ",
    "bohm , which we shall call causal quantum theory , is really a different theory from quantum theory .",
    "all of these things are motivated by decomposing the schrdinger equation into two parts , by writing @xmath117 . in this way one",
    "gets two equations .",
    "one of them is the continuity equation with @xmath118 as the ensemble density and the other one is a hamilton ",
    "jacobi equation , with some additional term called _ quantum potential _ which is responsible for quantum behaviours .    for our model",
    ", the causal interpretation can be derived very easily via putting @xmath119 in equation ( [ wdw ] ) .",
    "here we neglected matter part for simplicity .",
    "the result is : @xmath120 @xmath121 where the first term of the latter equation is the hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) in which @xmath122 and @xmath123 are replaced by @xmath124 and @xmath125 respectively .",
    "this is the hamilton ",
    "jacobi equation with the additional quantum potential term : @xmath126 the bohmian trajectories can be evaluated via the guidance relations : @xmath127 @xmath128",
    "bohmian trajectories highly depends on the wavefunction of the system . for example",
    "if the wavefunction is real , the guidance relation leads to zero conjugate momenta .",
    "but if one chooses some general linear combination of real solutions , one would get a non  trivial trajectory .",
    "this shows that one can not speak of bohmian trajectories and their difference with the classical ones without specifying that which linear combination of independent solutions of the wdw equation is chosen to be the wavefunction .",
    "one criteria for choosing the wavefunction could be having classical limit .",
    "that is one may fix the linear combination via requiring that for large times , say , the bohmian trajectories tends to the classical one , in other words the quantum potential is ignorable in comparison to the classical potential for large times@xcite .",
    "it must be noted that in general , it is not possible to find solutions with classical limit , i.e. making the quantum potential going to zero . as an example , it is shown recently@xcite that for nonseparable dynamical quantum systems bohmian trajectories never can approach the classical ones .    in what follows we shall choose specific wavefunctions and investigate the corresponding bohmian trajectories for flat universe to demonstrate how these trajectories can be .",
    "let us choose the wavefunction of this case as : @xmath129 which leads to the conjugate momenta : @xmath130 @xmath131 and thus the bohmian trajectories are given by equations : @xmath132 @xmath133 these two equations can be combined to give the relations @xmath134 where @xmath77 is a constant of integration and @xmath135 therefore we have @xmath136 @xmath137 since @xmath0 is a function of @xmath1 only , the time can be defined as before : @xmath138 in terms of this physical time we have : @xmath139 @xmath140 comparison with the classical solution shows that it could or could not be the classical solution .",
    "in fact there are specific choices of @xmath56 and @xmath12 that the bohmian trajectories and the classical ones coincides .",
    "this solution is a contracting universe which has no horizon problem ( @xmath141 and @xmath142 ) .",
    "the quantum potential for this solution is : @xmath143      now let us choose a more realistic wavefunction for this case , a wavefunction which leads to trajectories tending to the classical ones for large scale factors . using the asymptotic forms of bessel functions : @xmath144",
    "@xmath145 one observes that a linear combination of the form : @xmath146 has correct limit . for large @xmath147",
    "the phase of the wavefunction is : @xmath148 so that : @xmath149 @xmath150 and the equations of motion are : @xmath151 @xmath152 with solutions : @xmath153 @xmath154 time is equal to : @xmath155 so that in terms of time we have : @xmath156 @xmath157 comparison with the classical solution shows that we have the correct limit .",
    "the quantum potential is now : @xmath158 which is ignorable in comparison to the classical potential when @xmath147 is large .    for small @xmath147 , using the expansions : @xmath159 @xmath160 the phase of the wavefunction is @xmath161 the canonical momenta are then : @xmath162 @xmath163 and the equations of motion are : @xmath164 @xmath165 in which : @xmath166 and @xmath167 dividing these two equations we have @xmath168 and the solution is :",
    "@xmath169 @xmath170 where @xmath171 @xmath172 the quantum potential can be calculated as : @xmath173 in order to illustrate how could the bohmian trajectories be , we present here some plots of trajectories and quantum potential .",
    "first we choose @xmath174 and @xmath175 .",
    "the quantum potential for this case is plotted in figure ( [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "= 3.98 in    the classical and quantum trajectories of the scale factor and the velocity of light are plotted in figures ( [ fig2 ] ) and ( [ fig3 ] ) .",
    "it is clear that the trajectories tends to classical ones for large times . in this classical limit",
    "the quantum potential goes to zero .",
    "= 3.15 in    = 3.2 in    as a second example we choose @xmath176 and @xmath177 .",
    "the quantum potential , the classical and quantum trajectories of the scale factor and the velocity of light are plotted in figures ( [ fig4 ] ) , ( [ fig5 ] ) and ( [ fig6 ] ) . again the trajectories tends to classical ones for large times and the quantum potential goes to zero .",
    "= 3.95 in    = 3.3 in    = 3.27 in      since the wavefunctions in this case are very similar to the previous case , so are the trajectories and we do not present it here .",
    "in this paper we have obtained the bohmian trajectories corresponding to a varying speed of light theory .",
    "this trajectories are shown that can have correct classical limits .",
    "we have done this for a matter free universe so that only we are able to see the status of the horizon problem for the trajectories . in order to disscuss about other cosmological problems like the flatness problem",
    ", one needs to extend the model to the universes with matter . for this",
    "we have to solve the wdw equation with matter fields and obtain the bohmian trajectories using the method of @xcite .",
    "we shall do this in a forthcomming paper .",
    "it must be noted that the specific choice of the linear combination in equation ( [ asd ] ) imposes the boundary condition that the wavefunction behaves as an outgoing wave .",
    "this is what expected , because in a region where one has classical limit , one expects that bohmian trajectories and the wkb path coincide .",
    "therefore the appearance of an outgoing wave as the boundary condition is the sign of having the classical limit .",
    "another important thing should be noted here that although the investigation of whether these solutions of wdw equation have unitary evolution needs addition of matter fields ( as it is discussed in the literature , see e.g. @xcite ) , but since the the linear combination of the equation ( [ asd ] ) have only outgoing wkb wave limit , it would have a unitary evolution , see @xcite . for other linear combinations of the solutions it is suitable to choose a wavepacket with compact support to have unitary evolution .",
    "we studied here the solutions which have the classical limit , but as the reader may noticed the classical singularity is not avoided e.g. in the figure ( [ fig5 ] ) .",
    "it is possible to choose the parameters in such a way that the classical singularity is avoided but the classical limit is not present .",
    "the fact that quantum force has the ability to stop gravity from making things singular is wellknown and disscused in the literature@xcite .",
    "the possibility of having nonsingular solutions with correct classical limit would be disscused in future works for more realistic cases when matter is present .    at this end",
    ", it should be noted that we have ignored factor ordering ambiguity . in the causal approach to quantum cosmology , although the form of quantum potential depends on the regularization and factor ordering , but there are some general results that are independent of the specific factor ordering chosen .",
    "for example it is shown@xcite that the quantum constraint algebra is independent of factor ordering .",
    "also the general results obtained here do not change dramatically with respect to the factor ordering .",
    "this is the reason why we have ignored it in this paper",
