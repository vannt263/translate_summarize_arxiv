    "in the causal set approach to discrete quantum gravity , a causal set ( causet ) represents a possible universe at a certain time instant and a possible `` completed '' universe is represented by a path of growing causets @xcite .",
    "just as covariance dictates that the laws of physics are independent of the coordinate system employed , in the discrete theory , covariance implies that order isomorphic causets should be identified .",
    "that is , a causet should be independent of labeling .",
    "this is unfortunate because it is very convenient to work with labeled causets . at a fundamental level ,",
    "the labeling specifies the `` birth order '' of the vertices of a causet .",
    "although covariance dictates that a causet should be independent of the birth order of its vertices , this order is useful in keeping track of the causets .",
    "in particular , the labeled offspring of a labeled causet possess a natural lexicographic total order .",
    "this lexicographic order together with its level uniquely specify a labeled causet in terms of a sequence of positive integers .",
    "although there are many more labeled causets than unlabeled causets , their graph structure is much simpler .",
    "this is because the graph of labeled causets forms a tree which implies that each labeled causet has a unique producer ( predecessor ) and hence possesses a unique history .",
    "this unique history structure makes it much simpler to construct a candidate quantum dynamics to form a quantum sequential growth process ( qsgp ) which is the basis for this approach to discrete quantum gravity .",
    "even though the graphic structure @xmath0 of unlabeled causets is quite complicated , the graphic structure @xmath1 of labeled causets is simple .",
    "a qsgp consists of a sequence @xmath2 of hilbert space operators , and it is more straightforward to construct these operators for @xmath3 then for @xmath4 .",
    "the main point of this paper is that even though the qsgp @xmath2 for @xmath3 can be arbitrary and need not satisfy any covariance conditions , we can `` compress '' @xmath2 to form a qsgp @xmath5 on @xmath4 that is automatically covariant .",
    "we thus obtain the surprising result that any quantum dynamics on @xmath3 compresses in a natural way to a quantum dynamics on @xmath4 .",
    "as one might suspect , there is a price to be paid for this fortunate circumstance . since there are usually many ways to label an unlabeled causet , the compression map is many - to - one which results in a multiplicity factor .",
    "this factor increases with @xmath6 and may affect the convergence of quantum measures . in this way ,",
    "events in @xmath3with finite quantum measure may have corresponding events in @xmath4 with infinite quantum measure .",
    "we also observe that this procedure is not reversible .",
    "that is , a qsgp on @xmath4 may not be `` expandable '' to a qsgp on @xmath3 .",
    "this indicates that although many qsgps on @xmath4 can be constructed using this method , not all can , so it is not completely general . in the last section of this article",
    "we show that a natural metric can be defined on labeled and unlabeled causets and on their paths .",
    "a finite partially ordered set is called a _ causet_. in this section we treat only unlabeled causets and two isomorphic causets are considered to be identical .",
    "let @xmath7 be the collection of all causets of cardinality @xmath6 , @xmath8 , and let @xmath9 be the collection of all causets . if @xmath10 are elements of a causet @xmath11 , we interpret the order @xmath12 as meaning that @xmath13 is in the causal future of @xmath14 . if @xmath12 and there is no @xmath15 with @xmath16 , then @xmath14 is a _ parent _ of @xmath13 and @xmath13",

    "we have seen that @xmath115 is a qsgp for @xmath3 .",
    "the corresponding qsgp @xmath342 for @xmath4 becomes @xmath360 hence , @xmath361 we conclude that @xmath362 it follows that @xmath363 and in particular , @xmath364    we say that an ap @xmath359 on @xmath3 is _ covariant _ if @xmath365 is independent of the labeling of @xmath38 ; that is , @xmath366 whenever @xmath367 . of course , for a covariant transition amplitude @xmath110 , the corresponding ap @xmath359 is covariant . if the ap @xmath359 on @xmath3 is covariant , then @xmath368 where @xmath369 , @xmath370 .",

    "we have seen in section  3 that any @xmath153 is uniquely determined by its succession sequence @xmath378 if @xmath379 has succession sequence @xmath380 we write @xmath381 is @xmath219 precedes @xmath382 lexicographically : @xmath383 for some @xmath168 with @xmath384 . then @xmath385 is a total order on @xmath141",
