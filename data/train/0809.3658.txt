    "since the superconducting state in the cuprates evolves from the doping of a mott insulator , it is natural to conjecture that the pairing is driven by magnetic fluctuations rather than by phonons .",
    "quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) calculations provide evidence for d - wave pairing@xcite , where the pairing bosons reside predominantly in the ( transverse ) spin channel .",
    "recent debate in this connection has centered on whether or not the magnetic resonance peak is strong enough to account for the condensation energy@xcite .",
    "although recent estimates seem to be affirmative@xcite , they do not take into account competing pairbreaking effects which enter the eliashberg equations@xcite . also , there are arguments that high - energy excitations play a role@xcite . here",
    "we report a computation of @xmath0 s for the hole - doped cuprates based on the one - band hubbard model , where the full magnetic response of the system is included , and the eliashberg equations are then solved selfconsistently to obtain the superconducting properties over a wide range of dopings and temperatures . the resulting transition temperatures and pairing gaps are found to be comparable to experimental values , showing clearly the viability of the magnetic mechanism in the cuprates .",
    "we find that excitations at both high and low energies are important .",
    "early calculations of magnetic pairing in the cuprates employed parametrized models of the susceptibility .",
    "the analysis of radtke , et al .",
    "( ruln)@xcite invokes neutron scattering measurements , while that of millis , et al .",
    "( mmp)@xcite is based on nmr data . the model @xmath0 s so obtained lead to divergent predictions concerning the feasibility of magnetic mechanism@xcite .",
    "our d - wave pairing weight @xmath1 contains not only a low - energy peak ( lep ) from near-@xmath2 scattering , but also an additional high energy feature ( hef ) extending to @xmath31.5 ev dominated by other regions of the brillouin zone ( bz ) , as well as a significant pairbreaking contribution at low energies from ferromagnetic fluctuations .",
    "the hef , which was missing in the ruln and mmp models turns out to be crucially important in producing high transition temperatures and pairing gaps .",
    "the pairbreaking terms begin to dominate as the fermi energy approaches the van hove singularity ( vhs ) with increasing doping and can lead to the loss of superconductivity .",
    "our study bears on the recently discovered ` waterfall ' or high - energy kink ( hek ) features observed over 0.3 - 1.2 ev range in the angle - resolved photoemission ( arpes ) spectra of a number of cuprates . the magnetic susceptibility underlying our computation of @xmath0 s yields self - energies and dispersions consistent with the waterfall effects@xcite , suggesting that the boson responsible for the waterfall effects is also a key player in generating significant pairing weight in @xmath1 and high condensation energy in the cuprates .",
    "the calculations are based on a one - band hubbard hamiltonian , extended to include pairing interaction .",
    "specifically , in terms of susceptibility @xmath4 and the hubbard on - site repulsion @xmath5 , we use the singlet pairing potential@xcite @xmath6 and the mass renormalization potential ( eq .  [ 8 ] of ref .",
    "( a ) ) @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the electron momenta , which are constrained to lie on the fermi surface . here @xmath10 [ @xmath11 is the potential contributing to the normal [ anomalous ] part of the self energy .",
    "these expressions have been found to give transition temperatures in good agreement with qmc results@xcite .",
    "the resulting coupling constants in various pairing channels @xmath12 are @xmath13 where @xmath14 for the even parity channels .",
    "the normalized weighting function @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the fermi velocity and @xmath17 .",
    "the @xmath18 are weighting functions of various symmetry@xcite , of which the most important are the lowest harmonics of @xmath19-wave and @xmath20 symmetry , with @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "we also define the coupling constant @xmath23 via the @xmath19-wave version of eq .",
    "[ eq:4 ] with @xmath24 .",
    "then the effective bcs coupling is @xmath25 .",
    "the symmetrized eliashberg functions then are @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the imaginary part of the corresponding @xmath28 .    in the presence of strong magnetic fluctuations migdal",
    "s theorem is not obeyed@xcite .",
    "we have developed a relatively simple approximation scheme@xcite which can successfully reproduce the pseudogap and waterfall phenomena in the normal state of the cuprates over the full doping range . in the overdoped regime , this scheme reduces to calculating the self - energy in gw approximation , using a reduced @xmath29 and dispersion renormalized via @xmath30.@xcite these values of @xmath5 and @xmath31 yield self - energies in reasonable accord with the qmc results@xcite and explain the recently observed waterfall effects in photoemission spectra of the cuprates.@xcite we therefore expect these parameters to be most appropriate near @xmath32 , but to gain some understanding of how the band structure would affect superconductivity in the absence of pseudogap effects , we solved the eliashberg equations over the full doping range @xmath33 , assuming @xmath31 and @xmath5 to be doping independent . a more satisfactory procedure would be to let @xmath5 increase in the underdoped regime .",
    "however , in the presence of a pseudogap , a tensor system of eliashberg equations needs to be solved , and that is beyond the scope of the present calculation . in short",
    ", we proceed thus by solving eqs .  1 and  2 using @xmath29 and @xmath4 renormalized by @xmath31 .",
    "in particular , we neglect the additional modifications of migdal s theorem in the superconducting state . despite this limitation ,",
    "our results provide a benchmark for the eliashberg formulation in that we do not invoke empirical susceptibilities as has been the case in much of the existing literature .",
    "concerning technical details , we use a tight - binding parametrization of the dispersion of bi2212 , with the bilayer splitting neglected.@xcite @xmath4 is first computed within the rpa scheme throughout the bz for frequencies up to 2.88 ev .",
    "@xmath0 s and the @xmath34 s are then computed from eqs . 1 - 4 .",
    "fermi surface restricted eliashberg equations@xcite are finally used to selfconsistently obtain the gap @xmath35 and renormalization @xmath36 functions , with @xmath37.@xcite",
    "figure  [ fig:1 ] , which compares our typical d - wave pairing weights @xmath1 and @xmath38 with ruln and mmp models , highlights our key finding .",
    "our @xmath1 ( green line ) in ( a ) displays two clear features@xcite : a low energy peak ( lep ) around 40 mev and a broad high energy hump - like feature ( hef ) extending from @xmath39 ev ( see also fig .",
    "2(a ) below ) .",
    "the lep arises mainly from the magnetic response near @xmath2 , but the hef is connected with the response from other parts of the bz , particularly near @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "our lep in ( a ) is similar to the weights assumed by ruln and mmp .",
    "this resemblance is not surprising since the ruln model@xcite was designed to match neutron scattering data near @xmath2 , while the nmr data utilized by mmp@xcite is also most sensitive to weight in this part of the bz .",
    "it has long been known that neutron scattering near @xmath2 accounts for only about 1/8th of the integrated spectral weight expected from a total scattering sum rule@xcite . by basing their estimate solely on the neutron scattering data near @xmath2",
    ", ruln severely underestimated the total d - wave pairing weight .",
    "the mmp analysis , based on nmr data , appears to have captured more of the weight@xmath42although still missing the hef and thus underestimating the total weight .",
    "note also from fig .",
    "1(b ) that both models strongly underestimate the renormalization weight @xmath38 , which opposes the tendency for pairing .",
    "the negative dip in fig .",
    "1(a ) at energies below 20 mev deserves comment .",
    "this dip reflects pair - breaking magnetic scattering ( pbs ) near @xmath43 and was overlooked in the phenomenological ruln and mmp models . for simplicity , we will refer to these fluctuations as being ferromagnetic ( fm ) , although this is strictly so only at @xmath43 .",
    "this pbs is related to earlier indications of fm instabilities near a vhs@xcite .",
    "a similar scenario of competing d - wave pairing vs pairbreaking effects has been discussed in the context of electron - phonon pairing@xcite .",
    "figure  2 shows how @xmath0 s evolve with doping . in ( a ) ,",
    "the pairing weight in the high energy feature of @xmath1 is seen to increase monotonically with increasing doping , displaying an approximate isosbestic point at @xmath44  ev . in the low energy region in ( c ) , position of the peak in @xmath1 shifts to lower energies with increasing doping , and the negative pair breaking peak grows dramatically , consistent with the suggestion of kopp et al.@xcite .",
    "the nature of @xmath1 is seen to change quite substantially as the fermi energy approaches the vhs at around @xmath45 .",
    "interestingly , by comparing ( c ) and ( d ) , the low energy peak in @xmath38 is seen to follow that in @xmath1 to lower energies with doping .",
    "figure  [ fig:3 ] shows the doping dependence of @xmath23 , @xmath46 and the low temperature gap @xmath47 .",
    "three different estimates of @xmath23 are compared in ( a ) for illustrative purposes .",
    "values based on using the bare susceptibility , @xmath48 ( red dashed line ) , are seen to be quite similar to the simple estimate @xmath49 ( green dotted line ) , where @xmath50 is the density - of - states at the fermi energy .",
    "the full @xmath10 ( blue line ) on the other hand yields a significant enhancement of @xmath23 over that obtained from @xmath4 , especially near the region of the vhs peak , indicating that the system is close to a magnetic instability .",
    "note that @xmath46 is positive for dopings less than @xmath51 0.4 , but as the fermi energy enters the region of the vhs with increasing doping , @xmath46 rapidly becomes large and negative due to fm fluctuations .",
    "( c ) shows that this doping dependence of @xmath46 is well correlated with that of the pairing gap .",
    "we stress that these results hold for a _",
    "pure @xmath20 order parameter .",
    "_ harmonic content plays an important role , as will be discussed below , section iii .",
    "we turn now to discuss our solutions of the eliashberg equations . following common practice , we proceeded by discretizing the @xmath0 s on the real frequency axis.@xcite we find that our results are sensitive to the number @xmath52 of points in the mesh . for the present calculations , based on a 768-point non - uniform mesh over @xmath53 ev , the gap @xmath35 is approximately converged in the low-@xmath54 regime , allowing us to extract @xmath55 .",
    "figure  4(a ) shows typical results for the real part of @xmath35 for a range of temperatures at @xmath56 .",
    "the prominent oscillations in @xmath57 curves are the well - known consequence of discretizing @xmath0 s in solving the eliashberg equations.@xcite we define the gap by taking the intersection of the @xmath58 line ( thin black line in fig .",
    "4(a ) ) with the @xmath59 curve .    fig .",
    "4(b ) shows how the computed low - energy gap @xmath60 evolves with temperature at various dopings . due to the difficulty of finding well - converged solutions",
    "when @xmath61 is small , we calculate @xmath62 at a few low temperatures , and use a fit to a @xmath63-wave bcs gap to estimate @xmath64 .",
    "we find @xmath65 for different dopings .",
    "the resulting t@xmath66 s are somewhat smaller than qmc values@xcite , perhaps the effect of a finite @xmath67 .",
    "it is striking that the gap features in fig .",
    "4(a ) extend to very high energies , raising the obvious question as to how this high - energy tail would show up in tunneling spectra.@xcite insight in this regard is provided by fig .  5 , where we show a typical tunneling spectrum computed@xcite within our model .",
    "[ tunneling spectra computed at other dopings are similar , except that the features scale with @xmath60 . ] the weight in fig .",
    "5 at energies above the peak - dip - hump feature is seen to be quite small with weak energy dependence ( see inset ) and would not be readily observable in the presence of an experimental background .",
    "within the present model , the lep and hef _ both _ play an essential role in generating large gaps .",
    "for example , at @xmath68 , the hef by itself produces a gap of only @xmath69  mev , while the lep is virtually nonsuperconducting , even though the full @xmath1 yields a gap of 5.5 mev . [ to be definite , we separate @xmath0 into lep and hef at the minimum in @xmath0 , @xmath70  ev .",
    "] similarly , for @xmath71=0.1 , lep [ hef ] by itself has a @xmath33 [ 0.4 ] mev gap , with a combined gap of @xmath317  mev , with @xmath72  ev .",
    "this behavior can be readily understood from a 2-@xmath34 model.@xcite since this is a purely electronic mechanism , we use a modified allen - dynes",
    "formula@xcite @xmath73 @xmath74 , with @xmath75 and @xmath76 the allen - dynes equation has a well - known limitation@xcite that it predicts a maximum @xmath77 , whereas the eliashberg equations have a solution that grows without limit @xmath78 as @xmath79 .",
    "we find that this leads to an underestimate of @xmath80 , while the model provides good estimates for the remaining gaps .",
    "for instance , for @xmath81 , @xmath82=0.15 , @xmath83  83  mev , @xmath84  530  mev , so @xmath85  0.26  mev , and @xmath86  1.4  mev .",
    "when both features are combined , @xmath87  200  mev and @xmath88 , leading to @xmath89  mev , in good agreement with the full calculation .",
    "while the allen - dynes model is highly simplified , it does capture the observed trend that both peaks contribute significantly .",
    "physically , the effective @xmath34 is in the weak coupling regime , @xmath90 , so high @xmath64 arises from the large @xmath91 , and the large boost from combining lep and hef arises since @xmath92 .",
    "clearly , an electron - phonon coupling could play a similar role in further enhancing @xmath64 .",
    "the above calculations have been limited to a pure @xmath63-wave gap symmetry , without harmonic content . in tetragonal symmetry there are five symmetry classes of superconducting gap , and each class can involve higher harmonics of the given symmetry@xcite . while we have not solved the tensor eliashberg equations , it is straightforward to generalize the @xmath34 calculations to include harmonic structure and to calculate the leading @xmath34 eigenvalue for each symmetry class .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:6 ] following the analysis of ref .  .",
    "we see that : ( 1 ) the pure-@xmath63 analysis of section  ii holds in the low doping regime ; ( 2 ) near the vhs , harmonic content stabilizes d - wave symmetry , leading to the largest gaps ; ( 3 ) in this regime , other symmetries can become comparable to d - wave . in particular , there is a tendency toward @xmath19-wave pairing in the overdoped case .",
    "in summary , we have shown that within the present model the d - wave pairing weights @xmath1 and @xmath38 extend to very high energies of @xmath3 1 ev when the magnetic response of the system is properly taken into account .",
    "the associated superconducting gap is quite substantial , being around 16 mev at low dopings .",
    "@xmath1 is found to contain not only the expected low energy peak ( lep ) below 200 mev , but a previously unrecognized high energy feature ( hef ) over 0.3 - 1.2 ev .",
    "we find that the lep and hef both play an important role in yielding a large gap in our model .",
    "this suggests that electron - phonon coupling could be important for further enhancing @xmath64 as suggested by the isotope effect@xcite .",
    "the gap spectrum @xmath93 generally extends to the limit of @xmath0 ( @xmath31.5  ev ) , and may provide insight into a number of anomalous features connected with optical properties of the cuprates , summarized for example in ref .  .",
    "the scarcity of high-@xmath64 superconductors arises in part from the fact that when superconducting pairing is sufficiently strong , corresponding and stronger instabilities arise in other channels .",
    "we have for the most part neglected the effects of competing phases , but it is clear that they will be significant , both in the underdoped regime and near the vhs .",
    "near the vhs pairbreaking ferromagnetic scattering increases sharply , strongly suppressing a pure @xmath63-wave gap .",
    "while we find that inclusion of harmonic content could stabilize a d - wave superconductor even at the vhs , we have not accounted for a competing fm instability . indeed , storey , et",
    "al.@xcite find that in bi-2212 the vhs induces strong pair breaking , suppressing superconductivity , so that optimum @xmath64 falls at a doping below the vhs .",
    "this is consistent with the evidence for strong fm pairbreaking adduced by kopp et al.@xcite    to conclude , we have demonstrated that , when realistic @xmath0 s are used to solve the eliashberg equations , the magnetic mechanism is capable of producing transition temperatures and pairing gaps comparable in size to those observed experimentally in the cuprates . the low values of these key superconducting properties found in earlier calculations are directly attributable to the fact that neutron scattering sees only a fraction of the total magnetic spectral weight in these materials .",
