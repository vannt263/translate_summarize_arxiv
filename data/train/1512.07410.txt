    "our results suggest that such fragmentation originates from high - lying vibrational states near the dissociation threshold which have a long lifetime of hundreds of nanoseconds up to a few microseconds .",
    "we present quantum chemical simulations which indicate that such high - lying vibrational states could be populated through strong field double ionization induced vibrational excitation on an electronically excited state , or by intersystem crossing ( transition between states of different spin multiplicity ) @xcite from an electronically excited state to the electronic ground state .",

    ".    a long pipico line can be also formed by fragmentation happening long after the laser induced double ionization , during the flight of the dications to the detector . to confirm such fragmentation process , we simulated the time of flight of c@xmath9h@xmath10 and h@xmath11 for the case in which there is a time delay between ionization and fragmentation . before fragmentation , the ethylene dication flies towards the detector due to the weak dc field applied in the spectrometer . at the time of fragmentation",

    "[ fig : pipico](a ) .",
    "these points perfectly overlap with the measured long pipico line .",

    "however , to distinguish the desired signal we take into account only the data points with a survival time of longer than @xmath24 ns , which exclusively originate from the long - lived dications .",

    "the momentum of the proton in the detector plane , which is gained during the deprotonation process from long - lived dications , can be calculated from the measured survival time and the position on the detector . in our measurement , the minimum data acquisition integration time is on the order of 1 ns which is much longer than the rotational period of the ethylene molecule which is about 18 ps @xcite .",
    "therefore any laser induced alignment effect will be smearing out , which leads the 3d momentum distribution of the protons to be isotropic . for a certain tof ,",
    "the retrieved momentum distribution in the detector plane is a projection of the 3d isotropic sphere onto a 2d plane .",
    "therefore , to get the correct 2d momentum distribution , an abel - transform needs to be applied to the raw momentum distribution @xcite . from the retrieved momentum ,",

    "no dependence on laser parameters also indicates that the vibronic states with a long lifetime , leading to the delayed deprotonation , are not populated by laser - induced excitation from lower - lying states .",
    "in the following we will discuss the mechanism behind the long lifetime of ethylene dications , leading to the delayed deprotonation process .    in recent studies we found that electronically excited states of the ethylene dication",

    "the theoretical calculations thus support the hypothesis of near - dissociation - threshold tunneling as the origin of the long - lived dications . by slightly varying the pecs",
    ", we confirmed that the lifetimes of the high - lying vibrational states are very sensitive to the exact shape of the potential . a slight change of the barrier height can result in an order - of - magnitude change of the lifetime .",
    "therefore , it is not meaningful to make a quantitative comparison of the computed lifetimes with the experimentally determined values . on the other hand ,",
    "the lifetimes of the highest vibrational levels of the two excited states are on the order of femtosecond and picoseconds , which supports the prompt deprotonation process .",

    "this indicates that the high - lying vibrational states can be directly populated through strong field double ionization through removing at least one homo-1 electron .      from the acetylene measurements we retrieved the decay rate of long - lived acetylene dication for the deprotonation process .",

    ", we presented the observation of similar deprotonation processes in ethylene and acetylene . in the neutral state ,",
    "the main difference between the two species is that ethylene has a c  c double bond and acetylene has a c  c triple bond .",
    "their dications also have significant difference , due to the different electronic configuration .    as presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : pes](b ) , the three lowest electronic states of the acetylene dication are meta - stable .",
    "the lowest state is the electronic ground dication state which is a triplet state .",
    "it is formed by removal of two electrons with the same spin , one from homo and the other one from the degenerate homo-1 .",
    "the other two states are , however , formed by removal of two electrons with different spins either both from homo or one from homo and the other from homo-1 .",
    "all three electronic states can be populated via strong laser field induced double ionization .",
    "similar to the electronic ground state of the ethylene dication , the low - lying vibrational levels will be dominantly populated during the double ionization process from the neutral acetylene due to rather small fc factors between high - lying vibrational states of these three states and the vibrational ground state of the neutral acetylene .",
    "the population in the low - lying vibrational states of the electronic ground state contributes to the measured stable acetylene dications whose survival time are longer than their tof to the detector .",
    "similar to ethylene , to support the delayed deprotonation process , the nuclear wave packet needs to be prepared on a high - lying vibrational state near the dissociation threshold of an electronic state in acetylene dication .",
    "we note that direct vibrational excitation through ionization to near - threshold vibrational states on an electronic state of the acetylene dication is very unlikely due to the small fc factors .",
    "however , the population in the two upper meta - stable electronic states can possibly decay nonradiatively into the high - lying vibrational states of the electronic ground state via a spin flip transition ( intersystem crossing )",
    ". some of the populated high - lying vibrational states can be close to the dissociation threshold along the c ",
    "h stretching and the nuclear wave packet might tunnel through the dissociation barrier and lead to slow deprotonation .    finally , it is noted , that an alternative explanation that may explain the slow deprotonation process both for ethylene and acetylene is over - the - barrier dissociation . in this case , the dissociation in principle might proceed on a metastable electronic state , from a vibrational state that has an energy slightly larger than the potential barrier .",
    "although the one - dimensional model for the deprotonation along the c - h stretching coordinate suggests that the fc factor for such above barrier vibrational states should be very small for pecs similar to the neutral ground state pec ( such as the electronic ground state of ethylene and the three lowest lying electronic states of acetylene ) , that is not necessarily the case .",
    "if the possibility of excitation in other vibrational modes is also considered , the multidimensional vibrational wave packet could have larger energy than the barrier along the c - h stretching , while simultaneously its projection onto the c - h stretching coordinate could have a simple structure corresponding to a significant fc factor . this way , both above barrier continuum states leading to fast deprotonation , and above barrier feshbach type resonances @xcite leading to slow deprotonation could be formed .",
    "quantitative simulation of this mechanism , however , requires accurate global potential energy surfaces and multidimensional wave packet propagations , which is a formidable task , and was not attempted in this work . using the rice - ramsperger - kassel - marcus ( rrkm ) theory , in @xcite , the rate constant @xmath39 for the dissociation of c@xmath9h@xmath40@xmath41c@xmath9h@xmath42@xmath43h@xmath11 on the electronic ground triplet pes was estimated to be @xmath44 s@xmath27 for a total internal energy of about 1 ev above the dissociation barrier .",
    "although this value of @xmath39 is too large to explain the experimentally measured @xmath3s - order lifetime , we note that @xmath39 is expected to decrease if the total energy decreases to a value only slightly larger than the barrier height .",
    "in conclusion , we experimentally and theoretically studied the slow fragmentation of hydrocarbon dications following double ionization by a strong laser field .",
    "a possible scenario of the slow deprotonation process in ethylene , which is consistent with the simple theoretical model applied in this work is as follows . in the first step , an ethylene molecule is doubly ionized by removing at least one homo-1 electron .",
    "this prepares the dication in an electronically excited state . due to the frank - condon principle",
    ", high - lying vibrational states on the electronically excited states will be populated through strong field double ionization .",
    "such high - lying vibrational states can later tunnel through the dissociation barrier along the c ",
    "h stretching coordinate which leads to the slow deprotonation process . in acetylene , the slow deprotonation process probably occurs from the near - dissociation - threshold vibrational states in the electronic ground state .",
    "the mechanism for populating such states can be explained by vibrational excitation through intersystem transitions from electronically excited states to the electronic ground state . since vibrational excitation through double ionization and intersystem crossing are common processes in a variety of molecular systems , the slow deprotonation process observed in our experiment should play an important role in the strong field interaction with a variety of polyatomic molecules .",

    "<S> we experimentally and theoretically investigated the deprotonation process on nanosecond to microsecond timescale in ethylene and acetylene molecules , following their double ionization by a strong femtosecond laser field . in our experiments we utilized coincidence detection with the reaction microscope technique , and found that both the lifetime of the long - lived ethylene dication leading to the delayed deprotonation and the relative channel strength of the delayed deprotonation compared to the prompt one have no evident dependence on the laser pulse duration and the laser peak intensity . </S>",
    "<S> quantum chemical simulations suggest that such delayed fragmentation originates from the tunneling of near - dissociation - threshold vibrational states through a dissociation barrier on a dication electronic state along c  </S>",
    "<S> h stretching . </S>",
    "<S> such vibrational states can be populated through strong field double ionization induced vibrational excitation on an electronically excited state in the case of ethylene , and through intersystem crossing from electronically excited states to the electronic ground state in the case of acetylene .    </S>"
