    "molecular gas desorption from the beam - pipe wall due to synchrotron radiation should be properly taken into account in the design of high energy particle accelerators and storage rings .",
    "this has been a major ( solved ) challenge for the large hadron collider ; will be even more critical for the he - lhc , in view of its higher level of synchrotron radiation @xcite , and will be a _ crucial _",
    "issue for the successful operation of the proposed electron - positron higgs factories @xcite .",
    "+ in the cern large hadron collider @xcite a copper - coated stainless - steel beam pipe ( the _ liner _ ) is kept at @xmath0 by active helium cooling , and effectively handles the heat load represented by synchrotron radiation , photoelectrons , and image - charge losses . a large number ( @xmath1 @xmath2 ) of tiny slots",
    "are drilled in the liner wall ( see figure [ fig_1 ] ) in order to maintain the desorbed gas densities below a critical level ( e.g. , @xmath3 @xmath4 for @xmath5 ) by allowing desorbed gas to be continuously cryopumped toward the stainless steel cold bore ( co - axial to the liner ) of the superconducting magnets , which is kept at @xmath6 by superfluid helium . above such critical density levels , nuclear scattering in the residual gas",
    "would limit the beam luminositity lifetime , eventually originate high energy protons which may cause thermal runaway , and ultimately cause quenching of the superconducting magnets .",
    "+    [ ! h ]        the size , geometry , placement and density of the pumping slots affect the beam dynamics and stability in a way which is synthetically described by the longitudinal and transverse beam coupling impedances @xcite .",
    "the slot geometry and placement should be further chosen so as to minimize the effect of trapped ( cut - off ) modes , and to prevent the possible coherent buildup of radiation in the tem waveguide limited by ( the outer surface of ) the pipe and the cold bore @xcite .",
    "+ open - cell conducting foams could be interesting candidate materials to help fulfilling the above general requirements in beam liner design .",
    "in addition , the surface roughness of conducting foams may help reducing the effective secondary - emission yield ( sey ) @xcite , thus alleviating the electron - cloud build - up phenomenon @xcite , and related instabilities @xcite . in this paper",
    "we present a brief review of open cell conducting foams properties and modeling tools , and discuss at a very preliminary level the pros and cons of their possible use in high synchrotron radiation accelerator beam liners .",
    "open cell metal foams ( ocmf ) can be produced by vapor ( or electro ) deposition of metal on an open cell polymer template , followed by polymer burn - off , and a final sintering step to densify the ligaments .",
    "alternatively , they can be synthetised by infiltration / casting of molten metal into a solid mould , consisting of packed ( non - permeable ) templates of the foam pores , followed by burn - out and removal of the mould @xcite .",
    "both processes result into highly gas - permeable _ reticular _ materials , where only a 3d web of thin conducting ligaments survives .",
    "the typical structure of ocmfs is displayed in figure [ fig_2 ] .    [ !",
    "h ]        the key structural parameters of ocmf are the `` pore '' size , and the porosity ( volume fraction of pores ) .",
    "pore sizes in the range from @xmath7 to @xmath8 @xmath9 and porosities in the range 0.7 - 0.99 are typical .",
    "these two parameters determine the gas - permeability of the material , and , together with the electrical properties of the metal matrix , its electrical characteristics .",
    "ocmf have remarkable structural properties ( low density and weight , high ( tensile and shear)-strength to weight ratio , nearly isotropic load response , low coefficient of thermal expansion ) , as summarized in table i , which qualified them among the most interesting new materials for aerospace applications .    . _",
    "structural properties of al and cu open cell metal foams from @xcite . _ [ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      + as seen from table iii , the copper wall resistance is larger than that of the ocmf up to @xmath10 . on the other hand , as anticipated in section [ sec : drude ] , the ocmf wall reactance is relatively large , and exceeds significantly that of a perfectly conducting slotted wall as well as that of solid copper .",
    "+ however , as seen from figure [ fig_5 ] , a typical ocmf wall pumping capacity ( escape probability ) is several times larger than that of the  best  slotted wall",
    ". thus , to obtain the same pumping capacity , the patched beam - liner surface needed in the ocmf case is only a small fraction of that for the slotted case .",
    "this makes easier to place the ocmf patches where the ( unperturbed ) field in eq .",
    "( [ eq : zz ] ) is minimum , so as to minimize their impact on the beam coupling impedance .",
    "+      perforations reduce the secondary emission yield ( sey ) of a metal wall by a factor roughly proportional to the solid fraction of the surface @xcite .",
    "+ the sey of metals is strongly reduced by surface roughening , obtained , e.g. , by powder blasting @xcite . for the special case of periodic rectangular grooves etched on a flat metal surface ,",
    "the sey dependence on the groove depth - to - spacing and width - to - thickness ratios has been investigated , indicating that larger ratios yield a smaller sey @xcite .",
    "+ carbon coating also reduces sey effectively @xcite , at the expense of some increase in wall resistance .",
    "+ it is reasonable to expect that ocmfs may exhibit a much lower sey compared to solid metals in view of their random - like surface roughness .",
    "the sey of an ocmf wall will depend on the effective roughness of its surface , which is a function of the foam porosity and average pore size .",
    "ocmf surface roughness , however , should be kept small enough , to prevent the blow up of wall rectance .",
    "no measurements of the sey of ocmfs are available yet , to the best of our knowledge , but should be straightforward @xcite .",
    "on the basis of the above discussion , some tentative conclusions can be drawn about the possible use of ocmf materials in the beam liners of high synchrotron radiation accelerators .",
    "+ the outgassing capabilities of ocmf patches can be better by a factor @xmath11 compared to the  best ",
    "slotted patches , and would accordingly allow to boost the molecular escape probability of beam pipes by roughly one order of magnitude , compared to present designs , while keeping the patched fraction of the beam - liner surface unchanged .",
    "+ the mechanical - structural properties of conducting foams should also be adequate to resist to eddy - current induced stresses , in view of their very morphology .",
    "+ a low sey is also expected , due to ocmf surface roughness , even though no experimental results are available yet .",
    "+ the ocmf surface resistance is very low , and almost frequency independent . on the other hand ,",
    "the ( inductive ) wall reactance of an ocmf patch is larger by roughly one order of magnitude compared to that of a perforated wall with comparable escape probability .",
    "this drawback could be mitigated by clever placement of the ocmf patches , and/or appropriate reactive loading of the ( solid portion of ) the pipe wall .",
    "+ in order to translate the above hints into effective design criteria , further modeling effort and substantial experimental work are in order .",
    "measurement of the complex surface impedance and sey of metal foams are now underway @xcite .",
    "+ we believe that such an effort is worth being pursued , and that the available modeling tools and technologies provide a good starting point for its successful implementation .",
    "this work has been sponsored in part by the italian institute for nuclear physics ( infn ) under the imca grant .",
