    "the representation theory of the @xmath0 superconformal algebra was long thought to be an obvious generalisation of the representation theory of the virasoro and @xmath2 superconformal algebra .",
    "it was first shown in @xcite that this is not quite the case ( see @xcite for some earlier results ) .",
    "in particular the structure of singular vectors turned out to be more involved than in the @xmath2 supersymmetric generalisation of the virasoro algebra .",
    "in @xcite it was noticed that some representations of the @xmath0 superconformal algebra contain subsingular vectors .",
    "however , only some explicit examples are known which are all constructed using the `` topological twisted '' algebra and then translated back via the topological `` untwisting '' .",
    "the examples found in this way showed that subsingular vectors exist but did not admit a systematic exploration of these .    in @xcite the representation theory of the topologically",
    "twisted @xmath0 superconformal algebra was treated via the representation theory of @xmath3 . by this approach some of the embedding diagrams for @xmath1",
    "were found in @xcite however , as the relation of the @xmath0 superconformal algebra with @xmath3 representations breaks down at @xmath1 not all embedding diagrams could be approached in this way . in @xcite a classification of all subsingular vectors for @xmath4 was tried , however , as was pointed out in @xcite , some cases seem to have been overlooked .",
    "our main aim in this paper is to clarify the structure of the embedding diagrams for central charge @xmath1 . to this end",
    "we pursue another route .",
    "the @xmath0 superconformal algebra possesses a family of outer automorphisms @xmath5 , called the spectral flow , which map the algebra to itself . for integer values of the flow parameter @xmath6",
    ", the neveu - schwarz sector is mapped to itself as is the ramond sector .",
    "we study the induced action of the spectral flow on the representations of the algebra .",
    "it is shown that the representations are mapped onto each other under spectral flow in a systematic manner .",
    "in particular the embedding diagrams can be grouped into a few categories which transform among themselves under spectral flow .",
    "furthermore we obtain an algorithm to derive subsingular vectors from singular vectors via spectral flow transformations .",
    "we show that only non - unitary representations posses subsingular vectors .",
    "although we only cover the representations with @xmath1 in detail , we briefly demonstrate that our techniques are applicable to representations with other values of the central charge in the case of the @xmath0 unitary minimal models .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in chapter",
    "[ sec : n2algebra ] we review some well known facts about the @xmath0 algebra and introduce the spectral flow to fix our conventions . in chapter",
    "[ sec : rep - flow ] we explore how the spectral flow acts on a given representation and how representations are transformed . in chapter",
    "[ sec : singular - flow ] we describe how singular vectors behave under spectral flow and how subsingular vectors arise under spectral flow transformations . in chapter",
    "[ sec : ramond - algebra ] we comment briefly on how the ramond algebra can be analysed by the same method . in chapter",
    "[ sec : characters - c=3 ] we derive the characters of a large class of representations and determine the action of the spectral flow on them .",
    "in order to check the consistency of the embedding diagrams derived above we also construct the characters for representations with subsingular vectors . in chapter",
    "[ sec : minimal ] we briefly describe how the same methods can be used for the unitary minimal models .",
    "chapter [ sec : conclusions ] contains further comments and outlooks .",
    "some technical proofs can be found in the appendix .",

    "the modes @xmath15 and @xmath16 are integral and the modes @xmath17 are half - integral whereas in the r sector all modes are integral .    the determinant formula of the ns sector of this algebra at level @xmath18 with relative charge @xmath19 was first written down in @xcite and proved in @xcite .",
    "it is given by @xmath20 where @xmath21 is defined by @xmath22 @xmath23 counts the states at level @xmath18 with relative charge @xmath19 .",

    "the functions @xmath32 and @xmath33 are given by @xmath34 if we set @xmath35 these formulas reduce quite drastically to @xmath36 and the determinant formula then reads @xmath37      we will denote _ verma modules _ by @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 denote weight and charge of the highest weight vector ( hwv ) .",
    "they are in general not irreducible representations but contain _ null vectors _",
    "i.e.   vectors whose inner product with any other vector vanishes .",
    "these vectors have to be quotiened out in order to obtain an irreducible representation .",
    "null vectors which by themselves are highest weight states , i.e.   which are annihilated by the action of any lowering operator , are called _ singular vectors_. they span submodules inside a verma module . the @xmath41 superconformal algebra furthermore possesses _ subsingular vectors _ which are null vectors that are neither singular vectors nor descendants of singular vectors .",
    "once the singular vectors are quotiened out subsingular vectors become ( new ) singular vectors .",
    "any highest weight representation is determined by the position of its singular ( and subsingular ) vectors .",
    "vanishing of the determinant formula ( [ eq : determinant2 ] ) signals null vectors at the given level and relative charge . at the level where vanishings first occur",
    "we then find a singular vector .",
    "as was already pointed out in @xcite , singular vectors can only exist with relative charge @xmath42 .",
    "the position and the relations among the singular vectors can be summarised in the _ embedding diagram _ of a given representation .",
    "we want to study the relations among the embedding diagrams under spectral flow transformations .",
    "the embedding diagrams of various highest weight representations were calculated in @xcite .",
    "unfortunately some of the results are incomplete as the assumption made that the representations of the @xmath0 superconformal algebra do not contain subsingular vectors does not hold .",
    "the first paper where subsingular vectors of the @xmath0 superconformal algebra were discovered was @xcite .",
    "the structure of the embedding diagrams depends mainly on the    1 .",
    "value of @xmath40 : only for @xmath43 ( and @xmath44 ) uncharged singular vectors exist , as can be seen from the determinant formula , in particular from the form of @xmath32 .",
    "2 .   value of @xmath45 : only if this value is half integer @xmath33 has zeros and thus only then charged singular vectors exist .",
    "there are a few different classes of representations we have to consider in the case of central charge @xmath1 .",
    "all representations with charged singular vectors appear in pairs : to any representation with charged singular vectors there exists a representation with the same embedding structure in which the relative charge of the singular vectors is reversed .",
    "this is a consequence of the mirror automorphism @xcite which connects representations that differ only by the sign of the @xmath9 charge .",
    "these representations are mapped onto each other by the mirror automorphism @xmath19 acting on the modes as follows @xmath46 therefore any statement about a representation with a given charge @xmath40 holds for the representation with charge @xmath47 , as well .    in figure",
    "[ fig : others ] we have summarised the embedding diagrams for which either @xmath48 or @xmath49 .",
    "these diagrams were already given in @xcite .",

    "we have marked some lines with arrows to denote which vectors are connected by operators . in all cases of singular vectors a raising operator connects a singular vector of lower level to a singular vector of higher level . in the case of subsingular vectors a lowering operator maps the subsingular vector to some ( descendant of a ) singular vector .    in figure",
    "[ fig : embeddingpositiv ] and [ fig : embeddingsub ] the relative charge of the charged singular vectors is given by the sign of @xmath52 .",
    "uncharged singular vectors arise at levels @xmath53 , charged singular vectors are given at levels @xmath54 . the diagrams iii@xmath55 ( figure [ fig : embeddingpositiv ] ) contain infinitely many uncharged and charged singular vectors .",
    "diagram iv in figure [ fig : embeddingpositiv ] is the embedding diagram for the vacuum representation .",
    "it contains two charged singular vectors at each level of the form @xmath56 with relative charge @xmath57 .",
    "the embedding diagrams given in figure [ fig : embeddingsub ] are the embedding diagrams of the representations with @xmath58 .",
    "embedding diagrams of this kind contain only finitely many charged singular vectors .",
    "the representations with @xmath59 and @xmath60 contain subsingular vectors .",
    "we have denoted these embedding diagrams by iii@xmath61 .",
    "representations with @xmath62 and @xmath63 constitute another special case .",
    "they have only one charged singular vector and possess subsingular vectors of higher charge .",
    "the associated embedding diagrams are denoted by iii@xmath64 .",
    "we have adopted the notation that the superscript on the label of a diagram denotes the relative charge of the charged singular vectors and a subscript denotes whether the value of @xmath39 is greater or smaller than zero in cases where the structure of the embedding diagrams is affected by the sign of @xmath39 .",
    "note that subsingular vectors arise only for representations with @xmath65 and that there exist subsingular vectors with relative charge greater than one .",
    "we were not able to prove the actual form of the embedding diagrams but we will show that they are compatible with the spectral flow .",

    "this family of automorphisms is called _ spectral flow _ @xcite . its action on the modes",
    "is given by @xmath93 where @xmath94 is called _",
    "flow parameter_. @xmath95 maps the ns and r sectors of the algebra to themselves whereas for @xmath96 the spectral flow maps the ns sector to the r sector and vice - versa .",
    "we will almost exclusively study the case in which @xmath97 acts on the ns sector .",
    "therefore from now on @xmath6 is assumed to be an integer unless otherwise stated .",
    "the action of the spectral flow on the operators of the algebra induces an action on the representations .",
    "we will take the point of view that under a spectral flow transformation the highest weight state we build representations upon is unchanged .",
    "however the action of the transformed modes on the same state gives rise to a new representation .",
    "in particular with respect to the new modes the previous highest weight vector might become a descendant state .",
    "this point of view has the advantage that the inner product of the vector space the modes act upon is manifestly unchanged .",
    "this implies that null vectors must be mapped to null vectors under spectral flow .",
    "as an example let us consider the spectral flow with flow parameter @xmath98 acting on some representation @xmath99 .",
    "by fixing @xmath100 we obtain @xmath101 this example already reveals a crucial observation , namely the spectral flow does not respect the highest weight condition because in general @xmath102 .",
    "let now be @xmath103 arbitrary .",
    "the highest weight condition for the fermionic operators expressed in the transformed modes is given by @xmath104 if we express the transformed modes in terms of the original modes condition ( [ eq : hwc ] ) becomes @xmath105 from which the second condition is not satisfied for @xmath106 .",
    "therefore the hwv changes under spectral flow and a descendant in the original module serves as the highest weight vector of the transformed modes .",
    "the highest weight state for the transformed modes is generically given by @xmath107 for @xmath108 the @xmath109 in formula ( [ eq : newhwv ] ) have to be interchanged with @xmath110 .",
    "with respect to the original modes the weight and charge of @xmath111 are given by @xmath112 the weight and charge of @xmath111 with respect to the transformed modes are given by @xmath113 let us for later convenience define @xmath114 the charge of the highest weight state generically does not change under spectral flow .",
    "note that we defined @xmath115 and @xmath116 to denote the eigenvalues of @xmath117 and @xmath118 respectively .",
    "there exists one exception to this construction namely if equation is satisfied in the sense that the state defined by equation is a null state .",
    "this was discussed in a slightly different context for @xmath4 in @xcite . in this case",
    "the `` correction '' of the highest weight state is not necessary and for the case @xmath119 the new highest weight state has weight and charge given by @xmath120 the formula for general @xmath6 is slightly more complicated .",
    "unless @xmath121 is a singular vector , @xmath122 can never be a descendant of a singular vector in the original representation .",
    "this can be seen as follows .",
    "let @xmath18 denote the level and @xmath19 the charge of a vector .",
    "for any given level @xmath18 there is a maximal value for the ratio @xmath123 .",
    "vectors of the form are exactly the vectors for which the ratio @xmath123 is maximal at their level . on the other hand singular vectors have at most charge one at some level @xmath124 .",
    "therefore any descendant null vector has a lower ratio of @xmath123 .",
    "the only singular vectors whose descendants could have a maximal ratio of @xmath123 are exactly @xmath121 .",
    "therefore if @xmath121 is not singular , @xmath111 will not be a singular vector with respect to the original representation .",
    "the construction of new singular vectors under spectral flow will prove to be essentially the same as for the highest weight state .",
    "as we shall see , the situations where the highest weight state is not shifted under spectral flow sometimes gives rise to subsingular vectors .",
    "this happens in particular in the non - unitarizable representations of type iii .",
    "we now discuss how the spectral flow acts on representations . as an easy exercise we will first address the action on the embedding diagrams shown in figure [ fig : others ] before we turn to the representations shown in the other diagrams .",
    "our aim is to identify which representations are connected under spectral flow and therefore to group the various representations into orbits under spectral flow transformations .",
    "these orbits will depend on the charge @xmath40 of the highest weight states and the relative sign between the highest weight and the charge .",
    "let us first turn to diagrams without any singular vectors , that is to diagrams of type @xmath125 in figure [ fig : others ] .",
    "the spectral flow only shifts the highest weight vector to another vector in the verma module .",
    "the construction of the highest weight vector is as shown in equation and the connection between the representations is the following @xmath126 for all values of @xmath6 .",
    "the situation is analogous for diagrams of type ii .",
    "the charge @xmath40 of the highest weight state does not change and therefore the position of the singular vector remains unchanged and equation describes the orbits of these representations , as well .    for diagrams of type",
    "i the situation is slightly more involved .",
    "as long as @xmath127 the situation is unchanged .",
    "however for @xmath128 one of the states @xmath121 is a singular vector .",
    "for definiteness let us choose @xmath129 to be the singular vector .",
    "if we now perform a spectral flow transformation with @xmath119 the highest weight condition is satisfied up to the singular vector .",
    "therefore the highest weight state after spectral flow is given by the original highest weight state and has highest weight and charge according to equations and . each pair of values for @xmath39 and @xmath40 such that @xmath128 gives rise to an orbit of the spectral flow . under spectral flow these representations",
    "are then mapped to representations whose value of @xmath39 differs by integer values @xmath130      let us now specify to values of @xmath39 and @xmath40 such that @xmath51 and @xmath131 .",
    "these representations correspond to the embedding diagrams of type iii of figures [ fig : embeddingpositiv ] and [ fig : embeddingsub ] .",
    "the representations corresponding to diagrams of this type have uncharged singular vectors at level @xmath53 with @xmath132 and charged singular vectors of relative charge @xmath133 of which the first is at level @xmath134 .",
    "spectral flow of these representations gives as new value for @xmath135 @xmath136 therefore representations of this class are mapped onto each other under spectral flow . in particular",
    "as long as the value of @xmath115 does not change sign with respect to @xmath39 , the value of @xmath40 remains unchanged .",
    "however , the existence of singular vectors might spoil the construction of the highest weight vector in some cases as described in section [ sec : flow ] .",
    "for @xmath119 the weight and charge with respect to the transformed modes are then given by equations and such that @xmath137 this indicates that the transformed representation has a negatively charged vector at level @xmath138 .",
    "this was to be expected as this singular vector is needed to reach the original representation by the inverse spectral flow transformation .",
    "we can now address the question of the orbit of a given representation under spectral flow .",
    "let us first assume that @xmath139 and @xmath140 .",
    "gathering together the various pieces of information we see that for @xmath141 the highest weight vector with respect to the transformed modes has weight and charge @xmath142 and for @xmath143 it has weight and charge @xmath144 .",
    "for @xmath145 the values of @xmath146 are @xmath147 . for @xmath148",
    "the new highest weights and charges are given by @xmath149 .",
    "therefore what characterises the orbits is the charge @xmath40 of the original highest weight vector .",
    "spectral flow transformations of representations with the highest weight vectors of the form @xmath150 create distinct orbits . excluding the case @xmath63 at the moment",
    "we can summarise the above by saying ( remember @xmath151 ) @xmath152 for the case @xmath153 , we obtain @xmath154 thus the roles of @xmath155 and @xmath156 are interchanged . in figure",
    "[ fig : typeiii ] we have sketched which representations of this class are connected via spectral flow .",
    "actually there exists a special case when we start off with a representation with @xmath157 .",
    "these embedding diagrams are mapped to the diagrams of type iii@xmath64 under spectral flow if we flow to negative values of @xmath39 .",
    "this is depicted in figure [ fig : star ] .    the case @xmath158 and @xmath159 is special . for @xmath98",
    "it is mapped to the vacuum representation : @xmath160 if we apply @xmath98 on the vacuum representation , we obtain the representation @xmath161 .",
    "this special case therefore can be summarised as @xmath162 this transition under spectral flow is shown in figure [ fig : type0 ] .",
    "to @xmath65,width=453 ]    , width=529 ]     to @xmath163,width=453 ]      the previous constructions show that a large class of representations for @xmath1 are mapped to representations with @xmath65 which are manifestly not unitary",
    ". however the unitary representations are mapped onto each other as the condition that @xmath164 is not sufficient to guarantee unitarity .    in @xcite",
    "the conditions for the existence of unitary representations of the @xmath0 algebra were given .",
    "for @xmath1 the relevant condition is given by @xmath165 which translates into the following conditions for @xmath39 and @xmath40 @xmath166 this implies that only diagrams of type i ( figure [ fig : others ] ) for @xmath167 and diagrams of type iii@xmath168 with @xmath63 and the vacuum representation ( type iv ) are unitary .",
    "under spectral flow unitary representations are mapped onto each other . for the type iv and type iii diagrams we can see this behaviour in the way the spectral flow only maps the diagrams with charge 0 , 1 , and @xmath169 onto each other . in diagrams of type i",
    "we can see that unitarity is preserved by the spectral flow from the following argument .",
    "let us consider some representation @xmath99 such that @xmath170 , @xmath164 and @xmath171 .",
    "after spectral flow towards lower values of @xmath39 the ratio of @xmath115 and @xmath40 will eventually be given by @xmath172 .",
    "at this point the existing singular vector at level @xmath138 alters the prescription of how the weight of the highest weight vector changes and we obtain ( c.f .",
    "equation ) @xmath173 which defines again a unitary representation ( note that @xmath171 ) .",
    "for @xmath174 we obtain @xmath175",
    "after writing down the orbits of representations it is important to ensure that the singular vectors of a given representation transform in a way consistent with the transformation properties of the highest weight vector . the basic idea behind this section is the observation that the spectral flow does not change the scalar product .",
    "in particular this implies that null vectors remain null vectors under spectral flow .",
    "we will first discuss the situation for generic singular vectors and then turn our attention to the representations where subsingular vectors arise from spectral flow .",
    "let us consider a singular vector @xmath176 of some representation .",
    "if we perform a spectral flow transformation on @xmath176 , it will in general not be mapped to a singular vector .",
    "however @xmath176 must be mapped to a null vector as the inner product is invariant under spectral flow .",
    "as only the mode numbers of fermionic operators are changed under spectral flow only some fermionic operator can fail to annihilate @xmath176 after a spectral flow transformation .",
    "if we look at the case for @xmath119 we observe , comparing with equations and , that @xmath177 fails to annihilate @xmath176 and the new singular vector is given by @xmath178 therefore singular vectors transform generically in the same way as the highest weight state and the structure of the embedding diagrams is ( generically ) unchanged .",
    "there are a few situations where the above considerations fail to give meaningful results .",
    "the first situation where this method fails is the one described preceding equations and .",
    "that is , if the highest weight vector does not change under spectral flow .",
    "the second situation can arise in representations with @xmath65 where the number of charged singular vectors changes .      in this section",
    "we want to show how spectral flow transformations dictate the existence and form of subsingular vectors in the representations under consideration .",
    "generally there are two classes of subsingular vectors : those with relative charge one and those with higher relative charge .",
    "as the situations where they arise are quite different we study both cases in turn .",
    "we will first consider the subsingular vectors of charge one .",
    "they can arise if we flow from a representation with @xmath164 to a representation with @xmath65 .      in this subsection",
    "we want to give evidence that the spectral flow transformations which are shown in figure [ fig : typeiii ] are correct . in order to do",
    "so we have to explain how the subsingular vector arises under spectral flow",
    ". we will first explain the spectral flow from diagrams with @xmath164 to diagrams with @xmath65 and then turn our attention to the spectral flow from the diagram with @xmath65 without a subsingular vector to the diagram with @xmath65 with a subsingular vector .",
    "consider the spectral flow with flow parameter @xmath98 of a representation of type iii@xmath179 with @xmath180 and @xmath181 to a representation of type iii@xmath182 , see figure [ fig : flow ] .",
    "in the original representation the state @xmath183 is a singular vector and therefore , as explained in section [ sec : flow ] , the highest weight vector remains the highest weight vector after spectral flow .",
    "with respect to the transformed modes weight and charge are given by @xmath184 therefore the embedding diagrams change from an infinite number of positively charged singular vectors to a finite number of negatively charged singular vectors as is shown in diagram [ fig : typeiii ] .",
    "consider now the action of the spectral flow on the singular vectors .",
    "the charged singular vectors are all descendants of the vector @xmath183 .",
    "this vector is mapped to @xmath185 and therefore is set to zero by the highest weight condition .",
    "this implies that all its descendants are mapped to zero as well .",
    "this is not true for the uncharged singular vector at level @xmath40 .",
    "if we call this vector @xmath186 , by general arguments of chapter [ sec : sing - vect ] we know that @xmath186 must be mapped to a null vector and furthermore @xmath187 must span some submodule . if we look at the embedding diagram of the representation after spectral flow we observe that all singular vectors are descendants of @xmath188 .",
    "the inverse spectral flow transformation maps @xmath189 to @xmath190 which is set identically to zero .",
    "as @xmath189 is identically zero after the inverse spectral flow transformation it follows that @xmath187 can not be a descendant of @xmath189 . nevertheless @xmath187 is a null vector .",
    "the resolution is that @xmath187 is a subsingular vector .",
    "more specifically @xmath191 is given by the uncharged singular vector @xmath176 , as can be seen as follows : suppose first of all @xmath192 .",
    "then @xmath187 is itself a singular vector of charge @xmath193 which is not allowed for a module with a negative ratio of @xmath45 .",
    "therefore @xmath191 must not vanish .",
    "however , all lowering operators applied to @xmath191 vanish and therefore @xmath191 is proportional to the uncharged singular vector @xmath176 .    on the other hand @xmath187",
    "can not be a descendant of @xmath176 because @xmath176 is a descendant of @xmath194 which is identically zero after the inverse spectral flow transformation .",
    "@xmath186 is a descendant of @xmath187 and therefore if @xmath187 were a descendant of @xmath176 so were @xmath186 .",
    "this would imply that @xmath186 had to vanish under the inverse spectral flow transformation . that @xmath186 is indeed a descendant of @xmath187",
    "can be seen as follows .",
    "we compute @xmath195 .",
    "the commutator in the untilded modes is given by @xmath196 and @xmath197 .",
    "therefore we conclude that @xmath187 is a subsingular vector .    in order to see how this matches with the spectral flow from representations with @xmath65",
    "let us start with the representation @xmath198 , @xmath199 .",
    "as has been explained in section [ sec : reps ] the number of charged singular vectors varies for representations of type iii@xmath182 with @xmath65 . the representations with @xmath39 and @xmath40 as given above",
    "have two charged singular vectors .",
    "the first one has level @xmath200 and the second one has level @xmath201 .",
    "let us call this charged singular vector @xmath176 .",
    "@xmath176 is a descendant of the first uncharged singular vector @xmath186 as can be read off from figure [ fig : flowm ] . comparing the levels of the singular vectors",
    "@xmath176 and @xmath186 we see that @xmath176 must be proportional to @xmath202 .",
    "now we consider a spectral flow transformation with flow parameter @xmath203 . under this spectral flow transformation @xmath176",
    "is mapped to @xmath204 . comparing this with the general result of formula",
    "we observe that after spectral flow @xmath204 itself already defines an uncharged singular vector .",
    "therefore , under spectral flow @xmath176 is mapped to an uncharged singular vector .",
    "the previous uncharged singular vector @xmath186 becomes subsingular because @xmath205 @xmath186 is not a descendant of @xmath176 because @xmath206 although a lowering operator maps @xmath186 to @xmath176 . by general arguments",
    "@xmath186 is a null vector .",
    "therefore it has to be a subsingular vector since there exist no singular vectors of which @xmath186 could be a descendant .    observe that the construction of the subsingular vector above depends crucially on the fact that there exists an uncharged singular vector whose @xmath207 descendant is a charged singular vector . in any representation with @xmath208 , @xmath43 , @xmath209",
    "there exists an uncharged singular vector which satisfies this condition .",
    "this singular vector is mapped to an analogue of @xmath186 under spectral flow and enjoys the same properties , namely that the application of @xmath210 maps it to a singular vector , however it is not the descendant of this singular vector . unlike in the case described above the analogue of @xmath186 is for higher values of @xmath211 a descendant of some other singular vector of lower level .",
    "it is only for the case @xmath212 that there is no other singular vector of which @xmath186 could be a descendant after spectral flow . the only singular vector with lower level than @xmath186 is the highest weight vector .",
    "therefore only in this case the subsingular vector appears in the embedding diagram because in all other cases it is a descendant state .      in diagrams of type iii@xmath64 there",
    "exist subsingular vectors of higher relative charge subsingular vectors of higher relative charge were first discussed in @xcite .",
    "however the example given there is not subsingular for @xmath1 .",
    "the subsingular vector constructed in @xcite is still a null vector for @xmath1 but it becomes a descendant state of a singular vector . ] .",
    "the embedding diagrams of the modules of type iii@xmath64 are shown in figure [ fig : embeddingsub ] .",
    "the easiest example of this type of subsingular vectors is given by @xmath213 as one can check , @xmath186 is not a descendant of any singular vector , in particular not a descendant of the first uncharged singular vector and application of the operator @xmath214 maps @xmath186 to the charged singular vector of the verma module .",
    "subsingular vectors of this type arise in all verma modules with @xmath63 , @xmath215 .",
    "before we comment on the behaviour under spectral flow let us construct these subsingular vectors for all representations in which they arise .",
    "let us first define for convenience @xmath216 we then observe @xmath217 furthermore , inspection shows that @xmath218 where @xmath219 denotes the uncharged singular vector at level one , see figure [ fig : example ] .",
    "these equations are proved in the appendix .",
    "therefore @xmath220 defines a subsingular vector as it is a null vector and as it is not possible to reach @xmath220 from @xmath219 , whereas applying an appropriate lowering operator maps @xmath220 to a descendant of @xmath219 .",
    "however it is not possible to map @xmath220 to @xmath219 itself .",
    "in the example above the descendant in question @xmath221 is the charged singular vector of the verma module . observe that @xmath220 is not annihilated by the operators @xmath222 .",
    "therefore , in general , it is not clear from the start which vector actually defines the subsingular vector of lowest level .",
    "the character formulae we calculate in chapter [ sec : characters - c=3 ] seem to indicate that the lowest lying subsingular vector is given by @xmath223 and thus has always a relative charge of two . in the examples we checked this vector",
    "was not a descendant of the singular vector @xmath219 , and therefore it was indeed the subsingular vector of lowest charge and level .",
    "vectors of the form as given by equation are mapped onto each other under spectral flow .",
    "they are the images of the singular vector @xmath224 under spectral flow .",
    "as mentioned in section [ sec : reps ] there exists only one charged singular vector in these embedding diagrams . by the general construction described in section [ sec : subsingular ]",
    "this charged singular vector is mapped to an uncharged singular vector under spectral flow with flow parameter @xmath203 .",
    "however a preimage of the `` new '' charged singular vector after spectral flow must exist .",
    "this preimage is given by the subsingular vectors .",
    "therefore subsingular vectors of higher charge are needed for consistency under spectral flow transformations .",
    "an ambiguity in the embedding diagrams arises when we consider subsingular vectors of higher charge .",
    "all subsingular vectors of this kind are mapped to descendants of the first uncharged singular vector @xmath219 however we can not construct an operator which maps the subsingular vector to the singular vector @xmath219 itself whereas the application of an appropriate lowering operator maps the subsingular vector to the charged singular vector .",
    "we have adopted the convention to connect the subsingular vector with the singular vector of lowest level whose descendant can be reached by any lowering operator .",
    "in this section we will briefly comment on the spectral flow between the neveu - schwarz and the ramond ( r ) algebra . as has been remarked in e.g.  @xcite",
    "the spectral flow connects the r and the ns algebra and they are essentially equivalent .",
    "the link between the highest weight representations is conveniently easy as spectral flow with @xmath225 maps ns ground states to r ground states .",
    "consider some highest weight state @xmath226 .",
    "under , say @xmath227 , the relevant modes are mapped to @xmath228 from this we see that the ns highest weight state remains a r highest weight state , if we employ the condition that @xmath229 .",
    "this is one of the two possible choices of which fermionic zero mode should annihilate the ground state .",
    "the other choice has to be made for @xmath230 . with this requirement",
    "the ns highest weight state is mapped to a r highest weight state with eigenvalue @xmath231 and charge @xmath232 .",
    "therefore the embedding diagrams of the r algebra have the same form as the embedding diagrams of the ns algebra .",
    "as an additional consistency check we calculated the characters of the ns algebra for some of the representations discussed previously and determined their behaviour under spectral flow .      the characters for the @xmath0 , @xmath1 algebra can be read off from the embedding diagrams .",
    "we discuss here only the characters of the type iii diagrams and of the vacuum representation . to obtain the remaining characters",
    "is a straightforward exercise .",
    "a general character over a representation @xmath233 of the superconformal algebra is defined as @xmath234 where @xmath235 and @xmath236 .",
    "the generic character of the verma module @xmath237 is given by to denote the charge . ]",
    "( see for example @xcite where the characters for the minimal models are discussed . )",
    "@xmath238 the character of the vacuum representation for @xmath1 is given by @xmath239 as we have to subtract the subrepresentations spanned by the singular vectors from the generic character .",
    "as discussed in @xcite the character of a submodule spanned by a charged singular vector of level @xmath18 is given by @xmath240 where @xmath241 is the level of the uncharged singular vector which is connected to the charged singular vector by some operator .",
    "the characters for type iii embedding diagrams without subsingular vectors are given by @xmath242 we have to divide out the first charged and uncharged singular vectors and add the second charged singular vector in again .",
    "otherwise we would subtract the charged singular vectors of higher level twice as they are descendants of both the first uncharged and charged singular vectors , see figure [ fig : embeddingpositiv ] and [ fig : embeddingsub ] .",
    "the characters of the embedding diagrams with subsingular vectors are special . for the type iii@xmath243 diagrams",
    "the characters are given by @xmath244 the first fraction has the usual form and accounts for the singular vectors which have to be divided out .",
    "the second fraction accounts for the subsingular vector which is annihilated by the operator @xmath245 , as can be seen from equation .",
    "therefore we have to divide out the states produced by the application of this particular operator .",
    "this character can be seen as a generalisation of the character for the vacuum representation as it has ( sub)singular vectors of opposite charge which have to be subtracted from the generic character .",
    "the characters for the embedding diagrams of type iii@xmath246 are more involved . for @xmath247 and @xmath248",
    "they are given by @xmath249 all singular vectors are descendants of the first uncharged singular vector and are thus subtracted by the first @xmath40 in .",
    "the subsingular vector is annihilated by two charged operators as described in section [ sec : more - sub ] .",
    "therefore analogously to the procedure for ordinary singular vectors both operators have to be divided out . in this case",
    "the modules created by the singular and the subsingular vector have an overlap and in order to prevent subtracting some vectors twice the correction given by the last fraction has to be added in again . in the easiest case for @xmath250 and",
    "@xmath248 the character formula reads @xmath251 and the overlap is given by the state @xmath252 for representations with higher values of @xmath211 this formula gets rather cumbersome but can be calculated explicitly , most conveniently via the application of spectral flow to equation .      as an additional consistency check we calculated the behaviour of the characters under spectral flow transformations .",
    "if we consider equation the obvious way how characters should transform under spectral flow is given by @xmath253 that is , the trace of the transformed operators over the original representation should equal the character of the representation defined by the eigenvalues @xmath115 and @xmath254 of @xmath117 and @xmath118 , respectively as defined in equation and .",
    "the term on the left hand side of equation can be rewritten to give ( for @xmath98 ) @xmath255 if we define @xmath256 the trace over the shifted operators can be written as @xmath257 the factor @xmath258 gives just a constant contribution to the trace .",
    "if we substitute this expression into the generic character of equation and then rewrite it again in terms of @xmath40 and @xmath259 we obtain @xmath260 where we have used the fact that @xmath261 .",
    "now let us consider the spectral flow of the vacuum representation . to be more explicit we choose @xmath98 and therefore we expect to obtain the character of the representation @xmath262 , @xmath263 .",
    "indeed , we get @xmath264 which can be rewritten as @xmath265    in the same fashion one can show that the other characters transform appropriately under spectral flow .",
    "in particular we can show that @xmath266 and @xmath267 as the calculations are essentially the same we will not demonstrate them here .",
    "we therefore conclude that the spectral flow transforms the characters among each other as expected .",
    "as an example how this technique can be applied to other values of the central charge , let us briefly demonstrate how spectral flow transformations act on the embedding diagrams of the unitary minimal models .",
    "the representation theory of the minimal models was extensively discussed , see for example @xcite or @xcite for earlier results .",
    "our definitions will closely follow @xcite .",
    "the unitary minimal models of the @xmath0 algebra can be parametrised by three parameters @xmath268 such that @xmath269 the embedding diagrams for the minimal models were given in @xcite .",
    "they have the form shown in figure [ fig : unitary ] . in this diagram",
    "we denote the highest weight vector by a square , singular vectors corresponding to kac - determinant vanishings are denoted by a filled circle and descendant singular vectors which do not correspond to kac - determinant vanishings are denoted by an unfilled circle .",
    "the unitary models have the feature that they possess ` uncharged fermionic singular vectors ' @xcite .",
    "these ( uncharged singular ) vectors possess charged singular vector descendants of only positive or negative charge . in the embedding diagram the uncharged fermionic singular vectors",
    "are denoted by arrows pointing to the right or to the left , respectively .",
    "the action of the spectral flow on the highest weight states of minimal models has been discussed in @xcite .",
    "analogously to the @xmath1 case one has to distinguish between a generic case where the highest weight vector after spectral flow is given by a descendant of the highest weight vector before spectral flow , and a special case where the descendant which would be the new highest weight vector is itself a singular vector .",
    "more precisely , a representation @xmath270 for fixed @xmath19 is generically transformed under spectral flow with flow parameter @xmath119 to the representation @xmath271 where the highest weight state is then given by @xmath272 . if @xmath273 , @xmath274 is a singular vector and the state @xmath275 is mapped to the highest weight state after spectral flow . in this case",
    "we find that the the representation @xmath276 is mapped to the representation @xmath277 .",
    "the same phenomenon occurs for @xmath278 and @xmath279 .",
    "this situation is analogous to the case for @xmath1 , if @xmath280 is a singular vector ( c.f .",
    "section [ sec : rep - flow ] ) .",
    "let us first analyse the generic case @xmath281 .",
    "for a generic spectral flow transformation with @xmath119 , the highest weight state after spectral flow is given by @xmath282 .",
    "in this case a singular vector @xmath176 of the representation @xmath270 is mapped to the singular vector @xmath283 .",
    "the levels of uncharged singular vectors are derived in @xcite .",
    "they are given by @xmath284 the combination @xmath285 is invariant under the generic spectral flow , therefore the levels of uncharged singular vectors remain unchanged",
    ". this should be the case as the level of an uncharged singular vector operator is not changed by spectral flow .",
    "the levels of charged singular vectors are given by @xmath286 as has been discussed in section [ sec : rep - flow ] , the levels of charged singular vectors are altered under spectral flow according to @xmath287 where @xmath288 is the singular vector analogue of . as we can read off from the levels of the charged singular vectors in the embedding diagrams transform accordingly .",
    "it can be shown that in the generic case , the spectral flow respects the splitting of the uncharged singular vectors into left and right fermionic uncharged singular vectors .",
    "the existence of uncharged fermionic singular vectors is due to the fact , that some products of singular vector operators vanish identically @xcite . under ( generic ) spectral flow transformations",
    "these vanishings are preserved .",
    "therefore the splitting of the uncharged singular vectors in left and right uncharged fermionic vectors is preserved under generic spectral flow transformations .",
    "let us now analyse the spectral flow of @xmath289 to @xmath290 .",
    "in the representation @xmath289 the vector @xmath291 is singular and therefore the highest weight vector remains a highest weight state after spectral flow .    in order to obtain a candidate for a singular vector from a singular vector after spectral flow",
    ", we have to correct the shifted modes , and the new singular vector would be given by @xmath283 .",
    "if we compare the levels of singular vectors before and after spectral flow and keep in mind that @xmath291 is mapped to @xmath292 and is therefore the new highest weight condition , the images of the uncharged singular vectors are at the levels of the positively charged singular vectors after spectral flow and the images of the negatively charged singular vectors are at the levels of the uncharged singular vectors .",
    "the descendants of @xmath293 vanish after spectral flow .",
    "however the highest weight condition @xmath294 is mapped to the singular vector @xmath295 . due to this fact the vectors @xmath283 which used to be singular vectors in the generic case",
    "are now mapped to null vectors , which are _ at least subsingular vectors_. i.e.  in general they are mapped to vectors of the appropriate level and charge to be singular vectors , however their image under spectral flow in general can be written as @xmath296 , where @xmath297 is a ( sub)singular vector operator",
    ". therefore these vectors are at least singular after dividing out @xmath298 .",
    "however the appearance of additional subsingular vectors would result in additional submodules of all representations .",
    "therefore we can conclude that singular vector are flown to linear combinations of ( descendants of ) singular vectors .    as a final remark",
    "let us mention that we checked the transformation properties of the characters of the minimal models ( for their form see e.g.  @xcite ) under spectral flow .",
    "similarly to the @xmath1 case it can be shown that they transform accordingly under spectral flow giving another argument that the spectral flow respects the embedding structure .",
    "we have analysed in detail the behaviour of representations and singular vectors of the @xmath0 superconformal algebra with central charge @xmath1 under spectral flow .",
    "the representations are mapped to representations of the same kind in orbits determined by the charge of the highest weight state .",
    "a careful analysis of the spectral flow of singular vectors predicts subsingular vectors in representations with @xmath65 . it would be interesting to understand if non - unitarity is a necessary condition for the existence of subsingular vectors in the @xmath0 algebra .",
    "furthermore it was possible to construct subsingular vectors with relative charge greater than two which were previously unknown .",
    "as an example how our technique can be used to analyse representations with other values of @xmath299 we applied it to the unitary minimal models and found the results consistent with the embedding diagrams .",
    "as an additional check we determined the action of the spectral flow on the characters and found complete agreement with the behaviour of the embedding diagrams . to this end we had to construct the characters for representations with subsingular vectors which , to our knowledge , have not been written down in the literature before .    as mentioned in the beginning",
    "we were not able to prove the actual form of the embedding diagrams .",
    "however the behaviour under spectral flow at least suggests that they are of the suggested form . as an additional check we performed some numerical tests .",
    "we calculated the inner product matrices up to level four and compared the dimension of their null - space with the dimension given by the null vectors we assume to exist .",
    "the dimensions of the null - spaces matched nicely with our expectations based on the embedding diagrams .",
    "we performed this test on various representations up to level four and found complete agreement .",
    "it is a pleasure to thank my phd supervisor matthias gaberdiel for support and helpful discussions , furthermore i would like to thank andreas recknagel , gerard watts and in particular matthias drrzapf and kevin graham for interesting discussions and matthew hartley for a very helpful perl script . the computation of the inner product matrices were done using maple and reduce .",
