    "spontaneous surface and interfacial instabilities of thin liquid films have been studied in different contexts , e.g. the classical saffman - taylor ( saffman _ et al _ 1958 ) problem in a hele shaw cell in which flow driven fingering patterns develop at the moving interface of two viscous or viscoelastic liquids ( homsy__et al _ _ 1981 , nittmann _ et al _ 1985 ) ; disjoining pressure induced rupturing and dewetting ( reiter _ et al _ 1992 , sharma _ et al _ 1998 ) of ultra thin viscous films ; spiral instabilities in viscometric flow of a viscoelastic liquid ( muller _ et al _ 1989 , mckinley _ et al _ 1995 ) ; and fingering instability and cavitation during peeling a layer of viscoelastic adhesive ( fields _ et al _ 1976 , urhama _ et al _ 1989 ) . while most of these viscous and viscoelastic systems have been well characterized experimentally and theoretically , similar surface undulations of confined thin elastic films pose a different kind of problem despite geometric commonalities with many of the liquid systems . the essential difference being that unlike in the liquid system there is no flow of mass and consequent permanent deformation in the elastic body , where the extent of deformation is governed by the equilibrium of the external surface or body forces on the material and the elastic forces developed .    the specific system that will be described in this paper is a thin layer of elastic adhesive confined between a rigid and a flexible plate .",
    "while the film remains strongly bonded to the rigid substrate , the flexible plate is detached from it in the classical peel geometry .",
    "high aspect ratio of such systems is noteworthy as the lateral length scale far exceeds the thickness of the film resulting in high degree of confinement for the adhesive . as a result ,",
    "adhesive stresses at the interface does not always result in uniform deformation through out the whole area of contact , rather spatially varying deformations ( gent _ et al _ 1958 , gent _ et al _ 1969 , ghatak _ et al _ 2000 , m@xmath0nch _ et al _ 2001 ) attain lower energy for the system . experimentally we see the existence of a critical thickness of the film or a critical curvature of the flexible plate below which the contact line between the film and the flexible plate does not remain straight , but turns undulatory with a characteristic wavelength which increases linearly with the thickness of the film ( ghatak _ et al _ 2003 ) . while experimentally this phenomenon has been characterized , there is not much understanding as what drives this instability in a non - flow purely elastic system and how does the curvature of the plate or the thickness of the film result in critical confinement of the film . here",
    "i present a perturbation analysis which addresses these questions highlighting the duel effects of the incompressibility of the elastic film and its confinement .",
    "the schematic of our experiment is represented in figure [ fig : fig1]a in which an elastic film of thickness @xmath1 and shear modulus @xmath2 remains strongly bonded to a rigid substrate while a flexible plate of rigidity @xmath3 in contact with the film in the form of a curved elastica is supported at one end using a spacer of height @xmath4 .",
    "the straight contact line between the film and the plate becomes wavy when the film thickness @xmath1 decreases below a critical value @xmath5 or the curvature of the plate decreases below a critical value @xmath6 .",
    "figure [ fig : fig1]b represents a typical video - micrograph of such undulations which are characterized by two different length scales : the separation distance @xmath7 between the waves which scales as @xmath8 and the amplitude @xmath9 which varies with @xmath3 and @xmath2 as : @xmath10 ( ghatak _ et al _ 2003 ) .",
    "the figure depicts also the co - ordinate system in which @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 axes represent respectively the direction of propagation of the contact line , the direction of the wave vector and the thickness coordinate of the film .",
    "the @xmath12 axis is located along the tips of the waves so that the film is completely out of contact with the plate at @xmath14 . assuming the film to be incompressible and purely elastic with no viscous effect , we write the following stress equilibrium relations in the absence of any body forces , @xmath15 where , @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the displacements in the @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 directions respectively and @xmath19 is the pressure . here and everywhere",
    "@xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "the incompressibility of the film results in : @xmath22 these equations are solved using the following set of boundary conditions ( b.c . ) : ( a ) since the film remains strongly bonded to the substrate we use no slip boundary condition at the interface of the film and the substrate ( @xmath23 ) , @xmath24 ( b ) we assume frictionless contact at the interface of the film and the cover plate , @xmath25 which results in zero shear stress at the interface , @xmath26 ( c ) we assume continuity of normal stress across the interface ( @xmath27 ) which implies that the pressure is equal to the bending stress on the plate @xmath28 here @xmath29 is the two dimensional laplacian , @xmath3 is the flexural rigidity of the plate and @xmath30 is its vertical displacement . since the plate bends only in the direction of @xmath11 co - ordinate its vertical displacement @xmath31 remains uniform along the @xmath12 axis ; hence , we simplify b.c .",
    "[ bc.c ] as @xmath32 at @xmath14 there is no traction either on the film or the plate which yields @xmath33 equation ( [ eq : eq1])-[eq : eq2 ] can be written in dimensionless form using the following dimensionless quantities , @xmath34 while thickness @xmath1 of the film is the characteristic lengths along the @xmath12 and @xmath13 axes , @xmath35 is that along @xmath11 .",
    "the length @xmath35 can be derived as the ratio of the deformability of the plate and the film ( dillard _ et al _ 1989 , ghatak _ et al _ 2004 ) : @xmath36 .",
    "the quantity @xmath37 defined as the ratio of the two characteristic lengths is a measure of the confinement of the film such that a lower value of @xmath38 represents a more confined film .",
    "equations [ eq : eq1 ] and [ eq : eq2 ] can then be written in the following dimensionless form @xmath39 while the boundary conditions [ bc.a]-[bc.d ] results @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the dimensionless crack length .",
    "equation [ eq : eq3 ] is solved by the regular perturbation technique which assumes that the solutions consist of two components : the base solutions which remain uniform along the @xmath42 co - ordinate and the correction term which incorporates the spatial variation along the @xmath42 axis .",
    "thus the base solutions are of order @xmath43 and the perturbed solutions are of order @xmath44 , so that any variable @xmath45 where @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 . inserting these definitions in equation [ eq : eq3 ] and separating the base ( @xmath42 independent ) and the perturbed ( @xmath42 dependent ) terms yield : @xmath50 and @xmath51 which are solved using b.c .",

    "et al _ 2004 ) finally leads to the following solution for the base components of the displacements in the film and the plate , @xmath54 which suggest oscillatory variation along @xmath55 with exponentially vanishing amplitude away from the contact line .",
    "such displacements results in the following expression for the dimensionless work of adhesion ( ghatak _ et al _ 2004 ) @xmath56 : @xmath57 in which @xmath58 is the correction to the classical result of obreimoff ( obreimoff _ et al _ 1930 ) for peeling off a rigid substrate .    *",

    ". equations [ eq : eq22 ] are solved using the following boundary conditions derived from [ bc.a ] , @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the vertical displacement of the flexible plate at @xmath70 .",
    "assumption of sinusoidal dependence on @xmath42 is a simplification which is apparent from the video micrographs of the contact line as in figure [ fig : fig1]b which show that the film and the plate remains in contact whole through the area of the finger implying that the deformation of the film is not perfectly sinusoidal , as it would mean a line contact between the plate and the film .",
    "however , here i assume sinusoidal variation to keep the calculations simple . since",
    ", the plate does not bend in the direction of @xmath42 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 both remain uniform along this axis ; consequently in b.c .",
    "[ eq : eq21]c , bending stress on the plate is equated to @xmath73 .",
    "equation [ eq : eq22 ] suggests that @xmath74 remains independent of @xmath42 and @xmath75 although @xmath76 varies along @xmath42 , hence , the only solution for @xmath74 that can satisfy equation [ eq : eq22 ] is @xmath77 .",
    "other components of the excess displacements are obtained as : @xmath78 here , only the lowest order terms in @xmath38 are computed since the higher order terms enhance accuracy insignificantly . since for all our experiments , @xmath79 , the above solutions imply that the excess deformations in the film occur under very small excess pressure which is of the order @xmath80 .",
    "this excess pressure , however small , varies along @xmath42 implying that it should depend upon the distance between the plate and the film . nevertheless , the excess traction which results from the distance dependent forces ( shenoy et al 2001 , sarkar et al 2004 ) apply only in the immediate vicinity ( @xmath81 m ) of the contact between the film and the plate as the gap between the two increases rather sharply ( could be observed in afm images of the permanent patterns of surface undulations ) .",
    "hence , it does not contribute any significantly to the overall energetics .",
    "while equation [ eq : eq24 ] elaborates the variation of excess deformations along @xmath42 and @xmath75 , their dependence on @xmath55 is incorporated through the coefficient @xmath82 which is obtained by solving equations [ eq : eq21]c using the following boundary conditions @xmath83 where , @xmath84 is the dimensionless amplitude of the waves and @xmath85 is the excess stretching of the film at @xmath86 : @xmath87 is a constant and @xmath88 .

    "stability of these systems is determined by the minima of the excess energy which if positive signifies stable base solution for the contact line and unstable solution if negative .",
    "for example , for @xmath152 @xmath142 remains positive all - through implying that the undulation of a straight contact line would increase the total energy of the system so that a straight contact line would remain stable .",
    "on the other hand , @xmath153 , presents a limiting case for which minima of the excess energy @xmath154 attains zero and for @xmath155 , @xmath156 , @xmath157 and @xmath158 , @xmath154 becomes negative , i.e. when the film is more than critically confined i.e. @xmath159 , the contact line can become unstable if sufficiently perturbed . the critical value @xmath160 thus obtained for the above set of data corroborates well with 0.3 obtained in experiments of figure [ fig : fig1 ] .",
    "furthermore , a finite energy barrier at @xmath161 suggests that a straight contact line is not unstable for perturbations of all magnitude . because , for perturbation with amplitude @xmath162 the excess energy remains positive so that these perturbations decay to zero .",
    "this result too corroborates with experiment that with increase in confinement of the film , the amplitude of the undulations never increases from exactly zero , but from a finite value .",
    "when @xmath163 , @xmath143 decreases to become negative , so that these perturbations can grow till @xmath121 reaches @xmath149 , at which @xmath142 attains the minima @xmath154 ; @xmath149 is then the predicted amplitude of the undulations of the contact line .",

    "although this prediction is somewhat different from experiments , in which @xmath38 varies between @xmath167 to @xmath157 at which @xmath122 is observed to be @xmath168 , some recent observations ( personal communication with prof .",
    "a. sharma ) with very thin elastic films ( @xmath169 m ) indeed indicate that @xmath122 can decrease to @xmath170 as @xmath38 decreases to @xmath171 .",
    "more experiments are clearly necessary to characterize quantitatively the effect of the coupling of the two length scales with highly confined elastic films .",
    "the analysis shows that confinement of an incompressible elastic film leads to favorable energetics for perturbations to grow so that the film can not deform uniformly everywhere when subjected to the tensile stresses at the interface .",
    "furthermore , the nature of the adhesion stress is not important , even the spatial variation of the surface forces play rather an insignificant role . while the theory captures the essential physics of the problem , slight overestimation of the amplitude possibly results from the assumption of sinusoidal variations along the @xmath42 axis which is not perfectly correct .",
    "these issues can possibly be resolved by 3d simulation of the force field near the contact line .",
