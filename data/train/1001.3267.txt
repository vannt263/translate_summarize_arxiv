    "one of the simplest models of the neighborhood of the cosmological singularity , inspired by string / m theory @xcite , is the compactified milne space , @xmath0 .",
    "it has been used in the cyclic universe scenario @xcite .",
    "this model seems to be attractive , because it consists of pre - singularity and post - singularity epochs and can be described in terms of _ quantum _ elementary objects propagating in _ classical _ spacetime .",
    "let us consider a two - dimensional spacetime with the line element : @xmath1 we identify the points @xmath2 for some fixed value of @xmath3 , so that @xmath4 . generalization of ( [ line1 ] ) to the @xmath5 dimensional spacetime , which will be denoted by @xmath0 , has the form : @xmath6 where @xmath7 .",
    "one term in the metric ( [ line2 ] ) disappears / appears at @xmath8 , thus the space @xmath0 may be used to model the big - crunch / big - bang type singularity .",
    "orbifolding @xmath9 to the segment gives a model of spacetime in the form of two orbifold planes which collide and re - emerge at @xmath8 .",
    "our results apply to both choices of topology of the compact dimension .    the polyakov action integral for a test @xmath10-brane ( i.e. @xmath11-brane = particle , @xmath12-brane = string , @xmath13-brane = membrane , @xmath14 ) embedded in a fixed background spacetime with metric @xmath15 reads : @xmath16\\ ] ] where @xmath17 is mass per unit of @xmath10-volume , @xmath18 are @xmath10-brane worldvolume coordinates , @xmath19 is @xmath10-brane worldvolume metric , @xmath20 $ ] , @xmath21 are embedding functions of @xmath10-brane , i.e. @xmath22 , corresponding to @xmath23 directions of @xmath5 dimensional background spacetime .",
    "the case of a particle propagating in @xmath0 is not clear and was studied in @xcite .",
    "propagation of classical string across the singularity of @xmath0 is the best example of how extended objects can successfully cure spacetime singularities . in what follows we use the _ local flatness _ of @xmath0 to solve the dynamics of a string .",
    "the well - known string s propagation in minkowski space is given by : @xmath24 @xmath25 where @xmath26 @xmath27 are minkowski coordinates and @xmath28 are any functions .",
    "the equations ( [ gauge2 ] ) are just gauge constraints . for _ winding _ modes @xmath29 in @xmath0 , where @xmath30 one shows in @xcite that the extra conditions hold : @xmath31 and @xmath32 satisfying the last condition is not straightforward and rests upon the fact that the dynamics is governed by a second order differential equation .",
    "thus it is sufficient to satisfy the condition ( [ deter ] ) by specifying @xmath33 , @xmath34 on a single cauchy s line . in this way one",
    "rules out one of the variables in ( [ deter ] ) and compares functions dependent on just a single variable .",
    "this strategy works @xcite and leads to the solutions : @xmath35 where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are constants .",
    "these solutions should satisfy the gauge conditions ( [ gauge2 ] ) , which in the case of @xmath0 read @xmath38 alternatively , the solutions ( [ solution2 ] ) in terms of @xmath39 and @xmath40 have the form @xmath41 where @xmath42 denotes @xmath42-th excitation . the number of arbitrary constants in ( [ gen ] ) can be reduced by the imposition of the gauge condition ( [ gauge ] ) .",
    "one observes that the above solutions are well - defined everywhere and it is reasonable to expect that the same holds for higher dimensional objects like classical membrane .",
    "the quantization should not spoil this as it was proven in the case of a string in @xcite .",

    ", one may use standard techniques , i.e. direct sum or tensor product of the representations of both subalgebras .",
    "now , following the dirac prescription one solves the quantum constraints , i.e. one looks for such @xmath67 that : @xmath68=0,~~n\\in{z}.\\ ] ] for @xmath69 the condition ( [ dirac ] ) reads : @xmath70~d\\sigma=0,~~n\\in{z},\\ ] ] which has the solution @xcite : @xmath71 where @xmath72 .",
    "this is an expected result since the measure @xmath73{\\prod_{\\mu}|\\acute{y}^{\\mu}|^{\\rho^{\\mu}}}d\\sigma$ ] is invariant with respect to @xmath74-diffeomorphisms .",
    "all operators acting on the solutions ( [ dirsol ] ) are observables since they act on gauge invariant states .",
    "the whole variety of states includes many subspaces , which we can use to construct representations of observables .",
    "an example of such subspace is spanned by : @xmath75=\\int\\alpha_{\\mu}(\\overrightarrow{y})d{y}^{\\mu}.\\ ] ] we may introduce quantum observables @xmath76 such that : @xmath77=\\widehat{o}_{[s , t]}.\\ ] ]    but what are the fields @xmath78 ?",
    "it seems that one needs to postulate ( find ? ) a relation between @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "such a relation was proposed in @xcite .",
    "study of this relation would enable to interpret the observables in ( [ obs ] ) in physical terms and thus complete the proposed quantization scheme for membrane .",
    "it seems that the compactified milne space , @xmath0 , is suitable for modelling higher dimensional cosmological singularity .",
    "we showed that classical propagation of excited string is well - defined and unambiguous .",
    "the natural expectation would be : quantization should not spoil it !    we have proposed a quantization procedure for uniformly winding membrane , within which we made some progress , particularly we found non - trivial quantum states",
    ". it would be interesting to find some relation of our quantization of membrane with m - theory ( in our procedure there is no critical dimensionality )",
    ". however , our work is a first step toward the full resolution of the cosmological singularity that would require quantization of both spacetime and physical @xmath10-branes ."
