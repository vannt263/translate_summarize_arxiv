    "after the discovery of @xmath3125 gev particle  @xcite looking very much like the one higgs boson of the standard model ( sm ) , searching for the dark matter ( dm ) is one of the main targets for the next run of the lhc . at the same time , the scotogenic models of radiative neutrino mass relate the experimental evidence of neutrino masses and the existence of the dm in the universe  @xcite .",
    "the scotogenic one - loop model proposed by ma  @xcite augments the sm particle content by three singlet majorana fermions and a second scalar doublet , and remains the simplest scotogenic realization .",
    "it imposes an exactly conserved @xmath1 symmetry to both eliminate the unwanted yukawa interactions responsible for the tree - level neutrino masses and to simultaneously stabilize the dm candidates .",
    "here we take under scrutiny the notions of ( i ) _ loop - generated _ neutrino masses and ( ii ) @xmath1 _ symmetry _ , which have since then become a common theme among many studies .    a three - loop neutrino masses under consideration bear an unquestionable appeal of naturally explaining the twelve orders of magnitude hierarchy between neutrino masses and the electroweak scale .",
    "the other theme we address here is how to avoid a common use of an _ ad hoc _ @xmath1 symmetry . in a recent proposal  @xcite to promote @xmath1 to a local gauge @xmath4 symmetry in a model with two dark scalar doublets transforming as @xmath5 under @xmath4 , a breaking of gauge symmetry provides the dynamical origin of an exact @xmath1 symmetry .",
    "alternatively , the dm protecting @xmath1 symmetry may arise `` accidentally '' , on account of the sm symmetry and a choice of the field content symmetry is needed to stabilize a dm candidate .",

    "is enabled by employing higher weak multiplets , studied within the minimal dark matter ( mdm ) model  @xcite . there , an isolated fermion quintuplet @xmath6 or an isolated scalar septuplet @xmath7 have been selected to provide a viable dm candidate .",
    "recent minimalistic variant of mdm model , with wino - like fermion triplet  @xcite , relies on the enforcement of accidental b - l symmetry for dm stability .    in the present study",
    "we reconsider original mdm multiplets in such a way that both fermion quintuplet and scalar septuplet have to be employed to produce the neutrino masses at three - loop level . in the original model of radiative neutrino masses with mdm ( r@xmath0mdm  @xcite ) aiming at an automatic @xmath1 symmetry by employing the higher multiplets , the zero hypercharge quintuplet @xmath6 has been accompanied by a hypercharge - one sextuplet @xmath8 to close a one - loop neutrino mass diagram .",
    "however , as observed in  @xcite , there is an additional renormalizable quartic term in this model which violates the @xmath1 symmetry and threatens the stability of the proposed dm candidate .    in the present account",
    "we attempt to restore the r@xmath0mdm idea in a three - loop variant which employs both the fermion quintuplet @xmath6 and the scalar septuplet @xmath7 .",
    "this is in contrast to an early three - loop model proposed by krauss , nasri and trodden ( knt )  @xcite followed by similar recent attempts to explain small neutrino masses by adding to the sm content only additional weak singlets  @xcite , or by substituting a real scalar triplet for a charged scalar singlet in the knt model  @xcite .",
    "the knt model has been partly self - criticized  @xcite because of employing unobservable singlet dm .",

    "the magnitude of @xmath86 which is of order @xmath94 ev in the wide range of the parameter space reproduces the neutrino masses with the coefficient @xmath95 that is easily achieved without fine tuning .",
    "there are two major phenomenological issues generally related to the models for radiative neutrino masses : ( i ) an enlarged higgs sector with charged scalar bosons ; ( ii ) the tev - scale right - handed neutrinos with majorana masses , as possible dm candidates . in order to account for all of the observed dm abundance , the mass @xmath96 of mdm majorana quintuplet  @xcite approaches 10 tev range .",
    "accordingly , the majorana quintuplet may be studied at the lhc only by relaxing this condition like in presence of non - thermal production mechanisms , in non - standard cosmological scenarios or if it accounts only for a fraction of the dm abundance .",
    "the present study of a majorana quintuplet on colliders can be compared with a previous one  @xcite of the majorana triplet employed in type - iii seesaw .",
    "let us note that the quintuplet in presence of a half integer scalar quartet  @xcite @xmath97 leads to neutrino masses both at tree level and one - loop level .",

    "quintuplet lepton pairs in proton - proton collisions are mostly produced via drell - yan process , mediated by neutral and charged gauge bosons .",
    "detailed expressions for cross - sections are given in  @xcite .",
    "in particular , for @xmath102 and @xmath103 of integrated luminosity at @xmath104 tev , the lhc should produce about @xmath105 doubly - charged @xmath106 or @xmath100 fermions , and @xmath107 @xmath108 pairs in total . in fig .",
    "[ fig : lhcproduction ] we plot the expected number of produced @xmath106 and @xmath100 particles for three characteristic collider setups in dependence on the heavy lepton mass @xmath109 .",
    "there would be roughly the same number of singly - charged @xmath76 fermions produced , and half as many neutral ones .",
    "the mass differences within the multiplet are of the order of few hundred mev , so charged @xmath76 leptons decay to neutral dm candidate by cascade radiation of soft undetected pions , e.g. @xmath110 .",
    "detailed study of collider signature of wino - like dm triplet in @xcite identified disappearing tracks and monojets as most promising search channels .",
    "it turns out that regarding monojets our model is similar enough that we can , within some reasonable assumptions , directly use properly transformed results of @xcite . in particular , we have monojets generated by same diagrams as in the triplet model , and , additionally , diagrams with doubly - charged leptons . taking into account these additional contributions and different electroweak charges , in our model five times as many dm particles are produced as in the triplet model ; either directly or via cascade decays mentioned above .    since this enhancement factor turns out to be the same for various production mechanisms any kinematic cuts will cut away the same fraction of signal in both models , while the corresponding charged current partonic production processes are enhanced by electroweak su(2 ) ladder operators matrix elements @xmath111 , giving @xmath112 again . ] , and sm background should also be about the same .",

    "resulting significance is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : monojet ] .",
    "one notices that whereas the triplet model can only be _ excluded _ with 95% c.l . for @xmath117 gev ,",
    "the high - luminosity lhc can make a 5@xmath115 _ discovery _ of quintuplet model dm for @xmath118 gev , with systematic uncertainty of the background of 1% ( 5% ) , respectively .",

    "introduced in 2hdm for flavour physics reasons , implies also accidental @xmath1 symmetry , thus protecting the stability of @xmath120 as a dm candidate .",
    "however , it is known that soft breaking of @xmath43 in 2hdm may have some interesting features , like introducing a new source of cp violation and preserving stability and unitarity of the scalar potential . in the 2hd sector",
    "there is a potential soft @xmath121 term  ( [ 2hdpot ] ) , whereas the @xmath1-breaking soft term  ( [ newdim3 ] ) in the sector of exotic scalar fields would destabilize the majorana quintuplet @xmath9 via loop - induced effects .",
    "let us for completeness estimate the value of the small , thooft - natural coefficient carried by the term  ( [ newdim3 ] ) , so that the loop - induced decays of @xmath9 state may be long enough in comparison to the lifetime of the universe .",
    "for example , the loop diagram in fig .",
    "[ s0decay ] leads to the decay amplitude for @xmath122 .",
    "it can be compared to the decay amplitude for @xmath123 in fig . 1 in  @xcite , induced by dim-4 operator which destabilized dm candidate in one - loop r@xmath0mdm model  @xcite . in the present case",
    "the width for decay into the four particle final state @xmath124 is given by @xmath125     at the loop level in the case of broken @xmath1 symmetry . ]    by assuming @xmath126 and by adopting the values @xmath127 and @xmath128 , as used in @xcite , the lifetime of our dm candidate exceeds the age of the universe @xmath129 if the soft term coupling @xmath130 does not exceed the value of neutrino masses , @xmath131 ev .",
    "a stronger bound @xmath132 ev can be obtained in the context of the decaying dm @xcite .",
    "notably , switching off the soft @xmath130 term does not affect the neutrino mass diagram but makes the @xmath9 state a viable dm candidate .",
    "so , in order to confirm the relation of the quintuplet particles to neutrinos one has to study their decays .",
    "let us stress that there are ample decays to purely sm final state particles in case that the quintuplets are not constrained by @xmath1 symmetry , like in scenarios where they are accompanied by even - plet scalars  @xcite .",
    "therefore a recent scrutiny  @xcite is welcome as a way to possibly exclude such modes and scenarios , what would be in favor of the present three - loop model in which fermion quintuplets are accompanied by odd - plet scalars",
    ". then only less visible cascade decays of charged @xmath76 states remain , and the search is focused on monojets or disappearing tracks like in case of wino - like particles  @xcite . in such scenario",
    "the @xmath9 is the dm candidate .",
    "the 2hd scalar sector has been studied in detail ( for a review see  @xcite and  @xcite ) , independently of possible further extensions of the scalar sector .",
    "a study in the context of additional singlet scalars of aks model faces challenging separation of signals addressed in  @xcite .",
    "the case of the larger multiplets of the present account is characterized by the fact that the 2hd and the exotic scalar sectors are decoupled due to the sm gauge symmetry , and thus can be treated separately .      since in this work the scalar quintuplet and septuplet states",
    "are assumed to be heavier than majorana quintuplet accounting for all dm abundance , we do not expect that they are accessible at the lhc .",
    "in particular , the collider signatures of these exotic scalars are out of scope of the present paper .",
    "still , their multiple - charged components are studied in number of papers for different reason .    as already pointed out , the sectors of small and large scalar multiplets are to large extent decoupled and can be treated separately . here",
    "we are explicating the @xmath1 symmetry breaking terms connecting small and large scalar multiplets , which are allowed by the exact @xmath43 symmetry .",
    "a doublet - quintuplet mixing is represented by a dim 5 operator , @xmath133 however , in order to enable similar doublet - septuplet mixing , we must go to a suppressed dim 7 operator @xmath134 since the natural mass scale of these fields is in a multi - tev range , a study of 2hd states may be more promising .",
    "the charged higgs boson phenomenology for lepton - specific 2hdm at lep was presented in  @xcite , and for direct searches at lhc and ilc in  @xcite .",
    "the standard procedure  @xcite is to adjust the scenario for the neutral @xmath27 state to be the sm - like higgs boson with mass 125 gev .",
    "in the first case corresponding to the _ decoupling regime _",
    "where @xmath135 , the @xmath20 mass @xmath136 may be related to large soft breaking scale of the discrete symmetry @xmath43 . in another case where the @xmath20 mass is at the scale @xmath137 , these charged states may be probed through the higgs diphoton decay .",
    "let us note that there is another three - loop model  @xcite which has a lepton - specific 2hdm as a part of the scalar sector extension .",
    "therefore the higgs phenomenology presented there applies to the charged states @xmath20 .",
    "on the other hand for a charged higgs heavier than top , the babar data based on @xmath138 exclude a charged higgs lighter than 380 gev , independently of @xmath50 ( see ref .",

    "@xcite the charged higgs decay channels have been identified , which are promising for non - supersymmetric 2hd models .",

    "we follow the idea of the r@xmath0mdm proposed at one - loop level in  @xcite and look at alternative particle content that may actually realize it at three - loop level .",
    "we adopt a three - loop topology proposed by aks  @xcite in a way that their imposed @xmath1 symmetry appears accidentally due to higher representations added to the sm particle content .",
