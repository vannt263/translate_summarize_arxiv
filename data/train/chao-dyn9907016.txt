    "the classical dynamics of a hydrogen atom in a uniform magnetic field @xmath1 along the @xmath2-axis is described by the hamiltonian : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the @xmath2 component of the angular momentum , and @xmath5 the cyclotron frequency . in cylindrical coordinates ( @xmath6,@xmath2,@xmath7 ) and atomic units , at the angular momentum @xmath8 , the hamiltonian can be rewritten as @xmath9 which is an even function of the coordinates and momenta .",
    "its symmetry group consists of the identity @xmath10 and the reflection @xmath11 . introducing the semi - parabolic coordinates",
    "@xmath12 we may convert the hamiltonian to @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the scaled energy and @xmath15 is the fixed `` pseudo energy '' . in fig .  1 , we show an orbit at @xmath16 .",
    "irregular orbits at @xmath16 displayed in the configuration space(@xmath2 , @xmath6)@xcite or in the poincar section ( @xmath17 , @xmath18)@xcite show the chaotic behavior of the dynamics .",
    "the transformed hamiltonian @xmath15 has a higher symmetry than @xmath19 .",
    "its symmetry group consists of the identity @xmath10 , two reflections @xmath20 , @xmath21 across the @xmath22 , @xmath17 axes , two diagonal reflections @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and three rotations @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 by @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 around the center , respectively@xcite .",
    "our poincar section is chosen as follows .",
    "imagine that the @xmath22 and @xmath17 axes are both of a finite width and length .",
    "a counterclockwise contour is taken along the perimeter of the area forming by the two crossing imaginary rectangles .",
    "the poincar section is then obtained by recording the position and the tangent component of the momentum along the contour , i.e. , the birkhoff canonical coordinates @xcite at intersecting points with the contour where an orbit enter the inside of the contour .",
    "the length of the contour is infinite .",
    "it is more convenient to transform the contour to one with a finite length .",
    "for example , in the first quadrant , the transformations @xmath31 along the positive @xmath22 axis and @xmath32 along the positive @xmath17 axis convert the segment of the original contour in the first quadrant into an interval of length 2 parametrized with @xmath33 . for our purpose here , the variable corresponding to the momentum may be take as @xmath34 at the positive @xmath22 axis , and @xmath35 at the positive @xmath17 axis , where @xmath36 . in this way we may parametrize the whole contour with @xmath37 , and define corresponding @xmath38 .",
    "the rotational symmetry under @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 in the original configurational space becomes the translational symmetry of shifting @xmath39 by a multiple of 2 in the @xmath39-@xmath38 plane .",
    "the dynamics on the poincar surface is then represented by a map on the annulus @xmath37 and @xmath40 $ ] .",
    "for the map on an annulus describing the dynamics on the poincar section , it is useful to consider its lift . in the lifted space on which the lift map is defined the area @xmath37 and @xmath40 $ ] consists of a fundamental domain ( fd ) , which is uniformly divided into 8 strips according to @xmath39 . the image of the fd in the lifted space is partly shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fd](a ) , where the 8 strips of the fd are marked with the numbers 0 to 7 , and four strips right of the fd marked with @xmath41 to @xmath42 . in the figure we draw only the images of the strips 1 and 2 .",
    "two zones marked with @xmath43 and @xmath44 of the strip 1 are mapped to the zone 1 of strip @xmath42 and the zone @xmath44 of strip @xmath45 , respectively .",
    "the notation representing the image of strip 2 is analogous .",
    "the rotational symmetry of the hamiltonian corresponds to the translational symmetry in the lifted space .",
    "for example , the image of strip 0 is in the strips 6 and 7 , and can be obtained from the image of strip 2 ( in the strips @xmath41 and @xmath46 ) by shifting to the left by 2 strips .",
    "similarly , we show part of the preimage of the fd in fig .",
    "[ fig : fd](b ) . since on the annulus forward and",
    "backward maps rotate in opposite directions , strips are on the right of their preimages , in contrast with images .    for the full fd , the rotation number of orbits is between 0 and 2 . taking the rotational symmetry into account , we may consider only the reduced domain ( rd ) consisting of strips 1 and 2 .",
    "when the rd is regarded as the annulus , from fig .  1 the integral part of the rotation numbers is 3 and 4 for zone 2 , which is the joint zone of @xmath44 and @xmath47 , but 4 and 5 for zone 1 . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rd](a ) , the rd may be correspondingly divided into three regions according to the rotation number .",
    "the two lines of demarcation are marked by @xmath48 and @xmath49 . in the figure",
    "we have also drawn some stable and unstable manifolds .",
    "( the stable manifolds have a segment roughly parallel to lines @xmath48 and @xmath50 , and the unstable manifolds are a mirror image of the stable manifolds with respect to the line @xmath51 . ) in the rd , tangencies between stable and unstable manifolds can be easily seen . among them , the prominent ones are in the top - left and bottom - right regions of the three . at a given point the stable and unstable directions , i.e. tangent directions of manifolds , can be determined with the procedure suggested by greene @xcite , and then tangent points found .",
    "two lines connecting such tangent points , which are marked by @xmath52 and @xmath53 , give a further partition of the rd .",
    "the final partition of the rd into five regions is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rd](a ) , where these regions are marked by @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 . in the figure the two boundaries of the rd are marked by @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "this partition is the partition according to the preimage .",
    "its preimage gives the partition according to the present , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rd](b ) , where the five regions are marked with @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , and @xmath65 . by means of this partition , or equivalently the partition of fig .",
    "[ fig : rd](a ) according to the preimage , we may code an orbit with a doubly infinite sequence @xmath66 where @xmath67 indicates the present .",
    "we may refer to this coding as the axis coding , and the coding based on bounces in the literature the bounce coding .",
    "the ordering is essential to establishing symbolic dynamics .",
    "the natural order is well defined in the lifted space .",
    "the 5-piece preimage of the rd arranged from left to right in the lifted space consist of @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 , as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : fd](b ) . thus , according to the natural order we have @xmath68 from the preimage of the rd shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fd](b ) we see an opposite arrangement of the preimage pieces in the lifted space . a more precise description of ordering is given by the ordering of unstable manifolds on a transversal stable foliation .",
    "it is numerically verified that under the backward map the ordering is reversed in the regions @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 , but preserved in @xmath54 and @xmath58 .",
    "we may define the parity of a finite string by the oddness of the total number of the letters @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 contained in the string .",
    "any odd leading string in backward sequences will then reverse the ordering ( [ bord ] ) of backward sequences .",
    "similarly , from the partition shown in fig .  [ fig : rd](b ) according to the present , we have the ordering @xmath72 an odd leading string also reverses this ordering for forward sequences .    based on the ordering rules , metric representations for both forward and",
    "backward sequences may be introduced to construct the symbolic plane@xcite .",
    "every forward sequence @xmath73 may correspond to a number @xmath74 , represented in base 5 , between 0 and 1 as follows .",
    "we define the correspondence of symbol @xmath75 to number @xmath76 as @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 and @xmath81 if the leading string @xmath82 is even , and as @xmath83 otherwise .",
    "finally , we define @xmath84 in this way forward sequences are ordered according to their @xmath74-values . similarly , we assign to a backward sequence @xmath85 the number @xmath86 defined by @xmath87 where @xmath88 is determined by @xmath89 and the oddness of the leading string @xmath90 . in the symbolic plane every orbit point corresponds to a point ( @xmath74 , @xmath86 ) in the unit square , where @xmath74 and @xmath86 are associated with the forward and backward sequences of the orbit point , respectively .",
    "we show the symbolic plane for @xmath16 in fig .",
    "[ fig : rdsp](a ) , where approximately 68000 points of several real orbits in the rd are drawn . the corresponding pruning front for the partition lines @xmath91 , @xmath92 and the boundary lines @xmath93 and @xmath94",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rdsp](b ) .",
    "so far we have not considered the reflectional symmetry . in the lifted space",
    "this symmetry corresponds to the invariance of the rd under a @xmath29-rotation around the center ( or the reflection with respect to the center ) . from fig .",
    "[ fig : fd](a ) it is seen that the image of zone 1 of strip 1 is in strip @xmath42 , hence still in 1 after wrapping . on the contrary ,",
    "the image @xmath44 of strip 1 is in strip 2 .",
    "however , a @xmath29-rotation can put the image back into strip 1 .",
    "so , using the reflectional symmetry , we may focus only on strip 1 , which may be regarded as the minimal domain ( md ) . in this way",
    "the 5-letter symbolic dynamics is reduced to a 3-letter one , and the @xmath29-rotation changes the parity of @xmath70 .",
    "more specifically speaking , we have the following ordering for the minimal domain @xmath95 and only @xmath69 in a leading string reverses the ordering .",
    "the symbolic plane of the md is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : mdsp ] where 34,000 points of several real orbits are drawn together with the pruning fronts .",
    "the primary pruning front of @xmath93 is roughly diagonal , while that of @xmath91 is almost vertical .",
    "the latter encloses a forbidden zone near the top in the symbolic plane , which is responsible for many interesting bifurcations . in the 5-letter code for the rd , the second and fourth quadrants of the symbolic plane are forbidden . the symbolic plane for the 3-letter code of the md looks more compact .",
    "let us discuss the pruning front in some detail .",
    "a point @xmath96 on the partition line @xmath93 discards a rectangle in the symbolic plane as a forbidden zone , the top - right corner of which is the point @xmath96 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rd - orb ] .",
    "when representing the point in the symbolic plane , we have replaced @xmath97 by its right limit , i.e. , a point with @xmath98 .",
    "its allowed zone is the rectangle , the lower - left corner of which is the same point .",
    "similarly , a point @xmath99 discards a rectangle as its forbidden zone whose two lower corners are @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "the point also determines two allowed zones .",
    "the above mentioned two corners form the upper - right corner of the left allowed zone and the upper - left corner of the right one .",
    "we have numerically found the following 5 points on the partition lines : @xmath102 where the last two points are on @xmath93 .",
    "the first tree points correspond to lower corners of the top three rectangles with dotted sides in fig .",
    "[ fig : rd - orb ] , while the other two to the upper - right corners of the two bottom rectangles .",
    "it can be verified that the point @xmath103 is in the forbidden zone of @xmath104 , so the periodic sequence @xmath105 is nonadmissible .",
    "one can verify the admissibility of the sequence @xmath106 .",
    "in fact , its @xmath107 , @xmath43 , @xmath108 , @xmath109 , @xmath110 , @xmath111 , @xmath112 shifts are in the allowed zone of @xmath113 , while its @xmath114 , @xmath115 shifts in that of @xmath116 .",
    "at the same time , its @xmath107 , @xmath43 , @xmath114 , @xmath110 , @xmath117 , @xmath115 shifts are in the allowed zone of @xmath118 , while its @xmath108 , @xmath109 @xmath111 , @xmath112 shifts in that of @xmath116 . in this way",
    "we may examine the admissibility of periodic sequences from the known coding of partition lines .",
    "the above orbit @xmath106 , written in the 5-letter code , is @xmath119 .",
    "symmetry of sequences by means of the 5-letter code will be discussed in sec .",
    "in the literature the symbolic description based on bounces is used .",
    "bounces are well defined for billiards .",
    "we may explore the relation between the axis codes and the bounce codes by examining a billiard . for simplicity ,",
    "let us consider the touching four - disk billiard . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:4d](a ) , the boundary of the billiard is formed by the four disks which are labeled with a , b , c , and d , respectively . taking the boundary as a poincar section",
    ", we have the corresponding birkhoff coordinates similar to those of the stadium billiard , which we denote by @xmath120 to distinguish from the above @xmath121 , and hence the associated map on the annulus @xcite .",
    "we normalize the boundary length as unity , and measure the length from the touching point of disks a and d. as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:4d](b ) , the fundamental domain of the annulus consists of four strips corresponding to the four disks . the image of the strip of disk a , which has three pieces in three other strips , determines the partition of the reduced domain consisting of a single strip .",
    "the three regions of the rd are labeled with @xmath122 , @xmath123 , and @xmath124 in the figure . by the argument based on lifting",
    ", we have the ordering @xmath125 since every bounce on a disk reverses the ordering of orbits , each symbol has an odd parity .",
    "that is , for forward symbolic sequences , a string of an odd length is odd , while that of an even length is even .",
    "we have similar ordering rules for backward symbolic sequences .",
    "this is our version of the symbolic dynamics described in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "when the strip of @xmath126 is divided at @xmath127 , and an eighth of the fd is considered , the image of the line @xmath127 has three pieces respectively in strips b , c and d. the partition of a half strip , which is determined by putting all the pieces of its image together back into the half strip , will involve symbols more than three .    to explore the correspondence between the axis codes and the bounce codes ,",
    "we examine how an orbit starting from a point on an axis hits different disks .",
    "this gives the relation between the phase spaces @xmath128 associated with the axis contour and @xmath129 associated with the billiard boundary .",
    "consider the orbit ac grazing against disk d in fig .",
    "[ fig : cor](a ) .",
    "it corresponds to a point of @xmath130 , or equivalently a point of @xmath131 when the rd is considered .",
    "starting from point a on the @xmath132-axis , orbits right of this grazing orbit hit disk d before intersecting an axis again , while orbits on its left hit the @xmath133-axis directly before having a bounce on disk c. the orbit abo , which passes through the origin , separates orbits crossing the @xmath133-axis from those crossing the @xmath132-axis .",
    "the orbits of the type ac correspond to line @xmath92 in the rd of the @xmath39-@xmath38 phase space since the line demarcates the order preserving region without a bounce from the order reversing region with a bounce .",
    "similarly , the orbits of type abo correspond to line @xmath134 .",
    "thus , bisecting the region @xmath63 into @xmath135 and @xmath136 with line @xmath137 , we may re - label the right half of the rd as in fig .",
    "[ fig : cor](b ) . comparing this figure with fig .",
    "3(b ) , we see that @xmath135 and @xmath64 belong to @xmath122 , which associates with orbits leaving from disk a and bouncing on disk d. the region @xmath65 has no direct correspondence with any bounce .",
    "orbits from the region , after missing a bounce , will hit disk c before intersecting again an axis .",
    "we may re - label the region as @xmath138 .",
    "consequently , we have the correspondence : @xmath139 where @xmath140 stands for any symbol .",
    "the other half of the rd in @xmath39-@xmath38 space may be analyzed in a similar way .",
    "the re - labeling of regions is also shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cor](b ) , which indicates the correspondence : @xmath141    putting fig .",
    "[ fig : rd](a ) on the top of 3(b ) , we see that the allowed symbolic pair are @xmath142 two rules can then be extracted :    1 .   @xmath143 and @xmath144 are always followed by a symbol of odd parity .",
    "2 .   @xmath145 follows either @xmath143 , or @xmath71 , or @xmath146 , while @xmath146 follows either @xmath144 , or @xmath69 , or @xmath145 .",
    "the first rule explains that @xmath147 or @xmath148 has the same parity as the bounce code @xmath43 .",
    "the second rule can be used to refine @xmath70 into @xmath145 and @xmath146 , and then further to convert them into bounce codes .",
    "for example , an orbit shown in fig .",
    "9(a ) has the axis codes @xmath149 .",
    "the codes are first refined as @xmath150 , and then converted to @xmath151 .",
    "another orbit shown in fig .",
    "9(b ) has the codes @xmath152 .",
    "this sequence is converted as follows : @xmath153    the ordering ( [ ford ] ) can be refined as @xmath154 which , under a cyclic transformation , becomes @xmath155 this ordering is then converted to @xmath156 which is just the ordering of the bounce codes .",
    "a detailed analysis of the relation between axis codes and bounce codes will be presented elsewhere .",
    "the configurational space of the original dynamics is the half @xmath6-@xmath2 plane , which converts to the first quadrant of the @xmath22-@xmath17 plane .",
    "the rotational symmetry in the @xmath22-@xmath17 plane is the invariance under the transformation from @xmath157 to @xmath158 , @xmath159 and @xmath160 ( denoted by @xmath6 , @xmath29 and @xmath161 ) .",
    "this symmetry has nothing to do with the original dynamics . confining the dynamics to the rd",
    ", we remove the symmetry .    as for the reflectional symmetry",
    ", we may focus only on @xmath162 since we can composite @xmath163 , @xmath164 and @xmath165 .",
    "we shall denote @xmath166 simply by @xmath167 .",

    "thus , if an orbit is symmetric under reflection , its symbolic sequence is invariant up to a shift under the symbolic transformation of @xmath167 .",
    "for example , sequence @xmath172 of period 6 is symmetric under @xmath167 , while @xmath173 is not .",
    "this two orbits are shown in fig .",
    "the hamiltonian dynamics has the time - reversal symmetry : @xmath174 .",
    "this transformation , denoted by @xmath175 , leads to @xmath176 in the @xmath39-@xmath38 space . written in symbols ,",
    "this means @xmath177 , @xmath178 , @xmath179 , @xmath180 and @xmath181 .",
    "thus , the effect of @xmath175 on a sequence is to reverse the sequence and apply @xmath167 to it .",
    "for example , transformation @xmath175 converts sequence @xmath182 to @xmath183 .",
    "we may combine @xmath175 and @xmath167 to define the transformation @xmath184 of reversal by @xmath185 . in the 3-letter symbolic dynamics",
    "we identify @xmath143 with @xmath144 , and @xmath71 with @xmath69 , so @xmath175 just reverses a sequence .",

    "let us analyze their symmetry in some detail .",
    "right at the origin the momentum @xmath38 is ill - defined .",
    "however , for an orbit passing through the origin we may consider its left and right limits since both of them are well - defined .",
    "it can be seen that around the origin we have codes @xmath187 and @xmath188 for the two limits , where @xmath1 stands for @xmath189 or @xmath190 . in the rd @xmath97",

    "( a further observation discovers that the codes @xmath201 can be equally well written as @xmath202 since the third point is on the common segment of @xmath203 and @xmath204 , where @xmath205 , similar to @xmath1 , stands for @xmath97 or @xmath191 . )",
    "many short closed orbits have been found in ref .",
    "non - repeating strings or their doubled strings of the periodic sequences corresponding to these orbits are listed in table ii , where sequences and initial values @xmath38 are for the right limit orbits starting at @xmath206 .",
