    "the structure of light nuclei has always provided a certain fascination , given that a full range of structural properties are displayed from spherical shell model like structure via deformation to clustering . in particular",
    "even - even nuclei , composed of equal numbers of protons and neutrons offer the possibility that the nucleus may be decomposed into a collection of @xmath5-particles .",
    "this was the picture developed by ikeda @xcite , who speculated that at the point that the @xmath7 decay threshold was encountered the associated cluster degree of freedom should be liberated .",
    "correspondingly , this picture would suggest that the @xmath8be ground state should possess an @xmath5-@xmath5 cluster structure , and the 3@xmath5 cluster structure should appear at an excitation energy close to 7.3 mev in @xmath9c .",
    "indeed , it has been recently speculated that certain states above the 3@xmath5 decay threshold in @xmath9c ( e.g. the 7.65 mev state ) , or the 4@xmath5 decay threshold in @xmath10o , should possess properties reminiscent of a bose gas @xcite .",
    "these highly developed cluster systems have been shown to have an important impact on the structure of neutron - rich isotopes of beryllium and carbon .",
    "for example , in the case of @xmath11be the properties of the valence neutron may be explained in terms of the sharing of the neutron between the two @xmath5-cores in a manner which is reminiscent of the covalent binding of atomic molecules @xcite . for valence neutrons based on @xmath5-particle cores , linear combinations of the @xmath12-type orbits",
    "lead to analogues of the atomic @xmath13 and @xmath14-bonds .",
    "indeed , such a description provides a useful basis for the understanding of the low lying spectroscopy of the @xmath1be nucleus , with the ground state structure forming a rotational band with @xmath14-like character .",
    "the presence of 3@xmath5 cluster structures in @xmath9c provides an extension to the ideas developed for the two - centre systems .",
    "calculations which explicitly contain the molecular - orbital structure @xcite show that unlike the linear 3@xmath5 system , which is unstable against bending modes and thus collapse into more compact structures , the 3@xmath15 systems are stable against the bending mode @xcite .",
    "thus , there would appear to be an opportunity for observing linear chain configurations , partially stabilized by the valence neutrons in covalent type orbits .",
    "a recent analysis of available data by milin and von oertzen has provided tentative evidence for the existence of such a structure in @xmath6c @xcite . via a careful examination of previous experimental spin and parity assignments ,",
    "two rotational bands were proposed ( @xmath16 ) whose deformations indicated a chain - like structure and which were split in energy due to the intrinsic asymmetry of the 3@xmath17 structure . this analysis provided information on such rotational structures up to @xmath1817 mev .",
    "although , such a picture is appealing the relationship between the states considered by milin and von oertzen has not been demonstrated since the spins and parities remain to be confirmed .    in the present paper",
    "we present a measurement of the @xmath19li(@xmath11be,@xmath6c@xmath20be+@xmath5)@xmath3h reaction .",
    "the @xmath5-transfer process provides a possible mechanism by which the chain - like structures in @xmath6c may be populated .",
    "the measurement covers the excitation energy range of 12 to 28 mev , the interval over which the higher energy and spin members of the two rotational bands are believed to exist .",
    "the measurements were performed at the australian national university s 14ud tandem accelerator facility . a 70 mev @xmath11be beam , of intensity 3 ena , was incident on a 100 @xmath21g@xmath22 li@xmath23o@xmath24 foil .",
    "the integrated beam exposure was 0.45 mc .",
    "reaction products formed in reactions of the @xmath11be beam with the target were detected in an array of four charged particle telescopes .",
    "these telescopes contained three elements which allowed the detection of a wide range of particle types , from protons to @xmath25=4 to 5 nuclei .",
    "the first elements were thin , 70@xmath21",
    "m , 5@xmath265 @xmath27 silicon detectors segmented into four smaller squares ( quadrants ) .",
    "the second elements were position - sensitive strip detectors with the same active area as the quadrant detectors , but divided into 16 position - sensitive strips .",
    "these strips were arranged so that the position axis gave maximum resolution in the measurement of scattering angles . finally , 2.5 cm thick csi detectors were used to stop highly penetrating light particles . these detector telescopes provided charge and mass resolution up to be , allowing the final states of interest to be unambiguously identified . the position and energy resolution of the telescopes was @xmath281 mm and 300 kev , respectively .",
    "calibration of the detectors was performed using elastic scattering measurements of @xmath1be from @xmath29au and @xmath9c targets .",
    "the four telescopes were arranged in a cross - like arrangement , separated by azimuthal angles of 90@xmath30 .",
    "two opposing detectors were located with their centres at 17.3@xmath30 and 17.8@xmath30 ( detectors 1 and 2 ) from the beam axis and with the strip detector 130 mm from the target , whilst the remaining pair were at the slightly larger angles of 28.6@xmath30 and 29.7@xmath30 ( detectors 3 and 4 ) , 136 mm from the target .",
    "the detection system employed in the present measurements allowed a measurement of the charge , mass , energy and emission angle ( and hence a determination of the momentum ) of each particle .",
    "this provides a complete determination of the reaction kinematics in the case of a three particle final state .",
    "figure [ etot ] shows the total energy spectrum of the three final state particles assuming a @xmath31h recoil ( @xmath32 ) , after gating on @xmath11be+@xmath5 in the particle identification spectra .",
    "the large peak in this spectrum corresponds to the observation of the @xmath19li(@xmath1be,@xmath11be@xmath5)@xmath3h reaction ( q=-2.468 mev ) , where all particles are produced in their ground states ( @xmath11be only possesses one state bound against particle decay ) .",
    "the energy resolution in the total energy spectrum is @xmath281.9 mev , considerably worse than the intrinsic energy resolution of the detectors ( 300 kev ) .",
    "this is due to in fact the uncertainty imposed by the measured momenta of the two detected particles limits the resolution of the reconstructed momentum of the undetected triton .",
    "given the relatively small mass of the recoil particle the uncertainty in momentum is magnified in energy .",
    "the first peak at lower total energy corresponds to reactions involving the oxygen and carbon components in the target : @xmath10o(@xmath11be,@xmath1be@xmath5)@xmath9c ( q=-7.162 mev ) and @xmath9c(@xmath11be,@xmath1be@xmath5)@xmath33be ( q=-7.367 mev ) , predominantly the former , with the lowest energy peak coinciding with the 4.4 mev excitation of the @xmath9c recoil .",
    "unfortunately , the underlying background means that these channels can not be analyzed .     total energy spectrum for @xmath34he+@xmath1be coincidences detected in telescopes 1 and 2 , assuming a @xmath31h recoil .",
    "the highest energy peak corresponds to the observation of the @xmath0li(@xmath11be,@xmath11be@xmath5)@xmath31h reaction .",
    "statistical uncertainties are presented only.,scaledwidth=75.0% ]    by selecting only the events associated with the @xmath19li(@xmath1be,@xmath11be@xmath5)@xmath3h reaction the @xmath6c excitation energy can be calculated from the relative velocity of the two decay fragments .",
    "figures [ exc]a ( top ) and [ exc]b ( bottom ) show such spectra for the small angle detector pair ( 1 and 2 ) and the larger angle pair ( 3 and 4 ) respectively .",
    "as expected these spectra sample slightly different excitation energy ranges due to the minimum opening angle required for the fragments to reach the detectors .",
    "given the presence of three particles in the final state the possibility remains that at least some of the yield in figures [ exc]a and [ exc]b arises from decays of either @xmath0li into t+@xmath5 or @xmath9b to t+@xmath1be .",
    "both of these decay processes were reconstructed and only evidence for decays of @xmath0li was found , where the states at 4.63 and 6.68 mev were observed in the coincidence spectra for detectors 3 and 4 .",
    "this contribution was removed from the spectrum in figure [ exc]b by eliminating all data corresponding to @xmath0li excitations less than 7 mev .",
    "@xmath6c excitation energy spectra for decays detected in detectors 1 and 2 ( a ) top , and 3 and 4 ( b ) bottom .",
    "observed peaks are labelled with excitation energies ( mev ) .",
    "the details of the peaks observed in these spectra are presented in table [ 13cexc ] .",
    "error bars represent statistical errors.,scaledwidth=75.0% ]    .[13cexc ] excitation energies of @xmath6c states @xmath5-decaying into the ground state of @xmath1be .",
    "the uncertainty in these energies is 100 kev .",
    "the previous measurements are from the tabulations of @xcite .",
    "note that the excitation energy resolution is 180 to 200 kev from an analysis of the 13.4 mev peak , and therefore widths are only quoted where the experimental resolution permits , and the experimental resolution has been unfolded .",
    "the states shown in italics are states observed at the same energies as those in the present measurements , but have different experimental widths . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the angular distributions in figure [ expad ] appear to show two features , the first is that the distributions for the five states at 14.1 , 14.6 , 16.8 , 18.7 and 21.3 mev all have a similar character , and secondly it is distinct from that of the distributions for the 13.4 and 23.9 mev states .",
    "this difference is in terms of the reduced oscillatory structure for the distributions of the latter two states , and that the distributions for these two states appear to possess a gradient which differs to that of the remaining states .",
    "this feature would suggest that the two sets of states possess different characters , either in terms of their parity or the angular momentum transfer . in the present case",
    "positive parity states would be populated by odd angular momentum @xmath35 values ( @xmath35 being the angular momentum of the orbit into which the @xmath5-particle is transferred ) , whilst negative parity states would be populated by even @xmath35 values .",
    "the spins which could be populated in the transfer of an @xmath5-particle with this angular momentum would be in the range @xmath36 .",
    "thus , for example , for the sequence of states 3/2@xmath37 , 5/2@xmath37 , 7/2@xmath37 , 9/2@xmath37 and 11/2@xmath37 the @xmath35 values would be ( 1,3 ) , ( 1,3 ) , ( 3,5 ) , ( 3,5 ) and ( 5,7 ) respectively .",
    "here @xmath38 , the initial angular momentum of the @xmath5-particle in @xmath0li , is equal to 1 . the transferred angular momentum @xmath39 is given by @xmath40 , and is even for positive parity states and odd for those with negative parity .",
    "the ( @xmath0li , t ) reaction has a long history in the population of @xmath5-cluster states in light nuclei , and the angular distributions for differing @xmath35-values have been collated ( in particular for @xmath35 = 0 and 2 ) by bethge @xcite , together with those for the ( @xmath41li , d ) @xmath5-transfer reaction .",
    "typically , the ( @xmath0li , t ) angular distributions are less oscillatory than those for the ( @xmath41li , d ) reaction , and are reminiscent of those that appear in figure [ expad ] .",
    "the reduced structure in the ( @xmath0li , t ) angular distributions is related to the presence of two transfer angular momentum values , @xmath39 , for each @xmath35 @xcite , for @xmath420 .",
    "nevertheless , the compilation of the @xmath5-transfer reaction in @xcite indicates the sensitivity to the orbital angular momentum of the orbit into which the @xmath5-particle is transferred .",
    "these data indicate that the second maximum for @xmath35=0 and @xmath35=2 transfers appear at centre - of - mass angles 20@xmath43 - 30@xmath43 and 40@xmath43 - 50@xmath43 , respectively . via the properties of bessel functions the corresponding locations of the maxima for",
    "@xmath35=1 and @xmath35=3 transfers would appear at 30@xmath43 - 40@xmath43 and 47@xmath43 - 57@xmath43 , respectively .",
    "for the five states with similar angular distributions the secondary maxima shift a little with increasing excitation energy ( as indicated by the dashed line in figure [ expad ] ) , but lie within the region 29@xmath30 to 41@xmath30 .",
    "we note that the secondary maxima appear to be less strong in the case of the 14.1 and 14.6 mev states",
    ". the observed small change of about 10 degrees of the maxima with excitation energy may reflect the changing amplitudes of the two contributing angular momentum transfer values .",
    "the data thus appear to indicate that the five states possess the same value of @xmath35 which may be either 1 or 2 . from the perspective of the excitation energy of the observed",
    "states the latter is most likely .",
    "however , we note that the angular distributions in @xcite were measured at centre - of - mass energies approximately a factor of 2 smaller than in the present case , which may result in some variations of the distributions in @xcite and those measured here",
    ".    these data would suggest that the five states at 14.1 , 14.6 , 16.8 , 18.7 and 21.3 mev all correspond to a similar angular momentum transfer and thus may be structurally linked , whereas the two states at 13.4 and 23.9 mev may possess an alternative character .",
    "this observation appears to be inconsistent with the assignments made by milin and von oertzen .",
    "we have attempted to reproduce the experimental angular distributions using the dwba formalism .",
    "however , the calculated distributions were found to be overly sensitive to the details of the interaction potentials , and moreover required an approximation to bound state wave - functions for the unbound resonant states . these features of the calculations",
    "have not permitted spin information to be accurately and unambiguously extracted from the present data .",
    "a measurement of the @xmath19li(@xmath11be,@xmath1be@xmath5)@xmath3h at @xmath4=70 mev has been performed using an array of charged particle detector telescopes .",
    "the measurement of the @xmath6c excitation energy spectrum corresponding to decays into @xmath5+@xmath11be produced evidence for excited states between 12 and 28 mev .",
    "evidence is found for three new broad resonances at 18.7 , 21.3 and 23.9 mev .",
    "given the nature of the reaction process , @xmath5 transfer onto the @xmath5+@xmath44+@xmath5 cluster nucleus @xmath11be , it is possible that some of the states observed in the present measurement may be linked with the 3@xmath5+@xmath44 chain structure suggested by milin and von oertzen @xcite .",
    "an analysis of the angular distributions suggests that the group of states at excitation energies 14.1 , 14.6 , 16.8 , 18.7 and 21.3 mev correspond to the @xmath5-transfer to a common orbital in @xmath6c .",
    "the measurements suggest that there may be inconsistencies in the assignments made in reference @xcite , in identifying the chain - structure .",
    "particularly the resonance at 14.6 mev observed in the present data is strongly populated , and thus would be expected to feature strongly in the rotational systematics .",
    "further , the measurements indicate that the states may not be ordered into the bands suggested by table [ matkovon ]",
    ".    clearly , spin determinations are imperative in order to fully understand the nature of the states above the @xmath11be+@xmath5 decay threshold . due to the large number of reaction amplitudes , resulting from the presence of non - zero spin particles ,",
    "the angular correlations measured here were featureless .",
    "it is possible that reactions such as @xmath9c(@xmath1be,@xmath6c)@xmath33be and @xmath10o(@xmath1be,@xmath6c)@xmath9c , possessing spin - zero nuclei in the initial and final state will provide a more promising avenue for resolving this issue .",
    "alternatively , an analysis of the @xmath41li(@xmath11be,@xmath6c)@xmath45h reaction should produce angular distributions which are more oscillatory than those observed in the present study .",
