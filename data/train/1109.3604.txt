    "permanent electric dipole moments ( edms ) @xcite of particles , nuclei , atoms , and molecules provide stringent bounds on sources of parity ( @xmath0 ) and time - reversal ( @xmath1 ) violation beyond the phase of the quark - mixing matrix @xcite in the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "experiments in preparation @xcite aim to improve the current bound on the neutron edm , @xmath8 cm @xcite , by up to two orders of magnitude . at the same time , proposals @xcite",
    "exist for the measurement of edms of charged particles in storage rings , in particular the proton  for which an indirect bound , @xmath9 cm , has been extracted from the @xmath10hg edm @xcite  and the deuteron .",
    "it may be possible , moreover , to measure in this way the edms of other light nuclei , for example @xmath11 and @xmath12 , as well .",
    "a nonzero edm signal in this new generation of experiments would be an unambiguous sign of new physics at energy scales similar to those probed by the lhc , since the edms resulting from the quark - mixing matrix @xcite are orders of magnitude below the current experimental limits .",
    "an important outstanding question is whether it will be possible to identify from the experimental results the microscopic parity- and time - reversal - violating ( @xmath13 ) source .",
    "the sm contains , apart from the quark - mixing phase and its lepton analog , also the @xmath13 qcd @xmath14 term @xcite .",
    "this interaction has dimension four and one might expect it to give the main contribution to hadronic @xmath13 .",
    "however , since the experimental upper limit on the neutron edm constrains the vacuum angle @xmath14 to be unnaturally small  @xcite , @xmath15 , non - sm contributions from higher - dimensional @xmath13 sources can be relevant , or even dominant .",
    "these higher - dimensional operators originate from an ultraviolet complete theory at a high energy scale @xmath16 beyond the electroweak scale .",
    "the first such effective @xmath13 operators one can write down have effective dimension six  @xcite , _ viz . _",
    "the quark edm ( qedm ) , the quark and gluon chromo - electric dipole moments ( qcedm and gcedm , respectively ) , and two four - quark ( fq ) interactions .",
    "it is difficult to calculate hadronic properties directly from a lagrangian written in terms of quark and gluon fields .",
    "still , long - distance effects of the strong interactions can be described independently of assumptions about the dynamics of qcd if one uses the low - energy effective field theory ( eft ) known as chiral perturbation theory ( @xmath17pt ) @xcite ( for reviews see refs .",
    "@xcite ) , which translates microscopic operators into operators that contain nucleon , pion , and photon fields . after the translation , one is able to calculate hadronic properties directly from the effective lagrangian . for the nucleon edm ( and its associated form factor ) stemming from the dimension - four @xmath14 term ,",
    "this method was first used in refs .",
    "@xcite , and later extended in the context of @xmath18 @xcite and @xmath19 @xcite @xmath17pt . in this way it is possible to establish a link to @xmath20-conserving ( @xmath20 ) interactions @xcite .",
    "this approach can be generalized to include the dimension - six sources @xcite .",
    "different @xmath13 sources at the quark - gluon level produce different hadronic interactions .",
    "the effective chiral lagrangian includes not only interactions that stem from spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking and are therefore chiral invariant , but also interactions that break chiral symmetry in the same way as chiral - symmetry - breaking operators at the qcd level .",
    "thus , while they all break @xmath0 and @xmath1 , the dimension - six operators break chiral symmetry differently from each other and from the @xmath14 term . given enough observables it should be possible to separate the various @xmath13 sources on the basis of the hadronic interactions that they generate .",
    "recently it was argued @xcite that a measurement of the deuteron edm in combination with the neutron or proton edm could partially separate the fundamental @xmath13 sources . a measurement of the deuteron edm significantly larger than the nucleon edm would point toward new physics in the guise of a quark chromo - edm .",
    "the calculation was based on a perturbative - pion approach @xcite to nuclear eft , which assumes that pion exchange can be treated in perturbation theory .",
    "a major advantage of this approach is that analytical results can be obtained . on the other hand ,",
    "such a framework is applicable only below the momentum scale ( @xmath21 mev ) at which one - pion - exchange ( ope ) becomes significant .",
    "this is the case for nuclei where the binding momentum per nucleon is small compared to the pion mass , but even then the size of uncertainties is set by the inverse of the relatively low energy scale .    our goal in this article is to provide a framework for the calculation of the edms of light nuclei using chiral eft with nonperturbative ope @xcite . by treating ope nonperturbatively ,",
    "the eft gets extended to higher momenta and thus denser nuclei , and convergence improves .",
    "the fact that nuclear binding momenta are small in the typical scale of qcd ( @xmath22 gev ) is sufficient for a general power counting that is able to estimate which hadronic interactions are dominant for each fundamental @xmath13 source . the @xmath13 potential has been derived previously @xcite , and here we obtain the associated @xmath13 currents . as explicit examples we consider the edms of the deuteron ( @xmath23h ) , the triton ( @xmath24h ) , and the helion ( @xmath24he ) .",
    "the edms of the deuteron @xcite and helion @xcite have been investigated previously within traditional meson - exchange frameworks . in the most comprehensive studies @xcite one started from `` realistic '' nuclear - force models and a general @xmath13 nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath25 ) interaction @xcite .",
    "the edms were expressed in terms of three @xmath13 non - derivative pion - nucleon interactions , which are often assumed to be of similar size and dominate the edms , and in addition short - range @xmath13 interactions due to the exchange of heavier mesons were included .",
    "the major advantage of a chiral eft framework is that it has a direct link to qcd and exploits the chiral properties of the fundamental @xmath13 sources .",
    "moreover , the power - counting scheme allows a perturbative expansion such that the theoretical uncertainties can be estimated and the results can be improved systematically .",
    "when the chiral - symmetry properties of the dimension - four and dimension - six operators are considered new insights are in fact obtained @xcite . at leading order , only two of the three @xmath13 pion - nucleon interactions contribute . moreover , there are in general at the same order more contributions , _ viz .",
    "_ short - range contributions to the neutron and proton edms and two @xmath13 @xmath25 contact interactions .",
    "as we will demonstrate below , the edms of light nuclei can be expressed in terms of these six @xmath13 parameters , or low - energy constants ( lecs ) .",
    "( other @xmath13 moments , such as the deuteron magnetic quadrupole moment , depend in addition on @xmath13 pion - nucleon - photon interactions @xcite . ) for three of the four @xmath13 sources , only a subset of these six lecs is in fact needed .",
    "each lec can in principle be calculated from the underlying @xmath13 source using an explicit solution of qcd at low energies , for example through lattice simulations . compared to nucleons",
    ", the edms of light nuclei can give crucial complementary information about the fundamental @xmath13 source .",
    "however , the conventional assumption that the three @xmath13 pion - nucleon interactions can cover the whole range of nuclear edms is oversimplified .    for the @xmath20 potential we use here realistic phenomenological potentials @xcite .",
    "this `` hybrid '' approach @xcite is justified whenever there is little sensitivity to the details of short - range physics , since such realistic potentials all include the long - range pion exchange that appears in chiral eft at lo .",
    "such an approach has been tested successfully for other observables @xcite , such as the @xmath20 form factors of the deuteron @xcite and @xmath26 @xmath27 observables @xcite .",
    "the results in refs .",
    "@xcite suggest that the same is true for edms , and we partially confirm this below .",
    "we use the codes from refs .",
    "@xmath28 , but we recast and extend the results in the framework of chiral eft with nonperturbative ope . in particular , we apply power counting in order to make more model - independent statements .",
    "the cases of the helion and the triton are typical of a generic nucleus . however",
    ", in the deuteron , because of its isoscalar character , the formally lo contribution from the @xmath14 term vanishes @xcite , a property expected @xcite for nuclei with equal number of protons and neutrons , @xmath29 .",

    "we quote here the argonne @xmath312 numbers at 2.5 gev , but we emphasize that they represent only an order of magnitude estimate .",
    "we obtain @xmath329    in total , then , as anticipated in sections [ toddlag ] and [ generic ] , the edms of helion and triton ( as the edms of light nuclei in general ) are functions of six @xmath13 lecs : @xmath330 and @xmath331 where @xmath145 applies for @xmath14 , qcedm , and @xmath17i ; @xmath146 for qcedm and @xmath17i ; @xmath332 for qedm and @xmath17i ; and @xmath214 for @xmath17i only",

    "if we assume the neutron and proton edms to be saturated by their long - range part , that is , the chiral log in eq . , eq .",
    "shows that the short - range term is comparable to the pion - exchange contribution .",
    "to be on the safe side , it seems better not to neglect the lo nucleon edms for the @xmath14 term , even though the power counting tells us it should be subleading ; then @xmath334 this argument holds equally well for the qcedm , except that now also @xmath146 contributes : @xmath335    finally in the case of @xmath17i , we expect the tri - nucleon edm to consist of @xmath336 pion exchange , insertions of the @xmath13 short - range @xmath27 interactions , and the contributions from the nucleon edms .",

    "however , one should keep in mind the large uncertainty in the @xmath214 coefficients , and that these dimensional - analysis estimates could easily be offset by dimensionless factors in the lecs .",
    "historically , hadronic edms have mostly been discussed in the framework of a one - boson - exchange model . it is assumed that @xmath0- and @xmath1-violation is propagated by pions which are parametrized by three @xmath13 non - derivative interactions . in our notation , @xmath340 ( in the nuclear physics literature , where chiral symmetry and power counting",

    "hadronic edms are calculated as a function of these three parameters . in some cases",
    "the effects of heavier bosons are included as well . in this work",
    "we argue that this model is oversimplified .",
    "there is _ a priori _ no reason not to include @xmath13 photon - nucleon and short - range nucleon - nucleon interactions at low energies . by studying the chiral properties of the fundamental @xmath13 sources of dimension up to six at the qcd scale",
    ", it is possible to construct a model - independent hadronic @xmath13 lagrangian with a definite hierarchy between the different @xmath13 hadronic interactions .",
    "it is found that the one - pion - exchange model with three lecs is not appropriate for any of these @xmath13 sources , and in general there are six @xmath13 hadronic interactions that determine the edms of light nuclei .",
    "two of those are in the ope model as well @xmath145 and @xmath146 and the other four are additional interactions that need to be considered when determining hadronic edms .",
    "the @xmath342 interaction is not relevant at lo for any of the fundamental sources .",
    "the other four necessary lecs are the isoscalar and isovector components of the neutron and proton edms and two isoscalar @xmath13 @xmath25 interactions of short range .",
    "the isovector @xmath13 @xmath25 interactions come in at higher order for all sources .",
    "we therefore propose that nuclear edms be analyzed on the basis of these six lecs . in the previous sections we discussed edms of light nuclei , providing specific examples in the form of the deuteron , helion , and triton . in table",
    "[ table1 ] the dependence of these various edms on the six lecs is summarized .",
    "from the table it is clear that using the ope model gives an oversimplified view .",
    "at least six observables are required to identify the six lecs .",
    "if other light nuclei become the target of experimental investigation , their edms can be calculated along similar lines at the cost of larger computer resources .",
    "we hope that edms of heavier systems can be also expressed in terms of these six lecs",
    ". however , in these cases there could be significant enhancement factors for the @xmath13 potential contribution @xcite , making important otherwise subleading terms in the potential @xcite , such as the third non - derivative pion - nucleon coupling @xmath343 .",

    "the effects of the @xmath13 potential from the qedm are suppressed compared to the nucleon edms @xcite , although enhancements could make them more relevant for heavier nuclei .",
    "@xmath13 from @xmath14 and qcedm manifests itself in edms of light nuclei that differ significantly from the edms of their constituents . for both sources , the edms we calculated depend at lo on four of the six lecs @xmath145 , @xmath146 , @xmath143 , and @xmath144 but in different ways . for the qcedm ,",
    "the distinguishing feature is that the deuteron edm is expected to be significantly larger than the isoscalar nucleon edm , thanks to @xmath170 .",
    "thus , a measurement of nucleon and deuteron edms could be sufficient to qualitatively pinpoint , or exclude , qcedm as a dominant @xmath13 source , and to fix the values of @xmath172 and @xmath170 .",
    "then , the isoscalar combination of helion and triton edms , @xmath345 , which in lo only depends on @xmath170 , becomes a falsifiable prediction of the theory , @xmath346 if , to be on the safe side , we keep some subleading terms ( the nucleon edms ) as we did in eqs .",
    "( [ hedmqcedm ] ) and ( [ tedmqcedm ] ) , then we get ( including the subleading term @xmath347 in eq .",
    "( [ dedmqcedm ] ) ) an additional @xmath348 on the right - hand side of eq . ( [ careful ] ) .",
    "furthermore , @xmath349 can then be extracted from @xmath350 ( see eqs .",
    "( [ hedmqcedm ] ) and ( [ tedmqcedm ] ) ) , leading to testable predictions for other @xmath13 observables .",
    "in contrast , for the standard model @xmath14 term we do not expect the deuteron edm to be significantly different from twice the isoscalar nucleon edm .",
    "although the deuteron edm formally depends on the isoscalar nucleon edm and on the pion - nucleon couplings @xmath349 and @xmath170 , the results of section [ deuteron ] show that the pion - exchange contribution is likely only @xmath351% of the nucleon edm . on the other hand , the edms of @xmath2he and @xmath2h , eqs . and , are dominated by @xmath349 , although they receive important contributions from the neutron and proton edms .",
    "in particular , we expect the isovector combination @xmath350 , which is sensitive to @xmath349 , to differ from the isovector nucleon edm @xmath352 , while the isoscalar combination @xmath353 should be close to @xmath354 : @xmath355 the experimental observation of these relations in nucleon , deuteron , helion , and triton edm experiments would qualitatively indicate the @xmath14 term as the main source responsible for @xmath13 .",
    "quantitatively , the measurement of nucleon , helion , and triton edm allows extraction of the coupling @xmath349 , which then can be used to provide testable predictions of other @xmath13 observables , like the proton schiff moment @xcite or the deuteron mqm @xcite , which are not sensitive to the nucleon edms .",
    "finally , in the case of the @xmath17i sources the analysis is in principle most complicated , due to the appearance of all six lecs .",
    "like for @xmath14 , the deuteron edm , although formally dependent on @xmath146 at lo , is probably dominated by @xmath143 . the tri - nucleon edms and",
    "formally depend on all six lecs , but they are again possibly dominated by @xmath291 and @xmath352 .",
    "it might thus be difficult to separate the @xmath17i sources from qedm . for less dilute , but still light , systems we expect different results .",
    "for these systems , in the case of qedm the edms are still dominated by @xmath172 , but for @xmath17i sources we expect the contributions from the @xmath13 potential to be more significant , implying that measurements on these systems might separate @xmath17i sources from qedm .",
    "of course , more extensive calculations are necessary to verify this claim .    in conclusion , we have argued that an experimental program to measure light nuclear edms could offer valuable information on yet undiscovered sources of parity and time - reversal violation .",
    "our case is based on some crucial , but relatively general assumptions , such as the validity of the standard model with its minimal particle content at the electroweak scale , and the naturalness of interaction strengths .",
    "elsewhere @xcite it has already been pointed out basically on the basis of dimensional analysis that sensitivity to the deuteron edm at the level hoped for in storage ring experiments @xcite would probe scales where new physics is expected . a similar analysis holds for our tri - nucleon results , eqs . and .",
    "but our results here go beyond dimensional analysis and suggest that , at least for the lightest nuclei , the contribution of the neutron and proton edms are more important than expected by simple power counting . for all sources ,",
    "they compete with , when they do not dominate , the effects of the @xmath13 potential . for this reason , other @xmath13 observables insensitive to the nucleon edms",
    ", for example higher @xmath13 electromagnetic moments , could provide important complementary information and a cleaner way to extract pion - nucleon and nucleon - nucleon @xmath13 couplings .",

    "<S> we set up the framework for the calculation of electric dipole moments ( edms ) of light nuclei using the systematic expansion provided by chiral effective field theory ( eft ) . </S>",
    "<S> we take into account parity ( @xmath0 ) and time - reversal ( @xmath1 ) violation which , at the quark - gluon level , originates from the qcd vacuum angle and dimension - six operators capturing physics beyond the standard model . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that edms of light nuclei can be expressed in terms of six low - energy constants that appear in the @xmath0- and @xmath1-violating nuclear potential and electric current . as examples , </S>",
