    "wolf - rayet ( wr ) galaxies host very bright episodes of star formation characterized by the emission of broad wr bumps in their optical spectrum ( osterbrock & cohen , 1982 ) . the two main bumps in the optical range are the blue bump , centered at a wavelength of 4650  , produced by the emission from nv , niii , ciii / civ and heii and associated with wc and wn stars , and the red bump which is fainter and is centered at @xmath0 5800  , produced mainly by ciii and civ , and associated with wc stars .",
    "the lines making up these bumps originate in the dense stellar winds from wr stars ejecting metals into the interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "the number of known wr galaxies has tremendously increased from the discovery of the first one ( he2 - 10 : allen et al .",
    "1976 ) , with different published catalogs ( conti , 1991 ; schaerer et al . 1999 ; guseva et al . 2000 ; zhang et al . 2007 ) until the list of wr galaxies in the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) by brinchmann et al .",
    "( 2008 ) with around 570 objects with the identification of the wr bumps in their integrated spectra .",
    "there is an increasing evidence that the most challenging problems for this kind of objects appears in the low metallicity galaxies .",
    "although it is well documented that the number of wr stars and the intensity of the wr bumps are higher for higher metallicities ( crowther , 2007 ) , the values found in some low metallicity hii galaxies , such as izw18 ( legrand et al .",
    "1997 ) are claimed to be much higher than those predicted by synthesis population models ( _ e.g. _ gonzlez - delgado et al .",
    "2005 ) . among the other important open issues regarding wr galaxies",
    "is the chemical enrichment of the ism surrounding the stellar clusters where the wr stars are located .",
    "it is well known that there is an overabundance of the n / o ratio found in some wr nebulae ( e.g. vlchez & esteban 1991 , esteban & vlchez 1992 , fernndez - martn et al .",
    "2012 ) and also in the ism of some wr galaxies , where the wr features are diluted ( _ e.g. _ hs0837 + 4717 , pustilnik et al .",
    "2004 , ngc5253 , lpez - snchez et al .",
    "2007 , other hii galaxies in hgele et al . 2006 , 2008 , _ green pea _ galaxies , amorn et al .",
    "brinchmann et al .",
    "( 2008 ) also showed that the median n / o ratio in wr galaxies with ew(h@xmath1 ) @xmath2 100  , has an excess of @xmath0 25@xmath3 in relation to the other star - forming galaxies in the sdss .",
    "chemical evolution models do not predict high n / o values in these low - metallicity galaxies ( moll et al .",
    "2006 ) , as for 12+log(o / h ) @xmath2 8.2 most of the n in the ism has a primary origin and therefore its chemical abundance does not depend on the metallicity of the gas , and the expected n / o ratio for closed - box models has a constant value around log(n / o ) @xmath4 -1.5 .",
    "however , many of these integrated observations do not allow us to properly relate the excess in some chemical species with their wr content .    to investigate the issue , among others , of the possible connection between the presence of wr stars and the chemical pollution of the surrounding ism we have carried out a program to study metal - poor wr galaxies by means of integral field spectroscopy ( ifs ; kehrig et al .",
    "2008 , prez - montero et al .",
    "2011 , kehrig et al .",
    "integrated observations , such as long - slit or fibers , may fail to correlate the spatial location and distribution of wr features with respect to the physical conditions and the chemical abundances of the ism as derived from the optical emission - lines .",
    "thus , a two - dimensional analysis of the ionized material in galaxies helps us to better understand the interplay between the massive stellar population and the ism .",
    "for instance , whether wr stars are a significant contributor to abundance fluctuations on timescales of _ t _",
    "10@xmath5 yr and to the formation of high - ionization lines ( e.g. heii 4686  ) are still unsolved issues ( _ e.g. _ kehrig et al .",
    "2011 , shirazi & brichmann , 2012 ) that can be probed more precisely when applying ifs to nearby galaxies ( see kehrig et al .",
    "2013 ) .",
    "thus far , the results coming from wr galaxies studied with ifs point to different scenarios , depending on the relative position between the local or extended n and/or he enrichment and the location(s ) of the wr stars .",
    "lpez - snchez et al .",
    "( 2011 ) claimed to find a local n overabundance associated with wr emission in ic-10 .",
    "a similar result is found by james et al .",
    "( 2013b ) for the blue compact dwarf galaxy haro 11 .",
    "monreal - ibero et al .",
    "( 2012 ) also find in ngc5253 local peaks of high n / o ( see also westmoquette et al .",
    "2013 ) , but only some of them are associated with wr emission , so this could be indicative of a different timescale between the formation of the wrs and the mixing of the ejected material with the surrounding ism .",
    "a similar scenario is found by kehrig et al .",
    "( 2013 ) in mrk178 , where only one out of three detected wr clusters can be associated with an overabundance of n and he . finally , in prez - montero et al .",
    "( 2011 ) the ifs study of n overabundant objects hs0837 + 4717 and mrk930 , also identified as wr galaxies , lead to high values of n / o in scales of more than 1 kpc , much beyond the power of the observed wr stars to pollute the ism in these scales and thus pointing to other hydrodynamical processes affecting the chemistry of the gas in these galaxies , such as the infall of metal - poor gas ( kppen & hensler , 2005 ) .",

    "we checked that the variation of this temperature across the fov of the instrument does not introduce errors in the theoretical ratio larger than those associated with the flux of the emission lines .      for each fiber spectrum we derived its corresponding reddening coefficient , c(h@xmath1 ) , using a weighted fit to the values of the balmer decrement derived from h@xmath17/h@xmath1 and h@xmath18/h@xmath1 as compared to the theoretical values expected for recombination case b from storey @xmath19 hummer ( 1995 ) at the electron density and temperature obtained from the integrated sdss dr-7 spectra and applying the extinction law given by cardelli et al .",

    "the chemical abundances of oxygen and nitrogen were studied in a representative sample of the observed spaxels in the six wr galaxies using different methods as explained below .",
    "the most accurate method to derive oxygen abundances in emission - line objects , as those in our sample , is the so - called direct method which depends on the relative intensity of both nebular oxygen emission lines to a hydrogen recombination emission - line , such as h@xmath1 ( _ i.e. _ [ oii]/h@xmath1 for o@xmath21/h@xmath21 and [ oiii]/h@xmath1 for o@xmath22/h@xmath21 ) , and the previous determination of the electron temperature , via the quotient between auroral - to - nebular emission lines , such as [ oiii ]  4363  and [ oiii ]  5007  .",

    "( 2011 ) or kehrig et al .",
    "( 2013 ) for additional details of this procedure and how to calculate the low - excitation electron temperature to derive low - excitation ionic abundances .",
    "this method was applied to the sdss dr7 spectra of the brightest regions of the six observed galaxies leading to values of the total oxygen abundances compatible with the low metallicity regime .",
    "owing to the spectral coverage in the sdss spectra ( 3800 - 9100   ) , the [ oii ]  3727  emission - line was not detected in wr038 , wr057 , and wr505 , and the [ oii ]  7319,7330  were used instead , as described in kniazev et al .",
    "the total abundances derived in the sdss spectra using this method are listed in table [ abs ] .    regarding the pmas ifs observations ,",
    "the direct method was applied in a representative number of spaxels only in wr039 , where the [ oiii ]  4363  emission line was detected with acceptable s / n ( @xmath23 2.5 ) . in the other galaxies of our sample , the direct method could only be applied in the brightest spaxels in wr038 , wr057 , and wr505 and in none of them in wr266 and wr404 .",
    "therefore , the spatial analysis of the chemical properties in these galaxies was done by means of strong - line methods .",
    "we first resorted to the n2 parameter ( _ e.g. _ denicol et al .",
    "2002 ) , defined as the ratio between [ nii ]  6584  and h@xmath17 .",
    "this parameter has the advantage that it does not depend on reddening nor flux calibration uncertainties and is linearly well correlated with oxygen abundance up to solar metallicities . on the contrary it has an important drawback when it is used for extended objects , as those studied in this work by means of ifs , as it also varies as a function of the excitation conditions ( prez - montero & daz 2005 ) .",
    "we verified in what objects this method could be applied to derive reliably the spatial distribution of the oxygen abundance , by plotting in figure [ exc ] the relation between the n2 parameter and the [ oii]/[oiii ]  ratio , which traces the nebular excitation .",
    "as can be seen , in the most extended objects of our sample , wr404 and wr505 , there is a clear correlation between these two emission - line ratios . in the other objects there is no clear relation between them , with the possible exception of wr057 , but in this object",
    "the spatial variation of n2 is lower than the observational errors .",
    "hence , in the case of wr404 and wr505 galaxies , we used the strong - line parameter o3n2 , firstly introduced as a metallicity calibrator by alloin et al .",
    "( 1979 ) and which is defined as the emission - line ratio between [ oiii ]  5007  and [ nii ]  6584  .",
    "according to several authors , such as pettini & pagel ( 2004 ) or prez - montero & contini ( 2009 ) , this parameter is not valid for very low metallicity objects ( 12+log(o / h ) @xmath2 8.0 ) but , on the contrary , its dependence on excitation is much lower than in the case of n2 . according to the values derived from the sdss spectra for wr404 and wr505 , their mean",
    "oxygen abundances are higher than the lower limit for o3n2 , so this parameter was used for these two objects instead .    for the sake of consistency between the three employed methods ( direct method in the case of wr039 , n2 parameter for wr038 , wr057 , and wr266 , and o3n2 for wr404 and wr505 ) we used the calibrations presented in prez - montero & contini ( 2009 ) for n2 and o3n2 , which are consistent with the direct method .",
    "the resulting oxygen abundance maps of the six observed galaxies are plotted in figure [ oh ] along with the histogram distributions of the abundances in those spaxels with enough s / n in all the involved emission lines ( s / n @xmath23 2.5 ) .    in the case of the nitrogen - to - oxygen ratio ( n / o )",
    "the direct method can also be used to derive the n@xmath21/h@xmath21 ratio and then deriving n / o using the approximation n@xmath21/o@xmath21 @xmath4 n / o [ as before see further details in prez - montero et al . ( 2011 ) or kehrig et al .",

    "this ratio has the advantage that it has a monotonic linear relation with n / o and , contrary to n2 , it does not have any dependence on excitation as it only depends on low - excitation emission - lines .",

    "the use of ifs is fundamental to study the spatial extent of the chemical properties of the ism in extended objects . in this context",
    ", this technique along with the use of appropriate statistical tools allows us to explore the presence of chemical inhomogeneities in both o / h and n / o , and to relate this local pollution with the position of wr stars , whose stellar winds enrich the surrounding ism with the products of the main sequence nuclear burning of massive stars .",
    "our statistical method points to a high degree of homogeneity in o / h across the fov of the studied galaxies , implying scales of several kpc , with the only exception of wr404 , where a possible gradient of metallicity is found .",
    "this spatial variation of the metallicity goes from lower values in the brightest region of the galaxy at the se , to slightly higher values in the low surface brightness tail towards the nw .",
    "our spatial analysis of n / o reveals that only wr057 presents values for which the homogeneity of this abundance ratio can not be ruled out . in contrast , for all the other cases the conditions assumed to consider a homogeneous distribution of n / o are not fulfilled , as very high values of this ratio in certain positions of the fov were measured .",
    "although the wr blue bump is detectable in the sdss spectra of the six selected galaxies , we only found it in our pmas observations in two spaxels of the wr039 galaxy .",
    "these are marked with red crosses in figure [ halfa ] .",
    "a thorough analysis of the causes of the missing detection of the bump in the other objects will be performed in a forthcoming paper .",
    "figure [ wrbb ] shows a portion of the spectrum obtained by co - adding the emission from the 2 spaxels with the wr bump detection .",
    "the measured luminosity of the bump at the adopted distance , once the emission lines over the bump were removed , [ l@xmath25 = 10@xmath26 erg / s ] , is consistent with the value measured in the integrated sdss spectrum [ l@xmath25 = 10@xmath27 erg / s ] .",
    "in contrast , the equivalent width of the bump in these two spaxels ( 20@xmath244  ) is much higher than in the sdss spectrum ( 8@xmath244  ) , as expected taking into account the fact that the collected stellar continuum in the area of the two 1  pmas spaxels is fainter than in the 3  sdss fiber .    to investigate the possible connection between the detected nitrogen overabundance and the location of the wr stars ,",
    "we identified in the histograms shown in figure [ oh ] and [ no ] the probable positions of the wr stars . in the case of wr039 , where the wr bump was detected in our ifs data , the corresponding spaxels with wr emission are plotted as red bars . in the rest of the objects , we selected the four spaxels probably encompassed by the sdss fiber and which are thought to host the wr population , and we plotted them in the histograms as black bars .",
    "this subset of spaxels always include the brightest h@xmath17 position in the observed galaxies .",
    "finally , to study the possible extent of the n pollution , we also identified the 12 spaxels around these 4 positions of the sdss fiber as brown bars in the histograms .",
    "as can be seen in the histograms and can also be confirmed by visual inspection of the n / o maps , the nitrogen overabundance is tightly related to the position of the wrs in wr038 , wr039 , wr266 , and wr505 , although there is not a perfect match between them .",
    "this is well illustrated in the unique case where we identified the wr emission , wr039 , where the n overabundance is slightly displaced in relation to the position of the wr bumps .",
    "the other galaxy whose n / o is not homogeneous is wr404 , but in this case , this is probably related to the gradient of metallicity across its tail detected in the o / h analysis , as no direct relation between the n overabundance and the positions of the wrs is detected .",
    "the results obtained in this work , in which we find evidence for a local nitrogen overabundance ( in zones of the order of 100 pc around the position of the wr bumps ) in four out of the six observed galaxies by means of ifs have the following implications :    - wr stars are possibly the main cause of the overabundance of nitrogen observed in 4 out of 6 observed galaxies at spatial scales of the order of several hundreds of parsecs detected around the position of these stars , differing from the objects studied in prez - montero et al .",
    "( 2011 ) where this overabundance was detected at scales of several kpc .",
    "according to the chemical yields of massive stars from moll & terlevich ( 2012 ) presented in figure 14 of prez - montero et al .",
    "( 2011 ) the stellar masses of the ionizing clusters in the sample of wr galaxies studied here , ( all of them around 10@xmath28 m@xmath29 ) can produce a n / o excess at distances compatible with the scales at which the n pollution has been detected by means of ifs in this work .    - as the local n pollution has not been observed in all the studied objects in this work and , in those where it was observed , it does not show a perfect match with the positions of the wr bump .",
    "although it is necessary to take the limited spatial resolution of our observations into account , this mismatch could be possibly due to a timescale offset between the lifetime of the wr stars and the mixing of the ejected material with the ism .",
    "possibly , the positions with relatively high n / o trace regions where the wr stars were present . in contrast",
    ", the positions where the bumps are detected are tracing the ongoing star formation regions .",
    "this spatial mismatch between n excess and wr positions has also been observed in other nearby star - forming objects studied by means of optical ifs ( _ e.g. _ ngc5253 , monreal - ibero et al .",
    "this timescale offset between wr lifetimes and n mixing is supported by the results from other previous works based on ifs data where wr stars were reported , but not the excess in n / o ( _ e.g. _ in this work , wr057 and wr404 , in hs0837 + 4717 and mrk930 in prez - montero et al .",
    "2011 , or in two out of the three wr clusters detected in mrk178 ( kehrig et al .",
    "2013 ) .",
    "- the local nitrogen pollution happens while homogeneous values of the oxygen abundance are found , which could be indicative that oxygen is not noticeably present in the winds ejected by the wr stars at this stage .",
    "apparently the properties of these winds ( density , velocity , etc ... ) favour the mixing of their components with the surrounding warm ism .",
    "however , the mixing expected later of the oxygen ejected during the last stages of the wr phase and the subsequent o - rich sne explosions have a timescale much longer than that of early wr winds ( _ e.g. _ tenorio - tagle 1996 ) .    - additional mechanisms other than the enrichment due to wr winds are thought to be responsible for the nitrogen overabundance in star - forming galaxies .",
    "this is the case of collisional deexcition of o@xmath21 in strong shocks associated with mergers ( raymond 1979 ) or other hydrodynamical processes , such as the infall of pristine gas ( kppen & hensler , 2005 ) , which can at same time reduce the overall metallicity of galaxies and boost the star - formation .",
    "these processes could be behind the relation between metallicity and star - formation rate in galaxies .",
    "on the contrary , such a mechanism will not have any influence on the abundance ratio of metals as n and o ( edmunds 1990 ) .",
    "a very suitable tool to identify these processes and to distinguish them from local pollution , as in the case of n ejection by wr stars , is the simultaneous analysis of the relations between stellar mass and metallicity ( mzr ) and with n / o ( mnor ) .",
    "this was already used by amorn et al .",
    "( 2010 ) to understand the low metallicity combined with n / o ratio much higher than the values in the plateau of the diagram o / h vs. n / o measured in _ green pea _ galaxies . in that work",
    "the analysis of these galaxies shows that these objects have the expected n / o for their masses , while they have systematically lower metallicities , even though wr stars have been detected in deep gtc spectra of some of them ( amorn et al .",
    "2012 ) .",
    "hence , for wr galaxies , we try to understand their average observed n / o excess , as reported by brinchmann et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , doing the same analysis . in figure [ sdss_wr ]",
    "is shown the mzr for the star - forming galaxies of the sdss , with their stellar masses compiled from the max planck institute for astrophysics - johns hopkins university ( mpa - jhu ) catalog and oxygen abundances calculated using the n2 parameter for emission lines with s / n larger than 2 . the solid red line , as explained in prez - montero et al .",
    "( 2013 ) is a quadratic fit to the medians for stellar mass bins of 0.2  dex .",
    "the black points are the matches between the wr galaxy catalog by brinchmann et al .",
    "( 2008 ) and all the other star - forming sdss galaxies selected from the mpa / jhu list .",
    "the number of matches obeying the s / n criterion and having a minimum redshift ( @xmath30 ) to avoid serious aperture effects in the determination of the stellar mass , as described in prez - montero et al .",
    "( 2013 ) , is 254 . in the right panel of the same figure",
    "is shown the mnor , as calculated using the n2s2 parameter with the calibration by prez - montero & contini ( 2009 ) .",
    "as can be appreciated , and contrary to _ green pea _ galaxies , the wr galaxies are in average in agreement with the metallicities expected for their stellar mass but , in contrast , have larger n / o ratios , which could be just local pollution values in the same region covered by the sdss fiber and possibly due to the enrichment by wr stars .",
    "in this work we presented 3.5 m caha - pmas ifs observations of six metal - poor compact wr galaxies selected from the catalog published by brinchmann et al .",
    "( 2008 ) in the optical spectral range 3700 - 6850  .",
    "our aim is to study the connection between the presence of wr stars and n / o excess as compared with the values predicted by chemical evolution models at this metallicity regime .",
    "we derived o / h and n / o abundances ratios using the direct method ( _ i.e. _ with the determination of the electron temperature ) , or strong - line methods based on [ nii]6584  emission line , such as n2 , o3n2 ( for o / h ) , and n2o2 ( for n / o ) with the calibrations provided by prez - montero & contini ( 2009 ) , which are consistent with the direct method .",
    "we studied the homogeneity of the spatial distributions of both o / h and n / o using the same statistical procedure introduced by prez - montero et al .",
    "( 2011 ) and improved by kehrig et al .",
    "( 2013 ) .",
    "our results indicate that in all the studied objects o / h can be considered as uniform in scales of the order of several kpc , with the exception of wr404 , for which a gradient of o / h is found in the same direction of a low surface brightness tail .",
    "in contrast , n / o can only be considered as homogeneous in wr057 . in four of the six studied galaxies ( wr038 , wr039 , wr266 , and wr505 ) we found positions associated with or close to the wr stars with n excess in spatial scales of the order of several hundreds of pc .",
    "we discussed that , according to the models presented by prez - montero et al .",
    "( 2011 ) based on massive star yields of moll & terlevich ( 2012 ) , the n excess length scale is consistent with the distances at which the stellar clusters in these galaxies can enhance the gas - phase abundance of n. on the other hand , our analysis of both the mzr and the mnor of the wr galaxies of the sdss wr catalog of brinchmann et al .",
    "( 2008 ) excludes hydrodynamical effects , such as metal - poor gas inflows , as the more frequent cause of the n excess detected in the sdss galaxies with a detection of the wr bump .",
