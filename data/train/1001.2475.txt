    "transport through a model single - level quantum dot captures many interesting and important features of transport phenomena in real quantum dots .",
    "one of such phenomena , which has been of great interest in the last decade , is the kondo effect .",
    "@xcite when the dot is occupied by a single electron , virtual transitions between the dot and electron reservoirs ( external leads ) cause spin fluctuations in the dot . as a result ,",
    "the dot s spin becomes screened by electrons of the reservoirs , which results in the formation of a non - local spin singlet ground state of the system .",
    "furthermore , a resonance in the density of states appears at the fermi level , which gives rise to enhanced transmission through the dot . in experiments",
    ", this leads to the well - known zero - bias anomaly , i.e. a peak at zero bias in the differential conductance .",
    "@xcite    when the reservoirs are ferromagnetic , the effective exchange field generated by the electrodes may suppress the kondo anomaly .",
    "@xcite more specifically , when the dot described by an asymmetric anderson model is symmetrically coupled to ferromagnetic leads , then the kondo effect becomes suppressed in the parallel configuration , while in the antiparallel configuration the kondo anomaly survives .",
    "however , the kondo effect in the parallel configuration can be restored , when an external magnetic field , which compensates the exchange field created by the ferromagnetic leads , is applied .",
    "@xcite this behavior was confirmed in a couple of recent experiments .",
    "@xcite    the situation becomes more complex and physically richer when the dot is exchange - coupled to an additional reservoir .",
    "@xcite such a model captures the essential physics of the so - called two - channel kondo effect .",
    "@xcite in the two - channel kondo problem , two separate electron reservoirs ( channels ) compete with each other to screen the impurity s spin .",
    "if the coupling to one of them is larger than to the other one , a usual single - channel kondo state ( spin singlet ) is formed between the dot and more strongly coupled reservoir .",
    "this results in two competing kondo ground states of the system , depending on the ratio of coupling strengths to the first and second conduction channels .",
    "interestingly , these two kondo states are separated by a quantum critical point , where both couplings are equal and an exotic two - channel kondo state is formed , which can not be described within the landau fermi - liquid theory . very recently",
    ", the two - channel kondo effect has been explored experimentally in quantum dots .",
    "@xcite the experimental setup consisted of a small quantum dot coupled to external leads and to a large coulomb - blockaded island .",
    "while the electrons could tunnel between the dot and the leads , only virtual tunneling processes between the dot and the island were allowed , resulting in an exchange coupling . by tuning the exchange coupling",
    ", it was possible to study the quantum phase transition between the two ground states of the system and analyze transport behavior in the non - fermi liquid regime .",
    "@xcite theoretically , such a two - channel setup can be modelled for example by a quantum dot which is tunnel - coupled to external leads and exchange - coupled to another electron reservoir .",
    "@xcite    as discussed above , both the kondo effect in a quantum dot coupled to ferromagnetic leads and the two - channel kondo phenomenon were already extensively studied .",
    "however , the interplay of leads ferromagnetism and two - channel kondo effect remains to a large extent unexplored .",
    "therefore , in this paper we address the two - channel kondo problem in the presence of ferromagnetism .",
    "in particular , we consider an anderson quantum dot coupled to ferromagnetic leads and exchange - coupled to a nonmagnetic electron reservoir .",
    "using the numerical renormalization group ( nrg ) method , we analyze the interplay between the effects due to ferromagnetism of the leads and exchange coupling to the additional nonmagnetic reservoir .",
    "depending on the strength of the tunnel coupling @xmath2 and exchange coupling @xmath0 , the dot s spin can be screened either by electrons in the ferromagnetic leads or by electrons in the nonmagnetic reservoir . by analyzing the equilibrium spectral functions and the conductance through the dot ,",
    "we show that in the antiparallel magnetic configuration , the system undergoes a quantum phase transition with increasing exchange coupling @xmath0 , where the conductance drops from the maximum value to zero . for a certain critical value of @xmath0 , @xmath3 , both electron channels try to screen the dot s spin and the conductance approaches a half of the quantum conductance . in the parallel configuration , on the other hand , the conductance is generally suppressed , irrespective of the exchange constant @xmath0 , due to effective spin splitting of the dot level caused by the exchange field coming from ferromagnetic leads .",
    "@xcite we show that the kondo effect can be restored by applying a properly tuned external magnetic field @xmath4 for @xmath0 below the corresponding critical point , @xmath5 .",
    "furthermore , the quantum critical regime can also be recovered , which however requires a fine - tuning in the parameter space of @xmath0 and @xmath4 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we present the model as well as briefly describe the nrg method together with some details of calculations . in turn , in section",
    "iii we present numerical results for symmetric and asymmetric anderson models in both parallel and antiparallel magnetic configurations of the system .",
    "finally , we conclude in section iv .",

    "the spin - dependent coupling to the left ( right ) lead is described by @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) , while @xmath0 denotes the exchange coupling constant .",
    "the magnetizations of the leads can form either parallel or antiparallel magnetic configuration , as indicated . ]",
    "the considered system consists of a single - level quantum dot tunnel - coupled to left and right ferromagnetic leads and exchange - coupled to a nonmagnetic reservoir , see fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] .",
    "it is assumed that the external leads are made of the same ferromagnetic material and their magnetizations are collinear , so that the system can be either in the parallel or antiparallel magnetic configuration .",

    "the quantum dot is described by the anderson hamiltonian , @xmath21 where @xmath22 creates a spin-@xmath13 electron , @xmath23 denotes the energy of an electron in the dot , and @xmath24 describes the coulomb correlations between two electrons occupying the dot .",
    "the last term corresponds to external magnetic field @xmath4 applied along the @xmath25th direction ( @xmath26 ) and @xmath27 .",
    "the tunnel hamiltonian is given by @xmath28 where @xmath29 describes the spin - dependent hopping matrix elements between the dot and ferromagnetic leads .",
    "the coupling to magnetic leads can be described by @xmath30 .",
    "we have thus shifted the whole spin - dependence into the coupling constants and assumed a flat band of width @xmath31 ,  @xcite where @xmath32 is set as the energy unit , if not stated otherwise .    by means of a unitary transformation in the left - right basis ,",
    "@xcite one can map the problem of tunneling through quantum dot coupled to the left and right leads into a problem where the dot is effectively coupled to a single lead with a new coupling constant , @xmath33 .",
    "this can be done by introducing the following symmetric operators , @xmath34 , with dimensionless coefficients @xmath35 .",
    "then , the tunneling hamiltonian can be written as @xmath36 one can see that now the dot is tunnel - coupled to only one effective electron reservoir , @xmath37 , with new spin - dependent coupling constant @xmath38 .",
    "the other parts of the system hamiltonian , eq .  ( [ eq : h ] ) , are not affected by this transformation .",
    "to parameterize the spin - dependent couplings we also introduce the spin polarization of ferromagnetic leads , @xmath39 .",
    "the couplings can be then written in a compact form as , @xmath40 , where @xmath41 .",
    "assuming symmetric coupling strength of the dot to the leads , the resultant coupling in the antiparallel configuration is the same for the spin - up and spin - down electrons , @xmath42 . on the other hand , in the parallel configuration , the couplings are then different for the two spin directions , @xmath43 , which effectively leads to spin splitting of the dot level and , when this is the case , the kondo resonance may become suppressed because of broken spin degeneracy .",
    "@xcite    finally , the exchange hamiltonian describing the coupling between the dot and the second ( nonmagnetic ) reservoir is given by @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the spin in the dot , @xmath0 denotes the exchange coupling constant and @xmath46 is a vector of pauli spin matrices .",
    "we note that in addition to the exchange scattering of electrons [ described by eq .",
    "( 5 ) ] there could be also potential scattering .",
    "however , in this work we are mainly interested in the low energy physics , where the kondo effect emerges , so the potential scattering may be neglected , as it does not lead to any kondo - type correlations .      to analyze the equilibrium transport properties of the considered system , we employ the numerical renormalization group method @xcite  nonperturbative , very powerful and essentially exact numerical method to address quantum impurity problems .",
    "@xcite the nrg consists in a logarithmic discretization of the conduction band and mapping of the system onto a semi - infinite chain with the impurity ( quantum dot ) sitting at the end of the chain . by diagonalizing the hamiltonian at consecutive sites of the chain and storing the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the system , one can calculate the static and dynamic quantities of the system . in the case of model considered in this paper ,",
    "the hamiltonian is mapped onto two semi - infinite chains , where the first chain corresponds to ferromagnetic leads tunnel - coupled to the dot , while the second one to nonmagnetic reservoir exchange - coupled to the dot . because such two - channel calculations are usually very demanding numerically , it is crucial to exploit as many symmetries of the system s hamiltonian as possible .",
    "especially , using the @xmath47 symmetry decreases the size of hilbert space and thus increases considerably the accuracy of calculations . in particular , to efficiently perform the analysis , we have used the flexible density - matrix numerical renormalization group ( dm - nrg ) code , which can tackle with arbitrary number of both abelian and non - abelian symmetries .",
    "@xcite in calculations we have thus used the @xmath48 symmetry for the @xmath25th component of the total spin , the @xmath48 symmetry for the charge in the first channel , and the @xmath47 symmetry for the charge in the second channel . furthermore , in calculations we have taken the discretization parameter @xmath49 and kept 3000 states at each iteration step .    using the nrg we can calculate the spectral function of the dot , @xmath50 , where @xmath51 denotes the fourier transform of the dot retarded green s function , @xmath52 . on the other hand",
    ", the spectral function can be directly related to the spin - resolved linear conductance @xmath53 by the following formula @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the fermi distribution function and the total conductance is given by , @xmath56 .",
    "at zero temperature , the spin dependent conductance for the parallel configuration is given by , @xmath57 , while for the antiparallel configuration one gets , @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is the zero - temperature spectral function of the @xmath60-level operator in respective magnetic configuration , taken at @xmath61 .",
    "in the following we present numerical results on the equilibrium spectral function and linear conductance , when the quantum dot is in the kondo regime .",
    "we will distinguish between two different situations ; symmetric ( @xmath62 ) and asymmetric ( @xmath63 ) anderson models .",
    "the origin of such a distinction stems from the way in which ferromagnetic leads act on the quantum dot .",
    "more specifically , in the asymmetric anderson model ferromagnetism of the leads gives rise to a spin splitting of the kondo resonance in the parallel configuration , while in the symmetric model no such a splitting appears ( assuming that the dot is coupled with the same strength to the left and right leads ) .",
    "@xcite in other words , an effective exchange field , due to coupling to magnetic leads , acts on the dot in the former case , while such a field vanishes in the latter case . the effective field is directly related to the difference in the coupling strengths of the dot and ferromagnetic leads for the two spin orientations . since the coupling in the spin - up channel is larger than that in the spin - down one , energy of the spin - up ( spin - down ) electron in the dot decreases ( increases ) by @xmath64 . consequently , the spin - dependent coupling acts as an effective magnetic field , leading to spin - splitting @xmath65 of the dot level .",

    "[ fig:2 ] .",

    "in addition , we have found that the quantum critical behavior , which is suppressed in the parallel configuration , can also be recovered by tuning the external magnetic field .",

    "<S> equilibrium transport properties of a single - level quantum dot tunnel - coupled to ferromagnetic leads and exchange - coupled to a side nonmagnetic reservoir are analyzed theoretically in the kondo regime . </S>",
    "<S> the equilibrium spectral functions and conductance through the dot are calculated using the numerical renormalization group ( nrg ) method . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that in the antiparallel magnetic configuration , the system undergoes a quantum phase transition with increasing exchange coupling @xmath0 , where the conductance drops from its maximum value to zero . in the parallel configuration , on the other hand , the conductance is generally suppressed due to an effective spin splitting of the dot level caused by the presence of ferromagnetic leads , irrespective of the strength of exchange constant . however , for @xmath0 ranging from @xmath1 up to the corresponding critical value , the kondo effect and quantum critical behavior can be restored by applying properly tuned compensating magnetic field . </S>"
