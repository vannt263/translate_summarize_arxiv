    "there exist a few statistical mechanical models involving classical continuous spins , by now extensively investigated , and which play a central rle in a variety of real physical situations ; they have been especially studied in their saturated lattice ( sl ) version , where each lattice site hosts one spin .",
    "the interest in their lattice gas ( lg ) extensions was recently revived , and they were addressed by means of analytical theories and simulation ( see for example @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "lg spin models are obtained from their sl counterparts by allowing for fluctuations of occupation numbers , also controlled by the chemical potential @xmath4 .",
    "these models have often been used in connection with alloys and absorption ; the methodology somehow allows for pressure and density effects .    as for symbols and definitions ,",
    "classical sl spin models involve @xmath10component unit vectors @xmath11 , associated with a @xmath12dimensional ( bipartite ) lattice @xmath13 ; let @xmath14 denote dimensionless coordinates of the lattice sites , and let @xmath15 denote cartesian spin components with respect to an orthonormal basis @xmath16 , whose unit vectors can be taken as defined by the lattice axes .",
    "the orientations of the magnetic moments of the particles are parameterized by usual polar angles @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) or spherical ones @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "the interaction potential , restricted to nearest neighbors , is assumed to be ferromagnetic and , in general , anisotropic in spin space , i.e. @xmath21;~ \\nonumber\\\\ \\epsilon > 0,~a \\geq 0,~b \\geq 0,~a+b>0,~\\max(a , b)=1.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] notice also that the condition @xmath22 in the above equation can always be satisfied by a suitable rescaling of @xmath23 ; here and in the following the quantity @xmath23 will be used to set temperature and energy scales ; thus @xmath24 , where @xmath25 denotes the absolute temperature and @xmath26 is the boltzmann constant ; the corresponding ( scaled ) hamiltonian is given by : @xmath27    the case @xmath28 corresponds to the ising model ; isotropic @xmath29-symmetric models ( @xmath30 ) correspond to @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and are referred to as planar rotators ( pr , @xmath18 ) or classical heisenberg model ( he , @xmath20 ) ; the extremely anisotropic and @xmath33-symmetric xy model is defined by @xmath20 , @xmath34 .",
    "for these models the simplification resulting from the neglect of translational degrees of freedom makes it possible to obtain rigorous mathematical results @xcite entailing existence or absence of a phase transition , and , on the other hand , to study it by a whole range of techniques , such as mean field ( mf ) and cluster mean field treatments , high - temperature series expansion of the partition function , renormalization group ( for a recent review see @xcite ) , computer simulation ( usually via monte carlo ( mc ) methods @xcite ) .",
    "lg extensions of the continuous  spin potential model considered here are defined by hamiltonians @xmath35 where @xmath36 denotes occupation numbers ; notice that @xmath37 reinforces the orientation ",
    "dependent term , whereas @xmath38 opposes it , and that a finite value of @xmath39 only becomes immaterial in the sl limit @xmath40 .",
    "it is worth mentioning that in such systems the fluctuating occupation numbers give rise to additional fluid - like observables in comparison to the usual sl situation .",
    "rigorous results entailing existence or absence of an ordering transition are also known for lg models with continuous spins @xcite .",
    "for some models defined by @xmath5 , interactions isotropic in spin space , and supporting a ferromagnetic phase transition in their sl version , it has been proven that there exists a @xmath41 , such that , for all @xmath42 , the system supports a ferromagnetic transition , with a @xmath43dependent transition temperature .",
    "notice that @xmath44 when @xmath45 @xcite , whereas a positive @xmath41 may be needed when @xmath46 .",
    "more recently @xcite , the existence of a first - order transition , involving discontinuities in both density and magnetization , has been proven for the isotropic case ( and @xmath5 ) , in a suitable rgime of low temperature and negative @xmath4 .    for @xmath7 , the sl ",
    "pr model produces at low  temperature the extensively studied berezinski - kosterlitz - thouless ( bkt ) transition @xcite ; the existence of such a transition for the lg counterpart has been proven rigorously as well @xcite .",
    "more recently , it was rigorously proven @xcite that , for @xmath4 negative and sufficiently large in magnitude , the transition becomes first  order .",
    "notice also that the above mathematical theorems do not yield useful numerical estimates of the @xmath4 value where the change of transition sets in ; some answer to this question can be looked for by analytical approximations such as mf or two  side  cluster ( tsc ) treatments @xcite , or by simulation @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian ( eq . ( [ eq02 ] ) ) can be interpreted as describing a two  component system consisting of interconverting `` real '' ( @xmath47 ) and `` ghost '' , `` virtual '' or ideal  gas particles ( @xmath48 ) ; both kinds of particles have the same kinetic energy , @xmath4 denotes the excess chemical potential of `` real '' particles over `` ideal '' ones , and the total number of particles equals the number of available lattice sites ( semi  grand  canonical interpretation ) .",
    "the semi  grand ",
    "canonical interpretation was also used in early studies of the phase diagram of the two  dimensional planar rotator , carried out by the migdal ",
    "kadanoff rg techniques , and aiming at two  dimensional mixtures of @xmath49he and @xmath50he @xcite , where non ",
    "magnetic impurities correspond to @xmath49he .",
    "in the three  dimensional case , the topology of the phase diagram of the model ( [ eq02 ] ) had been investigated by mf and tsc approximations for the ising @xcite as well as pr cases @xcite in the presence of a magnetic field , and for he at zero magnetic field @xcite .",
    "these investigations were later extended @xcite to extremely anisotropic ( ising  like ) two  dimensional lg models defined by @xmath51 in eq .",
    "( [ eq01-a ] ) , and in the absence of a magnetic field as well .",
    "the studied models were found to exhibit a tricritical behaviour i.e. the ordering transition turned out to be of first order for @xmath4 below an appropriate threshold , and of second order above it . when the transition is of first order , the orientationally ordered phase is also denser than the disordered one .",
    "for the three  dimensional pr these finding were confirmed , recently , by simulation in connection with the phase diagram of he @xcite .",
    "it has been found that , despite the simplicity of lg spin models , their predictions broadly agree with the ones obtained by means of more elaborate magnetic fluid models ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) .    on the other hand , thermodynamic and",
    "structural properties had been investigated by means of grand ",
    "canonical monte carlo simulations as well @xcite , for particular values of the chemical potential equal or close to zero .",
    "it had been found that there is a _",
    "second order _ ferromagnetic phase transition manifested by a significant growth of magnetic and density fluctuations .",
    "the transition temperatures were found to be about 20% lower than that of the corresponding sl values and the critical behaviour of the investigated models to be consistent with that of their sl counterparts . furthermore it had been found that mf yields a qualitatively correct picture , and the quantitative agreement with simulation could be improved by tsc , which has the advantage of predicting two - site correlations .",
    "notice also that the above hamiltonian ( eq .",
    "( [ eq02 ] ) ) describes a situation of _ annealed _ dilution ; on the other hand , two  dimensional models in the presence of _ quenched _ dilution , and hence the effect of disorder on the bkt transition , have been investigated using the pr model @xcite and very recently its xy counterpart @xcite ; it was found that a sufficiently weak disorder does not destroy the transition , which survives up to a concentration of vacancies close to the percolation threshold .",
    "let us also remark that two ",
    "component spins are involved in the pr case , whereas xy involves three  component spins but only two of their components are involved in the interaction : in this sense the two models entail different anchorings with respect to the horizontal plane in spin space .",
    "two  dimensional annealed lattice models were investigated @xcite as well , and the obtained results for @xmath6 or a moderately negative @xmath4 were found to support those obtained for quenched models . for a large negative @xmath4 , renormalization group treatments had suggested @xcite that the transition between the bkt and the paramagnetic phase is of first order .    in this paper , we present an extensive monte carlo study of some lg ferromagnetic models , where @xmath4 is negative and comparatively large in magnitude ( notice that @xmath52 would produce an empty ground  state ) , in order to gain insights into their critical behaviour and to check the impact of the chemical potential on their physical properties . on the other hand , for @xmath5",
    ", we will also test the mf or tsc approximations used to obtain the phase diagrams of refs .",
    "@xcite . in keeping with our previous studies ,",
    "the models are further simplified by choosing @xmath53 , i.e. no pure positional interactions .",
    "as for the values of the chemical potential , we chose @xmath8 in the four cases corresponding to our previous investigations with @xmath6 , and carried out additional simulations for @xmath7 , pr and @xmath9 , as explained below .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : the simulation procedure is briefly explained in section [ simulation ] , section [ results ] analyzes the simulation results .",
    "finally , the effects caused by the chemical potential on the nature of the transition are discussed in section [ conclusion ] , which summarizes our results , and where some comparisons are made with a recent experimental work .",
    "a detailed treatment of grand ",
    "canonical simulations can be found in or via refs . @xcite ; the method outlined here has already been used in our previous studies of other lg models @xcite .",
    "simulations were carried out on periodically repeated samples , consisting of @xmath54 sites , where @xmath55 for @xmath7 , and @xmath56 for @xmath5 , i.e. in keeping with the named previous studies of ours ; calculations were carried out in cascade , in order of increasing reduced temperature @xmath57 .",
    "the two basic mc steps used here were canonical and semi  grand  canonical attempts ; in addition two other features were implemented @xcite : ( i ) when a lattice site was visited , canonical or semi  grand ",
    "canonical steps were randomly chosen with probabilities @xmath58 and @xmath59 , respectively ; we used @xmath60 , since spin orientation is defined by @xmath61 angles , versus one occupation number and ( ii ) sublattice sweeps ( checkerboard decomposition ) @xcite ; thus each sweep ( or cycle ) consisted of @xmath62 attempts , first @xmath63 attempts where the lattice sites was chosen randomly , then @xmath64 attempts on lattice sites of odd parity , and finally @xmath64 attempts on lattice sites of even parity .",
    "equilibration runs took between @xmath65 and @xmath66 cycles , and production runs took between @xmath67 and @xmath68 ; macrostep averages for evaluating statistical errors were taken over @xmath69 cycles .",
    "different random ",
    "number generators were used , as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "computed thermodynamic observables included mean hamiltonian per site , @xmath70 , density @xmath71 , as well as their derivatives with respect to temperature or chemical potential , @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 , defined by appropriate fluctuation formulae @xcite .",
    "we also calculated mean magnetic moment per site and susceptibility , defined by @xmath75 where for pr or he the vector @xmath76 is defined by @xmath77 whereas only the in  plane components of the vector spins ( i.e. only the cartesian components explicitly involved in the interaction potential ) are accounted for in the xy case .",
    "the behaviour of the susceptibility was investigated by considering the two quantities : @xmath78 and @xmath79 simulation estimates of the susceptibility @xcite are defined by @xmath80 notice also that , for a finite sample , @xmath81 , and that @xmath82 in two dimensional cases .",
    "a sample of @xmath63 sites contains @xmath83 distinct nearest  neighbouring pairs of lattice sites ; we worked out pair occupation probabilities , i.e. the mean fractions @xmath84 of pairs being both empty ( @xmath85 ) , both occupied ( @xmath86 ) , or consisting of an empty and an occupied site ( @xmath87 ) .",
    "it should be noted that @xmath88 .",
    "short and long  range positional correlations were compared by means of the excess quantities @xmath89 collectively denoted by @xmath90 ( notice that these two definitions entail comparable numerical values ) .",
    "quantities such as @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 and the above pair correlations @xmath84 or @xmath90 can be defined as `` fluid  like '' , in the sense that they all go over the trivial constants in the sl limit .",
    "let us also remark @xcite that some of the above definitions ( e.g. @xmath94 and @xmath92 ) involve the total potential energy both in the stochastic variable and in the probability measure ( `` explicit '' dependence ) , whereas some other definitions , e.g. @xmath93 or the quantities @xmath84 , involve the total potential energy only in the probability measure ( `` implicit '' dependence ) .",
    "simulation results , obtained in the named cases for a number of observables , such as the mean energy per site and density , showed that these quantities evolve with the temperature in a smooth way , and were found to be independent of sample sizes . in comparison with ref .",
    "@xcite , their temperature derivatives @xmath94 and @xmath92 ( fig .",
    "[ d2n2mu100der ] ) showed recognizably more pronounced peaks about the same temperature @xmath96 , around which the sample size dependence of results became slightly more pronounced .",
    "comparison with our previous results shows that the location of the maximum of @xmath97 is shifted towards lower temperatures as @xmath98 grows in magnitude .",
    "plots of @xmath99 versus @xmath57 , reported in fig .",
    "[ d2n2mu100susc ] , show results independent of sample size for @xmath100 , and then their pronounced increase with sample size for @xmath101 , suggesting its divergence with @xmath102 . in general this case",
    "_ qualitatively _ reproduces our previous simulation results @xcite , but with more pronounced derivatives and peaks at a lower temperature . in order to estimate the critical temperature we applied the finite size scaling analysis , along the lines discussed in reference @xcite , and here again we found a bkt transition occurring at @xmath103 , corresponding to a particle density about @xmath104 .",
    "comparison between our previous results and the present ones shows that both transition temperature and `` critical '' particle concentration are monotonically increasing with the chemical potential ( see table [ table01 ] ) .    [ cols=\"<,>,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     the susceptibility , actually @xmath105 , reported in fig .",
    "[ d3n2chi ] , showed a peak at a temperature about 0.792 , a strong sample size dependence below this temperature and no sensitivity to the sample sizes above it .",
    "the behaviours of the three derivatives @xmath106 ( not reported ) were found to be _ qualitatively _ similar to fig .",
    "[ d2n2mu150der ] ) .",
    "other fluidlike quantities such as @xmath84 ( fig [ d3n2pair ] ) and @xmath107 ( not reported here ) show how the density behaves when the three  dimensional pr lattice gas model exhibits a first order transition .",
    "these quantities are discontinuous at the transition temperature and follow the behaviour obtained for the density and the mean energy ; once more we witnessed the smallness of the excess quantities @xmath108 due to the absence of purely positional interaction .",
    "in general we remarked a pronounced qualitative similarity between the behaviours of the fluidlike quantities in the present case and those discussed in the previous subsection for 2d models .",
    "we have studied the critical properties of four lg models defined by @xmath109 and sufficiently large in magnitude , @xmath8 , plus an additional case ( @xmath7 , pr , @xmath9 ) .",
    "this allowed us to investigate the impact of the chemical potential on the nature of phase transition of these models and thus to gain insights into their phase diagrams .",
    "our simulations were performed in the absence of pure positional interaction .",
    "a number of thermodynamic quantities including some characteristics of fluid systems were estimated .",
    "it was found that the common feature of most cases is the onset of a first  order phase transition induced by the ferromagnetic interaction , and where an an abrupt change in the density of the system was observed .    in two  dimensions",
    "we have investigated both pr and xy models for @xmath8 . at this value of the chemical potential they showed different critical behaviours .",
    "pr exhibited a bkt phase transition , while xy showed a first order one .",
    "this might be a consequence of the fact that the two models entail different anchorings with respect to the horizontal plane in spin space .",
    "pr was further studied for @xmath9 , where evidence of a first order transition was found .",
    "the change of the nature of the phase transition from bkt to a discontinuous one agrees with previous rg predictions @xcite and rigorous mathematical results @xcite ; on the other hand , in recent simulation studies of quenched dilution it was found that the transition temperature vanishes below the percolation threshold @xcite .",
    "notice that usage of the grand ",
    "canonical ensemble allows quite wide changes of density with temperature .",
    "such changes are obviously excluded from the start in the treatment of a quenched  dilution model .",
    "thus , there are significant differences between both methods , yet the two resulting pictures are somehow compatible .",
    "phase transition and critical dynamics in site  diluted arrays of josephson junctions were recently studied experimentally in ref .",
    "@xcite ; according to the authors results , the bkt transition is altered by the introduction of percolative disorder far below the percolation threshold .",
    "furthermore , the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite found evidences of a non  bkt  type superconducting transition for strongly disordered samples , taking place at finite temperature .",
    "our results suggest that the transition in the named region becomes of first order .",
    "for the three dimensional models investigated here , i.e. pr and he , we found a first order phase transition form a ferromagnetic dense phase to a diluted paramagnetic one .",
    "the results obtained via simulation for @xmath8 were found to confirm those obtained by molecular field approximations used to construct the phase diagram of refs .",
    "@xcite , showing that the phase diagrams obtained there are qualitatively correct .",
    "the present calculations were carried out , on , among other machines , workstations belonging to the sezione di pavia of infn ( istituto nazionale di fisica nucleare ) .",
