    "although similar constructions have been carried out for other related groups , such as artin - tits groups of spherical type  @xcite , their generalisation in a more topological direction , to braid and mapping class groups of surfaces for example , remains a largely open problem , with the exception of a few results  @xcite .",

    "the group @xmath31 is defined abstractly in terms of its group presentation , and is chosen to satisfy certain technical homological constraints ( section @xmath32 of @xcite ) . an and ko prove a rigidity result for @xmath31 , which states intuitively that it is the ` best possible ' group that satisfies the constraints .",

    "this representation also has a homological interpretation ( see for instance  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 3 ) ) : the group @xmath4 acts on the infinite cyclic covering @xmath663 of @xmath6 , and since the action of @xmath4 on @xmath660 commutes with the length function @xmath664 ( whose image is @xmath513 ) , the induced action on the first homology group of @xmath663 is the ( reduced ) burau representation of @xmath4 .    more generally , if @xmath665 , @xmath4 , regarded as the mapping class group of @xmath6 , acts on @xmath666 and therefore on its fundamental group @xmath60 .",
    "once more , the induced action of @xmath4 on @xmath60 coincides with the action by conjugation of @xmath4 on @xmath60 defined by the standard section of  ( [ eq : sequence ] ) . in analogy with the case @xmath141 , in order to seek ( linear ) representations of @xmath60 , we consider regular coverings associated with its normal subgroups , and we try to see if the induced action on homology is well defined . in other words , we wish to study surjections of @xmath60 onto a group subject to certain constraints .",

    "however , if there existed @xmath77 such that @xmath676 for all @xmath677 , where @xmath678 denotes the automorphism of @xmath135 induced by conjugation by  @xmath679 , then the homomorphism @xmath77 would extend to a homomorphism from  @xmath82 to  @xmath17 because @xmath17 is abelian , and we would obtain a linear representation of @xmath27 in @xmath680}\\bigl(h_k^{\\text{bm } } \\bigl ( \\widetilde{e_{k}/{s_k } } \\bigr)\\bigr)$ ] , where @xmath681 is the borel - moore middle homology group of the covering space of @xmath682 and @xmath683 .",
