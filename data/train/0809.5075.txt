    "in @xcite , a two - variable polynomial invariant of finite quandles was introduced .",
    "this polynomial quantifies the way in which the trivial action of one quandle element on another is distributed throughout the quandle as opposed to concentrated in a single identity element as in a group .    in @xcite",
    "the quandle polynomial was generalized to a family of @xmath1 polynomials where @xmath2 is the least common multiple of the exponents of the columns of the quandle matrix considered as elements of of the symmetric group @xmath3 on the elements of the quandle .",
    "in both cases , the quandle polynomials were used to enhance the quandle counting invariants to obtain new invariants which specialize to the original quandle counting invariants but contain more information .    in this paper",
    "we study the natural generalization of quandle polynomials to finite racks .",
    "we are able to show that for at least one class of finite racks , the generalized rack polynomials determine the rack structure up to isomorphism , and we identify another class of quandles for which the generalized rack polynomials do not determine the isomorphism class .",
    "we then use these rack polynomials to enhance the rack counting invariants from @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ rrp ]",
    "we review the definitions of racks and rack polynomials and give some examples . in section [ grpcar ] we show that constant action racks are classified by their generalized rack polynomials . in section [ nsata ] we show that alexander quandles have quandle polynomial of the form @xmath0 and that unlike constant action racks , alexander quandles and other quandles with quandle polynomial @xmath0 are not classified by their generalized quandle polynomials . in section [ rpinv ]",
    "we define rack polynomial enhanced counting invariants . in section [ quest ] we collect some questions for future investigation .",
    "in @xcite , joyce defined a kind of self - distributive algebraic structure which he dubbed a `` quandle . '' in @xcite , quandles were generalized to a larger class of self - distributive algebraic systems known as `` racks . ''",
    "both concepts appear under other names in the literature such as `` distributive groupoids , '' `` automorphic sets '' and `` kei . ''",
    "see @xcite .    axiom ( i ) requires that each element @xmath4 of a rack @xmath5 acts on @xmath5 bijectively , while axiom ( ii ) requires these bijections to be automorphisms of the rack structure .",
    "the bijectivity of the action of @xmath4 gives us a right inverse action @xmath6 defined by @xmath7 where @xmath8 .",
    "the reader can check that @xmath9 is also a rack , called the _ dual _ of @xmath10    standard examples of rack and quandle structures include :    @xmath11    any union of conjugacy classes in a group @xmath12 with operation @xmath13 , @xmath14    the set of right cosets in a group @xmath12 of a subgroup @xmath15 ( not necessarily normal ) fixed by an automorphism @xmath16 with rack operation @xmath17    any set @xmath5 with a permutation @xmath18 with @xmath19 ( these are _ constant action racks _ or _ permutation racks _ )    the subset of a vector space @xmath20 on which a bilinear form @xmath21 with @xmath22 where @xmath23 is a non - zero scalar ( these are called _ coxeter racks _ ; see @xcite )    any module over @xmath24/s(1-t - s)$ ] with @xmath25 .",
    "racks of the last type in which @xmath26 are known as _",
    "alexander quandles_. a rack is _ abelian _ if for all @xmath27 we have @xmath28 in addition to being right - distributive , abelian quandles are also left - distributive , since we have @xmath29    a quandle is a _ crossed set _ ( see @xcite ) if we have @xmath30 the reader can check that alexander quandles are abelian and coxeter quandles ( set @xmath31 ) are crossed sets .",
    "we can express rack structures on a finite set @xmath32 in an algebra - agnostic way , i.e. without needing a formula for @xmath33 , by giving the rack operation table as a matrix @xmath34 whose @xmath35 entry is @xmath36 where @xmath37 .",

    "[ genrpofconstact ] let @xmath5 be the constant action rack of a given permutation @xmath48 on @xmath49 .",
    "then the generalized rack polynomial of @xmath5 is @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the number of @xmath52 such that @xmath53 and @xmath54 is the number of @xmath52 such that @xmath55 .    for any @xmath56",
    ", @xmath57 so each term of @xmath58 contains a factor of @xmath59 .",

    "therefore , @xmath67    note that the original `` non - generalized '' rack polynomial corresponds to @xmath68 . for this specific case , we have @xmath51 and @xmath54 both equal to the number of fixed points of @xmath48 , and",
    "so we have    [ rpofconstact ] let @xmath5 be the constant action rack of a given permutation @xmath48 on @xmath49 , and suppose @xmath48 has @xmath54 fixed points .",
    "then the rack polynomial of @xmath5 is @xmath69    [ rpcompleteinvariant ] the set of generalized rack polynomials is a complete invariant of constant action racks .    to prove this result",
    "we will need a pair of lemmas .",
    "[ isom = cycles ] suppose @xmath5 and @xmath70 are constant action racks given by permutations @xmath48 and @xmath71 , respectively",

    "suppose that @xmath5 and @xmath70 are isomorphic .",
    "then for any positive integer @xmath72 , @xmath73 and thus @xmath5 and @xmath70 must have the same number of cycles whose length divides @xmath72 . for @xmath74 ,",
    "this means that @xmath5 and @xmath70 have the same number of cycles of length @xmath75 .",
    "proceeding inductively , @xmath5 and @xmath70 have the same number of cycles of all positive integer lengths @xmath72 , and so have the same cycle structure .",
    "conversely , suppose that @xmath48 and @xmath71 have the same cycle structure , that is , we can write them as @xmath76 and @xmath77 let @xmath78 be the bijection given by @xmath79 .",
    "then @xmath80 and so @xmath23 is a rack isomorphism from @xmath5 to @xmath70 .",
    "[ rp = cycles ] suppose @xmath5 and @xmath70 are constant action racks given by the permutations @xmath48 and @xmath71 , respectively",
    ". then @xmath81 for all @xmath82 if and only if @xmath48 and @xmath71 have the same cycle structure .    by proposition [ genrpofconstact ] , if @xmath5 and @xmath70 are constant action racks of the same cardinality , then @xmath81 if and only if @xmath83 and @xmath84    if @xmath48 and @xmath71 have the same cycle structure , then they have the same number of elements in cycles whose length divides @xmath85 and the same number of elements in cycles whose length divides @xmath86 .",
    "thus , both and hold and so @xmath81 .",
    "if @xmath48 and @xmath71 do not have the same cycle structure , then there exists some minimal @xmath72 such that @xmath48 and @xmath71 do not have the same number of cycles of length @xmath72 .",
    "thus , for @xmath87 can not hold , and so @xmath88 .",
    "combining lemmas [ isom = cycles ] and [ rp = cycles ] immediately gives us proposition [ rpcompleteinvariant ] .",
    "the following example shows that the generalized rack polynomials must be used to get a complete invariant on constant action racks ; the @xmath89rack polynomial is not sufficient .",
    "in this section we study the quandle polynomials of alexander quandles .",
    "[ alex=>nsata ] let @xmath91 be an alexander quandle such that @xmath92 .",
    "then @xmath93 for some positive integer @xmath94 .",
    "let @xmath95 be the function given by @xmath96 since @xmath97 @xmath98 is just left multiplication by @xmath99 . since alexander quandles",
    "are abelian and thus left distributive , @xmath98 is automatically a homomorphism . by the first isomorphism theorem @xmath98 partitions @xmath91 into cosets by the congruence",
    "@xmath100 these cosets are all of size @xmath101 ; clearly @xmath94 .",
    "we will show that @xmath102 if and only if @xmath103 .",
    "suppose @xmath102 .",
    "then @xmath104 so @xmath105 and so @xmath103 .",
    "suppose @xmath103 .",
    "then @xmath106 implies @xmath107 and hence @xmath108    therefore , for any @xmath109 there are exactly @xmath51 choices of @xmath110 such that @xmath102 and also exactly @xmath51 choices of @xmath110 such that @xmath111 .",
    "thus , @xmath112 for all @xmath109 , and so @xmath113    note that proposition [ alex=>nsata ] provides a second , equivalent definition for @xmath114-equivalence",
    ".    [ cor7 ] an equivalent definition of @xmath39 is @xmath115 if and only if @xmath116 .",
    "this also gives us another proof of the fact noted in @xcite that    all alexander quandles are crossed sets .",
    "this follows immediately from corollary [ cor7 ] and the reflexivity of equivalence relations .",
    "these results suggest the possibility of defining @xmath39 for all crossed sets , or proving the converse of [ alex=>nsata ] .",
    "however , there is a counterexample to both of these natural conjectures .",
    "[ ce ] @xmath117    this also provides a counterexample to the conjecture in @xcite that distinct non - latin quandles are distinguished by at least one of their generalized rack polynomials .",
    "@xmath118 @xmath119 @xmath120",
    "in @xcite , the quandle counting invariant @xmath121 was extended to the case of finite non - quandle racks . in this section",
    "we will enhance this invariant with rack polynomials .",
    "we begin by recalling how this was done in the quandle case .",
    "@xmath122    the subquandle polynomials of the image subquandles in @xmath123 are used to enhance the quandle counting invariants in @xcite .",
    "specifically , instead of counting @xmath75 for each element of @xmath123 to obtain the quandle counting invariant @xmath121 , we count @xmath124 to obtain a multiset of subquandle polynomials .",
    "we can express these multisets in a polynomial - style form by writing the elements of the multiset as powers of a variable @xmath125 and the multiplicities as coefficients .",
    "let @xmath126 be a link and @xmath127 a finite quandle .",
    "the @xmath128_subquandle polynomial invariant _ of @xmath126 with respect to @xmath127 is then @xmath129    now , let @xmath126 be an oriented link with @xmath130 ordered components . for any diagram @xmath131 of @xmath126 , we can regard @xmath131 as a framed link using the blackboard framing , i.e. giving each component of @xmath126 a framing number @xmath132 equal to its self - writhe .",
    "thus , such a diagram has a framing vector @xmath133    for any finite rack @xmath127 , let @xmath134 be the _ rack rank _ of @xmath127 , i.e. the exponent of the permutation in @xmath135 along the diagonal of the rack matrix of @xmath127 .",
    "if two ambient isotopic diagrams of @xmath131 have writhe vectors which are componentwise congruent modulo @xmath134 , then there is a bijection @xmath136 between the sets of rack homomorphisms from the fundamental racks of @xmath137 and @xmath138 into @xmath127 defined by sending a coloring of one diagram to a coloring of the same diagram with @xmath139 kinks added . indeed ,",
    "since any subrack containing an element @xmath140 must also contain the rack powers @xmath141 for all @xmath14 ( see @xcite ) , @xmath142 preserves image subracks . hence , as far as @xmath127 is concerned , the framing vectors of @xmath131 live in @xmath143 , and we have an invariant of unframed links given by @xmath144 called the _ simple rack counting invariant_. a refinement obtained by keeping track of which colorings belong to which framings is the _ rack counting polynomial _ invariant latexmath:[\\[pr(l , t)=\\sum_{\\mathbf{w}\\in w } \\left (    @xmath127 is a quandle , @xmath146 and we have @xmath147 .",
    "see @xcite for more .",
    "we would like to jazz up these rack counting invariants with the generalized rack polynomials . to this end , we propose the following    @xmath148 @xmath149 @xmath150 @xmath151    specializing @xmath152 ( or , indeed , @xmath153 ) in the subrack polynomial @xmath154 yields the rack counting polynomial . since every finite quandle @xmath127 is a rack , the fact that subquandle polynomial invariants are stronger than unenhanced quandle counting invariants means _ a fortiori _ that subrack polynomial invariants are stronger than unenhanced rack counting invariants .",
    "the next example shows how subrack enhancement gives more information about a knot or link than the unadorned rack counting invariant .",
    "@xmath155\\ ] ]    indeed , the example suggests the following    if @xmath156 is a quandle and @xmath157 a knot , then the contributions to @xmath158 from @xmath159 are equal for all powers of @xmath160 .",
    "that is , @xmath154 includes the term @xmath161    quandle colorings do not depend on framing , so we get the same contribution , namely @xmath162 from each framing .",
    "we have shown that some classes of racks are classified by their generalized rack polynomials ( the constant action racks ) while others are not ( quandles with polynomial @xmath0 ) .",
    "what conditions are sufficient for a type of rack to be determined by its generalized rack polynomials ?    since @xmath0 quandles are not determined by their generalized quandle polynomials , what extra information is necessary to determine these quandles up to isomorphism ?",
    "how can such extra information be incorporated into the enhanced rack counting invariants ?    for every rack @xmath163 , the quotient rack under operator equivalence ( @xmath164 ) is a quandle .",
