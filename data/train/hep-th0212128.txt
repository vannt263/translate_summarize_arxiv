    "random matrix models @xcite ( @xcite for a review ) have attracted great amount of interest both due to its mathematical structure and for its manifold physical applications as well .",
    "when studying matrix models , one is especially interested in the solution of matrix models in the large @xmath2 approximation , which corresponds to the planar feynman diagrams @xcite .",
    "these models are characterized by the @xmath3 by @xmath3 matrix variable @xmath4 and by an hamiltonian @xmath5 after diagonalization of the matrix , one is able to work in the eigenvalue space , and to consider the following expression for the partition function : @xmath6 with @xmath7 or @xmath8 , depending on the symmetry .",
    "equivalently , from the perspective of random matrix theory one studies the joint probability distribution function for the @xmath3 eigenvalues of the matrix @xcite .",
    "it has the well - known general form :    @xmath9,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath10 and @xmath11 are named weight function and confining potential , respectively . if the elements of the random matrix are believed to be statistically independent from each other , one obtains the quadratic confinement potential @xmath12 , leading to the gaussian ensembles of random matrices @xcite . in the usual physical applications of matrix models",
    "@xcite , the confining potentials @xmath13 are such that the weight function @xmath14 $ ] is determined by the knowledge of all of its positive integer moments @xmath15 where @xmath16 in this paper , we want to study some general properties of matrix models with a weight function that does not satisfy this property .",
    "interestingly enough , a very particular model in this category shows considerable interest in the context of chern - simons theory @xcite and topological strings @xcite .",
    "we briefly remind now the formalism of orthogonal polynomials . recall that the relevant quantities , such as the density of states and the correlation functions , are obtained from the two - point kernel @xcite :    @xmath17    with @xmath18 , where @xmath19 are the orthogonal polynomials associated to the weight function @xmath20this is the fundamental object , due to the following classical result @xcite :    @xmath21 _ { q , p=1,2, ... ,n}.\\ ] ]    where the correlation functions are defined as :    @xmath22    for hermitian ensembles ( @xmath23 ) ,",
    "the density of states is the kernel at the origin :    @xmath24    the second expression follows when applying the christoffel - darboux formula @xcite . for gaussian ensembles for example",
    ", this quantity tends to the well - known semi - circle law in the limit @xmath25 @xcite . in this work",
    "we shall consider hermitian ensembles , and this expression for the density of states will be useful to understand relevant conceptual points in our discussion .",
    "as mentioned , we are concerned with the special properties of matrix models with an indeterminate weight function .",
    "our discussion is mainly based on the classical moment problem @xcite ( see @xcite for a recent review , that we will follow ) .",
    "the connection with random matrix theory can be readily guessed by the fact that only the moments play a role in the orthogonalization procedure .",
    "therefore the two sets , the moments and the orthogonal polynomials , are essentially equivalent .    the paper is organized as follows : in the next section , we give a short introduction to chern - simons theory and , focussing on these recent developments , we show how the matrix models in @xcite are directly related with an hermitian matrix model with a log - normal weight function . in this way , one can do exact computations through the associated orthogonal polynomials . to illustrate this , we compute the partition function of chern - simons theory on @xmath1 with gauge group @xmath26 interestingly enough , the use of @xmath0-deformed orthogonal polynomials readily leads to the natural parameter of chern - simons theory @xmath27 .",
    "therefore , the orthogonal polynomials approach is a method for non - perturbative solutions in chern - simons theory . in section 3 ,",
    "we show that there are actually infinitely many matrix models with the same partition function .",
    "finally , we show that this is a general feature of models with very weak confining potential . to conclude , we present a summary and possible directions for further research .",
    "we begin by outlining basic and well - known facts about chern - simons theory , emphasizing recent results and trends that connect chern - simons theory with matrix models @xcite . as it is well - known , chern - simons theory is a topological quantum field theory whose action is built out of a chern - simons term involving as gauge field a gauge connection associated to a group @xmath28 on a three - manifold @xmath4 .",
    "the action is : @xmath29 with @xmath30 an integer number .",
    "the natural associated observables are the correlators of wilson loops , and its main interest come from the fact that these correlators lead to quantum - group polynomial invariants of knots and links @xcite . for a review of the field since the seminal work @xcite ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "we mention now some few developments related to chern - simons theory . as advanced in @xcite ,",
    "chern - simons gauge theory has a string description in the sense of t hooft @xcite .",
    "indeed , as it is well - known , gauge theories with the @xmath31 group admit a large @xmath3 expansion . in these expansions ,",
    "correlators are expanded in powers of @xmath32 while keeping the t hooft coupling fixed @xmath33 , with @xmath34 the coupling constant of the gauge theory . in the case of chern - simons theory ,",
    "this large @xmath3 expansion is reminiscent of a string theory expansion .",
    "this connection between chern - simons and topological strings was first pointed out by witten @xcite and has been extended in @xcite .",
    "for example , in @xcite it is shown that if one wraps @xmath3 @xmath35-branes on @xmath4 in @xmath36 , then the associated topological a - model is a @xmath37 chern - simons theory on the three manifold @xmath4 .",
    "on the other hand , regarding matrix models , in @xcite it was already pointed out that the structure of the partition function of chern - simons theory on @xmath38 with gauge group @xmath39 resembles the usual expression for the partition function of a one matrix model in terms of its associated orthogonal polynomials . moreover , in @xcite , it is shown that the partition function of chern - simons theory on @xmath1 and with gauge group @xmath37 , is given by :    @xmath40    that describes open topological @xmath41 strings on @xmath42 with @xmath3 branes wrapping @xmath1 ( see the details in @xcite ) .",
    "these type of models have been further considered in @xcite . in @xcite",
    ", it was shown that topological strings for @xmath43-branes are equivalent to hermitian matrix models , then the idea in @xcite is to obtain the results in @xcite , by applying mirror symmetry to obtain @xmath43-brane matrix models .",
    "we will comment further on the results in @xcite later on .",
    "now , we mainly focus on the study of @xmath44 . for recent reviews along these lines see @xcite .",
    "we remind that , as usual in chern - simons theory , the string coupling constant @xmath45 is related with the @xmath30 in @xmath46 by : @xmath47 as explained in @xcite , the limit of the parameter @xmath48 lead to the usual gaussian unitary ensemble .",
    "one can argue , for example , that in this limit , the gaussian becomes a dirac delta function , and therefore the results are independent of the correlation factor , or level repulsion . in @xcite , this model",
    "is essentially studied through the consideration of averages ( in a gaussian unitary ensemble ) of the following quantities :    @xmath49    this method leads to a great amount of perturbative information .",
    "nevertheless , we note that the connection with the usual hermitian matrix models -that is , of the type given by @xmath50 - is much simpler .",
    "let us consider the following simple change of variables : @xmath51 then , @xmath44 , reads :    @xmath52    the factor @xmath53 can be readily absorbed by considering a simple but remarkable property of the log - normal function @xmath54    @xmath55    note that this functional equation is just a particular case of the following elementary identity : @xmath56    therefore , the chern - simons matrix model is directly related to an ordinary hermitian ensemble with log - normal weight function @xmath57 equivalently , one could have used the change of variables @xmath58 .",
    "notice that the term @xmath59 is necessary to cancel , together with the term coming from the jacobian , the contribution @xmath60 actually , this method was already employed in @xcite , where the same matrix model seems to appear in a very different context .",
    "one of our goals is to make contact between this model and chern - simons theory .",
    "as we shall see , this will comes out rather easily , due to the existence of a closed system of orthogonal polynomials associated to the log - normal weight .",
    "these polynomials are @xmath0-deformed polynomials known as stieltjes - wigert polynomials @xcite .",
    "this opens the possibility of a complete solution for the model @xmath44 of @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , using the classical results for hermitian ensembles and these polynomials .",
    "secondly , we shall show -giving explicit examples- that there exists infinitely many matrix models -deformations of @xmath61- with exactly the same ( chern - simons ) partition function .      using the previous results and the stieltjes - wigert orthogonal polynomials @xcite",
    ", we can find a complete solution of the matrix model considered in @xcite , and , in particular , for the partition function .",
    "for this , we can use the following well - known result for the partition function in terms of the orthogonal polynomials @xcite : @xmath62 where the coefficient @xmath63 is : @xmath64    the first step is to compute the @xmath65 associated to the stieltjes - wigert orthogonal polynomials .",
    "the coefficients are given by @xcite :    @xmath66    then @xmath67 and @xmath68 therefore : @xmath69 but we are interested in :    @xmath70    making the identification @xmath71 , and therefore @xmath72 .",
    "it is remarkable that we have naturally obtained , from this @xmath0 deformed orthogonal polynomials , the usual @xmath0 parameter in chern - simons theory .",
    "the partition function with the usual stieltjes - wigert weight , corresponds to : @xmath73 therefore : @xmath74 to make explicit contact with the typical expressions for the chern - simons partition functions ( as in @xcite for example ) we make some transformations on the product term .",
    "@xmath75    the final expression for the partition function is @xcite : @xmath76 and since @xmath77 , we finally find : @xmath78    it was already mentioned in @xcite , that the structure of the partition function resembled very much the general expression for the partition function of a one matrix model in terms of the associated orthogonal polynomials . here ,",
    "based on the result in @xcite , we are making this statement precise through the explicit computation . notice that the differences between the @xmath31 and @xmath37 comes essentially from the contribution of the partition function of @xmath79 ( see , for example , the first reference in @xcite for more details ) .",
    "in this second part we shall show that the matrix models involved that appear in chern - simons theory present a novelty in comparison with most of known matrix models ( like the ones that are relevant in 2d quantum gravity ) . broadly speaking ,",
    "its weight function is so broad that there is a non - uniqueness issue that leads to very practical and concrete results for the matrix model : there are infinitely many models with identical properties .",
    "in particular , identical ( chern - simons ) partition function .",
    "we begin by briefly reviewing some introductory results in the theory of the moment problem .",
    "the two basic moment problems are @xcite :      given a sequence of reals @xmath80 , when is there a measure , @xmath81 on @xmath82 so that @xmath83 and if such measure exists , is it unique ?      given a sequence of reals @xmath80 , when is there a measure , @xmath81 on @xmath84 so that @xmath85 and if such measure exists , is it unique ?    in our case , we are not concerned with the question regarding existence , since we always refer to the weight function @xmath10 and its associated moments .",
    "then , the main point is to know whether we are in the determinate or indeterminate case . to fix ideas ,",
    "let us mention that there is a natural boundary for functions of the form @xmath86 with @xmath11 of polynomial form . in the hamburger case , the boundary is given by @xmath87 with @xmath88 , while in the stieltjes case it is given by @xmath87 with @xmath89 .",
    "then , in the usual matrix models considered ( as reviewed in @xcite for example ) , one is essentially always in the determined case .",
    "consider now the following generalization of the log - normal weight :    @xmath90 .",
    "\\label{sti}\\ ] ]    the moments of this function are @xcite : @xmath91 note that all the integer moments are completely independent of the parameter @xmath92 .",
    "this means that all the functions in the family @xmath93 have the same moments .",
    "thus , they are all undetermined by them .",
    "conversely , one can say that the set of moments @xmath94 is an indeterminate set .",
    "we present now a detailed consideration of this family of functions .",
    "the main point is the computation of its mellin transform .",
    "first , note that for @xmath95 we have the log - normal distribution @xmath96 its mellin transform is : @xmath97 = \\mathrm{e}^{\\pi ^{2}/4}\\mathrm{erf}\\left ( -\\frac{s}{2}\\right ) .\\ ] ] the other part of the stieltjes function is @xmath98 .",
    "from @xmath99 we know that all of its integer moments are zero .",
    "the most enlightening possibility is to compute its mellin transform :    ]    @xmath100    we use the change of variables @xmath101 the integral becomes : @xmath102 dy \\\\ & = & \\sqrt{\\pi } \\mathrm{e}^{\\frac{1}{4}\\left ( s^{2}+1\\right ) } \\sin \\left ( \\pi \\left ( 1+s\\right ) \\right ) .",
    "\\notag\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the change of variables is the one employed by stieltjes @xcite , with a generic , complex @xmath103 instead of an integer @xmath30 . clearly , after the change of variables , since @xmath104 is a periodic and odd function , its value is zero at @xmath105 nevertheless , the result is even clearer when looking at the full mellin transform : the contribution of the additional function is zero only for integer values of @xmath106    as a consequence , for example , we have that any of the following functions have the same integer moments .    ]     ( solid ) and @xmath107 ( dashed ) ]    consequently , it is manifest now that there are infinitely many matrix models with exactly the same partition function .",
    "therefore , it turns out that the partition function of @xmath108 chern - simons theory on @xmath1 can be given by an infinitely many different matrix models . from what we have seen ,",
    "one possibility is :    @xmath109    as always , with @xmath110 .$ ] notice that due to the correspondence between @xmath111 and @xmath112 through @xmath113 , the density of states of @xmath114 does _ not _ satisfy the property : @xmath115 ( that is , the moments are different for each matrix model ) .",
    "but rather : @xmath116    to extract further physical consequences of these results and its implications for the connection between matrix models and topological quantum field theories seems an interesting open question .",
    "in this concluding section we show that the properties exhibited by the chern - simons matrix model are typical of models with weakly confining -_soft_- potentials .",
    "the mathematically precise description is that the potential is such that @xmath117 is a function that is not determined by its moments .",
    "this feature has already been discussed in the context of random matrix theory and also in the particular case of @xmath0-deformed matrix models @xcite . in this last case ,",
    "the one we are mainly interested , the non - uniqueness is strong since the potentials are asymptotically @xmath118 for @xmath119 @xcite and we have already mentioned that we are in the soft regime when the confinement provided by the potential is weaker than @xmath120 .    employing basic results on indeterminate functions @xmath121 and the classical random matrix formulae , one can prove that the density of states of a matrix model is an indeterminate function if its weight function is indeterminate by its moments .",
    "this can be readily shown if we consider the expression for the density of states ( for any @xmath3 ) @xmath122 and krein proposition @xcite , that essentially says that if @xmath123 is convergent , then the corresponding moment problem is undetermined .",
    "an analogous case holds for the stieltjes case .    from @xmath122",
    "we have : @xmath124 with @xmath125 a polynomial .",
    "we write the expression in the second way , to emphasize that we just have the addition of a polynomial term . then : @xmath126 and @xmath127 therefore , the convergence or divergence of @xmath128 and @xmath129 is exclusively given by the convergence or divergence of @xmath130 and @xmath131 respectively . then , taking into account krein proposition , it turns out that the matrix models characterized by an indeterminate weight function , have different ( but indeterminate ) density of states but the same partition function .",
    "thus , we have seen that the density of states is an indeterminate function .",
    "let us show explicitly that their moments are all equal : @xmath132 that is clearly @xmath133 dependent and the moments : @xmath134 are @xmath135independent , since the polynomial @xmath136 is always the same and then we are lead to a sum of moments of the indeterminate function @xmath137 , each one of them @xmath135independent .",
    "now , we can show that the partition functions are identical .",
    "we use the following expression : @xmath138 that is , the partition function as the @xmath139-moment of the density of states .",
    "alternatively , the usual expression for the partition function in terms of the orthogonal polynomials can be used @xcite : @xmath140 where @xmath63 are the following coefficients of the associated orthogonal polynomials : @xmath141 this expression is valid for any weight function and only depends on the associated orthogonal polynomials , that are the same for any @xmath142    then , for example , all matrix models with the weight functions @xmath143 , have the same orthogonal polynomials ( essentially the stieltjes - wigert @xcite , see above ) .",
    "nevertheless , it is plain that each one will have a different density of states , since we have a different weight function ( as we have seen in the previous figures ) .    in any case",
    ", it is clear that approaching matrix models only from the perspective of orthogonal polynomials , there is no a priori reason to choose the log - normal weight , since any member of the infinite family has identical orthogonal polynomials .",
    "furthermore , the family of functions above discussed is by no means the only one . from our analysis with the mellin transform ,",
    "is clear that many other functions instead of @xmath104 , can lead to the same phenomena .",
    "in addition , examples such as @xcite : @xmath144 can be relatively easily found in the literature .",
    "this weight function also leads to the stieltjes - wigert polynomials , that are actually terminating basic hypergeometric series and have intimate relationships with theta functions @xcite . in this work",
    ", we have discovered their remarkable connection with chern - simons theory and quantum topological invariants . in general , it turns out that the set @xmath145 of solutions to an indeterminate moment problem contains very different types of measures : measures @xmath146 with a @xmath147density , discrete measures and measures which are continuous singular @xcite",
    ". explicit cases of these last types are found in @xcite .",
    "we have seen that the matrix models that appear in chern - simons theory are exactly solvable and that have many interesting properties , which are novel in comparison with the matrix models that appear in 2d quantum gravity .",
    "therefore , the orthogonal polynomials technique constitute an interesting non - perturbative method .",
    "we have checked this for the simple case of @xmath1 and gauge group @xmath37 and , interestingly enough , the use of @xmath0-deformed orthogonal polynomials readily leads to the usual parameter of chern - simons theory .",
    "it seems feasible , and certainly an interesting task , to try to extend this result to other geometries -like lens spaces- and to other gauge groups as well @xcite .    on the other hand , the non - uniqueness property that we have established does not only seem to be interesting from a mathematical perspective , but it may have some physical meaning as well .",
    "we have emphasized the fact that the original chern - simons matrix model can be deformed in infinitely many ways , leaving the partition function always unmodified .",
    "since this is a chern - simons partition function , we know it is a topological invariant .",
    "a well - known result in topology says that the topological invariant of a three - manifold is independent of the triangulation employed to compute the invariant .",
    "thus , one is tempted to try to interpret all these matrix models as representing different triangulations of the manifold .",
    "thus , in a sense , it would be interesting to try to obtain an analogous interpretation to the role of more ordinary matrix models in 2d quantum gravity , but in three dimensions .",
    "this is a bit speculative line of research , but it may still be worth . in any case , the non - uniqueness properties are a distinctive mathematical feature of the models and the way the it appears seems also rather interesting in itself , since the resulting logarithmic oscillations are quite typical of physical models where a quantum group structure is present",
