    "the intensity of the cosmic near - infrared background ( irb ) is a measure of the total light emitted by stars and galaxies in the universe . while the absolute background has been estimated by space - based experiments , such as the diffuse infrared background experiment ( dirbe ; hauser & dwek 2001 ) and the infra - red telescope in space ( irts ; matsumoto et al .",
    "2005 ) , the total irb intensity measured still remains fully unaccounted for by sources : only 13.5 @xmath11 4.2 nw m@xmath12 sr@xmath13 is resolved to point sources at 1.25 @xmath0 m ( cambrsy et al .",
    "2001 ) , while current direct measurements range from 25 - 70 nw m@xmath12 sr@xmath13 . at wavelengths greater than 3 @xmath0 m , with a total irb intensity of 12.4 @xmath11 3.2 nw m@xmath12 sr@xmath13 ( wright & reese 2000 ) at 3.6 @xmath0 m , the `` missing source '' problem is less significant with 5.4 nw m@xmath12 sr@xmath13 resolved to point sources in _",
    "data ( fazio et al . 2004a ; franceschini et al .",
    "2006 ) , while fluctuation analyses of _ spitzer _ data yield 10.6@xmath14 nw m@xmath12 sr@xmath13 ( savage & oliver 2005 ) .",
    "we refer the reader to kashlinsky ( 2005 ) for a recent review on the irb including a summary of past attempts to understand the intensity excess relative to the background predicted by resolved source number counts .",
    "primordial galaxies at redshifts 8 and higher , especially those involving population iii stars , are generally invoked to explain the missing ir flux between 1 @xmath0 m and 2 @xmath0 m , with most of the intensity associated with redshifted lyman-@xmath15 emission during reionization ( e.g. , santos , bromm & kamionkowski 2002 ; salvaterra & ferrara 2003 ; cooray & yoshida 2004 ; fernandez & komatsu 2006 ) . while models of high - redshift pop iii populations can explain the `` missing '' irb , these models run into several difficulties if such sources were to account for all of the missing ir intensity .",
    "these include the high efficiency required to convert baryons to stars in first galaxies ( e.g. , madau & silk 2005 ) and limits from deep ir imaging data that suggest a lack of a large population of high - redshift dropouts ( salvaterra & ferrara 2006 ) . the recently revised optical depth to reionization ( page et al .",
    "2006 ) , with reionization around a redshift of 10 instead of the previous estimates of 20 , decreases the number density of first sources that are required for reionization . in return , the implied fractional contribution from first sources to the total intensity of the irb is lowered .",
    "still , one does expect some contribution to the irb from sources that reionized the universe , though the exact intensity of the irb from such sources is yet unknown both theoretically and observationally . as pointed out in cooray et al .",
    "( 2004 ; also , kashlinsky et al . 2004 ) , if a high - redshift population contributes significantly to the irb , then these sources are expected to leave a distinct signal in the anisotropy fluctuations of the near - ir intensity , when compared to the anisotropy spectrum associated with low - redshift sources .",
    "using results from a fluctuation analysis in deep _ spitzer _ imaging data with resolved point sources removed from the image down to a deeper magnitude than previous studies on this topic , kashlinsky et al .",
    "( 2005 ) claimed a potential detection of the clustering signature of high - redshift sources at wavelengths of 3.6 , 4.5 , and 5.8 @xmath0 m .",
    "a previous attempt to understand the nature of this excess clustering in _ spitzer _ data , when resolved sources are removed down to a magnitude level of 22.5 in the @xmath1-band , suggested that it could be the clustering signature of galaxies at redshifts greater than 5 , with a total contribution to the irb at the level of @xmath16 1 to 2 nw m@xmath12 sr@xmath13 in the @xmath1-band ( salvaterra et al .",
    "2006 ) ; at shorter wavelengths , the intensity of this background remains uncertain as the spectrum of this excess fluctuation component is only established with _ spitzer _ for @xmath17 3.6 @xmath0 m . while this suggestion was simply based on a model description of the fluctuation spectrum , whether such a scenario is consistent with faint source counts in deep _ spitzer _",
    "images is yet to be considered .",
    "if the 1 to 2 @xmath0 m irb is not fully resolved by extragalactic sources , then it could be that most of the missing source problem is due to deficiencies in accounting for the zodiacal light ( dwek , arendt & krennrich 2005 )",
    ". this possibility may be further consistent with some suggestions that , subject to a priori assumptions on their intrinsic spectral shape , the observed blazar tev spectra rule out a significant irb from extragalactic sources ( e.g. , aharonian et al . 2006 ) . while the point source photometry may underestimate the total ir flux in each resolved source by missing the outer regions when constructing source catalogs , it is unlikely that this effect alone can explain the factor of 2 to 3 difference between predicted and measured irb intensity given that point source photometry is unlikely to miss more than 5% to 10% of the total flux ( see totani et al .",
    "2001 for a discussion ) .",
    "such a small residual , however , could produce an excess in fluctuations of the irb , with the angular spectrum tracing that of the bright resolved sources .    to separate various possibilities related to the nature of intensity as well as anisotropy excesses , further analyses of near - ir background data is required .",
    "if the excess background is due to missing flux in low - z galaxies , then one would expect fluctuations in the background to strongly correlate with resolved point sources .",
    "the contribution from zodiacal light is known only to within an upper limit , but if residual zodiacal light is the reason , then spatial clustering of the irb will peak at degree or more angular scales due to its smoothness .",
    "thus , to distinguish between these possibilities , it is necessary to further understand spatial clustering at irb wavelengths . here , we concentrate on the fluctuations in irb due to resolved sources .",
    "we study both the shape and the amplitude of the angular power spectrum and use these measurements to make a relative comparison between resolved and unresolved irb clustering , with the latter from measurements in kashlinsky et al .",
    "we also connect our clustering measurements with faint number counts and an underlying halo model of the ir galaxy distribution within the large - scale structure to study if faint galaxies could be responsible for the irb fluctuations seen with _",
    "spitzer_.    in this paper , we make clustering measurements at 3.6 @xmath0 m in the great observatories origins deep survey ( goods ; dickinson et al . 2003 ) hdf - n field , the goods cdf - s field , and the noao deep wide - field survey ( ndwfs ; jannuzi & dey 1999 ) botes field with the source sample divided into several magnitude bins in each of these catalogs .",

    "( 2002 ) , fourier or multipole - space measurements should be preferred over the real space due to the simple behavior of the covariance matrix and the fact that multipole - space measurements can be easily related to the underlying three - dimensional power spectrum without a complex window function that maps fluctuations in fourier space to that of the angular space . in the case of the real space correlation function ,",
    "clustering at different angular scales are also correlated ( eisenstein & zaldarriaga 2001 ) and this also lead to a complex covariance matrix that must be accounted for when model fitting the measurements .    despite these considerations , real - space clustering measurements are easy to make and have been studied in the literature at 3.6 @xmath0 m and other _ spitzer _",

    ", using the botes - field irac shallow survey over 6 deg.@xmath19 , we find a departure from the power - law description and model that departure in terms of the halo model for galaxy clustering ( cooray & sheth 2002 ) . a departure from a power - law description , however , is not surprising for galaxy clustering at high redshifts due to non - linear clustering at angular scales less than a few arcminutes ( ouchi et al .",

    "the _ spitzer _ botes field covers a total area close to 8.5 deg.@xmath19 , but due to non - uniform coverage and to avoid introducing a complicated window function for clustering measurements in the multipole space , we restrict the discussion to the central 6.3 deg.@xmath19 here . while ground - based flamex imaging data of the botes field cover a total area of almost 7 deg.@xmath19 , again due to gaps in the data , we concentrate on 3.9 deg.@xmath19 with uniform coverage at the center of the field .    to understand the extent to which botes field imaging is complete , we performed standard simulations by placing ten thousand artificial point sources randomly across the botes mosaic in each 0.2 magnitude bin .",
    "we perform object detection and extraction exactly as we had carried out with the original survey catalog as described in eisenhardt et al .",
    "we quantify completeness as the recovered fraction of point sources in each magnitude bin .",

    "the irac shallow survey is over 85% complete . due to completeness and to avoid systematic biases from stellar sources in the galaxy that dominate at magnitudes below 15 ( see , fazio et al .",

    "this is the completeness correction factor that we use for the goods cdf - s and hdf - n catalogs .",
    "here , we make use of two types of surveys : the botes field provides us with a shallow , wide - field image to measure clustering out to degree angular scales for bright sources ( down to a magnitude limit of 19 in the @xmath1-band ) , while the goods hdf - n and the goods cdf - s _ spitzer _ images allow us to measure clustering of resolved sources at 10 arcminute angular scales and below down to a very deep magnitude limit . in combination ,",
    "the botes image allows us to measure clustering from degree scales to sub - arcminute scales for bright galaxies and goods catalogs allow clustering measurements of resolved sources down to the faintest level of 22.5 in @xmath1-band .",
    "this is at the magnitude level at which resolved sources were removed from the fluctuation analysis in kashlinsky et al .",
    "thus , clustering studies with the two fields , in return , allow us to establish the confusion level when making measurements related to the unresolved diffuse component and to understand if the fluctuations detected by kashlinsky et al .",

    "the total intensity of botes source counts between 17 and 19 magnitudes increases to 2.1 nw m@xmath12 sr@xmath13 when counts are corrected for completeness . in combination",

    "( 2005 ) , though such a slope is suggested in the study of the one - point distribution function of the unresolved flux by savage & oliver ( 2005 ) .",

    "compared to the total intensity of about 12 nw m@xmath12 sr@xmath13 , we find that resolved source counts and unresolved background clustering explain about 55% of the background for extragalactic sources , which is consistent with the resolved fraction in fazio et al .",
    "( 2004a ) , but lower than the resolved fraction suggested in savage & oliver ( 2005 ) .",
    "the photometric redshift distribution for galaxies with magnitudes between 17 and 19 in 3.6@xmath0 m is computed as described in brodwin et al .",

    ", we determined that the fractional contribution to the clustering power spectrum from galaxies at redshifts greater than 2 with magnitudes between 17 and 19 in @xmath1-band is below a few percent at the angular scales probed by botes and goods catalogs .",
    "thus , with a clear peak of the redshift distribution at @xmath36 , we can easily interpret parameters extracted from galaxy clustering as those related to sources at this redshift instead of accounting for the corrections coming from the high - redshift tail of the redshift distribution .",
    "furthermore , while not exact in terms of selection criteria or observing wavelengths , the redshift distribution for the bright ir galaxy sample between 17 and 19 magnitudes in the @xmath1-band is similar to the galaxy redshift distribution in the high - redshift end of the deep2 survey .",
    "thus , our statistical results on quantities such as the halo mass hosting ir galaxies can be compared with those established based on the deep2 clustering measurements ( coil et al .",
    "in the right panel of figure  3 we show the redshift distributions of @xmath3-band galaxies with magnitudes between 17 and 19 and between 19 and 21 , as estimated photometrically .",
    "these again peak at @xmath37 and we use them when model fitting the clustering measurements in the @xmath3-band with source catalogs generated by the flamex survey .",
    "the measurement of galaxy clustering in the multipole space is now well described in the literature with a wide range of applications with data from several large - scale structure surveys .",
    "these techniques borrow from ideas that have been developed for clustering measurements in the multipole space in cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropy maps . in general",
    ", the available techniques fall into two approaches .",
    "first , starting from a technique described in peebles ( 1973 ) , clustering can be derived either through spherical harmonic estimation with moments calculated by summing over all pixels .",
    "the second approach is to apply a maximum likelihood method to data to estimate the power spectrum directly , especially when data involve large numbers of pixels where direct computation of spherical transforms is computationally time consuming ( e.g. , tegmark et al .",
    "2002 ) . here , we make use of the former approach given the small area of our surveys and the ability to directly estimate the transform .    to begin , in each catalog , the source count distributions were fit to a fine grid of pixel size 1.8  for botes and 0.7  for goods , with each pixel @xmath32 in the grid containing the sum of the flux of all the sources contained within it , @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the two - dimensional angular vector on the sky . in comparison to usual clustering measurements of the galaxy distribution , @xmath38 is not just the number of galaxies in each pixel , but rather the total irb intensity in that pixel given the magnitude of that galaxy .",
    "note that we put all flux within the pixel at the source center and do not account for the large irac psf . while this procedure ignores the spatial structure of individual sources ,",
    "since we are measuring large - scale clustering between sources rather than small - scale clustering at spatial scales below a typical source size , this is not a concern for us for this study .",
    "it would , however , be a concern when studying clustering in the unresolved background ( section  6.2 ) .    in summary , to extract @xmath40 , we expand the @xmath38 as @xmath41 where @xmath42 are the spherical harmonic functions . in principle ,",
    "if data exists over the whole sphere , angular power spectrum is simply @xmath43 \\ , , \\ ] ] where the factor @xmath44 comes from the fact that at each multipole @xmath45 , there are @xmath44 independent modes . in above",
    ", @xmath46 arises from the discrete behavior of the two dimensional intensity field ( see below ) and acts as a source of noise for clustering measurements with a finite density of sources ( peebles 1973 ) and this shot - noise can be written as @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the surface density of sources at flux @xmath49 , assuming all counts are extracted with no confusion .    in practice , however , one must correct clustering measurements for the incomplete sky coverage through an appropriate renormalization of the harmonics . following peebles ( 1973 ) , for partial sky coverage , we can write an estimate for the angular power spectrum as @xmath50\\ , , \\ ] ] where the two functions @xmath51 and @xmath52 are @xmath53 and @xmath54 , respectively , and the angular integrals are over the area of the survey .",
    "while in the all - sky case , estimates of @xmath40 at each multipole @xmath45 is independent of each other , with partial sky coverage , adjacent estimates are correlated .",
    "thus , one can not represent the power spectrum with estimates at each @xmath55 . to decrease the correlations ,",
    "we average adjacent @xmath56 estimates over bins @xmath57 in the multipole space such that @xmath57 is taken to be logarithmically dependent on central multipole or @xmath58 , with @xmath59 is fixed at the level of 0.2 . with such large bins , using the window function in multipole space , @xmath60 , we have established that the power spectrum estimates are correlated at a level below a few percent and we neglect these correlations in our model fitting analysis .",
    "while not pursued here due to simple survey geometry and the small area used for clustering measurements , the above procedure can be optimized further to quickly calculate harmonic transforms over large areas on the sky using specially designed pixelization schemes that have been developed for cmb anisotropy studies ( e.g. , healpix ; gorski et al .",
    "2005 ) and pseudo-@xmath56 estimates ( e.g. , wandelt et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "as described earlier , to avoid complicating the clustering measurement with images that have large gaps in the source distribution and a complex window function @xmath61 , we chose a smaller , central area within the botes field of 6.3 square degrees with irac catalogs and a 3.9 square degrees field in ground - based images .",
    "such a selection also guarantees that our clustering measurements are not affected by problems at the edge of the field and that we do not need to decorrelate the measurements for the complex geometry . for the pixel sizes used , based on a monte carlo simulation",
    ", we have established that the contribution to the power spectrum from overlapping sources was negligible .",
    "however , our grid has empty pixels due to masking of bright sources or no data ( e.g. , muxbleed contamination ) which we describe through a mask and such empty pixels can not be avoided since they occur throughout the field . to avoid introducing complications to the power spectrum measurement",
    ", we filled those random empty pixels with white noise before estimating the power spectrum , where the white noise was estimated using the same procedure as the boot - strap approach outlined below to establish errors for binned @xmath40 . to test the extent to which such a procedure can affect our clustering measurements",
    ", we utilized a monte - carlo approach by systematically masking out different regions that were not contaminated or , instead of adding simple white noise distributed as a gaussian , replacing the contaminated regions with poisson noise .",
    "we found that clustering measurements do not vary beyond the error indicated and that large - scale clustering is unaffected by contaminated pixels .",
    "as outlined above our clustering measurements lead to an estimation of the total power spectrum , which includes both the shot - noise component , associated with the poisson - noise or discreetness of the source counts , and the clustering component , associated with the true spatial distribution .",
    "the latter is the component that is of interest to large - scale structure studies and , as outlined above , one must remove the shot - noise component .",
    "there are two approaches to estimate the shot - noise .",
    "first , one can simply measure the total power spectrum including the shot - noise and then account for the shot - noise part of the spectrum , @xmath62 , by measuring the amplitude of clustering , that will scale simply as @xmath63 when plotted in terms of @xmath64 or as a constant is simply considered as @xmath56 , at large @xmath55 values .",
    "this assumes that at large @xmath55 values or small angular scales , clustering is dominated by pure noise .",
    "since noise for our measurement is simply the shot - noise , this amplitude can be taken to be the shot - noise and that constant value can be removed from the total spectrum @xmath56 .",
    "the second approach is to use the information related to existing number counts and simply do the integral @xmath65 to estimate the expected shot - noise , since this is also a correct description of the shot - noise . in practice",
    ", we have found that the shot - noise component is more accurately measured using the amplitude of the total power spectrum at smallest angular scales probed by the data just before the finite size of pixels become important than simply evaluating the integral over the number counts in the magnitude range for which clustering measurements are made .",
    "this is due to the incompleteness in our measured number counts as we now describe .    to understand this ,",
    "our clustering spectrum is estimated from the irb intensity captured by individual sources with the image pixelized in terms of flux .",
    "incompleteness in the point source detection catalog leads to a systematic underestimate of the flux in certain pixels .",
    "in addition to incompleteness , our clustering spectrum is also affected by stellar sources that were not removed in the original catalog . in this case",
    "we may be overestimating the clustering amplitude from contamination related to stellar flux .",
    "thus , in addition to incompleteness of the sky coverage which is easy to correct for once the geometry of the survey area is specified , we use a two - step approach to correct for the angular power spectrum of galaxies in each of the magnitude bins .",
    "first , our clustering measurements are corrected to account for incompleteness in the catalogs . using the difference between @xmath65 for completeness",
    "corrected counts and the one estimated directly from clustering data that is an underestimate of the total shot - noise , we correct the shot - noise and clustering power - spectra as @xmath66 ^ 2 \\ , .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] when making these corrections to the overall amplitude we are assuming that incompleteness affects the field uniformly and that incompleteness correction has no angular structure . in optical surveys , incompleteness can be related to extinction and for large are surveys such as sdss that span over 1000 deg.@xmath19 or more , extinction varies across the field significantly and these angular variations must be accounted for . for the present study involving ir galaxy clustering at angular scales of a few degree and below , such complex corrections can be safely ignored .",
    "the completeness corrected counts in figure  1 left panel results in a 18% increase in the shot - noise , which if not accounted for leads to an underestimate of power at small angular scales . at arcminute scales",
    "where clustering measurements from the botes field overlap with the goods , we find good agreement between the measurements from these two fields when botes clustering measurements are corrected for completeness issues . while it is not necessary to correct for completeness in the goods fields between magnitudes of 17 and 19 in the @xmath1-band , for clustering measurements in fainter bins , we make use of the completeness calculations to correct for the shot - noise and the amplitude .",
    "since we did not correct the catalogs for potential contamination from stars , the shot - noise contains an additional contribution from the stellar counts in addition to galaxies whose clustering we are attempting to measure . to correct for the shot - noise associated with stars",

    "the stellar shot - noise is 6% and 10% of the original total shot - noise for the two fields and is a small , though non - negligible , correction to the angular power spectrum .",
    "we show both cases when presenting our clustering measurements to highlight the small difference , which is only important at arcminute and smaller angular scales .",

    ", this is the best we can do at this stage .",
    "the mass scale we estimate for galaxies at @xmath113 of 1 can be compared to previous estimates in the literature .",

    "( 2005 ) is correct , then these sources are unlikely to be a significant fraction of the total irb intensity at 3.6 microns . if sources were to continue with the large positive slope to the faint - end , then the background between magnitude limits of 22.5 and 30 would have been close to 1.2 nw m@xmath12 sr@xmath13 , which is an appreciable fraction given that the total background is about 10 nw m@xmath12 sr@xmath13 at 3.6 @xmath0 m .",
    "note that the background intensity of @xmath16 0.08 nw m@xmath12 sr@xmath13 we suggest for faint sources to describe unresolved source clustering shot - noise is also below the level of 1 to 2 nw m@xmath12 sr@xmath13 background intensity from a population of @xmath157 galaxies that was considered to reproduce clustering measurements of kashlinsky et al .",
    "( 2005 ) by salvaterra et al .",
    "salvaterra et al .",
    "( 2006 ) models assume that shot - noise is dominating from @xmath55 of 10@xmath158 and only consider the contribution coming from galaxies at high redshifts .    to emphasize",
    "the redshift ranges where the contributions are coming from , in our clf , we put a low redshift cut at @xmath159 .",
    "the expected counts are show in green in the right panel with corresponding clustering spectrum for those galaxies in the left panel of figure  8 .",
    "the clustering level is well below the measured level at two orders of magnitude below the amplitude of kashlinsky et al .",
    "since the clustering spectrum is proportional to square of the background , see section  5 , one can arbitrarily renormalize the counts , as in the case of models in salvaterra et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , to fit kashlinsky et al .",
    "( 2005 ) data , but then the observed excess lead to a total intensity of irb an order of magnitude higher .",
    "similarly , counts are also increased by an order of magnitude .",
    "this renormaization , however , is not correct since it leads to a large surface density of galaxies at redshifts more than 5 at a level more than allowed by the expected density of dark matter halos at these redshifts .",
    "this expected high density of galaxies has been already realized in salvaterra & ferrara ( 2006 ) who have argued against a large density of first galaxies that dominate the ir background given constraints on the number counts .",
    "this arbitrary normalization is not an issues for our clf models since the galaxy density is constrained given the connection between dark matter halos and galaxies they host . unlike the simple model in salvaterra et al .",
    "( 2006 ) the amplitude is not a free parameter .",
    "more importantly , figure  8 left panel also shows that the clustering predicted for galaxies in the magnitude range between 22.5 and 26 is consistent with measurements of kashlinsky et al .",
    "( 2005 ) for unresolved background and for clustering of resolved galaxies . here",
    ", non - linear clustering of galaxies within dark matter halos continue to be important out to multipoles of 10@xmath160 . for comparison ,",
    "in figure  8 left panel , we also show the clustering measurements in our faintest bin between 21 and 22.5 in goods .",
    "the excess seen in kashlinsky et al .",
    "( 2005 ) can be described as simply an extension of resolved component that we have measured and extending to a larger angular scale than for measurements in kashlinsky et al .",
    "( 2005 ) . in combination",
    ", there is a consistent description to the data from our clfs suggesting that the unresolved component seen by kashlinsky et al .",
    "( 2005 ) can be described by galaxy counts with magnitudes between 22.5 and 26 at redshifts below 5 with contributions mostly from redshifts 1 to 3 , and that there is no need to invoke a large surface density of galaxies at redshifts above 5 .    the limited range of multipoles probed by kashlinsky et al .",
    "( 2005 ) limits us from making an exact statement given that the data can also be modeled from a clustering spectrum that trace the linear density field at redshifts above 8 ( dot - dashed lines following cooray et al .",
    "this diffuse background is taken to be produced by pop - iii stars and their spectra are completely different from known galaxies given the dominant energy in the lyman-@xmath15 line , which is redshifted to near - ir wavelengths today ( see , santos et al .",
    "thus , our modeling based on clfs described above will not contain such a separate component especially if the pop - iii formation happens at @xmath161 .",
    "the 3.5 @xmath0 m irb intensity associated with models in the top and the bottom curve is @xmath16 2.5 and 0.3 nw m@xmath12 sr@xmath13 , respectively .",
    "the angular power spectrum of clustering peaks at a multipole of @xmath162 , corresponding to the peak of the linear clustering when projected at these high redshifts .",
    "if the irb excess is due to this component , the the clustering excess should peak at multipoles around @xmath63 @xmath162 ; this is simply a reflection of the projection associated with the peak of the linear mass power spectrum .",
    "as discussed in cooray et al .",
    "( 2004 ; bock et al . 2006 ) , in the h - band , the irb intensity is roughly a factor of 10 higher given that the pop - iii spectrum is sharply rising towards lower wavelengths as the intensity there is dominated by the lyman-@xmath15 emission associated with recombinations during the reionization of the universe .",
    "the two models shown in figure  8 left panel bracket two extreme regions in terms of the reionization history , the density of first galaxies , their clustering strength or bias , and the lyman-@xmath15 photon production .",
    "it is clear that one should focus on degree to arcminute angular scales for anisotropy studies in the irb instead of sub - arcminute angular scales considered by kashlinsky et al .",
    "( 2005 ) at multipoles above 10@xmath163 .",
    "as is clear from figure  8 left panel , such imaging need not be very deep since degree - scale shallow images that allow removal of sources down to a magnitude of 21 in the @xmath1-band can be easily used to probe the range suggested by the two extreme models .    to briefly summarize our discussion so far , the excess clustering power spectrum measured in kashlinsky et al .",
    "( 2005 ) is consistent with faint galaxies with magnitudes between 22.5 and 26 and predominantly at redshifts between 1 and 3 as extrapolated from measured lfs out to @xmath37 .",
    "these faint galaxies are unresolved in the deep _ spitzer _ images , but not a significant contributor to the total intensity of the irb . if we were to explain the missing irb with a new population of sources , such as pop - iii stars , then the clustering spectrum can be explained , but there is an overall increase in fluctuations at multipoles of @xmath16 10@xmath164 which is not currently probed by unresolved clustering .",
    "while degree to arcminute angular scale fluctuation measurements allow first - stars at @xmath165 to be more easily identified , extending fluctuation measurements to low multipoles is challenging with _",
    "irac images alone due to both the small field - of - view and to problems such as uncertainties in relative calibration associated with stitching independent fields together to make a larger map .",
    "the botes field considered here comes from a large number of independent images , but we are able to make clustering measurements of resolved sources since the catalogs are less affected by issues related to sensitivity variations from field to field .",
    "nevertheless , we are also studying the possibility to use the 6 deg.@xmath19 central region of the botes mosaic to at least place limits on the amplitude of unresolved source clustering at 10 arcminute angular scales to a degree angular scales .",
    "these results will be presented in an upcoming paper ( cooray et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "as mentioned in above , to separate various possibilities , the need for large - area clustering measurements is clear from the left panel of figure  8 ( see , also figure  2 of bock et al .",
    "2006 ) . while at multipoles of @xmath138 to 10@xmath158 the model clustering of a @xmath166 diffuse component overlaps with faint galaxy clustering , at multipoles of @xmath167 the clustering is well separated .",
    "thus , at degree angular scales , instead of deep images one can use shallow images down to a brighter magnitude limit to search for an excess component than the magnitude limit one has to image when probing the same diffuse component with images that allow clustering studies only at arcminute angular scales and below . in consideration of the two issues discussed so far ,",
    "large - angular scale excess and the large difference between measured irb intensity and the predicted intensity based on counts at lower wavelengths than studied by _ spitzer _ , we suggest observations that attempt to resolve the nature of the irb excess should concentrate on shallow , wide - field imaging at wavelengths below 3.6 @xmath0 m .    the cosmic infrared background explorer ( ciber ; bock et al .",
    "2006 ) is designed directly to address the `` missing source '' problem in irb that is significant between 1 @xmath0 m and 2 @xmath0 m through shallow , but wide - field images .",
    "ciber uses wide - field imagers with a field - of - view of 4 deg.@xmath19 in both i- and h - bands , supported by spectrometers to determine the contribution from zodiacal light and establish the spectrum of irb intensity from 0.7 to 1.8 @xmath0 m . with the wide - field coverage",
    ", ciber can measure clustering of irb light from multipoles below @xmath168 to @xmath138 covering the linear to non - linear regime from a single image .",
    "furthermore , ciber will image the botes field so that existing source counts from _ spitzer _ and other ground - based imaging data can be used to remove point sources . the combination of resolved and unresolved source clustering by extending studies such as the one presented here should allow us to pin down the sources responsible for the missing irb and directly address the `` missing source '' problem of the irb .",
    "in addition to ciber , at wavelengths above 2.2 @xmath0 m , the north ecliptic pole wide - field survey with the ir camera on _ akari _ ( matsuhara et al . 2006 ) will provide an additional dataset to study large - scale fluctuations in the near - ir background .",
    "the shallow survey useful for clustering measurements will span over 6.2 deg.@xmath19 and will allow    clustering measurements from the linear to non - linear scales similar to the angular power spectrum established here for 3.6 @xmath0 m resolved sources in the botes field . finally , it could be that after the depletion of cryogen necessary for longer wavelength instruments , _ spitzer _ will continue to operate only the first two channels of irac .",
    "such a scenario could be exploited for a very wide - field survey which in return could be used to further improve the clustering measurements of both resolved and unresolved components .",
    "while the deep imaging data with _ spitzer _ irac of the goods hdf - n and cdf - s fields have now allowed clustering measurements down to very faint magnitudes , these measurements are restricted to the non - linear regime .",
    "it will be very useful to measure clustering for sources at magnitude levels of 21 and fainter so that background anisotropy measurements at degree angular scales can be properly combined with resolved source clustering at these faint magnitude levels to obtain a complete picture of the irb anisotropies .",
    "we have presented a measurement of angular power spectrum of the clustering of near - ir sources at 3.6 @xmath0 m in _ spitzer _ imaging data of the goods hdf - n , the goods cdf - s , and the ndwfs botes field in several source magnitude bins .",
    "we also measured the angular power spectrum of resolved sources in the botes field at @xmath2 and @xmath3-bands using ground - based ir imaging data .",
    "in the three bands , @xmath3 , @xmath2 , and @xmath1 , we have detected the clustering of galaxies on top of the shot - noise power spectrum at multipoles between @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "the angular power spectra range from the large , linear scales to small , non - linear scales of galaxy clustering , and show a clear departure from a power - law clustering spectrum for @xmath1-band galaxies when clustering in the botes field is combined with goods .",
    "we consider a halo model to describe clustering measurements and establish the halo occupation number parameters of ir bright galaxies at redshifts around unity .",
    "the typical halo mass scale at which two or more ir galaxies with @xmath1-band magnitude between 17 and 19 are found in the same halo is between @xmath6 m@xmath7 and @xmath8 m@xmath7 at the 68% confidence level ; this is consistent with the previous halo mass estimates for galaxies at @xmath10 from clustering studies in surveys such as deep2 .",
    "we have also discussed our results in the context of a recent measurement related to the unresolved ir background ( irb ) anisotropies based on _ spitzer _ imaging data by kashlinsky et al .",
    "while the unresolved irb fluctuations were measured at sub - arcminute angular scales , we have argued that the nature of suggested excess clustering can be best studied with shallow , wide - field images that can make measurements of clustering from a few degree to arcminute angular scales with resolved @xmath1-band sources removed down to a magnitude level of about 21 and @xmath3-band sources removed down to a magnitude limit of 19 .",
    "an attempt at making a wide - field image of the near - ir sky is planned with the cosmic infrared background explorer ( ciber ; bock et al .",
