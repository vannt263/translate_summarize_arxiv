    ", can only be obtained once @xmath0 is known .",
    "a number of techniques have been devised to derive @xmath0 . in this work ,",
    "we use the relative flux level in the wings of h@xmath1 line profile as an indicator of the star s effective temperature ( e.g. , gehren 1981 , barklem et  al .",
    "2002 ) .    in studies of stars like the sun , systematic errors can be minimized if the data are carefully treated with a differential analysis .",
    "thus , very precise @xmath0 values can in principle be derived using high quality data of solar analog stars .",
    "the aim of this work is to derive @xmath0 values using model fits to the h@xmath1 line wings of 62 solar analogs and to compare the results with the @xmath0 values derived using three other methods .",
    "the method we use consists of finding the best match to an observed h@xmath1 line profile from a theoretical grid ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "spectroscopic data acquired with the r.  g.  tull coud spectrograph on the 2.7 m telescope at mcdonald observatory , properly normalized , are employed .",
    "the spectral resolution is @xmath2 and the average signal - to - noise ratio is 300 .",
    "spectral windows free from telluric lines in our solar spectrum ( asteroid reflected sunlight ) are identified first and later used for the entire sample .",
    "the model grid was calculated as in barklem et  al .",
    "( 2002 ) and it has a fine spacing of 10k in @xmath0 , 0.05dex in @xmath3 , and 0.05dex in @xmath4}}$ ] . the @xmath0 and its error are derived using least squares minimization .",
    "we find @xmath5k for the sun ( error bar corresponds to observational noise only ) .",
    "we applied zero point corrections to our solar @xmath0 s based on solar spectrum adding the difference in temperature that forces the solar @xmath0 to be equal to 5777k , adding the same temperature difference on the whole sample .",
    "internal errors in our derived @xmath0 values are about 25k .",
    "note , however , that barklem et  al .",
    "( 2002 ) point out that systematic errors can be as large as 80k .",

    "we compared our @xmath0(h@xmath1 ) with the @xmath0 s obtained from the method of the spectral line - depth ratios ( ldr ; e.g. , gray & johansson 1991 , gray 1994 ) , using the calibration formulae by kovtyukh et  al .",

    "the former could be due to the fact that ldr calibration formulae do not take @xmath4}}$ ] into account while the latter may be related to the degeneracy between @xmath0 and @xmath3 derived only from an iron line analysis ( i.e. , forcing excitation / ionization balance ) .",
    "we re - calculated the values of @xmath0(r09 ) and @xmath0(ldr ) , thus eliminating the small trends and offsets with linear corrections . in this way , residuals of the @xmath0 comparisons are dominated by measurement errors ( fig .  4 ) .",

    "effective temperatures have been determined using the method of balmer line fitting for a sample of 62 solar analog stars , with internal errors of about 25k .",
    "the other methods discussed in this work have internal errors of about 30 - 50k .",
    "the high precision of our @xmath0 values is useful to find small residual trends in the comparison with other methods .",
    "we find reasonably good agreement with the @xmath0 s obtained with the ldr , irfm , and r09 methods , but small trends and offsets for the residuals are detected and removed with linear corrections .",
    "we argue that high accuracy effective temperatures , with errors of order 10k , are possible to achieve for solar analog stars if several independent measurement are combined , mainly because the impact of errors is very small and can be understood and removed empirically .",
