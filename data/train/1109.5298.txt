    "one of the standardized features of financial data is that returns are uncorrelated , but their squares , or absolute values , are ( highly ) correlated , a property referred to as long memory ( which will be later defined precisely ) .",
    "a second commonly accepted feature is that log - returns are heavy tailed , in the sense that some moment of the log - returns is infinite .",
    "the last one we want to mention is leverage . in the financial time series context",
    ", leverage is understood to mean negative dependence between previous returns and future volatility ( i.e. a large negative return will be followed by a high volatility ) .",
    "motivated by these empirical findings , one of the common modeling approaches is to represent log - returns @xmath0 as a stochastic volatility sequence @xmath1 where @xmath2 is an i.i.d .",
    "sequence and @xmath3 is the conditional variance or more generally a certain process which stands as a proxy for the volatility .",
    "in such a process , long memory can only be modeled through the sequence @xmath4 , and the tails can be modeled either through the sequence @xmath2 or through @xmath4 , or both .",
    "the well known garch processes belong to this class of models .",
    "the volatility sequence @xmath4 is heavy tailed , unless the distribution of @xmath5 has finite support , and leverage can be present .",
    "but long memory in squares can not be modeled by garch process .",
    "the figarch process was introduced by @xcite to this purpose , but it is not known if it really has a long memory property , see e.g. @xcite .    to model long memory in squares , the so - called _ long memory in stochastic volatility _ ( lmsv ) process was introduced in @xcite , generalizing earlier short memory version of this model . in this model , the sequences @xmath2 and @xmath4 are fully independent , and @xmath4 is the exponential of a gaussian long memory process . tails and long memory are easily modeled in this way , but leverage is absent . throughout the paper , we will refer to this process as lmsv , even though we do not rule out the short memory case .    in order to model leverage",
    ", @xcite introduced the egarch model ( where e stands for exponential ) , later extended by @xcite to the fiegarch model ( where fi stands for fractionally integrated ) in order to model also long memory . in these models , @xmath2 is a gaussian white noise , and @xmath4 is the exponential of a linear process with respect to a function of the gaussian sequence @xmath2 . @xcite extended the type of dependence between the sequences @xmath2 and @xmath6 and relaxed the gaussian assumption for both sequences , but assumed finite moments of all order .",
    "thus long memory and leverage are possibly present in these models , but heavy tails are excluded .    a quantity of other models have been introduced , e.g. models of robinson and zaffaroni @xcite , @xcite and their further extensions in @xcite ; larch(@xmath7 ) processes @xcite and their bilinear extensions @xcite , and larch@xmath8 @xcite ; to mention a few .",
    "all of these models have long memory and some have leverage and allow for heavy tails . the theory for these models",
    "is usually extremely involved , and only the asymptotic properties of partial sums are known in certain cases .",
    "we will not consider these models here . in",
    "@xcite the leverage effect and long memory property of a larch(@xmath7 ) model was studied thoroughly .",
    "the theoretical effect of long memory is that the covariance of absolute powers of the returns @xmath0 is slowly decaying and non summable .",
    "this induces non standard limit theorems , such as convergence of the partial sum process to the fractional brownian motion or finite variance non gaussian processes or even lvy processes . in practice , long memory",
    "is often evidenced by sample covariance plots , showing an apparent slow decay of the covariance function .",
    "therefore , it is of interest to investigate the asymptotic behaviour of the sample mean or of the partial sum process , and of the sample variance and covariances .    in the case",
    "where @xmath9 , @xmath6 is a stationary gaussian process with summable covariances and @xmath10 , the asymptotic theory for sample mean of lmsv processes with infinite variance is a straightforward consequence of a point process convergence result in @xcite .",
    "the limit is a lvy stable process .",
    "@xcite considered the convergence of the partial sum process of absolute powers of generalized egarch processes with finite moments of all orders and showed convergence to the fractional brownian motion . to the best of our knowledge , the partial sum process of absolute powers has never been studied in the context of heavy tails and long memory and possible leverage , for a general function @xmath11 .",
    "the asymptotic theory for sample covariances of weakly dependent stationary processes with finite moments dates back to anderson , see @xcite .",
    "the case of linear processes with regularly varying innovations was studied in @xcite and @xcite , for infinite variance innovation and for innovations with finite variance but infinite fourth moment , respectively .",
    "the limiting distribution of the sample covariances ( suitably centered and normalized ) is then a stable law .",
    "these results were obtained under conditions that rule out long memory . for infinite variance innovation with tail index @xmath12 ,",
    "these results were extended to long memory linear processes by @xcite .",
    "the limiting distributions of the sample covariances are again stable laws .",
    "however , if @xmath13 , @xcite showed that as for partial sums , a dichotomy appears : the limiting distribution and the rate of convergence depend on an interplay between a memory parameter and the tail index @xmath14 .",
    "the limit is either stable ( as in the weakly dependent or i.i.d .",
    "case ) or , if the memory is strong enough , the limiting distribution is non gaussian but with finite variance ( the so - called hermite - rosenblatt distributions ) .",
    "if the fourth moment is finite , then the dichotomy is between gaussian or finite variance non gaussian distributions ( again of hermite - rosenblatt type ) ; see @xcite , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 3.3 ) and @xcite .",
    "the asymptotic properties of sample autocovariances of garch processes have been studied by @xcite .",
    "stable limits arise as soon as the marginal distribution has an infinite fourth moment .",
    "@xcite studied the sample covariance of a zero mean stochastic volatility process , under implicit conditions that rule out long memory , and also found stable limits .",
    "@xcite ( generalized by @xcite ) studied partial sums and sample variance of a possibly nonzero mean stochastic volatility process with infinite variance and where the volatility is a gaussian long memory process ( in which case it is not positive but this is not important for the theoretical results ) .",
    "they obtained a dichotomy between stable and finite variance non gaussian limits , and also the surprising result that when the sample mean has a long memory type limit , then the studentized sample mean converges in probability to zero .",
    "the first aim of this article is to study asymptotic properties of partial sums , sample variance and covariances of stochastic volatility processes where the volatility is an arbitrary function of a gaussian , possibly long memory process @xmath6 independent of the sequence @xmath2 , which is a heavy tailed i.i.d .  sequence .",
    "we refer to these processes as lmsv processes .",
    "the interest of considering other functions than the exponential function is that it allows to have other distributions than the log - normal for the volatility , while keeping the convenience of gaussian processes , without which dealing with long memory processes becomes rapidly extremely involved or even intractable .",
    "the results we obtain extend in various aspects all the previous literature in this domain .",
    "another important aim of the paper is to consider models with possible leverage . to do this",
    ", we need to give precise assumptions on the nature of the dependence between the sequences @xmath2 and @xmath6 , and since they are related in the process @xmath0 through the function @xmath11 , these assumptions also involve the function @xmath11 .",
    "we have not looked for the widest generality , but the functions @xmath11 that we consider include the exponential functions and all symmetric polynomials with positive coefficients .",
    "this is not a severe restriction since the function @xmath11 must be nonnegative .",
    "whereas the asymptotic theory for the partial sums is entirely similar to the case of lmsv process without leverage , asymptotic properties of sample autocovariances may be very different in the presence of leverage . due to the dependence between the two sequences , the rates of convergence and asymptotic distribution",
    "may be entirely different when not stable .",
    "the article is organized as follows . in section [ sec : prel ]",
    "we formulate proper assumptions , as well as prove some preliminary results on the marginal and multivariate tail behaviour of the sequence @xmath0 . in section  [ sec : pp - conv ] , we establish the limit theory for a point process based on the rescaled sequence @xmath0 .",
    "this methodology was first used in this context by @xcite and our proofs are closely related to those in this reference .",
    "section [ sec : partial - sums ] applies these results to obtain the functional asymptotic behaviour of the partial sum process of the sequences @xmath0 and of powers . in section [ sec : sample - covariances ] the limiting behaviour of the sample covariances and autocorrelation of the process @xmath0 and of its powers is investigated .",
    "proofs are given in section [ sec : proofs ] .",
    "in the appendix we recall some results on multivariate gaussian processes with long memory .",
    "we consider in this paper sequences @xmath0 which can be expressed as @xmath15 , where @xmath2 is an i.i.d .",
    "sequence and @xmath16 is independent of @xmath17 for each @xmath18 .",
    "originally , sv and lmsv processes refer to processes where the sequences @xmath2 and @xmath4 are fully independent , @xmath9 , @xmath6 is a gaussian process and @xmath19 ; see e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the names egarch and fiegarch , introduced respectively by @xcite and @xcite , refer to the case where @xmath19 and where @xmath6 is a non gaussian process which admits a linear representation with respect to an instantaneous function of the gaussian i.i.d .",

    "the lmsv processes can be seen as border cases of egarch type processes , where the dependence between the sequences @xmath2 and @xmath6 vanishes . in this article",
    ", we consider both lmsv models , and models with leverage which generalize the egarch models as defined by @xcite . in order to refer to the latter models , we have chosen not to use the acronym egarch or fiegarch , since these models were defined with very precise specifications and this could create some confusion , nor to create a new one such as gegarch ( with @xmath20 standing twice for generalized , which seems a bit too much ) or ( iv)lmsvwl ( for ( possibly ) infinite variance long memory stochastic volatility with leverage ) . considering that the main feature which distinguishes these two classes of models is the presence or absence of leverage",
