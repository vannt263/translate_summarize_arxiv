    "one of the biggest challenges in modern cosmology is to explain the apparent accelerated expansion of the universe today @xcite . a variety of possible explanations",
    "have been put forward @xcite including allowing for the existence of dark energy in einstein gravity and modification of general relativity .",
    "vacuum energy is possibly the simplest model of dark energy , without any new dynamical degrees of freedom and with a vacuum equation of state ( eos ) , @xmath7 . in einstein gravity , a covariantly conserved vacuum energy density , @xmath8 , is equivalent to a cosmological constant , @xmath9 .",
    "this is the basis of the @xmath6cdm cosmology , which is a highly predictive model to explain the present acceleration of the universe .",
    "however , the @xmath6cdm model suffers from fine tuning and coincidence problems . as a result , many researchers have considered dynamical models of dark energy with a non - vacuum equation of state , @xmath10 , leading to a time - dependent dark energy density , e.g. , scalar field models , , quintessence @xcite , phantom @xcite , quintom @xcite , or dark fluids @xcite .",
    "these different theories can be probed by a range of observational datasets @xcite .    in 2013",
    "the planck satellite provided a high - resolution measurement of anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) @xcite . with the first release of planck data , the cosmological analysis from planck collaboration showed that the standard spatially - flat @xmath6cdm model remains an excellent fit to the cmb data @xcite .",
    "however , the results also pointed out some tension between planck and other measurements of values of some cosmological parameters within the @xmath6cdm scenario @xcite .",
    "notably , the planck collaboration presented a low value of the hubble constant , , see , ref .",

    "when the sum of the masses of the active neutrinos is fixed to zero , the value of hubble constant is changed slightly , giving @xmath14 kms@xmath13mpc@xmath13 .",
    "both results from planck data are in tension with , for instance , direct measurements of @xmath2 by the hubble space telescope ( hst ) observations of cepheid variables , @xmath15 kms@xmath13mpc@xmath13 @xcite .",
    "there is also some tension between the primary cmb anisotropies and measurements of the growth of structure , such as cluster number counts @xcite .",
    "this tension between the @xmath2 value determined from planck and direct measurements of the hubble constant by hst could be due to an incomplete understanding of the astrophysical observations .",
    "the direct measurements of @xmath2 have been revisited through reanalysing cepheid data to address possible inconsistencies @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the determination on @xmath2 from cmb data is based on the assumption of an underlying theoretical model , so it is worthwhile to study the predictions in extensions of @xmath6cdm model , for instance , the neutrino @xmath6cdm model @xcite , dynamical dark energy models @xcite , or coupled dark energy models @xcite .    a non - gravitational interaction between vacuum energy and matter provides an alternative framework in which to interpret the observational data .",
    "an interacting vacuum energy leads to a space- and time - dependent vacuum @xcite , in which the gradient of the vacuum energy is given by a 4-vector , @xmath16 the total energy - momentum must be conserved in a covariant theory , hence @xmath17 describes the net energy - momentum transfer to the vacuum from other matter fields .",
    "any dark energy cosmology with exotic equation of state @xmath18 , can be decomposed @xcite into a cosmology with interacting vacuum energy density @xmath19 plus pressureless dark matter density @xmath20    in this paper we consider a cosmological model where the homogeneous background has the same behaviour as a generalised chaplygin gas ( gcg ) @xcite",
    ". the gcg is parameterised by a single dimensionless parameter , @xmath0 , that in the interacting vacuum interpretation describes the energy transfer from matter to vacuum @xcite .",
    "thus we recover the @xmath6cdm model in the limit @xmath21 .",
    "the original gcg model is severely constrained ( @xmath0 less than or of the order of @xmath22 ) by large - scale structure formation since the barotropic dark fluid has a non - zero speed of sound for @xmath23 , which may lead to large oscillations , or instabilities , in the matter power spectrum @xcite .",
    "instead we will consider the interacting vacuum+matter model ( a decomposed gcg model ) where the energy - momentum transfer 4-vector is proportional to the matter 4-velocity . in this case",
    "there is no force on the dark matter particles in the dark matter rest frame and hence the dark matter follows geodesics .",
    "the sound speed of matter perturbations is zero and there are no oscillations in the matter power spectrum @xcite .",
    "we revisit the constraints on this decomposed gcg using the new cmb data , including the temperature anisotropies from planck @xcite and polarization anisotropies from wmap9 @xcite .",
    "firstly we focus on investigating the consistency between the cmb data alone and hst constraints on @xmath2 .",
    "then we perform the constraints on the interacting vacuum model using cmb data combined with other data .",
    "we use the updated baryon acoustic oscillations ( bao ) data from the 6df galaxy survey @xcite , sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) dr7 @xcite , baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey ( boss ) dr9 @xcite , and wigglez dark energy survey @xcite .",
    "we also use the measurements of redshift space distortions ( rsd ) @xcite , which provides information of the growth of structure .",

    "<S> redshift - space distortions ( rsd ) , which constrain the linear growth of structure , provide the tightest constraints on vacuum interaction when combined with planck+wp , and prefer energy transfer from vacuum to dark matter ( @xmath4 ) which suppresses the growth of structure . using the combined datasets of planck+wp+union2.1+bao+rsd , we obtain the constraint on @xmath0 to be @xmath5 ( 95% c.l . ) , allowing low @xmath2 consistent with the measurement from 6df galaxy survey . </S>",
