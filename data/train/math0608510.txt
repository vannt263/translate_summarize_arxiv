    "suppose now that we consider a perturbed nls , that is , the gross - pitaevskii equation , by adding an external potential : @xmath3 if as initial data we take a soliton approaching the impurity from the left : @xmath4 then until time @xmath5 , the propagation will still be approximately given by .",
    "here we put @xmath6 and @xmath7 . scaling properties of the delta function",
    "show that this allows general soliton initial conditions .",
    "thus the velocity , @xmath8 , and the coupling constant , @xmath9 , are the only parameters of the problem .",
    "for @xmath10 the effects of the delta potential are dramatically visible and as we show in this paper they can be understood using the transmission and reflection coefficients of the delta potential from standard scattering theory .    for the soliton scattering the natural definition of the transmission rate",
    "is given by @xmath11 where on the right we recalled the conservation of the @xmath12 norm .",
    "the reflection coefficient is @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "the following result is obtained by a numerical analysis of the problem : @xmath15 in  [ ros ] we explain how a weaker rigorous result is obtained in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 1 ) .",
    "fig.[f : trans1 ] shows the numerical agreement of @xmath16 as a function of @xmath17 .    the leading term on the right hand side of has the following natural interpretation in elementary scattering theory ,",
    "see for instance @xcite . since we need it below to formulate the result about soliton splitting we review the basic concepts .",
    "thus let @xmath18 and consider a general solution to @xmath19 , @xmath20 the matrix @xmath21 is called the _ scattering matrix _ and in our simple case it can be easily computed : @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the transmission and reflection coefficients : @xmath25 they satisfy two equations , one standard ( unitarity ) and one due to the special structure of the potential : @xmath26    the quantum transmission rate at velocity @xmath8 is given by the square of the absolute value of the transmission coefficient , @xmath27 we recall ( see ( * ? ? ? * ( 2.21 ) ) ) that if @xmath28 is a smooth function which is zero outside , say , @xmath29 $ ] , @xmath30 , then @xmath31 just as in the nonlinear soliton experiment .",
    "hence shows that in scattering of fast solitons the transmission rate is well approximated by the quantum transmission rate of the delta potential  see  [ nr ] for more on that and the comparison with the linear case .",
    "our second result shows that the scattered solution is given by a sum of a reflected and a transmitted soliton , and of a time decaying ( radiating ) term .",
    "in other words , the delta potential splits the incoming soliton into two waves which become single _",
    "solitons_. in previous works in the physics literature ( see for instance @xcite ) the resulting waves were only described as `` soliton - like '' .",

    ". it would be interesting to see if bright solitons seen in bose - einstein condensates @xcite could be `` split '' using lasers modeled by delta impurities .    in the mathematical literature",
    "the dynamics of solitons in the presence of external potentials has been studied in high velocity or semiclassical limits following the work of floer and weinstein @xcite , and bronski and jerrard @xcite . roughly speaking",
    ", the soliton evolves according to the classical motion of a particle in the external potential .",
    "that is similar to the phenomena in other settings , such as the motion of the landau - ginzburg vortices .",
    "the possible novelty in and lies in seeing _",
    "quantum _ effects of the external potential strongly affecting soliton dynamics .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in  [ nr ]",
    "we present a more detailed discussion of numerical results , and in  [ nm ] we outline the methods used in our computations . finally in  [ ros ]",

    "we stress that the rigorous results of @xcite provide weaker error estimates and hold in a limited time range only .",
    "we find it very interesting however that some results which are theoretically demonstrated , such as the thresholds or the long time behaviour of the the free nls , are difficult to verify numerically  see   [ resow ] and [ cnls ] . on the other hand things which are hard to prove , such as the existence of limits ,",
    "seem to be very clear in numerical analysis .",
    "we recall from  [ in ] the definitions of the transmission and reflection rates @xmath46 these definitions assume the existence of the limits .",

    "@xmath61 the second frame of fig.[f : trapped ] , which presents data for velocities 2 to 5 and @xmath62 to @xmath63 , demonstrates that @xmath60 conforms well to the formula .",
    "linear regression on the data yields the values of @xmath64 and @xmath65 reported in table [ t : regression1 ] .",
    "we see that in constrast to the behaviour of @xmath66 , @xmath65 increases with @xmath67 .",
    "this produces a numerical road block in studying the asymptotic behaviour further for @xmath68 and @xmath69",
    ". we do not have enough significant digits in our data to measure values of @xmath60 less than @xmath70 .",
    "for the nonlinear bound state , @xmath71 , given by , we have @xmath72 hence , the behaviour of @xmath73 ( see and table [ t : regression1 ] ) shows that @xmath74 approaches @xmath75 at an exponential rate as @xmath76 .",
    "we note that for @xmath74 very close to @xmath77 , is approximately and @xmath78 for @xmath79 large . ]",
    "@xmath80 which is a multiple of the eigenstate .",
    "given that the interaction with the delta potential is dominated by the linear part of the equation , we expect the trapped state will , immediately after interaction , resemble a linear eigenstate that will then resolve on a longer time scale to a nonlinear bound state of the form .",
    "it is thus perhaps more appropriate to reverse the heuristics : given a very small amplitude @xmath81 , if we set @xmath82 we obtain that the eigenstate of @xmath83 with amplitude @xmath81 is close to @xmath71 given by , that is , @xmath84 it is reasonable to expect that the nonlinear bound state ultimately selected from an immediate post - interaction eigenstate of the _ linear _ operator @xmath83 , is `` close '' , in the sense of , to the starting eigenstate of @xmath83 , and indeed , the numerics point in this direction .",
    "the first frame of fig.[f : trapped ] shows for a typical case ( @xmath62 , @xmath85 ) that a stable trapped mass is selected within a reasonable amount of time following the interaction and there is little evidence of mass being radiated away from the origin .",
    "the stabilization of solitons described in ( and in a slightly weaker form rigorously in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 2 ) ) occurs over long time intervals  see the comment at the end of  [ ros ] .",
    "hence for the calculation of the amplitudes @xmath86 and @xmath87 in we must alter our approach .",
    "we begin by solving the nonlinear equation .",
    "however , we also measure the @xmath0 difference between the solution at every time step and the expected profile given by @xmath88.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] shortly after the time of interaction with the delta potential , we see this difference attains a minimum . at this time , we save the computed solution , @xmath89 , and continue to solve forward in time . as we solve forward , we compute @xmath90 since this norm remains negligible we switch to the analysis of the simpler solution of the , @xmath91 .    more precisely , we truncate the solution on both sides of the delta to give two sets of initial data .",
    "we then perform a phase shift in order to give each piece a zero velocity .",
    "they are then embedded at the center of a very large grid with zeroes outside their computed ranges . from here , we solve forward on this larger grid using @xmath92 in order to observe the amplitude stabilization predicted by .",
    "the grid is chosen large enough so that several amplitude oscillations can occur without interference from accumulated errors at the boundary . though the amplitude continues to oscillate , we time average the amplitudes until we see stabilization .",
    "it is these time averages over significantly large intervals that are reported in fig.[f : maciejfav ] .",
    "we see a clear agreement with especially for the higher velocity . however , the theoretically predicted thresholds for the formation of the reflected and transmitted solitons are hard to verify numerically .",
    "we now turn to the matter of propagating initial data @xmath93 according to @xmath94 , which has been explored analytically via the inverse scattering method in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* appendix b ) .",
    "fig.[f : resolve ] reports the results of an experiment with @xmath95 . the first panel depicts the time evolution of the amplitude at the spatial origin , @xmath96 , and the second panel depicts the deviation of the time evolution of the phase at the spatial origin from that of the soliton @xmath97 .",
    "the amplitude appears to be converging to the theoretically expected value of @xmath98 and the phase deviation appears to be converging to the expected value of @xmath99 .    in regard to the phase computation , it should be noted that although this experiment was performed on a @xmath100 grid of size @xmath101 with spatial extent @xmath102 , the reported phase deviation is the difference of two numbers on the order of @xmath103 and the obtained values are three orders of magnitude smaller .",
    "this opens a possibility of an inaccuracy of this long - time computation .",
    "in this section we outline numerical methods used to produce the results described in  [ nr ] .",
    "we discretize our equation , @xmath104 using a finite element scheme in space and the standard midpoint rule in time . just as the equation itself",
    "this method is @xmath0 conservative .",
    "a finite difference scheme can also be implemented with an approximate delta function , but then convergence must be determined in terms of finer meshes as well as more accurate delta function approximations . in finite element methods the inherent integration allows us to directly incorporate the delta function into the discretization of the problem .",
    "a similar scheme was implemented without potential in @xcite , where the blow - up for nls in several dimensions was analyzed .",
    "we review the method here and describe how to discretize the delta potential .",
    "note that we require the spatial grid to be large enough to insure negligible interaction with the boundary .",
    "for the convergence of such methods without potentials see the references in @xcite .",
    "we select a symmetric region about the origin , @xmath105 $ ] , upon which we place a mesh of @xmath106 elements . the standard hat function basis is used in the galerkin approximation .",
    "we allow for a finer grid in a neighbourhood of length @xmath107 centered at the origin to better study the effects of the interaction with the delta potential . in terms of the hat basis",
    "the problem becomes : @xmath108 where @xmath109 is the standard @xmath0 inner product , @xmath110 is a basis function and @xmath111 , @xmath112 are linear combinations of the @xmath110 s .",
    "we remark that since @xmath113 s are continuous the pairing of @xmath114 with the delta function is justified .",
    "since the @xmath110 s are hat functions , we have created a tridiagonal linear system with one contribution to the central element resulting from the delta function .",
    "let @xmath115 be a uniform time step , and let @xmath116 be the approximate solution at the @xmath117th time step .",
    "implementing the midpoint rule in time , the system becomes : @xmath118 by defining @xmath119 we have simplified our system to : @xmath120 an iteration method from @xcite is now used to solve this nonlinear system of equations . to wit , @xmath121 we take @xmath122 and perform three iterations in order to obtain an approximate solution .",
    "the measure of success of this method is indicated by the agreement of the computed solutions and the exact solutions such as , and more remarkably by the agreement with the inverse scattering method ",
    "see  [ cnls ] above .",
    "when the delta potential is present ( @xmath123 ) the @xmath12 norm remains essentially constant as predicted by theory .",
