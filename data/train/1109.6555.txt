    "understanding how surfaces may constrain the configuration of biopolymers on mesoscopic scales is important in a number of processes in cell biology .",

    "modeling all of the relevant interactions is complicated : one needs to accommodate the competition between polymer elasticity and entropy ; in the case of dna , electric fields will be important .",
    "a nice short review in this context is provided in @xcite .",
    "recently , simulations treating various features of the confinement process have been performed @xcite ; the former focuses on entropy , the latter on the dramatic effects of friction and the finite transverse dimensions of the confined object .    in this paper",
    ", we address an aspect of the problem of a fundamental nature that does not appear to have been addressed previously in any detail : how does one characterize the equilibrium states of the three - dimensional elastic energy of a polymer confined within a fixed surface ? while this description of confinement leaves out a lot of the physics that is relevant in biological systems , it presents a well - defined problem exhibiting a striking level of complexity that is worth studying in its own right .",
    "the semi - flexible polymer will be modeled as a curve in three - dimensional space parameterized by arc - length @xmath11 .",
    "the bending energy associated with a given conformation is quadratic in the frenet - serret curvature along the curve , @xmath12 , @xmath13 curves of fixed length minimizing the unconstrained energy ( [ hamk2 ] ) were first studied in depth by euler .",
    "a historical review is provided in ref .",
    "@xcite ; a more contemporary approach to the problem is presented in @xcite and reviewed in ref .",
    "an alternative framework , which lends itself to adaptation to the confinement problem , was developed in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in the absence of constraints on a closed loop ,",
    "there is not a lot to say : the only stable equilibrium is a circle .",
    "confinement within a surface , however , will generally oblige the loop to adopt a non - circular shape , increasing its elastic energy .",
    "the contact with the surface itself may be complete or it may be partial ; and contrary to one s initial guess , the bound state will not generally follow a surface geodesic ; nor need it be unique .    the wrapping of a semi - flexible polymer around a cylinder , a closely related problem relevant in the the winding of dna around histone octamers , was first examined some time ago by nickerson and manning @xcite .",
    "their strategy was to look at the independent degrees of freedom of the surface - bound polymer .",
    "while focusing directly on these degrees of freedom makes sense , it does not exploit the symmetries of the problem .",
    "for , even though the constraint breaks the euclidean invariance of the three - dimensional bending energy , how this occurs is not arbitrary .",
    "a variational framework is developed here that involves the unconstrained degrees of freedom , imposing the constraint using a local lagrange multiplier .",
    "this multiplier will quantify the loss of euclidean invariance in the constrained system .",
    "its value at any point along the loop will be identified as the local normal force that is being transmitted to the surface .",
    "the well - known integrability of the euler - lagrange equations for the unconstrained curve is a consequence of the euclidean invariance of its energy .",
    "the constrained counterpart generally will not be integrable . in various interesting cases , however , the confining geometry will respect some subgroup of the euclidean group .",
    "in particular , the conservation of torque associated with the residual rotational invariance of a sphere permits the euler - lagrange equation to be cast as a quadrature in the geodesic curvature which can be integrated directly .",
    "it also provides a direct recipe for the reconstruction of the loop from its curvature data adapted to the conserved torque vector as an axis of symmetry .",
    "in particular , we apply this framework to examine the confinement of a closed polymer loop of fixed length @xmath0 within a sphere of radius @xmath14 .",
    "in contrast to an open polymer which will wind around a geodesic circle on the sphere when its length exceeds @xmath15 , the closure of the loop is incompatible with a geodesic unless @xmath9 is tuned to be commensurate with an integer multiple of @xmath1 . we show that there exists an infinite number of distinct completely attached states , labeled by a pair of integers , @xmath6 and @xmath10 : @xmath16 , @xmath17 , the number of periods of the polar angle and azimuthal angles in one circuit of the loop respectively .",

    "the normalized local confining force @xmath20 is color coded in these figures.,title=\"fig : \" ]    beyond some critical size , the loop will exhibit self - intersections on the sphere .",
    "when @xmath4 this will occur when @xmath21 where the loop crosses the poles as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ figure1](d ) .",
    "we suppose that self - intersections are consistent with the physics and do not cost energy .    as @xmath9",

    "[ figure1](e ) and [ figure1](f ) .",
    "the discontinuity in the number of revolutions occurs at an intermediate value of @xmath9 where the loop crosses the poles .",
    "this is accompanied by a transition from oscillatory to orbital behavior .",
    "as @xmath9 is increased above @xmath23 , the dihedral symmetry of the lowest energy state descending from the @xmath4 ground state will jump to @xmath24 with the reestablishment of oscillatory behavior .",
    "the bending energy of this state as well as the total force that gets transmitted to the surface will be determined as a function of @xmath9 .",
    "the three- dimensional bending energy decomposes on the surface into a sum of two terms : one is associated with the geodesic curvature , intrinsic to the sphere ; the other is associated with the normal curvature inherited from the surface , constant on a sphere .",
    "the latter energy thus counts the number of times the loop is wound within the sphere and it is proportional to @xmath9 .",
    "the geodesic energy periodically falls to zero whenever @xmath25 and the loop is geodesic .",
    "local maxima , associated with the incommensurability of the loop length with geodesic behavior , are displayed between these values ; we show that their values decrease monotonically with loop size . for large values of @xmath9 ,",
    "the normal contribution is always dominant . it does not depend on the state in question",
    "thus , in this limit , the energy gap between the ground state and excited states disappears .",
    "the local force transmitted by the completely attached ground state loop is positive everywhere .",
    "surprisingly , the total force does not grow monotonically with loop length except asymptotically , where it grows linearly with @xmath9 and coincides with the naive expression , energy divided by @xmath1 .",
    "the change of symmetry as @xmath9 passes through odd integral multiples of @xmath1 , manifests itself in a positive jump in the transmitted force analogous to a euler instability associated with the buckling into oscillations .",
    "when @xmath7 , a new set of states appears as oscillations about a doubly covered geodesic circle , @xmath26 with an @xmath6-fold symmetry , @xmath27 ; among these new states , the lowest energy is displayed in the three - fold .",
    "also , because the geodesic energy is small when the oscillations are small , these states will have lower energy than the two - fold ground state in a finite band of values of @xmath9 beginning at @xmath28",
    ". there will be similar behavior in an infinite set of bands of values of @xmath9 where the descendant states become geodesic .",
    "one thus needs to reassess the stability of the two - fold ground state and its descendants .",
    "we provide a heuristic argument for stability by constructing a homotopy that interpolates between the states with @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath29 , @xmath26 . by examining the energy along this homotopy ,",
    "we show that a steep energy barrier separates the two equilibrium states .",
    "the @xmath4 , @xmath5 state and its descendants thus appear to be stable classically .",
    "for any @xmath7 , there are two stable states that alternate as the ground state as the length is increased .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ confinedelastica ] , we describe the framework .",
    "in particular , the breaking of translational invariance will be quantified by the non - conservation of a vector along the loop .",
    "it will be shown that the euler - lagrange equation for the curve can be cast as the vanishing of a linear combination of the unconstrained euler - lagrange derivatives .",

    "our examination of the confinement of a loop within a spherical cavity might lead one to expect that the equilibrium states of a confined loop will always attach .",
    "however , other confining geometries display very different behavior .",
    "consider , for example , the confinement of a loop by a cylinder of smaller radius .",
    "analogs of the @xmath6-folds exist but , in general , they do not provide the ground state as one can easily verify by playing with metal rings in a wastepaper basket .",
    "the details are surprisingly complicated . in this context",
    ", it would be interesting to understand how the spherical equilibrium states `` evolve '' under elliptical deformations of the sphere , or what effect surface irregularities or pores have on the confinement process .",
    "when contact with the confining surface is incomplete , one needs to address the issue of boundary conditions at points of contact .",
    "if the contact is due entirely to geometric hindrance , the boundary conditions at isolated points of contact are simple : the tangent vector to the curve is tangent to the surface at these points .",
    "if contact extends over a finite region , however , in addition to the tangent vectors the curvatures will also be continuous at the boundary of the region of contact .",
    "there may also be a tendency to either promote or inhibit adhesion to the confining surface .",
    "a simple way to accommodate such interactions is to introduce a local contact energy , proportional to the length of the contact interval .",
    "the boundary conditions will reflect this additional energy . while the curvature will suffer a discontinuity analogous to the discontinuity associated with the contact line bounding the region of contact between a fluid membrane and an attractive substrate @xcite , this is not the full story .",
    "the normals may rotate about the tangent vector , aligning themselves with some preferred direction on the confining geometry .",
    "the extension of our framework to accommodate contact energies will be presented elsewhere .    in this paper",
    "the role played by the confining surface has been passive : we have not considered the possibility that it may deform in reaction to the presence of the confined polymer .",
    "surface deformations due to membrane bound polymers may also play a role in shaping the morphologies of biological membranes .",
    "the forces transmitted to the membrane will now provide a source for the surface stress .",
    "understanding this coupling poses technical challenges .",
    "what is clear is that there will be interesting physics associated with the competing elastic energies @xcite .",
