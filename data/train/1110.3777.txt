    "the purpose of this paper is to investigate the asymptotic behavior of a whittle - like approximate maximum likelihood procedure for the estimation of the spectral parameters ( e.g. , the _ spectral index _ ) of isotropic gaussian random fields defined on the unit sphere @xmath0 . in our approach we consider the expansion of the field into spherical harmonics , i.e. we implement a form of fourier analysis on the sphere , and we implement approximate maximum likelihood estimates under both parametric and semiparametric assumptions on the behavior of the angular power spectrum .",
    "we stress that the asymptotic framework we are considering here is rather different from usual - in particular , we assume we are observing a single realization of an isotropic field , the asymptotics being with respect to higher and higher resolution data becoming available ( i.e. , higher and higher frequency components being observed ) . in some sense ,",
    "then the issues we are considering are related to the growing area of fixed - domain asymptotics ( see for instance @xcite , @xcite ) . from the point of view of the proofs , on the other hand ,",
    "our arguments are in some cases reminiscent of those entertained for instance by @xcite , where semiparametric estimates of the long memory parameter for covariance stationary processes are analyzed ; see also @xcite for related results in the setting of anisotropic random fields .    in our assumptions",
    ", we do not impose a priori a parametric model on the dependence structure of the random field we are analyzing ; we rather impose various forms of regularly varying conditions , which only constrain the high - frequency behaviour of the angular power spectrum .",
    "we are able to show consistency under the least restrictive assumptions ; a central limit theorem holds under more restrictive conditions , while asymptotic gaussianity can be established under general conditions for a slightly - modified ( _ narrow - band _ ) procedure , entailing a loss of a logarithmic factor in the rate of convergence .",
    "our analysis is strongly motivated by applications , especially in a cosmological framework ( see e.g. @xcite ,",
    "@xcite ) ; in this area , huge datasets on isotropic , spherical random fields ( usually assumed to be gaussian ) are currently being collected and made publicly available by celebrated satellite missions such as _ wmap _ or _ planck _ ( see for instance http://map.gsfc.nasa.gov/ ) ; parameter estimation of the spectral index and other spectral parameters has been considered by many authors ( see for instance @xcite for a review ) , but no rigorous asymptotic result has so far been produced , to the best of our knowledge .",
    "we thus hope that the consistency and asymptotic gaussianity properties we provide for our whittle - like procedure may provide a contribution towards further developments .",
    "we refer also to @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite for further theoretical and applied results on angular power spectrum estimation , in a purely nonparametric setting , and to @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , leonenko1 , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite for further results on statistical inference for spherical random fields .",
    "fixed - domain asymptotics for the tail behaviour of the spectral density on euclidean spaces has been recently considered also by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ; the issue is of great interest , for instance , in connection with kriging techniques for geophysical data analysis , see @xcite for a textbook reference .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows : in section [ subsec : gaussrandomfiels ] , we will recall briefly some well - known background material on harmonic analysis for spherical isotropic random fields ; in section [ sec : sphwhittle ] we introduce whittle - like maximum pseudo - likelihood estimators for angular power spectrum coefficients based on spherical harmonics ; section [ asconsistency ] is devoted to the asymptotic results , while in section [ narrowband ] we investigate narrow - band estimates .",
    "the presence of observational noise is considered in section [ noise ] , while section [ numerical ] provides some numerical evidence to validate the findings of the paper .",
    "directions for future research are discussed in section [ conclusions ] , while some auxiliary technical results are collected in the appendix .",
    "in this section , we will present some well - known background results concerning harmonic analysis on the sphere .",
    "we shall focus on zero - mean , isotropic gaussian random fields @xmath1 .",
    "it is well - known that such fields can be given a spectral representation such that @xmath2where the set of homogenous polynomials @xmath3 represents an orthonormal basis for the space @xmath4 , the class of functions defined on the unitary sphere which are square - integrable with respect to the measure @xmath5 ( see for instance @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , for more details , and @xcite , @xcite for extensions ) .",
    "note that this equality holds in both @xmath6 and @xmath7 senses for every fixed @xmath8 .",
    "we recall also that a field @xmath9 is isotropic if and only if for every @xmath10 ( the special group of rotations in @xmath11 ) and @xmath12 ( the unit sphere ) , we have @xmath13where the equality holds in the sense of processes .    an explicit form for spherical harmonics is given in spherical coordinates @xmath14 $ ] , @xmath15 by :    @xmath16    @xmath17 denoting the associated legendre function ; for @xmath18 we have @xmath19 the standard set of legendre polynomials ( see again @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the following orthonormality property holds:@xmath20    for an isotropic gaussian field , the spherical harmonics coefficients @xmath21 are gaussian complex random variables such that@xmath22where of course the angular power spectrum @xmath23 fully characterizes the dependence structure under gaussianity ; here , @xmath24 is the kronecker delta , taking value one for @xmath25 zero otherwise .",
    "further characterizations of the spherical harmonics coefficients are provided for instance by @xcite , @xcite ; here we simply recall that @xmath26where all these random variables are independent . given a realization of the random field ,",
    "an estimator of the angular power spectrum can be defined as:@xmath27the so - called empirical angular power spectrum .",
    "it is immediately seen that@xmath28    we shall now focus on some semiparametric models on the angular power spectrum ; here , by semiparametric we mean that we shall assume a parametric form on the asymptotic behavior of @xmath29 but we shall refrain from a full characterization over all multipoles @xmath30 more precisely , we formulate the following :    [ a ] the random field @xmath31 is gaussian and isotropic with angular power spectrum such that:@xmath32where @xmath33 and for all @xmath34@xmath35    condition a seems very mild , as it is basically requiring only some form of regular variation on the tail behavior of the angular power spectrum @xmath23 .",
    "for instance , in the cmb framework the so - called _ sachs - wolfe _ power spectrum ( i.e. the leading model for fluctuations of the primordial gravitational potential ) takes the form ( [ reg2 ] ) , the spectral index @xmath36 capturing the scale invariance properties of the field itself ( @xmath36 is expected to be close to 2 from theoretical considerations , a prediction so far in good agreement with observations , see for instance dode2004 and @xcite ) . for our asymptotic results below , we shall need to strengthen it somewhat ; as we shall see , condition [ a1 ] will turn out to be sufficient to establish a rate of convergence for our estimator , under condition [ a2 ] we will be able to provide a law of large numbers , while under condition [ a3 ] our estimates will be shown to be asymptotically gaussian and centered , thus making statistical inference feasible . on the other hand , in section [ narrowband ] we shall be able to provide narrow - band estimates with asymptotically centred limiting gaussian law under condition [ a1 ] , to the price of a logarithmic term in the rate of convergence .",

    "our aim in this section is to discuss heuristically a whittle - like approximation for the log - likelihood of isotropic spherical gaussian fields , and to derive the corresponding estimator .",
    "assume that the triangular array @xmath50",
    "@xmath51 @xmath52 is evaluated from the observed field @xmath53 by means of ( [ invfour ] ) .",
    "our motivating rationale is the idea that a set of harmonic components up to multipole @xmath54 can be reconstructed without observational noise or numerical error , whereas the following are simply discarded ; this is clearly a simplified picture , but we believe it provides an accurate approximation to many current experimental set - ups .",
    "of course , @xmath54 grows larger when more sophisticated experiments are run ( @xmath54 can be considered in the order of 500/600 for data collected from @xmath55 and 1500/2000 for those from @xmath56 it is readily seen from ( [ powest ] ) that@xmath57 ^{2}+2\\sum_{m=1}^{l}\\left [ \\im\\left\\",
    "{ a_{lm}\\right\\ } \\right ] ^{2}\\right\\ } \\text { , } \\]]where the variables @xmath58 are @xmath59 gaussian variables with law @xmath60 , see @xcite .",
    "the likelihood function can then be written down as @xmath61    clearly this landscape is overly simplified , for instance , due to numerical errors and aliasing effects the expected value @xmath62 may not be exactly equal to the population model @xmath63 however in conditions [ a ] and following we are allowing the two to differ to various degrees , and we expect this to cover to some of effect these experimental features that we are neglecting .",
    "also , rather than a sharp cutoff at @xmath54 , a smooth transition towards noisier frequencies would represent more efficiently actual experimental circumstances ; we shall address this issue later on in this paper .",
    "finally , it may be unreasonable to assume that the spherical surface is fully observed ; for most experimental set - ups , either in cosmology or in geophysics , only subsets are actually sampled .",
    "this problem can be addressed by focussing on wavelet transforms rather than standard fourier analysis ; we shall consider this extension in a different work .",
    "an alternative heuristics for our framework can be introduced considering that for @xmath64 the following fourier components can be observed on a discrete grid of points @xmath65@xmath66to simplify our discussion , we shall also pretend that @xmath67 form a set of approximate _ cubature points _ with constant _ cubature weights _",
    "@xmath68 ( see for instance @xcite , @xcite ) , so that we have@xmath69as discussed also by @xcite , the number of cubature points must grow at least as quickly as the square of the highest multipole considered , i.e. @xmath70 for instance , for a satellite experiment such as _ planck _ the pixelization has cardinality of order @xmath71 and the highest multipole that can be analyzed correspond broadly to the order @xmath72 as before , this landscape is overly simplified ; for instance , cubature weights on the sphere are known not to be constant , but their variation is usually considered numerically negligible .",
    "the frequency components @xmath73 are well - known to be independent and we can hence write down the likelihood function as @xmath74where @xmath75@xmath76the matrix @xmath77 can be ( approximately ) decomposed as follows:@xmath78\\]]@xmath79\\]]@xmath80 in fact @xmath81hence@xmath82now@xmath83 \\\\ & & \\times \\left [   \\begin{array}{c } \\sum_{m}a_{lm}y_{lm}(x_{1 } ) \\\\",

    "we envisage a situation where data analysis is carried over on multipoles @xmath87 where numerical errors are of smaller order and the approximation ( [ reg2 ] ) holds for the expected variance of the sample coefficients @xmath88 .",
    "as motivated in the introduction , in this paper we shall not assume we have actually available a fully parametric model for the angular power spectrum . instead",
    ", the idea will be to use an approximate maximum likelihood estimator , which shall exploit the asymptotic approximation provided by condition [ a ] , i.e. @xmath89 in view of the discussion in the previous section , the following definition seems rather natural :    the _ spherical whittle estimator _ for the parameters @xmath90 is provided by@xmath91    for general parametric models",
    "@xmath92 the _ spherical whittle estimator _ for a parameter @xmath93 can be obviously defined as@xmath94    to ensure that the estimator exists , as usual we shall assume throughout this paper that the parameter space for @xmath95 is a compact subset of @xmath96 more precisely we take @xmath97 , $ ] @xmath98 and @xmath99 this is little more than a formal requirement that is standard in the literature on ( pseudo-)maximum likelihood estimation .",
    "it should be noted that spherical whittle estimates are computationally extremely convenient , while their counterpart in the real domain is for all practical purposes unfeasible , given the dimension of current datasets .    under condition [ a3 ] , it is readily seen that @xmath100 is asymptotically distributed as a gamma random variables of parameters @xmath101 and the spherical whittle estimator is asymptotically equivalent to exact maximum likelihood .",
    "we can rewrite in a more transparent form the previous estimator following an argument analogous to @xcite , i.e. concentrating out  the parameter @xmath102 .",
    "indeed , the previous minimization problem is equivalent to let us consider@xmath103simple computations show that the minimization problem can be equivalently reformulated as @xmath104the proof of the following result is quite standard and goes largely along the lines of an analogous results provided in @xcite . as most of the ones to follow ,",

    "more challenging is the possibility to relax the gaussian assumption and consider more general , finite - variance isotropic gaussian fields . in this respect ,",
    "results in marpec2 suggest that the gaussianity assumption may indeed play a crucial role , as high - frequency consistency and gaussianity seem very tightly related , for instance when considering the asymptotic behavior of the angular power spectrum .",

    "likewise , the high - frequency behaviour of bayesian estimates definitely deserves some investigation in this framework , especially considering the growing interest for bayesian techniques in the astrophysical community .    for future work , we aim at relaxing some of the assumptions introduced in this paper to make these techniques more directly applicable on existing datasets .",
    "the harmonic estimates we have been focussing on require the observation of the random field on the full sphere .",
    "this condition often fails in practice : for instance , in a cosmological framework large regions of the sky are not observable , because they are masked by foreground sources such as the milky way . in ongoing research",
