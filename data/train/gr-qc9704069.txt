    "gravitational waves in the low - frequency regime ( @xmath0 to @xmath1 hz ) can only be observed from space , due to terrestrial disturbances . in space ,",
    "the only technique currently available , besides pulsar timing , is based on doppler tracking of an interplanetary spacecraft @xcite . however , this relatively inexpensive method has not provided enough sensitivity , thus far , for a detection . while better sensitivities may be expected in the near future , with advanced spacecraft such as cassini , much more ambitious projects for gravitational wave observatories in space have been proposed . among these ,",
    "the most promising detectors are based on space - born laser interferometry . in particular , lisa ( laser interferometer space antenna )",
    "@xcite , and omega ( orbiting medium explorer for gravitational astrophysics ) @xcite consist of six drag - free , laser - bearing spacecraft , launched in orbit around the sun ( lisa ) or the earth ( omega ) .",
    "the six spacecraft would be placed , in pair , at the vertex of a triangle with @xmath2 km sides for lisa , and 5 times smaller for omega . at each corner ,",
    "the two spacecraft are phase locked through the exchange of a laser signal , replacing in this way the central mirror of an ordinary michelson intereferometer .",
    "each of the two probes sends a laser beam to a probe at each of the other two equilateral points , where the tracking signal is transponded back by phase - locked lasers , and the returning beams are eventually interfered .",
    "in order to keep the triangular constellation as stable as possible , elaborated orbits have been designed . in lisa case",
    "each spacecraft is orbiting a circle of radius @xmath3 km over a period of 1 yr . the interferometer plane , at an inclination of @xmath4 with respect to the ecliptic , is also rotating around the sun with the same periodicity . in omega case",
    "the orbital plane is almost coincident with the ecliptic , and the interferometer is rotating around itself with a period of 53.21 days .",
    "the complicate motion is reflected in the time evolution of the interferometer s response to a source located in a fixed position in the sky .",
    "we will investigate the behavior of the antenna response in presence of a generic motion , and apply our results to the specific motions of interest .",
    "as a side - product of our analysis , we can also examine a terrestrial interferometer , where the motion is simply related to the earth s rotation around its axis , and study its antenna pattern as a function of the location and orientation on the earth s surface .    in this section",
    ", we briefly recall the formalism describing the antenna response to a gravitational wave passing by , in the long - wavelength approximation @xcite .",
    "first , we introduce the wave symmetric trace - free ( stf ) tensor @xmath5 where the ( complex ) vector @xmath6 is defined in terms of the polarization vectors @xmath7 and @xmath8 as @xmath9 the tensor @xmath10 represents the wave field as measured in the interferometer s proper rest frame . then we define the stf detector tensor @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the unit vector along the i - th arm .",
    "the interferometer response is the scalar obtained from the contraction of the wave tensor @xmath10 with the detector tensor @xmath13 @xmath14 the beam - pattern factors @xmath15 and @xmath16 depend on the antenna s orientation with respect to the wave s propagation direction and polarization axes .",
    "we can choose the reference frame as in fig .  1",
    ", with the x - axis of the @xmath17 frame bisecting the interferometer s arms , so that the only non - null components of @xmath13 in this reference frame are @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the aperture angle .",
    "therefore , in order to obtain @xmath20 , we just need the component @xmath21 in this particular frame .",
    "1 also shows the euler s angles @xmath22 , and @xmath23 which transform from the interferometer s frame @xmath17 to the wave reference frame @xmath24 .",
    "the latter is defined with the z - axis opposite to the propagation direction , and the @xmath25 and @xmath26 axes along @xmath7 and @xmath8 , respectively .",

    "is simply replace @xmath34 and @xmath35 with the appropriate functions @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "for example , if the antenna is rotating around its vertical axis with angular velocity @xmath38 ( fig .",
    "2 ) , then we can obtain the antenna pattern at any time @xmath39 from eq .",
    "( [ fixed ] ) , with the substitution @xmath40 where @xmath41 is some initial angle . as a matter of fact , this very simple case describes , with good approximation , the time evolution of omega @xcite . as mentioned in the introduction , the idea of omega is essentially similar to that of lisa , except that the six spacecraft are launched into a circular earth orbit , beyond the moon orbit .",
    "the triangle has now @xmath42 km sides , and it is rotating around itself with a period of @xmath43 days .",
    "however , to mask the motion of the antenna with the apparent motion of the source is not always convenient , especially when dealing with a large number of sources , or when the motion is very complicate . in this paper",
    ", we shall introduce a more useful representation , where every quantity is referred to a fixed reference frame , so that the source s polar coordinates @xmath34 and @xmath35 remain constant , and the antenna response depends on time through the actual motion of the interferometer .",
    "we now introduce an arbitrary reference frame @xmath44 , with the only requirement to be stationary with respect to fixed stars . to be more explicit ,",
    "when dealing with a space - born interferometer , we can adopt an ecliptic coordinate system . in the last section we will also consider a terrestrial interferometer , which is most easily described in an equatorial frame .",
    "the full description of the antenna response requires six euler s angles , defined as in fig .",
    "the orthogonal transformation from the wave s frame @xmath24 to the fixed frame @xmath44 is given by the orthogonal matrix @xmath45 the matrix @xmath46 which transform from @xmath17 to @xmath44 is analogous to the matrix @xmath47 , with the euler s angles @xmath48 replaced by the corresponding ones @xmath49 .",

    "these coefficients , given in appendix b , are quite complicate trigonometric polynomials of their arguments .",
    "nonetheless , eq .  ( [ sum ] ) turns out to be very useful in practice .",

    "in the previous section , we have considered the antenna power pattern associated to an unspecified motion of the detector .",
    "we will now focus our attention to the case of a space interferometer , which presents , independently of the particular project under investigation , some very general and interesting properties .    inserting the space interferometer in its orbit and keeping",
    "the interferometer configuration stable over the mission lifetime - at least two orbital periods - is a very demanding navigation task , due principally to the perturbations from the earth and the other planets .",
    "for instance , one of the consequences of the complicate orbit is the fact that we can not maintain equal distances between the probes . in a recent paper @xcite , we modeled the noise that is introduced into the differenced data because of the unequal arms , and showed that the final accuracy of the interferometer is not compromised .",
    "another example of the problems we may face in a space - born interferometer is that , due to the earth disturbances , high doppler rates would result .",
    "hellings et al.@xcite described a laser transmitter and receiver hardware system that provides the required readout accuracy and implements a self - correction procedure for the on - board frequency standard used for laser phase measurement .",
    "we will now consider the interferometer s orbit , and discuss its implication on the antenna response to a wave coming from a given direction in the sky .",
    "in particular , as we mentioned in the introduction , lisa @xcite will orbit the sun at the earth s distance , as far behind the earth as possible . the plane containing the six probes , during its orbit , will remain always tangent to the surface of a cone of @xmath4 aperture , and the detector itself will rotate in this plane with same periodicity - one year - but opposite direction .",
    "4 , reproduced from @xcite , shows lisa configuration .    in this section , we will consider a lisa - like motion , characterized by a generic cone aperture . in other words ,",
    "the motion of each of the three interferometers is assumed to be described by or @xmath69 by simply rescaling the time , taking for instance the origin of time at the passage through the line of nodes ( @xmath70 ) or through the vernal equinox ( @xmath71 ) . ]",
    "[ lisa ] @xmath72    note that @xmath51 and @xmath63 are counter - rotating .",

    "5 shows a plot of @xmath76 in polar coordinates for various values of the cone s aperture @xmath62 .",
    "note that @xmath77 corresponds to an interferometer fixed in space ; since we are taking @xmath63 and @xmath51 counter - rotating , the interferometer does not rotate at all .    we know from eq .",
    "( [ fixed ] ) that an interferometer fixed in space can never detect waves impinging from four specific null - directions , given by @xmath78 , and @xmath79 .",
    "we can now analyze what happens to these null - directions in the generic conical case , focussing our attention to the ecliptic plane @xmath78 .",
    "it is easy to show , from the behavior of the functions @xmath80 and @xmath81 ( see fig .",
    "6 ) , that there is a tendency for the null - directions on the ecliptic plane to remain visible , although the magnitude of this effect is strongly affected by the value of @xmath62 : for @xmath77 the null - directions are obviously completely preserved , while for @xmath82 the @xmath35-dependence is very poor .",
    "lisa is much closer to the latter case , and actually its @xmath83 is almost independent on @xmath34 as well , as we shall see in a while .",
    "note that , if @xmath63 and @xmath51 were co - rotating , instead of counter - rotating as in lisa , then in the last term of eq .",
    "( [ time ] ) we would have to make the substitution @xmath84 which means that the @xmath35-term would be even smaller , in absolute value , compared to @xmath80 .",
    "one might infer from fig .",
    "5d that , if the inclination is close to @xmath82 , then the zeros of the antenna pattern can be found in the direction orthogonal to the ecliptic plane . however , this is not the case , since @xmath85 implies that @xmath58 is still given by eq .",
    "( [ fixed ] ) , with @xmath34 and @xmath35 replaced , respectively , by @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "thus , even for @xmath82 the time average is non - zero at the poles .    another important issue related to eq .",
    "( [ time ] ) is the time - averaged antenna directionality . as we can predict from fig .  5",
    ", directionality is strongly dependent on the angle @xmath62 . to make this statement more precise ,",

    "( [ time ] ) in eq .",
    "( [ delta ] ) we easily obtain @xmath88 , shown in fig .  7 .",
    "explicitly , we find @xmath89^{1/2}\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    thus , the antenna pattern is distributed more and more isotropically as we increase @xmath62 from @xmath77 .",
    "after we reach a minimum at @xmath90 , the antenna s directionality starts increasing again .",
    "therefore , we can conclude that , in the conical case , it is impossible to get a perfectly isotropic response , i.e.  we never get @xmath91 ( see also the above discussion about the @xmath35-dependence ) .",
    "however , we can get very close to this ideal situation , if we choose @xmath62 appropriately .",
    "remarkably , lisa s inclination is very close to the optimal value @xmath90 , and gives @xmath92 .",
    "this means that lisa , during its lifetime , will cover the whole sky in an approximately uniform manner .",
    "of course , in some circumstances , directionality needs to be preserved .",
    "for instance , one may want to disentangle the isotropic component of the stochastic background from the anisotropic contribution of the galactic binaries .",
    "directionality can always be preserved integrating over a shorter period .",
    "8 shows lisa s antenna pattern averaged over 3 and 6 months , respectively .",
    "finally , we want to consider the interferometer s responsiveness to the galactic plane , given that most of the strongest sources will lie on this plane . in our coordinate system ,",
    "the galactic plane is characterized by @xmath93 where @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "assuming , for simplicity , that the sources are distributed isotropically on the plane , the event rate of disk s sources is proportional to the average area of the intersection of this plane with the antenna pattern , equal to @xmath96 ^ 2 dt\\ , d\\phi \\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath97 is the function given in eq .",
    "( [ plane ] ) .",
    "this area depends on the details of the detector s motion , in our case on @xmath62 , @xmath41 , and @xmath69 .",
    "9 shows the quantity @xmath98 as a function of @xmath62 , since the dependence on @xmath41 and @xmath69 can be neglected in a first approximation .",
    "for lisa , we find the small value @xmath99 , the exact value depending on the initial conditions @xmath100 .",
    "we conclude that lisa is not particularly sensititive to the galactic disk , due to the fairly large inclination to the ecliptic of both the detector s plane and the galaxy . according to this crude analysis",
    ", we can expect that omega , with a smaller , almost negligible , inclination , would increase its chances of observing a signal from the disk by roughly a factor two .",
    "note , however , that previous calculations @xcite have shown that gravitational radiation from galactic binaries in the disk is comparable to that coming from the local region ( @xmath101 pc ) .",
    "since the latter is isotropically distributed , the time - varying signal from the disk contributes only a fraction of the galactic binaries stochastic background .",
    "nonetheless , this small component could make the stochastic signal distinguishable from the detector s noise . in a future paper",
    "we will investigate the amplitude modulations introduced by the antenna motion in the confusion noise generated by different populations of galactic binary systems , and describe how to exploit this effect in order to detect the signal and to obtain information about the distribution of sources in the galaxy .",
    "as an additional application of eq .",
    "( [ sum ] ) , let us consider a terrestrial interferometer . in this case the most convenient choice for the ` fixed ' reference frame is the equatorial one , with the @xmath102 axis directed toward the north pole , and the @xmath103 axis toward the vernal equinox . in this frame",
    ", the motion of the interferometer becomes similar to the conical case previously analyzed , except that now the detector can not rotate on itself , of course .",
    "in other words we have    [ earthmotion ] @xmath104    where @xmath105 is the terrestrial latitude , @xmath38 is the earth s angular velocity of rotation , and @xmath106 $ ] is the angle between the arms bisector and the local parallel .",
    "for example , let us consider the average of the antenna pattern @xmath58 over the time of arrival of the signal . in the terrestrial case , as opposed to the conical case considered in sec .",
    "iii , the interferometer can not rotate around its vertical axis , and therefore averaging over time or @xmath35 gives the same result , namely @xmath107 for any specific value of @xmath34 , for example @xmath108 , corresponding to the direction of the center of the virgo cluster , eq .",
    "( [ earth ] ) gives the square of the r.m.s .",
    "power as a function of the antenna s position and orientation on the earth s surface , a quantity already numerically studied in @xcite .    instead of fixing @xmath34",
    ", we could try to answer the question : is there any particular location and orientation for which the antenna pattern , averaged over one day , is isotropic ?",
    "the answer turns out to be affirmative , and the isotropic antenna is characterized by    [ isotropy ] @xmath109    one can easily check , by inspection , that @xmath110 and @xmath111 produce @xmath112 or , equivalently , @xmath113 . a detector located at latitude @xmath110 and oriented by @xmath111 maximizes the event rate of an isotropic population of sources .    in the event that the detector s position has already been chosen ,",
    "one can still make use of eq .",
    "( [ earth ] ) in order to find the optimal orientation @xmath114 which gives the least directional antenna pattern at that latitude . at each latitude @xmath105",
    ", we define as optimal that orientation @xmath114 which minimize the quantity @xmath87 .",
    "10 shows @xmath115 and the corresponding minimum @xmath116 .",
    "we stress that , as one may actually expect , @xmath87 depends much more strongly on @xmath105 than @xmath117 , and in particular the antenna becomes rapidly anisotropic as we move away from @xmath110 , no matter how optimally we try to choose @xmath117 .",
    "moreover , we can foresee several terrestrial interferometers to be operative in the near future , so that the sky s coverage of a single antenna is not really an issue as critical as in the space - born case previously discussed .",
    "it is generally assumed that galactic and extragalactic binary systems are the most promising sources of gravitational waves for detectors based on laser interferometry .",
    "in fact , waves from a binary star , including the effect of eccentricity , orbital inclination , and also post - newtonian corrections , have long been studied , and are today well understood . in particular",
    ", the sensitivity of the planned space interferometers should allow the detection of waves from several known galactic binary stars . in the lisa and omega frequency band ,",

    "when the source s coordinates are unknown , however , one has to deal with the complication arising from the doppler effect @xcite .",
    "the motion of the detector , besides the amplitude modulation described in the present work , also introduces a location - dependent phase modulation , in the form of a doppler broadening of the sinusoidal signal . in the case of lisa ,",

    "several different strategies can be adopted to overcome this problem , although none of them is completely satisfactory , due to the large amount of computation involved .",

    "is mostly preserved , and can be exploited where necessary , for example in the search of a galactic binaries background .",
    "however , when we focused on the galactic disk , we found that the average antenna response is far from optimal , due to the relative orientation of the ecliptic and the galactic plane itself .",
    "we stress that these results are not conclusive , since we have neglected the anisotropy in the distribution of the sources with respect to the sun , due to the fact that we are located near the edge of the disk . in this respect ,",

    "thanks to the probable redundancy of future gravitational wave observatories , the discussion about a single antenna s sky s coverage is not so critical .",

    "<S> the response of an interferometer changing its orientation with respect to a fixed reference frame is analyzed in terms of the beam - pattern factors and the polarization - averaged antenna power pattern . </S>",
    "<S> given the antenna s motion , the latter quantity describes the antenna s directionality as a function of time .    </S>",
    "<S> an interesting case is represented by the class of motions where the detector s plane is constrained to move on the surface of a cone of constant aperture ; at the same time , the two arms are rotating around a vertical axis . </S>",
    "<S> this picture describes , in particular , the motion of lisa , a proposed space - based laser interferometer , as well as of other planned missions . the overall sky s coverage , and that of the galactic plane in particular , is provided as a function of the cone s aperture .    </S>",
    "<S> similarly , one can consider the case of an earth - based interferometer . </S>",
    "<S> using the same formalism , one can derive a simple expression for the antenna pattern , averaged over the time of arrival of the signal , as a function of the position and orientation on the earth s surface . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , there turn out to be two particular values for the terrestrial latitude and the inclination angle with respect to the local parallel which render the time - averaged antenna response perfectly isotropic .    in the frequency domain , </S>",
    "<S> the general result is that the detector s motion introduces in the instrumental response to a long - duration continuous signal a few harmonics of the orbital frequency , whose magnitude depends on the source s position in the sky . in particular , we describe lisa s response to circularly polarized sinusoidal waves coming from a few known binary systems in our galaxy . </S>"
