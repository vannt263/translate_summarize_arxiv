    "the composite higgs production through the decays of heavy quarks has been recently analyzed in @xcite .",
    "two types of productions for the heavy fermions have been considered in this report : the double production of vector - like quarks ( see also @xcite ) and the production of a heavy fermion in association with its sm partner from the decay of a heavy gluon @xcite . in this work",
    "we will consider the single production of a heavy fermion , which is mediated by the exchange of longitudinal electro - weak bosons @xcite .",
    "this type of production has been analyzed in @xcite to study the prospects of discovering the heavy fermions , without considering the higgs production . in this paper",
    "we present a first analysis of the higgs production mediated by the single production of a heavy fermion . as a first concrete case",
    ", we will focus our analysis on the single production of a heavy bottom ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "the bottom partner can be realistically lighter than other heavy resonances and its exchange leads to a particularly promising final state with a distinctive topology .",
    "other interesting channels , as we will highlight in section  [ sec : conclusions ] , involve the single production of heavy top partners ( a thorough analysis of these channels has been recently performed in @xcite ) .",
    "channel ( see the discussion in sec . [",
    "sec : conclusions ] ) . ] + the analysis we will perform considering the single production , as first pointed out in @xcite , offers , contrary to the other heavy - fermion - mediated production mechanisms , the possibility of measuring the higgs coupling to heavy fermions , from which it could be possible to extract important informations on the theory , such as the value of the yukawa coupling among composite states .",
    "a further advantage of this type of analysis resides in the fact that the signal cross section drops slowerly than that of double production with the increasing of the heavy fermion mass .",
    "therefore , an analysis of single production is expected to be more powerful than an analysis of double production , in the case of heavy fermions with mass above roughly @xmath16 gev ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the heavy fermion production from a heavy gluon proves to be very powerful , with the possibility for a discovery at the early lhc run @xcite .",
    "it has the disadvantage , however , to require the existence of a heavy gluon whose mass has to be comprised in a range @xmath17 $ ] , where @xmath18 denotes the mass of the heavy fermion , and to depend on several other parameters of the model , such as the top degree of compositeness @xcite .",
    "the analysis we will perform , on the contrary , depends on just two parameters ( in addition to the higgs mass and branching ratios ) , the heavy - bottom mass and its coupling to the higgs and electro - weak gauge bosons ; it could be thus also easily generalized to other scenarios .",
    "+ top partners which can be singly - produced by electroweak interactions also appear , for example , in little higgs models @xcite .",

    "at energies below the compositeness scale , assumed to be of several tev , composite operators excite from the vacuum a tower of infinite resonances ; we will work in the framework of an effective theory that includes only the lowest - lying resonances and reproduces the low - energy limit of a large set of composite higgs models and warped extra - dimensional theories with a custodial symmetry in the bulk  @xcite .",
