    "some numerical calculations published in an earlier paper @xcite seem to contradict this fact ( see in particular the two lower panels of figure  2 of @xcite ) .",
    "however , it is now clear that this apparent contradiction was due to poor choice of parameter values that made it appear , at the level of resolution of the computations presented , that unstable spectrum bifurcated from endpoints of bands of stable spectrum . choosing different velocities @xmath91 or energies @xmath92 results in more representative pictures .",

    "all of the following results are obtained essentially by applying the intermediate value theorem to @xmath102 for @xmath103 . of course",
    ", since @xmath65 blows up at critical points of @xmath71 that are not double points of @xmath47 , the hypothesis of continuity is not valid .",

    "if @xmath129 then generically the spectrum @xmath35 is tangent to ( and possibly locally coincides with ) the imaginary axis at the origin @xmath130 , while if @xmath131 then there are curves of unstable spectrum meeting the origin making nonzero angles with the imaginary axis ( this latter condition is what characterizes a strong modulational instability of the periodic traveling wave @xmath16 ) .",
    "the sign of @xmath132 also carries meaning . to see this , consider the function @xmath133 , whose roots in the @xmath21-plane given a fixed unit - modulus value @xmath134 , @xmath26 , are points of the spectrum @xmath35 corresponding to a floquet multiplier @xmath36 .",

    "corollary  [ corollary - index - product ] shows that a dynamical hamiltonian - hopf instability always occurs somewhere on the imaginary axis if either there is a strong modulational instability at the origin , or there exist an odd number of positive periodic points of @xmath35 ( but not both ) .",
    "this result is consistent with the intuition that a curve of spectrum emanating from the origin that does not intersect the real axis should intersect the imaginary axis , while a curve of spectrum emanating from the real axis that does not return to the real axis or meet the origin should intersect the imaginary axis .",
    "a result partially complementary to corollary  [ corollary - index - product ] is the following .    in the generic case that @xmath143 ( i.e. , @xmath141 ) but @xmath147 , the periodic traveling wave @xmath16 nonetheless exhibits a dynamical hamiltonian - hopf instability if there is a negative gap in the hill s spectrum @xmath47 and @xmath148 .",

    "finally , we have the following .    a superluminal ( i.e. , @xmath150 ) periodic traveling wave @xmath16 has at least two points of dynamical hamiltonian - hopf instability on the positive imaginary @xmath21-axis for each open gap of @xmath47 with @xmath51 sufficiently negative .",
    "this is a consequence of lemma  [ lemma - negative - gap ] and lemma  [ lemma - negative - asymptotic ] .",
    "the gaps become very small as @xmath114 , but each open gap contains a point at which @xmath151 , while on either side of each of these points the asymptotic formula shows that @xmath104 is negative if @xmath150 .",
    "therefore , there are two roots of @xmath80 near each ( small ) open gap in @xmath47 if @xmath103 is large enough in magnitude , with one root lying in each surrounding band of @xmath47 , and the desired result follows from theorem  [ theorem - hh - characterize ] .",

    "<S> we study the unstable spectrum close to the imaginary axis for the linearization of the nonlinear klein - gordon equation about a periodic traveling wave in a co - moving frame . </S>",
    "<S> we define dynamical hamiltonian - hopf instabilities as points in the stable spectrum that are accumulation points for unstable spectrum , and show how they can be determined from the knowledge of the discriminant of an associated hill s equation . </S>",
    "<S> this result allows us to give simple criteria for the existence of dynamical hamiltonian - hopf instabilities in terms of instability indices previously shown to be useful in stability analysis of periodic traveling waves . </S>"
