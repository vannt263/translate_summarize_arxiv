    "mimo is in general helpful for improving the multiplexing gain .",
    "however , in los channels , e.g. , roof - top antennas , it is more challenging to achieve a higher multiplexing gain since regardless of the number of antennas the multiplexing gain can only be one in a point - to - point setup due to the key hole effect .",
    "polarization can increase the dof in this situation .",
    "it can provide two - fold increase in the dof in a los environment . in  @xcite , the authors showed that up to @xmath8 dof can be obtained by using a single polarimetric antenna in a scattering environment . in  @xcite , the multiplicative gain in dof was studied for different array geometry when polarimetric antennas are used .",
    "the results showed that the multiplicative gain from polarization depends on the array geometry and the scattering condition .    in this paper , we focus on the muxg of the fully connected @xmath0-user los ic .",
    "we propose a new interference cancellation scheme using the polarimetric antenna studied in  @xcite ,  @xcite . due to the key hole effect",

    "we see that electric dipoles oriented along @xmath10- and @xmath11-axis and magnetic dipole oriented along @xmath12-axis transmit horizontally polarized electric fields while the others transmit vertically polarized electric fields .",
    "clearly , the rank of this matrix is @xmath66 even though we use @xmath8 different dipole components since there are only two degrees of freedom for a fixed propagation direction .",

    "note that without polarimetric antennas we can only achieve the muxg of @xmath0 instead of @xmath2 in a los environment even if we allow to use multiple polarimetric antennas at each node .",
    "we propose two different scenarios , optimal antenna placement and fixed antenna placement .",
    "we will show the minimum antenna configuration under these scenarios , respectively .",

    "such manual adjustment of dipole direction may be feasible if node locations are exactly known and do not change . in our second scenario , fixed antenna placement , all antenna directions",
    "are fixed independent of node locations . in this scenario , we may need more dipoles than in optimal antenna placement scenario .",
    "in this section , we find minimal antenna configurations need to achieve the trivial upper bound of @xmath2 on the dof in the optimal antenna placement scenario .",
    "note that we need at least 2 dipoles per user to achieve the goal .",
    "consider the example of @xmath66-user ( @xmath71 ) case as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig 2]-(a ) .",
    "assume that all the transmitters and receivers have one electric and one magnetic dipoles that are co - located such that they are oriented along the direction of its direct link initially .",
    "in this case , the electric dipole is used to generate vertically polarized electric field , while the magnetic dipole generates horizontally polarized electric field .",
    "the key idea is based on the fact that the radiated electric field is always perpendicular to the direction of propagation , and the its magnitude is proportional to the projection of the antenna orientation to the field direction .",
    "therefore , if the dipoles of transmitters @xmath72 and @xmath66 are physically rotated by @xmath73 and @xmath74 , respectively where @xmath55 denotes the angle between transmitter @xmath37 and receiver @xmath45 , the transmitters do not radiate interfering signal to non - desired receivers .",
    "since the interference is already canceled by each transmitter , the dipoles of receivers are rotated by @xmath75 degrees to get the maximum antenna gain .",
    "it is clear that the role of the transmitters and the receivers can be swapped .",
    "then , after adjusting the orientation of each dipole properly , we have the following channel matrices @xmath76}=a^{[11]}e^{-jkr_{[11]}}\\left[\\begin{array}{cc } \\sin(\\delta\\phi_1)&0\\\\ 0&\\sin(\\delta\\phi_1 ) \\end{array } \\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath77}=a^{[22]}e^{-jkr_{[22]}}\\left[\\begin{array}{cc } \\sin(\\delta\\phi_2)&0\\\\ 0&\\sin(\\delta\\phi_2 ) \\end{array } \\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] while both @xmath78}$ ] and @xmath79}$ ] become null matrices .",
    "we see that if @xmath80 and @xmath81 , @xmath66 dof per each user can be achieved .",
    "one can see that there can be other proper antenna configurations for achieving the same muxg .",
    "suppose the first user uses one electric and one magnetic dipole that are co - located and oriented along @xmath12- and @xmath10-axis , respectively while the second user uses the same dipole set as the previous case .",

    "we can easily extend this scheme to @xmath82 by using same set of dipoles .",
    "however , since there are @xmath66 interference links per each user in this case , the dipoles of both transmitters and receivers need to be rotated in order to remove all the interferences .",
    "one proper antenna configuration for @xmath82 is depicted in fig .",

    "similar to @xmath71 case , we achieve the optimal muxg of @xmath2 by rotating dipoles properly .",
    "observe that unlike @xmath66-user case , we can not use electric or magnetic dipole oriented along @xmath12-axis since their radiation patterns are omni - directional in the azimuth plane . in summary , we have the following proposition for optimal placement .    for @xmath87 with optimal antenna placement ,",
    "the following antenna configuration at each user achieves the optimal muxg of @xmath2 .    * ( @xmath88 or @xmath89 ) + ( @xmath90 or @xmath90 )    where @xmath91 and @xmath92 denote electric and magnetic dipoles respectively , and the subscript denotes the orientation of each dipole .    when @xmath0 is greater than @xmath1 , we can select a proper subset of @xmath1 users to achieve up to @xmath8 degrees of freedom .",
    "the proposed zero forcing scheme is simple and intuitive , but we have to adjust dipole orientation physically whenever the location of either a transmitter and receiver is changed .",
    "therefore , this scheme can only be feasible if there is no mobility .",
    "furthermore , we can not use this scheme when @xmath93 . in section iv , we explain how to solve these problems by using more polarimetric antenna elements .",
    "it is easy to see that the electric ( magnetic ) dipoles oriented along @xmath10- and @xmath11-axis together can create the electric field generated from an arbitrary rotated dipole in the azimuth plane .",
    "thus , instead of rotating dipoles physically , we can obtain the same interference canceling effect by using more polarimetric antenna elements whose orientation is fixed . in this section , we focus on the case where @xmath52 .    the optimal antenna placement scheme depicted in fig . [ fig 2]-(b ) can be replaced by simple zf beam - forming scheme .",
