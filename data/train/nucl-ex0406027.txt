    "<S> experimentally , the correlation function @xmath15 is defined as @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the probability of a pair being detected with relative four - momentum @xmath18 , and @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the single particle probabilities . </S>",
    "<S> the numerator is determined directly from data , while the denominator is constructed using the standard event - mixing technique .    </S>",
    "<S> the data reported here were collected using the phobos two - arm magnetic spectrometer during rhic run ii ( 2001 ) . </S>",
    "<S> details of the setup have been previously described in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the spectrometer arms are each equipped with 16 layers of silicon sensors , providing charged particle reconstruction both outside and inside a 2 t magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> the primary event trigger was provided by two sets of 16 scintillator paddle counters , which covered a pseudorapidity range @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> details of event selection and centrality determination can be found in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the 015% most central events were used in this analysis , equivalent to @xmath22 as determined by a glauber model .    </S>",
    "<S> the details of the track reconstruction algorithm can be found in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> events with a reconstructed primary vertex position between -12 cm @xmath23 10 cm along the beam direction were selected in order to optimize vertex - finding precision , track reconstruction efficiency , and momentum resolution . only particles which traversed the entire spectrometer </S>",
    "<S> were used in the analysis . </S>",
    "<S> a @xmath24 cut on the distance of closest approach with respect to the primary vertex ( @xmath25 cm ) was then applied . </S>",
    "<S> the final track selection was based on the @xmath26 probability of a full track fit , taking into account multiple scattering and energy loss . </S>",

    "<S> were allowed per pair . </S>",
    "<S> a two - particle acceptance cut was applied to both data and background ; the criterion for pair acceptance was defined by @xmath32 rad , where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the relative pair separation in azimuthal and polar angle , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> about 7.3 million @xmath35 and 5.5 million @xmath36 pairs survive all cuts .    </S>",
    "<S> systematic errors were determined by changing two - particle acceptance cuts , cuts in azimuthal separation , random seeds used in mixed - event background generation , as well as varying the definition of `` event class '' to create background events from pairs within narrow and broad vertex ranges .    because the event - mixed background is the product of tracks from different events , </S>",

    "<S> a closed - form approximation and numerical correction for this relation was derived in @xcite for @xmath40 . for a variable @xmath41 </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath42    this prescription is nearly equivalent to the corrections applied by the ceres , star , and phenix experiments @xcite ; our results showed no significant change using either correction method . </S>",
    "<S> the method is applied iteratively , successively fitting distributions of the correlation function @xmath43 and iteratively applying the fit value @xmath44 to a new @xmath45 . </S>",
    "<S> typically 2 or 3 iterations are sufficient for convergence .    </S>",
    "<S> @xmath46 is typically fit to a gaussian source in three dimensions , the so - called bertsch - pratt parameterization @xcite , @xmath47 the correlation function was also fit to the ykp parameterization @xcite , @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the longitudinal velocity of the source and @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 the relative 3-momentum difference projected in the transverse and longitudinal directions respectively , and @xmath53 the relative difference in energy . in order to compare with lower energy , the data presented was fit in the longitudinal co - moving system ( lcms ) frame .    </S>",

    "<S> the solid line at @xmath61 represents a class of models including , but not limited to , boost invariance .    in conclusion </S>",
