    "an item of conventional wisdom in the study of critical phenomena is that the critical point behavior , including finite size scaling , is controlled by a relatively small number of features of a system , among which are the structure of the order parameter , the nature of boundary conditions , and the general properties of the interaction coupling the order parameter at different locations . in particular",
    ", it is believed that short - range interactions lead to universal critical phenomena in the case of a given system . for a non - critical @xmath2 system with periodic boundary conditions ,",
    "finite size corrections are expected to be exponentially small in the ratio @xmath3 , where @xmath1 is the smallest of the system s linear dimensions , and @xmath4 is the correlation length .",
    "this expectation holds everywhere on the phase diagram , with the possible exception of the coexistence curve , where , in certain systems , gapless spin wave excitations give rise to long - range correlations .    when interactions are long ranged ,",
    "the above expectation is subject to revision .",
    "the hallmark of a long - range interaction in the context of critical behavior is a diverging @xmath5 moment .",
    "that is , if @xmath6 is long - range , then , for some sufficiently high @xmath7 , the integral @xmath8 diverges .",
    "this diverging moment appears in the fourier transform of the interaction , @xmath9 through an anomaly in its expansion as a power series in @xmath10 . in the case of a very short range interaction ,",
    "the power series expansion is entirely in integer powers of @xmath11 .",
    "any deviation from such an expansion represents an anomaly .    that long - range interactions can alter",
    "the scaling behavior of a critical system has been known for some time @xcite .",
    "the first investigation of this phenomenon in the context of the renormalization group @xcite established that when @xmath12 for sufficiently small @xmath10 , with @xmath13 , then the critical point behavior of an interacting spin system differs fundamentally from that of a system in which the interaction is short - ranged .",
    "the upper critical dimension @xmath14 for any such @xmath2 system turns out to be @xmath15 .",
    "this has been established by renormalization group arguments in @xcite and rigorously proven in @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the lower critical dimension is @xmath16 @xcite .    in the context of critical phenomena ,",
    "the criterion for short range interactions , with respect to the leading critical behavior , is a finite second moment of @xmath6 . in terms of the power series expansion of @xmath9 ,",
    "this means that whatever anomaly exists , does not interfere with , or dominate at small @xmath10 , the first two terms in the expansion in powers of @xmath11 .",
    "that is , one can write for small @xmath10 @xmath17 where @xmath18 is asymptotically smaller than the first two terms on the right hand side of ( [ expand1 ] ) for small @xmath10 .",
    "when the interaction between the order parameter at different points in the system has a fourier transform that looks like the right hand side of ( [ expand1 ] ) , one expects that the thermodynamic critical behavior will be as predicted by standard approaches for a system whose interaction is entirely short - ranged @xcite . for finite - size @xmath2 systems with @xmath19",
    "this implies @xcite , among the other things , that the only relevant variable on which the properties of the finite system depend in the neighborhood of its bulk critical temperature @xmath0 is @xmath3 . for @xmath20 , finite - size corrections for systems having periodic boundary conditions",
    "are expected to be exponentially small in terms of @xmath3 .",
    "one assumes that for periodic boundary conditions all reference lengths , aside from the bulk correlation length @xmath4 , will lead only to corrections to the above picture .",
    "the above expectation has been challenged in recent papers by chen and dohm . in these papers , it is pointed out that a model having both short - range interactions and a sharp , wavelength - dependent cutoff of fluctuations @xmath21 , will exhibit finite size corrections to the infinite system limit that swamp those traditionally associated with finite size scaling .",
    "they demonstrate that for such a particular choice of the fluctuation cutoff function , one will observe corrections to the infinite system thermodynamic behavior going as an inverse power law in @xmath1 that do depend also on @xmath22 and not only on @xmath3 .",
    "a careful investigation of the model discussed by chen and dohm reveals that the power law contributions to the finite size corrections result from the interplay of two features of that model .",
    "the first is a sharp cutoff of fluctuations in momentum space and the second is the removal of the `` remainder '' term in ( [ expand1 ] ) , which has the effect of introducing an interaction that can not be periodic in reciprocal space .",
    "the combined effect of these two features is an effective interaction that falls off as a power law in the separation between degrees of freedom .",
    "this power - law interaction leads immediately to power - law contributions to the finite size corrections .",
    "the last result provides a natural explanation for the discrepancies between the finite - size effects that are predicted by infinite cut - off field - theoretical schemes @xcite and the finite size effects that arise in theories with a sharp cut - off .    that a sharp cutoff is essential to the appearance of power - law corrections to the infinite system limit was noted by chen and dohm in , where an example of smooth cutoff effects is also presented .",
    "the both cases of sharp and smooth cut - off are clearly distinguished in @xcite for systems with dimensionality @xmath23 .",
    "for @xmath24 they also realized a close relation between a non - exponential large - distance behavior of the bulk correlation function ( due to the sharp cut - off ) and the power - law finite size behavior above @xmath0 .",
    "nevertheless , they do not consider in any of their articles the observed power - law finite - size corrections essentially as a result of an effective long - range interaction .    in the present article we will deal only with the case when the hyperscaling holds , i.e. we will suppose @xmath19 , but definitely similar effects will be observed also above the upper critical dimension @xmath25 , which case is a subject of an intensive discussion in the literature in the last time ( see , e.g. @xcite and the literature cited therein ) .",
    "it is certainly true that the degrees of freedom of a system of spins on a lattice is represented in reciprocal space by wave vectors confined to a brillouin zone .",
    "however , the interactions between the spins have a fourier - transformed form that is periodic in the zone .",
    "that is , the momentum - space version of the interaction is not purely quadratic , but rather reproduces itself as the wave number is shifted by a reciprocal lattice vector .",
    "such interactions do not give rise to the non - scaling terms obtained by chen and dohm .",
    "an alternative source of the fluctuation cutoff is a fermi surface .",
    "however , while the fermi surface is a natural construct in the case of non - interacting fermions , it is hard to imagine a property of any actual system that allows bose excitations to be freely occupied in one regime of wave - vector space and that forbids the occupation of those excitations in an immediately adjoining neighborhood .",
    "no specific scenario leading to this behavior has yet been proposed , at least to our knowledge .",
    "to recapitulate , the two elements that are required to obtain the results of chen and dohm are , first , an interaction appropriate to a spin system in a continuum , and , second , a sharp cutoff in the fluctuation spectrum that mimics either the effect of a fermi surface at @xmath26 , or a brillouin zone . in appendices",
    "[ app : cutoff ] , [ app : truncation ] and [ app : soft ] , we explore the interplay of these two elements .",
    "we demonstrate that neither one alone suffices to to give rise to the effective long - range interaction that leads to a violation of finite size scaling .",
    "appendix [ app : derivation ] supplies details of the analysis of chen and dohm that are central to the derivation of their predictions in terms of violation of finite size scaling .",
    "these details which are missing from their papers , are intended as an aid to those interested in a critical study of the basis for their results .",
    "the authors of this work wish to note that they are in full agreement with the mathematical conclusions drawn by chen and dohm .",
    "regardless of the relevance of their particular model to either physical reality or the fictitious , but nevertheless physically meaningful , world of simulations , chen and dohm have raised an interesting point .",
    "what can one reasonably expect to occur when interactions are intrinsically long - range , even if the range of the interactions is not sufficiently great to alter the asymptotic critical behavior of the system in question ? will these `` subleading '' long - range interactions inevitably alter the sorts of finite size effects that are naively expected to be present in finite systems with short - range interactions and periodic , or , indeed , arbitrary , boundary conditions ?    in this paper , we address this question in the context of an interaction whose fourier transform allows for the kind of small-@xmath10 expansion shown in eq .",
    "( [ expand1 ] ) .",
    "the term @xmath18 , asymptotically smaller than the first two contributions to the right hand side of that equation when @xmath10 is small , contains a component going as @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is noninteger , and @xmath29 .",
    "this means that the interaction is long range , but that @xmath30 is finite for @xmath31 .",
    "alternatively , we imagine a @xmath6 going as @xmath32 for large values of @xmath33 .",
    "such an interaction is far from unphysical .",
    "in fact , the van der waals interaction , which decays in three dimensions as @xmath34 , is consistent with @xmath35 .",
    "the explicit calculations presented in the article are for the case @xmath19 , @xmath36 where @xmath37 .",
    "we find that an interaction of this form does , indeed , give rise to interesting modifications of the critical point behavior of a spin - like system .",
    "those modifications include , but are not limited to , _ power - law finite system contributions that dominate the exponentially damped terms arising from a standard analysis of short range systems_. in other words , in contrast to the infinite systems , where the _ subleading _ terms in the interaction are producing only _ corrections _ to the thermodynamic critical behavior , for finite systems they lead to _ dominant _ finite - size contributions in a given regime .",
    "the case @xmath38 is special , in that there are logarithmic corrections to the nominally power law finite size corrections .",
    "the current understanding of the consequence of power law interactions with regard to critical point properties of an @xmath2-model spin system is fairly well - developed , but is not yet complete .",
    "assuming that the interaction is of the form @xmath39 , then there are three regimes , depending on the magnitude of positive exponent @xmath40 .",
    "first , if @xmath41 , then the critical behavior is mean - field - like . on the other hand , if @xmath29 , the behavior of the system in the immediate vicinity of the critical point is as if the interactions are short - ranged .",
    "clearly , when @xmath42 , the two regions overlap , and the critical behavior of the system is always expected to be as predicted by mean field theory . in fewer than four dimensions , the regime @xmath43 represents an intermediate case , in which the critical behavior is not necessarily dominated by either the mean field or the renormalized short - range interaction limits .",
    "this regime has been investigated for the @xmath2 model in the context of a renormalization group - based expansion in @xmath44 by fisher , ma and nickel @xcite . in the case of a one - dimensional ising system , it has been argued that when @xmath45 , the critical properties are intimately related to those of the two - dimensional @xmath46 model @xcite , in that the appropriate version of the renormalization group is in the same generic class as the equations shown to apply to the latter model by kosterlitz @xcite .",
    "the existence of a phase transition in this borderline case has been rigorously proven by frlich and spencer @xcite .",
    "later imbrie and newman @xcite presented a rigorous proof of the existence in the system of a phase in which the two - point correlation function exhibits power - law decay with an exponent that varies continuously in a finite temperature range below the critical temperature .    at this point in time , there seems to be no serious controversy on the analytical front .",
    "however , in a recently published paper bayong and diep have utilized monte carlo simulations to investigate the critical properties of an continuous ising system ( i.e. the spin variables of the model can take any value between @xmath47 and @xmath48 ) in one and two dimensions with an interaction of the form @xmath49 . they seek to determine whether the behavior of this system is consistent with predictions based on renormalization group methods and other analytical approaches . while they are able to identify trends for the critical exponents that qualitatively follow the assertions of previous investigators , the values of the exponents are not in concert with those obtained in analytical investigations .",
    "this calls into question either basic assumptions with respect to the influence of long - range interactions on critical point properties , or on the validity of monte carlo methods , at least as exploited by the authors ( e.g. for the case @xmath50 , @xmath51 rigorous mathematical proof can be presented @xcite for the absence of phase transition at finite temperature , while the authors determine the critical exponents around such a transition ) . alternatively , there is the possibility that more care and experience is needed in the way in which long range interactions are discussed analytically .",
    "for example , will the long - range interactions studied by bayong and diep induce complications in the finite size corrections that require a more sophisticated approach than was undertaken by them ?",
    "additionally worthy of mention are the results of luijten @xcite that indicate the existence of discrepancies between the renormalization group predictions for the behavior of the binder cumulant @xmath52 ( for a definition of @xmath52 see @xcite ) in a fully finite system with periodic boundary conditions at its bulk critical temperature and the numerical results for this quantity obtained by monte carlo simulations . here , the focus is a system with leading power - law interaction . as a function of @xmath53 renormalization group predicts @xcite that @xmath52 depends in a leading order on @xmath54 , i.e. in the same way as in the case of short - range systems @xcite , while numerical results @xcite suggest a linear dependence on @xmath55 .",
    "the numerical simulations have been performed for a discrete ising model with @xmath50 and @xmath56 and periodic boundary conditions .",
    "it is difficult to comment on the origin of this discrepancy ",
    "one is tempted to suggest a more careful analysis of the numerical data , despite the fact that the cluster algorithm @xcite used by luijten is able to take into account the interaction of any spin with all the other spins in the system , including the infinite sequence of images under the periodic boundary conditions . in other words , no truncation of the interaction has been enforced .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in section [ sec : model ]",
    ", we outline the general features of the model to be studied : a mean spherical model in confined to a @xmath57-dimensional hypercube of length @xmath1 per side , subject to periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the interaction contains a component with a diverging higher moment .",
    "the signature of this component is a term in the fourier transform of the interaction going as @xmath27 with @xmath58 .",
    "as there is also a term that goes as @xmath11 , the interaction is short - ranged , in that critical exponents are those associated with interactions having a finite second moment .",
    "section [ sec : eos ] contains a detailed analysis of the equation of state of this model , special attention being paid to the influence of the long - range portion of the interaction .",
    "it is found that an expansion in the strength of this contribution to the interactions between degrees of freedom in the system suffices to establish the key characteristics of the system  in particular , the finite size corrections to asymptotic critical behavior .",
    "this section provides all the mathematical detail needed to extract both the asymptotic critical behavior and the leading order corrections arising from non - leading - order long range interactions . in section [ sec : chi ] the results of section [ sec : eos ] are utilized to discuss the dependence of the isothermal susceptibility of this system on both reduced temperature , @xmath59 and system size , @xmath1 in the important regimes surrounding the critical point .",
    "the case @xmath60 is given special treatment , as in this special instance , which is relevant to a system in which van der waals interactions play a role in ordering .",
    "here , exponent `` degeneracy '' gives rise to logarithmic corrections to pure power law behavior .",
    "we find that one can easily envision situations in which corrections to scaling , in the form of contributions to the thermodynamics of a finite system that scale as @xmath1 to a non - leading power are of a magnitude comparable to the putative leading order terms .",
    "this indicates that there are circumstances in which the analysis of simulation data must be undertaken with care .",
    "in this paper , we restrict our attention to the fully finite mean spherical model . we assume a @xmath57-dimensional hypercube of length @xmath1 per side with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the boundary conditions are consistent with the way in which one sets up a model for monte carlo investigations , in that the system is finite , but lacks physical boundaries .",
    "the degrees of freedom consist of a set of @xmath61 localized spins with gaussian weight , and the hamiltonian is given by @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the position vector of the @xmath64 spin .",
    "the fourier transform of the interaction , @xmath65 is assumed to possess the following low-@xmath10 expansion @xmath66 where @xmath67 , @xmath68 , and @xmath69 .",
    "the term @xmath70 in ( [ expand2 ] ) is associated with a contribution to the real - space version of the interaction going as @xmath71 , ( in the opposite case one will have in addition some logarithmic corrections ) .",
    "note that the signs of the coefficients in the small @xmath10 expansion are chosen so as they normally appear for interactions that decay in power laws with the distance between the interacting objects - molecules or spins ( this easily can be checked , say , for the example of a one dimensional system with such an interaction ; @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 are @xmath40-dependent  for simplicity of the notations this dependence is omitted here ) .",
    "furthermore , we suppose that @xmath76 if @xmath77 , which reflects the fact that there are no competing interactions in the system we consider and that the only ground state of this system is the ferromagnetic one .",
    "of course , it would be interesting to consider such systems  say a combination between antiferromagnetic short range and ferromagnet subleading long - range interactions , but this is out of the scope of the current article .",
    "the partition function of this system is equal to the multiple integral @xmath78          \\label{partfun1}\\ ] ] supplemented by the mean spherical condition @xmath79 which can be enforced with the use of a `` lagrange multiplier '' term going as @xmath80 into the effective hamiltonian , and thence into the partition function .",
    "the spherical model equation of state then takes the form @xmath81 the phase transition in this model occurs when the combination @xmath82 takes on a value asymptotically close to zero .",
    "the difference between the equation of state in ( [ msc2 ] ) and the standard mean spherical model condition in short range systems lies in the addition of the term going as @xmath27 in the denominator on the left hand side of ( [ msc2 ] ) . in general , this term is taken to be negligible , but we will soon see that it leads to interesting effects .",
    "because we are looking at a finite model , the sum over @xmath83 in ( [ msc2 ] ) is subject to restrictions .",
    "in particular , under the assumption of a periodically continued hypercubic system of length @xmath1 per side , allowed values of @xmath83 are of the form @xmath84 , where @xmath85 is a vector with integer components .",
    "a number of methods have been developed for the evaluation of the kind of sum in the equation of state ( [ msc2 ] ) .",
    "when there is no term going as @xmath27 , the sum is quite standard , and has been performed ( neglecting the term proportional to @xmath86 ) with the use of a number of techniques , including the poisson sum formula and variants on the ewald summation trick @xcite .",
    "the addition of the non - integral power of @xmath10 into the denominator in ( [ msc2 ] ) complicates matters a bit , but adaptations of the above methods to the case @xmath87 have proven effective .",
    "appendices [ app : alternative ] and [ app : general ] outline such adaptations that incorporate also the case @xmath36 .",
    "they make use of contour integration tricks to `` map '' the summation onto the more conventional short - range one . in this paper , we make use of analytical methods based on the relationship between expressions central to the statistical mechanics of this system and well - known mathematical functions .",
    "the equation of state for the mean spherical model ( for a comprehensive review on the results available for this model see @xcite ) is @xmath88 where @xmath89 , @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 is a properly normalized external magnetic field , and @xmath94 here @xmath95 is a vector with components @xmath96 , @xmath97 , @xmath98 , in the range @xmath99 . the critical point of this system is given by @xmath100 , where @xmath101 , @xmath102 being the lattice spacing for a lattice system ( or @xmath21 is the finite cutoff of the corresponding field theory ) , and @xmath103 wherever possible we will omit the contributions that are due to the term proportional to @xmath104 . because of that we will omit @xmath105 in the remainder of the text in the symbols @xmath106 and @xmath107 . the term proportional to @xmath104 is included in ( [ wdef ] ) and ( [ bulk ] ) in order only to assure that no artificial poles will exist in the denominator of @xmath108 and in the integrand of @xmath109 at large values of @xmath10 ( we recall that @xmath110 but @xmath111 and that the propositions we made for @xmath9 guarantee that there is no real root of the equation @xmath112 ) .",

    "in this paper , we have reported the results of an investigation into the critical point properties of a finite spherical model in which interactions contain a component that is long - range , but insufficiently so to alter the asymptotic singularities of its thermodynamics  in particular the critical exponents .",
    "one can envision interactions decaying as @xmath229 , where @xmath57 is the dimensionality of the system and @xmath230 .",
    "an important example is van der waals interaction , which decays in three dimensions as @xmath34 that is consistent with @xmath231 .",

    "there are also corrections to the dependence on system size of singular thermodynamic properties at the critical point that can conceivably cloud the numerical analysis of monte carlo data , in that the corrections , while less important in an asymptotically large system , may be of the same order of magnitude in systems that are a realizable size ( see eqs .",

    "in other words the _ subleading _ long - range part of the interaction gives rise to a _",
    "dominant _ finite - size dependence in this regime .",
    "this is entirely consistent with the inherent long - range correlations that attend long - range interactions , but it goes beyond the standard finite - size scaling formulation . more explicitly , one obtains @xmath246 , while @xmath247 when @xmath248 .",
    "this asymptotic follows from the requirement the finite - size corrections to be of the order of @xmath211 in this regime , which is to be expected on general grounds and is supported from the existing both exact and perturbative results for models with _ leading _ long - range interaction included @xcite .",

    "( [ chisol1 ] ) . obviously , the existence of such power - law finite - size dependent dominant terms above @xmath0 is of crucial significance in the analysis of the monte carlo data from simulation of such systems .",
    "finally , it is worth noting that the system considered here is equivalent to an @xmath2 dimensional vector spin model in the limit @xmath250 @xcite . because of the spin - wave excitations , the bulk correlation length of such a system is identically infinite below @xmath0 ( for any @xmath2 , @xmath251 model ) . as a result the correlations decay in a power - law in this regime .",
    "the direct spin - spin interaction decays faster there , and that is why for @xmath252 we obtain no essential finite - size contributions due to the subleading term in the fourier transform of the interaction .",
