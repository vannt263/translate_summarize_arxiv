    "the inclination of galaxies has been used as a tool to infer the opacity of disk galaxies .",

    "if these effects are not corrected for , one would expect an impact on the derived properties of the galaxies .",
    "one such property is the photometric redshift ( photo-@xmath0 ) of a galaxy , because it relies on the observed colors and magnitudes ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) of the galaxy .",
    "many panoramic sky surveys will measure primarily broadband photometry of galaxies . considering how the distance to a galaxy bares its influence from the inferred properties of the galaxy to the large scale structures in the universe ,",
    "the correct estimation of the photo-@xmath0  of galaxies is of utmost importance .",
    "studies in cosmology are also impacted by the accuracy in the redshift of galaxies of various inclinations .",
    "notably , @xcite have recently constrained dark energy content with statistics of the inclination of galaxies in pairs where the redshifts are known .",
    "we therefore explore and quantify in this work  the dependence of the error in the photo-@xmath0  on the inclination of disk galaxies . among all of the hubble morphological types ,",
    "the geometry of disk galaxies deviates substantially from the spherical symmetry .",
    "one would expect a relatively large amplitude in any inclination - dependent effect .",
    "we present the sample of disk galaxies in  [ section : sample ] .",
    "we quantify the photo-@xmath0  error as a function of the inclination of the galaxies in  [ section : photozerror ] .",
    "we present approaches to correct the photo-@xmath0  and the other properties of the disk galaxies against the inclination effect in  [ section : correction ] .",
    "the galaxies in this study constitute a volume - limited sample from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in which the redshift ranges from 0.065 to 0.075   and the @xmath2-band petrosian absolute magnitude ranges from @xmath3 to @xmath4 .",
    "to construct this sample we use the same selection criteria as described in ( * ? ? ?",

    "* ) . in this work",
    "we consider instead the dr6 @xcite , because of the improved photometric calibration and the larger number of galaxies .",
    "the other main characteristic of the sample is that , in the above ranges of redshift and absolute magnitude , the distribution of the inclination of the disk galaxies is uniform ( see figure  2b of paper  i ) . as such , the properties of the galaxies are not biased from one inclination to the next .",
    "there are 6285   galaxies in total in the analysis , a  increase from dr5 .",
    "we follow paper  i  and use the @xmath2-band apparent minor to major axis ratio ( @xmath5 , or the derived parameter `` expab_r '' in the sdss ) as a proxy for the inclination of the galaxies . the uncertainty in using @xmath5  as an inclination measure",
    "is considered by simulating 2d sky projections of the disk galaxies , where each galaxy is modeled as a triaxial spheroid at various _ known _ inclinations . with the premise that the disk galaxies are nearly circular ( supported most recently by * ? ? ?",
    "* who obtained average face - on ellipticity of 0.16  for a sample of disk galaxies in the sdss ) and negligible disk scale height , not surprisingly we come to a similar conclusion as @xcite that the apparent axis ratio is a good measure for the inclination of disk galaxies .",
    "this conclusion is drawn based on the positive correlation of the simulated inclination and the apparent axis ratio .",
    "we decide to discuss the details of the simulation in a separate paper due to the limited space here .",
    "we consider inclination ranges 0.00.2 , 0.20.3 , 0.30.4 , 0.40.5 , 0.50.6 , 0.60.7 , 0.70.8 , 0.80.9 , and 0.91.0 when calculating the photo-@xmath0statistics . to follow the convention in the sdss",
    "all of the spectral energy distributions are expressed in vacuum wavelengths .",
    "the photo-@xmath0   error , z(photo)@xmath6z(spec ) , as a function of the inclination of the disk galaxies is shown in figure  [ fig : dz_vs_inclination ] .",
    "three cases are considered : in figure  [ fig : a ] the sdss photo-@xmath0  based on the template - fitting  bias @xmath7 in figure  [ fig : a ] may be a result of larger uncertainty in the colors .",

    ". while both the bias ( @xmath16= @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 ) and the root mean square ( rms = @xmath20^{2}\\right > } $ ] = @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 ) one - sigma uncertainty .",
    "] are respectively of the same order of magnitudes for all of the cases , the dependences on the inclination are noticeably different . in the template - fittingapproach the bias in the photo-@xmath0   increases from the face - on to edge - on galaxies , in such a way bias(edge - on)@xmath6bias(face - on ) = 0.036 .",
    "the photo-@xmath0   bias also changes sign with inclination , showing that it is the ensemble bias (= @xmath17 ) being minimized instead of the bias for a particular group of galaxies .",
    "the statistics of the photo-@xmath0   error in all of the inclination bins are given in table  [ table : bias ] .",
    "in contrast , the photo-@xmath0   error does not show prominent dependence with the inclination of the disk galaxies in both of the machine learning approaches ( figure  [ fig : b ] and [ fig : c ] ) .",
    "because the inclination is not included explicitly in the training procedure in both of these approaches , this lack of inclination dependence is interpreted as the success of the methods in segregating the photometry of the disk galaxies by their inclination .",
    "the inclination of the galaxies therefore _ impacts _ their observed photometry , that in turn can be _ learned _ by a machine learning approach .",
    "we investigate how the inclination of galaxies impacts their observed photometry in the next section .",
    "next , we seek to understand why the photo-@xmath0   error correlates with the inclination of the photometry of the disk galaxies .",
    "our approach is to establish the variance in the galaxy sample and its relation to the parameter(s ) of interest , or the inclination of the galaxies in the current context .",
    "the principal component analysis ( pca ) , which is adopted here , was shown to be a powerful technique for this purpose ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "pca identifies directions ( or eigenvectors ) in a multi - dimensional data space as such they represent the maximized sample variance .",
    "the lower the order of eigenvector , in this case the _ eigenspectrum _",
    "@xcite , the more sample variance it describes .",
    "after relating the sample variance with the inclination , if possible , we can examine the involved eigenspectra to explain why in the edge - on galaxies the photo-@xmath0  error is larger .",
    "the first two  eigenspectra calculated based on the photometry of the disk galaxies are shown in figure  [ fig : espec ] .",
    "the 1st   eigenspectrum resembles the mean spectrum of the galaxies .",
    "perhaps more interestingly , the 2ndeigenspectrum visually resembles the extinction curve obtained in paper  i , despite the fact that they are obtained by two completely different approaches ( pca vs. composite spectra construction ) and datasets ( the photometry vs. the spectroscopy of the galaxy sample ) .",
    "the discrepancy between the 2ndeigenspectrum and the actual extinction curve is expected to be primarily due to variance in galaxy type within our disk galaxy sample .    to confirm that the 2nd  mode represents the inclination effect to the photometry",
    ", we examine the distribution of the eigencoefficients of various orders as a function of the inclination ( figure  [ fig : ecoeff_vs_inclin_histogram ] ) .",
    "the eigencoefficients of a galaxy are the expansion coefficients of its photometry onto the eigenspectra .",
    "a clear separation is seen in the distribution of the 2nd   eigencoefficients ( @xmath24 ) between the face - on and edge - on galaxies .",
    "this separation is not seen , or as prominent , in the other orders of eigencoefficients .",
    "since the large photo-@xmath0  error occurs in edge - on galaxies , or , as inferred from figure  [ fig : ecoeff_vs_inclin_histogram ] , for galaxies with negatively large @xmath24 . in other words ,",
    "the 2nd  eigencoefficient is an _",
    "indicator _ for the inclination of the disk galaxies .",
    "going back to figure  [ fig : espec ] to examine the eigenspectra , we see that the 1st   eigenspectrum minus 2nd  eigenspectrum results in a spectral energy distribution that is _ redder _ then the first eigenspectrum , or the average galaxy spectrum .",
    "if the adopted theoretical model in the template - based photo-@xmath0   does not take account of this reddening effect in the edge - on galaxies , the model would need to be shifted to a higher - than - true redshift in order to match the redder colors of the galaxies .",
    "this situation results in an over - estimation of the photo-@xmath0 , or what is seen in figure  [ fig : dz_vs_inclination]a .",
    "we discuss approaches to correct various properties of the disk galaxies against the inclination effect .",
    "the parameters considered are the restframe magnitudes , the flux density in an arbitrary stellar population model for the galaxies , and the photo-@xmath0 .",
    "we derive the following formulae for correcting restframe magnitudes of the whole disk galaxies in the sdss @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath2 , @xmath15 , @xmath0  bands @xmath25    the underlying calculation is similar to that in paper  i , as such we fit to the relative extinction vs. @xmath5  data the following relation    @xmath26    where @xmath27 is the k - corrected absolute magnitude of a galaxy at a given inclination .",
    "this functional form is taken to be the same for all of the sdss bands , and the proportional constant @xmath28 is fitted for each band .",

    "[ eqn : restmagcorru][eqn : restmagcorrz ] , instead of the central 3-diameter area of the galaxies that were considered in paper  i. in particular , the model magnitudes ( `` modelmag '' ) from the sdss are used because they give unbiased colors of galaxies , a result of the flux being measured through equivalent apertures in all bands  @xcite . the one - sigma uncertainty for the best - fit @xmath28",

    "the corresponding reduced chi - square are 3.04 , 2.79 , 1.10 , 1.18 .",
    "the points for the relative extinction @xmath30 vs. inclination are scattered around zero and do not suggest any non - trivial functional form .",
    "we therefore do not attempt to fit the above relation in the @xmath0  band , and assign zero to the proportional constant ( eqn .",

    "[ eqn : restmagcorru][eqn : restmagcorrz ] perform well , in the sense that the resultant photo-@xmath0  are unbiased with inclination . on the other hand ,",
    "the larger chi - squares in the @xmath13and @xmath14  bands suggest that the chosen relation may not be ideal .",
    "we therefore encourage the interpolation to the actual data listed in table  [ table : relext ] when higher - accuracy corrections are required .",
    "we choose eqn .",
    "[ eqn : relext ] for the purpose of a direct comparison with literature ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , in which the powers of @xmath31 have been considered .",
    "only even integers are allowed in the power index because @xmath31 is negative for all @xmath5 values except unity . a power index of 4",
    "is confirmed to provide a bad fit to our data , and a power index of 0 contradicts the data because it gives no @xmath5 dependence .",
    "we plan to find other functional forms that may be unconventional but better describe the data .",
    "the restframe @xmath32  vs. @xmath33  color - color diagram of our disk galaxies is shown in figure  [ fig : ug_gr ] , before and after the above inclination - dependent magnitude corrections .",
    "the average and the one - sigma sample scatter of the colors of the edge - on galaxies are , before the corrections : @xmath34  ( for color @xmath32 ) , @xmath35  ( @xmath33 ) , and after the corrections : @xmath36  ( @xmath32 ) , @xmath37  ( @xmath33 ) .",
    "the before - and - after color offset is @xmath38  for both the @xmath32and @xmath33   colors .",
    "obviously , the colors of the face - on galaxies remain unchanged : @xmath39  ( @xmath32 ) and @xmath40  ( @xmath33 ) . for both colors , the offset in the systematic locations between the edge - on galaxies and the face - on ones",
    "are greatly reduced after the corrections .",
    "the 2nd - order power dependence of the relative extinction of the whole galaxies on @xmath41 agrees with that obtained by @xcite . for the center of the disk galaxies ( within 0.5 half - light radius ) , however , the extinction - inclination relation is steeper than a @xmath42 dependence ( paper  i ) .",
    "the difference likely reflects a higher extinction in the center relative to the edge of the galaxies , or an extinction radial gradient .",
    "we will investigate this finding in a separate paper .",
    "the determination of many properties of galaxies , including the photo-@xmath0 , involves fitting to the observational data a theoretical stellar population model .",
    "the model is defined by the related physical parameters , such as the stellar age and metallicity , at the correct amplitudes . in this kind of analysis , instead of correcting the observational data against the inclination effect as discussed previously",
    ", one can correct the theoretical model itself .",
    "the latter approach is at an expense of ( or / and has the merit of ) introducing the inclination of a galaxy as an extra parameter , which is to be determined simultaneously with the other properties during the minimization . given a theoretical spectrum from a stellar population model , @xmath43 , its inclined flux densities can be calculated as follows    @xmath44    where    @xmath45    is derived from the extinction curve of the disk galaxies and its variation with inclination as given in paper  i. in which ,    @xmath46    where @xmath47 is a reference inclination .",
    "the wave number @xmath48 is the inverse of wavelength , in the unit of inverse micron , @xmath49 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath50 are listed in table  4 of paper  i , where @xmath51 . in presenting this formalism",
    "we use the extinction curve and its inclination dependence from paper  i , which apply to the inner 0.5 half - light radius of the disk galaxies .",
    "extinction curves that are applicable to other parts of the galaxies , e.g. the whole galaxies , naturally can be used when required .      as presented above the machine learning approaches",
    "give photo-@xmath0which do not show prominent bias with inclination .",
    "this result is not entirely surprising , if it is seen as the success of the methods in segregating the photometry of the disk galaxies by their inclination ( see also  [ section : photozerror ] ) .",
    "here we consider the random forest  approach , the power of which in estimating the photo-@xmath0   is discussed in detail in @xcite .",
    "basically this method builds an ensemble of randomized regression trees and computes regression estimates as the average of the individual regression estimates over those trees .",
    "the trees are built by recursively dividing the training set into a hierarchy of clusters of similar galaxies .",
    "the procedure minimizes the resubstitution error in the resultant clusters ( eqn .",
    "13 of * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "we train a forest of 50  trees on 100,000   randomly selected galaxies from the sdss spectroscopic sample , and regress on our disk galaxy sample to obtain the photo-@xmath0estimates shown in figure  [ fig : c ] .    given the inclination of disk galaxies to be a parameter which modulates the variance in the photometric sample (  [ section : pca ] ) , we deduce that the implicit inclusion of the inclination during the training procedure of the random forest  method would give even better photo-@xmath0   estimates than the case where only the sdss colors are used ( i.e. , figure  [ fig : c ] ) .",
    "indeed , the photo-@xmath0   estimates improve , with the resultant bias being 0.0004   and the rms being 0.017 .",
    "the error in the photo-@xmath0   vs. inclination for this case is shown in figure  [ fig : dz_vs_inclination_2 ] .",
    "it would be interesting to see if other machine learning approaches give similar improvement .",
    "for example , although the inclination of a galaxy was not included as a training parameter in the work by @xcite , their artificial neural network   approach in principal allows for multi - parameter training .",
    "another important question is whether the magnitude corrections ( eqn .",
    "[ eqn : restmagcorru][eqn : restmagcorrz ] ) are applicable to deriving photo-@xmath0   that are unbiased with inclination . using the random forest  approach , we select from the above training sample _",
    "face - on only _ ( @xmath52 ) galaxies as our new training sample ( about 50,000  objects ) .",
    "we train on the uncorrected @xmath13-@xmath14 , @xmath14-@xmath2 , @xmath2-@xmath15 , @xmath15-@xmath0   colors of this new sample , and regress on the corrected colors of our disk galaxy sample .",
    "the color corrections are done using eqn .",
    "[ eqn : restmagcorru][eqn : restmagcorrz ] ( see appendix  [ appendix ] ) . if the corrections give correct face - on colors of the disk galaxies , these colors should be fully described by those of the face - on galaxies in the training sample , and the resultant photo-@xmath0  should be unbiased with inclination .",
    "indeed , we find no inclination dependency in the photo-@xmath0  error , as shown in figure  [ fig : dz_vs_inclination_2010dec29 ] . the bias and rms are respectively @xmath53   and @xmath54 .",
    "the reddening in the spectral energy distribution of a disk galaxy caused by its inclination , if not taken into account , impacts the accuracy of the derived photo-@xmath0 .",
    "we present several approaches to correct the respective property of disk galaxies against the inclination effect .",
    "the considered properties are the restframe magnitudes , the flux densities of an arbitrary stellar population model for the disk galaxies , and the photo-@xmath0 .",
    "we evaluate the performance of the inclination - dependent color corrections by using the accuracy of photo-@xmath0   as a diagnostics , and find that the corrections give statistically correct face - on colors of the disk galaxies .",
    "we identify the inclination of the disk galaxies to be represented by a low order pca mode of the sample , namely the 2nd  mode .",
    "the inclination therefore modulates significantly the variance in the photometric sample . by considering the first two eigenspectra ,",
    "the variance is revealed to be related to the reddening effect on the spectral energy distribution .",
    "the reddening effect leads to the aforementioned large photo-@xmath0  error .",

    "the true absolute magnitude , @xmath55 , of a totally transparent galaxy at any inclination is related to its apparent magnitude , @xmath56 , as follows      where @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 are respectively the luminosity distance of the galaxy in parsecs , the extrinsic extinction ( e.g. , the sum of the galactic and intergalactic extinctions ) , and the k - correction .",
    "we extend this formula to apply to a circular , dusty disk galaxy at an arbitrary inclination , as follows      the extinction intrinsic to the galaxy is composed of two terms , namely , the inclination - independent and -dependent extinctions @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
