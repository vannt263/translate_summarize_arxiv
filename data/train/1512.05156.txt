    "even seemingly simple binary systems such as bulk rutile tio@xmath0 pose considerable challenges . at first sight",
    ", tio@xmath0 seems to be a common semiconductor material that has been widely used in applications and intensively studied over several decades @xcite . despite this , after a second look , one quickly realizes that tio@xmath0 clearly belongs into the class of nontrivial systems mentioned above , because many of its essential parameters are poorly known . for example , the reported conduction - band effective mass in rutile varies almost two orders of magnitude @xcite .",
    "additionally , it exhibits an exceptionally large refractive index in the visible range as well as particularly strong birefringence and dispersion properties @xcite .    furthermore , rutile has highly asymmetric dielectric properties regarding different crystallographic directions with a particularly large magnitude of the low - frequency dielectric constant @xcite .",
    "this results in an exceptionally strong screening of the coulomb interaction between electrons and holes for excitons with a binding energy below or comparable to the polar phonon energies @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , optical absorption measurements @xcite near the band gap of tio@xmath0 have shown some indications of excitonic features which , however , are very controversially discussed in the literature . for example",
    ", the excitonic signatures were interpreted as a dipole - forbidden but quadrupole - allowed @xmath1 exciton @xcite , or as a weakly dipole - allowed @xmath3 exciton state @xcite .    in order to study the optical properties of rutile and to develop a general scheme that allows us to overcome the restrictions of the semiempirical models",
    ", we have to use more systematic methods to access the microscopic properties of the electronic states . here , the most widely used scheme is density functional theory ( dft ) @xcite , which has been proven to be a very efficient approach in obtaining ground - state properties for various solid - state systems , molecules , nanostructures , liquids , and molecules adsorbed on surfaces @xcite .",
    "the dft computed single - particle energies and wave functions can then be used as an input to the cluster - expansion scheme @xcite that provides first - principles level description of many - body dynamics .",
    "its strength relies on a systematic grouping of different correlations as clusters that build up sequentially in time @xcite . the cluster - expansion method is widely applied in semiconductor solid - state systems @xcite and it even can describe quantum - optical properties @xcite as well as strongly interacting bose gas @xcite quantitatively .    in this work ,",
    "we combine a dft approach with the cluster - expansion method to obtain a hybrid cluster - expansion and density - functional - theory ( ce - dft ) scheme for studying dynamical many - body quantum phenomena .",
    "we first obtain the needed coulomb and optical matrix elements via dft for the second - quantization system hamiltonian that we then use to model dynamical effects by applying the cluster - expansion scheme .",

    "prior to our work , _ ab initio _",
    "matrix elements have been used together with the semiconductor bloch equations to compute the surface exciton properties on a si surface @xcite .",
    "linear optical properties such as the absorption follow directly once the dynamics have been solved .",
    "we then apply our combined ce - dft method for rutile tio@xmath0 and study its near - bandgap optical properties by considering electric - dipole , electric - quadrupole , and magnetic - dipole light  matter interactions .",
    "we also show that the electric - quadrupole interaction is highly dependent on the propagation and polarization directions of the light .",
    "we use our microscopic results to analyze the experimentally available absorption spectra @xcite , finding a good level of agreement that allows us to identify the observed excitonic signature as a dipole - forbidden but quadrupole - allowed @xmath1 exciton .",
    "to effectively formulate the quantum kinetics of a semiconductor system via the cluster - expansion method , we start from a generic hamiltonian @xcite @xmath4 where @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) is the creation ( annihilation ) operator of an electronic state defined by the particle index @xmath7 and @xmath8 is the time - dependent electric field .",
    "this hamiltonian is uniquely defined by @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 , i.e. , by the energies of the electronic states and the matrix elements for light  matter and electron  electron interactions , respectively .    to identify these input parameters from a dft calculation , we repeat the derivation of eq .",
