    "manipulation and transport of magnetic particles at the nanometer and micrometer scales are important technological processes for biological  @xcite and biomedical applications  @xcite .",
    "magnetic microspheres are routinely used as markers for cells or larger molecules .",
    "micron - sized magnetic beads were attached to the free end of viral dna  @xcite for the direct visualization in a bright field microscope of a dna - packaging process . @xcite achieved separation of red blood cells and lymphoid cells using magnetic particles chemically bound to antibodies .",
    "@xcite achieved continuos cell sorting of magnetically labeled cells via free - flow magnetophoresis .",
    "magnetic particles can also be tagged with a fluorescent dye and followed in real time using microscopy  @xcite , and their surface can be functionalized to selectively bind to specific targets in a solution , allowing for selective separation using magnetic fields  @xcite .    since a magnetic particle in a homogenous magnetic field can not have a net translational motion , a variety of methods have been developed for the generation of inhomogeneous magnetic fields that can be used to manipulate and transport magnetic particles . @xcite and @xcite used lithography to fabricate circuits that carry electrical currents in order to generate the inhomogeneous magnetic field that is necessary for manipulating the magnetic particles .",
    "another approach relies on the deposition of discrete ferromagnetic elements .",

    "@xcite deposited elliptical magnetic elements and showed the ability to transport paramagnetic particles along the ellipses by the application of a rotating magnetic field .",
    "another technique uses ferrite garnet films  @xcite , which show patterns of alternating magnetization , and an external field that oscillates in time in order to control the transport of colloidal particles  @xcite . the pattern on a garnet film forms spontaneously and is not easily controllable . on the other hand , the deposition of small magnetic islands  @xcite ,",
    "opens up the possibility of creating structured magnetic substrates with full control of the deposition pattern .    in this light ,",
    "we carry out both kinetic metropolis monte carlo and brownian dynamics computer simulations to study the behavior of paramagnetic colloidal particles on a substrate of discrete magnetic dipoles arranged in two specific patterns , namely parallel and zigzag stripes .",
    "the patterns were inspired by those found in garnet films  @xcite , but could , in principle , also be fabricated by one of the above deposition techniques  @xcite .",
    "the field generated by a garnet film  @xcite is quantitatively different from the one produced by an array of discrete dipoles .",
    "nevertheless , we show that the differences are small and that our model shows a particle transport behavior similar to the one found experimentally on garnet films . in particular , we find that the random brownian motion of the colloidal particles is turned into a deterministic motion by an oscillating external magnetic field .",
    "we analyze the conditions that enable the deterministic motion and hence the controlled transport of the paramagnetic colloidal particles .    brownian dynamics is based on the equations of motion for overdamped particles without hydrodynamic interactions , on the other hand monte carlo",
    "reproduces the correct dynamics only under certain conditions  @xcite .",
    "the advantage of monte carlo is its higher computational efficiency with respect to brownian dynamics .",
