    "since in the standard model ( sm ) the flavor changing neutral current ( fcnc ) processes appear at the quantum level with suppression factors by small electroweak gauge coupling , ckm matrix elements , and loop momenta , they are very sensitive to probe new physics ( np ) beyond the sm which have an enhancement factor in the coupling or have tree - level fcncs .",
    "the decay of @xmath6 mesons accumulated largely at asymmetric @xmath6-factories and tevatron give an opportunity to probe np models via the rare @xmath6 decays induced by fcncs .",
    "recently , among several sources for fcncs in the @xmath6 decays , the electroweak ( ew ) penguin operators have drawn much interest .",
    "for example , the qcd penguin dominant @xmath7 decays appear to be very interesting since branching ratios ( brs ) and mixing - induced cp asymmetry allow much room for large np contribution , especially in the ew penguin sector  @xcite .",
    "most of models contributing to the ew penguin sector have a severe constraint from the @xmath8 decay .",
    "while , models such as the @xmath0 model are free from such constraints although they predict the ew penguin contributions . in order to probe such np models",
    ", one must resort to nonleptonic decays or very rare process @xmath9 .",
    "however , nonleptonic decays might be inefficient since they suffer from large hadronic uncertainties and ew penguins contributions are subdominant in nonleptonic decays .",
    "recently , d  @xcite and cdf  @xcite collaborations at fermilab tevatron have reported the first observation of the mass difference @xmath3 in the @xmath10 system which induced by the @xmath11 fcnc : @xmath12 these measurements may give strong constraints on the np models , which predict @xmath13 fcnc transitions  @xcite .",
    "in the present work , we focus on the leptophobic @xmath0 model motivated from the flipped su(5 ) or string - inspired @xmath1 models as a viable np model . in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] , we briefly introduce the leptophobic @xmath0 model .",
    "section  [ sec3 ] deals with @xmath14 decays within the leptophobic @xmath0 model .",
    "we investigate implications of @xmath3 measurements on this model in sec .",
    "[ sec4 ] and conclude in sec .",
    "in many new physics scenarios containing an additional @xmath15 gauge group at the low energy , the new neutral gauge boson @xmath0 would have a property of leptophobia , which means that the @xmath0 boson does not couple to the ordinary sm charged leptons . in flipped su(5)@xmath16u(1 ) scenario  @xcite , leptophobia of the @xmath0 boson",
    "can be given naturally because the neutrino is subject to the different representation with the charged leptons .",
    "another scenario for leptophobia can be found in the @xmath1 model with kinetic mixing , where in this model leptophobia is somewhat accidental . after breaking of the @xmath1 group , the low energy effective",
    "theory contains an extra @xmath17 which is a linear combination of @xmath18 and @xmath19 with a @xmath1 mixing angle @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "then , the general interaction lagrangian of fermion fields and @xmath0 gauge boson can be written as @xmath21 where the ratio of gauge couplings @xmath22 , and @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "since the general fermion-@xmath0 couplings depend on two free parameters , @xmath24 and @xmath25 , effectively , the @xmath0 boson can be leptophobic within an appropriate embedding of the sm particles @xcite .",
    "assuming @xmath26 in the @xmath1 model and flipped su(5 ) model , only @xmath0-mediating fcncs in the right - handed down - type quarks survive .",
    "then , one can get the fcnc lagrangian for the @xmath27 transition  @xcite @xmath28 where all the theoretical uncertainties including the mixing parameters are absorbed into the coupling @xmath29 .",
    "the coupling @xmath30 has in general cp violating complex phase , which we denote as @xmath31 .",
    "we note that the leptophobic @xmath0 boson is not well constrained by experiments including the charged leptons such as @xmath32 or @xmath33 , while the typical new physics models are strongly constrained by such experiments .",
    "in this section , we consider the @xmath34 decays in the leptophobic @xmath0 model .",
    "the @xmath35 decays are measured via the scalar or vector meson with the missing energy signal .",
    "theoretical estimates for brs of the @xmath34 decays in the sm are @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 in units of @xmath40 , respectively .",
    "while experiments by the belle and babar collaborations have reported only upper limits on brs of @xmath41 and @xmath42 decays @xcite , where the experimental bounds are about 7 times larger than the sm expectation for the @xmath43 production and much larger by an order of @xmath44 for the @xmath45 production .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     in figs .",
    "[ fig3 ] , the allowed region in ( @xmath46,@xmath31 ) plane is shown .",
    "we obtain @xmath47 for @xmath48 .",
    "this bound is about two orders of magnitude stronger than ( [ ubound ] ) obtained from exclusive semileptonic @xmath49 decays .",
    "the holes appear because they predict too small @xmath3 . for a given @xmath50 we can see that large",
    "cp violating phase can enhance the allowed coupling @xmath46 up to almost factor 10 .",
    "this shows the importance of the role played by cp violating phase even in cp conserving observable such as @xmath3 . as can be seen from fig .",
    "3(b ) , irrespective of its phase @xmath31 value @xmath51    the cp violating phase in @xmath52 mixing amplitude can be measured at lhc in near future through the time - dependent cp asymmetry in @xmath53 decay @xmath54 we note that although the final states are not cp - eigenstates , the time - dependent analysis of the @xmath55 angular distribution allows a clean extraction of @xmath56  @xcite . in the sm",
    ", @xmath56 is predicted to be very small , @xmath57 @xmath58\\right)$ ] . if np has an additional cp violating phase @xmath31 , however , the experimental value of @xmath59\\ ] ] would be significantly different from the sm prediction",
    ". constant contour lines for @xmath56 are also shown in figs .",
    "we can see that even with the strong constraint from the present @xmath3 observation , large @xmath56 are still allowed .",
    "in this talk , we have considered the leptophobic @xmath0 model with fcnc couplings . since the direct probe of the leptophobic @xmath0 model is very difficult , the exclusive @xmath60 decay are very adequate to measure the fcnc coming form this model .",
    "we have also showed that the recently measured mass difference @xmath3 of @xmath61 system can constrain this kind of models very efficiently .",
    "although the bounds on the coupling estimated from the latter are about two orders of magnitudes stronger than those from the former , both measurements are complementary .          s.  baek , p.  hamel , d.  london , a.  datta , and d.  a.  suprun , phys .",
