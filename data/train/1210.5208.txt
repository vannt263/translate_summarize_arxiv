    "( we will always take @xmath4 oriented and assume this volume form gives the preferred orientation . ) noting that @xmath5 defines a symplectic form on @xmath6 we see that a contact structure gives a reduction of the structure group of @xmath7 to @xmath8 ( more specifically choosing a complex structure @xmath9 on @xmath6 that is compatible with @xmath5 gives the reduction and one may easily check this reduction is independent of the choice of @xmath9 or @xmath2 ) .",
    "any reduction of the structure group of @xmath7 to @xmath8 , or equivalently a choice of hyperplane field @xmath10 in @xmath7 with a complex structure @xmath9 on @xmath10 , is called an and the fundamental existence question in contact geometry concerns whether or not almost contact structures always come from contact structures .    for open manifolds gromov",

    "almost contact structures are equivalent to plane fields and so all oriented 3manifolds @xmath4 admit almost contact structures .",

    "[ main ] on any closed oriented 5manifold any almost contact structure @xmath11 is homotopic , through almost contact structures , to a contact structure @xmath6 .",
    "there have been many partial results towards this theorem .",
    "the first breakthrough was due to geiges @xcite who showed that on simply connected 5manifolds any almost contact structure was homotopic to a contact structure .",
    "this result was reproven using open book decompositions by van koert in @xcite . in the papers",
    "@xcite and @xcite geiges and thomas extended the existence results to some 5manifolds with finite fundamental group . in @xcite geiges and stipsicz were able to prove existence on some other 5manifolds .",
    "the most recent breakthrough is due to casals , pancholi , and presas @xcite who proved that all possible first chern classes of almost contact structures can be realized by contact structures on 5manifolds . in particular , they established the above theorem for manifolds without 2 torsion and gave a completely general existence result ( that is any almost contact 5manifold admits some contact structure ) .",
    "( upon receiving a draft of this paper casals , pancholi , and presas have informed the author that their arguments in @xcite can be extended to obtain the main theorem above . )",
    "the proof of theorem  [ main ] involves the use of an open book decompositions of a manifold @xmath4 . in section  [ acs ]",
    "we show that every almost contact structure on a closed oriented 5manifold @xmath4 can be `` supported '' by an open book decomposition .",
    "the open book decomposition allows us to write @xmath4 as a neighborhood @xmath12 of an embedded 3manifold and its complement @xmath13 that can be expressed as a mapping torus of a 4manifold @xmath14 .",
    "we further break @xmath13 into two pieces @xmath15 and @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath16 is the mapping torus of @xmath18 .",

    "we then use work of cieliebak and eliashberg @xcite on weinstein manifolds to extend this contact structure over @xmath16 .",
    "the final extension over @xmath21 relies on eliashberg s understanding of overtwisted contact structures on 3manifolds in @xcite .",
    "we note that this proof is relatively elementary in that the two most sophisticated tools that it uses are the stable s - cobordism theorem ( when quoting quinn s result below on the existence of open book decompositions @xcite ) and a symplectic analog of the h - cobordism theorem due to cieliebak and eliashberg @xcite .",
    "we also note that most of the steps in the proof have obvious analogs in higher dimensions except the last step concerning the extension of the contact structure over the neighborhood @xmath21 of the binding @xmath22 , which relies heavily on eliashberg s understanding of overtwisted contact structures in dimension 3 .",
    "so one might hope that a similar approach would yield a general existence result in higher dimensions .",
    "this is essentially a program laid out by giroux independently from the work here , though the author does thank giroux for comments that simplified the arguments in section  [ acs ] .    in the proof of theorem  [ main ]",
    "we make the somewhat surprising observation that any 5manifold @xmath4 has a fixed open book decomposition that supports ( in a weak sense , see section  [ sec : acsobd ] ) any almost contact structure on @xmath4 and more generally any hyperplane field on @xmath4 can , in some sense , be thought of as a perturbation of the pages of the open book . for a more precise formulation of this fact",
    "see theorem  [ getall ] .",
    "this observation is also true in higher dimensions but clearly far from true for open book decompositions of 3manifolds .",
    "the intuitive explanation for this counterintuitive fact is that the pages of open books in higher dimensional manifolds have more interesting topology than those of 3dimensional open books .",
