    "data on the production of strange b mesons is rapidly accumulating . at lep",
    "the delphi collaboration has measured the probability for a @xmath3 antiquark to hadronize into a weakly decaying strange b meson @xcite .",
    "assuming the hadronization is dominated by the fragmentation of the heavy @xmath3 antiquark , we determined the fragmentation functions @xmath4 and @xmath5 from the measured total probability for a @xmath3 antiquark to hadronize into the lowest strange - beauty states @xmath6 and @xmath7 @xcite . here",
    "@xmath8 is the fraction of the @xmath3 antiquark momentum carried by the @xmath0 or @xmath1 at the scale @xmath9 .",
    "the momentum distributions of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 mesons produced in @xmath10 annihilation at the energy of the @xmath11 mass were then predicted @xcite .    here",
    "we extend our calculations to the production of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 states in @xmath2 annihilation at the tevatron , using the fragmentation functions previously determined from the @xmath10 data taken at lep .",
    "ii presents the cross section for the process in terms of the parton distribution functions and subprocesses and the fragmentation functions , which we discuss in secs .",
    "iii and iv , respectively . in sec .",
    "v we present numerical results for the transverse momentum @xmath12 distributions of the strange @xmath0 and @xmath1 mesons , as well as the total cross section for @xmath13",
    ". finally , we discuss these results and summarize our conclusions .",
    "in the parton model the cross section for the production by fragmentation of strange b mesons in proton - antiproton annihilation involves three main factors : the structure functions of the initial partons in the proton and antiproton , the subprocess in which the initial partons produce a particular parton in the final state , and the fragmentation of this final parton into the strange b meson .",
    "the transverse momentum distribution of the @xmath0 meson is then of the form @xmath14 here @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the structure functions of the initial partons @xmath17 and @xmath18 carrying fractions of the total momenta @xmath19 and @xmath20 in the proton and antiproton , respectively .",
    "the production of parton @xmath21 with momentum @xmath22 is described by the hard subprocess cross section @xmath23 at the scale @xmath9 .",
    "and @xmath24 is the fragmentation function for the parton @xmath21 to yield the meson @xmath0 with momentum fraction @xmath8 at the scale @xmath9 .",
    "the factorization scale @xmath9 is of the order of the transverse momentum of the fragmenting parton .",
    "the soft physics is contained in the structure functions , while the parton subprocess is a hard process and can be reliably calculated in perturbation theory . we shall also assume the fragmentation of @xmath3 into @xmath0 is also a hard process , an assumption that will require further discussion below , since the @xmath25 quark is not very heavy .    clearly , there is a formula very similar to eq .",
    "( [ bs ] ) for the production of the @xmath1 , which we need not write explicitly . because the radiative decay @xmath26 is so fast and the @xmath27 mass difference is so small , the transverse momentum of @xmath1 is hardly affected in the decay @xmath28 , and thus contributes to the inclusive production of the @xmath0 .",
    "we will , therefore , present each individually in the figures showing @xmath29 and @xmath30 and also include their sum in a table , for convenience .    in the fragmentation process",
    "@xmath31 we have included gluons as well as @xmath3 antiquarks . although the direct @xmath32 fragmentation process does not occur until order @xmath33 there is a significant contribution coming from the altarelli - parisi evolution of the @xmath3 antiquark fragmentation functions from the heavy quark mass to the collider energy scale @xmath34 , which is of order @xmath35 due to the splitting @xmath36 .",
    "this has been shown to be significant for the production of @xmath37 mesons @xcite and we have also included it here .",
    "in eq .  ( [ bs ] ) we have assumed a factorization scale @xmath9 , with the parton distribution functions being due to soft processes below this scale , while the parton cross sections for the subprocesses are due to hard contributions above this scale . for the parton distribution functions we used the most recent cteq version 3 @xcite , in which we chose the leading - order fit , since our calculation is also a leading - order one . for the subprocesses we used the tree - level cross sections , to be consistent , since the parton fragmentation functions , which are discussed in the following section , were calculated only to leading order . for the production of @xmath3 antiquarks we included the processes @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 , while for the production of gluons @xmath41 we included the processes @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 , where @xmath45 denotes any of the quarks , @xmath46 .    for the running strong coupling",
    "constant @xmath47 we used the simple one - loop result evolved from its value at @xmath48 : @xmath49 here @xmath50 is the number of active flavors at the scale @xmath9 and we chose @xmath51 @xcite . from the experimental results on @xmath52-quark production cross sections at the tevatron we know that there are discrepancies between the calculations and the experiments about a factor of two .",
    "therefore , adopting a more complicated form for the strong coupling constant , or using the next - to - leading order subprocess cross sections , or taking the next - to - leading order structure functions is not critical . at this point",
    ", we are primarily interested in how important the fragmentation process is for @xmath0 and @xmath1 production and how the shapes of the calculated momentum distributions compare with forthcoming data .",
    "the factorization scale @xmath9 in eq .",
    "( [ bs ] ) deserves further discussion before proceeding .",
    "the scale @xmath9 superficially appears to have been invented only to separate the production of @xmath0 mesons into structure functions , subprocess cross sections , and fragmentation functions . in principle",
    ", this is so and the production is independent of the choice of @xmath9 .",
    "but in practice , the results do depend on @xmath9 , since only if all the factors are calculated to all orders in @xmath47 will the dependence on @xmath9 cancel .",
    "however , for example , the fragmentation functions were calculated only to leading order and , consequently , the results will depend on @xmath9 .",
    "we shall investigate the sensitivity of the results to the choice of @xmath9 by varying @xmath9 from @xmath53 to @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is our central choice of the scale @xmath9 .",
    "to obtain the fragmentation functions at the scale @xmath9 we have numerically integrated the altarelli - parisi evolution equations @xcite from the scale @xmath56 , which is of the order of the @xmath52-quark mass .",
    "the evolution equations for the fragmentation functions @xmath57 and @xmath58 are @xmath59 and @xmath60 with similar , coupled equations for the @xmath1 fragmentation functions .",
    "the splitting functions @xmath61 , to leading order in @xmath62 , are explicitly given in ref .",

    "this strange - quark mass parameter @xmath81 has been determined previously @xcite using the same initial fragmentation functions from the experimental value @xcite of the probability @xmath82 for a @xmath3 antiquark to fragment into weakly decaying strange - beauty mesons : @xmath83 \\;. \\label{y}\\ ] ] since the total probability for the @xmath3 antiquark to fragment into a @xmath84 meson is independent of scale , the initial scale @xmath56 in eq .",
    "( [ y ] ) , which is of the order of the @xmath52-quark mass , was chosen to be @xmath85 as in ref .",
    "we previously found @xcite @xmath86@xmath87 mev@xmath88 based on the delphi measurement @xmath89 and assuming @xmath90 .",
    "prior to the delphi measurement there were older data from lep @xcite which were consistent with this measurement .",
    "there is now also a new measurement from cdf @xcite of the quantity @xmath91 since the total fragmentation probability @xmath92% , the corresponding value of @xmath93 can be estimated assuming @xmath94 . using the newer cdf data , eq .",
    "( [ x ] ) , we obtain @xmath95 for @xmath96% , which is consistent with the delphi measurement . in the present calculations , therefore , we used the same value @xmath97 @xcite but a slightly different value of @xmath98 @xcite . for the strange quark mass parameter",
    "we then obtain @xmath99 using the scale - independent relation eq .",
    "( [ y ] ) .",

    "( [ dz1 ] )  ( [ dz2 ] ) then has the value @xmath100 . while this value of @xmath47 is uncomfortably large we note that it only enters , together with @xmath81 and @xmath65 , in the normalization of the fragmentation functions , which has been determined empirically through eq .",
    "( [ y ] ) .",
    "the evolution equations were numerically integrated and the fragmentation functions at the scale @xmath101 were combined with the structure functions and parton cross sections for the subprocesses to obtain the cross section , eq .",
    "( [ bs ] ) . specifically , we calculated the transverse momentum distributions of @xmath0 and @xmath1 mesons produced in @xmath2 collisions at the tevatron energy @xmath102  tev .",
    "we assumed a cut - off on the transverse momentum of @xmath103 gev@xmath88 and considered only the rapidity range @xmath104 . in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we show the cross section @xmath29 for both @xmath0 and @xmath1 . to investigate the sensitivity of these results to the scale @xmath9 we have also included the results for @xmath105 and @xmath106 .",
    "when the scale @xmath9 is less than @xmath107 , which only happens for the case of @xmath106 , we chose the larger of @xmath108 . from fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] it is clear that the choice of scale @xmath9 is not critical for the transverse momentum distribution ; in fact , the variation over the range @xmath109 is comparable to the current discrepancies between the measured and calculated @xmath52 production cross sections .",
    "as one might expect , the @xmath110 cross section is larger than the @xmath111 cross section at all @xmath112 , however , their ratio is not precisely the naive prediction @xmath113 , but is about 20% smaller .    in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] we show the total cross section for the production of @xmath0 and @xmath1 mesons with transverse momentum above a minimum value @xmath114 . as in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] only the range @xmath103 gev and @xmath104 was considered .",
    "the sensitivity to the scale @xmath9 was investigated , as before , by considering @xmath106 and @xmath105 , and the choice of this scale is clearly not critical .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] provides useful estimates of the production rates of @xmath0 and @xmath1 mesons at the tevatron due to the fragmentation process . for convenience",
    ", we have also presented these cross section estimates in table  [ table ] , including the sum @xmath115 .",
    "the production rates and transverse momentum distributions for @xmath0 and @xmath1 meson production in @xmath2 collisions presented here assume that fragmentation is the dominant process and , therefore , are probably underestimates . at large enough transverse momentum",
    "the fragmentation process should dominate , as it falls off more slowly , even though it is only a part of the full order @xmath116 contribution .",
    "we also note that in our calculation the light quark fragmentation contribution is not included , since it is of even higher order in @xmath47 than the induced gluon fragmentation . at the initial heavy quark mass scale ,",
    "the light quark fragmentation function @xmath117 is of order @xmath118 for @xmath119 .",
    "but the @xmath120 has been shown @xcite to be suppressed by @xmath121 relative to @xmath4 .",
    "therefore , at the initial scale none of these light quark fragmentation functions are important .",
    "the light quark fragmentation functions might acquire a logarithmic enhancement from the evolution of the altarelli - parisi equations , but the splitting kernels @xmath122 and @xmath123 are of order @xmath47 , while @xmath124 and @xmath125 are of order @xmath126 .",
    "therefore , the most important sources of induced light quark fragmentation come from ( i ) @xmath127 , and ( ii ) @xmath128 .",
    "hence , the order of the induced light - quark fragmentation functions at the scale @xmath9 can be at most of order @xmath129 , which is suppressed by @xmath47 relative to the induced gluon fragmentation .",
    "since the induced gluon fragmentation only contributes at about the 1520% level , which is mostly due to the large gluon luminosity at low @xmath130 , the induced light - quark fragmentation contribution is expected to be very small , at the level of a few % . and",
    "thus , the light quark contribution can be safely ignored in compare with other uncertainties in the calculation .",
    "our fragmentation functions , which we used for the boundary conditions for the altarelli - parisi equations at the scale of the heavy @xmath52 quark mass , are rigorously correct in perturbative qcd if the constituent quarks are much heavier than @xmath131 ; e.g , @xmath37 mesons .",
    "also higher order qcd corrections can , in principle , be systematically calculated . in the case of the @xmath0 meson , higher order corrections in the fragmentation functions might be large due to the fact that the strong coupling constant is evaluated at @xmath132 and is equal to about 0.75 .",
    "but we fitted the parameter @xmath81 to the experimental measurement of the total probability for @xmath133 and @xmath81 turned out to be about 300 mev@xmath88 .",
    "we can , therefore , be confident of the overall normalization , which is proportional to @xmath134 .",
    "the shapes of the fragmentation functions are only moderately sensitive to the value of @xmath81 and comparing our results for the momentum distribution will , therefore , primarily test the assumption that their _ shapes _ are adequately given by perturbative qcd at the scale of the @xmath52 quark mass .",
    "our approach also appears somewhat similar to the approach used in some monte carlo programs , e.g. , pythia @xcite and herwig @xcite .",
    "however , the main difference lies in the fragmentation of the partons .",
    "the fragmentation models used in pythia or herwig are rather different in spirit from our perturbative qcd fragmentation , and is based on string fragmentation , though the actual fragmentation models used in these two monte carlo programs are somewhat different from each other . in the string fragmentation picture ,",
    "given an initial @xmath135 , it is assumed that a new @xmath136 pair may be created according to some pre - assigned probabilities such that a meson @xmath137 is formed and a @xmath138 is left behind .",
    "this @xmath138 may at a later stage pair off with a @xmath139 , and so on .",
    "the relative probabilities used in pythia to create @xmath140 pairs are set at @xmath141 , where @xmath142 are default values .",
    "this choice is based on a quantum mechanical effect and is only approximate . for example , in a paper by lusignoli et al .",
    "@xcite , in order to reproduce the @xmath37 meson production using herwig to within a reasonable range , they had to increase the probabilities of creating @xmath143 pairs in the cluster splitting .",
    "thus , this ad hoc feature of string fragmentation in these monte carlo programs makes it less predictive than our perturbative qcd fragmentation functions , because in our perturbative qcd fragmentation model the probability for @xmath144 is determined reliably once @xmath145 , @xmath81 , as well as the nonperturbative parameter of the bound - state , e.g. , the decay constant @xmath76 , are given .",
    "the string fragmentation picture is rather phenomenological since the parameter @xmath146 can be adjusted freely to fit the experimental measurements .",
    "another weakness of such a string fragmentation model is that it must assume the @xmath147 ratio of @xmath148 , from naive spin counting , while our perturbative qcd fragmentation model can reliably predict this ratio once @xmath81 is given .",
    "in fact , the ratio is slightly larger ( 20% ) than @xmath148 , as expected for a non - zero @xmath81 , in the hqet @xcite in which @xmath149 is the leading heavy quark - spin symmetry breaking effect .",
    "the comparison with forthcoming data from the fermilab tevatron should be instructive .",
