    "recently topological insulators ( tis ) attract intense theoretical and experimental studies@xcite . till now many materials are found to be tis .",
    "the properties of non - interacting tis have been well understood and some of their important properties are verified by experiments @xcite .",
    "meanwhile the effects of interactions in tis begin to be explored numerically and analytically@xcite . at the mean - field level ,",
    "the interaction can be decoupled to generate spin - orbit coupling and topological mott insulator is realized@xcite .",
    "numerical simulations using different methods obtain consistent results@xcite .",
    "the interacting topological invariant is developed using green s function and simplified formula is proposed in terms of the green s function at zero frequency or in the presence of inversion symmetry@xcite .",
    "the effects of interactions on the topological classification of free fermion systems are also studied@xcite .    by analogy with tis , models that exhibit nearly flatband with non - trivial topology are constructed in different systems , in which fractional chern insulators ( fcis ) may be realized in the absence of external magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "the phase is characterized by a multi - fold degenerate ground - states with quantized total chern number . by combining the two copies of fcis formed by spin up and down electrons , fractional tis with time - reversal symmetry",
    "can be constructed , which will be another new quantum state of matter .    in real materials , the properties are usually exhibited by electrons which are fermions , so most of the above studies are for fermions .",
    "it is also interesting to ask whether there exist similar topological phases in bosonic systems .",
    "the studies in two dimensions have appeared and the properties of hard - core bosons in the topological bands are investigated @xcite . in this paper , based on our study on the 1d interacting fermionic model @xcite , we study the behavior of hard - core bosons in 1d topological bands using exact diagonalization .",
    "we study the cases of the filling factor @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "for the case of @xmath0 , we consider on - site hubbard interaction . by calculating the energies of the lowest states , the berry phase and the fidelity metric of the ground - states , we find no sign of the existence of the bosonic topological phase .",
    "we further calculate the momentum distribution and the condensate fraction and find a sf to mott - insulator transition driven by the hubbard interaction . for the case of @xmath1 , we consider nearest - neighboring ( nn ) and next - nearest - neighboring ( nnn ) interactions .",
    "we identify the bosonic ftp whose ground - states are characterized by the three - fold degeneracy and quantized total berry phase .",
    "the obtained phase diagram is very similar to that of the corresponding fermionic system except the different critical values .",
    "finally we discuss the reason of the different behaviors of hard - core bosons at different filling factors .",
    "our starting point is the 1d interacting tight - binding model filled with hard - core bosons @xcite , @xmath2 where @xmath3 , @xmath4 are pauli matrices , @xmath5 with @xmath6(@xmath7 ) hard - core boson annihilating operator at the site @xmath8 and @xmath9 is the number operator of the orbit @xmath10 . in the fermionic version of the non - interacting model ( @xmath11 ) , depending on the values of the parameters @xmath12 , @xmath13 and",
    "@xmath14 the system can be a trivial insulator or a non - trivial insulator at half - filling .",
    "though like spinless fermion the occuping number of hard - core bosons is @xmath15 or @xmath16 per orbit on each site , the hard - core bosons obey commutation relation @xmath17 ( [ d_i , d_j^{\\dagger}])=0 $ ] at sites @xmath18 but anticommutation @xmath19 on sole site @xmath20 , which makes the hard - core bosons exhibit different properties from the fermions . in the following calculations , we focus on the parameters region where the hamiltonian eq.([eq1 ] ) at @xmath11 has non - trivial fermionic topological phase and study the properties of hard - core bosons in the interacting topological bands at different fillings .    .",
    "( b ) the berry phase and the fidelity metric vs @xmath21 .",
    "the results in bosonic ( black ) and fermionic ( red ) systems are compared .",
    "the parameters are @xmath22 , @xmath23 and the system size is @xmath24.,width=302 ]     and ( b ) @xmath25 on different sizes .",
    "the parameters are the same with those in fig.[fig1].,width=302 ]",
    "we first study the case of the filling factor @xmath0 ( we denote the number of particles as @xmath26 and the filling factor is @xmath27 ) . to characterize the possible phases and phase transitions in the system , we calculate the energies @xmath28 of the two lowest states , the berry phase @xmath29 and the fidelity metric @xmath30 of the ground - state .",
    "the berry phase is defined as @xmath31 with @xmath32 the twisted boundary phase and its value @xmath29 mod @xmath33 gets a nonzero value @xmath34 for topological phase while zero for trivial phase @xcite .",
    "the fidility metric @xmath30 is defined as @xmath35 with the fidelity @xmath36 the overlap of the two ground - state wave functions at @xmath37 and @xmath38 @xcite . when the topological band is filled with hard - core bosons , as @xmath21",
    "is increased , it shows in fig.[fig1 ] that the ground - state remains gapped and @xmath39 , @xmath40 all the way , indicating that no obvious phase transition happens .",
    "this is in contrast to the fermionic case , where the hubbard interaction @xmath21 drives a topological phase transition @xcite .",
    "so the topological property does nt persist when hard - core bosons replace the fermions . to identify the bosonic phase , we study the momentum distribution , which is defined by the formula @xcite @xmath41with the momentum @xmath42 and the average @xmath43 over the ground - state wave function .",
    "as has been known for free hopping bosons , the ground - state is a sf , which is characterized by the peak at zero - momentum state and its height strongly depending on @xmath44 . in our case of @xmath11",
    "( see fig.[fig2 ] ) , the momentum distribution shows peaks at @xmath45 and theirs heights increase with the size @xmath44 .",
    "thus the results show that the system is in a trivial sf phase at @xmath0 . when the hubbard interaction is turned on , the system is expected to experience a phase transition to the mott - insulator phase .",
    "it is from the result at @xmath25 [ see fig.[fig2](b ) ] where the momentum distribution @xmath46 tends to be uniform and its values nearly do nt change with @xmath44 . to further characterize the phases , we measure the condensate fraction @xmath47 ( @xmath48 is the total number of the hard - core bosons ) with @xmath49 ( @xmath50 ) the largest eigenvalue of the one - particle density matrix @xmath51 @xcite . in fig.[fig3 ] it shows that at @xmath11 @xmath52 scales to a nonzero value in the thermodynamic limit while at @xmath25 it scales to zero .",
    "so for small @xmath21 the system has a nonzero sf density , while for large @xmath21 the system becomes a mott - insulator .",
    "we emphasize that the study of the sf to mott - insulator transition needs scaling for systems with larger sizes , which is beyond the present method .     at @xmath53 .",
    "the parameters are the same with those in fig.[fig1].,width=302 ]",
    "next we study the case of the filling factor @xmath1 .",
    "we drop the hubbard interaction , but add nn and nnn interactions to eq.([eq1 ] ) , which writes , @xmath54where @xmath55 is the total number of hard - core bosons on site @xmath56 and @xmath57 , @xmath58 are the strength of the interactions . we have carried out the calculations at @xmath1 , and find the bosonic ftp where the ground - state is three - fold degenerate .",
    "we first glance at the phase diagram in the @xmath59 plane , which is shown is fig.[fig4 ] . by turning on @xmath57 ,",
    "the ground - state is three - fold degenerate and the bosonic ftp emerges .",
    "the ground - state is separated from higher eigenstates by a finite gap , whose value increases with the strength of @xmath57 . after turning on @xmath58 ,",
    "the value of the gap is decreased and vanishes at a critical value @xmath60 , which marks the boundary in the phase diagram .",
    "finite - size scaling shows that the bosonic ftp exists in the thermodynamic limit ( see the inset of fig.[fig4 ] ) .",
    "plane at @xmath1 for different sizes .",
    "the inset shows the finite - size scaling of the critical value @xmath60 at different @xmath61 . here",
    "@xmath22 and @xmath62 when the hamiltonian eq.([eq1 ] ) has non - trivial flatband in the fermionic case . , width=264 ]    we note that the present phase diagram is very similar to that of the corresponding fermionic system except the smaller critical values @xmath60 @xcite . in fig.[fig5](a ) , it is shown more clearly : at small @xmath63 the energies @xmath28 of the two lowest states are almost the same in the two systems , while at larger @xmath63 they are different .",
    "the main difference of hard - core bosons and fermions is the exchanging relation .",
    "so when the number of the particles is fewer , the exchanging between the particles is less possible and the hard - core bosons are more like spinless fermions . also at small @xmath63 , there is one particle within each isolated bond , thus their difference is further weakened .",
    "it is interesting that the situation is similar in two dimensions where hard - core bosons in topological band at integer filling do nt exhibit topological phase , while at fractional fillings they do @xcite .    in momentum space ,",
    "the degenerate ground - states are in different momentum sectors and are equally spaced with the interval of @xmath26 , as shown in fig.[fig5](b ) .",
    "we also calculate the total berry phase of the ground - states , which is shown in fig.[fig5](c ) .",
    "it shows that the total berry phase gets nontrivial value @xmath34 for small @xmath63 and begins to be random between @xmath64 from a critical value @xmath60 , at which the bosonic ftp is broken ( here the randomness is due to the fact that the multi - fold degeneracy of the ground - states is greater than three ) .",
    "the obtained critical value @xmath60 is in good consistent with that from the energy spectra .     at @xmath65 .",
    "( b ) the ground - state energy of each momentum sector at @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "( c ) the total berry phase vs @xmath63 at @xmath67 .",
    "the parameters are the same with those in fig.[fig4 ] except @xmath68 in ( c ) when the band slightly departs the exact flatness . here",
    "the system size is @xmath69.,width=302 ]",
    "for 1d systems bosons and fermions can be transformed into each other and there has been example showing that the topological features can be manifested by bose to fermi statistics transmutations in other 1d systems @xcite .",
    "so in the following we map hard - core bosons to spinless fermions using matsubara - matsuda and jordan - wigner transformations@xcite , to gain some insights of the different behaviors of hard - core bosons at different filling factors from the mapped fermionic model . using matsubara - matsuda transformation , the hamiltonian eq.([eq1 ] ) can be mapped to a spin-@xmath70 one with the identification @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "the two - component system can be regarded as a two - leg ladder with one component on each site@xcite . for two - leg ladders jordan - wigner transformation can be applied directly when all sites are arranged in a 1d sequence ( the zigzag path in fig.[fig6 ] ) .",
    "then we divide the ladder into two sublattices and introduce two species of spinless fermions @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "the spin operators on the two sublattices transform as : @xmath76 using the above transformation , besides the terms in eq.([eq1 ] ) the following additional terms containing @xmath77 and @xmath78 fermion operators appear : @xmath79 with @xmath80 and @xmath81 . at low fillings when there is no doubly occupying and neighboring ,",
    "these additional terms vanish , so hard - core bosons show the same behaviors with fermions . while at high fillings , these terms show their effect and answer for the absence of the topological properties at @xmath0 in hard - core boson systems .",
    "we have studied the hard - core bosons in 1d interacting topological bands at different filling factors . for the case of @xmath0 , we consider on - site hubbard interaction . by calculating the energies of the lowest states , the berry phase and the fidelity metric of the ground - states , we find no sign of the existence of the bosonic topological phase , which is in contrast to the fermionic case . to identify the phase of the ground - state",
    ", we further study the momentum distribution and the condensate fraction and find a sf to mott - insulator transition driven by the hubbard interaction .",
    "for the case of @xmath1 , we add nn and nnn interaction instead .",
    "we identify the bosonic ftp whose ground - states are characterized by the three - fold degeneracy and quantized total berry phase .",
    "we also find that the obtained phase diagram is very similar to that of the corresponding fermionic system except the different critical values .",
    "finally we discuss the reason of the different behaviors of hard - core bosons at different filling factors .",
    "though the model we study is artificial , due to the rapid development of the field of cold - atoms @xcite , it is hopeful that the model is engineered and the phases it exhibits are studied experimentally .",
