    "the dynamics of phase decoherence is central to our understanding of those physical systems whose properties depend on interference .",
    "this is particularly evident when particles are forced to propagate around closed paths ; phase coherence then makes all physical properties depend on the topology of these paths @xcite . for this reason the quantum dynamics of particles on rings has been extremely important in our understanding of quantum phase coherence .",
    "examples at the microscopic level include the energetics and response to magnetic fields of molecules @xcite , as well as charge transfer dynamics in a vast array of solid - state and biochemical systems .",
    "there is evidence now for coherent transport around ring structures even in some large biomolecules @xcite . at the nanoscopic and mesoscopic scale many ring - like structures , both conducting and superconducting @xcite ,",
    "show coherent transport around the rings , along with interesting aharonov - bohm style interference phenomena .",
    "we also note the importance of closed loop structures in quantum information processing @xcite .",
    "the interference around loops in all of these systems is very sensitive to phase decoherence .",
    "questions about the mechanisms and dynamics of this decoherence are subtle , and have led to major controversies , notably in the discussion of mesoscopic conductors @xcite",
    ". a quantitative understanding of decoherence processes in metallic systems and in superconducting `` qubits '' has yet to be attained ( in both cases local defect modes clearly make the major contribution to phase decoherence at low temperature @xmath1 @xcite ) .",
    "these controversies are examples of a wider problem : typically in solid - state systems , low @xmath1 decoherence rates are far higher in experiments than theoretical estimates based on the dissipation rates in these systems",
    ".    these problems are complex because both decoherence and dissipation rates depend strongly on which environmental modes are causing the decoherence @xcite .",
    "delocalized modes ( electrons , phonons , photons , spin waves , etc . ) can typically be modeled as `` oscillator bath '' modes @xcite . in such models",
    ", decoherence goes hand - in - hand with dissipation @xcite , in accordance with the fluctuation - dissipation theorem .",
    "however localized modes ( defects , dislocations , dangling bonds , nuclear and paramagnetic impurity spins , etc . ) , which can be mapped to a `` spin bath '' representation of the environment @xcite , behave quite differently ; indeed they often give decoherence with almost no dissipation . this is because although their low characteristic energy scale means they can cause little dissipation , nevertheless their phase dynamics can be strongly affected when they couple to some collective coordinate - this then causes strong decoherence in the dynamics of this coordinate @xcite .",
    "the fluctuation - dissipation theorem is then not obeyed @xcite , and often these localized modes are rather far from equilibrium .    at",
    "left , an 8-site ring with nearest - neighbour hopping between sites .",
    "at right a potential @xmath2 with 8 potential wells ( shown here symmetric under rotations by @xmath3 ) , depicted as a contour map ( with lower potential shown darker ) . when truncated to the 8 lowest eigenstates , this is equivalent to the 8-site model.,width=302 ]    to understand how such non - dissipative decoherence processes work , it is then useful to look at models in which the environment causes pure phase decoherence , with no dissipation . as noted above ,",
    "such models become particularly interesting when the decoherence is acting on systems propagating in closed loops. models of rings coupled to oscillator baths have already been studied @xcite .",
    "however such models , in which decoherence is inextricably linked to dissipation , do not capture the largely non - dissipative decoherence processes that dominate many solids at low @xmath1 .",
    "on the the other hand pure phase decoherence has been studied in many papers@xcite , but not , as far as we know , the rather unique phenomena occurring on a ring .    in this paper we study a model which embodies in a simple way both the closed path propagation which is generic to quantum interference processes , and which involves pure phase decoherence coming from a spin bath .",
    "the model describes a particle propagating around a ring of @xmath0 discrete sites , while coupled to a spin bath ; we assume hopping between nearest neighbors .",
    "the model becomes particularly interesting if we also have a flux @xmath4 threading the ring ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : ring ] ) .",
    "the spin bath variables are assumed to be two - level systems ( tls ) ; these are ubiquitous in solid - state systems , and are the main cause of decoherence at low @xmath1 in these systems .",
    "one can also study the problem of a continuous ring , but the discrete model is simpler , and is easily related to diverse problems like quantum walks with phase decoherence @xcite , or the dynamics of electrons in rings of quantum dots @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian we will study has the general form @xmath5\\ ] ] the operator @xmath6 creates a particle at site @xmath7 ; we assume a single particle only .",
    "the phase factors @xmath8 result from the flux @xmath4 threading the ring . in writing ( [ eq : h_phi ] ) ,",
    "we have assumed a symmetric ring , with @xmath0 sites , and assumed that the hopping matrix elements @xmath9 between sites @xmath10 and @xmath7 have simplified to a nearest - neighbour amplitude @xmath11 ( here @xmath12 denotes a sum over nearest neighbours ) .",
    "this also means we can ignore any diagonal site energies , since symmetry under rotations by angles @xmath13 means these energies are all the same .",
    "the spin bath variables @xmath14 are pauli spin-@xmath15 operators for the tls , with @xmath16 . we emphasize immediately that these bath spins are , in real situations , often not spins , but instead the 2 lowest levels of localized modes in a solid ( for example , as noted above , they could be defects or dangling bonds ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we discuss the derivation of model hamiltonians like ( [ eq : h_phi ] ) from more microscopic models , and the approximations which allow us to drop other terms that can also appear in the coupling of a ring particle to a spin bath . in section",
    "iii we discuss the dynamics of the particle in the absence of the bath - this establishes a number of useful mathematical results . in section",
    "iv we show how the dynamics of the reduced density matrix for the particle is derived in the presence of the bath , and give some results for this dynamics . in section v we analyze the dynamics of a pair of interfering wave - packets moving around the ring , showing how pure phase decoherence destroys the interference between them . finally , in section vi , we summarize our conclusions - since some of the calculations are quite extensive , readers may want to look first at this section for a guide to the main results .",
    "the more technical details of the derivations in sections iii and iv are given in an appendix .",

    "[ fig : ring ] ) . then @xmath21 is the energy of the lowest state in the @xmath7-th well , and @xmath9 is the tunneling amplitude between the @xmath10-th and @xmath7-th wells ( which we take here to be nearest neighbours ) . in path",

    "@xmath24 ( the `` bounce frequency '' ) is roughly the small oscillation frequency of the particle in the potential wells . in a semiclassical calculation ,",
    "the phase @xmath25 is that incurred along the semiclassical trajectory by the particle , moving in the gauge field @xmath26 . for a symmetric ring the site energy @xmath27 ,",
    "and we henceforth ignore it .",
    "consider now what happens when we couple the particle to a spin bath .",
    "the spin bath itself , independent of the ring particle , has the hamiltonian @xmath28 in which each tls has some local field @xmath29 acting on it , and the interactions @xmath30 are typically rather small because the tls represent localized modes in the environment .",

    "let us note how it simplifies when we assume the symmetry under rotations by @xmath13 noted above ( so that the site energy @xmath21 is dropped , and @xmath40 , with nearest - neighbour hopping only ) .",

    "the results then simplify a great deal ; @xmath62 , and @xmath63 .",
    "now let us consider the microscopic origin of this model ( ie .",
    ", before truncation to the lowest band ) .",
    "the most obvious interaction between the particle moving around the ring and a set of bath spins has the local form @xcite : @xmath64 where @xmath65 is some vector function , and @xmath66 is the position at the @xmath34-th bath spin .",
    "the diagonal coupling @xmath32 , or its linearized form @xmath67 , is then easily obtained from when we truncate to the single band form .",
    "but the term ( [ eq : h_int ] ) must also generate a non - diagonal term , which is more subtle .",
    "we can see this by defining the operator @xmath68}\\ ] ] where the particle is assumed to start in the @xmath10-th potential well centered at position @xmath69 , at the initial time @xmath70 , and finish at position @xmath71 in the adjacent @xmath7-th",
    "well at time @xmath72 ; the intervening trajectory is the instanton trajectory ( which in general is modified somewhat by the coupling to the spin bath ) .",
    "now we operate on @xmath73 with @xmath74 , to get @xmath75 where we note that both the phase @xmath76 multiplying the unit pauli matrix @xmath77 , and the vector @xmath78 multiplying the other 3 pauli matrices @xmath79 , are in general complex . in this way",
    "the instanton trajectory of the particle acts as an operator in the hilbert space of the @xmath34-th bath spin @xcite . note that one important implication of this derivation is that typically @xmath80 , in fact exponentially small , since the interaction energy scale set by @xmath81 is usually much smaller than the `` bounce energy '' scale @xmath82 set by the potential @xmath2 , ie .",
    ", the tunneling of the particle between wells is a sudden perturbation on the bath spins @xcite .",
    "detailed calculations in specific cases @xcite show that @xmath83 in this sudden regime , where @xmath84 is the change in the diagonal coupling acting between the particle and the @xmath34-th bath spin when the particle hops from site @xmath10 to site @xmath7 ( this result can be found directly from time - dependent perturbation theory in the sudden approximation ) .    from these considerations we see that , starting from a ring with the particle - bath interaction given in ( [ eq : h_int ] ) , we will end up with an effective hamiltonian for the lowest band of the form given in ( [ h - band1 ] ) , in which the non - diagonal interaction @xmath85 in ( [ spin - z ] ) has assumed a rather special form .",
    "one can in fact have a more general form for @xmath86 in the lowest - band approximation , provided one also introduces in the microscopic hamiltonian a coupling @xmath87 to the momentum of the particle .",
    "this can include various terms , including functions of @xmath88 and @xmath89 ; a detailed analysis is fairly lengthy .",
    "the main new effect of these is to generate terms in the band hamiltonian which couple the spins to the amplitude of @xmath9 as well as to its phase ; these do not appear in ( [ h - band1 ] ) .    in any case",
    ", if we know @xmath90 , @xmath91 , and @xmath92 , we can clearly then calculate all the parameters in the generic model hamiltonian , using various methods @xcite .",
    "however we are not interested here in the generic case , since our main object is to study the dynamics of decoherence in a ring model which contains only phase decoherence .",
    "we therefore make the following approximations :",
    "\\(i ) we drop the interaction @xmath30 , between bath spins ( often a very good approximation , since interactions between defects or nuclear spins are often very weak ) , and also neglect the local fields @xmath93 acting on the @xmath94 .",
    "thus we make @xmath95 .",
    "\\(ii ) we drop the momentum coupling @xmath96 entirely , and in the band hamiltonian ( [ h - band1 ] ) we drop the diagonal interaction @xmath97 .",
    "this implies that the energy of the @xmath34-th bath spin does not depend on whether the @xmath7-th site is occupied .",
    "we make this approximation ( in many cases not physically reasonable ) only because we wish to study phase decoherence without the complication of energy relaxation .",
    "\\(iii ) we assume a symmetric ring , so that @xmath98 and @xmath40 as before ; and we absorb the phases @xmath99 into a renormalization of @xmath11 ( from @xmath100 ) , and of @xmath101 ( from @xmath102 ) .",
    "the resulting model @xmath103 is then just that given in .",
    "this turns out to be explicitly solvable , and reveals some important properties of phase decoherence .",
    "we will usually assume the parameters @xmath78 are small , in line with the remarks above ( although the net effect of all of them may be very large ) , and we will also usually specialize to the case @xmath104 , consistent with a completely symmetric ring .",
    "finally , let us briefly compare with the kind of hamiltonian one would expect for a particle on a ring coupled to an oscillator bath .",
    "let us assume a set of oscillators with hamiltonian @xmath105 , where @xmath106 is again the free particle hopping hamiltonian , coupling to a set of @xmath107 oscillators with hamiltonian @xmath108 in general there will be diagonal couplings @xmath109 and non - diagonal couplings @xmath110 between particle and oscillators .",
    "we could also have a coupling to the oscillator momenta - however in this case one can make a canonical transformation@xcite which transforms this back into a coupling to the @xmath111 .",
    "typically the couplings @xmath112 .",
    "we note here that in many microscopic models of this kind , the couplings @xmath113 are actually also strong functions of temperature , either because the underlying effective hamiltonian is strongly @xmath1-dependent ( eg .",
    ", in a superconductor @xcite ) , or because the coupling to the oscillators is non - linear ( eg .",
    ", in the coupling to a soliton @xcite ) .",
    "if we restrict the problem to rotationally invariant couplings on the ring , then we can write @xmath114 x_q   \\label{v - trans}\\ ] ] where @xmath115 , @xmath116 , and the sum @xmath12 is over nearest neighbours .",
    "it is then straightforward to go through the same manipulations as in ( [ spin - z3])-([disp2 ] ) , to get a renormalised band which is a functional of the @xmath111 .    in these results",
    "there is no connection between the ring sites and the space in which the oscillators are supposed to exist .",
    "however in many cases the oscillator displacement field @xmath117 can be defined at each site @xmath7 of the ring ; the coupling then reduces to @xmath118 in which @xmath71 , @xmath119 are site vectors on the ring , and @xmath120 is now the fourier transform of @xmath117 .",
    "we first consider the dynamics of a free particle in some initial state moving on the symmetric @xmath0-site ring described by @xmath106 in , with no bath .    for this free particle the dynamics",
    "is entirely described in terms of the bare 1-particle green function @xmath121 which gives the amplitude for the particle to propagate from site @xmath122 at time zero to site @xmath7 at time @xmath123 .",
    "these paths are rather simple ( see fig . [",
    "fig : paths ] ) ; they can be labelled by the initial and final sites , and by the winding number of the path around the ring .",
    "colour online : a particular path in a path integral for the particle , shown here for an @xmath124 ring .",
    "this path , from site @xmath125 to site @xmath126 , has winding number @xmath127.,width=264 ]    the 1-particle green function can be evaluated in various ways ( see appendix ) ; the result can be usefully written as @xmath128 where @xmath129 is a sum over winding numbers . the `` return amplitude '' @xmath130 is then given by @xmath131 where in the last form we use the hyperbolic bessel function .",
    "it is often more useful to have expressions for the density matrix ; even though these depend trivially for a free particle on the green function , they are essential when we come to compare with the reduced density matrix for the particle coupled to the bath .",
    "one has , for the bare density matrix operator of the system at time @xmath123 , @xmath132 thus , suppose we have an initial density matrix @xmath133 ( where @xmath134 and @xmath135 are site indices ) , then at a later time @xmath123 we have @xmath136 where we use the einstein summation convention ( summing over @xmath137 ) .",
    "this equation defines the propagator @xmath138 for the free particle density matrix , as @xmath139    in the main text of this paper we will almost always quote results for the special case where the particle begins at @xmath140 on site @xmath125 . in the case of the free particle , this means that @xmath141 , and only the propagator matrix @xmath142 enters the results ; then we have @xmath143 in the appendix we give the results for an arbitrary initial density matrix .",
    "the evaluation of the time - dependent density matrix for the free particle turns out to be quite interesting mathematically . as discussed in the appendix",
    ", one can evaluate @xmath144 as a sum over pairs of paths in a path integral , to give a double sum over winding numbers , or else as a single sum over winding numbers .",
    "consider first the double sum form ; again , for the special case where @xmath145 ( the particle starts at the origin ) , this can be written as    @xmath146    where @xmath147 are the winding numbers ( see appendix for the derivation for a general initial density matrix ) .",
    "this form has a simple physical interpretation - the particle propagates along pairs of paths in the density matrix , one finishing at site @xmath7 and the other at site @xmath122 , and the order of each bessel function simply gives the total number of sites traversed in each path , with appropriate aharonov - bohm phase multipliers for each path .",
    "if one instead writes the answer as a single sum over winding numbers , again assuming @xmath148 , we get :    @xmath149e^{i\\phi[p'+(j'-j)/n]-ik^{}_m(j+j'-np')/2}\\   \\label{rho1}\\ ] ]    where as before the @xmath150 are the momenta of the particle eigenfunctions .",
    "the physical interpretation of this form is less obvious , but the sums are much easier to evaluate since they only contain single bessel functions instead of pairs of them .",
    "thus wherever possible we reduce double sum forms to single sums . notice that for these finite rings , the bare density matrix is of course strictly periodic in time .",
    "notice also that the diagonal elements of @xmath151 are generally periodic in @xmath4 .",
    "however , the off - diagonal elements are only periodic in @xmath152 . in contrast",
    ", @xmath153 is periodic in @xmath4 , with period @xmath154 .",
    "this latter is the quantity needed for calculating the currents , as we will see below .    from either @xmath155 or @xmath156",
    "we may immediately compute two useful physical quantities .",
    "first , the probability @xmath157 to find the particle at time @xmath123 at site @xmath7 , assuming it starts at the origin ; and second , the current @xmath158 between adjacent sites as a function of time .",
    "looking first at the probability @xmath157 , one has @xmath159 which from above can be written in double sum form as @xmath160 or in single sum form as @xmath161\\ .",
    "\\label{rho1a } \\ ] ]    one may also compute moments of these probabilities .",
    "these are not terribly meaningful for a small ring , because any wave - packet will be spread around the ring .",
    "however for a large ring they can be useful- for example , the 2nd moment @xmath162 tells us the rate at which an initial density matrix spreads in time , provided the spatial extent of the density matrix is much smaller than the ring circumference .",
    "coherent dynamics will then manifest itself as ballistic propagation of an initial wave - packet .    from these general expressions",
    "it is hard to see what is going on .",
    "to give some idea of how the probability density behaves , it is useful to then look at these results for a small 3-site ring , where the oscillation periods are quite short .",
    "one then has , for the case where the particle starts at the origin , that @xmath163 \\nonumber\\\\ & + ( \\delta^{}_{j,1}-\\delta^{}_{j,2})2\\sqrt{3}\\sum_{p=1}^\\infty j^{}_{6p-3}(2\\delta_o\\sqrt{3}t)\\sin((2p-1)\\phi)\\bigl ) \\ .\\label{pj}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in fig .",
    "[ 1 ] the return probability @xmath164 is plotted for the case @xmath124 , using ( [ pj ] ) . from the results",
    "one striking feature immediately emerges - we see that the periodic behaviour depends strongly on the flux @xmath4 .",
    "this flux dependence illustrates the way in which the flux controls the particle dynamics , by acting directly on the particle phase . in section v we will see how this also happens when one looks at interference between 2 wave - packets ; and in sections iv and v we will see how decoherence washes out the flux dependence of the particle dynamics .",
    "thus the flux dependence of the particle dynamics very effectively measures how coherent its dynamics may be .",

    "the form the influence function takes depends on what kind of averaging we do over the bath . to discuss this ,",

    "it makes sense to define a probability distribution @xmath193 over a coupling variable @xmath194 .",

    "in general the results for the dynamics of the density matrix and the current , and their dependence on the influence function , may be quite complicated .",

    "we will only consider here the simplest completely symmetric case where @xmath198 for all links @xmath199 ; and we will assume that @xmath200 for all @xmath34 , as discussed in section ii . now in the previous literature for this case of pure phase decoherence , it has been usual to define a topological decoherence parameter @xcite @xmath201 which provides a measure of the strength of the pure phase decoherence @xcite .",

    ", when we add back the local fields @xmath293 , so that the decoherence becomes temperature dependent ) , the only way that interactions can be generated between different bath spins is through their coupling to the particle itself - there is no analogue to the propagator @xmath294 .",
    "the key physical difference between this ring - oscillator bath model , and the ring coupled to a spin bath , is that in the oscillator bath system , decoherence is in a certain sense a mere side effect of the dissipation taking place each time the particle excites an oscillator . on the other hand in the spin bath model ,",
    "no such dissipation occurs , only phase decoherence .",
    "this difference is most obviously seen in the centre of mass dynamics of a particle wave - packet - for the oscillator bath model a wave - packet initially moving around the ring will dissipate centre of mass momentum ( formally this happens via the interactions between @xmath287 and @xmath295 in the influence function ) , slowly bringing it to rest . however , as we see in the next section , for a ring particle coupled to a spin bath , the centre of mass momentum of a wave - packet is completely conserved , even in the strong decoherence limit , provided the spin bath dynamics is governed by its coupling to the ring particle ( the typical case ) .",
    "this leads to some counter - intuitive features , as we now see .",
    "it is interesting to now turn to the situation where two signals are launched at @xmath140 from 2 different points in the ring .",
    "the idea is to see how the spin bath affects their mutual interference , and how , by effectively coupling to the momentum of the particle , it destroys the coherence between states with different momenta .",
    "we do not give complete results here , but only enough to show how things work .",
    "we therefore start with two - wave - packets which will initially be in a pure state , and will then gradually be dephased by the bath . in the absence of a bath",
    ", we will assume the wave function of this state to be the symmetric superposition @xmath296 where the two wave - packets are assumed to have gaussian form : @xmath297 @xmath298 where we assume the usual symmetric ring with flux @xmath4 , and @xmath299 is the wave - function normalization factor . at @xmath140 , one of the packets",

    "note that the velocity of each wave - packet is conserved , and at times such that @xmath302 , they cross each other . from ( [ psi1 ] )",
    "we see that the main effect of the flux is to shift the relative momentum of the wave - packets .",
    "it also affects the rate at which the wave - packets disperse in real space - this dispersion rate is at a minimum when @xmath303 .",

    "as one might expect , the interference between the two wave - packets is completely washed out in this strong decoherence limit .",
    "however there is also a more unexpected feature - each wave - packet now has portions moving in opposite directions to each other .",
    "the explanation is to be found by noticing that as the particle hops , at the same time causing the bath spins to make transitions , the topological phase it exchanges with the spins also changes the total phase around the ring seen by the particle .",
    "thus , from the point of view of the particle , these transitions are forcing the total flux through the ring to fluctuate , in a way which depends on the trajectory followed by the particle .",
    "this dependence , such that the changing phase is conditional on the particle path , is of course why we get decoherence .",
    "now the changing effective flux changes the particle momentum and velocity , and in the case of the pair of wave - packets here , it also changes their relative momentum .",
    "indeed , given that the transformation @xmath315 completely reverses the momentum , we see that a strong coupling to the bath spins can even cause a part of the initial wave - packets to reverse its direction .",
    "however we emphasize that the centre of mass momentum for the combined wave - packet system has _ not _ changed - the average momentum imparted to the ring particle is zero .",
    "thus , as noted in the last section , the decoherence caused by the bath is not accompanied by any net dissipation of the particle momentum , or of its energy .",
    "indeed , if a wave - packet starts off with a net angular momentum around the ring , this will be conserved , long after all coherence has been lost .    note that these results are _ not _ the same as one would get by just adding a fluctuating noise @xmath316 to the static flux",
    ". such an external noise term will also cause noise decoherence , but of a quite different form from that of the spin bath decoherence discussed here , since there is no correlation between the noise and the particle dynamics .",
    "in fact , as we will discuss elsewhere , a fluctuating flux noise acting on the particle causes exponential decay in time of the particle correlation functions , quite different from the power law decay typical for the present case .",

    "ii we show how the basic hamiltonian ( [ eq : h_phi ] ) we have studied can be derived , including the fairly severe approximations that are involved .",
    "no attempt is made to connect the model with any specific physical system , since the main focus of this paper is to study pure phase decoherence in a solvable model .",
    "the most important features of the model are that ( i ) the spin bath which couples to the model can cause severe phase decoherence with no dissipation , and ( ii ) the phase interference in the ring ( including aharonov - bohm oscillations ) is affected in a rather fascinating way by the decoherence ; and ( iii ) the model can be solved exactly .",
    "the main tasks we set ourselves in this paper were to set up a formal apparatus to solve this model , and to study some aspects of the decoherence dynamics in it .    before studying the decoherence",
    ", it turns out to be important to develop the detailed solution for the dynamics of the @xmath0-site ring without the bath , in section iii - to our surprise , this does not seem to have been done before .",
    "it is convenient to develop the free particle density matrix @xmath317 and its propagator @xmath318 as double sums over winding numbers around the ring ( see eqtn .",
    "( [ rho - oa ] ) for the propagator ) ; but we also show how this can be rewritten as a single sum over winding numbers ( see eqtn .",
    "( [ rho1b ] ) , a form more useful for numerical work on large rings .",
    "the importance of the work on the free particle problem is seen in the result ( [ k - f ] ) for the propagator @xmath319 of the reduced density matrix once one integrates out the spin bath - we can find this by summing over winding numbers an expression involving matrix elements of @xmath318 and a weighting function @xmath189 , the influence function .",
    "the influence function can be found exactly ( appendix a.2 ) ; we do this both for the case where the couplings between the particle and the bath spins are fixed , and the case where we make an ensemble average over these couplings .",
    "this allows us to derive a whole series of exact expressions for the propagator @xmath319 ( see appendix a.2 , eqtns .",

    "the characteristics of the decoherence are controlled by these .",
    "it turns out that the decoherence dynamics , and how it affects different physical quantities , depends on the ring size @xmath0 , the flux @xmath4 , and the form of the function @xmath204 ; and also on the initial state of the system .",
    "a full exploration of this large parameter space would take a lot of space , so we have focussed on certain questions .",
    "one of these is the flux dependence of the various physical quantities , and how phase decoherence affects these - how this works is shown in section iv , with details given for a 3-site ring .",
    "we also look at the interference of 2 wave - packets on a large ring , in section v. this of course depends crucially on the flux , and as we switch on decoherence , this flux dependence disappears , even though the wave - packets still propagate ( although the coupling to the spin bath also strongly distorts the shape of the wave - packets ) . in all cases",
    "we find that the detailed dynamics is quite different from what one would get if the decoherence was simulated by adding flux noise to the problem - in particular , all coherence properties show power law decay in time , instead of exponential decay .    because of the size of the parameter space",
    ", there is much that is unexplored in this paper - in particular , we expect the decoherence dynamics , and its dependence on flux , to depend very dramatically on the form of @xmath204 ; and we have hardly explored the dependence on ring size . nor have we attempted any connection to experiment .",
    "the main reason for this is that for a detailed comparison with experiments on most real systems one has to add two crucial ingredients , viz .",
    "( i ) we must add back the local fields @xmath322 acting on the bath spins , and the diagonal couplings @xmath323 ( compare eqtns .",
    "( [ eq : h_sb ] ) and ( [ h - band1 ] ) ) ; and ( ii ) in many physical applications there are also important couplings to delocalised modes like phonons , which are modeled using oscillator bath interactions",
    ". actually one can also solve the problem when these couplings are added , in certain parameter ranges - this will be the subject of future papers @xcite .",

    "zz and pces were also supported by nserc , and pces by cifar , in canada , and aa and oe - w by the german - israeli project cooperation ( dip ) and the us - israel binational foundation .      in this appendix we derive some of the expressions for green functions and density matrices that are used in the text , and also explain some of the mathematical transformations required to go from single sums over winding number to double sums .        for this free particle the dynamics",
    "is entirely described in terms of the bare 1-particle green function @xmath326 which gives the amplitude for the particle to propagate from site @xmath122 at time zero to site @xmath7 at time @xmath123 .",
    "this can be written as a sum over winding numbers @xmath327 , viz .",
    ", @xmath328 this sum may be evaluated in various forms , the most useful being in terms of bessel functions : @xmath329 ( this last form , where we have eliminated the sum over winding numbers , is also of course directly derivable from ( [ glm2 ] ) ) .",
    "we can also write this last form as @xmath330 where we use the hyperbolic bessel function @xmath331 , defined as @xmath332 .",
    "consider now the free particle density matrix .",
    "as discussed in the main text , we have in general some initial density matrix @xmath333 at time @xmath140 ( where @xmath134 and @xmath135 are site indices ) .",
    "then at a later time @xmath123 we have @xmath334 where @xmath138 is the propagator for the free particle density matrix .",
    "its form follows directly from the definition of this density matrix as @xmath335 , where @xmath336 is the particle state vector at time @xmath123 .",
    "one thus has @xmath337        however this expression is somewhat unwieldy , particularly for numerical evaluation , because of the sum over pairs of bessel functions .",
    "it is then useful to notice that we can also derive the answer as a single sum over winding numbers , as follows : @xmath340\\sin[(k^{}_{n}-k^{}_{n'})/2 ] } \\nonumber\\\\ & = \\frac{1}{n^2}\\sum_{n , m=0}^{n-1}\\sum_{p=-\\infty}^\\infty j^{}_p[4\\delta^{}_ot\\sin(k^{}_m/2 ) ] e^{i p(\\phi / n - k^{}_{n}+k^{}_m/2)-ik^{}_n(j - l)+i(k^{}_{n}-k^{}_m)(j'-l')}\\nonumber\\\\ & = \\frac{1}{n } \\sum_{p'=-\\infty}^\\infty \\sum_{m=0}^{n-1}\\bigl ( j^{}_{np'+j'-j+l - l'}[4\\delta^{}_o t \\sin ( k^{}_m/2)]e^{ik^{}_m(l+l'-j - j'+np')/2}\\bigr ) e^{i\\phi /",
    "n ( np'+j'-j+l - l')}\\ .\\label{rho1b}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]      the result for the density matrix then depends on what is the initial density matrix , according to ( [ rho - ot2 ] ) .",
    "if we start with @xmath343 , the density matrix is then just @xmath344 .",
    "one then gets a much simpler expression ; the density matrix at time @xmath123 is : @xmath345 \\\\ & \\times e^{i\\phi(np'+j'-j)-ik^{}_m(j+j'-np')/2 }   \\label{rho-00 }   \\end{split}\\ ] ]    it is useful and important to show that the double- and single - sum expressions ( [ rho - oa ] ) and ( [ rho1b ] ) are equivalent to each other . to do this",
    "we use graf s summation theorem for bessel functions @xcite , in the form : @xmath346 we set @xmath347 , which is the @xmath348 in and multiply by @xmath349 on each side .",
    "we then have @xmath350        the propagator @xmath357 is hermitian , ie . , @xmath358 ; setting @xmath359",

    "thus we have demonstrated the equivalence of the single and double sum forms for the density matrix .      to calculate the reduced density matrix for the particle in the presence of the spin bath , we need to average over the spin bath degrees of freedom .",
    "we will do this in a path integral technique , adapting the usual feynman - vernon @xcite theory for oscillator baths to a spin bath ; the following is a generalization of the method discussed previously @xcite .",

    "the average @xmath381 is performed over environmental modes - its form depends on what constraints we apply to the initial full density matrix . in what follows",
    "we will assume an initial product state for the full particle / environment density matrix .    for the general hamiltonian in eqtns .",
    "( [ eq : h])-([eq : h_sb ] ) , the environmental average is a generalisation of the form that appears @xcite when we average over a spin bath for a central 2-level system , or `` qubit '' .",
    "the essential result is that we can calculate the reduced density matrix for a central system by performing a set of averages over the bare density matrix . for a spin bath",
    "these can be reduced to phase averages and energy averages ; and for the present case it reduces to a simple phase average .    to see this , notice that the sole effect of the pure phase coupling to the spin bath is simply to accumulate an additional phase in the path integral each time the particle hops .",
    "just as for the free particle , we can then classify the paths by their winding number ; for a path with winding number @xmath176 which starts at site @xmath134 ( the initial state ) and ends at site @xmath7 , the additional phase factor can then be written as @xmath382 and for fixed initial and final sites , this additional phase only depends on the winding number .",
    "consider now the form this implies for the reduced density matrix of the particle , once the bath has been averaged out .",
    "the equation of motion for the reduced density matrix will be written as @xmath383 where @xmath185 is the propagator for the reduced density matrix .",
    "now the key result is that @xmath384 where the function @xmath187 is the free particle propagator for fixed winding numbers @xmath147 ( see eqtn .",
    "( [ ko - kopp ] ) above ) .",
    "this form follows from the argument just given , viz .",
    ", that the only effect of the spin bath is to add the extra phase factor ( [ additonal_phase ] ) in each path in the path integral for the propagator .",
    "thus the influence functional , initially over the entire pair of paths for the reduced density matrix , has now reduced to the much simpler weighting function @xmath189 , which we will henceforth call the `` influence function '' . to evaluate this influence function , we must specify what kind of bath average we wish to take .",
    "we consider here the two cases discussed in the text , viz . ,",
    "( i ) a simple average @xmath385 over bath states , and ( ii ) an average @xmath386 over both the bath states and over a distribution @xmath387 of couplings to the bath spins .",
    "the results are obtained as follows :    \\(i ) in the case of fixed bath couplings @xmath190 , the average is obtained by simply inserting the phase factors ( [ additonal_phase ] ) from above into the paths of different winding number .",
    "we then get : @xmath388 in the symmetric coupling case where @xmath389 , this expression reduces to a much simpler result : @xmath390 where we define @xmath391 if the particle is launched from the origin , this gives the even simpler result ( [ eq : f_avg ] ) quoted in the main text",
    ".    we can now give the explicit result for the propagator of the reduced density matrix in double sum form as @xmath392 typically the average @xmath385 here will be over a set of thermally weighted states , but this is not required - in principle one could average with a non - thermal state of the bath ( or even a definite bath state , eg .",
    ", one which had been polarized beforehand - in this case no bath averaging is required at all ) . if we do assume a thermal state , then since all bath states are degenerate , and hence equally populated at any finite @xmath1 , eqtn .",
    "( [ eq : f_avg ] ) reduces to @xmath393 these results can also be written in single sum form - we do not go through the details here .",
    "both forms are fairly easily summed numerically , even for rather large rings .",
    "\\(ii ) in the case where we must also average over the distribution of bath couplings , the same phase factors appear , but now we must average over the bath spin couplings ; this gives instead @xmath394 where we put a bar over the influence function to signify an extra average over bath couplings ; again @xmath385 signifies the average over bath states , and @xmath387 is the probability weighting for the different bath couplings .",
    "typically it makes little sense , in this ensemble average , to have any dependence of the @xmath387 on the link @xmath395 , so that this reduces to @xmath396 where @xmath397 , and @xmath398 as above , and where we use the fact that the distribution @xmath399 , defined for the individual bath couplings , reduces in an ensemble average to a simple average over some coupling strength @xmath194 , with weighting @xmath400 , acting on some representative spin ( see main text , section iv.b ) .",
    "thus our explicit result for the propagator of the reduced density matrix is now @xmath401    to make this result more specific , let us assume the gaussian distribution of couplings given in the text ( eqtn .",
    "( [ f_0-bar ] ) ) .",
    "if we again assume a thermal average then we can easily evaluate this average , in the same way as in the main text , to get @xmath402   \\label{f - av2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as before , the result ( [ k - av2 ] ) can be rewritten as a single sum , and this is again fairly easily summed numerically .",
    "we note that the effect of the influence function is now to rapidly suppress paths in which @xmath403 is non - zero .",
    "now consider the current @xmath183 .",
    "again we may distinguish between the case where we average only over the bath states , and the case where we average over both the bath states and the bath couplings . in the case of a single average over bath states , with fixed couplings ,",
    "the current is given by eqs .",
    "( [ 54 ] ) and ( [ 55 ] ) , with the brackets in ( [ 54 ] ) replaced by double brackets when we average over the bath couplings as well .",
    "we see that formally everything depends only on the phase between sites @xmath7 and @xmath166 , via the bath - generated phase - dependent coupling @xmath404 , and on the density matrix element @xmath405 and its conjugate at time @xmath123 .",
    "however this apparent simplicity is deceptive , because the density matrix depends itself on the form of the initial density matrix @xmath181 at time @xmath140 , and on the propagation of this density matrix in the interim ; thus ( [ 54 ] ) contains implicitly the full propagator @xmath406 .    using the results derived above for this propagator",
    ", we can now derive expressions for @xmath183 . in what follows",
    "we only quote the results of the case of a bath average with fixed couplings - the case where one also does an ensemble average over the couplings is easily deduced from these expressions , following the same manoeuvres as above .",
