    "the cosmic acceleration has been discovered since 1998  @xcite , but we are still in the dark about the nature of this mystery .",
    "the cosmological constant proposed by einstein to build a static universe solution is the simplest dark energy model to explain the acceleration , but it suffers from the fine - tuning and coincidence problems . on the other side , current observations do not exclude definitely the time dependent evolution of dark energy , then many alternative dark energy models were proposed in the literatures , for a recent review , see  @xcite .",
    "the evolution of dark energy is determined by its equation of state ( eos ) , which can be obtained in a particular model or constructed directly from observational data . in the later case",
    ", we usually make some assumptions on the form of the eos as a parametrization for the dark energy model , then extract the information from observations .",
    "a most wildly used parametrization is called the chevallier - polarski - linder ( cpl ) model  @xcite with the form of eos as @xmath0 with redshift @xmath1 . here",
    ", @xmath2 is the present value of the eos and @xmath3 is the derivative with respect to the scale factor . comparing with the linear form @xmath4 , the cpl parametrization",
    "is well behaved and bounded at high redshifts .",
    "this is the direct motivation of proposing such a form ( [ cpl ] ) .",
    "however , the cpl form also suffers from the divergence problem when @xmath1 approaches @xmath5 , which corresponds to future evolution of the eos .",
    "this is undoubtedly a nonphysical feature , and thus it prevents the cpl parametrization from genuinely covering the scalar field models as well as other theoretical models .",
    "recently , a logarithm form @xmath6 $ ] and an oscillating form @xmath7 $ ] are proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite to overcome the shortcoming of the cpl model .    to extend parametrization of dark energy to redshifts @xmath8",
    ", we suggest two new models @xmath9 and @xmath10 which are free of divergence in the whole range of the redshift @xmath11 . clearly , model i reduce to the linear form when @xmath12 as the cpl form , while model ii will be not . actually , one can even generalize the form to a more general case while keeps the advantage of divergence - free , as long as some conditions are satisfied .",
    "we will make some discussions about it in the conclusion section , and one shall see that the forms ( [ gcpla ] ) and ( [ gcplb ] ) are the most simplest ones of this class of parametrization .    we perform a global data fitting analysis on these two divergence - free parametrization of dark energy models and",
    "constrain the parameters from the current observational data , including the full cmb power spectrum from seven - year wmap data ( wmap7 )  @xcite , the baryon acoustic oscillations ( bao ) data from sdss dr7  @xcite and union2 snia with @xmath13 samples  @xcite .",
    "when doing the analysis , we also take the perturbation of dark energy into account , because the perturbation plays a important role when one confronts the dynamical dark energy models with the current observations  @xcite . for instance , when the dark energy dominates the universe at later time in a spatial flat model , the gravitational potential due to the perturbation of dark energy becomes time - dependent , thus there will be a significant imprint on the large - scale cmb power spectra by the integrated sachs - wolfe ( isw ) effect  @xcite .",
    "we also make some analysis on this effect in this paper .",
    "we added two new parameters @xmath14 and modified the public available * cosmomc * package @xcite to satisfy these two models . during the calculation ,",
    "we run @xmath15 independent chains for each case , and we make sure the convergence of the chains by typically getting @xmath16 to be less than @xmath17 , see ref .",
    "@xcite and the readme file on the website of * cosmomc*.    this paper is organized as follows : in sec.[sec : bpe ] , we will study the background and perturbation evolutions for both models . in sec.[sec : fitting ] , we perform a global fitting to the current observational data by using the markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) method .",
    "some analysis on the isw effect of there two models are given in sec.[sec : isw ] .",
    "in the last section , we will give some conclusions and make some discussions on how to generalize these models without losing the advantage of divergence - free .",
    "as we mentioned before , the new parametrizations of dark energy ( [ gcpla ] ) and ( [ gcplb ] ) are free of divergence in the whole range of the redshift @xmath11 , especially when @xmath8 . for clearness , we list the limiting values of @xmath18 when @xmath19 in tab.[table : limit ] for the cpl model , model i and model ii .",
