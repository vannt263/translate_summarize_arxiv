    "wigner defined a quantum elementary particle as a system whose hilbert space of states carries an irreducible representation of the poincar group @xcite .",
    "this definition is a group theoretical one .",
    "this lead the author to look for a definition of a classical elementary particle by group theoretical methods , relating its definition to the kinematical group structure .",
    "a classical elementary particle was defined as a lagrangian system whose kinematical space is a homogeneous space of the poincar group @xcite .",
    "when quantising these classical models it is shown that the wave function of the system transforms with a projective unitary irreducible representation of the kinematical group @xcite .",
    "the different classical models of spinning particles produced by this formalism are collected in the book @xcite .",
    "one of the models , which will be considered in this work , satisfies dirac s equation when quantised .",
    "the latest lep experiments at cern suggest that the electron charge is confined within a region of radius @xmath0 m .",
    "nevertheless , the quantum mechanical behaviour of the electron appears at distances of the order of its compton s wave length @xmath1 m , which is six orders of magnitude larger .",
    "one possibility to reconcile these features in order to obtain a model of the electron is the assumption from the classical viewpoint that the charge of the electron is just a point but at the same time this point is never at rest and it is affected by the so called _ zitterbewegung _ and therefore it is moving in a confined region of size @xmath2 .",
    "this is the basic structure of the spinning particle models obtained within the kinematical formalism developed by the author @xcite-@xcite and also suggested by dirac s analysis of the internal motion of the electron @xcite .",
    "there , the charge of the particle is at a point @xmath3 , but this point is not the center of mass of the particle . in general",
    "we obtain that the point charge satisfies a fourth order differential equation which , as we shall see , is the most general differential equation satisfied by any three - dimensional curve .",
    "the charge is moving around the center of mass in a kind of harmonic or central motion .",
    "it is this motion of the charge that gives rise to the spin and dipole structure of the particle . in particular , the classical model that when quantised satisfies dirac s equation shows , for the center of mass observer , a charge moving at the speed of light in circles of radius @xmath4 and contained in a plane orthogonal to the spin direction @xcite .",
    "it is this classical model of electron we shall consider in the subsequent analysis and which is reviewed in section [ sec : elec ] .    in this article we shall find the group invariant dynamical equations of these classical systems .",
    "the difference of the approach presented here with the previous published works is that the dynamical equations are obtained by group theoretical arguments without any appeal to a lagrangian formalism while there they were obtained by lagrangian methods .",
    "neverteless the dynamical equations obtained are the same .",
    "the article is organised as follows : section 2 is a reminder that the most general differential equation satisfied by a curve in three - dimensional space is of a fourth order . in section 3",
    "we introduce the classical model of a spinning electron that has been shown to satisfy dirac s equation when quantised .",
    "section 4 states the general method for obtaining the group invariant differential equation satisfied by a point and for any arbitrary kinematical group .",
    "this method is applied in sections 5 to 7 to the galilei and poincar groups to obtain the non - relativistic and relativistic invariant dynamical equations of a spinless particle and of the spinning model .",
    "finally , as an application of the obtained dynamical equations , the analysis of the coulomb interaction between two spinning electrons is considered in section 8 .",
    "one of the salient features is the classical prediction of the possible existence of bound states for spinning electron - electron interaction . if two electrons have their center of masses separated by a distance greater than compton s wave length they always repel each other .",
    "but if two electrons have their center of masses separated by a distance less than compton s wave length they can form bound states provided some conditions on their relative spin orientation and center of mass position and velocity are fulfilled .",
    "let us remind that for an arbitrary three - dimensional curve @xmath5 when expressed in parametric form in terms of the arc length @xmath6 , the three orthogonal unit vectors @xmath7 , @xmath8 called respectively tangent , normal and binormal , satisfy the so called frenet - serret differential equations : @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are respectively the curvature and torsion .",
    "since the unit tangent vector is @xmath12 , taking succesive derivatives it yields @xmath13 then elimination of the @xmath7 between these equations implies that the most general curve in three - dimensional space satisfies the fourth - order differential equation : @xmath14 all the coefficients in front of the derivatives @xmath15 can be expressed in terms of the scalar products @xmath16 , @xmath17 .",
    "let us mention that for helical motions there is a constant relationship @xmath18 constant , and therefore the coefficient of @xmath19 vanishes .",
    "we present here the main features of a spinning electron model obtained through the general lagrangian formalism .",
    "the poincar group can be parameterised in terms of the variables @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is dimensionless and represents the relative orientation of inertial frames and the others have dimensions of time , length and velocity , respectively , and represent the corresponding parameters for time and space translation and the relative velocity between observers .",
    "their range is @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 but constrained to @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "one of the important homogeneous spaces of the poincar group that defines the kinematical space of a classical elementary particle @xcite is spanned by the variables @xmath20 with the same range as before but now @xmath27 restricted to @xmath28 . as variables of a kinematical space of a classical elementary system they are interpreted as the time , position , velocity and orientation observables of the particle , respectively .",
    "the lagrangian associated to this system will be a funtion of these variables and their next order time derivative .",
    "therefore the lagrangian will also depend on the acceleration and angular velocity .",
    "it turns out that as far as the position @xmath3 is concerned dynamical equations will be of fourth order .",
    "these are the equations we want to obtain in this work but from a different and non - lagrangian method . when analysed the invariance of any lagrangian defined on this manifold under the poincar group , in particular under pure lorentz transformations and rotations , we get respectively the following noether constants of the motion which have the form @xmath29 , or its essential components @xmath30 and @xmath31 in three - vector notation @xcite : @xmath32 @xmath33 observables @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the constant energy and linear momentum of the particle , respectively .",
    "the linear momentum is not lying along the velocity @xmath27 , and @xmath36 is the spin of the system .",
    "it satisfies the dynamical equation @xmath37 which is the classical equivalent of the dynamical equation satisfied by the dirac spin observable . for the center of mass observer",
    "it is a constant of the motion .",
    "this observer is defined by the requirements @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "the first condition implies that the center of mass is at rest and the second that is located at the origin of the frame .",
    "the energy of the particle in this frame is @xmath40 , so that from ( [ eq : k ] ) we get , @xmath41 it turns out that point @xmath3 , which does not represent the center of mass position , describes the motion depicted in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "it is the position of the charge .",
    "it is orthogonal to the constant spin and also to the velocity as it corresponds to a circular motion at the velocity @xmath42 .",
    "the radius and angular velocity of the internal classical motion of the charge are , respectively , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 .",
    "if we take the time derivative of the constant @xmath45 of ( [ eq : k ] ) and the scalar product with @xmath27 we get @xmath46 where we have a linear relationship between @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "dirac equation is just the quantum mechanical expression of this poincar invariant formula @xcite .",
    "the spin @xmath47 , has two parts : one @xmath48 related to the orbital motion of the charge and another @xmath49 due to the rotation of the particle and which is directly related to the angular velocity as it corresponds to a spherically symmetric object .",
    "the positive energy particle has the total spin @xmath36 oriented in the same direction as the @xmath48 part , as shown in the figure .",
    "the orientation of the spin is the opposite for the negative energy particle , which corresponds to the time reversed motion . when quantizing the system , the orbital component @xmath48 which is directly related to the magnetic moment , quantizes with integer values while the rotational part @xmath49 with half integer values , so that for spin @xmath50 particles the total spin is half the value of the @xmath51 part .",
    "when expressing the magnetic moment in terms of the total spin we get in this way a pure kinematical interpretation of the @xmath52 gyromagnetic ratio @xcite .    for the center of mass observer",
    "this system looks like a system of three degrees of freedom .",
    "two represent the @xmath53 and @xmath54 coordinates of the point and the third is the phase of its rotational motion .",
    "however this phase is exactly equal to the phase of the orbital motion of the charge and because the motion is of constant radius at the constant speed @xmath42 then only remains one independent degree of freedom .",
    "therefore the system is equivalent to a one - dimensional harmonic oscillator of frequency @xmath55 .",
    "when quantizing the system the stationary states of the harmonic oscillator have the energy @xmath56 but if the system is elementary then it has no excited states and in the c.m .",
    "frame it is reduced to the ground state of energy @xmath57 so that when compared with the classical result @xmath58 , implies that the constant classical parameter @xmath59 is necessarily @xmath60 .",
    "the radius of the internal charge motion is half compton s wave length .",
    "it is this classical model of electron we shall analyse in subsequent sections , and our interest is to obtain the dynamical equation satisfied by the point charge @xmath3 for any arbitrary relativistic and nonrelativistic inertial observer .    to end this section and with the above model in mind",
    "let us collect the main results obtained by dirac when he analysed the motion of the free electron @xcite .",
    "let point @xmath61 be the position vector on which dirac s spinor @xmath62 is defined .",
    "when computing the velocity of point @xmath61 , dirac arrives at :    1 .",
    "the velocity @xmath63=c{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\alpha$}}$ ] , is expressed in terms of @xmath21 matrices and writes , _ ",
    "@xmath64 a measurement of a component of the velocity of a free electron is certain to lead to the result @xmath65_. this conclusion is easily seen to hold also when there is a field present. 2 .",
    "the linear momentum does not have the direction of this velocity @xmath66 , but must be related to some average value of it : @xmath67 _ ` the @xmath68 component of the velocity , @xmath69 , consists of two parts , a constant part @xmath70 , connected with the momentum by the classical relativistic formula , and an oscillatory part , whose frequency is at least @xmath71 , @xmath67'_. 3 .    about the position @xmath61 : _",
    "` the oscillatory part of @xmath68 is small , @xmath67 , which is of order of magnitude @xmath72 , @xmath67'_.    and when analysing , in his original 1928 paper @xcite the interaction of the electron with an external electromagnetic field , after performing the square of dirac s operator , he obtains two new interaction terms : @xmath73 where the electron spin is written as @xmath74 and @xmath75 in terms of @xmath76-pauli matrices and @xmath77 and @xmath78 are the external electric and magnetic fields , respectively .",
    "he says , _ `",
    "the electron will therefore behave as though it has a magnetic moment @xmath79 and an electric moment @xmath80 .",
    "the magnetic moment is just that assumed in the spinning electron model ' _",
    "( pauli model ) .  _ the electric moment , being a pure imaginary , we should not expect to appear in the model .",
    "it is doubtful whether the electric moment has any physical meaning. _    in the last sentence it is difficult to understand why dirac , who did not reject the negative energy solutions and therefore its consideration as the antiparticle states , disliked the existence of this electric dipole which was obtained from his formalism on an equal footing as the magnetic dipole term . in quantum electrodynamics , even in high energy processes ,",
    "the complete dirac hamiltonian contains both terms , perhaps in a rather involved way because the above expression is a first order expansion in the external fields considered as classical commuting fields . properly speaking this electric dipole",
    "does not represent the existence of a particular positive and negative charge distribution for the electron . in the classical model , the negative charge of",
    "the electron is at a single point but because this point is not the center of mass , there exists a nonvanishing electric dipole moment with respect to the center of mass of value @xmath81 in the center of mass frame .",
    "its correspondance with the quantum dirac electric moment is shown in @xcite .",
    "i think this is the observable dirac disliked .",
    "it is oscillating at very high frequency and it basically plays no role in low energy electron interactions because its average value vanishes , but it is important in high energy or in very close electron - electron interactions .",
    "let us consider the trajectory @xmath82 , @xmath83 $ ] followed by a point of a system for an arbitrary inertial observer @xmath84 .",
    "any other inertial observer @xmath85 is related to the previous one by a transformation of a kinematical group such that their relative space - time measurements of any space - time event are given by @xmath86 where the functions @xmath87 and @xmath88 define the action of the kinematical group @xmath89 , of parameters @xmath90 , on space - time .",
    "then the description of the trajectory of that point for observer @xmath85 is obtained from @xmath91.\\ ] ] if we eliminate @xmath92 as a function of @xmath93 from the first equation and substitute into the second we shall get @xmath94 since observer @xmath85 is arbitrary , equation ( [ eq : rdet ] ) represents the complete set of trajectories of the point for all inertial observers .",
    "elimination of the @xmath95 group parameters among the function @xmath96 and their time derivatives will give us the differential equation satisfied by the trajectory of the point .",
    "this differential equation is invariant by construction because it is independent of the group parameters and therefore independent of the inertial observer . if @xmath89 is either the galilei or poincar group it is a ten - parameter group so that we have to work out in general up to the fourth derivative to obtain sufficient equations to eliminate the group parameters",
    ". therefore the order of the differential equation is dictated by the number of parameters and the structure of the kinematical group .",
    "let us consider first the case of the spinless point particle . in the non - relativistic case the relationship between inertial observers @xmath84 and @xmath85",
    "is given by the action of the galilei group : @xmath97 in the relativistic case we have that the poincar group action is given by @xmath98 for the free spinless point particle it is possible to find a particular observer , the center of mass observer @xmath99 , such that the trajectory of the particle for this observer reduces to @xmath100.\\ ] ] and therefore its trajectory for any other non - relativistic observer @xmath84 can be obtained from @xmath101 the trajectory of the point particle for the relativistic observer @xmath84 will be obtained from @xmath102 elimination of @xmath103 in terms of @xmath92 from the first equation of both ( [ eq : non ] ) and ( [ eq : rel ] ) and substitution into the second yields the trajectory of the point for an arbitrary observer , which in the relativistic and non - relativistic formalism reduces to @xmath104 elimination of group parameters @xmath27 , @xmath105 and @xmath106 by taking succesive derivatives yields the galilei and poincar invariant dynamical equation of a free spinless point particle @xmath107",
    "we take spatial units such that the radius @xmath108 , and time units such that @xmath109 and therefore the velocity @xmath110 . for the center of mass observer ,",
    "the trajectory of the charge of the electron is contained in the @xmath111 plane and it is expressed in 3-vector form as @xmath112 for the center of mass observer @xmath99 we get that @xmath113 for any arbitrary inertial observer @xmath84 we get @xmath114 we shall represent the different time derivatives by @xmath115 in this non - relativistic case @xmath116 , then , after using ( [ eq : rcm ] ) in some expressions we get the following derivatives @xmath117 therefore , the differential equation satisfied by the position of the charge of a non - relativistic electron and for any arbitrary inertial observer is @xmath118 we see that the motion is a helix because there is no @xmath119 term .",
    "the center of mass position of the electron is defined as @xmath120 because it reduces to @xmath121 and @xmath122 for the center of mass observer , so that dynamical equations can be rewritten in terms of the position of the charge and the center of mass as @xmath123 our fourth - order dynamical equation ( [ eq : r4non ] ) can be split into two second order dynamical equations : a free equation for the center of mass and a central harmonic motion of the charge position @xmath3 around the center of mass @xmath124 of angular frequency 1 in these natural units .",
    "the free dynamical equation @xmath125 is equivalent to @xmath126 , where @xmath127 is the linear momentum of the system .",
    "then our free equations should be replaced in the case of an interaction with an external electromagnetic field by @xmath128,\\quad { { \\mbox{\\boldmath$r$}}}^{(2)}={{\\mbox{\\boldmath$q$}}}-{{\\mbox{\\boldmath$r$ } } } , \\label{eq : galilei}\\ ] ] where in the lorentz force the fields are defined at point @xmath3 and it is the velocity of the charge that gives rise to the magnetic force term , while the second equation is left unchanged since it corresponds to the center of mass definition .",
    "these equations are also obtained in the lagrangian approach @xcite by assuming a minimal coupling interaction and where we get @xmath129 ,   \\label{eq : lag}\\ ] ] which reduce to ( [ eq : galilei ] ) after the center of mass definition ( [ eq : cm ] ) .    in order to determine the evolution of the system ,",
    "initial conditions @xmath130 , @xmath131 , @xmath132 and @xmath133 , i.e. , the position of point @xmath3 and its derivatives up to order 3 evaluated at time @xmath134 must be given .",
    "alternatively , if we consider that our fourth order differential equation ( [ eq : lag ] ) as the set of two second order differential equations ( [ eq : galilei ] ) , then we have to fix as initial conditions @xmath130 and @xmath131 as before and @xmath135 and @xmath136 , compatible with ( [ eq : cm ] ) , i.e. , the position and velocity of both points the center of mass and center of charge .",
    "the advantage of this method is that we shall be able to analyse the evolution of a 2-electron system in section [ sec:2elec ] in terms of the center of mass initial position and velocity .",
    "let us assume the same electron model in the relativistic case . since the charge is moving at the speed of light for the center of mass observer @xmath99 it is moving at this speed for every other inertial observer @xmath84 .",
    "now , the relationship of space - time measurements between the center of mass observer and any arbitrary inertial observer is given by : @xmath137 with the shorthand notation for the following expressions : @xmath138 @xmath139 we obtain @xmath140 @xmath141 @xmath142 @xmath143 @xmath144 @xmath145 from this we get @xmath146 from equations ( [ eq : inv2])-([eq : inv4 ] ) we can express the magnitudes @xmath147 , @xmath148 and @xmath149 in terms of these scalar products between the different time derivatives @xmath150 .",
    "the constraint that the velocity is 1 implies that all these and further scalar products for higher derivatives can be expressed in terms of only three of them .",
    "if the three equations ( [ eq : r1])-([eq : r3 ] ) are solved in terms of the unknowns @xmath27 , @xmath151 and @xmath45 and substituded into ( [ eq : r4 ] ) , we obtain the differential equation satisfied by the charge position @xmath152 @xmath153 it is a fourth order ordinary differential equation which contains as solutions motions at the speed of light .",
    "in fact , if @xmath154 , then by derivation we have @xmath155 and the next derivative leads to @xmath156 . if we take this into account and make the scalar product of ( [ eq : elecbuena ] ) with @xmath19 , we get @xmath157 , which is another relationship between the derivatives as a consequence of @xmath158",
    ". it corresponds to a helical motion since the term in the first derivative @xmath19 is lacking .",
    "the center of mass position is defined by @xmath159 we can check that both @xmath124 and @xmath160 vanish for the center of mass observer . then , the fourth order dynamical equation for the position of the charge can also be rewritten here as a system of two second order differential equations for the positions @xmath124 and @xmath3 @xmath161 a free motion for the center of mass and a kind of central motion for the charge around the center of mass .    for the non - relativistic electron we get in the low velocity case @xmath162 and @xmath163 ,",
    "the equations of the galilei case @xmath164 a free motion for the center of mass and a harmonic motion around @xmath124 for the position of the charge .",
    "the free equation for the center of mass motion @xmath125 , represents the conservation of the linear momentum @xmath126 .",
    "but the linear momentum is written in terms of the center of mass velocity as @xmath165 , so that the free dynamical equations ( [ eq : q2r2 ] ) in the presence of an external field should be replaced by @xmath166 where @xmath167 is the external force and the second equation is left unchanged because we consider , even with interaction , the same definition of the center of mass position .",
    "@xmath168 we get @xmath169 and by leaving the highest derivative @xmath170 on the left hand side we finally get the differential equations which describe the evolution of a relativistic spinning electron in the presence of an external electromagnetic field : @xmath171\\cdot{{\\mbox{\\boldmath$q$}}}^{(1)}\\right)\\right],\\\\ { { \\mbox{\\boldmath$r$}}}^{(2)}&=&\\frac{1-{{\\mbox{\\boldmath$q$}}}^{(1)}\\cdot{{\\mbox{\\boldmath$r$}}}^{(1)}}{({{\\mbox{\\boldmath$q$}}}-{{\\mbox{\\boldmath$r$}}})^2}\\left({{\\mbox{\\boldmath$q$}}}-{{\\mbox{\\boldmath$r$}}}\\right )",

    "if we have the relativistic and nonrelativistic differential equations satisfied by the charge of the spinning electrons we can analyse as an example , the interaction among them by assuming a coulomb interaction between their charges . in this way we have a system of differential equations of the form ( [ eq : galilei ] ) for each particle .",
    "for instance , the external field acting on charge @xmath172 is replaced by the coulomb field created by the other charge @xmath173 at the position of @xmath172 , and simmilarly for the other particle .",
    "the integration is performed numerically by means of the numerical integration program _",
    "dynamics solver _ @xcite .        in figure [ fig2 ]",
    "we represent the scattering of two spinning electrons analysed in their center of mass frame .",
    "we send the particles with their spins parallel and with a nonvanishing impact parameter .",
    "in addition to the curly motion of their charges we can also depict the trajectories of their center of masses . if we compare this motion with the coulomb interaction of two spinless electrons coming from the same initial position and with the same velocity as the center of mass of the spinning electrons we obtain the solid trajectory marked with an arrow .",
    "basically this corresponds to the trajectory of the center of mass of each spinning particle provided the two particles do not approach each other below compton s wave length .",
    "this can be understood because the average position of the center of charge of each particle aproximately coincides with its center of mass and as far as they do not approach each other too much the average coulomb force is the same .",
    "the difference comes out when we consider a very deep interaction or very close initial positions .    in figure [ fig3 ]",
    "we represent the initial positions for a pair of particles with the spins parallel .",
    "the initial separation @xmath174 of their center of masses is a distance below compton s wave length .",
    "we also consider that initially the center of mass of each particle is moving with a velocity @xmath175 as depicted .",
    "that spins are parallel is reflected by the fact that the internal motions of the charges , represented by the oriented circles that surround the corresponding center of mass , have the same orientation .",
    "it must be remarked that the charge motion around its center of mass can be characterised by a phase .",
    "the phases of each particle are chosen opposite to each other .",
    "we also represent the repulsive coulomb force @xmath176 computed in terms of the separation of the charges .",
    "this interacting force @xmath176 has also been attached to the corresponding center of mass , so that the net force acting on point @xmath177 is directed towards point @xmath178 , and conversely .",
    "we thus see there that a repulsive force between the charges represents an atractive force between their center of masses when located at such a short distance .",
    "is computed in terms of the separation distance between the charges . ]    in figure [ fig4 ] we depict the evolution of the charges and masses of this two - electron system for @xmath179 and @xmath180 during a short time interval .",
    "figure [ fig5 ] represents only the motions of the center of masses of both particles for a longer time .",
    "it shows that the center of mass of each particle remains in a bound region .        the evolution of the charges is not shown in this figure because it blurs the picture but it can be inferred from the previous figure .",
    "we have found bound motions at least for the range @xmath181 and velocity @xmath182 .",
    "we can also obtain similar bound motions if the initial velocity @xmath175 has a component along the @xmath183 axis .",
    "the bound motion is also obtained for different initial charge positions as the ones depicted in figure [ fig3 ] .",
    "this range for the relative phase depends on @xmath174 and @xmath175 but in general the bound motion is more likely if the initial phases of the charges are opposite to each other .",
    "we thus see that if the separation between the center of mass and center of charge of a particle ( _ zitterbewegung _ ) is responsible for its spin structure as has been shown in the formalism developped by the author then this atractive effect and also a spin polarised tunneling effect can be easily interpreted @xcite .",
    "a bound motion for classical spinless electrons is not possible .",
    "we can conclude that one of the salient features of this example is the existence from the classical viewpoint of bound states for spinning electron - electron interaction .",
    "it is the spin structure which contributes to the prediction of new physical phenomena .",
    "if two electrons have their center of masses separated by a distance greater than compton s wave length they always repel each other as in the spinless case .",
    "but if two electrons have their center of masses separated by a distance less than compton s wave length they can form from the classical viewpoint bound states provided some initial conditions on their relative initial spin orientation , position of the charges and center of mass velocity are fulfilled .",
    "the example analysed gives just a classical prediction , not a quantum one , associated to a model that satisfies dirac s equation when quantised .",
    "the possible quantum mechanical bound states if they exist , must be obtained from the corresponding analysis of two interacting quantum dirac particles , bearing in mind that the classical bound states are not forbiden from the classical viewpoint . bound states for",
