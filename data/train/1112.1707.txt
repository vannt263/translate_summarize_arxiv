    "the standard model has been very successful in explaining almost all experimental data to date , culminating in the discovery of the top quark @xcite and the tau neutrino @xcite , and finally , a scalar particle that appears to be the long awaited higgs boson has emerged at the large hadron collider  @xcite .",
    "the most important experimental goals of the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) are the investigation of the mechanism for electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb )  the discovery of the higgs bosons or the proof of their non - existence  and the search for new physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "it is important now to check whether the emerging higgs boson fits the sm prescription .    in the standard model",
    "there is just one higgs doublet , which generates masses for vector bosons and fermions , but the differences among yukawa couplings of fermions with the higgs boson are not explained .",
    "in addition , there are no flavor changing neutral currents ( fcnc ) mediated by gauge interactions or by higgs interactions at the tree level . at present",
    ", the top quark is the most massive elementary particle ever discovered .",
    "it might provide clues to study the mechanisms of ewsb and fcnc . at the one loop level , the branching fraction of @xmath11 is @xmath12 for @xmath13 gev  @xcite .",
    "if this decay mode is detected in the near future , it would likely indicate a large effective coupling of tree - level origins , or very large enhancement from beyond sm loop effects .",
    "a general two higgs doublet model usually contains flavor changing neutral higgs ( fcnh ) vertices if there is no discrete symmetry to turn off tree - level fcnc  @xcite . in the context of invoking  @xcite a fritzsch - like quark mixing ansatz  @xcite to evade low energy fcnc constraints induced by fcnh couplings ,",
    "it was pointed out long ago  @xcite that top - charm fcnh coupling could be prominent because of the large top mass . with this in focus , a special two higgs doublet model for the top quark ( t2hdm ) @xcite offers a good explanation of why the top quark is much heavier than other elementary particles . in the t2hdm ,",
    "the top quark is the only elementary fermion acquiring its mass from a special higgs doublet ( @xmath14 ) with a large vacuum expectation value ( vev ) .",
    "since the up and charm quarks couple to another higgs doublet ( @xmath15 ) , there are fcnh interactions among the up - type quarks .    in the near future , for an integrated luminosity of @xmath16 fb@xmath9 at @xmath17 tev , fb@xmath9 data would be collected by both atlas and cms in 2012  @xcite . ]",
    "the lhc will produce approximately @xmath18 top quark pairs ( @xmath19 )  @xcite for @xmath20 gev .",
    "for the same integrated luminosity at @xmath10 tev , the number of ( @xmath19 ) pairs generated would increase to about @xmath21 .",
    "thus , the lhc is becoming a top quark factory , providing great opportunities to study electroweak symmetry breaking as well as other important properties of the top quark .",
    "if the top quark is heavier than a neutral higgs boson that interacts with a top quark and a charm quark , then a promising fcnh signature will appear in pp collisions as @xmath22 or @xmath23 at the lhc  @xcite . with the emerging scalar object at 125 gev ,",
    "the pursuit of this signature has become mandatory .    in this letter",
    ", we study the discovery potential of the lhc in the search for the rare top decay @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is a scalar ( @xmath2 ) or a pseudoscalar ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "the higgs boson then decays into a pair of bottom quarks ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "we have evaluated production rates with full tree - level matrix elements including breit - wigner resonances for both the signal and the physics background .",
    "in addition , we optimize the acceptance cuts to effectively reduce the background with realistic @xmath25-tagging and mistagging efficiencies .",
    "promising results are presented for the lhc with @xmath17 tev as well as @xmath10 tev .",
    "section ii shows the production cross sections for the higgs signal and the dominant background , as well as our strategy to determine the reconstructed masses for the top quark and the higgs boson .",
    "realistic acceptance cuts are discussed in section iii .",
    "section iv presents the discovery potential at the lhc for @xmath17 tev and @xmath10 tev .",
    "our conclusions , which are quite optimistic , are drawn in section v.",
    "we adopt a general two higgs doublet model to study flavor changing neutral higgs interactions with the following effective lagrangian @xmath26 where @xmath2 is a cp - even scalar , @xmath3 is a cp - odd pseudoscalar and @xmath27 246 gev . for @xmath28 , the @xmath0 decay width",

    "we assume that the total decay with of the top quark is @xmath33 then the branching fraction of @xmath0 becomes @xmath34    as a case study , we take the fcnh yukawa couplings to be the geometric mean of the yukawa couplings of the quarks . ]",

    "5 . later ,",
    "in the section on lhc discovery potential , we will consider @xmath42 as a free parameter .",
    "we assume that the width and branching fraction of the higgs scalar decay to @xmath43 are similar to those of the standard higgs boson , while the higgs pseudoscalar decays to the @xmath44 or the @xmath45 pairs are negligible",

    "the signal cross section at the lhc for @xmath51 is evaluated with the parton distribution functions of cteq6l1  @xcite .",
    "in addition , we have checked the signal cross section by narrow width approximation .",

    "the factorization scale and the renormalization scale are chosen to be @xmath54 , the invariant mass of @xmath19 .",
    "this choice of scale leads to a k factor of 2 for top quark pair production  @xcite .    in our analysis",
    ", we consider the fcnh signal from both @xmath55 and @xmath48 , which will be commonly described as @xmath56 or @xmath57 . in every event , we require there should be 3 @xmath25 jets and one light jet ( @xmath58 , or @xmath59 ) .",
    "in addition , there is an isolated lepton ( @xmath49 or @xmath50 ) , and the neutrino will lead to missing transverse energy ( @xmath60 ) . unless explicitly specified , @xmath61 generally denotes a quark ( @xmath61 ) or an anti - quark ( @xmath62 ) and @xmath63 will represent a lepton ( @xmath64 ) or anti - lepton ( @xmath65 ) .",
    "that means our fcnh signal leads to the final state of @xmath66 or @xmath67 .",
    "the dominant physics background to the final state of @xmath68 comes from top quark pair production followed by top and @xmath69 decays : @xmath70 or @xmath71 , where a @xmath72-jet is mis - identified as a @xmath25-jet .",
    "we have also considered backgrounds from @xmath73 , as well as backgrounds from the production of @xmath74 and @xmath75 . according to the atlas and cms technical design reports @xcite ,",
    "the @xmath25 tagging efficiency is @xmath76 , the probability that a @xmath72-jet is mistagged as a @xmath25-jet ( @xmath77 ) is approximately @xmath78 , while the probability that any other jet is mistagged as a @xmath25-jet ( @xmath79 ) is @xmath80 .",
    "if @xmath81 is chosen to be the same as that of a light jet ( @xmath82 ) , the background from @xmath83 will be underestimated by a factor of 10 such as in the analysis in ref .",
    "this point would be elaborated in our study .      in this subsection",

    "the standard higgs boson discovered  @xcite recently at the lhc by the atlas and cms experiments , we look forward to being guided by more new experimental results as we explore interesting physics of ewsb and fcnh . while the properties ( for example , scalar vs pseudoscalar ) of the higgs - like object goes under further scrutiny as data accumulates , perhaps a dedicated fcnh @xmath193 search should be undertaken",
