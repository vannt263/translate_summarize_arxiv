    "understanding the mechanisms that drive the transition to the deconfined regime is one of the great open problems of qcd . in particular with the expected new results from the experiments at the rhic , lhc and gsi facilities",
    "also the theoretical side is challenged to contribute to our understanding of confinement and the transition to the deconfined phase .    since",
    "phase transitions are non - perturbative phenomena , the applied methods must be non - perturbative approaches .",
    "a particularly powerful technique is the lattice formulation of qcd , where numerical simulations have become reliable quantitative tools of analysis .    an interesting idea , which is partly rooted in the lattice formulation , is the svetitsky - jaffe conjecture @xcite which links the deconfinement transition of an su(@xmath0 ) gauge theory in @xmath1 dimensions to the magnetic transition of a @xmath2-dimensional spin system which is invariant under the center group @xmath3 .",
    "the spins of the system are related @xcite to the local polyakov loops , which are static quark sources in the underlying gauge theory .",
    "having identified an effective spin system which describes su(@xmath0 ) gauge theory at the deconfinement transition , it is natural to ask whether one can turn the argument around and identify characteristic features of a spin system directly in the corresponding gauge theory .",
    "furthermore one may analyze whether the gauge - spin relation holds only at the critical temperature @xmath4 or also in a finite range of temperatures around @xmath4 .",
    "a particular property of many discrete spin systems is the percolation of suitably defined clusters of spins at the magnetic transition .",
    "since the spin systems relevant for gauge theories have the discrete @xmath3 invariance , one may expect to find some kind of percolation phenomenon for center degrees of freedom at the deconfinement transition of the gauge theories .",
    "indeed , for the case of su(2 ) lattice gauge theory studies of percolation properties can be found in the literature @xcite , and more recently first results for su(3 ) @xcite as well as full qcd @xcite were presented .",
    "establishing finite clusters below @xmath4 and percolating infinite clusters above @xmath4 gives rise to a tempting interpretation of the deconfinement transition : the size of finite clusters in the confining phase might be related to the maximal distance one can place a quark and an anti - quark source such that they still have a non - vanishing vacuum expectation value . for larger distances the two sources always end up in different clusters and average to zero independently . above @xmath4",
    "there exists an infinite cluster and with a finite probability the two sources are correlated also at arbitrary distances such that they can move freely",
    ".    however , the above sketched picture hinges crucially on the scaling properties of the center clusters  a question that so far has not been addressed in the literature .",
    "a spin system has an intrinsic scale : the lattice constant of the underlying grid . in lattice gauge theory",
    "the situation is different : there one is interested in studying the system for finer and finer lattices in order to learn about the continuum limit . for the percolation picture",
    "this implies that when measured in lattice units , the clusters have to be larger for finer lattices",
    ". only then the size of the cluster in physical units , e.g. , the diameter of the cluster multiplied with the lattice constant in fm can approach a finite value and can be assigned a physical meaning .",
    "if no such scaling behavior can be established the clusters are merely lattice artifacts .    in this article",
    "we compare for su(3 ) and su(2 ) lattice gauge theory the evidence for the existence of center clusters and their percolation at @xmath4 .",
    "particular focus is put on the analysis of the scaling behavior of the clusters .",
    "we study the flow of the cluster parameters as a function of the lattice spacing and demonstrate that a continuum limit for the cluster picture is plausible .",
    "in our analysis we explore pure su(3 ) and su(2 ) lattice gauge theory at temperatures below and above the deconfinement transition .",
    "the basic observable we analyze is the local polyakov loop @xmath5 defined as @xmath6 @xmath5 is the ordered product of the su(3 ) or su(2 ) valued temporal gauge variables @xmath7 at a fixed spatial position @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the number of lattice points in time direction and @xmath10 denotes the trace over color indices .",
    "the loop @xmath5 thus is a gauge transporter that closes around compactified time .",
    "often also the spatially averaged loop @xmath11 is considered , which we define as @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the spatial volume . due to translational invariance @xmath11 and",
    "@xmath5 have the same vacuum expectation value .",
    "the polyakov loop corresponds to a static quark source and its vacuum expectation value is ( after a suitable renormalization ) related to the free energy @xmath14 of a single quark , @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the temperature ( the boltzmann constant is set to 1 in our units ) . below the critical temperature @xmath4 quarks are confined and @xmath14 is infinite , implying @xmath17 . the transition from the confined to the deconfined phase is of first order for the case of su(3 ) , while it is second order for su(2 ) gauge theory .",
    "the deconfinement transition of pure yang - mills theory may also be interpreted as the spontaneous breaking of center symmetry . for su(3 ) the elements @xmath18 of the center group @xmath19 are a set of three phases , @xmath20 , while for su(2 ) we have the center group @xmath21 with @xmath22 . in a center transformation all temporal links in a fixed time slice are multiplied with an element @xmath18 of the center group . while the action and the path integral measure are invariant under a center transformation , the local and averaged polyakov loops transform non - trivially as @xmath23 the non - vanishing expectation value @xmath24 , which we find above @xmath4 , thus signals the spontaneous breaking of the center symmetry .    in our study",
    "we analyze the behavior of the local polyakov loops @xmath5 using quenched su(3 ) and su(2 ) configurations at finite temperature . for both gauge groups we use the lscher - weisz gauge action @xcite on lattices with different sizes ranging from @xmath25 to @xmath26 . for su(3 )",
    "the lattice constant @xmath27 was determined in @xcite using the sommer parameter , while for su(2 ) we express dimensionful quantities using suitable powers of the string tension @xmath28 at zero temperature . for su(3 )",
    "the critical temperature determined in @xcite is used , for su(2 ) it was determined using the polyakov loop susceptibility @xcite .",
    "all errors we show are statistical errors determined with single elimination jackknife .",
    "we begin our analysis with studying the distribution properties of the local polyakov loops @xmath5 defined in ( [ ploopdef ] ) . while @xmath5 is a real number for the gauge group su(2 ) it is complex for su(3 ) . for the latter case",
    "we decompose the local polyakov loops into modulus and phase , @xmath29 in @xcite it was demonstrated that the distribution of the modulus @xmath30 is a rather unspectacular quantity .",
    "it is very well described by the haar measure distribution @xmath31 .",
    "in particular the distribution of the modulus is almost entirely insensitive to temperature , lattice volume and resolution scale @xcite .",
    "thus we conclude that the first order transition of su(3 ) lattice gauge theory into the deconfined phase is not driven by a change in the distribution of the modulus .",

    "one of the motivations of this analysis is to study a possible characterization of the deconfinement transition as a percolation phenomenon .",
    "this is an idea that has been widely explored in the context of spin systems , where for many models the magnetic transition may be characterized by the percolation of suitably defined clusters . for these systems",
    "it is well known that a naive cluster definition , where neighboring sites with equal spin values are assigned to the same cluster , gives rise to clusters that are too dense , such that the percolation- and the magnetic transitions do not coincide .",
    "only if the clusters are `` thinned out '' the two critical temperatures will agree .",
    "in particular one may use the fortuin - kasteleyn cluster construction @xcite , which is now understood to give the correct cluster description of the magnetic transition in potts models @xcite .",
    "the parameter @xmath68 which we introduce in our cluster construction plays exactly the same role as the more educated cluster definitions in spin systems , such as the fortuin - kasteleyn construction . as a matter of fact",
    "the introduction of a free parameter for controlling the cluster density , similar to our prescription , has been discussed in the literature @xcite .",
    "there is , however , an important difference between the analysis of percolation in spin systems and in lattice gauge theory .",

    "this poses the questions how below @xmath4 the physical diameter @xmath102 can remain finite in the limit @xmath103 .",
    "equation ( [ dphys ] ) implies that for the construction of the continuum limit the cluster diameter in lattice units @xmath104 has to diverge , in other words the clusters must become infinite in that limit .",
    "we address this question by comparing clusters of the same physical size on lattices with different resolution @xmath27 .",
    "this comparison is done at the fixed temperature @xmath38 . for each value of @xmath27 we set the cluster parameter @xmath68 such that the physical cluster diameter @xmath94 has the desired size , e.g. , @xmath96 fm . for different values of the lattice spacing @xmath27 different values of @xmath68",

    "( [ sectornumbers ] ) and ( [ sectornumberssu2 ] ) .",
    "we measure the influence of the parameter @xmath68 by defining the following fraction @xmath106 this fraction measures how many sites are available (= the numerator @xmath107 ) , per volume ( factor @xmath108 ) , per center sector ( factor @xmath109 , where @xmath110 is the number of center elements ) . in other words",
    "@xmath111 measures the fraction of sites available for clusters in a given center sector . in fig .",
    "[ fractionavailable ] we show the flow of @xmath111 with @xmath112 .",
    "the continuum limit is reached for @xmath113 .",

    "[ fractionavailable],title=\"fig:\",height=251 ]    it is obvious from the plots that for a given @xmath94 the values for the available fraction @xmath111 at different @xmath112 fall on almost perfect straight lines .",
    "moreover , all the lines extrapolate to roughly the same value in the continuum limit , namely @xmath114 .",
    "we use shaded bands to mark the straight lines and their extrapolation to the continuum limit in order to indicate our estimate in the uncertainty of the analysis .",
    "we stress at this point , that the number @xmath114 has nothing to do with the number of colors in su(3 )  the same value is obtained also for the case of su(2 ) .",
    "let us now try to understand the significance of the value @xmath114 . for site percolation in three dimensions",
    "the critical value for the occupation probability is @xmath115 .",
    "the fraction @xmath111 of points available for clusters in each of the sectors extrapolates in the continuum limit to a value of @xmath114 which is just above the percolation threshold @xmath115 . tries to extrapolate to exactly the percolation threshold 0.316 , which would be an extremely beautiful result .",
    "however , with the resources currently available to us we can not perform a calculation which is accurate enough for a determination of @xmath116 with sufficient precision to test this hypothesis . ]",
    "this suggests that the clusters indeed grow to infinity in lattice units as we approach @xmath73 , and a continuum limit of the center clusters may be possible .",
    "we stress again that our calculation should be viewed only as a first indication that a continuum limit might be possible and certainly needs to be substantiated with a ( unfortunately very expensive ) high precision analysis .",

    "in this paper we analyze distribution properties of the local polyakov loop in su(3 ) and su(2 ) lattice gauge theory at finite temperature . at each spatial lattice site",
    "we identify the nearest center element and study cluster properties of neighboring sites in the same center sector .",
    "while all center sectors are populated equally below @xmath4 , above @xmath4 one of the sectors is selected spontaneously and becomes more populated at the expense of the other , subdominant sectors . after introducing the cluster parameter @xmath68 one can construct suitable clusters which start percolating at the deconfinement transition .",
    "we address the question whether a continuum limit for the clusters is possible by using the cluster diameter in physical units as a physical scale . working on lattices with different lattice constant @xmath27",
    "we adjust the cluster parameter @xmath68 such that the cluster diameter has a fixed value in physical units . when approaching the continuum limit we find that the fraction of sites which are available for clusters extrapolates to a value just above the percolation threshold .",
    "this implies that in lattice units the clusters become infinite in the continuum limit , while in physical units they remain constant ( below @xmath4 ) .",
    "this finding indicates that the cluster picture could indeed have a well defined continuum limit .",
    "when analyzing the cluster diameter in physical units as a function of temperature , we find it is essentially constant below @xmath4 and becomes infinite above .    the center clusters and their percolation at the deconfinement temperature give rise to a simple picture for confinement and the deconfinement transition , which we illustrate in fig .",
    "[ mechanism ] .",
    "below @xmath4 ( lhs .  and center panels in fig .  [ mechanism ] )",
    "the center clusters have a characteristic finite size . if one places two static sources @xmath5 and @xmath117 at a distance @xmath118 which is small enough to fit into one of the clusters ( lhs .",
    "panel ) , the center phase information is the same at both positions @xmath8 and @xmath66 and cancels in the correlator @xmath119 which thus can have a non - vanishing expectation value . if the distance @xmath118 is too large to fit into a single cluster ( center panel ) , then the two sources will always end up in different clusters .",
    "consequently @xmath5 and @xmath117 will be subject to independent fluctuations of the center phase such that @xmath119 averages to zero .",
    "this averaging does not imply that the correlator vanishes abruptly above a fixed value of @xmath118 , because the sizes of the clusters fluctuate giving rise to the well known exponential decay of @xmath119 . above @xmath4 ( rhs.panel in fig .",
    "[ mechanism ] ) , the center clusters percolate and thus provide a coherent center information for arbitrary large distances . as a consequence , above @xmath4",
    "there are non - vanishing contributions to @xmath119 at arbitrary large distances @xmath118 , and the sources are deconfined .    for a further analysis of the center cluster picture",
    "several directions need to be explored .",
    "as already discussed , the numerical evidence presented here can be improved considerably by a large scale precision study of the behavior of the center clusters using ensembles in a wide range of the lattice constant @xmath27 .",
    "in particular the behavior of the fraction @xmath111 of available sites for clusters per center sector should be explored closer to the continuum limit in order to precisely determine the value it extrapolates to .",
    "a second highly important question is how the center clusters change when full qcd with dynamical fermions is considered . in this case",
    "the deconfinement transition turns into a crossover and this different behavior should be reflected in the cluster properties .",
    "preliminary results for that case can be found in @xcite and a more detailed account on the dynamical case is in preparation .",
