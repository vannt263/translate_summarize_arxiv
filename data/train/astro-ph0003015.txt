    "( 1987 ) disputed this interpretation and claimed that the asymmetric line profiles of walker et al .  were caused by rotation , but zhou ( 1995 ) later modeled iras 16293 - 2422 as collapse with rotation .",

    "they detected 12 of these cores in the submillimeter and used maps to study the density profiles of 5 cores .",
    "since these objects lacked iras sources , it is believed that protostars have not yet formed . from statistical arguments about the lifetime of these cores and the fact that the observed density profiles are similar to those predicted by ambipolar diffusion models , ward - thompson et al .  identified these starless cores as in the ambipolar diffusion phase and pre - protostellar .",

    "the frequency of the hco@xmath0 @xmath1 line is known to within an uncertainty of 0.01 mhz , but the uncertainty of the h@xmath2co@xmath0 @xmath1 is potentially large . the standard value in the jpl data base ( pickett et al .",

    "how do the conclusions from  compare to those of lee et al .",
    "( 1999 ) who observed cs and ?",
    "they did not observe b133 or l1689a , but they found l1544 , l1689b and l183 ( their position for l183b is closest to the core we call l183 ) to be infall candidates .",
    "there are slight differences between the cs and  spectra .",
    "l1689b has a blue peak with a red shoulder in  and double - peaked profile with a strong blue peak in cs .",
    "l1544 has a strong blue peak in  but two peaks of equal strength in cs .",
    "l183 has similarly shaped spectra in both lines .",
    "lee et al .",
    "( 1999 ) observed a red peaked profile in l63 , but their position differs substantially from ours .",
    "in general , the different tracers agree reasonably well .",
    "optically thick lines in collapsing sources show a double - peaked line profile with the blue peak stronger than the red peak .",
    "there are two ways of quantifying the asymmetry of the line .",
    "one could use the ratio of the strengths of the two peaks or the asymmetry parameter ( mardones et al .",
    "1997 ) , @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the velocity of the peak of the optically thick line , @xmath22 is that of the optically thin line and @xmath23 is the linewidth of the optically thin line .",
    "we list the results in table 4 .",
    "we do not list the results for all the objects where hco@xmath0 was observed but only those objects for which we were able to establish a rest velocity from h@xmath2co@xmath0 , n@xmath10h@xmath0 or c@xmath4h@xmath10 .",
    "l134a is listed in parentheses because its  spectrum was observed 115  from our  spectrum .",
    "all the other sources for which we used the  line to determine the asymmetry were observed within 40  of our  position . in table 5 , we list the number of blue , symmetric , and red sources as determined by the asymmetry parameter and visual inspection of the line profiles .",
    "following the classification of mardones et al .",
    "sources with asymmetry @xmath24 @xmath25 are blue , while those with asymmetry @xmath26 0.25 are red .",
    "the excess , which characterizes how blue is a sample of objects , is the number of blue sources minus the number of red sources divided by the total number of sources .",
    "the excess as determined from the asymmetry parameter leaving aside l134a is 0.66 , higher than those derived for samples of class 0 and i sources , 0.25 and 0.39 respectively , using the  @xmath1 line ( gregersen et al .",
    "because the number of sources in our sample is small , it is unclear whether the larger excess is significant , but it appears to be at least as large as in the later stages .",
    "lee et al .  found the mean @xmath27 of starless cores to be @xmath280.04 not so different from the mean @xmath27 for class 0 sources , @xmath290.10 ( mardones et al . ) .",
    "for the hco@xmath0 observations of all three categories , the mean @xmath27 using the h@xmath2co@xmath0 @xmath1 line frequency proposed in the previous section are @xmath300.13 , @xmath310.09 and @xmath320.08 for starless cores , class 0 and class i objects , respectively .",
    "so on the basis of line asymmetries , these starless cores can not be distinguished from an older , protostellar population .",
    "zhou ( 1992 ) modeled cs lines in cores that have not yet formed a protostar but are evolving toward the singular isothermal sphere , the starting point of the shu ( 1977 ) collapse model .",
    "he found cs lines with no asymmetry , narrow line widths that increased after collapse began and peak line temperatures that increase until collapse begins .",
    "gregersen et al .",
    "( 1997 ) did evolutionary models of hco@xmath0 @xmath1 in collapsing clouds and found that such line parameters as peak temperature , line width , and blue - red asymmetry increase with time to a maximum value and then decline .",
    "therefore , if we observed sources that were just beginning to collapse , these sources would have hco@xmath0 @xmath1 lines that have slight asymmetry , small peak temperatures and narrow line widths . if we extend these results backward to t = 0 , to the beginning of collapse , we should expect similar line parameters to those of zhou ( 1992 ) . also , since the luminosity of the protostar does not rise immediately , there is some time after collapse begins but before a source would have been detected by iras , so the early stages of the evolutionary models of gregersen et al .",
    "could be applied to  pre - protostellar \" objects . in these models ,",
    "important processes like cloud chemistry and protostellar heating that increase the line width and peak temperatures are glossed over or simplified , so the resulting evolutionary  tracks \" are best seen as rough sketches of line parameter evolution . in figure 3 , we plot peak temperature and linewidth versus the blue - red ratio for the two abundance distributions modeled in gregersen et al . the evolutionary  tracks \" in both plots go roughly from the lower left corner to the upper right .",
    "we see that the starless cores are congregated toward the lower ( i.e.  younger \" ) half of the plot and the class 0 and i sources which have iras sources extend further to the upper ends of the two plots .    however , there are indications that some of these sources have already begun to collapse in a different way than the shu model predicts .",
    "several of the starless cores have blue / red ratios that are too large for early collapse and more like the extreme blue - red ratios seen in more evolved class 0 sources .",
    "in fact , b133 displays the most extreme ratio between the blue and red peak of any source in any class .",
    "the blue - red ratios for this and other sources are too high to arise in a shu model . mardones ( 1998 )",
    "modeled several alternative velocity fields and found that a model in which the entire cloud collapses produces the highest blue - red ratio .",
    "these large blue - red ratios are further discussed in the next section .",
    "we have partially mapped five cores that showed asymmetric line profiles to observe the extent of the asymmetry .",
    "the blue - skewed profiles typically stretch over a large area for such young cores .",
    "for example , in l1689b ( figure 4 ) , the self - absorption or blue - skewed lines stretches over roughly 0.04 by 0.03 parsecs .",
    "there are some red profiles in the southeast area of the map . for l63 ( figure 5 )",
    ", the blue skewness is seen in an area 0.07 by 0.03 parsecs .",
    "we show these two cores because these are the largest maps we have done with good signal - to - noise .",
    "tafalla et al .",
    "( 1998 ) have commented on this large extent of the infall signature in l1544 ( map in figure 6 ) .",
    "they showed that if l1544 was undergoing inside - out collapse , it would have produced a protostar easily visible to iras and that such an early , large - scale infall does not fit with most theories of protostellar collapse .",
    "these observations of extended infall signatures in  combined with the extreme blue - red ratios mentioned in the last section strengthen the case for extended inward motions .",
    "myers and lazarian ( 1998 ) have proposed that turbulent dissipation in a cloud produces an overall implosion starting from the core exterior as an explanation for extended infall signatures .",
    "alternatively , li ( 1999 ) has found evidence for extended inward motions at speeds up to half the sound speed in calculations of core formation in weakly magnetized clouds .",
    "similar speeds also appear in the model of ciolek and basu ( 2000 ) .",
    "the question of whether to call these cores starless or pre - protostellar is a thorny one .",
    "while these cores have no iras sources and so can all be called starless , the term pre - protostellar implies that the future evolution of these objects can be definitely predicted .",
    "however , we can use the submillimeter observations of ward - thompson et al .",
    "( 1994 ) to divide the sample into those cores detected by ward - thompson et al .  at one or more wavelengths and those not detected at all ( table 6 ) .",
    "of the 12 cores in the first group , 6 display blue asymmetry while the other six have no asymmetry .",
    "the six cores that display blue asymmetry are the strongest in the submillimeter continuum . of the 5 cores",
    "ward - thompson et al .  did not detect , 2 have symmetric profiles while we did not detect the other 3 in hco@xmath0 .",
    "the 2 detections of these cores were among the weakest lines observed .",
    "we also include the nh@xmath4 observations of benson and myers ( 1989 ) as a marker of dense core evolution . of the 12 cores with submillimeter emission , all",
    "were observed in nh@xmath4 . of the 5 others ,",
    "only one was observed .",
    "five of the cores in the first group have since been mapped in the submillimeter continuum ( shirley et al .",
    "the four most centrally condensed cores show blue asymmetry .",
    "the least centrally condensed core , l1512 , has no asymmetry in hco@xmath0 .",
    "there is a clear distinction between those cores with submillimeter continuum and those without .",
    "the first group has stronger line emission that often shows what could be the beginning of infall .",
    "the group with relatively strong submillimeter continuum , hco@xmath0 , and nh@xmath4 emission are the likeliest to be pre - protostellar in nature , consistent with the suggestion by ward - thompson et al .",
    "( 1994 ) .",
    "the cores with weak submillimeter continuum could eventually form stars but were undetected simply because of lower column density .",
    "these cores may be in an even earlier evolution stage in which cores are just beginning to form , or these cores may be forming stars of lower mass .",
    "if these cores are weakly centrally concentrated , they would not have a sufficient excitation temperature gradient for infall asymmetry .",
    "further observations would be needed to resolve the nature of these objects .",
    "we have observed 17 starless cores in hco@xmath0 @xmath1 in search of the spectral signature of pre - protostellar collapse .",
    "these objects do seem to be a younger population than the class 0 sources based on their narrow line widths and weak peak temperatures .",
    "we have observed blue asymmetric line profiles in 6 of these cores , and we suggest l1544 , l1689b , b133 and l183 as good protostellar collapse candidates and l1689a and l63 as worthy of further observations in the h@xmath2co@xmath0 @xmath1 line .",
    "the blue excess of this sample is as prominent as in samples of  older \" class 0 and i sources , suggesting that infalling protostars are not exclusively to be found among the class 0 sources .",
    "a population of likely pre - protostellar cores can be distinguished by their strong submillimeter continuum and hco@xmath0 and nh@xmath4 spectral line emission .",
    "however , recently tafalla et al .",
    "( 1998 ) have found that l1544 can not be described as inside - out collapse .",
    "if infall is happening in that core , it can not be explained by any current infall model , suggesting that further study of these cores can tell us about the very beginning of the collapse process .",
    "we would like to thank tommy greathouse , wenbin li , byron mattingly and yancy shirley for their help with observations .",
    "we thank the referee for helpful suggestions , one of which led us to reconsider the rest frequency for the h@xmath2co@xmath33 line .",
