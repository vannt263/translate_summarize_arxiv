    "globular clusters contain @xmath2@xmath3-@xmath4 late type stars in a volume with the half - mass radius of the order of a few parsecs .",
    "they are distributed spherically around our galaxy at characteristic distances of @xmath210 kpc ( e.g. harris  1996 ) .",
    "it is expected that the typical globular cluster can contain up to a hundred of millisecond radio pulsars ( msp ) which appear as a result of spinning up due to the accretion of matter from the low mass companion ( the so called `` recycling '' model , e.g. alpar et al .",
    "in fact , more than 100 radio pulsars with spin periods in the range of a few to a few tens of milliseconds , have been detected in 24 globular clusters .",
    "the largest observed samples are from ter 5 ( 23 msp ) and 47 tuc ( 22 msp ) ( e.g. camilo & rasio  2005 ) .",
    "many of these msps are inside the lmxb systems , but significant part is isolated probably due to the evaporation of the companion star .",
    "it is expected that msps produce relativistic magnetized winds , which in the case of binary pulsars interact with the stellar winds . as a result",
    ", a shock wave is created on which particles can be accelerated to energies large enough for @xmath0-ray production ( e.g. bigniami , maraschi & treves  1977 , kluniak et al .",
    "1988 , phinney et al .",
    "only a part of the pulsar wind is obscured due to the presence of the stellar companion . in most directions",
    "it propagates unconfined and interacts with the globular cluster medium or with other pulsar winds .",
    "note , that in the case of very compact binaries pulsars can be permanently enshrouded by the evaporating material from the companion star ( tavani  1991 ) .",
    "this class of `` hidden '' pulsars is difficult to detect and none of the objects of this type has been uniquely identified up to now .",
    "the @xmath0-ray fluxes expected from specific binaries containing msps ( e.g. psr 1957 + 20 , arons & tavani  1993 ) or from the population of single msps inside the globular clusters ( tavani  1993 ) are about the order of magnitude below the sensitivity of the egret telescope .",
    "larger fluxes are expected from the hidden msps in compact binaries ( tavani 1991 ) .",
    "in fact , only the upper limits on the @xmath0-ray emission from the globular clusters are available , e.g. @xmath5 ph .",
    "@xmath6 s@xmath7 above 100 mev ( michelson et al .  1994 , manandhar et al .",
    "1996 ) and @xmath8 ph . @xmath6 s@xmath7 in energy range @xmath9 mev ( oflaherty et al .",
    "the above mentioned upper limits already allow to put constraints on the number of such sources in globular clusters .",
    "more recently , @xmath0-ray emission from the inner msp magnetospheres has been also estimated for specific gcs by harding et al  ( 2005 ) .",
    "it has been concluded that @xmath0-rays above @xmath10 gev should be observed from some specific individual msps and from some gcs by the magic , hess , and veritas cherenkov telescopes .",
    "the aim of this paper is to calculate the @xmath0-ray emission in the gev - tev energy range expected from the whole population of msp in the globular clusters .",
    "however , in contrast to previous models , we assume that @xmath0-ray emission is produced by leptons which scatter the stellar and microwave background radiation during their diffusion through the medium of the gc .",
    "leptons are accelerated either on the shock waves produced in collisions of the msp winds inside the gc or injected from the inner pulsar magnetopsheres .",
    "we show that leptons can be accelerated to high energies and are confined inside globular cluster for sufficiently long time for efficient up - scattering of the stellar and microwave background radiation to gev - tev energy range .",
    "the available upper limits on the tev @xmath0-ray emission from the globular clusters , e.g. in the case of m 13 ( hall et al .",
    "2003 ) and m 15 ( lebohec et al .",
    "2003 ) , do not constrain strongly the possible production of energetic particles in these type of objects .",
    "however , it is likely that gev - tev @xmath0-rays can be detected from globular clusters by the present and future telescopes .",
    "the number of millisecond pulsars in the central part of typical globular cluster ( gc ) is expected to be of the order of a few tens up to a few hundred ( e.g. tavani 1993 ) .",
    "in fact , 23 pulsars have been observed up to now in ter 5 and 22 pulsars in 47 tuc .",
    "most of these pulsars are localized inside the core of gcs .",
    "they have the average period of the order of a few milliseconds and surface magnetic fields of the order of @xmath2@xmath11 g ( see e.g. camilo & rasio  2005 ) . the characteristic energy loss rate due to the pulsar wind from an isolated pulsar can be estimated by applying the formula for rotating magnetic dipole , @xmath12 where @xmath13 g is the surface magnetic field of the pulsar , and @xmath14 ms is the pulsar period .    for typical radius of the core of gc , @xmath15 pc ,",
    "the characteristic distances between pulsars in gc are @xmath16 .",
    "for example , assuming the presence of @xmath17 pulsars in the cluster core , we obtain @xmath18 cm .",
    "pulsars produce relativistic strongly magnetized winds which , when colliding with other winds , create relativistic shocks .",
    "if the pulsar winds collide between themselves then typical distance from the pulsar to the shock can be estimated to be    @xmath19    we estimate the magnetic field strength at such shocks by simple re - scaling from the pulsar ( assuming @xmath20 dependence in the inner pulsar magnetosphere and @xmath21 dependence in the pulsar wind ) , @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the magnetization parameter of the pulsar wind at the shock region , @xmath24 cm is the neutron star radius , @xmath25 is the light cylinder radius .",
    "we consider the case of leptons injected by the pulsars and additionally accelerated in such relativistic shocks with the power - law spectra .",
    "the value of @xmath23 has been estimated in the case of the wind from the vela type pulsars at @xmath20.1 ( e.g. sefako & de jager  2003 ) and from the crab type pulsars at @xmath20.003 ( kennel & coroniti  1984 ) .",
    "if the wind is terminated closer to the pulsar , then @xmath23 may be of the order of @xmath21 ( contopoulos & kazanas  2002 ) . applying this available range of @xmath23 , we estimated the magnetic field at the pulsar wind shock region in the range @xmath26 g.    the pulsar winds can also interact with the winds of the stars inside the gc",
    ". there are typically @xmath272000 stars in the cores of the gcs within the spherical volume with the radius of @xmath28 pc .",
    "the average distance between these stars is then @xmath29 cm .",
    "let us consider for simplicity solar type stars with typical mass loss rate of the order of @xmath30 m@xmath31 per year and the wind velocity @xmath32 km s@xmath7 .",
    "we determine the parameter @xmath33 , which describes the pressure balance between the pulsar and the stellar winds . for the above values it is equal to @xmath34 .",
    "then , based on the simplified model for the structure of the colliding winds ( girard & wilson  1987 ) , we estimate the radius of the volume dominated by the stellar wind on @xmath35 , i.e. equal to @xmath36 cm for a solar type star .",
    "therefore , we conclude that stellar winds are confined in a small region around the stars and the pulsar winds collide mainly between themselves .",
    "globular clusters can contain typically a few hundred thousand stars with characteristic masses of the order of @xmath37 m@xmath31 in the volume of a few parsecs .",
    "since their mass to luminosity ratio is close to @xmath38 ( see e.g. recent analysis for m15 by van den bosch et al . 2006 ) , these stars create very strong background radiation field which can act as a target for relativistic leptons injected by the millisecond pulsars .",
    "based on the observed luminosity of specific globular cluster , @xmath39 , and on the density profile for the distribution of the stars inside the cluster ( based on the michie - king model ( michie 1963 ) , see also kuranov & postnov 2006 ) ,    @xmath40    we calculate the energy density of stellar photons inside the cluster core from the formula , @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the gc core radius ; @xmath43 is its tidal radius , and the half mass radius , @xmath44 , is related to those both by @xmath45 . for typical parameters , @xmath46 pc , @xmath47 pc , and @xmath48 l@xmath49 erg s@xmath7",
    ", we obtain @xmath50 ev @xmath51 .",
    "the energy density of this stellar radiation field clearly dominates over the energy density of the microwave background radiation ( mbr ) , @xmath52 ev @xmath51 .",
    "it can also dominate over the energy density of the magnetic field inside the gc provided that the magnetic field is not stronger than @xmath53 g. this limit has been obtained assuming the equipartition between the energy density of stellar photons and the energy density of the magnetic field . since such strong magnetic field inside the gcs seems unlikely ( see estimate given by eq .  [ eq2 ] for the region of the pulsar wind shock ) , we conclude that leptons injected by the pulsars in the gc cores lose energy mainly on ic scattering of the stellar and microwave radiation .",
    "let us estimate the maximum energies which leptons ( @xmath54 ) can reach in such pulsar wind shocks .",
    "the obvious limit is introduced by the condition that the larmor radius of accelerated particles can not be greater than the dimension of the shocks , i.e. @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the velocity of light , @xmath57 is the charge of an electron , @xmath58 is the momentum of the particle , and @xmath59 is the magnetic field strength at the shock . for the above estimated magnetic field at the shock ,",
    "we get @xmath60 additional limits can be constrained by the energy losses of leptons on the synchrotron and inverse compton ( ic ) processes during their acceleration . in order to estimate these limits we compare the acceleration rates of leptons with their energy loss rates on the mentioned processes .",
    "the acceleration rate is independent on the energy of lepton @xmath61 provided that so called acceleration coefficient @xmath62 is constant .",
    "it can be written as , @xmath63 and the corresponding acceleration time scale , @xmath64 where @xmath65 tev is the energy of leptons , @xmath66 g is the magnetic field strength at the shock , and @xmath56 is the velocity of light .    on the other hand , the synchrotron energy loss rate is , @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the energy density of magnetic field , @xmath69 is the thomson cross section , and @xmath70 is the lorentz factor of leptons . by comparing eqs .",
    "[ eq4 ] with  [ eq5 ] and applying eq .",
    "[ eq2 ] we get the limit on the maximum energy of accelerated leptons due to the synchrotron losses , @xmath71 where @xmath72 .",
    "this limit is more restrictive than the limit due to the dimension of the shock ( @xmath73 ) provided that the following condition is fulfilled , @xmath74 leptons accelerated at the shock are also immersed in the strong radiation field coming from the stellar population within the gc . above",
    "we estimated the average density of stellar photons in the core of gc on @xmath50 ev @xmath51 .",
    "this allows us to estimate the energy loss rate on ics in the thomson ( t ) regime , @xmath75 the thomson regime is valid only for leptons with energies below @xmath76 gev . by comparing eqs .",
    "[ eq4 ] with  [ eq8 ] and applying the limit @xmath77 , we obtain that the saturation of acceleration of leptons can occur due to ic losses in the thomson regime provided that @xmath78 . however , this case is not specially interesting from the point of view of tev @xmath0-ray production .",
    "note that the acceleration of particles at relativistic shocks ( defined by @xmath62 ) is usually considered as much more efficient .",
    "for example , observations of the tev @xmath0-ray emission from the crab nebula show that the acceleration of particles occurs during a few larmor cycles .",
    "thus , @xmath62 has to be of the order of @xmath79 .",
    "therefore , here we consider the case of saturation of lepton acceleration in the klein - nishina ( kn ) regime .",
    "the energy loss rate in the kn regime depends only logarithmically on energy of leptons , i.e. depends very weakly on energy of leptons .",
    "so then , if the acceleration coefficient is significantly larger than @xmath80 ( as considered in this paper for the pulsar wind relativistic shocks ) the saturation of acceleration of leptons might be caused either by synchrotron energy losses or dimension of the shock ( depending on the parameters of the specific pulsar , see eq .",
    "[ eq7 ] ) .",
    "however , the limit on the maximum energies of accelerated leptons can be also given by the advection time scale of leptons along the surface of the shock .",
    "the velocity of the plasma flow downstream of the relativistic shock can be estimated at @xmath81 .",
    "then , the advection time scale is , @xmath82 where @xmath83 is defined by eq .",
    "[ eq1b ] . by comparing the acceleration time scale of leptons ( eq .  [ eq4a ] ) with their advection time scale along the shock ( eq .  [ eq8a ] )",
    ", we obtain another limit on the maximum energies of leptons , @xmath84 where @xmath85 pc , @xmath86 , and @xmath87 . for likely parameters of the considered scenario , @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 , and @xmath91",
    ", we estimate the maximum energies of accelerated leptons due to their advection along the shock at @xmath92 tev . for reasonable acceleration efficiency at relativistic shock of the order of @xmath93 , this maximum energies of leptons",
    "are limited to the range @xmath94 tev .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the acceleration process of leptons is limited by their advection process along the surface of the shock .    based on the above general considerations ,",
    "we conclude that the maximum energies of leptons accelerated at the shocks are likely to be limited by advection process of leptons along the shock and not by the dimension of the shock in the pulsar wind @xmath95 or the energy losses on the synchrotron or ic scattering processes .",
    "leptons can be accelerated inside gc to energies which allow them to comptonize the stellar and mbr photons to the tev @xmath0-ray energy range .",
    "leptons injected with different energies in the central core of the globular cluster diffuse gradually in the outward direction .",
    "we consider the central region with the radius @xmath44 in which half of the mass of the gc is contained .",
    "assuming the bohm diffusion , the average time spend by leptons with energy e inside this region is , @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the diffusion coefficient , @xmath98 cm is the larmor radius of leptons in the magnetic field of the gc , and @xmath99 g is the average magnetic field in the gc .    in order to answer the question whether leptons can lose significant part of their energy during the diffusion through the thermal radiation field inside the gc we estimate the collision rate on ic process in the thomson regime for supposed parameters inside the gc .",
    "let us use the following parameters , @xmath100 , @xmath101 g , @xmath102 pc , and the average density of thermal photons inside the gc , @xmath103 @xmath51 .",
    "then , @xmath104 cm , @xmath105 @xmath106",
    "s@xmath7 , and @xmath107 s. for this diffusion time scale , the collision rate of leptons is of the order of @xmath108 , i.e. leptons might interact up to a hundred times before leaving the globular cluster . note that the diffusion time and the ics cross section in the kn regime are inversely proportional to energy of leptons .",
    "therefore , leptons with energies up to @xmath37 tev should interact frequently with stellar photons producing @xmath0-rays with comparable energies .",
    "however , leptons with energies above @xmath37 tev have chance to escape from the radiation field of the gc without interaction with stellar photons .",
    "on the other hand , these high energy leptons interact frequently with the mbr producing @xmath0-rays in the energy range from tens mev up to hundreds gev . in the next section ,",
    "we perform more detailed calculations of the @xmath0-ray spectra produced in the process considered above by assuming injection of leptons with the mono - energetic and the power - law spectra with different spectral indexes , injection efficiencies , and high energy cut - offs .",
    "5.2truecm    let us assume that the part , @xmath109 , of the wind energy of pulsars inside the gc is converted into relativistic leptons ( so called energy conversion efficiency ) . then using eq .",

    "these leptons produce @xmath0-rays as a result of ics of thermal and mb photons . in order to perform numerical calculations of the @xmath0-ray spectra",

    "[ eq2a ] . as a first approximation",
    ", it is assumed that the average star inside gc has the basic parameters close to that of our sun , i.e. the surface temperature @xmath119 k and the radius @xmath120 cm ( note that the mass to light ratio for typical gc is close to @xmath22 ) .",
    "the density of stellar photons at a specific distance from the center of gc is calculated by integration over the whole distribution of stars inside the gc .",
    "the examples of the density profiles for distribution of stars and the density and energy density of stellar photons inside the gc with the luminosity @xmath121 m@xmath115 are shown in fig .",

    "the density of photons drops slowly with the distance from the core reaching the value of approximately a factor of two lower at @xmath42 than at the center of the core .",
    "outside the half mass radius , defined by @xmath123 pc , density of photons drops almost proportionally to @xmath124 . for comparison",
    "we also show the photon and photon energy densities of mbr .",
    "note , that in the case of considered gc , the photon density of the mbr dominates over density of stellar photons .",
    "in contrast , the photon energy density of mbr is much lower than the stellar photon energy density in the whole volume of the gc .",
    "therefore low energy leptons lose mainly energy on scattering stellar radiation in the thomson regime",
    ". however leptons with large energies lose energy mainly by scattering the mbr in the thomson regime since their scattering of stellar radiation is strongly suppressed due to the kn effect .",
    "we calculate the @xmath0-ray spectra produced by leptons which ic up - scatter the stellar photons and the mbr . for considered energies of leptons the scattering process of stellar radiation can occur in the t or the kn regimes .",
    "we neglect the synchrotron energy losses of leptons for the considered range of their energies and values of the magnetic field inside the gcs .",
    "it is assumed that leptons are injected homogeneously inside the core of gc .",
    "since diffusion of leptons from the core occurs in the variable thermal radiation field , the importance of the scattering process in both considered radiation fields ( thermal photons and mbr ) can differ significantly . in order to calculate the @xmath0-ray spectra produced by leptons diffusing outward the center of gc we apply the monte carlo method .",
    "the optical depth for leptons on the ics is determined during their gradual diffusion in variable radiation field .",

    "the broad band @xmath0-ray observations , through gev - tev energy range , with the glast and cherenkov telescopes ( magic , hess , veritas ) should confirm ( or disprove ) models considered here for different spectra of injected leptons .",
    "the detection ( or non - detection ) of @xmath0-ray emission from gcs should put a limit on the parameters of the acceleration models of leptons in inner magnetopsheres of millisecond pulsars and/or at the pulsar wind relativistic shocks .",
    "9.5truecm    although globular clusters",
    "are typically at large distances , the regions on the sky from which @xmath0-rays can arrive to the observer at the earth can be quite large , e.g. at the typical distance of 5 kpc and the half mass radius 5 pc the gc has angular dimension of @xmath145 .",
    "therefore , it is important to find out whether the @xmath0-rays produced by leptons diffusing outside the central region of gc can create a point like or an extended source for the cherenkov telescopes . in order to check this ,",
    "we perform calculations of the @xmath0-ray spectra as a function of distance from the center of the gc in case of their production by leptons with specific injection spectrum .",
    "the @xmath0-ray spectra produced within the central volume with the radius 1 pc , 3.3 pc , 10 pc , 33 pc , and 100 pc are shown in fig .",
    "they were calculated for two different values of the magnetic field inside the gc , @xmath146 g ( a ) and @xmath147 g ( b ) .",
    "it is clear that in the case of the magnetic field equal to @xmath148 g , most of the @xmath0-rays are already produced within @xmath149 pc from the center of the gc .",
    "the spectrum produced within @xmath21 pc is only a factor of 2 lower than within @xmath23 pc at energies above a few hundred gev . in the case of the gc with the magnetic field equal to @xmath147 g",
    ", the @xmath0-ray emission is more spreaded - out .",
    "however , still most of the emission ( @xmath250@xmath150 ) comes from the central region with the radius of @xmath149 pc .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the extent of the @xmath0-ray source , produced by leptons injected within the gcs , is relatively small provided that the magnetic fields inside the gc cores are of the order of @xmath151 g. for typical distance to the gc ( of the order of 5 kpc ) , the @xmath0-ray source with dimension of 3 - 5 pc should have an angular size of @xmath22-3 , i.e. it should be a point - like source for the present cherenkov telescopes that have the typical angular resolution of this order . since the extent of the @xmath0-ray source is not very sensitive to the considered value of the magnetic field strength inside the gc , the more complicated model for the magnetic field structure inside the gc ( e.g. dependence of the magnetic field on the distance from the center of gc ) should not give very different results .",
    "as an example , we perform calculations of the @xmath0-ray fluxes expected on the earth from 4 globular clusters ( selected from the catalog of globular clusters , harris  1996 ) . inside these clusters many millisecond pulsars have been already detected and a large number of millisecond pulsars is expected ( see camilo & rasio 2005 ; tavani  1993 ) : 47 tuc ( 22 msp detected and @xmath152 msp expected ) , ter 5 ( 23 , and @xmath153 msp ) , m15 ( 8 and @xmath154 msp ) , and m13 ( 5 and @xmath155 msp ) .",

    "m15 and m13 can be observed at small zenith angles by the northern sky telescopes ( magic , and veritas ) , and ter 5 and 47 tuc can be observed by the southern telescopes ( hess and cangaroo ) .",
    "m15 and ter 5 can be observed simultaneously by the northern and southern sky telescopes at small or large zenith angles what allows to cover the @xmath0-ray energy range between @xmath2100 gev and a few tens tev .",
    "this is important if one wants to extract possible variable contribution to the @xmath0-ray flux from e.g. , x - ray binaries or intermediate mass black holes also expected inside the gcs .    for every considered here cluster ,",
    "we calculate the stellar radiation field as a function of distance applying their known parameters , i.e. , dimension and total luminosity . in all simulations we consider the propagation of leptons inside the inner region around the center of gc with the radius @xmath156 pc .",
    "as we have shown above , most of the @xmath0-rays are produced in a relatively small region , provided that the magnetic field strength inside the cluster is larger than @xmath157 g. the @xmath0-ray spectra are calculated for all these 4 clusters by assuming that the power injected in relativistic leptons is equal to @xmath158 erg s@xmath7 .",
