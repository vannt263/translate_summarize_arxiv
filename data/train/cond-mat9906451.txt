    "when a gas or vapour is brought into contact with a clean solid surface , parts of its molecules will become reversibly attached to the surface in the form of an adsorbed layer .",
    "knowledge of equilibrium and dynamical properties of such adsorbed layers is essential for many practical applications , including coating , gluing and lubrication .    following the seminal work of langmuir ( see , e.g. ref.@xcite ) ,",
    "the equilibrium properties of adsorbed layers have been extensively studied and a great number of important developments have been made .",
    "in particular , further analysis included more realistic forms of intermolecular interactions or allowed for the possibility of multilayer formation .",
    "as a result , different possible phase transformations have been predicted and different forms of adsorption isotherms have been found , which well explain available experimental data ( see , e.g. refs.@xcite ) .    some effort has been also invested to the understanding of molecular diffusion in adsorbed layers , which has a strong impact on their global dynamical behavior .",
    "for instance , diffusional processes control the rates of spreading of molecular films on solid surfaces @xcite , spontaneous or forced dewetting of monolayers @xcite or island formation @xcite . here , some approximate analytical results have been obtained for both dynamics of an isolated adatom on a corrugated surface and collective diffusion , describing spreading of the macroscopic density fluctuations in interacting adsorbates being in contact with the vapour phase @xcite . on the other hand , most of available studies of the tracer diffusion in adsorbed layers , which provides a useful information about their intrinsic viscosity , pertain to strictly two - dimensional models excluding the possibility of particles adsorption and desorption ( see , e.g. refs.@xcite and references therein ) . except for ref.@xcite , which studied driven tracer dynamics in a somewhat artificial one - dimensional model , analysis of the tracer diffusion in adsorbed monolayers undergoing exchanges with the vapour phase seems to be lacking at present .    in this paper",
    "we study the diffusion properties of a driven tracer in a two - dimensional adsorbed monolayer undergoing continuous exchanges with the vapour .",
    "the system we consider consists of ( i ) a solid substrate , which is modeled in a usual fashion as a regular square lattice of adsorption sites supporting at most a single occupancy , ( ii ) a monolayer of adsorbed , mobile hard - core particles in contact with a vapour and ( iii ) a single , hard - core tracer particle .",
    "each monolayer particle moves randomly along the lattice by performing hopping motion on the vacant neighboring lattice sites .",
    "the monolayer particles undergo continuous exchanges with a vapour phase , i.e. may desorb from and adsorb onto the lattice with some prescribed rates dependent on the vapour pressure , temperature and the interactions with the solid substrate . on the contrary ,",
    "the tracer particle is constrained to move on the two - dimensional lattice only , i.e. it can not desorb to the vapour , and it is subject to a constant external force @xmath4 .",
    "hence , the tracer performs a biased random walk , which is constrained by the hard - core interactions with the monolayer particles , and always remains within the monolayer , probing its response on the internal perturbancy or , in other words , its frictional properties .",
    "here we focus on the limit of sufficiently large external force , such that the tracer may move only in one direction , but not large enough to make it slide regardless of the surface corrugation .",
    "the results for the general case of arbitrary @xmath4 , which allow us to deduce the analog of the stokes formula for 2d adsorbed monolayers and to define the corresponding friction coefficient , will be presented elsewhere @xcite .    in terms of a mean - field - type approximation of ref.@xcite , which is based on the decoupling of the tracer - particle - particle correlation functions into the product of pair - wise correlations",
    ", we define the stationary density profiles of the monolayer particles , as seen from the moving tracer , and we determine analytically the terminal velocity @xmath0 of the tracer . we show that the adsorbed monolayer particles tend to accumulate in front of the driven tracer , creating a sort of a `` traffic jam '' , which impedes its motion .",
    "thus the density profile around the tracer is highly inhomogeneous : the local density of the monolayer particles in front of the tracer is higher than the average and approaches the average value as an exponential function of the distance from the tracer . the characteristic length and the amplitude of the density relaxation function are calculated explicitly . on the other hand , past the tracer",
    "the local density is lower than the average ; we show that depending on the condition whether the number of particles in the monolayer is explicitly conserved or not , the local density past the tracer may tend to the average value either as an exponential or as an @xmath5 function of the distance , revealing in the latter case especially strong memory effects and strong correlations between the particle distribution in the monolayer and the tracer position .    further on , we find that the terminal velocity of the tracer particle depends explicitly on the excess density in the `` jammed '' region in front of the tracer .",
    "this excess density , in turn , depends on the magnitude of the velocity , as well as on the rate of the adsorption / desorption processes and on the rate at which the particles can diffuse away of the tracer .",
    "the interplay between the jamming of the monolayer , produced by the tracer particle , and the rate of its homogenization due to diffusion and adsorption / desorption processes , manifests itself as a medium - induced frictional force exerted on the tracer , whose magnitude depends on the tracer velocity . as a consequence of such a non - linear coupling , in the general case , ( i.e. for arbitrary adsorption / desorption rates and particles diffusion coefficient ) , @xmath0 can be found only implicitly , as the solution of a certain non - linear equation relating @xmath0 to the system parameters .",
    "this equation simplifies considerably in the limit of small or large particles diffusivity , in which two cases exlicit asymptotic expressions for the tracer velocity are obtained .",
    "we finally remark , that a qualitatively similar physical effect was predicted recently for a different model system involving a charged particle moving at a constant speed at a small distance above the surface of an incompressible , infinitely deep liquid .",
    "it has been shown in refs.@xcite , that the interactions between the moving particle and the fluid molecules induce an effective frictional force exerted on the particle , producing a local distortion of the liquid interface , - a bump , which travels together with the particle and increases effectively its mass . the mass of the bump , which is analogous to the jammed region appearing in our model , depends itself on the particle s velocity resulting in a non - linear coupling between the medium - induced frictional force exerted on the particle and its velocity @xcite .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : in section 2 , we formulate the model and introduce basic notations . in section 3",
    ", we write down the dynamical equations which govern the time evolution of the monolayer particles and of the tracer .",
    "section 4 is devoted to the analytical solution of these evolution equations in the limit @xmath6 ; here we also present some general results on the form of the density profiles around stationary moving tracer and on the tracer terminal velocity , which is given implicitly , as the solution of a transcendental equation . in section 5 , we derive explicit asymptotic results for the tracer terminal velocity in the limits of small and large particles diffusivities . as well , here we discuss the forms of the density profiles at intermediate scales . corresponding asymptotical behavior of the density profiles at large distances from the tracer is discussed in section 6 .",
    "finally , we conclude in section 7 with a brief summary and discussion of our results .",
    "consider a two - dimensional square lattice of adsorption sites @xmath7 , which is brought in contact with a reservoir of identic , electrically neutral particles ( vapour phase ) ( fig.1 ) , maintained at a constant pressure .",
    "we suppose that the particles may leave the reservoir and adsorb onto any vacant lattice site at a fixed rate @xmath8 .",
    "then , the adsorbed particles may move randomly on the lattice by hopping with a rate @xmath9 to any of four neighboring lattice sites , which process is constrained by hard - core exclusion preventing multiple occupancy of any site .",
    "they can also desorb from the lattice back to the reservoir at a site- and environment - independent rate @xmath10 .",
    "we assume , for simplicity of exposition , that typical adsorption , desorption and jump times are equal to each other , @xmath11 and @xmath12 , respectively , can be readily made different and restored in our final results by the mere replacement @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 . ] and are denoted by @xmath16 .",
    "consequently , at any time instant the variable @xmath17 , characterizing the occupation of the site @xmath7 such that    @xmath18    can change its value due to adsorption , desorption and constrained random hopping events .",
    "note that the total number of particles in the adsorbed monolayer is not conserved in this dynamical process .",
    "however , the mean density @xmath1 of the adsorbate , @xmath19 , approaches as @xmath20 a constant value    @xmath21    which equation is usually referred to as the langmuir adsorption isotherm @xcite .",
    "further on , at @xmath22 we introduce at the lattice origin an extra hard - core particle , whose motion we would like to follow and which will be called in the remainder as the tracer .",
    "we stipulate that the tracer is different from the adsorbed particles in that it can not desorb from the lattice and in that it is subject to some external driving force , which favors its jumps to a preferential direction .",
    "such a situation may be realized , for instance , if this only particle is charged and the system is subject to a uniform electric field . here",
    "we will focus on the particular case when the external field , oriented in the positive @xmath23-direction , is sufficiently strong , such that the tracer performs totally directed random walk ( poisson process ) along the @xmath23-axis in the two - dimensional monolayer of adsorbed mobile , hard - core particles .",
    "the tracer can be thought off as a certain external probe , which is designed to measure the resistance offered by the monolayer particles to the external perturbance .",
    "more precisely , we define the tracer dynamics as follows : we suppose that the tracer , which is at the site @xmath24 at time @xmath25 , waits an exponentially distributed time with mean is different from the corresponding time @xmath26 associated with the monolayer particles dynamics . as a matter of fact , this should be the case merely because the tracer - substrate interactions may be different from the particle - substrate ones .",
    "varying @xmath27 we can mimic different possible situations ; in particular , @xmath28 corresponds to the case when the tracer simply slides along the substrate regardless of the surface corrugation . ]",
    "@xmath27 , and then attempts to hop onto the neighboring site @xmath29 , @xmath30 being the lattice spacing . the jump is actually fulfilled only if the target site is vacant at this moment of time ; otherwise , i.e. , if the target site is occupied by any adsorbed particle , the jump is rejected and the tracer remains at its position .",
    "let @xmath31 denote the probability of finding at time @xmath25 the tracer at the site @xmath32 and all adsorbed particles in the configuration @xmath33 .",
    "further more , let @xmath34 denote the configuration obtained from @xmath35 by exchanging the occupation variables of the two neighboring sites @xmath7 and @xmath36 , which describes the kawasaki - type particle - vacancy exchange between the sites @xmath7 and @xmath36 .",
    "next , we denote as @xmath37 the configuration obtained from the original configuration @xmath35 by the replacement @xmath38 , which corresponds to the glauber - type flip of the occupation variable due to the adsorption / desorption events .",
    "then , counting up all events which can result in the configuration @xmath39 at time @xmath25 or modify it , we write down the following master equation , which governs the time evolution of the configuration probability @xmath31 :    @xmath40    where the dot denotes the time derivative , double prime indicates that the summation extends over all lattice sites @xmath7 , excluding the special sites @xmath41 and @xmath32 ; a single prime after the summation sign means that the sums runs over all lattice sites excluding the site @xmath32 only .",
    "now , we can obtain the instantaneous velocity @xmath42 of the tracer particle directly from eq.([eq maitresse ] ) . to do this",
    ", we multiply both sides of eq.([eq maitresse ] ) by @xmath43 and sum over all possible configurations @xmath39 , which yields the following equation for the instantaneous tracer velocity @xmath44 where the bar denotes the configurational average and @xmath45 is the probability of having at time t an adsorbed particle at position @xmath46 , defined in the frame of reference moving with the tracer particle . in other words ,",
    "@xmath47 can be interpreted as the density profile as seen from the moving tracer .",
    "consequently , eq.([vitesse ] ) relates the instantaneous velocity of the tracer particle to the particle density in the immediate vicinity of the tracer .",
    "note , that if the monolayer was perfectly stirred , i.e. @xmath48 everywhere , ( which implies decoupling of @xmath43 and @xmath35 ) , we should obtain from eq.([vitesse ] ) a trivial mean - field result    @xmath49    which states that the tracer jump time @xmath27 is merely renormalized by a factor @xmath50 , which is the inverse concentration of voids in the monolayer : @xmath51 defines simply the frequency of successful jump events . however , this turns out not to be the case and @xmath47 appears to be different of the equilibrium value @xmath1 everywhere , except for infinitely separated sites , @xmath52 .",
    "moreover , as we proceed to show , @xmath47 is itself dependent on the tracer velocity which yields ultimately a strongly non - linear equation determining @xmath0 .",
    "hence , in order to calculate the mean velocity of the tracer we have to determine the form of the density profile @xmath47 , or more precisely , the value of the mean density at the neighboring to the tracer site @xmath53 .",
    "the latter can be found from the master equation ( [ eq maitresse ] ) by multiplying both sides of eq.([eq maitresse ] ) by @xmath54 and performing the summation over all configurations .    in doing so",
    ", we find the following set of equations , which hold for the sites separated from the tracer by the distance exceeding the lattice spacing @xmath30 , i.e. such that @xmath55 ,    @xmath56    where the symbols @xmath57 denote the central second - order finite difference operators of step @xmath30 ,    @xmath58    on the other hand , for the sites adjacent to the tracer position , i.e. @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 , respectively , we get    @xmath62    @xmath63    and    @xmath64    where @xmath65 stand for the forward difference operators , of the form    @xmath66    and @xmath67 note , that eqs.([(sigma,0 ) ] ) to ( [ ( 0,+-sigma ) ] ) are different from eq.([lambda > sigma ] ) , since the density profile at the neighboring to the tracer sites is strongly perturbed by its asymmetric hopping rules . as a matter of fact , eqs.([(sigma,0 ) ] ) to ( [ ( 0,+-sigma ) ] ) can be thought off as the boundary conditions for eq.([lambda > sigma ] ) .",
    "now , several remarks on eqs.([lambda > sigma ] ) to ( [ ( 0,+-sigma ) ] ) are in order . first of all , one notices that these equations are not closed with respect to @xmath47 but rather coupled to the third - order , tracer - particle - particle correlation functions . in turn , if we attempt to derive the evolution equations for the third - order correlation functions , we find that the latter appear to be coupled to the fourth - order correlations . consequently , in order to determine the tracer velocity , one faces the problem of solving an infinite hierarchy of coupled equations for the correlation functions . here",
    "we resort to the simplest non - trivial closure of eqs.([lambda > sigma ] ) to ( [ ( 0,+-sigma ) ] ) in terms of the pairwise correlation function @xmath47 , which is based on the following decoupling approximation of the third - order correlation functions ,    @xmath68    i.e. the average with the weight @xmath31 of the product of several occupation numbers of different sites is set equal to the product of their average values with the weight @xmath31 .",
    "we hasten to remark that the approximate closure of the evolution equations in eq.([decouplage ] ) , as well as some similar but not obviously equivalent approximations @xcite , have been already employed for studying related models of tracer diffusion in hard - core lattices gases and shown to provide quite accurate description of the dynamical and stationary behavior .",
    "the decoupling in eq.([decouplage ] ) has been first introduced in ref.@xcite to determine the properties of the driven tracer diffusion in a one - dimensional hard - core lattice gas with the conserved number of particles , i.e. without exchanges of particles with the reservoir .",
    "extensive numerical simulations performed in ref.@xcite have demonstrated that such a decoupling is quite a plausible approximation for the model under study .",
    "moreover , rigorous probabilistic analysis of ref.@xcite has shown that for this model the results based on the decoupling scheme in eq.([decouplage ] ) are essentially exact .",
    "furthermore , the same closure procedure has been applied recently to study spreading of a hard - core lattice gas from a reservoir attached to one of the lattice sites @xcite , and to treat the biased tracer dynamics in a one - dimensional model of adsorbed monolayer in contact with a vapour phase , i.e. a one - dimensional version of the model to be studied here . also in these cases an excellent agreement has been observed between the analytical predictions and monte carlo simulations data .",
    "last but not least , as we set out to show elsewhere @xcite , in case of arbitrary force exerted on the tracer the decoupling in eq.([decouplage ] ) reproduces the results of refs.@xcite and @xcite for the tracer diffusion coefficient in two - dimensional hard - core lattice gases with a conserved particles number ( the limit @xmath69 , @xmath70 in our case ) ; these results are known to be exact in the limits of small and large particle densities and provide a very accurate approximation for the tracer diffusion coefficient in two - dimensional hard - core lattice gases with arbitrary particle density @xcite .",
    "we thus expect that it will render a plausible description of the tracer dynamics in the two - dimensional model under study and base our further analysis on this mean - field - type approximation .    using the approximation in eq.([decouplage ] )",
    ", we can rewrite eq.([lambda > sigma ] ) in the following closed form    @xmath71    where the operator @xmath72 is given by    @xmath73    further more , we find    @xmath74    @xmath75    and    @xmath76    equations ( [ eq approx ] ) to ( [ limite3 ] ) constitute a closed system of equations , which suffice the computation of the density profiles and tracer velocity .",
    "note , however , that these equation are non - linear , since @xmath77 enters the prefactor before the gradient term , which makes such a computation to be quite a non - trivial problem .",
    "below we consider the solution of this system of equations in the limit @xmath20 .",
    "we turn now to the limit @xmath6 and suppose that both the tracer velocity @xmath42 and the density profile around the tracer attain stationary non - zero values @xmath0 and @xmath47 , i.e. @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "next , it is expedient to rewrite eqs([eq approx ] ) to ( [ limite3 ] ) in terms of an auxiliary function @xmath80 :    @xmath81    which determines the local deviation of the density from the average value @xmath1 . in terms of this auxiliary function eqs([eq approx ] ) to ( [ limite3 ] ) become for @xmath82    @xmath83    while @xmath80 in the immediate vicinity of the tracer obey    @xmath84    @xmath85    @xmath86    @xmath87    where @xmath88 denotes the diffusion coefficient of an isolated adsorbed particle : @xmath89 , the characteristic parameter @xmath90 is akin to the so - called `` peclet '' number in the hydrodynamics , and we have the parameter @xmath91 .",
    "the parameter @xmath92 can be also written as @xmath93 , where the factor @xmath94 is an exponential of the difference of the energy barriers against lateral diffusion and desorption .",
    "hence , @xmath92 compares the relative weights of the adsorption / desorption and the diffusion events .",
    "note , that the factor @xmath94 is usually small for most of realistic experimental situations , such that @xmath92 is small provided that @xmath95 . on the other hand , at high adsorbate densities",
    ", @xmath92 can attain relatively large values .",
    "as well , the peclet - type number @xmath96 can also be small or large , depending on the physical situation .",
    "below we will consider different possible limits for @xmath96 and @xmath92 in order to elucidate the asymptotic behavior of the tracer velocity .    in a standard approach , eqs.([eq peclet ] ) to ( [ limite4 peclet ] ) can be solved by introducing the generating function of the local deviation @xmath80 , i.e.    @xmath97    multiplying eqs.([eq peclet ] ) to ( [ limite4 peclet ] ) by @xmath98 and @xmath99 and summing over all @xmath100 and @xmath101 , we find then that the generating function @xmath102 is given explicitly by    @xmath103    where @xmath104 , and    @xmath105    note , that @xmath102 depends on @xmath106 only in the combination @xmath107 , which signifies that @xmath80 is , as it could be expected , an even function of @xmath101 .",
    "now , @xmath80 can be found directly from eqs.([expression fonction generatrice ] ) and ( [ ka ] ) through the standard inversion formulae @xcite , which amounts , however , to computating rather complex integrals . here",
    "we will use instead a more straightforward approach , identifying @xmath80 from the expansion of @xmath102 into the series in eq.([def fonction generatrice ] ) . to do this ,",
    "we first expand @xmath102 into a series in powers of @xmath108 , which gives ( if @xmath109 which is always possible )    @xmath110    next , expanding @xmath111 in series in powers of @xmath106 , we rewrite eq.([sum ] ) as a multiple series of the form    @xmath112    where @xmath113 denote the binomial coefficients .",
    "lastly , gathering the terms with equal powers of @xmath114 and @xmath106 , we find from eq.([mul ] ) that @xmath80 is given explicitly by    @xmath115}{4 ( 1 + \\delta + { \\cal p}/4 ) } , \\label{h en fonction de f}\\ ] ]    where    @xmath116    with @xmath117 in which equation @xmath118 denotes the modified bessel function , while the parameter @xmath119 ( which appears to be an important control parameter and which will be repeatedly used in what follows ) is defined as    @xmath120    and @xmath121 note , that @xmath122 can be thought off , in view of the form of eq.([diffu ] ) , as the generating function for the probability of occupancy of the site @xmath123 ( the lattice green function ) for a particular type of two - dimensional plya random walk , whose structure function is defined by eq.([struc ] ) ( see , e.g. refs.@xcite and @xcite for more details ) .",
    "now , two comments on the just - derived expression for @xmath80 , eq.([h en fonction de f ] ) , are in order .",
    "first of all , we note that eq.([h en fonction de f ] ) is not closed , since it contains on the right - hand - side unknown functions ; namely , @xmath124 and @xmath125 .",
    "second , all @xmath80 are functions of the tracer terminal velocity , which still remains undefined . consequently",
    ", in the remainder we have to find @xmath126 and @xmath127 as functions of the microscopic parameters , ( such as @xmath128 , @xmath129 , @xmath27 and etc . ) , and @xmath0 , and then , inserting the obtained expression for @xmath130 to eq.([vitesse ] ) , derive a closed with respect to @xmath0 equation .    as a matter of fact",
    ", the deviations from @xmath1 in the immediate vicinity of the tracer , i.e. @xmath126 and @xmath127 , can be found directly from eq.([h en fonction de f ] ) .",
    "setting @xmath131 , @xmath132 and @xmath133,@xmath134 , we find from eq.([h en fonction de f ] ) that @xmath135 and @xmath127 obey the following system of linear algebraic equations    @xmath136    where the column - matrices @xmath137 and @xmath138 are defined as    @xmath139    while the square matrix @xmath140 has the form    @xmath141    where @xmath142 and @xmath143 ( @xmath144 ) are the finite difference operators of unit step in eq.([second ] ) ( ( [ first ] ) ) , acting on the variable @xmath100 ( @xmath101 ) .",
    "to define the tracer terminal velocity , we merely have to know @xmath130 .",
    "it follows from eqs .",
    "( [ system ] ) to ( [ a ] ) that @xmath130 is given by    @xmath145    where @xmath146 is the matrix obtained from ( [ a ] ) by replacing the first column by @xmath138 .",
    "now , we are in position to obtain a closed equation , which determines implicitly the tracer particle terminal velocity in terms of the parameters @xmath128 , @xmath129 , @xmath1 and @xmath88 . substituting eqs.([h ] ) and",
    "( [ def h ] ) into eq.([vitesse ] ) , we find that @xmath0 obeys    @xmath147^{-1},\\ ] ]    where the first term is the mean field result for the tracer velocity ( see eq .",
    "( [ mean - field ] ) ) , obtained under assumption that the monolayer is perfectly stirred ; terms in brackets stem from non - linear cooperative effects associated with formation of inhomogeneous density profiles , whose characteristic properties depend parametrically on the tracer velocity .",
    "equation ( [ speed ] ) , which is the main general analytical result of our paper , is certainly too complicated to be solvable in the general case . below we will study some of its asymptotical solutions",
    "in this section we consider the asymptotical behavior of the tracer particle velocity and density profiles at a fixed distance from the tracer in the limit of slow and fast particles diffusion ( @xmath100 and @xmath101 are taken arbitrary but fixed , while @xmath148 is allowed to vary ) .",
    "as well , we will also specify different regimes corresponding to the cases with @xmath149 and @xmath150 , which may be realized at different monolayer densities .",
    "we note that such an analysis turns out to be rather non - trivial , which happens not only because of the non - linearity of the equations involved , but chiefly due to the non - uniformity of the asymptotical expansions with respect to the parameter @xmath92 . as a matter of fact ,",
    "such a non - uniformity is just the consequence of the qualitatively different behavior occurring in the system with explicitly conserved ( @xmath151 ) and non - conserved ( @xmath152 ) particles number .",
    "consequently , the results for the system without adsorption and desorption can not be obtained as a limit @xmath153 of the corresponding results with arbitrary ( even vanishingly small ) values of @xmath92 .",
    "lastly , we note that the limits @xmath154 ( or @xmath155 ) and @xmath156 do not commute ; hence , we consider the asymptotical behavior of the density profiles at large distances from the tracer separately in section 6 .",
    "consider first the asymptotical behavior of @xmath0 in the limit of a vanishingly small diffusion coefficient @xmath148 of the monolayer particles , @xmath155 , which situation can be thought off as a weakly perturbed original langmuir model ( @xmath157 ) .",
    "it appears , as we have already remarked , that this asymptotical behavior can be different in the case when the particles number in the monolayer is not explicitly conserved , i.e. when both @xmath158 , and in the case with a conserved particles number , when both @xmath69 but their ratio is fixed , @xmath159 .",
    "consequently , we have to study these two cases separately .    _",
    "a. non - conserved particles number_. we assume first that both @xmath128 and @xmath129 are non - zero , such that @xmath160 , which means that adsorption and desorption do change the occupation of each site . in this case , it seems natural to expect that the tracer will never be blocked and will always continue moving at a constant velocity .",
    "in other words , we anticipate that in this case the velocity attains a constant non - zero value @xmath161 as @xmath155 and hence , that @xmath149 , @xmath162 , which means that @xmath163",
    ". we will refer to this limit of @xmath164 , @xmath162 and @xmath149 as the _ limit ( a)_. we seek then @xmath0 in the form    @xmath165    further on , expanding the denominator in eq.([diffu ] ) in powers of the parameter @xmath119 , we calculate to the first order in powers of @xmath166 the functions @xmath167 involved in eq.([speed ] ) .",
    "these are listed in appendix 1 .",
    "then , substituting the obtained expressions for @xmath168 into eq.([speed ] ) , we have then    @xmath169    and    @xmath170    further on , using eqs.([v0 ] ) and ( [ v1 ] ) , we find the following explicit results for the deviations from the equilibrium mean density @xmath171 in the immediate vicinity of the tracer .",
    "these obey , in the _ limit ( a ) _ :    @xmath172    @xmath173    and    @xmath174    as it could be expected intuitively , @xmath175 and @xmath176 , which means that there is a condensed , `` jammed '' region in front of the tracer , and a depleted region past the tracer . on the other hand ,",
    "the fact that @xmath177 and that @xmath124 under certain conditions are non - monotonous functions of @xmath1 appear to be non - trivial .",
    "we will discuss the characteristic properties of these two regions at the end of this section and in the section [ sec : asympt - forms - dens ] .",

    "<S> we study the dynamics of a tracer particle , which performs a totally directed random walk in an adsorbed monolayer composed of mobile hard - core particles undergoing continuous exchanges with a vapour phase . in terms of a mean - field - type approach , based on the decoupling of the tracer - particle - particle correlation functions into the product of pairwise , tracer - particle correlations , </S>",
    "<S> we determine the density profiles of the monolayer particles , as seen from the stationary moving tracer , and calculate its terminal velocity , @xmath0 . in the general case the latter is determined implicitly , as the solution of a certain transcendental equation . in two extreme limits of slow and fast monolayer particles diffusion , </S>",
    "<S> we obtain explicit asymptotic forms of @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> we show next that the density profile in the monolayer is strongly inhomogeneous : in front of the stationary moving tracer the local density is higher than the average value , @xmath1 , and approaches @xmath1 as an exponential function of the distance from the tracer . past the tracer </S>",
    "<S> the local density is lower than @xmath1 and the approach to @xmath1 may proceed differently depending whether the particles number in the monolayer is not or is explicitly conserved . in the former case </S>",
    "<S> the approach is described by an exponential dependence with a different characteristic length , compared to the behavior in front of the tracer ; in the latter case , the density tends to @xmath1 algebraically . </S>",
