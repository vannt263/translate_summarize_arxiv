    "in the theory of strongly correlated electrons there are at present still numerous open problems , both regarding the basic understanding of phenomena and even more of the methods of calculation and sensible approximations . among such theoretical challenges are also electronic transport quantities , such as electrical conductivity , the electronic heat conductivity , the thermopower and the hall constant . in usual metals and semiconductors the transport theory , based on the boltzmann semiclassical approach as well as the quantum calculation of relevant scattering mechanisms , involving impurities and electron - phonon coupling , date back to the beginning of then solid state theory .",

    "we will consider only homogeneous systems without any disorder , so the relevant processes in the solid state are electron - phonon scattering and the electron - electron ( coulomb ) repulsion .",
    "when the latter becomes strong it is expected to dominate also the transport quantities . in this case",
    "there appear evidently fundamentally new questions :    \\a ) the repulsion can transform a metal ( conductor ) into an ( mott - hubbard ) insulator at @xmath0 which radically changes transport quantities , both in the ground state as well as at finite temperatures @xmath5 .",

    "analytical results in 1d indicate that @xmath67 at half filling persists in the hubbard model at all @xmath88 , whereby the dependence @xmath89 is between both limits @xmath70 and @xmath83 .",

    "the metal - insulator transition in higher dimensions is more difficult and open subject and there are no exact analytical results @xcite . still it is established that in the 2d hubbard model there is an insulator at half filling for arbitrary @xmath92 due to the nesting of the fermi surface .",

    "@xmath102 is irrelevant since a singular @xmath24 term dominates at low @xmath103 .",
    "we will see that such a case is realized in a number of nontrivial integrable many - fermion models .",
    "\\c ) the situation with @xmath104 and @xmath105 would correspond to an _ ideal insulator _",

    "this is clearly a very unusual possibility , for which so far at least indications exist in integrable systems @xcite .",
    "it is plausible that integrable systems can have anomalous transport properties . in classical systems",
    "this observation is well established . on the other hand ,",
    "the proposition that integrable quantum many - body systems show dissipationless transport at finite temperatures is rather recent @xcite .",
    "the key to this idea comes from a study of the drude weight at finite temperatures @xmath106 . since all integrable",
    "many - body fermionic models are in 1d , we will further restrict ourselves to 1d , although some statements are more general .",
    "it is convenient to discuss @xmath107 with a generalization of the original kohn s approach @xcite for zero temperature , by relating @xmath107 to the thermal average of curvatures @xmath108 of energy levels @xmath56 subject to the fictitious flux @xmath109 .",
    "since the flux induces the perturbation @xmath110 , we can expand the eigenenergies @xmath111 up to the second order in @xmath112 , @xmath113 following eq.([ec2 ] ) ) we can then write @xmath107 as @xmath114 i.e. in analogy to @xmath0 case @xmath23 can be expressed in terms of curvatures of levels , at @xmath5 weighted with their boltzmann factors .",

    "such an approach has been used already in the theory of conduction in disordered systems .",
    "the first model we study is a toy model of dissipation .",
    "the hamiltonian describing a single ( tagged ) particle interacting with a bath of spinless fermions is @xmath131 where @xmath132 are operators for spinless fermions ( without charge , i.e. not sensitive to the flux ) and @xmath133 for the tagged particle on a chain with p.b.c .",

    "<S> lectures deal with the theory of electronic transport , in particular with the electrical conductivity , in systems dominated by strong electron - electron repulsion . </S>",
    "<S> the concept of charge stiffness is introduced to distinguish conductors and insulators at @xmath0 , but as well usual resistors , possible ideal conductors and ideal insulators at finite temperature . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that the latter singular transport appears in many integrable systems of interacting fermions , the evidence coming from the relation with level dynamics , from the existence of conserved quantities as well as from numerical studies and exact results . </S>",
    "<S> then , exact duagonalization approaches for the calculation of static and dynamical quantities in small correlated systems are described , with the emphasis on the finite - temperature lanczos method applicable to transport quantities . </S>",
    "<S> finally , anomalous dynamical conductivity within the planar single - band model is discussed in relation with experiments on cuprates .    </S>",
