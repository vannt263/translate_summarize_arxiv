    "@xcite symmetry breaking is achieved via gravitational interactions and the vast susy parameter space is reduced to only five parameters : the common trilinear coupling at the gut scale @xmath1 ; the sign of the higgsino mixing parameter @xmath2 ; the ratio of the higgs vacuum expectation values tan@xmath3 ; the common scalar and gaugino masses at the gut scale @xmath4 and @xmath5 , respectively . at the tevatron ,",
    "the production of squarks ( @xmath6 ) and gluinos ( @xmath7 ) , super - partners of quarks and gluons , constitutes one of the most promising channels because of the strong couplings involved .",
    "the cascade decay of gluinos and squarks into quarks and gluons will result in a final state consisting of several jets plus missing transverse energy ( @xmath8 ) coming from the neutralinos , which leave cdf undetected .",
    "the inclusive search  @xcite for @xmath9 and @xmath10 is performed using 2.0 @xmath11 of data collected by the cdf detector in run ii  @xcite . a msugra scenario with @xmath12 , @xmath13 and tan@xmath14 is assumed .",
    "the gluino - squark mass plane is scanned via variation of the parameters @xmath4 ( @xmath15 ) and @xmath5 ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "the pythia  @xcite monte carlo program with the isasugra implementation is used to predict the susy spectrum at the tev scale .",
    "light flavor @xmath9 masses are considered degenerate , while 2-to-2 processes involving stop ( @xmath17 ) and sbottom ( @xmath18 ) production are excluded to avoid strong theoretical dependence on the mixing in the third generation .",
    "signal samples are normalized to the next - to - leading - order ( nlo ) cross section calculated with prospino  @xcite .",
    "the sm backgrounds are dominated by qcd multi - jets processes where @xmath8 comes from partially reconstructed jets in the final state .",
    "other sources of backgrounds are z and w production in association with jets , top and diboson production where @xmath8 is mostly due to the presence of neutrinos or muons in the final state .",
    "the estimation of both signal and background yields relies on mc techniques .",
    "the background model is tested in different control regions defined to enhance a particular background contribution .",
    "a good agreement is always observed between data and sm prediction in all the control regions .    for best sensitivity across the @xmath19 plane ,",
    "three different analyses are developed , requiring at least 2 , 3 or 4 jets in the final state .",
    "the rejection of distinct sm backgrounds relies on specific cuts on kinematic variables including the transverse energy of the leading jets , the @xmath8 of the event , and the angle between the @xmath8 and the direction of the jets .",
    "different selection criteria are defined for each final state to enhance the signal over background separation in different regions of the msugra phase space .",
    "a detailed study of the systematic uncertainties is carried out for each final state : the dominant systematic on the signal efficiencies and sm background yields comes from the @xmath20 uncertainty on the jet energy scale ( jes ) .",
    "this translates into a @xmath21 and @xmath22 uncertainty on the signal and background estimation , respectively .",
    "other systematic uncertainties are related to the modeling of the initial- and final - state radiation ( isr / fsr ) and the choice of renormalization scale and pdfs . finally , a @xmath23 uncertainty on the integrated luminosity is also included .",
