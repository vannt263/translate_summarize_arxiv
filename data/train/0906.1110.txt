    "our exact diagonalization study is limited to a small cluster , and it can not exclude a priori that thermalization appears for larger system sizes : this would require that the diagonal ensemble converges to the microcanonical one , which ultimately converges to the canonical ensemble in the thermodynamic limit .      here",

    "repeating this scaling analysis for a fine mesh of parameter space leads to the confirmation of the supersolid phase shown in fig .",
    "2b of the main letter .",
    "a word of caution is necessary in the case of long - time evolutions .",
    "the truncation of the hilbert space , inherent in all numerical algorithms for time evolution not based on full exact diagonalization [ 16 ] , has the general effect that the accuracy of the results rapidly degrades with time , and the instantaneous measurements become practically unreliable in the long - time limit .",
    "we observe , however , that observables averaged over time intervals @xmath123 do converge with high precision upon variation of the bond dimension @xmath124 . these time averaged results are indeed the object of the scaling analysis in fig .",
