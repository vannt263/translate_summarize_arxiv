    "the collective features of many quantum systems are driven by the tendency of the constituent particles to form pairs which translates into the existence of a strong attractive pairing interaction . in atomic nuclei",
    "the correlations between pairs of nucleons give rise to pair - vibrational states which occur when nucleons are collectively excited across a gap in the single - particle spectrum  @xcite .",
    "the conditions for the existence of such states are level degeneracies just above and below the gap and an appropriate value for the pairing interaction strength . given these conditions , there exist excited ( pair - vibrational ) states with energies substantially less than the energy required to promote a pair of nucleons across the gap . in such cases the correlation energy in the excited state",
    "is comparable to or larger than it is in the ground state .",
    "the problem of pair vibrations has been previously studied for a hamiltonian with like - particle pairing  @xcite . however in systems such as nuclei with two different kinds of particles , the pairing interaction has both isoscalar ( @xmath0 ) and isovector ( @xmath1 ) components .",
    "the interaction between identical nucleons is of pure isovector character while the neutron - proton interaction has both an isoscalar and an isovector component .",
    "since there is no _ a priori _ reason for the isoscalar pairing to vanish  empirically it is found to be of the same order as isovector pairing  both modes are present in nuclei , rendering the problem of pair vibrations in nuclei considerably more complex but also richer .    in this letter",
    "we investigate the nature of pair - vibrational states in the presence of isoscalar and isovector pairing . using a variational configuration - interaction ( vci )  @xcite method ,",
    "we solve a many - body problem for neutrons and protons distributed over levels interacting through the two types of pairing with adjustable strengths .",
    "this method is tested by comparing to solvable cases and is found to be excellent for the lowest eigenstates",
    ". we then present results for more realistic choices of the strengths and parameters of the model hamiltonian , and study the influence of these modifications on the character of the pair vibrations .",

    "each levels has an angular momentum @xmath18 and accomodates two neutrons and two protons .",
    "because all levels have @xmath18 , the @xmath0 @xmath19 and @xmath20 modes play an important role in determining correlations in the wave functions and are in fact equivalent to the @xmath21 and @xmath22 @xmath1 modes .",
    "we consider 16 neutrons and 16 protons here so that for zero pairing strengths the ground state has all levels filled up to the gap and the lowest pair excitations are at 2  mev .",
    "we carry out calculations for several ( off - diagonal ) interaction strengths @xmath23 , 0.10 , 0.15 , 0.20 and 0.30  mev .",

    "if we group the single - particle levels into two sets at different energies , we obtain a two - level so(8 ) problem which is no longer analytically but still numerically solvable through the diagonalization of matrices of modest size  @xcite .",
    "this is true for the lowest eigenstates of the pairing hamiltonian which are of low seniority ( provided the pairing force is attractive ) and for which the necessary coupling coefficients [ for @xmath27 and @xmath28 are known  @xcite .",
    "the current problem of eight - plus - eight @xmath18 levels is equivalent to a two - level so(8 ) description in which each level has a spatial degeneracy of eight , _",

    "these exact solutions provide a very valuable test for the approximate solutions described below .",
    "_ we again set @xmath24 but diagonal matrix elements are now 2.4 times the off - diagonal ones .",
    "our motivation is that the increased value of the diagonal matrix elements explains the wigner energy anomaly  @xcite and also the discrepancy between ` observed ' single - particle gaps and those obtained from woods - saxon potentials in @xmath29 nuclei  @xcite . in the so(8 )",
    "model of refs .",
    "@xcite it is also possible to take unequal diagonal and off - diagonal pairing strengths , if only two levels are considered .",
