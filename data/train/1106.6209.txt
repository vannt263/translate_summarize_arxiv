    "anisotropic flow @xcite measurements provide one of the most important tools to probe the properties of the medium generated in heavy - ion collisions .",
    "anisotropic flow results at rhic have yielded the evidence for the creation of strongly interacting matter , which appears to behave as an almost ideal fluid . in non - central heavy - ion collisions",
    "the initial volume of the interacting system is anisotropic in coordinate space . due to multiple interactions this anisotropy",
    "is transferred to momentum space , and is then quantified via so - called flow harmonics @xmath4 @xcite . in essence , anisotropic flow analysis is the measurement of flow harmonics @xmath4 .    due to the ellipsoidal collision geometry ,",
    "the dominant harmonic in non - central collisions is @xmath0 ( _ elliptic flow _ ) . in november 2010 , 10 days after the first heavy - ion collisions were delivered by the lhc , the alice collaboration reported the initial measurement of @xmath0 at @xmath5 tev @xcite .",
    "the primary new result was that integrated elliptic flow at lhc energies is about 30% larger than at rhic energies , while the differential elliptic flow @xmath6 corresponds closely to the values measured at rhic .",
    "the observed increase of @xmath7 in integrated elliptic flow is attributed to larger radial flow at lhc energies  @xcite . in these proceedings",
    "we report on charged particle anisotropic flow measurements with an emphasis on the centrality dependence of @xmath0 and the new results for other harmonics .",
    "the results presented in this article were obtained from a data sample comprising roughly 5 m minimum bias pb - pb collisions at @xmath5  tev , after online and offline event selection was applied .",
    "only the tracks within @xmath8 and @xmath9  gev/@xmath10 and reconstructed with alice main tracking detector time projection chamber ( tpc ) were used in the analysis .",
    "tracks are rejected if their distance of closest approach to the primary vertex is larger than 0.3 cm both in transverse and longitudinal direction .",
    "finally , tracks are required to have at least 70 reconstructed space points in the tpc and a @xmath11 per tpc cluster @xmath12 .",
    "offline centrality determination utilized the vzero detectors @xcite .",
    "flow analysis with 2- and multi - particle azimuthal correlations has several well - known systematic biases , in particular the so - called _ nonflow _ contribution to azimuthal correlations .",
    "nonflow is a systematic bias originating from the correlations involving only few particles .",
    "as first pointed out in @xcite , such nonflow correlations are largely suppressed by using multi - particle cumulants in the analysis .",
    "the other important systematic bias stems from multiplicity and flow fluctuations .",
    "the magnitude of multiplicity and trivial flow fluctuations , due to the size of centrality bins , can be estimated by comparing for instance the results of flow analysis in centrality bins of varying width .",
    "the systematic bias on @xmath0 due to multiplicity and trivial flow fluctuations was estimated and found to be negligible .",
    "inefficiencies in the detector s azimuthal acceptance will strongly bias any measurement based on azimuthal correlations .",
    "cumulants can be generalized to deal with such a systematic bias ; however , a more practical approach used in this analysis was to use only the tracks reconstructed with tpc detector , making the bias negligible since the tpc has highly uniform azimuthal acceptance .",
    "the analysis was performed using the cumulant method introduced by ollitrault _",
    "et al _ @xcite .",
    "this cumulant method was based on the formalism of generating functions , which has its own systematic biases and limitations .",
    "an improved version of cumulant method , which allows for fast and exact calculation of all multi - particle cumulants , was recently proposed in @xcite . to make a distinction between two versions of cumulant method the latter one",
    "is referred to as @xmath13-cumulants ( qc ) .",
    "( left ) . the centrality dependence of @xmath0 estimated with different order cumulants ( right).,title=\"fig:\",width=302,height=260 ]   ( left ) . the centrality dependence of @xmath0 estimated with different order cumulants ( right).,title=\"fig:\",width=302,height=260 ]    flow contribution to cumulants",
    "is well understood and quantified @xcite : @xmath14 from above equations it is clear that in case the measured cumulants are dominated by flow correlations they will exhibit the characteristic flow signature @xmath15 irrespective of the order of harmonic for which cumulants are being measured . in fig .",
    "[ fig : cumulants ] ( left ) , cumulants for harmonic @xmath16 are shown for the centrality range 0 - 80% , with centrality bin width of 1% up to centrality 20% and centrality bin width of 2% for centralities beyond 20% @xcite .",
    "clearly , the cumulants exhibit the characteristic flow signature .",
    "inversion of eqs .",
    "( [ qcs ] ) yields an independent estimate for the harmonic @xmath0 , to be denoted as @xmath17 and @xmath18 , respectively .",
    "gap was enforced among the particles being correlated in the measurement of the 2-particle cumulant . ]",
    "these independent estimates for elliptic flow are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : cumulants ] ( right ) .",
    "the 2-particle estimate , @xmath19 , was obtained by using two different @xmath20 gaps ( open and filled blue markers ) in order to illustrate the magnitude of nonflow contribution . the nonflow contribution to the 2-particle cumulant scales as @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the multiplicity of the event , meaning that the relative nonflow contribution will be largest in the peripheral events where @xmath22 is smallest , as can be seen on fig .",
    "[ fig : cumulants ] ( right ) . on the other hand ,",
    "all estimates from multi - particle cumulants are in an excellent agreement with each other ( red , green and black markers ) which indicates that already with the 4-particle cumulant nonflow is greatly suppressed so that there is little gain in suppressing it further by using 6- and 8-particle cumulants .",
    "this agreement between multi - particle cumulants is also due to the fact that , to leading order , they experience the same systematic bias due to statistical flow fluctuations . finally , the difference between 2- and multi - particle estimates can be understood in terms of different ( opposite in signature ) sensitivity to the fluctuations in the initial geometry .",
    "dependence ( right ) of anisotropic flow harmonics  @xcite.,title=\"fig:\",width=302,height=260 ]   dependence ( right ) of anisotropic flow harmonics  @xcite.,title=\"fig:\",width=302,height=260 ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1a_fig3a ] ( left ) the new results for harmonics beyond @xmath0 are presented  @xcite .",
    "the primary new result is that triangular flow , @xmath1 , is not zero .",
    "@xmath1 can not develop as a correlation of all particles with the reaction plane ( the event - ensemble average of odd harmonics must be zero at mid - rapidity due to the symmetry of collision ) , but instead as a correlation with the participant plane of @xmath1 ( event - by - event fluctuations in the initial geometry yields event - by - event triangularity in coordinate space which determines such symmetry plane ) .",
    "a new picture of flow analysis has recently emerged according to which each harmonic has its own participant plane , raising the question of the relation between the different participant planes . as an example , in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1a_fig3a ] ( left ) we demonstrate that the participant planes of @xmath0 and @xmath1 are uncorrelated ( black diamonds ) . triangular flow estimated with 4-particle cumulant ( open blue squares )",
    "is half as large as the corresponding 2-particle estimate ( filled blue squares ) , in agreement with a recent prediction by bhalerao _",
    "et al _ @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1a_fig3a ] ( right ) , the results for @xmath23 dependence of harmonics @xmath24 and @xmath3 are presented  @xcite . for elliptic and triangular flow ,",
    "comparison is made with a models based both on ideal and viscous relativistic hydrodynamics , respectively , with glauber initial conditions ( taking into account the role of event - by - event fluctuations of the initial conditions ) as was proposed in  @xcite . within this particular model",
    "the overall magnitude of elliptic and triangular flow agrees with the measurement , but the details of the @xmath23 dependence are not well described .",
    "in particular , the magnitude of @xmath25 is described better with ideal hydro with @xmath26 , while for @xmath27 the model with @xmath28 provides a better description , meaning that this model fails to describe well @xmath0 and @xmath1 simultaneously .",
