    "a wide range of problems in physics concerns systems with long - range interactions . however , their statistical and dynamical properties are much less understood than those of short - range systems @xcite .",
    "one finds examples of long - range interacting systems in astrophysics @xcite , plasma physics @xcite , hydrodynamics @xcite , atomic physics @xcite , nuclear physics @xcite .",
    "this ubiquitous presence in different physics disciplines alone would itself justify the need for a general and interdisciplinary understanding of the physical and mathematical problems raised by long - range interacting systems .    in this review ,",
    "we are interested in systems with a large number @xmath3 of degrees of freedom , for which a statistical physics approach is mandatory , independently of the specific features of the interactions .",
    "therefore , we will discuss in the following equilibrium and out  of  equilibrium properties of long - range systems relying on the tools of statistical mechanics @xcite .",
    "let us define which is the property of the interaction that makes it short or long - ranged .",
    "we consider systems where the interaction potential is given by the sum , over pairs of the elementary constituents , of a two - body translationally invariant potential .",
    "for sufficiently large distances @xmath4 , the absolute value of the two - body potential is bounded by @xmath5 .",
    "if the positive power @xmath6 is larger than the dimension @xmath2 of the space where the system is embedded , @xmath7 , we define the system to be short - range . otherwise , if @xmath8 , the system is long - range .",
    "the reason for this definition is that , in the large @xmath3 limit all the mathematical and physical differences between short and long - range systems can be traced back to this property of the interaction potential .",
    "we should remark that this definition of the range of the interaction does not coincide with others , where the range is instead defined by a characteristic length appearing in the interaction potential . in this latter definition , any interaction decaying as a power law at large distances , thus without characteristic length , is considered as long range .",
    "however , for the physical and mathematical problems found in the statistical mechanics of many - body systems , the definition used throughout this review is more appropriate , since , as we have stressed , it is related to the interaction property that determines the behavior of such systems for large @xmath3",
    ".    our purpose will be to illustrate , especially through the use of simple models , the peculiar properties of long - range systems , and the tools and techniques that are employed to describe them . to give a flavour of the issues that will be considered",
    ", we would like to begin with a very simple description of the main problems that one faces in the study of these systems .",
    "the aim of equilibrium statistical mechanics is to derive the thermodynamic properties of a macroscopic system from microscopic interactions @xcite .",
    "the connection between micro and macro is realized through the introduction of statistical ensembles .",
    "different thermodynamic potentials describe situations in which different thermodynamic parameters are used in the characterization of the system , and , in the aforementioned connection with the microscopic interactions , different statistical ensembles are related to different thermodynamic potentials .",
    "however , it is usually stated ( and experimentally verified for many physical systems ) that , as far as macroscopic averages are concerned , i.e. in the thermodynamic limit ( @xmath9 , @xmath10 with @xmath11 ) , the predictions of statistical mechanics do not depend on the chosen ensemble .",
    "_ ensemble equivalence _ is related to the fact that , given a sufficient number of macroscopic thermodynamic parameters ( two in a one - component system ) , the others are fixed in the large volume limit , apart from vanishingly small relative fluctuations .",
    "an important feature of long - range systems is that _ ensembles can be inequivalent _ @xcite , and therefore one of the main issues in the statistical mechanics of these systems is a careful examination of the relations between the different ensembles , in particular of the conditions that determine their equivalence or inequivalence .",
    "we emphasize that ensemble inequivalence is not merely a mathematical drawback , but it is the cause , as it will be shown in this review , of physical properties of these systems that could be experimentally verified . probably , one of the most striking features of long - range systems is the possibility to display _ negative specific heat _ in the microcanonical ensemble @xcite .",
    "specific heat is always positive in the canonical ensemble , independently of the nature of the interactions , since it is given by the expectation value of a positive quantity .",
    "it turns out that microcanonical equilibrim contains all informations about canonical equilibrium , while the converse is wrong in case of ensemble inequivalence @xcite .",
    "the discrepancy between the two ensembles extends to other observables related to the response of the system to a change in a thermodynamic parameter : a concrete example will be given discussing magnetic susceptibility .",
    "as far as out  of  equilibrium dynamical properties are concerned , many - body long - range systems again show peculiar behaviors .",
    "the approach to equilibrium of short - range systems is usually characterized by the time scales that govern the equations of motion of the elementary constituents @xcite . for systems without disorder , these time scales are typically small when compared to the observational time scales . sometimes these systems can be trapped in metastable states that last for long times .",
    "these states are local extrema of thermodynamic potentials and , in practical cases , their realization requires a very careful preparation of the system ( e.g. undercooled liquids and superheated solids ) .",
    "if perturbed , the system rapidly converges towards the equilibrium state .",
    "it can also happen that the relaxation time depends on the volume if hydrodynamics modes are present or in coarsening processes .    for long - range systems",
    ", dynamics can be extremely slow and the approach to equilibrium can take a very long time , that increases with the number @xmath3 of elementary constituents @xcite .",
    "this feature is induced by the long - range nature of the interaction itself and is not a consequence of the existence of a collective phenomenon .",
    "the state of the system during this long transient is _ quasi - stationary _",
    "@xcite , since its very slow time evolution allows us to define slowly varying macroscopic observables , like for local equilibrium or quasi - static transformations .",
    "it should be however remarked that quasi - stationary states are not thermodynamic metastable states , since they do not lie on local extrema of equilibrium thermodynamic potentials .",
    "the explanation of their widespread presence should rely only upon the dynamical properties of the systems .",
    "it must be stressed that the nature of quasi - stationary states can be strongly dependent on the initial condition , as it will become clear from the examples that we will give .",
    "in addition , a variety of macroscopic structures can form spontaneously in out  of  equilibrium conditions for isolated systems : a fact that should not be a surprise given that already the equilibrium states of long - range systems are usually inhomogeneous . in short - range systems , macroscopic structures can arise as an effect of an external forcing ( rayleigh - bnard convection , benjamin - feir instability , faraday waves ) @xcite or due to the nonlinearity of the governing equations of motion ( solitons , breathers ) @xcite , but are usually strongly selected by the specific dynamical properties and by the geometrical conditions . all this shows the great richness of the dynamics of long - range systems .",
    "summarizing , a satisfying theoretical framework concerning the behaviour of system with long - range interactions should necessarily address the following aspects :    * for what concerns equilibrium properties , the determination of the physical conditions that determine equivalence or inequivalence of the statistical ensembles and , for the latter case , the relation between macrostates in the different statistical ensembles .",
    "* as for the out  of  equilibrium features , the development of a consistent kinetic theory able to explain the formation of quasi - stationary states and their final relaxation to equilibrium .",
    "although different aspects of systems with long - range interactions have been studied in the past in specific scientific communities , notably astrophysics and plasma physics , this has not constituted a seed for more general theoretical studies . in the last decade or so ,",
    "it has become progressively clear that the ubiquitous presence of long - range forces needs an approach that integrates different methodologies @xcite .",
    "this has induced a widespread interest in long - range systems throughout numerous research groups .",
    "the successive development has led to a better understanding of both the equilibrium and out  of  equilibrium properties of such systems .",
    "time is ripe to summarize what is known on firm basis about the equilibrium statistical mechanics of systems with long - range interactions and to describe the preliminaries of a theory of non equilibrium .    in this review , we have chosen to present the main problems , tools and solutions by discussing paradigmatic examples , which are simple and general enough to be useful also for specific applications .",
    "therefore , we will mostly emphasize :    * the equilibrium statistical mechanics solutions of simple mean - field toy models , which is a first step for understanding phase diagrams of more complex long - range systems ; * the basic ingredients of a kinetic theory of a model able to catch the essential properties of out  of  equilibrium dynamics . *",
    "the analysis of the phase diagram of models with both short and long - range interactions , or with forces that weakly decay in space .",
    "the structure of the review is the following . in section  [ theproblemofadditivity ] , we introduce the subject presenting the definition of long - range interactions and discussing the non additivity property and its consequences . in section  [ physicalexamples ] , we briefly review the relevant physical systems with long - range interactions : gravitational systems , 2d hydrodynamics , 2d elasticity , charged systems , dipolar systems and small systems .",
    "section  [ equilibriumsec ] constitutes the core of the review .",
    "we present there the equilibrium properties of several mean - field models for which one can analytically compute both the free energy and the entropy .",
    "the solution is obtained by different methods , including the powerful large deviation method , which allows to solve models with continuous variables .",
    "dynamics is tackled in section  [ outofequilibrium ] , where the main result reviewed is the widespread presence of quasi - stationary states that hinder relaxation to boltzmann - gibbs equilibrium .",
    "this phenomenon is strongly supported by numerical simulations and can be studied using kinetic equations explicitly devised for long - range interactions ( vlasov , lenard - balescu ) .",
    "few analytical results exist for non mean - field models : we collect some of them in section  [ perspectives ] .",
    "the message is that the introduction of short - range terms does nt spoil the features of mean - field models and that some weakly decaying interactions can be treated rigorously .",
    "finally , we draw conclusions and we discuss some perspectives in section  [ conclusions ] .",
    "in order to easily illustrate the issues of _ extensivity _ and _ additivity _ , it is useful to consider a concrete example and restrict ourselves to the energy as the thermodynamic extensive variable .",
    "we employ a very simple model that is used in the study of magnetic systems , namely the curie - weiss hamiltonian @xmath12 where the spins @xmath13 are attached to sites labeled by @xmath14 . in this example , the interaction does not decay at all with the distance : indeed , each spin interacts with equal strength with all the other spins .",
    "such systems are usually referred to as mean - field systems . with the @xmath15 prefactor in ( [ hamiladditi ] ) , the total energy increases as @xmath3",
    ", then the energy per spin converges to a finite value in the thermodynamic limit , which is a physically reasonable requirement .",
    "we recall that one can find rigorous definitions of the thermodynamic limit in ruelle s book @xcite .",
    "model ( [ hamiladditi ] ) is _ extensive _ : for a given intensive magnetization @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the extensive magnetization , if one doubles the number of spins the energy doubles . on the other hand ,",
    "hamiltonian  ( [ hamiladditi ] ) is not additive , in spite of the presence of the regularizing factor @xmath15 .",
    "indeed , let us divide the system , schematically pictured in fig .",
    "[ additivite ] , in two equal parts .",
    "in addition , let us consider the particular case in which all spins in the left part are equal to @xmath18 , whereas all spins in the right part are equal to @xmath19 .",
    "the energy of the two parts is @xmath20 .",
    "however , if one computes the total energy of the system , one gets @xmath21 . since @xmath22 ,",
    "such a system is not additive , at least for this configuration .",
    "one could easily generalize the argument to generic configurations .",
    "the problem is not solved by increasing system size @xmath3 , because the  interaction \" energy @xmath23 increases with @xmath3 .",
    "spins up in domain 1 and @xmath24 spins down in domain 2 . ]",
    "-1truecm    _ extensivity _ in the curie - weiss model is provided by the @xmath15 prefactor in hamiltonian ( [ hamiladditi ] ) , which makes the energy proportional to @xmath3 .",
    "this is the so - called kac prescription @xcite .",
    "this energy rescaling guarantees a competition between energy @xmath25 and entropy @xmath26 , which is crucial for phase transitions . indeed , introducing the free energy @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is temperature",
    ", kac prescription implies that the two competing terms on the r.h.s . both scale as @xmath3 , since temperature is intensive and entropy scales like @xmath3 .",
    "this latter scaling deserves a further analysis which will be developed later on .",
    "intuitively , the fact that the interaction is long - range does not alter the density of states , which usually grows factorially with @xmath3 .",
    "an alternative prescription would be to make temperature extensive @xmath29 , in such a way that energy and entropy term of the free energy both scale as @xmath30 .",
    "the two prescriptions give equivalent physical consequences . in systems with kinetic energy , being temperature the average kinetic energy per particle ,",
    "rescaling temperature corresponds to a renormalization of velocities , and finally of the time scale .    after having defined the two distinct concepts of _ extensivity _ and",
    "_ additivity _ with reference to a specific model , let us clarify more generally these two notions .",
    "indeed , it is very important , as a first step , to give the general definitions of _ extensivity _ and _ additivity _ , and to clarify the distinction between these two concepts .",
    "it is convenient to first consider the situation that one encounters in short - range systems .",
    "we can imagine to divide a system at equilibrium in two parts occupying equal volumes",
    ". some thermodynamic variables of each half of the system will be equal to the corresponding ones of the total system , others will be halved .",
    "temperature and pressure are examples of the first kind of thermodynamic variables : they do not depend on the size of the system and are called intensive variables .",
    "energy , entropy and free energy are variables of the second kind ; their value is proportional to system size , i.e. to the number of elementary constituents ( for given values of the intensive variables ) , and they are called extensive variables . the property that the size dependent thermodynamic variables are proportional to system size is called _ extensivity _ , and systems with this property are called extensive . the specific value of extensive variables ( e.g. , the energy per unit particle , or per unit mass , or per unit volume ) give rise to new intensive quantities . considering the energy of a system , we see that it has also the property of _ additivity _ , that consists in the following . dividing the systems in two macroscopic parts , the total energy @xmath25 will be equal to @xmath31 , with @xmath32 the energy of the @xmath33-th part , and @xmath34 the interaction energy between the two parts . in the thermodynamic limit the ratio @xmath35 tends to zero ; therefore in this limit @xmath36 .",
    "this property is called _ additivity _ ; systems with this property ( for the energy as well as for other size dependent quantities ) are called additive .",
    "it is evident that extensivity and additivity are related .",
    "indeed , in the definition of extensivity just given , we could not have concluded that the energy of each part of the system is half the total energy , if the interaction energy @xmath34 would not be negligible .",
    "additivity implies extensivity ( thus non extensivity implies non additivity ) , but not the reverse , since the interaction energy might scale with @xmath3 , as in the curie - weiss model .",
    "this comment applies more generally to all long - range systems .",
    "the unusual properties of these systems derive from the lack of additivity .",
    "we have just shown that mean - field systems like the curie - weiss model can be made extensive using kac s trick",
    ". however , extensive systems could be non additive . here",
    ", we will discuss the case of interactions that decay as a power law at large distances .",
    "we will show that the energy @xmath37 of a particle ( excluding self - energy ) diverges if the potential does not decay sufficiently fast , implying that the total energy grows superlinearly with volume at constant density , which violates extensivity .",
    "these interactions are called _ long - range _ or _ non integrable _ , just referring to this divergence of the energy . energy convergence can be restored by an appropriate generalization of kac s trick .",
    "let us estimate the energy @xmath37 by considering a given particle placed at the center of a sphere of radius @xmath38 where the other particles are homogeneously distributed .",
    "we will exclude the contribution to @xmath37 coming from the particles located in a small neighborhood of radius @xmath39 ( see fig .",
    "[ sphere ] ) .",
    "this is motivated by the necessity to regularize the divergence of the potential at small distances , which has nothing to do with its long - range nature .     of a particle .",
    "it is a spherical shell of outer radius @xmath38 and inner radius @xmath39 . ]",
    "-1truecm    if the other particles interact with the given one via a potential that at large distances decays like @xmath40 , we obtain in @xmath2dimensions @xmath41 , \\hskip 2truecm \\mbox{if}\\ \\alpha \\ne d~,\\ ] ] where @xmath42 is the generic density ( e.g. mass , charge ) , @xmath43 is the coupling constant and @xmath44 is the angular volume in dimension @xmath2 ( @xmath45 in @xmath46 , @xmath47 in @xmath48 , etc . ) .",
    "when increasing the radius @xmath38 , the energy @xmath37 remains finite if and only if @xmath7 .",
    "this implies that the total energy @xmath25 will increase linearly with the volume @xmath49 , i.e. the system is extensive .",
    "such interactions are the usual short - range ones . on the contrary , if @xmath8 the energy @xmath37 grows with volume as @xmath50 ( logarithmically in the marginal case @xmath51 ) .",
    "this implies that the total energy @xmath25 will increase superlinearly , @xmath52 , with volume .",
    "however , analogously to the kac s prescription , one can redefine the coupling constant @xmath53 and get a perfectly extensive system .",
    "mean - field models , like hamiltonian  ( [ hamiladditi ] ) , correspond to the value @xmath54 , since the interaction does not depend on the distance , and one recovers the usual kac s rescaling .",
    "cases where the energy grows superlinearly define the long - range nature of the interaction .",
    "however , as we have shown for mean - field systems , the fact that energy can be made extensive , does not imply that the system is additive .",
    "implications of the lack of additivity for long - range systems will be discussed throughout the paper .",
    "space can have a non - convex shape for systems with long - range interactions , such that if @xmath55 and @xmath56 can be realized macroscopically , this is not necessarily true for all the states joining these two along the straight dashed line . ]",
    "let us consider the space of the extensive thermodynamic parameters . to be specific , as in fig .",
    "[ convexspace ] , we consider the @xmath57 plane of energy and magnetization ( [ defmagnetization ] ) .",
    "the attainable region in this space is always convex when only short - range interactions are present .",
    "this property is a direct consequence of additivity .",
    "consider two different subsystems with two different energies @xmath58 and @xmath59 , and two different magnetization values @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "introducing a parameter @xmath62 taking values between @xmath63 and @xmath64 , depending on the relative size of the subsystems , the system obtained by combining the two subsystems has an energy @xmath65 , and a magnetization @xmath66 .",
    "any value of @xmath62 between @xmath63 and @xmath64 is realized thermodynamically , just varying the relative size of the two subsystems .",
    "this is exactly the _",
    "convexity property _ of the attainable region of the space of thermodynamic parameters .",
    "in particular , one can consider two subsystems with the same energy but different magnetization .",
    "varying the relative size of the two subsystems , the combined system will have the same energy and any possible magnetization between the two values of the two subsystems .",
    "it is important to stress that the convexity property is possible if additivity is satisfied , since the interaction energy between the two subsystems has been neglected . as already remarked , the additivity property is generically valid for large enough and short - range interacting systems .",
    "moreover convexity implies that the space of thermodynamic parameters is connected .    on the contrary ,",
    "systems with long - range interactions are not additive , and thus intermediate values of extensive parameters are not necessarily accessible ( see fig .",
    "[ convexspace ] ) .",
    "this feature has profound consequences on the dynamics of systems with long - range interactions .",
    "gaps may open up in the space of extensive variables .",
    "since the space of thermodynamic parameters is no more connected , _",
    "ergodicity breaking _",
    "might appear when considering continuous microcanonical dynamics of such a system .",
    "we will discuss again this question in detail in sec .",
    "[ generalizedhmf ] by emphasizing simple examples .",
    "when defining the long - range nature of the interaction , care must be taken of the specific nature of the microscopic variables .",
    "these could be divided in two classes : the coordinates related to the translational degrees of freedom ( e.g. cartesian coordinates ) , and those giving the internal state of each particle ( e.g. spin variables ) . both could be either continuous or discrete .",
    "when coordinates take fixed discrete values , one speaks of _ lattice systems_. as for the internal degrees of freedom the variables could be discrete ( e.g. spin systems ) or continuous ( e.g. systems of rotators ) .    for systems with continuous translational degrees of freedom that do not possess internal degrees of freedom ,",
    "the potential energy can be written in the general form @xmath67 where @xmath68 are cartesian coordinates in @xmath2-dimensional space and we assume that the translationally invariant pair potential @xmath49 depends only on the modulus of the distance between two particles . systems of gravitational point masses or coulomb point charges fall into this category .    in a lattice system ,",
    "for which each site @xmath33 of a @xmath2-dimensional lattice , located by the position vector @xmath69 , hosts a particle possessing one or more internal degrees of freedom , collectively denoted by the vector @xmath70 ( the dimensionality of this vector is independent of @xmath2 ) , the potential energy can be written as @xmath71 where the coupling constants @xmath72 are translationally and rotationally invariant ( i.e. , they depend only on @xmath73 ) .",
    "we allow also the presence of an external field that couples to the particles via the function @xmath74 with a strength @xmath75 . as pointed out above",
    ", the variables @xmath70 may take continuous or discrete values .",
    "we have already discussed in the previous subsection that long - range systems of type ( [ potcont ] ) are those for which , at large distance , @xmath76 with @xmath8 .",
    "similarly , long - range lattice systems ( [ potlat ] ) can be characterized by a slow decay of the coupling constants @xmath72 .",
    "if these latter behave at large distance like @xmath77 with @xmath8 , the system is long - range .",
    "the energy grows also in this case superlinearly with the volume and one will need to introduce a kac rescaling factor . at variance with systems of type ( [ potcont ] )",
    "we need not worry about the behavior at short distances , because the lattice regularizes any possible divergence .",
    "a kinetic energy term can be added to the potential energy one for systems of type ( [ potcont ] ) and for lattice systems ( [ potlat ] ) when the variables are continuous .    in this review",
    ", we will mostly concentrate our attention on lattice systems . since they can not display any short distance singularity",
    ", their thermodynamic and dynamical behaviour highlights the essential features of long - range interactions .",
    "therefore , these systems are more suitable to present an overview of the main results and of the tools used to deal with long - range interactions .",
    "let us recall that , in @xmath48 , neglecting the dependence on the number of particles @xmath3 and on the volume @xmath49 , the microcanonical partition function ( proportional to the number of microstates with a given energy @xmath25 ) is defined as @xmath78 where @xmath79 are the phase space coordinates , @xmath80 is the hamiltonian and we forget for the moment about multiplicative @xmath3-dependent factors and dimensional constants ( for a more precise definition see section  [ equilibriumsec ] ) .",
    "the entropy is defined via the classical boltzmann formula @xmath81 where we adopt units for which the boltzmann constant @xmath82 is equal to @xmath64 .",
    "the non additivity has strong consequences on the construction of the canonical ensemble from the microcanonical .",
    "the reasoning usually goes as follows .",
    "one considers an isolated system with energy @xmath25 , that we divide into a  small \" part with energy @xmath58 ( the subsystem of interest ) and a  large \" part with energy @xmath59 which plays the role of the bath .",
    "the additivity of the energy implies that the probability distribution that the `` small '' system has an energy  @xmath58 , let us call it @xmath83 , is given by @xmath84 using the entropy to express @xmath85 and expanding the term @xmath86 , one gets @xmath87\\\\ & \\approx & \\exp \\left[s_2(e)-e_1\\left.\\frac{\\partial s_2}{\\partial e}\\right|_e + \\cdots \\right]\\\\ & \\propto & \\omega_2(e)\\;e^{-\\beta e_1}\\ ; , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath88 one would end up with the usual canonical distribution for the system of interest after performing the thermodynamic limit @xcite .",
    "let us however remark that this derivation is valid also before taking the thermodynamic limit .",
    "this has led many authors to develop a thermodynamic formalism for finite systems @xcite .",
    "it is clear that additivity is crucial to justify the factorization hypothesis implied in  ( [ hypprem ] ) , and hence the existence of the canonical distribution .",
    "this hypothesis is clearly violated when the system size is finite , because of a contribution to the entropy coming from the surface that separates the two subsystems . however , after performing the thermodynamic limit , this contribution becomes negligible when the interactions are short - range .",
    "this is not true for long - range interactions which are non additive also in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "this has led the community to split into two different attitudes .",
    "on one side are those who think that the canonical ensemble can not be appropriately defined for long - range interactions and claim that all the analyses should be performed using the microcanonical ensemble @xcite .",
    "although clearly appropriate for isolated system , this approach can not describe open systems . on the other side",
    "are those who stress that the canonical ensemble could be still formally defined and used @xcite . among the two sides are those who attempt operative definitions of a heat bath .",
    "for instance , one has imagined that the heat bath is a short - range system that interacts with the system of interest with short - range interactions , so that the non additivity is due only to the system @xcite .",
    "the failure of the usual derivation of the canonical ensemble suggests that non additive systems might have a very peculiar behavior if they are in contact with a thermal reservoir ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for recent literature on this topic ) .",
    "a third position was recently initiated by bouchet and barr who proposed that when considering systems with long - range interaction , the canonical ensemble does not describe fluctuations of a small part of the whole system .",
    "however , they argued  @xcite that it may describe fluctuations of the whole system when coupled to a thermostat via a negligibly small coupling . this interesting line of thought needs to be pursued theoretically and confirmed by numerical simulations .    in the following section",
    ", we will discuss some physical examples before proceeding to the core of the review .",
    "there are many systems in nature where particles interact with a pair potential that decays at large distances as @xmath89 with @xmath8 .",
    "although these systems are deeply studied in their own sake ( e.g. gravitational many body systems , coulomb systems , systems of vortices , etc . ) , they rarely appear in books of statistical mechanics .",
    "this is of course due to the difficulty to deal with systems that are non extensive and non additive .",
    "we give here a brief sketch of the physics involved in some of these systems .",
    "and the ordinate is the exponent @xmath6 characterizing the spatial decay at large distances of the pair potential . ]",

    "the gravitational problem is particularly difficult because , in addition to the non additivity due to the long - range character of the interaction , one also needs a careful regularization of the potential at short distances to avoid collapse . to be more specific ,",

    "indeed , let us consider @xmath3 gravitating particles grouped together in a finite volume .",
    "a strong decrease of the potential energy of a pair of particles @xmath104 is obtained when @xmath105 tends to @xmath106 .",
    "since the total energy is a conserved quantity , the kinetic energy would correspondingly increase .",
    "this process leads to an increase of the accessible phase volume in the direction of momentum , and hence to an entropy increase .",
    "since the process extends to the limit of zero distance among the particles , it might induce a divergence of the density of states , and then of boltzmann entropy .",
    "however , one can show that this does not happens for @xmath107 and a more subtle derivation @xcite reveals that the entropy integral diverges only when @xmath108 .",
    "it s remarkable that this also corresponds to the transition from an integrable ( @xmath107 ) to a non integrable ( @xmath109 ) gravitational system .",
    "as a consequence of this discussion ,  equilibrium \" states can exist only in association with local entropy maxima @xcite .",
    "besides these unusual properties of the canonical and microcanonical partition functions , self - gravitating systems were historically the first physical system for which ensemble inequivalence was discovered through the phenomenon of negative specific heat .",
    "the possibility of finding a negative specific heat in gravitational systems was already emphasized by emden  @xcite and eddington  @xcite .",
    "the divergence of the phase space volume for gravitational systems was proved by antonov  @xcite , and the fact that this implies negative specific heats was later stressed by lynden - bell  @xcite .",
    "an early remark on the possibility of having a negative specific heat can be found in the seminal review paper on statistical mechanics by maxwell  @xcite .",
    "this was for long time considered a paradox , until thirring  @xcite finally clarified the controversial point by showing that the paradox disappears if one realizes that the microcanonical specific heat can be negative only in the microcanonical ensemble .",
    "therefore , one can attribute to thirring the discovery of ensemble inequivalence .",
    "let s rephrase thirring s argument . in the canonical ensemble ,",
    "the mean value of the energy is computed from the partition function ( [ cutoffgravit ] ) as @xmath110 it is then straightforward to compute the heat capacity at constant volume @xmath111 let s remind that @xmath112 .",
    "this clearly shows that the canonical specific heat is always positive .",
    "notice also that this condition is true for systems of any size , regardless of whether a proper thermodynamic limit exists or not .    for self - gravitating systems at constant energy ( i.e. , in the microcanonical ensemble ) a simple physical argument which justifies the presence of a negative specific heat has been given by lynden - bell @xcite .",
    "it is based on the virial theorem , which , for the gravitational potential , states that @xmath113 where @xmath114 and @xmath115 are the kinetic and potential energy , respectively .",
    "recalling that the total energy @xmath25 is constant @xmath116 where in the second identity we have used the virial theorem ( [ virial ] ) , and since the kinetic energy @xmath114 defines the temperature , one gets @xmath117 loosing its energy , the system becomes hotter .",
    "there is a further difficulty in the case of gravitational interactions : the system is open , i.e. without boundary , strictly speaking .",
    "therefore , the microcanonical partition function ( [ mic ] ) will diverge .",
    "this divergence is actually not peculiar of self - gravitating systems since it would also occur for a perfect gas .",
    "although for gases it is natural to confine them in a box , this is completely unjustified for gravitational systems .",
    "a way out from this pitfall is to consider an expanding universe and reconsider the problem in a wider context @xcite .",

    "a system with a large number of degrees of freedom which can be characterized by a small number of effective parameters , is reminiscent of what happens in thermodynamics  @xcite , where a few macroscopic variables describe the behavior of systems composed of many particles .",
    "statistical mechanics for turbulence is nowadays a very active field of research @xcite , initiated long ago by lars onsager  @xcite .",
    "we will discuss in the following the long - range character of two - dimensional hydrodynamics .",

[ diagramshortlongrange ] ) .",
    "for a finite domain @xmath125 the green s function contains additional surface terms  @xcite , which however gives no contribution to the energy ( [ energyvorticity ] ) if the velocity field is tangent to the boundary of the domain ( no outflow or inflow ) .",
    "another important conserved quantity is enstrophy , defined as @xmath129 ^ 2.\\label{enstrophy}\\ ] ]    the long - range character of the interaction is even more evident if one approximates the vorticity field by @xmath3 point vortices located at @xmath130 , with a given circulation  @xmath131 @xmath132 the energy of the system reads now @xmath133 where we have dropped the self - energy term because , although singular , it would not induce any motion  @xcite . considering the two coordinates of the point vortex on the plane , the equations of motion are @xmath134    the phase - space volume contained inside the energy shell @xmath135 can be written as @xmath136 @xmath137 being the heaviside step function .",
    "the total phase space volume is @xmath138 , where @xmath139 is the area of the domain @xmath125 .",
    "one immediately realizes that @xmath140 is a non - negative increasing function of the energy @xmath25 with limits @xmath141 and @xmath138 .",
    "therefore , its derivative , which is nothing but the microcanonical partition function ( [ mic ] ) , is given by @xmath142 and is a non - negative function going to zero at both extremes @xmath143 .",
    "thus the function must achieve at least one maximum at some finite value @xmath144 where @xmath145 .",
    "for energies @xmath146 , @xmath147 will then be negative . using the entropy @xmath148",
    ", one thus gets that the inverse temperature @xmath149 is negative for @xmath146 . this argument for the existence of negative temperatures",
    "was proposed by onsager  @xcite two years before the experiment on nuclear spin systems by purcell and pound  @xcite reported the presence of negative  spin temperatures \" .",
    "onsager also pointed out that negative temperatures could lead to the formation of large - scale vortices by clustering of smaller ones .",
    "although , as anticipated , the canonical distribution has to be used with cautions for long - range interacting systems , the statistical tendency of vortices of the same circulation sign to cluster in the negative temperature regime can be justified using the canonical distribution @xmath150 . changing the sign of the inverse temperatures",
    "@xmath96 would be equivalent to reversing the sign of the interaction between vortices , making them repel ( resp . attract ) if they are of opposite ( resp .",

    "after a long period in which onsager s statistical theory was not further explored , this domain of research has made an impressive progress recently .",
    "one might in particular cite the work of joyce and montgomery  @xcite , who have considered a system of vortices with total zero circulation . maximizing the entropy at fixed energy",
    ", they obtain an equation for the stream function which gives exact stable stationary solutions of the 2d euler equations , able to describe the macroscopic vortex formation proposed by onsager for negative temperatures .",
    "later , lundgren and pointin  @xcite studied the effect of far vorticity field on the motion of a single vortex , showing that it produces a positive eddy viscosity term leading to an increase of cluster size .",

    "the canonical ensemble can also be defined for both the euler equation in @xmath151 and the onsager point vortex model .",
    "it turns out that in both cases , canonical and microcanical ensembles may be inequivalent @xcite . in particular for the euler equation in the region of negative temperature ( where vorticity tends to accumulate at the center of the domain ) some hybrid states are shown to be realized in the microcanonical ensemble but not in the canonical @xcite .",
    "as far as the point vortex model is concerned , microcanonical stable states , that are unstable in the canonical ensemble , are found for specific geometries @xcite . in both cases ,",
    "microcanonical specific heat is negative .",
    "reviews on 2d turbulence can be found in refs  @xcite .",
    "another related interesting case of ensemble inequivalence has been recently reported in the context of physical oceanography @xcite .",
    "let us discuss the planar stress and displacement fields around the tip of a slit - like plane crack in an ideal hookean continuum solid .",
    "the classical approach to a linear elasticity problem of this sort involves the search for a suitable `` stress function '' that satisfies the so - called biharmonic equation @xmath152 where @xmath153 is the airy stress function , which has to satisfy appropriate boundary conditions .",
    "the deformation energy density is then defined as @xmath154 where @xmath155 is the fracture stress field around the tip , whereas @xmath156 is the deformation field . considering a crack - width @xmath157 and using the exact muskhelishvili s solution  @xcite , one obtains the elastic potential energy due to the crack @xmath158 where @xmath25 is the young modulus , @xmath159 the stress field at infinity , @xmath160 the poisson coefficient and @xmath4 the distance to the tip .",
    "the elasticity equation in the bulk of two - dimensional materials leads therefore to a marginal case of long - range interaction , since @xmath161 in @xmath46 .",
    "looking at the important engineering applications , the dynamics of this non conservative system should be better studied : the difficulty lies again in the long - range nature of the interaction .",
    "in addition , in such a two dimensional material , the presence of several fractures could exhibit a very interesting new type of screening effects .",
    "the partition function of system of charges is basically the same as the one for gravitational systems displayed in formula ( [ cutoffgravit ] ) with the potential given by @xmath162 where @xmath163 is the charge of the particle and @xmath49 is given by formula ( [ unsurer ] ) .",
    "if the total charge is non zero , the excess charge is expelled to the boundary of the domain and the bulk is neutral .",
    "hence , neglecting boundary contributions ( which are non extensive ) , one usually considers an infinite medium with total zero charge @xcite .",
    "similarly to the gravitational case , the partition function would diverge if not properly regularized at short distances .",
    "this is usually done by supposing that additional forces are present at short distances , either hard core of radius @xmath62 or smoothed coulombic singularities of the type @xmath164 the regularized partition function allows one to perform the thermodynamic limit and derive physical quantities , like the pressure .",
    "as far as the large distance behavior is concerned , several rigorous results exist @xcite that prove , under appropriate hypotheses ( low density and high temperature ) , that the effective two - body potential is debye - hckel screened @xmath165 where @xmath166 is the debye length , with @xmath167 the density . among the hypotheses ,",
    "the most important one for its possible physical consequences is the one of low density or high temperature .",
    "this suggests that all pathologies related to ensemble inequivalence ( e.g. negative specific heat ) , that is a consequence of the long - range nature of the interaction , will be indeed absent for charged systems .",
    "an interesting different situation is the one of plasmas consisting exclusively of single charged particles ( pure electron or pure ion plasmas ) @xcite .",
    "charged particles are confined by external electric and magnetic fields .",
    "the thermodynamics of such systems is not affected by short - distance effects because particles repel each other . on the contrary , the behavior at large distances is different from the one of globally neutral low density plasmas .",
    "nevertheless , by studying the correlation at equilibrium , a debye length emerges  @xcite ( this behavior is also present in self - gravitating systems ) .",
    "experimentally , relaxation to thermal equilibrium has been observed only in some specific conditions .",
    "the system has been shown to relax into quasi - stationary states , including minimum enstrophy states ( see eq .",
    "( [ enstrophy ] ) ) and vortex crystal states @xcite .",
    "indeed , in the particular case of a pure electron plasma in a cylindrical container with a strong magnetic field applied along the axis of the cylinder , it can be shown that the electron motion in the plane perpendicular to the magnetic field obeys equations that are the same as the onsager point vortex model ( [ kirchoffa ] ) and ( [ kirchoffb ] ) .",
    "therefore , all what has been written above about two - dimensional hydrodynamics applies to this system , including the existence of negative specific heat which has been explicitly demonstrated in a magnetically self - confined plasma torus  @xcite",
    ".      systems of electric and magnetic dipoles share many similarities , but also have important differences ( force in non uniform external fields , the symmetry axial / polar of the dipolar vector ) .",
    "however , for what concerns statistical mechanics , the two systems are equivalent .",

    "dipolar interaction energy is strongly anisotropic : on a lattice , magnetic moments parallel to a bond interact ferromagnetically , while when they are perpendicular to the bond they interact antiferromagnetically . when magnetic moments are placed on a triangular or a square lattice",
    "the interaction is _",
    "frustrated_. dipolar forces are long - range only in @xmath48 , because the energy per spin scales as @xmath172 .",
    "they are therefore _ marginally _ long - range in @xmath48 , while they are short - range in @xmath173 .",
    "it should be remarked that elasticity is instead marginally long - range in @xmath46 .",
    "it can be shown in general that , for samples of ellipsoidal shape and when the magnetization @xmath174 lies along the longest principal axis of the ellipsoid , the energy per volume of a system of dipoles on a lattice can be written as @xmath175 where @xmath176 is an energy that depends on the crystal structure , and @xmath125 is the so called demagnetizing factor , which is equal to @xmath177 for spherically shaped samples , tends to @xmath178 for needle shape samples and to @xmath179 for disk shaped ones . the well - known _ shape dependence _ of dipolar energy is hence accounted for by the highly frustrating antiferromagnetic demagnetizing term in formula ( [ finaldipolarformula ] ) @xcite .",
    "we will see examples of energies of the form ( [ finaldipolarformula ] ) in subsection  [ splusl ] , while in subsection [ ramaz ] , we will work out in detail a specific example corresponding to a realistic system .    using methods similar to those introduced to prove the existence of a thermodynamic limit for short - range forces @xcite , it can be shown @xcite that a system of dipolar spins posses a well defined bulk free energy , independent of sample shape , only in the case of zero applied field .",
    "the key to the existence of this thermodynamic limit is the reduction in demagnetization energy when uniformly magnetized regions break into ferromagnetically ordered domains @xcite . technically ,",
    "the proof is performed by showing that under the hypothesis of zero field the free energy is additive , using invariance under time reversal of the dipole energy , which is a consequence of its bilinearity in @xmath169 .    in the future",

    "the possibility to perform experiments with single domain needle shaped dipolar materials has been also stressed @xcite .",
    "as we have seen , the presence of long - range interactions causes the lack of additivity in macroscopic systems .",
    "however , even if the interactions are short - range , systems of a linear size comparable to the range of the interaction are nonadditive .",

    "a thorough proof of this result can be found in the book by ruelle @xcite .",
    "let us first discuss the physical meaning of ensemble equivalence in order to clarify why for long - range interacting systems equivalence does not always hold .",
    "the three main statistical ensembles are associated to the following different physical situations :    * a completely isolated system at a given energy @xmath25 : _ microcanonical _ ensemble ; * a system that can exchange energy with a large thermal reservoir characterized by the temperature @xmath28 : _ canonical _ ensemble ; * a system that can exchange energy and particles with a reservoir characterized by the temperature @xmath28 and the chemical potential @xmath190 : _ grand canonical _ ensemble .",
    "equivalence of the ensembles relies upon two important physical properties :    * in the thermodynamic limit , excluding critical points , the relative fluctuations of the thermodynamic parameters that are not held fixed ( e.g. energy in the canonical ensemble ) vanish ; * a macroscopic physical state that is realizable in one ensemble can be realized also in another ( equivalence at the level of macrostates ) .",
    "let us concentrate our attention on the second item and let s refer to the equivalence between microcanonical and canonical ensemble : an isolated system with a given energy has an average temperature , i.e. , an average kinetic energy . if instead we put the system in contact with a thermal bath at that temperature , we have an average energy equal to the energy of the isolated system . therefore there is a one - to - one correspondence between energy values and temperature values .",
    "actually , in the presence of phase transitions , this statement has to be made more precise , as we will comment in subsection [ maxwellinshort ] .",
    "the practical consequence of ensemble equivalence is that , for computational purposes , one has the freedom to choose the ensemble where calculations are easier , and typically this is not the microcanonical ensemble ( it is easier to integrate boltzmann factors than @xmath39-functions ) .",
    "thus , in spite of its fundamental importance in the construction of statistical mechanics , the microcanonical ensemble is practically never used to perform analytical calculations . on the contrary",
    "it is very much used in numerical simulations , since it constitutes the fundamental ingredient of molecular dynamics @xcite .",
    "ensemble equivalence is mathematically based on certain properties of the partition functions . to illustrate this point",
    ", we again consider the microcanonical and canonical ensembles , referring the reader to ruelle @xcite for a complete and rigorous discussion . a more precise definition of the microcanonical partition function ( see formula ( [ mic ] ) ) of a system in @xmath48 with @xmath3 particles confined in a volume @xmath49 is given by @xmath191 where the domain of integration is the accessible phase space @xmath192 .    for lattice systems the definition of @xmath193 is slightly different",

    "we are interested to study the behavior of the system subjected to small perturbations , so that it can still be considered to be initially close to a microcanonical system .",

    "in fact , if it gets a small amount of energy from the bath , its temperature lowers ( negative specific heat ! ) , and therefore further energy will flow from the bath to the system , inducing a lowering of the system s temperature and then creating an instability . if , on the contrary , the initial energy fluctuation decreases the system s energy , its temperature rises , inducing a further energy flow towards the bath , and , hence , an increase of system s temperature .",
    "thus , in contact with a heat bath , the system does not maintain energies in which its microcanonical specific heat is negative .",
    "the flow of energy started by the initial energy fluctuations stops when the system reaches again the same temperature of the bath , but at an energy for which its specific heat is positive .",

    "one of the key issues we would like to address is the possible links between the breakdown of connectivity , and thus ergodicity breaking , on the one hand , and the phase transition , on the other hand .",
    "obvious general properties do exist : a region of parameters where the space is disconnected corresponds to a region where metastable states do exist .",
    "let us justify this statement .",
    "at the boundary of any connected domain , when the order parameter is close to its boundary value @xmath754 , there is a single accessible state . in a model with continuous variables , like the one we discuss here",

    ", entropy extrema can not be located at the boundary .",
    "thus , a local entropy maximum ( metastable or stable ) does exist in a region of parameters where the space is disconnected .",
    "hence , there is an entropy maximum ( either local or global ) in any connected domain of the space .",
    "for instance , considering the present model , in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase_diagram ] , the area _ r3 _ is included in the area where metastable states exist ( bounded by the two dotted lines and the dashed line ) . in such areas where metastable states exist , one generically expects first order phase transitions .",
    "thus the breakdown of phase space connectivity is generically associated to first order phase transition , as exemplified by the present study . however",
    ", this is not necessary , one may observe metastable states without first order phase transitions , or first order phase transitions without connectivity breaking .",
    "a very interesting question is related to the critical points @xmath139 and @xmath758 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase_diagram ] .",
    "as observed in the phase diagram , the end point for the line of first order phase transition ( point @xmath758 ) corresponds also to a point where the boundary of the region where the space is disconnected is not smooth .",
    "similarly , the end point for the line of appearance of metastable states ( point @xmath139 ) is also a singular point for the boundary of the area where the space is disconnected .",
    "it is thus possible to propose the conjecture that such a relation is generic , and that it should be observed in other systems where both first order phase transitions and phase space ergodicity breaking do occur .",

    ", we consider a stable @xmath475 state which is disconnected from the metastable one .",
    "this makes the system unable to switch from one state to the other .",
    "note that this feature is characteristic of the microcanonical dynamics , since an algorithm reproducing canonical dynamics would allow the crossing of the forbidden region ( by moving to higher energy states , which is impossible in the microcanonical ensemble ) .",

    "from the mathematical point of view , one is faced to interesting and difficult problems for what concerns both equilibrium statistical mechanics and out - of - equilibrium dynamics",
    ". it would be important to develop large deviation methods in order to allow the treatment of systems with slowly decaying interactions as was done for instance for the @xmath6-ising model  @xcite and of systems with both short and long - range interactions . for what concerns the dynamical properties ,",
    "several significant advances have been recently obtained in kinetic theory concerning the study of the solutions of vlasov - poisson and vlasov - maxwell systems .",
    "both the difficulties of incorporating in the theory the singularity of the coulomb or gravitational potential and the enlargement of the treatable initial conditions have been addressed ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "when going to systems where the interaction is long - range , but not mean - field , the difficulty of performing numerical simulations is related to the fact that algorithms are intrinsically of order @xmath30 for each time step , where @xmath3 is the number of particles . because of this , for gravitational systems ,",
    "dedicated computers have been built ( e.g. grape in japan @xcite ) and sophisticated numerical codes have been developed  @xcite .",
    "the issue of devising better algorithms is central for the improvements of the simulations and has not yet been seriously faced .",
    "we have contributed with this review to convey the idea that many of the effects that were previously attributed to gravitational systems appear also in other systems , as was early stressed in two - dimensional hydrodynamics  @xcite .",

    "as we know from the analysis of such states in the hmf model , they show phase transitions from homogeneous to inhomogeneous macroscopic distributions ( see sec .",
    "[ lyndenbellentropy ] ) .",
    "such transitions , together with the characterization of quasi - stationary states , could be the object of an experimental study with linear fels  @xcite .",
    "cold atomic systems offer a promising laboratory for testing the predictions of the statistical mechanics of systems with long - range interactions .",
    "these systems range from ionized atoms confined by an external potential which interact via unscreened coulomb repulsion , to neutral atoms that interact by means of van der waals type forces . additionally , dipolar gases have been recently the subject of extensive experimental studies  @xcite .",
    "initially , some attention had been paid to the possible realization of true gravitational - like classical interaction induced by external laser fields  @xcite . however , this hope has failed until now due to technical difficulties . when the wave - like behavior of matter can be neglected , leading to a semi ",
    "classical approximation , and laser light is far from resonance , a fully hamiltonian ( microcanonical ) treatment of bose - einstein condensates is viable .",
    "moreover , ensemble inequivalence for bosonic gases is reminiscent of the ensemble inequivalence encountered for long - range interacting systems  @xcite .",
    "however , it has been later realized that this type of ensemble inequivalence is of a different nature and should be analyzed in itself .",
    "a potentially fruitful seed has recently emerged in the study of cold atoms in optical high - q cavities . for these systems ,",
    "the interaction between two atoms is independent of the distance , because they are coupled via the back - scattering of photons within the cavity .",
    "the interaction can lead to collective instabilities and self - organization phenomena , known as carl  @xcite .",
    "models of the carl phenomenon have strong similarities with those of fel .",
    "therefore , we expect that the study of phase transitions and of quasi - stationary states could be realized also for these laboratory systems .",
    "we finally argue that dipolar condensed matter systems should be seriously considered to check some features of long - range interactions .",
    "indeed , it has been remarked since long time that composites like @xmath1469 , where dipolar interactions dominate over heisenberg exchange interactions , have a mean - field critical behavior  @xcite .",
    "more recently , such results have been extended to diluted models which simulate the effect of disorder , making the sherrington - kirpatrick spin - glass behavior experimentally accessible  @xcite .",
    "the importance of long - range dipolar interactions has been also recognized for pyrochlore lattice structures , that show the strongly degenerate and frustrated `` spin ice '' phase  @xcite .    in the final section of this review , we have briefly mentioned experimental applications , because we think that theoretical results obtained in the study of systems with long - range interactions have nowadays reached a level of understanding that might allow , in the near future , the experimental verifications of curious effects like negative specific heat , ergodicity breaking , quasi - stationary states .",
