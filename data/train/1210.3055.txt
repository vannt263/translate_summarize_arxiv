    ", circumbinary planets have been discovered in seven eclipsing post - ce binaries .",
    "all those discoveries were made using the eclipse timing variation technique .",
    "the main features of these planets are summarized in table  [ tab : known ] , which also shows the results for nsvs14256825 presented in this paper .",
    "nsvs14256825 ( hereafter referred to as nsvs1425 ) is an eclipsing post - ce binary and consists of an sdob star plus a dm star with an orbital period of 0.110374days @xcite .",

    "the methodology used to obtain the eclipse times and the procedure to examine the orbital period variation are presented in section  [ analysis ] . in section  [ discussion ]",

    "the photometric data are summarized in table [ table:1 ] .",
    "the data reduction was performed using iraf tasks @xcite and consists of subtracting a master median bias image from each program image , and dividing the result by a normalized flat - field frame .",
    "differential photometry was used to obtain the flux ratio between the target and a field star of assumed constant flux .",
    "as the nsvs1425 field is not crowded , flux extraction was performed using aperture photometry .",
    "this procedure was repeated several times using different apertures and sky ring sizes to select the combination that provides the best signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "figure  [ light_curve ] shows three normalized light curves folded on the nsvs1425 orbital period .",
    "to obtain the mid - eclipse times for nsvs1425 , we generated model light curves using the wilson - devinney code ( wdc  @xcite ) and searched for the best fit to the observed data .",
    "we used mode 2 of the wdc , which is appropriate to detached systems .",

    "@xmath15-band limb darkening was used .",
    "the ranges of the geometrical and physical parameters ( e.g. , inclination , radii , temperatures and masses ) obtained by @xcite for nsvs1425 were adopted as the search intervals in the fit .    a method similar to that described in @xcite",

    "one possible explanation is the light travel time ( ltt ) effect , which is explored in this paper .",
    "the ltt effect shows up as a periodic variation in the observed eclipse times when the distance from the binary to the observer varies due to gravitational interaction between the inner binary and an external body @xcite . to fit the nsvs1425 eclipse times taking this effect into account , we used the following equation ,    @xmath32    where    @xmath33 \\label{ltt}\\ ] ]    is the ltt effect . in the last equation",

    "we revisited the orbital period variation of the post - ce binary nsvs1425 adding the 10 new mid - eclipse times obtained as described in previous sections .",
    "the complex orbital period variation , illustrated by the ( o@xmath1c ) diagram , can be mathematically described by the ltt effect of two circumbinary objects .",
    "the amplitudes of the ltt effects are @xmath43  s and @xmath44 .",
    "the associated orbital periods correspond to @xmath45 and @xmath46  years , respectively .",
    "this solution is a good description for the orbital period variation , as shown by fig .",
    "[ figo - c ] .",
    "but it raises some concerns , which are discussed below .",
    "the time baseline of nsvs1425 covers about 5.5  years .",
    "one of the two ltt effects has a period of @xmath47 years , larger than the baseline making the obtained solution less robust .",
    "moreover , the early points have large errorbars and hence constrain less the ltt effect . in this regard , it is useful to recall the case of hw  vir",
    ". it is a similar system , which also presents a complex ( o@xmath1c ) diagram .",
    "@xcite , based on a dataset spread over almost 20  years , proposed the presence of a brown dwarf around the central binary .",
    "a few years later , a solution considering two objects was presented by @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite claimed a still different solution , more stable dynamically .",
    "this illustrates how new data can change a ltt effect solution .",
    "therefore , the ltt solution derived for nsvs1425 should be considered as a preliminary one .",
    "we now discuss the implications of the presence of two circumbinary objects in nsvs1425 . using the close binary mass @xmath48 @xcite , the lower mass limit for the two circumbinary bodies are @xmath49 ( inner body ) and @xmath50 ( external body ) . assuming an orbital inclination of @xmath51 degrees @xcite and coplanarity between the two external bodies and the inner binary , nsvs1425c and nsvs1425d",
    "would both be giant planets with @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "considering nsvs1425 with two circumbinary planets , this system would be the eighth post - ce system with planets and the fourth system with two planets ( see table  [ tab : known ] ) .",
    "in such systems , there are two principal scenarios for planetary formation : ( i ) first generation planets formed in a circumbinary protoplanetary disk ; and ( ii ) second generation planets originated from a disk formed by the ejected envelope .    in the first scenario , could the two circumbinary planets in nsvs1425 survive the ce phase ?",
    "@xcite estimated the orbital separation between the progenitor of an extreme horizontal branch ( ehb ) star ( sdb or sdob ) and a planet before the ce phase by the equation , @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the mass of the sdob star , and @xmath54 is the present orbital separation of the planet . assuming that the progenitor of the sdob star in nsvs1425 had a mass of @xmath55 , and neglecting accretion by the companion , the orbital separation of the planets before the ce would be @xmath56 au and @xmath57 au .",
    "for a single star , @xcite pointed out that the maximum radius at the tip of the ehb ( @xmath58 ) is @xmath59 au .",
    "hence , the inner planet is on the verge of being engulfed by the ce .",
    "moreover , the tidal interaction causes a planet to spiral inwards if its orbital radius is smaller than @xmath60 @xcite . therefore the two circumbinary bodies in nsvs1425 would not survive the ce phase . on the other hand",
    ", @xcite showed that the ce size can be much reduced if the ehb star is part of a binary system , because once the secondary is engulfed by the envelope , the ce is totally ejected in only @xmath61 days , stopping the envelope expansion . therefore , the maximum radius of the ce is around the initial distance between the close binary components .",
    "thus , if the close binary separation in nsvs1425 before the ce phase was @xmath62 au , the two planets could survive the ce phase .",
    "for the second scenario , the principal question to investigate is : was there time enough after the ce phase to form giant planets ?",
    "@xcite showed that the typical time scale to form giant planets in protostellar disks is @xmath63 years .",
    "the lifetime of a binary in the ehb phase is @xmath64 years @xcite . as the nsvs1425 primary star is in the post - ehb phase @xcite",
    ", we conclude that there was time enough to form the two circumbinary planets after the ce phase .",
    "therefore the second generation of planets is also a viable scenario for nsvs1425 .",
    "finally , among all known candidates to be circumbinary planets in post - ce systems , the inner planet in nsvs1425 has the minimum binary - planet separation , @xmath65au .",
