    "graphene , a single - atom layer of carbon atoms arranged in a honeycomb lattice , has attracted enormous attention recently .",
    "it exhibits remarkable mechanic and thermal properties @xcite , but the most studied aspect are its startling electronic properties .",
    "graphene can carry high current densities , its resistivity is less than that of silver @xcite ( the lowest resistivy material at room temperature ) , and when exposed to a magnetic field at sufficiently low temperatures it shows an anomalous quantum hall effect @xcite .",
    "many of these properties are attributed to graphene s peculiar band structure , quasi - free electrons in single - layer graphene propagating as massless dirac particles @xcite , which opens the possibility of probing relativistic quantum mechanics effects in condensed matter systems .",
    "for example , perfect tunneling of electron wave packets through potential barriers , the klein paradox , unobservable in particle physics , has been experimentally confirmed in graphene very recently @xcite .",
    "additionally , interference between positive and negative frequency components of wave packets superposition of both positive and negative energy eigenstates induces a highly oscillatory motion , known as zitterbewegung ( zb ) , that appears as damped , rapid oscillations of free dirac particles around their otherwise rectilinear average trajectories .",
    "zb has been the subject of intense analytical investigations , although direct observations remain elusive due to the enormous characteristic frequency and the small amplitude of this motion .",
    "however , zb may influence quantities other than the average position of free dirac particles @xcite , e.g. the nontrivial behavior of the conductivity in graphene @xcite , and it has been argued that graphene in a magnetic field is a promising system for the experimental observation of zb @xcite .    in this paper we describe how , depending on the electron wave packet s initial conditions , electric current regeneration occurs in graphene under an external magnetic field , due to revivals and fractional revivals of the wave function .",
    "in particular , it is shown that when the electrons are prepared in the form of wave packets assuming a gaussian population of only positive ( or negative ) energy landau levels , the presence of the magnetic field induce revivals of the electron currents , besides the classical cyclotron motion .",
    "when the population comprises both positive and negative energy landau levels , revivals of the electric current manifest simultaneously with zb and the classical cyclotron motion .",
    "electric currents due to zb of electrons in graphene have already been described @xcite , but the occurrence of revivals , a phenomenon purely quantum mechanical in origin , has not been reported yet despite that these oscillations are slow enough and large enough to be detected .",
    "next , we briefly review the phenomenon of wave packet revivals and then study how they show up in graphene .",
    "the time evolution of wave packets , relativistic and nonrelativistic , can be quite complex due to quantum interference .",
    "however , several types of periodicity may emerge depending on the character of the energy eigenvalue spectrum .",
    "if the initial wave packet is a superposition of eigenstates @xmath0 sharply peaked around some large central @xmath1 , different time scales can then be identified from the coefficients of the taylor expansion of the energy spectrum @xmath2 around the energy @xmath3 @xcite , @xmath4 for instance , propagating wave packets initially evolve quasiclassically and oscillate with period @xmath5 , which is in accordance with the correspondence principle .",
    "wave packets then spread and collapse , and the classical oscillations eventually damp out . at later times , multiples of the revival time @xmath6 , collapsed wave packets ( almost ) regain their initial waveform and oscillate again with period @xmath7 .",
    "moreover , at times that are rational fractions of @xmath8 , wave packets split into a collection of scaled and reshifted copies called fractional revivals .",
    "longer time scales can be defined beyond @xmath8 , v.g .",
    "the so - called superrevival time , at which a new cycle of full and fractional revivals commences again .",
    "lastly , the term @xmath3 in the expansion eq .",
    "( [ expansion ] ) above just generates an unobservable overall phase ( see , however , below ) .",
    "revival phenomena have attracted considerable interest over the past decades . in particular , revivals and fractional revivals",
    "have been investigated theoretically in nonlinear quantum systems , atoms and molecules @xcite , and observed experimentally in , among others , rydberg wave packets in atoms and molecules , molecular vibrational states , and bose - einstein condensates @xcite .",
    "interestingly , methods for isotope separation @xcite , wave packet control @xcite , as well as for number factorization @xcite have been put forward that are based on revival phenomena .",
    "to study wave packet revivals in graphene , we consider the hamiltonian for electrons in graphene under a magnetic field perpendicular to the plane and of intensity @xmath9 . following standard methods @xcite , within the tight binding approximation and near the vicinity of the @xmath10 point , one of the two inequivalent corners of the brillouin zone , the hamiltonian reads ( we use units such that @xmath11 ) @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the quasiparticle momentum , @xmath14 is the vector potential and @xmath15 the electron charge .",
    "the electronic dispersion relation is given by @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the momentum measured relatively to the @xmath10 point and @xmath18 m / s is the fermi velocity ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "upon introducing the magnetic radius @xmath19 and using the landau gauge @xmath20 , it is not difficult to show that the energy eigenfunctions are given by @xmath21 with @xmath22 for the conduction and valence bands , respectively , and @xmath23 .",
    "here , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 are the hermite polynomials .",
    "the energy spectrum is , in turn , @xmath28 , with @xmath29 .",
    "we shall construct the initial wave packets as the linear combination @xmath30 two different situations will be considered .",
    "first , wave packets with @xmath31 , centered around given @xmath32 and @xmath1 with coefficients @xmath33 and @xmath34 gaussianly distributed as @xmath35 the classical period and the revival time yield straightforwardly @xmath36 and @xmath37 , respectively . in this case",
    ", zb is not possible because the wave packets contain positive energy states only .",
    "secondly , we shall consider a superposition state of two wave packets with opposite @xmath38 and centered around the same @xmath32 and @xmath1 as before , with coefficients @xmath39 gaussianly distributed as given by ( [ gaussian_cn ] ) . in this second case ,",
    "simultaneously with the classical periodicity and revivals , zb shows up with a period @xmath40 that is obtained from the first term in the expansion eq .",

    "an alternative approach based on information entropies has been recently proposed @xcite . after defining @xmath47",
    "one readily finds @xmath48 the occurrence of revivals corresponds to the return of @xmath49 to its initial value of unity , and the fractional revivals to the appearance of relative maxima in @xmath49 .",

    "the vertical dotted lines stand for ( a ) zb of electrons with @xmath81 fs , ( b ) classical motion , and ( c ) revival behavior .",
    ", width=302 ]    we now turn to examine to what extent the above predictions hold for real graphene samples .",
    "it is well known that , in addition to the @xmath10 point , there is a second inequivalent point in the brillouin zone , @xmath82 , where the valence and conduction bands meet .",
    "the hamiltonian for electrons at the @xmath82 point is given by @xcite @xmath83 and hence @xmath84 .",
    "the eigenvalues are the same than those of @xmath85 but the eigenfunctions are different , @xmath86 and the quantum velocity is given by @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "electrons around the @xmath10 and @xmath82 points are excited to levels associated with @xmath89 and @xmath90 , respectively .",
    "therefore , the total electric current is the sum of two contributions coming from two different wave packets : @xmath91 as given by eq .",
    "( [ wp1 ] ) and @xmath92 obtained after replacing @xmath93 by @xmath94 in eq .",
    "( [ wp1 ] ) , the coefficients @xmath95 being common to both wave packets ( see @xcite ) because the energy spectra of both hamiltonians are identical .",
    "the contribution to the electric current from these two wave packets is equal @xcite .     and @xmath41 t. rest of parameters as in fig .",
    "2 . for @xmath96",
    "the revival behavior is still observable ( panel ( a ) ) . for @xmath97 most of the revivals",
    "are missed ( panel ( b ) ) , but revival behavior can still be appreciated in a logarithmic scale ( panel ( c ) ) . ,",
    "width=302 ]    another feature of real graphene that might have an impact on revival phenomena is the existence of a small gap , of the order of @xmath98 mev , caused by impurities @xcite , @xmath99 interactions , etc .",
    "@xcite . however , the periods @xmath7 and @xmath8 will be the same than those calculated in the gapless model due to the fact that they are derivatives of the energies , and only the @xmath100 period will change quantitatively with a new interband frequency @xmath101 @xcite .",
    "a second consequence of the imperfections in graphene is the broadening of the landau levels , which may strongly influence the revivals of the electric current calculated using idealized , delta - like landau levels .",
    "assuming finite widths for all energy levels , characterized by broadening parameters @xmath102 , the landau levels @xmath2 are replaced by complex energies @xmath103 @xcite .",

    "the influence of the broadening of the landau level on the revivals of the electron current is illustrated in fig . [ broadening ] .",
    "for @xmath96 the revivals are still observable ( panel ( a ) ) , but for @xmath97 most of them damp out due to the exponential factor in eq .",
    "( [ gammaonj ] ) ( panel ( b ) ) .",
    "the early time surviving revivals with @xmath97 are visible when the current is plotted in a logarithmic scale ( panel ( c ) ) .",
    "therefore , the occurrance of revivals of the electron current depends critically on the broadening of the landau levels .",
    "in conclusion , we have studied the dynamics of electron currents in graphene subject to a magnetic field .",
    "several types of periodicity must be distinguished if the wave packets representing the electrons are sufficiently localized around some large enough central quantum number @xmath1 . in this case , currents initially evolve quasiclassically and oscillate with a period @xmath7 , but at later times the wave packet eventually spreads , leading to the collapse of the classical oscillations . at times that are multiple of @xmath8 , or rational fractions of @xmath8",
    ", the wave packet ( almost ) regains its initial form , and the electron current its initial amplitude . for this to occur ,",
    "the presence of a quantizing magnetic field is necessary , for if @xmath109 the spectrum is continuous which rules out the possibility of revivals @xcite .",
    "associated with the revival of the wave packet the quasiclassical oscillatory motion of the currents resumes .",
    "additionally , when both positive and negative landau levels are populated , permanent zb oscillations are observed , in agreement with previous results @xcite .",
    "like @xmath7 and @xmath8 , @xmath110 can be simply obtained from the expansion eq .",
    "( [ expansion ] ) , thus providing a unifying description of three main time scales for the study of electric currents in graphene .",
    "interestingly , although all the several periods depend on @xmath9 as @xmath111 , their ratios @xmath112 only depend on @xmath1 . moreover , since @xmath113 current revivals are more accessible to experimental probing .",
    "in particular , for the values used in this work @xmath114 .",
    "interestingly , the analogy of hamiltonian ( [ hamiltoniano ] ) with the jaynes - cummings model allows us to relate zb and rabi oscillations , as other authors have pointed out @xcite .",
    "all these results carry over without change when a more refined modeling of graphene is used that accounts for the @xmath82 point of the brillouin zone and the energy gap caused by inevitable imperfections and interactions .",
    "however , the broadening of the landau levels destroys most of the revivals in the case of @xmath41 t , for broadening parameters @xmath115 mev .",
    "since current experimental estimates of the line width are of the order of 5 mev for @xmath41 t , the observation of revivals of the electric current in graphene would require either stronger magnetic fields , which lead to lower @xmath8 and line width @xcite , or the use of high quality graphene samples .",
