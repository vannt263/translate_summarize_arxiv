    "this suggest that these systems are relatively close to a metal - insulator transition .",
    "a metal - insulator transition is usually discussed in terms of the ratio between the coulomb interaction @xmath1 between two electrons on the same molecule and the one - particle band width @xmath11 . for a@xmath9c@xmath6 and a@xmath10c@xmath6",
    "this ratio is , however , almost identical@xcite .",
    "it is then interesting to ask which factors determine whether a system is on the metallic or insulating side .",
    "these systems have been studied in a hubbard - like model , and it was found that the three - fold degeneracy of the @xmath8 orbital plays an important role by increasing the ratio @xmath12 where the metal - insulator transition takes place@xcite .",
    "it was furthermore found that the lattice structure is important for the difference between a@xmath9c@xmath6 ( fcc ) and a@xmath10c@xmath6 ( bct)@xcite .",
    "hubbard - like models predict , however , that a@xmath10c@xmath6 is an anti - ferromagnetic insulator , while it is known experimentally that there are no moments in a@xmath10c@xmath6@xcite .",

    "the interaction with the jahn - teller phonons favor a low spin state and might lead to a nonmagnetic insulator@xcite . at the same time there is , however , a hund s rule coupling , which favors a high spin state .",
    "this leads to an interesting competition between the jahn - teller effect and the hund s rule coupling .",
    "the purpose of this paper is therefore to study the influence of the jahn - teller effect and the hund s rule coupling on the metal - insulator transition .",
    "we do this in the context of the fullerenes , but similar effects also occur in many other systems , e.g. , transition metal compounds@xcite .    in this paper we study a model of a@xmath5c@xmath6 which includes the electron - phonon coupling and the electron - electron interaction . in a@xmath5c@xmath6",

    "we first study an isolated molecule .",
    "we consider the case of the coupling to an a@xmath0 phonon and two cases of coupling to jahn - teller phonons , namely the @xmath13 case , where a two - fold degenerate level couples to a two - fold degenerate phonon , and the @xmath14 case , where a three - fold degenerate level couples to a five - fold degenerate phonon .",
    "the @xmath13 case is the simplest model with a jahn - teller effect , and the @xmath14 case is a simple model of a c@xmath6 molecule .",
    "thus we consider the hamiltonian    @xmath15    where the first term describes the electronic level , the second the phonon and the third the electron - phonon coupling .",
    "the coupling matrices @xmath16 are determined by symmetry and they are given in , e.g. , ref . . for the coupling to an a@xmath0 phonon @xmath17",
    "is diagonal with all the diagonal elements equal to unity , @xmath18 . for the @xmath13 case @xmath19 and for the @xmath14 case @xmath20    the overall coupling strength",
    "is determined by @xmath21 . in",
    "a metallic molecular solid with narrow bands , there is a simple relation between @xmath21 and the dimensionless coupling @xmath22@xcite @xmath23 for the @xmath14 case and @xmath24 for the @xmath13 case . here",
    "@xmath25 is the electron density of states per spin .",
    "we also define a jahn - teller energy @xmath26    in addition we include the coulomb interaction @xmath27 where @xmath28 is an occupation number , @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the coulomb interactions between equal and unequal orbitals , respectively and @xmath2 is an exchange integral .",
    "the coulomb integrals are related via @xmath31    for a@xmath0 phonons and a free molecule , the electron - phonon problem is reduced to a displaced oscillator , and we can easily obtain the electron - phonon contribution to the ground - state energy @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the energy of a free molecule with @xmath34 electrons .",
    "the jahn - teller case is more complicated and can not be solved exactly .",
    "we therefore focus on the lowest order contribution to @xmath33 . for the coulomb interaction",
    "this contribution is of first order in @xmath2 and for the electron - phonon interaction it is of second order in @xmath21 .",
    "the results are shown in table [ table1 ] for the @xmath13 case and in table [ table2 ] for the @xmath14 case .",
    "we have subtracted an average coulomb energy , @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the average interaction for the ground - state in a full shell with @xmath37 electrons and the orbital degeneracy @xmath38 . by definition ,",
    "@xmath39 is then zero for a full shell .",
    "results for the low spin state ( singlet or doublet ) and the high spin state ( triplet or quartet ) are shown in table [ table1 ] .    neglecting the coulomb interaction ( @xmath1 and @xmath2 ) the results for the @xmath14 case",
    "can be written as@xcite @xmath40 where @xmath41 this is a weak - coupling result for the case when @xmath22 ( or @xmath21 ) is small .",
    "for the strong - coupling case@xcite @xmath42 in the strong - coupling case the prefactor in front of @xmath43 has been reduced by a factor of @xmath44 .    from tables",
    "[ table1 ] and [ table2 ] it follows that the low spin state is lower in energy for @xmath45 in the @xmath13 case and for @xmath46 in the @xmath14 case .",
    "the results illustrate the competition between the jahn - teller effect and the hund s rule coupling . according to hund",
    "s first rule , it is favorable to form a high spin state to minimize the coulomb energy . on the other hand",
    ", the jahn - teller effect favors a low spin state .",
    "for instance , if the first phonon ( @xmath47 ) of @xmath48 symmetry ( the left matrix in eq .",
    "( [ eq:2 ] ) ) is excited , it is favorable to put two electrons ( with opposite spins ) in the level @xmath49 , resulting in a singlet .",
    "the tables show that in the low spin state the energy @xmath39 is lowered by the electron - phonon coupling but is increased by the exchange integral @xmath2 . in the high spin state , on the other hand",
    ", the exchange coupling lowers the energy , while the electron - phonon interaction lowers the energy less than in the low spin state or not at all .",
    "this can be further illustrated by considering the case of two electrons in the @xmath13 system .",
    "for @xmath45 , the important states are @xmath50 these states couple directly via the exchange interaction and indirectly via the electron - phonon interaction .",
    "thus we also include states where one phonon has been excited . in the corresponding hamiltonian matrix the part corresponding to the states with one phonon",
    "are `` folded '' into the part corresponding to @xmath51 , @xmath52 or 2 , and we obtain the matrix @xmath53 if @xmath45 the corresponding energy is @xmath54 which clearly shows the competition between the jahn - teller coupling and the hund s rule coupling . for @xmath55 a triplet state of the type @xmath56 with the energy @xmath57 becomes the lowest state .",
    "it is now important to establish the parameter range appropriate for a@xmath5c@xmath6 . in particular , the relative size of @xmath21 and",
    "@xmath2 is important , since this determines whether the jahn - teller effect or the hund s rule coupling wins . the exchange integral @xmath2 has been estimated@xcite from an _ ab initio _ scf calculation@xcite . from the calculated multiplet",
    "splitting the result @xmath58 ev was obtained .",
    "correlation effects are expected to reduce this number , since correlation effects in particular lower the energies of the low spin states .",
    "the difference in coulomb energy between the low spin states and the high spin states is then reduced and the effective @xmath2 becomes correspondingly smaller .",
    "for instance , for some atomic multiplets , correlation effects were found to reduce the multiplet splitting by about 25 @xmath59@xcite .",
    "the electron - phonon coupling constants have been estimated from photoemission experiments for a free molecule@xcite . here",
    "we replace the eight h@xmath0 modes by one effective mode .",
    "the frequency of this mode is chosen as the logarithmically averaged frequency @xmath60 where @xmath61 and @xmath62 are the electron - phonon couplings and frequencies , respectively .",
    "we have calculated the energies of the lowest singlet and triplet states for a free c@xmath6 molecule .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : splitting ] .",
    "experimentally it is found that the low spin state wins for both a@xmath9c@xmath6 and a@xmath10c@xmath6 , a@xmath10c@xmath6 being a nonmagnetic insulator@xcite and nh@xmath9k@xmath9c@xmath6 being antiferromagnetic with a moment ( 0.7 @xmath63 per molecule)@xcite which corresponds to a spin 1/2 system .",
    "for a@xmath10c@xmath6 the triplet - singlet splitting is estimated to be 0.1 ev@xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig : splitting ] this splitting is obtained for @xmath64 ev . as expected this value is smaller than the value @xmath58 ev deduced from the hf calculation .",
    "we observe that a change in the estimate of @xmath21 of course would also lead to a change in this empirical number of @xmath2 .",
    "since , however , the present estimate of @xmath2 seems reasonable relative the the hf value , this calculation also gives some support for the value of @xmath21 deduced from pes .",
    "in this section we study a two - site model to gain understanding of a ) the different influences of an a@xmath0 and a jahn - teller phonon on the metal - insulator transition and b ) the competition between the jahn - teller effect and the hund s rule coupling .",
    "we therefore compare the case of an a@xmath0 phonon coupling to a two - fold degenerate level ( @xmath65 problem ) with the jahn - teller @xmath13 problem .",
    "thus we study the model @xmath66 where @xmath67 ( eq . ( [ eq:1 ] ) ) describes the electron - phonon interaction on site @xmath68 , @xmath69 ( eq .",
    "( [ eq:7 ] ) ) describes the coulomb interaction on site @xmath68 , and @xmath70 describes the hopping between the two sites .",
    "we have assumed that there is only hopping between equal @xmath71-quantum numbers .",
    "the band gap @xmath72 for the filling @xmath73 is given by @xmath74 for a two - site model , where @xmath33 is the ground - state energy of a system with @xmath34 electrons .",
    "it is useful to consider @xmath75 in the limit when @xmath1 is very large , and then to extrapolate to intermediate values of @xmath1 .",
    "the limit of a large @xmath1 is particular transparent , allowing for simple calculations and a qualitative understanding , but it is still relevant for the intermediate values of @xmath1 where the metal - insulator transition takes place@xcite .",
    "the the metal - insulator transition happens when @xmath76 , i.e. , we find the critical value of @xmath1 for which this condition is satisfied .",
    "the two - site system is much too small for obtaining reliable quantitative estimates of the critical @xmath1 and the extrapolation of the large @xmath1 results is questionable .",
    "nevertheless , this approach can give a qualitative understanding of more realistic calculations@xcite .",
    "we consider the limit @xmath77 where the electron - phonon coupling and the exchange integral are just weak perturbations to the hopping and to the coulomb interaction .",
    "we first study the case of an a@xmath0 phonon and calculate the gap for the filling @xmath78 .",
    "it is then convenient to transform the coupling term to the form @xmath79 where @xmath80 and we have neglected an irrelevant term @xmath81 . for a system with two electrons and in the limit of a large @xmath1 , hopping is almost completely suppressed , and each site has almost exactly one electron .",
    "the term ( [ eq : a5 ] ) then has essentially zero coupling to this state , and we obtain @xmath82 since there is only one electron per site , there are no multiplet effects . to obtain the energy of a system with one electron",
    ", it is convenient to transform to bonding and antibonding operators , e.g. , @xmath83 .",
    "this gives the interaction term @xmath84 the bonding level is then occupied by one electron , giving the kinetic energy @xmath85 . the leading contribution to the energy due to the electron - phonon interaction",
    "is @xmath86 , giving @xmath87 in the limit studied here ( @xmath88 ) , the phonons react to the average electronic charge , which gives rise to the factor @xmath89 .",
    "we next consider the system with three electrons .",
    "the wave function for @xmath90 and @xmath91 is @xmath92 the corresponding energy is @xmath93 . for a general lattice and for a state",
    "which is half - filled apart from one electron or one hole , we expect the hopping to be enhanced by roughly a factor @xmath94 , where @xmath95 is the orbital degeneracy@xcite .",
    "however , for the two - site system this enhancement is @xmath95@xcite .",
    "the effects of the electron - phonon coupling are now included in perturbation theory . for the parameter range considered here ( @xmath88 ) , there is only coupling to the states @xmath96 . furthermore , the coulomb energy is given by @xmath97 , since there are no states with the kinetic energy -@xmath98 which couple to @xmath99 via @xmath100 .",
    "the energy is therefore @xmath101 the corresponding band gap is given in table [ table3 ] ( @xmath65 ) , which also shows the result for the filling @xmath102 .",
    "the table shows that the band gap is reduced by the electron - phonon coupling . extrapolating to intermediate values of @xmath1",
    "then suggests that the electron - phonon coupling increases the critical value of @xmath1 where the metal - insulator transition takes place .",
    "the reason is that the electron - phonon interaction in the model ( [ eq : a5 ] ) is not effective for integer filling in the large @xmath1 case , since the charge fluctuations are then suppressed . for the states with an extra electron or hole ,",
    "on the other hand , there is a fluctuating charge due to the hopping of the electron or hole and a corresponding lowering of the energy due to the electron - phonon coupling .",
    "the multiplet effects trivially reduce the gap for @xmath78 , since they are effective for the state with three electrons but not for the other two states . for @xmath102",
    ", however , they increase the gap .",
    "the reason is that in the integer occupation case ( @xmath103 ) , hopping plays no role for a large @xmath1 and the state can adjust to use the multiplet effects optimally .",
    "this is not possible for the case of an extra hole ( @xmath104 ) or an extra electron ( @xmath105 ) , since then the states first of all adjusts to optimize hopping , and only in the second place adjust to optimize the multiplet effects .",
    "the increase of the gap due to the exchange integral has been observed earlier@xcite .    we next consider the jahn - teller case of two - fold degenerate phonons .",
    "we first calculate the energy of the state with one electron per site in the large @xmath1 limit .",
    "perturbation theory shows that each phonon contributes an energy @xmath106 .",
    "since there are two phonons per site and two sites , the energy is @xmath107 where e@xmath0 labels the jahn - teller case .",
    "although charge fluctuations are completely suppressed in this case , the system can still gain energy by introducing a ( dynamical ) jahn - teller distortion .",
    "this is in strong contrast to the a@xmath0 phonons , which only couple to the net charge on a given site . in perturbation theory",
    ", the energies of the states with an extra electron or hole are @xmath108 the electron - phonon interaction lowers the energy twice as much as in the a@xmath0 case ( eqs .",
    "( [ eq : a8 ] ) and ( [ eq : a10 ] ) ) , simply because the phonon is two - fold degenerate and the coupling therefore is to twice as many phonons as in the a@xmath0 case .",
    "the corresponding gap is shown in table [ table3 ] , which also shows the gap for the filling @xmath102 .    for @xmath102 and @xmath109 the jahn - teller effect dominates over the hund s rule coupling .",
    "in this case as well as for @xmath78 the gap is then increased by the electron - phonon interaction , while in the a@xmath0 case it is decreased .",
    "the reason is similar as for the multiplet effects in the a@xmath0 case , discussed in the second paragraph below eq .",
    "( [ eq : a10 ] ) . for the parameter range ( eq .",
    "( [ eq : a4 ] ) ) we are considering and for integer filling , the hopping is very efficiently suppressed , and the jahn - teller system can therefore adjust efficiently to the electron - phonon interaction . with an extra electron or hole ,",
    "however , the system can not take advantage of the electron - phonon interaction to the same extent , since the wave function primarily optimizes the hopping of the electron or hole . according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : a3 ] ) , this leads to an increase of the gap . in the a@xmath0 case ,",
    "on the other hand , the system can not couple to the phonons in the integer filling case , and therefore even the reduced coupling to the phonons in the case of an extra electron or hole is sufficient to reduce the gap .",
    "table [ table3 ] furthermore illustrates the competition between the jahn - teller effect and the hund s rule coupling . for @xmath45 and @xmath102 an increase of @xmath2 leads to a reduction of the gap .",
    "as @xmath2 is further increased , the system instead tends to go into high spin states , and the gap is increased as k is increased .",
    "it is interesting to compare the results with a different approach .",
    "we can calculate an effective on - site @xmath110 for the filling @xmath73 as @xmath111 where @xmath33 now refers to the energy of a free molecule , calculated in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] . for @xmath45 and for the @xmath13 case",
    ", we then obtain @xmath112 it is then tempting to assume that for the filling @xmath78 and @xmath102 the gap is given by @xmath113 and @xmath114 , respectively . comparison with table [ table3 ]",
    "shows that this is incorrect in the limit studied here ( eq . ( [ eq : a4 ] ) ) . in particular",
    ", for @xmath78 , this approach would even predict the wrong sign for the the electron - phonon contribution to the gap .",
    "the reason is that eq .",
    "( [ eq : a17 ] ) assumes that the electron - phonon and hund s rule couplings can adjust to the instantaneous occupation of a given site . as we have seen above ,",
    "this is not possible in the limit ( eq .",
    "( [ eq : a4 ] ) ) for the states with an extra electron or hole .",
    "@xmath115 may instead become relevant in the limit when the exchange coupling @xmath2 and the jahn - teller energy @xmath106 are much larger than the hopping energy .",
    "in a similar way we have calculated the gap for the @xmath14 two - site problem .",
    "the results are shown in table [ table4 ] .",
    "these results also illustrate the competition between the jahn - teller effect and the hund s rule coupling .",
    "we now consider the @xmath14 problem in the dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft ) .",
    "we formulate the infinite dimensional limit on the bethe lattice , where the nearest - neighbor hopping integral @xmath116 is rescaled as @xmath117 with the connectivity @xmath118 going to infinity .",
    "we further simplify the hopping by setting @xmath119 only allowing the diagonal hopping .",
    "the unit of energy is chosen such that the bandwidth , @xmath11 , is set to 2 .",
    "the jahn - teller phonons embedded at each lattice sites of the bath can be easily incorporated into the effective medium of the impurity anderson model@xcite , since they are einstein phonons without direct intersite couplings between them .",
    "therefore the lattice contribution of phonons is implicitly included in the medium electron green s function .",
    "we here focus on the problem where the exchange integral @xmath91 .",
    "the effective impurity anderson model is solved using the quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) technique with the fye - hirsch algorithm@xcite , which has only mild `` fermion sign - problems '' with our hamiltonian . here",

    "( [ eq:9a]-[eq:9c ] ) and table [ table4 ] , since the energy is lowered more by the electron - phonon coupling for filling four than for filling three .",
    "according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : a3 ] ) this increases the gap of the insulating state more for filling four than for filling three , i.e. , it makes @xmath4 smaller for filling four . as discussed in the next section , this result is , however , modified by the jahn - teller coupling .",
    "we finally discuss the competition between the jahn - teller effect and the hund s rule coupling . since there is a sign - problem in the dynamical mean - filed calculations if we use the full multiplet coupling in eq .",
    "( [ eq:7 ] ) , we use an exact diagonalization technique .",
    "this requires that the system size is small .",
    "therefore we consider a system with just four sites and we consider the @xmath13 problem ( eq .",
    "( [ eq:2 ] ) ) .",
    "we furthermore limit the hilbert space by not allowing more than two phonons per site . to reduce the discreteness of the one - particle spectrum for such a small system , we pick the hopping integrals randomly .",
    "we calculate the gap according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : a3 ] ) and add some finite size corrections@xcite @xmath140 where @xmath141 is a contribution to the gap from the electrostatic energy of a finite system , @xmath142 is the number of sites and @xmath143 is the gap of a system without any coulomb interaction .",
    "both these corrections go to zero for a large system . assuming that that @xmath144 grows linearly with @xmath29 , we can then use @xmath145 as a crude estimate of the critical @xmath29 .",
    "this quantity is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : k ] . the results can be qualitatively understood from the results in table [ table3 ] for a two - site system , although the parameter range considered here is outside the range where the results in the table are valid . for @xmath135 ,",
    "the critical value of @xmath29 is reduced as @xmath2 is increased , as expected@xcite . however , as @xmath22 is increased , the competition between the jahn - teller and hund s rule effects leads to an increase of the critical @xmath29 .",
    "this is in agreement with table [ table3 ] , although the increase is faster than for the parameter range of this table . for a particular value of @xmath22 ,",
    "the critical @xmath29 becomes comparable to the value for @xmath146 .",
    "as @xmath22 is further increased , the jahn - teller effect becomes dominating and the critical value of @xmath29 decreases again .",
    "this critical value is , however , larger than for @xmath91 , due to the competition between the jahn - teller and hund s rule coupling .",
    "it is interesting to discuss these results in the context of a@xmath5c@xmath6 .",
    "considering just the hubbard @xmath1 ( @xmath147 ) , it is found that the metal - insulator transition in a@xmath9c@xmath6 takes place at the upper range of what is believed to be physical values of @xmath12 , while for a@xmath10c@xmath6 this happens at the lower range of these parameters .",
    "this agrees nicely with the fact that a@xmath9c@xmath6 is a metal but a@xmath10c@xmath6 is an insulator .",
    "however , to explain why a@xmath10c@xmath6 is not antiferromagnetic , we need to include the coupling to the jahn - teller h@xmath0 phonons .",
    "this substantially lowers the critical @xmath4 for both systems , and it puts @xmath134 of a@xmath9c@xmath6 at the lower range of the physical parameters .",
    "this puts our understanding of a@xmath9c@xmath6 being a metal into question .",
    "we find , however , that the competition between the jahn - teller effect and the hund s rule coupling increases @xmath4 again .",
    "the coupling to the @xmath8 plasmons in a@xmath9c@xmath6 should lead to an additional increase of @xmath4 in this system .",
    "this makes it understandable that a@xmath9c@xmath6 can be a metal .",
