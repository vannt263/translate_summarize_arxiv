    "in this paper we present a quantization formula for the one - dimensional dirac equation using the analytical transfer matrix ( atm ) method , thereby extending the non - relativistic analogue for the schrdinger equation found by cao et al .",
    "we focus on the relativistic energy levels offered by a simple confining scalar potential well with two turning points .    the high accuracy of the eigenvalues computable from this formula together with other applications like ground state reconstruction should prove to be useful in many applications of the dirac equation , especially in the context of solid state physics @xcite .    our result can be thought of as a completion of well known semi - classical quantization formulae ( like bohr  sommerfeld and wkb ) in the following sense .",
    "the semi - classical quantization formulae provide reliable estimates of the energy eigenvalues only in the limit of large quantum numbers , while the atm - quantization formula gives exact eigenvalues for all quantum numbers . as a result , cao et al .",
    "additionally characterize this formula as an ` exact quantization formula . '    in anticipation of the derivation given below , we would like to pursue this comparison a little further .",
    "the reader will recall that , in the wkb quantization formula , for instance , the boundary conditions at the turning points when applied to a suitably chosen approximate ansatz ( for the actual wave function ) , lead to quantization of energy .",
    "however , the atm method is based on transfer matrices which , in the appropriate limit ` recovers ' the exact wave function @xmath3 and the ( corresponding ) energy eigenvalue @xmath1 .",
    "structurally , the exact quantization formula contains the usual wkb term with a non - trivial correction contributed by the so - called ` scattered sub- waves ' , which is of great significance ( discussed in section  [ sec2 ] ) .",
    "particularly , for the dirac equation the negative energy ( antiparticle ) solutions make the energy spectrum unbounded from below , which for general potentials is difficult to account for using the atm method . also , the generalization of this method for even the schrdinger equation to potentials having more than two classical turning points ( @xmath4 for which @xmath5 ) is not clear at present .",
    "this difficulty translates to our inability to obtain the quantization condition for the dirac problem for potential wells that either ( 1 ) give more than two classical turning points , or ( 2 ) satisfy @xmath6 , or both .",
    "owing to these limitations , we narrow our focus to potential wells with only two classical turning points and satisfying @xmath7 . for this restricted class of potential wells we can apply the atm method successfully .    following up with the derivation in section  [ sec2 ] we point to some desirable symmetries of the quantization formula in section  [ sec3 ] and discuss its non - relativistic limit .",
    "section  [ sec4 ] is devoted to numerical results and applications .",
    "we conclude in section  [ sec5 ] outlining prospects of further study .",
    "consider the one - particle dirac hamiltonian @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the momentum operator and @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) is the rest mass of the particle ( speed of light ) .",
    "we choose to represent the dirac matrix @xmath12 by the pauli matrix @xmath13 , which has the advantage that the two - component wave function @xmath14 can be chosen to be real @xcite . the time independent dirac equation prescribes the eigenvalue problem @xmath15 , where @xmath1 is the energy of the particle .",
    "further , the property @xmath16 shows that the positive and negative solutions occur in pairs .",
    "hence , it suffices to consider positive energy solutions alone .",
    "the ( reduced ) compton wavelength @xmath17 and rest mass energy @xmath18 provide natural length and energy scales in this problem .",
    "thus , expressing every quantity in dimensionless form @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , the dirac equation translates into the coupled first order system of equations @xmath22 the overhead dot denoting differentiation w.r.t .",
    "we identify solutions of the equations @xmath24 as effective turning points . for the schematic potential well depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , two turning points @xmath25 are obtained for a typical energy @xmath26 . note that more than two effective turning points would result for @xmath27 unless the restrictions noted in section  [ sec1 ] are enforced on @xmath28 .",
    ", showing effective turning points @xmath29 for a typical energy @xmath30 . ]",
    "next , we partition the interval between the two turning points into @xmath31 segments @xmath32 . denoting the width of the @xmath33^th^ segment by @xmath34",
    ", we choose an arbitrary point ( a tag ) @xmath35 within each segment and replace the scalar potential by a piecewise - constant approximation for which the potential in the @xmath33 ^th^ segment is given by @xmath36 .",
    "consequently , on this segment the system of eqs . and admits a general solution of the form @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 are arbitrary coefficients , and @xmath40 note that in the region of interest @xmath41 , @xmath42 are real , hence the wave function components @xmath43 are oscillatory .",
    "in favor of a simpler notation , we drop the superscript @xmath33 from the wave function and infer the segment label from the context .    ensuring the continuity of @xmath44 at the ends of the segment leads to the ( transfer ) matrix equation @xmath45 since we allow only two turning points at this stage",
    ", @xmath42 is nonzero in each segment .",
    "consequently , the transfer matrices are always well defined .",
    "now , left multiplying eq .   by @xmath46 and dividing the resulting equation by @xmath47 , we arrive at @xmath48 where @xmath49 .",
    "simplifying this matrix equation gives the recurrence formula @xmath50 rearranging eq .   and summing over @xmath33 from 1 to @xmath31 yields @xmath51 the desired quantization condition emerges as a limit of eq .",
    "as @xmath52 . in the limiting event ,",
    "the continuous potential variation @xmath53 is recovered , with @xmath54 and @xmath55 . in appendix  [ appa ]",
    "we prove that ( for bound state wave functions ) @xmath56 and @xmath57 . also , as @xmath58 , @xmath59 . as a result ,",
    "the ` half phase losses ' at the effective turning points are given by @xmath60 next , we account for the phase contribution of the so - called scattered sub- waves . defining the phase contribution for each segment @xmath61 which results from expanding the inverse tangent in a taylor series in powers of @xmath62 , we obtain the total phase contribution of the scattered sub - waves by @xmath63 thus , in the limit @xmath58 , eq",

    "we begin by describing two symmetries of eq .   that are physically desirable .      in section  [ sec2 ]",
    "we chose a convenient representation of the dirac matrices @xmath71 .",
    "however , the quantized energy levels are a property of the potential @xmath72 , hence should be independent of the chosen representation .",
    "this feature is already built into the quantization condition and can be shown in the following way .",
    "we know that the dirac matrices satisfy the algebra : @xmath73 and @xmath74 . given any other representation of the dirac matrices ( denoted @xmath75 ) satisfying the same algebra , ( a generalization of ) pauli s fundamental theorem @xcite asserts that there exists a unique ( invertible ) matrix @xmath76 ( up to a multiplicative complex constant ) such that @xmath77 a direct substitution shows that this transformation preserves the structure of the dirac equation ( for the same @xmath1 ) with the wave function transforming as @xmath78 .",
    "additionally , as the dirac matrices are hermitian , we must have @xmath79 ( unitarity of @xmath80 ) . using the transformation",
    "eq .   in eq .",
    "and noting that @xmath81=\\bm{s}^\\dagger[\\bm{\\alpha}',\\bm{\\beta}']\\bm{s}$ ] gives @xmath82\\psi}{\\psi^\\dagger(c\\bm{\\alpha}p ) \\psi}\\mapsto\\frac{\\psi'^\\dagger[\\bm{\\alpha'},\\bm{\\beta'}]\\psi'}{\\psi'^\\dagger ( c\\bm{\\alpha'}p)\\psi'}\\ ] ] thus confirming the representation independence of the obtained quantization condition .",
    "although we assumed @xmath1 to be positive in the derivation of eq .  , the quantization condition should not depend on the sign of the eigenvalue .",
    "since @xmath84 is a function of @xmath85 , the apparent asymmetry stems from the factor @xmath86 in eq .  .",
    "using the properties @xmath87 , @xmath88 we obtain @xmath89 which in the light of our earlier observation @xmath90 establishes the expected symmetry .",
    "as the effective turning points remain unchanged under @xmath91 , eq . also holds for the antiparticle solutions .    finally , we look at the non - relativistic limit of eq .   and affirm that it reproduces the schrdinger quantization formula found by cao et al .",
    "@xcite in this limit . the non - relativistic limit con cerns energies @xmath92 ; and is easily demonstrated by the replacements : ( 1 ) @xmath93 and ( 2 ) @xmath94 , where @xmath95 ( the ` shifted ' energy ) is a small quantity ( cf .",

    "we arrive at the limiting forms of @xmath98 and @xmath99 @xmath100 with @xmath101 where the subscript @xmath102 is intended for notational homogeneity of later equations .",
    "proceeding further , we substitute these results into eq .   making the following observations @xmath103 @xmath104 thus arriving at ( @xmath105 ) @xmath106 where @xmath107(@xmath108 ) denotes the left ( right ) ` classical ' turning point given by the smaller ( larger ) of the two roots of the equation @xmath109 .",
    "the above equation is the correct non - relativistic limit of eq .  , which agrees with the well - known quantization formula describing the bound states of the schrdinger equation @xcite .",
    "we turn now to a discussion of computational aspects of eq .   and outline some applications of the same . before proceeding , we point to an apparent impediment , namely , the integrand singularities at the turning points @xmath110 arising as a result of @xmath111 without further qualification",
    ", such points might cause the integral to diverge .",
    "luckily , this does not happen , as we rigorously show in appendix [ appb ] .",
    "furthermore , convergence requirements do not restrict the class of admissible potentials to which our analysis applies . with that caveat , we look at the problem of determining energy eigenvalues of the dirac equation for a given scalar potential @xmath72 .",
    "the collection of one - dimensional potentials for which the dirac equation is closed - form solvable is rather small . even for the modest ( scalar )",
    "` simple ' harmonic oscillator , the wave - functions can not be obtained in closed analytic form . to our knowledge",
    "the one - dimensional woods - saxon potential @xcite , the linear confining potential @xcite and the scalar exponential potential @xcite have enjoyed closed form solutions so far .",
    "thus , an accurate quantization formula becomes particularly useful .",
    "consider the linear confining potential @xmath112 whose wave functions are written in terms of the hermite function @xmath113 @xcite . adopting the conventions @xmath114 , @xmath115 given in ref .",

    ".   takes the form @xmath120 where the overhead dot now denotes differentiation w.r.t .",
    "@xmath4 . substituting the wave functions in the l.h.s of eq .  , we obtain      the derivation of which makes use of the recurrence formula @xmath122 @xcite . the quantization condition can be rewritten as @xmath123 .",
    "note that for @xmath124 there can be no turning points .",
    "therefore , bound state solutions can only be expected for @xmath125 .",
    "in figure [ fig2 ] we plot the graphs of @xmath128 for @xmath129 as a function of @xmath130 .",
    "these curves intersect the horizontal integer- lines ( shown in the same figure ) precisely at the locations of the energy eigenvalues , thus confirming remarkably the validity of eq .  .",
    "for comparison , we collect the graphical intersection points ( computed using bisection search ) in table [ tab1 ] where the exact eigenvalues obtained by cavalcanti @xcite are also listed .",
    "now , concerning potentials for which the wave functions are not obtainable in terms of known functions , a numerical routine can be outlined for the dirac problem ( following the prescription given in @xcite for the non - relativistic atm - quantization formula ) yielding eigenvalue estimates , whose accuracy is only appreciable for larger eigenvalues  a feature that we do not understand completely at present .",

    "therefore , @xmath133 substituting this result in inequality we obtain @xmath134 which is finite ( due to inequalities and ) .",
