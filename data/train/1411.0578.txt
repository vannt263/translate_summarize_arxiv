    "the theory of multidimensional diophantine approximation is concerned with approximating subspaces ( or more generally , manifolds ) in higher dimensional spaces by rational points .",
    "this is closely related to the theory of cut and project sets , in which portions of a higher dimensional lattice are projected onto a lower dimensional set .",
    "cut and project sets are important for a number of reasons .",
    "they arise as central objects of study in many problems in number theory and dynamical systems and , as discovered by de bruijn @xcite , they provide a rich source of aperiodic tilings of euclidean space .",
    "they also give us a convenient mathematical model for producing patterns which occur naturally in physical materials known as quasicrystals @xcite .",
    "the particular problems which we are studying in this paper have direct consequences to understanding the distribution of distances between molecules and patterns in quasicrystals @xcite , as well as to related problems of understanding the distribution of energy levels in sums of forced harmonic oscillators @xcite .    in diophantine approximation",
    "there are many ` gaps ' theorems ( surveys of which can be found in @xcite and @xcite ) , which can be divided into two categories .",
    "the first category is what we will call slater - type results , and the second , what we will call steinhaus - type results . before stating our main theorems we briefly explain how",
    "both of these types of results can be formulated in a natural way as problems about cut and project sets .    in slater - type results",
    "we start with a @xmath2-action on a ( possibly higher dimensional ) torus and count the number of patterns of return times of the orbit of a point to some target region .",
    "the prototypical example of this is slater s theorem , proved in @xcite , in which we consider return times to an interval of the orbit of a point in @xmath3 under the action of an irrational rotation .",
    "slater s theorem says that the gap between any two consecutive return times takes one of at most @xmath4 values . from the point of view of cut and project sets ,",
    "slater - type results are results about patch complexity ( the number of patterns of a given size ) .",
    "they are directly linked to problems about the cohomology of tiling spaces associated to cut and project sets .",
    "this is demonstrated , although without the connection to diophantine approximation , by a theorem of julien in @xcite , which shows that the cohomology is finitely generated if and only if the number of patches of size @xmath0 grows asymptotically as slowly as possible .    in steinhaus - type results",
    "we again consider the orbit of a point in a torus , under a @xmath2-action .",
    "this time we are interested in understanding the ` gaps ' between points in the torus in finite pieces of the orbit .",
    "the prototype here is the steinhaus theorem ( first proved by ss @xcite and wierczkowski @xcite ) , which says that , for any @xmath5 and @xmath6 , the points @xmath7 with @xmath8 , partition the circle into intervals of at most @xmath4 distinct lengths . by an ergodic theoretic argument",
    ", steinhaus - type problems are equivalent to problems about the number of frequencies of patches of a given size in cut and project sets .",

    "let @xmath28 be a compact set that is the closure of its interior , which we will refer to as the * window*. for our purposes , the window will always be a polytope , usually a parallelotope spanned by integer vectors .",

    "for @xmath31 , we define @xmath32 the set @xmath33 is called a * cut and project set * , or a model set , and is always a delone set of finite local complexity .",
    "the significance of the condition @xmath34 is that each point in @xmath33 is associated with a unique point in @xmath35 .",
    "if @xmath36 is * regular * , meaning that @xmath37 does not intersect the boundary of @xmath38 , then @xmath33 is repetitive , meaning that all patterns appear infinitely often and relatively densely .",
    "one can consider the space of all sets @xmath33 with @xmath36 regular , plus appropriate limiting point patterns .",
    "there is a natural translational action of @xmath9 on this tiling space , and the resulting dynamical system is measurably conjugate to the translational action of @xmath9 on @xmath39 .",
    "the only invariant measure is lebesgue measure ( since @xmath9 is totally irrational ) , and the ergodic theorem relates statistical properties of any @xmath33 to volumes in @xmath11 , or to volumes in @xmath25 . since these statistical properties are independent of @xmath36 , we henceforth suppress the subscript and denote our cut and project set as @xmath40",
