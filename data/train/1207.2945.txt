    "gravity@xcite is a second generation 4-beam combiner instrument for eso s very large telescope interferometer ( vlti ) at paranal observatory .",
    "operating in the near - infrared ( nir ) k - band ( 2.2  @xmath0 m ) , it will provide of order 10-micro - arcsec astrometric precision and phase - referenced imaging with 4 milli - arcsec resolution . with fibre - fed integrated optics , wavefront sensors , fringe tracker , beam stabilisation and a novel metrology concept , gravity s performance will bring a dramatic improvement on current nir interferometric instrumentation in sensitivity as well as astrometric precision .",
    "first astronomical light at vlti is planned for 2014 .",
    "key science goals for gravity include :    * probing the physics in the immediate vicinity of the galactic centre black hole@xcite ; * detecting and measuring the masses of black holes in massive star clusters ; * study the details of mass accretion and jets in young stellar objects ; and * characterize the detailed motions of exoplanets , binary stars and young stellar discs .",
    "crucial to achieving its ambitious science goals is the implementation of adaptive optics ( ao ) correction to provide seeing - improved beams to the instrument .",
    "the gravity project includes a development programme for 4 new wavefront sensors ( wfs ) for the vlt unit telescopes , which will allow the measurement of the atmospheric turbulence correction in the nir h and k bands ( 1.4 - 2.4  @xmath0 m ) .",
    "these wfs will be installed in the coud space for each ut , and interface directly with the existing multiple application curvature adaptive optics ( macao ) systems at vlt .    in this paper",
    ", we present an overview of the design and development of these wfs units and their real time control , as well as the expected on - sky performance in the various operational modes of the ao system .",
    "the following sections will provide basic descriptions of the gravity instrument , its subsystems and operational concept , and the ao architecture for the instrument .",
    "the gravity instrument consists of three major components : the beam - combiner instrument , the laser metrology system , and the wavefront sensors ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : grav_diagram ] ) . in the beam combiner instrument",
    ", the four input beams from the unit or auxiliary telescopes are combined to produce interferograms from six baselines simultaneously .",
    "fringe tracking is implemented internally to the instrument to compensate in real time for longitudinal vibrations and atmospheric piston@xcite .",
    "the input beams are fed via optical fibres into two integrated optics beam combiners@xcite .",
    "the fringes of both science and fringe tracking targets are spectrally dispersed by the spectrometers inside the beam combiner cryostat , with the science spectrometer providing spectral resolutions of r@xmath220 , @xmath2500 or @xmath24000@xcite .",
    "the fringe tracking spectrometer provides low - resolution dispersion only .",
    "the laser metrology system tracks a reference beam through the observatory , allowing for a precise measurement of the optical path .",
    "when observing with the vlt uts , gravity s ao system will use parts of the existing adaptive optics ( ao ) hardware to correct for atmospheric turbulence effects .",
    "wavefront sensing will however be performed with dedicated wfs operating at nir wavelengths , interfacing with the macao dms already present at the uts .",
    "light is fed to the wfs from the telescopes via the star separator systems ( sts)@xcite , installed at the coud foci of each ut as part of the prima instrument , which can pick up 2 stars anywhere inside a 2 field .",
    "the top - level functional requirements for the wfs are :    * provide real - time processing of wavefront distortions ; * allow for on - axis and off - axis wavefront sensing ; * provide sensing in the h and k bands ( 1.45 - 2.45  @xmath0 m ) ; * allow use by other vlti instruments ; * interface to the existing macao deformable mirrors .    in on - axis mode ,",
    "the science target itself is used as ao reference source , in this case a beam splitter redirects @xmath250% of the light to the wfs , with the rest passing to the vlti tunnels towards the gravity beam combiner . in off - axis mode , where a dedicated reference source is used",
    ", the wfs receives all the light from the ao reference .",
    "performance requirements for the wfs are as follows :    * mk=7 : strehl 25% for 7  off - axis ao reference source at 30@xmath3zenith angle * mk=7 : strehl 35% for on - axis ao reference source at 30@xmath3zenith angle",
    "* mk=10 : strehl 10% on - axis at zenith * rms tip / tilt at the sts in the coud room of @xmath4 10 mas on sky for mk = 7 , @xmath4 20 mas on sky for mk = 10 * piston fluctuations of @xmath4 25 nm rms over 48 ms , @xmath4 125 nm rms over 290 ms , @xmath4 2000 nm rms over 10 min .",
    "the main new hardware under development for the ciao system is the nir wavefront sensor . in addition",
    ", a new real time control system will be implemented for the operation of the ao system .",
    "this section describes the optical and cryo - mechanical design of the full wfs unit , as well as the control architecture and detector characteristics .",
    "the wavefront sensors follow a straightforward shack - hartmann design .",
    "the incoming light is passed through a lenslet array , with each spot refocused onto the detector , from where the distorted wavefront is characterized .",
    "each wfs unit comprises a warm and cold assembly .",
    "the warm optics , shown in fig .  [ fig : wfs_warm ] , relay the light from the telescope and the sts units to the cryostat .",
    "the entrance into the wfs is the ao mode selector consisting of a dichroic and three flat mirrors mounted onto a translation stage , which chooses one of three operational modes for the wfs : ( i ) on - axis mode , splitting the beam 50/50 between the wfs and the vlti laboratory ; ( ii ) off - axis mode , 100% of the light into the wfs , and ( iii ) visible ao mode , using the existing visible - light macao system .",
    "the light is subsequently folded by parabolic and flat mirrors to the pupil derotator , which maintains pupil orientation throughout an observation . the parabolic mirror",
    "will be mounted in a motorized gimbal for optical alignment and focus adjustment .",
    "the derotator follows a simple k - mirror design in protected gold - coated aluminium .",
    "the cold optics are kept at inside a bath cryostat ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : wfs_cold ] ) , the cooling concept is described in section  [ sec : wfs_cryomech ] . inside the cryostat ,",
    "a field lens compensates for pupil motion using a piezoelectric actuator .",
    "after this , the light is relayed to the lenslet array via a filter wheel , holding bandpass and neutral density filters .",
    "the lenslet array focuses 9 x 9 spots onto the detector from 192  @xmath0 m  diameter micro - lenslets , each with a focal length of 2.09 mm .",
    "further details of the optical design are presented by yang et al.@xcite in these proceedings .",
    "table  [ tab : selex_req ] summarises the key requirements for detector performance for the wfs .    the gravity wfs will for the first time use recently developed high - speed ir electron avalanche photodiode ( eapd ) arrays , developed by eso and selex - galileo .",
    "the selex / eso saphira arrays have been shown to reach read noise levels of @xmath43 e- and quantum efficiency ( qe ) of @xmath240% at 80k@xcite .",
    "the arrays measure 320 @xmath5 256 24@xmath0 m  pixels , of which the wfs requires a read - out window of 72 @xmath5 72 pixels for the spot array ( 9 subapertures , 8 pixels / subaperture ) .",
    "the detector noise characteristics , qe and cosmetics are all significantly improved at lower temperatures , and to benefit from this a cryostat development programme is under way to lower the wfs operating temperature to 40k ( see section  [ sec : wfs_cryomech ] ) .",
    "the detector read - out is managed by eso s next generation controller ( ngc)@xcite , a new high - speed data acquisition system , to be housed inside the coud lab close to the detector array .",
    ".requirements for the performance of the ir detectors for the gravity wfs . [ cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "the gravity wfs development programme will enable adaptive optics wavefront sensing at ir wavelengths for the first time at the vlt interferometer , enabling the use of ir - bright reference sources for the gravity instrument .",
    "detailed performance simulations show that the wfs with a shack - hartmann optical design scheme will provide 360 nm rms residual wfe for the case of a mk=7 ao guide star observed on - axis , in line with the required performance .",
    "the wfs will benefit greatly from the use of the new selex / eso saphira eapd detector arrays , which will for the first time allow frame rates of @xmath2500  hz with low read noise ( 6.5 e- rms ) compared with current state - of - the - art nir detectors .",
    "part of the instrument will be cooled to ln2 temperatures , with an upgrade path for pulse tube cooling to 40k under active development",
    ".    the wfs will be comprehensively tested in the adaptive optics lab at mpia , where closed loop performance will be achieved with the aid of an atmospheric seeing generator and a macao deformable mirror identical to the units installed at vlt . the first gravity wfs is expected to see first light at paranal in 2014 .",
