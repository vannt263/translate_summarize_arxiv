    "the nature of the electron - hole excitations in parent quasi-2d cuprates such as la@xmath12cuo@xmath13 , sr@xmath4cuo@xmath4cl@xmath4 , yba@xmath4cu@xmath5o@xmath14 , and their 1d counterparts like sr@xmath4cuo@xmath5 , sr@xmath4cuo@xmath4 , li@xmath4cuo@xmath4 represents an important challenging issue both for the high-@xmath15 problem and , more generally , for strongly correlated oxides .",
    "the mechanism of low - energy electron - hole excitations as well as those with higher energy and high intensity is still unclear .",
    "it is now widely believed that the most intensive low - energy electronic excitations in quasi-2d insulating copper oxides correspond to the transfer of electrons from o to cu in the cuo@xmath12 layer , hence these materials are charge transfer ( ct ) insulators.@xcite moreover , sometimes the intensive band near @xmath16 ev is naively supposed to be the only representative of the o @xmath2-cu @xmath1 charge transfer , and higher - lying structures are assigned to transitions relevant to cu @xmath17 , la @xmath18 , sr @xmath19 , or ca @xmath20 depending on the actual chemical formula of the corresponding cuprate .    despite the giant ( @xmath21 ) number of experimental and theoretical papers on cuprates",
    "we deal actually with a lack of detailed studies of electron - hole excitations both in parent and high-@xmath15 cuprates .",
    "the most part of optical information @xcite was obtained to date by reflectivity measurements followed by a kramers - kronig transformation usually accompanied by a number of unavoidable uncertainties as regards the peak positions and intensities of weak spectral features .",
    "nevertheless , applying different optical measurements including raman spectroscopy and nonlinear susceptibility , one obtains important information , in particular , as regards the subtleties of the optical gap states in such insulating cuprates as cuo , @xcite la@xmath4cuo@xmath3 , @xcite r@xmath4cuo@xmath3 ( r = la , nd , eu , gd ) , @xcite yba@xmath4cu@xmath5o@xmath14 , @xcite sr@xmath4cuo@xmath4cl@xmath4 , @xcite and sr@xmath4cuo@xmath5.@xcite    unfortunately , any conventional optical technique is momentum restricted , and yields an @xmath22 information on the dielectric function @xmath23 only at the @xmath24-point given by @xmath25 . in other words , such a technique can not probe the dynamics of electron - hole excitations .    in this connection",
    ", we would like to emphasize the decisive role of @xmath26 eels measurements in the observation and analysis of electron - hole excitations as compared with conventional @xmath22 optical data .",
    "the possibility to yield the polarization and momentum dependent loss function @xmath27 makes eels a powerful tool to examine subtle details of the energy spectrum and dynamics of electron - hole excitations in cuprates .",
    "@xcite in the limit @xmath25 the selection rules are the same as in optics , i.e. only dipole transitions are allowed . for finite @xmath11 nondipole transitions",
    "are detected as well .",
    "in contrast to reflectivity measurements , the eels in transmission is a surface insensitive technique .",
    "recently , momentum resolved resonant inelastic x - ray scattering ( rixs ) measurements @xcite performed for sr@xmath4cuo@xmath4cl@xmath4 and ca@xmath4cuo@xmath4cl@xmath4 have demonstrated the feasibility of rixs to study electron - hole excitations in insulating cuprates .",
    "the theoretical analysis of optical excitations beyond simple band models has been mostly performed in the frame of conventional hubbard - like models , where one usually considers only o @xmath28 orbitals , and neglects o @xmath29 and o @xmath30 orbitals at all . in the parameter regime",
    "appropriate for undoped cuprates , one implies that the one hole per unit cell is mainly localized on the cu site .",
    "application of the current operator onto this state provides a charge transfer from the cu to the o site .",
    "thus , one would expect a dominant absorption feature at the energy of the charge transfer gap . in terms of the hubbard model ,",
    "this is a ct transition from the nonbonding oxygen to the upper hubbard band .",
    "it was emphasized that instead of a transition to the upper hubbard band , it is more reasonable to speak of a transition to the correlated zhang - rice @xcite type states .",
    "@xcite    one of the central issues in the analysis of electron - hole excitations is whether low - lying states are comprised of free charge carriers or excitons .",
    "a conventional approach implies that if the coulomb interaction is effectively screened and weak , then the electrons and holes are only weakly bound and move essentially independently as free charge - carriers .",
    "however , if the coulomb interaction between electron and hole is strong , excitons are formed , i.e.  bound particle - hole pairs with strong correlation of their mutual motion . in practice , many authors consider excitons to consist of real - space configurations with electrons and holes occupying nearest neighbor sites , while the electrons and holes are separated from each other in the conduction - band states.@xcite    the electron - hole excitations near the ct gap in insulating cuo@xmath4 planes were theoretically examined in ref .   in terms of a six - band model and",
    "using the cell - perturbation method .",
    "the excitons were approximately treated as electrons and holes moving freely in their respective quasi - particle bands , except in the nearest neighborhood , where they feel an attraction and an on - site interaction determined by the eigenstate of the cell hamiltonian , which leads to a rather small exciton dispersion .    however , a small exciton dispersion is in contradiction to the results of the eels measurements for the 2d model cuprate sr@xmath4cuo@xmath4cl@xmath4 .",
    "@xcite these measurements stimulated the elaboration of a simple ct exciton model by zhang and ng.@xcite they used a local model to study the formation and the structure of the low - energy charge - transfer excitations in the insulating cuo@xmath4 plane restricting themselves to the cu @xmath31 and o @xmath28 orbitals .",
    "the elementary excitation is a bound exciton of spin singlet , consisting of a cu@xmath32 and a neighboring zhang - rice singlet - like excitation of cu - o holes with a rather large dispersion .",
    "they considered four eigenmodes of excitons with different symmetry @xmath33 , or @xmath34 .",
    "the experimental peak analysis in sr@xmath4cuo@xmath4cl@xmath4 revealed a surprisingly large energy dispersion @xmath35 ev along @xmath36 $ ] which was interpreted in terms of a small exciton moving through the lattice freely without disturbing the antiferromagnetic spin background , in contrast to the single hole motion.@xcite so , it seems that the situation in antiferromagnetic cuprates differs substantially from that in usual semiconductors or in other bandlike insulators where , as a rule , the effective mass of the electron - hole pair is larger than that of an unbound electron and hole .",
    "other theoretical works in the frame of conventional hubbard - like models , without the o @xmath9 and @xmath30 orbitals , are those by hanamura _ et .",
    "_ @xcite and kuzian _ et .",
    "@xcite the _ excitonic cluster model _ @xcite has been elaborated to describe the ct transitions in insulating cuprates in frame of the conventional three - band hubbard hamiltonian .",
    "the authors made an attempt to treat both the bound and unbound states of the ct electron - hole pair on the same footing . to this end",
    "they performed perturbation calculation for the excited states of @xmath37 symmetry generated by the oxygen o @xmath38 hole separated from the cu @xmath39 electron by distances of 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , or 5 nearest neighbors . to evaluate the dipole transition matrix element they took into account only the transition between the @xmath40 and the o @xmath38 orbital of @xmath41 symmetry .",
    "the frequency and wave number dependence of the dielectric function @xmath42 and its inverse @xmath43 has also been studied in ref .  .",
    "the authors show that the problem , in general , can not be reduced to a calculation within the single band hubbard model , which takes into account only a restricted number of electronic states near the fermi energy .",
    "the contribution of the rest of the system to the longitudinal response is essential for the whole frequency range . with the use of the spectral representation of the two - particle green s function",
    "they show that the problem may be divided into two parts : into the contributions of the weakly correlated and the hubbard subsystems . for the latter",
    "an approach is proposed that starts from the correlated paramagnetic ground state with strong antiferromagnetic fluctuations .",
    "the method is applied to the multiband hubbard ( emery ) model that describes layered cuprates .",
    "already a shorthand inspection of the original experimental data,@xcite and especially of the high - resolution eels spectra @xcite for sr@xmath4cuo@xmath4cl@xmath4 point to some essential shortcomings of the zhang - ng ( zn ) model .",
    "the high - resolution eels spectra @xcite for insulating sr@xmath4cuo@xmath4cl@xmath4 with a momentum range along [ 110 ] broader than in ref .",
    "did not confirm two principal predictions of the zn - model : no spots of the predicted @xmath44-mode exciton were found in a broad energy range below @xmath45 ev ; a clear decrease contrary to the predicted increase of eels intensity along @xmath46 $ ] was observed with momentum increase from @xmath47 to @xmath48 .",
    "moreover , the high - resolution measurements @xcite unambiguously detected a `` multi - excitonic '' nature of eels spectra in the @xmath49 ev energy range with a clear manifestation of several dispersionless narrow bands with energies near @xmath50 , and @xmath51 ev .",
    "thus , we conclude that the simple zn model should be revisited to consistently explain the large body of new experimental data .",
    "especially important is the proper inclusion of the o @xmath9 orbitals into the theory of electron - hole excitations .",
    "one of the first microscopic models for the low - energy ct transition in the insulating copper oxide cuo peaked near 1.7 ev was given in ref .. this transition was assigned to the dipole - allowed ct transition @xmath52 from the cu @xmath1-o @xmath2 hybrid @xmath53 hole ground state to the purely oxygen orbital doublet @xmath41 state with predominant o @xmath9 weight . to the best of our knowledge , it was the first indication of an optical manifestation of low - lying nonbonding o @xmath9 states .    in the present work we generalize the zn - theory into a simple , physically clear , cluster theory for the ct excitons that on the one hand catches the essential physics and on the other hand",
    "provides a semi - quantitative description of the optical and eels spectra . a preliminary analysis @xcite has shown that a concise interpretation of the experimental eels spectra may be obtained by developing further the zn - model with respect to two points .",
    "first of all , we include the complete set of cu @xmath1 and o @xmath2 orbitals of the plaquette in terms of the embedded cluster method . and second , we argue that the elementary o - cu ct process @xcite generates two types of excitons : one - center excitons localized on one cuo@xmath3 plaquette and two - center excitons extending over two cuo@xmath3 plaquettes .",
    "we base our argumentation mainly on the @xmath54 dependence of the corresponding eels intensity as revealed by a detailed analysis of matrix elements of one- and two - center excitons .",
    "we also investigate the exciton dynamics .",
    "finally we arrive at a semi - quantitative understanding of the electronic states that dominate the optical and eels response in a rather broad energy range . in such a way we explain the main features of optical and angle - resolved eels spectra for a large number of different cuprates .",
    "they reach from the 0d compound cub@xmath4o@xmath3 , over the 1d cuprate sr@xmath4cuo@xmath3 up to the 2d model compound sr@xmath4cuo@xmath4cl@xmath4 and the parent cuprates of high-@xmath15 superconductors . for instance",
    ", we present an alternative explanation of the angle - resolved eels spectra of sr@xmath4cuo@xmath4cl@xmath4 that is free from many shortcomings of the zn - model .",
    "we should emphasize that our theory , like also those of zhang and ng can not provide a proof whether the low - lying particle - hole pairs are bound or not .",
    "it has to be expected that at least the higher lying particle - hole excitations on a finite cluster do in reality not exist as quasi - particle excitations with infinite life time .",
    "nevertheless , they should be visible in the spectra as resonances , having possibly a rather large broadening . in that sense",
    ", we will denote @xmath55 particle - hole excitations as @xmath56 in the present paper .",
    "the question of its life time has to be answered independently .",
    "therefore , we can not contribute for example to the ongoing discussion about the stability of long - lived excitons in 1d cuprates .",
    "@xcite    the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we shortly address the electronic structure and the energy spectrum of a cuo@xmath3 cluster .",
    "the one - center small excitons with appropriate transition matrix elements are considered in sec .",

    "iv . in sec .  v we address the problem of the energy and intensity dispersion of two - center excitons . sec .",
    "vi is devoted to a model analysis of the experimental eels spectra in 0d , 1d and 2d insulating cuprates .",
    "the electronic states in strongly correlated cuprates manifest both significant correlations and dispersional features . the dilemma posed by such",
    "a combination is the overwhelming number of configurations which must be considered in treating strong correlations in a truly bulk system .",
    "one strategy to deal with this dilemma is to restrict oneself to small clusters , creating model hamiltonians whose spectra may reasonably well represent the energy and dispersion of the important excitations of the full problem .",
    "naturally , such an approach has a number of principal shortcomings , including the boundary conditions , the breaking of local symmetry of boundary atoms , and so on .    as an efficient approach to describe excitonic states , especially with small effective electron - hole separation",
    "we propose here the embedded molecular cluster method . in the present context",
    "we use one or two neighboring cuo@xmath3 clusters embedded into the insulating cuprate .",
    "this method provides both , a clear physical picture of the complex electronic structure and the energy spectrum , as well as the possibility of quantitative modelling .",
    "@xcite , as well as ghijsen _",
    "@xcite have shown that in a certain sense the cluster calculations might provide a better description of the overall electronic structure of insulating copper oxides than band - structure calculations .",

    "the main criteria are the binding energy and the average electron - hole separation . namely the latter provides the localization and stability of excitations due to their small overlap for nearest neighbors ( small tunneling amplitude ) , and finally leads to a narrow exciton band .",
    "below we address the most probable candidate states for small one- and two - center ct excitons .",
    "it should be noted that the main concept which we apply has in many aspects a close similarity with those used for ct excitons of linear - chain organic @xmath71-conjugated polymers .",
    "@xcite some symmetry aspects of the ct excitons in cuprates were addressed by cherepanov _",
    "et al_. @xcite      among the numerous one - center electron - hole ct excitations the first candidates for dipole - active excitons are ct transitions @xmath86 from the ground state @xmath87 to the purely oxygen doublet o @xmath88-o @xmath38 hybrid states @xmath89 , which are allowed in `` in - plane '' polarization @xmath90 , and the @xmath91 transition to purely oxygen o @xmath30-like state , which is allowed in `` out - of - plane '' polarization @xmath92 .",
    "all these one - center excitons may be rather simply represented as a hole rotating on the four nearest oxygens around an electron predominantly localized in the cu @xmath93 state with a minimal electron - hole separation @xmath94 2  ( see fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) .",
    "the two excitons @xmath95 and @xmath96 differ by the oxygen hole density distribution : for the former this has a predominantly o @xmath9 character , while for the latter it has a o @xmath38 one .",
    "it should be noted that the excitonic doublet state may be considered as two current states @xmath97 , or two currentless states @xmath98 with quenched orbital motion .",
    "the former are excited by circular polarized light , while the latter by linear polarized one .",
    "the double degeneracy for the @xmath99 excitons results in anomalously strong electron - lattice coupling with all features typical for the jahn - teller effect,@xcite in particular , high probability to form a self - trapped state . in any case , these excitons should be considered as first candidates for resonant phonon raman scattering activity .",
    "one should specifically emphasize that along with resonance excitation of the allowed raman modes the jahn - teller excitons could generate forbidden phonon modes .    among dipole",
    "inactive excitons one should note @xmath100 and , especially , @xmath101 with purely oxygen o @xmath9 holes .",
    "the latter incorporates a purely oxygen @xmath102 hole , which has in frames of our model the minimal energy among all the purely oxygen states . in accordance with the model energy spectrum ( see ref . ) its energy should be of the order of @xmath103 ev , or in other words appears to be lower than the optical gap . this circumstance draws specific attention to this exciton , despite the @xmath101 transition is dipole forbidden . due to the purely oxygen nature of the hole , the @xmath101 exciton resembles the dipole active @xmath104 exciton , however , contrary to the latter this is a purely o @xmath9 hole .",
    "there are several examples of a qualitative assignement of low - lying optical spectral features to the non - bonding oxygen orbitals , appearing in cuo near 1.7 ev ( see ref . and in sr@xmath4cuo@xmath4cl@xmath4 near 2.5 ev ( see ref .  ) .",
    "also , it was shown that the dipole - allowed one - center electron - hole excitation @xmath105 is visible in the low lying part of the eels spectrum of sr@xmath4cuo@xmath4cl@xmath4 .",
    "@xcite however , to the best of our knowledge , there is at present no unambiguous identification of this one - center excitation ( and also of @xmath106 ) as well - separated entities in 2d insulating cuprates .",
    "that is different for 1d cuprates where these one - center excitations built up of non - bonding oxygen - orbitals could be separated in eels by choosing a momentum transfer perpendicular to the chain direction .",
    "@xcite the conventional one- and two - band hubbard - like models consider only the cu @xmath8 and o @xmath28 orbitals , and do not take into account the nonbonding o @xmath29 and o @xmath30 orbitals .",
    "partly , that may be justified by the specific properties of the @xmath107 ( @xmath40 ) ground state resulting in a predominant contribution of o @xmath28 orbitals both to the cu @xmath1 - o @xmath2 bonding and to the different charge transfer transitions . optical absorption and eels activity associated with the nonbonding o @xmath29 and o @xmath30 orbitals appear to be rather weak if any .",
    "electric dipole ct transitions for the hole localized in the cuo@xmath3 cluster are allowed from the even ground state @xmath108 to the bonding and antibonding purely oxygen odd @xmath89 states for the @xmath109 polarization , and to purely oxygen odd @xmath110 state for the @xmath111 one ( see fig.[fig1 ] ) .",
    "dipole transition matrix elements for the @xmath108 ground state depend essentially on the fact whether the final state is of o @xmath9 or o @xmath38 character . for the former case",
    "we have only a `` nonlocal overlap contribution '' with two - center integrals @xmath112 @xmath113 @xmath114 @xmath115 where @xmath116 , and @xmath117 @xmath118 that results in equal intensities for @xmath119 and @xmath120 transitions .",
    "naturally , that in a more common case we have orthogonalized wannier functions instead of simple atomic ones , and the calculation of the nonlocal overlap matrix elements is not so straightforward .",
    "for the @xmath121 dipole transitions to purely o @xmath38 state we have both nonlocal and local ( or `` covalent '' ) overlap contributions due to nonzero o @xmath38 density in the initial @xmath87 state @xmath122 @xmath123 @xmath124 where @xmath116 . it should be noted that namely the local term is the only contribution usually addressed for transition matrix elements .",
    "the bonding and antibonding @xmath89 states incorporate both o @xmath38 and o @xmath9 orbitals .",
    "therefore , the respective dipole transition matrix elements acquire a rather complex structure .",
    "however , for the `` covalent '' , and probably , the leading contribution , we obtain a simple relation @xmath125 in other words , the relative intensity of the two main electric - dipole transitions is mainly determined by the magnitude of @xmath65-hybridization and does not exceed 0.1 for the typical values of the parameters .    in some cases ,",
    "it is of practical interest to provide information concerning the allowed dipole transitions between excited states . in our case , these are , first of all , numerous transitions from or to @xmath41 states .",
    "for instance , the @xmath126 dipole allowed transition has a very large intensity due to a large local contribution to the matrix element : @xmath127 it should be noted that the rather simple model of a single cuo@xmath3 cluster allows already to predict both the energies and the relative intensities for such transitions .",
    "the intensity of an exciton is determined by the imaginary part of @xmath128 around a pole , and is given by @xmath129 where @xmath130 is the exciton wave function .",
    "@xcite within the long - wavelength approximation ( @xmath131 ) the eels selection rules are the same as in optics if we address the @xmath54 direction to be that of the electric field .",
    "for the one - center small @xmath132-excitons it is rather easy to obtain the angular @xmath11-dependence of the transition matrix elements in the small @xmath11-approximation : @xmath133 where @xmath134 is a linear superposition of spherical harmonics @xmath135 , which forms a basis of the irreducible representation @xmath132 of the @xmath57 point group .",
    "we make use of the familiar expansion @xmath136 restricting ourself to the first nonzero contribution with minimal @xmath137 .",
    "thus , for different @xmath132 one obtains : @xmath138 @xmath139 @xmath140 @xmath141 @xmath142 here , @xmath143 is the azimuthal angle of orientation for the @xmath54 vector . in general , among dipole inactive excitons for corner - sharing cuo@xmath3 plaquette systems the @xmath144 and @xmath102 ones are `` visible '' only along @xmath46 $ ] and @xmath36 $ ] directions , respectively ; the @xmath145 exciton is visible both along @xmath46 $ ] and @xmath36 $ ] directions , while the @xmath146 one does not manifest itself both along @xmath46 $ ] and @xmath36 $ ] directions .",
    "taking into account only the conventional local overlap ( `` covalent '' ) contribution to the transition matrix element one may obtain model expressions for @xmath147 suitable throughout the bz .",

    "the large value of @xmath311 leads to an higher intensity of the high energy ct exciton at the @xmath24-point in comparison to the low - energy one with an estimated energy separation between the two of @xmath312 ev .",

    "this value depends on the actual difference in the @xmath107 hole density distribution of ground and excited states .",

    "this channel is only governed by the oxygen contribution , due to the orthogonality of the cu @xmath322 and cu @xmath323 orbitals .",
    "a shorthand analysis of the @xmath11 dependence for the different matrix elements listed above in eqs .  ( [ tme])-([tme1 ] ) shows that the @xmath320-channel is `` silent '' both at the @xmath24-point and all along the @xmath288 direction . along the @xmath324 direction we deal with an unusual behavior of the appropriate @xmath240(@xmath325 ) and @xmath239(@xmath246 ) excitonic modes .",
    "going to the bz boundary , the intensity of the former mode increases while that of the latter one turns into zero both at @xmath24 and at @xmath326 with nonzero value in between .",

    "the main contribution to transition matrix elements is determined by the purely oxygen @xmath107 component of the final states .",
    "both these conclusions are of particular importance for the relative intensities in the @xmath327-channel .",
    "the doublet of transitions with final antibonding @xmath145 state is more intensive than the similar doublet with the final bonding @xmath87 state : its relative intensity could be estimated to be @xmath333 . for either doublet the strongest intensity is predicted for transitions with final @xmath63 state with estimated relative intensity to be @xmath334 .",
    "different theoretical estimations ( see above ) point to the predominantly @xmath335 structure of the lowest in energy @xmath329 term of the two - hole cuo@xmath162 center , whose separation from the ground state zr singlet is only about @xmath336 ev as observed in photoemission experiments @xcite for sr@xmath4cuo@xmath4cl@xmath4 .",
    "thus , one should expect rather moderate intensities for the appropriate excitonic mode . on the other hand",
    ", one might naturally expect a rather strong high - energy transition to the predominantly @xmath337 state .",
    "overall , the @xmath54 dependence of the transition matrix elements for the @xmath327-channel is rather typical for purely oxygen contributions : the dipole - allowed @xmath240 modes gradually loose their intensity up to zero going from the @xmath24-point to the bz boundary both in @xmath288 and @xmath324 directions , contrary to the dipole - forbidden @xmath239 modes , whose intensity rises by approaching the bz boundary .",
    "it should be noted that the relative energy position of the four ct excitations in the @xmath327-channel is determined by the @xmath338 and the @xmath339 separations , which are of the order @xmath340 and @xmath341 ev , respectively , as predicted by the above quantum - chemical cluster calculations .",
    "in contrast to one - center frenkel excitons , the motion of its two - center counterparts is more complicated .",
    "we addressed above the internal electron - hole motion resulting in @xmath342 splitting .",

    "such modes for the 2d lattice were addressed in the frames of the simple zn - model : @xcite these are rotations of the hole ( electron ) around the electron ( hole ) by @xmath343 and @xmath344 , and axial translations ( see fig .  [ fig4 ] ) .",
    "strictly speaking , zhang and ng in their simple model considered only the @xmath343 and @xmath344 rotation around the electron center with the respective transfer integrals @xmath345 and @xmath346 , and the axial translation accompanied by a @xmath343 rotation around the electron center with transfer integral @xmath347 .",
    "it is interesting to note that the @xmath343- and @xmath344-rotation of the hole around the electron corresponds to the 2nd nearest neighbor and 3rd nearest neighbor hopping of the hole cuo@xmath162 center which is coupled to a corresponding motion of the electron cuo@xmath161 center .",
    "this problem is closely related to the well - known problem of the zr - singlet being the ground state of the cuo@xmath162 center , moving in the lattice formed by the cuo@xmath348 centers .",

    "[ fig4 ] ) .",
    "the tetragonal symmetry of the 2d cuo@xmath4 layer leads to certain modifications of the results obtained above for excitons in the simple cu@xmath4o@xmath159 cluster .",

    "integral intensity of dipole - allowed transitions associated with one @xmath356 excitonic manifold for 2d system two times smaller than in 1d system .",
    "the @xmath342 splitting in 1d system is expected to be substantially smaller than in 2d systems .",
    "in addition , the @xmath342 dipole matrix elements in 1d system are expected to be as a minimum two times bigger than in 2d systems .",
    "both these quantities essentially determine the magnitude of the third order nonlinear susceptibility @xmath463 and a potential of the system as an optoelectronic material with high performance.@xcite hence , 1d systems should be more effective nonlinear systems as compared with 2d counterparts .",
    "experimental data for 1d sr@xmath4cuo@xmath5 and 2d sr@xmath4cuo@xmath4cl@xmath4 , and exact diagonalization technique on small clusters confirm this conclusion.@xcite",
    "by addressing the nature of the electron - hole excitations we should emphasize that a comparative analysis of the optical and eels spectra in cuprates with different dimensionality of the cuo@xmath3 network is extremely interesting and informative in many respects .",
    "in particular , the considerable general interest in comparing the different physical properties of the 0d , 1d and 2d members of the growing cuprate family is warmed up by challenging problems such as the low - dimensional aspect of electronic structure and high-@xmath15 superconductivity .",
    "the 0d cuprates imply a system with well isolated or weakly coupled cuo@xmath3 plaquettes .",
    "such a situation seems to be realized in cub@xmath4o@xmath3 which belongs to the class of noncentrosymmetric magnetically ordered materials for which the unusual coexistence of weak dzyaloshinskii - moriya type ferromagnetism and inhomogeneous ( incommensurate ) magnetic ordering attracts a lot of attention .",
    "cub@xmath4o@xmath3 crystallizes in the tetragonal space group @xmath464.@xcite the cu@xmath465 ions at 4b sites are surrounded by four oxygen atoms in planar quadratic coordination so that the local symmetry is @xmath466 .",
    "the cu@xmath465 ions at 8d sites occupy distorted octahedral positions with an exceptionally large separation of 3.069   from the two apical cu@xmath465 ions .",
    "its local symmetry is 2 .",
    "many insulating cuprates represent text - book low - dimensional model systems .",
    "the 1d corner - shared ordering of the cuo@xmath3 plaquettes is realized in insulating sr@xmath4cuo@xmath5 to be the best known model system for a spin-@xmath467 antiferromagnetic heisenberg chain and a very promising material for nonlinear optical devices .",
    "@xcite    one of the best representatives for an insulating layered 2d copper oxide might be the oxychloride sr@xmath4cuo@xmath4cl@xmath4 , which is iso - structural to the famous 214 system la@xmath4cuo@xmath3 but contrary to the latter has a single type both of copper and oxygen sites .",
    "the compound sr@xmath4cuo@xmath4cl@xmath4 is one of the most popular model system for the insulating phase of the high-@xmath15 cuprates and 2d spin-@xmath467 heisenberg antiferromagnets , and intensively studied both experimentally and theoretically . in this tetragonal antiferromagnet ( @xmath468 k ) with nearly ideal cuo@xmath4 planes there are chlorine atoms instead of apex oxygens with considerably larger cu - cl@xmath469 separation ( 2.86 ) than that of cu - o@xmath469 ( 2.42 ) in la@xmath4cuo@xmath3 .",
    "hence , in sr@xmath4cuo@xmath4cl@xmath4 one has the opportunity to examine the cuo@xmath4 plane states , both copper and oxygen , without the  parasitic  contribution of apex oxygens . at present",
    ", there are a rather large number of experimental data for sr@xmath4cuo@xmath4cl@xmath4 obtained with the help of optical spectroscopy , @xcite x - ray photoemission ( xps ) , @xcite ultraviolet photoemission ( ups ) , @xcite x - ray absorption spectroscopy , ( xas ) @xcite and angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy . @xcite    the 0d cuprates with isolated cuo@xmath3 plaquettes like bi@xmath4cuo@xmath3 , the corner - shared and edge - shared 1d chain cuprates like sr@xmath4cuo@xmath5 and li@xmath4cuo@xmath4 , respectively , as well as the 2d systems like sr@xmath4cuo@xmath4cl@xmath4 should reveal similar signatures of the one - center excitations .",
    "however , what concerns the two - center excitations , there appears a principal difference .",
    "naturally , in tetragonal 2d system of corner - shared cuo@xmath3 centers , the two - center excitations manifest itself equally both in @xmath470 and @xmath471 in - plane polarizations , while in 1d system of the corner - shared cuo@xmath3 centers they are visible in a similar manner only for `` longitudinal '' polarization when the electric field is parallel to the chain direction .",
    "for the electric field parallel to the cuo@xmath3 plane but perpendicular to the chain direction one might observe only @xmath71-like one - center excitations whose intensity is determined by the overlap contribution only .",
    "thus , by comparing the optical response for an idealized 1d chain system with two polarizations we could estimate the contribution of the @xmath69-like two - center excitations by simple subtraction of the two spectra . naturally , it would be an oversimplification to say that one can deduce the optical response for an idealized 2d plane by simple combination of the 1d spectra with different polarization .",
    "a correct extension of the chain data to predict the 2d response should also take into account the additional @xmath343-coupling of the two - center excitations already at the @xmath24-point and the more complex dispersion relations .",
    "nevertheless , a simple naive comparative analysis of the chain and plane optical responses could provide important semi - quantitative information on the relative contribution of one- and two - center excitons , their spectral positions , and the relative magnitudes of the overlap and covalent contributions to the dipole matrix elements .",
    "one should note the provisional nature of a certain dimensionality for real cuprates .",
    "even in the so - called 0d systems like cub@xmath4o@xmath3 , the cuo@xmath3 plaquettes are not really isolated . it might be surprising that among the best candidates for 0d cuprates concerning the optical response are such systems like li@xmath4cuo@xmath4 or cugeo@xmath5 .",
    "usually they are considered as 1d systems with edge - sharing cuo@xmath3 plaquettes according to their crystalline structure .",
    "for instance , at room temperature , cugeo@xmath5 belongs to the orthorhombic group d@xmath472 @xmath473 .",
    "the unit cell contains two edge - sharing strongly deformed cuo@xmath14 octahedra , with two types of cu - o bonds of 2.77 and 1.94  , forming one - dimensional antiferromagnetic cu - o chains along the c axis .",
    "however , since the cu - o - cu bond angle along the chain is almost @xmath343 , the transfer from one plaquette to its nearest neighbors is strongly suppressed for the in - plane states . thus , the in - plane charge excitations are localized within one plaquette and with respect to the electronic properties the cuo@xmath3 centers in these compounds can be addressed to be approximately isolated .",
    "@xcite this standpoint is fairly well confirmed in optical and eels data for li@xmath4cuo@xmath4 .",
    "@xcite in what concerns the perpendicular out - of - plane o @xmath30 orbitals these systems should be considered as typical 1d chain systems with o @xmath9 bonding .",
    "in addition , one should note the problem related to the different symmetry of the crystalline field for the cuo@xmath3 plaquettes in 0d and 2d systems as compared with 1d systems , and between edge - shared and corner - shared 1d systems .",
    "for instance , two inequivalent oxygen sites are clearly seen in the polarization - dependent o @xmath474 x - ray absorption spectra for the 1d cuprate sr@xmath4cuo@xmath5 .",
    "@xcite however , the energy separation is found to be as small as @xmath475 ev , whic is sufficiently smaller than values of the order @xmath476 ev , expected from predictions of the simple point - charge model , or lda calculations .",
    "@xcite this experimental finding evidences puzzlingly small non - tetragonal effects near the ground state for the cuo@xmath3 centers in the 1d cuprate sr@xmath4cuo@xmath5 and allows to make a comparative analysis of the localized excitations with those of the tetragonal 2d cuprate sr@xmath4cuo@xmath4cl@xmath4 .",
    "it seems that the internal cu - o covalent bond for a cuo@xmath3 plaquette provides the main contribution to its electronic structure .      before addressing the experimental eels data we would like to summarize shortly the main results of the model theory of one- and two - center ct excitons in 2d insulating cuprates .",

    "it is worth noting that for cuprates , as for many other strongly covalent oxides , the conventional division of optical transitions into crystal - field @xmath479 and ct @xmath483 transitions becomes questionable , since the @xmath484 transitions are accompanied by a strong @xmath483 and @xmath485 charge transfer .",
    "the low - energy absorption band is expected to be a result of strong electron - vibrational coupling which lifts the selection rules for certain transitions .",
    "\\iv ) the final @xmath64 and @xmath63 states are unstable with respect to the formation of jahn - teller ( or pseudo - jahn - teller ) centers with localization of the appropriate ct excitation .",
    "this effect is especially important for the @xmath486 excitation , because the predominant @xmath71 nature of the hole state results in small transfer integrals and a relatively large effective mass for the exciton .",
    "the localization is accompanied by the vibronic reduction of transition matrix elements .",
    "the high - energy @xmath63 exciton is expected to manifest significant intensity both in optical and eels spectra .",
    "\\i ) all the two - center excitons generated by the ct governed by the strongest @xmath69 bonds can be divided into three channels @xmath487 , respectively , in accordance with the symmetry of the final two - hole state .",
    "the main effects in optics and eels are associated with the @xmath173- and @xmath167-channels . in the frame of each channel",
    "we deal with different final two - hole states whose energy and wave functions are mainly determined by correlations , or configuration interaction effects .",
    "the different theoretical model calculations predict the lowest energy of two - center ct transition for the @xmath173-channel to be of the order @xmath16 ev .",

    "these excitons generate two sets of four @xmath488 plane modes ( @xmath489 modes ) .",
    "@xcite    \\iii ) the transition matrix elements in optics and eels have rather complicated @xmath11 dependence , substantially differing for the oxygen and copper contributions .",
    "the simple dipole approximation fails to explain correctly the @xmath11-dependent effects in eels .",
    "\\iv ) in frame of the @xmath173-channel we predict two most important excitons with an energy separation @xmath490 ev .",
    "the low - energy exciton with zr - singlet as a final hole state has rather unusual @xmath11 dependence of intensity along the @xmath491 direction with a sharp decrease , or even compensation point , by going to the bz boundary .",
    "the high - energy exciton with final zr - singlet - like @xmath492 state of predominantly o 2@xmath180 nature is likely to manifest the largest intensity for the @xmath173-channel .",
    "\\v ) in frame of the @xmath167-channel we predict four most important excitons , generated by ct to @xmath64 and @xmath63 orbitals with smaller and larger weight of o 2@xmath493 orbitals , respectively .",
    "these weights determine the relative intensities of the appropriate excitons .",
    "the photoemission data @xcite predict the energy separation between the low - lying @xmath486 and @xmath210 transitions to be of the order @xmath336 ev . the @xmath167 excitons manifest a rather simple dispersion of intensity along both main directions in bz zone with gradual interchange between dipole allowed and forbidden modes .",
    "all parent 1d and 2d copper oxides with corner - shared cuo@xmath3 plaquettes are antiferromagnets with spin-@xmath467 , localized on cu atoms of the chains or planes , with exchange integral @xmath494 ev and a nel temperature @xmath495 k in 2d .",
    "so , we have to address the excitons in antiferromagnets .",
    "historically , this problem has been intensively studied in connection with forbidden @xmath479 excitonic transitions in weakly covalent antiferromagnetic insulators like mnf@xmath4 ( see e.g. the paper by tanabe and aoyagi in ref .  ) . at first glance ,",
    "the main allowed electric dipole transitions preserve the spin state and can not result in conventional or orientational spin fluctuations .",
    "on the other hand , the charge transfer transitions are accompanied by a strong spatial redistribution of spin density , and , in a sense , result in a spin density fluctuations .",
    "indeed , the two - center ct exciton is formally associated with spin singlet - singlet transition from a spin - singlet initial state with a @xmath496 spin density on both centers to a spin - singlet final state with a @xmath497 spin density on both centers . in a sense , this transition is accompanied by a local annihilation of the nel - like or spin - dimerized state , and the creation of a non - magnetic vacancy .",
    "such a strong spin density fluctuation could result in effective two - magnon ( 2 m ) processes .",
    "in other words , one might expect strong 2 m raman scattering generated by a two - center exciton .",
    "indeed , the experimental raman measurements for different insulating cuprates @xcite show that the maximal strength of 2 m scattering occurs for excitation energies substantially higher than the optical band edge with a peak which we assign to a two - center exciton .    for small one - center excitons",
    "we have a rather conventional @xmath498 transition with spin density fluctuation localized inside the cuo@xmath3 plaquette .",
    "such a transition is not accompanied by strong 2 m raman processes , what could be used to identify such kind of excitons .",
    "the redistribution of spin density from the copper atom to the oxygen ones for the @xmath499 transition switches on the strong ferromagnetic heisenberg o @xmath2-cu @xmath1 exchange with the nearest neighbor cuo@xmath13 plaquettes .",
    "interestingly , the different sign of exchange coupling for @xmath41 and @xmath107 holes with the same neighborhood , ferromagnetic for the former , and antiferromagnetic for the latter , leads to a number of temperature anomalies near the 2d-3d antiferromagnetic phase transition .",
    "there is at first the @xmath500 shift effect for the energy of the small one - center exciton @xmath501 by lowering the temperature near and below @xmath502 .",
    "indeed , at @xmath503 , the average molecular field for the cuo@xmath3 center turns to zero .",
    "the 3d antiferromagnetic ordering is accompanied by a rise of exchange molecular fields and respective spin splittings . due to the different signs of molecular fields for @xmath41 and @xmath107 states",
    "this is accompanied by an increase of the transition energy with maximal value of @xmath500 shift @xmath504 .",
    "this quantity could be as large as several tenths of ev .",
    "additionally , one has to expect a strong ( of the same order of magnitude ) broadening of the excitonic line with increase of the temperature due to strong fluctuations of molecular fields .",
    "all these expectations are experimentally found for the @xmath505 ev line in sr@xmath4cuo@xmath4cl@xmath4 @xcite confirming its one - center excitonic nature .",
    "a similar situation is observed in la@xmath4cuo@xmath3,@xcite although the authors have explained the data by assuming a polaronic nature of electrons and holes with a short - range interaction in between .",
    "it should be noted that at present there is no relevant theory of spin - excitonic coupling for small ct excitons in strongly covalent and correlated systems .",
    "the traditional framework for understanding the two - magnon raman scattering in antiferromagnets for non - resonant excitation energies has been an effective loudon - fleury hamiltonian,@xcite which implies well localized spins and weak spin - wave like spin fluctuations .",
    "generally speaking , the ct exciton creation is usually accompanied by an excitation of lattice modes .",
    "indeed , the hole transfer from cu @xmath1 to o @xmath2 state , or from an @xmath506 to a @xmath507 configuration is accompanied by a significant shortening of the equilibrium cu - o bond length .",
    "the exciton - phonon interaction strongly influences the line - shape of absorption and results in a phonon raman scattering .",
    "the measurement of the raman intensity as a function of excitation light energy is a very informative probe of the origin of electronic transitions.@xcite in particular , this method has allowed @xcite to resolve a fine structure of the low - energy ( le ) excitonic feature in la@xmath4cuo@xmath3 with a sharp peak at @xmath508 ev as narrow as 50 mev and a broader structure at @xmath509 ev .",
    "in addition , the authors made the important observation of the selective resonance enhancement , namely that neither the first - order even - parity phonon nor their harmonics show resonant enhancement near the le exciton peak , while the high - energy ( above 450 @xmath510 ) presumably odd raman modes show large resonant enhancement of as much as a factor of @xmath511 relative to a laser energy of @xmath512 ev .",
    "similar results have been obtained for insulating yba@xmath4cu@xmath5o@xmath513.@xcite in our opinion , such an unusual behavior of the le exciton could be associated with its jahn - teller nature . indeed , the @xmath52 transition to the orbital doublet @xmath41 represents a textbook example of a so - called @xmath514 transition.@xcite the excited , orbitally degenerate @xmath41 state is unstable with regard to vibronic coupling with the local distortion modes @xmath515 , @xmath37 and the formation of a polaron - like ( soliton - like ) vibronic center with a complex two- or four - well adiabatic potential and a rather strong renormalization of vibration frequencies .",
    "in other words , the doublet @xmath41 state tends to a spontaneous local symmetry breaking , including removal of the inversion center due to interaction with the close in energy even states and pseudo - jahn - teller effect .",
    "namely the latter would result in a strong resonance coupling of the @xmath516 exciton with odd @xmath37 lattice modes .",
    "naturally , the structure of such a center would strongly depend on differences in the bare lattice and elastic parameters and differ in 214 and 123 systems .",

    "we usually deal with spectra being a hardly resolved superposition of both types of excitons .",

    "unfortunately , this concerns also the structure of the low - energy optical response observed in the spectral range @xmath16 ev , which is of special importance since it is associated with the states which are believed to define the unconventional properties of the cuprates .",
    "one should emphasize that conventional optical measurements are restricted only to the @xmath24-point and can not separate between localized one - center , dispersionless excitations and two - center excitons with a noticeable dispersion .",
    "in contrast to optics , the angle - resolved eels spectroscopy provides unique opportunities to reveal the exciton dispersion and separate one- and two - center ct excitons .",

    "their comparison leads to very important conclusions . as is to be expected ,",
    "we see a strong difference between the two sets of spectra .",
    "first , this concerns the well - defined dispersionless eels peaks at 2.0 and 5.5 ev in transversal polarization ( right hand side panel in fig.[fig7 ] ) . the intensity considerations and the absence of noticeable energy dispersion",
    "allow us to associate them with dipole - allowed ct transitions having a particularly localized nature .",
    "moreover , when comparing both spectra we see that despite the strong inequivalence of longitudinal and transversal polarizations in sr@xmath4cuo@xmath5 the low - energy transition peaked near 2 ev is equally present in both polarizations .",
    "though for longitudinal polarization this is partly hidden for low momentum values by the intensive band peaked at 2.6 ev and is seen as a shoulder , near the bz boundary it is a well - separated weak band due to the big blue - shift of the intense neighbor .",
    "this fact implies that the excitation is localized on the single cuo@xmath3 plaquette being the only common element of longitudinal and transversal geometry in this 1d cuprate with corner - shared cuo@xmath3 plaquettes .",
    "hence , by taking into account the intensity ratio we can unambiguously identify the 2.0 and 5.5 ev peaks in the eels spectrum of sr@xmath4cuo@xmath5 with the one - center ct excitons @xmath64 and @xmath63 , respectively .",
    "the sizeable dispersion of the most intense low - lying ct exciton peaked in eels at 2.6 ev agrees with its two - center nature @xcite that is fairly well confirmed in the studies of nonlinear optical effects in sr@xmath4cuo@xmath5 .",
    "@xcite indeed , our analysis of the photoinduced absorption experiments and the measurements of the third - order nonlinear susceptibility @xmath536 in sr@xmath4cuo@xmath5 @xcite allows to reveal the near - degeneracy of both @xmath239- and @xmath240-types of two - center ct excitons with an energy of about 2.0 ev , and to obtain a reliable estimate for the transition matrix element ( [ me ] ) : @xmath537   ( see fig .  4 in ref .  ) , that straightforwardly points to a two - center ct exciton .",
    "in addition , the nonlinear optical response of sr@xmath4cuo@xmath5 @xcite reveals a weak spectral feature red - shifted to several tenths of ev with regard to the position of the main two - center exciton .",
    "it can be attributed to a weak one - center exciton that seems yet to be @xmath538 in reflectivity measurements of sr@xmath4cuo@xmath5 .",
    "@xcite in this connection , we would like to emphasize once more the decisive role of @xmath26 eels measurements in the observation and unambiguous assignment of one- and two - center excitons in sr@xmath4cuo@xmath5 as compared with conventional @xmath22 optical data .",
    "it is interesting to note that a low - energy transition with small dispersion was also seen in the rixs data of the 1d cuprate srcuo@xmath4 published in ref .  .",
    "in that paper it was interpreted as the onset of the continuum of the one - band hubbard model . by comparing it with the above discussion of the eels data of sr@xmath4cuo@xmath5",
    "we are led to an alternative interpretation of these rixs data in terms of a superposition of two different electron - hole excitations , namely the above discussed one- and two - center excitons .      at first sight , all the above findings",
    "are restricted to 1d cuprates .",
    "however , already a shorthand inspection of the high - resolution eels spectra for the 2d system sr@xmath4cuo@xmath4cl@xmath4 for two polarizations @xcite shows nearly the same behavior of the lowest in energy electron - hole excitations .",
    "being encouraged by such an impressive success of our model we can now address the detailed analysis of ct excitons in 2d insulating cuprates .",
    "as it was already noted , sr@xmath4cuo@xmath4cl@xmath4 is one of the best realizations of a 2d antiferromagnetic , insulating model compound .",
    "of particular importance for the assignment of both one- and two - center excitons are data obtained by arpes which is a powerful tool to examine the energy spectrum of the two - hole cuo@xmath162 center .",

    "the selection rules for arpes are the same as for optical and eels transition , so that arpes `` sees '' only the purely oxygen @xmath41 photoholes , or the @xmath329 states of the two - hole cuo@xmath162 center with @xmath330-like configuration .",
    "the inspection of the experimental arpes spectra for sr@xmath12cuo@xmath12cl@xmath12 obtained in refs .",

    "different theoretical estimations @xcite corroborate the arpes data and point to a rather low - energy position of the o @xmath29 states in 1d and 2d cuprates with a corner shared arrangement of cuo@xmath3 plaquettes with @xmath540 ev , where @xmath541 and @xmath542 are the centers of gravity for different o @xmath28 and o @xmath29 states , respectively .    unfortunately , the measurements in ref .",

    "all this shows that important spectral information is contained in the range above 8 ev .",
    "the peak at about 18 ev is likely to be attributed to transitions with o @xmath373 initial state .",
    "the interpretation of eels spectra for nonzero momentum becomes more complicated due to the energy and intensity dispersion of the dipole - allowed modes and the appearance of numerous new modes which are forbidden at the @xmath24-point .",

    "one of the first quantitative conclusions on a competitive role of the hybrid copper - oxygen @xmath605 orbital and purely oxygen o @xmath29 orbitals in the formation of valence states near the fermi level in the cuo@xmath4 planes has been made by a.k .",
    "_ @xcite and j. tanaka _ et al . _",
    "@xcite namely these orbitals , as they state , define the low - energy physics of copper oxides .",
    "insulating 2d cuprates like sr@xmath4cuo@xmath4cl@xmath4 are not molecular crystals , and making use of the small exciton approach inevitably leads to problems with strong excitonic overlap and mixing , and manifestation of band - like effects owing to electron - hole pair decoupling .",
    "nevertheless , we suppose that the strong electron - lattice polarization effects @xcite for ct states may provide an effective localization of ct excitons .",
    "so , the small exciton model turns out to be a good and instructive approximation to describe optical and eels spectra in different insulating cuprates with cuo@xmath3 plaquettes . in this connection",
    ", we would like to emphasize the specific role played by the ground state of the cuprate in the formation of optical and eels response .",
    "for a strongly correlated ground state the main part of the optical and eels response intensity is determined by the excitonic sector , while for a band - like weakly correlated ground state it is the sector of unbound electron - hole pairs . moreover , in the case of the strongly - correlated insulating cuprates it seems misleading to search for separate contributions of excitons and electron - hole continuum .",
    "@xcite    concluding , it should be noted that the quantum - chemical cuo@xmath3 cluster model represents a physically clear albeit rather simplified approach to consider electron - hole excitations .",
    "however , it seems that such an approach allows to catch the essential physics of the charge transfer transitions , and should be a necessary step both in the qualitative and semi - quantitative description of insulating cuprates .",

    "<S> a semi - quantitative cluster approach is developed to describe the charge transfer ( ct ) electron - hole excitations in insulating cuprates in a rather wide energy range up to @xmath0 ev . </S>",
