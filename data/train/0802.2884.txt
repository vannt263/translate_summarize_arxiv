    "life is dependent upon biomolecular spatial asymmetry .",
    "even though the origin of this asymmetry remains unknown @xcite , it is frequently argued that life could neither exist nor originate without molecular chirality @xcite . under this view",
    ", the question of the origin of homochirality is intrinsic to that of the origin of life : if we want to understand how life first emerged on earth ( or possibly elsewhere ) , we must understand how homochirality emerges from basic chiral building blocks ( enantiomers ) .",
    "the mystery here may not be so much _ which _ chirality but _ why _ chirality : although the sugars found in dna and rna are right - handed and protein amino acids are left - handed , laboratory syntheses yield racemic mixtures @xcite .",
    "a pertinent exception is the reaction studied by soai and coworkers , which demonstrates bifurcation to a single handedness @xcite .",
    "although the soai reaction has probably little relevance to life on early earth , it exhibits the features required of a successful model : autocatalysis and enantiomeric cross - inhibition fed by enzymatic enhancement .",
    "inspired by frank s pioneering work @xcite , sandars recently proposed an autocatalytic model including enantiomeric cross - inhibition @xcite .",
    "sandars model has been further investigated in work by brandenburg and collaborators @xcite , wattis and coveney @xcite , and gleiser and thorarinson @xcite .",
    "one of the model s shortcomings is that enantiomeric feedback is generated by the longest polymer chain in the model .",
    "this requires somewhat unrealistic initial conditions , as they must include initial asymmetric concentrations of the maximum length polymers with no intermediate length polymers present in the reactor pool ( _ i.e. _ , requiring the presence of @xmath10 and @xmath11 with some asymmetry and not requiring the presence of @xmath12 or @xmath13 for @xmath14 ) . in a more realistic bottom - up approach",
    ", initial conditions should depend only on the substrate and possibly on a very small asymmetry between the two types of monomers , perhaps caused by random fluctuations in concentration @xcite . at an even more basic level , one might desire the system to start with no polymers , monomers , and even no substantial concentrations of substrate , so long as autogenic production of monomers is active .",
    "such non - catalytic production terms for monomers of both chiralities were briefly discussed by wattis and coveney @xcite , saito and hyuga @xcite , and by brandenburg _",
    "@xcite but have not yet been thoroughly explored .    in the present work ,",
    "we extend sandars model by allowing for spontaneous monomer production from the substrate and for spatial dependence of the concentrations .",
    "we study in detail the spatiotemporal dynamics of the reaction network for several values of maximum polymer length @xmath2 , including the @xmath4 limit . for the @xmath3 ( or reduced ) model",
    ", we investigate the validity of the adiabatic approximations employed by brandenburg and multamki @xcite , gleiser and thorarinson @xcite , and by gleiser @xcite .",
    "we show that the introduction of autogenic monomer production influences the evolution of the net chirality by inducing a chiral symmetry - breaking phase transition . for models with @xmath15",
    ", we obtain the net chirality as a function of @xmath2 , showing that it is sensitive to the autogenic reaction rates , @xmath16 , for left ( right)-handed monomers . for symmetric autogenic reactions , ( @xmath17 )",

    "the key features of autocatalysis , enantiomeric cross - inhibition , and enzymatic enhancement are discussed . in section [ reducedmodel ] , _ the reduced model _ , we describe the reduced ( @xmath3 ) model and the interpretation of the net chirality as an order parameter satisfying an effective potential .",
    "we also test the validity of the adiabatic approximations and describe the dynamics of a chiral symmetry - breaking transition . in section [ highn ] ,",
    "_ the @xmath18 model _ , we investigate the limit @xmath18 .",
    "for symmetric autogenic reactions , we obtain the phase diagram for the net chirality as a function of @xmath19 , showing that above a critical value @xmath7 homochirality is unattainable .",
    "we also compute the average polymer length as a function of @xmath19 , showing that as @xmath20 , large chiral chains are strongly suppressed .",
    "we then examine the spatiotemporal dynamics for several models with @xmath21 and @xmath18 in section [ cp ] , _ numerical results : maximum polymer length and chiral asymmetry_. we obtain an expression for the net chirality as a function of maximum polymer length @xmath2 as @xmath19 varies .",
    "we also demonstrate that larger polymers achieve higher chiral purity . in section [ end ] , _",
    "conclusion _ , we present a brief summary of our results .",
    "sandars @xcite proposed a model for prebiotic homochirality whereby homochiral polymers evolve from a gradual build up of chiral monomers .",
    "the model includes the key features for chiral amplification , enantiomeric cross - inhibition and enzymatic enhancement . in this section",
    ", we will present our generalization of sandar s model , and discuss how it compares with other models proposed recently in the literature . given",
    "that little is known of the specifics of prebiotic chemistry , it is important to examine the effects of plausible features expected to be present in realistic models .      consider a chirally pure chain of @xmath22 left - handed monomers , @xmath12 .",
    "it can grow on either end by addition of a left or right - handed monomer , @xmath23 or @xmath24 , with rate coefficients @xmath25 and @xmath26 , respectively .",
    "the attachment of the `` wrong '' monomer , in this case a right - handed monomer , inhibits that end of the polymer from further growth .",
    "this process is referred to as enantiomeric cross - inhibition : addition of a monomer of the opposite chirality to one end of a growing chain terminates further growth on that end of the chain @xcite .",
    "the reaction network may be written as    @xmath27    supplemented by the complementary reactions obtained by exchanging @xmath28 .",
    "in addition , the reaction network includes a substrate @xmath29 from which monomers of both chiralities are generated .",
    "the substrate may generate monomers spontaneously or through enzymatic enhancement by already existing polymers .",
    "the rate equations governing these processes are @xmath30 where @xmath0 and @xmath1 are the rate coefficients for direct ( autogenic or non - catalytic ) production of monomers from the substrate , @xmath31 is the rate coefficient for enantiomeric feedback , @xmath32(@xmath33 ) denote the enzymatic enhancement of left(right)-handed monomers , and the coefficients @xmath34 and @xmath35 are given by , @xmath36 and @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the fidelity of the enzymatic reactions .",
    "note that for complete fidelity ( @xmath39 ) , @xmath40 , and the two rightmost processes in eq .",
    "[ rxnnetwork1 ] do not occur .    for simplicity ,",
    "sandars chose @xmath41 and @xmath42 , where @xmath2 is the maximum polymer length .",
    "however , given that the exact functional dependence is not known , alternative suggestions have been made , such as @xmath43 and @xmath44 @xcite ( henceforth wc and bahn , respectively ) . here , we allow for polymers of all lengths to participate equally in the autocatalytic feedback and choose @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "in contrast to the case where the enzymatic enhancement is dependent only on the longest @xmath2-length polymers , this choice allows homochiral polymers of all lengths to participate in the autocatalytic feedback and removes any dependence on the specific cutoff value of @xmath2 .",
    "this choice also allows the network to start with initial conditions which do not require the artificial presence of small , left - right asymmetric concentrations of the highest order polymer , a limitation of sandar s model . in",
    "a bottom - up approach , long chains should be products of a gradual build - up : it is unlikely that they would be present _",
    "ab initio_.    the rate coefficients @xmath0 and @xmath1 describe the production of monomers from substrate without the need for catalytic feedback .",
    "given that little is known of the details of prebiotic chemistry , it is important to consider the effects of such terms on the reaction kinetics .",
    "furthermore , chiral monomers could also have been fed to the early earth environment from outer - space , as supported from findings of chiral amino acids in , _",
    "e.g. _ , the murchinson meteorite @xcite .",
    "similar terms have previously been introduced by wc , saito and hyuga @xcite ( henceforth sh ) , and by bahn , although wc and sh did not allow for biased production . in the model of wc , a single non - catalytic production term @xmath47 is introduced .",
    "wc consider only @xmath48 to allow for simplified initial conditions ( _ i.e. _ , starting with no substrate , monomers , or polymers present but with a continuous source term for the substrate ) and did not study the effect of this term on the dynamics of the model or its equilibrium solutions , as we do here .",
    "bahn introduced the non - catalytic production terms @xmath49 and @xmath50 . comparing to our model",
    ", one finds @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "bahn found that the introduction of finite @xmath49 or @xmath50 with @xmath53 leads to imperfect but still efficient bifurcation in the feedback fidelity and to the absence of a racemic equilibrium solution .",
    "these authors suggest that homochirality is primarily the result of the instability of the racemic solutions which is barely modified by the presence of finite @xmath49 or @xmath50 . as a consequence ,",
    "most of bahn s work assumed @xmath54 . here , we find that even in the case @xmath55 , the presence of these terms can , in fact , influence the instability of the racemic solutions : for @xmath56 , homochirality is impossible ( as will be discussed , @xmath57 is a critical value which varies with maximum polymer length ) .",
    "a similar conclusion was reached by sh , who studied autocatalytic reactions in a simplified system with two chiral species .",
    "sh found that random production of chiral molecules from non - catalytic processes must occur to generate initial concentrations of chiral products and that there exists a critical value for the non - catalytic production rate : above the critical value , the system can obtain only fractional homochirality .",
    "we arrive at a qualitatively stronger conclusion : @xmath57 varies with the maximum length of polymers allowed in the model , @xmath2 , and the net chirality for a given @xmath6 increases with increasing @xmath2 .",
    "gleiser @xcite investigated the case where the bias originated in the enantiomeric enhancement terms through the definitions @xmath58c_l$ ] and @xmath59c_r$ ] , where @xmath60 .",
    "exploring the efficacy of both intrinsic and extrinsic influences through the parameter @xmath61 , it was found that in the diffusive regime only a fairly large bias ( @xmath62 ) could influence the evolution of reasonably - sized reactor pools toward homochirality in early earth . in this regime ,",
    "small sources of chiral symmetry breaking , such as parity violation in the weak interactions where @xmath63@xcite , were ruled out .    with the above processes of deriving monomers ( both non - catalytically and through enzymatic enhancement ) present in the model ,",
    "it is possible to start from racemic initial conditions and , through chiral amplification , arrive at a homochiral final state .",
    "one can imagine initially having zero concentrations of polymers , monomers , and substrate with the substrate being added continuously to the system starting at @xmath64 . as pointed out by wc , if @xmath65 no monomers are produced and polymerization is never initiated .",
    "( models without autogenic production usually start with an unrealistic nonzero concentration of large polymers . )",
    "we therefore require the presence of non - zero autogenic production terms , @xmath0 and @xmath1 , to produce the initial concentrations of monomers .",
    "in essence , they jump - start the reaction network .",
    "there are two ways in which homochirality may be achieved once there is a nonzero concentration of substrate and possibly minute initial concentrations of monomers .",
    "if an explicit bias is introduced such that @xmath66 , the system requires an initial concentration of only the substrate in order for chiral amplification toward the favored chirality to occur .",
    "if @xmath67 , a small bias must be introduced between the initial concentrations of left and right - handed monomers .",
    "the needed asymmetry may be the result of random fluctuations in concentrations of large numbers of molecules @xcite , or it may be due to environmental disturbances @xcite .",

    "the potential has fixed points at @xmath123 and @xmath124 .",
    "the point @xmath125 describes the racemic solution and is unstable when the chiral fixed points at @xmath124 are real .",
    "the enantiomeric excess is given by @xmath126 clearly , an enantiomeric excess is possible only for @xmath127 , and complete homochirality ( @xmath128 ) occurs only for @xmath129 . for @xmath130",
    "a racemate ( @xmath125 ) is the only stable solution .",
    "we see that @xmath131 plays a similar quantitative role as the temperature in systems in the ising universality class @xcite .",
    "we will further explore this analogy below .",
    "as discussed previously , bahn found that in cases with an asymmetry between non - catalytic production terms , there is no longer a perfectly racemic stable solution . for @xmath132(@xmath133 ) large enough , the left(right)-handed chirality invariably will achieve dominance ( _ cf . _ figure [ fig : potential ] right ) .",
    "for the @xmath3 truncated model , the asymmetry between @xmath132 and @xmath133 plays a similar qualitative role to the biasing parameter @xmath61 introduced by gleiser @xcite .",

    "consider a temporally varying parameter @xmath134 .",
    "one can imagine this to occur with a change in temperature , pressure , or concentration of reactants as the system evolves .",
    "starting with a large @xmath131 , for instance @xmath138 , the production rate of monomers of both chiralities is relatively high ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath139 , holding @xmath25 fixed ) .",
    "as @xmath131 decreases , the rate of direct production of monomers from the substrate slows , and enantiomeric feedback , governed by the reaction rate @xmath31 , becomes the dominant mechanism for formation of monomers ( _ i.e. _ , when @xmath140 ) . as studied extensively in previous work @xcite ,",
    "enantiomeric feedback is the driving force that leads to eventual chiral bifurcation .",
    "thus _ the critical point in this model occurs when the dominant mechanism for monomer formation switches from autogenic production from the substrate to enantiomeric feedback_. the transition occurs at @xmath141 ( @xmath142 for the symmetric potential in figure [ fig : potential ] ) and complete chiral separation occurs as @xmath143 .    in this scenario ,",
    "as @xmath134 passes through @xmath144 , the system undergoes a phase transition from a racemic state to a chiral state .",
    "one can think in analogy with a ferromagnet : as it is cooled through the curie point , it settles into one of the two degenerate ground states ( magnetization directions ) .",
    "the choice is determined by fluctuations about equilibrium . in the absence of an external magnetic field ( the biasing factor , here equivalent to choosing @xmath145 ) , the choice is random ; there is an equal probability that either ground state will be chosen .",
    "the net chirality plays the role of the net magnetization and we observe domains of both chiralities emerge as @xmath131 is lowered through @xmath144 .    if one then considers the parameter @xmath131 to be both spatially and temporally dependent , @xmath146  a realistic possibility given that , in general , the temperature , pressure , or concentrations are likely to be inhomogeneous in early planetary environments  the phase transition can occur at different places at different times .",
    "for example , if @xmath131 is dependent on temperature , then @xmath147 will be nonuniform , as the temperature itself may be a function of space and time ( @xmath148 ) . in this case , the phase transition may not occur everywhere at once and chirality will not be uniform throughout space .",
    "chiral domains will then compete for dominance as discussed in gleiser @xcite .",
    "the formation of chiral domains for a model phase transition will be illustrated below in the context of the full @xmath3 model .",
    "for the remainder of this work we assume @xmath155 ( @xmath156 ) : the rates of attachment of a monomer of the same or opposite chirality are equal , and these rates are in turn equal to the rate of catalytic production of monomers from the substrate by enantiomeric feedback .",
    "the other relevant rates that appear in our reaction network , @xmath0 and @xmath1 , which describe non - catalytic monomer production , should be much slower @xcite .",
    "for example , wc chose @xmath157 . to show that the condition @xmath48 is satisfied , we use the nominal values of @xmath158@xmath159s@xmath160 and @xmath161@xmath162s@xmath160 with @xmath163 to find @xmath164 noting that @xmath131 should be dimensionless , we obtain @xmath165 for @xmath166 .      in the previous subsections we introduced the @xmath3 model with and without adiabatic approximations . since the adiabatic approximations have been used in several models @xcite , it is important to test their validity . in figure",

    "[ fig : n2compare ] , we see that the asymptotic solutions of both models are , indeed , equal ( @xmath171 ) : not surprisingly , the difference between the two models is in the equilibration time - scales , which are considerably faster within the adiabatic approximation .",
    "we can therefore conclude that the adiabatic approximation is valid on long dynamical timescales .",
    "one can also verify analytically that @xmath144 is the same for both models : both the adiabatic and non - adiabatic models will undergo a phase transition for the same values of the relevant parameters , @xmath31 , @xmath19 , and @xmath25 .",
    "( the phase diagram for the full @xmath3 model is shown in figure [ fig : thetaninf ] ) .",
    "spatial inhomogeneities in the concentrations of the many reactants will have a strong impact on the evolution of chirality . as we remarked earlier ,",
    "the analogy with ferromagnets suggests that spatially extended domains of opposite chirality will form and compete for dominance @xcite . in what follows",
    ", we will introduce spatial dependence to the full @xmath3 model , and study its time evolution as the production rate of monomers from the substrate decreases in time .",
    "the advantage of imposing the adiabatic approximation to the @xmath3 model is most obvious once spatial dependence is introduced : the system is elegantly reduced to an effective scalar field theory where the field determines the net chirality in a given volume @xcite , playing the same role as the magnetization in an ising ferromagnet .",
    "however , as we demonstrated in the previous subsection ( see figure [ fig : n2compare ] ) , the adiabatic approximation changes the effective equilibration time - scale , thus affecting the overall evolution of the reaction network .",
