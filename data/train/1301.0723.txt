    "in classical general relativity , a black hole ( bh ) is absolutely black : it does not emit any radiation . the situation changes , however , when quantum effects are taken into account . the semiclassical extension of general relativity considers quantum fields which live on the background of a well - defined classical geometry ( e.g. a black - hole ) . within this framework",
    "it was found @xcite that a black hole actually has a finite temperature , the _ hawking temperature _ @xmath3 .",
    "accordingly the bh emits thermal radiation , and evaporates within a finite time .    hawking s analysis",
    "@xcite revealed that the temperature of the semiclassical bh is @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the _ surface gravity _ of the bh . throughout this paper",
    "we use general - relativistic units @xmath6 ( and the same for the boltzmann constant ) , and we also set @xmath7 ( following ref .",
    "dimensions ) setting @xmath8 merely amounts to a choice of units .",
    "however in two dimensions this is not the case , because @xmath9 becomes dimensionless . thus setting @xmath7 here",
    "is an arbitrary choice .",
    "] the temperature @xmath3 is thus uniquely determined by the background bh geometry . for a 4-dimensional",
    "( 4d ) schwarzschild bh of mass @xmath0 the surface gravity is @xmath10 , hence @xmath11 .    in the semiclassical theory ,",
    "the quantum field yields an energy - momentum contribution @xmath12 , to be inserted at the right - hand side of the semiclassical einstein equation @xmath13 .",

    "@xmath12 is a tensor field in spacetime , which depends on the spacetime geometry ( as well as on the quantum state of the matter field under consideration ) .",
    "the hawking radiation is the most obvious manifestation of this semiclassical @xmath12 : it is the outging component of @xmath12 , evaluated at future null infinity ( fni ) . but",
    "obviously @xmath12 includes other components as well , and is also position - dependent .",
    "for example , an evaporating bh must be endowed with a negative ingoing component of @xmath14 at the horizon : it is this ingoing component which is directly responsible for the steady decrease of the bh mass .",
    "the classical schwarzschild solution is a vacuum solution of the einstein equation .",
    "obviously , the semiclassical contribution @xmath12 must modify the bh geometry , which will no longer be a pure vacuum solution .",
    "instead , the bh metric @xmath15 is to be determined now from the semiclassical einstein equation @xmath13 .    since in a semiclassical bh @xmath15 is no longer the schwarzschild geometry , the bh s surface gravity will deviate from its classical value @xmath10 .",
    "this deviation is small for a macroscpic bh ( namely , @xmath16 , where @xmath17 denotes the planck mass ) , and is expected to decrease @xmath18with increasing @xmath0 .",
    "this change in @xmath5 yields a corresponding change in the bh temperature and outflux .",
    "the main objective of this paper is to explore this ( mass - dependent ) change in the temperature and outflux of a semiclassical bh , caused by the deviation of the background geometry from the classical one .",
    "( though , we shall actually tackle this problem in two rather than four spacetime dimensions , for reasons which we shortly explian . )",
    "presently there is no known explicit expression for the renormalized stress - energy tensor @xmath12 in 4d ( even for spherically - symmetric spacetimes ) .",
    "this makes it hard to construct the semiclassical bh geometry and evaluate its surface gravity .",
    "fortunately the situation is much simpler in the two - dimensional ( 2d ) framework , wherein @xmath12 is explicitly known for a generic background metric .",
    "this motivates us to address this issue  the mass - dependent semiclassical correction to the hawking temperature and outflux  in the 2d framework .",
    "about two decades ago callan , giddings , harvey and strominger ( cghs ) @xcite introduced a formalism of 2d dilaton gravity in which the metric is coupled to a dilaton field @xmath19 and to a large number @xmath20 of identical massless scalar fields . in this 2d framework @xmath12",
    "is known explicitly , allowing one to translate semiclassical dynamics into a closed system of partial differential equations ( pdes ) @xcite .",
    "although the exact solution to these pdes is not known explicitly , it is possible to explore these solutions numerically , and also through certain analytical approximations ( see below ) @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to explore _ static _",
    "bh solutions @xcite of the 2d semiclassical cghs model , and to find out how the surface gravity ( and hence also temperature and outflux ) changes with the bh mass @xmath0 , due to the semiclassical backreation on the metric , in the domain of large mass ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "we shall address this problem here both numerically and analytically .",
    "note that in the static case the cghs field equations reduce to ordinary differential equations ( odes ) , which drastically simplifies their numerical ( as well as approximate - analytical ) solution . also , to address our problem",
    "it will be sufficient to analyze the exterior part of the bh . at the analytical side ,",
    "since for large m the semiclassical bh - exterior geometry is well - approximated ( locally ) by the corresponding classical solution , we shall consider the semiclassical solution as a small deviation from the classical one , and treat this deviation by linear perturbation analysis .",
    "as it turns out , the overall magnitude of this perturbation scales as @xmath1 .",
    "not surprisingly , the perturbation analysis yields a semiclassical correction to @xmath5 ( as well as to @xmath3 and the outflux ) which scales as @xmath1 too .",
    "we calculate this correction analytically , and then confirm it numerically .",
    "note that there is a remarkable difference between 2d and 4d bhs , already at the classical level : whereas in 4d the surface gravity @xmath5 scales as @xmath1 , in 2d it is actually _ independent of the bh mass_. as a consequence , in a semiclassical macroscopic bh the ( leading - order ) hawking temperature @xmath3 is @xmath21 in 4d , but constant ( i.e. independent of @xmath0 ) in the 2d framework .",
    "correspondingly the outflux ( the outgoing component of @xmath12 ) at infinity is @xmath22 in 4d but constant in 2d .",
    "the semiclassical correction to the background geometry of the 2d bh modifies these constant values of @xmath5 , @xmath3 and outflux , and the modification in all three quantities scales as @xmath1 at the leading order .",
    "it is this @xmath21 leading - order semiclassical effect which we explore in this paper  both theoretically ( through perturbation analysis ) and numerically .",
    "we point out that a similar phenomenon also occurs in the case of a _ dynamical , evaporating _ , 2d cghs bh . at the large - mass limit",
    ", a 2d bh evaporates at a constant rate @xmath23 ( owing to the @xmath0-independence of @xmath5 in the classical cghs solution ) .",
    "however , due to the backreaction of the semiclassical @xmath12 on the geometry , there is a finite - mass correction to the hawking outflux ( and hence to @xmath23 ) , which again scales as @xmath1 . ''",
    "actually refers to the bondi mass , namely the remaining bh mass as seen by an observer at fni . ]",
    "this correction term for a 2d evaporating bh was calculated analytically @xcite , and also confirmed numerically @xcite .",
    "it is remarkable that the leading - order ( @xmath21 ) finite - mass correction to the ( otherwise - constant ) outgoing component of @xmath12 is found to be _ exactly the same _ in the static and evaporating cases .",
    "we further comment on this observation in the discussion section .    in the next section",
    "we briefly review the cghs semiclassical model ( as well as its classical limit ) .",
    "we restrict attention to static solutions which are regular at the horizon , and explore the asymptotic behavior of the semiclassical geometry at the horizon and at infinity .",
    "we then turn in section 3 to address the hawking temperature of such static bh s , as well as the hawking outflux ( and influx ) at infinity , taking into account the deviation of the background geometry from its classical counterpart . then in sec .",
    "4 we analyze the large - mass leading - order ( @xmath21 ) semiclassical correction to the geometry , treating it as a linear perturbation .",

    "it is interesting to note that a similar result was previously obtained for the hawking outflux emitted from a _ non - static , evaporating _ , cghs semiclassical bh . in that case too , the outflux was found to take precisely the form ( [ eq : first - order_flux ] ) , this time with @xmath80 denoting the bondi mass ( namely the remaining bh mass , as measured at fni as a function of @xmath118 ) . that result , too , was obtained analytically @xcite and then confirmed numerically @xcite .",
    "here we were able to get this first - order result with a much simpler calculation ( both analytical and numerical ) , for a static bh model .",
    "we carried out a numerical calculation to verify our analytical result ( [ eq : first - order_kappa ] ) for the first - order finite - mass correction to @xmath5 .",
    "to this end we numerically integrated the static semiclassical evolution equations , namely the nonlinear ode system ( [ eq : s - c_canonic_evo_r],[eq : s - c_canonic_evo_s ] ) .",
    "the semiclassical cghs model admits a unique scaling law : @xcite the field equations remain invariant under a multiplication of both @xmath159 and @xmath45 by the same arbitrary constant ( while keeping @xmath38 unchaged ) .",
    "it follows from this scaling law that the dependence of @xmath5 on @xmath80 and @xmath159 ( in the _ exact _ semiclassical solution ) is only through the combination @xmath218 . in our numerical simulations we calculated @xmath5 as a function on @xmath218 throughout the range @xmath244 .",
    "the surface gravity @xmath5 as a function of the bh `` normalized mass '' @xmath218 .",
    "the dashed - dotted black curve displays our numerical results , which were calculated for 250 values of @xmath218 throughout the range @xmath244 .",
    "the first - order theoretical prediction @xmath245 is the solid red curve .",
    "these two curves are actually visually indistingwishable . for comparison",
    "we also display the corresponding zeroth - order expression @xmath246 , the solid green line . ]    in the analytical derivation above we have imposed the regularity condition @xmath247 at the horizon .",
    "in addition we have worked with the gauge in which @xmath248 , in accord with eq .",
    "( [ eq : s - c_rs_inf_asymptotic ] ) . in a numerical implementation",
    "this would mean that we would have to impose boundary conditions at both boundaries of the simulation , @xmath56 and @xmath55 .",
    "this is somewhat inconvenient , though it can still be done , e.g. by iterations .",
    "however , to simplify the numerical procedure we have chosen a different approach : we can use a more convenient gauge for the simulation , and then calculate @xmath5 using the gauge - invariant expression ( [ eq : kappa_general-1 ] ) .",
    "we have chosen the gauge for the simulation to be @xmath249 at the horizon , and integrated the ode system ( [ eq : s - c_canonic_evo_r],[eq : s - c_canonic_evo_s ] ) from the horizon towards infinity .",
    "the boundary conditions for @xmath45 are taken to be @xmath247 as well as @xmath250 . in this way",
    "all our boundary conditions are specified at @xmath251 . in this gauge",
    "it easily follows from eq .",
    "( [ eq : kappa_general-1 ] ) that @xmath252 .",
    "the results of our numerical simulations are presented in fig .",
    "1 . the graph demonstrates an excellent agreement between the numerical solution and our theoretical prediction , based on the first - order analysis .",
    "this figure also indicates very clearly that the first - order correction is really needed : the numerical results deviate substatially from the zero - order outflux ( the horizontal line @xmath246 , which is the infinite - mass limit ) .",
    "finally we note that our numerical simulations also reveal a second - order correction term in @xmath5 .",
    "this additional term is consistent ( within the numerical accuracy ) with @xmath253 this of course implies a corresponding second - order correction in the hawking temperature and the outflux .",
    "we have found analytically , and confirmed numerically , that in a large - mass ( @xmath223 ) , static , cghs semiclassical bh the surface gravity @xmath5 admits a small semiclassical correction @xmath254 , presented in eq .",
    "( [ eq : first - order_kappa ] ) .",
    "correspondingly , the hawking temperature and outflux also get finite - mass corrections , as shown in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : first - order_temp],[eq : first - order_flux ] ) .    as was already mentioned above , previous analytical @xcite as well as numerical @xcite analyses of the hawking radiation emitted from an _ evaporating _ cghs bh revealed the presence of a semiclassical correction term @xmath254 in the outflux .",
    "our analysis shows that this correction term is precisely the same ( at order @xmath240 ) in the static and evaporating cases .",
    "namely , eq . ( [ eq : first - order_flux ] ) holds in the evaporating case as well ( provided that one interprets @xmath80 as the bondi mass ) .    in the evaporating case ,",
    "one may be tempted to interpret the finite - mass correction to the outflux as an indication for the non - thermal character of the hawking radiation .",
    "such deviations from thermality might be important for certain aspects of the information puzzle @xcite .",
    "our analysis of the static case suggests a different interpretation of this @xmath254 correction to the outflux : the backreaction of the renormalized stress - energy tensor @xmath12 obviously modifies the background geometry , and as a consequence the bh s surface gravity @xmath5 is modified too .",
    "this inevitably leads to a change in the hawking temperature , through the standard relation @xmath4 ( which should exactly hold , for a static bh , even in the semiclassical case ) . in turn",
    ", this correction in @xmath3 naturally leads to a corresponding correction in the outflux , through the standard quadratic relation between temperature and outflux ( the 2d analog of the stefan - boltzmann law , which states that the outflux should be proportional to the square of the temperature ) .",
    "indeed , this exact quadratic relation between outflux and hawking temperature is guaranteed to hold in the 2d semiclassical ( static ) bhs of the cghs model , as demonstrated in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : temp-1 ] ) and ( [ eq : flux_exact ] ) .",
    "this relation is also reflected in our explicit first - order results , eqs .",
    "( [ eq : first - order_temp ] ) and ( [ eq : first - order_flux ] ) . thus ,",
    "in the static case the hawking outflux remains precisely thermal ( despite the semiclassical backreaction ) , even though the hawking temperature gets a small semiclassical correction .",
    "turning now to the evaporating case , since the first - order correction to the outflux precisely agrees with the static result ( [ eq : first - order_flux ] ) , it appears that this @xmath255 correction merely reflects the change in the hawking temperature due to backreaction ( rather than deviations from thermality ) .",
    "indeed one may anticipate small deviations from thermality in the dynamical , evaporating case ; however , such deviations seemingly appear only at second or higher orders in @xmath240 .",
    "this research was supported by the israel science foundation ( grant no .",
