    "spin - orbit coupling plays a crucial role in a variety of physical systems ranging from atoms and nuclei to topological insulators @xcite and spintronics @xcite .",

    "schemes to produce spin - orbit coupling in ultracold atomic systems create effective non - abelian gauge fields for atoms @xcite which take the form of rashba - dresselhaus spin - orbit couplings , familiar in semiconductor physics @xcite .",
    "a system of spin - orbit coupled ultracold bosons was recently realized by lin et al .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the problem of ultracold bosons with rashba - dresselhaus spin - orbit coupling has been considered within mean - field , where the interparticle interactions are assumed to be independent of momenta @xcite .",
    "these studies predicted that the ground states can be either a  plane - wave \" bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) of particles in a single momentum state , or a  striped \" bec involving a coherent superposition of two different momenta .",
    "however , recent studies indicate that , beyond mean field , the effective interaction has a qualitatively different structure , resulting , for example , in the absence of interaction between particles scattering in the zero total - momentum channel @xcite and the prediction that a bec involving only a single momentum of particles is not favorable in an isotropic rashba field @xcite .    in this study",
    "we delineate the ground state phase diagram of bosons taking the effective interaction described in terms of the full @xmath0 matrix rather than mean - field coupling .",
    "we consider bosons with an isotropic or anisotropic rashba - dresselhaus spin - orbit coupling , @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the spin - orbit coupling strength , @xmath3 is the particle momentum , and @xmath4 determines the @xmath5-@xmath6 anisotropy . in our previous paper @xcite , we showed that the effective interaction can be renormalized in terms of physical scattering lengths and does not depend on the ultraviolet cutoffs . here , we extend this calculation , and carry out the exact summation of ladder diagrams for the @xmath0 matrix of bosons scattering at zero energy in three dimensions . then we reduce the hamiltonian , with the @xmath0 matrix as the effective interaction , to a nozires model @xcite , from which we determine the ground - state phases as functions of the anisotropies in the @xmath7-@xmath8 plane , where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the scattering lengths between the same and different pseudospin states , respectively .",
    "we show that there are generally three phases : a plane wave bec , a striped bec with two different momenta , and an unstable phase where the effective interaction is attractive .",
    "the phase diagrams ( figs.[zeroto075 ] and [ zero999to1 ] below ) are substantially different and richer in structure than those predicted using mean - field couplings with the bare couplings replaced by @xmath11 , especially when @xmath7 and @xmath8 are large , or @xmath4 is close to unity . in the isotropic limit @xmath12 ,",
    "the plane wave bec does not appear ( fig .",

    "we describe how the phase diagram evolves continuously with anisotropy , from @xmath13 where spin - orbit coupling is present only in the @xmath5 direction , to an isotropic spin - orbit coupling @xmath12 .",
    "we find that , in the vicinity of @xmath12 , the phase diagrams are logarithmically sensitive to small changes in @xmath4 , a structure we analyze by expanding in the anisotropy about @xmath12 .",
    "we also find that a bec with negative scattering lengths can be stabilized in the presence of spin - orbit coupling , when the scattering lengths are sufficiently large in magnitude ( fig .",
