    "in @xcite , carl friedrich gau  defined an integral whose purpose was to compute the linking number of two closed curves in euclidean 3-space .",
    "gau s linking integral follows from at least two elementary arguments : one involves thinking of the curves as wires , running a current through one and applying ampre s law , while the other is a straightforward degree - of - map argument ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the latter extends easily to all euclidean spaces ( as we will see in section [ sec : rn ] ) , but can not be directly adapted to spheres . as such , when dennis deturck and herman gluck set out to derive integral formulas for the linking number of closed curves in the 3-sphere and in hyperbolic 3-space @xcite , they adapted the first argument , developing steady - state versions of electrodynamics in those spaces .",
    "the integrals defined by gau  in the case of @xmath2 and by deturck and gluck in the case of @xmath3 and @xmath4 apply to the simplest of the eight 3-dimensional model geometries and motivate the search for a linking integral in the next simplest geometry , @xmath5 . an explicit formula for this case",
    "is given in section [ sec : examples ] , but the techniques developed to obtain this formula apply to a much broader class of manifolds , which we call `` visible hypersurfaces '' .",

    "every closed manifold is homotopically equivalent to a visible hypersurface in some euclidean space .",
    "our main theorem gives explicit linking integrals in all visible hypersurfaces :    [ thm : main ] let @xmath12 and @xmath13 be disjoint , closed , oriented , null - homologous submanifolds of a visible hypersurface @xmath6 such that @xmath14 .",
