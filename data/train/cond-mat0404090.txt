    "experimental and theoretical studies of chemisorption on vicinal surfaces are of great current interest due to close connection to real catalytic substrates which exhibit beside other defects many steps .",
    "thanks to scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) a breakthrough in determining the morphology of substrates and overlayers was achieved in recent years @xcite .",
    "carbon monoxide on cu(211 ) was studied with respect to ordered overlayers and also in connection with the possibility to laterally manipulate adsorbates on the surface by stm @xcite .",

    "@xcite found that the cu(211 ) surface does not reconstruct and that there are several ordered co structures upon adsorption .",
    "we concentrate here on the ( 2@xmath01 ) and the ( 3@xmath01 ) phases with respective coverages of @xmath1=@xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4  ml .",
    "stm imaging of disordered adsorption at very low coverage and of the ( 2@xmath01 ) phase revealed that the co molecules adsorb on top of cu atoms at the step edges . the high coverage ( 3@xmath01 ) phase is more complicated : upon preparing an adlayer at @xmath5  k",
    ", the admolecule configuration appears to be top - bridge , whereas in small islands prepared at @xmath6  k by lateral manipulation of the molecules they occupy top - top arrangements within the ( 3@xmath01 ) unit cell @xcite .",

    "@xcite have observed a significant decrease in the energy of the frustrated translation vibrations parallel to the surface ( t - mode ) of isolated co molecules adsorbed on the intrinsic step sites of cu(211 ) as compared to co on flat cu(111 ) and cu(001 ) surfaces .",
    "they propose a tilting of the co molecules due to the presence of these intrinsic steps as a possible explanation for this energy decrease .",
    "there have been several theoretical investigations of the geometric structure of clean cu(211 ) @xcite and also cu(n11 ) surfaces @xcite .",
    "very recently , reviews of electronic , structural , vibrational and thermodynamic characterization of vicinal surfaces were published @xcite . on the other hand , calculations on the adsorption of co molecules on cu(211 )",
    "are less numerous @xcite .",
    "furthermore , theoretical investigations of vibrational and energetic properties of the co adsorption system are scarce or missing .",
    "adsorption of co on cu(211 ) is also interesting from the fundamental point of view as it offers an occasion to study adsorbate reorganization as proposed for no on the pd(211 ) surface @xcite .    in this work we carried out a systematic theoretical investigation of the clean copper ( 211 ) surface and of the adsorption of co molecules . in section [ clean cu(211 ) surface ]",
    "we examine the clean cu(211 ) surface ( multilayer relaxations , work - functions ) .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ co adsorption ] is divided into several parts where we describe structural , vibrational and energetic properties of the co molecules adsorbed on the cu(211 ) surface .",
    "moreover , subsection [ stm pictures ] provides calculated stm images of the probable structural phases at @xmath7  ml .",
    "we present and discuss our results parallelly to create a picture of the trends for clean cu(211 ) and co molecules adsorbed on this surface .",

    "the vicinal ( 211 ) surface consists of ( 111 ) oriented terrace planes and monoatomic ( 100 ) steps according to the somorjai notation ( 3(111)@xmath0(100 ) ) @xcite .",
    "the macroscopic surface plane is rotated by @xmath8 from the ( 111 ) plane .",
    "the distance between the steps is @xmath9     according to the theoretical bulk lattice parameter a@xmath10     of fcc cu . the structure of the clean cu(211 ) surface is shown in fig .",

    "we consider co molecules in the ( 2@xmath01 ) and the ( 3@xmath01 ) unit cells .",
    "the calculations presented in this study are performed within a plane - wave density functional framework .",
    "we have used the vienna ab - initio simulation package ( vasp ) @xcite and employed projected augmented - wave ( paw ) potentials @xcite . for exchange and correlation the functional proposed by perdew and zunger @xcite is used , adding ( semi - local ) generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) of the pw91 @xcite .",
    "further , the rpbe exchange - correlation functional @xcite is used , since it is more accurate for the co adsorption on the cu(111 ) surface @xcite .",
    "it is well known that in some cases dft calculations fail to produce the correct adsorption site for co on transition or noble metals surfaces @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that this failure arises from the underestimation of the homo - lumo gap of the co molecule favoring backdonation to the antibonding 2@xmath11 state and adsorption in a site with higher coordination @xcite . very recently , kresse et al . @xcite",
    "have shown that the correct site - preference can be achieved by adding a hubbard - like on - site coulomb repulsion @xcite to the molecular hamiltonian of co leading to an increased homo - lumo gap .",
    "we have applied the special gga+u method @xcite to examine the effect of stronger electronic correlation on the prediction of the correct adsorption site .",
    "we have used ( 4@xmath06@xmath01 ) and ( 4@xmath04@xmath01 ) k - point meshes according to monkhorst - pack for the ( 2@xmath01 ) and ( 3@xmath01 ) unit cells , respectively .",
    "the adsorption energy ( e@xmath12 ) was defined as the difference between the total energy of the studied system ( cu(211 ) surface with co ) and the individual components of the system ( cu(211 ) surface and co ) @xcite .",
    "the atoms in the first five layers and c and o atoms of the co molecule were allowed to relax .",
    "the geometry optimizations were caried according to conjugate - gradient algorithm .",
    "the finite - difference method is used for the calculation of stretching frequencies . in the finite - difference technique ,",
    "total energies and hellmann - feynman forces are evaluated as a function of the atomic displacements from their equilibrium positions ; c and o atoms are moved in the direction of carthesian axis ( x , y , z ) by 0.04   and the substrate is frozen .",
    "the hessian dynamical matrix is created from the second derivatives of the total energy with respect to the positions of co. the matrix is diagonalized and normalized eigenvectors denote modes of the vibrations and corresponding eigenvalues are proportional to stretching frequencies of the vibrational modes @xcite .",
    "we have applied a tersoff - hamman approach to calculate stm images from the ab - initio calculations where the stm contour plot is approximated by the charge density around the fermi level ( @xmath13 mev ) @xcite .",
    "constant current topographs are approximated by constant charge density iso - surfaces .",
    "the iso - surfaces are given for the charge density value of e@xmath14 ev/@xmath15 .",
    "we have calculated multilayer relaxations of the clean cu(211 ) surface and also of clean cu(211 ) with one cu - adatom on the ( 111 ) terrace adjacent to a step ( see cross in fig .",

    "the lateral distance between the extra cu - adatoms was chosen to be @xmath17b ( see fig . [ figure structure 211 ] ) for the extra cu atoms in the direction of the steps .",
    "the changes of the interlayer spacing from both experiment ( leed @xcite ) and theoretical studies are tabulated in table [ table relaxations 211 ] .",
    "notice that these changes are not strictly oscillatory .",
    "the earlier and current theoretical and experimental studies predict the same trends for the interlayer relaxation ( ,,+ ) for four surface layers .",
    "such behaviour has been obtained in a flapw study @xcite , but the authors report a more pronounced contraction of the first interlayer distance as compared to the experimental results and the present theoretical study . on the other hand ,",
    "the lda @xcite and current gga calculations give very similar results which are moreover close to the experiment .",
    "inclusion of a cu - adatom next to a step on the cu(211 ) surface expands only its local environment which gives rise to a small buckling of the layer below the cu - adatom .    [ cols=\"^,<,<,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     two molecules in the ( 3@xmath01 ) unit cell increase the number of possible vibrational modes , adding out - of - phase vibrational frequencies .",
    "these frequencies are included as the second value for the top - top and top - bridge configurations in table [ table vibrations co / cu(211 ) ] .",
    "we observe two important differences between the vibrational frequencies of top - top and top - bridge species in the ( 3@xmath01 ) surface unit cell : different splitting of the @xmath18 and @xmath19 modes .",
    "the in - phase symmetric mode @xmath18 for the top - top configuration is calculated to be 2061 @xmath20 .",
    "the out - of - phase symmetric mode where both molecules vibrate in opposite directions is 2007 @xmath20 . in the top - bridge configuration",
    "the in - phase @xmath18 mode ( 2057 @xmath20 ) is close to the in - phase mode of the top - top configuration , but the out - of - phase symmetric mode is by almost 100 @xmath20 softer ( 1908 @xmath20 ) .",
    "the experimental eels study @xcite provides values for both in - phase and out - of - phase co stretching modes : 2088 @xmath20 - in - phase and 1881 @xmath20 - out - of - phase which is already an indication that the adsorption takes place in the top - bridge configuration .",
    "the second difference concerns the splitting of the @xmath19 modes .",
    "the in - phase and out - of - phase splitting is 2 @xmath20 for the top - top configuration and 31 @xmath20 for the top - bridge configuration .",
    "the experimental eels study @xcite provides only one s(urface)-co frequency ( 341 @xmath20 ) for the high - coverage phase with two symmetric modes .",
    "in addition to the experimentally observed mode at 341 @xmath20 we would expect another mode at a lower frequency and with appreciably smaller intensity .",
    "this was not observed in ref .",
    "@xcite probably due to its small intensity and the large contribution of the specular beam in this frequency region",
    ". the @xmath19 frequency of 306.7 @xmath20 was calculated for co in off - top site without phonon bath and the frequency of 343 @xmath20 with the phonon bath at 100 k @xcite .",
    "the later frequency is in nice agreement with our calculated stretching frequency of 346 @xmath20 ( resp .",
    "342 @xmath20 for @xmath3 ml coverage ) and the experimentally observed frequency ( 341 @xmath20 ) .",
    "calculated charge density contours have frequently been used for comparison with experimental stm images and have been able to shed light on complex adsorption systems @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ figure stm pictures ] we compare typical experimental stm - pictures ( fig .",
    "[ figure stm pictures]a and fig .",
    "[ figure stm pictures]d ) with calculated charge density contours ( fig .",
    "[ figure stm pictures]b and fig .",
    "[ figure stm pictures]e ) for both co - configurations discussed for the ( 3@xmath01 ) phase , namely top - bridge and top - top ; the corresponding structure models are show in fig .",
    "[ figure stm pictures]c and f. the calculated top - bridge arrangement ( fig .",
    "[ figure stm pictures]b ) actually resembles closely the experimental stm - picture ( fig .",
    "[ figure stm pictures]a ) .",
    "the situation is , however , quite different for the case of the top - top - arrangement ( fig .",
    "[ figure stm pictures]e and fig .",
    "[ figure stm pictures]d ) : whereas a double peak structure is seen in the calculations there is only one peak visible in the stm - pictures , whose maximum lies in between the two adjacent co - molecules .",
    "furthermore , in most stm pictures the peak appears elongated in the direction perpendicular to the steps in disagreement with the charge density contour calculations .",
    "this is alarming , since this top - top - configuration is unequivocally established and identified in careful stm manipulation and imaging experiments @xcite .",
    "we can rule out experimental reasons for an explanation of this discrepancy like lateral averaging of the corrugation due to final tip width or thermal effects smearing out the double peak structure due to vibrations of the molecules .",
    "the reason for this discrepancy seems more to be caused by physical effects which are connected with delicate problems in imaging co - molecules on metal surfaces @xcite : it is well known that with metal tips co is imaged as depression ( see the isolated co indicated by an arrow in the stm - image of fig .",
    "[ figure adatom pictures]a ) .",
    "if a co - molecule is deliberately transferred to the tip and co s at the surface are imaged with a co - terminated tip , then the molecules appear as protrusions @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that charge density calculations for the hypothetical low coverage ( 3@xmath01)-phase yield pronounced maxima at the co - sites . therefore , isolated co - molecules imaged with a co - terminated tip resemble more the calculated charge density contour .",
    "the reason for the fact that with clean metal tips isolated co s appear as depressions was recently traced back by nieminen et al .",
    "@xcite to interference effects between different electron paths passing near and through the co , which are canceled when the tip also bears a co - molecule .",
    "the stm - picture of the top - top arrangement in fig .",
    "[ figure stm pictures]d was taken with a clean metal tip , but also with a co - terminated tip the two adjacent molecules appear as a single protrusion . on the other hand , the stm - picture of the extended ( 3@xmath01)-phase ( fig .",
    "[ figure stm pictures]a ) was highly likely taken with a co - terminated tip and might therefore look more close to the calculated charge density contour ( fig .",
    "[ figure stm pictures]e ) .",
    "nevertheless , in view of the experimental results for the top - top - configuration ( fig .",
    "[ figure stm pictures]d ) , we can not strictly exclude an interpretation of the stm - picture of fig .",
    "[ figure stm pictures]a , as consisting of top - top co - pairs separated by an unoccupied edge site . on the other hand",
    ", in view of the present theoretical result , that the top - bridge configuration is slightly energetically favored , it appears also possible that this configuration is thermodynamically favored due to the interplay of energy and configurational entropy effects @xcite .",
    "more experimental data are needed to solve this problem unequivocally .",
    "the calculated differences in work function presented here might be of help in this respect .",
    "we have used the dft code vasp to investigate clean and co - covered cu(211 ) vicinal surfaces .",
    "we consider the most probable sites according to experiment : on - top , bridge and combinations of these two sites .",
    "we show that the clean cu(211 ) surface tries to smooth its surface and relaxes inwards in the first and second layers and then it compensates this relaxation by an outward relaxation of the third layer .",
    "co molecules adsorb perpendicular to the macroscopic surface in on - top sites at low coverages up to @xmath21 ml . from energy considerations it is non - trivial to distinguish",
    "which phase is the most favorable for @xmath7  ml .",
    "our calculated adsorption energies for the co molecules suggest the top - bridge configuration of the co molecules on the cu(211 ) at this high coverage .",
    "however , the top - top configuration is the only one safely established experimentally .    from the vibrational properties the top - bridge configuration appears to be thermodynamically favored , but",
    "more experiments are needed to settle this subtle point .",
    "calculations of the co - adsorption energy on a single cu - adatom adjacent to a step edge show an increase of @xmath22 mev ( rpbe ) with respect to co - adsorption on cu - atoms embedded in the step edges .",
    "this is in agreement with experimental observations using lateral manipulation of the co. this result is very important for vertical manipulation as it shows that co prefers to adsorb at low coordination sites as available at the tip apex ."
