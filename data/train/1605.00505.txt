    "the schelling process  @xcite was developed to explain the emergence of racial segregation in american cities .",
    "the central insight of the model was that even a small preference for like neighbors at an individual level can lead to large scale segregation at a collective level .",
    "ever since it was first developed , the basic form of the schelling process has been widely applied to study the process of segregation using agent - based simulations in sociology  @xcite  @xcite  @xcite  @xcite and economics  @xcite",
    ". the schelling model has also increasingly been of interest to physicists , specifically in the application of the tools of statistical mechanics to understand the underlying phase transition occurring in the model  @xcite  @xcite  @xcite  @xcite , as also for the development of analytic frameworks of the schelling model  @xcite .",
    "schelling s original model  @xcite explored the emergence of segregation for two races , based on the underlying tolerance levels of agents to those of the other race .",
    "race is interpreted as any binary attribute that is unchangeable and easily identifiable .",
    "so , for instance , if an agent has a tolerance level of 70% , it means that the agent would only move into those neighborhoods where at least 30% of neighbors have the same attribute ( or race ) .",
    "the model s dynamics occur in a city , which is a one - dimensional or two - dimensional lattice , and an agent s neighborhood in a two - dimensional lattice is typically considered to be either the von neumann neighborhood of the four nearest neighbors around a location in the lattice or the moore neighborhood of the eight next nearest neighbors around a location .",
    "schelling finds that even if agents have reasonably high tolerance levels ( up to approximately 67% ) , large - scale segregation rapidly obtains as agents seek out neighborhoods that satisfy their tolerance levels .",
    "consequently , a highly segregated city ensues despite individual agents being able to tolerate a much more mixed city . the emergence of segregation in the schelling model has been found to be a robust result across a range of parameter specifications in the model such as lattice size , neighborhood shape and size , and heterogeneity of agent preferences  @xcite  @xcite  @xcite  @xcite .",
    "segregation is also seen to be robust across a selection of agent choice functions - deterministic , discrete stochastic , or continuous  @xcite  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we explore the dynamics of segregation based on the wealth of agents and are particularly interested in mechanisms that prevent the onset of segregation .",
    "there has been some prior work , in sociological literature , in extending the classical exploration of schelling s binary - attribute agent model to agents with a wealth or income attribute sampled from a continuous distribution  @xcite  @xcite .",
    "benenson , hatna , and or  @xcite attempt to explain observed urban income segregation outcomes in israel by simulating agent movement dynamics subject to agent incomes ( sampled from a log - normal distribution ) , social utility ( tolerance limits ) , and economic utility ( housing affordability ) , with agents having a view of the entire lattice and choosing to move into the best available site that is available and affordable at any time .",
    "they find not only that income - based segregation occurs and persists as predicted by schelling , but also that introducing a small number of agents with high tolerance levels into the city could significantly increase the heterogeneity of residential patterns .",
    "benard and willer  @xcite model segregation dynamics based on wealth and status of agents ( both sampled from a normal distribution ) subject to the extent of endogeneity in housing prices and find that wealth based segregation is pronounced with increasing correlation between status and wealth , as also with increasing endogeneity in housing prices .",
    "while our paper also seeks to explore the dynamics of wealth based segregation , we use a simpler model where agent movement is driven by a purely stochastic process , and while we expect to see the emergence of segregation as observed in these studies , our contribution will be in the exploration of mechanisms to reverse or prevent the onset of segregation .",
    "some of the recent physics literature  @xcite  @xcite explores the interface between segregation and de - segregation and suggests mechanisms to enable de - segregation .",
    "hazan and randon - furling  @xcite modify schelling dynamics for two types of agents by introducing a certain fraction of switching agents that can change from one type to another over the course of time and find that the presence of switching agents significantly reduces the extent of segregation .",
    "grauwin , bertin , lemoy , and jensen  @xcite introduce the notion of collective utility in addition to individual utility , basing their dynamics on a combination of collective and individual utility ( calibrated by a factor called the degree of cooperativity ) and find a critical value of degree of cooperativity between mixed and segregated states .",
    "our paper furthers the spirit of these studies and explores fundamental mechanisms to enable mixed wealth equilibria .",
    "we seek to understand the evolution of spatial dynamics on account of the wealth of individual agents in a city .",
    "each individual agent can be thought of as a household that resides in a single cell ( house ) on a two - dimensional lattice with n cells that represents the city .",
    "each agent has a single attribute , namely its wealth , which forms the basis for the dynamics we explore .",
    "the actual spreads of incomes and wealth in nations around the world are described by a range of distributions - exponential , log - normal , gamma , and power - law  @xcite  @xcite  @xcite  @xcite .",
    "the wealth of agents is sampled from a standard normal distribution for the purpose of this paper , but our findings are also robust for exponential and log - normal distributions .",
    "these agent wealths are initially distributed randomly across locations in the lattice .",
    "we re - interpret the tolerance level in the original schelling model to a threshold level , @xmath0 , defined as the minimum number of neighbors of a site whose wealth has to be lesser than or equal to the wealth of any agent attempting to move in to that site . instead of an agent s tolerance in the case of the binary attribute model , in this case we conceptualize the threshold level to be defined at the level of the lattice ( city ) such that it is the uniform requirement for every agent to move locations within the city .",
    "low @xmath0 values indicates a higher potential for movement for all agents across the wealth spectrum , while a high @xmath0 indicates much lesser potential for movement for those at the lower end of the wealth spectrum .",
    "the level of @xmath0 can therefore be considered an apriori measure of the ease of movement in the city based on an agent s wealth . for the model",
    ", we set @xmath0 to 4 .",
    "the neighborhood of a cell is defined to be its eight next nearest ( or moore ) neighbors , however we find that the results of simulations are robust for the von neumann neighborhood as well .",
    "the dynamics of the model are generated through kawasaki kinetics  @xcite , where two sites , with agents a and b , are picked at random from the lattice .",
    "each selected agent s wealth is compared to the wealth of each of the agents in the other s neighborhood .",
    "let n~a~ and n~b~ be the number of neighbors of a(b ) whose wealths are lesser than or equal to that of b(a ) respectively . if both n~a~ and n~b~ are greater than or equal to @xmath0 , then the agents exchange places with probability 1 .",
    "however , if this is not the case , then an exchange occurs with probability p~m~. ( eq  [ eq : probmove ] ) @xmath1    we define @xmath2 as the calibrating factor that determines the probability of movement if the threshold condition is unsatisfied .",
    "decreasing @xmath2 yields a progressive increase the number of exchanges where the threshold condition is unsatisfied - we refer to such exchanges as disallowed - realized moves. in the model simulations , @xmath2 takes the following values : 0.001 , 0.01 , 0.05 , 0.1 , 0.25 , 0.5 , 0.75 , 1 , 5 10 , and 100 .    in each iteration of the model , two sites",
    "are picked at random and depending on whether they satisfy the threshold condition , they exchange agents based on the mechanism described earlier .",
    "we run 100,000 iterations with a given value of @xmath2 , and repeat this 25 times for each @xmath2 .",
    "all the measures to calculate the extent of segregation ( described next ) are averaged over these 25 attempts for each @xmath2 , for the purposes of the analysis .",
    "this process is repeated for the entire range of @xmath2 values .",
    "we use two measures to capture the extent of segregation obtained in the lattice as a consequence of the dynamics : size of rich neighborhoods ( s ) and rich wealth differential ( @xmath3 ) . in this context",
    ", rich is defined as the set of agents with wealth greater than or equal to one positive standard deviation from the mean of the wealth distribution .",
    "let n~r~ be the number of rich agents in the wealth distribution .",
    "for the standard normal distribution , the size of this set is 15 - 16% of the total agent population .",
    "size of rich neighborhoods ( s ) is simply a measure of the average number of rich neighbors of a rich agent . for each rich cell @xmath4 , we compute the number of its neighbors that are also rich , v~r~(i ) ( eq  [ eq : si ] ) .",
    "s is the average of this quantity across all rich cells (  [ eq : s ] ) .",
    "we expect s to increase with increasing segregation on account of the spatial congregation of the rich in more segregated states .",
    "@xmath5 @xmath6    rich wealth differential ( @xmath3 ) is a measure of the average absolute difference in wealth between a rich cell and its neighbors .",
    "for each rich cell @xmath4 , we calculate @xmath3~i~ , which is the average of the absolute difference between the wealth of @xmath4 and the wealth of each of its moore neighbors ( eq  [ eq : deli ] ) .",
    "@xmath3 is obtained by averaging @xmath3~i~ for all rich cells ( eq  [ eq : del ] ) .",
    "as segregation increases , we would expect @xmath3 to decrease .",
    "this is because , as neighborhoods become more homogeneous with increasing segregation , we expect that , on average , the absolute difference in wealth between rich cells and their neighbors will progressively decrease .",

    "we find a non - linear relationship between rich wealth differential ( @xmath3 ) and disallowed - realized moves . at very high @xmath2 ,",
    "when no disallowed - realized moves occur , @xmath3 is at a minimum , but as @xmath2 is decreased and disallowed - realized moves just begin to occur , we find that there is a sharp increase in @xmath3 and this continues till the fraction of disallowed - realized moves reaches about 10% ( or a @xmath2 in the range 0.25 to 0.5 ) . beyond this region",
    ", there is a more gradual increase in @xmath3 till it stabilizes for @xmath12 , corresponding to disallowed - realized moves ratios in the region of 58 - 68% .",
    "the overall increase is @xmath3 over the entire range of @xmath2 is close to 81%(fig  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "however , it is in the initial region , where fraction of disallowed - realized moves is less than 10% , that most of this increase occurs .",
    "in fact , over 52% of the increase in @xmath3 occurs even when the fraction of disallowed - realized moves is under 6.5% .",
    "a similar non - linear relationship is observed in the relationship between size of rich neighborhoods ( s ) and the fraction of disallowed - realized moves(fig  [ fig2 ] ) . for @xmath9 ,",
    "where no disallowed moves occur , s is in the region of 4.25 , meaning that the top 15% of the wealthiest agents have , on average , 4.25 like neighbors .",
    "however , there is again a sharp transition downwards as disallowed - realized moves begin to occur and s drops to less than 2 as the fraction of disallowed - realized moves increases to a mere 6.5% - a drop of over 50% , which is similar to the sharp increase we saw in the case of @xmath3 earlier .",
    "again , beyond this point , the curve exhibits a gentler decline and size of rich neighborhoods settles in the region of 1.25 for @xmath12 , resulting in an overall drop in size of rich neighborhoods of 70% .",

    "however , as soon as disallowed - realized moves start happening , we observe the size of rich neighborhoods rapidly decreasing . at @xmath2 = 1 ,",
    "when the fraction of disallowed - realized moves is merely 0.46% , the size of rich neighborhoods drops to 3.6 . when the disallowed - realized moves ratio increases to 6.9% , the size of rich neighborhoods drops substantially further to 1.6 .",

    "we now explore the nature of this transformation .",
    "in order to understand the transformation from a segregated to a mixed state , we start by exploring the variation in allowed moves as @xmath2 is varied .",
    "allowed moves are moves that occur when the threshold condition is satisfied for agents in both the randomly chosen sites in an iteration .",
    "when there are no disallowed moves ( @xmath9 ) , the number of allowed moves is around 13,000 .",
    "as soon as disallowed moves start being realized , the total number of moves increase not just by the number of disallowed - realized moves , but by additional allowed moves that are generated on account of the realization of these disallowed moves . as fig  [ fig4 ] illustrates ,",
    "just as disallowed - realized moves start occurring and increase initially , this has a dramatic effect on the increase in allowed moves .",
    "when the number disallowed - realized shows a small increase from 0 to 80 , the corresponding increase in allowed moves is in the region of 1,500 .",
    "this effect is especially pronounced in the early increases in disallowed - realized moves , beyond which allowed moves continue to increase with increasing disallowed - realized moves , albeit at a decreasing rate , and settle at a value the region of 30,000 - 31,000 .",
    "the non - linear explosion in the number of allowed moves as function of the number of disallowed - realized moves involves what may be called an entropic effect .",
    "this is caused by a very rapid increase in the number of ways to select pairs that satisfy the threshold condition . to see how this works imagine",
    "the lattice is fully occupied by a population of two types",
    ". members of one community all have the same wealth @xmath13 and the members of the other all have wealth @xmath14 . now consider a region a , where a square cluster of @xmath15 agents is surrounded by @xmath14 agents .",
    "the @xmath15 agents at the edge of the @xmath15 cluster can not be swapped with @xmath14 agents through allowed moves . but now assume that one @xmath14 agent has been swapped through a disallowed - realized move to one of the edge sites within the @xmath15 cluster .",
    "two neighbor sites of this site now have 4 neighbors with @xmath15 and four with @xmath14 .",
    "thus these two sites have become available for allowed swaps for the @xmath14 agents .",
    "so one disallowed - realized move has generated two new sites for allowed moves .",
    "phrased in more general terms , even as a very small proportion of disallowed moves begins to happen , the resulting configuration of agents on the lattice enables more allowed moves to happen .",
    "the effect of a decreasing @xmath2 is that neighborhoods that previously would not have had lower wealth agents moving in on account of the threshold condition now see such disallowed moves , even if in small numbers initially .",
    "consequently , other agents on the lattice whose wealth is in the lower end of the distribution and who were earlier unable to move because they were close , but unable , to achieving the threshold condition are now able to achieve it on account of the low wealth agents that have moved around in the lattice to the neighborhoods that were out of reach .",
    "this effect is especially pronounced at lower fractions of disallowed - realized moves , where even small increases in such moves yield substantial increases in allowed moves as many agents that were earlier close to fulfilling the threshold levels are able to move now .",
    "it is this cascade in allowed moves caused by small numbers of disallowed moves that yields the sharply declining segregation we observed earlier .",
    "however , as @xmath2 is decreased , we find that the increasing fraction of disallowed - realized moves has a progressively weaker effect on allowed moves , until a point is reached where allowed moves settle at a stable value and stop varying with disallowed - realized moves .",
    "this tapering off effect is again consistent with the observed gradual decline in segregation after the initial sharp decline .",
    "this non - linear behavior of allowed moves could be explained by the fact that once a certain level of disallowed moves are realized , the lattice reaches mixed wealth configurations that maximize allowed moves , and any further increase in disallowed - realized moves has no impact on allowed moves .",
    "fig  [ fig5 ] , which is a plot of the absolute number of moves ( total , allowed , and disallowed - realized ) confirms that at high @xmath2 , we observe no disallowed moves , but just when @xmath16 and the first disallowed - realized moves manifest , the number of allowed moves starts to increase as well .",
    "this increase is rapid in the region between @xmath2 = 1 and @xmath2 = 0.1 . at @xmath17 ,",
    "the number of disallowed - realized moves crosses the number of allowed moves and it is at this point that the stable value of allowed moves ratio occurs .",
    "once the absolute number of disallowed - realized moves surpasses allowed moves , there is no further change in the number of allowed moves .",
    "therefore , all increase in total moves beyond this point is on account of change in disallowed - realized moves alone .    .",
    "* legend : solid line = total realized moves , dotted line = allowed moves , dashed line = disallowed - realized moves.,scaledwidth=75.0% ]    if we now consider changes in @xmath3 and s as a function of the ratio of disallowed - realized moves to allowed moves , we would expect to see the sharp transformation from segregated to mixed states occurring when this ratio is small and then level off as the ratio reaches 1 .",
    "fig  [ fig6 ] confirms this behavior .",
    "there is a significant body of literature in economics and political science that analyzes the effects of economic segregation in cities on a wide range of social outcomes  @xcite  @xcite  @xcite .",
    "wealth or income based segregation has been shown to adversely impact the educational attainment of youth from poorer households  @xcite .",
    "levels of civic participation tend to be significantly lower in economically homogeneous cities than in economically diverse , middle income cities  @xcite . additionally , there is evidence that socioeconomic segregation significantly impacts the risk of mortality , especially among the poor  @xcite . in view of these adverse outcomes of segregation ,",
    "the prevention or reversal of segregation in cities remains a question of significant import to public policy .",
    "while the model of segregation presented in this paper is a stylistic one , our results do suggest that the reversal or avoidance of segregation might not require significant public policy interventions , but rather minimal investments in strategies such as social housing or housing benefits transfers to poorer households .",
    "the extent of intervention ought to enable just a small fraction of households to move into areas that they may otherwise be unable to afford , and the dynamics of such movement could have a cascading effect , as demonstrated in the model , yielding increased mobility within the city , and potentially enabling the transformation from a segregated to a mixed equilibrium .",
    "we apply the schelling model to the wealth of agents in a city .",
    "as expected , we find that subject to a threshold level , wealth based spatial segregation ensues .",
    "however , introducing uncertainty into the decision to move , and randomly allowing some proportion of agents to move even in contravention of the threshold level condition , we find that even for small proportions of such disallowed moves , the dynamics no longer settle into a segregated state but instead sharply transition into a mixed wealth distribution .",
    "we find that this sharp transformation is on account of a non - linear increase in the number of allowed moves that occurs as a consequence of the disallowed - realized moves .",
