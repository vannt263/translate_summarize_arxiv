    "by the recent global analyses with the experimental data for polarized deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) , the polarized quark and antiquark distributions are determined well @xcite .",

    "reproduce well the experimental data ; however , the polarized gluon distribution @xmath5 can not be constrained because of indirect and small contribution through @xmath6 evolution and higher order correction at next - to - leading order ( nlo ) .",

    "the future asymmetry data contain useful information for clarifying the gluon contribution to the nucleon spin .",

    "therefore , the data with such errors do not directly affect improvements of these uncertainties .",
    "however , as far as the antiquark is concerned , the uncertainty can be indirectly reduced because the antiquark distribution is strongly correlated with the gluon distribution in the global analysis . in practice ,",
    "reduction of the antiquark uncertainty via the error correlation is indicated by the analysis with the fixed @xmath46 at initial scale @xcite .",
    "this fact suggests that the constraint on the gluon distribution indirectly affects the @xmath45 determination .",

    "@xmath53 gev , these data have rather weak constraint since the unpolarized cross section rapidly decreases as @xmath8 increases .",

    "]    the reason for the weak constraint is that the unpolarized cross section for @xmath55 gev is less than that for @xmath3 gev in the same @xmath57 region , and the integrated luminosity is still insufficient to provide the enough constraint at high @xmath8 .",

    ", the uncertainty broadens gradually in the low- and medium-@xmath54 regions where data do not exist .",

    "the uncertainty significantly increases with @xmath54 due to lack of precise data for polarized dis at large @xmath54 .",
