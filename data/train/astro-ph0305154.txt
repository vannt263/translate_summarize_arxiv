    "the absorbers are often variable in their ionic column densities , and it was quickly realized that simultaneous uv , far - uv , and x - ray observations provide the most valuable information , since they cover an enormous range in ionization , as well as address the uncertain relationship between the uv and x - ray absorbers .",
    "such observations in at least two of the three above wave bands are available for ngc 4051 ( collinge et al . 2001 ) , ngc 3783 ( kaspi et al . 2002 ; gabel et al .",

    "we confirmed the presence of five kinematic components of absorption in ly@xmath2 , n  v , and c  iv at significant blueshifts with respect to the systemic velocity , which were first detected in goddard high resolution spectrograph ( ghrs ) observations ( crenshaw et al .",
    "1999 ; mathur et al .",
    "compared to the ghrs spectra , the column densities of n  v and c  iv in the stis spectra had decreased substantially in components 1 and 3 ( at respective radial velocities of @xmath01040 and @xmath0530 km s@xmath1 , relative to an adopted systemic redshift of 0.01676 [ ck99 ] ) .",
    "we attributed these variations to changes in the total column densities of these components , but could not rule out variable ionization for component 1 .    in ck99 , we calculated photoionization models for the uv absorption components .",
    "based on the c  iv and n  v column densities from the stis 1998 data , we found that the ionization parameters and total ( ionized plus neutral ) hydrogen column densities of components 2  5 were too low to produce significant o  vii and o  viii columns .",
    "since we only had an upper limit for the c  iv column density in component 1 from the stis 1998 spectrum , we relied on the nonsimultaneous ghrs observations of c  iv and n  v to produce a model for this component . in this case , the column density ratio of n  v / c  iv was @xmath318 , which together with the actual columns yielded a high ionization parameter ( u @xmath4 2.4 ) , as well as the observed o  vii and o  viii column densities from earlier observations by _ asca _ ( reynolds 1997 ; george et al .",

    "based on the o  vi and h  i column densities in _ fuse _ observations of ngc  5548 , brotherton et al . ( 2002 ) found that component 1 could not be an x - ray warm absorber , and suggested that our original claim could be due in fact to nonsimultaneous observations .",

    "we reduced the stis spectra using the idl software developed at nasa s goddard space flight center for the stis instrument definition team .",
    "the data reduction includes a procedure to remove the background light from each order using a scattered light model devised by lindler ( 1998 ) .",
    "the individual orders in each echelle spectrum were spliced together in the regions of overlap .",
    "we found no evidence for variability in the e140 m spectra obtained on consecutive days , so we averaged these spectra together for further analysis .      to place the new spectra into context ,",

    "we measured continuum fluxes by averaging the points in a bin centered at 1360   ( observed frame ) with a width of 30  , and determined the one - sigma flux errors from the standard deviations .",
    "for the _ iue _ spectra , this method overestimates the errors ( clavel et al .",
    "1991 ) , and we therefore scaled them by a factor of 0.5 to ensure that observations taken on the same day agree to within the errors on average .",
    "figure 1 shows the uv continuum light curve of ngc 5548 , which spans a 24-year time period .",

    "the all - time low occurred on 1992 july 5 ( jd 2,448,809 ) at a flux level of f@xmath6(1360 ) @xmath4 1.07 ( @xmath70.17 ) x 10@xmath8 ergs s@xmath1 @xmath9 @xmath1 ( crenshaw , boggess , & wu 1993 ) , a factor of @xmath32 lower than our stis 2002 observation .    the ghrs fluxes in figure 1 are estimates , since the continuum regions surrounding the broad emission lines were not observed , due to the small wavelength coverage . in these cases",
    ", we used separate fits to the continua and broad emission lines from the stis spectra , and tried different linear combinations of these fits until we obtained an accurate match to the observed ghrs spectra .",
    "the inferred continuum levels for the two ghrs spectra are quite different : f@xmath6(1360 ) @xmath4 2.7 ( @xmath70.4 ) x 10@xmath8 and 5.6 ( @xmath70.4 ) x 10@xmath8 ergs s@xmath1 @xmath9 @xmath1 for the spectra of the n  v and c  iv regions , respectively .",
    "this has significant ramifications , since we assumed in our original modeling of the intrinsic absorption ( ck99 ) that the ghrs spectra were obtained in a similar state .",
    "we will discuss the implications of this result in subsequent sections .",
    "we have also retrieved the _ far - ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer _ spectrum of ngc  5548 , covering the range 905  1187  , which was obtained on 2000 june 7 ( jd 2,451,703 ) by brotherton et al . ( 2002 ) .",
    "the continuum level at this time was even lower than that of the stis 2002 spectrum . in the region of overlap",
    ", the stis 2002 spectrum has a continuum flux that is 1.5 times that of the _ fuse _ spectrum . in these low continuum states ,",
    "the broad emission - line fluxes are also low , and due to the resulting contrast , the contributions of the narrow - line region ( nlr ) to the emission - line profiles is much easier to determine .",
    "in particular , the narrow components of o  vi @xmath111031.9 , 1037.6 were identified in the _ fuse _ spectrum by brotherton et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , and the narrow components of ly@xmath2 @xmath12 1215.7 , c  iv @xmath111548.2 , 1550.8 , and c  iii ] @xmath121908.7 were previously identified and measured in the low - state fos spectrum by crenshaw et al .",
    "( 1993 ) , and are also easily detected in the stis 2002 spectra .      in figure 2",
    ", we show the c  iv profile from the three high - resolution spectra of this region , and label the kinematic components identified in our previous papers ( crenshaw et al .",
    "1999 ; ck99 ) .",
    "all of the previously identified components are still present in the new spectrum , but the strengths of some components have changed . as noted in ck99 , absorption components 1 and 3 showed evidence for a significant decrease in their c  iv and n  v columns between the ghrs 1996 and stis 1998 observations ( although we could only place an upper limit on the c iv column for component 1 in the stis 1998 data ) ; the other components were consistent with no change .",
    "this trend has continued @xmath34 years later ; components 1 and 3 are still highly variable , with substantial _",
    "increases _ in the c iv and n  v columns since the stis 1998 observation ( for n  v , compare figure 3 with plots in our earlier papers ) .",
    "thus , the pattern for components 1 and 3 has been an increase in ionic column densities with decreasing continuum flux . however , there are only three observations of each ion , and this does not prove a direct connection between column changes and variations in the ionizing flux ( see  4.5 ) .",
    "figure 3 shows a plot of the stis 2002 data in the regions where intrinsic absorption is detected . as in the past",
    ", absorption is detected in the lines of ly@xmath2 @xmath12 1215.7 , n  v @xmath11 1238.8 , 1242.8 , and c  iv @xmath111548.2 , 1550.8 . at this low state , and with a higher signal - to - noise spectrum",
    ", we have still not detected any absorption components from lower ionization lines , such as si  iv @xmath111393.8 , 1402.8 or mg  ii @xmath11 2796.3 , 3803.5 .",
    "component 6 , near the systemic velocity , is still only seen in ly@xmath2 , and is likely due to the interstellar medium or halo of the host galaxy ( ck99 ) .",
    "components 2 and 5 are relatively narrow and uncomplicated .",
    "there is considerable structure in components 1 , 3 , and 4 that has persisted over @xmath36 years .",
    "components 1 and 4 each show a strong subcomponent in their red wings , and component 3 appears to consist of at least three roughly equally - spaced subcomponents .",
    "figure 2 shows that it is the two subcomponents on either side of the central trough in component 3 that have increased dramatically in strength in the latest stis spectrum .",
    "the procedures we used to measure the absorption lines follow those of crenshaw et al .",
    "( 1999 ) . to determine the shape of the underlying emission , we fit cubic splines separately to the continuum and the emission lines . for the continuum",
    ", we fit four wavelength regions unaffected by emission or absorption features spanning the full range of the spectrum . for this low - state spectrum ,",
    "the broad and narrow emission components are easily distinguished by inflections in the profiles ( see also crenshaw et al .",
    "we therefore performed a single spline fit to each broad and narrow component of ly@xmath2 and c  iv , again using segments unaffected by other emission or absorption lines . to fit the n  v emission , which is relatively weak and blended with ly@xmath2 , we reproduced the c  iv broad and narrow profiles at their expected n  v positions ( assuming the flux ratio of n  v @xmath121238.8/@xmath121242.8 @xmath4 2 ) , and scaled the profiles until a suitable fit was obtained .",
    "we note that our philosophy is to use the lowest reasonable emission - line profiles needed to fit the regions surrounding the absorption accurately . to normalize the absorption profiles , we divided the observed spectra by our spline fits .",
    "as described in crenshaw et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , we determined uncertainties in the absorption parameters from photon statistics and different reasonable placements of the continuum and emission - line profiles .",
    "figure 3 shows our fits to the spectrum .",
    "we also show the narrow emission - line profiles separately , in order to gauge their fluxes above zero as a function of radial velocity .",
    "the narrow - line profile of c  iv ( and likely n  v ) has a strong blue tail , which is common for seyfert galaxies ( vrtilek & carleton 1985 ) , particularly for high - ionization lines from the inner nlr ( kraemer & crenshaw 2000 ) .",
    "the ly@xmath2 profile shows a small bump in its red wing  the nature of the bump is uncertain .",
    "the centroids of the n  v and c  iv profiles are shifted to the red , relative to ly@xmath2 .",
    "this is due to the contribution from the weaker member of the doublets in emission , which is most noticable in n  v.    an important aspect of figure 3 is that it shows that component 4 dips below the narrow emission profiles in all three ions .",
    "arav et al .",
    "( 2002 ) find that in the earlier stis data , their fits to the narrow - line profiles just skim the bottom of the absorption troughs from component 4 .",
    "these authors suggest that the narrow emission lines are therefore not covered by the absorption components , and that component 4 in particular is likely to be heavily saturated .",
    "however , with the advantage of having a low - state spectrum , we find that the fluxes of the narrow - line profiles do exceed the troughs of component 4 . thus , _",
    "at least _ a portion of the nlr in this small aperture ( 02 x 02 ) is covered by absorption component 4 .",
    "table 3 shows our measurements of the radial velocity centroids , widths ( fwhm ) , and covering factors for each component .",
    "the radial velocities , widths , and associated one - sigma uncertainties are based on averages of the unblended components in n  v and c  iv .",
    "a comparison with our results on the previous ghrs and stis observations ( ck99 ) shows that the velocity centroids have not changed ( outside of the uncertainties ) over the previous six years .",
    "however , the widths of components 1 and 3 have increased substantially since the first stis observations : from 85 to 222 km s@xmath1 for component 1 and from 78 to 159 km s@xmath1 for component 3 .",
    "we attribute these increases in fwhm to increases in the depths of the subcomponents , relative to the central cores .",
    "we find that the widths of these components at the continuum level did _ not _ change , which supports our conclusion that the increases in fwhm are due to changes in the ionic columns rather than changes in the coverage of velocity space by the components .",
    "in addition to the above measurements , we have taken advantage of the higher signal - to - noise ratio of the stis 2002 spectrum to determine the covering factors ( c@xmath13 ) for the cores of several components .",
    "we used the technique of hamann et al .",
    "( 1997 ) for doublets to determine c@xmath13 , which is the fraction of continuum plus emission that is occulted by the absorber in our line of sight .",
    "since we have no information to the contrary , our measurements implicitly assume that the continuum , broad emission , and narrow emission are equally covered by each absorption component .",
    "figure 2 shows that the only component of absorption in c  iv that is not blended with another is component 4",
    ". however , for n  v , the doublets of 2 , 3 , and 4 are clean ( n  v@xmath121242.8 component 5 is blended with n  v@xmath121238.8 component 1 , see crenshaw et al .",
    "furthermore , the wings of these components are blended with those from other components .",
    "thus , we can only reliably determine covering factors for the cores of components 2 , 3 , and 4 .",
    "our derived covering factors are given in table 3 .",
    "components 2 , 3 , and 4 all show nonunity covering factors in their cores ; previously , we had only been able to determine that component 4 had a nonunity covering factor ( crenshaw et al .",
    "the actual values in this table are from the n  v doublet , whereas the lower limits are from the residual intensities in l@xmath2 .",
    "these values are consistent with our estimates or lower limits from the previous ghrs and stis spectra .",
    "gabel et al .",
    "( 2003 ) show that it is possible for the total covering factor ( i.e. , that for continuum plus emission ) to differ among different lines ( e.g. , c  iv and n  v ) .",
    "this effect arises as a result of different covering factors for the continuum and emission - line regions , combined with different contributions of the continuum and emission - line fluxes to the underlying emission .",
    "the only direct test that we have of this effect is for component 4 ; in this case we find that the covering factors from the c  iv doublet is 0.91 @xmath7 0.03 , which is the same as that from the n  v doublet to within the errors . for components 2 and 3",
    ", we must assume that the c  iv covering factors are the same as those derived for n  v. since we can not measure covering factors for components 1 and 5 , we assume that c@xmath13 @xmath4 1 for these two components .",
    "brotherton et al .",
    "( 2002 ) independently derived covering factors for the o  vi absorption components , and their values agree with ours to within the uncertainties .",
    "in addition , they obtained c@xmath13 @xmath4 0.98 ( @xmath70.12 ) and 0.94 ( @xmath70.14 ) for components 1 and 5 , respectively , which indicates that our assumption of unity covering factors for these two components is a reasonable one .",
    "to determine the ionic column densities for each component , we converted each normalized profile to optical depth as a function of radial velocity , and integrated across the profile , as described in crenshaw et al .",
    "( 1999 ) . for components 2 , 3 and 4",
    ", we determined the optical depths using the measured c@xmath13 values and the formalism of hamann et al .",
    "for the other components , we assumed c@xmath13 @xmath4 1 . as we stated in the preceding paragraph",
    ", this appears to be a reasonable assumption for components 1 and 5 , and a necessary assumption for component 6 if it is indeed due to the interstellar medium or halo of the host galaxy .",
    "we list the ionic column densities for each component in table 4 . for the ghrs and stis 1998 spectra ,",
    "we have remeasured the columns for components 2 , 3 , and 4 assuming the covering factors we determined from the stis 2002 spectra .",
    "we give upper limits to the si  iv absorption , since they provide useful constraints for the photoionization models .",
    "we consider the h  i column densities from l@xmath2 to be lower limits .",
    "as mentioned in ck99 , the components are more blended in ly@xmath2 than those in the other lines and are therefore more heavily saturated .",
    "furthermore , the h  i column densities from ly@xmath14 in the fuse spectrum ( brotherton et al . 2002 ) are 5 8 times higher than the values in table 1 .",
    "it is unlikely that this could be due to variability of the h  i column alone , since we do nt see evidence for strong variations in other lines of components 2 , 4 , and 5 .",
    "the most straightforward explanation is that the ly@xmath2 lines are indeed heavily saturated , and our measurements are lower limits .",
    "it would be interesting to obtain a longer _ fuse _ exposure to detect higher - order lyman lines , to check for saturation in ly@xmath14 .",
    "to investigate the effects of the nonunity covering factors on the measured ionic columns , we compared the values in table 4 with those we determined previously for the ghrs and stis 1998 data ( ck99 ) .",
    "this comparison reveals that the remeasured c  iv columns are 1.2 to 1.5 times larger than those previously determined assuming c@xmath13 @xmath4 1 .",
    "the effects on the n  v measurements are the same or slightly larger ; the remeasured n  v columns are 1.2 to 1.9 times larger .",
    "our earlier statements on absorption variability based on the observed spectra are borne out by the measurements in table 4 .",
    "component 1 shows huge ( factor of 6  10 ) changes in the n  v and c  iv column densities , and component 3 shows significant ( factor of @xmath32 ) variations in both ions .",
    "other components show no evidence or only marginal evidence for column density variations , given the uncertainties .",
    "for the first time , we have direct measurements of the n  v and c  iv column densities in component 1 from simultaneous observations ( the ghrs observations were not simultaneous , and the previous stis observation could only place a lower limit on the c iv column ) .",
    "thus , we are able to check our previous suggestion that component 1 might be the x - ray warm absorber , based on its high n  v / c  iv ratio ( @xmath4 18 ) from the ghrs observations . in table 4",
    ", we see that component 1 s n  v / c  iv ratio in the stis 2002 spectrum is only 2.5 , which is close to the ratios for components 2 , 4 , and 5 . based on our models (  4 ) , this value does not produce significant o  vii or o  viii columns , and component 1 in the stis 2002 spectrum _ can not _ be an x - ray warm absorber at that epoch .",
    "given this finding , we can no longer assume that the ghrs n  v / c  iv ratio provides an appropriate constraint on the physical conditions in component 1 .",
    "the ionic column densities in table 4 are strongly variable over 2  4 years , and it is certainly possible that they varied over the six - month interval between the ghrs observations .",
    "furthermore , in  2.2 we showed that the ghrs c  iv and n  v observations were obtained at different continuum states , so that one can not call upon a similar ionization state of the gas as a reason for using this ratio . finally , photoionization models of component 1 using simultaneous observations of the o  vi and ly@xmath14 absorption in _ fuse _ data ( brotherton et al .",
    "2002 ) indicate that this component has an ionization parameter too low to be a warm absorber at the epoch of observation ( 2000 june 7 ) .",
    "thus , there is no longer any significant evidence that component 1 is , or was , a warm absorber .",
    "note that this does not rule out the presence of x - ray absorption from a component of more highly ionized gas at this radial velocity , and in fact , kaastra et al .",
    "( 2002 ) present such evidence based on c  vi absorption in _ cxo _ spectra at the same approximate radial velocity as component 1 ( see  4.4 ) .",
    "furthermore , in our simultaneous hetgs spectrum , the high ionization si xiv ly@xmath2 line is dominated by a velocity component compatible with uv component 1 ( paper ii ) .    as noted earlier , arav et al .",
    "( 2002 ) suggest that the narrow emission lines in the stis aperture are not covered by the absorption components .",
    "they conclude that component 4 , which has the deepest troughs , is therefore much more saturated than it appears . in particular , they suggest that the c  iv column densities for component 4 are at least four times greater than we had previously measured ( crenshaw et al .",
    "1999 ) . however , with the new low - state stis spectrum , we find that the peaks of the narrow - line profiles do extend above the troughs of component 4 in each line ( l@xmath2 , c  iv , and n  v )",
    ". thus , _ at least _ a portion of the nlr is occulted by the uv absorber associated with component 4 .",
    "as discussed earlier , the inclusion of nonunity covering factors does increase the measured column densities , but only by a factor of 1.2 to 1.9 .",
    "in particular , the c  iv column density for component 4 increased by a factor of only 1.2 with the inclusion of the nonunity covering factor .",
    "thus , we find no evidence for the severe underestimation of column densities suggested by arav et al .",
    "( 2002 ) .",
    "there are a couple of caveats that we should mention concerning the above discussion .",
    "first , we have implicitly assumed that the continuum source , blr , and nlr are all covered by the same fraction , but it could be that only the nlr is partially covered . in the latter case , one could devise emission - line profiles for the uncovered nlr that skim the bottoms of the component 4 troughs , and thereby produce much higher ionic column densities ; however , we have no evidence that this is actually the case .",
    "second , we have not been able to accurately determine the variation of covering factor as a function of radial velocity for any component , due to a combination of blending and insufficient signal - to - noise .",
    "thus , the column densities could be higher if the covering factor decreases in the wings .",
    "however , we expect this effect would be small , since it seems unlikely that saturation effects in the wings would be as large as those in the troughs , which are not severe . an accurate determination of the covering factor as a function of radial velocity should be possible with a substantially longer exposure time .    for the _ fuse _ data , brotherton et al .",
    "( 2002 ) generated fits to the o vi emission profile assuming a `` covered nlr '' and an``uncovered nlr '' case , and prefer the uncovered case .",
    "however , it looks to us as though the nlr flux from either fit exceeds the trough of component 4 , and the covered nlr is therefore preferable . in addition , the width of their narrow o vi profile is @xmath3400 km s@xmath1 for the uncovered case and @xmath3650 km s@xmath1 for the covered case ; the latter is similar to our values of @xmath3700 km s@xmath1 for c  iv and 590 km s@xmath1 for ly@xmath2 .",
    "thus , it appears that the covered case is much more likely for o vi , as well as the other lines .",
    "however , we can not rule out the possibility that some fraction of the narrow o  vi emission is not covered , particularly in the large ( 30@xmath15 x 30@xmath15 ) _ fuse _ aperture .    in figure 4",
    ", we show the _ fuse _ spectrum in the region of the o  vi lines .",

    "( 2002 ) that the gas responsible for the uv absorption in component 1 can not produce the observed x - ray absorption . again",
    ", this does not exclude the presence of more highly ionized gas at the same velocity .",
    "table 6 also lists the observed columns of h  i and o  vi from the _ fuse _ spectrum ( brotherton et al . 2002 ) obtained @xmath319 months earlier .",
    "based on similar velocity coverages , we have added their components 0.5 and 1 together for our component 1 , and combined their components 2.5 and 3 for our component 3 .",
    "as noted previously , we use the o  vi value for component 3 as a lower limit .",
    "although we were able to obtain good fits to the n  v and c  iv columns and a reasonable match to the h  i columns ( except for component 3 ) , the dust - free models predict o  vi columns far in excess of those measured , by similar factors of 6  8 .",
    "this discrepancy can not be due to the ionizing continuum used in the model since , unless there is extreme structure in the ionizing continuum in the vicinity of the o  v ( 113.9 ev ) and o  vi ( 138.1ev ) threshold energies , the model predictions for n@xmath34 do not depend strongly on sed .",
    "we consider it highly unlikely that variability could be the main source of the o  vi discrepancies , for the following reasons .",
    "1 ) none of the other ions show significant variability in components 2 , 4 , and 5 .",
    "2 ) the _ fuse _ spectrum was in a lower continuum state than that for the stis 2002 spectrum , which would result in even higher predicted o  vi columns for components 1 and 3 , according to our models .",
    "3 ) it seems very unlikely that the observed o  vi columns would all be low by roughly the same amount as a result of extreme decreases in the total column density for each component during this epoch .",
    "thus , it seems reasonable that these models severely overpredict the o  vi columns , even though the observations are not simultaneous .",
    "brotherton et al .",
    "( 2002 ) suggested that models based on n@xmath30/n@xmath29 alone may be unreliable due to super - solar nitrogen abundances .",
    "we investigate this possibility in the next section and the possibility that the discrepancies can be explained by depletion ( primarily of carbon ) into dust grains in  4.3 .",
    "we generated a second set of models with a nitrogen abundance that is two times solar , and assumed that the enhanced nitrogen is at the expense of carbon alone .",
    "this is the simplest reasonable adjustment of elemental abundances that can be made , for the following reason .",
    "if enrichment of the interstellar medium above solar abundances is due to intermediate - mass stars , the carbon gets converted to nitrogen first through the cno process , whereas the oxygen goes to nitrogen at later times and higher temperatures ( maeder & meynet 1989 ) .",
    "thus , for these models , we keep the same abundances as before , except that c @xmath4 2.2 x 10@xmath27 and n @xmath4 2.4 x 10@xmath27 by number relative to h.    the model results are listed in tables 5 and 6 under the designation `` 2xn '' .",
    "we were able to match the observed n  v and c  iv columns as before to well within the measurement errors ( and n@xmath31 is @xmath32 10@xmath33 @xmath9 in all cases ) .",
    "furthermore , we have obtained a reasonable ( within a factor of two ) match to the n@xmath34 for components 1 , 2 , 4 , and 5 , as well as a value for component 3 that is consistent with the lower limit .",
    "in addition , the predicted h  i column for component 3 is much closer to the observed value from _ fuse_. as can be seen in table 5 , the principal effect of enhancing nitrogen and depleting carbon is that the ionization parameter and column density of each component must be lowered substantially to match the observed n  v / c  iv ratio and their columns .",
    "the values for u and n@xmath16 are now in approximate agreement with those determined by brotherton et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , except for component 3 .",
    "based on the high n@xmath30/n@xmath29 ratio ( @xmath4 9.2 ) for component 3 , we determined a much larger column density and ionization parameter than did brotherton et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , and our prediction for n@xmath34 is @xmath38 times greater than their estimate .",
    "however , given evidence that the o  vi absorption is heavily saturated and the quoted column density is a lower limit , our prediction is consistent with the observations .",
    "thus , for all of the components , the enhanced nitrogen models provide a reasonably good match to all of the ionic columns .",
    "we generated a third set of models that starts with solar abundances , but includes dust within the uv absorbers .",
    "we assumed the following depletions from solar - abundance gas phase ( see snow & witt 1996 ) : c , 65% ; o , 25% ; mg , 80% ; si , 94% ; and fe , 95% ( n is not depleted ) .",
    "the results are listed in tables 5 and 6 under the designation `` dusty '' .",
    "again , we were able to match the observed n  v and c  iv columns , the n@xmath34 for components 1 , 2 , 4 , and 5 , and the lower limit to n@xmath34 in component 3 .",
    "the predicted h  i columns are also close to the _ fuse _ values .",
    "thus , the dusty uv models provide an equally good match to the ionic columns as those provided by the enhanced nitrogen models .",
    "the ionization parameters are nearly identical for the two cases , whereas the n@xmath35 columns for the dusty models are 2  3 times those of the enhanced nitrogen models .    as noted above , in kraemer et al .",
    "( 1998 ) we estimated an intrinsic reddening of the nlr in ngc  5548 of e@xmath24 @xmath26 0.04  mag . assuming a galactic ratio of reddening to the total hydrogen column ( see shull & van steenberg 1985 )",
    ", this corresponds to a total hydrogen column density of 2.1 x 10@xmath36 @xmath9 .",
    "this in remarkable agreement with our total model hydrogen column of 2.3 x 10@xmath37@xmath9 . hence , it is possible that the reddening of the continuum and emission lines occurs in the same gas in which the uv absorption lines arise .",
    "kraemer et al . ( 1998 ) place the high - ionization inner nlr at a distance of @xmath31 pc from the central source , which is comfortably outside the dust sublimation radius ( r@xmath38 ) . following barvainis ( 1987 ) , and assuming a dust sublimation temperature of 1500  k ( salpeter 1997 ) , r@xmath38 @xmath4 1.3 x l@xmath39 , where l@xmath40 is the uv  x - ray luminosity of the central source in units of 10@xmath41 erg s@xmath1 . based on our continuum fit ,",
    "l@xmath40 @xmath26 0.01 , and hence r@xmath38 @xmath3 0.13 pc , which is well inside the inner nlr and the majority of the uv absorbing gas .      from our contemporaneous _ cxo _ letgs spectrum ( see paper ii ) , we determined an o  vi column density of 2 x 10@xmath42 @xmath9 from the absorption lines at 21.79   and 22.01  .",
    "we predict a total n@xmath34 @xmath4 1.1 x 10@xmath42 @xmath9 for the nitrogen - enhanced models and 1.8 x 10@xmath43@xmath9 for the dusty models , mostly from component 3 , which are close to the letgs value .",
    "this suggests that at least half of the observed o  vi column comes from the absorbers detected in the uv .",
    "notably , brotherton et al .",
    "( 2002 ) derive a total n@xmath34 @xmath26 4.1 x 10@xmath44 @xmath9 , significantly below the letgs - derived value , which we suggest is further evidence that the o  vi lines in component 3 are saturated .",
    "regarding the `` classic '' warm absorbers , the total o  vii and o  viii columns from the contemporaneous _ cxo _ spectrum are 5 x 10@xmath45 @xmath9 and 1.5 x 10@xmath46 @xmath9 , respectively .",
    "the uv components do not make significant contributions to the o  vii ( @xmath47 15% ) and o  viii ( @xmath47 1% ) columns , confirming the presence of more highly ionized gas than found in the uv .    in kaastra et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , the c  vi ly@xmath2 line detected in the 1999 letgs spectrum was fitted using a sum of narrow components at the velocities of the five uv absorbers .",
    "the c  vi profile in our contemporaneous letgs spectrum shows less structure ( see paper ii ) , and it was best fit with three velocity components at @xmath01050 km s@xmath1 , @xmath0520 km s@xmath1 , and @xmath0160 km s@xmath1 .",
    "the combined c  vi column density from these components is 1.4 x 10@xmath45 @xmath9 . based on our dusty uv models ,",
    "only component 3 possesses a significant c  vi column ( 7.4 x 10@xmath44 @xmath9 for the nitrogen - enhanced model , 1.3 x 10@xmath42 @xmath9 for the dusty model ) , and thus the uv components contribute @xmath4710% of the observed c  vi . since c  vi requires a substantially higher ionization potential for its creation than o  vi ( 392.1 ev and 113.9 ev , respectively ) ,",
    "this is an indication of more highly ionized gas _ at the radial velocities of the uv absorbers _ , as also seen in ngc 3783 ( kaspi et al .",
    "2002 ) and mrk 509 ( yaqoob et al .",
    "2003 ; kraemer et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "as noted previously , components 1 and 3 show strong variations in their ionic columns , whereas the other components show little evidence for variations .",
    "as in ck99 , we can ask if the ionic column variations can be attributed to either variable ionization or variable total column ( e.g. , from bulk motion of gas across the line of sight ) . as shown in figure 1 , different uv continuum flux levels",
    "were observed in the four high - resolution spectra of ngc 5548 , with the ghrs  civ and stis 1998 spectra taken during relatively high states and the ghrs n  v and stis 2002 spectra taken during low states .",
    "if the absorbers respond to changes in the ionizing continuum , we would expect both _",
    "n  v and c  iv columns and _ larger _ n@xmath30/n@xmath29 ratios during high flux states .",
    "this is clearly not the case for component 3 ; although the columns are smaller in 1998 compared to 2002 , the n  v / c  iv ratio is smaller as well ( 6.8 in 1998 compared to 9.2 in 2002 ) .",
    "although we only have an upper limit for n@xmath29 in the stis 1998 data for component 1 , n@xmath30 requires an ionizing continuum a factor of @xmath36 higher during the stis 1998 observations .",
    "however , the observed uv flux was only 3.4 times as bright .",
    "hence , either the amplitude of the variations in the euv ionizing radiation is about twice as large as that in the uv , or the observed changes in the ionic columns for component 1 are not consistent with the changes in the continuum flux .",
    "given the lack of response of the absorbers to changes in the continuum flux ( with the possible exception of component 1 ) we can derive upper limits to their electron densities and lower limits to their distances from the central continuum source .",
    "the timescale for the recombination of an ion x@xmath48 is given by the following expression ( krolik & kriss 1995 ; bottorff , korista , & shlosman 2001 ) : @xmath49^{-1},\\ ] ] where @xmath50 is the recombination coefficient for ion @xmath51 , @xmath52 ) is the fraction of element @xmath53 in ionization state @xmath54 , and n@xmath55 is the electron density .",

    ", we obtain the following upper limits on electron density : for component 3 , 15 @xmath22 and 50 @xmath22 ( from c  iv and n  v , respectively ) ; for the lower ionization components , we obtain 150 @xmath22 and 650 @xmath22 . based on our estimate of the central source luminosity above the lyman limit ( see kraemer et al .",
    "1998 ) and our ionization parameters , the lower limit to the radial distances of the low ionization components is between 20 and 250 pc , while that for component 3 is between 150 and 250 pc from the central source .",
    "these constraints place the absorbers at large enough distances that they may cover much of the entire nlr .",
    "however , we note that the continuum and absorption variations are obviously not well characterized , with just a few high - resolution observations widely separated in time .",
    "since the ionic columns for components 2 , 4 , and 5 have not varied significantly , despite large variations in the continuum fluxes , the above constraints are likely valid . for the variable components 1 and 3 , however , we can not rule out changes in ionization in response to unobserved continuum variations on time scales smaller than years .",
    "thus , we consider the limits on the densities and radial locations of components 1 and 3 to be loose constraints ; more frequent monitoring at high spectral resolution are needed to test them .",
    "since there is no clear signature of a response to the changes in the continuum flux , we can investigate whether or not the variations in ionic column densities are consistent with changes in the total column densities of the absorbers . pursuing this , we generated sets of nitrogen - enhanced and dusty models for components 2  5 in the stis 1998 data , with the same ionization parameters used for the stis 2002 models , but adjusting the total column densities ( see table 7 ) . in each case",
    ", the predictions for n@xmath29 and n@xmath30 match the measured values to within the measurement errors .",
    "components 2 , 4 , and 5 show only small changes in the total columns , consistent with our earlier claims of no or marginal variability of these components .",
    "component 3 shows a much smaller column in the 1998 data , and the agreement between observed and predicted columns indicates that the variations are likely dominated by changes in the total column ( by a factor of @xmath32.6 ) . we did not attempt to model component 1 , since we only had an upper limit for n@xmath29 from the stis 1998 spectra",
    "of course , we can reproduce the observed n  v column in 1998 by reducing the total column of gas by a factor of @xmath36 .",
    "obviously , the larger c  iv and n  v columns in components 1 and 3 for the two ghrs observations ( compared to the stis 1998 values ) could also be attributed to changes in the total columns , but we have no constraints on possible ionization changes .",
    "new _ hst _ stis echelle spectra , combined with simultaneous _ cxo _ observations , place tighter constraints on the uv absorbers of ngc  5548 than were possible in the past .",
    "simultaneous detection and measurement of the c  iv and n  v absorption lines in component 1 show that this component is _ not _ an x - ray warm absorber , in agreement with the conclusion of brotherton et al .",
    "( 2002 ) based on _ fuse _ observations of o  vi and ly@xmath14 , and despite our earlier claim based on nonsimultaneous ghrs observations ( ck99 ) .",
    "the new stis observations were obtained when the uv continuum and broad emission lines fluxes were low , allowing us to easily distinguish the narrow components of the emission lines .",
    "we present direct evidence that uv absorption component 4 covers at least a portion of the nlr .",
    "our derivation of the covering factors indicates that our previous c  iv and n  v column densities were underestimated by factors of 1.2  1.9 , and not the @xmath584 factors suggested by arav et al .",
    "( 2002 ) .",
    "our dust - free , solar - abundance models of the uv absorbers in the stis 2002 data match the c  iv and n  v columns well , but they severely overpredict the observed o  vi columns in the nonsimultaneous _ fuse _ data .",
    "models that include enhanced nitrogen or elemental depletion into dust , in both cases reducing the carbon in gas phase , provide reasonable ( within a factor of two ) matches to the o  vi columns .",
    "absorption lines ( or lack thereof ) from heavier refractory elements that tend to be depleted into dust ( e.g. , fe , mg , si ) , would be extremely useful for discriminating between these two models , but unfortunately there are no suitable high - ionization lines from these elements in the uv .",
    "in particular , si  iv , with a creation ionization potential of 33.5 ev , has an insignificant column even in our dust - free models .",
    "if the dusty models are correct , then the total hydrogen column from the absorbers is exactly the amount needed to redden the inner nlr by the observed amount , e(b@xmath0v ) @xmath4 0.04 ( kraemer et al .",
    "1998 ) , assuming a galactic dust - to - gas ratio .",
    "this is a piece of evidence in favor of the dusty models , although it is possible that the nlr clouds provide their own reddening .",
    "there is strong evidence for dust in uv absorbers at distances of @xmath57100 pc in ngc  3227 ( crenshaw et al . 2001 ) and akn  564 ( crenshaw et al .",
    "2002 ) . however , in these cases , the absorbers appear at radial velocities close to systemic and are probably due to the host galaxy , as opposed to the outflowing absorbers seen in ngc  5548 .",
    "our absorber models indicate that none of the uv components contribute significantly to the o  vii and o  viii columns seen in the x - rays , in agreement with the conclusions of brotherton et al .",
    "( 2002 ) . hence",
    ", none of the uv absorbers is a classic x - ray warm absorber .",
    "however , the uv components , particularly the higher ionization component 3 , do contribute @xmath5850% of the o  vi column and 5  10% of the c  vi column measured in the _ cxo _ spectra ( paper ii ) .    regarding the source of the ionic column variations in components 1 and 3 ,",
    "we come to the same conclusions as in ck99 .",
    "the variations in component 3 are dominated by changes in the total column density , whereas those in component 1 are probably dominated by column changes , although we can not rule out variable ionization of the gas for this component . as discussed in ck99 , changes in total column due to bulk motion of the gas across our line of sight in ngc  5548 require transverse velocities of @xmath3 1500 km s@xmath1 .",
    "there are a couple of indications that the uv components 2 , 4 , and 5 are at significant distances from the active nucleus of ngc  5548 .",
    "we have presented direct evidence that component 4 covers at least a portion of the high - ionization , inner nlr , at a distance of @xmath31 pc from the central continuum source ( kraemer et al 1998 ) .",
    "also , these absorbers apparently do not respond to continuum variations over time scales of years , which suggests that they are at distances between 20 and 250 pc from the nucleus .",
    "desirable observations in the future include coordinated uv and fuv observations at high spectral resolution , to check our conclusions on the nonsolar abundances in the gas phase of the absorbers .",

    "<S> we present new uv spectra of the nucleus of the seyfert 1 galaxy ngc  5548 , which we obtained with the space telescope imaging spectrograph at high spectral resolution , in conjunction with simultaneous _ chandra x - ray observatory _ spectra . </S>",
    "<S> taking advantage of the low uv continuum and broad emission - line fluxes , we have determined that the deepest uv absorption component covers at least a portion of the inner , high - ionization narrow - line region ( nlr ) . </S>",
    "<S> we find nonunity covering factors in the cores of several kinematic components , which increase the column density measurements of n  v and c  iv by factors of 1.2 to 1.9 over the full - covering case ; however , the revised columns have only a minor effect on the parameters derived from our photoionization models . </S>",
    "<S> for the first time , we have simultaneous n  v and c  iv columns for component 1 ( at @xmath01040 km s@xmath1 ) , and find that this component _ can not _ be an x - ray warm absorber , contrary to our previous claim based on nonsimultaneous observations . </S>",
    "<S> we find that models of the absorbers based on solar abundances severely overpredict the o  vi columns previously obtained with the _ far ultraviolet spectrograph _ , and present arguments that this is not likely due to variability . </S>",
    "<S> however , models that include either enhanced nitrogen ( twice solar ) or dust , with strong depletion of carbon in either case , are successful in matching all of the observed ionic columns . </S>",
    "<S> these models result in substantially lower ionization parameters and total column densities compared to dust - free solar - abundance models , and produce little o  vii or o  viii , indicating that none of the uv absorbers are x - ray warm absorbers . </S>"
