    "suppose that a stationary poisson process of intensity @xmath0 exists in the plane , with seeds marked either @xmath1 ( east growing ) with probability @xmath2 or @xmath3 ( south growing ) with probability @xmath4 .",
    "these seeds produce rays growing at a constant rate in directions matching their label ( @xmath1 or @xmath3 ) .",
    "rays end their growth at the instant that the growing tip meets another ray .",
    "our aim is to investigate the terminal length distribution of an east growing test ray , whose seed location we take to be the origin @xmath5 .",
    "the seeds that are relevant for the test ray lie in the _ unbounded _ octant between the lines @xmath6 and @xmath7 , with @xmath8 : we call this region , the initial _ live zone_.    we construct a stopping set process @xcite by expanding a domain  an isosceles right angle triangle ( see figure [ trapss ] )  into the live zone , stopping when it hits the first seed @xmath9 whose coordinates relative to @xmath5 are @xmath10 .",
    "this creates a domain @xmath11 with area @xmath12 that is exponentially distributed .",
    "if @xmath9 is @xmath3type , then it will provide the ray that blocks the test seed ; thus @xmath13 and no other seeds need be considered .    alternatively if @xmath9 is @xmath1type , then , instead of growing @xmath11 ( retaining its shape as an isosceles right  angle triangle ) , we remove a part of the live zone : a ` dead zone ' labelled @xmath14 ( see figure [ trapss ] ) which has now become irrelevant . as @xmath15 has been constructed without drawing upon any information taken from outside @xmath15 , the point process in the remaining region ( the new _ live zone _ ) is still a poisson process with unchanged intensity given the information within @xmath16 .",
    "we now grow a trapezium whose left ",
    "hand side located at @xmath17 has length @xmath18 .",
    "the trapezium expands until its right  hand side first hits a seed @xmath19 ( in the new live zone ) .",
    "the stopping set formed is called @xmath20 .",
    "it has an exponentially distributed area @xmath21 .",
    "trapezoidal stopping sets and dead zones in the half model .",
    ", width=8 ]    we proceed in this way , forming a sequence of stopping sets ( illustrated in figure [ trapss ] ) with independent exponentially  distributed areas .",
    "the sequence possesses a recursive structure , which we can exploit .",
    "it is also important to note that the first @xmath3type seed will provide the ray which blocks the test ray . without our introduction of dead zones ,",
    "a complicated algorithm would be required to check if a @xmath3type ray actually reaches the path of the test ray .    * the recursive structure commencing with a generic live zone : * suppose that we begin observing the process when the live zone has left boundary of height @xmath22 and when we are about to construct @xmath23 . in figure [ trapss ]",
    ", we draw the case @xmath24 . the probability density function for the length , @xmath25 , of @xmath23 s base , conditional on the height @xmath22 of its left boundary , follows from the exponential distribution of @xmath23 s area @xmath26 .",
    "it is therefore : @xmath27 if the stopping seed @xmath28 for set @xmath23 is @xmath3type , then its south ray will be the first to intersect the test ray and the process ends .",
    "otherwise , another dead zone is created and further trapezoidal stopping sets are formed until a @xmath3type is met .",
    "let @xmath29 be the random variable equal to the horizontal distance covered by stopping sets until the process comes to an end .",

    "the first term accounts for the case where the first seed is v  type , and the second term for the case where it is h  type and the process is effectively re  started with a different boundary condition having already covered some horizontal distance .",
    "note that the ray length probability density function is @xmath33 .",
    "we define the moment generating function of the conditional density @xmath34 : @xmath35 which , from equation ( [ condensity ] ) , satisfies the integral equation : @xmath36 dr.\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] to solve this equation we use the following method .",

    "this function is found by substituting the solution back into the integral equation evaluated at @xmath7 .",
    "commencing with the first part of our method , we note that the second term of ( [ m1 ] ) contains the integral : @xmath38 we may now simplify the second term using integration by parts : @xmath39 dr = \\\\ e^{\\frac{1}{2}(y - t)^2 } \\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi}{2 } } \\left [ \\textrm{erfc } \\left(\\frac{y - t}{\\sqrt{2 } } \\right ) \\int_0^y m_t(u ) du + \\int_y^\\infty \\textrm{erfc } \\left(\\frac{u - t}{\\sqrt{2 } } m_t(u ) du \\right ) \\right].\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] evaluating the integral in the first term of ( [ m1 ] ) , and then combining both terms in together we obtain : @xmath40 \\\\",

    "because all the @xmath37 derivatives of this function , evaluated at @xmath45 , diverge as @xmath46 , we may discard it from the solution on the grounds that for all @xmath47 , @xmath48 . the second term in the solution , a generalisation of the hermite polynomials , @xmath49 , to non - integer @xmath50 , is in fact a combination of kummer functions with the correct asymptotic behaviour @xcite . for our purposes",
