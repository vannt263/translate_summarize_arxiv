    "photospheric convection and the coronal magnetic field play a key role in heating the solar corona . for the magnetically confined ( closed ) regions of the corona",
    "it has long been suggested that small heating events , dubbed _ nanoflares _ , continuously deposit energy at the small scales and can contribute a substantial fraction of the total heating @xcite .    the slow photospheric motions ( with a timescale @xmath0 8 minutes , magnitude @xmath1 , and correlation scale @xmath2 ) transfer energy from the photosphere into the corona shuffling the footpoints of the magnetic field lines . the work done by the denser photospheric plasma on the magnetic field lines footpoints injects energy into the corona , mostly as magnetic energy .",
    "the perturbations generated at the photospheric level propagate along the loop at the alfvn speed . in a coronal loop",
    "the alfvn velocity associated to the strong axial magnetic field @xmath3 is @xmath4 ( @xmath5 is the average mass density ) , and considering a typical loop length @xmath6 we obtain for the alfvn crossing time @xmath7 . the crossing time is therefore significantly smaller than the photospheric timescale : @xmath8 .",
    "furthermore as magnetic pressure largely exceeds plasma pressure the plasma @xmath9 is small ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "because of the _ fast alfvn timescale _ and _ low _ @xmath11 the dynamics of the magnetically confined solar corona are generally approximated as a _ quasi - static evolution through a sequence of equilibria _ , with instabilities leading the system from an equilibrium to the next one through relaxation @xcite . within this framework",
    "many works have studied the relaxation dynamics in detail ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "on the other hand it has been shown that in some instances the validity of that picture is not valid , e.g. , in reduced magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) simulations of the parker model for coronal heating @xcite .",
    "in fact that approximation is attained neglecting the velocity and plasma pressure in the mhd equations whose solution is then bound to be a static force - free equilibrium .",
    "but the self - consistent evolution of the plasma pressure and velocity , although _ small _ compared with the dominant axial magnetic field @xmath3 ( and therefore very close in first approximation to the equilibrium solution of a uniform axial magnetic field ) , does not bind the system to force - free equilibria and allows the development of turbulent nonlinear dynamics with formation of field - aligned current sheets where a significant heating occurs .",
    "most numerical simulations of a simple model coronal loop in cartesian geometry threaded by a strong magnetic field shuffled at the top and bottom plates by photospheric motions have used as boundary velocity an incompressible field with all wavenumbers of order @xmath12 excited @xcite : in real space this corresponds to distorted vortices with length - scale @xmath13 one next to the other filling the whole photospheric plane ( * ? ? ?",
    "* figures  1 and 2 )",
    ". this configuration does not give rise to instabilities .",
    "the system transitions smoothly from the linear to the nonlinear stage where integrated physical quantities like energies and dissipation fluctuate around a mean value in what is best described as a statistically steady state and the energy deposited at the small scales is approximately in the _ nanoflare _ range for the numerous heating events .",
    "this disordered vortical forcing mimics a uniform and homogeneous convection and the resulting coronal dynamics give rise to a basal background coronal heating within the lower limit of the observational constraint .    with this kind of forcing the system",
    "is not able to accumulate a significant amount of magnetic energy to be subsequently released in more substantial heating events like _ microflares _ and _ flares_. it is therefore pivotal to implement different kinds of photospheric forcings to understand the role of convective motions in coronal _ heating _ and the physical mechanisms and conditions for a significant _ storage _ of magnetic energy and its _",
    "shearing or twisting the field lines might appear as the most straightforward way to make the system accumulate energy . to this end , in recent work @xcite we have implemented a 1d velocity forcing with a sinusoidal _ shear flow _ at the boundary , with @xmath14 , wavenumber @xmath15 , spanning the whole photospheric plane ( @xmath16 is the cross - section length ) . initially",
    "the magnetic field that develops in the coronal loop is a simple map of the photospheric velocity field , i.e. , @xmath17 , with its intensity growing linearly in time .",
    "a sheared magnetic field is known to be subject to tearing instability @xcite , in fact magnetic energy accumulates until a tearing instability sets in , magnetic energy is released and the system transitions to the nonlinear stage .    on the other hand",
    "continuing the simulation we found that , once the system has become fully nonlinear the dynamics are fundamentally different : _ the magnetic shear is not recreated_. once fluctuations are present , the orthogonal magnetic field ( @xmath18 and @xmath19 ) is organized in magnetic islands with @xmath20 and @xmath21 points , the nonlinear terms do not vanish any more and energy can be transported efficiently from large to small scales where it is dissipated .    in the nonlinear stage",
    "the dynamics are very similar whether the forcing velocity is a shear flow or made of disordered vortices , and magnetic energy is not stored efficiently , therefore larger releases of energy are not possible .",
    "a shear photospheric flow can give rise to a sheared coronal magnetic field only in the unlikely condition that no relevant perturbations are present in the corona , or for very strong shear flows with velocity higher than the typical photospheric velocity of @xmath22 , when the perturbations naturally present in the corona can be neglected .",
    "all photospheric forcings described so far fill the entire photospheric plane .",
    "spatially localized velocity fields , like a single vortex that does not fill the entire plane , might be able to induce a higher storage of magnetic energy in the corona .",
    "a vortex twists the magnetic field lines , and the resulting helical magnetic structure is kink unstable and widely used to model coronal loops @xcite . in these studies a twisted magnetic field lines structure",
    "is used as initial condition , but this is assumed to have been induced by photospheric motions shuffling their footpoints , while the field lines are actually line - tied to a _",
    "motionless photosphere_.    to understand the dynamics of this photospherically driven system we have performed numerical simulations applying localized vortices at the photospheric boundary .",
    "@xcite performed boundary forced simulations , but they stop just after kink instability sets in . in this paper",
    "we continue the simulations for longer times .",
    "this allows us to understand the dynamics of the system both when initially only an axial uniform magnetic field is present and a smooth ordered flux - tube with twisted field lines gets formed and kink instability sets in , and the later dynamics when the localized boundary vortex twists the footpoints of a disordered magnetic field where magnetic fluctuations and small scales are already present and field lines are no longer smooth .",
    "furthermore , highly twisted magnetic structures , such as _ flux ropes _ , are broadly used to model the initiation of coronal mass ejections ( cmes , e.g. , see @xcite , and references therein ) . to advance our understanding of eruption initiation",
    "it is therefore important to understand if and under which conditions photospheric motions can self - consistently generate flux ropes @xcite , or if these structures can only be advected into the corona from sub - photospheric regions via emerging flux .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in   [ sec : gebc ] we describe the basic governing equations and boundary conditions , as well as the numerical code used to integrate them . in   [ par3 ]",
    "we discuss the initial conditions for our simulations and briefly summarize the linear stage dynamics more extensively detailed in @xcite .",
    "the results of our numerical simulations are presented in   [ sec : ns ] , while the final section is devoted to our conclusions and discussion of the impact of this work on coronal physics .",
    "we model a coronal loop as an axially elongated cartesian box with an orthogonal cross section of size @xmath16 and an axial length @xmath23 embedded in an homogeneous and uniform axial magnetic field @xmath24 aligned along the @xmath25-direction .",
    "any curvature effect is neglected .",
    "the dynamics are integrated with the equations of rmhd @xcite , well suited for a plasma embedded in a strong axial magnetic field . in dimensionless form",
    "they are given by : @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the velocity and magnetic fields components orthogonal to the axial field and @xmath29 is the plasma pressure .",
    "the gradient operator has components only in the perpendicular @xmath30-@xmath31 planes @xmath32 while the linear term @xmath33 couples the planes along the axial direction through a wave - like propagation at the alfvn speed @xmath34 .",
    "incompressibility in rmhd equations follows from the large value of the axial magnetic fields @xcite and they remain valid also for low @xmath9 systems @xcite such as the corona . furthermore @xcite have recently performed fully compressible simulations of a similar cartesian coronal loop model , showing that the inclusion of thermal conductivity and radiative losses , that transport away the heat produced by the small scale energy dissipation , keep the dynamics in the rmhd regime .    to render the equations nondimensional ,",
    "we have first expressed the magnetic field as an alfvn velocity [ @xmath35 , where @xmath5 is the density supposed homogeneous and constant , and then all velocities have been normalized to the velocity @xmath36 , the order of magnitude of photospheric convective motions .",
    "lengths and times are expressed in units of the perpendicular length of the computational box @xmath37 and its related crossing time @xmath38 . as a result ,",

    "hyperdiffusion is used because the implemented boundary velocity forcings and the magnetic flux tubes induced initially are localized to a small area of the computational box , and the dynamics would be dramatically diffusive with standard diffusion at a reasonable resolution ( see next section   [ par3 ] for a more detailed discussion ) .",

    "of course at a given length ( beyond the critical length ) there is also a critical twist beyond which the configuration is unstable . in our simulations",
    "the system is continuously forced at the boundary , and in the linear stage the twist grows linearly in time ( from equation  ( [ eq : lin1 ] ) , as the twist is proportional to @xmath136 ) , thus such a critical twist is certainly attained .    in our case",

    "additionally @xcite found out that configurations with zero net current are unstable to the _ internal _ kink mode ( opposed to the global kink mode for configurations with a net current ) , for which magnetic perturbations and the radial displacement of the plasma column are confined within the original flux tube .",
    "this is found also in our simulation as shown in figure  [ fig : fig4 ] at the onset of the nonlinear stage at @xmath140 , when the plasma displaces inside the flux tube toward its edge where a strong current sheet forms .",

    ", the transition to and the first phase of the nonlinear regime , the analysis of @xcite is fully confirmed also for the photospherically driven case considered here : the system forced by a circular vortex is unstable to an _ internal kink mode _ , releases most of the stored magnetic energy and magnetic reconnection untwists the field lines .",
    "linear calculations @xcite show that similar dynamics are expected also for different configurations with different aspect ratios and magnetic guide field values , except for those that fall below the instability threshold .",
    "the phenomenology described so far is also in agreement with that of three - dimensional simulations with a realistic geometry @xcite .",
    "in particular strong nonlinearities persist right after the instability occurs ( @xmath148 and @xmath146 ) , when the system can not be described as a constant-@xmath149 force - free state .",
    "an inverse cascade of magnetic energy is observed , as the orthogonal magnetic field acquires longer scales and the overall volume occupied by twisted field lines increases , as shown in figure  [ fig : fig4 ] just before ( @xmath148 ) and after ( @xmath150 ) the instability . in @xcite",
    "this corresponds also to an inverse cascade of magnetic helicity , corresponding in the rmhd case to an inverse cascade of the square potential @xmath151 ( see the end of this section and our discussion in   5 for more about this quasi - invariant analogous to helicity in rmhd ) .    ) and kinetic ( @xmath104 ) time - averaged energy spectra as a function of the orthogonal wavenumber @xmath152 the inset shows the kinetic energy spectrum of the boundary velocity vortex [ equations  ( [ eq : f0])-([eq : f00 ] ) ] applied at the top plate @xmath119 . [",
    "fig : fig7 ] ]    on the other hand , at later times the dynamics are certainly surprising when , in the fully nonlinear stage , fluctuations created by the kink instability are present in the corona .",
    "for @xmath153 magnetic energy increases steadily , while kinetic energy remains small ( figure  [ fig : fig2 ] ) .",
    "this is in contrast to all our previous simulations with space - filling boundary motions , either distorted vortices @xcite or shear flows @xcite , when in the nonlinear regime a _ magnetically dominated statistically steady state _ was reached where integrated quantities would fluctuate around an average value ( with velocity fluctuations smaller than magnetic fluctuations ) .    in our case",
    "ohmic dissipation @xmath89 and the integrated poynting flux @xmath116 do reach a statistically steady state ( figure  [ fig : fig3 ] ) .",
    "the integrated pointing flux @xmath154 is the power entering the system at the boundaries as a result of the work done by photospheric motions on the footpoints of magnetic field lines ( @xmath75 is the photospheric forcing velocity ) .",
    "but in contrast to our previous results , here the power does not balance on the average the dissipation rate , its average is slightly higher resulting in the magnetic energy growth shown in figure  [ fig : fig2 ] .     fluctuate around a mean value , the first two modes increase steadily showing that an inverse cascade occurs . [ fig : fig8 ] ]    in physical space the dynamics are surprising in two ways . _ first _ , after the kink instability , even though we continue to stir the field lines footpoints with the same vortex , no further kink instability develops .",
    "analogously to the shear flow case @xcite , once the system transitions to the nonlinear stage the magnetic fluctuations generated during the instability do not have a vanishing lorentz force .",
    "in fact around @xmath155 , at the end of the big dissipative event , the topology of the orthogonal component of the magnetic field is characterized by circular , but _ distorted _ , field lines ( figure  [ fig : fig4 ] ) .",
    "naturally the lorentz force does not vanish now and the vorticity is not constant along the streamlines . _ nonlinear terms do not vanish _ as they do during the linear stage for @xmath156 . when they vanish magnetic energy can be stored , without getting dissipated , into an ordered flux - tube with helical field lines ( figure  [ fig : fig5 ] , @xmath157 ) , and matching perfectly round orthogonal magnetic field lines ( figure  [ fig : fig4 ] , @xmath158 ) .",
    "but now nonlinearity continuously _ transfers _ energy from large to small scales where it is dissipated . in physical space",
    "small scales are not uniformly distributed , but they are organized in field - aligned current sheets . these , once formed during the onset of the nonlinear stage , persist throughout the subsequent dynamics ( as shown in figures  [ fig : fig4 ] and [ fig : fig6 ] ) , with the energy cascade continuously feeding them .",
    "_ second _ , the photospherical vortical motions do not give rise to an orderly helical flux - tube as in the linear stage ( figure  [ fig : fig5 ] , @xmath129 ) .",
    "however , magnetic field lines get twisted , but in a disordered way ( figure  [ fig : fig5 ] and  [ fig : fig4 ] , @xmath159 ) .",
    "a new phenomenon occurs : on longer timescales the magnetic field acquires longer spatial scales ( figure  [ fig : fig4 ] ) , the volume where field lines are twisted increases ( figure  [ fig : fig5 ] ) , while the current exhibits always a small filling factor occupying a small fraction of the volume ( figure  [ fig : fig6 ] ) .",
    "to better understand these phenomena we need to investigate the energy dynamics in fourier space .",
    "we consider the spectra in the orthogonal @xmath30-@xmath31 plane integrated along the @xmath25 direction .",
    "as they are isotropic in the fourier @xmath160-@xmath161 plane we compute the integrated 1d spectra , so that for the total magnetic energy @xmath88 we obtain : latexmath:[\\[\\begin{aligned } e_m & = & \\frac{1}{2 } \\int\\limits_0^l\\ !",
    "\\mathrm{d}z\\ , \\iint\\limits_0^{\\quad \\",

    "erg , in the _ micro - flare _ range .",
    "[ fig : fig9 ] ]    the _ time averaged _ magnetic and kinetic energy spectra as a function of wavenumber are shown in figure  [ fig : fig7 ] , the inset shows the spectrum of the boundary vortex kinetic energy ( see equation  ( [ eq : f0 ] ) ) .",
    "photospheric motions therefore inject energy at wavenumbers between 2 and 7 ( see equation  ( [ eq : pflux ] ) ) , the system is magnetically dominated and the power - laws exhibited at higher wavenumbers , in the inertial range , are similar to those obtained with previous space - filling boundary forcings @xcite , with the spectrum of magnetic energy much steeper than that of kinetic energy .",
    "however the time - average of the low - wavenumber modes hides an interesting dynamics .",
    "figure  [ fig : fig8 ] shows the first five magnetic energy modes as a function of time . while modes with wavenumbers @xmath167 after the kink instability fluctuate around a mean value , the first two modes @xmath168 grow steadily with mode @xmath55 becoming prevalent .",
    "this shows that an _ inverse cascade _ takes place . while the _ direct cascade _ transfers energy from the injection scale toward small scales ( current sheets ) where energy is dissipated , analogously the inverse cascade transfers energy toward the large scales ( modes 1 and 2 ) where _ no dissipative process",
    "_ is at work and consequently _ energy accumulates_. in physical space this process gives rise to the large scales that the magnetic field acquires in the orthogonal direction , shown in figures  [ fig : fig4 ] and [ fig : fig5 ] , discussed previously . in the rmhd system with boundary conditions as we apply here there is no strict invariant known to follow an inverse cascade , such as magnetic helicity in 3d mhd or the square of the vector potential in 2d mhd @xcite .",
    "rmhd resembles the 2d mhd case in the sense that though the square of the vector potential is not conserved , the terms violating conservation arise only from the boundaries in the axial direction .",
    "a dynamical magnetic inverse cascade mechanism is therefore still active , impeded only by the inputs coming from photospheric motions at the boundary , and this explains the accumulation of magnetic energy at the largest transverse scales .",
    "the simulation described in the previous section ( run  a ) has a duration of @xmath169 , but this time span leaves undetermined the behavior of the low wavenumber modes over longer time scales .",
    "indeed these modes keep growing , as shown in figure  [ fig : fig8 ] , resulting in a _ steady growth _ of total magnetic energy , shown in figure  [ fig : fig2 ] . to understand the long - time dynamics of the system , we have performed another simulation , run  b , with the same physical parameters of run  a , but half the orthogonal resolution ( table  [ tbl ] ) , extending the duration up to @xmath170 .",
    "]    figure  [ fig : fig9 ] shows that over longer times the energy of the system is prevalently in mode  1 , i.e. , the largest possible scale .",
    "but this mode does not grow indefinitely and over these much longer time - scales it reaches a statistically steady state , fluctuating around its mean value . the largest energy fluctuations shown in figure  [ fig : fig9 ] result in energy drops of @xmath171 , that in dimensional units correspond to a micro - flare with @xmath172 , releasing about twice the amount of energy released by the kink instability around @xmath173 in run  a ( compare with figure  [ fig : fig2 ] ) .",
    "notice that the kink instability does not appear in figure  [ fig : fig9 ] because the sampling time interval for the modes is too long in run  b , but it is clearly shown in the r.m.s .  of the energies ( not shown ) and in the dissipation rate ( see inset in figure  [ fig : fig10 ] )",
    ".    comparing figure  [ fig : fig9 ] with figure  [ fig : fig10 ] , where the ohmic dissipation rate @xmath89 is shown as a function of time , displays another interesting result .",
    "the large and sharp energy drops shown in figure  [ fig : fig9 ] correspond to large dissipative peaks in figure  [ fig : fig10 ] , e.g. , at times @xmath174 and @xmath175 , but it is also possible to have equally large but more gradual energy drops , e.g. , between times @xmath176 and @xmath177 , without a corresponding single large dissipative peak but rather a cluster of smaller peaks .",
    "in physical space we have already seen in run  a that initially the inverse cascade corresponds to a perturbed magnetic field that occupies an increasingly larger volume ( figure  [ fig : fig4 ] ) until all the field lines in the box get twisted ( figure  [ fig : fig5 ] ) . in run",
    "b we observe that successively , once the computational box has been filled with perpendicular magnetic field , the rising amplitude of modes  1 corresponds to an increase of the magnetic field intensity , while the fluctuations in the energy mode are due to magnetic reconnection events .",
    "in fact due to the periodic boundary conditions in @xmath30 and @xmath31 the same system repeats indefinitely along these directions . when the orthogonal magnetic field reaches the boundary it starts to interact with the neighboring structures ( i.e. with itself coming from the other side ) .",
    "the magnetic energy drops in mode  1 correspond to magnetic reconnection events that make the system oscillate between the different possible configurations with energy contained at the ( large ) scales of mode  1 shown in figure  [ fig : fig11 ] ( there is no preferred orthogonal direction for the system at this scale ) .",
    "while the periodic boundary conditions limit the interactions of large - scale twisted magnetic structures it is clearly shown that interaction with such other magnetic copies of itself is one of the ways in which the accumulated energy can be released .",
    "further possibilities and the dynamics of these interactions will be the subject of future works .",
    "in this paper we have investigated the dynamics of a closed coronal region driven at its boundary by a localized photospheric vortex .",
    "such small vortical motions with scales typical of photospheric convection ( @xmath178  km ) have been recently observed in the photosphere @xcite , and can induce relevant dynamics in the solar corona @xcite .",
    "a `` straightened out '' closed region of the solar corona is modeled as an elongated cartesian box where the top and bottom plates mimic the photosphere , and the dynamics are integrated with the reduced mhd equations @xcite , well suited for a plasma threaded by a strong axial magnetic field .",
    "the initial condition consists simply of a uniform axial magnetic field .",
    "its field lines are originally straight and its footpoints are line - tied at both ends in the top and bottom photospheric plates .",
    "the photospheric vortex drags the field lines footpoints twisting the magnetic field lines ( figure  [ fig : fig5 ] , @xmath157 ) . even though the vortex that we employ is not perfectly circular ( figure  [ fig : fig1 ] , equations  ( [ eq : f0])-([eq : f00 ] ) ) in the linear stage the field lines tension straightens out in a round shape the orthogonal magnetic field lines ( figure  [ fig : fig4 ] , @xmath179 and @xmath158 ) , in this way the lorentz force vanishes in the planes and the system is able to accumulate energy .",
    "the small departure from a round shape ( at its edge ) of the boundary vortex introduces a small perturbation in the coronal field .",
    "the system is then unstable to the internal kink mode ( figure  [ fig : fig4 ] , @xmath158 ) , and releases about @xmath180 of the accumulated energy in a dissipative event ( figures  [ fig : fig2 ] and [ fig : fig3 ] ) .",
    "the energy released in this event is of the order of a _ micro - flare _ with @xmath181  erg .",
    "these results are in agreement with those of @xcite , that consider similar initial conditions , performs a refined linear analysis , but does not employ a boundary forcing , i.e. , the field lines are line - tied to a motionless photosphere . therefore the initial _ linear stage _ and the development of the kink instability are in agreement with previous works that have always employed large - scale smooth fields with no broad - band fluctuations as initial conditions , both in the case of field lines line - tied to a motionless photosphere @xcite and with a boundary driver @xcite .",
    "on the other hand in the solar corona perturbations are continuously injected from the lower atmospheric layers .",
    "numerical simulations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) confirm that especially in closed regions , where waves can not escape toward the interplanetary medium , broad - band magnetic fluctuations of the order of a few percent of the strong axial magnetic field ( not infinitesimal perturbations as classically used in instabilities studies ) are naturally present .    therefore in order to gain a first insight of the coronal dynamics when the magnetic field is already structured , i.e. , there are finite magnetic fluctuations ( small but not infinitesimal ) with small scales and current sheets , we continue the simulation after kink instability develops .",
    "in fact right after kink instability the magnetic energy is small ( figure  [ fig : fig2 ] ) , with @xmath182 , but it is already structured with current sheets ( figure  [ fig : fig4 ] , @xmath183 ) and a broad band spectrum ( figure  [ fig : fig7 ] ) .",
    "the boundary vortex continues to twist the magnetic field lines , but in a disordered way ( figure  [ fig : fig5 ] , @xmath184 ",
    "@xmath185 ) .",
    "the presence of an already structured magnetic field allows nonlinear dynamics to develop : once current sheets and small scales are present , an energy cascade continues to feed them , as shown by the energy spectra in figure  [ fig : fig7 ] .",
    "therefore current sheets do not disappear , and the continuous transfer of energy from the large to the small scales prevents the field lines to increase their twist beyond @xmath147 .",
    "the twist remains approximately constant in the nonlinear stage as shown in figure  [ fig : fig5 ] ( @xmath184  @xmath185 ) .",
    "furthermore because the current is now concentrated in thin current sheets ( figures  [ fig : fig4 ] and [ fig : fig6 ] ) kink instabilities do not develop .",
    "we had already observed a similar behavior in our previous simulations that employed space - filling boundary drivers . in particular when the field lines were _ sheared _ by a 1d boundary forcing @xcite the coronal field was sheared only in the linear stage , but after that a multiple tearing instability developed and in the coronal field magnetic fluctuations and current sheets were formed , the continuous shearing motions at the boundary were not able to recreate a sheared coronal field and further instabilities were not observed .",
    "but in the simulations presented in this paper a new phenomenon occurs .",
    "although the field lines twist is approximately constant in the nonlinear stage , the volume where field lines are twisted increases , and the magnetic field acquires larger scales ( figures  [ fig : fig4 ] and [ fig : fig5 ] ) . besides a _",
    "direct _ cascade that transfers energy from the large to the small scales where it is dissipated in current sheets , an _ inverse _ cascade takes place , transferring energy from the injection scale toward larger scales , where no dissipation takes place and energy can accumulate .",
    "the analysis of the magnetic energy modes ( figures  [ fig : fig8 ] and [ fig : fig9 ] ) shows indeed that on long time - scales most of the energy is stored at the largest possible scale ( mode  1 ) .",
    "the inverse cascade is able to store a significant amount of magnetic energy .",
    "although magnetic helicity is not defined in rmhd , the integral of the magnetic square potential @xmath151 is approximately conserved ( see discussion in last paragraph of  [ sec : runa ] ) .",
    "the inverse cascade of magnetic energy corresponds also to an inverse cascade of the square potential , as clearly shown in figure  [ fig : fig4 ] where the field lines are the contour of @xmath151 ( and @xmath186 ) . in future compressible simulations we expect to observe for magnetic helicity ( well defined in 3d mhd ) dynamics similar to those shown here for magnetic energy , i.e. , an increase of magnetic helicity ( injected from the boundary ) and its inverse cascade , in analogy to the the inverse helicity cascade observed by @xcite .    because of the periodic boundary conditions along @xmath30 and @xmath31 the system is virtually repeated along these directions .",
    "when the field lines get twisted in the entire computational box , this twisted structure interacts with these neighboring twisted structures .",
    "this interaction is the only condition that limits the growth of magnetic energy , giving rise to impulsive magnetic reconnection events , that now is not inhibited by the circular topology of the orthogonal magnetic field lines of a single structure .",
    "these events make the system oscillate between the many possible configurations with energy in mode  1 ( two of these are shown in figure  [ fig : fig11 ] ) .",
    "the associated energy drops shown in figure  [ fig : fig9 ] are also in the _ micro - flare _ range with @xmath187  erg , twice the value of the energy released initially by the kink instability .",
    "although in the presented simulations the generated magnetic structures interact only with similar structures repeated by the periodic boundary conditions along @xmath30 and @xmath31 , we can infer that the interaction of a single twisted magnetic structure with other magnetic structures can give rise to similar release of energy .",
    "a more general investigations of the interaction between twisted magnetic structures is under way to understand under which conditions the interaction leads to energy storage and/or release , and to determine quantitatively these properties .",
    "previous simulations that employed a space - filling photospheric forcing @xcite were not able to accumulate a significant amount of energy to be successively released in micro or larger flares .",
    "those photospheric motions , that mimic a uniform and homogeneous convection , give instead rise to a basal background coronal heating rate in the lower range of the observational constraint ( @xmath188  erg@xmath189s@xmath190 ) and a million degree corona @xcite . in the case of a space - filling boundary driver",
    "we had also observed that the inverse cascade is inhibited ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) for typically strong dc magnetic fields .",
    "an inverse cascade is possible only for weak guide fields ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , a condition applicable only to limited regions of the corona .",
    "we conclude that in presence of line - tying and a strong guide field , inverse cascade can be a good mechanism to store energy , but only if the boundary motion is localized in space as the vortex used here , and not space - filling .",
    "subsequently the interaction of this magnetic structures with others can release the accumulated energy .    in general photospheric motions will be a superposition of approximately homogenous space - filling convective motions and localized vortical and also shearing motions ( e.g. , see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a localized shear case ) . while the space - filling motions give rise to a basal background coronal heating ( e.g. , * ? ?",
    "* ) , localized motions can give rise to higher impulsive releases of energy in the micro - flare range and above , contributing to coronal heating while increasing the temporal intermittency of the energy deposition and of its associated radiative emissions .",
    "in future works we will consider cases with localized motions superimposed to a homogenous space - filling convection - mimicking velocity field to determine , among other things , how stronger the localized velocity has to be respect to the background motions in order to develop dynamics similar to those presented in this paper .    as mentioned in the introduction , highly ( and orderly ) twisted magnetic structures , such as _ flux ropes _ , are used to initiate solar eruptions ( e.g. , see @xcite for a recent application , and the reviews by @xcite for further examples of this model ) .",
    "kink - like instabilities developing in these flux - ropes give rise to an explosive dynamics leading to the formation of a cme .",
    "we have shown that kink - unstable flux ropes are not formed in the corona by boundary vortical motions , unless a very strong vortex is applied and the coronal magnetic fluctuations can then be neglected . therefore , although flux ropes can be formed in the complex dynamics in and around a prominence region @xcite , given the ubiquitous presence of magnetic fluctuations in the solar corona , the development of kink - like instabilities may be strongly limited . while the dynamics of the induced cme can be a good approximation , we conclude that such models offer a poor model of the initiation process for which more realistic models are called for @xcite",
    ".    generally speaking , in a realistic 3d geometry one might expect that the growth of energy in the transverse field leads to an inflation and rise of a magnetic loop due to the curvature , which we have neglected here .",
    "this effect was included by @xcite , who showed that twisting the footpoints of a curved flux rope leads to its gradual expansion and the system rises to larger solar radii . in our simulations",
    "the twist does not increase ( the overall field lines twist is limited to @xmath191 ) , remaining roughly constant in the nonlinear stage .",
    "it is left to future work to understand under which conditions such a system , including curvature , has dynamics similar to those of @xcite , or whether different dynamics are possible ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and how the dynamics develop in a 3d geometry considering small or large - scales photospheric vortices .    this work was carried out in part at the jet propulsion laboratory under a contract with nasa .",
    "this research supported in part by the nasa heliophysics theory program nnx11aj44 g , and by the nsf solar terrestrial and shine programs ( ags-1063439 & ags-1156094 ) , by the nasa mms and solar probe plus projects .",

    "<S> we have neglected fluctuations and the fields are laminar until the instability sets in . but previous investigations indicate that fluctuations , excited by photospheric motions and coronal dynamics , are naturally present at all scales in the coronal fields . </S>",
    "<S> thus , in order to understand the effect of a photospheric vortex on a more realistic corona , we continue the simulations after kink instability sets in , when turbulent fluctuations have already developed in the corona . in the nonlinear stage </S>",
    "<S> the system never returns to the simple initial state with ordered twisted field lines , and kink instability does not occur again </S>",
    "<S> . nevertheless field lines get twisted , but in a disordered way , and energy accumulates at large scales through an inverse cascade . </S>",
    "<S> this energy can subsequently be released in micro - flares or larger flares , when interaction with neighboring structures occurs or via other mechanisms . the impact on coronal dynamics and cmes initiation </S>",
    "<S> is discussed . </S>"
