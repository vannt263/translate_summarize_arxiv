    "transport properties of nanosystems are very different from those of macroscopic conductors .",

    "it has been shown that the transport properties are controlled predominantly by the leads.@xcite it has also been shown that the conductance of a commensurate cdw system is very different from that of an incommensurate one . the theoretical description of incommensurate cdw is similar to a theory of the luttinger liquid .",
    "the resulting temperature dependence of the conductance is much simpler than that of commensurate cdw.@xcite these results lead straightforwardly to a question abouth the mechanisms that determine the commensurability of cdw in meso- and nanoscales , e.g , whether commensurability of the charge distribution depends on the bias voltage and the geometry of the nanosystem .",
    "recent self  consistent investigations of the molecular chain show that charge distribution strongly depends on the applied voltage.@xcite this effect has already been observed in molecular devices.@xcite in analogy to this result , one may expect that the applied voltage changes also the charge distribution in the cdw system , what affects the current  voltage characteristic .",
    "the current itself can modify the charge distribution as well . as a result",
    ", we may obtain a system , where small changes of the applied voltage can , through the modification of the charge distribution , drive the system between insulating and metallic states .",

    "it is generally believed that the mean field approximation is inappropriate for low dimensional systems .",
    "however , it has been argued that this approximation may be applicable at low temperatures for weak interaction and strong coupling between nanosystem and electrodes ( see ref . and the discussion therein ) .",

    "additionally , the recent investigations of nanorings with cdw correlations have shown that the mean field results qualitatively agree with the exact ones@xcite ( although the quantitative differences remain significant ) .",
    "these results concern the properties of persistent currents in a system , where cdw is pinned by impurities . in the present case",
