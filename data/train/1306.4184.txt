    "<S> @xcite for the strong - coupling approach is the fact that both the alkaline iron selenides @xmath5fe@xmath6se@xmath7  @xcite and the single - layer fese  @xcite lack the fermi surface nesting ( in the absence of hole fermi pockets ) and yet still display high-@xmath8 superconductivity .    </S>",
    "<S> a recent development in the strong - coupling approach to the iron - based superconductors is the proposal that the proximity to the mott transition is orbital - dependent  @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> [ fig:2](c ) ] . </S>",
    "<S> this is because the electron pocket has a hybridized @xmath12 and @xmath11 orbital character , and the size of the gap at a particular wavevector depends on the dominant orbital character at that point . </S>",
    "<S> the gap anisotropy reflects these two characteristic superconducting gaps @xmath59 : as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:2](c ) , the gap can not be fitted by a single gap function @xmath60 though the dominant pairing channel is @xmath52 @xmath3 . </S>",

    "<S> the different orbital characters of the quasiparticle dispersion put a strong constraint to the scattering processes such that the spin response is enhanced only in certain regimes of the bz , where the orbital characters of the associated hole and electron bands are compatible . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the dominant contribution to the lower frequency resonance peak at @xmath64 ( see fig .  [ fig:3](c ) ) is from a scattering between the @xmath23 orbital in regime a and the @xmath12 orbital in regime a@xmath65 , as indicated by the dashed arrow in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:1](a ) . </S>",
    "<S> the higher frequency resonance peak at @xmath66 , on the other hand , is mainly associated with a scattering within the @xmath12 orbital between regimes b and b@xmath65 ( see fig .  [ fig:3](c ) and fig .  [ </S>",

    "<S> ( note that as a combined effect of the momentum dependence of the gap function and the multiorbital nature , @xmath74 is smaller than the gap along the nearby hole fermi pocket  @xcite . ) therefore , @xmath75 ; when this difference is sufficiently large , two resonances appear in the frequency - dependent spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> as @xmath54 increases , both @xmath76 and @xmath74 increase . </S>",
    "<S> but due to the subdominant @xmath53 channel in the @xmath11 orbital , @xmath76 increases faster , and @xmath77 for @xmath58 . </S>",
    "<S> we thus obtain a single resonance peak at @xmath78 , as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:3](b ) and ( d ) ) ; the multi - orbital effect is then reflected in the broadening of the peak .    </S>",
    "<S> _ discussions .  </S>",
    "<S> _ our results elucidate how the orbital selectivity of electron correlations influences the superconductivity . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the orbital - selective pairing gives rise to gap anisotropy along a fermi surface with hybridized orbital characters . by promoting the subdominant @xmath53 @xmath3 pairing channel , </S>",
    "<S> the magnetic frustration may compete with the orbital selectivity , and tune the gap anisotropy . </S>",
    "<S> our results are particularly pertinent to the anisotropic superconducting gap along the electron pockets in the underdoped na(fe@xmath9,co@xmath10)as observed in recent arpes measurements  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we are also able to understand the evolution from the anisotropic to isotropic gap with increasing electron doping . for illustrating purposes , in the model calculation of this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we fix the electron doping and show the evolution of gap anisotropy by tuning @xmath54 . </S>",
    "<S> but the gap anisotropy as a consequence of the orbital selectivity is a general result . in a more realistic model </S>",
    "<S> , the exchange couplings would be orbital dependent . whether an anisotropic gap shows up depends on how different the ratio of exchange coupling to the renormalized electronic - bandwidth , @xmath79 , is among the different orbitals , and </S>",
    "<S> this ratio will be tuned by the strength of electron correlations .    </S>",
    "<S> theoretically , the coexistence of antiferromagnetic order and superconductivity in the underdoped regime may also lead to an anisotropic superconducting gap along the reconstructed fermi surface  @xcite . in this scenario , </S>",
    "<S> the fermi surface is reconstructed for both the electron and hole pockets . </S>",
    "<S> but experimentally , the gap anisotropy was only observed along electron pockets . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the fermi surface reconstruction for the gap anisotropy was not observed in arpes  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it therefore is unlikely that the observed anisotropic gap is primarily driven by the coexistence of superconductivity with antiferromagnetic order .    </S>",
    "<S> raman scattering has also implicated an anisotropic gap along the electron pocket in the nearly optimally hole - doped bafe@xmath7as@xmath7 .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite because hole doping tends to increase the orbital selectivity of electron correlations  @xcite , it is natural to propose that the mechanism advanced here underlies this experimental observation as well .    </S>",
    "<S> we have also shown that the frequency dependence of the dynamical spin susceptibility at @xmath4 displays a resonance , whose width is enhanced by the orbital - dependence of the superconducting gap . </S>",
    "<S> when the latter is sufficiently strong , the resonance peak may be split into two . </S>",
    "<S> we propose that this mechanism underlies the recent neutron - scattering observation of double spin resonances in the electron underdoped nafeas system  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the double - resonance feature we have discussed is very different from the one reported in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . in that case , the wavevectors where the resonances take place are sensitive to the fermi surface geometry , and are necessarily different for the two resonances ; one is at @xmath63 , while the other is at an incommensurate @xmath36 . in our case , both resonances take place at the same wavevector @xmath63 ; this wavevector is determined by the @xmath36-dependence of @xmath80 .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , the degree of electron correlations remains a central issue in the iron - based superconductors . </S>",
    "<S> this issue is typically probed in the normal state , through the bad - metal phenomenology in the optical spectrum @xcite or the orbital selectivity in the arpes spectrum @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our theoretical results here suggest that this issue can also be fairly directly probed through the orbital selectivity of the gap function in the superconducting state . </S>",
    "<S> arpes studies along this direction are already quite realistic  @xcite , and we anticipate that considerable new insights will be derived through further studies along this direction .    _ conclusions .  </S>",
    "<S> _ our calculation on the superconducting pairing in a five - orbital @xmath0-@xmath1-j@xmath7 model for iron pnictides reveals an orbital - selective gap structure due to the strong electron correlation effects . </S>",
    "<S> while both gaps have the @xmath52 @xmath3 symmetry , the different orbital character gives rise to gap anisotropy along the electron pockets . </S>",
    "<S> the orbital selective pairing leads to a broadened neutron resonance at the antiferromagnetic ordering wavevector @xmath63 in the superconducting state . </S>",
    "<S> this resonance may even be split into two peaks . </S>",
