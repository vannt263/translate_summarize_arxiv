    "the surface brightness ( sb ) and the projected density profiles of the vast majority of globular clusters ( gcs ) are well reproduced by a family of simple models characterized by an extended isothermal core and a tidally trucated envelope ",
    "the so - called king models ( king 1966 ) .",
    "however a fraction ( @xmath520% , see @xcite ) of galactic gcs deviate significantly from this behavior .",
    "the projected density profiles of these clusters do not exhibit an extended core , showing instead a power law behavior @xmath6 with @xmath7 ranging from @xmath8 to @xmath9 .",
    "this feature has been thought to arise from the dynamical evolution of stellar systems that have experienced the collapse of the core .",
    "these are called post - core collapse clusters , hereafter pcc )",
    ".    however , other processes can affect the shape of a star cluster density profile ; among these the existence of an intermediate mass black hole ( imbh ) in the central region has recently received attention .",
    "interestingly enough , detailed collisional @xmath10-body simulations ( baumgardt et al .",
    ", 2005 , hereafter bmh05 ; trenti et al . 2007 ) and theoretical arguments @xcite have shown that the presence of a imbh yields quite a different sb profile than core collapse does .",
    "these studies indicate that in an initially dense cluster a imbh gives rise to a strong expansion of the central region that , in turn , leads to a quasi - steady configuration resembling that of a medium concentration cluster with a core - like profile .",
    "thus , the clusters most likely to harbor imbhs are those having the appearance of normal king model clusters except in the very central regions where a power law deviation from a flat behavior is expected .",
    "the exponent of this power law is predicted to be significantly lower ( @xmath11 ) than in the pcc case ( bmh05 , miocchi 2007 ) .",
    "small departures from a king model have been observed in the projected density profile of a few gcs ( included ngc6388 ) by noyola & gebhardt ( 2006 , hereafter ng06 ) .",
    "the confirmation of the existence of imbhs and an estimate of their frequency would be important for a number of astrophysical problems like the formation processes of super massive bh in galaxies , super - eddington x - ray sources in extragalactic globular clusters @xcite , the origin of ultraluminous x - ray sources @xcite . despite of their potential importance , the existence of imbh in gcs is still an open question .",
    "for instance , the evidence for an imbh in m15 reported by @xcite and @xcite has been questioned by @xcite .",
    "@xcite also question evidence for an imbh in g1 in m31 @xcite ( but see @xcite and the recent findings by ulvestad et al ( 2007 ) and green & ho , 2007 ) .    here",
    "we present accurate surface density and sb profiles obtained with a combination of high - resolution and wide - field observations of the galactic globular cluster ngc  6388 , which a number of authors ( bmh05 ; ng06 ; drukier & bailyn 2003 , hereafter db03 ; miocchi 2007 ) have indicated as a prime candidate to harbor an imbh .",
    "these profiles nicely match the theoretical models of a cluster with a @xmath12 bh : having an extended core , intermediate concentration , but also significant deviations from a flat core distribution in the innermost cluster regions ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "in this paper we make use of a combination of high - resolution and wide - field photometric data sets , obtained with wfpc2 and acs on board _ hst _ , and with wfi at eso-2.2 m , respectively . a detailed description of the observations , photometric reduction and astrometry procedures of the data obtained with wfpc2 , acs - wfc , and wfi is given in a companion paper discussing the blue straggler star and horizontal branch populations @xcite . here",
    "we use only the optical ( @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 ) samples from the entire multi - wavelength data set .",
    "these have been all homogenized and transformed to the johnson magnitude system .",
    "all the star positions have been placed on the absolute astrometric system using several hundred astrometric reference stars from the new astrometric 2-mass catalogue , following the procedure described , e.g. , in @xcite , with a final astrometric accuracy of the order of @xmath17 both in ra and dec .",
    "additional images obtained with the acs - hrc have been retrieved from the eso / st - ecf science archive .",
    "these data sample the cluster central region with a field of view ( fov ) of @xmath18 and a spatial resolution of @xmath19 .",
    "the hrc data were obtained through filters @xmath20 ( @xmath15 ) and @xmath21 ( @xmath16 ) , with total exposure times of 620 and 3070s , respectively .",
    "after corrections for geometric distortions and effective flux @xcite , the photometric analysis was performed by using sextractor @xcite , adopting a fixed aperture radius of 4 pixels ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "the sample has then been astrometrized and photometrically calibrated by using the stars in common with the acs - wfc catalog .",
    "the color - magnitude diagrams based on the data from all four data sets are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cmd ] .",
    "given the absolute positions of individual stars in each catalog , the center of gravity , @xmath23 , of ngc  6388 has been determined by averaging the coordinates @xmath7 and @xmath24 of all stars detected in the highest resolution data set ( the hrc sample ) . in order to correct for spurious effects due to incompleteness in the very inner regions of the cluster , we considered only stars brighter than @xmath25 ( roughly corresponding to the sub - giant branch of the cluster ) . by following the iterative procedure described in (",
    "* see also ferraro et al .",
    "2004 ) , the center of gravity is located at @xmath26 , @xmath27 , with an uncertainty of @xmath28 in both @xmath7 and @xmath24 .",
    "a careful examination of field inside the core radius shows that our determination of the center is biased neither by the presence of very bright stars , nor of a star clump .",
    "the derived @xmath23 is located @xmath29 southeast ( @xmath30 , @xmath31 ) of that derived by @xcite using the surface brightness distribution .",
    "an accurate comparison with the center adopted by ng06 is not possible since the value listed in their table 1 is just referred to the world coordinate system of a specific wfpc2 image , however a visual inspection suggests that their center is located @xmath32 se of ours .",
    "we have determined the projected density profile of ngc  6388 using direct star counts over the entire cluster radial extent , from @xmath33 out to @xmath34 .",
    "this distance is significantly larger than the expected cluster extension ( @xmath35 , harris 1996 ) . in order to avoid spurious effects due to possible incompleteness ,",
    "only stars brighter than @xmath25 have been considered ( see dalessandro et al 2007 ) .",
    "there are more than 58,000 stars in the entire ( i.e. , the combination of acs , wfpc2 and wfi ) photometric data set .",
    "following the procedure described in @xcite , we have divided the sample in 40 concentric annuli , each centered on @xmath33 .",
    "each annulus has been split into an adequate number of sub - sectors .",
    "the number of stars lying within each sub - sector was counted , and the star density was obtained by dividing these values by the corresponding sub - sector areas . the stellar density in each annulus was then obtained as the average of the sub - sector densities , and the uncertainty in the average values for each annulus was estimated from the variance among the sub - sectors .",
    "the radius associated with each annulus is the mid - point of the radial bin .",
    "the outermost ( @xmath36 ) measures have an almost constant value and their average has been used to estimate the galaxy contamination to be @xmath37 stars arcmin@xmath38 . subtracting this background yields the the profiles shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : nbcounts ] .",
    "if the innermost ( @xmath39 ) points are excluded , the density profile is well fit all over the entire extension by an isotropic , single - mass king model with a core of @xmath1 and an intermediate concentration ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "these values are similar to those quoted by trager et al .",
    "( 1995 ; @xmath40 and @xmath41 ) , harris ( 1996 ; @xmath1 and @xmath41 ) , and mclaughling & van der marel ( 2005 ; @xmath42 and @xmath43 ) . ) larger tidal radius ( @xmath44 ) than previously determined . ] in the inner @xmath45 the observed profile shows an indication of a deviation from a flat core behavior . with only 7 stars in the innermost bin ,",
    "the statistical error of the inner bin ( @xmath46 ) is relatively large . with star counts alone the exact amount of the deviation from the flat core",
    "can not be reliably estimated .    exploiting the exceptional high resolution of acs - hrc images",
    "we have computed the sb profile by direct aperture photometry to more accurately determine the inner shape of the cluster profile . in the innermost region ( @xmath39 )",
    "we have used two sets of annuli stepped by @xmath28 and @xmath47 , respectively .",
    "the sb values have been computed as the sum of the counts in each pixel , divided by the number of pixels in any given annulus .",
    "the counts have then been converted to a magnitude scale and calibrated by using a relation that links the `` instrumental '' magnitude to the calibrated one ( obtained by performing aperture photometry for a number of high s / n isolated stars ) .",
    "the resulting sb profile for the innermost @xmath48 from the center is shown in figure [ fig : mu ] .",
    "a steepening of the profile at @xmath49 is clearly apparent , in agreement with what we found above for the surface density distribution .",
    "a linear fit to the inner points suggest that the slope of the profile is @xmath50 in the @xmath51 plane . in terms of the surface luminosity density @xmath52 , if @xmath53 we find @xmath54 .",
    "this is steeper ( but still marginally consistent within the errors ) than the slope @xmath55 derived from the analysis of wfpc2 images by ng06 .",
    "the n06 profile is shown for comparison in figure 3 , as can be seen their profile is fully compatible with our data in the common region .",
    "the use of high resolution images allow us to probe the innermost region of the cluster where most of the deviation from a flat behavior occurs is sufficient to flatten the profile .",
    "an additional difference in the slope determination might arise from the different approach used by ng06 , who removed the bright stars and did not fit a power law to the data but instead calculated the derivative of the smooth central profile . ] .",
    "the properties of the projected density and sb profiles derived in the previous section for ngc  6388 are not those of a cluster which has experienced the core collapse .",
    "instead they are just what bmh05 suggest as the signatures of a cluster harboring an imbh in its center : _",
    "( i ) _ a typical king profile with intermediate concentration ( @xmath0 ) in the external regions , _ ( ii ) _ a sizable core , and _ ( iii ) _ a inner logarithmic slope @xmath11 .",
    "these features have been recently confirmed by the predictions of a self - consistent parametric model that includes the presence of a central imbh @xcite .",
    "this model consists of a multi - mass isotropic , spherical king model , which has been extended inside the region of gravitational influence of the bh via the inclusion of the @xcite phase - space distribution function .    in order to further support the case for an imbh in the center of ngc  6388",
    ", we have used this model to reproduce the observed density and sb profiles . a salpeter mass function ( @xmath56 )",
    "is assumed in the model and seven discrete mass bins are used to approximate the continuum mass spectrum of the real cluster . the stellar mass range in the interval from 0.3 to 0.9@xmath57 ( here and thereafter , where not specified , masses are measured in @xmath57 ) equally subdivided in 6 bins @xmath58 wide .",
    "these were populated with main sequence stars .",
    "in addition the bins @xmath59 $ ] and @xmath60 $ ] include wd populations with mass @xmath61 and @xmath62 , coming from progenitors with mass , respectively , in @xmath63 $ ] and @xmath64 $ ] ranges .",
    "the seventh mass bin contains a massive wd population with @xmath65 , hypothosized as remnants of stars with mass 48 .",
    "the @xmath66 $ ] bin has @xmath67 and contains the to stars , plus giants and hb stars .",
    "the light - to - mass ratios were taken to be @xmath68 corresponding to the bins ordered in increasing average mass .",
    "the velocity dispersion of the seven components is constrained by the requirement of complete energy equipartition at the border of the bh influence region ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "*  for details ) , where the adimensionalised potential @xmath69 , along with the the ratio between the bh mass ( @xmath70 ) and the cluster mass ( @xmath71 ) , determine the form of the generated profiles .",
    "besides of the various scale parameters , @xmath69 and @xmath70 are adjusted to obtain the best fit to the observed profiles . to do this",
    ", we conservatively include only data from the central @xmath72 in order to avoid possible spurious effects which might affect the most external points of the sb profiles because of the field contamination subtraction .",
    "the best fit to the observed sb profile is then found for @xmath1 , @xmath0 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 ( yielding @xmath75% ) .",
    "the level of confidence remains above 97% for an imbh mass in the range @xmath76@xmath77 .",
    "the @xmath78 and @xmath79 values are consistent with the value deduced by the parametric fit of the single - mass king model mentioned above .",
    "the results of this parametric fit to the projected density and the sb profiles are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : nbcounts ] and [ fig : mu ] respectively .    by assuming the total cluster luminosity @xmath80 @xcite , and the distance modulus @xmath81 @xcite , we estimate a total mass of @xmath82 for ngc  6388 , yielding @xmath83 . ) derived from the @xmath84 relation ( ferrarese & merritt 2000 ; gebhardt et al .",
    "2000 ; see for example equation ( 10 ) of db03 ) , by assuming the low ( @xmath85 ) and the high ( @xmath86 ) exponents , respectively . ]",
    "while the central imbh is a possible explanation of the shape of the observed profiles , one might question whether this result is unique .",
    "in fact , a central concentration of massive remnants ( like white dwarfs and neutron stars ) has been proposed as an alternative explanation in the case of m15 @xcite .",
    "however , we have found that a multi - mass king model including a population of such remnants but without central bh is unable to reproduce the observed slope of the profiles in the core region . since our evidence is based exclusively from the shape of the density profile ,",
    "the presence of a imbh at the center of ngc  6388 is still debatable .",
    "accurate kinematical studies of the motion of stars in the central region of the cluster are needed to solidify the case .",
    "the region in which to seek for the possible kinematical signatures of a bh is very small .",
    "the self - consistent model here employed generates a projected velocity dispersion profile that shows a sharp rise from the `` isothermal plateau '' to a purely keplerian behavior at @xmath87 ( i.e. , @xmath88 ) .",
    "a more promising path to detect the kinematic signature of a bh is by proper motion measurements ( db03 ) .",
    "some stars should move with anomalously high velocities under the influence of the bh . in order to estimate the number of these stars ,",
    "we first need to evaluate the bh radius of influence @xmath89 . a crude estimate of @xmath89 is given by : @xmath90 , where @xmath91 is the velocity dispersion outside @xmath89 . by assuming @xmath92 @xcite",
    ", we find @xmath93pc , corresponding to @xmath94 with the cluster distance ( @xmath95kpc ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . by using equation ( 7 ) of db03",
    ", it is possible to estimate the number of stars ( @xmath10 ) , measurable through proper motions studies , having velocities 3 times the cluster velocity dispersion outside @xmath89 : @xmath96 , where @xmath97 is the number of stars within @xmath89 .",
    "this relation suggests that @xmath98 of stars within @xmath89 are expected to show anomalously high velocity .",
    "we can directly derive this number from the hrc images . adopting the value of the cluster center presented above we count 28 relatively bright ( @xmath99 ) stars within @xmath100 ( out of a total of @xmath101 stars detected down to @xmath102 ) , corresponding to a total of @xmath103 high - velocity stars .",
    "this estimate shows that the presence of @xmath104 bh in the center of ngc  6388 can in principle be kinematically confirmed in the near future through accurate proper motion studies or radial velocity measurements with _ adaptive optic _ supported instruments",
    ". however , these measurements can be quite challenging . according to figure 1 of db03",
    ", the high velocity stars are expected to be mainly confined within 0.4@xmath89 ( only @xmath105 from the center ) .",
    "they would have speeds of order @xmath106 which , given projection effects , would give tangental velocities of order @xmath107 . the distance derived by @xcite and adopted here",
    "is 25% larger than that from harris ( 1996 ) , so the resulting proper motions would be @xmath108 . given the current estimate for the proper motion measurement error of roughly 0.3mas , a baseline of at least 35yr would be required .",
