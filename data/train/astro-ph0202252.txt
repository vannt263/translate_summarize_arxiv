    "permitted transitions of in the spectra of gaseous nebulae are very important tracers of atomic processes other than recombination , as well as indicators of the physical conditions of the emitting gas . for many years , @xmath18446 , usually the strongest line in the optical region , has been broadly studied in a large number of objects such as the orion nebula @xcite , planetary nebulae @xcite , and the pre@xmath0main - sequence herbig aebe star lkh@xmath3 101 @xcite . in active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , this feature is very common .",
    "@xcite presented observational data showing that its strength could reach several percent of h@xmath3 .",
    "he associated the emission with a phenomenon restricted to the broad line region ( blr ) .",
    "later , @xcite showed the lack of detectable @xmath18446 in seyfert 2 galaxies , confirming earlier predictions .",
    "usually , resonance fluorescence by ly@xmath2 has been invoked as the single dominant mechanism for the production of @xmath18446 in agn since @xcite .",
    "this process is favored by a coincidence of energy levels between and hi : the 2@xmath4 transition of at 1025.77   falls within the doppler core of ly@xmath2 ( 1025.72  ) for gas at 10@xmath5 k , a temperature that is easily reached in the blr .",
    "if this process is the dominant one , @xmath111287 and @xmath11304 should also be observed , since they are by - products formed during the cascading to the ground level following the absorption of a ly@xmath2 photon .",
    "in addition , the photon flux ratio between @xmath111287 and @xmath18446 should be unity since every @xmath111287 photon leads to the emission of exactly one @xmath18446 photon .",
    "smaller values of this ratio should indicate the presence of recombination , continuum fluorescence , or other processes that enhance @xmath18446 but not @xmath111287 .",
    "determining the mechanisms leading to the emission in agn is important for various reasons .",
    "if ly@xmath2 fluorescence is dominant , photons of this line are converted to those of neutral oxygen , affecting the population of the excited levels of hydrogen .",
    "this process would act as a cooling agent for the regions where the hydrogen lines are very optically thick .",
    "therefore , it is a process that must be taken into account when using photoionization modeling to describe the state of the blr .",
    "also , the lines can be used as a reliable reddening indicator for the blr if the contributions of the different processes to the line flux are known in advance .",
    "to the best of our knowledge , the only simultaneous detection of @xmath18446 and @xmath111287 in an agn was reported by @xcite for izw1 .",
    "previously , @xcite reported the detection of @xmath111287 for that same object . combining previous measurements of @xmath18446 taken from @xcite",
    ", @xcite found that the ratio of photon fluxes between these two lines was equal to unity , providing a direct confirmation that the broad permitted lines observed in an agn arise through ly@xmath2 fluorescence .",
    "interestingly , in the spectrum of izw1 recently published by @xcite , with a higher resolution and spectral coverage , the photon flux ratio between @xmath111287 and @xmath18446 that we derive from their data is 0.76 .",
    "if this ratio is corrected for the e(b - v ) of 0.16 adopted by these authors , it does not appreciably change , but decreases to 0.74 .",
    "thus , contrary to what has been claimed , ly@xmath2 fluorescence seems not to be the only mechanism contributing to the production of @xmath18446 .",
    "we have started a program to simultaneously measure @xmath18446 , @xmath111287 and @xmath113165 in a sample of agn .",
    "our goal is to establish if there is an excess of @xmath18446 emission , as in izw1 , indicating that ly@xmath2 fluorescence is not the only excitation process that may give rise to the broad permitted lines . for this purpuse , near - infrared spectroscopy at moderate resolution ( r@xmath6320 km / s ) covering the spectral range 0.8@xmath7 m ",
    "m was obtained . by combining these observations with quasi - simultaneous visible spectroscopy and archival hst / iue spectra",
    ", we expect to obtain additional information about the radiation processes that govern the emission and to test the usefulness of the lines as a reddening indicator for the blr .",
    "the observations are presented in  2 , a review of the principal mechanisms for the production of the lines is given in  3 .",
    "a discussion of the results appears in  4 .",
    "our conclusions are in  5 .",
    "the sample of galaxies used in this work is composed of six narrow - line seyfert 1 galaxies ( nls1s ) and one classical seyfert 1 galaxy .",
    "all seven objects show bright @xmath18446 , so it is expected that if ly@xmath2 is the dominant excitation mechanism for the emission , @xmath111287 should also be present at a similar intensity .",
    "in addition , data in the uv and optical region are available for the selected sample to help to distinguish other processes that can also contribute to the formation of broad lines .",
    "the reason for the predominance of nls1s in the sample is that permitted lines in these objects are relatively narrow , minimizing the effects of blending with adjacent features .",

    "fluxes were measured by fitting gaussians to each emission feature . in all cases ,",
    "@xmath111287 and @xmath18446 were well described by a single gaussian of similar width . in the optical region ,",
    "if [ ] @xmath1@xmath16548 and 6583 were present , their contribution was always subtracted before deriving the flux for h@xmath3 .",
    "the strong emission that contaminates the wings of h@xmath2 and @xmath14686 was subracted before measuring the flux of these two lines .",
    "for this step , the method used was that described by @xcite , consisting of modeling the lines using a template from izw1 .",
    "the greatest uncertainty comes from the measurement of @xmath11304 , mainly in _ iue _ data .",
    "this line ( actually a triplet at @xmath11302.17 , @xmath11304.86 , and @xmath11306.0 ) is severely blended with @xmath1@xmath11304,1309 . in order to separate the contribution , we used the prescription described in @xcite .",
    "this consists of assuming a @xmath11309/@xmath11304 ratio of either 2 ( optically thin case ) or 1 ( optically thick case ) .",
    "this method can be applied only if @xmath11309 is clearly detected , as is the case for ark564 , mrk335 and tons180 . as in @xcite",
    ", we assumed an optically thick doublet given that for all objects of our sample the ratio @xmath12796/2804 falls between 2 and 1 . in 1h1934 - 063 , mrk1044 and ngc863 , the deblending procedure is more uncertain because of the much lower _ iue _ spectral resolution .",
    "for these objects , we assumed that 75% of the flux in the @xmath11304 feature was due to .",
    "that was the average proportion found in the three objects where the deblending was possible .",
    "another source of error that may affect our results when combining data from different spectral regions , taken at different dates , is variability .",
    "it is widely known that seyfert 1 galaxies are highly variable in the uv and optical continuum and broad emission lines . however , there is little information in the literature about optical and/or uv variability in nls1s , even though they show the fastest variations in the soft and hard x - ray bands . @xcite",
    "systematically monitored a sample of 12 nls1 during a period of one year and found that 10 of them showed significant variations in the optical continuum and permitted lines . ark564 and",
    "mrk1044 , two of the objects from our sample included in giannuzzo & stirpe s study , showed variations of @xmath69% and @xmath610% , respectively , in permitted lines h@xmath3 and h@xmath2 .",
    "more recent data for ark564 derived from a two - year optical monitoring program @xcite showed that h@xmath2 exhibited only minor variability ( @xmath63% ) and that h@xmath3 did not vary significantly .",
    "in the uv region , @xcite , using stis data taken from an intensive two - month monitoring campaing , found flux variations of about 1% amplitude in the ly@xmath3 emission line .",
    "moreover , they checked archival _ iue _ observations of ark 564 taken in jan 1984 and compared these data with that of stis .",
    "they found that the continuum and emission line fluxes are in qualitative agreement in spite of the long span of the observations .    for ton",
    "s 180 , we have compared archival _ iue _ spectra taken in 1992 and 1993 with that of stis used in the present work .",
    "although the continuum from iue presents a shift towards larger flux values ( in a constant amount ) relative to the stis spectrum , the line fluxes shows very little difference ( by less than a factor of 10% ) between the two set of observations .",
    "in addition , our flux measurement for h@xmath2 taken in 2000 is in perfect agreement with that reported by @xcite , ruling out significant variations for that object .",
    "mrk335 was monitored continuously in the optical region during a seven year campaing @xcite .",
    "this nls1 shows significant variability in the continuum as well as in the emission lines h@xmath2 and @xmath14686 with rms fluctuation amplitude relative to the mean spectrum of 8.5% , 7% and 18.8% , respectively .",
    "no uv variability data for this object have been reported . for 1h1934 - 063 and ngc863 no information about variability in the optical / uv region is available in the literature .",
    "optical follow - up taken for other nls1s not included in this work , such as ngc4051 @xcite during a three - year campaing , shows rms fluctuation amplitude relative to the mean spectrum of 9.5% in h@xmath2 .    from above",
    ", it can be seen that variability has little effect on our data . even adopting a conservative error of 10% when combining uv / near - ir or uv / optical measurements ,",
    "that estimate is within the uncertainties due to the deblending and s / n of the uv lines .",
    "moreover , due to the fact that the lines are formed in the outermost portion of the blr ( see @xcite ) , it is expected that their variability amplitude be even smaller that that found for other broad line features .",
    "@xmath18446 can be produced by four known mechanisms : recombination , collisional excitation , continuum fluorescence , and ly@xmath2 fluorescence .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , and @xcite gave a complete review of these four processes .",
    "for this reason , here we will only focus on the resulting emission lines arising from each of them .",
    "besides @xmath18446 , recombination and collisional excitation also forms @xmath17774 , while continuum fluorescence forms @xmath17002 , @xmath17524 and @xmath113165 .",
    "ly@xmath2 fluorescence , also known as bowen fluorescence , does not produce neither of the last four lines ; their absence is a good indicator of the predominance of this mechanism .",
    "ly@xmath2 fluorescence takes advantage of the near coincidence of the energy levels of ly@xmath2 ( 1025.72  ) and the 2@xmath4 transition of at 1025.77 , as can be seen in figure  [ oiniveis ] . at 10@xmath5 k , a typical temperature within the blr",
    ", the difference in wavelength falls within the doppler core of ly@xmath2 .",
    "when excitation to the 3@xmath13 occurs , the electron may return directly to the ground state or otherwise suffer a series of transitions producing photons at @xmath111287 , @xmath18446 , and @xmath11304 before arriving at the ground state .    until now",
    ", ly@xmath2 fluorescence has been the favoured mechanism for the production of @xmath18446 in agn @xcite .",
    "the reason for this conclusion has been the apparent lack of detection of additional transitions such as @xmath17002 and @xmath17774 .",
    "however , weak broad features in low resolution spectra tend to be smeared out when the nuclear continuum is strong and the s / n low .",
    "a direct confirmation of the predominance of the bowen fluorescence can be obtained by measuring the photon flux ratio between @xmath111287 and @xmath18446 , which must be unity ( assuming no internal reddening ) .",
    "lower values would indicate the presence of one of the other three mechanisms mentioned above , or some combination of these .",
    "this test has been elusive in agns for many years because of the lack of suitable observations and dectectors in the near - ir . to the best of our knowledge",
    ", the only detection of @xmath111287 to date in an agn has been for the prototype nls1 izw1 .",
    "nonetheless , we find an inconsistency in the published data .",
    "@xcite provided a direct confirmation of the bowen mechanism in izw1 by deriving an @xmath111287/@xmath18446 photon flux ratio of 1.02 .",
    "using more recent and higher quality data , taken at a higher resolution by @xcite for the same object , we derive a photon flux ratio of 0.76 using the emission line flux reported by those authors in their table 1 .",
    "@xcite combine data taken at different times with a different instrumental setup and resolution , while in @xcite , both lines are observed simultaneously , with a superior quality spectrograph .",
    "our estimate implies that in izw1 , contrary to what was previously found , @xmath18446 is formed by more than one process .",
    "table  [ ratios ] lists , in column 2 , the @xmath111287/@xmath18446 ( hereafter roi@xmath14 ) flux ratio and , in column 3 , the photon flux ratio of these two lines , derived for the objects in our sample . only in tons180 and ark564 , does the observational evidence points to ly@xmath2 fluorescence as the dominant mechanism for the production of @xmath18446 since the photon flux ratio is near unity .",
    "but in mrk1044 , for example , ly@xmath2 fluorescence accounts for only @xmath640% of the observed @xmath18446",
    ". evidently , additional excitation mechanisms that enhance @xmath18446 relative to @xmath111287 are at work .",
    "reddening can not be invoked to explain this discrepancy because its net effect is the opposite : to reduce @xmath18446 relative to @xmath111287 . if the line ratios in table  [ ratios ] are affected by reddening , after correcting for this effect they will appear even smaller .",
    "it may be argued that the deficit of @xmath111287 photons can be due to strong , sharp , atmospheric absortion lines not readily apparent in low - resolution spectra .",
    "if such a line falls near @xmath111287 ( in the earth - frame wavelength ) , it can substantially affect the measured flux of the latter .",
    "@xcite addressed this possibility in his study of @xmath110830 in planetary nebulae and concluded that this effect could reduce the intensity of @xmath110830 by as much as 20%@xmath025% .",
    "nonetheless , as he stressed , the effect can be dramatic in sharp - lined objects such as hii regions and planetary nebulae .",
    "for the particular case of @xmath111287 , this line is spread over at least 21 pixels ( the narrowest full width at zero - intensity measured for @xmath111287 ) and located in different regions of the ccd due to the different redshifts of the objects .",
    "we consider that for @xmath111287 , the most serious effect is not due due to strong , sharp , atmospheric absortion lines but broad atmospheric bands located blueward of @xmath111287 . if they are not adequately cancelled out after dividing the object s spectrum by that of the telluric star , the shape and flux of the line can be seriously affected .",
    "figure  [ stardiv ] shows , for every object , the observed spectrum , the spectrum of the telluric star observed at similar airmass , and the resulting spectrum after the division , in the region around @xmath111287 .",
    "note that in all cases the atmospheric features were cleanly removed . although some residuals may be present , by no way they do not affect the flux of @xmath111287 .",
    "also , the fact that the shape and width of @xmath111287 is essentially the same as that of @xmath18446 ( see @xcite ) , confirms that the deficit of photons in @xmath111287 can not be due to this effect . regarding @xmath18446 , the position where it falls is far from any atmospheric absorption feature .",
    "the nearest one is located redward of 9000   ( in the earth - frame wavelength ) while for the galaxy with the largest redshift ( tons180 ) , @xmath18446 is located at 8970  .",
    "the results obtained in the last section provide , for the first time , strong evidence that ly@xmath2 fluorescence can not be the only process responsible for the observed strength of @xmath18446 in most agns of our sample . in order to study",
    "which of the remaining three mechanisms already mentioned ( continnum fluorescence , recombination and collisional ionization ) are also producing @xmath18446 , we use other permitted lines of as diagnostics tools .    according to @xcite ,",
    "continuum fluorescence can be probed by the presence of lines such us @xmath17254 , @xmath17002 and @xmath113165 .",
    "the later line is , in fact , a very good test because it should be one of the strongest ones , with a strength similar to that of @xmath111287 , if that process is present .",
    "unfortunately , observing @xmath113165 is not always easy .",
    "depending on the radial velocity of the galaxy , it may fall very near or within a strong atmospheric band located between 13300   and 14150  , preventing its observation .",
    "we have searched carefully in the spectra for the presence of @xmath113165 .",
    "no conclusive evidence of this line was found in any galaxy .",
    "upper limits derived for its flux are listed in table  [ fluxes ] . in all cases ,",
    "it is detected at a limit of @xmath150.1f@xmath16 . in tons180 and ngc863",
    "it is not observable at all because it falls within a region of poor transmission .",
    "we also searched for @xmath17002 and @xmath17254 in 1h1934 - 063 . in the high resolution spectrum of this object ,",
    "the former line is clearly present , as can be seen in figure  [ oi7002 ] . for the latter line ,",
    "an upper limit for its flux was derived .",
    "table  [ 1h1934flux ] lists the values found . for ark564",
    ", no trace of @xmath17002 can be seen in the spectrum published by @xcite .",
    "the lack of additional lines that should be observed if continuum fluorescence is also responsible for @xmath18446 emission and , most importantly , the very low upper limit measured to @xmath113165 , leads us to conclude that this mechanism , although probably present , can not be responsible for the observed excess of @xmath18446 emission .",
    "recombination is another excitation mechanism that could help to explain the strength of @xmath18446 .",
    "however , this process produces numerous lines located in the visible region , arising from triplet and quintet configurations , in proportions corresponding to the ratio of their statistical weights @xcite .",
    "this implies that some of the additional lines should have comparable or larger intensities than @xmath18446 . in 1h1934 - 063 ,",
    "for which we have complete wavelength coverage from 0.37@xmath7 m to 2.4@xmath7 m , the only quintet line of detected at 3@xmath12 level is @xmath17774 ( 3@xmath17 ) .",
    "this line is the quintet counterpart of @xmath18446 .",
    "its predicted relative intensity , assuming recombination as the excitation mechanism , should be @xmath17774/@xmath18446 @xmath61.7 @xcite . that value is 40 times higher than the observed one ( @xmath17774/@xmath18446 @xmath60.07 , see table  [ 1h1934flux ] ) . for this object , if we subtract the fraction of the @xmath18446 flux produced by ly@xmath2 fluorescence , the resulting @xmath17774/@xmath18446 ratio is 0.2 , nearly 20 times weaker than its theoretical prediction .",
    "the other object for which observations around @xmath17774 are available is tons180 .",
    "the upper limit derived for this feature , also listed in table  [ 1h1934flux ] , is two orders of magnitude weaker than the theoretical prediction .",
    "however , it is not expected that this line be strong in tons180 since ly@xmath2 fluorescence accounts for the total @xmath18446 emission .",
    "in addition to @xmath17774 , we detect in 1h1934 - 063 , @xmath17990 ( see figure  [ oi7002 ] ) and @xmath16048",
    ". a blip at this later position is also observed in the spectrum of ark564 .",
    "nonetheless , their intensities are always a few percent of @xmath18446 .",
    "for this reason , we conclude that recombination is certainly present but it can not explain alone the excess of @xmath18446 observed in most of the objects .",
    "the only possibility that remains to be explored is collisional excitation by electrons .",
    "@xcite states that if this mechanism is operating , the predicted @xmath17774/@xmath18446 ratio would be 0.3 .",
    "that value is near the observed ratio ( 0.2 ) derived in 1h1934 - 063 after removing the contribution of ly@xmath2 fluorescence for @xmath18446 .",
    "the lack of observations around @xmath17774 for the remaining objects prevent us from drawing definite conclusions .",
    "however , our data clearly show that l@xmath2 fluorescence can not be considered any longer as the single dominant mechanism for the production of the observed lines in agn . for 1h1934 - 063 ,",
    "for instance , collisions may contribute up to 35% of the observed @xmath18446 flux .",
    "if collisional excitation is responsible for the excess of @xmath18446 emission , in order to this process be efficient the population of the level 3@xmath18 must be significant , i.e. above the boltzman population .",
    "this requires high optical depths in the @xmath11304 line .",
    "@xcite state that with increasing column density , trapping of @xmath11304 becomes important in sustaining the population in 3@xmath18 , and @xmath18446 becomes optically thick .",
    "trapping of @xmath18446 , in turn , builds up the population in 3@xmath19 , eventually leading to trapping of @xmath111287 . as a result",
    ", the growth of these lines is subsequently quenched ; once @xmath111287 is optically thick , all three lines grow only logarithmically with optical depth .",
    "this possibility has been examined by @xcite , who found that the very high column densities ( @xmath2010@xmath21 @xmath22 ) necessary to produce can produce large optical depths in the lines . in fact , very recently , @xcite found that the , and lines have very similiar emission line profiles , both in form and width .",
    "this is interpreted as a co - spatial and emitting regions , which probably share similar physical conditions .",
    "an indication that @xmath18446 is thick would be branching from its upper level to 3@xmath23 , by the ] @xmath16726 line @xcite .",
    "this line is very close to [ ]",
    "@xmath16717,6731 , a commom doublet in seyfert 1 galaxies , so if this pair of lines is present , it may mask the observation of ] @xmath16726 .",
    "we have searched our spectra in order to find evidences for @xmath16726 .",
    "table  [ 1h1934flux ] list the derived upper limits . in none of the four objects where this measurement was possible was the @xmath16726 line present at a level greater than 0.04@xmath24(@xmath18446 ) .",
    "we conclude that the intensity of @xmath18446 is not significantly altered by optical depth effects .",
    "probably , after the upper 3@xmath19 level is significantly populated , the electrons are rapidly promoted to the upper @xmath25 and @xmath26 levels because of their close proximity in energy ( less than 2 ev ) , producing the additional lines detected and increasing the flux of @xmath18446 .      according to the grotrian diagram of figure  [ oiniveis ] , independent of the excitation mechanism ,",
    "every @xmath18446 photon should produce a @xmath11304 photon .",
    "theoretically , the photon flux ratio @xmath11304/@xmath18446 ( roi@xmath27 , hereafter ) must be equal to unity except when reddening is present , in which case , it should be smaller .",
    "@xcite found that the intrinsic roi@xmath27 can vary from 1 to 0.63 even in the absence of reddening due to balmer continuum absorption of @xmath11304 photons and the production of @xmath18446 by collisional excitation .",
    "@xcite describes three additional proccesses that may destruct @xmath11304 : _",
    "@xmath11304 photons can photoionize atoms that exists in the @xmath28 state ; _ ( ii ) _ collisional de - excitation can destroy @xmath11304 photons ; _ ( iii ) _ the upper term of @xmath11304 ( 3@xmath29 ) can decay to the metastable terms of the ground configuration via the semi - forbidden lines ] @xmath11641 and @xmath12324 ( @xmath30 - @xmath31 and @xmath32 - @xmath31 , respectively ) .",
    "grandi s calculations show that up to half of the @xmath11304 photons can be converted to ] @xmath11641 before leaving the emission cloud .",
    "our data offers , for the first time , the possibility of evaluating , at least to first order , how efficient the destruction of the @xmath11304 photons can be . column 5 of table  [ ratios ]",
    "lists the roi@xmath27 photon ratio derived for the galaxies .",
    "it was determined assuming an intrinsic flux ratio of 6.5 .",
    "note that the uncertainties in this quantity is , in most cases , larger that the estimated error due to variability ( see   [ varia ] ) , meaning that the results are not at all affected by this effect .",
    "except tons180 , all objects show flux ratios significantly below the lowest theoretical limit derived by @xcite . even if in all these objects the @xmath11304 photons",
    "are severely affected by the destruction mechanisms described above , they are not sufficient to explain the break of the one - to - one photon relation between @xmath18446 and @xmath11304 .",
    "tons180 is particularly interesting in this respect .",
    "we had already seen that it was the only galaxy where the roi@xmath33 ratio pointed to ly@xmath2 fluorescence as the dominant mechanism for producing @xmath18446 .",
    "the roi@xmath27 ratio not only confirms this result but also indicates that the physical conditions of the gas is different for this object .",
    "apparently , the optical depth effects that may affect the lines do not apply here .    the departure from the",
    "one - to - one photon relation can be interpreted as due only to reddening or the combined effects of reddening and the destruction mechanisms of @xmath11304 .",
    "columns 2 and 3 of table  [ redd ] list the e(b - v ) inferred from the observed flux ratio .",
    "values listed in columns 2 and 3 assume an intrinsic roi@xmath27 photon ratio of 1 and 1.6 , respectively ( which translates into a flux ratio of 6.5 and 4 ) .",
    "the galactic extinction curve of @xcite were employed in this calculation .",
    "the e(b - v ) derived from the @xmath11304/@xmath18446 ratio points toward low values of reddening in the blr of seyfert 1 galaxies , except in ark564 , which seems to be affected by a moderate amount of extinction .",
    "tons180 , on the other hand , shows evidence of being reddenning free .    in order to compare the e(b - v ) derived from the lines with that predicted from other indicators ,",
    "we have also calculated the reddening using the balmer decrement h@xmath3/h@xmath2 and the @xmath11640/@xmath14686 ratio .",
    "the results are shown in columns 4 and 5 of table  [ redd ] , respectively . a `` n.a . ''",
    "entry means that that particular ratio was not available for measurement in the spectrum and the lack of any value means that the calculated ratio gave unphysically results ( the theoretical values adopted were 3.1 for the balmer lines and 7.2 for the lines ) .",
    "although the results of table  [ redd ] are approximate , mainly because of the uncertainy involved in the knowledge of the intrinsic ratio of the balmer decrement and the lines for the blr , it is encouraging to see that the agreement between the different reddening indicators for the same object , are good to within 0.1 mag of uncertainty .",
    "in particular , for tons180 , and mrk1044 , the three indicators agree to very little or no reddening at all , while for ark564 , they clearly confirm the presence of dust .",
    "the highest discrepancy is observed in 1h1934 - 063 .",
    "this result can be explained if we consider that the s / n of the uv spectrum is very low and just upper limits to the flux of the lines were derived .",
    "it is also interesting to see that the values of e(b - v ) derived assuming an intrinsic @xmath11304/@xmath18446 flux ratio of 4 are closer to the ones derives using other indicators than if we assume an intrinsic ratio of 6.5 ( except for tons180 ) .",
    "this provides strong observational support to the hypothesis of @xmath11304 photons being destroyed by balmer continuum absorption and the formation of @xmath18446 by collisional excitation .",
    "although detailed modelling of the blr is beyond the scope of this paper , it would be important to estimate how much the intrinsic @xmath111287/@xmath18446 ratio is affected by this latter effect .",
    "the data provided here is a good starting point to investigate the physics of the outer blr .",
    "near - infrared , optical and uv spectroscopy has been used to study the excitation mechanisms leading to the formation of permitted lines in seyfert 1 galaxies . from the observed @xmath111287/@xmath18446 photon flux ratio , we found that in only one out of seven galaxies , l@xmath2 fluorescence is the single dominant process in the formation of @xmath18446 .",
    "this result clearly contradicts previous assumptions that l@xmath2 fluorescence is the only contributor for the formation of the lines in those objects .",
    "continuum fluorescence is discarded as an additional mechanism due to the very low @xmath18446/@xmath113165 flux ratio measurement as well as the absence of other emission lines that should be present in the optical region .",
    "recombination is not negligible , although its effects on the flux of @xmath18446 seems to be no larger than a few percent .",
    "collisional excitation offers a plausible explanation to enhance the strength of the @xmath18446 relative to that of @xmath111287 , leading to the strong deviation from unity observed in the @xmath111287/@xmath18446 ratio .",
    "this conclusion is drawn from the presence of @xmath17774 in 1h1934 - 063 .",
    "the strength of this line , relative to that of @xmath18446 , agrees with theoretical predictions assuming collisional excitation as responsible for the formation of @xmath17774 . in that object ,",
    "up to 35% of the observed @xmath18446 flux may arise through collisional pumping .",
    "collisional excitation is also favoured if @xmath11304 is optically thick , as is suggested by the presence of strong lines , which requires high column densities for their formation .    in the absence of reddening ,",
    "the @xmath11304/@xmath18446 photon flux ratio may depart from its intrinsic value ( from 1 to 1.6 ) because of several mechanisms that destroy the @xmath11304 photons , as well as optical depth effects that favor collisional excitation of @xmath18446 .",
    "the agreement between the e(b - v ) of the blr derived using different reddening indicators ( among them , the ratio @xmath11304/@xmath18446 ) is improved if an intrinsic flux ratio @xmath11304/@xmath18446 of 4 is assumed , meaning that destruction effects for the @xmath11304 line are , in fact , present .",
    "our results points towards low to moderate reddening for the blr .",
