    "impurity - trapped excitons in rare - earth doped materials play an important role in both radiative and non - radiative decay processes of the excited configurations of the rare - earth ions .",
    "theoretical  @xcite and experimental  @xcite studies suggest that non - radiative decay of the excited @xmath2 configuration to the ground @xmath3 configuration can be mediated by trapped exciton states , where the @xmath4 electron becomes delocalized .",

    "srf@xmath0 , and baf@xmath0 form an interesting series .",
    "though their absorption spectra are similar , with absorption starting in the uv , the caf@xmath0:yb@xmath1 emission peak is in the visible , srf@xmath0:yb@xmath1 in the infra - red , and baf@xmath0:yb@xmath1 does not radiate .",
    "caf@xmath0:yb@xmath1 and srf@xmath0:yb@xmath1 have ground - state electronic configuration @xmath5 .",
    "uv excitation can promote one of the @xmath6 electrons to a @xmath4 orbital , giving the excited configuration @xmath7 .",
    "the @xmath4 electron rapidly becomes delocalized onto the next - nearest - neighbor ca@xmath1 or sr@xmath1 ions .",
    "the yb@xmath1 is then effectively ionized to yb@xmath8 , with electronic configuration @xmath9 , i.e.  one @xmath6 _",
    "this trivalent ion attracts the f@xmath10 nearest neighbors more strongly than a divalent ion , leading to a large contraction of bond length .",
    "emission from the exciton states to the @xmath5 ground state involves a large change in bond length , and therefore a broad , structureless , red - shifted vibronic emission band  @xcite .",
    "recent ab - initio calculations have given valuable insight into the quantum physics of exciton formation  @xcite .",
    "however , the broad bands yield no detailed information and experimental information on the structure of impurity - trapped excitons has only been deduced from indirect measurements such as temperature dependencies  @xcite , pressure dependencies  @xcite , and photoconductivity  @xcite .",
    "we have recently showed that it is possible to study the internal structure of trapped excitons in caf@xmath0:yb@xmath1 by using a two - color photoluminesence - enhancement technique  @xcite . by irradiating the crystal with ir radiation after exciting it with uv radiation we induce transitions between exciton states . since some of the excited states have much higher radiative rates than the lowest exciton state we can detect the excited - state absorption by monitoring photoluminescence enhancement . in this work we compare caf@xmath0 and srf@xmath0 doped with yb@xmath1 .",
    "photoionization is known to occur when these materials are excited with uv radiation  @xcite , and the mobile electrons may be trapped by crystal defects , possibly clusters of trivalent cations  @xcite .",
    "ir radiation is known to be capable of liberating electron traps  @xcite .",
    "our enhanced photoluminescence measurement has a component that we interpret as trap - liberation , and we find that the trap - liberation spectrum is very similar for both caf@xmath0:yb@xmath1 and srf@xmath0:yb@xmath1 .",

    "the yb concentration was 0.05% and 0.1% respectively and the purity of the starting materials was at least 99.9% .",
    "the uv component of our two - color excitation was made using uv output of a quantronix topas traveling - wave optical parametric amplifier ( opa ) providing 3 ps pulses tunable in the 250 - 400 nm region of interest in this work at a repetition rate of 1 khz . pulsed infrared excitation",
    "was achieved using the dutch fel ( felix ) in nieuwegein .",
    "the optical output of felix consists of a 4 - 6 @xmath12s macropulse at a repetition rate of 10 hz , containing micropulses at 25 mhz .",
    "felix is continuously tunable from 3 to 250  @xmath12 m .",
    "the opa was synchronized to the fel and the electronic timing between the two lasers could be varied .",
    "the uv and ir beams were spatially ( but not temporally ) overlapped on the sample , held at cryogenic temperatures within an oxford instruments _ microstat _ helium flow cryostat .",
    "subsequent uv / visible fluorescence was then detected using a triax 320 spectrometer equipped with a c31034 photomultiplier .",
    "excitation with 365 nm pulsed uv excitation of caf@xmath0:yb@xmath1 gives results consistent with previous work  @xcite , which reported strongly red - shifted fluorescence having a single - exponential decay with a lifetime of 15 ms at 4.2  k that reduces at higher temperatures .",

    "trap liberation should also have a longer rise time than transition between exciton states .",

    "[ fig : caf2spectrum ] ) and the bottom trace for long times .",
    "the long - time spectrum is presumed to come entirely from trap liberation .",
    "a phenomenological model of a coulomb trap having a threshold of 390  @xmath13 gives an asymmetric spectrum with a width of approximately 400  @xmath13 ( @xcite eqn .",
    "this curve is included in fig .",
    "[ fig : caf2excitontrap ] , and it gives a reasonable representation of the long - time spectrum , though it does not fall off at high energy as fast as the experimental data .",
    "the excitonic states may be modeled in a similar way to the @xmath7 excited states of yb@xmath1  @xcite , with the @xmath4 electron replaced by a more delocalized orbital .",
    "the broad band from 650 to 950  @xmath13 may be attributed to transitions from the lowest exciton state that involves a change in the orbital of the delocalized electron , giving a change in bonding and therefore vibronic broadening .",
    "the width of this band is similar to the width of the phonon spectrum in caf@xmath0  @xcite , which implies that the bond - length change for the transition is small , similar to the change in bond - length between the lowest two exciton states calculated above ( 0.01  ) .",
    "an accurate calculation of the position and width of this band should be possible with a detailed ab - initio approach , as in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the sharp excitation features observed at 250 and 1145  @xmath13 can not involve a change in bonding .",
    "we therefore assign them to changes in the wavefunction of the localized @xmath6 hole or the relative spin of the @xmath6 hole and delocalized electron .",
