    "the vast interest in the physics of charge transport in two - dimensional quantum wells stems from potential applications in new devices and subsequent integration with si - based chip technology .",
    "experimentally , it is known that the charge transport inside a quantum well is strongly affected by the quality of the well . in particular , it is believed that the interface roughness is inherent to the quantum well systems and plays an important role for wells at low temperature with small well widths@xcite . on the theoretical side ,",
    "starting from the seminar work by kardar , parisi , and zhang@xcite , a large effort has been devoted to understand the morphology of thin film growth@xcite during the past decade .",
    "nevertheless , these works only characterize long wavelength properties of the surface roughness , there is no systematic attempt to investigate how the electronic properties , such as the charge transport , are affected by the surface roughness .",
    "the study of the effects of surface roughness on the electronic transport properties has a long history , tracing back to the work by prange and nee @xcite on magnetic surface states in metals .",
    "later , a more complete model was reconsidered by ando@xcite .",
    "quite often , these works are summarized phenomenologically by introducing a local energy - level fluctuation term in potential : @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the energy eigenvalue of the electron , @xmath2 is the averaged well width and @xmath3 is the local change of quantum well width .",
    "such phenomenology finds its natural application in interpreting the photoluminescence data of gaas / alas quantum wells@xcite . in this case",
    ", it has been established that for temperature less than 80 k , the linewidth of photoluminescence is mainly determined by the local energy level fluctuations .",
    "transport properties of two - dimensional ( 2d ) carrier gases at si / sio@xmath4 interfaces and in semiconductor quantum wells are also shown to be strongly affected by the interface roughness@xcite . in these studies , theoretical mobility",
    "is also calculated based on the assumption that the local energy level fluctuation is the dominant effect .",
    "it is known , however , that the experimentally observed mobility can not be explained solely by the roughness roughness . in some parameter regime",
    ", one has to introduce , for example , phenomenologically negative impurity charge to account for the extra reduction of the mobility observed in experiments@xcite .    in this work",
    ", we shall systematically investigate the effects of surface roughness .",
    "our starting point is an averaged version of the hamiltonian specialized to the quantum well configuration . in an expansion in @xmath5 ,",
    "two lowest order terms are considered .",
    "the first term is identified to the local energy level fluctuations @xmath6 .",
    "this term represents the mismatch effect of the energy band .",
    "it was introduced phenomenologically in the literature for interface roughness scattering , but is now shown to be valid only for an infinite potential well or hamiltonians with one single length scale . the other term is shown to modulate the wavefunction and cause fluctuations in the charge density .",
    "this will further reduce the electron mobility .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 , we lay down the formulation of the effective hamiltonian for two dimensional quantum wells . some general features of the effective hamiltonian",
    "are discussed . in particular , we expand the hamiltonian to the order the @xmath7 and discuss its effects on the basis of single particle states . in section 3 ,",
    "we consider the fluctuation of the charge density caused by the wavefunction modulation , and study its consequence on the electron mobility to the order of @xmath7 . in the final section ,",
    "we examine the validity of our approach and conclude .",
    "let us consider a generic quantum well specified by two interfaces at @xmath8 and @xmath9 , where @xmath10 @xmath11 is a two dimensional vector .",
    "the average distance between the two surfaces is @xmath2 ( see fig.1 ) . for simplicity",
    ", we shall impose the hard wall condition on the interfaces .",
    "our formulation is easily generalized to the case when the potential well is finite . to investigate the effects that are due to the interface roughness",
    ", it is convenient to do a transformation that maps @xmath12 to @xmath2 and @xmath13 to @xmath14 .",
    "this transformation is easily implemented by @xmath15 where @xmath16 @xmath17 @xmath18 after transformation , the wavefunction can be generically expressed by @xmath19which satisfies the normalization condition : @xmath20 .    for typical quantum wells ,",
    "the fermi wavelength is about 400@xmath21 .",
    "if l is less than 340@xmath21 , there will be no band crossing at low temperatures , and we can take the average along z direction with respect to a given subband , i.e. , average with respect to @xmath22 ( @xmath23 will be taken to be one ) .",
    "in other words , the more appropriate hamiltonian to work with is defined by @xmath24 after the averaging , we find that an extra potential @xmath25 is introduced to @xmath26 where the laplacian is over the @xmath27 directions and @xmath28 + \\delta _ n\\left ( \\frac 2a\\nabla a\\cdot \\nabla + \\frac 1a\\nabla ^2a\\right ) .",
    "\\label{potent}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "it is easy to show that @xmath35 is generally true .",
    "if we expand @xmath25 to the linear order of @xmath36 and keep only up to @xmath37 , we obtain @xmath38 where we have identified @xmath39 as @xmath40 .",
    "note that the resulting hamiltonian is invariant under reflection : @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "let us first put the last term in the right place .",
    "for this purpose , we consider the two point correlation function of @xmath3@xmath43 if the @xmath44 and @xmath13 are uncorrelated , the cross terms in the above equation vanish . in this case , if one assumes that the surfaces described by @xmath44 and @xmath13 are statistically the same , one obtains that @xmath45 . in other words , both @xmath46 and @xmath13 are of the order of @xmath3 .",
    "therefore , the last term in eq .",
    "( [ potential1 ] ) is of higher order and can be neglected .",
    "in addition to the special case when @xmath47  and @xmath48  are correlated , for instance , if either interface is smooth but tilted , i.e. , @xmath49  is finite , this @xmath50  term will also need to be considered .    in general , the second term in eq.([potential1 ] ) has no definite relation with @xmath40 .",
    "when @xmath2 is the only length scale in the hamiltonian ( e.g. , an infinite potential well ) , @xmath40 has to be proportional to @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "eq.([potential1 ] ) can then be written as @xmath53 .",
    "\\label{potential}\\ ] ] physically it becomes clear that the second term in eq.([potential ] ) describes the local energy - level fluctuation , which was introduced phenomenologically in the literature for interface roughness scattering@xcite but is now formally derived and shown to be valid only for an infinite potential well or any other potential with only one length scale .",
    "it is easy to check that , to the first order in ordinary perturbation theory , the third term in eq.([potential ] ) does not contribute to the scattering matrix for single - particle states .",
    "however , as we shall derive in below , a closer investigation shows that this is not correct . indeed ,",
    "when this term is combined with the kinetic energy , it becomes @xmath54 ( a second order term has been neglected ) . obviously , its effect is to modulate the wavefunction for every particle by @xmath55 note that this result is _ independent _ of the depth of the well .",
    "there are two consequences : first , it causes fluctuations in the charge density .",
    "this is a many - particle effect and will suppress the mobility",
    ". we will analyze it in the next section . secondly , even for single - particle state",
    ", it implies that the transmission probability is not one when each particle passes by a step in the interface .",
    "when combined with the landauer formula @xcite , it indicates that the mobility will be further reduced .",
    "we will analyze this effect in the final section .    in summary , to the first order in @xmath3 ,",
    "the surface roughness introduces local energy level fluctuations and local wavefunction modulation for single particle states .",
    "since the surface roughness modulates the single particle wavefunction in a coherent way , the wavefunction modulation does not introduce new scattering . in the single particle level , the effect of surface roughness is entirely contained in the local energy level fluctuations .",
    "we shall see in the next section that when we include many - particle interactions , the wavefunction modulation becomes as important as the energy level fluctuations .",
    "in this section , we discuss the many - particle effect that is due to the wavefunction modulation .",
    "we shall demonstrate its effect on the calculation of electron mobility .",
    "the change of the wavefunction induces a local modulation in the density of electrons : @xmath56 with the understanding that the normalization is done with respect to @xmath57 . here",

    "the mobility of the electron can then be solved by @xmath126 we see that the interparticle interaction reduces the electron mobility estimated by the energy level fluctuations by at least three quarters . since @xmath127 , the second term in eq.([m2 ] ) due to wavefunction modulation increases the scattering matrix and further reduces the mobility .",
    "the overall reduction of the mobility in comparison to previous approach is about 1/4 .",
    "we note in passing that in general , in addition to the above coulomb interaction , the density modulation induced by the surface roughness also affects any interactions that depend on the electron density . if in the absence of surface roughness , the interaction is described by @xmath128 ,  then formally the effect of surface roughness can be simply included by replacing @xmath129 by @xmath130",

    "this number when combined with the contribution from eq.([m2 ] ) ( 10@xmath179 ) predicts that the mobility is at the order of 10@xmath180  in close to experimental result@xcite .    in conclusion",
