    "in the few hundred central parsecs of the galaxy ( hereafter gc ) clouds are denser ( @xmath1 ) , more turbulent ( @xmath2 km s@xmath3 ) , and hotter than the clouds of the galactic disk .",
    "there is a widespread warm gas component with temperatures of 100 - 200 k first known by nh@xmath4 observations ( see e.g. @xcite ) and now studied in detail with h@xmath0 pure - rotational lines observations by iso ( @xcite , hereafter rf01 ) .",
    "the heating of the warm gas component over large regions where the dust temperatures are much lower than those of the gas is a puzzle .",
    "the discrepancy between the dust and the gas temperature is usually considered to imply a mechanical , rather than radiative , heating mechanism ( @xcite , @xcite ) . with the purpose of investigating the heating mechanisms of the gc molecular clouds",
    ", we have studied a sample of 18 clouds distributed all along the cmz ( central molecular zone ) at millimeter and infrared wavelengths using the iso and the iram-30 m telescopes .",
    "iso has allowed us to study the thermal balance of the gc clouds by observing the major coolants of the gas with temperatures of a few hundred kelvin like h@xmath0 , oi , or cii . in the following",
    "we will review what we have learned from infrared ( ir ) and mm wavelength studies in the field of the large scale study of the gc ism .",
    "we have observed the j=1 - 0 and j=2 - 1 lines of @xmath5   and @xmath6   with the iram-30 m telescope .",
    "the j=2 - 1 to j=1 - 0 line ratios are compatible with cold ( 20 k ) and dense gas ( 10@xmath7 ) or warmer ( @xmath8 100 k ) but less dense gas ( 10@xmath9 ) . however , the column densities derived in both cases are rather similar . in general ,",
    "if one considers a mixture of cold and warm gas the total column densities traced by co will be similar to those derived for gas at 20 k , which vary from source to source but are in the range of @xmath10 ( rf01 )      we have observed several @xmath11   pure - rotational lines ( from the s(0 ) to s(5 ) lines ) with the sws spectrometer on board iso .",
    "the s(3 ) line is strongly absorbed by the 9.7   band of the silicates and has only been detected in the sources with the most intense s(1 ) emission .",
    "the visual extinction derived from the @xmath11   data is @xmath12 mag . after correcting for extinction one",
    "finds that the excitation temperature derived from the s(0 ) and s(1 ) lines ( @xmath13 ) is between 130 and 200  k while that derived from the s(4 ) and s(5 ) lines when detected is 500 - 700  k. there is not a clear dependence of @xmath13 on the distance to the galactic center . extrapolating the populations in the j=2 and j=3 levels ( as derived from the s(0 ) and",
    "s(1 ) lines ) to the j=0 and j=1 levels at the temperature @xmath13 one finds that the total warm @xmath11   column density varies from source to source but is typically of 1 - 2 @xmath14 .",
    "the column density of gas at @xmath15 k is less than @xmath16 of the column density at @xmath17 k. on average , the warm @xmath11   column densities are about @xmath18 of the total @xmath11   column densities derived from co. for a few clouds the fraction of warm gas is as high as 77@xmath19 or even @xmath20 .",
    "this implies that for these clouds almost all of the co emission should arise from warm gas ( see rf01 ) .",
    "comparing with the   observations of @xcite one finds relatively high   abundances of a few 10@xmath21 in both the warm and the cold gas .",
    "there are indirect arguments that points both to shocks and to photo - dissociation regions ( pdrs ) as the heating mechanism of the warm gas ( see rf01 for a complete discussion ) .",
    "direct comparison of the @xmath11   data with pdrs and shocks models ( see fig .",
    "[ figexcith2 ] ) indicate that the s(4 ) and s(5 ) lines trace the densest gas in the gc clouds ( 10@xmath22 ) heated in pdrs , shocks , or both . nevertheless , to explain the large column densities of gas at @xmath17 k traced by the s(0 ) and s(1 ) lines several less dense pdrs ( with @xmath23 and @xmath24 ) or low velocity shocks ( @xmath25 ) in the line of sight are required .",
    "the curvature of the the population diagrams is in agreement with the temperature gradient expected in a pdr ( fig .",
    "[ figexcith2]b ) but probably also with a composition of shocks with different velocities . in summary , it is difficult to know if the @xmath11   emission arises in pdrs or shocked regions .",
    "with both the lws and sws spectrometers on board iso we have detected fine structure lines of ions like [ n ii ] 122  , [ siii ] 33 and 18   or [ ne ii ] 12   in most sources .",
    "we have even detected [ n iii ] 57  , [ o iii ] 88 and 52   or [ ne iii ] 15.6   in the few sources located closer to the galactic center .",
    "all these lines of ions with high excitational potentials must arise in h ii regions .",
    "otherwise , one needs to invoke j - shocks with velocities 100   and there is no hint of such strong shocks from the line profiles or the radial velocities of any observed line .",
    "we derive effective temperatures for the ionizing radiation of @xmath26  k , typical of an o7 star ( see @xcite , 2000 ) .    we have observed the h35@xmath27 and h@xmath28 recombination lines in all the sources of our sample with the iram-30 m telescope .",
    "we have not detected any of these lines in any source ( @xcite , 2000 ) .",
    "assuming line widths as large as 100   and an electron temperature ( @xmath29 ) of 8000  k we can set a conservative _ upper limit _ to the number of lyman continuum photons emitted per second by the excitation source of @xmath30 .",
    "this rate is typical of a star with a spectral type b0 or later and effective temperature @xmath31 k.    this implies that the number of lyman continuum photons derived from the radio recombination lines is not the total number of those photons emitted by the ionizing source .",
    "the apparent inconsistency between the radio recombination lines and the fine structure lines disappears if one considers that the hii regions are more extended than the 30-m telescope beam , e.g. , that the ionizing stars are surrounded by cavities with sizes of @xmath32 pc ( @xcite , 2000 ) .",
    "figure [ figdustall ] shows the dust continuum spectra toward a representative sample of sources .",
    "any other spectrum is very similar to one of those in fig .",
    "[ figdustall ] .",
    "the wavelength of the maximum of emission varies from @xmath33   for m+0.76 - 0.05 and other sources with galactic longitude @xmath34   to @xmath35   for the sources located in the sgr c region and even to @xmath36   for a few sources located close to the radio arc .    to explain the dust emission one needs at least two grey bodies .",
    "figure  [ figfitdust ] displays the dust emission of the sources with coldest ( m+0.76 - 0.05 ) and warmest dust ( m+0.21 - 0.12 ) together with the predictions of a model with two grey bodies at different temperatures . for the predictions",
    "we have used the following expression : @xmath37\\ ] ] where @xmath38 represents the planck function and the opacity , @xmath39 , is given by : @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the visual extinction in magnitudes and @xmath42 expressed in .",
    "this model assumes that the warmer component is being extinguished by the colder one .",
    "taking @xmath43 ( the lws beam ) we obtain good fits for the values of the parameters listed table  [ tabfit ] .",
    "lllll + source & @xmath44 & @xmath45 & @xmath46 & @xmath47 +   + m+0.76 - 0.05 & 49 & 1.5 & 16 & 10 + & 7.5 & 1 & 30 & 1 + m+0.21 - 0.12 & 50 & 1.5 & 16 & 6 + & 2.2 & 1 & 47 & 1 +   +    to explain the emission at large @xmath42 s it is necessary a grey body with temperature @xmath48 k. the visual extinction associated to this component would be 3050 mag . to explain the large fluxes observed at large @xmath42 s , filling factors ( @xmath47 ) @xmath49 are needed .",
    "the temperature of the cold component does not vary much from source to source .",
    "in addition to the cold dust component a warmer one is also required .",
    "this component would fill the beam and its temperature varies from source to source from the @xmath12 k of m+0.75 - 0.05 , m+3.06 + 0.34 and m+1.56 - 0.30 ( @xcite ) to the @xmath50 k of m+0.21 - 0.12 and m+0.35 - 0.06 .",
    "the visual extinction associated to this component would be @xmath8 2 - 8 mag , that is , 5 - 10 @xmath19 of the extinction due to the cold dust component .    clearly , a heating mechanism is needed to raise the dust temperature from @xmath48 k to 30 k or even 45 k. for the standard dust - to - gas ratio the extinction caused by the warm dust component is equivalent to a @xmath11   column density of 2 - 8 @xmath51 .",
    "these equivalent column densities are only a factor of 2 lower than the column densities of warm gas as derived from the @xmath11   pure - rotational lines .",
    "the simplest explanation is that both the warm gas and dust arise in low - density pdrs like those modeled by @xcite .    in the external layers of the pdr",
    "the gas is heated via photoelectric effect in the grain surfaces without heating the dust to high temperatures .",
    "for instance , in their  standard \" model ( @xmath24   and @xmath23 ) , the gas can reach temperatures of 100200 k in the first 3 mag of visual extinction into the cloud where on average the dust temperature would be @xmath52 k ( see fig . 3 of @xcite ) .",
    "those values for the pdr parameters are quite reasonable for the gc ism at large scale based on average densities and the far - ir continuum ( see discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "pdr models with @xmath53   and @xmath54 can also explain the @xmath11   excitation temperatures traced by the s(0 ) and s(1 ) lines and the large scale emission of the @xmath11  @xmath55 s(1 ) line ( @xcite ) .",
    "in this scenario , the warm dust component would be located at the gc while the cold dust emission would arise both from the gc clouds and from clouds in the line of sight ( typically @xmath56 mag of visual extinction are due to material located between us and the gc region ) .",
    "iso has , for the first time , measured directly the column densities of warm molecular gas in the gc . on average ,",
    "the warm @xmath11   represents a fraction of @xmath18 of the total @xmath11   column densities derived from @xmath6   and @xmath5   observations .",
    "iso has also detected fine structure lines of ions with high ionization potential that should arise from hii regions .",
    "the comparison of the fine structure lines with hydrogen recombination lines at mm wavelengths shows evidences for an extended ionized component with high effective radiation temperature .",
    "this suggest the presence of a pdr in the interface between the hii region and the molecular material that should contribute to the heating of the warm gas and the dust component with temperatures of 30 - 45 k.    there are many evidences that shocks play an important role in the physics and chemistry of the gc ism .",
    "the high abundances of molecules which are easily photodissociated like  , sio ( @xcite ) and c@xmath0h@xmath57oh ( @xcite ) suggest that they should be sputtered from the grains by shocks .",
    "nevertheless , iso points out that the effect of uv radiation on the gc ism ( and in particular on the heating of the molecular gas ) can not be ruled out with the simple argument that the dust temperature is lower than that of the gas .",
    "first will help to understand the energetics of the gc ism .",
    "for instance , the high spectral and spatial resolution that the hifi instrument will achieve , will be of great interest to study the interplay between the ionized material and the warm molecular gas .",
