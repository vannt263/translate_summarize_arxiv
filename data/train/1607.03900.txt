    "moments after the big bang , a brief period of nucleosynthesis created the first elements and their isotopes @xcite , including hydrogen ( h ) , deuterium ( d ) , helium-3 ( @xmath11he ) , helium-4 ( @xmath12he ) , and a small amount of lithium-7 ( @xmath13li ) .",
    "the creation of these elements , commonly referred to as big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) , was concluded in @xmath14 minutes and currently offers our earliest reliable probe of cosmology and particle physics ( for a review , see @xcite ) .",
    "the amount of each primordial nuclide that was made during bbn depends most sensitively on the expansion rate of the universe and the number density ratio of baryons - to - photons . assuming the standard model of cosmology and particle physics , the expansion rate of the universe during bbn is driven by photons , electrons , positrons , and 3 neutrino families . furthermore , within the framework of the standard model , the baryon - to - photon ratio at the time of bbn ( i.e. minutes after the big bang ) is identical to the baryon - to - photon ratio at recombination ( @xmath15 years after the big bang ) .",
    "thus , the abundances of the primordial nuclides for the standard model can be estimated from observations of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation , which was recently recorded with exquisite precision by the _ planck _",
    "satellite @xcite . using the _ planck _ cmb observations , ( i.e. the second data column of table  4 from @xcite ) . ] , the predicted standard model abundances of the primordial elements are ( 68 per cent confidence limits ; see section  [ sec : dh ] ) : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the fraction of baryons consisting of @xmath12he , @xmath18 , and d / h , @xmath11he / h and @xmath13li / h are the number abundance ratios of deuterium , helium-3 and lithium-7 relative to hydrogen , respectively .    to test the standard model , the above predictions are usually compared to direct observational measurements of these abundances in near - primordial environments .",
    "high precision measures of the primordial @xmath12he mass fraction are obtained from low metallicity ii  regions in nearby star - forming galaxies .",
    "two analyses of the latest measurements , including an infrared transition that was not previously used , find @xmath19 @xcite , and @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "these are mutually inconsistent , presumably due to some underlying difference between the analysis methods .",
    "the primordial @xmath21 ratio is deduced from the most metal - poor stars in the halo of the milky way .",
    "the latest determination @xcite , @xmath22 , implies a @xmath23 deviation from the standard model value ( see @xcite for a review ) .",

    "the abundance of @xmath11he has only been measured in milky way ii  regions @xcite and in solar system meteorite samples @xcite . at this time",
    ", it is unclear if these measures are representative of the primordial value .",
    "however , there is a possibility that @xmath11he might be detected in emission from nearby , quiescent metal - poor ii  regions with future , planned telescope facilities @xcite .",
    "the primordial abundance of deuterium , ( d / h)@xmath5 , can be estimated using quasar absorption line systems @xcite , which are clouds of gas that absorb the light from an unrelated background quasar . in rare , quiescent clouds of gas the @xmath24 isotope shift of d relative to h",
    "can be resolved , allowing a measurement of the column density ratio i / i",
    ". the most reliable measures of ( d / h)@xmath5  come from near - pristine damped lyman-@xmath0 systems ( dlas ) . as discussed in @xcite and @xcite , metal - poor dlas exhibit the following properties that facilitate a high precision and reliable determination of the primordial deuterium abundance : ( 1 ) the lorentzian damped ly@xmath0  absorption line uniquely determines the total column density of neutral h atoms along the line - of - sight .",
    "( 2 ) the array of weak , high order i  absorption lines depend only on the total column density of neutral d atoms along the line - of - sight .",
    "provided that these absorption lines fall on the linear regime of the curve - of - growth , the derived @xmath25(i ) should not depend on the gas kinematics or the instrument resolution . in addition , the assumption that d / h = i / i  is justified in these systems ; the ionization correction is expected to be @xmath26  per  cent @xcite .",
    "furthermore , galactic chemical evolution models suggest that most of the deuterium atoms in these almost pristine systems are yet to be cycled through many generations of stars ; the correction for astration ( i.e. the processing of gas through stars ) is therefore negligible ( see the comprehensive list of references provided by @xcite ) .    using a sample of 5 quasar absorption line systems that satisfy a set of strict criteria",
    ", @xcite recently estimated that the primordial abundance of deuterium is log@xmath27(d / h)@xmath5  =  @xmath28 , or expressed as a linear quantity , @xmath29 .",
    "these 5 systems exhibit a d / h plateau over at least a factor of @xmath30 in metallicity , and this plateau was found to be in good agreement with the expected value for the cosmological model derived by _ planck _ assuming the standard model of particle physics . in this paper , we build on this work and present a new determination of the primordial abundance of deuterium obtained from the lowest metallicity dla currently known . in section  [ sec : obs ] , we present the details of our observations and data reduction procedures .",

    "deviant pixels and ghosts were manually removed , and an initial estimate of the quasar continuum was applied .",
    "the data were flux calibrated using the sdss discovery spectrum as a reference .",
    "specifically , the uves and hires data were convolved with the sdss instrument resolution , and then resampled onto the wavelength scale of the sdss spectrum to determine the sensitivity function .",
    "the sensitivity function was then applied to the non - convolved uves and hires data , with an extrapolation to blue wavelengths where the sdss spectrum does not extend .",
    "the final hires spectrum has a s / n near the dla ly@xmath0  absorption line of @xmath63 , and a @xmath64 near the lyman limit of the dla .",
    "the equivalent values for uves are @xmath65 and @xmath66 , respectively .",
    "+    our analysis method is identical to that outlined by @xcite . in this section ,",
    "we summarize the main aspects of this procedure .",
    "we use the absorption line software ( alis ) package to provide a simultaneous fit to the emission spectrum of the quasar and the absorption lines of the dla .",
    "alis uses a chi - squared minimization procedure to deduce the model parameter values that best fit the data , weighted by the quasar error spectrum .",
    "our line fitting procedure was applied at the same time to both the uves and hires data , to find the model that fitted _ both _ sets of data best .",
    "we simultaneously fit the i  and ilyman series absorption lines , all of the significantly detected metal absorption lines , the zero - levels of the hires and uves data , the continuum in the neighborhood of all absorption lines , the relative velocity offset between the hires and uves data , and the instrument resolution of both datasets .",
    "the continuum is approximated by a low order legendre polynomial ( typically of order @xmath67 , except near ly@xmath0  where we use a polynomial of order 8) . to allow for relative differences in the quasar continuum between the hires and uves data ,",
    "we apply a constant or linear scaling to the hires data , and the parameters of this scaling are allowed to vary during the minimization procedure .    the portion of the ly@xmath0  absorption profile where the optical depth is @xmath68 provides most of the power to determine the total i  column density ; when the quasar flux recovers to @xmath69 per cent of the continuum , the absorption profile flattens and becomes increasingly sensitive to the continuum level rather than the i  absorption .",
    "we therefore fit every pixel in the core of the ly@xmath0  absorption until the lorentzian wings of the profile are 50 per cent of the continuum ( i.e. @xmath70 ; in this case , all pixels within @xmath71 ) . during the analysis",
    ", we fit all of the contaminating absorption features within this velocity window instead of masking the affected pixels . outside this velocity window , we include pixels in the fit that we deem are free of contamination .",

    "hereafter , we assume that all six measures provide a reliable estimate of the primordial abundance of deuterium , @xmath73 . from the weighted mean of these independent values we deduce our best estimate of the primordial deuterium abundance : @xmath74 or , expressed as a linear quantity : @xmath75    to compare our determination of @xmath73 with the latest _ planck _",

    "the new calculation also includes a quantitative error estimate that is better than 1 per cent at most energies and incorporates wave functions that have been extensively tested for accuracy .",
    "we use the numerical uncertainty quoted by @xcite , and do not use laboratory data to inform the theoretical rate ( see e.g. @xcite ) ; at bbn energies , the laboratory data predominantly consist of one experiment that has relatively low precision and is in moderate conflict with the calculation . for comparison , we also consider how the output nucleosynthesis is altered if we use the empirical @xmath7 reaction rate instead of the theoretical rate ( see below ) .",
    "although we use the numerical uncertainty quoted by @xcite , it should be pointed out that no quantitative estimate exists for further uncertainties in construction of the nucleon - nucleon potential and current operators , which could be of similar size .",
    "we have attempted to account for some of this with a 0.5 per cent correlated error on all points of the curve .",
    "we now describe a summary of our bbn calculations , and direct the reader to @xcite for further details .",
    "first , the calculations are initialized with a gaussian random realization of each cross section measurement or ( in the cases of @xmath79 and @xmath7 ) calculation .",
    "the distributions of point - to - point errors and of the ( usually larger ) normalization errors shared by all points from a given experiment are sampled independently . then a continuous , piecewise polynomial is fit to the sampled cross sections .",

    "bbn yields away from the standard model are computed by rescaling the neutrino energy density during bbn by a factor @xmath85 .",

    "however , using the best available bbn reaction rates , we find a @xmath115 difference between @xmath8(bbn ) and @xmath8(cmb ) , assuming the standard model value for the effective number of neutrino species , @xmath136 .",
    "allowing @xmath96  to vary , the disagreement between bbn and the cmb can be reduced to the @xmath120 significance level , resulting in a bound on the effective number of neutrino families , @xmath137 .",
    "( vi ) by replacing the theoretical @xmath138 cross section with the current best empirical estimate , we derive a baryon density @xmath10 , which agrees with the _ planck _ baryon density for the standard model . however , this agreement is partly due to the larger error estimate for the nuclear data .",
    "forthcoming experimental measurements of the crucial @xmath138 reaction rate by the luna collaboration will provide important additional information regarding this discrepancy , since the empirical rate currently rests mainly on a single experiment , and absolute cross sections often turn out in hindsight to have underestimated errors .",
    "the theory of few - body nuclear systems is now precise enough that a resolution in favor of the current empirical rate would present a serious problem for nuclear physics .",
    "our study highlights the importance of expanding the present small statistics of high precision d / h measurements , in combination with new efforts to achieve high precision in the nuclear inputs to bbn .",
    "we believe that precise measurements of the primordial d / h abundance should be considered an important goal for the future generation of echelle spectrographs on large telescopes , optimized for wavelengths down to the atmospheric cutoff .",

    "we integrate the quasar luminosity function over the redshift interval @xmath141 where @xmath142 ; our chosen @xmath143 range is based on the detectability of the important , high order weak i  lines near 915 . at redshifts @xmath144 ,",
    "the earth s atmosphere significantly absorbs the bluest light of an @xmath145 background quasar ( i.e. at wavelengths less than @xmath146 ) , making it impossible to reach the required s / n near the weak iabsorption lines in a reasonable amount of time . at the other limit ,",
    "when @xmath147 , the ly@xmath0  forest increasingly contaminates the high order i  lines ( discussed further below ) ; note that our calculation is largely insensitive to the chosen upper limit on @xmath143 .",
    "the calculated redshift distribution of quasars brighter than an apparent magnitude @xmath148 is then normalized to one .",
    "we use this normalization factor as our reference value to scale the remaining results of our calculation .",
    "this factor allows us to estimate the number of d / h measurements that can be made with future facilities for every one system that can be observed with the current 810 m telescopes .",
    "we now estimate the magnitude limit of the quasars that are accessible to the three , currently planned , next generation telescope facilities : ( 1 ) the european extremely large telescope ( e - elt ) , with a collecting area of 978m@xmath149 , ( 2 ) the thirty meter telescope ( tmt ) , with a collecting area of 655m@xmath149 , and ( 3 ) the giant magellan telescope ( gmt ) , with a collecting area of 368m@xmath149 . assuming all other factors to be equal , we scale the apparent magnitude limit of an 810 m class telescope by its collecting area : @xmath150 where @xmath151 is the collecting area of a next generation telescope , and @xmath152 is the collecting area of the keck telescope . for the future telescopes ,",
    "the typical magnitude limit is in the range @xmath153 .",
    "this magnitude limit is comparable to the u - band brightness of a dark night sky . in order to meet our limiting magnitude criteria stated above ( i.e. to acquire data of @xmath140 near the high order i  lines ) , we must scale @xmath154 ( which does not include the sky background ) to the limiting magnitude , @xmath155 ( which includes the sky background ) . to estimate this conversion ,",
    "consider the s / n equation with and without a sky background term , and demand that both cases yield the same s / n ratio : @xmath156 where the desired limiting magnitude @xmath157 , and @xmath158 is the sky contribution to the total flux .",

    "; this reduction of 12  per  cent is equivalent to increasing @xmath154 in the exponent of equation  [ eqn : flimnext ] by @xmath164 .",
    "similarly , the u - band sky brightness within the projected slit is 30 per cent lower than the value quoted above for a @xmath165 aperture , corresponding to a u - band sky magnitude @xmath166 .",
    "the estimated limiting apparent magnitudes for the three future facilities are @xmath155(e - elt ,  tmt ,  gmt )  @xmath167  21.5 , 21.1 , 20.6 .",
    "we then integrate the @xcite quasar luminosity function over an apparent magnitude range brighter than the above limits , and scale the results to the normalizing factor derived earlier for the 810 m class telescopes .",
    "we now account for the _ relative _",
    "ly@xmath0  forest contamination suffered by quasars over the redshift range that is considered here ( @xmath168 ) ; quasars at higher redshift are more likely to have ly@xmath0  forest absorption that may contaminate the high order i  absorption lines .",
    "to assess the relative contamination , we first need to estimate the number of pixels that are uncontaminated by ly@xmath0  forest absorption over the wavelength range of the weak i  absorption lines ( @xmath169    rest frame ) , for a dla that has a redshift @xmath170 ( where @xmath171 is the redshift of the quasar ) ; dlas with a redshift close to that of the quasar are the most suitable for high precision measures of d / h , since these dlas will exhibit a cleaner ly@xmath0  absorption line profile , and their i  lines are less likely to be contaminated by ly@xmath0  forest absorption .",
    "we note that the condition @xmath170 is satisfied by all six high precision measures considered in the present work ( see table  [ tab : dhmeasures ] ) .",
    "we have estimated the fraction of uncontaminated pixels using the keck observatory database of ionized absorption towards quasars ( kodiaq ) sample @xcite .",
    "the kodiaq database consists of 170 high quality , fully reduced , continuum normalized echelle spectra of quasars , including 93 quasars in the redshift range @xmath168 .",
    "each of these 93 quasars was visually inspected to identify the sightlines that _ do not _ contain a dla with a redshift greater than @xmath172 , since we want to estimate the severity of ly@xmath0  forest contamination in the absence of a dla .",
    "our final sample consists of 49 quasars , which we split into two redshift bins containing 29 quasars with @xmath173 ( @xmath174 ) and 20 quasars with @xmath175 ( @xmath176 ) .",
    "we then calculate the fraction of pixels that exceed a normalized flux of 0.9 over the observed wavelength range @xmath177 , where the interval 915930  includes the rest frame wavelengths of the weakest i  absorption lines .",
    "these pixels are deemed to be free of contaminating absorption .",
    "for the low redshift subsample we estimate a fraction of uncontaminated pixels @xmath178 ; for the high redshift subsample , @xmath179 .",
    "the number of unblended i  lines , @xmath25 , is a binomially distributed random variable . to obtain a confident measure of the i  column density ,",
    "we require that at least two of the five weakest iabsorption lines are unblended , yielding the probability @xmath180 . from this exercise",
    ", we estimate that @xmath181 ( if we instead only require 1 i  line to be unblended , the relative probability is @xmath182 ) .",
    "therefore , a quasar at @xmath183 is roughly 67 per cent more likely to have at least two clean i  lines , than a quasar at @xmath184 . to account for the increased relative ly@xmath0  forest contamination at high redshift , we scale the redshift distribution of quasars by the function @xmath185 where the redshift , @xmath186 , is related to the uv cutoff wavelength by the equation @xmath187 .",
    "the result of the above calculation is shown in figure  [ fig : future ] , where each curve illustrates the number of d / h systems that will be accessible to each facility , relative to the number that are accessible to current facilities , as a function of the uv cutoff .",
    "for example , if 10 high precision d / h measures can be made using 810 m telescopes , the 3040 m class telescopes could deliver more than 200 high precision d / h measurements , provided that the aperture gain ( equation  [ eqn : apgain ] ) is maintained down to at least 3400 .",
    "similarly , if future d / h surveys are restricted to quasars brighter than an apparent magnitude of 20.5 ( equivalent to the gmt curve in figure  [ fig : future ] ) , the current statistics will be improved by over an order of magnitude .",
    "as d / h measures are pushed towards higher precision , it will become increasingly important to observe a large sample of dlas with diverse properties .",
    "this will allow us to better understand potentially hidden systematics , for example , due to ionization or chemical evolution .",
    "figure  [ fig : future ] highlights the necessity for efficient , uv - sensitive , high resolution spectrographs on future 30 - 40 m telescopes .",
    "if these capabilities can be realized , it will become possible to significantly further our measurements of d / h at high redshift , test for departures from the standard model , and explore the chemical evolution of galaxies via the astration of d."

    "<S> using instead a @xmath7 reaction rate that is based on the best available experimental cross section data , we estimate @xmath10 , which is in somewhat better agreement with the _ planck _ value . forthcoming measurements of the crucial @xmath7 cross section may shed further light on this discrepancy . </S>"
