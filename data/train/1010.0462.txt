    "the size of conjugacy classes ( in the topological sense : dense , meager , comeager , etc . ) in the groups of automorphisms of the frass limits has recently become an active area of research .",
    "this is partially due to the newly revealed connections between combinatorial properties of the frass classes and algebraic , topological , and dynamical properties of the groups of automorphisms of their limits .",
    "one of the most astonishing links was established by kechris , pestov and todorcevic in @xcite and displays close relationship between the ramsey theory ( a purely combinatorial area ) and the extreme amenability ( a classical dynamical notion ) .",
    "another reason for the interest in the size of conjugacy classes of polish groups in general , and groups of automorphisms of frass limits in particular , comes from the special importance of some concrete groups , e.g. , the group of automorphisms of the countable atomless boolean algebra ( which is isomorphic via the stone s theorem to the group of homeomorphisms of the cantor space ) , the group of isometries of the rational urysohn space , and the group of order preserving bijections of the rationals .",
    "the reader may consult @xcite for details , examples , and a deep structural theory for the groups with large conjugacy classes",
    ".    in @xcite j. k. truss looked at different possible notions of genericity of conjugacy classes and discussed advantages of each .",
    "in general , conjugacy classes are objects that are difficult to understand , and the relation of conjugation may sometimes be very complicated ( complete analytic ) . motivated by the work of truss , in this paper we look at a coarser equivalence relation than conjugation , namely at classes of topological similarity .",
    "they are much easier to work with and can be used to prove the _ non_-genericity in some cases .",
    "let us recall the definition from @xcite .",
    "let @xmath0 be a topological group , an @xmath1-tuple @xmath2 is said to be _ topologically similar _ to an @xmath1-tuple @xmath3 if the map @xmath4 sending @xmath5 extends ( necessarily uniquely ) to a bi - continuous isomorphism between the groups generated by these tuples @xmath6we denote this relation by @xmath7 .",
    "there is another natural relation on the @xmath1-tuples in @xmath0 , namely the relation of diagonal conjugation , i.e , @xmath8 is conjugate to @xmath9 if there is some @xmath10 such that @xmath11 more generally , if @xmath0 is a topological subgroup of @xmath12 , then one can restrict the conjugacy relation in @xmath12 to @xmath0 , i.e , say that an @xmath1-tuple @xmath13 conjugates in @xmath12 to an @xmath1-tuple @xmath3 if there is some @xmath14 such that @xmath15 it is easy to see that this is an equivalence relation on @xmath1-tuples of @xmath0 and we denote it by @xmath16 ( this relation also depends on @xmath0 and on the embedding of @xmath0 into @xmath12 , but this information is usually clear from the context ) .",
    "the following proposition is obvious .",
    "let @xmath0 be a topological group and @xmath17 , then    a.   relation of topological similarity is an equivalence relation ; b.   let @xmath12 be any topological group such that @xmath18 is a topological subgroup of it , then @xmath16 is finer ( not necessarily strictly ) than @xmath7 . in particular , @xmath19 is finer than @xmath7 .",
    "equivalence classes of topological similarity on @xmath1-tuples are called _ @xmath1-dimensional similarity classes _ , in particular two - dimensional similarity class is a set of pairs .",
    "since conjugacy classes refine classes of topological similarity , if one wants to prove meagerness of the former , it suffices to prove meagerness of the latter ( it suffices , but may be impossible , meagerness of conjugacy classes does not implies meagerness of classes of topological similarity ) .",
    "this sometimes turns out to be an easier task .",
    "for example , rosendal in @xcite developed this idea to find a simple proof of the del junco s result , that each conjugacy class of measure preserving automorphisms of the standard lebesgue space is meager .    hodkinson showed ( see @xcite for the details ) that in the group of order preserving automorphisms of the rationals all conjugacy classes of pairs are meager ( though it is known that there is a comeager one - dimensional conjugacy class in @xmath20 ) . in this paper",
    "we strengthen this result and show that all two - dimensional classes of topological similarity are meager in this group .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the second section",
    "we give a brief introduction to the theory of frass classes , which is the right context for the technique , developed in this paper .",
    "the third section is devoted to the strengthening of the truss s result on classes of diagonal conjugation in the rationals , in the fourth and fifth sections analogous theorem is proved for the group of order preserving isometries of the randomly ordered rational urysohn space . * acknowledgment . *",
    "the author wants to thank christian rosendal for advising him during the process of writing this paper , for posing questions , that are covered here , and for helpful and very inspiring communication and comments .",
    "the author also thanks sawomir solecki and ward henson for helpful discussions .",
    "in this section we give a short introduction to the theory of frass classes . in the next two sections we deal with two examples of them , so it is useful to keep in mind this more general setting .",

    "class @xmath29 of finite structures satisfies _ weak amalgamation property _ ( wap for short ) if for every @xmath32 there is @xmath31 and an embedding @xmath582 such that for all @xmath33 , @xmath583 and all embeddings @xmath584 , @xmath585 there are @xmath586 and embeddings @xmath587 , @xmath588 such that @xmath589 , i.e , in the following diagram paths from @xmath22 to @xmath590 commute ( but not necessarily paths from @xmath23 to @xmath590 ) .",
    "let @xmath29 be a frass class .",
    "we associate with it a class of structures @xmath592 .",
    "elements of @xmath592 are partial isomorphisms of @xmath29 , more precisely tuples @xmath593 where @xmath22 , @xmath594 and @xmath595 , @xmath594 , @xmath596 and @xmath60 is an isomorphisms .        by theorem [ thm : localwap ]",
    "it is enough to show that the class @xmath597 has no local wap .",

    "we have to take further extensions of @xmath131 and @xmath132 .",
