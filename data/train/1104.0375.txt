    "over the course of the past 140 years , the field of professional pure mathematics ( analysis in particular ) , and to a large extent also its professional historiography , have become increasingly dominated by a particular philosophical disposition .",
    "we argue that such a disposition is akin to nominalism , and examine its ramifications .    in 1983 , j.  burgess proposed a useful dichotomy for analyzing nominalistic narratives .",
    "the starting point of his critique is his perception that a philosopher s job is not to rule on the ontological merits of this or that scientific entity , but rather to try to understand those entities that are employed in our best scientific theories . from this viewpoint ,",
    "the problem of nominalism is the awkwardness of the contortions a nominalist goes through in developing an alternative to his target scientific practice , an alternative deemed ontologically  better \" from his reductive perspective , but in reality amounting to the imposition of artificial strictures on the scientific practice .    burgess introduces a dichotomy of _ hermeneutic _ versus _ revolutionary _ nominalism .",
    "hermeneutic nominalism _ is the hypothesis that science , properly interpreted , already dispenses with mathematical objects ( entities ) such as numbers and sets . meanwhile , _ revolutionary nominalism _ is the project of replacing current scientific theories by alternatives dispensing with mathematical objects , see burgess @xcite and burgess and rosen  @xcite .",
    "nominalism in the philosophy of mathematics is often understood narrowly , as exemplified by the ideas of j. s. mill and p. kitcher , going back to aristotle .",
    "however , the burgessian distinction between hermeneutic and revolutionary reconstructions can be applied more broadly , so as to include nominalistic - type reconstructions that vary widely in their ontological target , namely the variety of abstract objects ( entities ) they seek to challenge ( and , if possible , eliminate ) as being merely conventional , see @xcite .",

    "the ontological target of the constructivists is the concept of cantorian infinities , or more fundamentally , the logical principle of the law of excluded middle ( lem ) .",
    "coupled with a classical interpretation of the existence quantifier , lem is responsible for propelling the said infinities into a dubious existence .",
    "lem is the abstract object targeted by bishop s constructivist nominalism , which can therefore be called an anti - lem nominalism .",
    "may be found in section  [ two ] , see footnote  [ root ] . ]",
    "thus , anti - lem nominalism falls within the scope of the burgessian critique , and is the first of the nominalistic reconstructions we wish to analyze .",
    "the anti - lem nominalistic reconstruction was in fact a _ re_-reconstruction of an earlier nominalistic reconstruction of analysis , dating from the 1870s .",
    "the earlier reconstruction was implemented by the great triumviratec .",
    "boyer refers to cantor , dedekind , and weierstrass as `` the great triumvirate '' , see @xcite .",

    "we will analyze these three nominalistic projects through the lens of the dichotomy introduced by burgess .",
    "our preliminary conclusion is that , while the triumvirate reconstruction was primarily revolutionary in the sense of burgess , and the ( currently prevailing ) cauchy reconstruction is mainly hermeneutic , the anti - lem reconstruction has combined elements of both types of nominalism .",
    "we will examine the effects of a nominalist disposition on historiography , teaching , and research .",
    "a traditional view of 19th century analysis holds that a search for rigor inevitably leads to epsilontics , as developed by weierstrass in the 1870s ; that such inevitable developments culminated in the establishment of ultimate set - theoretic foundations for mathematics by cantor ; and that eventually , once the antinomies sorted out , such foundations were explicitly expressed in axiomatic form by zermelo and fraenkel .",
    "such a view entails a commitment to a specific destination or ultimate goal of scientific devepment as being pre - determined and intrinsically inevitable .",
    "the postulation of a specific outcome , believed to be the inevitable result of the development of the discipline , is an outlook specific to the mathematical community .",
    "challenging such a _ belief _ appears to be a radical proposition in the eyes of a typical professional mathematician , but not in the eyes of scientists in related fields of the exact sciences .",
    "it is therefore puzzling that such a view should be accepted without challenge by a majority of historians of mathematics , who tend to toe the line on the mathematicians belief .",

    "a counterexample to the classical extreme value theorem is discussed in @xcite , see footnote  [ lpo ] for details . ]",
    "it is an open secret that the much - touted success of bishop s implementation of the intuitionistic project in his 1967 book @xcite is due to philosophical compromises with a platonist viewpoint that are resolutely rejected by the intuitionistic philosopher m.  dummett @xcite .",

    "what type of nominalistic reconstruction best fits the bill of bishop s constructivism ?",
    "bishop s rejection of classical mathematics as a `` debasement of meaning '' @xcite would place him squarely in the camp of revolutionary nominalisms in the sense of burgess ; yet some elements of bishop s program tend to be of the hermeneutic variety , as well .    as an elementary example , consider bishop s discussion of the irrationality of the square root of  @xmath4 in @xcite .",

    "w.  tait @xcite argues that , unlike intuitionism , constructive mathematics is part of classical mathematics . in fact , it was frege s revolutionary logic @xcite ( see gillies @xcite ) and other foundational developments that created a new language and a new paradigm , transforming mathematical foundations into fair game for further investigation , experimentation , and criticism , including those of constructivist type .",
    "the philosophical dilemmas in the anti - lem sector discussed in this section are a function of the nominalist nature of its scientific goals .",
    "a critique of its scientific methods appears in the next section .",
    "we would like to analyze more specifically the constructivist dilemma with regard to the following two items :    1 .   the extreme value theorem , and 2 .",
    "the hawking - penrose singularity theorem .",
    "concerning ( 1 ) , note that a constructive treatment of the extreme value theorem ( evt ) by troelstra and van dalen @xcite brings to the fore the instability of the ( classically unproblematic ) maximum by actually constructing a counterexample .",
    "such a counterexample relies on assuming that the principle @xmath18 fails .. ] this is a valuable insight , if viewed as a companion to classical mathematics .",
    "if viewed as an alternative , we are forced to ponder the consequences of the loss of the evt .",
    "kronecker is sometimes thought of as the spiritual father of the brouwer / bishop / dummett tendency .",
    "kronecker was active at a time when the field of mathematics was still rather compartmentalized .",
    "thus , he described a 3-way partition thereof into ( a ) analysis , ( b ) geometry , and ( c ) mechanics ( presumably meaning mathematical physics ) .",
    "kronecker proceeded to state that it is only the analytic one - third of mathematics that is amenable to a constructivisation in terms of the natural numbers that `` were given to us , etc . '' , but readily conceded that such an approach is inapplicable in the remaining two - thirds , geometry and physics.see boniface and schappacher @xcite .",
    "] nowadays mathematicians adopt a more unitary approach to the field , and kronecker s partition seems provincial , but in fact his caution was vindicated by later developments , and can even be viewed as visionary . consider a field such as general relativity , which in a way is a synthesis of kronecker s remaining two - thirds , namely , geometry and physics .",
    "versions of the extreme value theorem are routinely exploited here , in the form of the existence of solutions to variational principles , such as geodesics , be it spacelike , timelike , or lightlike . at a deeper level , s.p .",
    "novikov @xcite wrote about hilbert s meaningful contribution to relativity theory , in the form of discovering a lagrangian for einstein s equation for spacetime .",
    "hilbert s deep insight was to show that general relativity , too , can be written in lagrangian form , which is a satisfying conceptual insight .",
    "a radical constructivist s reaction would be to dismiss the material discussed in the previous paragraph as relying on lem ( needed for the evt ) , hence lacking numerical meaning , and therefore meaningless .",
    "in short , radical constructivism ( as opposed to the liberal variety ) adopts a theory of meaning amounting to an ostrich effectsuch an effect is comparable to a traditional educator s attitude toward students nonstandard conceptions studied by ely  @xcite , see main text in section  [ seven ] around footnote  [ ostrich2 ] .",
    "] as far as certain significant scientific insights are concerned . a quarter century ago , m.  beeson already acknowledged constructivism s problem with the calculus of variations in the following terms :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ calculus of variations is a vast and important field which lies right on the frontier between constructive and non - constructive mathematics @xcite . _",

    "the theorem relies on fixed point theorems and therefore is also constructively unacceptable , at least in its present form .",
    "however , the singularity theorem does provide important scientific insight . roughly speaking",
    ", one of the versions of the theorem asserts that certain natural conditions on curvature ( that are arguably satisfied experimentally in the visible universe ) force the existence of a singularity when the solution is continued backward in time , resulting in a kind of a theoretical justification of the big bang .",
    "such an insight can not be described as `` meaningless '' by any reasonable standard of meaning preceding nominalist commitments .",
    "this section analyzes a nominalistic reconstruction successfully implemented at the end of the 19th century by cantor , dedekind , and weierstrass .",
    "the rigorisation of analysis they accomplished went hand - in - hand with the elimination of infinitesimals ; indeed , the latter accomplishment is often viewed as a fundamental one .",
    "we would like to state from the outset that the main issue here is not a nominalistic attitude on the part of our three protagonists themselves .",
    "such an attitude is only clearly apparent in the case of cantor ( see below ) . rather , we argue that the historical context in the 1870s favored the acceptance of their reconstruction by the mathematical community , due to a certain philosophical disposition .",
    "some historical background is in order .",
    "as argued by d.  sherry  @xcite , george berkeley s 1734 polemical essay @xcite conflated a logical criticism and a metaphysical criticism.robinson distinguished between the two criticisms in the following terms : `` the vigorous attack directed by berkeley against the foundations of the calculus in the forms then proposed is , in the first place , a brilliant exposure of their logical inconsistencies . but in criticizing infinitesimals of all kinds , english or continental , berkeley also quotes with approval a passage in which locke rejects the actual infinite ... it is in fact not surprising that a philosopher in whose system perception plays the central role , should have been unwilling to accept infinitary entities '' @xcite . ] in the intervening centuries , mathematicians have not distinguished between the two criticisms sufficiently , and grew increasingly suspicious of infinitesimals .",
    "the metaphysical criticism stems from the 17th century doctrine that each theoretical entity must have an empirical counterpart / referent before such an entity can be used meaningfully ; the use of infinitesimals of course would fly in the face of such a doctrine .. ] today we no longer accept the 17th century doctrine .",
    "however , in addition to the metaphysical criticism , berkeley made a poignant logical criticism , pointing out a paradox in the definition of the derivative .",
    "the seeds of an approach to resolving the logical paradox were already contained in the work of fermat , .",
    "robinson modified the definition of the derivative by introducing the standard part function , which we refer to as the fermat - robinson standard part in sections  [ rival1 ] and  [ rival2 ] . ] but it was robinson who ironed out the remaining logical wrinkle .",
    "thus , mathematicians throughout the 19th century were suspicious of infinitesimals because of a lingering influence of 17th century doctrine , but came to reject them because of what they felt were logical contradictions ; these two aspects combined into a nominalistic attitude that caused the triumvirate reconstruction to spread like wildfire .    the tenor of hobson s remarks , .",
    "] as indeed of a majority of historians of mathematics , is that weierstrass s fundamental accomplishment was the elimination of infinitesimals from foundational discourse in analysis .",
    "infinitesimals were replaced by arguments relying on real inequalities and multiple - quantifier logical formulas .",
    "the triumvirate transformation had the effect of a steamroller flattening a b - continuum .",
    "] into an a - continuum .",
    "even the ardent enthusiasts of weierstrassian epsilontics recognize that its practical effect on mathematical discourse has been  appalling \" ; thus , j.  pierpont wrote as follows in 1899 :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ the mathematician of to - day , trained in the school of weierstrass , is fond of speaking of his science as ` die absolut klare wissenschaft .

    "meanwhile , item ( 2 ) could apply to any exact science , and does not involve a commitment as to which route the development of mathematics may have taken .",
    "item ( 2 ) could be supported by scientists in and outside of mathematics alike , as it does not entail a commitment to a specific destination or ultimate goal of scientific devepment as being pre - determined and intrinsically inevitable .    on the other hand ,",
    "the actual position of a majority of professional mathematicians today corresponds to items ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) .",

    "s textbooks from 1821 onward indicate , he declares at the outset that infinitesimals are an indispensable foundational tool , defines them in terms of null sequences ( more specifically ,  a variable quantity becomes an infinitesimal \" ) , defines continuity in terms of infinitesimals , defines his  dirac \" delta function in terms of infinitesimals ( see @xcite ) , defines infinitesimals of arbitrary _ real _ order in @xcite , anticipating later work by stolz , du bois - reymond , and others .    the following eight questions were posed by martin davis .    how would you answer the query : how do you define a",
    " null sequence \" ?",
    "are nt you back to epsilons ?",
    "not necessarily .",
    "one could define it , for example , in terms of `` only finitely many terms outside each given separation from zero '' .",
    "while epsilontics has important applications , codifying the notion of a null sequence is not one of them .",
    "epsilontics is helpful when it comes to characterizing a cauchy sequence , _ if one does not yet know the limiting value_. if one does know the limiting value , as in the case of a null sequence , a multiple - quantifier epsilontic formulation is no clearer than saying that all the terms eventually get arbitrarily small . to be more specific , if one describes a cauchy sequence by saying that `` terms eventually get arbitrarily close to each other '' , the ambiguity can lead and has led to errors , though not in cauchy ( the sequences are rightfully named after him as he was aware of the trap ) .",
    "such an ambiguity is just not there as far as null sequences are concerned .",
    "giving an epsilontic definition of a null sequence does not increase understanding and does not decrease the likelihood of error .",
    "a null sequence is arguably a notion that s no more complex than multiple - quantifier epsilontics , just as the natural numbers are no more complex than the set - theoretic definition thereof in terms of  @xmath40 which requires infinitely many set - theoretic types to make the point .",
    "is nt a natural number a more primitive notion ?",
    "you evoke cauchy s use of variable quantities .",
    "but whatever is a",
    " variable quantity \" ?",
    "the concept of variable quantity was not clearly defined by mathematicians from leibniz and lhopital onwards , and is today considered a historical curiosity .",
    "cauchy himself sometimes seems to think they take discrete values ( in his 1821 text @xcite ) and sometimes continuous ( in his 1823 text @xcite ) .",
    "many historians agree that in 1821 they were discrete sequences , and cauchy himself gives explicit examples of sequences .",
    "now it is instructive to compare such variable quantities to the procedures advocated by the triumvirate .",
    "in fact , the approach can be compared to cantor s construction of the real numbers .",
    "a real number is a cauchy sequence of rational numbers , modulo an equivalence relation .",
    "a sequence , which is not an individual / atomic entity , comes to be viewed as an atomic entity by a process which in triumvirate lexicon is called an equivalence relation , but in much older philosophical terminology is called _ hypostatisation_. in education circles , researchers tend to use terms such as _ encapsulation _ , _ procept _ , and _ reification _ , instead .",
    "as you know , the ultrapower construction is a way of hypostatizing a hyperreal out of sequences of reals . as far as cauchy s",
    "competing views of a variable quantity as discrete ( in 1821 ) or continuous ( in 1823 ) , they lead to distinct implementations of a b - continuum in hewitt ( 1948 ) , when a `` continuous '' version of the ultrapower construction was used , and in luxemburg ( 1962 ) , where the discrete version was used ( a more recent account of the latter is in goldblatt  @xcite ) .",
    "is nt the notion of a variable quantity a pernicious notion that makes time an essential part of mathematics ?",
    "i think you take zeno s paradoxes too seriously .",
    "i personally do nt think there is anything wrong with involving time in mathematics .",

    "time that s being used in mathematics is not an exact replica of physical time .",
    "we may still be influenced by 17th century doctrine according to which every theoretical entity must have an empirical counterpart / referent .",
    "this is why berkeley was objecting to infinitesimals ( his metaphysical criticism anyway ) .",

    "simon stevin had already made major strides in defining the real numbers , represented by decimals .",
    "some essential work needed to be done , such as the fact that the usual operations are well defined .",
