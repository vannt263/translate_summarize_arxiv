    "over the last ten years , the @xmath8-@xmath9 relation below @xmath101 has been constrained through observations of distant type ia supernovae , and indicates that the universe is currently in a phase of accelerated expansion ( e.g. perlmutter et al .",
    "1997 ; riess et al .",
    "this is supported by recent measurements of the cosmic microwave background angular power spectrum and the galaxy power spectrum .",
    "the standard model provides an interpretation of these results by proposing that the universe consists of only @xmath114% baryonic matter with the remainder in the form of cold dark matter and a dark energy component which drives the expansion .",
    "this cosmology provides a good fit to the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) cmb power spectrum and high redshift supernova data , and is consistent with local large - scale structure and cluster baryon fraction measurements of the matter density .",
    "this cosmology is slightly problematic however as it invokes the use of two unobserved forms of energy .",
    "while the evidence for cold dark matter is considerable , evidence for the existence of a dark energy component remains indirect .",
    "an interesting alternative to the standard model of cosmology recently proposed by freese & lewis ( 2002 ) invokes an additional term in the friedmann equation , proportional to @xmath12 , which results in a universe which is consistent with the recent evidence for an increasing expansion rate , but is both flat and matter dominated .",
    "the need for a dark energy component is therefore removed , and the expansion is driven solely by the new @xmath12 term in the modified friedmann equation .",
    "the theoretical motivation for this cardassian model of cosmology ( see freese & lewis 2002 ) is fairly speculative however , and the implications for einstein s equations of general relativity are currently undetermined .    in order to constrain the cardassian model , it is critical that the observational data used do not assume a prior cosmology .",
    "the simplest constraints can therefore be imposed by the cmb angular power spectrum , high redshift supernova data and local large - scale structure , since in a cardassian cosmology these observables depend on @xmath6 , the cardassian parameter @xmath4 , and the redshift at which the cardassian term in the modified friedmann equation begins to dominate , @xmath0 .    previously , sen & sen ( 2003a ) used predictions for the locations of the first and third doppler peaks in the cmb power spectrum for a cardassian cosmology , and archeops and boomerang data to constrain possible values for @xmath6 and @xmath4 .",
    "supernova data from the calan - tololo project and the supernova cosmology project ( perlmutter et al . 1997 ) were also used to constrain these parameters , since the modification of the luminosity distance in a cardassian cosmology alters the predicted apparent magnitude for supernovae .",
    "these two constraints restricted the parameters to 0.31@xmath40.44 and 0.13@xmath60.23 .",
    "zhu & fujimoto ( 2003 ) also used these supernova data to constrain the cardassian model , and found best fit parameters of @xmath4=-1.33 and @xmath0=0.43 assuming @xmath6=0.3 .",
    "however , it is not clear how the fit is affected for different values of @xmath6 .",
    "more recently sen & sen ( 2003b ) used wmap and boomerang measurements of the locations for the first , second and third doppler peaks to further constrain the parameter space .    in this paper , the parameter space is constrained using the wmap and boomerang measurements for the locations of the first , second and third doppler peaks in the cmb angular power spectrum used in sen & sen ( 2003b ) , and various high redshift supernova datasets taken from tonry et al .",
    "an orthogonal constraint is also applied using an assumed upper limit of @xmath0=1 ; this value is used in order to be consistent with local large - scale structure ( freese & lewis , 2002 ) . in section 2 , the cardassian model is outlined . the supernova analysis method and the resulting constraints for various samples",
    "are presented in section 3 , along with the cmb constraints and the additional constraint imposed by the inferred upper limit on @xmath0 .",
    "the discussion and conclusions follow in section 4 .",
    "= 3 in    = 3 in",
    "an additional term is added to the friedmann equation such that    @xmath13    where @xmath14=@xmath15 , @xmath16 is the hubble constant , @xmath17 is the energy density and @xmath4 is a parameter of the cardassian model .",
    "when the second term dominates , the scale factor @xmath18 @xmath19t@xmath20 , gives rise to accelerated expansion for @xmath21 . in order to determine @xmath22 , it is convenient to equate the first and second terms at @xmath0 , the epoch at which the cardassian term begins to dominate . since @xmath23=@xmath24(1+z)@xmath25    @xmath26^{1-n }",
    "\\label{equation : b_exp}\\ ] ]    assuming the radiation contribution to the energy density is negligible .",
    "this expression gives rise to a modification in the critical energy density such that in a cardassian cosmology    @xmath27    where    @xmath28^{-1 } \\label{equation : fact}\\ ] ]    = 3 in    = 3 in    [ fig : sne_scp ]    = 3 in    = 3 in    which for a flat cosmology is equivalent to @xmath6 .",
    "hence , this modification to the critical energy density is consistent with a flat , matter dominated cosmology .",
    "[ fig : f_fact ] shows the variation of @xmath6 ( @xmath29f(n,@xmath0 ) ) with @xmath4 and @xmath0 .",
    "equivalently , fig .",
    "[ fig : z_eq ] shows the variation of @xmath0 with @xmath6 and @xmath4 .",
    "in order to constrain the cosmological parameters of the cardassian model , firstly , high redshift supernova data is used . since altering the cosmology",
    "modifies the luminosity distance , the cardassian model can be constrained by comparing empirical data with predicted values for the apparent magnitudes of standard candles at known redshifts .",
    "the relation between apparent and absolute magnitude can be written in the form ( perlmutter et al .",
    "1997 )    @xmath30    where @xmath31=@xmath32 is the hubble constant - free absolute @xmath22-band magnitude , and is determined empirically for type ia supernovae as @xmath31=-3.32@xmath330.05 ( perlmutter et al .",
    "1997 ) from the intercept on the hubble diagram.@xmath34=@xmath35 is the hubble constant - free luminosity distance .",
    "the luminosity distance is given by    @xmath36    where @xmath37 in a cardassian cosmology is given by ( freese & lewis , 2002 )    @xmath38    equations [ equation : appmag ] , [ equation : lumdist ] and [ equation : e_sq ] determine a theoretical prediction for the apparent magnitude ( @xmath39 ) of a supernova at a particular redshift .",
    "hence , @xmath6 and @xmath4 are constrained through a determination of @xmath40 where    @xmath41    where @xmath42 is determined by quadrature of the errors on log@xmath34 and @xmath31 . for a more robust determination of the errors , the uncertainty in @xmath31 and the distance should be integrated over the entire parameter space , and an error on the redshift could also be included in the determination of @xmath43 .",
    "however , these makes little difference to the resulting confidence regions and the determination of the errors described above is adequate for this analysis .",
    "the observational data is taken from tonry et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , which presents redshift and distance information for 230 supernovae compiled from the literature and eight new supernovae from the high-@xmath9 supernova search team .",
    "since the techniques for analysing the observational data vary between individual samples of supernovae , the authors have attempted to recompute the extinction estimates and the distance fitting using the methods of riess et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , jha et al .",
    "( 2003 ) and tonry et al . where possible , as well as apply a consistent zero - point for the local distance calibration .",
    "a complete description of this procedure is given in tonry et al .",
    "( 2003 ) .",
    "four supernova subsamples are selected from the 230 supernovae listed in tonry et al .",
    "firstly , the entire sample of 230 supernovae is used ; the resulting 1@xmath1 , 2@xmath1 and 3@xmath1 constraints are shown in fig .",

    "( 1997 ) taken from the calan - tololo survey and the supernova cosmology project are selected ( see fig .  [",

    "thirdly , the 130 supernovae originally published by the high-@xmath9 supernova search team are used to constrain the parameter space ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : sne_hzt ] ) . finally , a redshift cut of @xmath440.01 and an extinction cut of @xmath450.5 mag . is applied where possible , as in tonry et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , in order to remove objects where an uncertain effect is apparent from either local peculiar velocities or host galaxy extinction ; the constraints arising from the resulting 172 supernovae are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sne_fit ] .      in order to further constrain the available parameter space of the cardassian model , empirical measurements for the locations of the first three doppler peaks in the cmb angular power spectrum",
    "are compared with predicted values in a cardassian cosmology . from doran",
    "( 2001 ) , the acoustic scale can be defined in terms of the conformal time    @xmath46    where @xmath47 and @xmath48 are the conformal time at the present day and at last scattering respectively .",
    "c@xmath49 defines the mean speed of sound before last scattering and is constant for a particular @xmath50 and is taken to be 0.52 ( doran et al .",
    "the definition derived by sen & sen ( 2003a ) for this expression of l@xmath51 in a cardassian cosmology is    @xmath52    where @xmath53=1 , @xmath54=1100@xmath55 and    @xmath56    for a spectral index of n@xmath49=1 , the locations of the doppler peaks are related to the acoustic scale by the relation    @xmath57    where @xmath58 is a phase shift arising from driving and dissipative effects in the photon - baryon fluid before last scattering , and is weakly dependent on @xmath6 , @xmath59 and n@xmath49 ( see doran & lilley 2002 ) .",
    "the expressions for @xmath58 for the first three acoustic peaks are given in sen & sen ( 2003b ) .",
    "hence for assumed values of @xmath59 and n@xmath49 , the locations of the doppler peaks in a cardassian cosmology can be predicted for a particular @xmath6 and @xmath4 . in the following analysis , values of @xmath59=0.02 ( e.g. burles et al .",

    "the cardassian expansion model utilises an additional term in the friedmann equation , proportional to @xmath12 , such that the universe is flat , matter - dominated and in a phase of accelerated expansion .",
    "the need for a dark energy component is therefore removed , as the expansion observed in distant supernovae is driven solely by this additional component . in order to constrain the parameters of the cardassian model @xmath4 , @xmath6 and @xmath0 ( the epoch at which the cardassian term begins to dominate the expansion ) ,",
    "it is necessary to select observational data free from any cosmological priors .    in this paper , various samples of type ia supernova data from tonry et al .",

    "[ fig : sne_scp ] shows the 1@xmath1 , 2@xmath1 and 3@xmath1 confidence levels derived from the 54 supernovae included in fit c of perlmutter et al .",
    "this is in general agreement with the constraints imposed by sen & sen ( 2003a ) for the same sample of supernovae , although the constraints are slightly broader , perhaps due to their use of contouring for absolute values of @xmath43 .",
    "since the errors are uncertain , more robust confidence levels can be derived when contouring around a minimum value of @xmath43 as used for the supernova data in this paper .",
    "sen & sen ( 2003a ) also use a different method of analysis in which a different value of @xmath31 is used with an uncertain associated error .",
