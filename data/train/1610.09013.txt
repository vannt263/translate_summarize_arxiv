    "the tracking of fast movements usually entails multiple exposures  @xcite .",
    "temporal resolution is usually limited to the 10 - 100 millisecond range and little research has been conducted on temporal compression . however , in recent years , cs has proved a useful tool to increase the spatial information encoded in dh  @xcite .",

    "coded apertures have also been used together with cs to provide robust solutions for snapshot phase retrieval  @xcite . in view of recent research in cs and dh ,",
    "several natural questions arise : can we extend coded aperture to coded exposure ? can we exploit the unused pixels in exchange for increased temporal resolution ? since holography is naturally suitable for recovering depth information ,",
    "a further research question is whether 4d space - time information can be extracted from 2d data employing the cs framework .",
    "similar discussions have been initiated in the incoherent imaging regime . leveraging multiplexing schemes in the temporal domain , e.g.coded exposure , has been demonstrated as an effective hardware strategy for exploiting spatiotemporal trade - offs in modern cameras .",

    "these methods have proved successful for reconstructing fast moving scenes by combining cheap low frame - rate cameras with fast spatio - temporal modulating elements . while all of these techniques enable high speed reconstruction of 2d motion , incorporating holographic capture offers the potential to extend the capabilities to 3d motion . moreover , in many holography setups , the energy from each scene is distributed across the entire detector so that each pixel contains partial information about the entire scene .",
    "this offers the potential for improved performance relative to incoherent architectures .",
    "our work exploits both spatial and temporal redundancy in natural scenes and generalizes to a 4d ( 3d positon with time ) system model .",
