    "one of the most fundamental relations in extragalactic astronomy is that , at least in the local universe , the masses of supermassive black holes ( bh , with masses @xmath5 ) correlate with the stellar mass and velocity dispersion of the bulges of their host galaxies ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "this is a lower limit because for half of the sample we did not detect an agn component and therefore we are only using an upper limit for their bhar .",

    "this ratio is a few times higher than that measured for the local population of bulge - dominated galaxies ( @xmath138 , * ? ? ? * ) and the local normalization of the bh mass versus bulge mass relation @xcite .",

    "* their figure  9 ) .",
    "this suggests the existence of similar time delays between the peak of star formation and bh growth in local lirgs as well .",
    "in this section we compare the properties of the agns identified in local lirgs with the optically selected seyfert galaxies in the revised - shapley - ames catalog ( rsa , * ? ? ?",

    "this optical sample was spectroscopically selected from the original galaxy - magnitude limited sample of rsa galaxies and is believed not to be biased against low - luminosity seyfert galaxies .",
    "also , as for the sample of local lirgs studied in this work , the seyfert activity in the rsa sample does not appear to be driven primarily by mergers for the majority of the galaxies .",
    "finally , the agn bolometric luminosities of the rsa seyferts are similar to those of the local lirgs .",
    "the median values of @xmath139 for our lirgs are on average higher than those of local seyfert galaxies , especially the nuclear values ( see figure  5 and * ? ? ?",
    "of course , this is not completely unexpected as local lirgs , including those hosting an agn , are essentially selected by their star formation activity , whereas the rsa seyferts are selected by their host galaxy magnitudes .",
    "the latter is more likely probing the stellar mass , rather than the star formation activity .",
    "we can make a more meaningful comparison if we identify the ir - bright seyferts in the rsa sample .",
    "we set the limit to @xmath140 to match approximately the lower limit covered by the ir luminosities of the individual galaxies of our sample of local lirgs ( see table  1 in * ? ? ?",
    "we also included from our sample the newly identified seyfert nuclei with an estimate of @xmath126 .",
    "the values of sfr/@xmath128 for the rsa seyferts are taken from @xcite except for those already included in our sample of lirgs .",
    "@xcite computed the nuclear sfrs from the @xmath4 m pah feature and the mips @xmath141 m photometry , and @xmath126 from the line .",
    "finally , for the few rsa seyferts deemed to have their luminosities strongly contaminated by star formation , we estimated @xmath126 ( and thus bhar ) from their hard x - ray luminosities and using a bolometric correction . in this comparison",
    "we only included rsa seyferts with @xmath142 , to match the approximate agn detection threshold in the lirg sample . with this limit the ir - bright galaxy fraction in the rsa sample of seyfert galaxies",
    "is then @xmath143 .",
    "figure  [ fig : sfroverbhar_onlyrsa ] shows the distributions of the nuclear and total sfr/@xmath128 for the all the rsa seyferts indicating which ones are also ir - bright .",
    "clearly , those rsa seyfert classified as ir - bright have ratios similar to , although slightly smaller than , those of the complete sample of local lirgs .",
    "given the fact that the agns in the rsa sample are not very different from those in the lirgs , the results above would suggest that the bright agn phase comes after and is somewhat distinct from the lirg star forming phase .",
    "this interpretation would be consistent with observational works showing a delay between the onset of the star formation activity and the latter feeding of the agn with the consequent bh growth @xcite as well as with predictions from numerical simulations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "it is well known that the agn fraction increases with increasing ir luminosity from lirgs to ulirgs , and at the highest ir luminosities the agn might dominate bolometrically the luminosity of the system @xcite .",
    "we now examine further the possibility that the ir - bright agn phase comes after the distinct ir - bright star - forming phase .",
    "if that were the case , we would expect the agn fraction in lirgs to be higher at the lowest sfr .",
    "the agn fraction here is computed only for those lirgs with a secure agn detection , that is , a seyfert classification and/or the presence of mid - ir [ nev ] lines . as in the previous section , we computed the integrated sfr of the individual galaxies from @xmath103 after subtracting the agn contribution .",
    "figure  [ fig : sfrwithagnfraction ] shows the agn fraction as a function of the total sfr of the galaxy . there is a tendency for lirgs in lowest sfr bin to have a higher agn incidence ( @xmath144 ) than those in the highest sfr bin ( @xmath145 ) .",
    "alternatively , this could be explained if it is harder to detect agn in lirgs with very high sfrs , especially if it takes place mostly in the nuclear regions .",
    "conversely , it may be easier to identify an agn for low nuclear sfrs and extended star formation .",
    "the first explanation is not likely however , as most of the lirgs in our sample in the high sfr bin also tend to have rather extended sf . in other words , from figure  [ fig : sfrs ] ( right panel ) there is no tendency for the fraction of nuclear sfr to increase with the total sfr of the galaxy .",
    "in fact , in local lirgs the mid - ir emission ( both from agn and star formation activity ) only starts to be highly concentrated in the central regions for ir luminosities above @xmath146 , as shown by @xcite .",
    "we conclude that the higher agn incidence at low sfrs in local lirgs provides further evidence for a time delay between the peaks of the star formation and bh growth .",
    "[ fig : sfrwithagnfraction ]      before we explore the role of the lirg phase in the context of star formation activity and bh growth of massive late - type galaxies ( next section ) , it is important to point out the differences in the star formation histories of merger and non - merger lirgs in the local universe",
    ".    the triggering of the activity in local ulirgs and likely also in the most luminous local lirgs is driven by major mergers . as a consequence , ulirgs tend to host more luminous agn ( quasar or nearly quasar - like luminosities ) , slightly more massive bh and have higher agn bolometric contributions that local lirgs ( see section  [ s : resolvedlines ] and * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "local merger lirgs do show evidence for a recent and intense period of star formation that consumed the gas faster , that is , a _",
    "bursty _ sfr ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) as in local ulirgs @xcite . in this respect ,",
    "most of the local merger - lirgs could be considered as sub - ulirgs and they might go through a future ulirg phase or may already have experienced such a phase @xcite .",
    "major mergers , however , do not dominate in numbers the population of local lirgs , especially at @xmath147 , as inferred from morphological studies ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , in most local lirgs the current episodes of star formation activity and bh growth are likely the result of a less _ violent _ process , e.g. , via minor mergers , fly - by companions , and/or secular evolution .",
    "@xcite showed that most isolated galaxies in their sample of ir - bright galaxies showed on average more moderate optical balmer absorption features than the strongly interacting systems in their sample .",
    "this suggests that in non - merger lirgs there is not a strong contribution from a dominant post - starburst stellar population that would be associated with a recent bursty star formation history .",
    "this agrees with the finding that most of the mass in non - merger lirgs is from evolved stellar populations formed a few gyr ago with a much smaller contribution in mass from a relatively young stellar population @xcite .      the cartoon in figure  [ fig : cartoon ] illustrates our proposed scenario for the current episode of bh growth in a non - merger local lirg typically with @xmath148 ( i.e. , integrated sfr@xmath149 ) .",
    "this ir luminosity marks approximately the border between local populations of lirgs dominated by major merger and populations of disky and relatively isolated lirgs @xcite .",
    "we assume that the galaxy has an old stellar population formed a few gyr ago @xcite and an existing bh .",
    "since the galaxy did not experience a recent major merger but rather a less _ violent _ process that induced the last episode of sf , we can assume an exponentially decaying sfr for it , as @xmath150 where @xmath151 is the e - folding time .",
    "the peak @xmath152 is driven by the @xmath103 limit set above . from the position of local agn on the color - magnitude diagram , @xcite demonstrated that the e - folding time can not be too short ( a few myr or bursty ) or too long ( i.e. , constant sfr ) .",
    "the high agn detection rate in local lirgs @xcite implies that lirgs are able to feed the bh ( i.e. , show agn activity ) roughly during half of the lirg - phase ( defined as having integrated sfr@xmath153 , see figure  [ fig : sfrs ] ) .",
    "moreover , given the moderate bh masses inferred for lirgs ( section  [ s : resolvedlines ] ) , this agn activity is likely to be sustained for @xmath154 , that is , the typical lifetime of the bh growth for @xmath155 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "[ fig : cartoon ]    in this simple scenario , the galaxy would be first classified optically as an hii lirg and would show elevated integrated and nuclear sfrs .",
    "provided that there is a mechanism to bring the gas near the bh gravitational potential , after a time the existing bh starts accreting material at a sufficiently high rate .",
    "then the galaxy would still have a seyfert - like agn luminosity . because there is an elevated nuclear sfr ,",
    "the galaxy would be optically classified first as composite ( agn / sb ) and later on as a seyfert lirg as the sfr decreases . in both cases",
    "the sfr/@xmath128 ratios would be on average higher than those of optically identified seyferts .",
    "after a few hundred million years the sfr would be below @xmath156 and thus it would not be classified as a lirg any longer .",
    "however , the agn phase may be still active for another few hundred million years as seyfert - like agns do not require large amounts of gas to remain active @xcite . at this point",
    "the galaxy would be identified as an optical seyfert with a lower value of the sfr / bhar ratio and a moderate sfr . eventually both the sf and the bhar would be low and the galaxy",
    "may not be identified as a seyfert .",
    "a sfr e - folding time of @xmath157yr and a bh growth lifetime of @xmath158 would reproduce the sfrs as well as the seyfert and composite fractions of local lirgs @xcite . in summary , in the local universe",
    "lirgs with @xmath159 lirgs and an agn represent an early phase of the ( possibly episodic ) growth of bhs in massive spiral galaxies with high sfr , not necessarily associated with a major merger event .",
    "an hii - like lirg phase would predate the agn classified lirg phase .",
    "the latter in turn would be followed by an optically identified agn phase where the galaxy still shows an appreciable sfr but below the lirg limit .",
    "although the triggering mechanisms for the sb and agn activity of lirgs and ulirgs might be different , it appears that the sequence of events is similar .",
    "namely , ulirgs are believed to involve the interaction between two gas - rich galaxies that results first in a high sfr and then an optical qso phase ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "the end product , in contrast , is rather different with ulirgs probably evolving into moderate - mass ellipticals @xcite and non - merger lirgs likely remaining late - type galaxies .",

    "we assumed that probes gas arising from the nlr in the agn lirgs and then used the @xcite relation between @xmath13 and velocity dispersion .",
    "we combined gas velocity dispersions from and [ o iii]@xmath25007 and stellar velocity dispersions from the literature to obtain bh masses between @xmath162 and @xmath163 ( median value of @xmath164 ) .",
    "the derived agn bolometric luminosities of @xmath165 ( median of @xmath166 , see * ? ? ?",

    "although agns accompany the star formation activity in the large majority of local lirgs @xcite , in most cases the agn is not energetically dominant @xcite . using the @xmath4 m pah feature we obtained nuclear ( on typical scales of 1.5kpc ) sfrs for the individual galaxies of between @xmath117 and @xmath169 and using @xmath103 integrated sfrs between 1 and @xmath105 ( for a kroupa imf ) . in a large fraction of local lirgs",

    "we found that local lirgs have a time - averaged value of @xmath171 , which is a few times higher than that of the local population of bulge - dominated galaxies ( @xmath138 , * ? ? ? * ) and the local normalization of the bh mass versus bulge mass relation @xcite .",
    "however , this ratio is similar to the value of local bulge galaxies averaged during the first @xmath172gyr of the last starburst @xcite , that is , before the peak of the bh growth .",
    "local lirgs have on average higher @xmath173 ratios ( both nuclear and total sfr ) than the optically selected rsa seyferts in the local universe .",
    "however , the ir - bright rsa seyferts have similar ratios to those of local lirgs .",
    "since the overall properties of the agns in local lirgs and in the rsa sample are very similar , we concluded that the agn phase comes after and is somewhat distinct from the lirg star forming phase .",
    "the agn fraction in local lirgs appear to be a function of the integrated sfr , with lirgs in the low sfr bin having a higher agn ( i.e. , seyfert ) incidence than those with high sfrs .",
    "this provides further support to the scenario that in local lirgs the peak of intense ir - bright sf activity occurs prior to the agn phase .",
    "finally we put forward a simple model to explore the role of the lirg - phase in the last episode of bh growth at @xmath174 . at these luminosities",
    "most lirgs are not major - mergers , and have an old stellar population formed a few gyr ago and a current episode of star formation .",

    "we propose that an exponentially decaying sfr with a peak @xmath175 and an e - folding time of @xmath157yr together with a @xmath176yr period of bh growth would explain the observed sfrs and fractions of seyfert and composite objects in local lirgs . in this scenario non - merger lirgs hosting an agn represent an early phase of the possibly episodic growth of the bh which is followed by an optically seyfert phase in massive galaxies with relatively high sfr in their host galaxies .",

    "<S> local luminous infrared ( ir ) galaxies ( lirgs ) have both high star formation rates ( sfr ) and a high agn ( seyfert and agn / starburst composite ) incidence . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , they are ideal candidates to explore the co - evolution of black hole ( bh ) growth and star formation ( sf ) activity , not necessarily associated with major mergers . here , we use _ spitzer_/irs spectroscopy of a complete volume - limited sample of local lirgs ( distances of @xmath0mpc ) . </S>",
    "<S> we estimate typical bh masses of @xmath1 using and optical [ o iii]@xmath25007 gas velocity dispersions and literature stellar velocity dispersions . </S>",
    "<S> we find that in a large fraction of local lirgs the current sfr is taking place not only in the inner nuclear @xmath3kpc region , as estimated from the nuclear @xmath4 m pah luminosities , but also in the host galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> we next use the ratios between the sfrs and bh accretion rates ( bhar ) to study whether the sf activity and bh growth are contemporaneous in local lirgs . on average , local lirgs </S>",
    "<S> have sfr to bhar ratios higher than those of optically selected seyferts of similar agn luminosities . </S>",
    "<S> however , the majority of the ir - bright galaxies in the rsa seyfert sample behave like local lirgs . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the agn incidence tends to be higher in local lirgs with the lowest sfrs . </S>",
    "<S> all this suggests that in local lirgs there is a distinct ir - bright star forming phase taking place prior to the bulk of the current bh growth ( i.e. , agn phase ) . </S>",
    "<S> the latter is reflected first as a composite and then as a seyfert , and later as a non - lirg optically identified seyfert nucleus with moderate sf in its host galaxy . </S>"
