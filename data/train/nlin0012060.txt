    "interest in the dynamical properties of open quantum systems at mesoscopic and atomic scales has lead to a rebirth of a form of scattering theory which was originally developed to deal with very complicated nuclear collision processes .",
    "the origin of the scattering theory that we consider here came from the recognition that a collision between two nucleons , one of which is very heavy , can lead to the creation of an unstable , but very long - lived , compound nucleus which eventually decays . in the late 1930 s , kapur and peierls @xcite used this fact to formulate a nonperturbative approach to scattering theory in which the compound nucleus was viewed as a stable object which was made unstable by weak coupling to the continuum .",
    "in the late 1940 s , wigner and eisenbud @xcite developed an alternate version of the kapur - peierls theory which lead to the very widely used r - matrix approach to scattering theory @xcite .",
    "the idea behind both these theories is to decompose configuration space into an internal region ( reaction region ) and an external asymptotic scattering region .",
    "as we shall see , this approach can be made clean and rigorous if there is an abrupt ( in configuration space ) transition between the scattering region and the asymptotic region .",
    "the internal region can be modeled in terms of a complete set of states with fixed boundary conditions on the surface of the internal region .",
    "the internal states can then be coupled to the external asymptotic states .",
    "bloch @xcite and feshbach @xcite both showed that a consistent theory requires that the coupling between the internal and external regions must be singular . in the 1960 s , weidenmuller developed a phenomenological hamiltonian approach to nuclear scattering based on this picture @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian for the interior region was based on the shell model of the nucleus .",
    "the hamiltonian for the exterior scattering region described the asymptotic states .",
    "the strength of the coupling between the interior and exterior regions was an unknown input parameter .",
    "the weidenmuller approach to scattering theory created a framework with which to study the manifestations of chaos in the scattering properties of nuclear systems , as well as mesoscopic and atomic systems .",
    "it is now well known that chaos manifests itself in bounded quantum systems by affecting the statistical distribution of spacings between energy levels @xcite . for open quantum systems , in regimes where scattering resonances are not strongly overlapping",
    ", underlying chaos affects the statistical distribution of resonance spacings and resonance widths @xcite .",
    "if the hamiltonian of the interior region is chosen to be a random matrix hamiltonian , then predictions can be made as to the statistical properties of resonance spacings and resonance widths .",
    "these predictions can then be compared to nuclear scattering resonances , or to resonances in electron waveguides [ @xcite ] , @xcite , and [ @xcite ] and electro - magnetic resonators [ @xcite ] and @xcite whose cavities have been constructed to yield classically chaotic behavior .",
    "the agreement between random matrix theory predictions and numerical and laboratory experiments is quite good .",
    "the weidenmuller hamiltonian is phenomenological and does not have information about the strength of the interface coupling .",
    "the random matrix theories treat the interface coupling as an input parameter . in a real dynamical system , however , one needs a way to rigorously determine the coupling at the interface of the internal and external regions",
    ". a very useful way to fix the coupling at the interface was provided by pavlov @xcite .",
    "the idea of pavlov was that the surface coupling could be fixed by the requirement that the total hamiltonian ( including interior and exterior regions ) be hermitian .    in this paper , we use a simple textbook scattering problem to illustrate and clarify many issues concerning this approach to scattering , and we then use it to study the effect of disorder on the scattering process .    in section ( 2 )",
    ", we describe the  textbook \" scattering problem and obtain exact expressions for the reaction function , the scattering function , and the wigner delay times . in section ( 3 )",
    ", we develop the hamiltonian for interior and exterior regions of the scattering system . in section",
    "( 4 ) we derive the hermiticity condition . in section ( 5 ) ,",
    "we derive the reaction function . in section ( 6 )",
    ", we derive the scattering function and locate resonance energies for the case of a smooth scattering potential . in section ( 7 ) , we use this theory to study the scattering of a particle wave from a random scattering potential . finally , in section ( 8) , we make some concluding remarks .",
    "we will first consider the scattering of a particle of mass , @xmath0 , due to the potential shown in fig .",
    "the quantum particle enters from the right with energy e and is reflected back to the left by an infinitely hard wall located at @xmath1 . a barrier of height , @xmath2 ,",
    "is located @xmath3 .",
    "the schroedinger equation , which describes propagation of a particle wave , @xmath4 , for all times , @xmath5 , is given by @xmath6 where @xmath7 is planck s constant and the potential , @xmath8 for @xmath9 , @xmath10 for @xmath11 , and @xmath12 for @xmath13 .",
    "since the potential is infinite for @xmath14 , no wavefunction can exist in that region of space .    the schroedinger equation for energy eigenstates @xmath15 , for region i ( @xmath3 ) in fig .",
    "( 1 ) , is @xmath16 energy eigenstates in region i have the form @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 is a normalization constant .",
    "the schroedinger equation for energy eigenstates @xmath20 , for region ii ( @xmath21 ) in fig .",
    "1 , is @xmath22 energy eigenstates in region ii have the form @xmath23 where @xmath24 .",
    "the first term describes the incoming part of the energy eigenstate and the second term describes the outgoing part of that state .",
    "the constant , @xmath25 , is a normalization constant and @xmath26 is the _ scattering function_. when @xmath27 , then @xmath28 and the incoming wave is reflected from the wall at @xmath1 with an overall phase shift of @xmath29 since we can rewrite the minus sign as @xmath30 .",
    "thus , @xmath26 , contains information about the phase shift of the scattered wave due to the potential barrier , @xmath2 , in the region , @xmath3 .",
    "we can determine how the two parts of the energy eigenstate are connected by the condition that the wavefunction and the slope of the wavefunction must be continuous at @xmath31 .",
    "these two conditions can be combined into a statement that the `` logarithmic derivative '' of the wavefunction must be continuous at the interface .",
    "thus we must have @xmath32 at the interface .",
    "the function , @xmath33 , is called the _ reaction function _ and it will play an important role in the following sections .",
    "the s - matrix is then given by @xmath34 where the reaction function , @xmath35 since the scattering function has unit magnitude we can also write it @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the phase shift of the scattered wave relative to the case for which @xmath27 .",
    "it is straightforward to show that @xmath38 the time delay of the scattered particle due to its interaction with the barrier , @xmath2 , is given by @xmath39 this time delay is called the _ wigner delay time _ [ @xcite ] .    for the scattering system we consider here , the phase angle ,",
    "@xmath40 is given by @xmath41},\\eqno(2.11)\\ ] ] where @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "the wigner delay time is given by @xmath44 @xmath45 } { \\biggr)}-{2ma^2\\over { \\hbar}{\\beta}}.\\eqno(2.12)\\ ] ] in fig .",
    "( 2.a ) we show the phase angle , @xmath37 , as a function of energy , and in fig .",
    "( 2.b ) , we show the wigner delay time for parameter values , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 . the peaks in fig .",
    "( 2.b ) occur at values of the energy where the particle wave resonates with the barrier region .",
    "the fact that the wigner delay time goes negative for low energies means that when @xmath50 , the particle can be reflected earlier by the barrier , @xmath2 , than it would be if @xmath27 .    in fig .",
    "( 3 ) , we show that exact energy eigenstates as a function of position for a range of energies . at resonant energies ,",
    "the energy eigenfunctions have enhanced probability in the scattering region .",
    "these resonances are also often called _ quasi - bound states _ because they are associated with complex energy poles of the scattering function . in fig . ( 4 ) , we plot those complex energy poles of @xmath26 which give rise to the first three resonance peaks in the wigner delay time .",
    "it is important to note that for scattering systems with higher space dimension , complex energy poles can have a profound effect on the scattering properties .",
    "for example , in two dimensional electron wave guides they can completely block transmission in some channels [ @xcite ] , [ @xcite ] .",
    "most of the interesting information regarding scattering events is contained in the energy dependence of the scattering phase shifts and in the location of quasi - bound state poles .",
    "however , we generally can not find those quantities exactly as we did in the previous section . there are a number of techniques for finding them if the scattering potential is weak , but not if the scattering potential is strong . in subsequent sections ,",
    "we describe an approach to scattering theory which can deal with strong interactions , provided they are confined to a localized region of space . as we mentioned in sect .",
    "( 1 ) , this approach to scattering theory was originally developed to deal with nuclear scattering processes , but recently has provided an important tool for studying universal properties of scattering processes induced by underlying chaos .",
    "we shall use this alternate approach to scattering theory to study the system considered in sect .",
    "( 2 ) , and a similar system with a random scattering potential . in this way",
    ", we can compare its predictions to the exact results which were obtained in sect .",
    "let @xmath51 denote the position operator and let @xmath52 denote its eigenstates , so that @xmath53 .",
    "the position eigenstates satisfy a completeness relation , @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the unit operator , and they are delta normalized , @xmath56 . since the potential energy is infinite for @xmath57 , all states will be zero in that region .",
    "we can divide the completeness relation into three parts , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , and @xmath60 , so that @xmath61 .",
    "however , the operator @xmath62 acting on any state gives zero because the potential energy is infinite in that region .",
    "therefore , we can remove @xmath62 from the completeness relation without changing our final results .",
    "thus , from now on we will write the completeness relation as @xmath63 .    the operators , @xmath64 and @xmath65 , are projection operators .",
    "they have the property that @xmath66 , @xmath67 , and @xmath68 .",
    "this is easily checked by explicit calculation .",
    "the operator @xmath64 projects any state or operator onto the interval , @xmath69 , while the operator @xmath65 projects any state or operator onto the interval , @xmath70 .",
    "in other words , if the state , @xmath71 has spatial dependence , @xmath72 , over the interval @xmath73 , then the state @xmath74 for @xmath75 and the state @xmath76 for @xmath13 .    inside the region",
    "i , @xmath75 in fig.(1 ) , we define a hamiltonian , @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the momentum operator and @xmath0 is the mass of the particle .",
    "the hamiltonian , @xmath79 , is hermitian and therefore it will have a complete , orthonormal set of eigenstates which we denote as @xmath80 .",
    "we can write the eigenvalue problem in the region , @xmath3 , as @xmath81 , where @xmath82 is the @xmath83 energy eigenvalue of @xmath79 and @xmath84 . because there is an infinitely hard wall at @xmath1 , the eigenstates @xmath85 must be zero at @xmath1 .",
    "we have some freedom in choosing the boundary condition at @xmath31 and we will do that later .",
    "the completeness of the states , @xmath80 , allows us to write the completeness relation , @xmath86 .",
    "orthonormality requires that @xmath87 .",

    "the eigenvector of @xmath91 , with eigenvalue , @xmath92 , will be denoted @xmath93 .",
    "the eigenvalue equation then reads , @xmath94 .",

    "the function @xmath99 must be equal to the function , @xmath100 , at the interface , @xmath31 .",
    "in addition , the slopes of these two functions must be equal at the interface .",
    "we couple the two regions of configuration space , at their interface , with the singular operator , @xmath101 .",
    "the coupling constant , @xmath102 , will be determined later . then @xmath103 and @xmath104 it is useful to remember that @xmath105 , @xmath106 if @xmath107 , and @xmath108 if @xmath109 .",
    "note also that @xmath110 and @xmath111 the total hamiltonian of the system can be written @xmath112 the energy eigenstates , @xmath113 , satisfy the eigenvalue equation @xmath114 .",
    "the energy eigenstates can be decomposed into their contributions from the two regions of configuration space , so that @xmath115 where @xmath116 .",

    "the configuration space scattering picture , described in sections ( 3)-(6 ) is a basis for weidenmuller s phenomenological hamiltonian theory of nuclear scattering , and it has provided a framework to look for universal behavior in the scattering properties of open quantum systems whose underlying classical counterparts are chaotic [ @xcite ] . there is now a large body of work [ @xcite ] which shows that bounded quantum systems , whose underlying classical dynamics is chaotic , have energy eigenvalues and energy eigenfunction which have statistical properties similar to those of certain types of random hamiltonian matrices .",

    "<S> a version of scattering theory that was developed many years ago to treat nuclear scattering processes , has provided a powerful tool to study universality in scattering processes involving open quantum systems with underlying classically chaotic dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> recently , it has been used to make random matrix theory predictions concerning the statistical properties of scattering resonances in mesoscopic electron waveguides and electromagnetic waveguides . </S>",
    "<S> we provide a simple derivation of this scattering theory and we compare its predictions to those obtained from an exactly solvable scattering model ; and we use it to study the scattering of a particle wave from a random potential . </S>",
    "<S> this method may prove useful in distinguishing the effects of chaos from the effects of disorder in real scattering processes . </S>"
