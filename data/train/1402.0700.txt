    "one of the most quoted papers in the study of dark matter distribution in galactic halos is certainly the work of tremaine & gunn @xcite , there the authors established a lower limit on the mass of neutrinos composing galactic halos , by considering an isothermal classical distribution of self - gravitating particles , and imposing quantum constraints on the phase space density in the core of the galaxies .",
    "this treatment presenting a peculiar mixture of quantum and classical considerations has always attracted the attention and the suspicion of many astrophysicists and theoretical physicists .",
    "it was in particular the opinion of one of us ( r. ruffini ) , that a self - consistent treatment of quantum constraints in a self - consistent quantum description of the microphysical system was needed .",
    "a long effort so started .",
    "one of the preliminary works in order to prove the analogy and differences between a classical and quantum self - gravitating system was advanced within a newtonian approach in ruffini & stella ( 1983 ) @xcite . there , the problem of a semi - degenerate system of fermions under gravitational interaction was approached , and compared and contrasted with the classical king model .",
    "they proposed a distribution function built for non - relativistic particles , which reads : @xmath4}}{\\exp{[j^2(v^2-\\bar{\\mu})]}+1},\\ , v\\leq v_e \\nonumber\\\\      & = & 0 , \\qquad \\qquad \\qquad \\qquad \\quad v > v_e,\\nonumber % \\label{eq:1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath5 is the escape velocity . in the limit @xmath6 , the usual fermi distribution is obtained",
    ". the other two constant parameters are @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "the relevance of this @xmath9 is that it is an extension of the king model to the case of a fermi gas .",
    "moreover , if the degeneracy parameter @xmath10 is defined , it can be easily seen that when @xmath11 , the non - degenerate limit is reached and the distribution function used by king is recovered . instead , when @xmath12 and @xmath13 the degenerate limit is obtained , and the escape velocity is associated with the fermi energy .",
    "the energy integral , @xmath14 together with the jeans theorem for spherical systems , allowed them to simply relate the escape velocity with the gravitational potential by @xmath15 ( being @xmath16 at the surface of the configuration ) .",
    "they finally solved the poisson equation for @xmath17 , being the mass density given by @xmath18 which is related with @xmath19 via the @xmath20 parameter .    for simplicity , in the attempt to understand the physical interpretation of the parameters ,",
    "an only value for the central degeneracy parameter was assumed for the sake of example , @xmath21 and no other values for @xmath0 were explored at the time .",
    "the different normalized mass density solutions were given for different values of @xmath22 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] .     and fixed @xmath23 .",
    "the dotted curve corresponds to the analogous king profiles while the dashed curve represents the degenerate limit ( taken from @xcite with permission ) . ]    under these special conditions the analogy between the self - gravitating system of fermions and the king model was proven , as well as a first attempt to justify the tremaine & gunn limit .",
    "it soon became clear that these solutions , although interesting in reproducing classical results of the king profiles for a self - gravitating fermion gas , were really extremely restrictive , and not representative of the general solutions for a relativistic self - gravitating system of massive fermions .",
    "these restrictions correspond to three different constraints : 1 ) @xmath23 ; 2 ) the application of a cut - off in the phase space which implies the elimination of an important family of solutions ; and 3 ) the use of a non relativistic newtonian approach .",
    "a fundamental step was made by gao , merafina and ruffini ( 1990 ) @xcite , to include special relativity effects in the phase space of the distribution function , as well as general relativity .",
    "thus , they considered the relativistic fermi - dirac distribution function for the ` inos ' @xcite without any cut - off in their momentum space , i.e. @xmath24 + 1)^{-1}$ ] , where @xmath25 is the particle kinetic energy and @xmath26 the chemical potential with the particle rest - energy subtracted off .",
    "they wrote the system of einstein equations in the spherically symmetric metric @xmath27 , where @xmath28 and @xmath29 depend only on the radial coordinate @xmath30 , together with the thermodynamic equilibrium conditions of tolman @xcite , and klein @xcite , @xmath31 in the following dimensionless way , @xmath32 there , the following dimensionless quantities were introduced : @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the dimensional factor which has unit of length and scales as @xmath38 ; with @xmath39 the planck mass , and the temperature and degeneracy parameters , @xmath40 and @xmath41 , respectively . the mass density @xmath42 and pressure @xmath43 are expressed in terms of the standard infinite integrals in momentum space weighted with the @xmath44 already given , for a relativistic and semi - degenerate fermi gas ( see @xcite ) .    in that work",
    ", they solved the initial condition problem for the variables of the system , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 , by giving at @xmath49 ( and indicated by a subscript ` 0 ' ) @xmath50 , while giving arbitrary values for the temperature and degeneracy parameters @xmath51 and @xmath0 , respectively . in figs .",
    "[ fig:2][fig:3 ] , different normalized mass density solutions for different @xmath52 and @xmath53 respectively are shown , for a fixed non - relativistic central temperature parameter @xmath51 .     and fixed @xmath51 in dimensionless variables .",
    "to note the simple cored plus @xmath54 morphology ( taken from @xcite with permission ) . ]     and fixed @xmath51 in dimensionless variables . to note the more complex core plus ` plateau ' plus @xmath54 morphology ( taken from @xcite with permission )",
    "]    it is important to note that the system ( [ eq:1][eq:2 ] ) has no particle mass @xmath55 dependence when solved in the dimensionless variables , while instead the physical magnitudes such as @xmath30 and @xmath42 have an explicit dependence on @xmath55 trough the dimensional factor @xmath56 .",
    "the fact that they were mainly interested in the general properties of the solutions without going through the physical magnitudes , no particle mass constraints were put there .",
    "we have recently returned to the gao et .",
    "al . work , and propose a completely different way for solving the boundary condition problem for the system ( [ eq:1][eq:2 ] ) , in order to fulfill the observationally inferred values of typical dark matter halos in spiral galaxies as given in @xcite .",
    "namely , for given initial conditions @xmath57 , arbitrary @xmath0 ( depending on the chosen central degeneracy ) , and defining the halo radius @xmath3 at the onset of the flat rotation curve , we solve an eigenvalue problem for the central temperature parameter @xmath51 , until the observed halo circular velocity @xmath2 is obtained .",
    "after this , we solve a second eigenvalue problem for the particle mass @xmath55 until the _ observed _ halo mass @xmath1 is reached at the radius @xmath3 .",
    "the quest has been to use all these information in order to put constraints on the mass of the ` ino ' in galactic halos by introducing the observational properties possibly to be utilized in this research .",
    "interestingly enough , as detailed in @xcite , it turns out that only for an specific range of @xmath58 these two eigenvalue problems can be solved together , implying as a consequence , a novel reach morphology for the density profiles as well as a novel particle mass bound associated with it .",
    "the density profiles presents a quantum degenerate core , followed by a low degenerate plateau until it reach the @xmath54 boltzmannian regime corresponding to the flat part in the rotation curve . in fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] we show a family of density profiles for different values of @xmath0 which fulfills the mentioned halo constraints .",
    "we also plotted for comparison the purely boltzmannian curve which agrees with the same _ observed _ halo magnitudes .     and central degeneracies @xmath0 fulfilling the observational constraints @xmath59 and @xmath60 km / s at @xmath61 kpc ( as taken from @xcite and detailed in @xcite ) . in dot - dashed line the purely boltzmannian profile for comparison . ]    as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] , we obtain from this novel analysis a more stringent lower mass bound for the ` ino ' mass @xmath55 , which is @xmath62 times higher than the ones inferred in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this is , @xmath63 kev@xmath64 for typical spiral galaxies .",
    "it is interesting that the quantum and relativistic treatment of the configurations considered here are characterized by the presence of central cored structures unlike the typical cuspy configurations obtained from a classic non - relativistic approximation , such as the ones of numerical n - body simulations in @xcite .",
    "this naturally leads to a possible solution to the well - known core - cusp discrepancy @xcite .",
