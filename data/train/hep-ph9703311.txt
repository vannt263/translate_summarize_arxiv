    "<S> @xmath11 and @xmath12 of deep inelastic scattering , the excess events occur at large @xmath13 and large @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 . the final states of these events are clean , with a positron and a jet back - to - back in the transverse plane and essentially no missing transverse energy . </S>",
    "<S> figure  1 shows the @xmath17 distribution of the events at @xmath18 from the two experiments . here </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath17 values from the zeus experiment are based on the double - angle method ( to avoid uncertainties in the energy measurement ) ; the h1 data are based on the energy and angle of the scattered positron . </S>",
    "<S> the event rate in the region @xmath10 is about a factor of 2 above the sm prediction and corresponds to a cross section excess of about 0.4  pb .    there are several possibilities that might explain the observed excess . </S>",
    "<S> first , an upward statistical fluctuation could be responsible , although the probability for this at @xmath18 is only 0.6% in the h1 experiment and 0.72% for @xmath19 and @xmath16 in the zeus experiment . </S>",
    "<S> a second possibility is that the parton densities at large @xmath13 are not well understood . </S>",
    "<S> however , it is largely the valence quark distributions which are relevant here and these are relatively well constrained in the high-@xmath13 region by bcdms@xcite , nmc@xcite , slac@xcite and ccfr@xcite measurements . </S>",
    "<S> the zeus collaboration concludes that the uncertainty of this origin is only 6.5% . </S>",
    "<S> another possibility is that large qcd effects occur near the edge of phase space . </S>",
    "<S> however , a very modest @xmath20-factor , @xmath21 is found@xcite over the entire high @xmath2 @xmath13-@xmath14 range probed by the hera experiments and thus there is no indication of large qcd logarithms needing summation . </S>",
    "<S> since none of the above explanations seem particularly promising , it is natural to entertain new physics sources of the anomalous events .    </S>",
    "<S> the most obvious candidate for new physics is leptoquarks ( lq ) or stops with @xmath22-parity violating couplings that are produced in the @xmath23-channel and which decay to @xmath24 and a quark@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> an enhancement in the cross section would occur at a fixed @xmath13-value @xmath25 where @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> the possibilities for @xmath3 production of leptoquarks or @xmath27-squarks are@xcite @xmath28 here @xmath29 is the stop particle of supersymmetry and @xmath30 is the leptoquark state in the 27-dimensional representation of @xmath31 . </S>",
    "<S> the cross - section for leptoquark production is @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the quark distribution in the proton and @xmath34 is the spin of the leptoquark . from the excess in the @xmath9 </S>",
    "<S> cross section , @xmath35pb , we can calculate the leptoquark decay width and estimate its coupling strength . for the above four scenarios , using mrsa structure functions@xcite and @xmath36  gev , we obtain for @xmath37 @xmath38 where @xmath39 , @xmath40 is the total leptoquark width and @xmath41 is the branching fraction to the @xmath42 final state . since the leptoquark width would be narrow , all of the excess events should fall in a single @xmath13 bin , within resolution , in this @xmath23-channel resonance scenario . although the h1 data above are somewhat suggestive of a resonant enhancement at @xmath43  gev ( see the vertical dotted line in fig .  1 ) , this interpretation is not indicated by the combined h1 and zeus data . of course </S>",
    "<S> , two or more leptoquark resonances could exist with similar but non - degenerate masses which could lead to a broader @xmath13-distribution . since </S>",
    "<S> standard leptoquark and @xmath22-parity breaking@xcite stop scenarios have been discussed extensively elsewhere , we do not pursue these interesting possibilities further here .    </S>",
    "<S> a final interesting potential explanation of the hera high-@xmath2 phenomena is new physics in the @xmath44-channel . </S>",
    "<S> any particles beyond the photon and @xmath45-boson that can be exchanged in the @xmath44-channel of @xmath9 must have tev mass scale to be consistent with present measurements of @xmath46 and @xmath47 . </S>",
    "<S> thus models of this type can be generically parameterized by a contact interaction@xcite .    </S>",

    "<S> @xmath53 allows for either constructive or destructive interference with the sm @xmath54 and @xmath45 exchange amplitudes and @xmath55 is the effective mass scale of the contact interaction . in the effective interaction ( [ effl ] ) we do not include lepton or quark chirality violating terms such as @xmath56 . </S>",
    "<S> this contact interaction can arise from particle exchanges in @xmath23 , @xmath44 , or @xmath57 channels for which the mass - squared of the exchanged particle is much larger than the corresponding mandelstam invariant . </S>",
    "<S> a contact interaction may also be a manifestation of fermion compositeness@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> contact interactions which arise from the exchange of a single heavy particle will factorize into two vertex factors . </S>",
    "<S> an example of a @xmath44-channel exchange is a heavy vector boson @xmath58 , which gives @xmath59 where @xmath60 and @xmath61 are the @xmath58 couplings to @xmath62 and @xmath63 , respectively . in this case </S>",
    "<S> factorization implies additional contact interactions for @xmath64 and @xmath65 . </S>",
    "<S> if the interactions satisfy lepton universality there will be further contact amplitudes for @xmath66 , @xmath67 , etc . and </S>",
    "<S> , since couplings to neutrinos are expected in general , @xmath68 and @xmath69 contact interactions would also exist . </S>",
    "<S> there may also be corresponding contact interactions for charged currents such as @xmath70 corresponding to heavy @xmath71-bosons . </S>",
    "<S> thus a rich phenomenology could be associated with contact amplitudes representing new physics beyond the energy reach of present colliders .    </S>",
    "<S> the reduced amplitudes for @xmath72 , @xmath73 , and @xmath74 subprocesses , including standard model plus contact interactions , are given by @xmath75 where @xmath76 and @xmath77 are charges and weak isospins , respectively , of the external fermions @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 , and the mandelstam invariant @xmath81 is given by @xmath82 thus the presence of a contact interaction has interconnected implications for @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 and atomic physics parity violation experiments . </S>",
