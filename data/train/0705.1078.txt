    "a particular example for the latter is the protective extracellular matrix of living cells that is composed of the flexible polymer hyaluronic acid ( ha ) to which semi - flexible aggrecan chains are attached via linker proteins  @xcite .",
    "the ha - aggrecan has recently received an increased attention as it is not only used to equip cells with a protective layer but also plays an important role as gliding surface in the articular cartilage of synovial joints  @xcite .",
    "understanding the material properties of the ha - aggrecan system on the nano- and mesoscale are thus of key importance when aiming at constructing biomimetic surfaces that mimic the function of natural cartilages .",
    "in fact , on the single - molecule scale the ha - aggrecan system can be simplified to a flexible polymer , attached to a planar substrate , with rigid side chains .",
    "flexible , self - avoiding end - grafted polymers without side chains have been studied extensively by theory , experiment and computational approaches  @xcite . typically , a large set of end - grafted polymers has been considered , where the grafting density  @xmath4 , i.e. the distance between individual chains , was varied ( polymer brush ) . in the limit of very low @xmath4",

    "in fact , a more detailed description of the polymer shape requires the gyration tensor  @xcite : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the position of the @xmath9th monomer and indices @xmath10 denote its individual components . using an orthogonal transformation ,",
    "@xmath11 can be converted to diagonal form with entries @xmath12 denoting the squared lengths of the principal axes of gyration while the trace of @xmath13 yields the squared radius of gyration .",
    "the associated eigenvectors of the gyration ellipsoid are denoted by @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 , respectively .",
    "the ratios of the principle axes of inertia quantify the deviation of the polymer shape from a sphere .",
    "using monte carlo simulations it was shown that simple random walks ( rw ) reveal a pronounced asphericity ( asphericity of the rw ) mirrored in the asymptotic ratios @xmath17  @xcite .",
    "self - avoiding walks ( saw ) show an even more aspheric shape ( @xmath18 )  @xcite that becomes more pronounced when attaching the saw with one end to a flat , solid substrate ( @xmath19 for @xmath20 )  @xcite .",
    "the conformational properties of polymer systems comprising side chains branching out from a flexible or semi - flexible backbone at varying density ( comb polymers ) have also been considered extensively in theory and simulation studies  @xcite .",
    "the flexibility of the entire complex has been shown to be strongly influenced by the density of flexible side chains @xmath21 with three scaling regimes in case for a free ( i.e. not end - grafted ) backbone  @xcite .",
    "one of the main results was that attaching a large number of flexible side chains stiffens an otherwise flexible backbone .",
    "rigid side chains induced larger local fluctuations of the backbone as compared to flexible side chains  @xcite , yet the persistence length of the entire complex was shown to grow super - linear with the length of the side chains in contrast to the much weaker dependency in case of flexible side chains . in other words , attaching a large number of rigid side chains yields an efficient way to stiffen a flexible backbone . here",
    ", we investigate the conformation of a flexible , end - grafted self - avoiding chain of length @xmath0 with a _ single _ rigid side chain ( length @xmath1 ) by means of monte carlo simulations  @xcite .",
    "we find that attaching the side chain leads to a considerable anisotropic swelling of the flexible backbone and a straightening to a more brush - like configuration .",
    "this phenomenon not only depends on @xmath0 and @xmath1 , but also on the position @xmath2 at which the side chain is attached .",
    "in particular , we show that for fixed @xmath0 and @xmath2 the squared radius of gyration @xmath22 rises sigmoidally from the unperturbed value @xmath23 with increasing  @xmath1 and levels off to a constant for @xmath24 .",
    "in fact , the side - chain dependent swelling of the backbone follows a scaling relation with maximum value @xmath25 .",
    "contrary to an undisturbed end - grafted chain , the ratio @xmath26 increases with @xmath1 , thus highlighting the successive breaking of isotropy , that is also mirrored in dramatic changes of the ratios of the principle axes of gyration .",

    "to simulate a flexible end - grafted polymer chain of length @xmath0 ( i.e. having @xmath31 monomers ) , we utilize a simple cubic lattice with unity lattice spacing ( which we have taken as our unit of length ) .",

    "the polymer is considered in a good athermal solvent , i.e. no interactions between the monomers besides the self - avoidance are taken into account .",

    "due to its rigidity , the only possible moves of the side chain are rotations by @xmath36 and @xmath37 in the @xmath38- , @xmath39- , or @xmath40-plane respectively around the branching site  @xmath2",
