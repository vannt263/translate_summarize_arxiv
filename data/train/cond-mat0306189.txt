    "due to the rapid advances in experimental and theoretical atom optics , it has now become possible to cool atoms down to extremely low temperatures .",
    "an important characteristic of such ultracold atoms is their sensitivity to very weak external potentials . in the context of atomic bose - einstein condensation",
    ", this feature is particularly attractive .",
    "the condensate can be described , to a very good degree of approximation , in terms of a single macroscopic wave function which in this way can be subjected to intricate probing and manipulation .",
    "consequently , in recent years various ingenious techniques for handling bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) have been developed that exploit this sensitivity , e.g. , magnetic quadrupole and top traps , shallow optical dipole traps , phase - imprinting methods to create solitons or vortices , and radio - frequency ( rf ) output coupling , to name but a few prominent examples ( for a review of these and other techniques , see @xcite ) .",
    "however , the development of further tools and methods still presents a significant objective of current work , and forms the basis for advancing research in several main areas of bec physics .",
    "one such area concerns the experimental realization of low - dimensional bose - einstein condensates of trapped dilute atomic gases . under reduced dimensionality ,",
    "the condensate properties differ drastically from the well - studied three - dimensional case and have been under intense theoretical debate for some time @xcite .",
    "low - dimensional becs are characterized by the fact that due to strong confinement by the external trapping potential one or more motional degrees of freedom become quantum - mechanically frozen before the condensation point is reached .",
    "major obstacles , that had been confronting the preparation of one- or two - dimensional becs for a long time , concerned the construction of suitable traps  e.g .",
    ", very high field gradients would be required for magnetic traps  as well as the development of efficient loading procedures .",
    "only recently has it become possible to overcome these difficulties , and the first realizations of atomic becs in two dimensions have been reported @xcite . in these experiments ,",
    "the dimensionality is reduced by exposing the atoms to steep optical potentials . in ref .",
    "@xcite , single one- or two - dimensional becs are prepared , whereas in the experiments of refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite the use of optical lattices led to the creation of arrays of two - dimensional condensates .",
    "however , in addition to these works , various other interesting ideas regarding the manufacture of two - dimensional traps have been put forward over the last few years . in these proposals , trapping is provided either by optical @xcite or by magnetic @xcite means , whereas loading is accomplished through optical pumping .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is twofold .",
    "on the one hand we wish to promote field - induced adiabatic potentials as a new versatile tool to manipulate ultracold atoms and , in particular , bose - einstein condensates . on the other hand",
    ", we show that they offer a novel route to the creation of two - dimensional traps for becs .",
    "an initial outline of our results was given in ref .",
    "adiabatic potentials arise whenever two or more internal atomic states , that experience different potentials for the atomic center - of - mass motion , are coupled by a strong resonant external field .",
    "the atomic motion is then no longer dominated by the different ` bare ' potentials but is usefully described in terms of the adiabatic potentials , that arise from the diagonalization of the bare potentials and the couplings at each spatial point .",
    "adiabatic potentials have been in use for some time as the underlying mechanism for evaporative cooling .",
    "however , to our knowledge , little attention has been paid to the fact that they offer a lot of further possibilities to control quantum - mechanical atomic motion ( one fairly recent application is described in @xcite ) . in this paper",
    "we will give some examples of the application of adiabatic potentials as a tool for manipulating matter waves , and we hope to stimulate further research in this direction .",
    "after giving a qualitative introduction to adiabatic potentials in sec .",
    "ii , we continue in sec .",
    "iii to show how they can be employed to create so - called ` matter - wave bubbles ' from a bec initially trapped in the ground state of a harmonic potential . in the bubble state",
    "the wave function is localized around the surface of a sphere so that the matter density forms a spherical shell or bubble .",
    "we give a detailed account of the preparation of bubble states and their decay rates induced by nonadiabatic leakage .",
    "in particular , we address the question of how to compensate for gravitational effects in the laboratory which otherwise would impede the creation process .",
    "we expect matter - wave bubbles to have interesting applications some of which are investigated in sec .",
    "it is shown that they can be used as stepping - stones to prepare atoms in highly excited eigenstates of the bare harmonic trapping potential and to create new types of non - linear eigenstates of becs .",
    "furthermore , we examine collapse and revival effects which are found when the external coupling is switched off . by also switching off the trapping potential we can observe the free bubble expansion .    in sec .",
    "v we turn to the investigation of gravitational influences on the bubble preparation process . at first sight gravity",
    "is seen to be detrimental , but it is shown that it can be exploited to obtain a novel scheme for the creation of two - dimensional becs .",
    "gravity will cause the atoms in the shell potential to pool at the bottom of the trap so that the condensate forms a flat disk . in sec .",
    "v the initial transfer of a bec into such a disk state in the course of switching on the external field is examined numerically .",
    "in particular , we show that if the field parameters are changed appropriately the disk radius is steadily increased whereas its width keeps shrinking due to enhanced confinement .",
    "this suggests that the continuation of this process could ultimately yield a two - dimensional trap for the bec , although the numerical study of the approach to this limit is not currently feasible . in sec .",
    "vi we further pursue this idea by giving some general qualitative , and semi - quantitative , estimates and arguments about the conditions necessary to reach the 2d regime .",
    "they indicate the feasibility of our approach by showing that the requirements for the applied fields , preservation time of the condensate etc .",
    "are demanding but still within the reach of currently available technology .",
    "the paper ends with brief conclusions and outlook given in sec .",
    "the most important difference to the previous proposals of refs .",
    "@xcite for creating 2d traps is the fact that our method relies on adiabatically deforming a conventional magnetic trap and does not require incoherent processes , e.g. , optical pumping , for loading .",
    "this would allow for working with extremely cold , dense , and , possibly , coherent atomic ensembles throughout the whole process . in comparison to the experiments @xcite ,",
    "our scheme does not make use of optical potentials , but a combination of magnetic and rf fields .",
    "it thus avoids potential difficulties with spontaneous emission in very steep optical traps that require high laser intensities .",
    "in contrast to refs .",
    "@xcite , our proposal produces a single condensate with a large number of atoms , similar to the experiment of ref .",
    ". however , the trapping frequencies obtainable in the rf - scheme might be significantly higher trapping frequencies than the ones reported in the latter work .",
    "the basic principles of adiabatic potentials can be understood from examining a quantum - mechanical two - state particle that propagates in the vicinity of a linear potential crossing . in the interaction picture , with respect to the coupling field that gives rise to the crossing ,",
    "the schrdinger equation for this system is written as follows : @xmath0 we can transform this equation to a basis that diagonalizes the potentials @xmath1 and the coupling @xmath2 at each point , i.e. , to the basis of the spatially dependent ` dressed eigenstates . ' in this basis the schrdinger equation has the form @xcite @xmath3\\phi_+ + v_c(r,\\partial_r ) \\phi_-\\nonumber \\\\ i\\dot\\phi_-&=&\\left[-\\frac 1 2 \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial r^2}+v_-(r ) + v_{kin}(r ) \\right]\\phi_- - v_c(r,\\partial_r ) \\phi_+.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the potentials @xmath4 are the adiabatic potentials and are given by @xmath5 they arise from the pointwise diagonalization of the @xmath6-matrix formed by @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "the terms @xmath7 ^ 2}\\ ] ] and @xmath8 } \\left[\\frac{c^2r}{\\omega^2[1+(cr/\\omega)^2]}-\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r } \\right]\\ ] ] stem from the nonlocal character of the kinetic energy term .",
    "we see that @xmath9 is a binding potential . if the coupling term @xmath10 were not present , a wave packet prepared in the state ` @xmath11 ' would remain trapped forever in the potential @xmath9 . however , if @xmath2 is small the coupling @xmath12 is dominant . in this case",
    "any wave packet quickly leaves the crossing region around @xmath13 , and the description given by eq .",
    "( [ dres ] ) is not useful .",
    "nevertheless , if @xmath2 is increased , the kinetic coupling @xmath12 ( as well as @xmath14 ) rapidly becomes small is reduced for growing @xmath2 , the effective interaction range @xmath15 is increased .",
    "however , the size of the ground state of @xmath16 scales with @xmath17 , i.e. , it only experiences the diminished magnitude of @xmath12 . ] and the motion of the wave packet is more and more determined by the adiabatic potentials @xmath18 .",
    "in fact , it is shown in sec .",
    "iii.b that the lifetime of a wave packet prepared in the internal state ` @xmath11 ' , i.e. , the time it takes the wave packet to transfer to the state ` @xmath19 ' and leave the crossing region , increases exponentially with @xmath2 .    at first sight",
    ", it seems counterintuitive that it is possible to trap a particle , even with strong coupling , between two potentials in a region where the particle is not stable .",
    "we can draw an analogy with a particle moving in a magnetic quadrupole field .",
    "each of its bare zeeman substates ( with bare meaning having fixed spatial orientation ) individually would experience the field as unstable .",
    "however , if the particle moves slowly enough , couplings between the states are induced so that the particle s orientation with respect to the local direction of the total magnetic field is preserved . in this way , trapping can ensue for weak - field seeking states . in the case considered here , a slow particle tends to remain in the same dressed eigenstate and its motion is governed by the adiabatic potentials .",
    "to work out the basic ideas of our approach we first discuss its realization in the absence of gravity . as a result",
    ", we obtain a scheme to produce thin , highly stable matter - wave bubbles or shells in which the trapped atoms are localized around the surface of a sphere .    the starting point for our method",
    "is a coherent sample of atoms produced , e.g. , by bose - einstein condensation and trapped in the ground state of a harmonic magnetic potential .",
    "the preparation scheme then proceeds by applying a sequence of radio frequency fields that couple the initial internal atomic state , a weak - field seeking zeeman sublevel , to a second hyperfine ground state ( multi - level excitation schemes can be considered as well , see sec .",
    "one interesting aspect of the preparation process is that it may appear to be counterintuitive as the second state is an untrapped , high - field seeking state [ see inset , fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) ] . as this technique also forms the basis of evaporative cooling ,",
    "one may be led to expect that this procedure will inevitably cause a rapid depletion of the trapped atomic population . nevertheless , as was anticipated in sec .",
    "ii and is also shown below , if the fields are controlled in an appropriate way one may also obtain a very different effect .    to model the creation of our bubble states we study the coherent time evolution of a condensate initially prepared in a hyperfine state @xmath20 in the ground state of a spherically symmetric magnetic trap .",
    "when @xmath21 external fields are applied that induce a coupling of state @xmath20 to a zeeman sublevel @xmath22 whose magnetic moment is supposed to be equal in magnitude but opposite in sign .",
    "such a coupling may be realized , e.g. , as a transition between the hyperfine ground states @xmath23 and @xmath24 in @xmath25rb @xcite .",
    "the field - induced coupling strength is denoted as @xmath2 and is spatially independent to a good degree of approximation . in the following model",
    "we assume a radial @xmath26 form of the wave function components @xmath27 . then working in an interaction picture with respect to the applied fields , the time development is determined by the radial gross - pitaevskii equation @xmath28 in this equation time",
    "is scaled to the trap inverse oscillator frequency @xmath29 , length is scaled to the harmonic oscillator length scale @xmath30 , and @xmath31 and @xmath32 are scaled to @xmath33 .",
    "the effective detuning is defined by @xmath34/\\hbar\\omega$ ] , where @xmath35 is the energy difference between the two hyperfine states at the origin ( trap centre ) and @xmath36 the frequency of the applied field .",
    "the nonlinearity parameters are given by @xmath37 with @xmath38 the scattering lengths for intra- and inter - species collisions .",
    "the states are normalized according to @xmath39 .",
    "the total number of atoms is denoted @xmath40 .",
    "the strategy that we pursue in our engineering scheme is to control the condensate by slowly changing field - induced adiabatic ( or dressed ) potentials .",
    "these potentials , which are defined as the spatially dependent eigenvalues of the potentials and couplings in eqs .",
    "( [ gpe ] ) , are given by [ cf .",

    "[ fig1](a ) .",
    "the potential @xmath43 actually gives rise to the evaporative cooling effect in the usual arrangement . in that case one",
    "applies a field with an effective detuning which is large compared to the mean particle energy .",
    "the atoms then move in the potential @xmath43 , and the ones that reach its maximum , from the left , with sufficiently slow velocity , go over the top and get expelled from the trap .",
    "however , we will show that the atoms can also be prepared in the lowest - energy eigenstate ( or , more exactly , resonance ) @xmath44 of the potential @xmath16 .",
    "this quasi - bound or ` trapping ' state @xmath45 will realize the spherical shell state or matter - wave bubble ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) and ref .",
    "the state will be localized around the crossing of the two bare potentials at @xmath46 and have a width of @xmath47 , provided a harmonic expansion around the potential minimum is justified . the state is a genuine superposition of the internal states @xmath20 and @xmath22 .      before considering the bubble preparation process in detail one question immediately arises , i.e. , the stability of the system once it is prepared in the state @xmath45 .",
    "at first it is not obvious that atoms may remain trapped for a substantial time at the point of maximum effective coupling between states @xmath20 and @xmath22 . as we have discussed in sec",
    "ii , it becomes more plausible if one transforms eqs .",
    "( [ gpe ] ) to the dressed state basis , i.e. , the basis that diagonalizes the bare potentials and the coupling at each point @xmath48 . in this picture",
    "the two wave function components appear coupled by kinetic terms whose significance is rapidly diminished when @xmath2 is increased .",
    "if non - linear interactions can be neglected , the decay rate @xmath49 of the trapping state @xmath45 can be determined with the help of semi - classical methods developed in connection with molecular predissociation @xcite .",
    "as we show in the appendix , from these techniques it follows that @xmath50 , where the complex ground state energy @xmath51 is determined as a solution of @xmath52\\cos\\phi(e ) e^{-i[\\beta(e)-\\phi(e)]}+ \\cos\\beta(e)=0\\ ] ] with @xmath53 and the parameters @xmath54 and @xmath55 characterizing the scattering matrix of the linearized potential crossing problem .",

    "[ fig2 ] between the predictions of eqs .",
    "( [ eqe ] ) and ( [ appgamma ] ) and the direct numerical determination of decay rates from eqs .",
    "( [ gpe ] ) indicates the validity of these approximations . to obtain the numerical decay rates we first generated the bubble state at a required @xmath62 by performing the preparation process described in sec .",
    "we then monitored the decay of the norm of the wavefunction in the internal state ` @xmath11 ' as a function of time .",
    "after an initial transient , this decay was exponential to a very good degree of approximation .    equation ( [ appgamma ] ) yields two important insights : firstly , the decay is exponentially suppressed with growing @xmath2 . in the limit of @xmath63 , this exponential suppression",
    "may be approximated as @xmath64 secondly , for @xmath65 , with integer @xmath66 , the decay rates become very small . in these cases",
    "the state @xmath45 is in resonance with an eigenstate of the bare harmonic trapping potential .",
    "this stabilization effect may be used to obtain extremely long - lived states already for moderate coupling strengths .",
    "having established the existence of long - lived spherical bubble states in adiabatic potentials , we now turn to the details of their preparation .",
    "the first phase is to let the bare harmonic potential of state  1 evolve smoothly into the dressed potential @xmath16 and the second phase is to expand the bubble outwards .",
    "both phases are done so that the wave function is kept at all times in the instantaneous ground state @xmath67 . in the example of fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) ( in which non - linear effects have been neglected ) we achieve the first phase by increasing @xmath2 to the final ( scaled ) value of 9 at fixed _ negative _ detuning @xmath68 ( see fig .   [ fig1](b ) , inset )",
    ". then the second phase of bubble expansion is achieved by maintaining the intensity , but gradually ramping up the detuning . in this way",
    "less than 4% of the initial population was lost before reaching the final state shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) .",
    "the particular merit of this approach is that there is no need to follow a precisely prescribed path as the method relies on adiabatic following ( in a similar way to the wave packet guidance in aplip @xcite ) .",
    "any field sequence that guides the system sufficiently slowly through states of long lifetime is suitable .",
    "if we make our atomic bubbles from an initial bec , we should also study the effects of the non - linear interactions introduced in eq .",
    "( [ gpe ] ) .",
    "the dressed - state description is readily generalized if @xmath69 ( such a situation is realized , e.g. , in the na @xmath70 hyperfine multiplet @xcite ) . under these circumstances",
    "we can still define an adiabatic wave function @xmath71 that evolves , to a good degree of approximation , according to the gross - pitaevskii equation @xmath72\\phi_+.\\ ] ] in particular , for a sufficiently strong nonlinearity @xmath73 , the atomic density can be described by the thomas - fermi ansatz @xmath74/nu\\ ] ] with the chemical potential @xmath75 determined by the normalization condition .",
    "numerical studies show that shell , or bubble , states can then be manufactured in the same way as before .",
    "once prepared , their decay is now non - exponential , but the rate is of the same order of magnitude as the corresponding system in the linear case .",
    "if the atomic cross- and self - interactions differ significantly , numerical simulations indicate that the creation of bubble states becomes more difficult and their lifetime is reduced .",
    "so far , we have neglected the influence of gravity .",
    "its effect on the bubbles is expected to be detrimental as it will cause the atoms to pool at the bottom of the shell potential . in this subsection",
    ", we first give a simple estimate of how strong the gravitational influence must be to cause significant deviations from a homogeneous density distribution in the bubble state .",
    "we then propose a method to compensate for gravitation in the laboratory with the help of optical potentials .",
    "when the bubble width is small compared to the radius , the radial dependence of the adiabatic potential is approximately harmonic with a minimum at the bubble radius @xmath76 and an angular frequency @xmath77 @xcite .",
    "thus , we can approximate the hamiltonian for atoms in the trapping internal state ` @xmath11 ' as @xmath78 with the radial and polar coordinates @xmath79 , and the scaled gravitational acceleration @xmath80 ( with @xmath81ms@xmath82 ) .",
    "we now make the ansatz @xmath83}r f(\\cos\\theta)\\ ] ] for the ground state of this hamiltonian , where @xmath84 .",
    "this ansatz implies that , radially , the wave function is always in the ground state , i.e.  the influence of gravity is manifest only in the polar envelope @xmath85 . for present purposes it is sufficient to choose a very simple form for @xmath86 , e.g. , @xmath87 .",
    "the normalization factor in eq.([ansatz ] ) is then given by @xmath88 .",
    "furthermore , a variational calculation shows that @xmath89 and @xmath90 are related by @xmath91 with @xmath92 .",
    "a significant influence of gravity is certainly present when @xmath93 , i.e. , @xmath94 , as in this case the bubble has ` opened up . '",
    "this is realized for @xmath95 or , in unscaled coordinates , @xmath96 which is about @xmath97 m for rb87 . in the presence of gravity",
    ", bubbles can therefore only be observed in spherical traps with trapping frequencies large compared to 400hz .",
    "the estimate ( [ maxr0 ] ) can be interpreted as a balance condition between kinetic and gravitational energy which are of the order @xmath98 and @xmath99 , respectively .    the detrimental influence of gravity can , at least in principle , be compensated for by exposing the trapped atoms to an additional optical dipole potential . in a typical gaussian beam configuration this potential , which acts on all hyperfine sublevels in the same way , is given by @xcite @xmath100}\\right\\}\\ ] ] with @xmath101 .",
    "the rayleigh length @xmath102 and the beam waist radius @xmath103 are related by @xmath104 with @xmath105 the wavelength of the optical field . finally , in unscaled units , @xmath106 where @xmath107 denotes the resonance frequency , @xmath108 the spontaneous decay rate of the excited state , @xmath109 the detuning between laser and the atomic transition and @xmath110 the applied laser power .",
    "the idea is now to adjust the trap depth @xmath111 such that at the turning point @xmath112 of the optical potential along the line @xmath113 , which is defined by @xmath114 , the slope @xmath115 . in this way ,",
    "the combined optical and gravitational potential is almost constant around @xmath112 , the lowest - order corrections being cubic in @xmath116 ( see fig .  [ figopt ] ) .",
    "the magnetic trap has then to be placed inside this area . from eq .",
    "( [ optpot ] ) it follows that , as @xmath117 , we have to choose @xmath118 to fulfill the above condition .",
    "if the condensate is in the thomas - fermi regime , the @xmath119 extension of the volume within which a bubble could be created is somewhat less than @xmath120 with @xmath75 the bec chemical potential [ for which an estimate is given in eq .",
    "( [ chempot ] ) ] .",
    "this follows from stipulating that the variation of the combined optical and gravitational potential over this volume should be less than @xmath75 .",
    "we have performed numerical simulations to demonstrate that this approach actually offers the possibility to overcome the influence of gravity . to this end , we have studied the preparation process using a two - dimensional version of eq .",
    "( [ gpe2 ] ) including the optical potential .",
    "equation ( [ gpe2 ] ) describes time evolution in the effective adiabatic potential of the rb87 @xmath121 multiplet . as an example we have shown that in an anisotropic trap with @xmath122hz , @xmath123hz , bubble states for a bec corresponding to an atom number of 10@xmath124 in three dimensions can be produced at @xmath125khz , @xmath126khz , @xmath127khz , and @xmath128 m . for the preparation , @xmath2 is switched on within @xmath129ms at @xmath130khz , and then @xmath109 is increased to its final value within @xmath131ms . the bubble has radial and axial diameters of 15@xmath75 m and 110@xmath75 m , respectively .",
    "the necessary laser power is estimated at around 1w .",
    "the large axial extension shows that in this direction the variation of the combined optical and gravitational potential is almost negligible . to find an optimized shape for given @xmath2 and @xmath109 , it is advisable to experiment by slightly varying the laser power and the position of the magnetic trap center",
    ". nevertheless , the preparation scheme is robust in the sense that ( for the configuration described above ) one still obtains a bubble if the location of the magnetic trap ( in @xmath119 ) relative to the dipole potential is changed by about @xmath13210% , and the laser intensity by about @xmath1322.5% .",
    "however , _ during _ preparation these parameters have to be stabilized very well ( to within a fraction of the indicated range ) to avoid excitation of the bubble .",
    "at this point it should be mentioned that  at least in the absence of non - linear interactions  the preparation of bubbles is impeded by another problem besides gravity , namely , the unavoidable trap anisotropies .",
    "imagine that in the bare magnetic trap @xmath133 , but we keep @xmath134",
    ". then the effective trapping frequency along the @xmath135 axis is given by @xmath136 ( scaling now with respect to @xmath137 ) .",
    "we can model our system hamiltonian as @xmath138 where @xmath139 appropriately interpolates between @xmath140 and @xmath136 .",
    "the ground state is approximated as @xmath141}r \\bar f(\\cos\\theta)\\ ] ] with @xmath142 .",
    "we again could determine @xmath143 by minimizing the energy functional .",
    "however , following the discussion of the previous paragraph we can argue that variations in the angular kinetic energy carry a cost of the order of @xmath144 whereas the difference in ` polar potential energy ' is given by @xmath145 .",
    "therefore , we expect trap anisotropies to have a significant influence as soon as @xmath146 as typically @xmath147 and @xmath148 , the trap frequencies have to be adjusted very carefully in order to enable the generation of bubbles . in the case of fig .  2 , for example , the estimate ( [ frequencies ] ) indicates that @xmath149 should be of the order of 0.1% .",
    "fortunately , the problem can be alleviated to some extent by making use of the atomic interactions . in the thomas - fermi limit",
    ", the chemical potential of a thin bubble is estimated to be @xmath150 with @xmath151 as the scaled nonlinearity coefficient and where @xmath40 is the number of atoms in the bubble .",
    "thereby , @xmath75 is measured with respect to the bottom of @xmath152 .",
    "we expect that only if the non - linear interaction energy  which is of the order of @xmath75is in sufficient excess of the effective potential energy , i.e. , if @xmath153 then a bubble of approximately constant density can be formed . thus , even if gravity is compensated for , bubbles can probably only be produced in the presence of strong non - linear interactions . on the other hand ,",
    "the numerical simulations of the previous subsection have shown that under such conditions a preparation may indeed be possible .",
    "as a first application of matter - wave bubbles we now discuss the preparation of excited harmonic oscillator states in the absence of non - linear interactions ( i.e. , for sufficiently dilute samples ) .",
    "if , after creating a bubble state , the coupling strength is slowly _ reduced at fixed _ @xmath109 the system will again evolve through a sequence of instantaneous eigenstates .",
    "this time , however , the eigenstate will not significantly change its energy relative to the minimum of the bare trapping potential . qualitatively speaking",
    ", the wave function gradually moves out from the crossing region where it is being trapped and begins to experience more strongly the presence of the bare harmonic potential .",
    "this process is accompanied by a loss of atoms which end up on the repulsive potential after leaving the crossing region . at @xmath154",
    "the remaining bound wave function will have reached an excited harmonic oscillator eigenstate which , in the spherical harmonic case , is characterized by having @xmath26 . as mentioned before ,",
    "the energy of this eigenstate is approximately equal to the energy of the initial bubble state . to give an example ,",
    "if we start from the state shown in fig.[fig1](b ) , and the coupling strength is ramped down within a time interval of @xmath155 , we arrive at an eigenstate of energy 35.5 with respect to the minimum of the harmonic potential @xcite .",
    "a sequence of intermediate states appearing in the course of this process is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] . after completion ,",
    "the admixture of other eigenstates is less than 2% , and the population is 36% of the initial population in the harmonic trap ground state .",
    "a few remarks should be made about this preparation scheme : ( i ) it has to be performed ` quasi - adiabatically ' , i.e. , slow enough to avoid substantial excitation of other eigenstates , but sufficiently fast to reduce losses as much as possible .",
    "( ii ) although the system effectively ends up with the same hamiltonian as in the very beginning ( coupling switched off ) and the time evolution is performed quasi - adiabatically , the final state is very different from the initial one .",
    "this is because the hamiltonian depends on two external parameters @xmath2 and @xmath109 , and @xmath154 represents a singularity in the sense that the value of @xmath109 becomes irrelevant .",
    "( iii ) the oscillator eigenstates can in turn be used as intermediate states to produce radially excited bubble states .",

    "we need to replace @xmath238 by @xmath305 to obtain the correct condition for resonance .",
    "the trap potential ( [ 2state : vtr ] ) becomes that for the @xmath167 state , and the coupling @xmath252 is replaced by @xmath306 . then an rf field with a final coupling @xmath307 khz and [ from ( [ cond : lifetime ] ) ] @xmath308 mhz is one that can be provided with currently available technology @xcite .",
    "the condition  ( [ eq : omega_final ] ) is easily satisfied since it results in @xmath309 hz .",
    "the resulting trap frequencies are @xmath310 khz , @xmath311 hz , @xmath312 hz . the new trap is vertically shifted by 0.34 mm from the center of the original magnetic potential . the critical temperature is given by 0.43@xmath75k , so that up to 3.6@xmath313 atoms could be condensed .",
    "the transverse width of the condensate is estimated at 0.08@xmath75 m if atomic interactions can be neglected .",
    "the time required for the preparation process should be large compared to @xmath314 , eq .",

    "in view of these estimates , the experimental realization of this new kind of 2d trap seems to be within reach of current experiments .",
    "in this paper we have shown that field - induced adiabatic potentials can provide a robust and versatile tool to create novel trapping configurations for ultracold atoms . as specific examples ,",
    "we have considered the generation of matter - wave shell , or bubble , states and the preparation of two - dimensional atom traps . in a bubble state",
    ", the matter - wave density is localized around the surface of a three - dimensional sphere .",
    "we have discussed the preparation process which proceeds by coupling a harmonic magnetic trap to a repulsive harmonic potential by a suitably chosen time - dependent rf field . although this configuration appears to be unstable at first sight , the bubbles are stabilized in the resulting dressed potential and their lifetime increases exponentially with the rf coupling strength .",
    "the bubbles can be used as stepping - stones for the creation of highly - excited oscillator eigenstates and ` non - linear eigenmodes . '",
    "we also investigated possible experiments showing collapse and revival effects .",
    "although the creation of the bubbles is impeded by the influence of gravity and trap anisotropies , we have pointed out ways to overcome these difficulties with the help of present - day technology .",
    "the same principle , which has been used for making bubble states , can also be applied to the creation of two - dimensional atom traps . under the combined influence of the dressing",
    "rf field and gravity , a condensate pools at the bottom of the resulting potential . by increasing the rf detuning",
    "the radial confinement becomes steeper , and the condensate gets increasingly squeezed until it eventually reaches a ` quasi - two - dimensional ' state .",
    "we have given estimates for the parameters necessary to reach this regime .",
    "we hope that the results presented in this article stimulate further research into the possibilities that field - induced adiabatic potentials offer for the creation of new kinds of trapping potentials and lower - dimensional geometries .",
    "we have focussed in this paper on shell - like and disc - shaped traps , but by working with atomic waveguides we also expect that new tubular potentials could be formed .",
    "these new kinds of potentials can all be used to create new quantum - mechanical states of matter , and might also be used in the study of weakly bound clusters or nano - particles .        in this appendix",

    "if we set , e.g. , @xmath326 equal to unity then the other coefficients @xmath327 can be regarded as scattering amplitudes for the interaction process inside the curve crossing region .",
    "resonance states are related to poles of the scattering amplitudes in the complex energy plane .",
    "the determination of the amplitudes proceeds in two steps .",
    "( i ) by taylor - expanding the harmonic potentials to first order around the crossing at @xmath328 , the interaction between the states 1 and 2 is described as a linear curve - crossing problem . using the corresponding scattering matrix the amplitudes @xmath329 and @xmath330",
