    "the optical properties of low - dimensional semiconductors are strongly influenced by coulomb interactions . in the case of intrinsic quantum wells ( qws ) , the optically created electron - hole pair forms a bound state , the exciton , which dominates the optical transitions @xcite . in the presence of an electron gas , in modulated - doped samples ,",
    "the exciton is quenched and the optical properties are dominated by band - to - band transitions .",
    "coulomb correlations may eventually manifest themselves in the optical response of the system .",
    "this many - body effect is characterized by an enhancement of the spectrum intensity known as the fermi edge singularity @xcite .",
    "the situation is quite different in the case of low - carrier densities . in this regime ,",
    "the electron - hole pair may still hold a bound state .",
    "the exciton interacts with the electron gas ( in the case of n - doped samples ) eventually binding an extra electron forming a bound complex , the negative trion ( x@xmath1 ) .",
    "this state is the ground state of the system while the exciton ( x@xmath2 ) is an excited state . in this picture , the second electron is only weakly bound since its binding energy originates from the interaction between the electron and a neutral exciton through its dipole . as a consequence ,",
    "the spectrum lines associated with the x@xmath1 and the x@xmath2 are separated by an energy of the order of few @xmath3 .",
    "this makes the observation of the @xmath4 a difficult task only recently achieved in high - quality samples .",
    "since its first observation @xcite , the trion has been intensively studied , both experimentally @xcite and theoretically @xcite .",
    "one of the aspects that has not been considered yet is the influence of the excess of electrons in the trion properties .",
    "here we address this issue by calculating the negative trion binding energy in the presence of an excess of electrons in semiconductor qws .",
    "our results show that while the screening of the coulomb interaction decreases the binding energy , the phase - space filling effects originated from the pauli exclusion principle rapidly ionize the trion complex .",
    "we consider the stability of the ground state of two electrons and one hole complex in a semiconductor qw in the presence of a degenerate population of electrons in the lowest qw conduction subband .",
    "the trion states can be labeled by their total spin , @xmath5 , total angular momentum , @xmath6 , and total wave - vector , @xmath7 . in the absence of external fields ,",
    "only the @xmath8 singlet ( @xmath9 ) is a bound state .",
    "we calculate the @xmath10 bound state variationally by expanding the trion wave - function in a symmetrized two - relative particles plane - wave basis for the in - plane coordinates . along the growth direction ( z - direction ) , the component of the wave - function is taken as being the qw conduction and valence ground states .",
    "the pauli exclusion principle is taken into account by limiting the relative particle plane - waves to @xmath11 values above the fermi wave - vector , @xmath12 .",
    "the orbital part of the singlet wave - function @xmath13 , for the ground state is written as :    @xmath14    where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the conduction and valence qw ground states , the @xmath17 s are numerical parameters chosen within physically meaningful values and a@xmath18 s are the linear variational parameters .",
    "the @xmath19 are chosen so that for @xmath20 the wave - function is a symmetrized expansion in non - orthogonal two single - relative - particle gaussian functions parameterized by @xmath17 is limited to the s - like relative states @xcite .",
    "this is enough to obtain a good description of the trion binding energy . for a better quantitative result",
    "it is necessary , however , to include higher relative angular momenta .",
    "the screening of the coulomb interaction is considered within the random - phase approximation ( rpa ) @xcite . within this approximation ,",
    "the coulomb interaction is in - plane fourier transformed and the q - dependent coulomb interaction is screened by the rpa static - dielectric constant , @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the three - dimensional bohr radius , @xmath23 is the usual qw form factor and @xmath24 , where y(x ) is the step function ( @xmath25 if @xmath26 and @xmath27 if @xmath28 ) .",
    "the trion ground - state is calculated by diagonalizing the generalized eigenvalue problem obtained by projecting the total two - electrons and one - hole hamiltonian into the wave - function of eq . 1 .",
    "to obtain the conditions for the stability of the trion we calculate the exciton plus a non - interacting electron ground state within the same approximation .",
    "we considered a single 100   symmetrically n - modulated - doped gaas-(ga , al)as qw .",
    "figure 1 shows ( a ) the exciton energy and ( b ) the trion energy relative to the non - interacting particles total energy as a function of the electron density when only the screening is considered ( dotted - line ) , when only the pauli exclusion principle effect is considered ( dashed - line ) and when both effects are included ( full line ) .",
    "here we subtracted the kinetic energy of the relative particle with @xmath12 wave - vector for the exciton and twice this value for the trion .",
    "this garanties that the exciton and the trion states are not degenerate with available scattering states and is a true bound state .",
    "we observe that the screening decreases the binding energy already at very weak electron concentrations ( n@xmath29 ) .",
    "however , even for large concentrations , it remains a sizable although weak binding energy @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the pauli exclusion principle is almost ineffective up to n@xmath29 of the order of @xmath30 @xmath31 . for higher concentrations ,",
    "the binding energy is rapidly quenched @xcite at n@xmath29=@xmath32 @xmath31 .",
    "the combined effects show an exciton binding energy which decreases with n@xmath29 and is quenched for a concentration of @xmath33 @xmath31 .",
    "the same behavior is observed for the trion energy , where it was extracted twice the relative fermi energy , following the same arguments as in the exciton case .",
    "the stability of the @xmath4 complex , however , must be established by comparing its total energy with the next two - electrons one - hole state , that is , when the one electron and the hole form the bound excitonic state and the extra electron is at the lowest available scattered state , that is , at the fermi energy .",
    "the trion binding energy is defined as the difference between this two energies : @xmath34 . in figure 2",
    "we plot this value as a function n@xmath29 .",
    "when we consider only the screening effects , the trion binding energy remains roughly the same up to values of n@xmath29 of the order of @xmath35 @xmath31 , when it increases almost linearly with it .",
    "the decrease in the binding energy due to the screening is compensated by the energy of the extra electron up to concentrations of the order of @xmath35 @xmath31 , giving an almost constante trion binding energy .",
    "once the screening effects is saturated , the energy increases with the fermi energy almost linearly .",
    "the situation changes completly when we consider the pauli exclusion principle . in this case , the trion binding energy quenches already at values of n@xmath29 of the order of @xmath36 @xmath37 .",
    "when we considere both , the screening and the pauli exclusion principle , the trion ionizes at concentrations of the order of @xmath38 @xmath31 . in actual samples ,",
    "the nominal excess of electrons is above this value .",
    "however , the trion and the exciton emission lines remains stable and no quenching of the photoluminescence is observed .",
    "a more complex trion wave function gives higher values for the trion binding energy and one should expect the quenching to happen at higher concentrations .",
    "this will not , however , change the qualitative picture .",
    "one of the reasons to understand the trion stability is the effect of interface fluctuations .",
    "it may trap the trion , increasing the energy necessary to ionize it@xcite or , it may trap the electrons making them less effective in the quenching of the bound state .",
    "more experimental and theoretical work is necessary to elucidate this problem .",
