    "quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) not only describes how quarks and antiquarks interact , but also predicts that the gluons , which are the quanta of the field , will themselves interact to form mesons . if the object formed is composed entirely of valence gluons the meson is called a glueball , however if it is composed of a mixture of valence quarks , antiquarks and gluons ( i.e. @xmath6 ) it is called a hybrid .",

    "it was hoped that these extra states would have unusual branching ratios and/or be preferentially produced in gluon rich processes such as double pomeron exchange ( dpe ) , where the pomeron trajectory is thought to be mediated by the exchange of a virtual multi - gluon state .",
    "the cern fixed target experiments wa76 , wa91 and wa102 , which were performed at the omega spectrometer were designed to study exclusive final states formed in the reaction    @xmath15 @xmath16p@xmath17p@xmath18 ,    where the subscripts @xmath19 and @xmath20 refer to the fastest and slowest particles , identified as protons , in the laboratory frame respectively and @xmath21 represents the central system .",

    "a comparison of the production cross - section for all the resonances observed in the wa102 experiment at @xmath39  =  29.1  gev @xcite shows that @xmath40 states are produced much more weakly than @xmath41 states ( i.e. those containing u and d quarks ) .",

    "part of this suppression could be due to the fact that there is a kinematic suppression of @xmath43 and some could be explained by the fact that the centre of mass energy dependence of the @xmath37 allows for up to a 30  % contribution from non - dpe processes .",
    "however , a suppression of @xmath44 still needs to be explained .",

    "initially frustrated the hope that such experiments would prove to be a clean glueball source .",
    "however , during the experiments an additional kinematic variable was found , which was initially exposed due to a change in the trigger conditions that were implemented moving from wa76 to wa91 . in the wa76 experiment in order to remove the much more frequently occurring @xmath15 elastic scattering events the trigger required that the two outgoing protons were on the same side relative to the incident beam ( classified as ll ) and shown pictorially in fig .",

    "the sfm collaboration at the isr had also observed that the directions taken by the outgoing fastest and slowest particles were correlated with the production of the @xmath37 @xcite , however , in that case they concluded that the observation may suggest that the @xmath37 may have a large glue content . in the case of wa91 , since the @xmath49 and @xmath37 have a similar dependence the conclusion drawn was that the configuration of the outgoing protons may provide a way of distinguishing between @xmath4 and non-@xmath4 states .",
    "in fact , the wa91 collaboration @xcite showed that there were a wide variety of resonances that favoured production when the angle between the outgoing slow and fast protons was near to 0 degrees compared to when the angle was near to 180 degrees .",
    "in order to try to explain this effect in terms of a physical model , close and kirk  @xcite proposed that the data be analysed in terms of the parameter @xmath50 , which is the difference in transverse momentum between the particles exchanged from the fast and slow vertices .",

    "therefore there appeared to be three new scalar states around 1.5 gev , each observed in different experiments .",
    "however under closer examination it became apparent that all three states were in fact the same and it was only the analysis techniques that made them appear different .",
    "the difference in mass between the states observed by the crystal barrel collaboration and the gams collaboration could be reconciled if they both used the same breit - wigner parameterisation . to reconcile the data from wa91 required invoking the idea that there could be an interference between coherently produced states .",
