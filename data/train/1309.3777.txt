    "the low energy limit of string theory provides a definite form of dilaton gravity action @xcite with a specific dilaton coupling and additional 2-form fields @xcite .",
    "thus , it may be worth examining the exact cosmological solutions of the 4-dimensional low energy string gravity in the framework of dilaton gravity , instead of general relativity .",
    "there have been many studies on the cosmological evolution of the low energy string gravity with 2-form fields @xcite . in the early cosmological evolution , it is necessary to consider the effect of matter as well as the 2-form fields in the low energy string gravity . without matter , it would be convenient to choose the einstein frame redefining the metric as usual",
    ". however , in the presence of matter , the frame changes of metric make the dilaton field couple with matter fields differently depending on their spins .",
    "thus , the matter energy - momentum tensors would be non - trivial functions of the dilaton field in a different frame .",
    "therefore , we have considered a fluid - like matter distribution in the fundamental string frame @xcite , in which the gravitational constant determined by the dilaton field evolves in time . because the relativistic matter should be dominant over the non - relativistic matter in the early evolution of the universe , we have examined the exact cosmological solutions with the 2-form fields and/or the radiation - like fluid in the string frame .",
    "the vanishing beta functions originated from the world sheet conformal symmetry in the closed string sector of string theory give the well - known low energy string gravity action in the critical @xmath0-dimension @xcite . assuming a ricci - flat compactification of the internal @xmath1-dimensional space decoupled from our @xmath2-dimensional spacetime @xcite , and adding the matter lagrangian @xmath3 which is decoupled from the dilaton field in the string frame",
    ", we have the following form of action in 4-dimensional spacetime from the low energy limit of string theory @xcite , @xmath4 + \\int d^{4}x\\sqrt{-g } { \\cal l}_{m } , \\label{action}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have redefined the dilaton field @xmath5 with @xmath6 as @xmath7 in the string frame , and @xmath8 are the field strengths of the 2-form antisymmetric fields @xmath9 in ns - ns sector as @xmath10 .    the equations of motion for the 2-form fields @xmath9 , the dilaton field @xmath6 , and the metric @xmath11 are obtained as @xmath12 @xmath13 @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the matter energy - momentum tensor . taking the trace part of equation ( [ g - eq ] ) , we have an expression for @xmath16 . plugging it into the dilaton equation ( [ d - eq ] ) , we can rewrite the dilaton equation of motion equivalently as @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the trace of the matter energy - momentum tensor .    as we can see from eq.([s - eq ] ) , the driving force of the dilaton field is given by the antisymmetric 2-form field strengths and the trace of matter energy momentum tensor .    @xmath8 solution of eq.([h - eq ] ) is found as @xmath19 where @xmath20 is a new smooth scalar field , @xmath21 is the covariant constant antisymmetric tensor such that @xmath22 , with @xmath23 .",
    "the bianchi identity @xmath24 for the antisymmetric field strengths @xmath8 gives the equation of motion for the scalar field @xmath20 as @xcite @xmath25    defining the dual strength vector @xmath26 as @xmath27 , we find that @xmath28    we examine the cosmological evolution of the eqs.([h - eq],[d - eq],[g - eq ] ) with the spatially flat robertson - walker metric @xmath29 and the cosmological ansatz : @xmath30 , @xmath31 .",
    "then , eq.([psi - eq ] ) gives @xmath32 where @xmath33 is a constant which measures the strength of the 2-form fields .",
    "the solution eq.([h - sol2 ] ) gives a uniform non - vanishing dual strength vector such as @xmath34    using the metric ( [ rw ] ) and the explicit solution of @xmath35 from eqs.([h2-sol],[b - sol ] ) , eqs.([g - eq],[s - eq ] ) are reduced to a set of cosmological equations . denoting the time derivative as an over - dot ,",
    "the cosmological equations with uniform matters in the string frame are given as @xmath36 @xmath37 @xmath38 where the hubble parameter is @xmath39 , and the cosmic acceleration parameter is @xmath40 . with the uniform matter density @xmath41 and the uniform matter pressure @xmath42 , the energy momentum tensors are @xmath43 , and @xmath44 .    in eqs.([cosg00-eq],[cosg11-eq ] ) , it seems that the 2-form fields play a role of matter with the energy density @xmath45 and the pressure @xmath45 having the equation of state @xmath46 .",
    "however , the @xmath47 term in the action ( [ action ] ) gives an additional contribution , the conformal density @xmath48 defined as @xmath49 , to the right hand side of eq.([cosd - eq ] ) .    by taking a time derivative eq.([cosg00-eq ] ) and using eqs.([cosg11-eq],[cosd - eq ] )",
    ", it is found that the matter energy conservation holds as @xmath50 which is independent of the 2-from fields @xmath9 and the dilaton field @xmath6 in the string frame . with the equation of state for matter @xmath51 , eq.([matter - eq ] )",
    "gives the matter density evolving as @xmath52 where @xmath53 is a positive constant which measures the strength of the matter density .",
    "the 2-form fields having @xmath54 behavior in eqs.([cosg00-eq],[cosg11-eq],[cosd - eq ] ) dominate the universe with a small scale factor @xmath55 .",
    "as the universe expands , the rapidly decreasing 2-form fields lay down their role in the late time evolution of the universe , and matter with the density ( [ matter - sol ] ) or a cosmological constant will take over the dominance .",
    "first , let us begin with the vacuum solution of eqs.([cosg00-eq],[cosg11-eq],[cosd - eq ] ) , without the 2-form fields and matter .",
    "the equation ( [ cosd - eq ] ) can be written as @xmath56 with a new time function @xmath57 such that @xmath58 , this equation becomes a simple equation having a general linear solution in @xmath59 , @xmath60 where @xmath61 and @xmath62 are two positive integration constants which should be determined by an initial condition .",
    "if @xmath63 , then we have the trivial vacuum solution such that @xmath64 is a constant , and the scale factor @xmath65 is also a constant with @xmath66 . if @xmath67 , then we have @xmath68    the new time function @xmath59 is a monotonically increasing function of time @xmath69 . as the time",
    "@xmath69 elapses , @xmath59 increases rapidly for a small scale factor , but very slowly for a large scale factor @xmath65 .",
    "thus , the gravitational constant , which is the inverse of @xmath70 , decreases as @xmath71 in vacuum .    from eq.([cosg00-eq ] ) , we obtain @xmath72 and its integration as @xmath73 where @xmath74 is a positive integration constant .    thus , using @xmath75 , we obtain the cosmological time @xmath69 as a function of @xmath59 as @xmath76 where @xmath77 is a constant time .",
    "thus , we find the exact vacuum solutions without matter and the 2-form fields as @xmath78 where @xmath79 and @xmath80",
    ".    therefore , the both vacuum solutions with @xmath67 give an ever shrinking universe to @xmath81 in the future . especially , the solution with the lower signs meets a curvature singularity at a finite time @xmath82 .",
    "let us consider the solution of eqs.([cosg00-eq],[cosg11-eq],[cosd - eq ] ) with the 2-form fields only .",
    "the equation ( [ cosd - eq ] ) can be written as @xmath83 with a new time function @xmath57 such that @xmath58 , this equation becomes the simple harmonic equation in @xmath59 , @xmath84 where @xmath85 is an integration constant , and @xmath86 .",
    "we find that @xmath59 should be in a compact domain , @xmath87 .    from eq.([cosg00-eq ] ) , we have the solution of @xmath88 as follows , @xmath89 using the solution ( [ ab - phi - sol ] ) of @xmath6 , from eq.([htau - sol ] ) , we find the velocity of the cosmic scale factor as follows @xmath90 we can integrate eq.([ab - vel - eq ] ) to have the scale factor @xmath65 as a function of @xmath59 @xmath91 for the upper and the lower signs of eq.([htau - sol ] ) respectively",
    ".    the cosmological time @xmath92 for each solution is given by the integration over @xmath93 , @xmath94 the infinite future of the cosmological time @xmath69 corresponds to @xmath95 .",
    "the cosmological time @xmath96 and the scale factor @xmath97 in the einstein frame are obtained as latexmath:[\\[\\begin{aligned } t_{e}(\\tau)= \\int_{0}^{\\tau } \\phi(\\tau ) s_{\\pm}^{3}(\\tau ) d\\tau ,",
    "\\quad s_{e}(\\tau)= \\phi(\\tau ) s_{\\pm}(\\tau ) =    because the time derivative of @xmath97 about @xmath96 is given as @xmath99 it is found that the upper / lower sign solution corresponds to an ever expanding / shrinking solution , respectively , in the einstein frame .",
    "the second derivative of @xmath97 about @xmath96 is the same for the both solutions , and always negative as @xmath100 thus , both solutions decelerate always in the einstein frame .",
    "the exact solutions in 4-spacetime dimension seem to be consistent with the phase - plane analysis @xcite , and with the analytic fourier mode solutions @xcite .",
    "next , let us examine the cosmological solution of eqs.([cosg00-eq],[cosg11-eq],[cosd - eq ] ) with the radiation - like fluid in the string frame . because the uniform relativistic matter has the equation of state @xmath101 with @xmath102 , the trace of the matter energy momentum tensors vanishes",
    "thus , without the 2-form fields @xmath103 , the dilaton equation ( [ cosd - eq ] ) gives the same solution ( [ phi - vac - sol ] ) as in the vacuum .",
    "if @xmath63 , then we have the well - known decelerating expansion solution with a constant dilaton field @xmath64 as in general relativity .",
    "thus , let us consider the @xmath67 case , @xmath104 . using a relativistic matter density @xmath41 and a pressure density @xmath42 such that @xmath105 from eq.([matter - sol ] ) , and with the dilaton solution ( [ phi - vac - sol],[phidot - vac - sol ] ) ,",
    "we obtain the following equation for the scale factor @xmath65 from eq.([cosg00-eq ] ) , @xmath106 introducing another time function @xmath107 which is also an increasing function of the time @xmath69 , we can rewrite this equation as follows , @xmath108 integrating this , we have the solution for the time parameters @xmath107 as @xmath109 where @xmath110 is an integration constant .",
    "thus , the range for the time @xmath107 is determine as @xmath111 from eq.([t - sol ] ) , we have a relation between the two time parameters @xmath107 and @xmath59 as @xmath112 integrating this equation , the solution for the upper signs is obtained as @xmath113 where @xmath114 is a positive integration constant , and the integration constant @xmath110 may be chosen as @xmath115 such that @xmath116 .",
    "the scale factor @xmath117 for the upper signs is a downward concave function in time , having a minimum as shown in fig.1 .     versus @xmath118 with @xmath119 in eq.([a0-s - sol]),width=259 ]",
    "the cosmological time @xmath69 is related to the time parameter @xmath107 as follows @xmath120 integrating this equation , it is found that the cosmological time @xmath69 is a monotonically increasing function of the time parameter @xmath107 with @xmath121 at @xmath122 as shown in fig.2 .     versus @xmath118 from eq.([time - eq]),width=259 ]    for the upper sign bounce solution ( [ a0-s - sol ] ) , as the time @xmath107 approaches to @xmath123 , the dilaton field vanishes and the scale factor grows infinitely .",
    "therefore , the gravitational constant grows infinitely as the cosmological time approaches to the initial cosmological time @xmath121 .",
    "we can examine the cosmological evolution with the help of eq.([cosg11-eq ] ) also .",
    "using the solution ( [ phi - vac - sol ] ) of @xmath6 and eq.([a0-vel - eq ] ) , we find the acceleration of the scale factor from eq.([cosg11-eq ] ) as @xmath124    for the lower signs in eqs.([a0-vel - eq],[a0-acc - eq ] ) , the velocity and the acceleration of the scale factor are both negative always , giving an ever shrinking universe to meet the singularity with the scale factor @xmath81 in the future .",
    "however taking the upper signs gives the interesting bounce solution as we have obtained in eq.([a0-s - sol ] ) . from eqs.([a0-vel - eq],[a0-acc - eq ] ) , the velocity and the acceleration of the scale factor in the time @xmath69 show the following behavior , @xmath125 thus , the scale factor should have a downward concave form in time as seen in fig.1 , having a minimum size at @xmath126 .",
    "if a universe started its evolution at a finite size with @xmath127 , it would shrink with a positive acceleration to the minimum size at @xmath128 , which is the turning point .",
    "then , the universe begins an accelerating expansion again until @xmath129 , and continues a decelerating expansion afterward . if we choose @xmath130 , @xmath131 as the value satisfying the equation @xmath132 .",
    "then , the dilaton field @xmath70 increases from the value @xmath133 at the minimum size @xmath130 , and approaches to a constant value @xmath134 finally in the expanding universe . at the minimum size @xmath130",
    ", the matter density has the maximum value @xmath135 as @xmath136    unlike other examples of bouncing scenarios in string cosmology @xcite , the bouncing solution found with the radiation - like fluid decoupled from the dilaton field in the string frame does not satisfy the property of duality symmetry which is typical of string cosmology @xcite .",
    "finally , we consider the solutions of eqs.([cosg00-eq],[cosg11-eq],[cosd - eq ] ) with both the radiation - like fluid and the 2-form fields .    the equation ( [ cosd - eq ] ) with the 2-form fields and the radiation - like fluid gives the same solution ( [ ab - phi - sol ] ) of the case with the 2-form fields only . from eq.([cosg00-eq ] ) , we have the solution of @xmath88 as follows , @xmath137 using the solution ( [ ab - phi - sol ] ) of @xmath6 , from eq.([htau - sol ] ) we find the velocity of the cosmic scale factor as follows @xmath138 similarly as in eq.([a0-vel - eq1 ] ) , introducing a new time function @xmath139 , we can rewrite this equation as @xmath140 integrating this , we have the solution for the upper signs as @xmath141 where @xmath114 is a positive integration constant , and the integration constant @xmath110 may be also chosen as @xmath115 such that @xmath142 .",
    "this scale factor @xmath143 for the upper signs is a downward concave function in time , having a minimum size at @xmath144 , like the previous upper sign solution for the relativistic matter only case .",
    "thus , it is found that adding the 2-form fields does not change the qualitative behaviour of the exact solutions ( [ a0-s - sol ] ) for the radiation - like fluid only .",
    "we have discussed a particular class of exact cosmological solutions of the 4-dimensional low energy string gravity with the 2-form fields and/or the uniform relativistic matter in the string frame ( see @xcite for the general exact solutions with arbitrary equation of state of the fluid sources ) . in the vacuum without matter and the 2-form fields , the exact cosmological solutions always give monotonically shrinking universes if the dilaton field is not a constant .",
    "however , in the presence of a radiation - like fluid and/or the 2-form fields , the exact solutions exhibit a minimum size of the universe in the string frame . throughout the evolution",
    ", the exact solutions do not show any singularity , except the initial cosmological curvature singularity in the string frame .    as further studies , in the early stage of cosmological evolution",
    ", it may be necessary to consider the effects of the cosmological constant or a dilaton potential with the radiation - like fluid .",
    "furthermore , in the late stage of the cosmological evolution , the effects of the dominant non - relativistic fluid should be considered also . especially , after the transition from the radiation - dominated to the matter - dominated regime , the qualitative behaviour of the considered solutions is expected to change in the latest stage of the cosmological evolution , and the dilaton field might be relevant for phenomenological applications , such as a possible interpretation of the dilaton as the cosmic dark - energy field @xcite ."
