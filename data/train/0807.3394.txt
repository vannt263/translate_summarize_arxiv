    "charged point particles in classical electrodynamics obey an equation of motion , known as the lorentz - dirac equation , that is third order in proper time , and therefore presents various difficulties @xcite . in particular , the lorenz - dirac equation admits unphysical runaway solutions , in which the particle accelerates without bound even in the absence of an external driving force .",
    "the runaway solutions can be eliminated by replacing the lorenz - dirac equation with a second - order integro - differential equation , but this equation has problems of its own : it exhibits advanced effects , in which the particle responds to an external force before the force has been applied .    in this paper we give a simple physical argument that clarifies the origin and physical meaning of these advanced effects , and we compare ordinary electrodynamics with a toy model of electrodynamics in which advanced effects do not occur .",
    "the toy model is closely analogous to ordinary electrodynamics ; for example , there are fields that are analogous to the electric and magnetic fields , and these fields both mediate an interaction between charged particles and support freely propagating radiation .",
    "the toy model , however , does not exhibit the conceptual problems that plague ordinary electrodynamics ; for example , the self - energy of a point particle does not diverge , and there are no advanced effects .",
    "thus , the toy model shows that it is possible to construct a mathematically consistent theory of coupled particles and fields that is not subject to these pathologies . by performing a detailed comparison between the toy model and ordinary electrodynamics",
    ", we can gain insight into the conceptual foundations of electrodynamics , and into the meaning of the advanced effects .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : lorentz - dirac ] , we briefly review the lorentz - dirac equation of motion , the corresponding integro - differential equation of motion , and the causality problems associated with it . in section",
    "[ sec : extended - particle ] , we consider a spatially extended charged particle , and give a simple physical argument that explains the origin of the advanced effects . in section [ sec : toy - model ] , we introduce the toy model of electrodynamics . in section [ sec :",
    "toy - model - advanced ] , we consider a spatially extended particle in the toy model , and derive analogs to the various equations of motion for electrodynamics .",
    "the following notation is used in this paper .",

    "consider a point particle coupled to the electromagnetic field",
    ". we will let @xmath15 and @xmath16 denote the mass and charge of the particle , and we will let @xmath17 denote the position of the particle at proper time @xmath18 . also , we will define @xmath19 to be the velocity of the particle and @xmath20 to be its acceleration .",
    "the equation of motion for the particle is @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the force exerted on the particle by the electromagnetic field and @xmath23 is an arbitrary externally imposed force . for simplicity",
    ", we will assume that @xmath23 depends only on the proper time @xmath18 , and not on the position or velocity of the particle .",
    "the force @xmath22 is given by @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the electromagnetic field strength tensor and @xmath26 is the vector potential . in the lorentz gauge ( @xmath27 )",
    ", the vector potential satisfies the field equation @xmath28 where @xmath29 , the current density , is given by @xmath30 equations ( [ eqn : particle - eqn - of - motion][eqn : current - density - point ] ) give a complete description of the coupled particle - field system .",
    "we can decompose each solution to the field equation ( [ eqn : field - eqn ] ) into the sum of an inhomogeneous solution , which describes the potential generated by the particle , and a homogeneous solution , which describes freely propagating radiation .",
    "it is useful to perform this decomposition in two different ways : @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the retarded and advanced potentials generated by the particle , and @xmath34 and @xmath35 describe incoming and outgoing radiation .",
    "the retarded and advanced potentials are given by @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the retarded and advanced green functions for the inhomogeneous wave equation : @xmath39 using the decompositions of the vector potential given in equation ( [ eqn : a - decomposition ] ) , we can express the field - strength tensor and the electromagnetic force as @xmath40 where , for example , @xmath41 physically , @xmath42 describes the force exerted on the particle by incoming radiation , and @xmath43 describes the self - force exerted on the particle by its own retarded field . in what follows , we will assume that there is no incoming radiation , so @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "we can obtain an explicit expression for the self - force by combining equations ( [ eqn : current - density - point ] ) , ( [ eqn : a - ret - adv ] ) , and ( [ eqn : f - ret - k - ret ] ) . to perform the calculation it is useful to express the self - force in the form @xmath46 , where @xmath47 . as was first shown by dirac @xcite",
    "( see also @xcite , pages 1879 ) , the component @xmath48 is well - defined and is given by @xmath49 where @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "the component @xmath52 , however , is infinite .",
    "the reason for this can be traced to the fact that the retarded fields of a point particle diverge as we approach the particle ; for a spatially extended particle , one can show that @xmath52 is finite and is given by @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the self - energy of the particle and the dots indicate additional terms that vanish in the point particle limit .",
    "we derive an expression for the self - energy of a spherically symmetric particle in appendix [ sec : appendix - self - energy ] , but for now we simply note that the self - energy scales like @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the particle size , and therefore diverges in the point particle limit .",
    "thus , in order to obtain a finite expression for the self - force , let us assume that the particle is spatially extended , but small enough that @xmath48 is well - approximated by equation ( [ eqn : k - minus ] ) and @xmath52 is well - approximated by the first term of equation ( [ eqn : k - plus ] ) : @xmath57 substituting this result into equation ( [ eqn : particle - eqn - of - motion ] ) , we find that the equation of motion for the particle is @xmath58 here @xmath15 is the bare mass of the particle ; that is , the mass that the particle would have if its charge were set to zero .",
    "let us define a renormalized mass @xmath59 and a renormalized time constant @xmath60 .",
    "we can then express the equation of motion as @xmath61 this is the lorentz - dirac equation .",
    "we derived this equation by considering a small spatially extended particle , but it is well - defined in the point particle limit , provided we hold @xmath62 constant and allow @xmath15 to diverge in order to compensate for the divergence of @xmath54 .",
    "it is instructive to consider the low - velocity limit of the lorentz - dirac equation : @xmath63 where @xmath64 .",
    "an ordinary equation of motion is second order in time , and thus requires initial conditions @xmath65 and @xmath66 for the position and velocity , but since equation ( [ eqn : abraham - lorentz ] ) is third order in time we need an additional initial condition @xmath67 for the acceleration .",
    "if @xmath67 is not chosen properly we obtain unphysical runaway solutions .",
    "we can see this for the case of a free particle ( @xmath68 ) , for which the solution to ( [ eqn : abraham - lorentz ] ) is @xmath69 thus , unless @xmath70 we obtain a runaway solution in which the acceleration increases exponentially in time .",
    "we can eliminate the runaway solutions by expressing the solution to ( [ eqn : abraham - lorentz ] ) in terms of a green function @xmath71 : @xmath72 where @xmath71 is defined such that @xmath73 for @xmath74 and @xmath75 let @xmath76 denote the fourier transform of @xmath71 . from equation ( [ eqn : define - g ] ) , it follows that @xmath77 we can view equation ( [ eqn : abraham - lorentz - int - diff ] ) as a new equation of motion for the particle . by its construction",
    "it is a solution to equation ( [ eqn : abraham - lorentz ] ) , so integrating equation ( [ eqn : abraham - lorentz - int - diff ] ) subject to the initial conditions @xmath78 is equivalent to integrating equation ( [ eqn : abraham - lorentz ] ) subject to the initial conditions @xmath79 , where @xmath67 is given by @xmath80 in effect , the integro - differential equation sets the initial condition @xmath67 so as to eliminate the runaway solutions",
    ". we can see this for the case of a free particle : when @xmath68 , equation ( [ eqn : a0 ] ) sets @xmath70 .",
    "note that since @xmath81 for @xmath82 , equation ( [ eqn : abraham - lorentz - int - diff ] ) exhibits advanced effects , in which the acceleration of the particle at time @xmath83 depends on the value of the external force at times @xmath84 .    for simplicity ,",
    "we have shown how the runaway solutions can be eliminated in the low - velocity limit , but the same method can be applied to the full relativistic lorenz - dirac equation ( see section 6.6 of @xcite , section v.6 of @xcite , and @xcite ) .",
    "the resulting equation of motion is @xmath85 note that @xmath86 depends on the value of @xmath87 at proper times @xmath88 , so equation ( [ eqn : lorentz - dirac - int - diff ] ) also exhibits advanced effects .",

    "( b ) conditions ( 13 ) are satisfied for @xmath94 , corresponding to advanced effects . ]",
    "we can gain some insight into the origin of the advanced effects by generalizing equation ( [ eqn : lorentz - dirac - int - diff ] ) to the case of a spatially extended particle of arbitrary size . for simplicity ,",
    "let us consider an extended particle that is spherically symmetric .",
    "the current density is then given by @xmath95 where @xmath16 is the total charge of the particle and @xmath96 describes the radial charge distribution ( this expression for the current density is derived in section 7.4 of @xcite ) .",
    "it is convenient to express the current density in the form @xmath97 where @xmath98 note that @xmath99 vanishes unless @xmath89 lies in the plane of simultaneity for proper time @xmath18 .",
    "we can describe the coupling of the particle to the electromagnetic field in terms of an action @xmath100 and lagrangian @xmath101 : @xmath102 from the euler - lagrange equations , it follows that the electromagnetic force on the extended particle is @xmath103 as before , we can separate the electromagnetic force into a component @xmath104 that describes the self - force and a component @xmath105 that describes the force exerted on the particle by incoming radiation . using equation ( [ eqn : a - ret - adv ] ) to solve for @xmath106 in terms of the current density , we find that the self - force is given by @xmath107 where we have defined @xmath108 if we assume that there is no incoming radiation , the equation of motion for the extended particle is @xmath109 where @xmath104 is given by equation ( [ eqn : k - ret - extended ] ) and @xmath23 describes an arbitrary externally imposed force .",
    "this is a second - order integro - differential equation ; it is exact , and holds for extended particles of arbitrary size .",
    "the equation of motion ( [ eqn : lorentz - dirac - int - diff ] ) that we derived in the previous section should approximate this equation of motion in the limit of a small particle ( the parameters @xmath110 and @xmath111 that appear in equation ( [ eqn : lorentz - dirac - int - diff ] ) are set by the value of the self - energy @xmath54 , which can be determined from @xmath96 using equation ( [ eqn : self - energy ] ) ) .    in general , the self - force acting on the particle at proper time @xmath18 depends on the state of the particle at proper times both earlier and later than @xmath18 .",
    "we can understand this by examining equation ( [ eqn : k - ret - extended - bar ] ) for @xmath91 .",
    "from the three factors in the integrand , it follows that @xmath91 vanishes unless three conditions are met : ( 1 ) there is an event @xmath89 within the world - cylinder of the particle that lies on the plane of simultaneity for proper time @xmath18 , ( 2 ) there is an event @xmath90 within the world - cylinder of the particle that lies on the plane of simultaneity for proper time @xmath92 , ( 3 ) events @xmath89 and @xmath90 are light - like separated , with @xmath90 earlier than @xmath89 .",
    "there are retarded effects when @xmath91 is nonzero for @xmath93 , and advanced effects when it is nonzero for @xmath94 ( see figure [ fig : spacetime - diagrams - electrodynamics ] )",
    ".    we can give a concrete example that illustrates these conditions by considering a uniformly accelerated particle in @xmath112 dimensions .",

    "equation ( [ eqn : j - bar ] ) for @xmath99 generalizes naturally to @xmath112 dimensions ; from the above expressions , it follows that @xmath122 we will assume that @xmath123 for @xmath124 and @xmath125 for @xmath126 , so the trajectories of the left and right edges of the particle are given by @xmath127 and @xmath128 .",

    "the acceleration of a point particle at time @xmath83 only depends on the value of @xmath154 at time @xmath83 , and there are no advanced effects .",
    "second , for the lorentz - dirac equation there is a radiation damping term proportional to the time - derivative of the acceleration , while for equation ( [ eqn : lorentz - dirac - toymodel ] ) the damping term is a function of the particle velocity . for electrodynamics ,",
    "a velocity - dependent damping term is ruled out by lorentz invariance , but the toy model is neither lorenz nor galilean invariant ; there is a preferred reference frame in which the equations of motion for the model are valid , and a particle moving with respect to this preferred frame feels a velocity - dependent drag force .",
    "third , the mass that appears in the lorentz - dirac equation is the renormalized mass , the sum of the bare mass and the self - energy , while the mass that appears in equation ( [ eqn : lorentz - dirac - toymodel ] ) is just the bare mass ; there is no self - energy contribution .",
    "we will explain the reason for this in section [ ssec : eqn - of - motion - approximate ] .",
    "let us now consider a spatially extended particle in the toy model . from equations ( [ eqn : e - r - b - r ] ) , ( [ eqn : phi - r ] ) , and ( [ eqn : f - r - f - in ] )",

    "physically , this is due to the fact that the particle obeys newtonian dynamics , so the planes of simultaneity do not tilt ( see figure [ fig : spacetime - diagram - toymodel ] , and compare with figure [ fig : spacetime - diagrams - electrodynamics ] for electrodynamics ) . in what follows",
    ", we will assume that the charge distribution of the extended particle is @xmath179 where @xmath56 describes the particle size .",
