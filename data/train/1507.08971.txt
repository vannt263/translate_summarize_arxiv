    "we begin by invoking one of the central results of stochastic thermodynamics  @xcite for a system in contact with a heat bath , @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the entropy of the system and @xmath21 is the entropy due to energy exchange between the system and environment .",
    "[ eq : stochasticthermo ] is simply a statement of the second law of thermodynamics",
    ".    the growing self assembling structure will be the thermodynamic system for the purposes of this paper .",

    "let @xmath22 denote the probability distribution associated with the observing a system size @xmath6 and a microscopic configuration @xmath9 at a particular instant of time .",
    "the entropy of the system @xmath20 is given by @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "to proceed , we decompose the distribution @xmath22 as @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath8 are both normalized probability distributions . in performing the decomposition we have assumed that the system has reached a steady state and that distribution of compositional fluctuations for a given system size , and that @xmath8 is independent of the time @xmath27 .",
    "this decomposition is the main assumption behind our theoretical approach . with this assumption",
    ", we can associate an effective energy function @xmath28 with the distribution @xmath8 , @xmath29 .",
    "this is simply a statistical defining relation for the energy function ( analogous to a potential of mean force ) .",
    "the energy function @xmath28 does not control the dynamics of the system .",
    "this effective energy function can have a form very different from that of the interactions specified by the interaction hamiltonian @xmath30 .        using this decomposition and the total average entropy production rate in a self assembly process ,",
    "@xmath31 can be written as @xmath32\\\\ & = \\frac{d\\langle n \\rangle_t}{dt }   \\left[\\delta \\mu- \\langle \\epsilon_{\\rm diss}\\rangle\\right]\\geq 0 \\ , .",

    "we obtain the bound on @xmath34 .    hence , in order to have a growing assembly with a distribution of compositional fluctuations characteristic of the energy function @xmath14 , the chemical potential difference @xmath4 must at least exceed @xmath35 , @xmath36 a simple algebraic manipulation allows us to rewrite eq .",
    "[ eq : centralresult1 ] as eq .",
    "[ eq : central ] .",
    "when the chemical potentials of the monomers contributing to the assembly are unequal , @xmath4 is replaced by the average excess chemical potential for the growing assembly , @xmath17 .",
    "the structure of eq .",
    "[ eq : centralresult1 ] is reminiscent of the variational gibbs - bogoliubov - feynman inequality generalized for non - equilibrium systems .",
    "as such it can be applied to obtain bounds on optimal non - equilibrium driving forces that can maximize the yield of desired structures . finally , our central results show how the average entropy production rate in a self assembly process is coupled to the compositional fluctuations in the self assembled system .",
    "recent work by barato , seifert and coworkers has demonstrated that the entropy production rate bounds the fluctuations of various dynamical currents generated in a non - equilibrium processes  @xcite . in the next section , using a model system , we demonstrate that the bound imposed by the entropy production rate on cumulants of fluctuations of the growth rate of the assembly lead to a set of tighter design principles , @xmath37 where @xmath38 denotes the average rate of growth of the assembly , @xmath39 denotes the variance in the growth rate of the assembly .",
    "we will now illustrate the result on two space filling lattice based model systems . in each example",
    ", the distribution of compositional fluctuations in the growing assembly is modified when the assembly is grown at a non - zero rate .",
    "our bound acts as a design principle and provides intuition into how the equilibrium landscape of compositional fluctuations is modified under a non - equilibrium drive .",
    "we emphasize that while these examples focus on distributions of compositional fluctuations , our central results are valid more generally and also apply to statistics of structural fluctuations  @xcite .",
    "we choose the lattice based models as examples because they are analytically tractable and serve to illustrate the utility of eq .",

    "in addition , only nearest neighbors interaction is allowed between monomers . in scenarios where the polymer is nucleated from a solution ,",
    "the concentration of monomers or their chemical potential provides the non - equilibrium driving force for the assembly .",
    "if the average length of monomer domains in a polymer at equilibrium is @xmath40 , our results impose a constraint on the excess chemical potential required to achieve assemblies in which the average length of monomer domains is @xmath41 ( si ) ,    @xmath42\\equiv \\langle\\epsilon_{\\rm diss}\\rangle   \\label{eq : centralisingone}\\ ] ]    where @xmath4 is the excess chemical potential and we have assumed that the two monomers have the same chemical potential .",
    "the compositions in such an assembly differ from those obtained close to equilibrium ( @xmath43 ) when the polymer grows at an infinitesimally slow rate .",
    "our thermodynamic bound does nt depend on the kinetic model chosen .",
    "further , as discussed previously , in cases with unequal chemical potentials , eq .",
    "[ eq : centralisingone ] can be generalized by simply replacing @xmath4 with the average excess chemical potential .",
    "we theoretically verify the bound for the polymer assembly problem by mapping the dynamics of the self assembly process onto an effective markov state model ( fig [ fig : xi ] ( b ) ) .",
    "this effective model resolves the terminal bond in the self - assembled system ( vertical rungs ) and the number of particles in the self assembled system ( horizontal axis ) .",
    "the details of the various transition rates between the mesoscopic states are provide in the supplemental information ( si ) . in the si",
    ", we also demonstrate that the markov state caricature accurately describes the dynamics and compositional fluctuations of the self assembly process .",
    "further , we demonstrate that the expression for the entropy production rate , @xmath44 computed from this markov state caricature indeed equals @xmath45 where @xmath46 is defined in eq .",
    "[ eq : centralisingone ] .",
    "this calculation verifies the thermodynamic bound and its underlying assumptions for the one dimensional polymer assembly model .",
    "the markov state caricature allows us to map the self assembly process onto the dynamics of a random walker on a graph . in the si , we verify that the effective mean field markov state caricature manages to reasonably describe even the second cumulant of fluctuations in the growth rate .",
    "barato , seifert and coworkers have recently demonstrated  @xcite that fluctuations of various dynamical currents in such markov state process are bound by the entropy production rate . as demonstrated in the si ,",
    "we adapt these bounds to show that @xmath47 + \\frac{2\\langle { \\dot n } \\rangle}{t \\langle ( \\delta { \\dot n})^2 \\rangle}\\ ] ] where @xmath48 is the average growth rate of the polymer and @xmath49 is the variance of the growth rate .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : xi](c ) , we demonstrate the two thermodynamic bounds in eq .",
    "[ eq : centralisingone ] , eq .  [ eq : centrallinear ] for a particular kinetic model of polymer growth  @xcite .",
    "including information from higher order cumulants does indeed strengthen the bound .",
    "these demonstrations prove the theoretical validity and effectiveness of our bound and pave the way for applications to more complex systems .    specifically , for systems with more than two monomer types or for monomers with longer ranged interactions , it is more convenient to express @xmath50 in terms of the actual @xmath51 and effective @xmath52 interaction hamiltonians .",
    "while effective markov state caricatures for such systems can be complex and analytically intractable , our thermodynamic bounds are easily accessible and provide very useful intuition for the compositional fluctuations of the non - equilibrium assembly .",
    "we now demonstrate these ideas by considering a two - dimensional analogue of the fiber growth process described above  @xcite ( fig .",

    "the details of the kinetic model are described in methods . when the chemical potential is set to the intensive equilibrium free energy of the assembly , @xmath55",
    ", the assembly does nt grow on average . assigning spin @xmath56 to the red monomers and spin @xmath57 to the blue monomers , the statistics of the compositional fluctuations in the equilibrium assembly are equivalent to that of an ising model with coupling constant @xmath58 .",
    "we will work in regimes where the coupling constant is above the critical coupling constant of the ising model , @xmath59 .",
    "we are interested in the statistics of compositional fluctuations as the growth rate of the assembly is tuned by changing the chemical potential .",
    "we begin by assuming that the compositional fluctuations in the growing assembly can be described by an effective nearest neighbor coupling constant @xmath60 .",
    "we performed simulations in which we extracted the value of @xmath60 as a function of the excess chemical potential @xmath4 by analyzing compositional fluctuations in the growing assembly ( methods ) .",
    "the values of @xmath60 obtained from simulations are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : ising2deffective](b ) .",

    "when the excess chemical potential is close to @xmath62 , the value of the effective coupling constant computed from simulations reaches the critical value of the two dimensional ising model , @xmath63 .    using eq .",
    "[ eq : centralresult1 ] and eq .",
    "[ eq : centralresult2 ] we analytically computed a lower bound @xmath64 on the values of the effective coupling constant as a function of @xmath4 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : ising2deffective ] ( b ) , we plot the difference @xmath65 for various values of the excess chemical potential .",
    "the bound obtained from eq .",
    "[ eq : centralresult2 ] does a reasonable job of predicting the effective coupling constant .",
    "including information about higher order cumulants again improves the bound and provides a close to accurate estimate of the effective coupling constant @xmath60 . in particular , the bound obtained by including information form the higher cumulants ( eq .  [ eq : centralresult2 ] ) does particularly well for values of @xmath4 around the critical value , @xmath66 .",
    "this close agreement between the bound predicted by theory and the effective value computed from simulations in the critical regime is surprising given the minimal nature of our theory .",
    "we found similar results for other values of the coupling constant @xmath67 .",
    "strikingly , for all the regimes considered , the bounds are particularly accurate when the assembly is close to criticality .",
    "the results illustrate the utility of our central relations as design principles for non - equilibrium self assembly .",
    "using the framework of stochastic thermodynamics and physically justified approximations , we have put forward a general predictive framework for non - equilibrium self assembly . our central results , eq .",
    "[ eq : centralresult1 ] and eq .",
    "[ eq : centralresult2 ] are built around a simple and intuitive expression for entropy production in non - equilibrium self assembly process .",
    "this expression relates compositional fluctuations in the self assembled system to the chemical potential excess driving assembly process .",
    "given a set of programmed interactions between monomers and structures specified by the energy function @xmath0 , our central result constrains the set of allowed structures that can be obtained under a non - equilibrium drive .",
    "a unique feature of our result is its thermodynamic character : the bound does nt depend on the details of the kinetic model chosen .",
    "many recent theoretical and experimental studies have postulated that non - equilibrium protocols can potentially be used to overcome bottlenecks and enhance the yield of desired self assembled structures  @xcite .",
    "our framework is ideally suited to verify these postulates and explore connections between energy consumption and improved yield of target structures .",
    "we anticipate that our results will find important applications in studies of crystal nucleation  @xcite , self assembly of metal organic frameworks  @xcite , non - equilibrium roughening transitions , and the synthesis of nano crystals using dna and other biopolymers as building materials . in all these instances ,",
    "the assembly process can occur far from equilibrium depending on the effective chemical potentials imposed .",
    "our result provides a bound on the chemical potentials under which the desired structures can be robustly obtained even far from equilibrium .",
    "it also provides crucial intuition into how the equilibrium landscape  @xcite and the capacity of the system to store structures  @xcite is modified under non - equilibrium conditions .",
    "finally , the variational structure of our central results provides a framework to optimally tune the chemical potential driving forces so as to maximize the yield of desired structures . in this context ,",
    "our results complement recently derived theoretical results that suggest a heteregeous set of excess chemical potentials is crucial for robust nucleation of large complex nanoscale assemblies using dna origami  @xcite .",
    "a mismatch of chemical potentials provides the non - equilibrium driving force in eq .",
    "[ eq : centralresult1 ] .",
    "our results also apply to non - equilibrium error correction mechanisms for biopolymer assembly in which the assembly process is driven by consumption of energy rich atp / gtp molecules . in such instances ,",
    "the @xmath4 term is replaced by the appropriate average energy consumption rate . in these biophysical applications",
    ", the non - equilibrium driving force generates structures that posses correlations greater than those in equilibrium . while such fibers are not achievable with the kinetic protocols described above , the thermodynamic nature of our bounds allows their application to these biophysical error correction mechanisms .",
    "indeed , sartori et al  @xcite have recently derived a similar bound for a specific model of kinetic proofreading .",
    "our general thermodynamic bounds , particular that in eq .",
    "[ eq : centralresult2 ] can elucidate the tradeoffs between speed accuracy and energy consumption in such non - equilibrium biochemical replication processes .",
    "in our 1d polymer growth simulation , we consider a polymer growing in a bath containing two types of monomer .",
    "the concentrations of both types are equal to c. the chemical potential @xmath68 is related to the concentration c by the relation : @xmath69 .",
    "the nearest neighbor monomers are allowed to interact with energy @xmath53 if they are the same and with energy @xmath54 if they are different .",
    "we perform kinetic monte - carlo simulations in which monomers are added to the polymer with the rate c ( or @xmath70 ) .",
    "monomers are allowed to dissociate from the polymer with the rate @xmath71 ( i here can be either s or d ) which depends solely on the composition of the fiber .",
    "@xmath72 is set to 1 .",
    "we use @xmath73 to denote the probability that a particular bond in the assembly is between two like monomers .",
    "it is related to the correlation length @xmath41 by : @xmath74 .    the simulations for the non - equilibrium 2d assembly problem follow the same rules as in the 1d case .",
    "however , we used the standard metropolis monte - carlo algorithms for the 2d case . for the purposes of computing the effective coupling constant @xmath60 we labeled the red particles as spin up @xmath56 and blue particles as spin down @xmath57 .",
