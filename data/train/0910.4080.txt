    "the process @xmath1 represents a very important background reaction to searches at the lhc , in particular to @xmath2 production , where the higgs boson decays into a @xmath3 pair .",
    "a successful analysis of this production channel at the lhc requires the knowledge of direct @xmath0 production at nlo in qcd @xcite .",
    "moreover , the calculation of nlo qcd corrections to @xmath4 processes at the lhc represents the current technical frontier .",
    "the complexity of such calculations triggered the creation of prioritized experimenters wishlists where the @xmath0 production ranges among the most wanted candidates @xcite .",
    "the nlo computation for this process has been completed only very recently in @xcite and then confirmed in @xcite where we demonstrated the power of our system based on helac - phegas @xcite , which has , on its own , already been extensively used and tested in phenomenological studies see @xcite , helac-1loop @xcite , which is not yet publicly available , cuttoolspittau / cuttools/ ] @xcite and helac - dipoles @xcite in a realistic computation with six external legs and massive partons . in the following we",
    "briefly summarize the calculation of the virtual and real corrections and present numerical results for the lhc .",
    "a one - loop @xmath5particle amplitude can be expressed in terms of a basis of known @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9point scalar integrals : boxes , triangles , bubbles and tadpoles .",
    "the coefficients depend in general on the dimension of space - time , @xmath10 , which , upon expansion around @xmath11 , generates a rational function in the invariants ( rational term ) .",
    "the concept behind modern methods of evaluation , is the direct determination of the coefficients , without recurring to a passarino - veltman reduction .    in our case ,",
    "the coefficients and one part of the rational term ( see @xcite ) are extracted via the opp reduction method at the integrand level @xcite , which is implemented in cuttools .",
    "the second part of the rational term coming from the epsilon - dimensional contributions in the numerator is computed with the help of dedicated feynman rules @xcite .",
    "the opp reduction is based on a representation of the numerator of amplitudes , a polynomial in the integration momentum , in a basis of polynomials given by products of the functions in the denominators .",
    "clearly , the cancellation of such terms with the actual denominators will lead to scalar functions with a lower number of denominators . by virtue of the proof provided by the passarino - veltman reduction",
    ", we will end up with a tower of four - point and lower functions , as mentioned before . the determination of the decomposition in the new basis proceeds recursively , by setting chosen denominators on - shell .",
    "this is where the opp method resembles generalized unitarity @xcite .",
    "for most recent applications see @xcite    it is important to stress , that working around four dimensions , allows to compute the numerator function in four dimensions .",
    "the difference to the complete result is of the order of @xmath12 , and can therefore be determined a posteriori in a simplified manner . since the calculation of the coefficients of the reduction requires the evaluation of the numerator function for a given value of the loop momentum , the corresponding diagrams can be thought as tree level ( all momenta are fixed ) graphs . to complete the analogy , one needs to chose a propagator and consider it as cut . at this point",
    "the original amplitude for an @xmath13 particle process becomes a tree level amplitude for an @xmath14 particle process .",
    "the advantage is that its value can be obtained by a tree level automate such as helac .",
    "the bookkeeping necessary for a practical implementation is managed by a new software , helac-1loop .",
    "to recapitulate , a complete calculation involves three building components : 1 ) cuttools , for the reduction of integrals with a given numerator to a basis of scalar functions ; 2 ) helac-1loop for the evaluation of the numerator functions for given loop momentum ( fixed by cuttools ) ; 3 ) oneloophameren/ ] @xcite , a library of scalar functions , which provides the actual numerical values of the integrals . at the end",
    ", the 1-loop result is given in the form of real and imaginary parts of the finite term and of the coefficients of the @xmath15 and @xmath16 poles .",
    "the above procedure provides the bare 1-loop amplitude .",
    "renormalization is performed as usual , by evaluating tree level diagrams with counterterms . for our process",
    ", we chose to renormalize the coupling in the @xmath17 scheme , but the mass in the on - shell scheme ( wave function renormalization is done in the on - shell scheme as it must be ) .",
    "notice , that also this part is performed in four dimensions .",
    "this means , that the whole procedure is equivalent to the t hooft - veltman version of dimensional regularization @xcite .",
    "let us emphasise that all parts are calculated fully numerically in a completely automatic manner .",
    "the singularities from soft or collinear gluon emission are isolated via dipole subtraction for nlo qcd calculations @xcite using the formulation for massive quarks @xcite and for arbitrary polarizations @xcite . after combining virtual and real corrections ,",
    "singularities connected to collinear configurations in the final state as well as soft divergencies in the initial and final states cancel for collinear - safe observables automatically after applying a jet algorithm .",
    "singularities connected to collinear initial - state splittings are removed via factorization by pdf redefinitions .",
    "we do not use finite dipoles regularizing the quasi - collinear divergence induced by both top quarks moving in the same direction . due to the large top quark mass",
    ", they are not needed to improve the numerical convergence .",
    "calculations are performed with the help of the helac - dipoles software , which is a complete and publicly available automatic implementation of catani - seymour dipole subtraction and consists of phase space integration of subtracted real radiation and integrated dipoles in both massless and massive cases .",
    "let us stress at this point , that a phase space restriction on the contribution of the dipoles as originally proposed in @xcite is also implemented .",
    "all results presented in the next section have been obtained with @xmath18 parameter .",
    "the phase - space integration is performed with the multichannel monte carlo generator phegas @xcite and optimized via parnihameren/ ] @xcite .",
    "we present predictions for @xmath19 at @xmath20 tev . for the top - quark mass",
    "we take @xmath21 gev , while all other qcd partons , including b quarks , are treated as massless .",
    "final states involving collinear gluons and b - quarks are recombined into collinear - safe jets by means of the @xmath22-algorithm @xcite .",
    "specifically we require two b - quark jets with separation @xmath23 in the rapidity azimuthal - angle plane .",
    "motivated by the search for a @xmath24 signal at the lhc @xcite , we impose the following additional cuts on the transverse momenta and rapidity of the b - quark jets : @xmath25 gev , @xmath26 .",
    "the outgoing ( anti)top quarks are neither affected by the jet algorithm nor by phase - space cuts .",

    "the full lo and nlo cross sections are given by @xmath34 fb and @xmath35 fb respectively .",
    "varying the scale up and down by a factor 2 in a uniform way changes the cross section by 70% in the lo case , while in the nlo case we have obtained a variation of the order 33% .",
