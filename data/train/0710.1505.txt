    "flavor changing neutral current ( fcnc ) decays induced by the @xmath5 transition are promising decays for checking predictions of the standard model ( sm ) at quantum loop level , since they are forbidden at tree level in the sm .",
    "these transitions are also very suitable in looking for new physics beyond the sm .    in the sm",
    "the @xmath6 decay receives special attention due to the theoretical advantage that uncertainties in this decay are much smaller compared to other fcnc decays due to the absence of photonic penguin diagrams and hadronic long distance effects .",
    "however , in spite of these theoretical advantages experimental measurement of this inclusive channel seems to be very difficult , because it requires a construction of all @xmath7 .",
    "therefore , experimentalists focus only on exclusive channels like @xmath8 .",

    "another class of decays , which is described by the @xmath9 transition at inclusive level , is the baryonic @xmath10 decay .",
    "it should be noted that it is impossible to analyze the helicity structure of the effective hamiltonian in @xmath11 meson decays governed by @xmath12 transition , since the information about chiralities of the quarks is lost in the hadronization process . in contrary to the mesonic decays , baryonic decays could access the helicity structure of the effective hamiltonian for the @xmath5 transition @xcite .",
    "therefore the heavy baryonic decays can be very rich for studying the polarization effects .",
    "radiative and semileptonic decays of @xmath1 baryon , such as @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 , are comprehensively studied in the framework of sm in many works @xcite .",
    "present status of the experimental investigations of heavy baryons is discussed in @xcite .",
    "as has already been noted , fcnc transitions are very sensitive to the existence of new physics beyond the sm .",
    "one such model is the so  called unparticles is proposed by h. georgi @xcite .",
    "it is assumed in this model that , at very high energies the theory contains sm fields and the fields with a non  trivial infrared fixed point so that in the infrared limit it will be an asymptotic conformal theory and be scale ",

    "renormalizable couplings between sm and bz fields will be induced and renormalizable couplings between the bz fields are then produced by dimensional transmutation , and the scale  invariant unparticle fields emerge below a scale @xmath4 . in the effective theory , below @xmath4 , bz operators match onto the unparticle operators , and non  renormalizable interactions between sm and unparticle operators can be obtained . an important result in this theory",
