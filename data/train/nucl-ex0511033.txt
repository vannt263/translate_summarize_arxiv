    "the phenix experiment at the relativistic heavy ion collider has made measurements of several event - by - event fluctuation observables .",
    "these measurements include the following : fluctuations in the net charge , which are sensitive to the charge distribution within the collision volume ; fluctuations in the mean transverse momentum , which are sensitive to critical fluctuations in the temperature of the system and may be large in the presence of a phase transition from hadronic matter to a quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) ; and fluctuations in charged particle multiplicity , which appear to exhibit non - monotonic behavior as a function of centrality at sps energies .",
    "however , each of these fluctuation observables are also sensitive to known processes such as charge conservation , resonance decays , elliptic flow , and hard processes .",
    "therefore the contribution of these known processes must be thoroughly investigated before reliably interpreting the results of the measurement .",
    "details about the phenix experimental configuration can be found elsewhere @xcite .",
    "all of the measurements described here utilized the phenix central arm detectors .",
    "the phenix acceptance with a maximum acceptance of @xmath0 in pseudorapidity and @xmath1 in azimuthal angle is considered small for event - by - event measurements .",
    "however , the event - by - event multiplicities are high enough in rhic heavy ion collisions that phenix has a competitive sensitivity for the detection of fluctuation signals . for example , a detailed examination of the phenix sensitivity to temperature fluctuations derived from the measurement of mean @xmath2 fluctuations is described in @xcite .",
    "a promising signature for the presence of a qgp is the observation of event - by - event fluctuations in the net charge .",
    "it has been hypothesized that fluctuations in the net charge would be significantly reduced in a qgp scenario , where the fractional electric charges of the quarks are more evenly spread throughout the qgp volume than the unit electric charges of the hadrons in a hadronic gas volume @xcite .",
    "phenix has measured net charge fluctuations in au+au collisions at @xmath3 = 130 and 200 gev @xcite .",
    "the measurements have been made as a function of centrality , pseudorapidity range , and azimuthal angle range .",
    "the fluctuations are quoted using the variable @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the net charge , @xmath6 is the total number of charged particles , and @xmath7 represents the variance of the net charge .",
    "the expectations for the value of @xmath8 are 1.0 for random particle emission , 0.75 for a resonance gas , 0.83 for a quark coalescence scenario , and 0.25 for a qgp in small acceptance ranges @xcite .",

    "shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : qflucvscent ] are the phenix measurements as a function of centrality .",
    "the small difference in the two datasets is due to the effect of tighter track cuts that effectively reduce the acceptance in the @xmath3 = 200 gev sample . for the 10% most central collisions with @xmath0 , @xmath9 mev / c , and @xmath10 , @xmath11 for @xmath3 = 130 gev and @xmath12 ( phenix preliminary ) for @xmath3 = 200 gev au+au collisions .",
    "the value of @xmath8 must be adjusted for charge conservation by a factor of @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the fraction of the charged particles produced within the acceptance range .",
    "@xmath8 is also expected to be reduced by the decay of neutral resonances .",
    "the reduction due to resonance decays should decrease with increasing geometrical acceptance since more particle pairs from larger opening angles will be included in the measurement .",
    "[ fig : qflucvsphi ] shows the measurement of @xmath8 as a function of azimuthal angle range for the 10% most central collisions . the expected decrease in @xmath8 as the azimuthal range is increased",
    "is observed .",
    "the decrease is larger than the expectation from charge conservation alone by more than 3 standard deviations .",
    "however , the decrease is consistent with results from rqmd simulations @xcite in the phenix acceptance , thus emphasizing the importance of the resonance decay contribution . as a result ,",
    "phenix measurements of charge fluctuations are consistent with the expectations of statistically independent particle emission .",
    "event - by - event fluctuations in the mean transverse momentum , @xmath15 , may be sensitive to temperature fluctuations near the qcd critical point @xcite .",
    "phenix has measured the magnitude of these fluctuations in au+au collisions at @xmath3 = 130 gev and 200 gev as a function of centrality and @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "phenix measurements are quoted in the variable @xmath16 in percent , where @xmath17 .",
    "this observable can be related to other fluctuation variables currently in use with some reasonable assumptions @xcite . here , the baseline , random , distribution is constructed using mixed events .",
    "it is important that the number of tracks , @xmath18 , for the mixed events are sampled directly from the data distribution since the standard deviation of the distribution of the event - by - event mean @xmath19 depends on @xmath18 .",

    "contributions from hbt , resonance decays , and elliptic flow have been studied using simulations and are found to be very small or negligible .",
    "another possible source of the signal is from hard scattering processes , which are expected to produce event - by - event correlations in @xmath19 , especially at higher @xmath19 . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ptflucvsptmm ] , the majority of the contribution to the fluctuations occur at high @xmath19 . there is a 243% increase in the signal when the maximum of the @xmath19 range over which the average @xmath19 is calculated increases from 1.0 to 2.0 gev / c .",
    "this very large increase can not be attributed to statistical fluctuations , since the number of particles increases by less than 15% over that range . in order to investigate the contributions due to jet production , a data - driven two - component model consisting of 1 ) a simulation of soft processes by reproducing the inclusive @xmath19 and @xmath18 distributions as a function of centrality , and 2 ) a simulation of hard scattering processes by embedding pythia jet events at a given rate per produced particle from step 1 ( while conserving the @xmath18 distribution ) .",
    "this rate is the only free parameter in the simulation . after adjusting the rate",
    "so that the fluctuations match the data in a reference centrality bin , the simulation is run as a function of centrality within the phenix detector acceptance with a ) the pythia event embedding rate kept constant and b ) with the pythia event embedding rate scaled by the measurement of the nuclear modification factor , @xmath22 .",
    "the results of the simulation superimposed with the phenix data are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ptflucvscentmm ] and [ fig : ptflucvsptmm ] .",
    "the simulation with the @xmath22-scaled rate agrees with the centrality - dependent ( and also the @xmath19-dependent ) trends remarkably well . within this simulation , the decrease of fluctuations in the most peripheral collisions",
    "is attributed to the fact that the signal begins to compete with the magnitude of the statistical fluctuations , while most of the decrease of fluctuations in the most central collisions may be attributed to the onset of jet suppression . using the rate determined from the phenix data",
    ", the simulation also reproduces the magnitude of fluctuations observed by star @xcite in 130 gev au+au collisions @xcite .",

    "[ fig : ptflucvscenthij ] and [ fig : ptflucvspthij ] .",
    "although hijing qualitatively reproduces the @xmath19-dependent trend , it does not reproduce the centrality dependence .",
    "the reason for this is not yet understood .",
    "one way to directly compare the fluctuation measurements from all of the experiments is to estimate the magnitude of any residual event - by - event temperature fluctuations using the prescription outlined in @xcite .",
    "the most central collision fluctuation values correspond to maximum temperature fluctuations of 1.8% in phenix , 1.7% in star , 1.3% in ceres , and 0.7% in na49 .",
    "disagreement in the ceres and na49 measurements may be due to differences in the pseudorapidity region over which the measurement was made . in all cases ,",
    "the residual temperature fluctuations are small and do not significantly increase between sps and rhic energies .",
