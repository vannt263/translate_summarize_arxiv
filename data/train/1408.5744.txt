    "historically the so - called abc effect , which denotes an intriguing low - mass enhancement in the @xmath1 invariant mass spectrum , is known from inclusive measurements of two - pion production in nuclear fusion reactions to the few - body systems @xmath8 , @xmath0he and @xmath9he .",
    "it has been named after the initials of abashian , booth and crowe , who were the first to observe this effect in 1960 by studying the inclusive @xmath10he x reaction @xcite .",
    "its explanation has been a puzzle since then . in subsequent bubble - chamber @xcite and single - arm magnetic spectrometer measurements @xcite this enhancement",
    "was observed also in double - pionic fusion reactions leading to @xmath8 , @xmath0he and @xmath9he , if an isoscalar pion pair was produced .",
    "however , such an enhancement was not observed in fusion reactions leading to deuteron and triton , if an isovector pion pair was produced .",
    "these results led to the conclusion that this effect only appears in reactions , where the participating nucleons fuse to a nuclear bound system in the final state in combination with the production of an isoscalar pion pair .    in recent exclusive and kinematically complete measurements of the @xmath11 reaction",
    "it has been demonstrated @xcite that the abc effect in this basic double - pionic fusion reaction is correlated with a narrow structure in the total cross section with quantum numbers @xmath12 , a mass of 2.37 gev and a width of about 70 mev .",
    "the mass is about 90 mev below 2@xmath13 , the mass of a @xmath7 system , and the width is three times narrower than expected from a conventional @xmath6-channel @xmath7 process .    on the contrary the basic isovector fusion process @xmath14 exhibits neither an abc effect nor a narrow resonance structure @xcite in agreement with the observations in all other @xmath15 initiated two - pion channels @xcite .",
    "isospin decomposition of all three reactions @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath14 leading to the double - pionic fusion of deuterium ensured that the resonance structure is of purely isoscalar nature @xcite .",
    "also recently published data on the @xmath18 reaction show evidence for the resonance structure , though in this case of an isovector pion pair the abc effect is absent @xcite .",
    "compelling evidence that the isoscalar resonance structure observed in two - pion production processes denotes truly a @xmath19-channel resonance in the @xmath20 system comes from polarized @xmath21 scattering in the energy region of the abc effect @xcite .",
    "inclusion of these data in the said data base with subsequent partial - wave analysis produces a pole at ( @xmath22 ) mev in the coupled @xmath23 partial waves in full agreement with the here discussed resonance hypothesis .    since in these latter reactions",
    "the resonance is not associated with any abc effect , it was called no longer abc resonance , but @xmath5 @xcite  in historical reference to a predicted @xcite dibaryon with exactly the quantum numbers as we observe it now .",
    "the existence of the abc effect in the double - pionic fusion to @xmath0he and @xmath9he has been confirmed by exclusive and kinematically complete experiments at celsius / wasa @xcite and recently also at anke - cosy @xcite . in measurements at wasa - at - cosy it has been additionally shown that in the @xmath3he@xmath4 reaction the abc effect is again correlated with a resonance structure in the total cross section at @xmath24  2.37 gev + 2@xmath25 @xcite .",
    "however , in comparison to the basic fusion reaction to deuterium the width of the resonance structure appears substantially broadened , which may be attributed to the fermi motion of the nucleons in initial and final nuclei as well as due to collision damping .",
    "so what is left in this scenario is the question , whether also in case of the double - pionic fusion to @xmath0he the abc effect is correlated with a resonance structure in the total cross section .",
    "in an effort to find an experimental answer for this question we have analyzed corresponding two - pion production data , which were obtained with wasa at cosy @xcite primarily for other reasons .",
    "the data sets , which we used , originate from two different runs .",
    "the first run concerns a proton beam of energy @xmath26 = 1.0 gev hitting the deuterium pellet target @xcite .",
    "this allows us to analyze the reaction @xmath10he@xmath4 at @xmath26 = 1.0 gev .",
    "the beam energy corresponds to a center - of - mass ( cm ) energy of @xmath27 = 3.42 gev = 2.48 gev + @xmath25 , _ i.e. _ pertains to the high - energy end of the region , where the abc effect has been observed previously @xcite",
    ".    the second data set used for our purposes concerns runs with a deuteron beam of @xmath28 = 1.4 and 1.7 gev , respectively , hitting the deuterium pellet target .",
    "we use these runs to obtain data for the quasifree reaction @xmath29he@xmath30 in the range 3.1 gev @xmath31 3.4 gev ( with respect to the @xmath0he@xmath4 system ) , _ i.e. _ covering just the abc region .",
    "both data sets allow an exclusive and kinematically complete reconstruction of the @xmath0he@xmath4 events with kinematic overconstraints .",
    "the trigger for a valid event was just a single track in the forward detector of wasa with high thresholds in its first scintillation detector layers , in order to suppress fast protons and deuterons . with this trigger condition the data rate of accepted events was at moderate 2 khz .",
    "the selection criteria for the offline analysis were a single he track in the forward detector and four neutral hits in the central detector .",
    "the emerging @xmath0he particles were registered in the forward detector of wasa and identified by the @xmath32e - e technique .",
    "the photons from the @xmath33 decay were detected and identified in the central detector @xcite .",
    "consequently four - momenta were measured for all emitted particles of an event with the exception of the spectator neutron , which appears in the second reaction type only .",
    "together with the condition that two pairs of the detected photons have to fulfill the @xmath33 mass condition , we have 6 overconstraints for the kinematic fit of an event in the first reaction type and 3 overconstraints in the second case . from the three possible combinations to reconstruct the four - momenta of the two pions out of four photon signals the one with the smallest @xmath34 has been selected @xcite .",
    "all particles have been detected over the full solid angle with the exception of those @xmath0he ejectiles , which escaped in the beam - pipe ( polar angles @xmath35 ) .",
    "acceptance and efficiency corrections have been made by use of monte carlo ( mc ) simulations of detector setup and performance . for a self - consistent procedure",
    "the reaction model used in the mc simulations has been iteratively adjusted to the experimental results .    with regard to the second data set the momentum spectra of the reconstructed neutron",
    "are shown in fig .  1",
    ", at the top for @xmath28 = 1.4 gev and at the bottom for @xmath28 = 1.7 gev .",
    "the strong enhancement of events at low momenta corresponds to the situation , when the spectator neutron originates from the target deuteron , whereas the enhancement at the high - momentum end corresponds to a spectator neutron stemming from a beam deuteron .",
    "the area in between is covered by non - quasifree processes , so - called coherent processes , where the reconstructed neutron is not just a kinematic spectator , but also plays an active role in the reaction dynamics .",
    "misidentified @xmath9he particles could be eliminated in subsequent analysis steps by the constraint that the reconstructed neutron should not have the same direction and velocity as the detected he particle .",

    "unfortunately also here we met difficulties , since the energies of the @xmath0he ejectiles deposited in the segments of the forward detector turned out to be partly below the trigger thresholds , which were increased for the observation of other reaction channels of primary interest in these runs .",
    "as a consequence we had to tune the actual trigger thresholds individually for each of the detector segments very carefully by adjusting the simulations of the detector performance to the observed response of each of the corresponding scintillation detectors .    comparing the spectra in fig .  1 , top and bottom",
    ", we see that at higher beam energy the coherent process has much reduced compared to the quasifree process . hence , also in this respect it is more favorable to analyze the 1.7 gev data for the @xmath0he@xmath4 production channel .",

    "to get rid of the latter as well as of the target related spectators , we subsequently constrain the polar angle for the reconstructed neutrons to the kinematical spectator limit of @xmath42 for beam related spectators , where the superscript @xmath43 denotes the angle in the @xmath39 center - of - mass system . that way we obtain a momentum spectrum of the spectator neutrons , which is very close to that given by the dotted line in fig .  1 and which is essentially free of background .",
    "the absolute normalization of the data from the single - energy measurement at @xmath26 = 1.0 gev was obtained by a relative normalization to the @xmath10he@xmath33 reaction measured simultaneously with the same trigger .",

    "though this procedure appears to be straightforward , it contains a number of difficulties .",
    "the saclay data appear to be most reliable at @xmath44 @xcite , where wasa can not measure .",
    "hence we used the full back - angle hemisphere to adjust the wasa results to those of saclay .",
    "however , due to the scarcity of saclay data at finite angles we estimate that the total uncertainty in the absolute normalization could be as large as 30@xmath45 .",
    "for details see ref .",
    "@xcite .    the data of the quasi - free run overlap with the single - energy measurement at their high - energy end .",

    "the results of this calculation is shown in figs .  3 , 5 - 6 by the solid lines , which provide a reasonable description of the data .",
    "in these calculations it is assumed that both the @xmath5 resonance and the @xmath6-channel @xmath7 process happen on the active @xmath20 pair .",
    "the @xmath7 process is of both isoscalar and isovector character . from isospin",
    "coupling it follows that the latter is more than three times as large @xcite .",
    "since only the isoscalar part of the @xmath7 process interferes with @xmath5 , the interference effect between both processes is small .",
    "the relative size of both processes as well as the width of @xmath5 resonance has been adjusted for best reproduction of the observed @xmath52 distributions .",
    "the resulting effective @xmath5 width of 85 mev means that there is  if at all  only a small broadening due to collision damping .",
    "it is appreciably smaller than in the @xmath9he case , where the collision broadening was about 50 mev .",
    "the result of the fit to the @xmath52 spectra has been scaled in absolute height to the total cross section data in fig .",
    "we see that the @xmath5 resonance dominates only at low energies in the strongly ascending part of the total cross section .",
    "thereafter the conventional @xmath6-channel @xmath7 process takes over .    from fig .",
    "3 we see that the maximum cross section for @xmath5 production in the process @xmath61he@xmath4 is about 0.8 @xmath46b .",
    "this is a factor of 300 less than in the basic reaction @xmath62 , but also about a factor of two less than in the process @xmath63he@xmath4 , where there are twice as many combinatoric possibilities to form @xmath5 in the intermediate state .",
    "this result suggests that the @xmath5 production in still heavier nuclei does not just fade away , but rather could give sizable contributions .    in view of the now achieved understanding of the double - pionic fusion it appears historically rather fortunate that more than fifty years ago the berkeley 184-inch synchrocyclotron allowed only a maximum proton beam energy of 743 mev .",
    "that way abashian , booth and crowe were in the position to just enter the energy region , where the @xmath1 low - mass enhancement appears to be largest  and thus discover the abc effect .",
    "would they have had access to a beam energy of 1 gev instead , they would then have observed both a low - mass and a high - mass enhancement  with the latter being the dominant one .",
    "but such a scenario was readily explained later - on by risser and shuster @xcite to originate naturally from the conventional @xmath6-channel @xmath7 process .",
    "would thus the abc puzzle has escaped possibly its detection without providing later on the trace to the discovery to the @xmath5 resonance ?",
    "in conclusion , our data on the double - pionic fusion process to @xmath0he establish the correlation of a resonance - like energy dependence in the total cross section with the abc effect in very much the same way as shown before for the double - pionic fusion reactions to deuterium and @xmath9he . a calculation based on the @xmath5 resonance",
    "gives a good account of the observed distributions .",
    "the enlarged width of the resonance - structure in the total cross section is explained by the fermi motion of the nucleons in initial and final nuclei , which includes also collision damping .    that way the abc effect in the double - pionic fusion to nuclei",
    "is traced back to a @xmath20 resonance , which obviously is strong enough to survive even in the nuclear medium .",
    "it would be very interesting to see , whether also in nuclei heaver than he both abc effect and @xmath5 resonance could be observed .",
    "since the next heavier nuclei are not stable or do not have the proper spin and isospin , the next suitable candidate reaction appears to be @xmath64 or in inverse kinematics @xmath65 .",
    "however , measurements of such reactions necessitate dedicated detector setups and /or accelerators . another great possibility to search for abc effect and @xmath5 resonance",
    "might be given by high - resolution measurements of heavy ion reactions .",
    "a trace that @xmath5 production , indeed , takes place in heavy - ion collisions has recently been found in connection with the so - called dls puzzle , which denotes an unusual enhancement in the @xmath66 production at 0.3  @xmath67 0.7 gev initiated by neutron - proton collisions in vacuum or within heavy - ion systems . in ref .",
    "@xcite it has been shown that a possible solution of this puzzle is presented by accounting for @xmath7 and @xmath5 production .",
    "since a dibaryon resonance has integer spin and thus is of bosonic nature , the survival of such a resonance in a nuclear surrounding may have an important impact on the equation of state .",
    "bosons are not pauli - blocked and as such allow for higher densities under same pressure and energy conditions .",
    "the behavior of matter under extreme conditions is needed , _",
    "e.g. _ , for a better understanding of the evolution of compressed matter in the course of heavy - ion collisions or in compact ( neutron ) stars  see , _",
