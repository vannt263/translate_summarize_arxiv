    "a classic problem of condensed matter physics is that of a finite density of electrons coupled to transverse gauge fields .",
    "as was first noticed by holstein , norton , and pincus ( hnp ) @xcite and elaborated further by reizer @xcite , such a system exhibits anomalous properties , since the transverse component of the gauge field remains unscreened .",
    "while the original motivation of hnp was to understand the effects of the electromagnetic field coupled to a metal , the same field theory applies to the case of fermions coupled to an emergent gauge field , as is the case in certain spin - liquids , and perhaps even the normal state of cuprate superconductors @xcite and compressible quantum hall systems at the filling fraction of @xmath3 .",
    "@xcite as is true for any metal , the system possesses infinitely many gapless excitations ; however the decay rate of these  quasiparticles \" is parametrically larger then their characteristic energy . a largely unsolved issue is whether or not such a non - fermi liquid metal can remain stable against the formation of superconductivity .",
    "while the treatments of hnp @xcite , and reizer @xcite , were based on the random phase approximation ( rpa ) , an analysis based on renormalization group  @xcite treatment in the vicinity of the upper - critical dimension , @xmath4 , suggested that the problem of fermions coupled to transverse gauge bosons leads to a non - fermi liquid fixed point , also found by nayak and wilczek @xcite , who considered a more general expansion in @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the exponent characterizing the range of the four fermion interaction .",
    "the stability of the non - fermi liquid fixed point with respect to competing ordered states , however , remains an outstanding issue .",
    "the issue has also been addressed in the context of color superconductivity   @xcite ; in the simplest case up and down quarks with two different flavors form @xmath7-wave superconductivity whereas the quarks of the third color remain gapless .",
    "here we consider @xmath8 and show that emergent transverse @xmath0 gauge bosons , more appropriate to condensed matter physics , coupled to fermions in a fermi liquid can open up superconducting gap .",
    "once a gap is present , all non - fermi liquid anomalies are cut off and the theory is self consistent .",
    "the quantum phase transition is a continuous transition at a nonzero critical gauge coupling .",
    "this is unlike conventional theory of superconductivity where arbitrarily small attractive coupling leads to superconductivity .",
    "it is also unlike kohn - luttinger superconductivity @xcite where infinitesimally small repulsive coupling leads to superconductivity .",
    "our key results here are twofold .",
    "firstly , the non - fermi liquid metal resulting from coupling a fermi surface to a transverse @xmath0 gauge field remains a stable ground state below a critical threshold gauge coupling ; there is no superconducting instability . above the threshold coupling ,",
    "there are instabilities towards unconventional superconducting states with angular momentum @xmath2 .",
    "our analysis is carried out via a straightforward hatree - fock solution of the self - consistent gap equation .",
    "while it neglects fluctuation effects , it provides a simple qualitative guideline to the possible nature of the ground states , and is likely to remain reliable close to @xmath9 , which is the upper - critical dimension for the problem at hand ; the problem we consider corresponds to @xmath10 .",
    "we also briefly touch upon the case @xmath11 .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we present our system of nonrelativistic fermions at finite - density coupled to a transverse @xmath0 gauge field . in sec .",
    "iii , we derive the hartree - fock superconducting gap equation from the dyson formalism . in sec .",
    "iv we present our numerical solution to the gap equation .",
    "lastly we discuss the implications and the validity of our results . in an appendix we consider a similar treatment at @xmath11 , which we believe is still above the lower critical dimension , and our hartree - fock treatment could still provide a qualitative guide .",
    "we first present our action for the fermions coupled to the transverse gauge bosons at @xmath12 .",
    "our action is wick - rotated at @xmath8 , which gives us the form most convenient for investigating the quantum phase transition from a non - fermi liquid to a superconducting state .",
    "the full action consists of three main terms - the free fermion action denoted by @xmath13 s , the free @xmath0 gauge field , denoted by @xmath14 s , and the fermion - boson coupling ( @xmath15 ) :    @xmath16\\psi({\\bf k},\\omega),\\\\ s_{g}&= & \\int \\frac{d\\omega}{2 \\pi } \\int \\frac{d^3 q}{(2 \\pi)^3}a^{\\dagger}_{i}({\\bf q},\\nu)\\left[q^{2}+\\nu^{2}\\right]\\left(\\delta_{ij}-q_{i}q_{j}/q^{2}\\right)a_{j}({\\bf q},\\nu),\\\\ s_{\\text{int } } & = & \\frac{g}{m } \\int \\frac{d\\omega}{2 \\pi } \\int\\frac{d\\nu}{2 \\pi } \\int \\frac{d^3 p}{(2 \\pi)^3 } \\int \\frac{d^3 k}{(2 \\pi)^3 } \\psi^{\\dagger}({\\bf k},\\nu ) \\lbrace a_{i}({\\bf k}-{\\bf p } , \\nu-\\omega)p_{i } \\rbrace \\ , \\psi({\\bf p},\\omega),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where repeated indices are summed over , @xmath17 is the mass of the fermion , @xmath18 and @xmath19 is the gauge coupling .",
    "we work in the coulomb gauge such that @xmath20 . to simplify notation",
    "we have set @xmath21 and the gauge boson velocity @xmath22 to unity .",
    "we have subsumed all four fermion interactions into @xmath23 in the spirit of landau theory .",
    "the gauge group is assumed to be noncompact , which is not entirely a trivial assumption . in @xmath24-dimensions ,",
    "polyakov  @xcite has shown that the gauge field is massive for the compact case due to instanton effects , at least in the absence of the matter field . in the presence of massless fermions and in @xmath25 dimensions , such topological excitations are assumed not to play any important role .",
    "@xcite    since we are investigating the possibility of superconductivity cutting off the non - fermi liquid behavior , we use for our effective transverse gauge boson mediated interaction the same effective interaction that is known to give rise to the non - fermi liquid behavior in this system @xcite .",
    "it was shown previously that this effective interaction can be obtained simply by taking the one - loop corrected gauge boson propagator as the vertex does not receive any anomalous dimension to one - loop order from the ward identity  @xcite a conclusion that was also reached by polchinski .",
    "@xcite in other words , our problem is to find out whether the interaction mediated by the gauge bosons with the one - loop corrected effective action    @xmath26\\left(\\delta_{ij}-q_{i}q_{j}/q^{2}\\right)a_{j}({\\bf q},\\nu),\\ ] ]    can lead to superconductivity in @xmath25 dimensions .",
    "the corresponding gauge propagator @xmath27 is shown graphically in fig .",
    "[ fig : boson ] .    .",
    "]    where @xmath28 is the fermi velocity , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 is our analog of the fine structure constant ; note that we have dropped the @xmath31 term , keeping only the most relevant low frequency term that arises as the result of the landau damping .",
    "it is important to note that our fine structure constant @xmath32 can be much larger than that of quantum electrodynamics , given that @xmath33 can be much larger than the gauge velocity , set typically by a strongly correlated many body system , and of course @xmath19 itself is not known in general .",
    "our problem is analogous to the kohn - luttinger problem , albeit with some qualifications . to see how this is so ,",
    "note that the transverse gauge bosons mediate current - current interaction .",
    "the bare current - current interaction in the cooper channel is repulsive for the same reason as two parallel wires with anti - parallel currents repel each other .",
    "thus , our problem shares the most essential characteristic of the kohn - luttinger problem - the cooper pairing out of a repulsive bare interaction .",
    "however , whereas in the kohn - luttinger problem the infinitesimal bare interaction is sufficient to destabilize the fermi liquid through cooper pairing , in our problem a finite interaction strength - that is to say , a finite coupling constant - is required for cooper pairing to destabilize the non - fermi liquid @xcite .",
    "this is because the screening of our interaction is dynamical , meaning that we recover the bare interaction in the zero frequency limit .",
    "together with the fact that at the zero frequency limit we will have equally divergent repulsion in all angular momentum channels , this makes the perturbative method used in the kohn - luttinger problem quite unsuitable for our problem .",
    "we obtain the pairing gap self - consistently through dyson formalism , as this technique can be applied straightforwardly to a frequency - dependent interaction @xcite . in this formalism , we treat the pairing gap as the self - energy of the fermion propagator in the nambu basis , as seen in fig .  [",
    "fig : dyson ] .    , we have used the euclidean four vector notation for simplicity . ]    in our dyson equation , @xmath34 the self - energy @xmath35 is due to the gauge boson mediated interaction in the cooper channel @xmath36 ^ 2}{({\\bf k}-{\\bf q})^2}}{({\\bf k}-{\\bf q})^2 + \\gamma \\",
    ", \\frac{|\\omega-\\nu|}{v_f |{\\bf k}-{\\bf q}|}}. \\label{eq : effv1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in order to derive the gap equation from this dyson equation , we note that the self - energy by definition is the difference between the free and interacting propagator : @xmath37 in the nambu basis , the inverse non - interacting fermion propagator is @xmath38 where @xmath39 . due to our assumption that the sole consequence of the interaction is the cooper pairing",
    ", the inverse of the interacting fermion propagator then takes the following form in the nambu basis : @xmath40 then , @xmath41    we can see now that the gap equation can be derived by inserting the above propagators into the dyson equation . on the fermi surface , the gap equation comes out to be @xmath42 where @xmath43 @xmath44 is evaluated on the fermi surface with @xmath45 being the scattering angle : @xmath46 .",
    "our gap equation does not take into account the fermion wave function renormalization factor @xmath47 ; it has also been dropped in refs .   .",
    "the infrared anomaly on the fermi surface @xmath48 , shown previously ,  @xcite is cutoff at the scale of the pairing gap .",
    "thus , setting @xmath49 should not be qualitatively incorrect .",
    "next , we derive the self - consistency condition only with respect to the frequency by integrating out the intermediate momentum @xmath50 and decompose the gap into all angular momentum channels @xmath51 s",
    ". we can transform the integral by introducing the density of states at the fermi energy , @xmath52 ( @xmath53 ) .",
    "we obtain at @xmath8    @xmath54    being a nonlinear integral equation involving the gap , we can not strictly speaking decouple the various angular momentum channels .",
    "however , we shall assume approximate decoupling .",
    "such decoupled gap equations for different channels can be considered as local minima of the free energy .",
    "therefore the self - consistency condition for the pairing gap for each angular momentum @xmath51 is , using the fermi energy , @xmath55 , as the unit energy , @xmath56 where @xmath57 with @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "we see here that @xmath60 can be treated as the dimensionless effective interaction strength .",
    "we plot @xmath61 in fig.[fig : vell ] .     versus @xmath62 for @xmath63 note that the @xmath6-axis is logarithmic in @xmath64 . ]",
    "it does not require us to solve the gap equation to conclude that not only @xmath7-wave but also @xmath65-wave pairing is impossible from our dyson formalism .",
    "as with the conventional bcs self - consistency condition , for an interaction @xmath66 that is always repulsive , our gap equation eq",
    ". does not have a nontrivial solution .",
    "in other words , a non - trivial solution requires @xmath67 in at least some range of frequencies , which , according to fig.[fig : vell ] , is satisfied for @xmath68 etc . ,",
    "but not for @xmath69 . in general , we can derive from eq .",
    "an identical logarithmically divergent repulsion @xmath70 in the low frequency limit for all @xmath51 by making use of the fact that the forward scatter @xmath71 dominates for @xmath72 ( note , however , that this is an integrable singularity ) . on the other hand , in the high frequency limit @xmath73 , the landau damping dominates , hence @xmath74 where @xmath75 .",
    "we find that @xmath76 for all @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath79 s fall off rapidly with @xmath51 .    a representative plot for @xmath66 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : vell ] .",
    "the @xmath7-and @xmath65-wave channels are repulsive at all frequencies , while channels for @xmath77 are repulsive for low frequencies and attractive for higher frequencies .",
    "the crossover frequency @xmath80 for @xmath77 can be fitted to @xmath81 which indicates attractive interaction at higher frequencies for @xmath77 angular momentum channels .",
    "the crossover frequency could be smaller than the frequency scale at which the @xmath47-factor vanishes for the fermions , as in a non - fermi liquid , for which only the one - loop result is available .",
    "@xcite if this is the case , non - fermi liquid effects must be directly included within the dyson formalism , perhaps restricting the validity of the higher angular momentum pairing .",
    "that @xmath65-wave pairing is not possible is in contrast to the @xmath82 result  @xcite derived from the large-@xmath83 approximation .",
    "this is a robust result and does not depend on the landau damping as the source of dynamic screening .",
    "a characteristic of the transverse gauge field , seen from eqs .   and , is that the interaction is always suppressed for backscattering .",
    "this general feature of the transverse gauge field makes it more difficult to obtain attraction in the @xmath65-wave channel ; obtaining attraction in the @xmath65-wave channel out of an interaction that is repulsive for all scattering angles  which is exactly the case in our interaction in eq .",
    " requires the repulsion to be stronger for backscattering than for forward scattering .",
    "moreover , generating attraction in the @xmath65-wave channel through the higher order effects is not really possible in our case , unlike the kohn - luttinger problem .",
    "we note that the physics of the possible pairing in the @xmath77 channels is in some sense inverse of the bcs retardation effect @xcite . in the bcs case",
    ", the repulsion at higher frequency can not break the cooper pairs as long as there is any attraction at the zero frequency .",
    "by contrast , in this problem , @xmath84 for @xmath77 gives us at low frequency a logarithmically divergent repulsion which needs to be overcome by the higher frequency attraction in order for cooper pairing to occur , hence the requirement of the finite coupling constant .",
    "increasing the coupling constant is advantageous for cooper pairing not only because it strengthens the interaction but because , as we can see from eq .",
    ", the attraction occurs at lower frequency .",
    "we expect the @xmath85-wave channel to give us the most robust pairing from fig .",
    "[ fig : vell ] due to a number of different reasons .",
    "first , the @xmath85-wave channel has the strongest attraction in the high frequency limit , as the @xmath86 of eq .",
    "falls off rapidly with @xmath51 for @xmath77 . secondly , when one takes into account the logarithmic scale of the frequency axis of fig .",
    "[ fig : vell ] , we can see that the attractive region gets narrower as @xmath51 increases .",
    "these two factors lead to the frequency integral of @xmath87 decreasing rapidly and monotonically with @xmath51 for @xmath77  a result that is independent of the upper cutoff of the integral , even though the values of these integrals are cutoff dependent .",
    "therefore , in the next section we will present first the numerical solution to the gap equation eq .   for @xmath88 and then consider @xmath89 pairings .",
    "the solution of eq .   yields a non - vanishing gap for @xmath90 . to solve this equation we employed a brute force iterative procedure with a high frequency cutoff @xmath91 , consistent with the validity of the landau damping",
    "this is not always straightforward because roundoff error builds up quickly , but mostly when the gaps are small .",
    "the frequency grid also plays an important role : we have found that number of points @xmath92 is typically sufficient to achieve satisfactory accuracy .",
    "the results for @xmath88 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : gap - freq ] .",
    "the gap at @xmath93 is clearly the excitation gap , which follows from the green function in eq .   despite the wick rotation .",
    "obtaining gaps at real frequencies requires inverse wick rotation .     channel . from top to bottom : @xmath94 . ]",
    "most phase transitions take place at a finite coupling which is nonuniversal .",
    "in fact , the critical coupling typically depends on the ultraviolet cutoff .",
    "a simple example to check is the large-@xmath83 limit for @xmath95 nonlinear sigma model in @xmath12 where the divergence is linear in the ultraviolet cutoff .",
    "@xcite there are some special cases involving lower critical dimensions that are different . in one dimensional classical ising model",
    "the critical point is exactly at @xmath8 , forced to be the case because of the finite temperature fluctuations .",
    "classical @xmath96 sigma model at the lower critical dimension , @xmath82 , behaves similarly as @xmath97 . in these problems fluctuations at the lower critical dimension enforces the value of the critical point .",
    "the pairing gap has a very strong dependence on the imaginary frequency .",
    "the superconducting phase transition , as signified by the vanishing of the @xmath93 gap is a continuous transition . at the edge of the superconducting phase @xmath98 ,",
    "the zero frequency gap vanish , while the finite imaginary frequency the pairing gap remain finite .",
    "we speculate that when analytically continued to real frequencies , there should be fluctuating gaps even when the superconductivity has disappeared . from fig .",
    "[ fig : delta - alpha ] we obtain the following scaling relation for the zero frequency gap in the @xmath88 channel : @xmath99 it is unusual that the critical exponent @xmath100 , which is different from the naive mean field value of @xmath3 .",
    "it appears that the gap equation went beyond the mean - field formalism in the sense that our solution is non - uniform in time .",
    "as noted in the introduction , @xmath101 is cutoff dependent , while neither the gap exponent nor the nature of the quantum phase transition is . for our present choice of the cutoff , @xmath102 .",
    "for the @xmath88 as a function of @xmath103 . ]    previous works @xcite have suggested that this transition is discontinuous based on various approximations to the gap equation .",
    "for example , in an insightful paper , schfer @xcite correctly pointed out that there is no superconductivity for couplings smaller than a critical coupling @xmath104 from an equation , which ignores the vector character of the vertex , the frequency dependence of the gap and assumes that the gap for all angular momentum channels are roughly the same except for @xmath105 .",
    "we have solved this gap equation to find that it leads to a jump in the gap at @xmath104 although the derivative at @xmath106 is singular .",
    "the jump does not imply a first order transition .",
    "there are at least two such examples : jump in the superfluid density in @xmath107 model@xcite and the jump in the magnetization in the @xmath108 inverse square ising model .",
    "@xcite while the conclusion that a critical @xmath104 is necessary for superconductivity , a more rigorous treatment presented here shows a gap collapsing to zero , as discussed above .",
    "we have further solved the gap equation for @xmath109 as well and find that , provided we use the same cutoff @xmath110 , we obtain @xmath111 .",
    "[ fig : delta - alpha - ell ] shows plots of the zero frequency gaps for these channels as function of @xmath60 .",
    "it appears that that the lower bound for @xmath112 ; note that the gap equation gives us the continuous transition in @xmath113 for higher @xmath51 as well .",
    "such a cascade of higher angular momentum gaps with an accumulation point is rather unusual . since our hartree - fock equations do not include fluctuation effects , it is difficult speculate about the fate of the cascade of gaps .",
    "it is not unreasonable to expect , however , that the higher angular momentum gaps will probably be eliminated from a variety of effects not included in our theory , but not @xmath88 .     for the @xmath114 as a function of @xmath103 .",
    "we have shown using the dyson formalism that a landau damped gauge boson in @xmath9 induces superconductivity with higher angular momentum pairing .",
    "no @xmath7-wave and @xmath65-wave solutions are possible , whereas depending on the magnitude of the gauge coupling , superconducting states with @xmath77 do occur .",
    "significantly , all superconducting solutions require a finite interaction strength unlike the kohn - luttinger instability of a fermi liquid , which occurs for an infinitessimal repulsive interaction .",
    "our analysis is self - consistent in @xmath9 , since the fermion - gauge boson coupling is marginal , and also since the superconducting gap preempts the formation of a non - fermi liquid .",
    "the existence of a finite critical coupling is also present in the case of finite - density quarks coupled to a non - abelian gauge field , though the starting action is quite different .",
    "we have also carried out our analysis in the much more controversial case of @xmath11 , and our analysis suggests again that 1 ) superconductivity requires a finite critical interaction , and 2 ) superconducting solutions have @xmath77 .",
    "however , we have not analyzed the chern - simons gauge field ,  @xcite which will be discussed elsewhere .    in this paper , we have concentrated on superconductivity mediated by transverse gauge interactions . in this case",
    "the gauge boson is a distinct emergent field than the fermions to which it couples .",
    "a related class of field theories involve metals in the vicinity of a pomeranchuk instability ( eg . ferromagnetism ) . in this case",
    ", the boson corresponds to a fermion bilinear , and unlike the gauge field , it is generically massive except when tuned to criticality .",
    "while superconducting instabilities in the vicinity of such quantum critical points have been studied extensively in the literature@xcite , many issues remain open .",
    "we have not addressed the issue of the competing orders in this work .",
    "therefore our results do not rule out cooper pairing being pre - empted by density wave ordering in the high-@xmath32 limit .",
    "we plan to investigate this issue through an analogous hartree - fock analysis .",
    "the results of this analysis will be presented elsewhere .",

    "<S> the results are ( i ) the non - fermi liquid is stable against superconductivity below a critical gauge coupling , ( ii ) above this critical coupling , the ground state is an unconventional superconductor with angular momentum @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> our results are obtained from a solution of the dyson - nambu equation . </S>",
    "<S> note that in this problem there is a quantum critical point between a non - fermi liquid state and the superconducting state , as the critical coupling is nonzero . </S>",
    "<S> this is in contrast to a weakly coupled metal , which exhibits superconductivity for infinitesimally weak interaction regardless of its sign . </S>"
