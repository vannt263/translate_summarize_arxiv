    "besides the most known studies of dis at low @xmath1 important measurements of cross  sections of the elastic vector meson production were performed in the experiments h1 and zeus at hera @xcite . as it follows from these data the integral cross section of the elastic vector meson production increases with energy in a way similar to the @xmath2 dependence on @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "it appeared also that the growth of the vector ",
    "meson electroproduction cross ",
    "section with energy is steeper for heavy vector mesons and when the virtuality @xmath4 increases .    in this note",
    "we show that the approach based on the off - shell extension of the @xmath5channel unitarity ( cf . @xcite and references therein ) and its application to the elastic vector meson production in the processes @xmath0 allows in particular to consider mass dependence of these processes .",
    "it appears that the obtained mass and @xmath4 dependencies are in a quantitative agreement with the high  energy hera experimental data .",
    "the extension of the @xmath6matrix unitarization for the off - shell scattering was considered in @xcite .",
    "it was supposed that the virtual photon fluctuates into a quark ",
    "antiquark pair @xmath7 and this pair can be treated as an effective virtual vector meson state in the processes with small bjorken @xmath1 .",
    "there were considered limitations the unitarity provides for the @xmath8total cross - sections and geometrical effects in the energy dependence of @xmath9 . in particular , it was shown that an assumption of the @xmath4dependent constituent quark interaction radius leads to the following asymptotical dependence : @xmath10 , where @xmath11 will be saturated at large values of @xmath4 .",
    "this result is valid when the interaction radius of the virtual constituent quark is rising with virtuality @xmath4 .",
    "the form corresponding to the virtual constituent quark interaction radius was chosen as following @xmath12 thus , the dependence on virtuality @xmath4 comes through the dependence of the intensity of the virtual constituent quark interaction @xmath13 and the @xmath14 , which determines the quark interaction radius ( in the on - shell limit @xmath15 and @xmath16 ) .",
    "the reason for the rising interaction radius of the virtual constituent quark with virtuality @xmath4 might be of a dynamical nature and it could originate from the emission of the additional @xmath17pairs in the nonperturbative structure of a constituent quark . in this approach constituent quark consists of a current quark and the cloud of quark  antiquark pairs of the different flavors @xcite .",
    "available experimental data are consistent with the @xmath18dependence of the radius of this cloud .",
    "the introduction of the @xmath4 dependence into the interaction radius of a constituent quark which in this approach consists of a current quark and the cloud of quark  antiquark pairs of the different flavors is the main issue of the off ",
    "shell extension of the model , which provides at large values of @xmath3 @xmath19 where @xmath20 the value and @xmath4 dependence of the exponent @xmath11 is related to the interaction radius of the virtual constituent quark .",
    "the value of parameter @xmath21 in the model is determined by the slope of the differential cross ",
    "section of elastic scattering at large @xmath22 @xcite and from the @xmath23-experimental data it follows that @xmath24 . from the data for @xmath11 obtained at hera the `` experimental '' @xmath4dependence of the function @xmath14 has been calculated @xcite : @xmath25 the rise of the function @xmath14 is slow and consistent with @xmath18 extrapolation : @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 gev@xmath29 .",

    "a quantitative agreement with the high  energy hera experimental data on elastic vector  meson electroproduction is in favor of relation ( [ lavm ] ) which provides explicit mass dependence of the exponent in the power  like energy dependence of cross  sections .",
