    "a more physical parametrization is contained in two types of information : + ( 1 ) because of the undriven character of the environment , we expect that the effective biasing field on the particle is essentially still given by @xmath0 . from the hypothesis of local detailed balance @xcite we would then get _ e = [ eq : b_eff ] where it",

    "there is another ` charged ' or ` probe ' particle in the system which is driven by an ` electric ' field @xmath0 pointing in the @xmath53 direction .",
    "consequently this charged particle performs a biased random walk in the @xmath54-direction  it moves to the right ( left ) with rate @xmath55 while the motion along the @xmath56-direction is symmetric  the rates of moving up and moving down are equal to @xmath57 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : model ] ) .",
    "we assume local detailed balance @xcite so that @xmath58 the charged particle interacts with the sea particles via exclusion  it can move only when the target site is empty ; the sea particles act as ` obstacles ' for the charged one .",

    "a discrete time version of the model is studied in @xcite ; here we work in continuous time where the jumps have rates which follow the condition of local detailed balance @xcite .",
    "the local detailed balance condition does not specify the rates completely however ; we choose [ eq : cho ] p = e^e/2e^ e/2+e^- e/2 , q = e^- e/2e^ e/2+e^- e/2 so that in the absence of obstacles the escape rate in the horizontal direction is @xmath59 in that way , we do not impose by hand a specific change in escape rate for varying field @xmath0 at zero obstacle density ( free motion ) . note that @xmath60 for large @xmath0 . +",
    "to numerically simulate this system , we use a _ random sequential _ updating scheme .",
    "first a site is selected randomly - if it is occupied by the probe particle or a sea particle then it attempts to jump to one of the four neighbouring sites with corresponding rates , the attempt being successful only when the target site is empty . on the other hand",
    "if the selected site is vacant then nothing is done . in this scheme each update , whether successful or not , corresponds to an increase in time @xmath61 + let @xmath62 denote the net number of steps per unit time that the charged particle makes in the @xmath53-direction .",
    "an expression for the average speed @xmath63 can be obtained from the dynamical updating rules .",
    "let us denote the instantaneous position of the charged particle by @xmath64 also let @xmath65 denote the occupation number for the sea particles , @xmath66 , @xmath67 depending on whether site @xmath68 is occupied by a sea particle or not .",
