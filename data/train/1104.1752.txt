    "<S> the open system inevitably encounters decoherence which renders a quantum superposition state to decay into a classical , statistical mixture of states . </S>",
    "<S> thus , derivation of the reduced density matrix is a central goal in order to describe its evolution . </S>",
    "<S> based on weak coupling assumption , a markovian master equation could give its dynamics . </S>",

    "<S> the dynamics of entanglement entropy displays extremely non - markovian features . </S>",
    "<S> figure 2 shows @xmath122 for different couplings with @xmath123 . </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath124 , the entropy increases non - monotonically from zero to a finite value ( @xmath114 ) with explicit oscillations , and would not come close to saturation in the short - time interval which means that quantum coherence is not directly destroyed by the bath . at the same time </S>",
    "<S> , the envelope of entropy exhibits a hump characterizing short - time memory of bath . on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> , the oscillation - hump feature demonstrates that the process of entropy exchange is bidirectional . to better understand the nature of the oscillation - hump feature and the large contribution from quantum fluctuations </S>",
    "<S> , we should consider the elements of the reduced density matrix . @xmath98 and @xmath74 exhibit oscillations which represent coherence . </S>",
    "<S> so , the dominant contribution to the oscillatory signal comes from @xmath125 , while the trend of entropy evolution ascribes to @xmath101 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the oscillation of entropy shows the coherent evolution in coherent regime .    as coupling increases , </S>",
    "<S> oscillations become obviously weaker with small amplitudes and the envelop of entropy rises rapidly with small hump(to see fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2b ) due to the effects of strong dissipation . near the crossover from coherent to </S>",
    "<S> incoherent regime @xmath126 , entropy shape displays faster rising behaviors without oscillation and the hump disappears , which is an important character corresponding to the coherent - incoherent crossover . note that @xmath114 is analytic and continuous at @xmath127 because no phase transition happens at this point while the dynamical crossover from damped oscillatory to pure decaying behaviors takes place . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we can not extract a distinguishable feature of this crossover from @xmath114 because of its character of thermodynamical equilibrium even if @xmath128 @xmath114 is near to its saturation . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , only transitory dynamics of entropy could give the indicator of the crossover even though @xmath114 might also be regarded as an interesting order parameter to mark quantum phase transitions .    </S>",
    "<S> the evolution of entanglement entropy is very different from that of markovian approximation . </S>",
    "<S> the dynamics of @xmath122 is shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3a with several tunnelings for @xmath129 as well as the corresponding markovian results . in the markovian evolution , </S>",
    "<S> the system undergoes a smooth and fast relaxation to its final statistical mixture . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that there is no short - time oscillations in the markovian evolution . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the transient oscillatory behaviors of entropy dynamics can not be correctly described by the markovian approximation . nevertheless , </S>",
    "<S> in the long - time limit , markovian results are consistent with @xmath114 as expected . </S>",
    "<S> the oscillation of the entropy is a hallmark of non - markovian dynamics in the coherent regime which is unexpected in the markovian dynamics . from the scaled entropy @xmath130 in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3b , one can see that the entropy displays almost synchronously with different amplitudes of oscillations for any tunneling and eventually goes wiggly down to @xmath114 . </S>",
    "<S> it indicates that the system exchanges entropy frequently with its environment in the short time . in this case , the oscillations are more pronounced for the enhancement of coherence involved transition between two states . from another point of view , the ability of exchanging information becomes strong for the system with increasing tunneling and it remains coherence for a longer time . </S>",
    "<S> ( note that the unit of time is @xmath131 , which becomes explicitly larger with increasing tunneling . )    in the coherent regime , a sufficient number of quantum manipulations can be performed within the coherent time . </S>",
    "<S> the need to maintain quantum coherence during the operation is especially difficult to achieve in solid state systems such as quantum dots which couple relatively strongly to uncontrollable environmental degrees of freedom , leading to decoherence . only in the underdamping regime </S>",
    "<S> , the quantum control has more efficiency . the promising experimental proposal that entanglement entropy can be measured in cooper pair box or quantum dot scheme </S>",
    "<S> is suggested by kopp and hur recently@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we really expect that experimental setup is capable of testing our predictions and such measurements would provide a proof of the existence of oscillations in the entropy evolution although it is not easy to probe small signals in the background of noises and thermal fluctuations </S>",
