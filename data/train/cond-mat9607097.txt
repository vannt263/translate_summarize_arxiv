    "a sandpile is normally constructed by pouring sand from a stationary point source , as shown in fig.1(a ) .",
    "each element of sand arrives at the apex of the pile , rolls down the slopes , comes to rest , and is finally buried .",
    "the final ( static ) sandpile then consists of a symmetrical cone whose surface is at the angle of repose of the material .",
    "some of the simplest questions one can ask about this system concern the distribution of stresses in the pile . specifically , it is possible experimentally to measure the downward force on the supporting surface at different positions under the pile @xcite .",
    "( throughout the paper we assume this to be a high friction surface so that slip does not occur at it . )",
    "intuitively one can guess that the maximum force would be recorded directly beneath the apex of the pile ; but in fact , the experiments show a pronounced _ dip _ in the force beneath the apex . this counterintuitive result has stimulated various theoretical @xcite and computational @xcite studies ; but so far , there has been no clear consensus on the origin of the dip .    in the present work we pursue a continuum mechanics approach based on the equations of stress continuity in a cohesionless granular medium @xcite .",
    "this approach immediately encounters the problem of _ indeterminacy _ : even in the simplest case of a two - dimensional pile ( which we consider in detail ) , the continuity of stress does not lead to a closed set of equations . in elastic materials",
    ", this deficiency would be rectified by invoking the usual _ constitutive relation _ between stress and strain ( hooke s law ) . for granular media",
    ", however , there is no clear definition of  strain \" .",
    "rather , it is widely assumed that the physics of granular media can be understood purely in terms of rigid particles packed together in frictional contact ( so that no strain variables can be defined ) .",
    "the indeterminacy of the stress equations then has a clear origin : for two rigid particles in frictional contact with a specified normal force , the coefficient of static friction defines only the _ maximum _ shear force that may be present .",
    "our continuum mechanics approach , like some previous ones @xcite assumes that , despite this local indeterminacy , there emerges on length scales much larger than the grain size some definite relation between the _ average _ frictional and normal forces .",
    "thus we assume the existence of one or more constitutive relations , not between stress and strain , but among the various components of the stress tensor itself . in two dimensions ,",
    "one such relation is enough to close the equations ; in three dimensions ( subject to certain symmetry assumptions ) two are needed .",
    "a basic tenet of our approach is that the constitutive relations are _ local _ : we assume that that these relations between stresses do not depend on distant perturbations , although the stresses themselves certainly do .",
    "clearly , the constitutive relation ( or relations  we suppress the plural in what follows ) , between stresses in some material element , must reflect the packing arrangement of grains in that element .",
    "this raises the possibility that the constitutive behaviour could vary from place to place in the pile .",
    "more generally , we believe that in principle the constitutive relation of a given material element should encode its entire _ construction history_. we shall assume , however , that the important part of this history comes to an end at the moment where the element is buried : at later times , although the stresses passing through the element may vary , the constitutive relation between them can not .",
    "we call this the assumption of _ perfect memory_. we show below ( sec .",
    "2.3 ) that the perfect memory and locality assumptions , when combined with a simple and experimentally motivated scaling assumption ( called rsf scaling ) , drastically limit the form the constitutive equation can take .",
    "a consequence of perfect memory is that the stresses in an element , once buried , respond reversibly ( though not necessarily linearly ) to any subsequent additional loading .",
    "such loadings can be brought about either by adding more material to the pile , or by putting a small weight on its surface , for example .",
    "obviously our perfect memory assumption , and indeed that of locality , may fail if the load added is so large as to lead to rearrangement of grains within the element ( that is , slip ) . > from our viewpoint",
    ", however , if slip does occur , this represents a change in construction history which must explicitly be taken into account .",
    "it turns out that for most of the models and geometries considered in this paper , perturbative loadings of the pile do not , in fact , cause slip except at the surface of the pile .",
    "our assumption of a local , history - dependent constitutive relation among stresses is not widely accepted as a modelling strategy for sandpiles .",
    "( indeed , we have not seen any really clear exposition of this strategy in the previous literature . )",
    "many would argue the necessity of explicitly invoking the deformability of particles ( allowing a strain variable to enter ) ; others would argue that infinitesimal distant loads should cause rearrangement of a network of contacts among hard particles ( leading to intrinsically nonlocal stress propagation ) .",
    "this paper aims to explore in detail the kinds of prediction that can be made within our overall modelling strategy , and to introduce some physically plausible candidates for constitutive relations .",
    "much existing work on the static continuum mechanics of cohensionless granular materials has invoked , as an implicit constitutive relation , the assumption of _ incipient failure everywhere _ ( ife ) . that this is indeed an assumption ,",
    "is not always made clear in the engineering literature @xcite .",
    "the ife model supposes that the material is everywhere just on the point of slip failure : all frictional forces are `` fully mobilized '' .",
    "thus an appropriately chosen ( local ) _ yield criterion _ @xcite of the material provides the missing constitutive equation .",
    "the physics of this assumption is dubious . when a pile is made from a point source ( fig.1(a ) )",
    "there is a continuous series of landslides at the surface ; we therefore accept that an incipient failure condition is maintained _ at the surface_. even in saying this , we ignore the distinction between the angle of repose ( that of the free surface just after a landslide ) and the maximum angle of stability ( that just before ) .",
    "these differ by the bagnold hysteresis angle , which is small compared to the repose angle itself @xcite ; we neglect this hysteresis effect from now on .",
    "however , the validity of the incipient failure condition at the surface , which contains material elements just at the point of burial , does not mean that the same condition still holds for an element long afterwards .",
    "such an element lies deep beneath the surface , and has since burial been loaded by adding more material to the pile above .",
    "in fact , the ife assumption can clearly be ruled out on experimental grounds : as we show below , it fails to account for the dip .",
    "the ife closure implies that two of the _ principal stresses _ are proportional @xcite . in contrast , proportionality of the _ horizontal and vertical normal stresses _ was proposed as a constitutive relation recently by bouchaud , cates and claudin @xcite ( we refer to this closure as the bcc model ) . in two dimensions",
    "it was found that the stress continuity equation then has a convenient analytic property : it becomes a wave equation .",
    "however @xcite , the bcc model predicts a stress plateau , rather than a dip , at the centre of a sandpile .",
    "attempts to explain the dip by introducing various nonlinear terms in the constitutive relation proved unconvincing , at least for small nonlinearities , whose perturbative inclusion showed a _ hump _ instead of a dip . the bcc paper ( sec.3.2 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) in fact included a brief discussion of certain strongly nonlinear models @xcite , which were also argued to give a hump .",
    "this conclusion turns out to be incorrect , for subtle reasons that we discuss below ( sec .",
    "2.9 ) . in one sense",
    ", the  oriented stress linearity \" ( osl ) model , which we study in detail in this paper , can be viewed as an extreme limit of this type of model .",
    "the osl model , like bcc , has a _ linear relation between normal stresses _ but now in a coordinate system that is tilted ( through a constant angle ) with respect to the vertical .",
    "an apparently completely different approach to describing the stress distribution in sandpiles was proposed by edwards and oakeshott @xcite .",
    "these authors considered a pile consisting of a stack of nested _ arches _ , fig.1(b ) .",
    "( a recent modification considers a model of platelike granules and allows curvature of the arches @xcite ) .",
    "each arch supports only its own weight , and consequently the vertical stress decreases for the smaller arches near the centre of the pile .",
    "this approach provides a very appealing physical picture of why there is a dip . in the arching mechanism ,",
    "the load in an element is transmitted unevenly to those below .",
    "the central part of the pile is thereby  screened \" from additional loadings which are supported instead by the outer regions",
    ".    however , there are some obvious drawbacks with this approach .",
    "firstly , the dip is greatly _ overpredicted _ : by construction there is no downward force whatever at the centre of the pile , while experiments show a finite value . secondly , unless the arches are parallel to the free surface , the outermost ",
    "arches \" are incomplete .",
    "it is mechanically impossible for one of these to transmit its weight purely along its own length : there is an unbalanced couple about the base of such an arch which would cause it to fall over .",
    "if , instead , the arches are parallel to the free surface then the model is stable , but it predicts an abrupt discontinuity in the downward force at the edge of the pile , which is not observed .",
    "these difficulties arise , at least in part , from an inconsistent attempt to treat the vertical normal stress (  weight \" ) independently of the other stress components .",
    "this is rectified in the osl models introduced below . among these",
    "is a special case , the ",
    "fixed principal axes \" ( fpa ) model , which is very close in its physical content to the picture of nested arches originally suggested by edwards and oakeshott . as its name suggests , in the fpa model",
    ", the principal axes of the stress tensor have a constant angle of inclination to the vertical .",
    "these axes turn out to coincide with the stress - propagation characteristics , which resemble a set of edwards arches ( sec .",
    "in fact , we believe that our fpa model gives , for the first time , a fully consistent continuum mechanics implementation of edwards arching picture . as shown in sec . 3 , this model gives good agreement with experimental data in three - dimensional sandpiles .",
    "the discussion above ( like others in the recent physics literature on sandpiles ) attributes the idea of arching to edwards and oakeshott @xcite .",
    "however , the same basic picture has a longer pedigree in the rock mechanics literature , and can be traced at least as far back as the pioneering work of trollope in the 1950 s @xcite .",
    "( the latter is very clearly reviewed in @xcite . ) something very like the edwards - oakeshott model is called by trollope the  full arching limit \" and something very like the bcc model turns out to be the  no arching limit \" of trollope s theory ( although his predictions based on the latter do not take proper account of the coulomb yield criterion , as was done by bcc ) .",
    "trollope also developed a ",
    "systematic arching theory \" to provide an interpolation between these two limits .",
    "this model , though it does not provide a systematic theory of arching , is quite interesting , and we discuss it in more detail in section 2.10 .",
    "it is based on quite different physical principles from our own work , partly because trollope attributed the arching phenomenon to _ small displacements of the supporting surface _ under a wedge .",
    "this idea , based on trollope s own experiments ( on wedges whose construction history we have been unable to find out ) is clearly at odds with our own explanation , and appears to be contradicted by the more recent experimental data on sandpiles constructed from a point source @xcite .",
    "other approaches to the problem of stress propagation in static sandpiles include particle packing models @xcite , where one considers a regular packing of ( usually spherical ) grains , with simple transmission laws for the downward force between one layer of particles and those below .",
    "these models show a flat stress plateau in two dimensions , a feature shared with bcc @xcite which can be viewed as a ( slightly generalized ) continuum limit of such models . an important and related class of discrete models address the propagation of _ noise effects _ in sandpiles ; in these the transmission of forces between particles is stochastic @xcite .",
    "the relation between these models and our own ( noise - free ) continuum approach will be explored in detail elsewhere @xcite .",
    "more elaborate discrete models are increasingly being studied . that examined numerically by bagster and kirk",
    "@xcite invokes nontrivial force propagation rules locally , and for some parameter ranges shows a dip in the stress .",
    "however , it is not clear whether the physics included in this model is that of real sandpiles ; and so far , the relation to any continuum description is uncertain .",
    "a widespread numerical approach is that of discrete element modelling @xcite ; however , as discussed by buchholtz and poeschel @xcite , many such methods can not so far even reproduce the fact that the repose angle of a pile is independent of its size .",
    "various improved algorithms have been suggested @xcite ; we do not know whether the same is true for these . in a future paper @xcite we will present results from a simulation approach involving nominally frictionless , but",
    "nonspherical , slightly deformable particles , following ref.@xcite .",
    "these offer some promise of confirming , or at least testing , the ideas put forward in the present work .    the model of liffman _",
    "@xcite invokes a more specific mechanism , based on size - segregation , to explain the dip in the stress .",
    "when confronted with the experimental data @xcite one sees a serious drawback of this explanation : the data show a scaling behaviour which the model can not support .",
    "the observed scaling ( called rsf scaling , see sec . 2.3 below ) indicates that there is _ no characteristic length - scale _ intrinsic to the granular medium of which a pile is made .",
    "in general , segregation effects introduce such a scale by setting up gradients in the material properties of the pile @xcite , and hence violate the observed scaling .",
    "it is notable that a finite deformability of the particles would also introduce a characteristic length , and is therefore also ruled out by rsf scaling ( we discuss this further in sec . 2.3 ) .",
    "the ife model , defined above , represents one limiting case of a more general group of elasto - plastic continuum theories ; some of these are highly developed and widely used within a finite element framework ( though usually in the context of hoppers rather than sandpiles ) @xcite .",
    "the physical basis of these models for dry cohesionless granular media is not always clear ( many are based on models developed earlier for wet soil @xcite ) . in any case , to whatever extent elasticity is invoked , such models are again in violation of rsf scaling .",
    "the idea that the properties of a granular medium depend on its construction history is central to our work .",
    "this concept is not new , and plays a strong role in the recent experimental literature on granular media in hoppers ( for example the exit flow from a hopper depends on how it was filled ) @xcite . indeed , this is part of the reason why standardized shear and triaxial tests are used to measure the internal friction coefficient of a granular medium ; the repose angle , which in the simplest theories is completely equivalent @xcite , in reality depends appreciably on construction history , as do other mechanical properties @xcite ( this is discussed further in section 4 ) .",
    "moreover , it has long been argued that the manner in which the construction history enters is via the local packing geometry of the grains .",
    "this forms part of the idea of  granular fabric \" , in which one constructs a local tensor that parameterizes the distribution of particle - particle contacts @xcite .",
    "the concept of the fabric tensor has usually been developed in an elasticity context , rather than one in which constitutive relations directly among stresses are assumed .",
    "nonetheless , the orientational memory effects embodied in the new models described below can certainly be viewed in terms of a local tensorial property of the medium ( see sec .",
    ". however , no specific interpretation of this quantity ( in terms of the contact distribution ) appears to be required .      in section [ sec2d ]",
    "we give a coarse - grained continuum description of the two - dimensional symmetrical sandpile . instead of assuming in advance a particular constitutive relation , we first approach the problem systematically by exploiting the implications of symmetry , and of the boundary condition of incipient failure at the free surface ( ifs ) .",
    "we discuss , with reference to the construction history of the pile , the scaling ansatz of a _ radial stress field _",
    "this ansatz transforms the partial differential equations into ordinary differential equations , which can be solved easily for all the closures considered later . using this , and the idea of _ perfect memory _",
    "mentioned above , the range of possible constitutive relations is greatly reduced .    after this",
    ", we will solve our equations for four specific closures in two dimensions ; these are incipient failure everywhere ( ife ) , bouchaud - cates - claudin ( bcc ) , fixed principal axes ( fpa ) , and finally the family of oriented stress - linearity ( osl ) closures , which includes bcc and fpa as special cases .",
    "all of these comply with our modelling strategy of seeking local constitutive relations among stress components . for the osl model ,",
    "stresses propagate along straight characteristics which can be interpreted by analogy with wave propagation along  light - rays \" .",
    "we thereby arrive at a very simple geometrical picture of stress propagation , from which the forms of the stress profiles can be swiftly deduced . for the osl model ,",
    "the effect of a small perturbation ( adding a little extra weight somewhere ) is studied , and an appropriate green function described .",
    "this helps sharpen the idea of stress being carried along arches .    in section [ sec3d ]",
    "we extend our calculations to the three dimensional conical sandpile . because of the larger number of stress components ( some of which can be eliminated by symmetry ) a second constitutive equation is now required .",
    "we study several possible choices for this secondary closure , and find that all of these lead to qualitatively similar stress profiles . a comparison with the experimental results of smid and novosad @xcite",
    "is then made .",
    "this shows , firstly , that the rsf scaling assumption is well - verified , and , secondly , that the data is fit rather well by the fpa model , without adjustable parameters .",
    "viewed alternatively as a comparison with the osl model , which does have an adjustable parameter ( the tilt angle ) , the evidence suggests that parameter values close to the fpa case must be chosen .",
    "the data thereby presents strong evidence for the arching picture as an explanation of the dip .    until the end of section 3",
    ", we will have considered only the case where the free surface of the pile is at the angle of repose .",
    "however , it is possible experimentally to achieve piles which are flatter than this .",
    "we discuss this and a number of related problems in section 4 , where , for simplicity , we restrict attention to the fpa model in two dimensions . we show that it matters how a sandpile is made : for example , if a flattened pile is created by slicing wedges off the top of a steeper one , the stresses should differ from those found by choosing a material with a lower repose angle to begin with .",
    "it is in geometries such as this , that the dependence of the constitutive equation on the construction history of the pile can be probed .",
    "section 5 contains a brief summary of our approach and a concluding discussion .",
    "our calculations for the stress propagation in two - dimensional sandpiles , using the osl and fpa models , are new ; as are our three dimensional results for these models , and for bcc , although some of the fpa results were outlined elsewhere @xcite . for the ife model , which is more classical , the corresponding results may exist in the literature ( though we have not found them ) ; in any case we include them for comparison .",
    "as mentioned previously , the continuum approach to calculating the stress distribution in a static sandpile immediately encounters an indeterminacy .",
    "indeed , the stress continuity equation in two dimensions reads ( componentwise ) @xmath0 which , clearly , provides only two relations between the three independent elements of the stress tensor ,  and @xmath1 .    to ease the later generalization to three dimensions ( section 3 ) we here use cylindrical polar coordinates , with",
    "@xmath2 measured _ downward _ from the apex of the pile and @xmath3 a radial coordinate from the symmetry axis ",
    "see fig.1(c ) .",
    "( in two dimensions , @xmath4 , with @xmath5 a cartesian coordinate . )",
    "we have assumed that the granular medium has _ constant density _ , @xmath6 , thereby excluding segregation effects ( see section 1.2 above ) , and have chosen units where @xmath7 .",
    "the acceleration due to gravity is denoted @xmath8 ; because it enters linearly , this could also be set to unity , but we retain it for clarity .",
    "the stress tensor @xmath9 is defined to be symmetric in @xmath10 , as usual in the physics literature .    in our cylindrical polar",
    "coordinate system the stress tensor is a function of @xmath2 and @xmath3 , where @xmath11 by definition .",
    "however , in terms of cartesians @xmath12 , one would have both positive and negative @xmath5 ; in this case , the normal stresses would be even functions of @xmath5 and the shear stress an odd function @xcite .",
    "( the latter holds because the unit vector along @xmath3 reverses sign at the symmetry axis . )",
    "confusion can be reduced by restricting attention to the left half of the pile ( positive @xmath5 ) for which the two coordinate systems coincide . in any case , on the symmetry axis itself ( @xmath13 ) , the shear stress must vanish by symmetry , and the @xmath2 and @xmath3 directions are both principal axes there .    as well as the three stress components ,  and  , it will be useful to consider the following three quantities : the average stress @xmath14 , the `` radius of mohr s circle ''",
    "@xmath15 defined via @xmath16 @xcite , and the ( positive ) angle of inclination @xmath17 between the @xmath2-axis to the major principal axis of the stress tensor ( see fig.1(c ) ) . in terms of these , @xmath18 following the usage of the engineering literature @xcite we define a material point to be in an _ active _ state if the normal stress  in the direction of the external compressive force ( here gravity ) is larger that the stress   perpendicular to it . on the symmetry axis ( @xmath13 ) , the @xmath2-axis is the major principle axis and @xmath19 in the case of an active state , whereas for a passive state the major axis is @xmath3 , and @xmath20 .",
    "the simplest model of a granular medium is known as the _ ideal cohesionless coulomb material_. the coulomb model plays the same role in the study of granular materials as the newtonian fluid does in viscous flow , and we will use it here .",
    "plastic failure occurs in a given material element if there exist a plane defined by a unit normal @xmath21 ( or angle of inclination @xmath22 ) ) through this element , on which the shear forces  exceeds a given fraction of the normal force across the plane @xcite .",
    "conversely the element is stable if , for all such planes , @xmath23 for a material with _ cohesion _ , a constant @xmath24 is added to the right hand side ; we treat only the cohesionless case .",
    "the coulomb yield criterion can then alternatively be expressed as @xmath25 ( put differently , ",
    "the yield locus must not cut mohr s circle \" @xcite . )",
    "the coefficient @xmath26 in eqn.([eqcoulomb1 ] ) is the coefficient of static friction of the material ; elementary arguments show that @xmath27 is then the angle of repose @xcite ( defined , as usual , as the inclination of the free surface to the horizontal ; see fig.1(c ) ) .",
    "we now use the yield criterion to specify the stresses on the surface of the pile . in doing this",
    ", we neglect the small bagnold hysteresis angle ( as mentioned in sec .",
    "1.1 ) and demand that the surface of a pile , constructed from a point source and at its angle of repose , is in a state of incipient slip .",
    "( sandpiles constructed differently , for which this is not the case , are considered in section 4 ) .",
    "first we note that ( in two dimensions ) all stress components have to vanish on the surface : @xmath28 here we have introduced , for reasons that will be clarified later , a scaling variable @xmath29 with @xmath30 .",
    "( hence the equation of the free surface is @xmath31 , or @xmath32 . )",
    "the vanishing of the stresses is a direct consequence of the yield criterion , as we now show by considering the stress components in a rotated coordinate system @xmath33 ( see  fig.1(c ) ) . for a system inclined at angle @xmath34 to the vertical",
    ", one has @xmath35 now choosing @xmath36 , so that @xmath37 is normal to the surface , we require that the normal stress  at the free surface has to vanish ( this assumes that no external forces act there ) . the yield criterion eqn .",
    "( [ eqcoulomb2 ] ) then requires @xmath38 accordingly , the remaining two stress components  and  must also vanish , and the stress tensor is zero in the @xmath33 , and hence in the @xmath39 , coordinate system .",
    "the criterion that the surface of the pile is a slip plane , not only implies that the stresses on the surface vanish , but also fixes their ratios in its immediate neighbourhood . demanding equality in eqn .",

    "( [ eqrot ] ) these can be written in the @xmath39-system as @xmath42 ( the results in @xmath43 and in @xmath39 coordinates look rather similar because , as it turns out , the two frames are related by a reflection through the major principal axis @xcite . )",
    "the requirements expressed by equations ( [ eqby1 ] , [ barmy ] ) , represent a set of  boundary conditions \" which we denote ifs ( incipient failure at the surface ) . along with the stress continuity equation , these form the boundary value problem for determining the stress profile of a sandpile . at first sight",
    "there may appear to be more boundary conditions than required ; however ( as emphasised before ) to close the problem in two dimensions , we will need a constitutive relation between stress components , which is yet to be chosen .",
    "one can therefore view any extra  boundary conditions \" as constraints limiting this choice .",
    "we next develop some general scaling arguments which , combined with some other physically motivated simplifications , further restrict the choice of constitutive equation .",
    "the basis of our scaling approach is to assume that the macroscopic material properties of a granular medium ( under gravity ) are independent of length scale .",
    "obviously , any such medium has a characteristic length associated with the grain size , but in a continuum description this should not be important .",
    "the scaling hypothesis supposes that not only this length , but also any other characteristic length - scale that the medium possesses , is either extremely small , or else extremely large , compared to the scales probed in a macroscopic sandpile experiment .",
    "as mentioned previously , and shown below , our scaling assumption is well - verified in the experiments of ref.@xcite . however , those experiments are on piles of a limited size range ( 20 to 60 cm high ) .",
    "it is possible that for smaller or larger piles our scaling assumptions would break down , due to a characteristic length arising from size segregation @xcite , for example .",
    "a corollary of our scaling assumption is that no relevant intrinsic scale exists for stresses : otherwise , this scale could be compared with the gravitational stress to give a length . thus we exclude , for example , deformable particles whose elastic modulus sets a stress scale , and thereby a  deformation length \" ( which for rigid particles is infinite ) . these simpifications , though guided by experiment , are not physically obvious _ a priori _ ; the problem deserves more careful experimental study to determine the limits to the scaling regime for real granular materials .    assuming that the medium indeed has no intrinsic characteristic length",
    ", the stress distributions in all piles formed the same way ( of the same material ) should be similar .",
    "hence we search for a scaling solution of eqn .",
    "( [ eqpde ] ) of the form : @xmath44 with the scaling variable @xmath45 was introduced previously . in anticipation of this ansatz",
    ", our earlier discussion of the boundary conditions was couched in terms of @xmath46 .",

    "the functions @xmath48 have to be continuous everywhere ; however , we are dealing with hyperbolic equations , and the stresses need not be differentiable @xcite .",

    "we now ask , what are reasonable closure relations consistent with the radial stress field form of eqn .",
    "( [ eqonlyh ] ) ?",
    "on physical grounds we first impose the requirement of _ locality _ : the unknown stress component in a material element depends on the known ones in that element , and not elsewhere .",
    "( as mentioned previously , this would fail if distant loads were able to rearrange the grains themselves in a given neighbourhood . )",
    "the most general form consistent with our scaling ansatz is then @xmath54 where the absence of an intrinsic stress scale , noted above , means that only dimensionless ratios of stresses can enter .    to restrict  further",
    ", we now invoke the assumption of _ perfect memory _ mentioned in the introduction : that the constitutive relation in a material element is determined at the time of its burial and is not subsequently altered .",
    "now , it is clear that each material element is buried while just at the surface of the pile ( @xmath32 ) , after which it experiences continually decreasing values of @xmath46 as the pile gets larger .",
    "hence any explicit dependence of  on @xmath46 would violate the perfect memory assumption .",

    "the centreline divides grains which have rolled to the left from those which have rolled to the right , and which therefore have had qualitatively different histories @xcite .",
    "accordingly , there is no requirement that   behave smoothly at the origin ; and although the constitutive models studied below all appear analytic when expressed in polar ( @xmath58 ) coordinates , for some of them  does become singular on the symmetry axis , when a cartesian ( @xmath59 ) coordinate system is employed .",

    "however , with the exception of those lying right on the symmetry axis , all such elements were first buried at the surface of the pile ( @xmath32 ) .",

    "one finds for @xmath132 a piecewise linear function , with inner and outer regions .",
    "the material in the outer region again saturates the yield criterion ( [ eqcoulomb3 ] ) whereas the inner part does not ; these regions are separated by a cusp at @xmath133 . for the fpa model",
    ", there is always a dip in @xmath94 at the centre of the pile .",
    "the dip takes the form of a cusp at @xmath57 and is connected with the nonanalyticity of @xmath134 , which reflects the sudden change in the direction of the major principal axis on passing through the central axis of the pile . the maximum vertical stress ( at @xmath105 )",
    "is a factor @xmath135 times larger than the value at @xmath57 ( the latter is always finite ) .",
    "these results are compared with the bcc and ife models in fig.2(a - c ) .    at first sight",
    "the requirement of fixed orientation of the stress tensor ( @xmath136 ) is at odds with the fact that , on the centre line of the pile , there are no shear stresses and so the horizontal and vertical directions must be principal axes ( @xmath19 )",
    ". this paradox can be resolved by noting that on the centre line the stress in the fpa model is actually isotropic , thus satisfying both criteria at once .",
    "the correspondence between the fpa model and the edwards arching picture becomes clearer on considering the characteristics of the wave equation , ( [ fpawave ] ) , which are straight lines of slope @xmath126 and @xmath127 ( as discussed further in section 2.9 below ) , fig.3 .",
    "since for the fpa model @xmath137 and @xmath129 , the characteristics are at rightangles to one another ; moreover , _ they coincide with the principal axes of the stress tensor_. it is this special property of the fpa model that we believe embodies edwards physical picture of arches @xcite .",
    "the stress arising from the weight of an element of sand propagates along two straight characteristics , one at @xmath119 to the vertical ( which we identify as the  arch direction \" , coincident with the major principal axis ) and the other at rightangles . as shown in section 2.9 below , the _ majority _ of the stress",
    "is carried by the outward characteristic ( slope @xmath126 ) .",
    "the material can therefore be viewed as a set of nested arches ( fig.1(b ) ) down which most of the stress propagates .",
    "( this ties in with edwards idea of  lines of force \" @xcite . )",
    "however , _ a minority _ of the stress is transmitted instead from one arch to its inner neighbour ; this transfer imparts mechanical stability to the outer , incomplete , arches .",
    "since the principal axes and the characteristics coincide , there are no shear forces acting at the interface between successive arches , which are therefore effectively in _ frictionless _ contact with one another .",
    "this seems to be as close as one can get , within a consistent continuum theory , to the intuitive picture of arches as independent load - bearing structures .",
    "we emphasize that for a sandpile constructed from a point source , the fpa model can be viewed in two ways ; either as a _",
    "macroscopic _ hypothesis concerning the transmission of stresses at the scale of a pile ( principal axes fixed in space ) , or as a _ microscopic _ hypothesis concerning the way the growth history of the pile is locally encoded .",
    "our own modelling approach , based on local constitutive relations among stresses , corresponds to the latter view .",
    "indeed , after making the assumption of perfect memory , we have to choose one scale - free property ( the constitutive equation ) to be  remembered \" by any element from the moment of its burial : and the choice made by fpa corresponds to remembering the orientation of the stress tensor ( principal axes fixed in time ) . note that , once the basic fpa assumption is made , there is no free parameter left in the theory ( at least , not in two dimensions ) , since @xmath27 is fixed by experiment .",
    "it seem plausible that the construction of the pile ( by a series of avalanches at the surface ) imparts to the local packing of grains a permanent sense of direction .",
    "if so , the fpa constitutive relation is perhaps the simplest model for how this  orientiational memory \" within an element could determine the constitutive relation among stresses arising there subsequently . a possible ( though not a necessary ) interpretation of this directional memory is in terms of a fabric tensor @xmath138 @xcite .",
    "for example , one could postulate that @xmath138 was constant throughout the medium ( when expressed in cylindrical polar coordinates ) and moreover had a principal axis @xmath17 bisecting the free surface and the vertical .",
    "if this were true , the fpa constitutive relation would reduce to the commutation requirement @xmath139 .",
    "apart from its appealing simplicity , however , we have no detailed mechanistic justification for the fpa model in terms of the fabric tensor or any similar quantity : why should the orientation of the principal axes be remembered , rather than something else ?",
    "( for example , in the ife model each element  remembers \" instead that it was at the critical threshold for slip when buried , and remains so forever after . )",
    "we therefore propose the fpa model as a phenomenological hypothesis to be tested against experiment .",
    "it is interesting , in that context , to consider alternative closures ; we do this next , by embedding the fpa model within a broader scheme .",
    "a sandpile is formed by layerwise deposition of particles that have rolled down its free surface .",
    "thus the grains of sand may end up arranged in a packing that locally distinguishes the directions toward and away from the central axis .",
    "an arching effect can arise if this anisotropy tends to direct stresses outward from the centre , thus  screening \" the central part of the pile from the added load of new layers .",
    "this offers a possible way to explain the dip ; and indeed the fpa model can be viewed in exactly these terms . however , it is not unique in this respect .",
    "a more general approach can be generated by an adaptation of the bcc model , in which it was assumed that @xmath140 .",
    "bcc thus singles out for special treatment the vertical and horizontal normal stresses .",
    "we now define the oriented stress linearity ( osl ) model by assuming a similar linear relationship between normal stresses , not in a ( @xmath58 ) coordinate system , but in a tilted one ( @xmath141 ) .",
    "the latter system is now characterized by an _ arbitrary _ ( but constant ) tilt angle @xmath34 to the vertical , and is related to ( @xmath58 ) via the transformation equation ( [ eqrot ] ) .",
    "( in general this @xmath141 system does _ not _ coincide with the one used earlier to discuss the ifs boundary condition . ) in the tilted coordinates , we now require ( following bcc ) that the two normal stresses ,  and are proportional : @xmath142 ( see fig.1(c ) ) . despite its formal similarity , the osl closure differs critically from bcc in that it violates the assumption , tacitly made by bcc , that the properties of the medium vary smoothly as one passes through the centre line of the pile ; it thereby allows a cusp ( dip or hump ) to arise in @xmath94 .",
    "leaving the angle @xmath34 and the constant @xmath143 free for the moment , we use the rotation eqn .",
    "( [ eqrot ] ) to obtain , in ( @xmath58 ) coordinates , the osl constitutive relation @xmath144 ( where , as always , @xmath145 ) . as with fpa , in cartesians ( @xmath59 )",

    "the constants @xmath147 and @xmath148 obey : @xmath149 clearly the bcc model corresponds to @xmath150 ( defined in eqn.[eqby2b ] ) and @xmath151 , whereas the fpa model , eqn .",
    "( [ fixedpa ] ) , is obtained by setting @xmath152 , @xmath153 .",
    "both are thereby special cases of osl @xcite .",
    "note that pairs of osl coordinate systems inclined through angles @xmath34 and @xmath154 ( or @xmath155 ) are identical , subject to interchanging the @xmath156 and @xmath37 axes ; they give the same values of @xmath147 and @xmath148 in ( [ eqlinclosure ] ) and hence the same stress profiles in the pile .",
    "the coefficients @xmath147 and @xmath148 ( or equivalently @xmath143 and @xmath34 ) in the osl model are not independent : an equation between them can be found from the ifs boundary condition as formulated in eqns .",

    "there are inner and outer regions which meet at @xmath161 ; in the outer region we obtain @xmath162 where we have introduced the constant @xmath163 in the inner region ( @xmath164 ) we find @xmath165 as stated already for fpa and bcc , we thus obtain stress profiles that are piecewise linear functions of @xmath46 .",
    "we see from ( [ eqinside ] ) that a dip in @xmath94 is present so long as @xmath166 .",
    "this applies for osl models on the part of the ifs line which lies in the left hand half plane , fig.4 ; such models are separated by the bcc model ( @xmath167 ) from osl models with a hump ( @xmath168 ) .    as described earlier in connection with eqn .",
    "( [ eqcoulomb3 ] ) , a further check on the consistency of the model should now in general be made : we require that the yield threshold is not exceeded within the pile .",
    "the above equations show that the threshold is exactly saturated , not only at the surface ( ifs ) but throughout the outer region .",
    "however , there is also the possibility of yield in the inner region ; when this happens , it first occurs at the very centre of the pile @xcite . in this neighbourhood , where shear stresses are negligible , the coulomb criterion eqn .",
    "( [ eqcoulomb3 ] ) simplifies to @xmath169 where @xmath170 is known asrankine s coefficient of active earth pressure \" @xcite .",
    "thus , for a given repose angle @xmath27 , acceptable osl parameters lie on the the segment of the ifs line bounded by eqn.([limits ] ) ( dash - dotted lines in fig.4 ) . outside this range",
    ", there is either too deep a dip or too high a hump , leading respectively to passive or active failure of the material at the centre of the pile .",

    "it divides those osl models which , on the central axis of the pile , have active behaviour ( @xmath172 ) , from those which are passive there ( @xmath173 ) . for the osl models",
    "generally , the orientation of the principal axes varies smoothly as one passes from left to right through the centre of the pile ( though the constitutive equation is nonanalytic there ) .",
    "the sole exception to this is fpa , which has instead a discontinuity in @xmath17 at @xmath57 , for the reasons discussed in the previous section .",
    "this highlights the fact that fpa is the only model in the osl family for which the geometrical picture of  nested arches \" ( fig.1(b ) and sec . 2.6 above )",
    "can definitely be said to apply .",
    "we have seen that in the osl model , the stresses propagate with a wave equation in which @xmath126 and @xmath127 are the positive and negative roots of eqn.([eqvelocities ] ) .",
    "the characteristics of this hyperbolic equation are thus straight lines of slopes @xmath126 and @xmath127 .",
    "this means that , if a perturbation is made at some point in the pile ( for example , increasing the weight of a certain element of sand ) , the resulting information travels along two  light rays \" ( together called a  light cone \" in ref.@xcite ) .",
    "since the stress propagation equations are linear , the entire stress distribution can be constructed by summing the contributions from all elements of sand propatated along suitable rays ; this offers an instructive geometric insight into the problem .",
    "first we consider the green function which describes the stress perturbation arising from a point source of weight .",
    "such a source term violates the left - right (  cylindrical \" ) symmetry of our two - dimensional system ; to deal with it we must introduce cartesians ( @xmath59 ) as opposed to the polar coordinates ( @xmath58 ) used so far . in such coordinates , eqn .",
    "( [ fpawave ] ) is virtually unchanged : @xmath174 where the @xmath175 signs apply for @xmath176 and @xmath177 for @xmath178 .",
    "our source term then consists of adding @xmath179 to the right hand side of the second member of the stress continuity equation ( [ eqpde ] ) , in which @xmath5 now replaces @xmath3 .",
    "this yields an inhomogeneous form of ( [ greenwave ] ) with derivatives of the delta - function on the right hand side .",

    "the factors @xmath15 and @xmath194 can be deduced as follows .",
    "first , one imposes the conservation law for @xmath195 defined above ; the total weight supported by the reflected and transmitted rays is the same as that in the incident ray .",
    "this yields immediately @xmath196 . secondly , by considering the force on a small element , one finds that not only the shear stress but also the horizontal normal stress @xmath197 must be continuous across the centreline .",

    "we can construct a geometrical solution of the wave equations for each stress component ; for the vertical normal stress @xmath205 at a point @xmath5 on the base ( say ) , this is done as follows ( fig.5(b ) ) . from each of two points separated by a small distance @xmath206",
    "centred on @xmath5 , construct the backward light rays ( allowing for any reflection at @xmath207 ) .",

    "the above construction provides a formula for @xmath121 which is , of course , identical to eqns.([eqoutside],[eqinside ] ) derived earlier .",
    "since the other stress components also obey a wave equation , each of these can be constructed similarly , as a weighted sum of the three @xmath214 s .",
    "the fact that each stress component is a piecewise linear function of @xmath5 then follows from the elementary geometry of triangles .",
    "the green function construction shown in fig.5 gives some direct insight into the role of the arching concept in describing stress propagation in granular media .",
    "the relation between the characteristic slopes @xmath215 and the arching effect is far from intuitive , however .",
    "specifically we can ask how , starting from the bcc model ( @xmath216 ) one should adjust the tilt parameter ( @xmath34 ) of the osl model so as to obtain an arching effect , and thereby a dip in the stress . in a slightly different language@xcite , this was addressed briefly in ref.@xcite , where it was suggested that to get an arching behaviour the light rays emanating from an element would have to be tilted _ outwards _ ( @xmath217 , or @xmath218 ) , thus transporting the load away from the centre .",
    "this suggestion , though at first sight reasonable enough , is actually wrong . in the fpa model , and all other osl models giving a dip , the light rays are actually tilted _ inward _ relative to the bcc model : their average slope , @xmath219 is negative ( @xmath220 ) .",
    "this would , at first sight , appear to carry the weight of the grains _ toward the centre of the pile_. the paradox is resolved by realizing that , on tilting the rays inwards , the amplitudes @xmath221 defined above , adjust so that @xmath180 becomes larger than @xmath181 .",
    "this means that a higher fraction of the weight of a grain is carried along the outward ray , and away from the centre of the pile ; this redistribution is more than enough to compensate for the average inward tilt of the two rays .      as mentioned in the introduction , trollope @xcite proposed a model which yields , in effect , edwards arches and bcc as its two limiting cases .",
    "the relation between this model and our own work is most clearly seen in terms of the above analysis using rays ; we therefore discuss it now",
    ".    in his model , trollope , without invoking any differential formulation of the problem , directly assumed that the stress could be constructed in a manner similar to that above , but using _ three _ rays ; two with equal and opposite velocities @xmath190 ( just as in the bcc model ) , and a third , horizontal ray ( @xmath222 ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath126 was taken as fixed globally by the type of packing ; however , a second parameter @xmath223 was introduced .",
    "this @xmath223 represents an imposed amplitude ratio @xmath224 for the outward and inward components of the bcc - like propagation ; as @xmath223 is varied , the amplitude @xmath225 of the third ray also changes ( in a manner that can be deduced from stress continuity ) .",
    "it is interesting that trollope already realized the importance of singular behaviour on the centreline ; for @xmath226 , his model has this property .    in the limit @xmath227 ( no arching , symmetric propagation )",
    ", @xmath225 vanishes and one recovers a bcc - like picture ( though unlike bcc , trollope did not connect @xmath126 to the repose angle ) . in the limit @xmath228 one again has two rays ,",
    "one of which is now horizontal .",
    "this limit does not correspond to any osl model however : within the osl model an infinite @xmath127 ( representing the horizontal ray ) automatically has zero amplitude : @xmath229 .",
    "trollope s horizontal ray enables stress continuity to be satisfied while giving a maximal dip ( zero normal stress @xmath195 at @xmath207 ) , reminiscent of the edwards approach .",

    "however , the introduction of this extra ray seems extremely ad - hoc , which is perhaps why the model is not more widely used today .",
    "mathematically its presence means that rays can no longer be identified as characteristics of a partial differential equation in two dimensions ; therefore trollope s construction can not correspond to any local constitutive equation among stresses .",
    "( all such closures must lead to hyperbolic equations for which a formal solution using characteristics is available , even if the characteristics are curved  as happens , for example , in the ife model @xcite . )",
    "we conclude that trollope s systematic arching theory must be rejected as unphysical  a view tacitly shared by most of the recent sandpile literature .",
    "however , many of the physical ideas behind the model , including the emphasis on discontinuities in propagation across the centreline , remain highly pertinent to the present work .",
    "we now extend our continuum modelling approach to the three dimensional conical sandpile .",
    "the conical pile is as shown in fig.1(d ) ; in addition to the cylindrical coordinates @xmath230 introduced before , an azimuthal coordinate @xmath231 is required . since we have axial symmetry around the @xmath2-axis , the principal axes of the stress tensor must include the azimuthal ( @xmath232 ) direction .",
    "( the orientation of this tensor can thus be fully specified , as before , by the inclination angle @xmath17 to the vertical of the major principal axis in the @xmath233 plane . ) recalling that the stress tensor is symmetric , we therefore have @xmath234 .",

    "note that symmetry requires also @xmath241    as our yield criterion for plastic failure of the granular material we retain the coulomb criterion @xcite for cohesionless granular materials ( which becomes a relation between principal stresses in the @xmath233 plane ) .",
    "however , the coulomb yield criterion is essentially two - dimensional in character and gives no explicit information on the circumferential stress @xmath240 . in common with previous authors @xcite",
    "we argue nonetheless that this should vanish on the free surface , as all the other stress components do : @xmath242 note that if we were to use instead the conical yield criterion @xcite or a similar ( fully three dimensional ) condition at the surface , eqn .",
    "( [ eqby3 ] ) would not be an extra assumption .",
    "the form of the new source terms in eqn .",
    "( [ eqpded3 ] ) is of interest .",
    "if these remain relatively small everywhere , one can expect to find ( independent of the form of chosen for the secondary closure relation ) qualitatively similar results to those obtained earlier in the two dimensional case .",
    "this scenario is indeed fulfilled for the various different secondary closures tried below . in any case , given that all stresses vanish at the surface ( as just described ) , these source terms become strictly negligible near the free surface of the pile , which may therefore be viewed locally as having a planar two - dimensional geometry .",
    "accordingly , the ifs boundary condition is completely unaffected ; the stresses on the surface of a pile obeying ifs are still given by eqns.([eqby2a],[eqby2b],[barmy ] ) .",
    "it follows that ( subject to the usual scaling assumptions , see below ) eqns .",
    "( [ eqabdonslope ] ) and ( [ eqpsionslope ] ) still govern the asymptotic behaviour near the free surface .",
    "thus the relation between the repose angle @xmath27 and parameters in the primary constitutive equation ( such as the tilt angle @xmath17 in the fpa model , or the @xmath147 and @xmath148 parameters in osl ) remain as they were in two dimensions .      as for the two dimensional case , by invoking the absence of an intrinsic length scale we may demand that solutions of of the stress continuity equation take the rsf scaling form , eqn .",

    "( [ eqpded3 ] ) can in principle affect the the asymptotic behaviour given in section 2.4 near the centre of the pile ( i.e. , small @xmath46 ) but _ qualitative _ changes arise only if either @xmath244 or @xmath245 become large in this limit .",
    "this does not occur for any of the models studied below .",
    "following the arguments made earlier in two dimensions , based on our assumptions of rsf scaling and `` perfect memory '' , we now propose local forms for both the primary and secondary constitutive relations , which must be as follows : @xmath246 where we have set @xmath247 as usual .    the form of eqn .",

    "( [ eqrk],[eqabcdef ] ) for any choice of the closure relations . however , no analytic solution appears to be obtainable even for those models which , in two dimensions , reduce to wavelike propagation .",
    "the problem can , of course , still be viewed as quasi two - dimesional ( one spacelike , one timelike variable ) , but if so the extra  source terms \" make the solution complicated .",
    "alternatively these models can be formulated in terms of wave propagation in two spacelike dimensions ( the @xmath250 plane ) with @xmath2 as a timelike variable . however , the green function for such waves is itself surprisingly complicated ( there is no sharp  light - cone \" @xcite ) and not directly amenable to the simple geometrical interpretations offered earlier .      for the primary constitutive equation , we can choose among those discussed earlier , namely ife and osl , with the latter including both bcc and fpa as special cases .",
    "we continue to require that the ifs boundary condition is obeyed at the surface ( which again fixes the osl parameters @xmath148 and @xmath147 to lie on the ifs line ) and that the coulomb yield criterion is not violated in the interior of the pile .    for the secondary constitutive equation ,",
    "we have investigated three ways of selecting the function @xmath251 .",
    "the first is to insist that @xmath251 coincides with @xmath134 so that @xmath252 everywhere in the pile : @xmath253 this has the merit of simplicity .",
    "( note that by symmetry this relation must hold anyway at the central axis of the pile , but not necessarily elsewhere . )",
    "a second choice is suggested by the observation that the @xmath232 direction is a minor principle axis for a conical sandpile with axial symmetry .",
    "generalizing slightly an assumption often made the context of conical hoppers @xcite , one could then choose as the secondary closure @xmath254 ( the haar - von karman hypothesis @xcite ) .",
    "this implies @xmath255 although the motivation for this choice in the sandpile context is not very clear , we have tried it out for comparison .",
    "our third choice of secondary closure , unlike the first two , does not explicitly depend involve the primary closure @xmath134 ; it is the linear relation @xmath256 which should be compared with the osl primary closure , eqn.([eqlinclosure ] ) .",

    "( [ eqcylindrical ] ) .",
    "the coefficient @xmath257 is in principle free . in practice , however , we have found that the requirement that the coulomb criterion @xmath258 holds in the interior of the pile means that values of @xmath257 close to @xmath148 are required ; hence for osl models the closure @xmath259 is never very different from @xmath260 .",
    "we have investigated these three closure relations @xmath261 for all the different primary closures  already discussed in section [ sec2d ] , for various values of the repose angle @xmath27 ( mainly in a range around @xmath262 ) . for all the parameters we tried ,",
    "the extra  source terms \" led mainly to smoothing of the two dimensional curves without qualitatively altering the presence or absence of the dip .",
    "since these source terms do not have a dramatic effect , it follows that the choice made for @xmath263 , at least among those investigated here , itself does not qualitatively change the stress profiles .      rather than provide a catalogue of curves for various combinations of primary and secondary closure",
    ", we will focus attention on the fpa model . in fig.6",
    "we compare the stress curves for the three - dimensional fpa with closures @xmath264 and @xmath265 . as mentioned previously , the choice of secondary closure proves quantitatively but not qualitatively important . also shown",
    "are the experimental results of ref .",
    "@xcite for piles of height 20 - 60 cm .",
    "the stresses are normalized by the total weight of the pile ; notice the good scaling collapse of curves from piles of varying heights .",
    "this confirms that the rsf scaling hypothesis made in this paper is obeyed to experimental accuracy , at least for the materials and pile sizes studied in ref .",
    "the agreement between experiment and fpa theory is generally satisfactory , although there is a significant error near the maximum of the vertical normal stress .",
    "obviously it would be helpful to have more data for small values of @xmath46 , but there are sufficient data points at the origin to clearly establish the presence and magnitude of the dip .",
    "the experimental data shown are for two different media both with repose angles close to @xmath266 .",
    "the resulting curves differ by an amount similar to the difference between the two choices of secondary closure , with @xmath264 giving slightly better results for  quartz sand \" and @xmath265 for  npk-1 fertilizer \" .",
    "( we do not attach any significance to this . )",
    "as mentioned previously , the fpa model has no adjustable parameters once @xmath263 is chosen and @xmath27 is fixed by experiment .    in fig.7",
    "we show the same predictions for the fpa model with closure @xmath264 alongside those for several other models with the same secondary closure .",
    "these models are bcc and ife ( neither showing a dip ) ; and two parameter choices for the osl model ( @xmath267 and @xmath268 ) which bracket the fpa case ( @xmath269 ) .",
    "this comparison shows a clear preference of fpa over those other models that have no adjustable parameter .",
    "it is conceivable that the data could be fit better by choosing an osl model with @xmath147 slightly different from unity .",
    "however , we do not believe the improvement is enough to justify the adoption of an extra fitting parameter , although further careful experiments might reveal this to be necessary .",
    "finally in fig.8 we plot the yield parameter @xmath270 for the bcc , fpa and ife models . by definition , @xmath271 everywhere in the ife model ; it also obeys @xmath272 in all models obeying the ifs boundary condition . in two dimensions it is also unity throughout the outer regime of the pile for all osl models . in three dimensions",
    "this is not the case , and in fact for osl models the material is clearly below the yield criterion throughout the bulk of the pile .",
    "this underlies the important distinction between the classical ife assumption ( fully mobilized friction , @xmath273 ) and the new models adopted in this paper .",
    "so far we have only considered the stress profiles of idealized sandpiles constructed by pouring sand from a stationary pipe , for which the boundary condition of incipient failure at the surface ( ifs ) was assumed .",
    "the slope @xmath274 to the horizontal of the free surface is by definition given by the repose angle : @xmath275 .",
    "according to our approach , however , the constitutive equation encodes the construction history , and piles built differently can behave differently . in discussing this issue , we restrict attention to the fpa constitutive model in two dimensions .    we consider first the following hypothetical experiment : a material with @xmath276",
    "is formed into a pile by the usual method . the pile",
    "is then reduced to a flatter ( symmetrical ) one of angle @xmath274 by simply taking away the upper section , grain by grain , without disturbing any material below ( fig.9(a ) ) . according to our model",
    ", the constitutive equation remains that of a pile with the larger repose angle , though the stresses are of course altered .",
    "the resulting stress pattern is shown in fig.9(b ) in comparison to that of a pile of repose angle @xmath277 which has the same final geometry .",
    "the first of the two piles has the larger dip .",
    "we can now ask the following : if a pile of @xmath278 is tilted from the base through an angle @xmath279 ( fig.9(c ) ) how large may @xmath279 become before an avalanche occurs ?",
    "a classical answer , based on the view that the repose angle @xmath27 is a material property _",
    "independent of construction history _",
    ", is that one would be able to tilt until @xmath280 is again equal to @xmath27 .",
    "( this ignores , as we have done throughout this paper , the small hysteresis effects associated with the bagnold angle @xcite ) .",
    "however , in our approach this should not quite be true , since the inclination angle of the principal axes in a pile at this condition is different ( by an angle @xmath279 ) from that of a pile created by the normal method at its repose angle .",
    "it turns out , however ( fig.9(d ) ) that unless the pile is substantially flattened ( @xmath281 or more ) , the difference between @xmath280 and @xmath27 is very slight , at least for repose angles in the usual range ( @xmath282 ) .",
    "this calculation can , with caution , be proposed as a model for what happens when a sandpile , built normally , is suddenly tilted through a finite angle @xmath279 .",
    "of course , in this case an avalanche does occur : however , if this happens by removal of a wedge _ without significant reorganization of the remaining part of the pile _ , leaving the new surface in a state of incipient failure , the above calculation can be applied ( except that , for simplicity , we have contrived a version in which the pile remains symmetrical ) . in principal , there should then be a change in the resulting repose angle if @xmath279 is large enough . however , the assumption that an avalanche occurs with no rearrangement of the remaining grains , is , for large @xmath279 , highly dubious .",
    "another critical test of our ideas is the following : a triangular pile is constructed as usual and then a large part of it removed ( grain by grain ) leaving a pile whose left hand slope is at the angle of repose @xmath27 , and whose right hand slope is at angle @xmath283 ( say ) to the horizontal . the geometry is chosen so that all of the material in the new pile was _ originally in the left half _ of the parent pile ( fig.10(a ) ) .",
    "to describe this situation , we have to use the fpa constitutive equation in the form ( [ fixedpaxz ] ) , in a coordinate system where @xmath207 denotes the centreline of the original pile . with the modified construction history just described , the singularity on the line @xmath207 lies outside the newly created pile , and the characteristics of stress propagation should be identical on both sides of its apex . throughout the pile ,",
    "a majority of the stress is carried down the _ leftmost _ ( rather than _ outermost _ ) characteristic .",
    "an interesting question now is , what is the maximum angle @xmath283 that we can choose for the right hand slope ? this can be found from the usual stability criterion @xmath284 ; the marginal case has equality at the free surface on the right and , for the fpa model , this gives ( after some algebra ) the condition @xmath285 the maximum @xmath283 for which the new pile is stable is shown as a function of @xmath27 in fig.10(b ) ; for @xmath286 , one has @xmath287 .",
    "this is a very interesting result , since it predicts that the repose angle of the right hand part of a pile built this way is quite different from the usual value , which prevails on the left .",
    "this prediction must , of course , be interpreted with caution since its extension to a fully three dimensional geometry is not obvious .",
    "perhaps the simplest three dimensional analogue is to build a pile and then open a hole directly below the vertex , allowing sand to flow out leaving a  volcano crater \" @xcite ; according to this prediction , the angle of repose on the inner side of the crater may differ substantially from that on the outer slope .",
    "this possibility deserves careful experimental study ; a significant difference is not ruled out @xcite .",
    "the situation is again complicated by the fact that the experiment will set up a flow which may rearrange the grains that remain in the pile .",
    "indeed , the removal by avalanche of the right hand part of the pile may set up a large region in which the grains have slipped down to the right , for which the constitutive equation may revert to that of the right hand part of a normal pile .",
    "( this could be true even if the actual particle displacements are extremely small . )",
    "if so , the measured repose angle could again approach @xmath27 , rather than @xmath288 which applies only when the removal of sand does not perturb the remainder .",
    "we show in fig.10(c ) the stress distribution in a pile made in this careful fashion ( with @xmath286 and @xmath289 ) . as one might expect",
    ", there is now no dip but a ( lopsided ) maximum in the vertical normal stress .",
    "the maximum lies to the left of the new apex ( at the point where an outgoing ray from this apex strikes the base ) .",
    "note that quite different predictions for this geometry could have been obtained by writing the fpa closure in a somewhat different form , which is , _ for a symmetrical pile only _ equivalent to eqn .",
    "( [ fixedpaxz ] ) @xcite , as discussed in section 2.7 : @xmath290 here the explicit dependence on construction history via the @xmath116 factor has been replaced by an @xmath5-independent but highly nonlinear constitutive relation among the stresses ( in the spirit of some of the models discussed in ref.@xcite ) . using this form",
    ", one could find a solution , with @xmath291 , for our asymmetrically constructed pile that would precisely coincide with the usual symmetrical case .",
    "( this possibility arises because the sign of @xmath292 , though not of @xmath5 , can change on the centreline of the new pile . )",
    "since we only have data for symmetric piles , we can not on the existing facts rule out this rather different version of the fpa model , although it does not correspond to our assumption that the principal axes of a material element are fixed at the time of burial .",
    "accordingly experiments on asymmetric piles would be a strong test of the theory .",
    "a somewhat different experiment would be to start with a symmetrical pile and then remove parts of it ( grain by grain ) so that the remainder forms an asymmetrical pile whose apex has not moved from the line @xmath207 .",
    "shown in fig.11 is the stress distribution in such a pile with left and right slopes @xmath293 and @xmath294 .",
    "an interesting feature is visible under the apex , where the vertical normal stress @xmath121 ( and therefore also the yield function @xmath96 ) is discontinuous .",
    "this behaviour is in fact a generic feature of sandpiles that include the line @xmath207 but are asymmetric about it .",
    "it stems from the fact that this normal stress is not continuous in the geometry of incident , reflected and transmitted rays considered earlier ( section 2.9 ) .",
    "an exception to this rule is if an asymmetrical pile is made by pouring sand onto a sloping base plate . in this case",
    ", we expect the apex of the pile to move slightly relative to the source so that more material rolls down the  long \" side of the pile and the repose angle in the two directions remain equal to @xmath27 .",
    "the constitutive equation must then ( given rsf scaling ) be the same as for a pile formed normally , and the stress exerted on the supporting plate is the same as that on an inclined plane inscribed through a normal pile .",
    "( in two dimensions , this can be found easily from our earlier results . )",
    "though asymmetric , this stress distribution will not show any discontinuity beneath the apex .",
    "as a last example of a sandpile constructed normally and then manipulated , in fig.12 we show the stress distribution in a pile whose top section has simply been cut off . though grain - by - grain removal of sections of a pile may impose experimental difficulties , this is perhaps the simplest geometry for which it could be achieved .",
    "as shown , the dip is gradually diminished and replaced by a plateau as larger and larger upper sections are taken away .",
    "finally , we note that a sandpile could be made by first distributing sand uniformly ( not from a point source ) in a retaining bin , from which the side walls are then removed . as with some of the examples studied above",
    ", the predictions depend crucially on whether significant slip occurs within the part of the pile that finally remains .",
    "the initial loading of the bin is likely to produce principal axes with vertical and horizontal orientations ( @xmath295 ) , so that if no slip occurs , we would expect the bcc model to apply ( no dip ) .",
    "however , if slip does occur so the remaining pile has been sheared downwards , the fpa picture should be more appropriate .",
    "the various types of experiment discussed above , in which the construction history of the pile is deliberately manipulated , provide a strong test of our basic modelling hypothesis that the constitutive equation encodes the construction history .",
    "for some of these geometries , the theoretical predictions challenge the  classical \" assumption , maintained in the recent physics literature on sandpiles , that for cohesionless granular media ( of a single grain size @xcite ) the repose angle is the same for all types of pile of a given material .",
    "( as mentioned in sec . 1.2 ,",
    "this assumption has long been avoided in the engineering literature on hoppers @xcite . ) of course , the repose angle remains a genuine material parameter in that the angle of a  normal \" pile ( built from a point source ) will differ for different cohesionless materials ; and for our purposes this can be taken as the unique definition of @xmath27 .",
    "it does not necessarily follow , however , that the repose angle taken up by a pile of the same material with a different construction history , will always be exactly the same . in any case , our modelling approach leads to a clear expectation that the _ stresses _ in such piles can be different ( even when the repose angles are not significantly different ) .",
    "this is a readily testable prediction which we believe deserves urgent experimental attention .",
    "this paper is a long one .",
    "it therefore seems useful to provide a brief summary of our modelling strategy , in the form of a list of contentions for which more detailed arguments can be found in the text above .",
    "we stress , however , that several points on the list have no first - principles justification : they are hypotheses whose value can at present only be judged by comparison with experiment .",
    "we also stress that several of these ideas have a long history ( which is not the same as saying that they are widely agreed upon ) .",
    "\\(3 ) for hard particles ( of infinite elastic modulus ) , no strain variables exist ; static frictional forces are indeterminate .",
    "stress continuity requires one supplementary equation for closure in two dimensions , and two for a conical pile in three dimensions .",
    "\\(4 ) scaling behaviour ( rsf scaling ) is observed , to experimental accuracy .",
    "hence there is no characteristic length scale in a sandpile under gravity .",
    "particle deformability would provide such a length ; so would size segregation .",
    "\\(6 ) we should therefore seek as closure a scale - free , local constitutive relation among stresses .",
    "formally : there is a function @xmath297 such that @xmath298 the constitutive relation depends on the local packing and therefore on the construction history : @xmath297 encodes @xmath296 .",
    "\\(7 ) @xmath297 for a material element is  frozen in \" at the time of burial ( perfect memory assumption ) .",
    "combined with rsf scaling , this means that for a sandpile constructed from a point source , @xmath297 is independent of position when expressed in cylindrical polar coordinates , though it may be singular on the central axis .",
    "\\(8 ) the boundary conditions for a pile constructed normally are ifs : incipient failure at the free surface .",
    "this means that _ at the surface _ , the major principal stress axis bisects the free surface and the downward vertical .",
    "( here and elsewhere , hysteresis effects associated with the bagnold angle are ignored . )",
    "\\(9 ) the search for a constitutive relation @xmath299 may legitimately entail ( a ) making simplified hypotheses to compare with experiment ; ( b ) microphysical modelling from first principles . we pursue the former in this paper , the latter elsewhere @xcite .",
    "\\(11 ) a physically more plausible ( but by no means unique ) choice for @xmath297 is provided by the fpa hypothesis . according to this , each element of material is impressed at burial with a sense of direction , which fixes forever the orientation of the stress tensor ellipsoid that the element can support .",
    "the model predicts a dip in two dimensions .",
    "\\(12 ) in three dimensions , a secondary closure relation is needed . among the more obvious choices",
    ", it makes relatively little difference which is chosen .",
    "even the simplest choice ( @xmath252 ) , combined with fpa , gives a reasonably good fit to the data of ref.@xcite , without adjustable parameters .",
    "\\(14 ) the above modelling approach , though initially set up for static sandpiles constructed from a point source , can also be used for more complex construction histories ( at least in some cases ) . for piles",
    "constructed normally and then modified by careful removal of grains , this approach predicts a nontrivial dependence of the repose angle @xmath27 , and of the stress distribution , on the way a pile is made .      of the models considered in this paper , it is clear that the fpa model has some especially attractive features .",
    "this model leads directly to an arch - like stress - propagation , with the major part of any load being carried down the arch direction .",
    "the latter coincides with the major principal axis of the stress tensor ; this _ everywhere _ bisects the free surface and the downward vertical .",
    "the predictions of the fpa constitutive relation thereby describe similar physics to the arching model of edwards @xcite ( and indeed the earlier  full arching theory \" of trollope @xcite ) .",
    "like such models , the fpa hypothesis can be viewed as a direct macroscopic ansatz of how stresses propagate : one assumes that the principal axes are fixed in space .",
    "viewed this way , we believe that the fpa model provides the first description of the arching picture within a fully consistent continuum mechanics framework .",
    "its experimental success strongly suggests that the presence of a macroscopic arching structure in sandpiles is the correct explanation for the observed minimum in the vertical normal stress below the apex of the pile .",
    "however , unlike previous arching models , the fpa hypothesis can also be interpreted as providing a local , history - dependent constitutive relation among stresses . in this context , it is among the simplest such equations that can plausibly be devised : we assume that the principal axes of a material element are fixed at the time of its burial .",
    "viewed as such , the fpa hypothesis contains no assumption of any macroscopic arching structure ; rather , it provides a plausible microscopic explanation for how such structures arise .",
    "its experimental success offers strong support for a modelling strategy cast in terms of such constitutive relations . for parameter values other than fpa , which is a special case",
    ", the more general osl model predicts , within the same modelling framework , a more complex pattern of stress propagation .",
    "( the principal axes and the propagation characteristics no longer coincide . )",
    "the extra fitting parameter provided by osl is probably not justified by the existing data .",
    "one feature of osl models which stands out strongly ( at least in two dimensions ) is the presence of reflection and refraction of stress - paths at the central axis of the pile ( see sec .",
    "careful experiments on the effect of small perturbing loads could reveal whether or not this really occurs , providing a strong test of this class of model .    in view of its attractive physical features , and of its experimental success , we currently favour the fpa hypothesis as the simplest starting point for more refined theories of sandpiles",
    ". it also forms a promising basis for future study of stress propagation in static granular media of geometries quite different from the normal conical pile .",
    "the richness of this area is amply illustrated by the handful of examples studied above in section 4 .",
    "consideration of these and other geometries could allow stringent experimental tests of both the fpa model , and the overall modelling strategy we have proposed . within this framework , there is , no doubt , scope for much more sophisticated models of how the construction history of a pile determines the local constitutive behaviour , but further efforts in this direction may require much more experimental input .",
    "the validity of the framework itself deserves close experimental scrutiny , particularly concerning the degree to which rsf scaling is obeyed .",
    "our assumption of scale - free ( rsf ) behaviour offers an immense simplification , but closer experimental investigation may reveal that this is not quantitative except under some limiting conditions . despite these uncertainties ,",
    "we feel that the modelling framework presented above has significant potential to provide improved physical theories of stress propagation granular media .    in future work @xcite we will explore the close connection between our osl model and a recent discrete stochastic models for stress propagation in sandpiles @xcite",
    "( see also @xcite ) , of which osl can be viewed as the ( mean - field ) continuum limit .",
    "an important concept arising from the stochastic models and from experiment @xcite ( see also @xcite ) is that of _ stress paths _ ; these are pathways through the medium along which most of the load is locally transmitted .",

    "<S> we present a new approach to the modelling of stress propagation in static granular media , focussing on the conical sandpile constructed from a point source . </S>",
    "<S> we view the medium as consisting of cohesionless hard particles held up by static frictional forces ; these are subject to microscopic indeterminacy which corresponds macroscopically to the fact that the equations of stress continuity are incomplete  no strain variable can be defined . </S>",
    "<S> we propose that in general the continuity equations should be closed by means of a constitutive relation ( or relations ) between different components of the ( mesoscopically averaged ) stress tensor . </S>",
    "<S> the primary constitutive relation relates radial and vertical shear and normal stresses ( in two dimensions , this is all one needs ) . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that the constitutive relation(s ) should be local , and should _ encode the construction history of the pile _ : this history determines the organization of the grains at a mesoscopic scale , and thereby the local relationship between stresses . to the accuracy of published experiments , </S>",
    "<S> the pattern of stresses beneath a pile shows a scaling between piles of different heights ( rsf scaling ) which severely limits the form the constitutive relation can take ; various asymptotic features of the stress patterns can be predicted on the basis of this scaling alone . to proceed further , </S>",
    "<S> one requires an explicit choice of constitutive relation ; we review some from the literature and present two new proposals . </S>",
    "<S> the first , the fpa ( fixed principal axes ) model , assumes that the eigendirections ( but not the eigenvalues ) of the stress tensor are determined forever when a material element is first buried . </S>",
    "<S> ( this assumes , among other things , that subsequent loadings are not so large as to produce slip deep inside the pile . ) </S>",
    "<S> a macroscopic consequence of this mesoscopic assumption is that the principal axes have fixed orientation _ in space _ : the major axis everywhere bisects the vertical and the free surface . as a result of this , stresses propagate along a nested set of archlike structures within the pile , resulting in a _ </S>",
    "<S> minimum _ of the vertical normal stress between the apex of the pile , as seen experimentally (  the dip \" ) . </S>",
    "<S> this experiment has not been explained within previous continuum approaches ; the appearance of arches within our model corroborates earlier physical arguments ( of s. f. edwards and others ) as to the origin of the dip , and places them on a more secure mathematical footing . </S>",
    "<S> the second model is that of  oriented stress linearity \" ( osl ) which contains an adjustable parameter ( one value of which corresponds to fpa ) . </S>",
    "<S> for the general osl case , the simple interpretation in terms of nested arches does not apply , though a dip is again found over a finite parameter range . in three dimensions , </S>",
    "<S> the choice for the primary constitutive relation must be supplemented by a secondary one ; we have tried several , and find that the results for the stresses in a three dimensional ( conical ) pile do not depend much on which secondary closure is chosen . </S>",
    "<S> three dimensional results for the fpa model are in good semiquantitative agreement with published experimental data on conical piles ( including the dip ) ; the data does not exclude , but nor does it support , osl parameters somewhat different from fpa . </S>",
    "<S> the modelling strategy we adopt , based on local , history - dependent constitutive relations among stresses , leads to nontrivial predictions for piles which are prepared with a different construction history from the normal one . </S>",
    "<S> we consider several such histories in which a pile is prepared and parts of it then removed and/or tilted . </S>",
    "<S> experiments along these lines could provide a searching test of the theory .    </S>",
