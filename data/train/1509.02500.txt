    "during the last few years , graphene has attracted a lot of experimental and theoretical attention in both fundamental physics and technological applications  @xcite .",
    "being a two - dimensional sheet of carbon atoms , graphene possesses unique electrical , mechanical and optical properties . at energies below",
    "a few ev these properties are well described by the dirac model , which assumes the linear dispersion relation for massless quasiparticles moving with a fermi velocity rather than with the speed of light  @xcite .",
    "new important physics was already revealed in the interaction of graphene with strong magnetic field  @xcite , with the field of an electrostatic potential barrier  @xcite , and with space homogeneous constant and time - dependent electric fields  @xcite .",
    "considerable attention has been given to the study of van der waals and casimir forces between two graphene sheets and between a graphene sheet and a plate made of some ordinary material  @xcite .",
    "these investigations are closely related to the subject of the present paper because the lifshitz theory expresses the force value via the reflection coefficients of interacting surfaces  @xcite ( through calculated along the imaginary rather than the real frequency axis ) .    the most fundamental formalism for calculation of the van der waals and casimir interaction in layer systems including graphene exploits the polarization tensor in @xmath0-dimensional space - time  @xcite .",
    "this formalism was shown  @xcite to be equivalent to the formalisms which use the spatially nonlocal electric susceptibilities ( polarizabilities ) of graphene and the density - density correlation functions in the random - phase approximation .",
    "the latter are directly connected with the in - plane and out - of - plane conductivities of graphene . the lifshitz theory with reflection coefficients expressed via the polarization tensor",
    "was compared  @xcite with the measurement data for the gradient of the casimir force between an au - coated sphere and a graphene - coated plate  @xcite , and demonstrated a very good agreement .",
    "it should be mentioned that the previously used hydrodynamic model of graphene was shown to be excluded by the data  @xcite .",

    ", only the partial results were obtained limited to the case of sufficiently high frequencies , where one can omit the temperature - dependent part of the polarization tensor .",
    "the reason is that the latter part found in ref .",
    "@xcite turned out to be correct only at the pure imaginary matsubara frequencies and it does not allow analytic continuation to the whole plane of complex frequencies including the real frequency axis .",

    "the analytic asymptotic expressions for the reflection coefficients and reflectivities of graphene at low and high frequencies were obtained for both tm and te polarizations of the electromagnetic field  @xcite .",
    "the new representation was also used to investigate the origin of large thermal effect arising in the casimir interaction between two graphene sheets  @xcite .    in the present paper",
    ", we develop the complete theory allowing calculation of the reflection coefficients and reflectivities of graphene - coated material plates .",
    "this theory exploits the polarization tensor of graphene derived in ref .",
    "@xcite and , thus , is based on first principles of quantum electrodynamics .",
    "in addition to great fundamental interest , such kind theory is much needed in numerous technological applications of graphene .",

    "deposition of graphene on silicon substrates provides an excellent anti - reflection , which is important for solar - cells  @xcite .",

    "9(a ) and 9(b ) the concentrations of charge carriers were chosen to be @xmath126 and @xmath127 , respectively . as is seen in fig .",
    "9(a ) , for a lower conductivity uncoated si plate the brewster angle is equal to @xmath128 . for the graphene - coated plate , however ,",
    "the full polarization of the reflected light does not happen at any incidence angle ( the minimum value @xmath129 is achieved at @xmath130 ) . for a higher conductivity si [ fig .",
    "9(b ) ] the full polarization does not happen either for an uncoated or for a graphene - coated plate .",
    "the minimum values @xmath131 and 0.18 are achieved at @xmath132 and @xmath133 for an uncoated and graphene - coated plates , respectively .    at the end of this section",
    ", we note that for si plates with the highest doping concentrations ( @xmath134 ) there is no influence of graphene coating on the reflectivity properties . in the region of high frequencies",
    "this fact was already discussed above , and at low frequencies the situation is the same as for metals considered in sec .",
    "[ sec : ref_gm ] .",
    "in the foregoing , we have developed theoretical description for the reflectivity properties of the graphene - coated plates made of different materials ( dielectric , metal and semiconductor ) .",
    "this theory is based on the dirac model of graphene , which is described by the recently found polarization tensor in ( 2 + 1)-dimensional space - time , allowing the analytic continuation to the real frequency axis  @xcite .",
    "the materials of the plate are described by the frequency - dependent complex index of refraction . in the framework of this theory ,",
    "the general formulas are obtained for the reflection coefficients and reflectivities of graphene - coated plates , and their analytic asymptotic expressions at both high and low frequencies .",
    "the developed theory is applied to the cases of graphene - coated dielectric , metal , and semiconductor plates .",
    "it is shown that for a dielectric material ( fused silica ) in the region of optical and ultraviolet frequencies the reflectivity of the graphene - coated plate at the normal incidence is by several percent larger than of an uncoated one . in this frequency region",
    ", the graphene coating also results in some increase of the brewster angle . in the asymptotic region of low frequencies",
    ", graphene coating is shown to significantly ( up to an order of magnitude ) increase the reflectivity of silica at the normal incidence .",
    "this effect is completely determined by the thermal corrections at room temperature .    for metals ,",
    "the developed theory is illustrated by the examples of au and ni plates . in the case of high and moderate frequencies",
    ", we have shown that the graphene coating decreases the plate reflectivity at the normal incidence . for low frequencies the graphene coating does not influence the reflectivities of au and ni plates .",
    "we have also applied the developed theory to graphene - coated semiconductor plates ( si with various concentrations of charge carriers ) . for the high - resistivity si plate",
    ", the influence of graphene coating at high frequencies achieves several percent similar to the case of a silica plate . in the region of moderate and low frequencies ,",
    "the graphene coating can significantly increase the reflectivity of si plate at the normal incidence .",
    "for the low - resistivity si the effect of graphene coating was investigated at different concentrations of charge carriers .",
    "it is shown that at high frequencies the graphene coating does not influence the reflecting properties . in the region of low frequencies",
    "the impact of graphene coating on the reflectivity of si plate at the normal incidence quickly decreases with increasing concentration of charge carriers and increasing frequency .",
    "the dependences of the reflectivities on the angle of incidence were also computed . according to our results ,",
    "the graphene coating increases the reflectivities of low - resistivity si at low frequencies .",
    "the full polarization of the reflected light is not achieved at any angle of incidence .    as was noted in sec .",
    "[ sec : intro ] , the theory of reflectivity properties of graphene - coated material plates is of interest in many technological applications using graphene coatings , such as the optical detectors , transparent conductors , anti - reflection surfaces in solar - cells etc . in the future , it is planed to generalize the developed formalism to the case of graphene with nonzero mass - gap parameter and chemical potential .",
    "it would be useful also to apply it to thin material plates ( films ) coated with graphene .",
