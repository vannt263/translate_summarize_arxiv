    "although the equivalence principle is well established for neutral bulk matter  @xcite,@xcite and neutrons  @xcite,@xcite,@xcite it has no experimental verification for charged elementary particles or antimatter .",
    "even the gravitational mass of the electron has not been measured .",
    "although there has been an attempt to measure the gravitational mass of electrons in the 1960 s by witteborn and fairbank  @xcite,@xcite , this experiment was inconclusive .",
    "the goal of this experiment was to determine the gravitational force on both electrons and positrons , but is was only performed with electrons yielding a result disputed in literature .",
    "the experiment was not repeated with positrons due to lack of an adequate positron source  @xcite .",
    "the primary cause of the failure of the experiment is the magnitude of the effect , comparable to the force on a elementary charge due to an electric field of @xmath0 v / m , corresponding in magnitude to the force repelling two unshielded electrons 5  m apart in vacuum .",
    "all electric fields must be controlled within at least an order of magnitude better accuracy .",
    "efforts are underway to measure the equivalence principle for neutral antimatter at cern  @xcite,@xcite,@xcite and fermilab  @xcite,@xcite to avoid the problems associated with the charge of the particle .",
    "however , it is argued that the equivalence principle for matter or antimatter could be different from the one for charged elementary particles  @xcite,@xcite so that an experiment with electrons and positrons is still called for .    since the first attempts of witteborn  @xcite to measure the gravitational mass of an electron much effort has been invested in the study of the experimental difficulties reducing the electric field to theoretical acceptable limits .",
    "first , the focused changed from positrons to anti protons  @xcite due to the large inertial mass difference between the elementary particles . later after a 1996 workshop on antimatter gravity and anti hydrogen spectroscopy  @xcite the focused changed again to neutral antimatter .",
    "the reason for this was the problem posed by the so - called _ patch - effects _  @xcite .",
    "these effects were assumed to render the measurements with positrons and even with anti protons impossible .",
    "however , witteborn and lockhart have always maintained that the patch - effects were somehow shielded after cooling to a temperature of 4.2  k  @xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "a possible shielding mechanism of the patch - effect was observed by rossi  @xcite and a patch - effect reducing with temperature and surface treatment has been observed over a metal surface  @xcite .",
    "also dittus  @xcite , proposing a gravity experiment in space , argues that with modern techniques the patch - effect can be reduced significantly .",
    "the above shows the need for a comparison of the gravitation on electrons and positrons and addressed why until now this has not been performed . in view of the recent technological developments of surface treatment these limitations",
    "can now be overcome and the experiment in a free horizontal flight in a high vacuum tube as first proposed by santilli  @xcite and its principles worked out by mills  @xcite can now be performed with small technological risks .    in the following first the principle of the experiment",
    "is lined out , then the the several components are highlighted and finally the conclusions are given .",
    "the principle of santilli s comparative test of the gravity of electrons and positrons is shown in figure  [ fig1 ] . at one end of a well - shielded horizontal vacuum tube an electron or positron",
    "is released with a horizontal velocity , @xmath1 . the particle moves through the vacuum tube until it reaches the other end at a distance @xmath2 and it is detected with a position sensitive detector . during the flight",
    "the particle experiences a constant gravitational acceleration , @xmath3 or @xmath4 .",
    "the deflection at the end of the flight path is simply given by @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the time the particle needs to reach the detector after is has been released at the source .",
    "this is called the time - of - flight .",
    "( 300,160 ) ( 100,0 )    the deflection of the particle is proportional to the gravitational force so that measuring the deflection is sufficient to determine its sign . for neutral matter",
    "this set - up can be easily realized and with some more effort the same principle has been used to detect the gravity effects on neutrons  @xcite,@xcite .",
    "however , the measured deflection also depends on the time - of - flight , which is simply given by @xmath7 .",
    "_ hence , the deflection is inversely proportional to the ( horizontal ) kinetic energy of the particle . _",
    "the particle source will typical emit particles with some velocity distribution , hence the deflection is smeared out .",
    "this can be prevented by measuring the time - of - flight using a pulsed source . in that case",
    "the deflection of the particles is proportional to the square of the time - of - flight .",
    "another assumption in the above reasoning was that the particles were emitted horizontally . with a typical particle source",
    "this direction will have some final spread around the horizontal , which again results in smearing out of the deflection .",
    "for neutral matter this is overcome by applying a diaphragm system to direct and collimate the particle beam . as mills  @xcite",
    "has shown for charged particles a diaphragm system can be replaced by a focusing system and a suitable aperture system in the middle of the flight path .",
    "this relaxes the requirements for particle source strength quite a bit as a much larger divergence can be tolerated . with the focusing lens",
    "the source is imaged on the detector reducing the smearing out of the deflection .",
    "this is schematically shown in figure  [ fig2 ] . for a lens to work appropriate ( with as small as possible aberrations )",
    "the lateral dimensions should be some two orders of magnitude smaller than the longitudinal dimensions ( par - axial approximation ) .",
    "( 300,160 ) ( 60,0 )    another experimental feature that mills incorporates is to reverse the flight direction keeping all other experimental conditions unchanged .",
    "the average of the four deflections is much less sensitive to remaining electric and magnetic stray fields and equal to @xmath8 hence both sides of the vacuum tube must provide sources of electrons and positrons and detectors of the same .",
    "this also limits the possibilities of the focusing system to a symmetrical one , with a magnification of 1 . in the following sections some details on the main components",
    "are given .",
    "the main requirements for the electron and positron sources needed for this experiment can be inferred from figure  [ fig3 ] . to have a good compromise between maximal kinetic energy and minimal flight - path",
    ", the available source area must have a height of some 100 @xmath9 m and a length of the order of a centimeter .",
    "the length can not be larger because then the focusing properties of the lensing system will be imparted .",
    "the height can not be larger as then too small kinetic energies would be needed .",
    "the kinetic energies needed are of the order of 1 to 100 @xmath9ev , which for electron and positron sources are ultra low energies . that these ultra low kinetic energy electron and positron sources needed for this experiment are obtainable in sufficient quantities was shown in concept by mills  @xcite ( needed fast positron beam intensity of @xmath10 1/s/@xmath11 ) and by experiment as discussed by kurz  @xcite .",
    "the possibilities would increase when instead of a @xmath12na source , a reactor - based positron sources  @xcite,@xcite could be used where the positron yield is at least a factor of 10 larger .",
    "another possibility is to use positron traps which can store up to @xmath13 positrons per cell  @xcite and release them in pulses .",
    "focusing has to be done by means of a symmetric time - of - flight dependent electrostatic or magnetic lens , because the focus distance of such a lens is determined by the relative kinetic energy change of the particles passing the lens . the ability to tune the lens to the right field value will determine for a large portion the minimal attainable kinetic energy or maximal attainable deflection .",
    "an important design criterion is the wavelike structure that electrons and positrons exhibit .",
    "the de broglie wavelength is inversely proportional to the velocity given by @xmath14 where @xmath15  js , @xmath16  kg is the electron ( or positron ) inertial mass , @xmath17  nm for @xmath18  km / s . due to this wavelike structure of the particles , the circular apertures in the middle of the setup result in a fraunhofer diffraction pattern at the detector plane .",
    "the most simple diffraction pattern from a circular aperture with diameter @xmath19 is the airy pattern where the inner most intense fringe is called the airy disk .",
    "this airy disk has a diameter of @xmath20 as long as @xmath21 .",
    "note that the airy disk size is inversely proportional to the velocity of the particles , while the deflection is inversely proportional to the square of the velocity .",
    "the diameter of the airy disk should be less than the anticipated deflection ( rayleigh s criterion ) , hence @xmath22 where @xmath23  cm and @xmath24  ms .",
    "_ hence , due to the wavelike nature of the particles , the minimal time - of - flight needed to obtain a sufficient resolution is inversely proportional to the diameter of the aperture .",
    "_ note that for @xmath25  m and @xmath26  cm , the velocity of the particle should be maximal @xmath27  km / s , hence its wavelength at least @xmath28  nm and its corresponding kinetic energy maximal @xmath29ev .",
    "in such a case the deflection would be minimal 16  @xmath9 m .",
    "the deflection increases to 0.1  mm for particles with a kinetic energy of 25  @xmath9ev .",
    "if one would take the values used by mills  @xcite @xmath26  cm and @xmath30  m , then the velocity of the particle should be maximal @xmath31  km / s , hence its wavelength at least @xmath32  nm and its corresponding kinetic energy maximal @xmath33  mev .",
    "in such a case the minimal deflection would still be only 16  @xmath9 m .",
    "the deflection would however increase to 5.6  mm for particles with a kinetic energy of 25  @xmath9ev .",
    "in reality the source will have a finite dimension , increasing the above mentioned spot diameter .",
    "for an ideal instrument the image of the source on the detector plane and the airy disk should have approximately the same size and be comparable to the detector resolution .",
    "in such a case the minimal needed aperture is completely determined by the needed resolution @xmath34 this also fixes the minimal needed length of the instrument as @xmath35 is between 0.1 and 0.001 .",
    "the upper bound is due to limitation of the particle - optics components ( par - axial approximation ) and the lower bound due to intensity limitation as the particle intensity on the detector is given by all the particles that are passed through the aperture and is proportional to @xmath36 , hence @xmath37 can not be made too small . if it is used that @xmath38 , then the maximum velocity to obtain a sufficient resolution is given by @xmath39 and the corresponding maximal kinetic energy @xmath40 the maximal kinetic energy of the particle as function of the aperture diameter",
    "is shown in the left graph of figure  [ fig3 ] for different values of @xmath37 .",
    "the corresponding minimal length of the flight path is shown in the right graph . from these graphs",
    "one can see that the choices made by santilli and mills to use a flight path between 10 and 100 m is a good compromise between the needed flight path ( as small as possible ) and the needed minimal kinetic energy ( as large as possible ) .",
    "( 300,140)(30,0 ) ( 0,10 ) ( 40,-5)resolution diameter / @xmath9 m ( 20,130)minimal flight path / m ( 180,10 ) ( 220,-5)resolution diameter / @xmath9 m ( 200,130)kinetic energy / mev    a flight path as large as possible would be optimal as all other requirements relax when the flight path increases",
    ". however , the realization costs for the flight path will be roughly proportional to the square of the flight path length because for an optimal performance the diameter of the flight path has to be proportional to its length .",
    "if only the length will be made larger and not the diameter then the advantage of increasing the flight path is lost in the reduction of intensity .",
    "hence , the optimal flight path depends on budget but probably will be between 10 and 100 m.    probably the most crucial part of the instrument will be the shielding of residual electric and magnetic fields .",
    "the most important components that need to be shielded sufficiently well are those resulting in a force in the same ( or opposite ) direction as gravity .",
    "an extensive review of all possible fields that need to be shielded is given by darling  @xcite .",
    "his conclusion is that with the current technology it is possible to construct an adequate shielding .",
    "the way this can be done is described by mills  @xcite .",
    "it consists of a stacked layer system of different materials cooled to a temperatures close to 4.2  k to obtain optimal shielding .",
    "the only remaining shielding issue is the electric potential variation in the flight path of the particle due to the inner surface of the most inner layer of the flight path tube .",
    "this inner surface consists of small crystallites exhibiting a small potential variation , these constitute the so - called patch - effect .",
    "this might cause a potential variation of about 1 @xmath9v on the axis of the flight tube .",
    "this is a reason why the inner shield must also be cooled down to liquid helium temperatures reducing the patch effects .",
    "a way of determining the influence of the patch effect is to estimate the optical phase differences due to potential variations over different paths from source to detector .",
    "the optical phase along a particle trajectory is given by @xmath41 where @xmath42 equals the refractive index along the trajectory defined by @xmath43 .",
    "this refractive index is coupled to the potential by @xmath44 where @xmath45  c is the elementary charge and @xmath46 is the potential along the trajectory .",
    "the plus holds for electrons , the min for positrons .",
    "variations in the potential due to the patch effect are very small , hence the variations in the refractive index can be approximated by @xmath47 and variations in the optical phase are directly related to variations in the potential according to @xmath48 according to darling  @xcite a gaussian distributed patch effect ( with root - mean - square patch potential , @xmath49 and average crystallite size @xmath50 ) on the inner surface of a long cylinder ( @xmath51 ) results in potential variations of @xmath52 on the axis .",
    "the line integral over these variations can be estimated by transforming the integral over a sum of @xmath53 patches of length @xmath50 .",
    "the sum can be regarded as a random walk , so that the final spread in @xmath54 becomes @xmath55 where @xmath56 . to be able to get a good focus",
    "this variation in optical phase should be much smaller than @xmath57 .",
    "note that the variation is proportional to the wavelength , which clearly favors faster particles .    for the optimal resolution setup of the previous section",
    "this condition puts a limit on the ratio between @xmath19 and @xmath2 @xmath58 where @xmath59 m , @xmath60 m , @xmath61v .",
    "this is completely determined by the required resolution and the patch potential distribution .",
    "if a resolution of 100  @xmath9 m is required and @xmath37 would be between 0.001 and 0.1 , then for @xmath62 m , @xmath49 has to be less than 100 to 10  @xmath9v , which is perfectly feasible  @xcite .",
    "according to equation  ( [ eq : phasespread ] ) the spread in optical phases close to the cylinder axis is proportional to the wavelength .",
    "this explains why the vertical flight path as used by witteborn  @xcite is much more sensitive to the patch effect than the horizontal flight path considered here .",
    "take @xmath63 ( the average wavelength for a particle just reaching the top of the flight path ) , then for @xmath64  m , @xmath65  cm and @xmath66 m , @xmath49 has to be less than 250  nv at least a factor of 400 smaller .",
    "darling  @xcite takes @xmath67  nm and @xmath68  v , as limit which corresponds to a variation of the optical path phase of @xmath69 .",
    "hence , both approaches give similar results .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : phasespread ] ) can be rewritten as function of the total deflection of the particle beam @xmath70 this is independent of the particle properties .",
    "hence , _ for a required given deflection in the proposed experiment , the influence of the patch potential effects does not depend on the type of particle used_.    in view of the relatively large kinetic energies involved in this horizontal flight path experiment with regard to the witteborn experiment  @xcite and the implicit determination of the average kinetic energy by means of the time - of - flight method , the influence of the patch - effects will be much reduced .",
    "this also relaxes the requirements on the vacuum pressure quality to about @xmath71  pa as the time - of - flight is at least a factor of 100 shorter and the main effect it has on the results is a reduced intensity at the detector .",
    "the preferable detector should be a linear position sensitive detector that can detect both electrons and positrons .",
    "the spatial resolutions should be in the order of 100  @xmath9 m and the time resolution of the order of 0.1  ms with an efficiency as high as possible .",
    "these are moderate requirements and can be met by for instance micro channel plates  @xcite,@xcite,@xcite or linear cmos detectors  @xcite .",
    "the above shows that with current technology it is perfectly feasible to perform the long awaited experiment to compare the gravitation on electrons and positrons as suggested by r.m .",
    "santilli  @xcite almost two decades ago .",
    "the largest challenge will be the adequate shielding of the flight path to acceptable levels by means of a supercooled vacuum tube .",
