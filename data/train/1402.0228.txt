    "despite the fact that pulsars were discovered almost half a century ago , the emission mechanism of the pulsed radio emission remains unresolved .",
    "the challenge lies in the difficulty to identify the correct `` coherent '' mechanism @xcite that can power radio emission with similar emission characteristics over about four orders of magnitude in rotation period @xmath4 and up to eleven orders of magnitude in the rate of increase of pulsar periods @xmath9 . in this paper",
    "we perform a systematic analysis of radio emission efficiency for the current sample of pulsars , in an effort to study the global radio emission properties and to constrain radio emission mechanism . in section [ sec : calc ] we present the method to calculate radio luminosity @xmath3 and radio emission efficiency @xmath0 of pulsars .",
    "the dependences of both @xmath3 and @xmath0 on pulsar parameters are presented in section [ sec : res ] .",
    "the results are summarized in section [ sec : sum ] along with a discussion on the physical implications of the found correlations .",
    "for a number of reasons a correct estimate of a pulsar s radio luminosity is difficult ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "a common practice is to assume that the intensity distribution along the observer s line - of - sight cut through the emission region is representative for the entire emission beam .",
    "then , the luminosity of a pulsar can be calculated as follows : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the pulse duty cycle , @xmath12 is a distance to the pulsar , @xmath13 is the angular radius of the emitting cone , @xmath14 and @xmath15 bracket the radio frequency range in which the pulsar is detected , and @xmath16 is the mean flux density measured at a given frequency @xmath17 .",
    "the pulse duty cycle can be calculated using the so called equivalent width @xmath18 ( i.e. the width of a top - hat pulse having the same area and peak flux as the true profile ) as @xmath19 . to derive @xmath13 we have to know the geometry of the pulsar emission beam : @xmath20 - the inclination angle between the rotation and magnetic axes , @xmath21 - the impact parameter , and @xmath22 - the observed pulse width .",
    "these values are usually not known for most pulsars . in order to keep the sample of pulsars as large as possible , in this paper we calculate the luminosity @xmath3 assuming some typical values for all pulsars : @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , ( see * ? ? ? * for more details ) , so that @xmath26 note that here , we neglect any dependence of @xmath27 on the spin parameters @xmath4 and @xmath28 . in this way",
    "we avoid any bias in calculation of @xmath3 and keep our analysis model - independent ( see section [ sec : sum ] for discussion ) .",
    "additionally , such an approach allows us to compare the obtained results with x - ray and @xmath6-ray observations .",
    "sometimes it is convenient to use monochromatic luminosities ( often also called `` pseudoluminosities '' ) @xmath29 to estimate how luminosity varies in frequency . here",
    "@xmath30 is the mean flux density measured at different frequencies ( e.g. @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 ) .",
    "note that @xmath34 has the similar dependences on @xmath30 and @xmath12 as @xmath3 .",
    "the radio emission efficiency of pulsars is defined as the fraction of rotational energy transformed into radio emission , i.e. @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the rate of loss of rotational energy ( also called spin - down luminosity ) , and @xmath37 is the moment of inertia .",
    "note that @xmath3 and @xmath1 are two independent parameters that come from very different measurements .",
    "while @xmath3 is derived from measuring both radio emission flux and distance of a pulsar , @xmath1 is derived from pulsar timing measurements .",
    "the @xmath3 parameter depends on the unknown pulsar radio emission physics .",
    "there is no _ a priori _ reason to expect that @xmath0 should depend on @xmath1 ( or other parameters defined by timing parameters ) in any way .",
    "in the following , we investigate how @xmath3 and @xmath0 are correlated with other pulsar parameters .",
    "figure [ fig : one]a shows radio luminosity @xmath3 as a function of the spin - down power @xmath1 .",
    "one immediately sees that there is essentially no dependence between the two parameters , with best fit @xmath38 and @xmath39 for normal and binary / millisecond pulsars , respectively .",
    "a similar conclusion is achieved when one replaces @xmath3 by pseuodoluminosities @xmath34 .",
    "the linear fits in different frequencies show that the exponents for @xmath40 relations are all close to 0 , i.e. 0.18 , 0.1 and -0.08 for 400 , 1400 , and 2000 mhz , respectively , with a rough trend that the exponent decreases with increasing frequency .",
    "note , however , the pulsar samples at 400 mhz ( 641 objects ) and especially at 2000 mhz ( 27 objects ) are considerably smaller than that at 1400 mhz ( 1436 objects ) .",
    "the weak dependence of @xmath3 on @xmath1 suggests a near linear inverse correlation between @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "figure [ fig : one]b shows such an anti - correlation , with the best linear fits @xmath41 and @xmath42 for normal pulsars and binary / millisecond pulsars , respectively .",
    "even though the spread in values of both radio luminosity and efficiency is high for a given spin - down luminosity , the @xmath43 dependence is clearly visible , with low efficiency ( e.g. @xmath44 ) at high spin - down rate ( e.g. @xmath45 ) and high efficiency ( e.g. @xmath46 ) at low spin - down rate ( e.g. @xmath47 ) .",
    "such a near linear inverse correlation between @xmath0 and @xmath1 is non - trivial . for comparison , in panels ( c ) and ( d ) in figure [ fig : one ]",
    "we also show how x - ray and @xmath6-ray efficiencies depend on @xmath1 .",
    "it is clearly seen that the x - ray efficiency is essentially independent on @xmath1 , i.e. @xmath48 ( see figure [ fig : one]c ) , and the @xmath6-ray efficiency only weakly depends on @xmath1 , i.e. @xmath49 for normal pulsars and as @xmath50 for millisecond ones ( see figure [ fig : one]d ) . when calculating both the x - ray and @xmath6-ray efficiencies , we have assumed a same solid angle for all pulsars , which is the same assumption made in calculating radio emission efficiencies .      from the very",
    "beginning of pulsar astronomy it was suggested that radio luminosity of pulsars must decline with age .",
    "such an evolution could explain the rapid drop in pulsar distribution around the period of @xmath51 @xcite .",
    "as suggested by @xcite many more pulsars would be observed if the luminosity were constant .    since @xmath52 and @xmath53 , the above negative linear @xmath54 correlation would be translated to a positive linear @xmath55 correlation .",
    "figure [ fig : two]a shows that such a dependence is indeed there , with a best linear fit ( for normal pulsars only ) @xmath56 . notice that millisecond pulsars are excluded in the analysis , since they have experienced recycling spin - up process , so that their @xmath2 is not the characteristic age since birth .",
    "this interesting relation suggests a surprising result that as a pulsar ages , it somehow transforms its spin - down luminosity more efficiently into radiation .",
    "such a relationship is nontrivial , and provides valuable information about the mechanism of radio emission .",
    "again for comparison , we plot @xmath57 and @xmath58 against @xmath2 in fig .",
    "[ fig : two]b and fig .",
    "[ fig : two]c , respectively .",
    "we find unlike radio emission , there is essentially no obvious correlation in x - rays ( with @xmath59 ) , and there is only a weak and rather scattered correlation in @xmath6-rays ( with @xmath60 ) .",
    "this again suggests that the radio emission mechanism is different from those of high - energy radiation .",
    "the lack of pulsars with high - efficiency , high-@xmath1 and young - age pulsars suggest that there is no significant selection effect for the two reported correlations above .",
    "one may still suspect that the two correlations in the low-@xmath1 and old - age regime may be affected by an observational selection effect , which is against the detection of low-@xmath0 pulsars due to the sensitivity limit of radio telescopes .",
    "figure [ fig : four ] presents the dependence of the observed mean flux density @xmath61 measured at @xmath32 on the spin - down luminosity @xmath62 . as can be seen from the figure , the flux distribution of pulsars with relatively low @xmath1 is not significantly different from the flux distribution of pulsars with relatively high @xmath1 .",
    "there is no significant depletion of high - flux , low-@xmath1 pulsars , nor an increase of low - flux , low-@xmath1 pulsars .",
    "we argue that the relatively large sample of pulsars with @xmath63 ( 143 objects ) and the fact that all of them have @xmath64 implies that lack of detection of pulsars with low efficiency is not due to insufficient sensitivity of detectors .",
    "the two correlations reported above are therefore intrinsic .",
    "@xmath61 on spin - down luminosity @xmath62 .",
    "colors correspond to different values of radio efficiency.,width=283 ]      there have been efforts to look for how @xmath3 depends on @xmath4 and @xmath28 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the results are affected by the selection effect , and have been inconclusive ( see review paper by * ? ? ?",
    "we will show in this section that these dependences , if any , are rather weak .",
    "we first show the distributions of radio efficiency in different locations of the @xmath8 diagram and @xmath66 diagram as observed ( see figure [ fig : p_pdot_age.luminosity ] ) .",
    "as can be clearly seen , the observed radio luminosity does not depend in any significant way on @xmath4 or @xmath5 .",
    "+         it would be interesting to investigate the intrinsic underlying @xmath4 and @xmath28 dependences of @xmath3 , which may be revealed through monte carlo simulations .",
    "@xcite ( hereafter ) argued that in the absence of torque decay ( e.g. due to magnetic field decay ) the radio luminosity of pulsars must be correlated with pulsar age , and hence with @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "they found that the luminosity law ( i.e. dependence of the radio luminosity on @xmath4 and @xmath5 ) should be close to @xmath67 . in order to independently investigate an intrinsic luminosity distribution and eventual dependence of @xmath3 on @xmath4 and @xmath5",
    ", we have performed some `` monte carlo '' ( mc ) simulations based on the open - source package psrpoppy @xcite .",
    "this package includes two methods to obtain a synthetic sample of pulsars : the snapshot and evolutionary methods .",
    "the snapshot method consists of the following steps : generating pulsar periods , modeling of pulse widths , generating radio luminosities , distributing the pulsars in the galaxy , modeling electron density , and generating spectral indices .",
    "the evolutionary method consists of the steps from the snapshot method but is also extended by additional ones : generating pulsar period derivatives , generating magnetic fields , generating rotational alignment and modeling its time evolution , modeling pulsar spindown , and finally , evolving pulsars through the galactic potential ( see * ? ? ? * for more details ) .",
    "therefore , we used the evolutionary part of this code to reproduce the results of . after the calculation of a synthetic population",

    "@xcite ( pmps ) in order to constrain the population based upon known detections .",
    "pmps is the most successful survey to date with 1062 normal pulsars detected , which allows one to test a synthetic population using more than a half of the total observed population of normal pulsars .",
    ".population synthesis parameters used in mc simulations based on the evolutionary method .",

    "figure [ fig : faucher_random]a shows the reproduced @xmath70 diagram for the random luminosity model calculated using the theoretical death line approximated by the equation @xcite ( figure 14 in ) .",
    "the result is similar to , who noted that , in the absence of magnetic field decay and using the random luminosity model , the results of monte carlo - based population synthesis showed a clear pileup of observed objects near the death line in the @xmath70 diagram .",
    "however , we note that the used approach did not take into account that a radio emission process ( whatever it may be ) should have an upper limit for its efficiency . in figure",
    "[ fig : faucher_random]a pulsars with derived radio efficiency greater than one percent are marked by reds dots .",
    "the efficiency of some of these pulsars approaches , and even exceeds 100% .",
    "this is physically unreasonable .",
    "more likely , the condition for pulsar radio emission may be such that a certain maximum efficiency is imposed .",
    "one should check whether the radio efficiency ( see equations [ eq : eff ] and [ eq : lum ] ) does not exceed 100% ( @xmath71 ) for each independent draw of @xmath72 , @xmath4 and @xmath73 .    in figure",
    "[ fig : faucher_random]b we show the @xmath70 diagram obtained by mc simulation using our optimal random luminosity model ( see table [ tab : population_parameters ] ) with the condition for pulsar death based only on the upper limit for radio efficiency .",
    "using the efficiency limit allows not only to avoid a pileup of pulsars near the theoretical death line , but also explains the existence of a few pulsars observed in the so - called graveyard region .      +      in figure [ fig : histograms ] we present comparison of the observed distribution with synthetic distributions for our optimal model ( presented in figure [ fig : faucher_random]b ) .",
    "we have found that the random luminosity model with proper input parameters can reproduce the observed sample much better than the models proposed by fk06 .",
    "the kolmogorov - smirnov ( k - s ) test on the flux distribution for the power - law model gives the probability ( the k - s p - value ) @xmath74 ( see figure 6 in ) , while the k - s test on the flux distribution for our optimal random luminosity model result in probability of @xmath75 .",
    "note that in our optimal model the distribution of the spin period at pulsar birth is centered at @xmath76 .",
    "this allowed to obtain the higher probability of reproducing the period distribution than the one obtained by fk06 ( compare @xmath77 with @xmath78 ) , but negatively affected the probability of reproducing the period derivative distribution ( @xmath79 ) , and hence , the @xmath73 distribution ( compare @xmath80 with @xmath81 ) .",
    "it is worth noting that one of the parameters which strongly affects both period and period derivative distributions is the maximum efficiency limit .",
    "taking into account a relatively large number of parameters required by the evolutionary method and the fact that we arbitrary choose , the parameters of the model can be further optimized in order to better reproduce the observed sample .",
    "calculations show that using the condition for pulsar death based on the radio efficiency limit allows to avoid pile up of pulsars near the death line . as a result",
    "we have found that neither the magnetic field decay nor the dependence of the luminosity on @xmath4 and @xmath5 are required to reproduce the observed sample ) is a strong proof that the magnetic field at stellar surface is dominated by crust - anchored local magnetic anomalies ( see section [ sec : sum ] for more details ) . ] .",

    "using a large sample of pulsars from the atnf catalog , we draw the following conclusions in this paper : 1 . radio pulsar luminosity has a very weak , if any , dependence on pulsar spin - down luminosity @xmath1 over near 8 orders of magnitude in @xmath1 .",
    "there might be a slight variation of the exponent of the @xmath83 correlation with frequency .",
    "2 . there is a near linear inverse correlation between radio efficiency @xmath0 and @xmath1 for both normal and binary / millisecond pulsars .",
    "the radio efficiency @xmath0 is roughly linearly correlated with pulsar age @xmath2 for normal pulsars .",
    "4 . the two reported correlations are not due to an observational selection effect .",
    "5 . since radio luminosity",
    "does not depend on @xmath4 and @xmath5 ( or the dependence is very weak ) the proposed mechanism of radio emission must explain the significant increase of radio efficiency for low-@xmath62 pulsars .",
    "a weak @xmath83 correlation was hinted by previous studies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite found a weak positive dependence @xmath84 with a smaller sample ( 338 objects ) , which was selected by requiring the pulsars to have well - determined spectra , and/or well - determined distance .",
    "we adopt a much larger sample , which has the following advantages .",
    "first , a larger sample size can insure more reliable correlations .",
    "second , many uncertainties , e.g. unknown moment of inertia of neutron stars , the influence of scintillation on pulsar flux density , or how well the one - dimensional line - of - sight cut through an emission beam could represent the entire beam , can be effectively canceled out . with our enlarged sample ,",
    "the index of the correlation , if any , is much flatter than the ones found in the previous studies ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "as discussed in  2.1 , by using the simplified formula ( [ eq : lum ] ) , we have neglected some complicated pulsar geometry factors , such as @xmath20 , @xmath21 ( which defines the duty cycle @xmath11 along with @xmath4 , and @xmath13 ) .",
    "for individual pulsars , the derived @xmath3 should have a large error . including the entire sample would cancel out most of these geometric factors , so that our discovered @xmath54 and @xmath55 correlations would be intrinsic .",
    "one possible factor that is not fully canceled is the @xmath4-dependence .",
    "this is because both @xmath13 and @xmath11 depend on @xmath4 .",
    "however , the explicit exponent of @xmath4-dependence is unknown .",
    "if we assume that the mechanism of radio emission is the same for both normal and millisecond pulsars , we find that by adding a dependence of @xmath85 to the integrated luminosity , the @xmath54 correlations for both normal and binary / millisecond pulsars become consistent with each other .",
    "adding this period dependence results in the following luminosity relationships : @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 .",
    "the found correlations are closer but still shallower than the one found by @xcite .",
    "with such a correction , the @xmath54 correlation is slightly shallower , i.e. @xmath89 , but is still very significant .",
    "it has an even lesser impact on the @xmath55 correlation , i.e. @xmath90 after correction . in a more general form ,",
    "we can write that @xmath91 . since in our analysis",
    "we are not using geometry information we can not unambiguously define both @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "however , assuming similar radio luminosity of normal and millisecond pulsars we can write that @xmath94 .",
    "note that even introducing some model - dependent value of @xmath92 does not change the general picture presented in this paper .",
    "it would seem natural to assume that the spin - down parameters affect the radio luminosity ( and hence the radio efficiency ) of pulsars .",
    "therefore , many authors ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) tried to define the luminosity law , however , the results vary greatly ( depending on pulsar samples and used methods ) and were inconclusive ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the spin - down parameters determine the magnetic field strength at the light cylinder .",
    "then , assuming dipolar configuration of magnetic field we can estimate the field strength at the stellar surface as and the vacuum potential drop as @xcite .",
    "the main parameters that affects properties of pulsar radio emission are density and distribution of the electron - positron pair plasma . to estimate the plasma properties we need to use some specific model of acceleration ( e.g. the vacuum gap , the space - charged limited flow , the partially screened gap models ) and also to take into account various emission processes ( e.g. curvature radiation , inverse compton scattering ) .",
    "it was shown ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that the plasma density and distribution highly depend on some factors which can not be estimated by the spin - down parameters .",
    "thus , we can not specify the properties of plasma responsible for radio emission using only @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "however , assuming dipolar configuration of pulsar magnetic field , some theoretical predictions suggest that the older the pulsar , the smaller the final pair multiplicity @xcite . it would suggest that some kind of dependence of the radio luminosity on the pulsar age could also be found . as we have shown",
    "it is not the case for the observed sample of radio pulsars ( see figure [ fig : p_pdot_age.luminosity ] ) .    in order to reproduce the observed sample of pulsars fk06 argued that in the absence of torque decay pulsar radio luminosity has to depend on @xmath4 and @xmath5 as ( or with exponents optimized by @xcite ) .",
    "however , the power - law luminosity model results in relatively low p - value of the k - s test for the flux distribution . we have found that replacing the modeled death line @xcite by the radio efficiency limit allows to reproduce the observed sample even with the luminosity model previously excluded by fk06 , namely the random luminosity model . introducing the radio efficiency limit into mc simulations results in much higher probabilities from the k - s test , allows to avoid a pileup of pulsars near the theoretical death line and , furthermore , explains the existence of a few pulsars observed in the so - called graveyard region .",
    "we argue that the facts that the observed luminosity does not depend on both @xmath4 and @xmath5 , and that the random luminosity model of the intrinsic luminosity allows to reproduce the observed sample is a strong indication in favor of the random model .",
    "it is very difficult to explain the spread of up to four orders of magnitude for both @xmath3 and @xmath0 for a given spin - down luminosity only by statistical uncertainties .",
    "as we have mentioned above there must be some parameter / parameters other than @xmath4 , @xmath28 that influence the radio efficiency of pulsars .",
    "the clear @xmath54 linear inverse correlation and @xmath95 linear correlation for radio emission call for the following physical picture : the plasma responsible for generating pulsar radio emission must be produced under similar conditions regardless of pulsar age , dipolar magnetic field strength , and spin down rate .",
    "one possibility is that the pulsar polar cap region may have dominant crust - anchored magnetic anomalies , so that the near surface magnetic field configuration significantly deviates from the dipolar geometry @xcite .",
    "x - ray observations of old pulsars indeed revealed hot spots that are significantly smaller than the conventional polar cap @xcite , which is consistent with having strong non - dipolar magnetic field at the surface due to crust - anchored local anomalies .",
    "the crust - anchored anomalies can be characterized by a parameter @xmath96 , which describes the ratio of the actual value of the magnetic field at the surface @xmath97 to the dipolar component of the magnetic field @xmath73 ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    ". here is the conventional polar cap area ( i.e. calculated assuming pure dipolar configuration of the magnetic field ) , and @xmath98 is the actual hot spot area ( i.e. derived from x - ray observations ) .",
    "the sample of pulsars with an x - ray hot spot for which @xmath99 can be estimated is small .",
    "nevertheless , with this small sample @xcite , we can clearly see a correlation between pulsar age and @xmath99 ( see figure [ fig : bparameter ] ) .",
    "parameter on pulsar age @xmath2 ( see text for more details ) .",
    "dashed line correspond to the linear fit for all pulsars with detected radio emission .",
    "note that for we used the single blackbody fit performed by @xcite . ]",
    "the found correlation indicates that when a pulsar becomes older , its surface magnetic field becomes more dominated by the crust - anchored magnetic anomalies generated e.g. by the hall drift ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "such a crust - anchored anomaly does not depend on @xmath1 and age , which allows pulsars to produce enough electron - positron pairs at an old age to power radio emission .",
    "the fact that pulsars near the graveyard tend to have a very high @xmath0 also has a profound implications in understanding radio pulsar death .",
    "traditionally , pulsar death line @xcite was defined by the condition of production of electron - positron pairs , which depends on many uncertainties , including the near - surface @xmath6-ray emission mechanism @xcite and the magnetic field configurations @xcite .",
    "the results presented in this paper offer a simpler interpretation to radio pulsar death .",
    "it is possible that the required physical condition to power radio emission is similar among pulsars in all ages , which requires a certain minimum spin - down power .",
    "when pulsars spin down slightly below this threshold , the radio emission mechanism simply can not operate .",
    "this explains why high @xmath0 pulsars are located near the death line .",
    "a similar conclusion was drawn by @xcite based on modelling `` of the birth properties and rotational , kinematic , and luminosity evolution of a monte carlo population of neutron stars '' , even though the luminosity and spin - down rate scaling presented in their work , @xmath100 , does not reflect the actual @xmath101 relationship ( see figure [ fig : one]a ) .",
