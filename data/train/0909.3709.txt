    "polymer chains are well solvated and adopt a swollen coil conformation .",
    "as the temperature is increased across the lcst , the solvent quality goes from good to poor , phase separation occurs , and macromolecules collapse to display a dense globular conformation .",
    "such a behaviour is commonly encountered in liquid binary mixtures in which specific interactions ( _ e.g. _ hydrogen bonding ) exist between constituents @xcite , as in aqueous solutions of poly(n - isopropylacrylamide ) ( pnipam ) , one of the most studied among thermo - sensitive systems @xcite .",
    "pnipam in water exhibits a lcst around 32@xmath2c @xcite , above which polymer chains become hydrophobic .",
    "the coil - to - globule transition in bulk solutions occurs over a narrow range of temperature and involves large variations in chain dimension@xcite .",
    "these properties , which have been recently exploited in microfluidics for the design of switches @xcite and valves @xcite for flow control , have found their main applications in bio - engineering @xcite .",
    "the use of pnipam coatings on solid surfaces is indeed a widespread technique for cell adhesion control in tissue engineering @xcite , or for separation of biomolecules in temperature selective chromatography@xcite .",
    "grafted pnipam brushes are viewed as promising surface modifiers in order to finely tune the interactions between cells or proteins and the surfaces of biomedical devices@xcite .",

    "this appears for instance from two recent studies on harvesting of cell cultures grown on thermoresponsive substrates , that reached opposite conclusions about the influence of brush thickness on cell proliferation / detachment @xcite .",
    "this underlines that reliable control of interactions requires a deeper understanding of how the brush properties ( surface energy , ability to swell / collapse , thermal response , ... ) depend on molecular parameters such as grafting density or chain length @xcite .",
    "the structure of pnipam brushes in water has been the subject of recent experimental investigations .",
    "force sensing techniques ( atomic force microscopy and surface forces apparatus ) have been used to measure ( i ) the range of repulsive forces resulting from brush compression @xcite , and ( ii ) adhesion forces between pnipam brushes and various countersurfaces @xcite .",

    "bringing together the conclusions of these studies , two important results may be put forward :    \\(i ) the collapse of densely grafted chains occurs over a broader temperature range @xcite than that of dilute chains in solution @xcite or brushes with low grafting density @xcite ,    \\(ii ) the swelling ratio , _",
    "i.e. _ the ratio of the swollen to the collapsed thickness , is affected by both chain length and grafting density @xcite .",
    "the former result has been obtained in several independent studies , and is in qualitative agreement with numerical and theoretical predictions about the collapse of brushes in poor solvent @xcite . however , open questions remain regarding point ( ii ) , due to the limited number of studies which systematically investigated the effect of molecular parameters on the magnitude of brush collapse @xcite . in particular , whether a high grafting density favors or prevents large swelling ratio is still to be clarified .",
    "furthermore , the role of brush density on the magnitude of adhesion forces with pnipam surfaces has remained unexplored .",
    "these points , which are crucial for the design of smart surfaces based on thermoresponsive thin films , have led us to investigate in further details the effect of grafting density on the properties of pnipam brushes .",

    "one may estimate a monomer volume fraction @xmath88 , which we find in the range 0.20.3 .",
    "we thus obtain , from force - distance measurements , an estimate of the monomer density above which the assumption of semi - dilute brushes ceases to be valid .",
    "@xmath30{fig8.eps}\\ ] ]      pnipam chains bear both hydrophobic ( methyl -ch@xmath31 ) and hydrophilic ( amide -nh , and carbonyl -c = o ) groups along their backbone . as suggested by the temperature dependence of the water contact angle ( @xmath89 ) shown on fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] , the outermost layer of a pnipam brush is expected to be the seat of local molecular rearrangements , so that , at @xmath90c , the hydrophobic groups are preferentially exposed at the interface with water . besides , the range of temperatures over which @xmath89 increases roughly corresponds to the range where brush thicknesses exhibit a steeper decrease with @xmath38 .",
    "this supports the idea that , as @xmath38 increases and chain dehydration and collapse proceed , a growing fraction of methyl groups is exposed at the surface , until a maximum surface density of ch@xmath91 is reached above @xmath92c .",
    "such a picture thus suggests that the attractive interaction between collapsed brushes observed at temperatures above @xmath92c ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2]a and reference @xcite ) most likely arises from the so - called hydrophobic forces that exist between methyl - terminated surfaces immersed in water @xcite .    now , the measurements of pull - off forces which do not depend on grafting density ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] ) indicate that adhesion between brushes in contact is , like wetting , mainly controlled by the nature of the chemical groups exposed at the interface .",
    "however , we note that while the water contact angle levels off above 35@xmath2c , pull - off forces are found to increase steadily up to 38@xmath2c .",
    "this suggests that , once the contact is established between two collapsed pnipam layers , some mechanism is at play , which affects interbrush adhesion but not wetting .",
    "we believe that this mechanism corresponds to the formation of interchain hydrogen bonds , between -nh and -c = o groups @xcite , thus contributing to increase the pull - off force .",
    "such h - bonds are directional and require that the chemical groups involved are favorably oriented along the polymer chains .",
    "this should therefore result in a pull - off force that increases with the contact time , due to the dynamics of molecular rearrangements which limits h - bonds formation .",
    "we are currently investigating this point , which constitutes a test of the above hypothesis of specific interactions at the interface between two pnipam brushes .",
    "we have performed a systematic study of the effect of grafting density on the collapse , compression and adhesion of pnipam brushes .",
    "our study , based on force / distance measurements in a surface forces apparatus , makes use of a plasma activation technique of mica surfaces that allows for covalent grafting of pnipam brushes by surface - initiated atrp .",
    "we show that the thermal response of such brushes is strongly affected by the grafting density , in good agreement with recent theoretical predictions @xcite : the swelling ratio is found to decrease noticeably at high densities , a result that may have direct implications in _",
    "nano / microscale flow control using pnipam brushes @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the analysis of force - compression curves provides an insight regarding the range of validity of the classical alexander - de gennes framework when dealing with dense brushes .",
    "finally , we show that in contrast to the swelling behavior , adhesive forces between brushes do not seem to be affected by the grafting density of the layers .",
    "such an observation leaves completely open the question of how brush thickness may affect cell / substrate adhesive interactions in cell culture applications of pnipam @xcite .",
    "we are indebted to christiane caroli for her contribution to data interpretation and her precious help with polymer brush theory .",
    "when thermal stability of the sfa allowed for a force resolution of @xmath93n , we have measured @xmath41 under a lower normal load of @xmath94n , _",
    "i.e. _ closer to the unperturbed thickness .",
    "this resulted in an increase of @xmath41 of 10% for the thicker brush and of 20% for the thinner .",
    "therefore , the values of the ratio @xmath44 reported in the text are most likely 10 to 20% lower than the `` true '' swelling ratio , as it could be measured using non - perturbating techniques like neutron reflectivity @xcite .",
    "we only note that the molecular weight we evaluate is larger than what have been reported in references@xcite",
    ". this might account for some differences regarding the magnitude of brush swelling / collapse observed in our study and in the work by plunkett _",
    "et al._@xcite .",
    "indeed , recent calculations by mendez",

    "indicates that the higher the molecular weight of grafted chains , the larger the difference beween swollen and collapsed thicknesses @xcite ."
