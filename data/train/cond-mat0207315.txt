    "recently layered cobalt oxides have been extensively investigated as a promising candidate for a thermoelectric material .",
    "the thermoelectric material is a material that shows large thermopower ( @xmath3 ) , low resistivity ( @xmath4 ) and low thermal conductivity ( @xmath5 ) @xcite .",
    "thus far oxides have been regarded as unsuitable for thermoelectric application because of their poor mobility , but some years ago terasaki _ et al . _",
    "found that a single crystal of the layered cobalt oxide naco@xmath0o@xmath1 exhibits high thermoelectric performance @xcite .",
    "_ showed that the dimensionless figure of merit @xmath6 of a naco@xmath0o@xmath1 single crystal exceeds unity at @xmath71000 k @xcite .",
    "@xcite measured @xmath8 at 1000 k even in the polycrystalline samples of naco@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "thus this compound is quite promising for thermoelectric power generation at high temperature .",
    "we have proposed that the high thermoelectric performance of the layered cobalt oxides can not be explained by a conventional band picture based on the one - electron approximation , but is understood in terms of the strong electron - electron correlation effects , similarly to the case of heavy - fermion compounds .",
    "in fact the material dependence of the thermopower quite resembles that of ce@xmath9 ( @xmath10=cu , ni , pd ; @xmath11=si , ge ) @xcite .",
    "here we briefly review the physical properties of naco@xmath0o@xmath1 , and compare them with those of the heavy - fermion compounds .",
    "we further show anomalous impurity effects @xcite , which are a prime example of `` order from disorder '' @xcite .",

    "in fig.1 is schematically shown the crystal structure of naco@xmath0o@xmath1 , where edge - shared distorted octahedra of oxygen ions form a two - dimensional triangular lattice .",
    "a cobalt ion is in the center of the distorted octahedra to form a two - dimensional triangular lattice , while a sodium ion is in a prism site between coo@xmath0 blocks .",
    "an important feature in this structure is that sodium ions randomly occupy the regular site by 50% , and the sodium content changes from 50 to 75% . in this sense naco@xmath0o@xmath1",
    "should be written as na@xmath12coo@xmath0 ( @xmath13=0.5 )",
    ". nevertheless we will call it naco@xmath0o@xmath1 , because the best thermoelectric properties are realized near the 50% na occupancy @xcite .    ) and thermopower ( @xmath3 ) of a naco@xmath0o@xmath1 single crystal along the in - plane direction ; ( b ) susceptibility ( @xmath14 ) and specific heat ( @xmath15 ) of naco@xmath0o@xmath1 polycrystals .",
    ", width=302 ]    figure 2(a ) shows the resistivity and the thermopower of a naco@xmath0o@xmath1 single crystal along the a - axis ( parallel to the coo@xmath0 block ) direction .",
    "the magnitude of the resistivity is as low as 200 @xmath16 cm at 300 k , which corresponds to nearly the best conductivity among transition - metal oxides .",
    "the thermopower is 100 @xmath17v / k at 300 k , which is as large as that of degenerate semiconductors . as a result ,",
    "the power factor @xmath18 is as large as ( or even larger than ) @xmath18 of the state - of - the - art thermoelectric material bi@xmath0te@xmath19 @xcite .",
    "figure 2(b ) shows the magnetic susceptibility @xmath14 and the specific heat @xmath15 of a polycrystalline sample of naco@xmath0o@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the susceptibility is relatively large ( 4@xmath2010@xmath21 emu / co mol at 4 k ) , and weakly temperature dependent .",
    "we attribute the weakly temperature dependent susceptibility to a kind of spin fluctuation , as is seen in the valence fluctuation systems .",
    "in fact , co - site substitution causes non - trivial change in the susceptibility .",
    "nonmagnetic zn substitution induces a curie term , whereas magnetic cu substitution decreases the magnitude of the susceptibility , which can not be interpreted by the local spin picture @xcite .",
    "the electron specific heat coefficient @xmath22 is evaluated by the value of @xmath23 as @xmath240 .",
    "@xmath23 approaches 35 - 50 mj / co molk@xmath25 , which is two orders of magnitude larger than the value of conventional metals .",
    "the large values of @xmath22 and @xmath14 clearly indicate that the density of states ( and also the effective mass ) is substantially enhanced in naco@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "note that the band calculation by singh @xcite also predicts the large density of states , though it is difficult to explain the anomalous impurity effects discussed later .",
    "the microscopic theory for the high thermoelectric performance of naco@xmath0o@xmath1 is still lacking , but we think that the following features are now established .",
    "( 1 ) the mixture of co@xmath26 and co@xmath2 in the low spin state can carry a large entropy of @xmath27log6 , which gives a thermopower of 150 @xmath17v / k in the high - temperature limit @xcite .",
    "( 2 ) naco@xmath0o@xmath1 shows no structural , electric , and magnetic transitions from 2 to 1000 k. ( 3 ) from ( 1)(2 ) , the large entropy can not be released through phase transitions , and inevitably point to the conducting carriers to form a `` heavy - fermion''-like electron @xcite .",
    "( 4 ) although an exact one - to - one correspondence is not realized , the calculated fermi surface of naco@xmath0o@xmath1 is made from two orbitals of different nature @xcite , just like ce @xmath28 and @xmath29 bands in the ce - based intermetallics @xcite .    in the heavy - fermion compounds , @xmath22 is proportional to the susceptibility @xmath14 , and @xmath30 ( the wilson ratio ) is independent of materials . in fig.3 ,",
    "various @xmath22 s are plotted as a function of @xmath14 , where the data for naco@xmath0o@xmath1 is just close to the data for the valence - fluctuation compound cepd@xmath19 @xcite .",
    "we should note that cepd@xmath19 has nearly the same values of @xmath3 ( 80 @xmath17v / k at 300 k ) and @xmath4 ( 150 m@xmath31 cm at 300 k ) .",
    "unfortunately it has much higher thermal conductivity than naco@xmath0o@xmath1 , which greatly reduces the thermoelectric performance .     as a function of magnetic susceptibility ( @xmath14 ) for various correlated metals .",
    ", width=302 ]    according to the classical boltzmann theory , the diffusive term of the thermopower of a metal is understood as transport entropy per carrier , implying that a large effective mass can lead to a large thermopower .",
    "figure 3 indicates that the effective mass of naco@xmath0o@xmath1 is more than 10 times larger than the bare electron mass , which is in a quantitative agreement with the reflectivity edge and the magnitude of the hall effect @xcite . considering a striking similarity to the heavy fermion compounds",
    ", we attribute the large mass of naco@xmath0o@xmath1 to the coherent state between the conduction carrier and the spin fluctuation . very recently",
    "valla _ et al .",
    "_ have performed a photoemission experiment for the layered cobalt oxides , and have successfully observed the coherent state at low temperatures @xcite .",
    "( b ) temperature derivative of the resistivity ( @xmath32 ) and temperature coefficient of the thermopower @xmath33 for the cu - substituted naco@xmath34cu@xmath35o@xmath1 .",
    "inset : the specific heat in magnetic fields.,width=302 ]",
    "figure 4(a ) shows the specific heat for the cu - substituted sample naco@xmath34cu@xmath35o@xmath1 as a function of temperature , where the specific heat jump at 22 k is clearly seen @xcite .",
    "the entropy change of the 22-k transition is as small as 77 mj / kmol , corresponding to 0.01@xmath27 per co. actually only 5% of co@xmath19o@xmath1 impurity exhibits a specific heat jump of the same order at 30 k. a phase transition accompanied by a small entropy change is an off - diagonal long range order , which induces a small entropy change of the order of @xmath36 .",
    "this order is suppressed by external fields , as shown in the inset of fig .",
    "figure 4(b ) shows the @xmath37-linear term of the thermopower ( @xmath33 ) and the temperature derivative of the resistivity @xmath38 .",
    "their temperature dependences are quite similar to each other , where the magnitude increases up to almost twice below 22 k. this indicates that the drude weight decreases by 50% at low temperatures , implying the existence of a ( pseudo)gap . as an off - diagonal long - range order with a gapped state , one would think of charge density wave ( cdw ) or spin density wave ( sdw ) .",
    "the calculated fermi surface of the @xmath39 band is hexagon - like @xcite , which is unstable against cdw or sdw formation with the nesting vector along the @xmath40-k direction .",
    "we think that the 22-k transition is sdw - like , because cdw is insensitive to magnetic field .",
    "actually we can find many similarities between the 22-k transition and the sdw transition in cr @xcite .",
    "naco@xmath0o@xmath1 is very close to the instability for various phase transitions arising from the large entropy per site .",
    "the cu substitution enhances the instability , and eventually causes the sdw - like transition at 22 k. this type of transition is called `` order from disorder '' @xcite . in other words ,",
    "instabilities against various phases are competing or disordering in naco@xmath0o@xmath1 , and any phase transitions are prohibited down to low temperatures .",
    "this does not mean that naco@xmath0o@xmath1 is far from the instability of phase transitions , but rather , is very susceptible to various transitions against various perturbations .",
    "in fact , na@xmath41co@xmath0o@xmath1 exhibits a spin - glass behavior at 3 k @xcite and a ferromagnetic transition at 22 k @xcite , possibly owing to the structure instability of the @xmath22 phase , and ( bi , pb)-sr - co - o shows a ferromagnetic transition at 4 k due to the lattice misfit @xcite .",
    "let us qualitatively discuss why the sdw - like state is favored in naco@xmath42cu@xmath12o@xmath1 .",
    "sdw and cdw are closely related to the nesting of the and the topology of the fermi surface , and occur when the correlation effect is weak enough to hold one - electron picture based on the band calculation .",
    "we think that cu suppresses the mass enhancement without significant change in the carrier concentration @xcite .",
    "if so , the substituted cu enhances the screening of the magnetic fluctuation , which might recover the band picture to cause the cdw / sdw instability of the @xmath39 fermi surface .",
    "we have reviewed the anomalous properties of naco@xmath0o@xmath1 , which are promising for thermoelectric applications .",
    "we have explained the thermoelectric properties of naco@xmath0o@xmath1 in terms of the layered structure consisting of the strongly correlated coo@xmath0 layer .",
    "carries in oxides are often coupled with the optical phonons , the spin degrees of freedom and the orbital degrees of freedom .",
    "these couplings induce exotic electronic states such as polarons , heavy fermions , spin liquids and orbital liquids .",
    "furthermore , the geometry and the dimensionality are easy to change in certain classes of oxides , where layered , ladder and chain structures can be controlled .",
    "therefore i believe that many functional materials including thermoelectric materials will still sleep unknown .",
    "i hope that naco@xmath0o@xmath1 is just the beginning , and that a thermoelectric oxide of higher performance will appear in near future .",
