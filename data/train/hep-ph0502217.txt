    "the study of properties of low - lying hadron spectrum from the viewpoint of qcd dynamics and symmetries has been an intrinsically interesting and relevant topic in physics of strong interactions . in this context , the explicit and spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry , as well as the u@xmath1(1 ) anomaly , play a key role for the generation of the low - lying pseudoscalar meson masses .",
    "the importance for this process of the u@xmath1(1 ) symmetry breaking , and the consequent violation of the okubo - zweig - iizuka ( ozi ) rule , has been stressed in many phenomenological investigations .    it is generally expected that ultra - relativistic heavy - ion experiments will provide the strong interaction conditions which will lead to new physics .",
    "restoration of symmetries and deconfinement are expected to occur under those conditions , allowing for the search of signatures of quark gluon plasma .",
    "in particular , the order of the chiral phase transition and its consequences for aspects of the dynamical evolution of the system are important questions .",
    "it is also believed that at high temperatures the instanton effects are suppressed due to the debye - type screening @xcite .",
    "then an effective restoration of u@xmath1(1 ) symmetry is expected to occur at high temperatures . in this context",
    ", it has been argued that the mass of the @xmath2 excitation in hot and dense matter should be small , being expected the return of this `` prodigal goldstone boson '' @xcite .",
    "there should be other indications of the restoration of the axial symmetry , like the vanishing of the topological susceptibility @xcite , @xmath3 , which , in pure color su(3 ) theory , can be linked to the @xmath4 mass through the witten - veneziano formula @xcite .",
    "in addition , since the presence of the axial anomaly causes flavor mixing , with the consequent violation of the ozi rule , both for scalar and pseudoscalar mesons , restoration of axial symmetry should have relevant consequences for the phenomenology of meson mixing angles , leading to the recovering of ideal mixing .",
    "we perform our calculations in the framework of an extended su(3 ) nambu  jona - lasinio model lagrangian density that includes the t hooft determinant : @xmath5   \\nonumber \\\\ & + & g_d\\,\\{\\mbox{det}\\,[\\bar q\\,(1+\\gamma_5)\\,q ] + \\mbox{det } \\,[\\bar q\\,(1-\\gamma_5)\\,q]\\}. \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] by using a standard hadronization procedure , an effective action is obtained , leading to gap equations for the constituent quark masses and to meson propagators from which several observables are calculated @xcite .    in what follows",
    ", we will concentrate first on the restoration of the symmetries at zero density and finite temperature , and the manifestations of the restoration on the scalar and pseudoscalar meson observables will be analyzed .",
    "in chiral models , when the coefficient of the anomaly term in the lagrangian ( @xmath6 in the present case ) is constant , it happens that , in spite of the decreasing of the u@xmath1(1 ) violating quantities , the axial symmetry is not restored due to the fact that the strange quark condensate does not decrease enough .",
    "however , an effective restoration may be achieved by assuming that the strength of the anomaly coefficient is a dropping function of the temperature @xcite .",
    "the analysis of the temperature dependence of the mixing angles , allowing for the understanding of the evolution of meson quark content and , in particular , of the role of the strange order parameter in su(3 ) chiral partners like @xmath7 and @xmath8 , can provide further indication of the restoration of the axial symmetry .",
    "preliminary results from calculations on lattice qcd at finite chemical potential @xcite motivates also the study of the restoration of the u@xmath1(1 ) symmetry at finite density .",
    "we study the effective restoration of chiral and axial symmetries with temperature and zero density in sec .",
    "[ ftc ] and , with finite density and zero temperature in sec .",
    "[ fdc ] . finally , we summarize our conclusions in sect .",
    "restoration of the axial symmetry should be manifest when the effects of anomaly are no longer visible and , in the present work , we model this feature by means of a specific temperature dependence of @xmath6 .",
    "so , following the methodology of @xcite , we extract the temperature dependence of the anomaly coefficient @xmath6 from the lattice results for the topological susceptibility @xcite ( see fig . 1 , left panel ) .    .",

    "meson masses , as functions of the temperature , with @xmath6 constant ( middle panel ) and @xmath9 ( right panel ) .",
    "the dotted lines indicate the continuum thresholds @xmath10 and @xmath11.,title=\"fig:\",width=377,height=264 ]    our results , concerning the restoration of the chiral phase transition , at zero density and finite temperature , indicate , as usual , a smooth crossover : at temperatures around @xmath12 mev the mass of the light quarks drops to the current quark mass .",
    "the strange quark mass also starts to decrease significantly in this temperature range , however even at @xmath13 mev it is still 2 times the strange current quark mass .",
    "in fact , as @xmath14 , the ( sub)group su(2)@xmath0su(2 ) is a much better symmetry of the lagrangian ( 1 ) .",
    "so , the effective restoration of the above symmetry implies the degeneracy between the chiral partners @xmath15 and @xmath16 around @xmath17 mev ( see fig .",
    "1 , right panel ) . for temperatures about @xmath18 mev ,",
    "both @xmath19 and @xmath20 mesons become degenerate with the @xmath21 and @xmath22 mesons , showing an effective restoration of both chiral and axial symmetries .",
    "in fact , the u@xmath1(1 ) symmetry is effectively restored when the u@xmath1(1 ) violating quantities show a tendency to vanish , which means that the four meson masses degenerate and the topological susceptibility goes to zero . without the restoration of u@xmath1(1 ) symmetry , the @xmath19 mass was moved upwards and never met the @xmath21 mass as can be seen in fig .",
    "1 , middle panel .",
    "the same argument is valid for @xmath20 meson comparatively with the @xmath22 meson mass .",
    "we remember that the determinantal term acts in an opposite way for the scalar and pseudoscalar mesons .",
    "so , only after the effective restoration of u@xmath1(1 ) symmetry we can recover the su(3 ) chiral partners @xmath23 and @xmath24 which are now all degenerate .",
    "however , the @xmath2 and @xmath25 masses do not yet show a clear tendency to converge in the region of temperatures studied .    in order to understand this behavior",
    ", we also analyze the temperature dependence of the mixing angle ( see fig .",
    "2 ) : @xmath26 starts at @xmath27 and goes , smoothly , to the ideal mixing angle @xmath28 and @xmath29 starts at @xmath30 and goes to the ideal mixing angle @xmath31 .",
    "this means that flavor mixing no more exists .",
    "in fact , analyzing the behavior of the su(2 ) chiral partner ( @xmath32 ) with the temperature ( fig .",
    "1 , right panel ) , we found that the @xmath19 meson is always a purely non - strange @xmath33 system while the @xmath22 meson , at @xmath34 mev , has a strange component and becomes purely non - strange when @xmath29 goes to @xmath31 at @xmath35 mev .",
    "at this temperature they start to be degenerate . concerning the su(2 )",
    "chiral partner ( @xmath36 ) , at @xmath34 mev , @xmath21 is always a light quark system and the @xmath20 meson has a strange component , but becomes purely non - strange when @xmath26 goes to @xmath28 at @xmath35 mev . in summary , we see that the u@xmath1(1 ) symmetry is effectively restored at @xmath18 mev : @xmath21 , @xmath20 , @xmath22 and @xmath19 mesons become degenerate , the ozi rule is verified and @xmath3 goes asymptotically to zero @xcite .",
    "we remember that @xmath21 , @xmath20 , @xmath37 and @xmath19 form a complete representation of u(2)@xmath0u(2 ) symmetry , but the @xmath21 and the @xmath19 do not belong to the same su(2)@xmath0su(2 ) multiplet .",
    "the partners @xmath38 , which become purely strange at high temperatures , do not converge probably due to the fact that chiral symmetry is not restored in the strange sector .",
    "recent calculations on lattice qcd at finite chemical potential motivates also the study of the restoration of the u@xmath1(1 ) symmetry at finite density .",
    "there are no firmly lattice results for the density dependence of @xmath3 , to be used as input , but the preliminary conclusions of @xcite suggest a possible decrease of @xmath3 .",
    "so , it seems reasonable to model the density dependence of @xmath6 extrapolating from our previous results for the finite temperature case and proceeding by analogy . here",
    "we present an example ( see fig .",
    "3 , left panel ) where we consider quark matter simulating `` neutron '' matter .",
    "this `` neutron '' matter is in @xmath39equilibrium with charge neutrality , and undergoes a first order phase transition @xcite . to begin with",
    ", we calculate the mixing angles for scalar and pseudoscalar mesons , @xmath26 and @xmath29 , respectively , that are plotted in fig .",
    "we observe that @xmath26 starts at @xmath27 and increases up to the ideal mixing angle @xmath28 .",
    "a different behavior is found for the angle @xmath29 that changes sign at @xmath40 .",
    "in fact , it starts at @xmath30 and goes to the ideal mixing angle @xmath28 , leading to a change of identity between @xmath22 and @xmath4 .",
    "we think this result might be a useful contribution for the understanding of the somewhat controversial question : under extreme conditions will the pion degenerate with @xmath22 or @xmath4 ?",
    "the change of sign and the corresponding change of identity between @xmath22 and @xmath4 , effects that we do not observe in the finite temperature case , are due to differences in the behavior of the strange quark mass @xcite .    .",
    "meson masses , as functions of density , with @xmath6 constant ( middle panel ) and @xmath41 ( rigth panel ) .",

    "3 , right panel .",
    "the results for constant @xmath6 are also presented ( middle panel ) for comparison purposes .",
    "the su(2 ) chiral partners ( @xmath43 ) are bound states and become degenerate at @xmath44 . with respect to the su(2 ) chiral partners ( @xmath32 ) , the @xmath19 meson is always a purely non - strange quark system . for @xmath45 @xmath19",
    "is above the continuum and , when @xmath46 , @xmath19 becomes a bound state . at @xmath47 , the @xmath22 has a strange component and , as the density increases , @xmath22 becomes degenerate with @xmath19 at @xmath48 as expected . in this range of densities ( @xmath32 ) and ( @xmath43 ) are all degenerate .",
    "suddenly , the @xmath22 mass separates from the others becoming a purely strange state .",
    "this is due to the behavior of @xmath29 that changes sign and goes to @xmath28 at @xmath49 . on the other hand",
    ", the @xmath4 , that starts as an unbound state and becomes bounded at @xmath50 , turns into a purely light quark system and degenerates with @xmath51 , @xmath20 and @xmath19 mesons @xcite .",
    "finally we analyze the behavior of charged mesons with density , plotted in fig .",
    "a glance at the figure immediately reveals that : the chiral partners @xmath52 and @xmath53 , upper panel , become degenerate for @xmath54 ; the chiral partners @xmath55 , middle panel , and @xmath56 , lower panel , do not degenerate in the region of densities considered .",
    "we notice that , while the results for @xmath57 are affected by the dependence of @xmath6 on density , we find no substantial differences for the kaonic mesons , whether @xmath6 is constant or not . in order to understand this ,",
    "let us remember that the effects of u@xmath1(1 ) symmetry breaking or restoration appear explicitly , in the gap equations and in the meson propagators , through the anomaly coupling , @xmath6 , times a quark condensate .",
    "for the pion and the @xmath19 propagators , the dependence on the anomaly enters through @xmath58 so , with @xmath6 a decreasing function of the density , this term will affect less and less the mesons masses as the density increases .",
    "then , the convergence of the mesons reflects the restoration of the u@xmath1(1 ) symmetry .",
    "since for kaonic mesons the propagators depend on the anomaly through @xmath59 , the anomaly has little effect on the kaonic masses , as the density increases , whether @xmath6 is constant or not , due to the strong decrease of the mass of the non - strange quarks .",
    "the dominant factor for the calculation of the masses of those mesons is the mass of the strange quark , which , although decreasing , remains always very high .",
    "we can say that the restoration of the axial anomaly does not influence the behavior of kaons and of its chiral partners .",
    "in addition , we remark that @xmath60 and @xmath61 have different behaviors in neutron matter @xcite , and the chiral asymmetry @xmath62 is always different from zero , even for high densities .    .",
    "the dotted lines indicate the density dependence of the limits of the dirac and the fermi ( @xmath63 and @xmath64 ) sea continua , defining @xmath42 thresholds for the mesons .",
    "the low - lying mesonic solutions ( denoted by the subscript @xmath65 ) are also included . ]",
    "we also analyze the low - lying solutions , which we denoted by the subscript @xmath65 . below the lower limit ( @xmath63 , in fig .",
    "5 ) of the fermi sea continuum of particle - hole excitations there are low bound states with quantum numbers of @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "these collective particle - hole excitations of the fermi sea , associated to a first - order phase transition , are manifestations of the violation of the isospin symmetry by the environment conditions .",
    "it is interesting to look for the respective chiral partners and observe the behavior of the mass splitting between scalar and pseudoscalar mesons as the densities increases .",
    "the decreasing of this splitting for @xmath68 and @xmath69 mesons can be seen in fig .",
    "we notice that the convergence between the different chiral partners always occurs at densities where the mesons are bound states ( see fig .",
    "5 ) , i.e. , they are collective excitations defined below the respective @xmath42 threshold .",
    "in this work we considered , via the u@xmath1(1 ) anomaly , an explicit breaking of the axial symmetry in the vacuum state .",
    "the subsequent restoration of axial symmetry at non - zero temperature ( density ) has been then discussed using a temperature ( density ) dependent anomaly coefficient . the case with @xmath70 for all temperatures ( densities )",
    "is also discussed .",
    "we verified that in this case there is always an amount of u@xmath1(1 ) symmetry breaking in the particle spectrum even when chiral symmetry restoration in the non - strange sector occurs at high temperature ( density ) .    since in all cases the chiral symmetry",
    "is explicitly broken by the presence of non - zero current quark mass terms , the chiral symmetry has been realized through parity doubling rather than by massless quarks .",
    "so , the identification of chiral partners and the study of its convergence is the criteria to study the effective restoration of chiral and axial symmetries .",
    "an important information is also provided by the mixing angles and we verify that , in the scenario of effective restoration of axial symmetry , the mixing angles converge to situations of ideal flavor mixing : ( i ) the @xmath20 and @xmath22 mesons are pure non - strange @xmath42 states , while @xmath25 and @xmath2 are pure strange @xmath71 excitations for non - zero temperature case ; ( ii ) the @xmath22 and @xmath2 change identities for neutron matter case .    in the conditions of explicit breaking of chiral symmetry we worked , su(3 ) symmetry is not exact and the strange sector does contribute with significant effects , even at high temperature ( density ) as it is visible in the behavior of @xmath25 and @xmath22 ( @xmath2 ) mesons .",
    "we can conclude that the u@xmath1(1 ) symmetry is , at least partially , restored above the critical transition temperature of the su(2 ) chiral phase transition .",
    "but , in the region of temperatures ( densities ) studied we do not observe signs indicating a full restoration of u(3)@xmath0u(3 ) symmetry .",
    "in fact , as we work in a real world scenario ( @xmath72 ) , we only observe the return to symmetries of the classical qcd lagrangian in the non  strange sector ."
