    ", the hs spin chain has been extensively studied as a completely integrable model  @xcite solvable by the asymptotic bethe ansatz  @xcite , whose spinon excitations provide a simple example of a system obeying fractional statistics  @xcite .",
    "the energy spectrum of the hs hamiltonian with spin @xmath3 was partially computed in the original papers of haldane and shastry . in a subsequent publication",
    "@xcite , haldane et al .  empirically found a complete description of the spectrum for arbitrary spin , and explained its highly degenerate character by the symmetry of the model under the yangian algebra @xmath4 .",

    "although there is a well - defined algorithm for computing the degeneracy of each motif , in practice the computation becomes quite involved except for @xmath14 .",
    "it is therefore difficult to derive in this way an exact expression for the partition function valid for arbitrary values of @xmath1 and @xmath15 .",
    "perhaps as a consequence of this fact , little attention has been paid in the literature to the global properties of the spectrum of the hs chain .",
    "some authors  @xcite have suggested that the main obstacle in computing the partition function of the hs chain in closed form is the fact that the dispersion relation   is nonlinear in @xmath16 , in contrast with the polychronakos rational chain  @xcite . in a recent paper  @xcite ,",
    "however , the partition function of the trigonometric hs spin chain of @xmath17 type has been exactly computed applying what is known as polychronakos s _ freezing trick _",

    "the hamiltonian of the original hs spin chain is given by @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the highest energy of @xmath24 . in order to apply the freezing trick ,",
    "we need to introduce the sutherland spin model @xmath25 and its scalar version @xmath26 we thus have @xmath27 where @xmath28 is obtained from @xmath24 by the replacement @xmath29 .",
    "the freezing trick is based on the fact that for @xmath30 the particles `` freeze '' at the equilibrium positions of the scalar part of the potential in @xmath31 , which are simply the lattice points of the chain  . in this limit ,",
    "the spin degrees of freedom decouple from the dynamical ones , so that by eq .",
    "the energies of the dynamical spin model are approximately given by  @xcite @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are _ any _ two levels of @xmath35 and @xmath24 . hence the partition functions @xmath36",
    ", @xmath37 , and @xmath38 of @xmath24 , @xmath31 , and @xmath35 , respectively , satisfy the approximate equality @xmath39 the latter equation leads to the _ exact _ formula @xmath40 which we will use to compute the partition function of the chain   in closed form .",
    "in order to evaluate the rhs of  , we need to compute the spectra of @xmath31 and of its scalar limit @xmath35 .",
    "these spectra can be obtained in a unified way by considering the scalar differential - difference operator @xmath41 where @xmath42 permutes the coordinates @xmath21 and @xmath16 .",
    "the operator @xmath43 is represented by an upper triangular matrix in a ( non - orthonormal ) basis whose elements are of the form @xmath44 where the vector @xmath45 is such that the differences @xmath46 , @xmath47 , are integers .",

    ".   implies eq .   with @xmath136 . in particular , from the latter relation between @xmath10 and @xmath137",
    "it follows that @xmath10 is a motif with no more than @xmath9 consecutive @xmath8 s .",
    "the rhs of eq .   is a polynomial in @xmath138 whose evaluation with a symbolic algebra package is straightforward once @xmath1 and @xmath15 are fixed . in this way we have been able to compute the spectrum of the chain   for relatively large values of @xmath1 and @xmath15 ,",
    "for which the usual motif approach becomes inefficient due to the difficulty of computing the degeneracies . from the analysis of the spectral data",
    "thus obtained one can infer several global properties of the spectrum that we shall now discuss .",
    "in the first place , it is apparent that for @xmath139 the level density is gaussian to a very high degree of accuracy , as in the hs spin chain of @xmath140 type studied in ref .  @xcite . in other words , for large @xmath1",
    "the cumulative level density @xmath141 is approximately given by @xmath142,\\ ] ] where @xmath143 is the degeneracy of the energy @xmath144 , and @xmath145 and @xmath146 are respectively the mean and the standard deviation of the energy .",
    "this can already be seen , for instance , in the case @xmath147 and @xmath14 presented in fig .",
    "[ levden ] .",
    "the agreement between @xmath148 and @xmath149 rapidly improves as @xmath1 and/or @xmath15 grow , e.g. , for @xmath14 the mean square error decreases from @xmath150 for @xmath147 to @xmath151 for @xmath152 , or from @xmath153 for @xmath147 to @xmath154 for @xmath152 when @xmath155 .          since",
    ", by the previous discussion , for large @xmath1 the level density is characterized by @xmath145 and @xmath146 through the gaussian law , it is of interest to compute these parameters in closed form as functions of @xmath1 and @xmath15 . in the first place , using the identity @xmath158 and eqs .   and",
    ", we obtain @xmath159 similarly , the formula @xmath160 yields @xmath161 ( cf .  ref .",
    "@xcite  for the last equality ) .",
    "the level density is also gaussian as @xmath162 for the so - called `` embedded gaussian ensemble '' ( egoe )  @xcite in random matrix theory .",
    "note , however , that in the egoe this property is valid provided that the number of one - particle states tends to infinity faster than @xmath1 .",
    "this additional condition clearly does not hold in our case , since the number of one - particle states ( i.e. , @xmath15 ) is fixed .",
    "another characteristic feature of the egoe is the fact that the nearest - neighbor spacing distribution @xmath163 is approximately given by wigner s law @xmath164 as for the classical gaussian orthogonal ensemble  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , since the hs spin chain is integrable , one would expect that its nearest - neighbor spacing distribution obey poisson s law @xmath165 , according to the conjecture of berry and tabor for a generic integrable model  @xcite .",
    "this conjecture has been verified for a variety of integrable many - body problems , such as the heisenberg chain , the @xmath166-@xmath167 model , the hubbard model  @xcite , and the chiral potts model  @xcite .",
    "one of the main results of this paper is the fact that the nearest - neighbor spacing distribution of the hs chain deviates substantially from both wigner s and poisson s laws .    in order to correctly take into account the effect of the local level density in the study of @xmath163",
    ", one must first apply to the `` raw '' spectrum the so - called _ unfolding _ mapping  @xcite .",
    "this mapping is defined by decomposing the cumulative level density @xmath168 as the sum of a fluctuating part @xmath169 and a continuous part @xmath170 , which is then used to transform each energy @xmath144 , @xmath171 , into an unfolded energy @xmath172 . the function @xmath163 is defined as the density of the normalized spacings @xmath173 , where @xmath174 is the mean spacing of the unfolded energies . by the previous discussion , in our case we can take the unfolding mapping @xmath170 as the cumulative gaussian distribution @xmath157 with parameters @xmath145 and @xmath146 given by the previous formulas . as for the level density , to compare the discrete distribution function @xmath163 with a continuous distribution it is more convenient to work with the cumulative spacing distribution @xmath175 .",
    "our computations for a wide range of values of @xmath1 and @xmath15 show that @xmath176 is essentially different from either poisson s or wigner s law , since its slope tends to infinity both as @xmath177 and @xmath178 , where @xmath179 is the largest spacing .",

    "the fit of the distribution to the data is quite good , the mean square error never exceeding @xmath199 .",
    "we have performed a similar analysis for @xmath155 and @xmath200 , obtaining totally analogous results .",
    "the divergence of the nearest - neighbor spacing distribution @xmath163 for small @xmath202 is probably related to the flatness of the tail of the gaussian distribution .",
    "it could also be argued that , since the haldane  shastry chain is completely integrable , the full spectrum is a superposition of the spectra of the hamiltonian restricted to subspaces of common eigenfunctions of a suitable family of commuting first integrals .",
    "it is well known , in this respect , that a superposition of a large number of unrelated spectra leads to a sharp increase in the number of very small spacings  @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", we do not have a clear explanation of the fact that @xmath163 also diverges when @xmath202 approaches the largest spacing @xmath179 .",
    "this fact , which certainly deserves further study , could be a characteristic property of all spin chains of haldane  shastry type .",
    "our results also imply that berry and tabor s conjecture does not hold for the hs spin chain , even if we restrict ourselves to a subspace of the whole hilbert space with well - defined quantum numbers .",
    "indeed , the nearest - neighbor spacing distribution of the superposition of even a small number of spectra with poisson - distributed spacings must also be of poisson type  @xcite . as an illustration of these assertions , we present in fig .",

    "it is apparent from this plot that @xmath176 is neither poissonian nor of wigner type , and that it is well approximated by a function of the form   for spacings @xmath204 .",
    "it is also clearly noticeable that @xmath163 tends to infinity as @xmath202 approaches the maximum spacing @xmath205 .",
    "( solid dots ) for states with zero total spin and odd parity when @xmath203 and @xmath14 . for comparison purposes ,",
    "we have represented poisson s ( long dashes ) and wigner s ( short dashes ) cumulative distributions.[fixspin],width=302 ]    the non - poissonian behavior of the spacing distribution could in principle be due to finite - size effects @xcite .",
    "although this possibility should be explored in more detail , our data clearly show that the cumulative spacing distribution @xmath176 is of the form   for a wide range of values of @xmath206 .",
    "note , finally , that an interesting integrable model not obeying the berry",
