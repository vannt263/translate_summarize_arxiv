    "one primary goal of medium energy nuclear collisions is a detailed study of the thermodynamic properties of strongly interacting nuclear matter @xcite .",

    "relativistic heavy ion collisions are being used to explore a second phase transition from hadronic matter made of mesons and baryons to a quark - gluon phase .",
    "important differences exist between the nuclear interaction and interaction between atoms .",
    "because nuclei are made of neutrons and protons , the phase transition is in a two component or binary system where symmetry energy effects and coulomb effects play an important role .",
    "moreover , the nuclear force has a velocity dependence . the presence of symmetry energy and a coulomb interaction effects and also a velocity dependence in the nuclear interaction makes the nuclear case a unique and interesting binary system within the general scope of such systems .",

    "the two components are spin - up and spin down fluids .",

    "nucleons carry spin but very little research has been done in understanding the role of spin in the liquid gas phase structure",
    ". however , the crust of neutron stars has features associated with a superfluid phase .",
    "an early study of the nuclear liquid - gas phase transition @xcite treated the system as a one component system of nucleons .",
    "this study was then extended to two components using a skyrme interaction @xcite .",
    "a relativistic mean field model was also developed in ref.@xcite where the role of the symmetry energy was studied in detail .",
    "the addition of the coulomb energy @xcite resulted in asymmetries which changed the mechanical and chemical instability regions and binodal surface in pressure @xmath1 , temperature @xmath2 and proton fraction @xmath3 associated with phase coexistence . for one component systems a phase diagram is the more familiar binodal curve of pressure versus density or volume determined by a maxwell construction .",

    "we have used a somewhat simplified description of the velocity dependence of the nuclear interaction . in particular",
    "we have used a density dependent effective mass approximation .",
    "effective mass approximations are frequently used in physics to capture the main effects and they lead to a simpler set of equations and a corresponding simpler analysis . as noted we still keep coulomb and surface terms which are present in realistic nuclear systems .",
    "it is the interplay of volume , surface , symmetry and coulomb and momentum dependent terms that is studied here .",
    "in fact , the interplay of such terms makes nuclei a unique system for studying phase transitions , chemical and mechanical instability in binary systems .",
    "we then applied the basic thermodynamic relations that we developed to issues related to the mechanical and chemical instability of nuclei and features associated with a liquid / gas phase transition in this system .",
    "because of the two component nature of real nuclear systems , the analysis involves a study of the behavior in proton fraction , density and temperature ( @xmath226 ) and also proton fraction , pressure and temperature ( @xmath227 ) .",
    "we studied systems with proton fraction @xmath178 , where @xmath158 corresponds to a system of pure neutrons and @xmath162 is for a system of pure protons .",

    "the study of nuclear system with arbitrary proton / neutron ratios is also important for future rib experiments and for medium energy collisions where the liquid / gas phase transition is studied experimentally . in a liquid / gas phase transition",
    "the liquid and gas phase have different proton fractions because of symmetry and coulomb effects .",
    "the proton fraction in the liquid phase reflects a more symmetric system than the gas phase where a higher asymmetry exists .",
    "the process of producing a larger neutron excess in the gas phase is referred to as isospin fractionation and a review can be found in ref.@xcite .",
    "the process is modified somewhat by the coulomb interaction which leads to proton diffusion of some protons from the liquid phase back into the gas phase as discussed in ref.@xcite .",
    "one of the unique aspects of the nuclear systems is a velocity or momentum dependence in the two body interaction . here , we also study the role of this momentum dependence first in the thermodynamic properties of the system .",
    "then , we extend the discussion of its role to nuclear instabilities and phase transitions and make a comparison with the case without momentum dependence .",
    "a characteristic pattern of qualitative similarities and quantitative differences appear between a momentum or velocity dependent skryme interaction and a momentum or velocity independent skryme interaction .",
    "these patterns can be seen in fig.[fig1]-[fig9 ] and are discussed in detail in sect.[rsltsec ] which we briefly summarizes now .",
    "fig.[fig1 ] shows that the momentum dependence increases the pressure at a given density .",
    "fig.[fig2 ] and fig.[fig4 ] show proton fraction versus density and chemical potential versus density at several pressures and at a fixed temperature .",
    "the qualitative features are the same between momentum dependent and momentum independent forces",
    ". however , sizeable quantitative differences are present between the two types of interactions .",
    "for example the solid loops ( momentum dependent interaction ) in proton fraction versus density of fig.[fig2 ] are reduced versions of the same dashed loops ( momentum independent interaction ) .",
    "similarly , the chemical instability boundaries for a momentum dependent skryme interaction are found to be reduced versions of the same boundaries for momentum independent skyrme interactions as can be seen from fig.[fig5 ] and a comparison of the thin curves of fig.[fig6][fig9 ] with the corresponding thick curves of these figures .",
    "fig.[fig5 ] also shows that momentum dependent terms reduce the height of the proton rich asymmetric loop ( @xmath215 ) and leave the height of the neutron asymmetric loop ( @xmath216 ) almost unchanged while the lowest pressure point , which is the point of equal concentration @xmath153 , is shifted upward with the value of @xmath153 nearly unchanged . from fig.[fig5 ] we also see that the chemical instability loop lie on top of each other for proton and neutron as required by the general connection of eq.([dmupn ] ) .",
    "also seen is that the chemical instability loop is inside the coexistence loop and tangent to it at the maxima of each loop .",
    "the largest and smallest @xmath3 in the coexistence loops are shifted inward towards the point of equal concentration @xmath153 .",
    "figs.[fig6 ] and [ fig7 ] shows that the mechanical instability loop is inside the chemical instability loop and tangent at the equal proton fraction @xmath146 without touching it at the peak of them .",
