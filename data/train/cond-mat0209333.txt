    "in this work we address the question of chaos in temperature in the sherringhton - kirkpatrick ( sk ) model .",
    "according to the parisi solution @xcite the sk model has many equilibrium states at a given temperature .",
    "these states are correlated : the overlap between different states can take a whole range of values from zero to the self - overlap @xmath1 .",
    "a natural and simple question is : what is the overlap between states at different temperatures ? according to the chaos in temperature hypothesis the overlap between any couples of equilibrium states at different temperatures is zero .",
    "consequently , the probability distribution of the overlap of configurations equilibrated at different temperatures @xmath2 should be a delta function centered at @xmath3",
    ". one can be more quantitative considering the convergence to a delta function of the function @xmath4 corresponding to a finite system size @xmath5 .",
    "standard arguments tell us that for large @xmath5 this quantity is given by the large - deviations formula @xmath6 \\label{pnq}\\ ] ] the quantity @xmath7 is the free - energy cost , _",
    "i.e. _ the difference between the free energy of a system of two copies at different temperatures of a spin - glass with the same realization of the disorder constrained to have a given value @xmath8 of the overlap , and the sum of the free energies at temperatures @xmath9 and @xmath10 ( actually here and in the following we call  free energy \" the opposite of the logarithm of the partition function , without the usual @xmath11 factors )",
    ". consequently we can talk of a small or large chaos effect depending on the function @xmath12 ; if @xmath12 is small the convergence with @xmath5 of the @xmath4 will be slower and the chaos effect will be seen only when considering large - size systems . in particular",
    "if @xmath13 turns out to be zero for a finite range of values of the constraint there is no extensive chaos ; furthermore a null @xmath14 is expected if the @xmath2 is definitely different from a delta centered on zero . in the following",
    "we shall compute the quantity @xmath13 .    in a recent paper @xcite ,",
    "one of us reexamined the problem through a perturbative expansion in the replica framework , showing that chaos , if at all present , should be a very small effect .",
    "actually , this is a quite old problem @xcite , and has gained new attention in connection with the experimental effects of memory and rejuvenation ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "recently some interesting results have been found for other models .",
    "sales and yoshino @xcite have convincingly shown that there is chaos in the directed polymer in random media ( dprm ) in 1 + 1 dimensions due to the interplay between energy and entropy , a mechanism which had been postulated in the droplet theory for finite dimensional spin - glass @xcite .",
    "on the other hand the existence of high correlations between systems at different temperatures has been proved in a well known class of mean - field spin - glass models @xcite .",
    "some evidence against chaos in the naive tap equations has been found in @xcite , a result which has been questioned in @xcite .",
    "powerful numerical efforts have been devoted by billoire and marinari ( bm ) to investigate chaos in temperature in the sk model @xcite ; even though they do nt actually see the effect , there is some evidence that it may be extremely weak , thus observable only on very large lattices .",
    "in the replica framework one obtains a variational expression for the free - energy functional @xmath15 of two systems with a constraint @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "we have expressed @xmath15 in terms of a parisi differential equation .",
    "the variational parameters are three @xmath17 matrices @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 : @xmath21 the function @xmath22 is defined through the following differential equation : @xmath23 with initial condition : @xmath24 + 2 e^{-\\delta}\\cosh[\\beta_1y_1-\\beta_2 y_2 ] ] \\label{inif}\\ ] ] @xmath25 notice that the initial condition depends on the difference @xmath26 . in order to maximize the free energy functional lagrange multipliers @xmath27 are used much as in the standard single system problem @xcite , then introducing the following quantities @xmath28 and the operator @xmath29 the saddle - point ( sp ) equations for the constrained systems read : @xmath30 @xmath31 @xmath32 the initial conditions for the functions @xmath33 , @xmath34 can be obtained from ( [ inif ] ) and ( [ defm ] ) ; for @xmath27 we find @xmath35 the presence of a constraint @xmath16 leads to the following equation @xmath36-e^{-\\delta}\\cosh[\\beta_1y_1-\\beta_2 y_2 ] } { e^{\\delta}\\cosh [ \\beta_1 y_1+\\beta_2 y_2]+ e^{-\\delta}\\cosh[\\beta_1y_1-\\beta_2 y_2]}\\ .\\label{eqq_c}\\ ] ] if @xmath37 the initial condition ( [ inif ] ) separates and eq .",
    "( [ eqq_c ] ) implies @xmath38 .",
    "finally , we recall that the derivative of the free energy with respect to the constraint can be expressed as @xmath39",
    "when @xmath41 there are two possible situations depending on the value of the constraint @xmath16 . for all values of @xmath16 inside the support of the overlap distribution function @xmath2 we have solutions with @xmath37 and therefore @xmath42 . as a consequence for @xmath43 we have @xmath44 as it is to be expected since the function @xmath2 is non trivial .",
    "the solutions of the sp equations satisfy @xmath45 and are : @xmath46 these solutions were first proposed in @xcite for the truncated model . in @xcite it has been proven that they exist in any models with replica - symmetry breaking ( rsb ) by noticing that they are a permutation of the standard parisi solution .",
    "when @xmath16 lies outside the support of the function @xmath2 there are off - equilibrium solutions of the sp equations with @xmath47 and @xmath48 @xcite .",
    "these solutions can be obtained by solving the sp equations ( [ sp1],[sp2],[sp3 ] ) perturbatively in @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "this has been done at the lower orders in @xcite where it was found that near the critical temperature the free - energy difference grows with @xmath51 in the off - equilibrium region .",
    "we pushed the computation to very high orders and we can safely claim that there are no @xmath52 terms in the expansion . recently",
    "this result was confirmed numerically @xcite .",
    "the off - equilibrium phase can be described also by considering what happens for @xmath53 rather then for @xmath54 . in the following section we will discuss this limit which can also be used to obtain another series expansion .",
    "in this case the only possible couples of configurations are those in which a configuration is coupled with itself .",
    "it is easy to realize that the thermodynamics of such a constrained system is equal to that of a single system at temperature @xmath56 .",
    "it is also natural that @xmath48 . by looking at equation ( [ eqq_c ] )",
    "we see that @xmath55 requires @xmath57 . in this case",
    "the initial conditions on @xmath58 and @xmath59 read @xmath60\\ ] ] by making the change of variables @xmath61 the sp equations ( [ sp1],[sp2],[sp3 ] ) reduce to those of a single system at temperature @xmath62 , as expected .",
    "the case @xmath41 has been recently discussed in @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to notice that the constrained model with @xmath55 has a critical temperature whose value is exactly twice as the critical temperature of the free model . therefore if we consider a couple of constrained systems such that @xmath63 , @xmath64 but @xmath65 we shall have a phase transition from a paramagnetic replica - symmetric ( rs ) phase to a rsb phase by changing the value of the constraint @xmath16 . for completeness",
    "we report the paramagnetic rs solution of the sp equations : @xmath66 notice that @xmath67 is divergent for @xmath68 ; therefore , according to ( [ pepsi ] ) , the derivative of the free - energy is divergent too .",
    "this result is valid also in the rsb phase . for @xmath69 , @xmath70 the critical value of the constraint @xmath71 turns out to be @xmath72 . for @xmath16 near @xmath73",
    "the order parameter is small and we solved the equations perturbatively in @xmath74 .",
    "we also obtained a perturbative expansion for @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath53 .",
    "indeed , in this region the three functions @xmath77 , @xmath78 and @xmath79 are small since the value @xmath55 corresponds to a free system at a temperature near @xmath80 .",
    "region is much smaller than in the figure . ]",
    "in @xcite an analytical picture for the absence of chaos in spin - glasses was proposed based on the possible existence of specific solutions of the sp equations ( [ sp1],[sp2],[sp3 ] ) .",
    "the structure of these solutions is depicted in figure ( [ figure1 ] ) : in the small-@xmath82 region the three functions @xmath83 and @xmath79 are all different till they reach the point @xmath84 where @xmath85 ; then for @xmath82 greater than @xmath84 @xmath79 remains constant while @xmath86 and @xmath87 after an intermediate plateau are connected continuously to the corresponding free parisi solutions .",
    "these solutions may exist for values of the constraint from zero to a maximum value where the two plateaus of the function at the higher temperature merge ( @xmath88 in figure ( [ figure1 ] ) ) .",
    "these solutions reduce to eq .",
    "( [ soliso ] ) in the limit @xmath89 and are intrinsically non - chaotic due to the relation @xmath37 @xcite .",
    "however , their existence must be checked explicitly by attempting to solve the sp equations ( [ sp1],[sp2],[sp3 ] ) with the ansatz @xmath37 . in @xcite",
    "this has been checked up to the fifth order in a perturbative expansion near the critical temperature , _",
    "i.e. _ it has been found that @xmath14 is a quantity smaller than the fifth order .",
    "recently it has been proven that these solutions exist in the spherical spin - glass models with multi-@xmath90 spin interaction @xcite . in that context",
    "it has been shown that they imply ultrametricity between the equilibrium states at different temperatures so that the parisi tree is essentially the same at all temperatures .",
    "furthermore , arguments have been advanced in order to show that the reference free energies of the clusters of states do not change with temperature , much as in the generalized random - energy model .",
    "perfect ultrametricity is a special property of those models due to the fact that the functions @xmath77 , @xmath78 and @xmath79 are all equal in the small-@xmath82 region . in general , however , we believe that the physical interpretation of the solutions proposed in @xcite is similar . indeed , we think that the non - chaotic solutions proposed in @xcite are the mathematical implementation of the old idea of a unique parisi tree which bifurcates when lowering the temperature plus the additional hypothesis that the ordering of the reference free energies of the clusters of states does not change when lowering the temperature . it would be interesting to check whether the logical equivalence between these solutions and the previous picture can be established explicitly through the cavity method as was done for the parisi solution @xcite .      in order to deal with the sp equations ( [ sp1],[sp2],[sp3 ] ) of the sk model we resorted to a high - order computer - assisted perturbative expansion using the methods we recently applied to the parisi solution @xcite . the procedure is conceptually straightforward : one tries to solve the sp equations with the non - chaotic ansatz of figure ( [ figure1 ] ) assuming that near the critical temperature the functions @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 are small and the @xmath82 regions where they vary are also small",
    ". therefore one expands all the quantities of interest in series of @xmath91 , @xmath82 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 and @xmath16 , ( @xmath94 ) ; the first is of order @xmath95 , the others are of order 1 ; the function @xmath96 , which is singular , can be treated considering its @xmath91 cumulants .",
    "this is essentially the same computation that was carried on in @xcite by hand up to the fifth order of the free - energy .",
    "it was found that up to that relatively high order the sp equations admit of a non - chaotic solution with @xmath37 for values of @xmath16 between @xmath97 and some maximum value near the self - overlap of the states at the higher temperature .",
    "instead we have found that at ninth order in the free energy it is impossible to find a solution of the sp equation ( [ sp1],[sp2],[sp3 ] ) with @xmath37 : _ the non - chaotic solutions do nt exist in the sk model_. accordingly there must be a free - energy cost in imposing the constraint , which one expects to be of ninth order .",
    "since off - equilibrium solutions must have @xmath47 , things become very complicated ; indeed , as explained in @xcite , when @xmath47 the three functions @xmath77 , @xmath78 and @xmath79 are coupled in the whole small-@xmath82 region , _",
    "i.e. _ if one of them is varying in some interval of @xmath82 the others must vary too .",
    "we guess that off - equilibrium solutions have the same structure of the non chaotic solutions of figure ( [ figure1 ] ) plus small corrections of order @xmath98 , which is expected to be of the seventh order .",
    "therefore we have tried to solve the sp equations ( [ sp1],[sp2],[sp3 ] ) with a complicated ansatz made up of five @xmath82 regions on each of whom the functions @xmath77 , @xmath78 and @xmath79 have a different expansion .",
    "unfortunately , in spite of the very high number of parameters of this ansatz , we have not been able to solve the sp equations ( [ sp1],[sp2],[sp3 ] ) explicitly .",
    "therefore , in order to estimate the free - energy cost we plugged the same ansatz directly into equations ( [ f ] , [ eqf ] ) and extremized the free energy with respect to the variational parameters .",
    "we obtained the following estimate for the free - energy cost of constraining two copies of a sk spin - glass at temperature @xmath99 and @xmath100 to have a fixed overlap @xmath16 : @xmath101 as expected , this quantity turns out to be of the ninth order .",
    "let us comment that although in principle this must be considered an upper bound for the real value , it is most likely exact .",
    "indeed , in @xcite we observed that the order of the function @xmath102 relevant for the exact value of the free energy is much lower than the one expected by power counting arguments ; for instance if we maximize the free energy at order @xmath103 , we are able to determine the order parameter at an order near @xmath104 rather than the order @xmath105 obtained by power counting .",
    "therefore even if we know that our ansatz is unable to reproduce the correct solution at the seventh order , most likely this has no influence on the value of the free energy at the ninth order .    ,",
    "@xmath78 and @xmath79 obtained numerically for @xmath106 , @xmath107 and @xmath108 .",
    "the dotted lines represent the corresponding free solutions . within the numerical precision",
    "they coincide with those of figure ( [ figure1 ] ) ; the accuracy could be raised by the methods discussed in @xcite ]    .",
    "[ figcris ]      we also integrated the sp equations numerically _ via _ a pseudo - spectral code as we did in @xcite for the standard parisi solution .",
    "since the fields have three variables , time and memory required by the computation grow and the obtainable precision decreases , preventing us from seeing the chaos effect . the advantage of this method , however , is that we can investigate the form of the solutions in a non - perturbative way . to obtain the three functions @xmath77 , @xmath78 and @xmath79",
    ", we applied the iterative scheme of @xcite to the sp equations ( [ sp1],[sp2],[sp3 ] ) ; we imposed at each iteration @xmath109 and we set by hand @xmath37 ; indeed @xmath98 is expected to be much smaller than the attainable precision . consistently with this assumption , the free - energy cost computed integrating ( [ f ] ) and ( [ eqf ] ) turned out to be zero within the precision .",
    "remarkably the three functions @xmath77 , @xmath78 and @xmath79 have precisely the structure proposed in @xcite ( cfr .",
    "figures ( [ figure1 ] ) and ( [ figcris ] ) ) .",
    "the chaos effect determines small corrections which should be seen at higher precision .",
    "when @xmath16 is greater than some @xmath110 the plateau of the function @xmath79 stops at @xmath110 irrespective of @xmath16 , and in order to obtain higher values of @xmath79 we should impose a finite value of @xmath98 . in the isothermal case this happens when one goes out of equilibrium for @xmath111 ; when @xmath112 this effect marks a change in the behaviour of @xmath14 which is much larger for @xmath113 ( see discussion in the conclusions ) .",
    "we believe that the chaos effect is beyond the attainable numerical precision of our code at the present , while improvements for the functions @xmath77 , @xmath78 and @xmath79 are at hand .",
    "we settled the longstanding problem of chaos in temperature in the sk model : _ chaos in temperature is present but it is an exceedingly small effect : @xmath14 is a ninth order quantity_. the analytical picture for absence of chaos in temperature proposed in @xcite does nt apply to the sk model , while it holds in the multi-@xmath90 spin spherical models @xcite ; this is an important difference between these two models whose behaviour has been often assumed to be similar .",
    "the effect is so weak that it ca nt be observed in present numerical simulations . indeed , if we make an estimate for the function @xmath4 through the equations ( [ pnq ] ) and ( [ df ] ) with parameters @xmath114 , @xmath115 and @xmath116 , which are the temperatures and size investigated in the latest numerical work by billoire and marinari ( bm ) @xcite , we find a completely flat function ; therefore we do nt expect to see anything similar to the delta peak corresponding to the @xmath117 limit .",
    "we notice that other corrections must be considered in order to explain those data ; indeed , according to our results , a formula like @xmath118 $ ] in any case would give a @xmath4 with an absolute maximum in @xmath3 .",
    "although we have not been able to determine exactly the off - equilibrium solutions corresponding to a non - zero constraint , we believe that they are similar to the non - chaotic solutions proposed in @xcite plus small correction of order @xmath119 ; this is supported by the numerical integration of the sp equations ( see fig .",
    "[ figcris ] ) . as a consequence",
    "some of the features of the non - chaotic models discussed in @xcite are valid in the sk model at finite @xmath5 .",
    "for instance , we expect that the support of the function @xmath4 has a maximum @xmath110 located near the self - overlap @xmath120 of the system at the higher temperature . in the spherical models",
    "this happens because @xmath44 for @xmath121 and @xmath122 for @xmath123 ; instead in the sk model @xmath110 marks a crossover in the behaviour of the function @xmath14 which is ninth order for @xmath124 while for @xmath125 is much larger , most likely third order as in the isothermal case .",
    "this is clearly seen in the numerical simulations of bm and also confirms their hypothesis that the approach to a delta function does nt proceed by a splitting of the peak at @xmath110 but rather by the emergence of a third peak in @xmath3 ."
