    "we are living in an interesting time for particle physics . the cern large hadron collider ( lhc )",
    "experiment will start this year and may show exciting results soon .",
    "also recent significant developments of cosmological and astrophysical observations have improved our knowledge of particle physics .",
    "the fact that the large fraction of matter in the universe is not accounted for by standard model particles motivates further considerations for the role of hypothetical particles in the early universe and the connection to collider physics .",
    "recent theoretical studies have shown the possibility of extremely long - lived charged massive particles(champs )  @xcite .",
    "the search for champs and the determination of it s properties may be an exciting challenge for future collider experiments and cosmological observations .    under continuous efforts in the past decade , the standard big bang nucleosynthesis(sbbn )",
    "theory has been well established to precisely predict the primordial light element abundances  @xcite and may be used as a probe to find or constrain new physics beyond the standard model in the late time universe  @xcite .",
    "as recent papers have pointed out  @xcite , if extremely long - lived champs existed in the early universe , such a champ might constitute a bound state with a light element after / during the bbn era and modify the sbbn prediction of light element abundances .",
    "this might constrain the number density of long - lived champs depending on the lifetime .    the cosmological constraints on thermally frozen long - lived champs",
    "have been discussed  @xcite . in most of these papers , the standard radiation dominated universe during the freeze - out of champs was assumed .",
    "in such a standard scenario , the relic density @xmath2 and the number density @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the mass of the champ , which implies severe constraint for heavier mass .",
    "recent analysis showed that the entire mass region may be disfavored by bbn if the lifetime is longer than @xmath0sec  @xcite.sec , this conclusion may be changed once champs are captured by protons  @xcite ]    on the other hand , above bbn constraints may not exclude the possibility of the discovery of champs with lifetime @xmath5sec .",
    "the violation of the above constraints does not necessarily mean contradictions but may indicate an evidence of additional new physics or lack of understanding of astrophysics .",
    "from this point of view , the importance of searching for extremely long - lived massive particles was also discussed in the context of the supersymmetric theory with a gravitino lsp  @xcite .    in this paper , we discuss a possible impact of the discovery of extremely long - lived champs to explore the nature of the reheating of the universe , where the standard scenario has assumed the radiation dominated universe during and after the thermal freeze - out of the champ relic density until the time when the present matter dominated the enegy of the universe against the radiation .",
    "we focus on a low reheating temperature model as the possibility of the nonstandard universe and extract constraints on the theoretical parameters .",
    "we calculate the relic density of champs frozen during / after reheating and estimate the cbbn prediction of primordial @xmath1li abundance by using a recent estimation of the nuclear reaction rate  @xcite and without assuming the saha equation for bound state formation of a champ and a @xmath6he .",
    "we will find that the cbbn prediction of @xmath1li is sensitive to the number density of champs and the lifetime around @xmath7sec .",
    "if the lifetime is longer than @xmath0 sec , the comparison between observed @xmath1li and the cbbn prediction can impose a relevant constraint on the reheating temperature , which may potentially become an interesting restriction on some class of models of reheating after inflation or models of late time entropy production  @xcite .",
    "here we consider the champ production during / after reheating of the universe .",
    "it is believed that the reheating of the universe results from the thermalization of the decay products from the decay of coherent oscillations of a scalar field or the decay of some heavy massive particles such as moduli or gravitinos which do not thermalize with the thermal bath of sm particles after the energy dominated the universe .",
    "here we consider reheating due to the decay of a scalar field @xmath8 .",
    "for the case of a heavy massive particle such as moduli or gravitino , a similar discussion to this paper can be applied  @xcite .",
    "the reheating temperature is defined by @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the decay rate of the scalar field @xmath8 , @xmath11 is the number of massless degree of freedom at temperature @xmath12 and @xmath13gev . in this paper",
    ", we call this a @xmath14 reheating temperature scenario in which most of the decays of the scalar field @xmath8 occur after freeze - out of champs .",
    "the importance of particle productions during the reheating era and the difference from the standard radiation dominated universe in thermally frozen nonrelativistic particles was discussed in  @xcite .",
    "we estimate the relic density of heavy charged species as a function of the mass and reheating temperature .",
    "we consider a simple reheating model described by the following equations  @xcite .",
    "@xmath15\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\frac{d n_c}{dt}+3hn_c = -<\\sigma v>[n_c^2-n_{\\text{eq}}^2]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 are energy densities of the @xmath8 field and radiation , @xmath19 is the hubble parameter , @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "the kinetic equilibrium for champs and radiations is assumed . also we assumed that champs annihilate into radiation or the particles in the final state rapidly convert into radiation .",
    "as the initial condition , we use @xmath22 , @xmath23 .",
    "the initial hubble parameter @xmath24 is taken significantly early before the completion of reheating at @xmath25 and the freeze - out of champs .    in this paper",
    ", we do not consider more complicated cases of reheating after inflation and assume that this is the last reheating of the universe .",
    "but notice that @xmath23 may not always be satisfied if this reheating occurs after the universe went through radiation dominated once as a result of earlier reheating  @xcite .    here",
    "notice that we have assumed two things .",
    "first , we assumed that the branching ratio of the @xmath8 decay into champs and the secondary production of champs due to the @xmath8 decay products are negligible during reheating .",
    "if the branching ratio is not small enough , we have to take into account the additional nonthermal contribution to the champ relic after champs freeze - out  @xcite .",
    "the simple solution would be @xmath26 and the other possibility was also discussed in @xcite .",
    "second , we do not consider the significant amount of decays of @xmath8 directly into hidden particles like gravitinos which has a very small coupling with standard model particles , that is , we assume that such a component of hidden particle does not exceed the relic density of present dark matter and does not overclose the universe .",
    "we are interested in the production of nonrelativistic particles during / after reheating . in this paper",
    ", we will use the analytical solution for thermally frozen champ relic density of the above differential equations  @xcite .",
    "the particle freeze out during reheating may be classified into two cases , the case that chemical equilibrium is not established before freeze - out , and the case that chemical equilibrium is established .",
    "the annihilation cross section determines which of the two cases applies .",
    "since we are interested in the production of champs , the minimal coupling would be the coupling with a photon . assuming _",
    "s_-wave processes dominates , we have @xmath27 where we take @xmath28 .",
    "chemical equilibrium during reheating era is established before freeze - out if @xmath29 } [ \\frac{m_c}{10 ^ 2\\text{gev}}]^{1/2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this condition follows from @xmath30 where @xmath31 for _ s_-wave corresponds to the temperature at which most of the production takes place  @xcite .",
    "notice that for the thermal freeze - out during reheating , the typical freeze - out temperature @xmath32 may be @xmath33 .",
    "if @xmath34 and the above condition is satisfied , the chemical equilibrium in champs will be established and the relic will freeze out during reheating , for example , for @xmath35 and @xmath36gev .    for the nonchemical equilibrium production ,",
    "the present time relic density of champs is @xmath37 ^3[\\frac{10 ^ 3 t_{\\text{rh}}}{m_c}]^7\\gamma\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    for the chemical equilibrium production , the final relic abundance is approximately given by @xmath38 and by taking account of the dilution of the frozen relic until the reheating completes .",
    "the hubble parameter during the reheating is @xmath39  @xcite .",
    "notice that @xmath40 during reheating , so that @xmath41  @xcite .",
    "then , @xmath42 \\frac{t_{\\text{rh}}^3\\text{gev}^{-2}}{\\gamma m_c x_f^{-4}}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath43 .",
    "the freeze - out temperature is fixed by the solution of @xmath44 .",
    "@xmath45\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here we implicitly assume that the maximum temperature is higher than the freeze out temperature , which may constrain the initial energy density of the @xmath8 field .",
    "this case reduces to the known thermal freeze - out formula within a few 10 percent differences if we take the limit @xmath46 .",
    "that is , in this limit , eliminating dilution , @xmath47 \\frac{m_c^2\\text{gev}^{-2}}{\\gamma x_f^{-1}}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath48\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this gives roughly @xmath49 .",
    "next we consider the impact of cbbn for the number density of champs .",
    "recently it has been pointed out that the bound state formation of a champ and a light element at lower temperature of the binding energy may change the nuclear reaction rates of bbn and eventually change the light elements abundance from sbbn  @xcite . especially pospelov pointed out that because of the strong electro - magnetic field due to the bound champ , cbbn may have significant changes in the nuclear reaction rates from sbbn s for radiative processes which are highly suppressed in sbbn  @xcite .",
    "the cbbn nuclear reaction rate for @xmath1li production has recently been evaluated by the use of the state - of - the - art coupled channel method  @xcite .",
    "we use the reaction rate here . for @xmath50kev , @xmath51    in this paper",
    ", we do not include decay effects and only consider effects of the cbbn on @xmath1li .",
    "actually in the case of sufficiently low abundances compared to the present dark matter relic density , the impact on @xmath1li due to the decays will not be significant  @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we consider the case where the number density is smaller than @xmath6he but larger than other light elements .",
    "then we can simplify the discussion of the capture of champs , that is , essentially the important part is only the capture by @xmath6he .",
    "since elements heavier than @xmath6he are extremely rare , if the number density @xmath52 , we can safely ignore the captures by elements other than @xmath6he to evaluate the number density of the bound state ( @xmath53,@xmath6he) .. he uses only a small fraction of champ .",
    "but if the number density is not small relative to @xmath6he abundance , the bound state formation with heavier elements might have some impact on evaluating the primordial abundance of such heavier elements through cbbn processes , for example , in @xmath54li , etc .",
    "@xcite ] after the capture by @xmath6he starts , the probability of champ captures by elements lighter than @xmath6he is extremely small and can be safely ignored until the capture of protons starts at @xmath55kev ( @xmath56 sec ) .",
    "once proton capture starts , the remaining free champs will be immediately captured by protons . in this paper",
    ", we do not consider the effect of the bound state with a proton which may have some impact on light element abundance including @xmath1li .",
    "the approximation will be safe for the case of @xmath57sec.li through @xmath58  @xcite .",
    "but the estimation assumed that the nuclear reaction does not have coulomb suppression and the stability of the bound state during nuclear reaction , which may not be a good approximation for the case of proton captures because the bohr radius of the bound state is large relative to typical nuclear size .",
    "for the other bound sate with d , t , etc . would only contribute the small production of @xmath1li . ]    assuming that the reheating temperature is high enough for thermal bbn to occur , we solve following equations .",
    "@xmath59 where @xmath60 , @xmath61 where we take the binding energy of @xmath6he to a champ @xmath62311kev  @xcite .",
    "we use the following recombination cross section : @xmath63 where @xmath64  @xcite.he is assumed and only capture into the 1s state is considered .",
    "the estimation may have uncertainties from this assumption , the ignorance of the internal structure of nuclei and the contributions from captures into higher level , which directly reflct to the cbbn prediction . ] for a nonthermal photon emitted in the recombination process , we assume the rapid thermalization which would be valid in the deeply radiation dominated universe , that is , we always assume thermal distribution for photon and also kinetic equilibrium for all light elements .",
    "we evaluate @xmath1li abundance by use of eq.(11 ) .",
    "we assume the saha - type equation @xmath65 and @xmath66 for the number density of the bound state until @xmath67 kev , and connect to the set of differential equations of eq.(11 ) for temperature below 10 kev and numerically solved them . at @xmath6810 kev , since the photo - destruction rate @xmath69 and the bound state formation rate is also larger than the expansion rate of the universe in the third equation of eq(11 ) , the use of the saha equation would be a good approximation .",
    "failure of the saha approximation may happen if @xmath70 , when the rate of bound state formation is faster than the expansion rate of the universe .",
    "we also used a sbbn value for the light elements as the initial values .    in fig.1",
    ", we show a contour plot of @xmath1li abundance as a function of the lifetime and the number density of champs .",
    "since the cbbn reaction rate @xmath71 rapidly decreases due to the coulomb suppression , most of @xmath1li production occurs from @xmath72 10kev to a few kev . for a champ lifetime",
    "@xmath73 sec , the @xmath1li abundance is insensitive to @xmath74",
    ". also we found that the cbbn does not change d , @xmath6he abundances much through @xmath71 .    in the last part of this section",
    ", we will make a few remarks .",
    "first , since champs would be metastable , high energy injections at late time due to the decays are expected and they could change the value of several light element abundances .",
    "but notice that the amount of the energy injection is in princeple independent from the number density which can be constrained by our discussion .",
    "of course , in specific models , the effects may not be negligible .",
    "on the other hand , since the current good agreement with observations has disfavored large changes from sbbn predictions for d , @xmath6he , if we impose constraint on high energy injections from light elements other than @xmath1li , our evaluation of cbbn production of @xmath1li here still may provide the correct prediction .",
    "of course , the late time energy injection itself also can change @xmath1li without any big change of the other light elements if the energy release is large , which typically increases @xmath1li .",
    "the most stringent constraint on hadronic energy injections from several light elements is @xmath75 at @xmath76sec  @xcite , where @xmath77 is the injected energy due to the decay and @xmath78 is the hadronic branching ratio of the decay .",
    "roughly the above constraint implies that @xmath79 .",
    "similarly , for @xmath80sec , electromagnetic(em ) energy injections obtain @xmath81gev from @xmath1li / h  @xcite , where @xmath82 is the em branching ratio of the decay , that is , @xmath83 .",
    "the em constraints significantly weaken for @xmath84sec .",
    "we do not expect a significant change for @xmath1li abundance from our estimate in the region of fig.1 if @xmath77 is not large.he by champ decays  @xcite may provide additonal contributions to @xmath1li from @xmath85 in @xmath86sec .",
    "but the discussion in @xmath85 is still uncertain .",
    "also if the mass between champs and the decay product highly degenerate @xmath87 and the main decay mode happens through a coupling with a w - boson , new decay modes of bound states may have to be considered  @xcite .",
    "the destruction of @xmath1li through this new decay mode can be important only if the capture of @xmath1li process is efficient at @xmath88 kev . in this paper , these contributions have not been included . ]    next , if there is no significant charge asymmetry in the champ sector , the positively charged and negatively charged champs can annihilate into two photons , w / z or other sm particles . the energy release due to annihilation at @xmath8910kev",
    "was estimated as follow  @xcite : @xmath90 again comparing with @xmath91 , this effect would be irrelevant in most of the region of fig.1 .",
    "in our scenario , the primordial @xmath1li abundance depends sensitively on the reheating temperature . in fig.2 , assuming @xmath92sec , we show the contour plot for @xmath93 which corresponds to the present dark matter relic density , and the contour plot for @xmath94 where the number density of champs with @xmath95sec may explain the observed @xmath1li abundance @xmath96 .",
    "it is well - known that the sbbn prediction of primordial @xmath1li abundance@xmath97 is much below the observed value . for long - lived champ with @xmath95sec",
    ", the @xmath1li / h line may be a solution to explain the observed abundance of @xmath1li by the primordial origin . for the region above the line ,",
    "@xmath1li may be over - produced and potentially can constrain the reheating temperature for @xmath95sec .",
    "on the other hand , it will require the knowledge of the late time evolution of @xmath1li from the primordial era to the present time . as we can see in fig.1 ,",
    "if the lifetime is shorter than @xmath0sec , the constraint significantly weakens .",
    "a discovery of champs with lifetime longer than @xmath0sec at a collider may indicate reheating beyond the standard scenario and put an upper bound of the reheating temperature for the models we are considering in this paper .",
    "several collider bounds on the mass of champs exist . on the other hand ,",
    "the current most stringent constraint for champ not decaying inside a detector is 98 gev at 95@xmath98 c.l . from cern lep at @xmath99gev  @xcite .",
    "currently there is no model - independent constraint through drell - yan processes at the tevatron run - ii . in the lhc ,",
    "the bound may be extended up to 700gev for 100@xmath100 for an extremely long - lived charged slepton in the supersymmetric standard model  @xcite . for the mass regions within collider reach",
    ", the @xmath1li line suggests lower reheating temperature @xmath101 a few gev if @xmath92 sec .",
    "the realization of such a low reheating temperature may be a challenge for theoretical models after inflation .",
    "for the mass region above the collider reach , if such heavy champ decays into a highly degenerate neutral particle , the relic density of present dark matter may link to the relic density of the champs like superwimp dark matter scenario  @xcite and still their trace may appear in astrophysical observables .",
    "if heavy extremely long - lived champ keeps the tight coupling with baryon - photon fluid until it decays , the small scale power of primordial fluctuation of champs would be erased within the scale of the sound horizon at the decay time , which has an impact on the small scale structure formation of the universe  @xcite .",
    "to explain small scale problems like missing satellite problem , which may require damping of the power spectrum of dark matter at small scales , the lifetime @xmath102sec is preferred , where the cbbn @xmath1li production may be expected .",
    ".@xcite also the capture by @xmath6he will not disturb the discussion because the bound state would keep similar tight coupling with baryon - photon fluid to freely propagating case . also since @xmath103 ,",
    "the most of champs is captured by @xmath6he , so the conclusion may not be largely different from the case of no - capture . ] to avoid large free streaming effects and additional cosmological constraints such as the cosmic microwave background black - body spectrum , tiny mass degeneracy may be favored , which means @xmath104 is the interesting region .",
    "we can find that such an interesting spot appears for @xmath105gev and @xmath106 .",
    "the realization of the thermal leptogenesis scenario  @xcite may be possible if the maximum temperature is high enough to go through an electro - weak phase transition , which depends on initial energy density of the @xmath8 field .",
    "we considered extremely long - lived champs as a probe of the early universe .",
    "such champs could leave their trace in astrophysical observables . the primordial @xmath1li abundance in cbbn could be sensitive to the number density of extremely long - lived champs in the cosmic time @xmath107 sec , and if the reheating temperature of the universe is below the mass of the champs , in a model we considered in this paer , the relic abundance of the champs is also sensitive to the reheating temperature .",
    "that is , the observed @xmath1li may indicate some information of the nature of reheating of the universe .",
    "if the champ mass is within the future collider reach , the measurement of the decay properties and the lifetime of champs are interesting challenges in future experiments  @xcite .",
    "since the lifetime and several parameters associated with the relic abundance may be measured at collider experiments , by use of the inputs , we will be able to estimate the relic density of champs as a function of the reheating temperature and the effects on light element abundances .",
    "the further understanding of cbbn and late time evolution of @xmath1li from the primordial era to the present time will help to understand the reheating nature of the universe which may be a hidden part in the collider experiment itself .",
    "even if the mass range is outside of the collider reach , still the existence of champs may leave a trace on the power spectrum of the primordial fluctuation if the champ was the parent particle of the present superwimp dark matter  @xcite .    as one of the attractive possibilities ,",
    "the search for the superwimp sector , e.g. , in supersymmetric theory , is an interesting target in future collider experiments and cosmological observations .",

    "<S> we discuss the impact of charged massive particle big bang nucleosynthesis(cbbn ) to explore the nature of the reheating of the universe in the case that a new extremely long - lived charged massive particle(champ ) exists . </S>",
    "<S> if the mass of the champ is within collider reach and it s lifetime is longer than @xmath0sec , the comparison between the cbbn prediction and observed @xmath1li abundances may indicate nonstandard reheating in the early universe without relying on details of the decay properties . </S>",
    "<S> even if the champ mass is outside the reach of colliders , the cosmological considerations may provide a nontrivial hint for the existence of such very heavy long - lived champs from the late universe if the daughter particles are the dominant component of the present dark matter . </S>",
    "<S> we consider a low reheating temperature model as an example of the nonstandard reheating scenarios . </S>"
