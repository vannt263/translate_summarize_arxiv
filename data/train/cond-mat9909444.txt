    "it is well known that the direct interband electron transitions is the main mechanism of light absorption in pure semiconductors .",
    "these transitions are direct owing to the momentum conservation low for the excited electron .",
    "the momentum , which this electron obtains from the light wave ( @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the wavelength of the light ) , is small in comparison with the electron momentum in the crystal ( @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the electron wavelength ) .",
    "it is clear , however , that the momentum is not conserved if the absorption takes place at the crystal boundary or at the interface between two crystals .",
    "the possibility of indirect electron transitions at the interface results in enhancement of the absorption .",
    "this means that the considerable enhancement of light absorption has to be expected in porous and microcrystalline semiconductors where the share of the interface atoms is sufficiently large .",
    "this interface mechanism of light absorption becomes most important if indirect electron transitions are more preferable than the direct ones .",
    "this happens , first , in indirect - band - gap semiconductors where the electron transition to the side valley in the bulk should be accompanied by the electron - phonon or electron - impurity interaction .",
    "second , this happens in direct - forbidden - band - gap semiconductors where the direct electron transitions between the top of the valence band and the bottom of the conduction band are prohibited .",
    "both possibilities are considered in this paper .",
    "we investigate the frequency dependence of the absorption at the fundamental absorption edge and estimate the relative value of the interface absorption .",
    "we consider also the interband light absorption at a rough interface .",
    "such interface is characteristic for the intercrystallite boundary in porous and microcrystalline semiconductors .",
    "we consider the light absorption at the surface of the semiconductor quantum dot or the crystallite embedded in an insulator media .",
    "suppose that each size of the crystallite much exceeds the lattice constant . on this assumption",
    "the envelope function approximation is valid .",
    "moreover , this assumption allows us to consider the light absorption as inelastic scattering of the electron at the interface if the electron wavelength is sufficiently small .",
    "we introduce the cartesian coordinate system , where the @xmath4 axis is normal to the interface and assume that semiconductor occupies the region @xmath5 .",
    "the probability for the photon to be absorbed in the crystallite is @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the fundamental constants , @xmath9 is the photon frequency , @xmath10 is the refraction index , @xmath11 is the area of the crystallite side @xmath12 where the absorption is considered , @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the electron momenta , @xmath15 and @xmath16 are their @xmath4 components , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the energies of the electron in the conduction and valence bands . the electric field of the light is directed along the @xmath4 axis ; @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the wave functions of the electron before the excitation ( in the valence band ) and after it ( in the conduction band ) correspondingly .",
    "wave functions @xmath19 and @xmath20 are determined by the band structure of the crystallite and the boundary conditions for the envelope wave functions at the interface between the crystallite and the insulator .    to consider the coulomb interaction , which occurs between the exited electron and the hole in the valence band , we have to input the weight factor @xmath21 [ where @xmath22 , and @xmath23 is the effective bohr radius ] into the sum ( [ 1 ] ) @xcite .",
    "the coulomb interaction becomes important if the electron and the hole are too close to the band extrema , so that their wavelengths are large . in this case the electron density at the place where the hole is situated is not small .",

    "the limits of integration are determined by the region where the expressions under the square roots in the integrand are positive .",
    "let @xmath12 be the interface between semiconductor ( @xmath5 ) and an insulator ( @xmath31 ) . for a simple nondegenerate electron spectrum the boundary conditions for the envelope wave function at the plane interface can be written in the form @xcite : @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the parameters of the boundary conditions , which relate the envelopes at the _ different _ sites @xmath35 at the interface .",

    ", i.e. , the separation is of the order of the band width .",

    "there is two - fold advantage from the indirect electron transitions .",
    "first , they are allowed , i.e. , the dipole matrix element of the indirect transitions is not small .",
    "second advantage arises due to the large density of states for the electron in the conduction band .",
    "let us compare the interband transitions in the bulk of semiconductor @xmath218 and at the interface @xmath219 ( fig .",
    "the absorption is proportional to the density of electron states in each band .",
    "the density of states in the conduction band of tio@xmath217 essentially exceeds that in the valence band . nevertheless , it is the density of electron states in the valence band which determines the absorption in the bulk of crystal .",
    "this happens because of the momentum conservation law , which makes the electron states with the large momentums inaccessible for the exited electrons . on the contrary ,",
    "indirect electron transitions make such states accessible .",
    "we can use eq .",
    "( [ 10b ] ) to estimate the value of absorption coefficient of the microcrystalline direct - forbidden gap semiconductor : @xmath220 where @xmath221 is the absorption coefficient of the bulk monocrystal , @xmath222 is width of the valence band ( @xmath223mev and @xmath224ev for tio@xmath217 @xcite ) .",
    "thus , the interface mechanism of the absorption becomes comparable with the bulk one for the microcrystalline tio@xmath217 the mean size of the crystallite in which is @xmath225 nm .",
    "significant increase of optical absorption has been observed in the microcrystalline batio@xmath226 @xcite .",
    "we found that the absorption value and its frequency dependence at the fundamental absorption edge are sensitive to the structure of the interface .",
    "thus , essential increase of the absorption has to be expected at a smooth interface . for such interface the main size of the interface region ( i.e. , the region at the interface where one crystal structure changes into another ) much exceeds the lattice constant .",
    "it is found that @xmath227 at a smooth interface @xcite , so that @xmath228 , and the interband matrix element @xmath137 increases , because it no longer proportional to the small ratio @xmath229 [ see eqs .",
    "( [ 11.5 ] , [ 7b ] ) ] . indeed , the significant ( in 100 times ) enhancement of the light absorption has been observed at the interface a - si / mc - si  @xcite .",
    "the possible existence of the interface electron levels is essential for the optical properties of a sharp interface .",
    "energy position of these levels depends not only on the bordering materials , but also on the interface itself .",
    "structure of the interface as well as impurities and defects on it affect positions of these levels .",
    "their positions can be measured in optical experiments as the singularities in the absorption spectrum at the energies below the gap value .",
    "it seems that the electron interface level should be close to the valence band at least in wide - gap semiconductors .",
    "the interface level becomes empty then it is shifted too far off the top of the valence band .",
    "this results in a large surface charge and a strong band bending that is not favorable from the energetical point of view .",
    "nevertheless , the interface level can be shifted as the result of structure reconstruction of the interface .",
    "this reconstruction does not essentially affect the interatomic spaces or angles , but it makes the interface level to be closer to the top of the valence band .",
    "the roughness of the interface is one of the possible ways of such reconstruction .",
    "it follows from our consideration eq .",
    "( [ e8 ] ) that significant shift of the interface level occurs if the correlation length of rough interface is small ( @xmath230 ) . that causes the interface level to be closer to the band extremum .",
    "this is the particular case when the structure reconstruction of the interface decreases the interface energy .",
    "if so , then the rough interface becomes more favorable than the plane one .",
    "it seems strange that the interface roughnesses result in only the shift of the interface levels , but they ca nt be the origin of such levels . in other words , @xmath231 in eq .",
    "( [ e8 ] ) vanishes for an appropriate correlation function @xmath232 , but it always equal to zero if @xmath227 .",
    "this is the result of our assumption that the interface is smooth ( @xmath233 ) .",
    "perhaps , the interface level can be separated from the band extremum due to the interface roughnesses if @xmath234 .",
    "in that case the interface level arises as the result of the rearrangement of the chemical bonds at the rough interface .",
    "the value of @xmath235 eq .  ( [ chi ] ) determines the roughnesses influence on the absorption .",
    "this value is small , @xmath236 , if the interface electron levels are close to both bands extrema . in this case",
    "the main size @xmath203 of the region at the interface where the momentum nonconservation is possible is of the order of the electron wave length @xmath3 , so that the small roughnesses ca nt affect the absorption .",
    "this is not the case if both interface levels shift far apart of the bands extrema , then @xmath206 and @xmath235 value is of about or even exceeds unity .",
    "the roughnesses influence on the absorption is significant at the low frequencies when @xmath237 ; enhancement of absorption in this case is due to an effective increase of the number of the interface atoms ( @xmath238 ) in the vicinity of which the interface light absorption occurs ( fig .  4 ) .",
    "in conclusion , we show that the possibility of the momentum nonconservation at the interface leads to enhancement of the interband light absorption in small crystallites , the size of which is about a few @xmath239 nm . the interband absorption is sensitive to the interface electron levels ; namely , whether or not they are close to the bands extrema .",
    "the influence of the interface roughnesses is essential if these levels are not close to any or both conduction and valence bands .",
    "the effect of the roughnesses is two - fold .",
    "first , they result in the diffuse electron scattering at the interface .",
    "this leads to enhancement of the absorption due to the effective increase of the share of the interface atoms .",
    "second , roughnesses result in effective shift of the electron interface levels .",
