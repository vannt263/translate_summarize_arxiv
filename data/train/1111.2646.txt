    "entanglement plays a key role and is a resource in quantum information processing ( qip ) . in the last decades",
    ", much efforts have been put into study it in various physical systems , see for example refs . @xcite .",
    "while being widely considered to be something unique without classical counterpart , it is recently realized that entanglement reflects only one aspect of quantum correlation of a quantum state , there exist some other nonclassical correlations @xcite .",
    "one example is a model of qip in ref .",
    "@xcite , which outperforms its classical counterpart while without any entanglement .",
    "it is proposed that quantum discord ( qd ) @xcite , a different measure of quantum correlation , might be responsible for the power of this model @xcite .",
    "thus , entanglement and qd , and additionally some other measures all are important in describing nonclassical correlations for a quantum system .",
    "it is well acceptable that decoherence will cause decreasing of entanglement which may induce failure of the algorithms and various protocols of qip . on the other hand ,",
    "it is also of fundamental interest to study the behavior of nonclassical correlations with decoherence .",
    "recently , there are some studies in evaluating the relationships between nonclassical correlations quantified by qd and entanglement quantified by concurrence or entanglement of formation ( eof ) under the action of decoherence @xcite . also",
    "the role of qd in identifying critical points of quantum phase transitions are studied @xcite . for practical use",
    ", one may hope that the nonclassical correlations which are crucial for qip can be maintained for sufficiently long time so that the designed tasks can be fulfilled .",
    "however , the unavoidable interaction of a realistic system with its surroundings always makes it decaying with time . particularly , under certain circumstances ,",
    "the entanglement of a bipartite state can even terminate abruptly in a finite time , a phenomenon termed as entanglement sudden death ( esd ) by yu and eberly @xcite . for nonclaccical correlations as measured by qd and other similar quantities ,",
    "however , the sudden death phenomenon has not been observed ( this may be good for qip independent of entanglement ) , but their values may decay with time and become zero at discrete instants of time @xcite .",
    "thus it is of great importance to find ways to preserve them when the system is in contact with an environment which leads to decoherence .    in this paper",
    ", we offer a comparative study of the relationships between entanglement and different measures of nonclassical correlations for a certain family of two - qubit states .",
    "the system we considered consists of two atomic qubits with spontaneous emission @xcite .",
    "we will show that even in cases where entanglement disappears , nonclassical correlations persist in the whole time region . in this sense , they are more robust against decoherence than entanglement , implying that quantum algorithms based only on them may be more robust than those based on entanglement .",
    "moreover , we will show by explicit examples that robustness of quantum correlations can be greatly enhanced by performing local unitary operations to the initial states , though it is well - known that those measures of correlations themselves are invariant under local unitary operations @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we recall some measures of correlations for a bipartite state .",
    "we will adopt the eof as the measure of entanglement , and other nonclassical correlations will be quantified by the measurement induced disturbance ( mid ) , qd and the geometric measure of qd ( gmqd ) . in section iii , we introduce the model and compare characteristics of various correlation measures for a class of two - qubit states .",
    "we will also evaluate robustness of quantum correlations for different local unitary equivalent states .",
    "finally , section iv is devoted to a summary .",
    "the basic and crucial problem for studying dynamics of correlations of a composite system is to characterize and quantify correlation from different point of views in that system .",
    "the motivation of this study is to find whether those physical systems can be a platform for various tasks of qip . in this section ,",
    "we will first list several measures of quantum correlations for the bipartite states , and those measures will be applied in our study of the two - qubit atomic system .",
    "first , we still consider entanglement as one important quantum correlation . in order to study the entanglement dynamics for any two - qubit states , we adopt eof @xcite which is a well - accepted measure of entanglement .",
    "the definition is as follows , @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the binary shannon entropy , and @xmath2 is the time - dependent concurrence @xcite , which takes the form @xmath3 , where @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) are the square roots of the eigenvalues of the spin - flipped operator @xmath6 arranged in decreasing order , with @xmath7 being the complex conjugation of @xmath8 in the standard basis , and @xmath9 is one pauli matrix .",
    "besides entanglement , let us consider some other quantum correlations .",
    "the so - called mid , proposed recently by luo in ref .",
    "@xcite , is defined as the difference of two quantum mutual information respectively of a given state @xmath8 shared by two parties @xmath10 and @xmath11 and the corresponding post - measurement state @xmath12 , @xmath13 where the mutual information , @xmath14 , measures the total correlation , including both classical and quantum , for a bipartite state @xmath8 . here",
    "@xmath15 denotes the von neumann entropy , with @xmath16 and @xmath17 being the reduced density matrix of @xmath8 by tracing out @xmath11 and @xmath10 , respectively . while quantum mutual information of the state @xmath12 , @xmath18 , quantifies the classical correlation in @xmath8 , with @xmath19 , where the measurement is induced by the spectral resolutions of the reduced states @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "in fact , @xmath12 is a classical state ( a state is referred to as classical if it is invariant under local von neumann measurement ) for any complete set of projective measurements @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "@xmath12 defined above is actually the closest classical state to @xmath8 since this kind of measurement leaves the marginal information invariant and is in a certain sense the least disturbing @xcite .",
    "another well - accepted measure of nonclassical correlation is the qd @xcite .",
    "it was defined by the discrepancy between quantum mutual information and the classical aspect of correlation which was defined as the maximum information about one subsystem that can be obtained by performing a measurement on the other subsystem . if we restrict ourselves to the projective measurements performed locally on subsystem @xmath10 described by a complete set of orthogonal projectors @xmath24 , then the quantum state after measurement changes to @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the identity operator for subsystem @xmath11 , and @xmath27 $ ] is the probability for obtaining the measurement outcome @xmath28 on @xmath10 .",
    "the classical correlation can then be obtained by maximizing @xmath29 over all @xmath24 , where @xmath30 is a generalization of the classical conditional entropy of subsystem @xmath11 .",
    "explicitly , the qd is defined as the minimal difference between @xmath31 and @xmath32 as @xmath33 where the supremum is taken over the complete set of @xmath24 .",
    "the intuitive meaning of qd thus may be interpreted as the minimal loss of correlations due to measurement .",
    "it vanishes for states with only classical correlation and survives for states with quantum correlation .",
    "since analytical expressions of qd are achievable only for certain special classes of states @xcite , daki _ et al . _",
    "@xcite proposed the gmqd .",
    "they use the square of the hilbert - schmidt norm as the distance between two quantum states , and the nearest distance between @xmath8 and all of the zero - discord states @xmath34 is interpreted as a measure of quantum correlation , which is defined as    @xmath35    where the geometric quantity @xmath36 .    by noting that any two - quit state @xmath8 can be represented as @xmath37 , daki _ et al .",
    "_ derived an explicit formula of gmqd , which is given by @xcite @xmath38 where the scalar product @xmath39 with @xmath40 .",
    "moreover , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 is the largest eigenvalue of the matrix @xmath44 , where the superscript @xmath45 denotes transpose of vectors or matrices .",
    "since this measure gives analytic results without restriction on the form of @xmath8 , it turns out to be a convenient tool for analyzing quantum correlation dynamics from a geometric perspective .",
    "correlation measures ( i.e.,eof , mid and qd ) listed above assume equal values for bipartite pure states , but this is not the case for mixed states .",
    "particularly , the qd and gmqd are not symmetric quantities with respect to the measurements performed on subsystem @xmath10 or @xmath11 , and the state is said to be completely classically correlated only when both of them reach zero . in the subsequent discussions ,",
    "however , we will restrict ourselves to the situation that the states are symmetric under exchange of subsystems .",
    "we are interested in revealing difference between various correlation measures under the action of noisy environments . for this purpose",
    ", we consider a system consists of two identical atoms with spontaneous emission , and having lower and upper levels @xmath46 and @xmath47 ( @xmath48 ) separated by the energy gap @xmath49 , with @xmath50 being the transition frequency .",
    "also , we assume this system is coupled to a multimode vacuum electromagnetic field , under the influence of which its time evolution is governed by the following master equation @xcite @xmath51-\\text{i}\\sum_{i\\neq j}^2\\omega_{ij}[s_i^+s_j^-,\\rho]\\nonumber\\\\ & &   + \\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{i , j=1}^2\\gamma_{ij}\\left(2s_j^{-}\\rho s_i^{+ }   -\\{s_i^{+}s_j^{-},\\rho\\}\\right),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath52 are the raising and lowering operators while @xmath53 is the energy operator .",
    "@xmath54 ( @xmath55 ) are the spontaneous emission rates of the atoms caused by their direct interaction with the vacuum field .",
    "moreover , @xmath56 and @xmath57 ( @xmath58 ) describe the collective damping and the dipole - dipole interaction potential , respectively .",
    "they both depend on the interatomic distance @xmath59 and take the form @xmath60 , \\nonumber\\\\   \\omega_{ij}&=&\\frac{3}{4}\\gamma\\left[\\frac{\\sin(kr_{ij})}{(kr_{ij})^2}+\\frac{\\cos(kr_{ij})}{(kr_{ij})^3 }   -\\frac{\\cos(kr_{ij})}{kr_{ij}}\\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have assumed that the atomic dipole moments for the two atoms take the same value ( i.e. , @xmath61 ) and are polarized in the direction perpendicular to the interatomic axis . and",
    ", @xmath62 is the wave vector with @xmath63 being the atomic resonant wavelength .",
    "we first consider the bell - like initial state as follows @xmath64 for which the nonzero elements of @xmath65 in the standard basis @xmath66 are of the form @xmath67                     + a_2[e^{-\\gamma_{12}^{-}t}-e^{-2\\gamma t}],\\nonumber\\\\   \\rho_{23,32}(t)&=&a_1[e^{-\\gamma_{12}^{+}t}-e^{-2\\gamma t } ]                     -a_2[e^{-\\gamma_{12}^{-}t}-e^{-2\\gamma t}],\\nonumber\\\\   \\rho_{44}(t)&=&1-\\rho_{11}(t)-\\rho_{22}(t)-\\rho_{33}(t),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath68 , @xmath69 .",
    "as one can see , the x structure of @xmath65 is maintained during the evolution , which greatly facilitates the following analysis .",
    "1 shows the contour plots of the quantum correlations versus @xmath70 and @xmath71 in the short time region with the interatomic distance @xmath72 , at which @xmath73 reaches its minimal value . clearly , while the esd happens after a finite time ,",
    "the mid , qd and gmqd maintain during the whole time region .",
    "this points to a fact that the nonclassical correlations may be more resistant to external perturbations than that of entanglement .",
    "moreover , the gmqd shows a revival for large values of @xmath71 , but during the same time region the other correlation measures are always decreased . thus similar to the relativity of different entanglement measures ( see @xcite and references therein ) , the nonclassical correlation measures may also impose different orderings of quantum states .    for quantum states of eq .",
    "( 9 ) , the concurrence can be obtained analytically as @xmath74 , where @xmath75 and @xmath76 . in the short time region , @xmath77 ,",
    "thus the concurrence as well as eof are continuous functions of @xmath70 . in the long time region , @xmath78 , and",
    "the entanglement may experiences a very weak revival after a finite time interval of its complete disappearance .",
    "similarly , for @xmath65 of eq .",
    "( 9 ) we have @xmath79 , with @xmath80 , thus it is understandable that the mid also behaves as continuous functions of @xmath70 and @xmath71 . for the qd and gmqd , as denoted by the blue and green curves in fig .",
    "2 , they present sudden changes at discrete instants of time or @xmath71 which are evidenced by the presence of kinks . in general , these sudden change behaviors are caused by the optimal procedure for choosing the measurement operators , and we will discuss this issue in detail in the following .    from fig . 2 one can also observe that the mid , qd and gmqd behave as non - monotonic decreasing functions of @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "their values may be increased or decreased during certain parameter regions .",
    "particularly , it is worthwhile to note that there are states having different orderings induced by different correlation measures .",
    "for example , for the parameters chosen in fig .",
    "2 there exists states @xmath81 and @xmath82 such that @xmath83 , @xmath84 , while @xmath85 when @xmath86 $ ] , i.e. , the decrease of mid and qd are accompanied by the increase of gmqd .",
    "moreover , from the insets of fig .",
    "2 , other states differently ordered by the nonclassical correlation measures are readily distinguished , including those during the scaled time regions @xmath87 $ ] and @xmath88 $ ] , for which we have @xmath83 and @xmath89 , while @xmath90 .",
    "thus we see that there are no simple dominance relations between mid , qd and gmqd for general cases .",
    "they are different not only quantitatively but also qualitatively .",
    "now we evaluate analytically the sudden change behaviors of the qd . for @xmath65 in eq .",
    "( 9 ) , the infimum of the conditional entropy can be determined as @xmath91 where the optimal angle @xmath92 related to the projective measurement is @xmath93 with @xmath94 , and @xmath95 is the shannon entropy functional , with @xmath96 ^ 2 + 4(|\\rho_{14}|^2+|\\rho_{23}|^2+\\delta)}}{2},\\ ] ] with @xmath97 .",
    "clearly , the infimum of @xmath98 is obtained whenever @xmath99 if @xmath100 , and @xmath101 ( @xmath102 ) if @xmath103 .",
    "thus we see that the sudden change behaviors of qd here is caused by the optimization procedure for choosing the optimal measurement angle @xmath104 or equivalently , the optimal projective measurement operators @xmath24 because for the two - qubit case @xmath105 can be expressed as @xmath106 and @xmath107 , with @xmath108 being a unit vector in @xmath109 . here",
    "it should be emphasized that the angle @xmath104 that minimizes the qd is time dependent , which is different from the previous results with real elements of the density matrix @xcite . as is shown evidently in the top panel of fig .",
    "3 with fixed @xmath110 and @xmath71 , the optimal measurement angle @xmath104 assumes the value @xmath101 in the short time region , while in the long time region it is @xmath99 . for fixed @xmath70 and @xmath71 , as exposed in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "3 , the two different choices of @xmath104 yields the qd alternatively .    when considering the gmqd , from eq .",
    "( 5 ) it is readily to see that it can also be expressed as @xmath111 , where @xmath112 and @xmath113 . for quantum states with the x structure ( of course , including those of the form of eq .",
    "( 9 ) ) one can obtain the eigenvalues of @xmath114 analytically as @xmath115    the @xmath116 are in arbitrary order and can not be ordered by magnitude unless the parameter values are known , thus @xmath43 may be changed with the variation of the parameters involved , which causes the discontinuities of the gmqd .",
    "two exemplified plots for certain specified system parameters are presented in fig .",
    "4 , from which one can see that for fixed @xmath117 , the gmqd is obtained when @xmath118 in the short and long time regions , while in the middle time region , it is obtained when @xmath119 . for fixed @xmath120",
    ", we have @xmath118 for small or large values of @xmath71 , and @xmath119 for middle values of @xmath71 .    in ref .",
    "@xcite daki _",
    "_ showed that @xmath43 can be written as @xmath121 , and the sudden change in decay rates of gmqd corresponds to the sudden change of the optimized @xmath122 in @xmath109 .",
    "for the two - qubit case , the closest zero - discord state @xmath123 is obtained when @xmath124 and @xmath107 , with @xmath125 being the eigenvector of @xmath114 with the largest eigenvalue .",
    "the eigenvectors correspond to the three eigenvalues of eq .",
    "( 12 ) are @xmath126 where @xmath127 are normalization constants .",
    "@xmath125 assumes @xmath128 or @xmath129 with the variation of the involved system parameters . if @xmath130 then we have @xmath131 or equivalently , @xmath132 with @xmath133 . if @xmath134 , however , we have @xmath135 or @xmath136 with @xmath133 .",
    "the optimal @xmath104 can also be derived exactly , and here we do not care about it for the sudden change behaviors of gmqd have already been reflected by the discontinuity of the optimal @xmath92 .",
    "notice that although both the optimal unit vectors @xmath137 for the qd and @xmath125 for the gmqd are related to the projective operators , they are not the same for general case , which is reflected in the disagreement of their individual sudden changes in the decay rates .    in fig .",
    "5 we show the influence of @xmath138 on correlation dynamics for the initial state @xmath139 with @xmath140 and @xmath120 .",
    "it is seen that all the correlation measures behave as damped oscillations with increasing @xmath138 , and the dependence of qd and gmqd on @xmath138 are more sensitive than those of eof and mid .",
    "also one can note that there exists states @xmath81 and @xmath82 such that @xmath84 , @xmath89 and @xmath141 .",
    "thus we see again that the states have different orderings induced by different measures of nonclassical correlations .",
    "finally , we show that the robustness of quantum correlations may be enhanced by performing local unitary operations to the initial state @xmath142 . as we know , the correlation measures ( eof , mid , qd and gmqd ) are locally unitary invariant ; that is , @xmath142 and @xmath143 have completely the same values of correlations for any unitary operators @xmath144 and @xmath145 acting on parties @xmath10 and @xmath11 . but this does not mean that their robustness against decoherence are the same .",
    "in fact , for any initial state @xmath142 , there exist an optimal local unitary transformation @xmath146 which can enhance the robustness of the correlations to a certain greatest extent .",
    "however , in general , the optimal @xmath146 is determined by the decoherence mechanism as well as the explicit form of @xmath142 , and it is difficult to obtain an analytical expression of it .    for simplicity ,",
    "we consider the initial state as a werner - like state @xmath147 . and",
    "we restrict ourselves to the complete set of locally unitary transformations @xmath148 ( a subset of @xmath149 ) .",
    "density matrix @xmath150 for @xmath151 can be obtained analytically @xcite , and the dependence of eof , mid , qd as well as gmqd on the elements of @xmath150 are the same as those for the initial state @xmath139 . but the parameter appeared in eq .",
    "( 11 ) changes to @xmath152 , where @xmath153 and @xmath154 . for general @xmath155 ,",
    "however , the density matrix @xmath65 as well as the correlation measures can only be obtained numerically since the x structure of it may be destroyed under the transformation @xmath148 . by expressing @xmath145 in terms of the pauli operators as @xmath156 with @xmath157 $ ] and @xmath158 $ ] , we perform numerical calculations with @xmath159 , @xmath160 , @xmath72 and show the results in fig .",
    "it is shown that the extent of different correlation measures at finite time @xmath161 can be adjusted among values bounded by the cyan regions by performing operations @xmath148 to the initial state .",
    "particularly , the sudden death phenomenon of entanglement may be avoided .",
    "thus we see that different locally unitary equivalent states show different robustness against decoherence induced by the spontaneous emission , and this provides a way for long - time preservation of quantum correlations in this system .",
    "in conclusion , we evaluated systematically the quantum correlations quantified by the eof , mid , qd and gmqd by exactly solving a model with the two qubits interacting with a multimode radiation field .",
    "we showed that the dynamics for these quantities may be rather different .",
    "particularly , while entanglement experiences sudden death , mid , qd and gmqd persist for an infinite time , i.e. , they are more robust than that of entanglement against decoherence , which is important for qip tasks which deos not based on entanglement . moreover",
    ", the dissipative process of spontaneous emission may lead to a generation of states manifesting the relativity of different correlation measures .",
    "in general , different measures of nonclassical correlations are incomparable since their behaviors may be qualitatively different .",
    "we also demonstrated the disagreement between qd and gmqd on reflecting the sudden change behaviors of nonclassical correlations of a given quantum state .",
    "the origin of this phenomenon is the different definitions of discord based on different measures of distance between two states .",
    "while the qd is based on the von neumann entropy , the gmqd is based on the hilbert - schmidt norm , and it is this difference that yields different optimal measurement operators .    since it is generally accepted that quantum correlations is crucial for qip , it is important to maintain them as long as possible .",
    "here we showed that although local unitary operations can not change extents of quantum correlations of a state , it can greatly enhance the robustness of a system against decoherence .",
    "this provides a possible way for long - time preservation of the quantum correlations by local unitary operations .",
