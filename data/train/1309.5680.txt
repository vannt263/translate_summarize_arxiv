    "as a treasure trove of quantitative information , the citation dynamics has been studied for a long time @xcite .",
    "a particularly noteworthy contribution was a study in @xmath0 by de solla price @xcite , who proposed the so - called ` cumulative advantage ' mechanism , that is , a paper which has been cited many times is more likely to be cited again than others which have been little cited .",
    "the cumulative advantage is based on the idea of ` the rich get richer ' suggested by yule @xcite and simon @xcite , and the criterion now is widely known as the ` preferential attachment ' in the framework of currently fashionable evolving network models , proposed by barabsi and albert in @xmath1 @xcite . with concepts and methodologies of complex networks ,",
    "the study of citation patterns has been modeled by networks with nodes representing papers published in scientific journals and edges mimicking citations from papers to others published previously  @xcite .    in citation networks",
    ", the probability distribution function appears to involve dual mechanisms with a tipping point between them , that is , a distribution @xmath2 may decay exponentially for small @xmath3 and has a power - law tail for large @xmath3  @xcite . here",
    ", the degree @xmath3 represents the number of citations a paper receives and @xmath2 is the distribution of the relative numbers of such citations . to explain this feature , several mechanisms have been proposed based on the cumulative advantage in different contexts  @xcite .",
    "for instance , peterson et al  @xcite developed a direct - indirect citing mechanism to fit the citation distribution and analyzed the tipping - point transition .",
    "eom and fortunato  @xcite employed the linear preferential attachment with initial attractiveness to reproduce empirical distributions and account for the presence of citation bursts . the cumulative advantage of the node s degree , however , usually weakens and even ignores the hierarchical qualities of papers published in different journals .",
    "it is quite possible that a new paper published in a prestigious journal with relatively few current citations will show a potential outbreak on citing , rather than a previously published paper in a common journal with more citations .    on the other hand ,",
    "the role of time is also important in citation dynamics : old papers are rarely cited while recent papers are usually cited with high frequency .",
    "that is , the popularity of papers peaks and then fades .",
    "the question of time dependence in the attachment probability of the incoming nodes in a growing network has been addressed in several theoretical models  @xcite .",
    "for instance , dorogovtsev and mendes studied the case when the connection probability of the new node with an old one is not only proportional to the degree @xmath3 but also to a power of its present age @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "they found that the network shows scale - free ( sf ) behaviour only in the region @xmath5 .",
    "for @xmath6 , the distribution @xmath7 is exponential . on the contrary , klemm and eguluz considered evolving networks based on collective memory of nodes and proposed a degree - dependent deactivation network model @xcite which transformed the cumulative advantage into the ageing mechanism .",
    "most previous studies in citation dynamics either focused on a small number of researchers ( e.g. , high @xmath8-index scientists ) or exploited a database based on one publication society ( e.g. , papers published in journals of the american physical society ) .",
    "this means that they worked on part of the citation network which is not enough to reflect an universal statistical feature on the whole .",
    "of course it is very complicated to analyze citing behaviour of giant papers of the whole citation network or the network of a discipline , such as physics .",
    "it is therefore of great importance to model realistic citation networks with a global view . in this paper",
    "we consider the influence of journals on citation dynamics and propose an intuitive mechanism to build the citation network of physics .",
    "we endow each node with a weight for its quality based on the impact factor ( if ) of the journal in which it was published and propose a prestige function transformed from the article influence score ( ais ) to guide citing .",
    "the if of a journal is the average number of citations received per paper published in that journal during the two preceding years . while the ais measures the average influence of articles in the journal .",
    "based on these we can represent paper activity not only by the degree of citations but also by the intrinsic weight , which drives the evolution of citation network .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] we describe the indicators from the journal of citation reports , based on which we construct and analyze the model in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] . in sec .",
    "[ sec4 ] we imitate the short - term evolution of the citation network in @xmath9 based on the indicators in @xmath10 .",
    "conclusions are drawn in final section .",
    "a complete profile of journals and papers in the journal of citation reports ( jcr )  @xcite includes many indicators for the evaluation of the journals and corresponding papers .",
    "we shall use the @xmath11-year impact factor ( if@xmath11 ) instead of the if as a reasonable weight of a paper published in a journal .",
    "the if@xmath11 can avoid the influence from outbreak and decline periods of journal citing behaviour .",
    "moreover , its rationality has been validated from different disciplines  @xcite .",
    "based on the if@xmath11 , the eigenfactor score takes the heterogeneous importance of other distinct journals which have cited the given journal into consideration .",
    "standardized by the normalized publication volume in the @xmath11 proceeding years , the eigenfactor score can be transformed into the article influence score ( ais ) to intuitively depict the average impact of each paper in a journal .",
    "we therefore adopt the ais as the criterion of paper citing .",
    "we have analyzed almost all the papers in physics and astronomy published from @xmath12 to @xmath9 categorized by the jcr  @xcite which spread over all the @xmath13 branches in physics and @xmath14 extra branch called astronomy and astrophysics .",
    "taking statistics in @xmath10 for a sample , there were @xmath15 papers published in @xmath16 journals .",
    "the indicators of some journals were not publicated generally for a short founding time or a highly self - cited rate which are unfair to others . after eliminating these defective samples , @xmath17 papers in @xmath18 journals remained , which were assigned with distinct if@xmath11s ranged from @xmath19 to @xmath20 and different number of papers published successively .",
    "statistics in the other two years is similar .",
    "it should be noticed that the numbers of journals and annual output in physics are steady increasing .     from @xmath12 to @xmath9 .",
    "the solid line is the fit in the form of eq .",
    "( [ disp ] ) .",
    "the closeness of the @xmath21-year results implies a stable growth in physics and astronomy . ]",
    "since the if@xmath11 of each journal is almost always different , it is rational for one to accomplish the normalized publication volume based on the if@xmath11 .",
    "it should be noticed that some journals with close if@xmath11 differ in prestige or academic status in corresponding branch . also",
    ", papers published in the same journal exhibit heterogeneity in citation . as a first step towards modeling paper s heterogeneity , we consider papers published in the same journal having the same intrinsic weight .",
    "although it does not capture accurately and fully the heterogeneity in real data , it will not lead to large influence on the tendency of publication with similar likelihood among them .",
    "thus , we make a reasonable classification for all the journals by distinct intervals of if@xmath11s which embodies the specific impact of papers with a certain rank . for simplicity",
    ", the journals with if@xmath11s between two adjacent integers are aggregated in the same rank .",
    "moreover , the average impact of journals with the same rank , denoted with @xmath22 , can be approximated by the average value of corresponding if@xmath11s .",
    "thus , the normalized publication volume of a given rank @xmath23 is accumulated by the number of related articles .",
    "the best fit shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] implies a log - normal distribution , @xmath24 \\label{disp}\\ ] ] with @xmath25 and @xmath26 , respectively .",
    "based on the if@xmath11 .",
    "the original statistics of the ais is fitted by the solid line , while the dashed line denotes the modulatory function defined by eq .",
    "( [ fh ] ) . ]     from @xmath12 to @xmath9 .",
    "the linear behaviour of the fit implies the power - law scaling . ]",
    "we further investigate the impact of the prestige of journals on citing behavior .",
    "as aforesaid , the ais of a journal weights the impact of each citation of citing journals , and therefore is reasonable for explaining the difference in two journals with close if .",
    "it was found in  @xcite that the ais and the if@xmath11 are positively correlated for most journals .",
    "figure  [ fig2 ] shows the statistics of the ais for physics journals with different if@xmath11s from the jcr .",
    "as one can see , the ais increases with the if@xmath11 .",
    "the best fit predicts a superlinear growth function . in reality , however , scientists always have a subjective judgment of journals which results in a modulatory effect : for low - ais papers , the citation increase quickly than the ais , in other words , scientists are cautious to cite papers published in low - if journals and a little increase in the if@xmath11 will lead to big difference ; whereas for high - if papers , this difference is weak and the speed of the citing increase is lower than that of the ais .",
    "motivated by this , we propose a new prestige function : @xmath27    to an extent , the evaluation of papers ( @xmath28 ) stems from scientist s impression on them in recent years .",
    "this impression will affect future attention , which can also be reflected by another indicator in the jcr  immediacy index ( ix ) .",
    "the ix is defined as the average number of times that a paper , published in a specific year within a specific journal , is cited over the course of the same year , which is a measure of importance and authority of a scientific journal .",
    "figure  [ fig3 ] shows the dependence of the ix on the if@xmath11 from @xmath12 to @xmath9 .",
    "the best fit suggests a power - law relationship between them .",
    "moreover , the consistency of the @xmath21-year data informs us that journals with different academic levels steadily maintain its status in physics research .",
    "in this section we shall use statistical results from the jcr to build the citation network of physics .",
    "following the idea of bianconi and barabsi  @xcite , we argue that the evolution of a paper in citation networks depends not only on its topological degree but also on its quality . the topological information , denoted by the indegree @xmath3 , measures citations .",
    "while the quality can be characterized by @xmath23 . to do that , for each node @xmath29 a weight @xmath30 is assigned , which is the random number drawn from a given probability distribution function @xmath23 .",
    "correspondingly , @xmath28 reflects the node s ability to compete for links . with the normalized publication volume @xmath23 and @xmath28 in @xmath10",
    ", we try to imitate the evolution of the citation network of physics in @xmath9 .",
    "the network is initialized with a seed of @xmath31 isolated nodes which are all active . then at each time",
    "step the dynamics runs as follows .",
    "\\(i ) add an active node @xmath29 , which connects to @xmath32 ( @xmath33 ) nodes randomly chosen from the @xmath31 active ones .",
    "\\(ii ) deactivate one ( denoted by @xmath34 ) of the @xmath35 active nodes with probability @xmath36^{-1 } , \\label{deactprob}\\ ] ] where @xmath37^{-1}\\}^{-1}$ ] is the normalization factor and @xmath38 is a constant bias .",
    "the summation runs over the set @xmath39 of the @xmath35 active nodes .",
    "( [ deactprob ] ) implies that a paper with high citations or prestige has a small possibility to be forgotten . during evolution ,",
    "a node might receive edges while it is active , and once inactive it will not receive edges any more",
    ". moreover , the self - cited phenomenon hardly happens due to the uncorrelated attachment mechanism .    denoting with @xmath40 the number of active nodes with indegree @xmath3 and weight @xmath22 at time @xmath41 , one can write out the rate equation for network evolution : @xmath42a(k-1,w , t)-\\frac{m}{n}a(k , w , t ) \\nonumber \\\\ & - \\left(1-\\frac{m}{n}\\right)\\pi(k , w)a(k , w , t)+\\left[1-\\pi(0,w)\\right]\\rho(w)\\delta_{k,0}. \\label{mdiff}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ mdiff ] ) , the first term represents an active node with indegree @xmath43 and weight @xmath22 at time @xmath41 is connected by the newcomer and not deactivated at current time , the second and third terms account for the reduction of @xmath40 , and the last term is a complement for the boundary condition that the newcomer with weight @xmath22 is not deactivated at current time . imposing the stationarity condition @xmath44 yields @xmath45}{[m(i+c)f(w)+\\sigma(n - m ) ] } \\ } , \\label{diffeq1}\\\\ a(0,w ) & = \\frac{n\\rho(w)[c\\phi(w)-\\sigma]}{\\sigma n+m[c\\phi(w)-\\sigma]}. \\label{diffeq2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] employing stirling approximation , the solution can be simplified to @xmath46^{-[c-\\frac{\\sigma}{\\phi(w)}]}\\left[1+c+\\frac{\\sigma(n - m)}{m\\phi(w)}\\right]^{1+c+\\frac{\\sigma(n - m)}{m\\phi(w ) } } \\nonumber \\\\ & \\times \\frac{k+c}{c}\\frac{\\left[k+c-1-\\frac{\\sigma}{\\phi(w)}\\right]^{k+c-1-\\frac{\\sigma}{\\phi(w)}}}{\\left[k+c+\\frac{\\sigma(n - m)}{m\\phi(w)}\\right]^{-[k+c+\\frac{\\sigma(n - m)}{m\\phi(w)}]}}. \\label{diffeq3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] denoting with @xmath47 the number of inactive nodes with indegree @xmath3 and weight @xmath22 at time @xmath41 , it obviously satisfies @xmath48=1,\\ ] ] which means only one inactive node is generated at each time step so that @xmath47 is increased by one at next time .",
    "thus , we obtain the master equation for @xmath47 : @xmath49 since @xmath47 grows linearly with @xmath41 , we introduce the function @xmath50 such that @xmath51 where @xmath50 is the stationary probability of inactive nodes with indegree @xmath3 and weight @xmath22 . in case",
