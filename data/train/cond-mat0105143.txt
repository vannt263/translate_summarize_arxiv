    "in this paper we present a monte carlo study of the model using the invaded cluster ( ic ) algorithm . the purpose of this study is both to obtain high precision results for the model and to test the efficacy of the invaded cluster method for phase transitions with continuous symmetry breaking .",
    "the model is in the @xmath2 universality class and in two dimensions the transition is of the type  @xcite .",
    "theoretical and computational studies of the @xmath2 critical point include high temperature series expansions  @xcite , renormalization - group calculations  @xcite and monte carlo ( mc ) simulations  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath7 transition in @xmath8he is also in the @xmath2 universality class and the specific heat exponent @xmath9 for this system has been measured to very high precision  @xcite .",
    "recent monte carlo studies of the transition use versions of the wolff algorithm  @xcite because near the critical point they are much more efficient than local algorithms .",
    "the wolff algorithm is an example of a cluster algorithm of the kind first introduced by swendsen and wang  @xcite for ising - potts models .",
    "the central idea of cluster algorithms is to identify clusters of sites by a bond percolation process correlated to the spin configuration .",
    "the spins of each cluster are then independently flipped .",
    "cluster algorithms can be extremely efficient when the percolation process that defines the clusters has a percolation threshold that coincides with the phase transition of the spins .",
    "this situation holds for the original swendsen - wang algorithm applied to ising - potts models and was later shown to hold for a variety of other spin systems with discrete symmetries  @xcite .",
    "wolff  @xcite showed how to extend cluster algorithms to spin models with @xmath10-symmetry by an ising embedding method .    invaded cluster ( ic ) algorithms  @xcite are cluster algorithms with the property that they find and simulate the critical point automatically without _ a priori _ knowledge of the critical temperature .",
    "the critical temperature is a direct output of the algorithm and the magnetic exponents can be obtained from finite - size scaling of the cluster size distribution .",
    "in addition to providing the critical temperature and magnetic exponent without having to invoke methods such as histogram re - weighting , ic algorithms appear to have less critical slowing than corresponding swendsen - wang or wolff algorithms  @xcite .",
    "ic algorithms can , in principle , be constructed whenever a conventional cluster algorithm is available with the property that the bond percolation process has a percolation threshold that coincides with the phase transition .",
    "ic algorithms have thus far been applied to systems with discrete symmetry breaking including ising - potts  @xcite models , widom - rowlinson models  @xcite and the fully frustrated ising model  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we show how wolff s embedding scheme can be used to construct an efficient ic algorithm for simulating the @xmath2 critical point in three dimensions and the point in two dimensions .",
    "one of our objectives is to obtain a high precision value of the @xmath11 exponent for the @xmath2 universality class . because @xmath11 is itself very small ,",
    "it has proved difficult to measure it with much precision .",
    "one of the difficulties is the presence of corrections to scaling .",
    "recently , hasenbusch and trk @xcite proposed a method to minimize this difficulty by considering a soft spin @xmath2 model with a parameter controlling the variance in the length of the spin vectors . by adjusting this parameter",
    "they minimize corrections to scaling and improve their estimate of @xmath11 .",
    "below we apply a modified version of the ic algorithm to the soft spin model .    in the next section",
    "we describe the ic algorithm for the model . in sec.[sec : results ] we give results for the critical temperature , magnetic exponents and dynamic properties of the model in two and three dimensions . in sec.[sec",
    ": soft ] we describe the algorithm and present results for the soft spin model .",
    "conclusions are presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "the algorithms for the _ xy _ model used in this paper are obtained by combining the invaded cluster method and wolff s embedding scheme for continuous spin models .",
    "the model is defined by the hamiltonian : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is a two dimensional unit vector and the summation is over all nearest neighbor bonds on the lattice , here either the square or cubic lattice with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "we begin by describing a version of wolff s algorithm for the _ xy _ model . on each monte carlo step",
    "we choose a two - dimensional unit vector @xmath14 . for each bond @xmath15 of the lattice",
    ", the bond is called _ satisfied _ if both spins lie on the same side of the line perpendicular to the unit vector , that is , @xmath16 satisfied bonds are then _ occupied _ with probability @xmath17.\\ ] ] one way to implement the occupation of bonds with this probability is to independently assign random numbers @xmath18 , uniformly chosen from the interval @xmath19 to every bond of the lattice and then to occupy the satisfied bonds if @xmath20 . an equivalent approach , which provides a useful link to the ic methodology , is to define @xmath21 from @xmath18 by substituting @xmath18 for @xmath22 and @xmath21 for @xmath23 in eq.([eqn : wprob ] ) and then solving for @xmath21 , @xmath24 satisfied bonds with @xmath25 are occupied .",
    "the occupied bonds define a set of connected clusters .",
    "single sites with no occupied bonds are considered clusters so that every lattice site is uniquely a member of some cluster .",
    "once the clusters are identified each cluster is _ flipped _ with probability @xmath26 .",
    "a cluster is flipped by reflecting every spin in the cluster through the line perpendicular to @xmath27 , @xmath28 where @xmath29 flipping clusters with probability one half yields a new spin configurations and completes one mc step .",
    "it is straightforward to show that the algorithm is ergodic and satisfies detailed balance .",
    "wolff s original paper  @xcite introduces two innovations .",
    "the first is to grow and flip only a single cluster in each monte carlo step .",
    "the second is the generalization of cluster methods to spin models with continuous symmetries .",
    "only the generalization to continuous symmetries is used here and combined with the invaded cluster methodology .",
    "in fact , wolff s single cluster method is not compatible with the invaded cluster methodology .",
    "when we speak of the wolff algorithm in the following we mean the algorithm described above for which all clusters are defined and flipped in a single mc step .",
    "cluster algorithms can generally be viewed as a sequence of bond moves and spin moves . during the bond move a configuration of occupied bonds and the associated set of clusters",
    "are generated from the spin configuration .",
    "this is done by occupying satisfied bonds with a probability that depends on the simulation temperature . during the spin",
    "move a new spin configuration is obtained by randomly flipping clusters .",
    "the bond configurations can be viewed as a correlated percolation model . for a cluster algorithm to be efficient",
    ", the correlated percolation model should have a percolation transition that coincides with the critical point of the spin model .",
    "if this holds then clusters of all sizes are flipped during a single mc step and changes to the spin configuration occur on all length scales . for ising - potts models the correlated percolation model associated with the swendsen - wang algorithm is the fortuin - kastelyn random cluster model and the equivalence of the percolation threshold and the critical point is well - understood @xcite .",
    "the percolation properties of the bonds defined by the wolff algorithm for the model have recently been investigated  @xcite .",
    "the conclusion is the same as for the ising - potts models : the critical point for the d _ xy _ model and kosterlitz - thouless point for the d _ xy _ model coincide with the percolation threshold for the bonds defined by the wolff algorithm .",
    "the invaded cluster methodology relies on the equivalence of the phase transition in the spin model and the percolation transition of the occupied bonds to find and simulate the phase transition without prior knowledge of the critical coupling . like other cluster algorithms ,",
    "a full mc step consists of a bond move followed by a spin move .",
    "the spin move is the same as for standard cluster algorithms but the bond moves differs . in the ic bond move ,",
    "satisfied bonds are occupied one at a time in random order until a signature of percolation is first observed .",
    "the set of occupied bonds obtained in this way defines bond clusters and these are flipped in the usual way .",
    "the signature of percolation is incorporated in a stopping condition that is tested after each new bond is occupied . in this paper",
    "we use a topological stopping condition , which requires that at least one cluster wraps around the lattice in at least one direction .    for the most part",
    ", the ic algorithm closely parallels the wolff algorithm .",
    "first a unit vector is randomly chosen and satisfied bonds are determined with respect to this unit vector as described in the paragraph including eq .",
    "( [ eq : sat ] ) . then uniform random numbers , @xmath18 are assigned to each bond and non - uniform random numbers",
    ", @xmath21 are obtained from them according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : k ] ) .",
    "the next step of the ic algorithm differs from the wolff algorithm .",
    "satisfied bonds are occupied _ one at a time _",
    "according to the ordering defined by @xmath21 with the satisfied bond having the smallest value of @xmath30 occupied first . after each bond",
    "is occupied , the set of clusters is updated and the stopping condition is checked .",
    "if no cluster wraps around the lattice the satisfied bond with the next largest @xmath30 is occupied but if some cluster wraps around the lattice in some direction the bond move is completed and no further bonds are occupied .",
    "the largest value of @xmath30 chosen during the bond move is called @xmath31 .",
    "the spin move is identical to the wolff algorithm : with probability @xmath26 , each cluster is reflected through the line perpendicular to @xmath27 according to eqs .",
    "( [ eq : flip ] ) and ( [ eq : reflect ] ) .",
    "the ic algorithm simulates the critical point and @xmath31 is an estimator of the critical coupling . to see why this is the case , consider a large system with a spin configuration that is typical of the critical point .",
    "the correlated percolation threshold for the occupied bonds is related to critical coupling according to eq .",
    "( [ eqn : wprob ] ) .",
    "that is , if satisfied bonds are occupied with probability @xmath32 $ ] , the occupied bonds will just percolate  @xcite . occupying bonds with probability @xmath33",
    "is the same as occupying all satisfied bonds one at a time in ascending order of @xmath30 and stopping at the largest @xmath30 such that @xmath34 .",
    "the ic algorithm works in the same way except that satisfied bonds are added until a cluster wraps around the system . for a large system ,",
    "this event will occur with @xmath31 nearly equal to @xmath35 .",
    "thus , if the system is at criticality , a single step of the ic algorithm is almost identical to a single step of the wolff algorithm at @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "so long as the fluctuations in @xmath31 become small as the system size increase , the ic algorithm and the wolff algorithm at @xmath35 will sample the same state in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "however , in finite volume , the invaded cluster algorithm defines an ensemble that is different than the canonical ensemble and has different finite - size scaling properties .",
    "so far we have assumed the spin system is already at the critical point .",
    "suppose that the spin configuration is typical of the low temperature phase , then there will be more satisfied bonds than at criticality and a smaller fraction will be needed to form a spanning cluster so that @xmath37 .",
    "the invaded cluster mc step thus corresponds to a wolff mc step at temperature @xmath38 so that the system is warmed .",
    "a similar argument shows that if the system starts in the high temperature phase , it is cooled by the ic algorithm so that there is negative feedback mechanism that forces the system to the critical point independent of the starting configuration . a detailed discussion of these arguments in the context of ising - potts models is given in ref .",
    "@xcite .    for the 2d model",
    ", the ic algorithm described above does not perform well .",
    "the problem is similar to a problem that occurs in the 2d ising model .",
    "specifically , at criticality , the satisfied bonds themselves just percolate .",
    "this means that in a significant fraction of spin configurations , spanning is not possible .",
    "it also means that the distribution of the temperature estimator is broad because of spin configurations for which spanning is just barely possible .",
    "the problem is even worse for the the model .",
    "since the unit vector @xmath27 is randomized from one step to the next , spanning on one monte carlo step does not guarantee spanning on the next monte carlo step as it does in the ising case . as a result",
    ", a small fraction of the time , no spanning cluster can be found for the chosen unit vector @xmath27 .",
    "furthermore , the distribution of the temperature estimator is very broad because some spin configurations and unit vectors just barely allow spanning yielding a very small value of the temperature estimator .",
    "these problems can be alleviated by taking advantage of a second independent set of satisfied bonds .",
    "let s refer to the bonds that are satisfied with respect to the definition of eq .",
    "( [ eq : sat ] ) as _ red _ satisfied bonds .",
    "let @xmath39 be a unit vector perpendicular to @xmath27 and define bond @xmath15 as _ blue _ satisfied if @xmath40 to increase the probability that we obtain a spanning cluster , we can occupy both red and blue satisfied bonds .",
    "two values of @xmath30 , one with respect to @xmath27 and the other with respect to @xmath39 , are assigned to each bond using eq.([eq : k ] ) and a single value of @xmath41 .",
    "the entire set of @xmath30 s , for both red and blue satisfied bonds , is ordered .",
    "bond are either red or blue occupied in the order prescribed by the @xmath30 s and sets of red and blue clusters are identified and updated after each new bond is occupied .",
    "the first cluster to span , either red or blue , stops the process of occupying bonds . during the spin move ,",
    "both sets of clusters are flipped with probability @xmath26 according to eqs .",
    "( [ eq : flip ] ) and ( [ eq : reflect ] ) with @xmath27 replaced by @xmath39 for the blue clusters .",
    "one way of looking at this algorithm is that it utilizes two independent embeddings of the ising model in the xy model , one embedding relative to @xmath27 and the other relative to @xmath42 .",
    "the two embedding method was always able to find a spanning cluster and it produces a less broad distribution for the temperature estimator . nonetheless , the distribution of @xmath31 is still very broad and we find better statistics by averaging @xmath43 .",
    "all results reported for the two - dimensional model use the two - embedding method .",
    "the algorithm was implemented on systems with maximum linear size @xmath44 for three dimensions and @xmath45 for two dimensions .",
    "each run consisted of 160000 mc steps for three dimensions and 10000 mc steps for two dimensions .",
    "we collected statistics for the estimator of the critical coupling , @xmath31 and the size of the spanning cluster , @xmath46 . for the d model we obtained the estimator of critical coupling as inverse of the estimator of the critical temperature .",
    "the average critical coupling and its error bars were obtained using the blocking method  @xcite with 100 blocks of 100 data points each for two dimensions and 160 blocks of 1000 data points each for three dimensions .",
    "the average size of the spanning cluster and its error bars was obtained using the bootstrap method  @xcite .",
    "the reported error bars are one standard deviation .",
    "the simulation time was @xmath47 cpu seconds per spin per mc sweep on a @xmath48mhz pentium iii machine running linux .",
    "figure  [ fig : kc3d ] shows the average value of @xmath31 for the d  model versus the inverse of the linear size of the system @xmath49 .",
    "we fit the data for @xmath50 to a function of the form : @xmath51 where @xmath35 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 are parameters of the fit .",
    "the results of the fit are @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 with @xmath57 , @xmath58 and the confidence level is @xmath59 . the value for the critical coupling @xmath35 compares well with values used in the literature as shown in table  [ tab:3d ] . note that @xmath60 as would be expected from naive finite size scaling arguments . as is the case for ising - potts systems , the ic ensemble for the model does not have the same finite size scaling properties as the canonical ensemble .",
    "the validity of the ic method is justified by the fact that the width of the distribution of @xmath31 decreases as @xmath61 increases .",
    "figure  [ fig : sig3d ] shows the standard deviation @xmath62 of @xmath31 as a function of @xmath49 and suggests that @xmath63 and therefore we expect a sharp distribution of @xmath31 for @xmath64 .",

    "the choice of @xmath84 was a compromise between keeping the error in @xmath35 small and the confidence level @xmath85 large .",
    "the result for @xmath35 is in good agreement with some of the recent results from the literature as shown in table  [ tab:2d ] .",
    "although the fit is good , the result for @xmath35 should be viewed with caution because it is based on finite size scaling assumptions that do not necessarily hold for the ic ensemble .",
    "figure  [ fig : sig2d ] shows the standard deviation @xmath86 of @xmath43 as a function of @xmath87 . unlike the situation in three - dimensions , it is not clear that @xmath86 vanishes as @xmath88 .",

    "a naive extrapolation suggests @xmath86 approaches a finite value near @xmath90 but a slowly decreasing function can not be ruled out . in the previous section we discussed reasons for the broad distribution of the temperature estimator .",
