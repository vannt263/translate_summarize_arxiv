    "the first multicolour photometry of v1213 cen was collected by amateur astronomers from the american association of variable star observers ( aavso)@xcite five days after the peak .",
    "however , the data from @xmath36 day show considerable scatter between @xmath37 and @xmath38 mag , much larger than the quoted error bars ( @xmath39 one hundredth of a magnitude ) , plausibly meaning that they suffer from unknown systematic effects .",
    "aavso measurements are differential , that is , they show relative difference in magnitudes between the nova and one or more ( `` ensemble '' ) comparison stars .",
    "we consider the latter to be more reliable .",
    "the available data were acquired by two observers , l. elenin ( ele ) and n. butterworth ( biw ) , and cluster around @xmath40 or @xmath41 mag , respectively .",
    "that shows that at least one dataset is affected by some systematic error(s ) and hence the reddening @xmath42 mag .",
    "the _ swift _ x - ray spectrum of the nova can be fitted@xcite as a blackbody with temperature @xmath43 ev and an absorbing column density @xmath44 @xmath45 , which corresponds@xcite to a @xmath7-band extinction of @xmath46 mag ( or @xmath47 mag assuming the standard extinction law with @xmath48 ) .",
    "since the blackbody model is an oversimplification of the real x - ray spectrum and the measured absorbing column density may contain the internal absorption , the interstellar reddening @xmath49 mag .",
    "using the multicolour light curves of several novae , we estimated the intrinsic colour of novae two mag below the peak magnitude of @xmath50 mag ( three mag below the peak brightness of @xmath51 mag ) .",

    "if the reddening law toward the nova is standard , then @xmath56 mag and the distance modulus of the nova is @xmath57 mag ( distance @xmath58 kpc ) .",
    "this places the nova in the scutum - centaurus arm of the milky way . at present in 2016 , the observed colour of the nova is @xmath59 mag , so the estimated colour excess @xmath60 mag is consistent with intrinsic colours of post - novae .",
    "the ogle data were collected during two phases of the project : ogle - iii@xcite ( 2001 - 2009 ) and ogle - iv@xcite ( since 2010 ) .",
    "the survey uses the dedicated 1.3-m warsaw telescope located at las campanas observatory , chile , operated by the carnegie institution for science .",
    "all observations were taken in the @xmath32 and @xmath7 filters , closely resembling the standard system .",
    "data were reduced , and astrometrically and photometrically calibrated using the standard pipelines@xcite@xmath3@xcite@xmath3@xcite .",
    "thanks to the superb quality of images and application of the difference image analysis technique@xcite , the photometry is very accurate ( 3% for 18 mag , 10% for 19.5 mag ) , although the nova has close , bright neighbours ( fig .",
    "[ fchart ] ) .",
    "pre - eruption images were collected during the ogle - iii phase between march 2003 and may 2009 ( 2374 @xmath32-band images with an exposure time 180  s each ) .",
    "the photometry was improved by stacking images from each night ( from three to over thirty individual frames with seeing better than @xmath61 ) .",
    "we also attempted to assess the quiescent _ i_-band brightness of the dwarf nova by stacking 122 frames with the best seeing ( @xmath62 ) .",
    "although the depth of the resulting composite image reached @xmath63  mag in empty sky regions , we were unable to resolve the nova owing to the proximity ( @xmath64 ) of a bright star ( @xmath65  mag ) and the glow of its image wings .",
    "thus , we could only obtain an upper limit of @xmath66  mag on the nova brightness in quiescence .",
    "several images of nova cen 2009 were also collected immediately after the eruption , from 13 may to 26 may 2009 . because all these images were taken with the standard exposure time of 180  s , the nova is severely overexposed on each of them and thus its brightness could not be measured .",
    "post - eruption data were taken mainly as a part of the ogle galaxy variability survey@xcite with short exposure times from 25 to 30 s ( 123 images ) .",
    "they were supplemented with 119 deeper images ( exposure time 180  s ) obtained in 20102012 and march  may 2016 .",
    "the latter were primarily used for the period analysis .      because v1213 cen is located in the vicinity of transiting planet candidate ogle - tr-167@xcite , it was serendipitously observed with the vimos instrument at the 8.2-m very large telescope ( vlt ) on 11 april 2005 ( under the program 075.c-0427(a ) , pi : d. minniti ) .",
    "we stacked eleven images ( with exposure time 15 s each ) with the best seeing ( @xmath67 ) .",
    "the nova is clearly visible in that composite image .",
    "we used the daophot package@xcite to estimate its brightness at @xmath68 mag , which places an upper limit on the quiescent brightness of the dwarf nova ( the star was not observed at that time by ogle , thus we can not assess whether it were fully quiescent ) .",
    "we used 107 deep @xmath32-band exposures acquired between 9 march and 3 may 2016 to measure the orbital period of the post - nova .",
    "there is a strong sinusoidal variability with a period of @xmath8 h , probably an orbital hump . in principle",
    "the orbital period might be twice as long .",
    "however , the absolute quiescent brightness of the nova ( @xmath69 mag ) is inconsistent@xcite with a @xmath70-h orbital period . ( the secondary s mass would be larger than @xmath71 , which would imply @xmath72 mag ) .",
    "two additional periodicities at 4.1966 and 6.4605 h are day aliases of the orbital period . assuming that the secondary fills its roche lobe and follows the standard mass - radius relation for main - sequence stars@xcite , its mass is @xmath73 and",
    "hence the @xmath7-band absolute magnitude @xmath74 mag is in accordance with our observations .",
    "there are some correlations between photometric features of dwarf nova outbursts@xcite@xmath3@xcite .",
    "for example , the duration of outbursts is correlated with the orbital period@xcite ; the absolute magnitude during outbursts is correlated with the orbital period@xcite@xmath3@xcite ; and the absolute magnitude in quiescence is correlated with the outburst frequency and orbital period@xcite .",

    "<S> again , this is consistent with the typical luminosities of dwarf novae ( see extended data fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the nova eruption occurred within six days after the start of the last dwarf nova outburst ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ lc]d ) and so , although the light curve is incomplete , it is tempting to suppose that matter dumped onto the white dwarf during that last few days of dwarf nova outbursts triggered the thermonuclear runaway and nova explosion .    </S>",
    "<S> the quiescent absolute brightness of the dwarf nova corresponds to a mass - transfer rate of about @xmath19@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> at such a low mass - transfer rate the accretion disk is in an unstable state@xcite , which is consistent with the presence of dwarf nova outbursts before the 2009 eruption . </S>",
    "<S> the accretion disk produces most of the light in the @xmath7-band , so we can estimate how the mass - transfer rate changed by simply comparing pre- and post - eruption @xmath7-band brightness . at present in 2016 , the system has @xmath20 mag ( @xmath21 mag in 2011 ) , which means the mass - transfer rate is now @xmath22 times higher than before the nova eruption ( in 2011 it was 800 times brighter ) . </S>",
    "<S> the absolute brightness of the star is @xmath23 mag ( see extended data fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> although the exact cause of the mass - transfer rate increase remains unknown , its magnitude is consistent with irradiation of the secondary@xcite rather than the interaction between nova ejecta and a companion star ( unless the eruption was very asymmetric)@xcite@xmath3@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> most known pre- and post - novae have the same brightness@xcite@xmath3@xcite and hence the same mass - transfer rate . </S>",
    "<S> we asked why v1213 cen exploded as a classical nova during the dwarf nova stage . </S>",
    "<S> v1213  cen was a fast nova , so the white dwarf should be massive ( @xmath24 ) and the ignition mass should have been relatively small ( @xmath25)@xcite . the mass that accumulated immediately after the previous nova eruption ( and before the start of hibernation ) must have been close to the ignition mass , which is consistent with the theoretical predictions for the duration of the irradiation - induced high mass - transfer rate ( @xmath26 yrs)@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this timescale suggests a natural definition of recurrent novae ( a small group of novae for which at least two eruptions have been recorded ) as novae that have inter - eruption times short enough that they do not fall into hibernation . </S>",
    "<S> another possibility is that the 2009 eruption was the first nova explosion in this system ; however , we consider this hypothesis unlikely because most cataclysmic variables start their evolution at longer orbital periods .    </S>",
    "<S> v1213 cen is now slowly fading . what will be its fate </S>",
    "<S> ? one can expect that the system will remain bright for a few decades and then it will again transform into a dwarf nova , following the hibernation theory predictions . </S>",
    "<S> there are four known cases of post - novae that showed dwarf - nova - like outbursts . </S>",
    "<S> v446 her ( nova herculis 1960 ) is the system most resembling v1213 cen . </S>",
    "<S> it has a similar orbital period of 4.97 h@xcite . since the 1990s it has been showing low - amplitude outbursts@xcite similar to those observed in other long - period ( 310 hr ) dwarf novae . on the other hand , two other novae  gk per ( nova persei 1901 ) and v1017 sgr ( nova sagittari 1919 )  exhibit regular dwarf nova outbursts with amplitudes of 1 - 3 mag and recurrence times of years . </S>",
    "<S> their outbursts are much longer than in other dwarf novae , because their orbital periods are unusually long ( 1.99 and 5.7 days , respectively ) , indicating that the secondary is an evolved star@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , they are not typical cataclysmic binaries ( with low - mass main - sequence secondaries ) . </S>",
    "<S> finally , bk lyn , which has been proposed to be the chinese nova of 101 ad has , recently undergone the transition from a nova - like to a dwarf nova@xcite , which can be interpreted as a sign of hibernation@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> bk lyn is a short - period system ( 1.80 h ) , so the irradiation effect might be stronger there than in long - period novae . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the time required to the switch was considerably longer ( @xmath27 years ) for bk lyn than for the other three cases .    </S>",
    "<S> v1213 cen with its well known pre- and post - eruption behaviour can become a rosetta stone for nova evolution studies . </S>",
    "<S> its extensive follow - up observations in the next decades will enable further tests of the long - term nova evolution . </S>"
