    "the intended meaning of _ sheafifiable _ is best illustrated by some examples :    ( simplicial sheaves ) + [ jar ] quillen s homotopy theory of simplicial sets can be extended to simplicial sheaves over a site ( i.e.  category @xmath0 with a grothendieck topology @xmath1 ) as follows .",

    "a weak equivalence is a map that induces isomorphisms on the homotopy sheaves for arbitrary local basepoints .",

    "( simplicial objects in a topos ) + [ joy ] a topos is a category equivalent to the category of sheaves on some site ; so a category of simplicial sheaves is a category of simplicial objects in a topos . in 1984",
    ", a.  joyal @xcite extended quillen s homotopy theory of simplicial sets to simplicial objects in a topos @xmath3 as follows : for @xmath4 , its homotopy groups can be constructed  by purely categorical operations in @xmath3  as objects ( with algebraic structure ) over @xmath5 .",

    "the rest is as above .",
    "it is not hard to see that the two constructions prescribe identical homotopy model structures for the same category . for any topos @xmath3 , there exist many ( in fact , a proper class ) of sites whose categories of sheaves are all equivalent to @xmath3 ; joyal s result contains the additional information that to all such sites , ex .",

    "( simplicial rings ) + [ siring ] quillen  @xcite proves that the category of simplicial rings possesses a homotopy model structure ; the forgetful functor @xmath8 detects weak equivalences and fibrations .",
    "he leaves open the question whether the same is true for _ sheaves _ of simplicial rings .",
    "the answer is affirmative : if @xmath9 denotes the category of ring objects of a topos @xmath3 , then with the help of the canonical forgetful functor @xmath10 one can endow @xmath11 with a model structure . the remark in the paragraph following ex .",
    "[ joy ] applies here as well : since @xmath12 carries an intrinsic homotopy structure ( i.e.  independent of having chosen a site for @xmath3 first ) , the same is true for @xmath11 .",
    "( small categories and categorical equivalences ) + there is a `` folk model structure '' on @xmath13 , the category of small categories : the weak equivalences are the functors that induce an equivalence of categories , and the cofibrations the functors that are injective on objects .",
    "joyal and tierney  @xcite proved that ( internal ) category objects of any topos carry a homotopy model structure with weak equivalences those functors that are ( in the internal sense ) full , faithful and essentially surjective , and cofibrations those functors that are monos on the object part .",
    "( in the topos of sets , this specializes to the case of @xmath13 mentioned above .",
    "it is distinct from the homotopy theory of @xmath13 introduced by thomason  @xcite  which , incidentally , sheafifies as well . )",
    "[ sstack ]    observe that in each case    * one takes as granted a homotopy theory of structured sets , and attempts to build one for sheaves of such structures .",
    "the passage is not arbitrary ; for example , weak equivalences in the latter are locally weak equivalences in the former . *",
    "the homotopy structure is functorial in the topos , not merely in the site defining the topos .",
    "( this is the difference between ex .  [ jar ] and  [ joy ] . ) * if @xmath14 is a topos morphism - topos for a fixed universe @xmath15 whose elements are called simply _",
    "sets_. ] , then the inverse image functor @xmath16 preserves the weak equivalences and cofibrations of the homotopy model structure associated to @xmath17 , and induces a quillen adjoint pair between the corresponding model categories . in particular , the `` stalk '' at a point @xmath18 is the set - based homotopy model category one started with ; so , in this sense , one may think of the structure @xmath17 is endowed with as a `` sheaf of homotopy theories with constant stalk '' . *",
    "the homotopy model categories in question are all cofibrantly generated .",
    "_ outline of this paper .",
    "_ it is not hard to find a precise sense of what was loosely referred to above as `` structured sets '' and `` sheaves of such structures '' , and to guess what additional criteria the weak equivalences and cofibrations should satisfy if ( 3 ) is desired . as to ( 4 )",
    ", in the present context it rests on a theorem of jeffrey smith that promises to be valuable in the study of set - theoretically well - behaved quillen model categories ; see thm .",
    "the main result of this paper , [ auto ] , is a meta - theorem to the following effect : if the ingredients of a homotopy model category are given by suitable data so that they can be interpreted in any topos , and over @xmath19 it does satisfy quillen s axioms , then it does so ( functorially ) in any topos .",
    "there are mild conditions on the syntax , and a single ( annoying ) set - theoretical one : cofibrations have to be generated by a set .",
    "we give six instances of the main result , some known , some new .",
    "perhaps it is worthwhile to point out that the known cases had been obtained through independent and fairly laborious methods .",
    "the goal here is to invest enough labor so that what _ is _",
    "tautological becomes visibly so .",
    "two corollaries may deserve attention : the existence of quillen model categories on simplicial objects in a topos with the class of cofibrations smaller than all monos ( example  [ bkmono ] ) , and existence of the unbounded derived category of any grothendieck abelian category ( prop .",
    "[ unbounded ] ) .",
    "this latter fact is certainly folklore , but the proof via presentable model categories makes localization arguments easier as well .",
    "perhaps it is useful to devote a few paragraphs to sketching how a topos may be thought of as a geometric object , and why ( and when ) it is worthwhile to do so .",
    "this is independent of the technical content matter of the paper , and readers acquainted with grothendieckian sheaf theory should skip to the next section .",
    "many types of geometric objects  manifolds , orbifolds , algebraic spaces , schemes  are locally isomorphic to a fixed collection of distinguished models , and the chief strength of sheaf theory is to make this precise and to classify the extent to which such geometric objects may be non - isomorphic globally .",
    "grothendieck observed that in many cases , the natural notion of morphism between geometric objects leads to one and the selfsame kind of adjunction between their associated categories of sheaves .",
    "he suggested that topological ( homotopical ) invariants be thought of as belonging to the abstract category of sheaves ( the topos ) , functorially in topos morphisms , rather than to the chosen representation in terms of a site associated to the geometric object .",
    "there are fruitful aspects of this point of view .",
    "an invariant constructed from a topos will have avatars in many contexts , and several global properties of the category of topoi  for example , analogues of compactness , mapping spaces and classifying spaces  indeed make them similar to `` spaces '' .",
    "there are also drawbacks , notably the lack ( to date ) of any `` cellular '' or `` skeletal '' or `` dimension - theoretic '' approach to an abstract topos , though these are often the tools used to break up and understand a geometric object .",
    "( instead , one may try to replace an unwieldy topos by a more combinatorial structure with isomorphic invariants ; for example , a pro - simplicial set or sheaves on a simple grothendieck topology , such as a poset . ) but there is another , distinctly post - grothendieckian approach , which sees any category of set - valued sheaves as very similar in _ some _ formal properties to the category of sets .",
    "consequently the homological ( homotopical ) algebra of sheaves of structures  through which one hopes to capture invariants of the topos  ought to be similar in _ some _ formal aspects to plain homological ( homotopical ) algebra with no grothendieck topology in sight .",
    "the onus is on making precise the qualifier `` some '' .",
    "let us believe that quillen s axioms provide an adequate calculus for homotopical manipulations .",
    "the question i sought to answer was : what formal properties should a homotopy theory satisfy if one wishes to `` lift '' it into any category of sheaves as functorially as the homological algebra of @xmath20-modules can be lifted ?",
    "note that the topos realm has proven to be a fertile ground for finding cohomological functors ( which ought to be thought of as just a part of homotopy theory ) with prescribed properties .",
    "this note , however , is only concerned with a foundational outlook .    _",
    "_ the seeds of the techniques that provide an answer to the motivating question were sown ( with the exception of coherent logic ) by grothendieck s school , but matured only later .",
    "the makkai ",
    "par  @xcite theory of accessibility is both a simplification and a far - reaching extension of the notion of @xmath21-accessibility ( possibly the most technical part of sga4 ) .",
    "see the introduction to @xcite for a full discussion of the prehistory .",
    "the concept of locally presentable category was isolated by gabriel and ulmer by pondering localizations of abelian categories and sheaf reflections ; cf .",
    "ulmer  @xcite . both of these are , ultimately , set - theoretical notions that allow one ( in the present context ) to treat with ease arbitrary sites , even those lacking finiteness properties , points etc . as to the deployment of mathematical logic , exotic as it may seem in a paper devoted to abstract homotopy theory , it is useful for two reasons",
    ". first , it allows one to parametrize formal homotopy theories that have the right functorial behavior without lapsing into vagueness as to what constitutes a `` structure '' or a `` correct definition '' .",
    "( for example , between the two ways of saying that a functor induces an equivalence of categories  namely , that it has a quasi - inverse , or that it is full , faithful and essentially surjective , cf .  ex .",
    "[ sstack ]  the difference is precisely that the second one proceeds within the language of limits and colimits of graphs while the first one does nt : it mentions _",
    "there exists a functor _ that is a quasi - inverse@xmath22 ) secondly , one has powerful theorems to the following effect : _ if _ a mathematical statement , formulated within the bounds of a specific logical syntax , holds for structured sets _ then _ it holds for like structured objects of any topos .",
    "these theorems are essential to the main thm .",
    "further comparisons with existing work are given in the text in the form of remarks which , i hope , do not distract the reader .    _ omissions .",
    "_ theorem  [ auto ] engulfs motivating examples [ joy ] and [ sstack ] , but not [ siring ] .",
    "the reason is that the case of the forgetful functor from simplicial algebraic theories to the underlying objects , and many other such right adjoint situations , demand a slightly more involved treatment , purely by virtue of the more complicated description of cofibrations .",
    "they are grouped together in the main theorem of @xcite , part of which is concerned with setting up a logical background that permits arguments similar to e.g.  cor .  [ condi2 ] .",
    "also , this paper is concerned solely with structures ( in the sense of footnote  [ sgafoot ] ) whose coefficients are constant , i.e.  come from the base topos @xmath19 .",
    "thus , the results would apply to the category of @xmath20-modules in a topos if @xmath20 is constant , but not to an arbitrary ringed topos .",
    "many of the most interesting topos - theoretic quillen model categories take non - constant parameters ; for example , voevodsky s @xmath23-local homotopy theory of simplicial objects , where @xmath23 is an `` interval object '' in the topos , or @xmath24-equivariant simplicial objects , where @xmath24 is a ( not necessarily constant ) simplicial group .",
    "the mixture of set - theoretic and logical tools used in this paper is robust enough to apply to such situations , but pursuing just those two threads is probably more important than a bid at all - encompassing generality",
    ".    acknowledgments .",
    "i d like to thank michael makkai and ji rosick for making themselves accessible , phil hirschhorn and charles rezk for being model correspondents , and ieke moerdijk and jaap van oosten for being very logical .",

    "s suggestion , background material on formal homotopy theory and on categorical logic is given in the body of the text , rather than in an appendix .",
    "this makes for quite a slow start in sections 1 and 2 , but my guess is that each reader will be able to skip a good half of the preliminaries  though possibly different halves .",
    "in this article , the terms _ quillen model category _ and _ homotopy model category _ will both refer to what quillen  @xcite calls _ closed model category_.
