    "in this paper , we investigate the random dynamics of rational maps on the riemann sphere @xmath0 and the dynamics of rational semigroups ( i.e. , semigroups of non - constant rational maps where the semigroup operation is functional composition ) on @xmath1 we see that the both fields are related to each other very deeply .",
    "in fact , we develop both theories simultaneously .",
    "one motivation for research in complex dynamical systems is to describe some mathematical models on ethology .",
    "for example , the behavior of the population of a certain species can be described by the dynamical system associated with iteration of a polynomial @xmath3 such that @xmath4 preserves the unit interval and the postcritical set in the plane is bounded ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . however , when there is a change in the natural environment , some species have several strategies to survive in nature . from this point of view",
    ", it is very natural and important not only to consider the dynamics of iteration , where the same survival strategy ( i.e. , function ) is repeatedly applied , but also to consider random dynamics , where a new strategy might be applied at each time step .",
    "the first study of random complex dynamics was given by j. e. fornaess and n. sibony ( @xcite ) .",

    "see the author s works @xcite .",
    "the first study of dynamics of rational semigroups was conducted by a. hinkkanen and g. j. martin ( @xcite ) , who were interested in the role of the dynamics of polynomial semigroups ( i.e. , semigroups of non - constant polynomial maps ) while studying various one - complex - dimensional moduli spaces for discrete groups , and by f. ren s group ( @xcite ) , who studied such semigroups from the perspective of random dynamical systems . since the julia set @xmath5 of a finitely generated rational semigroup @xmath6 has `` backward self - similarity , ''",
    "i.e. , @xmath7 ( see lemma  [ l : bss ] and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma 1.1.4 ) ) , the study of the dynamics of rational semigroups can be regarded as the study of `` backward iterated function systems , '' and also as a generalization of the study of self - similar sets in fractal geometry .    for recent work on the dynamics of rational semigroups , see the author s papers @xcite@xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "in order to consider the random dynamics of a family of polynomials on @xmath0 , let @xmath8 be the probability of tending to @xmath9 starting with the initial value @xmath10 in this paper , we see that under certain conditions , the function @xmath11 $ ] is continuous on @xmath0 and has some singular properties ( for instance , varies only on a thin fractal set , the so - called julia set of a polynomial semigroup ) , and this function is a complex analogue of the devil s staircase ( cantor function ) or lebesgue s singular functions ( see example  [ ex : dc1 ] , figures  [ fig : dcjulia ] , [ fig : dcgraphgrey2 ] , and [ fig : dcgraphudgrey2 ] ) . before going into detail ,",
