    "we develop the protocol in several steps .",
    "first , we show that the system of interest can be actively brought to its ground state by replacing its controlled part with fresh `` cold '' qubits from a memory .",
    "we then find that cooling implies that the information about the initial system state is transferred into the memory , and design a linear map that decodes this information .",
    "since this map is generally not unitary , we use the polar decomposition to find its best unitary approximation .",
    "the fidelity of information decoding can then be lower bounded by the overlap of the system state with its ground state .",

    "[ sec : fid ] it will be shown that by augmenting @xmath16 one can make the fidelity arbitrarily close to one .",
    "we assume that the memory is initialized in a factorized state of the form @xmath17 where @xmath18 is a state whose properties will be specified in the following . to download a generic state",

    "our main assumption is that the map @xmath33 is ergodic with pure fixed point which we denote as @xmath34 .",
    "explicitly this means that the only state which is left invariant by @xmath33 is the vector @xmath34 , i.e. @xmath35 as shown in refs .",
    "@xcite this implies that the channel @xmath33 is relaxing ( mixing ) , that is @xmath36 for _ all _ @xmath37 .",
    "this condition gives rise to the controllability of the system .",
    "indeed from eq .",
    "( [ fafa ] ) it follows that for sufficiently large @xmath16 , an initial state of the form @xmath38 can be approximated as @xmath39 the right hand side of this equation factorizes into pure states because the transformation @xmath40 is unitary , and because both the initial state of @xmath6 and @xmath7 and the final state of @xmath6 are pure .",
    "this implies that , in the asymptotic limit of infinitely many protocol steps ( i.e. @xmath41 ) , the system @xmath6 has been `` cooled '' into the state @xmath42 while all the information regarding the initial state @xmath29 must be contained in the vector @xmath43  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it is at least intuitively clear that such information can be recovered by the application of a proper unitary `` decoding '' operation @xmath44 on @xmath7 which does not depend on the input state of the system ( _ decoding _ stage ) , i.e.  @xcite @xmath45 at a mathematical level , the convergence of the downloading protocol described above only depends upon the invariant property  ( [ condition20 ] )  see ref .",

    "to do this , you first use the downloading protocol to make sure that the system is in the state @xmath42 ( `` cooling '' ) .",

    "of course it remains to be shown that _",
    "unknown _ states can be written to the system , too .",
    "this and the mathematical details will be discussed in the next section .",
    "another problem with eq .",
    "( [ recu ] ) is that the recurrence parameter @xmath48 typically needs to be _ huge _ , scaling double exponentially with the number of qubits in the system .",
    "there are however alternative , more efficient ways of implementing an uploading process from @xmath7 to @xmath6 .",
    "the simplest one is of course to apply the inverse transformation @xmath50 to the state of eq .",

    "@xcite is based on this idea , which is a generalization of  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately the inverse of @xmath40 is generally unphysical in the sense that it requires backward time evolutions @xmath51 , i.e. one would have to wait _ negative _ time steps between the swaps ( see however ref .",
    "@xcite for cases in which such an inverse time evolution can be implemented by clever external control techniques ) .    to overcome this problem we introduce an extra hypothesis .",
    "specifically we consider the case in which the invariant property  ( [ condition20 ] ) holds also for the channel @xmath52 obtained from eq .",

    "therefore , by imposing the condition  ( [ condition20 ] ) on @xmath52 , we are able to define an uploading protocol which transfers an unknown state @xmath59 from @xmath7 to @xmath6 .",
    "similarly to the downloading scheme it is composed by two stages : an _ encoding _ stage in which we apply the unitary transformation @xmath58 to `` prepare '' the memory @xmath7 and a _ swapping _ stage in which we apply the unitary @xmath62 by recursively coupling @xmath1 to the @xmath7 through swaps .",
    "two remarks are mandatory . on one hand , as in the case of the downloading protocol , the convergence of the transformation  ( [ hhhprime1 ] ) only depends upon the invariant condition  ( [ condition20 ] ) of the channel @xmath52 . on the other hand ,",
    "there exists a large class of physically relevant hamiltonians @xmath12 ( e.g. nearest neighbors heisenberg coupling hamiltonians ) for which both @xmath33 and @xmath52 verify the such condition  we refer the reader to ref .",
    "@xcite for details . for such hamiltonians ,",
    "our analysis will yield both a simple downloading and uploading mechanism .",
    "putting these two elements together one can also realize more sophisticated controls .",
