    "the lep experiments aleph , delphi , l3 and opal have collected 700 pb@xmath2 of annihilation data from 1989 to 2000 .",
    "final qcd analyses of these data using the latest detector simulation and advanced correction techniques are now being published .",
    "the experiments presented cumulative summary papers including various centre - of - mass energies and a wide collection of observable . the experimental systematic uncertainties are for many observables as small as 1@xmath3 , and the statistical errors typically 0.1 @xmath3 . hence , these data of un - preceeded precision will serve as reference for future experiments .",
    "this report summarises recent measurements of @xmath1 from event shapes and 4-jet observables , investigations of power law corrections and results on qcd colour factors .",
    "theoretical calculations for event - shape distributions are available at next - to - leading order ( nlo ) complemented by all - orders resummation of large leading and sub - leading logarithms ( nlla ) for certain observables . a unified prescription for the matching of fixed - order and resummed calculations , the so - called modified logr matching scheme , has recently been suggested @xcite and is applied by the lep experiments for their analysis .",
    "the most commonly used variables are thrust , heavy jet mass , wide and total jet broadenings , c - parameter and @xmath4 , the 3-jet resolution parameter in durham scheme .",
    "these observables were also selected by the lep qcd working group for a lep combination @xcite .",
    "a virtue of event - shape distributions compared to other observables is that even with limited event statistics at lep2 energies a measurement of @xmath1 is possible with a reasonable precision and enables the observation of the energy evolution of @xmath1 .",
    "( 75,72 ) ( -5,-3 )    an example of a final analysis is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : alephbw ] where the measurements of the wide jet broadening variable at all lep energies are compared to the result of fits with the nlo+nlla theoretical prediction .",
    "aleph has in addition applied a perturbative nlo correction for the b - quark mass . in general the description of the data",
    "is good , although restricted to the central part of the distributions at lep1 where the high precision of the data requires nnlo calculations .",
    "the measurements have been corrected for acceptance and detector resolution effects and the fits are carried out at hadron level .",
    "therfore , the perturbative prediction is folded to the hadron level by means of transition matrix accounting for the hadronisation , obtained from standard qcd generators like pythia , herwig or ariadne .",
    "the systematic uncertainties for the measurement of @xmath1 is dominated by theoretical uncertainties induced by missing higher orders .",
    "the lep qcd working group advises the recommendation of @xcite for the estimation of perturbative uncertainties .",
    "this method combines different estimates in the uncertainty band method , which takes not only standard renormalisation scale variations but also a variation of @xmath5 , the resummed logarithmic variable re - scaling factor , into account @xcite .",
    "the measurements using different variables and different energies are combined in single numbers per @xmath6 and finally using the qcd - predicted evolution in global result for @xmath7 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : l3run ] the combined result from l3 for @xmath8 is shown , including also measurements using radiative events resulting in reduced centre - of - mass energies below @xmath9 .",
    "( 75,55 ) ( -2,0 )    the experiments have applied different techniques for their combinations in terms of the correlation of systematic uncertainties , but in all cases the theoretical uncertainties appear to be largely correlated , both between different variables and between different energies . as a consequence ,",
    "the gain in precision of the combined measurements in limited and the combined uncertainty appears as average rather than an improved uncertainty .",
    "aleph has carried out a global analysis of 6 variables at 8 energies between 91 and 206 gev @xcite , based on an integrated luminosity of about 700 pb@xmath10 .",
    "their combined result for @xmath7 is a weighted average with weights proportional to the inverse square of the total individual errors . to account for correlations of systematic uncertainties",
    "the whole combination is repeated separately for all the individual variations of the analysis .",
    "the final result is @xmath11    l3 presented in a collective preprint @xcite various studies of qcd , including measurements of @xmath1 from an earlier publication @xcite .",
    "they combined the same five variables , but excluded @xmath12 .",
    "measurements at reduced centre - of - mass energies using radiative events were included .",
    "theoretical uncertainties are estimated by a variation of the renormalisation scale and different matching schemes .",
    "l3 has chosen at lep2 very large fit ranges , in contrast to all other experiments , in order to reduce the statistical uncertainty .",
    "this leads on the other side to larger theoretical errors .",
    "the combination method proceeds in two steps : first an unweighted average of the five variables is build at each @xmath6 , second these combined measurements are fit by the qcd evolution for @xmath13 . at that stage correlations are included by the assumption of minimal overlap of systematic uncertainties .",
    "the result of this combination is : @xmath14    delphi updated a publication @xcite on event - shapes with a new re - analysis @xcite according to the lep qcd scheme .",
    "traditionally delphi presents measurements based on three perturbative methods : the standard modified logr matching scheme , the pure nlla calculation ( valid only in a narrow 2-jet region ) and the fixed order prediction alone with an optimised scale @xmath15 .",
    "the perturbative uncertainties are estimated by a variation of @xmath5 only for the logr / nlla schemes and by a renormalisation scale variation of a factor of two around the optimum @xmath15 .",
    "the same set of variables as used by l3 is combined at energies between 89 and 207 gev , hence including also off - peak data at 89 and 93 gev separately .",
    "the combination technique applied by delphi follows closely the lep qcd ansatz , but makes in addition the minimum overlap assumption for hadronisation and perturbative systematic uncertainties .",
    "the final result , split into the three perturbative schemes , reads as : @xmath16    opal is currently preparing a new analysis on @xmath1 from event shapes and preliminary results were already included in the lep average . in the last opal publication @xcite data from lep up to 189 gev were combined with lower - energy data from jade at 35 and 44 gev .",
    "the variables are the differential 2-jet rate ( equivalent to @xmath4 ) and the mean jet multiplicity using the durham and cambridge jet - finding algorithms .",
    "the combined result is : @xmath17 where a significantly asymmetric uncertainty is observed for the scale variation .",
    "non - perturbative effects in hadronic observables in @xmath0 annihilation are scaling with powers of @xmath18 and can be described by analytical models of power law corrections @xcite .",
    "power corrections in the spirit of these models are related to infrared divergences of the perturbative expansion at low scales .",
    "analytical calculations introduce one additional phenomenological parameter @xmath19 , @xmath20 which measures effectively the strength of the coupling up to an infrared matching scale @xmath21 of the order of a few gev .",
    "the parameter @xmath19 is expected to be universal and must be determined by experiment , usually in conjunction with @xmath1 .",
    "an improved theoretical prediction is obtained by merging perturbative and non - perturbative terms .",
    "this yields for event - shape mean values , @xmath22 for a generic variable @xmath23 , where the additive power correction term is given by @xmath24 with a variable - dependent constant @xmath25 . in event - shape distributions",
    "the power correction appears as a shift of the perturbative spectrum by the same additive term @xmath26 for the jet broadenings this shift is not constant but depends on the value of the broadening . in fig .",
    "[ fig : pcmean ] different mean values are shown as function of @xmath27 and compared to pure perturbative and power - corrected predictions .",

    "a wealth of measurements of hadronic observables has been provided in 11 years of data taking at the lep collider .",
    "these measurements allowed the lep collaborations to perform detailed tests of perturbative qcd and determinations of the fundamental parameters . a collection of the most important results is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : chart ] .",
    "all collaborations have provided measurements of @xmath1 from event - shape distributions and combined individual results from various variables at energies from @xmath9 to 209 gev .",
    "the systematic uncertainties are dominated by missing higher orders and in order to match the experimental accuracy of 1 @xmath3 nnlo calculations are required .",
    "event - shapes have further been investigated in the context of power - law corrections .",
    "simultaneous fits have been carried out to determine the non - perturbative parameter @xmath19 and @xmath1 .",
    "while the qualitative description of the data is good , the quantitative interpretation is not unambiguous since the value of @xmath1 with power corrections is significantly lower than with monte carlo corrections for hadronisation .",
    "furthermore , the predicted universality of @xmath19 is verified at the level of 20@xmath3 of its precision only .",
    "in particular the jet broadening variables need to be further investigated .",

    "new measurements of @xmath1 from the 4-jet rate using these calculations have been presented .",
    "the precision of this method is very good and yields a 1 @xmath3 uncertainty for missing higher orders .",
