    "recently much research has been undertaken to understand the subtle interplay between _ quantum entanglement _ and _ quantum criticality _ for spin systems @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that the entanglement between a block of contiguous spins and its complement in the ground state of the ising model shows different behaviours for the gapped and gapless cases ( critical and non - critical ) .",
    "the entanglement of the vbs ground state of the much - studied affleckkennedyliebtasaki ( aklt ) model @xcite is considered in refs .",
    "@xcite , and very recently campos venuti _",
    "_ studied this state s long - distance entanglement property @xcite .",
    "the entanglement of the fermionic system was studied in refs.@xcite .",
    "while much theoretical work in this area has focused on periodic boundary conditions , the open boundary condition has also attracted recent attention @xcite .",
    "@xcite numerically studied the boundary effects in the critical scaling of entanglement entropy ( von neumann entropy of a block of spins ) for the ( gapless ) 1d xxz model , and found the entanglement entropy _ slowly _ decays away from the boundary with a power - law .",
    "this result can be interpreted as stating that in critical systems , the boundary effects to the entanglement entropy is quasi - long - ranged ; _ i.e. _ there is a quasi - long - ranged entanglement between the boundaries and the subsystem in question .",
    "this agrees with the fact that entanglement entropy increases logarithmically with the size of the subsystem in critical systems @xcite .",
    "by contrast , the entanglement entropy for non - critical systems saturates to a constant bound when the subsystem size is increased , implying that the entanglement in the bulk is short - ranged .",
    "it is this localised nature of the entanglement entropy around the block edges which gives rise to an area law @xcite and makes ground states of gapped 1d systems particuarly amenable to simulation through matrix product states ( mps ) @xcite .",
    "one might expect that boundary effects to the entanglement entropy also have different behaviours for critical and non - critical systems , and an interesting question then is whether the boundary effects to the entanglement entropy are short- or long - ranged , and what the exact behaviour of these are .",
    "this is one of the main motivations of this work : here we study the entanglement entropy of a vbs with general open boundary conditions .",
    "_ we will show that , in contrast with the critical xxz chain , the boundary effect to the entanglement entropy in the vbs state is short - ranged .",
    "_ we will also show that the saturated bound for this state is the sum of von neumann entropy of the two boundaries .",
    "furthermore , it is not a constant ( as is the case for a fixed boundary condition ) ; it varies for different boundary conditions .",
    "this saturated bound in 1d state corresponds to the area law for higher - dimensional systems .",
    "this model was originally studied by affleck _",
    "_ in the context of the haldane conjecture @xcite .",
    "it has also been the focus of much renewed interest since its generalisation to mpswhich have been shown to efficiently simulate many 1d systems @xcite and may be used as a variational set in density matrix renormalisation group ( dmrg ) calculations@xcite and the discovery that its analogue in 2d is a resource for universal quantum computation @xcite .",
    "we hope that studying the boundary effect on the entanglement entropy will give some further insight into this model .",
    "since the boundary effects to the block entanglement entropy decays fast , we expect the the dmrg method can be applied efficiently to this model .",
    "the spin-1 vbs state with general open boundary conditions ( gobc ) @xcite takes the form : @xmath1 q_{r}^q|{\\rm vac}\\rangle\\label{generalvbs}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath2 are bosonic operators , @xmath3 and @xmath4 are respectively the left and right boundary operators ; @xmath5 with @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 ; @xmath10 is the vacuum state ; and @xmath11 are integer numbers . since the left and right boundary operators are mutually independent , there are altogether four different vbs states with gobc .",
    "note that all sites in the spin chain including the left and right boundary sites @xmath12 , @xmath13 are spin-1 s .",
    "thus this vbs state ( [ generalvbs ] ) is different from that studied in ref .",
    "we should also note one boundary operator , for example , @xmath14 changes the boundary state @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "in fact , the state ( [ generalvbs ] ) is the ground state of the the hamiltonian studied by affleck _",
    "@xcite , @xmath17 .",
    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "for convenience in later calculations , we divide this 1d state into three parts : the left - hand , central and right - hand parts .",
    "the left - hand part is defined as @xmath18 . finally , the central part is written latexmath:[$|{\\rm central}\\rangle = \\prod _ { k=1}^{l } ( a^{\\dag } _ k b^{\\dag}_{k+1}-b^{\\dag } _ k a^{\\dag } _ { k+1 } )    central parts , and acts as two spin-1/2 s ; site @xmath0 similarly appears in both the central and right parts .",
    "thus the whole vbs state with gobc now takes the form @xmath20 .",
    "we should note that this is not strictly a product state , but that this decomposition is valid for our purposes .",
    "double - counting is avoided since each bulk spin consists of two spin-1/2 s and the two bosonic operators ( spin-1/2 s ) in one site constitute a spin-1 state by fock space representation .",
    "for example , terms @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "thus the three parts are connected to constitute the original state ( [ generalvbs ] ) .",
    "our aim is to now study the von neumann entropy of the reduced density operator of the contiguous spins from site 1 to @xmath0 of the state @xmath23 . for this aim ,",
    "according to the theory of entanglement , the left- and right part states @xmath24 and @xmath25 can be replaced by two bipartite states , through the schmidt decomposition .    without loss of generality , we start from the left part and consider the entanglement of the quantum state @xmath24 between site 1 and the rest ; _ i.e. _ we consider it a bipartite state with site @xmath26 as one particle and the rest as another particle . according to the schmidt decomposition , we can first calculate eigenvalues of the reduced density operator of site 1 for state @xmath24 .",

    "we find that the reduced density operator @xmath44 converges to the identity exponentially fast with respect to @xmath46 , and thus we can simply consider @xmath47 as a singlet state @xmath48 when @xmath49 . similarly for right part of the state , we have @xmath50 , where the @xmath51 have a similar definition to the @xmath52 . thus the vbs state in eq .",

    "the entanglement entropy of this state has been studied previously @xcite ; it was found that there are no boundary effects . in this paper ,",
    "one of our main concerns is to show that the vbs state ( [ generalvbs ] ) _ does _ have a boundary effect .",
    "already we know that if the block of @xmath0 contiguous spins in eq .",
    "( [ generalvbs ] ) is far from the two boundary sites the boundary effect will decay very rapidly ( exponentially ) .",
    "we now present explicitly the entanglement entropy of these @xmath0 spins .",
    "let us first rewrite the left part state in the form @xmath62 , where the matrix form of @xmath63 takes the form @xmath64 .",
    "note that @xmath63 is not necessarily unitary . in a similar manner for right part state , @xmath65",
    "can also be defined @xmath66 , giving @xmath67 .",
    "we can then write the vbs with gobc in the form : @xmath68 where the summation is from 1 to 3 for indices @xmath69 . according to entanglement theory ,",
    "the von neumann entropy of the reduced density operator of @xmath0 spins is the same as the von neumann entropy of the two ends ( sites @xmath57 and @xmath58 ) .",
    "the reduced density operator of these sites takes the form @xmath70 where @xmath71 .    expanding this ,",
    "we find the following form for the density matrix : @xmath72 when @xmath73 is small the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath74 can be found by a taylor expansion to be @xmath75 ; @xmath76 ; @xmath77 ; @xmath78 . recall that @xmath47 is a pure state , so the reduced density operators at sites 0 and 1 are the same under unitary transformation ( _ i.e. _ @xmath79 ; similarly for state @xmath80 . by checking the eigenvalues of @xmath81 , we find that @xmath82 , where the equation is true under a unitary transformation .",
    "this transformation has no effect on the von neumann entropy , and thus we suppress it .",
    "the density operator of @xmath81 converges exponentially fast to the tensor product of two ends ; the speed is @xmath83 .",
    "finally we calculate explicitly the von neumann entropy of a block of @xmath0 spins , @xmath84 the von neumann entropy of @xmath0 spins converges to the von neumann entropy of two ends exponentially fast with convergence @xmath83 .",
    "the exact form of @xmath85 is written below.$ ] ] for a pure bipartite state @xmath47 , we know @xmath86 .",
    "when @xmath87 is small , we find @xmath88 and similarly for @xmath89 .",
    "so when the distances between the block of @xmath0 contiguous spins and the two ends are large , we know that @xmath90 note that when @xmath73 is comparable with @xmath87 and @xmath91 , then @xmath85 may have contributions for both @xmath87 and @xmath91 . considering all of these points , we conclude that boundary effects decay exponentially when the distances between the subsystem and the boundaries increase . in the case",
    "that there are no boundary operators , the trace in eq .",
    "( [ site1 ] ) is over the identity , and @xmath44 reduces to @xmath35 . hence the boundary effects to the entanglement entropy never arise ; this is the case previously studied @xcite .",
    "we remark for 1d vbs with gobc , the terms corresponding to the topological entropy in ref.@xcite are the boundary terms appeared in eq.([entropy ] ) , and they remain unchanged for @xmath92 .",
    "it was found numerically @xcite that for spin-1/2 xxz chains the entropy takes the form @xmath93 , where the second term arises from the boundary conditions , and can be written @xmath94 .",
    "note that the notation of ref .",
    "@xcite has been changed slightly here and @xmath95 , @xmath96 ; @xmath97 depends on the anisotropy parameter in the xxz chains and @xmath98 for an xx chain .",
    "we find that the boundary term decays slowly and is quasi - long - ranged , while for the vbs studied in this paper , the boundary terms in eq .",
    "( [ entropy ] ) decay exponentially fast .",
    "we next study the boundary effects to entanglement between only _ two spins _ in the bulk .",
    "consider spins @xmath26 , @xmath0 .",
    "the previous method still works ; _",
    "i.e. _ we can reduce the length of the chain from @xmath99 sites in eq .",
    "( [ generalvbs ] ) to a chain with only @xmath56 spins in eq .",
    "( [ state2 ] ) .",
    "this transformation does not change the entanglement between two spins at sites 1 and @xmath0 .",
    "we find that the density operator of the bipartite state is written @xmath100(\\sigma _ { \\alpha ' _ 1}\\otimes   \\sigma _ { \\alpha ' _",
    "l}^t ) ^{\\dagger } ( v_l\\otimes v_r)^\\dag\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the explicit form of this density matrix is complicated .",
    "however since the boundary matrices @xmath63 and @xmath65 become identities exponentially with @xmath46 and @xmath101 , we know that the boundary effects to this density operator decay exponentially if the separation of these two spins with the boundaries increase .",
    "thus the case that @xmath101 or @xmath46 is small already can provide enough information about the entanglement between the considered two spins .",
    "the cases @xmath102 and @xmath103 are special since they correspond to the cases that there are no boundary operators @xmath104 and @xmath43 , respectively .    in order to quantify the two - spin entanglement in this case",
    ", we shall use _ negativity _",
    ", @xmath105 @xcite .",
    "we find that there is no entanglement for non - nearest neighbouring spins ( regardless of boundary ) . the nearest - neighbour negativity for a range of @xmath46 , @xmath101 is presented in table [ negativitytable ] , where a factor @xmath106 is omitted .",
    ".nearest - neighbour negativity [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     curiously , we see that while boundary operators _ decrease _ the block von neumann entropysee eq.([ourresult])they _ increase _ the nearest - neighbour negativity .",
    "roughly , this can be understood that the entanglement is monogamous @xcite , i.e. , it can not be shared freely by many parties .",
    "a simple example about the monogamy of entanglement is that , suppose a , b and c are three parties , if a and b are maximally entangled , a and c will be separable .",
    "the result in this paper shows that the boundary operators have effect on the entanglement sharing in this many - body system .    in the table above , we see that for finite @xmath107 , it is always that case that @xmath108 .",
    "asymmetric boundary operators may also increase the entanglement .",
    "for example , @xmath109 for @xmath110 , but @xmath111 for @xmath112 .",
    "now @xmath105 does not vary monotonically with @xmath107 ; _",
    "e.g. _ when @xmath101 varies from 1 to @xmath113 ( for @xmath114 ) , @xmath105 oscillates . this seemingly new result may potentially be useful : nearest - neighbour entanglement may be controlled by tweaking boundaries .",
    "the drawback of the _ negativity _ is that the bound entanglement can not be detected and quantified .",
    "a complementary quantity derived from the realignment separability criterion can partially solve this problem @xcite .",
    "for a two - site density operator @xmath115 , this quantity is defined as @xmath116 , where the matrix @xmath117 is obtained from the density operator @xmath115 by the realignment method , and @xmath118 is the trace norm .",
    "the larger of the quantities @xmath105 and @xmath119 gives a lower bound of the _ concurrence _",
    "@xmath120 for a mixed state in arbitrary dimensional systems ; _ i.e. _ @xmath121 @xcite .",
    "using this measure , we still find zero entanglement between detected for non - nearest neighbouring spins regardless of boundary .",
    "the entanglement of nearest neighbouring spins by realignment is presented in table [ realignmenttable ] and a factor @xmath106 is also omitted .",
    "we also still find that the boundary operators increase entanglement @xmath119 , and indeed no entanglement is found for the case without boundary operators : this is due to the limitation of the realignment method .",
    "finally let us remark that for the model studied in this paper , the _ negativity _ provides a stronger lower bound for the _ concurrence_. since the concurrence for a general mixed state in @xmath122 is difficult to find , the entanglement measures by _ negativity _ and _ realignment _ are widely accepted .",
    "in summary , we studied the boundary effects to the entanglement entropy and the two - site entanglement for the spin-1 vbs state which is the ground state for a gapped model .",
    "we showed that the boundary effects are short - ranged , _",
    "i.e. _ they decays exponentially in the distance between the subsystem considered and the boundary sites .",
    "this is different from the case of xxz chain which is a gapless model .",
    "the two - site entanglement was studied by two entanglement measures , the negativity and the realignment method . for the vbs state",
    ", we find the boundary operators decrease the block von neumman entropy but increase the the nearest - neighbour entanglement measured by negativity and realignment .",
