    "among the radio pulsars that are found in binary systems , four belong to a subgroup where the pulsar has the characteristics of a young , isolated pulsar , but is orbiting a massive companion ( @xmath5m@xmath1 ) in a rather wide ( 502000day orbital period ) and eccentric ( @xmath6 ) orbit @xcite . the companion to the first of these systems ,",
    "psrb1259@xmath263 @xcite was identified as a @xmath7 early - type b2e star .",
    "psrj0045@xmath27319 , located in the smc , is the second system and has a @xmath8 b1v companion @xcite .",
    "no information on a possible counterpart has been published for the fourth system , psrj1638@xmath24725 @xcite .",
    "the third system , psr j1740@xmath23052 , was discovered by @xcite in the parkes multibeam survey @xcite as a young ( 350kyr ) pulsar .",
    "subsequent timing observations showed that the pulsar is part of a binary system with an orbital period of 231d and an eccentricity of 0.57 .",
    "the mass function of the pulsar yielded a lower limit to the mass of the companion of 11m@xmath1 .",
    "a candidate counterpart to psrj1740@xmath23052 was identified in near - infrared observations . from @xmath9-band spectra ,",
    "the counterpart was classified as late - type , having a spectral type between k5 and m3 @xcite .",
    "this identification is at odds with the binary parameters which set the roche lobe radius significantly smaller than that expected for a late - type star at the estimated distance .",
    "subsequent phase - resolved spectroscopic observations by @xcite confirmed the unlikeliness of the star being the binary companion , as no significant radial velocity variations consistent with the expected binary orbit were found .",
    "the nature of the massive binary companion remains unclear , and could be either an early - type main - sequence star or a compact remnant . though @xcite reported small variations in the dispersion measure of psrj1740@xmath23052 near periastron , which would be consistent with a stellar companion , they could not conclusively rule out a stellar mass black hole as the binary companion",
    ".    in this paper we report on interferometric radio observations to obtain an accurate position of the psrj1740@xmath23052 and adaptive optics corrected near - infrared observations to search for a stellar counterpart to psrj1740@xmath23052 .",

    "was set to 5s .",
    "the observation consisted of a 600s observation of 3c286 followed by 14 loops containing three sources : 90s on pmnj1751@xmath22524 , 90s on pmnj1820@xmath22528 and 930s on psrj1740@xmath23052 .",

    "imaging was performed using the robust weighting factor of unity as a compromise between resolution and sensitivity ; the resultant beam size was @xmath12 oriented @xmath13 east of north .",
    "wide - field imaging of the psrj1740@xmath23052 data was performed in order to clean side - lobes from numerous bright sources over the entire @xmath14 field of view .",
    "most notably , the @xmath15 diameter object known as _ the tornado _ ( see @xcite and references within ) , is only @xmath16 southwest of the pulsar . due to the lack of short interferometer spacings ,",
    "the ability to model and clean this source well was limited .",
    "fortunately the pulsar lies outside the worst side - lobes which emanate mostly north and south from the object .",
    "the pulsar was detected less than one beam - width from the position reported by @xcite with a flux density of @xmath17mjy . despite the best effort to clean the side - lobes of confusing sources ,",
    "the pulsar was found on top of residual large scale structure . in order to fit the position of the pulsar ,",
    "linear flux density slices were made along the right ascension and declination axes through the center of the detected pulsar .",

    "images were obtained in the @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31-bands using the s27 camera , which provides a 1k@xmath321k chip with a @xmath33pix@xmath34 pixel scale yielding a @xmath35 field - of - view .",
    "the late - type candidate counterpart of @xcite was used as a natural guide star for the wavefront sensor which corrects the atmospheric distortions in the incoming wavefront .",

    "our aim was to obtain an accurate absolute astrometric calibration of the naco images using the usno ccd astrograph catalog ( ucac3 ; @xcite ) to allow comparison with the interferometric pulsar position .",
    "the positional uncertainties of the standards in this catalog are 20mas for stars with @xmath36 and 70mas for @xmath37 , but with 1.3 stars per square arc - minute the star density in the direction of psrj1740@xmath23052 is low and none of the standards coincides with the naco field - of - view .    in order to allow calibration against the ucac3 catalog , imaging observations were obtained with two further instruments . narrow - band near - infrared images at 1.19 and 2.25@xmath38 m were taken with isaac @xcite , also at the vlt in june 2006 .",

    "the transfer of the astrometric solution from the @xmath41-band wfi image to the 1.19@xmath38 m isaac image used 56 stars , providing rms residuals of @xmath49 in right ascension and @xmath50 in declination .",
    "the solution was then transferred to the 2.25@xmath38 m image , using 120 stars yielding rms residuals of @xmath51 in right ascension and @xmath52 in declination .",
    "finally , 29 stars were used to transfer the solution to the naco @xmath31-band image obtained on july13 .",
    "the residuals of the transfer were @xmath51 in right ascension and @xmath53 in declination .",
    "the total uncertainty in the astrometry of the naco image is the quadratic sum of the uncertainties in the astrometric solutions , which amount to @xmath54 in right ascension and @xmath55 in declination and is dominated by the uncertainties in the calibration of the wfi image by the ucac3 catalog . even though multiple transfers of the astrometric solution are needed , it is still more accurate than the direct calibration of the 2.25@xmath38 m isaac image using 160 stars from the 2mass catalog @xcite , which yields residuals of @xmath56 in both coordinates .",
    "combined with the uncertainty of the interferometric position of psrj1740@xmath23052 the 95% confidence region on the naco images is an ellipse with a semi - minor axis of @xmath57 in right ascension and a semi - major axis of @xmath58 in declination .",

    "the radio timing observations by @xcite place several constraints on the properties of the companion . assuming the pulsar has a canonical mass of 1.4m@xmath1 , the measurements of the orbital period and semi - major axis limit the mass of the companion to @xmath73m@xmath1 .",

    "psrj1740@xmath23052 is one of the pulsars with the largest dm . for its line - of - sight ,",
    "distance estimates from models of the galactic electron density distribution based on the observed dm range from 8 to 14kpc @xcite and 6.3 to 11kpc @xcite .",
    "the cobe dust maps by @xcite set the maximum reddening for this line - of - sight at @xmath82 . using the @xcite relative extinction coefficients ,",
    "this is equivalent to a maximum @xmath83 and @xmath31-band absorption of @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "the nearest distinct line - of - sight of the galactic extinction model by @xcite is within @xmath86 of psrj1740@xmath23052 and estimates @xmath31-band absorption of @xmath87 at a distance of 5.0kpc , up to @xmath88 at 10.4kpc .",
    "this model determines the extinction distribution by comparing 2mass observations with predictions of a galactic stellar population synthesis model @xcite . for comparison ,",
    "the galactic extinction model by @xcite , where red clump stars in the 2mass observations are used to derive distance dependent extinction , estimates @xmath89 of 1.2 at 5.0kpc , 1.7 at 10kpc and 3.0 at 15kpc .",
    "hence , based on the observed @xmath31-band magnitude of the counterpart and a conservative estimate on the range of distances ( @xmath90 to 15kpc ) and absorptions ( @xmath91 to 3.0 ) , the absolute @xmath31-band magnitude of the counterpart falls in the range of @xmath92 to @xmath93 .",
    "stellar isochrones by @xcite show that main - sequence stars have @xmath94 .",
    "hence the observed limit on @xmath4 limits the @xmath95 reddening to @xmath96 . using the @xcite extinction coefficients",
    "this sets @xmath97 , which is consistent with the estimates from galactic absorption models",
    ". the observed limit on @xmath98 does not provide a better constraint .",
    "figure[fig : fig3 ] shows the predictions for mass and radius of the @xcite isochrones .",
    "they show that zero - age main - sequence stars with masses up to 25m@xmath1 will have absolute @xmath31-band magnitudes that satisfy the observed range of @xmath92 to @xmath93 .",
    "less massive but more evolved main - sequence stars up to ages of 20myr at 11m@xmath1 also satisfy this range .",
    "the constraints on the mass and brightness of the companion of psrj1740@xmath23052 show that the companion must be on the main - sequence .",
    "furthermore , since the isochrones predict that main - sequence stars more massive than 11m@xmath1 have @xmath99 the @xmath31-band distance modulus must be larger than @xmath100 , which suggests psrj1740@xmath23052 is located at the far end of the distance ranges estimated from galactic electron distribution models .",
    "since its discovery , it was unclear if the binary companion of psrj1740@xmath23052 was an early - type main - sequence star , a late - type giant , or a stellar mass black hole , though the data favored a main - sequence type companion . using accurate astrometric radio interferometry and adaptive optics corrected near - infrared imaging observations ,",
    "we show that the late - type star located near the pulsar position is located at the edge of the 95% confidence error ellipse of the interferometric radio position of the pulsar .",
    "this further strengthens the case made by @xcite and @xcite that it is not the binary companion to psrj1740@xmath23052 .    in the wings of the late - type star , and near the center of the error ellipse",
    ", we find a counterpart whose observed @xmath31-band magnitude is consistent with the expected mass and age of the binary companion to psrj1740@xmath23052 at the estimated distance and reddening to the system .",
    "we argue that this counterpart is the binary companion to psrj1740@xmath23052 .",
    "our observations show that the companion is on the main - sequence , which is consistent with the observations of both the small variations in the dispersion measure near periastron of the binary orbit , and the periastron advance being due to tidal and spin quadrupoles @xcite .",
    "these observations rule out the need for a black hole or a giant as the binary companion .    at @xmath101",
    "the companion is within reach of near - infrared spectrographs .",
    "adaptive optics would be a necessity to resolve the companion in the wings of the late - type star which is almost 6mag brighter in @xmath31 . to extract the spectrum of the companion an algorithm such as that of @xcite would be needed to resolve the blend .",
    "spectra of the companion could be used to further confirm the identification through radial velocity variations and the spectral classification .    with a massive main - sequence companion ,",
    "the psrj1740@xmath23052 system likely experienced a previous phase of mass transfer in which the progenitor of the pulsar lost its hydrogen envelope and the companion accreted a significant amount of mass ( for a review , see @xcite ) .",
    "the subsequent ( type ib ) supernova caused the orbit to become eccentric .",
    "in the next few million years the companion will evolve off the main - sequence and tidal forces will circularize the orbit when the star approaches roche lobe overflow . the ensuing common envelope phase will likely lead to a merger and the formation of a thorne - zytkow object @xcite as there is not enough energy in the orbit to unbind the envelope of the subgiant ( e.g.@xcite ) .",
