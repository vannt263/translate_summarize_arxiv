    "defects in protein quality control are associated with age - related diseases such as type ii diabetes , heart diseases , specific cancers and , most notably , neurodegenerative disorders ( e.g alzheimer s or parkinson s diseases ) @xcite .",
    "chaperones proteins are key players in protein quality control , and are present in all organisms . their broadly recognized role is to assist the folding process , and minimize protein aggregation .",
    "intriguingly , the action of most chaperones stringently depends on atp hydrolysis , although in most cases its precise role has not been fully understood .",
    "central among proteins is the 70 kda heat shock protein ( hsp70 ) .",
    "hsp70 is possibly the most versatile of the chaperones and takes part in disparate functions beyond quality control .",
    "it drives the translocation of hundreds of different proteins into mitochondria and the _ endoplasmic reticulum _ , disassembles functional oligomers and facilitates protein translation , among others @xcite . in order to be functional",
    ", hsp70s must be able to strongly bind to a diverse array of amino - acid sequence .",
    "the structure of hsp70 comprises two domains : the nucleotide binding domain ( nbd ) , where atp or adp are lodged , and the substrate binding domain ( sbd ) , which is made of two halves and is responsible for the interactions between hsp70s and their substrates @xcite , see fig .",

    "the spontaneous atpase rate of hsp70 is very low ( @xmath0 @xmath1 ) , but is greatly accelerated ( up to 1 @xmath1 ) upon substrate binding and an associated , mandatory , j - domain containing protein @xcite . upon contact , thus , hsp70 latches onto the substrate after rapid atp hydrolysis , entrapping it into the closed clamp ( fig .",
    "[ fig:4state ] ) .",
    "remarkably , the measured substrate affinity of the atp - bound , open conformation is only slightly lower than the substrate affinity of the closed adp - bound conformation ( @xmath2 , see table  [ 4state_realrate ] for experimental values ) .",
    "experiments , though , have shown that substrate binding occurs mainly in the atp state rather than adp state , despite the latter being the state characterized by the smallest dissociation constant @xcite .",
    "it had been proposed that this effect was inherently due to the non - equilibrium , atp - consuming , nature of hsp70s .",
    "recently , this enhanced affinity ( dubbed _ ultra - affinity _ ) was linked to the kinetic properties of the atp - bound and adp - bound states @xcite . the substrate binding and unbinding rates are faster for atp - bound hsp70s , because the sbd is open and easily accessible , than for adp - bound hsp70s , whose sbd is closed and thus difficult to bind to , but also difficult to unbind from ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:4state ] ) . due to an excess of atp in living cells and in the vast majority of experiments ,",
    "most free hsp70 molecules are bound to atp . as a consequence ,",
    "substrate binding occurs mostly in the atp - bound hsp70 , with the fastest binding rate @xmath3 .",
    "atp hydrolysis rapidly follows , with the closure of the sbd on the substrate .",
    "substrate unbinding takes place then with the smallest dissociation rate , @xmath4 .",

    "it can be smaller than the dissociation constant attainable without hydrolysis , which is the average of the dissociation constants of the two nucleotide - bound states , weighted by their respective populations .",
    "ultra - affinity is a remarkable principle , which allows hsp70s to bind very effectively to a broad , non - specific , array of amino - acid sequences .    a careful analysis of ultra - affinity ,",

    "our optimization showed that , firstly , hydrolysis must be much faster than nucleotide exchange in the substrate - bound state , whereas nucleotide exchange must be much faster than hydrolysis in the absence of a substrate . secondly",

    "infra - affinity can be useful for small gtpases to optimize signal transduction .",
