    "elucidating the collective dynamics of coupled genetic oscillators not only is important for the understanding of the rhythmic phenomena of living organisms , but also has many potential applications in bioengineering areas .",
    "so far , many researchers have studied the synchronization in genetic networks from the aspects of experiment , numerical simulation and theoretical analysis .",
    "for instance , in @xcite , the authors experimentally investigated the synchronization of cellular clock in the suprachiasmatic nucleus ( scn ) ; in @xcite , the synchronization are studied in biological networks of identical genetic oscillators ; and in @xcite , the synchronization for coupled nonidentical genetic oscillators is investigated .",
    "gene regulation is an intrinsically noisy process , which is subject to intracellular and extracellular noise perturbations and environment fluctuations @xcite .",
    "such cellular noises will undoubtedly affect the dynamics of the networks both quantitatively and qualitatively . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors numerically studied the cooperative behaviors of a multicell system with noise perturbations . but to our knowledge",
    ", the synchronization properties of stochastic genetic networks have not yet been theoretically studied .",
    "this paper aims to provide a theoretical result for the synchronization of coupled genetic oscillators with noise perturbations , based on control theory approach .",
    "we first provide a general theoretical result for the stochastic synchronization of coupled oscillators .",
    "after that , by taking the specific structure of many model genetic oscillators into account , we present a sufficient condition for the stochastic synchronization in terms of linear matrix inequalities ( lmis ) @xcite , which are very easy to be verified numerically . to our knowledge , the synchronization of complex oscillator networks with noise perturbations , even not in the biological context , has not yet been fully studied .",
    "recently , it was found that many biological networks are complex networks with small - world and scale - free properties @xcite .",
    "our method is also applicable to genetic oscillator networks with complex topology , directed and weighted couplings . to demonstrate the effectiveness of the theoretical results , we present a simulation example of coupled repressilators . throughout this paper , matrix @xmath0 is defined as an irreducible matrices with zero row sums , whose off - diagonal elements are all non - positive , and the other notations are defined in the appendix a.",
    "since we know very little about how the cellular noises act on the genetic networks , a simple way to incorporate random effects is to assume that certain noises randomly perturb the genetic networks in an additive manner .",
    "we consider the following networks of @xmath1 coupled genetic oscillators with random noise perturbations @xmath2 where @xmath3 defines the dynamics of individual oscillators , @xmath4 is called the noise intensity vector , belongs to @xmath5 .",
    "as we will see in the following analysis , the results hold no matter what @xmath6 is and no matter where it is introduced , so we do not explicitly express the form of @xmath6 here .",
    "@xmath6 can also be a function of the variables ( if so , some minor modifications are needed in the following ) .",
    "@xmath7 is a scalar zero mean gaussian white noise process .",
    "recall that the time derivative of a wiener process is a white noise process @xcite , hence we can define @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is a scalar wiener process .",
    "thus , the above equation can be rewritten as the following stochastic differential equation form : @xmath10dt + v_i(t)dw_i(t),\\,i=1,\\cdots , n.\\ ] ] the work can be easily extended to the case that @xmath11 and @xmath12^t$ ] be an @xmath13-dimensional mutually independent zero mean gaussian white noise process . @xmath14 defines the coupling between two genetic oscillators .",
    "@xmath15 is the coupling matrix of the network .",
    "if there is a link from oscillator @xmath16 to oscillator @xmath17 @xmath18 , then @xmath19 equals to a positive constant denoting the coupling strength of this link ; otherwise , @xmath20 ; @xmath21 .",
    "matrix @xmath22 defines the coupling topology , direction , and the coupling strength of the network .    for network ( 1 ) ,",
    "a natural attempt is to study the mean - square asymptotic synchronization .",
    "but existing experimental results show that usually the genetic oscillators can not achieve mean - square synchronization ( see , e.g. experimental results in [ 1 ] and appendix b for a theoretical discussion ) .",
    "analogue to the stochastic stability with disturbance attenuation ( see , e.g. @xcite ) , we give a less restrictive ( but more realistic ) definition of the stochastic synchronization as follows :    _ definition 1 _ : for a given scalar @xmath23 , the network ( 1 ) is said to be stochastically synchronous ( under the combination matrix @xmath24 ) with disturbance attenuation @xmath25 if the network without disturbance @xmath26 is asymptotically synchronous , and under the same initial conditions for all oscillators , @xmath27 for all nonzero @xmath6 , where @xmath28 . here , by introducing the combination matrix @xmath24 , we can flexibly select the form of the matrix to obtain different error combinations .    by using the techniques described in the appendix c",
    ", we know that if there exist matrices @xmath29 and @xmath24 , and a scalar @xmath30 , such that the following conditions are satisfied , @xmath31 + \\frac{\\rho}{\\gamma}(y_1-y_2)^t ( y_1-y_2)<0,\\ ,   \\forall y_1,y_2 \\in r^n\\ , ( y_1\\neq y_2),\\\\ ( u\\otimes p)(g\\otimes d+i\\otimes t)+(g\\otimes d+i\\otimes t)^t(u\\otimes p)\\leq 0,\\\\ u\\otimes p\\leq \\rho i , \\end{array}\\ ] ] then , the network ( 1 ) will achieve stochastic synchronization with disturbance attenuation @xmath25 .",
    "the above condition ( 3 ) is a general result for the stochastic synchronization of coupled oscillators .",
    "but we do not have general efficient method for verifying the first inequality in ( 3 ) for arbitrary @xmath32 due to its nonlinearity .",
    "next we consider a special structure of genetic oscillators to obtain an easy - verified result .",
    "genetic oscillators are biochemically dynamical networks , which can usually be modelled as nonlinear dynamical systems .",
    "mathematically many genetic oscillators can be expressed in the form of multiple additive terms , and the terms are monotonic functions of each variable , which particularly , are of linear , michaelis - menten and hill forms . in our previous papers @xcite ,",
    "we have taken such special structure properties of gene networks into account , and have shown that these genetic oscillators can be transformed into lure form and can be further analyzed by using lure system method in control theory @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we also consider such special structure . to make our paper more understandable and",
    "self - contained , we will first introduce the approach briefly , and after that we will analyze the stochastic genetic oscillator networks theoretically .",
    "we consider the following general form of genetic oscillator : @xmath33 where @xmath34 represents the concentrations of proteins , rnas and chemical complexes , @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 are matrices in @xmath38 , @xmath39^t$ ] with @xmath40 as a monotonic increasing function of the form @xmath41 $ ] , and @xmath42^t$ ] with @xmath43 as a monotonic decreasing function of the form @xmath44 $ ] , where @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the hill coefficients .",
    "genetic oscillators of the form ( 4 ) is by no mean peculiar .",
    "many well - known genetic system models can be represented in this form , such as the goodwin model @xcite , the repressilator @xcite , the toggle switch @xcite , and the circadian oscillators @xcite .",
    "undoubtedly , this work can be easily generalized to the case of @xmath47 , where there are more than two nonlinear terms in each equation of the genetic oscillator . from the synthetic biology viewpoint , genetic oscillators with only linear , michaelis - menten and hill terms",
    "can also be implemented experimentally .",
    "to avoid confusion , we let the @xmath16th column of @xmath48 be zeros if @xmath49 . since @xmath50 , and letting @xmath51 , we can rewrite ( 4 ) as follows : @xmath52 obviously , @xmath53 and @xmath54 satisfy the sector conditions : @xmath55 , or equivalently , @xmath56",
    "\\leq 0,\\\\ ( g_i(a)-g_i(b))[(g_i(a)-g_i(b))-k_{2i}(a - b ) ] \\leq 0,\\\\ \\forall a , b\\in r\\ , ( a\\neq b ) ; i=1,\\cdots , n , \\end{array}\\ ] ]    recall that a lure system is a linear dynamic system , feedback interconnected to a static nonlinearity that satisfies a sector condition @xcite .",
    "hence , the genetic oscillator ( 5 ) can be seen as a lure system , which can be investigated by using the fruitful lure system approach in control theory .    by substituting the individual genetic oscillator dynamics ( 5 ) for @xmath32 in the network ( 1 )",
    ", we obtain the following network of @xmath1 coupled genetic oscillators : @xmath57dt+v_i(t)dw_i(t),\\\\ & i=1,\\cdots , n .",
    "\\end{array}\\ ] ]    for this network , we have the following result :    _ proposition 1 _ : if there are matrices @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath24 as defined above , and a positive real constant @xmath62 such that the following matrix inequalities hold @xmath63<0,\\\\ ( ug\\otimes pd+u\\otimes q)^t+(ug\\otimes pd+u\\otimes q)\\leq 0,\\\\ u\\otimes p\\leq \\rho i , \\end{array}\\ ] ] where @xmath64 , @xmath65 . then the network ( 7 )",
    "is stochastic synchronization with disturbance attenuation @xmath25 .",
    "proposition 1 can be proved by replacing @xmath32 in @xmath66 of ( 3 ) by the dynamics of ( 5 ) , and using the sector conditions ( 6 ) .",
    "the details are given in appendix d. if we choose @xmath24 beforehand , the matrix inequalities in ( 8) are all lmis , which are very easy to be verified numerically @xcite . for some special @xmath22 and @xmath67 , we can further simplify the verification process @xcite .      to demonstrate the effectiveness of our theoretical results , we consider a population of @xmath1 coupled biological clocks , and the individual genetic oscillator is the repressilator @xcite .",
    "the repressilator is a network of three genes , the products of which inhibit the transcription of each other in a cyclic way ( 10 ) .",
    "specifically , the gene _",
    "_ expresses protein laci , which inhibits transcription of the gene _",
    "tetr_. the protein product tetr , inhibits transcription of the gene _ ci _ , the protein product ci of which in turn inhibits expression of _ laci _ , thus forming a negative feedback cycle .",
    "the quorum - sensing system is used for the coupling purpose , which was described in @xcite .",
    "the system achieves cell - to - cell communication through a mechanism that makes use of two proteins , the first one of which ( luxi ) , under the control of the repressilator protein laci , synthesizes a small molecule known as an autoinducer ( ai ) , which can diffuse freely through the cell membrane .",
    "when a second protein ( luxr ) binds to this molecule , the resulting complex activates the transcription _ laci _ , as shown in fig .",
    "the noise perturbations in the model can arise both intracellularly , due to the intrinsically noisy property of the gene regulation process , and extracellularly , due to environment fluctuations .        to model the system , we use @xmath68 and @xmath69 to represent the dimensionless concentrations of the genes _ tetr , ci , laci _ and their product proteins tetr , ci , laci , respectively . as in @xcite , assuming equal lifetimes of the tetr and luxi proteins , their dynamics are identical , and hence we can use the same variable to describe both protein concentrations .",
    "the concentration of ai inside the @xmath17th cell is denoted by @xmath70 .",
    "consequently , the mrna and protein dynamics in the @xmath17th cell can be described by @xcite : @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the hill coefficient , @xmath73 denotes the extracellular ai concentration , and the meaning of the other parameters are standard in genetic network models .",
    "we assume that the release of the ai is fast with respect to the timescale of the oscillators and becomes approximately homogeneous to establish an average ai level outside the cells . in the quasi - steady - state approximation",
    ", the extracellular ai concentration can be approximated by @xcite @xmath74 where @xmath75 is a constant .",
    "thus the dynamics of @xmath70 can be rewritten as @xmath76s_i+k_{s1 } a_i+\\frac{\\eta q_0}{n}\\sum_{j=1}^n(s_j - s_i)\\ ] ]    clearly , the individual model in ( 9 ) is of the form ( 5 ) , in which @xmath77^t$ ] , @xmath36 is a @xmath78 matrix with all zero entries except for @xmath79 , @xmath80^t$ ] , @xmath37 is a @xmath78 matrix with all zero entries except for @xmath81 , and all the other terms are in linear form .",
    "obviously , the coupling term can also be written into the form defined previously .",
    "the purpose of this example is to demonstrate the effectiveness and correctness of the theoretical result , instead of mimicking the real biological clock system .",
    "we consider a small size of network with @xmath82 coupled oscillators .",
    "the parameters are set as @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "since proposition 1 holds no matter what @xmath6 is and no matter where it is introduced , and the verification of proposition 1 is independent of noise intensity @xmath87 , for simplicity , we set @xmath88 as a scalar for all @xmath17 , and the noise term @xmath89 is added to the first equation in ( 9 ) , where @xmath7 is a scalar gaussian white noise process . according to proposition 1 ( by letting @xmath90 , and using matlab lmi toolbox ) , we know that the above all - to - all coupled network can achieve stochastic synchronization with disturbance attenuation @xmath91 . although @xmath25 is a large value , it is easy to show from ( 2 ) that the time average of * e*(@xmath92 ) is still rather small because @xmath93 is very small .",
    "we omit the computational details here . in fig .",
    "1 ( a ) & ( b ) , when starting from the same initial values , we plot the time evolution of the mrna concentrations of _ tetr _ ( @xmath94 ) of all the oscillators , which behaviors are similar to the experimental results ( see , e.g. @xcite ) . fig . 1 ( c ) shows the synchronization error of @xmath95 for @xmath96 .    ) of all the genetic oscillators .",

    "\\end{array}\\ ] ]    since in genetic networks , the variables usually represent the concentrations of mrnas , proteins and chemical complexes , which are of ( not so large ) limited values , and so is @xmath101 . for a long time scale ,",
    "the last term of the above inequality is usually much smaller than the absolute value of the first term in the right - hand side , and thus the last term can be ignored roughly . in fig .",
    "3 , we show the same computations as those in fig .",
    "2 except that the oscillators are with different initial values ( randomly in the range ( 0 , 1 ) ) . after a period of evolution ,",
    "the network behaviors are similar to those in fig .",
    "2 , which verifies our above argument . in other words ,",
    "rigorously , according to definition 1 , we need that all the oscillators have the same initial conditions , but practically , for oscillators with different initial conditions , we can obtain almost the same results .    for the purpose of comparison , in fig .",
    "4 we show the simulation results of a network without noise perturbations . as we can conclude from figs . 2 - 4",
    ", the networks with noise perturbation , though ca nt achieve perfect synchronization , can indeed achieve synchronization with small error fluctuation , and the network behaviors are similar to those of networks without noise perturbations .",
    "in addition to providing a sufficient condition for the stochastic synchronization , proposition 1 can also be used for designing genetic oscillator networks , which is a byproduct of the main results . from the synthetic biology viewpoint , to minimize the influence of the noises ( on the synchronization ) , we can design genetic oscillator networks according to the following rule : @xmath102 which is obviously from the above theoretical result .",
    "this is similar to the @xmath103 synthesis problem in control theory .",
    "in this paper , we presented a general theoretical method for analyzing the stochastic synchronization of coupled genetic oscillators based on systems biology approach . by taking the specific structure of genetic systems into account ,",
    "a sufficient condition for the stochastic synchronization was derived based on lmi formalism , which can be easily verified numerically .",
    "although the method and results are presented for genetic oscillator networks , it is also applicable to other dynamical systems . in coupled genetic oscillator networks , since there is a maximal activity of fully active promoters , it is more realistic to consider a michaelis - menten form of the coupling terms .",
    "as argued in @xcite , our theoretical method is also applicable to this case . to make the theoretical method more understandable and to avoid unnecessarily complicated notation , we discussed only on some simplified forms of the genetic oscillators , but more general cases regarding this topic can be studied in a similar way . for example : ( i ) the genetic oscillator model ( 5 ) can be generalized to more general case such that @xmath104 , the component of @xmath105 , are functions of @xmath106 , not only of @xmath107 , and @xmath108 and @xmath109 can also be of non - hill form , provided that @xmath110 , where @xmath111 are real vectors .",
    "( ii ) biologically , the genetic oscillators are usually nonidentical",
    ". we can consider genetic networks with both parametric mismatches and stochastic perturbations in similar ways as those presented in this paper and @xcite .",
    "( iii ) there are significant time delays in the gene regulation , due to the slow processes of transcription , translation and translocation .",
    "our result can be easily extended to the case that there are delays both in the coupling and the individual genetic oscillators .    as we know",
    ", noises can play both beneficial and harmful roles ( for synchronization ) in biological systems . for the latter case ,",
    "the noise is a kind of perturbation , and it is interesting to study the robustness of the synchronization with respect to noise . in this paper , we addressed this question . for the former case ,",
    "in @xcite , the authors studied the mechanisms of noise - induced synchronization .",
    "to simulate the stocahstic differential equaiton @xmath112 , the well - known euler - maruyama scheme is most frequently used , which is also used in this paper . in this scheme ,",
    "the numerical trajectory is generated by @xmath113 , where @xmath114 is the time step and @xmath115 is a discrete time gaussian white noise with @xmath116 and @xmath117 . for more details , see e.g. @xcite .",
