    "compressed sensing ( cs ) aims at recovering a signal from reduced number of linear measurements under a sparsity / compressibility condition .",
    "different from the conventional linear recovery approach , a nonlinear scheme is used in cs to solve the following basis pursuit ( bp ) problem @xmath1 where @xmath2 is a sparse signal to be recovered , @xmath3 is a sensing matrix and @xmath4 is a vector of sample data , with @xmath5 and @xmath6 being the signal length and sample size respectively and typically @xmath7 .    the theory of cs is mainly focused on studying how aggressively a sparse signal can be undersampled while still preserving all information for its recovery .",
    "the existing results include those based on incoherence@xcite , restricted isometry property ( rip)@xcite and phase transition theory@xcite . while the incoherence and rip are sufficient conditions for the sparse signal recovery and typically quite conservative in practice@xcite , the phase transition defined for @xmath8 is most precise owing to its necessary and sufficient condition for measuring the sparsity - undersampling tradeoff performance .",
    "for the real valued cs ( rvcs ) using the sensing matrix @xmath9 with i.i.d .",
    "random gaussian entries , the sparsity - undersampling tradeoff of the bp is controlled by the sampling ratio @xmath10 and sparsity ratio @xmath11 , where @xmath12 denotes the number of nonzero entries of @xmath13 . as a result , the plane of @xmath14 is divided by a phase transition curve into two phases , a ` success ' phase where bp successfully recovers the sparse signal and a ` failure ' phase where the original signal can not be recovered by solving bp , both with an overwhelming probability .    in rvcs ,",
    "three different approaches , combinatorial geometry @xcite , null space method @xcite and state evolution @xcite , to the phase transition of bp have provided identical results .",
    "numerical simulations have shown that the observed phase transition matches the theoretical curve even for modestly large @xmath5 , e.g. , @xmath15 @xcite , where the phase transition for finite-@xmath5 is defined as the value of @xmath16 at which the original signal is successfully recovered with the probability of @xmath17 .",
    "moreover , it is practically observed that the gaussian condition on @xmath9 can be considerably relaxed , resulting in the well known observed universality of phase transitions @xcite .    to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "the existing results on phase transition , before our preliminary work @xcite , only deal with the rvcs problem .",
    "this letter presents our first study of the phase transition in the more general complex domain where both the signal and sensing matrix are complex valued .",
    "its significance is twofold : 1 ) discovering a new phase transition for the complex valued cs ( cvcs ) so to inspire completeness of the phase transition theory ; 2 ) providing insight into performance of numerous cs applications involving complex data , e.g. , magnetic resonance imaging ( mri)@xcite , radar imaging@xcite and source localization@xcite .",
    "this letter shows that the recently developed orthonormal expansion @xmath0-minimization ( one - l1 ) algorithms @xcite can be extended to cvcs after some modifications .",
    "the algorithms can efficiently compute the optimal ( or numerically optimal ) solution of bp , so to provide an effective means for empirically exploring the phase transition of cvcs .",
    "it is observed that not only a transition curve exists in the phase plane of cvcs , but also it is well above that of rvcs .",
    "moreover , the universality of phase transitions across many different matrix ensembles also holds in cvcs .",
    "the sparsity of a complex signal implies joint sparsity of its real and imaginary parts with the same support .",
    "this connects to the block - sparse cs ( bscs ) problem which is to recover real valued signals with entries clustered into sparse blocks of equal size .",
    "the phase transition of the bscs is analyzed in @xcite by stojnic under the condition that the null space of the real valued random sensing matrix is distributed uniformly in the grassmanian .",
    "it is shown in this letter that the phase transition of the cvcs coincides with that of the bscs with the block size @xmath18 .",
    "analysis is further carried out to show that the phase transition of the cvcs is not a special case of that of the bscs because the cvcs does not meet the aforementioned uniformly distributed null space condition .",
    "section [ section_one_l1 ] retrospects the main points in @xcite on one - l1 algorithms and extends the algorithms to the cvcs .",
    "section [ section_pt_complex ] applies the extended one - l1 algorithms to explore the phase transition of cvcs and its connection to the bscs .",
    "conclusion is drawn in section [ section_conclusion ] .",
    "the one - l1 algorithms @xcite solve the bp in rvcs where @xmath13 , @xmath9 and @xmath19 are all real valued .",
    "assume that the sensing matrix @xmath9 is partially orthonormal , i.e. , @xmath20 with @xmath21 denoting the transpose and @xmath22 being an identity matrix , and let @xmath23 be an operator projecting the vector @xmath24 onto its first @xmath6 entries .",
    "the orthonormal expansion technique is to introduce an expanded orthonormal matrix @xmath25 to reformulate the bp into @xmath26 where the first @xmath6 rows of @xmath25 compose @xmath9 and the rest orthonormal @xmath27 rows are arbitrary .",
    "the augmented lagrange multiplier ( alm ) method is applied in @xcite to @xmath28 and the obtained result leads to an exact one - l1 ( eone - l1 ) algorithm for iterative computation of the optimal solution . while eone - l1 has an inner iteration loop embedded in the outer loop iteration , its relaxed version , rone - l1 , further speeds up the computation by simplifying the inner loop iteration into a single update .",
    "the rone - l1 algorithm is numerically optimal in terms of the sparsity - undersampling tradeoff under reasonable parameter settings , i.e. , its phase transition result matches that of bp .",
    "it has been shown that rone - l1 is of iterative thresholding type and is very fast , with appropriate settings of the regulation variable , in comparison with other state - of - the - art algorithms .",
    "an important operation in the one - l1 algorithms is the soft thresholding defined as @xmath29 for @xmath30 , where @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 in fact , @xmath34 operates elementwisely on a real valued vector @xmath35 .",
    "it has been well known that the soft thresholding solves the following @xmath0 regularized least squares problem for real valued vectors @xmath36 of the same dimension .    to extend the one - l1 algorithms to cvcs , the complex sensing matrix @xmath3",
    "is also assumed to satisfy @xmath20 with @xmath21 denoting the conjugate transpose . the soft thresholding operator @xmath34 , for a complex vector @xmath35 , is defined as in the real case .",
    "it is also the optimal solution to ( [ formula_soft_threshold ] ) for complex valued vectors @xmath36 .",
    "let @xmath37 and @xmath38 be operators taking , respectively , the real and imaginary parts of a variable .",
    "the augmented lagrangian function in @xcite is modified , for the cvcs , as where @xmath39 is the lagrange multiplier vector , @xmath40 and @xmath41 is the inner product of @xmath42 .",
    "the modified augmented lagrangian function allows a straightforward extension of the derivation and optimization steps in @xcite to the complex bp problem , yielding the optimal solution in the same form as that of the real valued bp . as a result",
    ", the one - l1 algorithms can be directly applicable to the cvcs problem .",
    "readers are referred to @xcite for detailed algorithm steps and the optimality and convergence analysis .",
    "section [ section_one_l1 ] has shown that the one - l1 algorithms can be extended and applicable to the cvcs problem .",
    "the eone - l1 achieves the optimal solution of bp and rone - l1 is numerically optimal and exponentially converges , which are applied in this subsection to empirically explore the sparsity - undersampling tradeoff of bp .",

    "the success of recovering the original signal is stated if the relative root mean squared error ( rrmse ) @xmath48 , where @xmath49 and @xmath50 are the original and recovered signals , respectively .",
    "meanwhile , the failure in solving bp using one - l1 is stated if @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "inspired by the estimation of the real phase transition in @xcite , we first set a complex matrix ensemble , e.g. , gaussian , and dimension @xmath5 .",
    "a grid of @xmath14 is generated in the plane @xmath53 with equispaced @xmath54 and @xmath55 with respect to @xmath56 , where @xmath57 denotes the theoretical real phase transition as shown in fig .",

    "after data acquisition , a generalized linear modal ( glm ) with a logistic link is used to estimate the phase transition .",
    "we now explore the sparsity - undersampling tradeoff of bp with partial - fourier sampling .",
    "four values of signal length @xmath5 are considered , including 1024 , 2048 , 4096 and 8192 . when @xmath62 , both eone - l1 and rone - l1 are used to estimate the phase transition of bp .",
    "the rone - l1 algorithm is used for other @xmath5 .",
    "few failures in solving the bp occur when using rone - l1",
    "[ fig_pt_fourier ] presents the estimated phase transitions of partial - fourier sampling .",
    "the five observed phase transitions of bp , estimated respectively by eone - l1 with @xmath62 and rone - l1 with @xmath62 , 2048 , 4096 and 8192 , coincide with each other and are higher than the real phase transition of bp .",
    "our earlier observation of the successful signal recovery rate reported in @xcite also showed that a larger @xmath5 results in sharper phase transition .",

    "the complex phase transition of bp is higher than the real phase transition with a considerably enlarged success phase .",
    "[ find_superiority ]      the observed universality of phase transitions of bp in the real case has been discussed in @xcite and the same result is stated in @xcite . in this subsection , we examine whether the same property holds in the complex case .",

    "the blocked signal of @xmath76 is @xmath12-block - sparse with at most @xmath12 nonzero block entries and its @xmath78-norm as defined in @xcite is equivalent to the @xmath0 norm of @xmath13 in the cvcs .",
    "thus the cvcs problem is strongly connected to the bscs problem via the real valued reformation @xmath70 .",
    "their only difference is that @xmath77 is subject to a structured constraint whereas entries of the sensing matrix of the bscs problem are independent in general .",

    "it is known that the real gaussian matrix ensemble satisfies such a condition @xcite .",
    "we now provide an analysis in the following proposition to show that such a condition is not satisfied in the cvcs problem .",

    ", @xmath80 is not distributed uniformly in the grassmanian .",
    "proposition [ cor : nullspace ] shows that the existing phase transition theory of bscs can not explain our obtained empirical phase transition of the cvcs .",
    "intuitively , the coincidence of the phase transition of cvcs with that of bscs may be interpreted as the universality of phase transitions of bscs across different matrix ensembles .",
    "[ fig_pt_block2 ] also shows that the observed phase transition by minimizing @xmath79 , subject to @xmath69 and without taking into account the block - sparsity , matches the real phase transition of bp .",
    "it further explains that the higher successful rate of cvcs is obtained by incorporating the block - sparsity factor into its problem solving .    in the above",
    ", it has been shown that the cvcs problem is connected to bscs with a special structure of the sensing matrix @xmath77 .",
    "it is interesting to consider that the sensing matrix in cvcs is further specialized into a block - diagonal matrix , i.e. , @xmath87 in @xmath77 or , equivalently , @xmath88 .",
    "such a case refers to the jointly sparse cs or the case of multiple measurement vectors ( mmv ) . in comparison with the standard real cs or the case of single measurement vector ( smv ) , the recovery performance can be improved in the mmv case under some assumptions on the distribution of entries of @xmath13@xcite . on the other hand",
    ", the analysis of the null space property in @xcite shows that there is little performance improvement in the worst case of signal recovery , such as an @xmath13 with identical real and imaginary parts .",

    "in this letter , the sparsity - undersampling tradeoff of bp for the cvcs problem is empirically explored in terms of the phase transition .",
    "it is found that the same properties exist as those in the rvcs case , such as the existence of the phase transition and observed universality across different matrix ensembles .",
