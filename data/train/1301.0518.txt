    "the ads / cft duality is a powerful tool for studying strongly coupled gauge theories  @xcite .",
    "this duality has been tested in numerous examples in a string-/m - theory framework and applied to various physical models .",
    "in particular , there is accumulating evidence that the ads / cft duality can be used to study physics in the strongly coupled regime in condensed matter systems  @xcite .",
    "an important example of the ads / cft duality related to a low - energy effective action of @xmath5 coincident m2-branes on the @xmath11 orbifold fixed point was proposed in ref .",
    "this effective theory is called aharony - bergman - jafferis - maldacena ( abjm ) theory and was conjectured to be dual to type iia string theory on @xmath12 or m - theory on @xmath13 , according to the value of the chern - simons ( cs ) level @xmath14 .",
    "since the boundary of the ads@xmath15 space is conformally mapped to the flat @xmath16-dimensional minkowski space , the dual field theories are closely related to the strongly coupled theories of planar condensed matter systems .",
    "the direct application of abjm theory to specific condensed matter systems seems far from possible , due to its complicated non - abelian structure and huge number of degrees of freedom .    in order to make more realistic attempt ,",
    "a consistent abelian truncation of the bosonic part of the @xmath1 mass - deformed abjm ( mabjm ) theory  @xcite is probably a promising direction  @xcite . in the construction of an abelian theory ,",
    "an ansatz is used in terms of some constant matrices , called the gomis - rodriguez - gomez - van raamsdonk - verlinde ( grvv ) matrices  @xcite .",
    "these matrices were originally introduced to obtain discrete vacua of the mabjm theory .",
    "the abelian truncation in ref.@xcite preserves @xmath17 degrees of freedom out of @xmath18 degrees of freedom of the mabjm theory in which these abelian fields may describe the collective motions of @xmath17 charged particles .",
    "it was also proposed that the abelian action governing the collective motions can be an effective action of a condensed matter system .",
    "specifically , the relativistic landau - ginzburg model was constructed from the abelian projected model .",
    "these results suggest that the dual gravity theories of condensed matter systems can be studied based on the gauge / gravity duality of the mabjm theory .    in this paper , we employ a generalized ansatz that includes the fermion part of the mabjm theory to construct a supersymmetric abelian projected theory .",
    "first , we show that the resulting theory has @xmath3 supersymmetry .",
    "the abelian theory obtained in ref.@xcite is a special representative of our construction .",
    "the backgrounds used in the @xmath3 abelian theories are not supersymmetric vacua of the mabjm theory . as a consequence , there are some problems in finding the gravity dual . in order to overcome these problems we propose a new ansatz based on the vacua of the mabjm theory , and construct an @xmath2 abelian cs theory .",
    "half - bogomolnyi - prasad - sommerfeld ( bps ) geometries for m2-branes in the presence of the transverse 4-form flux in 11-dimensional supergravity are called the lin - lunin - maldacena ( llm ) geometries  @xcite .",
    "these llm geometries were expected to be dual to the vacua of the mabjm theory with cs level @xmath19 .",
    "however , the number of classical vacua constructed in ref .",
    "@xcite was more numerous than the partitions of @xmath5 , which is the number of the half - bps llm solutions for a given number @xmath5 of m2-branes .",
    "this mismatch was fixed by excluding the vacua in which the supersymmetry is broken dynamically  @xcite .",
    "the one - to - one mapping between the vacua in the mabjm ( or mabj  @xcite ) theory with cs level @xmath14 and the llm geometries with a @xmath4 orbifold and discrete torsions is explained in ref",
    "( see also refs . @xcite . )    when we consider a gravity dual for a fluctuation on the field theory side , the corresponding background geometry should be weakly curved everywhere in the large-@xmath5 limit .",
    "however , we will show that in general the llm geometries involve highly curved regions even in the large-@xmath5 limit .",
    "therefore , the gravity duals for some fluctuations are not well - defined .    in this paper",
    ", we select one special vacuum of the mabjm theory and confirm that the corresponding dual llm geometry is weakly curved everywhere in the large-@xmath5 limit . to avoid complication , we focus on the case of @xmath19 . based on the work of ref .",
    "@xcite , one can also extend the discussion to the case of @xmath20 .",
    "for the llm geometry , we compute the ricci scalar at every point of the entire space transverse to the m2-branes and show that the ricci scalar has positive values near the boundaries between the black and white strips in the droplet representation of the llm geometry .",
    "furthermore , the ricci scalar decreases monotonically with increasing distance from the boundary and becomes a negative constant asymptotically . in this asymptotic region",
    "the geometry is ads@xmath21s@xmath22 . over the entire geometry ,",
    "the absolute value of the ricci scalar decreases with increasing @xmath5 .",
    "some fluctuations of a field theory vacuum with a weakly curved dual geometry , may lead to well - defined dual gravity modes , according to the gauge / gravity duality .",
    "for this reason , our @xmath2 abelian theory can be considered as a special kind of fluctuation on the vacuum and has a well - defined gravity dual on the corresponding llm geometry . since we consider the duality on the background of m2-branes polarized to m5-branes in the presence of the 4-form field strength  @xcite , the gauge / gravity which we are considering does not belong to the well - known ads / cft duality .",
    "rather , it is similar to the duality on the background of d3-branes polarized to d5(or ns5)-branes in type iib string theory  @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "2 we summarize the mabjm theory with explicit su(2)@xmath23su(2)@xmath23u(1 ) global symmetry and discuss the supersymmetric vacua of the theory . in sec .",
    "3 we construct the @xmath3 supersymmetric abelian projection of the mabjm theory with general anstze in terms of the grvv matrices and discuss its problems in relation to the gravity dual .",
    "we also construct the @xmath2 abelian theory based on the vacua of the mabjm theory . in sec .",
    "4 we select one special vacuum in the mabjm theory and investigate the corresponding dual llm geometry .",
    "we conclude in sec .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to construct an @xmath2 abelian projected mabjm theory and to propose a weakly curved gravity dual in the large-@xmath5 limit . for completeness , we start with an explanation of the mabjm theory in terms of the fields with manifest su(2)@xmath23su(2)@xmath23u(1 ) global symmetry , and a summary of the supersymmetric vacua of the theory .          in this subsection , we summarize the classical supersymmetric vacuum solutions of the mabjm theory , which were obtained in ref .",
    "the vacuum equations are obtained by setting the bosonic potential to zero , @xmath39 , in eq . .",
    "since @xmath40 is a sum of four absolute squares , we have four equations that are cubic for @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "the first two are the @xmath25-term equations , while the last two are the @xmath26-term equations .",
    "suppose that the scalar fields are chosen to be orthogonal to each other , @xmath43",
    ". then the vacuum equations are simplified by imposing this condition .",
    "the @xmath25-term equations become @xmath44 and the @xmath26-term equations are trivially satisfied as @xmath45    the classical vacuum solutions of the @xmath25-term equations have been found in the form of the grvv matrices . a convenient way of expressing each solution is to represent it as a direct sum of two types of irreducible rectangular @xmath46 matrices , @xmath47 , or a direct sum of the hermitian conjugates of those rectangular matrices @xmath48  @xcite , which are @xmath49 where @xmath50 . in order to form @xmath51 matrices , the direct sums of rectangular @xmath46 matrices should also include certain numbers of empty rows and empty columns . explicitly , the solutions are written as follows mass - deformed cs matter theory with generalized cs levels @xmath52 and @xmath53 were obtained in ref .",
    "] : @xmath54 @xmath55 the matrices @xmath56 are called the @xmath57th block of the first type , while their hermitian conjugates @xmath48 are called the @xmath57th block of the second type .",
    "since the nonzero components of @xmath58 and @xmath59 belong to different blocks , the product @xmath60 always vanishes and the @xmath26-term vacuum equations are automatically satisfied .",
    "the solutions in eq . also satisfy the @xmath25-term equations because the rectangular blocks @xmath56 solve the equations block by block as follows : @xmath61    one occupation number , @xmath62 with @xmath63 , denotes the number of blocks of @xmath56 contained in @xmath58 , and another occupation number , @xmath64 , denotes the number of blocks of @xmath48 contained in @xmath59 . in this notation @xmath65",
    "is the number of empty columns while @xmath66 is the number of empty rows .",
    "since @xmath58 and @xmath59 are @xmath51 matrices , the occupation numbers should satisfy the following constraints : @xmath67=n,\\qquad \\sum_{n=0}^{n-1}\\big[(n+1)n_n+nn_n'\\big]=n.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] at the quantum level , only a subset of these classical vacuum solutions remains supersymmetric , and the occupation numbers for the quantum - level supersymmetric vacua are further constrained by the value of the cs level @xmath14 as @xmath68 for every @xmath57  @xcite .",
    "the abelian projection of the mabjm theory is implemented by making an ansatz for the dynamical fields .",
    "they are given by two @xmath51 matrices , @xmath69 and @xmath70 , and are expressed by direct sums of the rectangular blocks , @xmath71 and @xmath72 , respectively . since all @xmath56 s are @xmath46 matrices , their direct sum always forms a rectangular matrix with fewer rows than columns .",
    "therefore , in order to form the @xmath51 matrices , the direct sums should contain a certain number of empty rows . in a general ansatz a certain number of empty columns is also allowed .",
    "more precisely , if @xmath62 is the number of @xmath56 blocks contained in @xmath73 , @xmath66 empty rows should be included in order to form the @xmath51 matrices .",
    "it is also possible to include @xmath65 empty columns .",
    "then the occupation numbers must satisfy the following constraints : @xmath74 the @xmath73 matrices of @xmath75 or @xmath76 constructed in this manner satisfy the following properties : @xmath77        the supersymmetry enhancement for @xmath92 in the ( m)abjm theory is realized by using the monopole operators  @xcite , which relate the bifundamental fields and the antibifundamental fields .",
    "the grvv matrices @xmath73 and @xmath93 in the ansatz , which represent the bifundamental and antibifundamental representations , respectively , are independent of each other . for this reason ,",
    "the monopole operators related to the supersymmetry enhancement do not exist in abelian projected theories .",
    "therefore , no supersymmetry enhancement is expected in these abelian theories . in general , however , monopole operators  @xcite in three - dimensional gauge theories create a u(1 ) magnetic flux in the gauge group under consideration .",
    "the abelian projection can be considered as a special way to extract the u(1 ) sector in which monopole operators can live .",
    "therefore , monopole operators that are not related to the supersymmetry enhancement can exist in the abelian projected theories .",
    "the next point to clarify is that the abelian projection is a consistent truncation of the original mabjm theory . in ref .",
    "@xcite this was argued in the sense that the solutions to the equations of motion of the truncated theory are also solutions to the original theory .",
    "this is indeed the case , because by using the properties of the @xmath73 matrices in eq .",
    "one can easily verify that @xmath94 .",
    "using the same set of properties , other expressions in the equations of motion of the mabjm theory involving products of more than two @xmath73 matrices can be reduced to expressions involving only one matrix . as a result of these simplifications",
    "the equations of motion of the original mabjm theory can be reduced to the equations of motion of the abelian projected theory using the ansatz .    as a matter of fact",
    ", the above criteria of a consistent truncation allows a further truncation of the abelian theory to a simpler abelian theory involving fewer scalar fields .",
    "in particular , a truncation involving two scalar fields can be obtained by setting any two of the four scalar fields and the corresponding fermionic fields to zero .",
    "there are three inequivalent such truncations : ( i ) @xmath95 , ( ii ) @xmath96 , and ( iii ) @xmath97 .",
    "other cases are related to these three cases by field renaming  @xcite .    in case ( i )",
    "the truncated action is @xmath98,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath99 are the field strengths of the abelian gauge fields .",
    "the gauge field @xmath100 is an auxiliary field and its equation of motion is @xmath101 , which means @xmath102 is a pure gauge degree of freedom .",
    "therefore , the truncation results in a theory of two massive bosonic and two massive fermionic fields without self - interactions of the scalar fields and yukawa - type interactions .",
    "this theory is invariant under the @xmath3 supersymmetry transformation .    in case ( ii )",
    "the truncated action is @xmath103{\\nonumber}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] only @xmath2 supersymmetry remains , with the supersymmetry transformation rules @xmath104 the bosonic potential in eq . has no higgs vacuum , and as such nontopological vortex - type bps solutions are supported @xcite .",
    "case ( iii ) is the most interesting because of its relevance in describing some condensed matter models  @xcite .",
    "the truncated action is @xmath105.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this action is also invariant under the @xmath2 supersymmetry transformation using the transformation rules obtained from eq . by setting the supersymmetry parameter @xmath106 to zero .",
    "anstze of abelian projections similar to eq .",
    "were commonly used in the literature to implement the abelian projection of the abjm theory  @xcite . however , as it was pointed out in the pervious subsection , these anstze do not satisfy the vacuum equations of the mabjm theory unless we set @xmath107 or @xmath108 to zero . if the latter is not the case , the anstze can not be considered as fluctuations on the supersymmetric vacua of the mabjm theory .",
    "then the identification of the gravity dual is unclear , since there is no known geometry which is dual to the configurations given by eq . .",
    "due to this reason , for the @xmath3 abelian gauge theories , we can not use the holographic duality relations between the supersymmetric vacua of the mabjm theory and the llm geometries .",
    "one has to find some other ways to identify the gravity dual of the @xmath3 abelian gauge theories .",
    "when @xmath107 or @xmath108 are set to zero , one can identify the dual gravity solutions : however , there are still some obstacles involved with these solutions",
    ". we discuss these obstacles in this subsection , and we construct an @xmath2 abelian projection based on the vacua of the mabjm theory in the next subsection .",
    "let us consider a particular vacuum solution with occupation numbers @xmath109 satisfying the supersymmetric condition . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the @xmath110 quotient of the llm geometry  @xcite is identified as the holographic dual of the vacua of the mabjm theory .",
    "this geometry is represented in terms of an infinite strip of white and black regions in fig .  1 , which are called droplets .",
    "in this representation the two colors correspond to @xmath111 boundary values of the function that characterizes the metric ; however , we leave its clarification until sec .",
    "the strip is divided into excitation levels of length @xmath14 , which are labeled by non - negative integers @xmath112 starting at the fermi level ( @xmath113 ) . in this strip representation",
    ", the occupation number @xmath62 corresponds to the length of the black region in the @xmath57th level above the fermi level , while @xmath64 corresponds to that of the white region in the @xmath57th level below the fermi level .",
    "since the length of the black / white strip in a given level can not be bigger than the length of the level itself , the occupation numbers should satisfy the condition , which is also required in order to have supersymmetric vacua @xcite .",
    "an alternative representation of those gravity solutions is expressed in terms of a young diagram .",
    "for the llm geometry corresponding to the @xmath19 case , the lengths of the white / black strips are equal to those of the horizontal / vertical edges of the young diagram , as shown in figs .",
    "1(b ) and ( c ) .",
    "the young diagrams for small - curvature solutions should all have very long edges and a very large total number of boxes  @xcite . in other words , a small - curvature geometry is represented by a young diagram whose shape is a square or almost a square . if the young diagram has a large number of corners , it is most likely that some of the edges are short and the geometry includes highly curved regions . in sec .",
    "4 we will discuss the structure of llm geometry and its various limits .    based on the discussion in the above two paragraphs , we notice that there are two obstacles with the dual gravity solutions to the abelian projection ansatz in eq . with @xmath107 or @xmath108",
    "set to zero .",
    "the first one is the fact that since the ansatz is based on matrices that are built from only @xmath46 rectangular blocks , we have to add @xmath66 empty rows , where @xmath66 is equal to the total number of rectangular blocks used . unless @xmath57 is of the order of @xmath5 , one has to use a large number of blocks to form an @xmath51 matrix , and as a result @xmath66 can be larger than @xmath14 , in contrast to the requirement from supersymmetric vacuum solutions .",
    "the second obstacle is related to the cases when the rectangular building blocks have sizes of the order of @xmath5 , so that only higher - level occupation numbers ( such as @xmath114 ) are nonzero . since the @xmath51 matrices representing the vacuum solutions can not contain more than one @xmath115 or @xmath116 , these nonvanishing occupation numbers are also of the order of one unit",
    "therefore , in the droplet representation , the length of either the black strip or the white strip is of the order of one unit . in these cases , the corresponding young diagrams will have some edges that have lengths of the order @xmath5 and others with lengths of the order of one unit .",
    "for instance , in the case of ref .",
    "@xcite , the young diagram is a @xmath117 rectangle .",
    "as pointed out before , for a young diagram with short edges , the dual geometry includes highly curved regions and the gravity approximation of the fluctuations on such a geometry can not be trusted .",
    "however , one can still consider the identification of the solitonic objects in the dual gravity for the young diagram with a @xmath117 rectangle  @xcite .    the prime motivation for considering the abelian truncation of the mabjm theory in ref .",
    "@xcite is to achieve a better understanding of the gauge / gravity duality in condensed matter systems .",
    "the authors obtained the abelian higgs theory ",
    "the relativistic version of landau - ginzburg theory  through the abelian projection of the mabjm theory .",
    "it was suggested that the strong - coupling regime of this theory can be investigated by using the gauge / gravity duality , though this point was not explicitly addressed .",
    "however , due to the two obstacles discussed in the pervious paragraph , it seems that the abelian projection ansatz is not suitable for the consideration of a weakly curved gravity dual .",
    "since the weakly curved limit is the only region where one can trust the gravity approximation of the dual theory , it is not clear if it is practically possible to implement the idea of the gauge / gravity duality for condensed matter models obtained from the @xmath3 abelian theory of sec .",
    "[ n=4abelian ] . in the next subsection",
    ", we will introduce an alternative truncation ansatz to circumvent these obstacles .      in this subsection",
    ", we consider an abelian projection of the mabjm theory where the ansatz for the dynamical fields is made in terms of four matrices , @xmath73 and @xmath118 .",
    "the ansatz is identified by the occupation numbers @xmath109 , where @xmath62 is the number of blocks @xmath56 contained in @xmath73 , and @xmath64 is the number of blocks @xmath119 contained in @xmath118 .",
    "the blocks @xmath56 and @xmath119 must be fitted as in eq .",
    "so that the products of @xmath73 with @xmath120 are zero and the occupation numbers satisfy eq . .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath121 the occupation numbers should also satisfy the supersymmetric vacuum condition .",
    "as they appear here , abelian projected theories obtained with different choices of the occupation numbers are the same except for the difference in the overall factor @xmath129 or @xmath130 . on the other hand , as was discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite , different supersymmetric vacua obtained by different choices of the occupation numbers are related to different dual gravity backgrounds .",
    "this fact suggests that the overall factors in the abelian projected theories have a more important physical meaning than it at first appears .",
    "below , we will consider a special choice of the occupation numbers and discuss the physical meanings of this choice in relation to the background geometry of the gravity dual .",
    "the application of the abelian projection ansatz to the supersymmetry transformation rules in eq .",
    "preserves only @xmath2 supersymmetry .",
    "the resulting supersymmetry transformation rules are @xmath131 unlike the @xmath3 abelian theory , in the current case the set of fields @xmath132 do not mix with the other set @xmath133 , and the parts of the lagrangian that depend on the first and second sets are separately invariant under the @xmath2 supersymmetry transformation . a model similar to eq .",
    "was considered in ref .",
    "@xcite to describe the phase transitions of quantum antiferromagnets in two spatial dimensions . identifying the set of fields ( @xmath134 with the second set @xmath135",

    "the merits of the @xmath2 abelian theory discussed in this subsection over the @xmath3 abelian theory of sec .",
    "[ n=4abelian ] are twofold .",
    "first , the abelian projection ansatz in eq . is a fluctuation on a supersymmetric vacuum , and it is natural to expect to find the gravity dual .",
    "this is true because for a particular supersymmetric vacuum specified by a set of occupation numbers , @xmath136 , the dual gravity solution is identified as the @xmath110 quotient of the llm geometry represented by a droplet with the same occupation numbers @xcite [ see fig .",
    "the @xmath2 ableian theory is then expected to be dual to a gravity theory on such a background .",
    "second  unlike the case of the @xmath3 theory  now the projection ansatz is based on both the @xmath46 and the @xmath137 matrices .",
    "therefore we can adjust the number of each of these block matrices in such a way that they are not large enough to violate the upper bound set by @xmath14 . in sec . 4",
    ", we will discuss one particular example to clarify this point .",
    "in ref . @xcite ,",
    "polchinski and strassler discussed the duality relation between the @xmath138 theory  a mass - deformed theory of the @xmath3 super yang - mills theory  and the type iib string theory ( or iib supergravity ) in the presence of a self dual 5-form flux .",
    "the duality includes quantitative maps for perturbative fluctuations and nonperturbative solitonic objects .    like the vacua of mabjm theory , the vacua of @xmath138 theory are discrete due to the mass deformation  @xcite .",
    "this implies that the duality relation of the @xmath138 theory can be compared with that of the mabjm theory . as we mentioned previously in sec .",

    "though this duality relation has not yet been confirmed , the correspondence between the spectrum of bps charged particles and the energy of the fractional m2-branes in the llm geometries was obtained in a reliable region  @xcite .    in the previous section",
    ", we constructed the @xmath2 abelian theory on the supersymmetric vacua of the mabjm theory , which is a consistent subset of the mabjm theory .",
    "according to the argument stated in the above paragraph , one can consider the duality relation for the @xmath2 abelian theory as some subset in the m - theory on the llm geometries .",
    "one can consider the correspondence for perturbed fluctuations or nonperturbed solitonic objects on both sides .",
    "in general , the llm geometries include highly curved regions , even in the large-@xmath5 m2-branes limit .",
    "gravity theories built on such background geometries should include higher - derivative corrections .",

    "therefore , for any droplet with @xmath5 m2-branes  including our special choice  the asymptotic geometry is ads@xmath211 and it is weakly curved in the large-@xmath5 limit , as expected .",
    "this completes the verification of the fact that in the case of our symmetric choice the llm geometry is weakly curved everywhere in the large-@xmath5 limit .",
    "in this paper we have constructed @xmath0 supersymmetric abelian projections of the mabjm theory .",
    "we selected an @xmath2 supersymmetric abelian theory on a particular vacuum of the mabjm theory and verified that the background geometry of its gravity dual is weakly curved everywhere .",
    "our work was motivated by a potential application of the abelian projected mabjm theory to describe some condensed matter systems .",
    "if an effective action of a condensed matter system is formulated as a truncation of well - established theory with a well - understood dual gravity , the strong - coupling regime of the system can be studied via gauge / gravity duality . in order for this",
    "to be realized , the background geometry of the gravity dual must be weakly curved .",
    "our first attempt in identifying such a theory was based on a consistent truncation of the mabjm theory with @xmath3 supersymmetry .",
    "we found such a truncation problematic because of either of the following two reasons .",
    "first , some of the truncation anstze violate the conditions required by the supersymmetry invariance of the vacua at the quantum level . since the gauge / gravity duality maps the supersymmetric vacuum solutions of the mabjm theory to the @xmath4 quotient of llm geometry , the map is unclear for the abelian theories built on nonsupersymmetric vacua .",
    "second , when the truncation anstze do not violate the condition required by quantum supersymmetric vacua , we found that the dual geometry has highly curved regions , and the gravity approximation of the fluctuations on such a geometry can not be trusted .    in order to overcome these problems , we constructed an @xmath2 abelian theory by using another consistent truncation of the mabjm theory .",
    "our truncation anstze involved special fluctuations on the supersymmetric vacua of the mabjm theory , and the gravity duals can be built as fluctuations on the geometries that are dual to these supersymmetric vacua .",
    "it turns out that some of the dual geometries contain highly curved regions and the study of gravity theories on those geometries should include higher - derivative corrections . for this reason , focusing on the @xmath19 case , we selected a particular vacuum for which the dual llm geometry is weakly curved everywhere .",
    "we carried out a detailed study of this geometry .",
    "our assessment can be repeated for a more general llm geometry , but in this paper we focused on the geometries for which the droplet representation has only a single pair of finite - length black and white strips .",
    "the metric is characterized by three parameters , which are the mass parameter , the lengths of the black / white strips , and the total number of m2-branes ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "we found that the geometry is weakly curved when the lengths of the black and white strips are the same and equal to @xmath202 in the large-@xmath5 limit . to verify this",
    ", we studied the behavior of the metric by splitting the transverse space into three intervals depending on the distance @xmath165 from the boundary between the black and white strips . for the near - boundary region ( @xmath166 ) and the asymptotic region ( @xmath168 ) ,",
    "we showed analytically that the absolute value of the ricci scalar is small and decreases with increasing @xmath5 .",
    "we found that the ricci scalar is always positive near the boundary whereas it is negative in the asymptotic region , in agreement with the expectation that the geometry is ads@xmath212 in the latter region . in the intermediate region ( @xmath167 ) , we could study the geometry only numerically . by plotting the graphs of the ricci scalar versus the transverse space coordinates , we verified that in the intermediate regions the geometry is weakly curved as well , and the curvature decreases with increasing @xmath5 .    in this paper",
    "we clarified the map between the vacuum of a special @xmath2 abelian projected mabjm theory and the llm background geometry of the gravity dual .",
    "it still remains to figure out the type of fluctuations on this geometry that result in the gravity theory dual to the @xmath2 abelian theory .",
    "there are also other interesting aspects of the map .",
    "it is evident that the @xmath2 abelian theory supports soliton solutions , such as vortices and domain walls .",
    "it is interesting to find the corresponding objects in the gravity dual .",
    "one can also consider more general fluctuations on our special vacuum and study the gravity dual .",
