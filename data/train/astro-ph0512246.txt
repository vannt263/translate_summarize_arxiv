    "gas flows at ( ultra)relativistic speeds are an integral component of many astrophysical phenomena . some significant examples of these include accretion disks around compact objects , gamma ray bursts , collapse of ( super)massive stars , pulsar wind nebula / supernova remnant interactions , active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , x - ray binaries , superluminal jets and many others .",
    "as it stands , there is a massive amount of astronomical data from many of these sources that to date , have only been partially understood and which hold clues to many problems related to the phenomena mentioned above .",
    "correlating these data with the theory in many of these phenomena would require doing simulations that would include modelling ( ultra)relativistic gas / fluid flows .",
    "such flows are described by non - linear hyperbolic conservation laws that have shock waves as possible solutions .",
    "shock waves are difficult to approximate numerically using standard finite difference techniques as they usually lead to spurious oscillations . high resolution shock capturing ( hrsc )",
    "schemes are a class of numerical methods devoted specifically to approximating hyperbolic conservation laws . over the past fifteen years hrsc research",
    "have progressed immensely and they have been applied to a wide variety of problems involving classical and relativistic hydrodynamics . for a pedagogical introduction to some modern hrsc schemes and their applications ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "to date , the most commonly used hrsc schemes in relativistic hydrodynamics have been ones that have not incorporated many of the recent advances in hrsc research . in this work",
    ", we will apply a new scheme to the srhd equations that is simpler than most of the previous approaches and incorporates a number of recent advances from hrsc research . in rahman @xmath0 moore ( 2005 ) , this scheme was applied to the multidimensional classical hydrodynamics code . the work presented here",
    "should be considered an extension of that work . before describing the motivations behind the algorithm used in this work , we provide a brief review of numerical methods used for the srhd equations and that of hrsc schemes .",
    "wilson j. r. ( 1972 ) , wilson et al .",
    "( 1979 ) , hawley et al .",
    "( 1984 ) , and centrella @xmath0 wilson ( 1984 ) were the first to apply numerical methods to approximate the srhd equations .",
    "they discretized the srhd equations using an explicit finite difference scheme with artificial viscosity and monotonic transport .",
    "since their work , this technique has been used to study a number of astrophysical phenomena including stellar collapses , accretion disks , cosmology etc .",
    "most srhd schemes up to the late eighties used the artificial viscosity technique of wilson et al .",
    "( 1979 ) to handle shock waves .",
    "however , a major breakthrough occurred when hrsc schemes were applied to the srhd equations ( @xcite ) .",
    "one of the most significant of these new schemes was the relativistic piecewise parabolic method ( ppm ) by mart @xmath0 mller ( 1996 ) ( mm ) which was based on the ppm reconstruction scheme of colella @xmath0 woodward ( 1985 ) .",
    "for a recent review of modern srhd schemes , we refer the reader to mart @xmath0 mller ( 2003 ) .",
    "the use of hrsc schemes for srhd equations essentially shifted the paradigm for solving these equations from artificial viscosity based methods to this approach .",
    "modern hrsc schemes are based on two conventional approaches for solving hyperbolic conservation laws .",
    "these are the so - called upwind ( @xcite ) and central methods ( @xcite ) .",
    "a common aspect of most modern hrsc - srhd schemes is that they are solved using upwind schemes that use so - called riemann solvers to approximate the solution .",
    "a drawback of using riemann solvers is that they are computationally expensive and difficult to implement because they need computations of eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the flux matrix and uses flux splittings etc .",
    ", to compute the numerical fluxes .",
    "on the other hand , central schemes do not use riemann solvers and are simpler and easier to implement . until recently ,",
    "central schemes were not considered for wide ranging applications because a trade - off for their simplicity was loss of accuracy .",
    "this is because central schemes were generally more dissipative than their upwind counterparts .",
    "however , recent progress in hrsc research has addressed this issue and some newer formulations of central schemes have been shown to be comparable performance - wise to the upwind approach .",
    "the work presented here is based on some of these newer central schemes . before discussing them",
    ", we provide below a brief overview of central schemes and discuss the most important aspect of hrsc schemes known as non - oscillatory data reconstructions methods .",
    "modern central schemes are based on the first and second order shock capturing algorithms developed by lax - friedrichs ( lxf ) ( @xcite ) , and nessyahu @xmath0 tadmore ( 1990 ) ( nt ) , respectively .",
    "since nt , there have been a number of extensions of central hrsc schemes to higher orders and multidimensions .",
    "some of these recent extensions are summarized below .",
    "the nt scheme was extended to 3@xmath1 order by liu @xmath0 tadmor ( 1998 ) , and to multidimensions by jiang @xmath0 tadmore ( 1998 ) .",
    "these were followed by a new formulation of central hrsc schemes known as semidiscrete central schemes .",
    "the semidiscrete schemes were designed to address the dissipation issue mentioned above and were proposed in kurganov @xmath0 tadmore ( 2000 ) ( kt ) .",
    "kt showed that semidiscrete schemes , which are formulated on non - staggered grids and use more accurate information of local speeds of propagation , are less dissipative than their staggered grid counterparts .",
    "hence , these schemes retained the simplicity of the central approach and were comparable in accuracy to other riemann solver based upwind approaches .",
    "the inception of semidiscrete central schemes precipitated a great deal research on extending this formalism which included higher order formulations in multidimensions , genuinely multidimensional formulations and unstructured grid formulations among others(@xcite ) .    besides the method used to advance the solution ,",
    "another aspect of hrsc schemes that is equally important for any algorithm is the so called non - oscillatory data interpolation method .",
    "data interpolation is used in all hrsc schemes .",
    "non - oscillatory data reconstruction is the piecewise continuous polynomial interpolation of the data ( which may contain discontinuities ) over the computational domain .",
    "most of the hrsc schemes mentioned above use the so called essentially non - oscillatory ( eno ) ( @xcite ) data reconstruction algorithm for data interpolation .",
    "this methods works by interpolating the data using the smoothest stencil from a number of choices .",
    "a modern extension of eno schemes is the weighted essentially non - oscillatory data reconstruction ( weno ) algorithm ( @xcite ) that has a number of advantages over its predecessor . in order to take advantage of the developments in central approaches and high order data reconstruction ,",
    "another class of hrsc schemes were developed as an extension of the nt scheme by levy et al .",
    "( @xcite ) called the central weighted non - oscillatory ( cweno ) schemes .",
    "recently , kurganov @xmath0 levy ( 2000 ) ( kl ) have combined the semidiscrete central schemes with the weno reconstruction method and proposed yet another , better hrsc scheme .",
    "the work presented here is based on the kl hrsc scheme which we will describe below .    despite the many advances mentioned above",
    ", there have been relatively few attempts at applying central - type methods to computational astrophysics .",
    "however this is rapidly changing . among the most significant attempts to apply central schemes for computational astrophysics , the following are noteworthy .",
    "del zanna @xmath0 bucciantini ( 2002 ) , have developed an algorithm that is a variation of the conventional finite volume central type approach and applied it to multidimensional srhd and srmhd equations .",
    "they have also used these codes to study pulsar wind nebula ( pwn ) interactions with the interstellar medium @xcite and supernova remnants @xcite .",
    "anninos @xmath0 fragile ( 2003,2004 ) have developed a new central type scheme for relativistic hydrodynamics in fixed , curved spacetime and have applied their scheme to study accretion disks around kerr black holes .",
    "lucas - serano et al .",
    "( 2004 ) have assessed the applicability of central schemes to srhd equations using the ppm data reconstruction scheme @xcite .",
    "their results were the first to demonstrate that central type schemes of kt can be used for srhd .",
    "recently , shibata @xmath0 font ( 2005 ) have successfully tested the suitability of central type schemes for general relativistic simulations .",
    "we turn our attention now to applications of the weno data reconstruction methods in computational astrophysics .",
    "balsara ( @xcite ) have used the weno methods extensively in magnetohydrodynamics .",
    "feng et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , have recently developed a cosmological hydrodynamics code using the weno reconstruction scheme .",
    "zhang @xmath0 macfadyen ( 2005 ) , have recently used the weno scheme in their adaptive srhd code .",
    "the work mentioned above point to a promising future for the application of central and weno schemes in astrophysical hydrodynamics .",
    "indeed , the work presented here was done concurrently with many of the recent work mentioned above . however , the algorithm presented here is the first to combine the weno and the semidiscrete central approach for applications in srhd .",
    "we describe below this algorithm and its novel aspects .    in a previous paper , @xcite ,",
    "we have described in detail the incentive behind our algorithm for multidimensional classical hydrodynamics .",
    "many of the same reasons apply for the srhd equations as well .",
    "the algorithm is based on combining the semidiscrete approach of kurganov @xmath0 levy ( 2000 ) with high order weno data reconstruction methods . to ensure robustness",
    "we have added the flattening , steepening and monotonicity preserving techniques of the ppm reconstruction scheme by colella @xmath0 woodward ( 1985 ) to the data reconstruction scheme .",
    "essentially , the simplicity of central schemes , the accuracy weno reconstructions and the robustness of the piecewise parabolic method have been combined to propose a new robust central scheme .",
    "building on the success of this algorithm for classical hydrodynamics , it has been applied to the srhd equations .",
    "this work is original in several respects .",
    "it is the first attempt at solving the srhd equations using the semidiscrete central scheme with weno data reconstructions .",
    "the algorithm has been tested using both 3@xmath2 and 4@xmath3 order data reconstruction techniques .",
    "it is also a dimensionally unsplit algorithm and to our knowledge is the only unsplit multidimensional algorithm in srhd .",
    "the work presented here can be considered as laying the foundation for the development of a multi - purpose , multi - dimensional srhd code that could be used to study a wide variety of astrophysical phenomena .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "sec . 2 presents the srhd equations .",
    "3 describes the new algorithm for numerically approximating the srhd equations . in sec . 4 , we present the results of a number of one dimensional benchmark tests . in sec .",
    "5 , the two dimensional tests are presented .",
    "finally we conclude this paper in sec . 6 .",
    "as a system of hyperbolic conservation laws , the equations of special relativistic hydrodynamics are given by @xmath4 where the indices run from 1 to 3 . in the above equations @xmath5 and @xmath6",
    "are given by @xmath7 here @xmath8 is the kronecker delta , @xmath9 is the three velocity and @xmath10 is the pressure .",
    "the relationship between the conserved variable and the primitive variable is given by @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the specific enthalpy ; @xmath13 , and @xmath14 is the lorentz factor satisfying @xmath15 with @xmath16 .",

    "the difference between the conserved and the primitive variables in these equations require special treatment in the algorithm which will be discussed below .",
    "this section presents the new algorithm for solving the srhd equations implemented in this work .",
    "this algorithm is very similar to that presented in a previous paper ( @xcite ) .",
    "besides one major sub - step , that of recovering the primitive variables from the conserved variables , it is in fact identical . however , for the sake of completeness , a very brief description of it is provided .",
    "as mentioned before , this new srhd algorithm is based on the combination of the semidiscrete central scheme of kurganov @xmath0 levy ( 2000 ) ( kl ) , and the steepening , flattening and monotonicity preserving algorithm of mm . for a review and details of the derivation of kl ,",

    "in this paper , both 3@xmath2 and 4@xmath32 order weno reconstruction methods of @xcite are used . in eq .",
    "10 , @xmath26 is the speed of propagation of @xmath33 at the interface of a cell that is determined from the spectral radius of the jacobian of the flux @xmath34 . for a system of equations in multidimensions ,",

    "4 - 6 . in each step of our integration routine ,",
    "once the conserved variables are updated , the primitive variables are immediately recovered .",
    "the method used to do this is by solving of a non - linear equation using the newton - raphson root finding method ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "it is this aspect of numerical srhd that makes them computationally more expensive than the euler equations of gas dynamics .",
    "we can now summarize our algorithm in the following few steps :    * step 1 * : _ given initial data @xmath37 ( primitive variables ) , use an @xmath38 ( for n @xmath39 4 ) order weno reconstruction algorithm to construct a piecewise polynomial interpolation of each variable .",

    "srhd schemes are usually tested by a series of standard benchmark problems .",

    "<S> we have proposed a new high resolution shock capturing ( hrsc ) scheme for special relativistic hydrodynamics ( srhd ) based on the semidiscrete central godunov - type schemes and a modified weighted essentially non - oscillatory ( weno ) data reconstruction algorithm . </S>",
    "<S> this is the first application of the semidiscrete central schemes with high order weno data reconstruction to the srhd equations . </S>",
    "<S> this method does not use a riemann solver for flux computations and a number of one and two dimensional benchmark tests show that the algorithm is robust and comparable in accuracy to other srhd codes . </S>"
