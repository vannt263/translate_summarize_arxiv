    "one of the simplest models of the neighborhood of the cosmological singularity ( cs ) , inspired by string / m theory @xcite , is the compactified milne ( cm ) space .",
    "it has been used in the cyclic universe scenario @xcite .",
    "figure 1 shows the two dimensional cm space embedded in three dimensional minkowski space .",
    "it can be specified by the following isometric embedding @xmath0 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 is a constant labelling compactifications .",
    "one has @xmath3 eq . ( [ stoz ] ) presents two cones with a common vertex at @xmath4 .",
    "the induced metric on ( [ stoz ] ) reads @xmath5 generalization of the 2-dimensional cm space to the @xmath6 dimensional spacetime has the form @xmath7 where @xmath8 .",
    "one term in the metric ( [ line2 ] ) disappears / appears at @xmath9 , thus the cm space may be used to model the big - crunch / big - bang type singularity .",
    "orbifolding @xmath10 to the segment gives a model of spacetime in the form of two orbifold planes which collide and re - emerge at @xmath9 .",
    "such a model of spacetime was used in @xcite .",
    "our results apply to both choices of topology of the compact dimension .",
    "the cm space is an orbifold due to the vertex at @xmath9 .",
    "the riemann tensor components equal @xmath11 for @xmath12 .",
    "the singularity at @xmath9 is of removable type : any time - like geodesic with @xmath13 can be extended to some time - like geodesic with @xmath14 .",
    "however , the extension can not be unique due to the cauchy problem at @xmath9 for the geodesic equation ( the compact dimension shrinks away and reappears at @xmath9 ) .",
    "the cs plays the key role , in the cyclic model of the evolution of the universe , because it joins each two consecutive classical phases . a reasonable model of",
    "the cs should allow for the propagation of an elementary object ( particle , string , membrane , ... ) from the pre - singularity to the post - singularity epoch .",
    "if the cs constitutes an insurmountable obstacle for elementary objects , the cyclic evolution can not be realized .",
    "we have already applied the above criterion for the propagation of a test particle @xcite and a test string @xcite . in",
    "what follows ( and in @xcite ) we examine the dynamics of a string in the so - called winding mode @xcite .",
    "it is defined to be a state in which the string is winding around the compact dimension undergoing contraction to a point followed by re - expansion . in @xcite",
    "we have considered the classical and quantum dynamics of a _ zero - mode _ string , i.e. a string in its lowest energy state . here",
    "we present results concerning the propagation of a classical string in _ non - zero modes _ , i.e. excited states of a string .",
    "the propagation of a string is described by analytic functions .",
    "thus , it is non - singular in the entire spacetime including the cs .",
    "the results we have obtained suggest that the cm space is a promising model of the cs deserving further investigation .",
    "the next section presents the method of finding solutions to the dynamics in the cm space .",
    "first , we define 2d cm space by making use of 2d minkowski space .",
    "then , we recall known solutions in the minkowski space . later , we impose the topology and symmetry conditions , specific for the cm space , on the solutions in the minkowski space .",
    "realization of these conditions leads finally to the solutions in the cm space . as illustrations , we give two specific examples of solutions .",
    "we conclude in the last section .",
    "the metric corresponding to the compactified milne space reads @xmath15 it is locally flat and can be rewritten in the form of the minkowski metric , if we make the following change of coordinates @xmath16 figure 2 illustrates the compactification of the milne space .",
    "suppose that @xmath17 are coordinates of the milne space , which parameterize the interior of the light - cone .",
    "we compactify the milne space by identification of the points @xmath18 for some fixed value of @xmath19 , where @xmath20 . this way the boundaries of the ` grey ' region become identified .",
    "in what follows we use the _ local flatness _ of ( [ met ] ) to solve the dynamics of a string in the cm space .",
    "the string propagation is expressed in terms of embedding functions @xmath21 , which map the 2d space of the string coordinates into the @xmath22-dimensional cm space .",
    "an action describing a test string in a fixed background spacetime with metric @xmath23 may be given by the polyakov action @xmath24 where @xmath25 are string worldsheet coordinates , @xmath26 is a mass per unit length , @xmath27 is the string worldvolume metric , and @xmath28 $ ] .    inserting @xmath29 ( which is a special choice of gauge on the string s worldsheet ) and",
    "@xmath30 into ( [ ac2 ] ) gives the minkowski space case .",
    "variation of @xmath31 with respect to @xmath32 gives @xmath33 the condition @xmath34 leads to @xmath35 plus a boundary term .",
    "hence , the string s propagation in minkowski space is described by @xmath36 @xmath37 where @xmath38 are any functions .",
    "the equations ( [ gauge2 ] ) are just gauge constraints .",
    "we can make use of these solutions to construct string solutions in the cm space which wind round the compact dimension , and so can be expressed in terms of a function @xmath39 , where @xmath40 .",
    "it follows from ( [ min ] ) that the range of this mapping has a non - trivial topology due to the existence of the singular point @xmath41 .",
    "if this point is chosen to correspond to @xmath42 then we arrive at the following topology condition @xmath43 where @xmath44 and @xmath45 are any functions .",
    "more generally , we can perform such conformal transformation ( i.e. , @xmath46 , where @xmath47 ) on the solution ( [ mink ] ) which leads to @xmath48 .",
    "one can verify that the solutions for @xmath49 which depend only on a single variable , either @xmath50 or @xmath51 , are excluded .",
    "it follows from ( [ min ] ) that we have the implication : @xmath52 .",
    "this means that for @xmath53 we have @xmath54 , which leads to @xmath55 .",
    "the map @xmath56 is everywhere invertible except on the curve @xmath57 , because this curve is mapped into the single point @xmath58 . in this way we have defined a map with its range in a neighborhood of the singularity @xmath59 , having its domain within a global coordinate system on the string s worldsheet .",
    "it is illustrated schematically in fig 3 .    .",
    "the map is invertible for @xmath60 , and non - invertible for @xmath53.,scaledwidth=56.0%,scaledwidth=56.0% ]    .",
    "the map is invertible for @xmath60 , and non - invertible for @xmath53 . ]    .",
    "the map is invertible for @xmath60 , and non - invertible for @xmath53.,scaledwidth=56.0%,scaledwidth=56.0% ]      now , let us impose the symmetry condition on the remaining @xmath61 embedding functions",
    ". due to the assumption made earlier , @xmath62 are functions of @xmath63 and @xmath64 , i.e. @xmath65 and are to be periodic in @xmath64 .",
    "it follows from ( [ sym ] ) that @xmath66    @xmath67    so the symmetry condition states that @xmath68 is periodic in @xmath69 . in other words",
    ", we should determine @xmath70 and @xmath71 from @xmath72 where @xmath73 are functions of @xmath63 whose exact form we will discover below .",
    "it may seem to be impossible to satisfy these conditions .",
    "one obstacle is due to the fact that on the left - hand side we have a sum of functions of a single variable , while on the right - hand side there is a sum of functions which depend in a rather complicated way on both variables .",
    "however , we can compare both sides of ( [ deter ] ) at a line . in this way one can rule out one of the variables and compare functions dependent on just a single variable .",
    "the procedure rests upon the fact that the dynamics is governed by a second order differential equation ( [ eom ] ) , and thus it is sufficient to satisfy the symmetry condition by specifying @xmath62 , @xmath74 on a single cauchy s line .",
    "we choose it to be the singularity , i.e. the line @xmath75 , or equivalently @xmath9 .",
    "one can check that as @xmath76 , one gets @xmath77 , where the prime indicates differentiation with respect to an arbitrary parameter .",
    "our strategy consists in the imposition of the two conditions : @xmath78 @xmath79    in this way we get the following simplifications : ( i ) as we compare functions on a line we in fact compare functions of a single variable , ( ii ) since we choose the line @xmath9 , we obtain a rather simple form on the right - hand side in the form of a periodic function of @xmath80 .",
    "the only remaining work to be done is to find the operator @xmath81 in the limit @xmath82 .",
    "let us start with the general expression for @xmath81 @xmath83 now , we evaluate all the components in the above expression : @xmath84    @xmath85    @xmath86    @xmath87    one gets @xmath88      let us now study the first condition ( [ one ] ) . at the singularity we have @xmath89 which leads to @xmath90 where @xmath91 and @xmath92 are constants , and @xmath93 is a function to be determined .    the second condition ( [ two ] )",
    "says that if we act on ( [ deter ] ) with the @xmath81 operator and then go to the limit we will end up with the sum of @xmath94 times constant .",
    "it means that @xmath95 where @xmath96 and @xmath97 are constants . from ( [ c2 ] )",
    "we conclude that @xmath98      now let us consider ( [ c1 ] ) .",
    "it does not fully determine the functions @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "this results from the fact that the topology condition ( [ sym ] ) , which introduced these functions , is invariant under the transformation @xmath99 where @xmath100 is arbitrary .",
    "thus we fix this gauge by introducing a constraint @xmath101 now from ( [ c1 ] ) we get @xmath102 where @xmath103 , @xmath104 , @xmath105 , @xmath106 and @xmath107 are arbitrary constants .",
    "we fix the gauge further and put @xmath108 where @xmath109 is an arbitrary constant .",
    "therefore , the solution reads @xmath110 where @xmath111 .",
    "these solutions should satisfy the gauge conditions ( [ gauge2 ] ) , which in the case of the cm space read @xmath112    at this stage , we can determine @xmath64 and @xmath63 , from ( [ fun1 ] ) and ( [ fun2 ] ) , as functions of @xmath50 and @xmath51 @xmath113 from the last equation we infer that @xmath114 .",
    "finally , the solutions as functions of @xmath63 and @xmath64 have the form @xmath115 where @xmath116 denotes @xmath116-th excitation . the number of arbitrary constants in ( [ gen ] )",
    "can be reduced by the imposition of the gauge condition ( [ gauge ] ) .",
    "equation ( [ gen ] ) defines the solution corresponding to the compactification of one space dimension to @xmath117 .",
    "the solution corresponding to the compactification to a _ segment _ , can be obtained from ( [ gen ] ) by the imposition of the condition @xmath118 , which leads to @xmath119 and @xmath120 , where @xmath121 $ ] .",
    "the general solution ( [ gen ] ) shows that the propagation of a string through the cosmological singularity is not only continuous and unique , but also analytic .",
    "solution in the cm space is as regular as in the case of the minkowski space .    the imposition of the gauge constraint ( [ gauge ] ) on the infinite set of functions given by ( [ gen ] )",
    "produces an infinite variety of physical states .",
    "this procedure goes exactly in the same way as for a closed string in minkowski spacetime , but with a smaller number of degrees of freedom due to the condition that the string is winding around the compact dimension .",
    "let us consider the propagation of a uniformly winding string , i.e. without @xmath64-dependance , in @xmath6 dimensional spacetime @xmath122 where the second equation comes from the gauge constraint .",
    "thus we have @xmath123 equation ( [ sol ] ) coincides with eq .",
    "( 18 ) of our paper @xcite describing the propagation of a string in the zero - mode state , i.e. the lowest energy state .",
    "the velocity of the string , which is calculated with respect to the ` cosmological time ' @xmath63 , is given by the formula @xmath124 , where @xmath111 .",
    "at the singularity such a string moves with the speed of light .      in what follows",
    "we present the state with one oscillation mode .",
    "the embedding space is five dimensional : @xmath125 where the last equation is the gauge constraint .",
    "the solution can be rewritten in a more compact form ( after renaming some of the constants ) @xmath126 let us calculate the speed of the string @xmath127 and @xmath128 where @xmath129 is the speed of the center of mass and reaches its maximal value @xmath130 at the singularity .",
    "the transverse speed is denoted by @xmath131 .",
    "it does not depend on @xmath64 since the string is a circle . its value is a function of both the cosmological time and the phase of the oscillation so the total speed @xmath132 does not necessarily reach the speed of light at the singularity .",
    "the reason is that the string , contrary to the previous example , has some length and therefore nonzero mass even at the singularity .",
    "the results presented here show that the classical dynamics of a test string in a _ non - zero mode _ winding around the compactified dimension is well defined .",
    "there are no ambiguities in the dynamics near the singularity as is characteristic of particle dynamics @xcite .",
    "the reason is that a string covers the @xmath64-dimension , so the string does not propagate around this dimension . while a particle can propagate in this dimension ,",
    "i.e. a particle has one degree of freedom connected with the @xmath64-direction ; this is not the case for a string .",
    "the property of a string that it is a one dimensional object makes it possible to go through the singularity in an unique way .",
    "these results are consistent with the analysis of our previous paper @xcite dealing with the string in the _ zero - mode _ state .",
    "we have found the solutions in the cm space with two different topologies of the compactified dimension ( circle and segment ) .",
    "both solutions are simply related .",
    "the latter cm space presents an interesting model of two ` end of the world ' branes , and it has been used recently @xcite .    the results presented here and in @xcite open the door for the examination of the dynamics of extended objects with dimensionality higher than one .",
    "consideration of the winding modes is again preferable .",
    "this will be shown in our next paper dealing with the dynamics of a membrane in the compactified milne space .",
    "we have not considered transitions between exited states during the evolution of the system . that might give some insight into the the backreaction problem .",
    "we shall come back to this issue in next papers .",
    "our results concern the dynamics of a _",
    "test _ string . by definition ,",
    "the test string does not change the background spacetime .",
    "a great challenge is examination of the dynamics of a _ physical _ string , i.e. a string that may change its state and modify the background spacetime during the evolution of the entire system .",
    "backreaction phenomena can not be ignored .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that , for instance , a single particle added to a time dependent singular orbifold causes the orbifold to collapse into a large black hole , which leads finally to the creation of a big - crunch that would not be followed by a big - bang .",
    "in such a case the compactified milne space would not make sense as a model of the neighbourhood of the cosmological singularity in the context of the cyclic universe scenario .",
    "however , the results of @xcite are based mainly on classical general relativity , which is not suitable for understanding the microphysics of a black hole .",
    "complete understanding of the problem requires quantization of the entire system including both string and embedding spacetime .",
    "work is in progress ."
