    "in recent years , rare @xmath4 decays are attracting more and more attentions , since they provide a good opportunity for testing the standard model(sm ) , probing @xmath5 violation and searching for possible new physics beyond the sm .",
    "since 1999 , the data sample of the pair production and decays of @xmath4 mesons collected by babar and belle collaborations is increased rapidly . in the future lhc - b experiments , @xmath1 and @xmath6 mesons",
    "can also be produced , and the rare @xmath4 decays with a branching ratio around @xmath7 can be observed .",
    "the rapid progress in current @xmath4 factory experiments and the bright expectation in lhc - b experiments induced a great interest in the studies of rare decays of @xmath4 meson .",
    "the rare decay @xmath8 can occur only via annihilation diagrams in sm because none of quarks in final states is the same as those of the initial @xmath9 meson .",
    "the usual method to treat non - leptonic decays of b meson is factorization approach(fa ) @xcite , which has achieved great success in explaining many decay branching ratios @xcite .",
    "however , this method failed in describing @xmath10 decay , because we need the @xmath11 form factor at very large momentum transfer @xmath12 .",
    "so far , little is known about the form factor at such a large momentum transfer in fa . in the qcd factorization approach @xcite",
    ", one can not perform a real calculation of the annihilation diagrams , but estimating the annihilation amplitude by introducing a phenomenological parameter . in this paper",
    ", we calculate the branching ratio and @xmath5 asymmetries of @xmath13 decay by employing the perturbative qcd approach(pqcd ) @xcite .",
    "this method has been developed for the studies of the b meson decays @xcite and successfully applied to calculate the annihilation diagrams @xcite . when the final states are light mesons such as pions , the perturbative qcd approach(pqcd )",

    "the direct cp asymmetry @xmath87 has a strong dependence on the ckm angle , as can be seen easily from eq.([dcpv ] ) and fig .",
    "[ figure : fig3 ] . from this figure",
    "one can see that when the ckm angle @xmath69 is around @xmath90 the direct cp asymmetry reaches its peak , which is about @xmath91 .",
