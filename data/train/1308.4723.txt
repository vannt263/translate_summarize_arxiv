    "the large hadron collider ( lhc ) has now concluded the 8 tev run gathering a total of approximately 20 fb@xmath1 of integrated luminosity .",
    "the large number of top - quarks produced allow for an unprecedented precision in the study of top quark observables .",
    "it is well known that flavour changing neutral currents ( fcnc ) involving a top quark are negligibly small in the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "they can however be larger by up to eight orders of magnitude in some extensions of the sm  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the search for signals of fcnc processes involving the top - quark is an excellent means of testing the validity of the sm while simultaneously probing some of its extensions .",
    "direct top production is the most sensitive process to probe the fcnc vertex involving a top - quark , a light - quark and a gluon . at the parton level , direct top",
    "is simply given by @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 is a gluon , @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the up , charm and top quarks respectively .",
    "no evidence for top - quarks originating from the direct top process was found in the searches performed by the experiments at the tevatron  @xcite and at the lhc where the best limits on the anomalous strong fcnc couplings were obtained by the atlas collaboration  @xcite . in the atlas analysis",
    "@xcite , the direct top signal events were generated with the protos  @xcite monte carlo generator .",
    "the upper limit on the production cross - section was then converted into limits on the anomalous coupling constants . in order to account for the next - to - leading - order ( nlo ) corrections ,",
    "a k - factor was used according to the nlo calculation of the fcnc direct top process  @xcite .",
    "the bound can also be written as a 95 % c.l .",
    "limit on the top fcnc branching ratios @xmath7 and @xmath8  @xcite with the assumption that only one of the fcnc vertices @xmath9 or @xmath10 is turned on at a time . in this work",
    "we perform a similar analysis using the nlo generator metop  @xcite , a tool made recently available dedicated to top quark fcnc production .",
    "metop has a complete set of dimension six operators for the study of fcnc top - quark interactions  @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is threefold .",
    "first we want to compare the previous analysis where the events were generated at leading - order ( lo ) and normalized with a k - factor with one where the direct top events are generated at nlo using metop .",
    "we will therefore redo the analysis performed by the atlas collaboration in  @xcite with the nlo events generated by metop .",
    "second , because metop also includes the lo hard fcnc process @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is a light jet , we will account for the contribution of the hard process to the analysis already performed .",
    "our goal is to check weather a sizeable improvement in the limit is obtained just by adding the events from the fcnc single top process to the direct top events . finally , we will perform an analysis where again we follow  @xcite but allow for one extra hard jet in the signal .",
    "it is clear that the final state will then be very similar to the sm single top one .",
    "hence , our objective is to check if the major increase in the background can be compensated by the increment in the number of signal events .",
    "three different sets of signal events were generated with metop  @xcite ,    * fcnc direct top @lo : @xmath13 , * fcnc direct top @nlo : @xmath14 , * fcnc direct top @nlo plus fcnc single top @lo : @xmath15    the last set @xmath16 is a weighed combination of direct top production at nlo with fcnc single top production at lo .",
    "as discussed in  @xcite , only one fcnc operator for each light quark ( @xmath17 and @xmath18 ) contributes to the direct top process .",
    "therefore , each set is composed of two samples - one where only the @xmath19 coupling is turned on and the other where only the @xmath20 coupling is turned on .",
    "the generation of the fcnc single top quark events in @xmath21 followed the same rule .",
    "all events were generated assuming a sm top quark decay , _ i.e. _ , @xmath22 % and only the leptonic decay of the @xmath23 was considered .",
    "additionally , the full @xmath24 leptonic decay was taken into consideration in both signal and background .",
    "we have used the parton density function ( pdf ) set cteq6  @xcite for all leading order ( lo ) processes and cteq6.6  @xcite for the nlo cross sections .    as previously stated",
    "the sm fcnc cross section is negligible due to its very low cross section .",
    "the most significant backgrounds are single top production , @xmath25 production , @xmath26 plus jets ( both light and heavy jets ) , diboson production and the multijet background .",
    "the single top background ( t - channel , s - channel and @xmath27 associated production ) together with @xmath25 were generated with powheg  @xcite at nlo and the cteq6.6 nlo pdfs were used . for @xmath23 plus light jets , @xmath28 plus light jets , @xmath29 , @xmath30 ( plus light jets ) and @xmath31 plus light jets we have used alpgen  @xcite with the cteq6 lo pdfs . in all events generated with alpgen",
    "the jets have a transverse momentum above 20 gev and @xmath32 .",
    "further , in the @xmath23 plus jets case , the jets have @xmath33 and for @xmath31 plus jets @xmath34 . for both the @xmath23 and the @xmath31 plus jets events ,",
    "the number of jets was varied from 0 to 3 . to remove overlaps between @xmath35 and @xmath36 partons the mlm matching scheme  @xcite",
    "the cross sections were then normalized at nlo using mcfm  @xcite .",
    "the events were then submitted to a parton shower simulator performed with pythia 6  @xcite in order to include initial ( isr ) and final ( fsr ) state radiation , as well as multiple interactions .",
    "the perugia tune  @xcite was used to handle the underlying events in poweg while the atlas mc09 tune  @xcite was used for events generated with alpgen .",
    "finally , both signal and background detector simulation was performed with delphes  @xcite , which is a framework for the fast simulation of a generic detector in a collider experiment .",
    "for the detector and trigger configurations , we resorted to the atlas default definitions in delphes .",
    "however , in order to reproduce the atlas analysis as faithful as possible we have redefined the sum of the @xmath37 in a cell to be calculated within a cone of @xmath38 for the lepton , and @xmath39 for the jet .",
    "additionally , the b - tagging efficiency was set to be 57% , and the b - mistagging to 0.2% for light - quark jets and 10% for c - quark jets .",
    "these values were chosen to match the atlas analysis  @xcite .",
    "finally , we have not considered the diboson and multijets background which in the atlas analysis  @xcite amounts to 9 % of the total background ( the largest contribution comes from multijets with about 6.7 % ) .",
    "as previously discussed we have performed two different analysis .",
    "the first one is similar to one presented in  @xcite by the atlas collaboration .",
    "it should be noted however that besides the usual cut - based analysis , atlas uses a multivariate analysis technique ( neural - network ) to separate signal from background . as we will not be using this multivariate technique , our results",
    "can not be compared with theirs .",
    "this is not an issue because our aim is not to compare our analysis with the experimental one but rather to study its performance for different sets of events generated with metop .",
    "the atlas analysis will be used as our standard analysis because it provides the best current limits on the @xmath19 and @xmath20 strong fcnc couplings .",
    "it will also serve as a means to control our background . in the present work the limits on the fcnc couplings",
    "were obtained using the atlas cut - based part of the analysis plus an additional cut on the top invariant mass . from now on , we shall call this analysis `` atlas '' but it should be clear that this is not the atlas analysis performed in  @xcite . a detailed description of what we call the `` atlas '' analysis will be presented below .",
    "still in the framework of this first analysis we will consider a new set of signal events , @xmath21 , that is , we will add the fcnc single top to the nlo direct top .",
    "the atlas final state consists of one b - quark jet , one lepton ( electron or muon ) and missing energy . in the analysis",
    ", we ask for exactly zero non - b jets .",
    "however , a jet can only be identified with @xmath40 and @xmath34 .",
    "this means that some of the events from fcnc single top will still pass the selection if the non b - jet is soft .",
    "hence , we will study how the inclusion of the fcnc single top events will affect the bound on the couplings .",
    "the second analysis will be performed considering a different final state topology with an extra hard non - b jet . in table",
    "[ tab1.1 ] we present the total cross section for each of the three set of events , where the fcnc coupling constants were set to either zero or @xmath41 tev@xmath1 . the @xmath42 sample and the corresponding total cross section is produced with a 10 gev cut on the jet @xmath43 . for completeness",
    "we present the strong fcnc operator which we write as @xmath44 where @xmath45 is real , @xmath46 is the strong coupling and @xmath47 and @xmath48 are complex numbers with @xmath49 ( see  @xcite for a detailed discussion relating the forms of the strong fcnc operators ) . for the chosen value of the coupling constant",
    ", the fcnc single top cross section gives an additional contribution of 14% and 27% to the full nlo direct top cross section , for the @xmath19 and @xmath20 operators respectively .",
    "these extra events are kinematically similar to the sm single top ones and are therefore expected to be mainly located in regions discarded by the atlas analysis . nevertheless , it is important to understand if an analysis that considers an extra hard jet can lead to an improvement on the fcnc couplings limit",
    ". we will refer to this analysis as atlas(m ) .",
    ".@xmath50 @xmath14 and @xmath51 total cross sections for @xmath52 tev and @xmath41 tev@xmath1 .",
    "[ tab1.1 ] [ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the results presented in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] and in table  [ tab3 ] allow us to conclude that a slight improvement in the bound can be achieved by including the full set of events @xmath21 in the atlas analysis .",
    "the same is true for the atlas(m ) analysis when compared with atlas , even when the @xmath21 is considered .",
    "however , we should look at this results as an indication that a full detector analysis is worth doing . first because the improvement is only of the order a few % and second because since we did not consider the multi - jet background , we could be overestimating the sensitivity in atlas(m ) .",
    "we have studied top production at the lhc via fcnc interactions .",
    "we have performed two different analysis using the metop generator which allows for the production of nlo direct top events and lo fcnc @xmath11 events . in the first one we have followed atlas in  @xcite but using two different samples , one with only direct top nlo events and the other one with direct top nlo plus the lo @xmath42 fcnc events . in the second analysis",
    "we allow for an extra hard non - b jet in the final state increasing both the signal and the background yields .",
    "we have concluded that the inclusion of the fcnc single top events has increased the sensitivity .",
    "even if the limit is better by only a few percent this should be implemented in the experimental analysis because this is a real contribution to the process and should not be neglected .",
    "furthermore , its inclusion is straightforward with metop . in the second analysis",
    "the limit on the couplings is significantly better . in this case",
    "however we should look at the result as an indication that an experimental analysis is worth performing .",
