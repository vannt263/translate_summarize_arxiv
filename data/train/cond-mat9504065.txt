    "<S> the local fields @xmath20 include the external field @xmath6 and the interactions with the neighbours of spin @xmath21 , which are not in the cluster :    @xmath22    the constant @xmath23 summarizes the interactions between the non  cluster spins and can be dropped . the construction of the unfrustrated cluster works in the following way : a spin is randomly selected as seed . </S>",
    "<S> iteratively neighbouring spins are added , if no frustration occours . </S>",
    "<S> if a cluster can not be extended , one more seed  spin is selected . </S>",
    "<S> the following algorithm contains the details . </S>",
    "<S> the local variables @xmath24 are used to indicate the spins , which are already detected as neighbours of the cluster . </S>",
    "<S> the set @xmath25 contains the neighbours of spin @xmath21 , which are already in a cluster , whereas @xmath26 contains the neighbours , which are added to the boundary of the cluster .    </S>",
    "<S> a run for calculating a groundstate consists of choosing randomly an initial configuration or choosing all spins pointing up , and calculating new configurations until the energy can not further be lowered . for this in our experiments we found as a good criterium that the energy did not change for the last @xmath27 steps . we used @xmath28 ( 2d,3d ) as rule of thumb , because in some very long runs we observed , that the longest period between two jumps in energy never exceeded this value and scaled almost linear with system size .    </S>",
    "<S> because the minimum energy reached in a run depends on the starting configuration and on the clusters , which were constructed , we performed several runs for each realization of the random variables @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> we used that one , which ended on the lowest energy level . </S>",
    "<S> we found 3 runs per realization sufficent , because by increasing the number of runs , the average groundstate energy was only lowered about @xmath29 percent .    because in each step the spin  </S>",
    "<S> cluster is randomly built and by using the algorithm @xcite all of the degenerated cluster  groundstates have a positive probability to be calculated , usually in each step a new spin configuration is constructed , even if the energy remains constant . </S>",
    "<S> so it is possible to explore large areas of the configuration space .    in figure [ e_von_t ] the average energy density @xmath30 of 96 realizations </S>",
    "<S> is shown as a function of the step number for lattice sizes @xmath31 of the 2d system . </S>",
    "<S> one can see , that in the beginning the algorithm approaches very fast low values . </S>",
    "<S> later the decrease in energy is very small .    </S>",
    "<S> it is possible to use other procedures in selecting the spins of the cluster . </S>",
    "<S> we tried three other methods ( we call the first presented algorithm _ method a _ ) :     0.4 cm 2.7 cm    not only neighbours of cluster  spins were added to the stack @xmath32 , but neighbours of all spins , which were tested , if they can be added to the cluster .    </S>",
    "<S> the spins which were tested , if they can be added to the cluster were totaly selected at random from the spins , which were yet untested .    </S>",
    "<S> methods a and b are applied alternately .    </S>",
    "<S> we tested all four methods by calculating groundstates for eight realizations of @xmath33 systems ( 3 runs each ) . in table </S>",
    "<S> [ tab1 ] the average groundstate energy density @xmath34 is displayed . </S>",
    "<S> also we constructed for the 2d and 3d case 100 respectively 10 spin - clusters for 100 realizations of system sizes @xmath35 . </S>",
    "<S> the average size fractions @xmath36 of the spin  </S>",
    "<S> clusters are shown in the last two rows .    </S>",
    "<S> .comparison of four methods used to construct spin - clusters [ cols=\">,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we observed , that for some realizations method a and for others method b gave lower energies , so it is plausible , that the combination of both methods gave the best results . </S>",
    "<S> so we used method d for all further experiments . </S>",
    "<S> maybe better methods for constructing the cluster would result in a faster convergence and/or lower energies .    to estimate the groundstate energies of the 2d and 3d @xmath0 spin glass we performed calculations for lattice sizes @xmath37 ( 2d ) and @xmath38 ( 3d ) with 96 @xmath39 , respectively 32 @xmath40 realizations of the random variables @xmath5 .    in figure [ e0_von_l ] the groundstate energy density @xmath41 of the 2d systems </S>",
    "<S> is plotted as function of system size . to estimate the groundstate energy density of the infinite system we performed a finite - size scaling analysis . </S>",
    "<S> a fit to the function @xmath42 @xcite results in @xmath43 . </S>",
    "<S> this value is consistent with earlier results from a genetic algorithm @xmath44 @xcite , multicanonical simulations @xmath45 @xcite pure mc @xmath46 @xcite and transfer matrix calculations @xmath47 @xcite .    the results for the 3d systems are shown in figure [ e0_von_l3d ] . </S>",
    "<S> the fit gives a groundstate energy density of @xmath48 . </S>",
    "<S> the results of other authors are @xmath49 @xcite and @xmath50 @xcite    as seen in figure [ e_von_t ] the time for approaching the groundstate increases rapidly with the system size . </S>",
    "<S> the average number of steps needed to calculate a groundstate are shown in figure [ t0_von_l ] as a function of the number of spins @xmath51 . </S>",
    "<S> for the 2d system ( lower curve ) a fit to a function @xmath52 results in a timecomplexity of @xmath53 . </S>",
    "<S> the result for the 3d system is similiar : @xmath54 . because the time to calculate one groundstate of the cluster increases quadraticly with the number of spins @xcite and the size of the cluster is linear in the system size , this totally results in an approximate cubic timecomplexity of the algorithm . performing one run for example for a @xmath55 system consisting of 1000 configurations needed about 10 hours on a 80 mhz powerpc processor system .    in order to characterize the way the algorithm approaches the groundstates we selected one realization of a 2d ( @xmath56 ) system and used configurations of different energy densities @xmath57 </S>",
    "<S> $ ] as starting  configurations . for each configuration 8 </S>",
    "<S> different runs for constructing groundstates were performed . </S>",
    "<S> for each run , which resulted in the groundstate energy density value of @xmath58 the last 100 configurations were stored . </S>",
    "<S> the overlap    @xmath59    was calculated between all pairs @xmath60 of groundstates belonging to a starting - configuration . </S>",
    "<S> we obtained the corresponding probability distributions @xmath61 by counting the numbers of overlaps within intervals of length @xmath62 . </S>",
    "<S> the result is displayed in figure [ overlap ] for the starting energies @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 . </S>",
    "<S> for these three staring energies 800 , 300 respectively 400 of the resulting states exhibited the lowest energy density . </S>",
    "<S> one can see , that the algorithm approaches local minima of the energy landscape . </S>",
    "<S> the higher the starting energy the more minima are reachable . if a system is caught in a local minimum , only a restricted area of configuration space can be explored by the algorithm , although in each step a different configuration is generated which is indicated by @xmath66 . </S>",
    "<S> but for other realizations we got also different distributions . </S>",
    "<S> there are systems where @xmath61 is always narrow or always broad , independent of the starting energy . </S>",
    "<S> the accessible area is usually smaller for lower groundstate energies than for higher lying groundstates .    in conclusion , </S>",
    "<S> in this letter we have presented an algorithm for the approximation of groundstates for ising spin glasses . </S>",
    "<S> its time complexity is approximately cubic in the number of spins . </S>",
    "<S> because by each step a large number of spins is allowed to flip , the algorithm approaches low energies very rapidly .    </S>",
    "<S> so it should be interesting to try combinations with other algorithms like genetic algorithms or monte carlo simulations , or to use it for other ising type optimization problems .    </S>",
    "<S> although we applied it to the @xmath0 model it is also possible to treat more general forms of lattices , interactions and their probability distributions .    </S>",
    "<S> it should possible to get results for @xmath67 in a resonable amount of time in order to characterize better the phase diagramm along the @xmath68 axis . </S>"
