    "one can trace the behavior of cosmological bounce in the jordan frame if one follows the behavior of the scalar field @xmath37 in the einstein frame .",
    "let us first discuss about the particular potential branch @xmath187 in the einstein frame , which can support cosmological bounces in presence or absence of hydrodynamic matter .",
    "first we discuss about cosmological bounces in the absence of any hydrodynamic matter .",
    "bounce in the absence of matter in the jordan frame occurs when the scalar potential in the einstein frame vanishes , as discussed previously . in this branch , at the bouncing time @xmath74 , the value of the scalar field @xmath244 when @xmath245 . in this branch , there are several possible lines of development of the cosmological system .",
    "these possibilities depend on the `` velocity '' ( @xmath246 or @xmath247 ) of the scalar field at the time of bounce .",
    "the contraction phase can start from @xmath248 , cross that point ( jordan frame bounce ) , rise up to a maximum along the potential @xmath187 and come down again . if the scalar field has enough initial kinetic energy it can also cross over the maxima of @xmath187 and then slowly roll towards @xmath249 .",
    "if it chooses to come down again it crosses @xmath250 again , but this does not correspond to a bounce , which can be understood by a careful look at the einstein frame initial conditions .",
    "then it goes down towards @xmath251 . while the universe moves towards @xmath169 in the einstein frame , the cosmological system in the jordan frame moves so that the ricci scalar their becomes @xmath6 . in doing",
    "so the universe will require an infinite time in the jordan frame .",
    "one can also program bounce , in absence of matter , in such a way that the einstein frame scalar field starts from above @xmath252 during the contracting phase , then the cosmological system crosses the bounce point and goes down towards @xmath251 .",
    "cosmological bounce in presence of hydrodynamic matter follows a similar course except for the fact that at the time of bounce the scalar field assumes some value @xmath250 where @xmath253 .",
    "more over , one must remember that bounce in the presence of matter can also occur in the @xmath178 branch of the potential .",
    "similar consideration holds for the potential branch @xmath179 but only for matter induced bounce . in this case",
    "@xmath37 assumes some value @xmath250 at the time of bounce , such that @xmath254 . in this branch",
    "increasing or decreasing of @xmath37 correspond to decreasing or increasing of the scalar curvature @xmath1 .",
    "the particular case of bounce in the @xmath179 branch , where @xmath37 starts from some @xmath248 and evolves towards @xmath255 , is interesting . in this case",
    "the contracting phase may proceed to the bounce point @xmath244 and then crosses this point and goes towards @xmath176 . in this branch as @xmath256 as @xmath257 , as apparent from fig [ fig : phir ] , one can assume that the universe is evolving to a radiation dominated phase where the dynamics is governed by general relativity .",
    "the region near the @xmath256 can act as a cross - over region from @xmath0 theory to general relativistic dynamics .",

    "note that out of these two conditions only @xmath260 can be chosen suitably .",
    "the value of @xmath37 at bounce is already specified by the relation in eq .",
    "( [ rbn ] ) which gives , @xmath261 in this case @xmath37 starts from some point where @xmath262 ( see fig .  [",

    "[ fig : auefp_bounce ] shows cosmological bounces in presence of radiation in both the branches @xmath177 , @xmath179 and in the approximate unique einstein frame potential for the same initial conditions @xmath264 . unlike the matterless case , here both",
    "the initial conditions can be chosen suitably , with the only condition that the scalar field potential at bounce has to be negative . in these cases",
    "@xmath37 starts from some point @xmath265 , crosses the point @xmath244 , goes up to a maximum along the potential and then comes down again .",
    "the important thing to be noticed in the above mentioned bouncing phenomena , in presence of matter , is that the same conditions at the time of bounce produces three different kinds of time dependence of the scale factor @xmath13 in the jordan frame .",
    "consequently these bounces are distinctly different and shows the richness of polynomial @xmath0 gravity .",
    "in this paper we have extended our analysis on cosmological bounces , for the spatially flat flrw solutions , in higher derivative @xmath0 theories of gravity . in our earlier work",
    "@xcite we proposed a scheme by which one can study the phenomena of cosmological bounces , using spatially flat flrw solutions , in @xmath0 theories using only the equations of general relativity .",
    "the method relied on the validity of the conformal transformations which connected cosmological dynamics in the jordan frame , where the dynamics is governed by @xmath0 theory , and the auxiliary einstein frame which is used to do the calculations related to the problem .",
    "once the problem is solved in the einstein frame one can map the solutions to the jordan frame and get the bounce dynamics .",
    "this program can be flawlessly applied for the case of quadratic gravity where @xmath266 where @xmath267 is some constant negative real number . in the case of quadratic gravity",
    "it turns out that there is only one unique einstein frame description of the bouncing phenomena .",
    "it was immediately noticed that the methods used in the earlier publication were not adequate when one uses higher order polynomials as cubic @xmath0 .",
    "the einstein frame picture of cubic gravity and other higher order polynomial gravity does not have a one - to - one correspondence with the jordan frame description of the cosmological evolution and consequently one does not know a priory which picture in the einstein frame corresponds to the actual picture in the jordan frame .",
    "in the present work we have proposed a consistent method using which one can map the cosmological bouncing problem from the einstein frame to the jordan frame .",
    "the present work shows that a proper understanding of the conformal transformations yields interesting properties of the cosmological bounces in the jordan frame . unlike the case of quadratic gravity , in higher order polynomial gravity there are multiple ways in which cosmological bounces can occur . in the case of quadratic gravity",
    "only bounce in presence of hydrodynamic matter was allowed where as in cubic gravity one can also have cosmological bounces in absence of any form of hydrodynamic matter .",
    "the issue of energy conditions was briefly touched in the present work .",
    "we have shown that one can always produce a cosmological bounce in the jordan frame without violating the weak energy condition and the null energy condition in the einstein frame . the strong energy condition and the dominant energy conditions",
    "may be violated near the bouncing point in the einstein frame .",
    "the interesting thing about the einstein frame analysis , of the bouncing problem , is that all the energy conditions are valid at @xmath268 , which corresponds to the actual bouncing time in the jordan frame . for a cosmological bounce",
    "the energy conditions in the jordan frame are violated but one must have to remember that the energy conditions are not that clearly and uniquely formulated in the jordan frame . as a result one may not be very serious about the energy conditions in the jordan frame .    in this work",
    "we have introduced the techniques to understand the origin of multiple scalar potentials in the einstein frame for cubic or higher order @xmath0 gravity .",
    "we have explicitly worked out the cosmological bounces arising out of the various potential branches in the einstein frame .",
    "our discussion also includes the approximate einstein frame potential which one can use to study cosmological behavior near @xmath11 as given in @xcite .",
    "as soon one includes the multiple potentials in the einstein frame the richness of the cosmological scenario becomes apparent . in the penultimate section we have presented the ansatz following which",
    "one may map from the einstein frame picture to the jordan frame picture without any confusion .",
    "the other important observation which is reported in the present work is related to the cosmological behavior of the universe as it evolves from a bounce to a state where the ricci scalar attains a value @xmath8 where @xmath6 is the root of the equation @xmath7 . here",
    "the primes denote derivatives with respect to the ricci scalar .",
    "it was noticed that the conformal transformations between the jordan frame and the einstein frame breaks down precisely at the point @xmath8 for cubic gravity . in the present work",
    "we show that the state of the universe when @xmath8 can never be connected to the bouncing universe in a finite time . in other words",
    "the flat flrw universe , described by cubic @xmath0 theory in the jordan frame , would take an infinite time to attain @xmath8 after the cosmological bounce .",
    "the roots of @xmath7 bifurcates the region of cosmological existence . we have presented our results for cubic gravity but we hope that our results are general in nature and can hold true for higher order polynomial gravity .",
    "this particular issue requires further research .",
    "more over the points @xmath8 are interesting , as out of the the two branches emanating from this point in fig .",
    "[ fig : phir ] , the one on the right of @xmath8 has @xmath9 and the one on the left of @xmath8 has @xmath10 . on the left branch one may expect dolgov - kawasaki like instability in the low curvature limit of the theory .",
    "but as this branch also includes the point @xmath11 one has the freedom for a cross - over to more conventional gr dynamics as the ricci scalar becomes small in magnitude .",
    "ideally the dolgov - kawasaki instability can not be applied to the very early universe , in @xmath0 theory , as at those times the curvature may be very high and consequently one can always use the left branch to model cosmological bounces happening in the very early universe .",
    "lastly , we have utilized all the conceptual understanding about cubic gravity to actually solve the cosmological bounce problem .",
    "the results are given in fig .",
    "[ fig : matt_bounce ] , fig .",
    "[ fig : matt_less_bounce ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : auefp_bounce ] .",
    "these results are obtained by solving the problem in the einstein frame and then mapping the solutions back to the jordan frame .",
    "these solutions show various bounce possibilities in the jordan frame for the case of cubic gravity .",
    "we expect the possibilities of various kind of cosmological bounces will increase with the order of polynomial gravity as more and more einstein frame scalar potentials will emerge in the conformally connected einstein frame . in this paper we do not present the theory of cosmological perturbations as our main aim was to analyze the complicated and rich background cosmological evolution in polynomial @xmath0 theories .",
    "we will present the perturbations on this background in a forthcoming publication .",
    "although , the use of the einstein frame as an auxiliary frame to calculate the background bouncing dynamics was purely a technical choice it turned out that this technical choice yields much valued information about the actual jordan frame cosmological evolution if one can disentangle the multi valued correspondence between the conformal frames .",
    "the technique evolved in the present work can be valuable as one can use pure general relativistic techniques to solve a problem in a higher derivative @xmath0 theory of gravity . although the methods discussed in this article were particularly aimed to tackle the problem of bouncing cosmologies in the jordan frame , we firmly believe that many of the techniques developed in this article can also be applied to understand the general nature of @xmath0 theories",
