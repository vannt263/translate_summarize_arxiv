    "<S> though the uncertainties of the sm prediction have not been settled , there remains the possibility for the deviation to be physical . if this deviation is a signal of new physics , additional contribution to the muon @xmath0 is required to be @xmath1 .    </S>",
    "<S> .the evaluation of the leading hadronic vacuum polarization contribution [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     supersymmetry ( susy ) is one of the most motivated models which extend the sm and the muon @xmath0 has been investigated in susy models  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these models often provide the universal gaugino mass . </S>",
    "<S> however once susy is extended to include the gravity , the quantum effects via the super - weyl anomaly  @xcite always manifest themselves in the soft susy breaking terms and give another class of gaugino mass spectra . </S>",
    "<S> this susy breaking mediation mechanism is known as anomaly - mediated susy breaking ( amsb )  @xcite . though anomaly - mediated effects may be small compared to the other susy breaking effects , there are some cases where amsb become dominant . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , amsb dominates if the susy breaking sector has no direct interactions with the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) sector but gravitation . in this letter , we study models where the anomaly - mediated effects dominate . </S>",
    "<S> though amsb has attractive features  , the original model  @xcite suffers from the tachyonic slepton problem . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore a parameter set which survives the @xmath2 bound generally leads a negative contribution to the muon @xmath0 .    </S>",
    "<S> various attempts have been made to avoid the tachyonic slepton  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the deflected amsb model  @xcite is a successful and attractive one . in particular </S>",
    "<S> , this model makes the sign of the wino mass @xmath10 and the gluino mass @xmath11 _ </S>",
    "<S> identical_. this is very important for the recent result of the muon @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the experimental results of the muon @xmath0 and the branching ratio of @xmath2 favor both @xmath12 and @xmath13 positive , where @xmath14 is higgs mixing parameter . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> the pure amsb model predicts opposite sign of the wino and gluino masses , and some additional mechanism is required to modify the gaugino mass relations . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the muon @xmath0 has been investigated in the minimal amsb scenario  @xcite , where only the sfermion sector is modified . in this scenario , </S>",
    "<S> the sign of wino and gluino mass is opposite . </S>",
    "<S> thus if we regard the deviation between @xmath15 and @xmath16 given in eq.([eq : e821 ] ) as a signal of new physics , this model conflicts with the recent muon @xmath0 result and the @xmath2 bound . </S>",
    "<S> thus the gaugino sector should be modified . </S>",
    "<S> such additional effects , however , generally induce new cp violating phases in the gaugino masses . </S>",
    "<S> the deflected amsb scenario is the only known model in amsb which provides a natural solution to both of these problems .    </S>",
    "<S> the deflected amsb model is safe against cp and flavor violations   parameter is also suppressed . </S>",
    "<S> a mechanism for the suppression has been proposed in the context of the deflected amsb  @xcite . ] and provides a preferred sign of a susy contribution to the muon @xmath0 . however , the higgs mass and the @xmath2 branching ratio put severe constraints on the parameter space . in the deflected amsb squarks are generally not so heavy compared to other susy breaking scenarios and the higgs mass bound requires relatively large soft masses . </S>",
    "<S> thus the susy contribution to the muon @xmath0 becomes rather small . as a result </S>",
    "<S> , large @xmath3 is required to enhance the muon @xmath0 and thus the @xmath2 branching ratio bound becomes dangerous . </S>",
    "<S> hence the detailed analysis is required for the deflected amsb whether this model is phenomenologically viable when the susy contribution to the muon @xmath0 is as large as @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> an investigation of the muon @xmath0 in the deflected amsb scenario has been performed by abe _ </S>",
    "<S> et al _  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , where hadronic axion model in this framework are studied . </S>",
    "<S> however abe _ et al _ made less general analysis . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the parameter space is specified to provide realistic axion decay constant . </S>",
    "<S> moreover the higgs mass is also calculated by using the effective potential at one loop level . </S>",
    "<S> however the higher order corrections become important for the higgs mass . </S>",
    "<S> hence we reanalyze the deflected amsb model in more general setting .    </S>",
    "<S> let us first review the soft masses and some properties of the deflected amsb model  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the anomaly - mediated effects on the soft masses can be given by inserting the compensator field , @xmath17 . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath18 is vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of the scalar auxiliary field in the gravitational supermultiplet and takes a value of order of the gravitino mass . in order to avoid tachyonic slepton and </S>",
    "<S> modify gaugino masses , we introduce a singlet field @xmath19 whose auxiliary component has non - zero vev by the following superpotential . </S>",
    "<S> we also add @xmath20-pairs of @xmath21 and @xmath22 of @xmath23 to mediate the susy breaking from the singlet field @xmath19 to mssm sector . </S>",
    "<S> then the additional terms in the superpotential consist of the following two parts ; @xmath24 and the non - renormalizable term @xmath25 where @xmath26 is a some mass parameter which is assumed to be of order of the plank scale , and @xmath27 is a positive integer but larger than three . by minimizing the scalar potential of @xmath19 , the vevs of the scalar and auxiliary components of @xmath19 are determined . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the auxiliary component vev becomes @xmath28 and obviously we do not introduce new cp violating phase .    </S>",
    "<S> once the scalar component of @xmath19 acquires the vev , @xmath20-pairs of @xmath29 and @xmath30 have masses @xmath31 and play the same role as the messenger fields in gmsb . at the messenger scale @xmath32 , the chiral superfields @xmath29 and @xmath30 decouple and the threshold effects induce the additional corrections to the soft parameters . as a result </S>",

    "<S> the parameter @xmath41 takes @xmath42 for @xmath43 and @xmath44 and @xmath45 for other particles . </S>",
    "<S> thus the soft susy breaking masses are of order @xmath46 . </S>",
    "<S> phenomenologically , @xmath18 and the gravitino mass are required to be @xmath47 .    </S>",
    "<S> there is also the case of not including @xmath48 in the superpotential . in this case , the soft masses take the identical values to @xmath49 in eqs.([m_lam])([a_f ] ) , thus this model is often called the case of `` @xmath50 '' and in this letter , we refer to this case as `` @xmath50 '' . </S>",
    "<S> we note @xmath19 is a flat direction and only lifted by the pure amsb effect , but the scalar potential of @xmath19 is not stabilized . </S>",
    "<S> there are some approaches to stabilize the potential by introducing a extra uv free gauge symmetry  @xcite or higher dimensional terms in the khler potential  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> then the vev of @xmath19 can be determined . for the sake of the generality of the model , </S>",
    "<S> we regard the vev of @xmath19 as a free parameter in the following .    we also note here the issue of the lightest superparticle ( lsp ) . in the case of @xmath49 , </S>",
    "<S> the mass of the fermionic part of the singlet field , @xmath51 , is approximately @xmath52 f_\\phi^\\dagger\\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we assume @xmath53 and neglect @xmath54 and @xmath55 gauge couplings . </S>",
    "<S> one can see that the mass of @xmath51 arises at the two - loop level and is much lighter than any other mass of the superparticle in the mssm sector . </S>",
    "<S> thus @xmath51 becomes the lsp in this case . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , for @xmath56 , the mass of @xmath51 is as heavy as @xmath57 . in this case , we investigate which particle will be the lsp in the mssm sector .    </S>",
    "<S> we summarize the parameters in the model . </S>",
    "<S> there are six parameters : @xmath58 we fix these parameters at the messenger scale @xmath32 and solve one loop renormalization group equation from the messenger scale to the weak scale . </S>",
    "<S> then we determine the magnitude of higgsino mass @xmath14 and higgs mass parameter @xmath59 by electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) conditions with the higgs potential at one loop order .    </S>",
    "<S> now we analyze the muon @xmath0 in the model . at the weak scale , we calculate the susy contribution to the muon @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the susy contribution consists of chargino - sneutrino and neutralino - smuon diagrams . with some approximations , </S>",
    "<S> the susy contribution is expressed as  @xcite @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the muon mass and @xmath62 is a typical mass of the superparticles in the loop diagrams . from this equation </S>",
    "<S> , we find some important features . </S>",
    "<S> first , the susy contribution to the muon @xmath0 is enhanced when @xmath3 is large . </S>",
    "<S> second , @xmath63 decreases as @xmath62 become heavier . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the recent e821 result suggests @xmath64 to be positive .    </S>",
    "<S> some experiments provide constraints on the model . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the higgs boson mass bound is severe . </S>",
    "<S> generally , susy models predict not so large higgs mass . therefore the heavy stops or the large top trilinear coupling @xmath65 </S>",
    "<S> are required  @xcite to satisfy the lower bound from the lep ii experiment  @xcite @xmath66 since in the deflected amsb model , the trilinear coupling is not so large , stops should be heavy . </S>",
    "<S> that is , @xmath18 is required to be large . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the model tends to predict relatively small gluino mass at the messenger scale . </S>",
    "<S> consequently squarks do not receive large renormalization group corrections from gluino . </S>",
    "<S> thus the higgs mass bound requires the whole superparticles to be relatively heavy and hence the muon @xmath0 tends to be suppressed . in the numerical analysis </S>",
    "<S> , we use the feynhiggsfast package  @xcite to compute the lightest higgs boson mass .    </S>",
    "<S> the muon @xmath0 is enhanced by increasing @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> then the constraint from the inclusive @xmath2 decay becomes important . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental measured value of @xmath67 is consistent with the sm prediction . on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> , susy contributions may significantly change the sm prediction of @xmath67 . </S>",
    "<S> the susy contribution to @xmath67 mainly consists of charged higgs - top and chargino - stop diagrams and they are enhanced for large @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> thus when @xmath3 is large , dominant parts of the susy contribution have to cancel each other . </S>",
    "<S> such cancellation occurs when @xmath68 is positive and this situation is naturally given by the deflected amsb scenario . in this letter </S>",
    "<S> , we estimate the sm contribution according to ref .  @xcite . as for the charged higgs contribution </S>",
    "<S> , we use the next - to - leading order calculation  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the superparticle contributions are mostly computed at one loop order . to evaluate these contributions </S>",
    "<S> , we also take into account corrections in powers of @xmath69 , which are important for large @xmath3  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the calculated branching ratio should be compared with the recent measurement @xmath70 by ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . here </S>",
    "<S> we take a rather conservative range @xmath71    finally , we impose the experimental bounds on the superparticles masses . </S>",
    "<S> the models which predict the large susy contribution to the muon @xmath0 may contain some light superparticles . thus negative searches of superparticle set lower bounds of the masses of superparticles and put constraints on the model . in our analysis </S>",
    "<S> we require that all charged superparticles are heavier than @xmath72 .    </S>",
    "<S> the results of numerical analysis are shown in figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : n3m12][fig : n3m16 ] . </S>",
    "<S> these are the case of @xmath49 . here </S>",
    "<S> we determine @xmath18 such that the higgs boson mass becomes @xmath73 and plot the values of @xmath63 with several values of @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> we consider @xmath3 in the range @xmath74   actually makes the muon @xmath0 larger , but too large @xmath3 ( _ e.g. _ @xmath75 ) makes the bottom yukawa coupling blow up below the gut scale . ] . </S>",
    "<S> we also change @xmath20 and @xmath32 . at first , we find that the susy contribution to the muon @xmath0 become larger as the number of the messengers increases . </S>",
    "<S> this is because , for larger @xmath20 , gaugino masses become larger , that is , @xmath18 becomes smaller with the fixed value of higgs mass . </S>",
    "<S> thus the susy contribution to the muon @xmath0 is enhanced when @xmath20 increases . </S>",
    "<S> secondly , larger messenger scale @xmath32 makes the muon @xmath0 larger with @xmath20 fixed . </S>",
    "<S> this behavior is caused by the renormalization group effects , that is , if the messenger scale increases , the renormalization group effects make colored superparticles heavier compared to the uncolored ones . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the muon @xmath0 is enhanced as the messenger scale larger with the higgs boson mass fixed . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we can see that the deviation of the muon @xmath0 favors large @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> this is because of the higgs mass bound . from the results of the case of @xmath49 , the muon @xmath0 reaches 1@xmath9 region of the deviation with @xmath76 .    </S>",
    "<S> the contours of constant @xmath3 terminate at the dotted lines   lines for convenience . ] which show the bounds from the experimental constraints and the absence of the electroweak symmetry breaking . </S>",
    "<S> first , the negative search of the right - handed stau excludes the region of large @xmath20 and @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> this is because when @xmath20 becomes large , the sfermions becomes lighter ( see eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ m^2_f ] ) ) and larger @xmath3 drive the sfermion masses smaller by the renormalization group effects . </S>",
    "<S> secondly , we notice that the region of small @xmath20 is excluded . in this region with small @xmath3 , </S>",
    "<S> the electroweak symmetry breaking does not occur . on the other hand , for large @xmath3 the susy contribution to @xmath2 </S>",
    "<S> becomes too large .    in figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : n4m12][fig : n4m16 ] , we consider the case of @xmath77 . here </S>",
    "<S> the parameters except for @xmath27 are the same as figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : n3m12][fig : n3m16 ] , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> we can understand these results by noting that @xmath27 appears as the combination @xmath78 in the gaugino masses . </S>",
    "<S> that is , the results of @xmath77 largely resemble the results with smaller @xmath20 in the case of @xmath49 . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , the sfermion masses depend on @xmath27 and @xmath20 in the different way and they become smaller as @xmath27 increases with gaugino masses fixed . </S>",
    "<S> this effect can not be neglected for the uncolored superparticles . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the muon @xmath0 becomes larger with the higgs boson mass almost fixed . </S>",
    "<S> as for @xmath67 , the constraint becomes severer because the mass hierarchy between colored and uncolored superparticles becomes larger . </S>",
    "<S> the large @xmath18 regions also become to be excluded by the absence of the electroweak symmetry breaking .    </S>",
    "<S> the phenomenology of the deflected amsb model depends sensitively on a choice of @xmath79 . </S>",
    "<S> we can see that less messengers make almost all region be excluded by the tachyonic sleptons for fixed @xmath27 . </S>",
    "<S> in fact for @xmath50 , more than 4 pairs of messengers are required . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath27 is increased with @xmath20 fixed , gauginos become lighter and sleptons tend to be tachyonic . thus larger @xmath27 requires larger number of messengers . </S>",
    "<S> however too many messengers make the gauge couplings blow up below the gut scale  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the cases of @xmath80 are not attractive .    here </S>",
    "<S> we comment on the lsp . </S>",
    "<S> if we take @xmath77 , the fermionic part of the singlet field @xmath19 is no longer the lsp . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the mass of @xmath51 is of order of gravitino and is much heavier than the mssm particles . </S>",
    "<S> thus we investigate the lsp in the mssm sector . in the deflected amsb model , </S>",
    "<S> uncolored superparticles tend to be lighter than colored ones . </S>",
    "<S> we can see that the right - handed stau or one of the higgsino - like neutralinos becomes the lightest . in the almost all region of figs .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : n4m12][fig : n4m16 ] , we found that the lsp is the stau and thus this region is cosmologically not favored if the stau is stable  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , we do not take this result seriously because there is a possibility that some light particle , say the fermionic partner of the axion , exists . </S>",
    "<S> if we require the neutralino to be the lsp , very small parameter regions are allowed only when @xmath81 ( in figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : n4m14 ] and [ fig : n4m16 ] ) or @xmath82 ( in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : n4m16 ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> we should note here that our results depend on top quark mass @xmath83 . </S>",
    "<S> the radiative correction to the lightest higgs boson mass is sensitively enhanced for larger value of @xmath83 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the constraint from the higgs mass becomes looser when @xmath83 is larger . </S>",
    "<S> in the above analysis , we use @xmath84 . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> the study in the case @xmath85 gives the heavier higgs mass about 2 - 3 gev compared to the previous case of @xmath84 at the same values of @xmath32 and @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> thus the model is viable on the wider region with the susy contribution to the muon @xmath0 large enough .    as a discussion </S>",
    "<S> , we touch on the case of negative @xmath27 . in this case , the sign of the wino mass is the same as that of the gluino mass as the case of positive @xmath27 . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore the slepton mass squareds become positive with less messengers . </S>",
    "<S> the strongly interacting @xmath86 gauge sector makes @xmath27 negative  @xcite , where @xmath27 is given by @xmath87 . as a distinctive feature , </S>",
    "<S> the bino and the wino are much lighter than the gluino as opposite to the positive @xmath27 case . </S>",
    "<S> thus the mass hierarchy between colored and uncolored superparticles becomes large . </S>",
    "<S> hence smaller @xmath3 is required to enhance the muon @xmath0 with the higgs mass bound satisfied . </S>",
    "<S> then the lsp almost becomes the bino - like neutralino .    in this letter </S>",
    "<S> , we studied the deflected amsb scenario in the light of the recent result of the muon @xmath0 from the brookhaven e821 experiment . </S>",
    "<S> the recent result of the muon @xmath0 suggests the deviation from the sm prediction , though the uncertainties of the sm prediction , especially from the leading hadronic contribution , have not been settled . </S>",
    "<S> the results of the muon @xmath0 and @xmath2 require @xmath64 and @xmath68 to be positive simultaneously . </S>",
    "<S> the deflected amsb is the only known model in amsb which provides this feature with avoiding additional cp violating phase naturally . by the detailed analysis </S>",
    "<S> , we found that in the deflected amsb model , the susy contribution to the muon @xmath0 becomes as large as @xmath1 , which is sufficient for the 3@xmath9 deviation of the e821 result , with other experimental constraints satisfied . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the higgs mass puts a severe constraint on the model and large @xmath3 is favored to enhance the muon @xmath0 . </S>"
