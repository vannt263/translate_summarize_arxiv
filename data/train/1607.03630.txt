    "relativistic hydrodynamics has been widely used for description of macroscopic dynamics in various fields ranging from nuclear physics to astrophysics .",
    "high - energy heavy - ion collision experiment is one of the active areas of relativistic hydrodynamics applications .    in 2005 at relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) , production of strongly - interacting quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) was achieved , which was supported not only by the experimental data but also theoretical analyses @xcite .",
    "studies based on relativistic hydrodynamics have shown remarkable success in understanding various observables such as particle distributions , collective flows , particle correlations and so on @xcite .",
    "the strong elliptic flow at rhic is a highlight of the success of hydrodynamic models and is one of the evidences that the qgp is not a weakly interacting gas but a strongly interacting matter .",
    "since then the hydrodynamic model has been one of the promising phenomenological models for the description of dynamics of hot and dense matter produced in the heavy - ion collisions .",
    "construction of relativistic viscous hydrodynamic model has been of practical importance and has formed a basis for the analyses of the heavy - ion collisions @xcite . in the last decade , the hydrodynamic model itself has also been developed through the analyses of experimental data of heavy - ion collisions at rhic and the large hadron collider ( lhc ) . by comparing the hydrodynamic model calculations and the experimental observables such as particle distributions and collective flows , detailed bulk properties of qgp such as the qcd equation of state and its transport coefficients have been investigated .",
    "also , physical qcd equation of state is now available by lattice qcd simulations at vanishing chemical potential @xcite and is applied to the hydrodynamic model .",
    "this enables us to bridge the first principle lattice qcd simulations and the experimental data in the heavy - ion collisions .    in spite of the success of hydrodynamic models in high - energy heavy - ion collisions ,",
    "there are still several issues under discussion .",
    "currently the hydrodynamic models often adopt israel - stewart theory @xcite and a second - order viscous hydrodynamics from ads / cft correspondence @xcite as their basic equations .",
    "however , we have not reached the conclusion on which relativistic viscous hydrodynamic equation is suitable for the description of relativistic heavy - ion collisions .",
    "this is because the extension from relativistic ideal hydrodynamic equation to viscous hydrodynamic equation is not straightforward and several possible candidates exist .",
    "also viscous second - order anisotropic hydrodynamics is proposed which reproduces the exact solution of the boltzmann equation in the relaxation - time approximation @xcite .",
    "furthermore it remains as an enormous challenge to understand why hydrodynamics can be applied to the dynamics shortly after a heavy - ion collision takes place .",
    "conclusive understanding of the mechanism of thermalization and hydrodynamization in such a short time scale is still missing .    here",
    "we emphasize that numerical algorithm for solving the relativistic hydrodynamic equation is one of the important ingredients in developing the hydrodynamic models .",
    "recent high statistical experimental data at rhic and the lhc impose more rigorous numerical treatment on the hydrodynamical models . for example , at rhic and the lhc , higher harmonic anisotropic flow , which is expressed by the higher fourier coefficient of particle yields as a function of azimuthal angle , is reported @xcite .",
    "the origin of the higher harmonics is considered to be event - by - event initial fluctuations in the particle distributions .",
    "when comparing with those high statistical data , reducing the numerical dissipation of the numerical algorithm for relativistic hydrodynamic equations should allow us an access to more precise value of transport coefficients of the qgp .",
    "usually each algorithm has advantages or disadvantages in terms of coding , computational time , numerical precision and stability . up to now , unfortunately , only little attention has been paid to the numerical aspects in the hydrodynamic models for high - energy heavy - ion collisions .",
    "recently we developed the state - of - the - art numerical algorithm for solving the relativistic hydrodynamic equation with the qgp equation of state @xcite . in the algorithm",
    ", we use a riemann solver based on the two - shock approximation @xcite which is stable under existence of large shock waves @xcite .",
    "the new numerical scheme is stable even with small numerical viscosity and can reduce the numerical uncertainly when extracting the physical viscosity of the qgp from experimental data . however , this algorithm in ref .",
    "@xcite is developed in cartesian coordinates .",
    "meanwhile , at the high - energy heavy - ion collisions such as rhic and the lhc , the expansion in longitudinal direction is rapid compared with that in transverse direction . for the description of space - time evolution of high - energy heavy - ion collisions ,",
    "milne coordinates are more suitable than cartesian coordinates .",
    "therefore we extend our algorithm of relativistic ideal hydrodynamics in cartesian coordinates to that in milne coordinates so that we can efficiently apply it to the analyses of high - energy heavy - ion collisions .",

    "<S> we construct a new godunov type relativistic hydrodynamics code in milne coordinates , using a riemann solver based on the two - shock approximation which is stable under existence of large shock waves . </S>",
    "<S> we check the correctness of the numerical algorithm by comparing numerical calculations and analytical solutions in various problems , such as shock tubes , expansion of matter into the vacuum , landau - khalatnikov solution , propagation of fluctuations around bjorken flow and gubser flow . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate the energy and momentum conservation property of our code in a test problem of longitudinal hydrodynamic expansion with an initial condition for high - energy heavy - ion collisions . </S>",
    "<S> we also discuss numerical viscosity in the test problems of expansion of matter into the vacuum and conservation properties . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we discuss how the numerical stability is affected by the source terms of relativistic numerical hydrodynamics in milne coordinates . </S>"
