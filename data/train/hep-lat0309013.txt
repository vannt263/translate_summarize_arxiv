    "the study of the baryon decuplet to octet electromagnetic transitions provides important insight into the strongly interacting regime of qcd .",
    "spin - parity selection rules for these transitions allow for magnetic dipole ( m1 ) , electric quadrupole ( e2 ) , and coulumb quadrupole ( c2 ) amplitudes .",
    "understanding these amplitudes , both in theory and experiment , gives insight into the ground state wavefunctions of the lowest lying baryons .",
    "for example , in the transition of the @xmath2 to the nucleon , if both baryon wavefunctions are spherically symmetric then the e2 and c2 amplitudes vanish . experimentally , m1 is seen to be the dominant amplitude . however ,",
    "recent experimental measurements of the quadrupole amplitudes in the @xmath3 transition  @xcite show that the quadrupole amplitudes e2 and c2 are likely non - zero .",
    "this has revitalized the discussion as to the mechanism for deformation of the baryons .",
    "although we expect more experimental data in the future , progress will be slower for the remaining transitions as the experimental difficulties are significant .",
    "first - principle lattice qcd calculations of these matrix elements can provide a theoretical explanation of these experimental results .",
    "in fact , the experimental difficulties may force us to rely on lattice data for the non - nucleonic transitions .",
    "recently several such lattice calculations  @xcite , which improve upon an earlier one  @xcite , have appeared .",
    "although these calculations still largely employ the quenched approximation of qcd , we expect partially quenched calculations to be performed in the near future .",
    "unfortunately now and foreseeably , these lattice calculations can not be performed with the physical masses of the light quarks as the calculation time would be prohibitively long .",
    "therefore , to make physical predictions , it is necessary to extrapolate from the heavier quark masses used on the lattice ( currently on the order of the strange quark mass ) down to the physical light quark masses .",
    "chiral perturbation theory ( ) provides model - independent input for the behavior of observables as a function of quark masses",
    ".    for lattice calculations that use the quenched approximation of qcd ( qqcd ) , where the fermion determinant that arises from the path integral is set equal to one , quenched chiral perturbation theory ( )  @xcite has been developed to aid in the extrapolation .",
    "the problem with the quenched approximation is that the goldstone boson singlet , the @xmath4 , which is heavy in qcd , remains light in qqcd and must be retained in , requiring the addition of new operators and hence new low - energy constants in the lagrangian . in general ,",
    "the low - energy constants appearing in the lagrangian are unrelated to those in  and extrapolated quenched lattice data is unrelated to qcd .",
    "in fact , several examples show that the behavior of meson loops near the chiral limit is frequently misrepresented in  @xcite .",
    "these problems of qqcd can be remedied by using partially quenched lattice qcd ( pqqcd ) .",
    "unlike qqcd , where the masses of quarks not connected to external sources are set to infinity , these `` sea quark '' masses are kept finite in pqqcd .",
    "the masses of the sea quarks can be varied independently of the valence quark masses ; usually they are chosen to be heavier . by keeping the sea quarks as dynamical degrees of freedom ,",
    "the fermion determinant is no longer equal to one and needs to be computed .",
    "however , by efficaciously giving the sea quarks larger masses it is much less costly to calculate .",
    "moreover , since pqqcd retains a @xmath5 anomaly , the equivalent to the singlet field in qcd is heavy ( on the order of the chiral symmetry breaking scale @xmath6 ) and can be integrated out  @xcite . as a consequence ,",
    "the low - energy constants appearing in partially quenched chiral perturbation theory ( )  @xcite , which is the low - energy effective theory of pqqcd , are the same as those appearing in . by fitting  to partially quenched lattice data",
    ", one can determine these constants and actually make physical predictions for qcd",
    ".  has been used recently to study heavy meson  @xcite and octet baryon observables  @xcite .",
    "the available lattice calculations for the @xmath3 transition  @xcite use the quenched approximation ; there are currently no partially quenched simulations .",
    "however , given the recent progress that lattice gauge theory has made in the one - hadron sector and the prospect of simulations in the two - hadron sector  @xcite , we expect to see partially quenched calculations of these form factors in the near future .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "first , in section  [ sec : pqcpt ] , we briefly review  including the treatment of the baryon octet and decuplet in the heavy baryon approximation  @xcite . since we will use the conventions used in our recent related work on the octet and decuplet baryons  @xcite we will keep this section brief . in section  [ sec : ff ] we calculate baryon decuplet to octet transition form factors in both  and up to next - to - leading ( nlo ) order in the chiral expansion and keep contributions to lowest order in the heavy baryon mass , @xmath7 .",
    "these calculations are done in the isospin limit of @xmath0 flavor .",
    "for completeness we also provide the   results for the transitions using the @xmath1 chiral lagrangian with non - degenerate quarks in the appendix . in section  [ sec :",
    "conclusions ] we conclude .",
    "in pqqcd the quark part of the lagrangian is written as  @xcite @xmath8 that differs from the qcd @xmath0 flavor lagrangian by the inclusion of three bosonic ghost quarks , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 , and three fermionic sea quarks , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 , in addition to the fermionic light valence quarks @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 .",
    "these nine quarks are in the fundamental representation of the graded group @xmath18  @xcite and have been accommodated in the nine - component vector @xmath19 that obeys the graded equal - time commutation relation @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are spin and @xmath23 and @xmath12 are flavor indices .",
    "the graded equal - time commutation relations for two @xmath24 s and two @xmath25 s can be written analogously .",
    "the grading factor @xmath26 takes into account the different statistics for fermionic and bosonic quarks .",
    "the quark mass matrix is given by @xmath27 so that diagrams with closed ghost quark loops cancel those with valence quarks .",
    "effects of virtual quark loops are , however , present due to the contribution of the finite - mass sea quarks .",
    "as has been recently realized  @xcite , the light quark electric charge matrix @xmath28 is not uniquely defined in pqqcd and the only constraint one imposes is for @xmath28 to have vanishing supertrace so that , as in qcd , no new operators involving the singlet component are introduced . following  @xcite we use @xmath29 qcd is recovered in the limit @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 independently of the @xmath33 s .    for massless quarks , the lagrangian in eq .",

    "finds that to lowest order the mesons with quark content @xmath51 are canonically normalized when their masses are given by @xmath52 .",
    "the flavor singlet field given by @xmath53 is , in contrast to the  case , rendered heavy by the @xmath5 anomaly and can therefore be integrated out in .",
    "analogously its mass @xmath54 can be taken to be on the order of the chiral symmetry breaking scale , @xmath55 . in this limit",
    "the flavor singlet propagator becomes independent of the coupling @xmath21 and deviates from a simple pole form  @xcite .",
