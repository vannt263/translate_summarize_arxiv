    "this project is part of a broader ongoing investigation into the use of methods from data analysis to identify the presence of structures and relations between the syntactic parameters of the world languages , considered either globally across all languages , or within specific language families and in comparative analysis between different families .",

    "this analysis shows that the indo - european family has a non - trivial persistent generator of the first homology , and two persistent generators of the zeroth homology ( persistent connected components ) , with substructures emerging at specific cluster filtering values .",
    "the niger - congo family , on the other hand , does not show presence of persistent first homology , and has one persistent connected component .",
    "we discuss the possible linguistic significance of persistent connected components and persistent generators of the first homology .",
    "we propose an interpretation of persistent components in terms of subfamilies , and we analyze different possible historical linguistic mechanisms that may give rise to non - trivial persistent first homology .",
    "we focus on the non - trivial persistent first homology generator in the indo - european family and we try to trace its origin in the structure of the phylogenetic network of indo - european languages .",
    "the first hypothesis we consider is the possibility that the non - trivial loop in the space of syntactic parameters may be a reflection of the presence of a non - trivial loop in the phylogenetic network , due to the historical ",
    "anglo - norman bridge \" connecting french to middle english , hence creating a non - trivial loop between the latin and the germanic subtrees .",

    "we show that it is also not coming from the indo - iranian branch .",

    "an important and fast developing area of data analysis , in recent years , has been the study of high dimensional structures in large sets of data points , via topological methods , see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "these methods of _ topological data analysis _ allow one to infer global features from discrete subsets of data as well as find commonalities of discrete sub - objects from a given continuous object .",

    "those homology generators that survive only over short intervals of @xmath12 radii are attributed to noise , while those that persist for longer intervals are considered to represent actual structure in the data set .",
    "when we analyze the persistent topology of different linguistic families ( see the detailed discussion of results in  [ toplingsec ] ) , we find different behaviors , in the number of persistent generators in both @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "as typically happens in many data sets , the generators for @xmath32 with @xmath33 behave too erratically to identify any meaningful structure beyond topological noise .    in general , the rank of the @xmath15-th homology group @xmath32 of a complex counts the  number of @xmath16-dimensional holes \" that can not be filled by an @xmath16-dimensional patch .",
    "in the topological analysis of a point cloud data set , the presence of a non - trivial generator of the @xmath32 at a given scale of the vietoris - rips complex implies the existence of a set of data points that is well described by an @xmath15-dimensional set of parameters , whose shape in the ambient space encloses an @xmath16-dimensional hole , which is not filled by other data in the same set . in this sense ,",
    "the presence of generators of persistent homology reveal the presence of structure in the data set .    in our case",
    ", the database provides a data point for each recorded world language ( or for each language within a given family ) , and the data points live in the space of syntactic parameters , or in a space of a more manageable lower dimension after performing principal component analysis . in this setting , the presence of an  @xmath16-dimensional hole \" in the data ( a generator of the persistent @xmath32 ) shows that ( part of ) the data cluster around an @xmath15-dimensional manifold that is not  filled in \" by other data points .",
    "possible coordinates on such @xmath15-dimensional structures represent relations among the syntactic parameters , over certain linguistic ( sub)families .",
    "since the only persistent generators we encountered are in the @xmath30 and @xmath31 , we discuss more in detail their respective meanings .      the rank of the persistent @xmath30 counts the number of connected components of the vietoris - rips complex .",
    "it reveals the presence of clusters of data , within which data are closer to each other ( in the range of scales considered for the vietoris - rips complex ) than to any point in any other component .",
    "thus , a language family exhibiting more than one persistent generator of @xmath30 has linguistic parameters that naturally group together into different subfamilies .",
    "it is not known , at this stage of the analysis , whether in such cases the subsets of languages that belong to the same connected component correspond to historical linguistic subfamilies or whether they cut across them .",
    "we will give some evidence , in the case of the indo - european family , in favor of matching persistent generators of the @xmath30 to major historical linguistic sub - families within the same family .",
    "certainly , in all cases , the connected components identified by different generators of the persistent @xmath30 can be used to define a grouping into subfamilies , whose relation to historical linguistics remains to be investigated .",
    "the presence of an @xmath31-generators also means that part of the data ( corresponding to one of the components of the vietoris - rips complex ) clusters around a one - dimensional closed curve .",
    "more precisely , one can identify the first homology group @xmath34 of a space with the group of homotopy classes @xmath35 $ ] of ( basepoint preserving ) maps @xmath36 to the circle .",
    "this means that , if there is a non - trivial generator of the persistent @xmath31 , then there is a choice of a circle coordinate that best describes that part of the data .",
    "the freedom to change the map up to homotopy makes it possible to look for a smoothing of the circle coordinate .",
    "it is not obvious how to interpret these circles from the linguistic point of view .",
    "the fact that a generator of the @xmath31 represents a @xmath37-dimensional hole means that , given the data that cluster along this circle , no further data point determine a @xmath37-dimensional surface interpolating across the circle . as the topological structures we are investigating stem from a vietoris - rips complex that measures proximity between syntactic parameters of different languages , we can propose a heuristic interpretation for the presence of such circles as the case of a ( sub)family of languages where each language in the subfamily has other  neighboring \" languages with sufficiently similar syntactic parameters , so that one can go around the whole subfamily via changes of syntactic parameters described by a single circle coordinate , while parameter changes that move along two - dimensional manifolds and interpolate between data points on the circle can not be performed while remain within the same ( sub)family",
    ".    two different possible models of how a non - trivial generator of the persistent first homology can arise point to different possible explanations in historical - linguistic terms .    ,",
    "title=\"fig : \" ]     as shown in figure [ biffig ] , the first model is a typical hopf bifurcation picture , where a circle arises from a point ( with the horizontal direction as time coordinate ) .",
    "this model would be compatible with a phylogenetic network of the corresponding language family that is a tree , where one of the nodes generates a set of daughter nodes whose points in the parameter space contain a nontrivial loop .",
    "the second possibility is of a line closing up into a circle .",
    "this may arise in the case of a language family whose phylogenetic network is not a tree , but it contains itself a loop that closes off two previously distant branches .",
    "there are well known cases where the phylogenetic network of a language family is not necessarily best described by a tree .",
    "the most famous case is probably the anglo - norman bridge in the phylogenetic  tree \" of the indo - european languages , see figure [ ietreefig ] .",
    "however , it is important to point out that the presence of a loop in the phylogenetic network of a language family does not imply that this loop will leave a trace in the syntactic parameters , in the form of a non - trivial first persistent homology .",
    "conversely , the presence of persistent first homology , by itself , is no guarantee that loops may be present in the phylogenetic network , for example due to possibilities like the hopf bifurcation picture described above .",
    "thus , one can not infer directly from the presence or absence of a persistent @xmath31 conclusions about the topology of the historical phylogenetic network .",
    "the only conclusion of this sort that can be drawn is that a persistent @xmath31 suggests a phylogenetic loop as one of the possible causes .",
    "conversely , one can read the absence of non - trivial persistent first homology as a suggestion ( but not an implication ) of the fact that the phylogenetic network may be a tree and that phenomena like the anglo - norman bridge did not occur in the historical development of that family .",
    "we will discuss this point more in detail in the case of the indo - european language family .",
    "this is a very good example , which shows how the possible correlation between loops in the space of syntactic parameters and in the phylogenetic network is by no means an implication .",
    "indeed , the indo - european language family contains both a known loop in the phylogenetic network , due to the anglo - norman bridge ( see figure [ ietreefig ] ) , and a non - trivial generator of the persistent @xmath31",

    "we analyze some historical - linguistic hypotheses in the following subsection .",

    "it is well known that the influx of french was extensive at the lexical level , but it is not clear whether one should expect to see a trace of this historical phenomenon when analyzing languages at the level of syntactic structures .",
    "it is , however , a natural question to ask whether the non - trivial loop one sees in the persistent topology of syntactic parameters of the indo - european family may perhaps be a syntactic remnant of the anglo - norman bridge .",

    "it is much less extensively mapped in sswl than the rest of the indo - european family , with only 9 languages recorded in the database .",

    "figure [ nc1fig ] shows the barcode diagrams for persistent homology at index values @xmath57 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 , which can be compared with the diagrams of figure [ ie1fig ] for the indo - european family . in the niger - congo family , we now see persistent @xmath30 homology , respectively , of ranks @xmath58 , @xmath59 , and @xmath58 ( compare with ranks @xmath37 , @xmath59 , @xmath37 in the indo - european case ) . a lower rank in the @xmath30",

    "following the cluster analysis of  [ clustersec ] , we also considered the persistent homology for the niger - congo family at specific cluster filtering values . while for cluster filtering value @xmath50 and indices @xmath52 one sees one persistent generator of @xmath30 and a possibility of a persistent generator in the @xmath31 , cluster filtering value @xmath50 with indices @xmath46 , as well as cluster filtering value @xmath51 with indices @xmath53 and @xmath54",

    "we showed that methods from topological data analysis , in particular persistent homology , can be used to analyze how syntactic parameters are distributed over different language families . in particular",
    "we compared the cases of indo - european and niger - congo languages .      1 .   to what extent do persistent generators of the @xmath30 ( that is , the persistent connected components ) of the data space of syntactic parameter correspond to different ( sub)families of languages in the historical linguistic sense ?",
    "for example , are the three @xmath30 generators visible at scale @xmath46 in the congo - niger family a remnant of the historical subdivision into the mande , atlantic - congo , and kordofanian subfamilies ? 2 .",
    "what is the meaning , in historical linguistic terms , of the circle components ( persistent generators of @xmath31 ) in the data space of syntactic parameters of language families ?",
    "is there a historical - linguistic interpretation for the second @xmath31 generator one sees at cluster filtering value 165 and scale @xmath42 in the indo - european family ? or for the @xmath31 generator one sees with the same cluster filtering , at scale @xmath52 in the niger - congo case ? 3 .",
