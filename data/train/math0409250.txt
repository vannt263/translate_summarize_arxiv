    "a _ coordinatization theorem _ is a statement that expresses a class of geometric objects in algebraic terms .",

    "the classical coordinatization theorem of arguesian affine planes ( as , for example , presented in e. artin ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapitre  ii ) ) was extended over the last century to a huge work on modular lattices , which also brought surprising and deep connections with coordinatization results in universal algebra , see the survey paper by c. herrmann @xcite .",
    "we cite the following milestone , due to j. von  neumann  @xcite .",

    "we refer the reader to sections  [ s : basiclatt][s : basicmodules ] for precise definitions .",
    "we observe that while the statement that a lattice is coordinatizable is , apparently , `` complicated '' ( it begins with an existential quantifier over regular rings ) , von  neumann s sufficient condition is logically simple  for example , having a spanning homogeneous sequence with four elements is a first - order condition .",
    "the strongest known extension of von  neumann s coordinatization theorem is due to b.  jnsson @xcite . for further coordinatization results of modular lattices ,",
