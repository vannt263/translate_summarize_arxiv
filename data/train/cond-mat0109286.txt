    "although experimental data on plastic crystals @xcite have demonstrated that orientational degrees of freedom by themselves show glasslike dynamics and even can undergo a glass transition their role for the dynamics and the glass formation of supercooled liquids has not been studied in great detail . with the extension of mode - coupling theory ( mct ) from simple liquids @xcite to molecular systems",
    "@xcite there is a _ microscopic _ theory which allows to investigate the role of the rotational degrees of freedom and their coupling to the translational ones .",
    "it is desirable to choose systems for which this coupling can be varied systematically . from this point of view",
    "hard ellipsoids of revolution represent an interesting model system . keeping their minor axis @xmath8 fixed , a change of the aspect ratio @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the major axis , will change the steric hindrance between the ellipsoids .",
    "this again will result in a change of the translational - rotational coupling .",
    "applying mct to hard ellipsoids it was shown that for @xmath1 about two or larger the ellipsoids freeze into a glass at a critical volume fraction @xmath11 due to the appearance of a medium range orientational order which originates from a precursor of a nematic order @xcite .",
    "recently we have shown that this precursor of nematic order also has an influence onto the dynamical features in the microscopic time and frequency regime @xcite . from both , the solution of the corresponding mct - equations and from a md - simulation a peak in the compressibility spectrum has been found at @xmath12 about one decade below a high - frequency peak ( hf - peak ) .",
    "the additional peak clearly has an orientational origin since @xmath12 scales with @xmath13 , @xmath14 being the moment of inertia with respect to the minor axis .",
    "therefore we called it an orientational peak @xmath15 .",
    "these calculations were restricted to a single aspect ratio , @xmath16 , and one volume fraction , only .",
    "it is the motivation of the present contribution to study the microscopic dynamics and in particular the @xmath17 as a function of @xmath1 and @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the number density . in this respect",
    "we would also like to mention that studying the _ athermal _ system of hard ellipsoids can also be instructive for real molecular liquids composed of linear molecules like e. g. diatomic molecules .",
    "indeed , it has been demonstrated that the static correlators @xmath20 and the non - ergodicity parameters @xmath21 for diatomic molecules with lennard - jones interactions obtained from a md - simulation @xcite can be well reproduced by a system of hard ellipsoids with @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "note that this aspect ratio was not the result of fitting procedure , but could be determined from the lennard - jones parameters .    besides hard ellipsoids mct has already been applied to study the dynamics of a dumbbell - molecule in an isotropic liquid of hard spheres @xcite , @xcite and of a liquid of dipolar hard spheres @xcite .",
    "like for hard ellipsoids , the change of the elongation @xmath23 of the dumbbell allows to vary the steric hindrance with the hard sphere environment .",
    "this effect has been investigated quantitatively for the orientational correlators @xmath24 where @xmath25",
    "are the legendre polynomials and @xmath26 is the unit vector pointing along the symmetry axis of the dumbbell at time @xmath27 .",
    "it has been found that weak and strong steric hindrance can lead to quite different relaxational behavior .",
    "for instance , in case of sufficiently small elongations the @xmath28-relaxation scaling law is strongly disturbed .",
    "the correlator with odd-@xmath29 and even-@xmath30 behave different .",
    "it is interesting that this finding agrees with that found from a md - simulation of a diatomic lennard - jones liquid .",
    "@xcite .    for dipolar hard spheres",
    "it is the dipolar interaction which is responsible for a translational - rotational - coupling .",
    "this type of coupling is different to that generated by steric hindrance .",
    "nevertheless , we have also found in the compressibility spectrum an @xmath17 about a decade below a hf - peak @xcite .",
    "this may suggest that an @xmath17 can be a rather general feature of a molecular liquid .",
    "this motivates to study for hard ellipsoids the microscopic dynamics as a function of the aspect ratio and volume fraction .",
    "the organization of our paper is as follows . in the next section",
    "we will introduce the basic quantities and their equations of motion .",
    "the results from a numerical solution of these equations will be presented and discussed in section iii and in section iv we will summarize and will give some conclusions .",
    "we consider a system of @xmath31 hard ellipsoids of revolution with mass @xmath32 and moment of inertia @xmath33 with respect to the minor axis .",
    "@xmath9 is the aspect ratio , i.e. the ratio of the major and minor axis .",
    "the length and time unit is chosen such that @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "the microscopic configurations are given by the center of mass position @xmath36 and the set of euler angles @xmath37 , @xmath38 . because of the rotational invariance around the symmetry axis of the ellipsoids of revolution the third euler angle @xmath39 is not involved in the steric hindrance .",
    "consequently this degree of freedom will not be taken into account . then , the basic quantities for the study of the molecular dynamics are the _ tensorial _ density correlators    @xmath40    where @xmath41 is the microscopic tensorial density determined by @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "@xmath44 and @xmath45 specify the rotational part of the density modes . for completeness",
    "we mention that the dynamics of molecular liquids can also be described by a site - site formalism @xcite .",
    "however , hard ellipsoids are not made up for a finite number of sites .",
    "hence one has to approximate a hard ellipsoid by , e. g. a two - site dumbbell where each site is the center of a sphere as it was used in refs .",

    "the liquid phase is below the solid line and bounded by the thick part of the dashed line .",
    "the remaining part corresponds to the glassy phase .",
    "this diagram contains two glass transition lines which cross at @xmath124 .",
    "this crossing relates to a change of the mechanism for the glass transition .",
    "for @xmath125 it is the cage effect which mainly leads to a freezing into a glass whereas for @xmath126 a precursor of a nematic order becomes responsible for the glass transition @xcite .",
    "note , that this change at @xmath127 does not happen suddenly but it is a crossover phenomenon . therefore the numerical value @xmath128 should not be over - interpreted .",
    "the correlators @xmath53 for @xmath113 and @xmath129 were calculated from eqs .",
    "( [ eq4 ] ) and  ( [ eq8 ] ) for the points shown in figure [ fig1 ] . from these results",
    "we have determined the correlation spectra @xmath130 and the susceptibility @xmath131 .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] presents the compressibility spectrum for @xmath132 and pairs of @xmath133 on the liquid side , but close to the glass transition line ( full symbols in figure [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "here we include @xmath16 for which the static correlators were obtained from a md - simulation @xcite .",
    "we have chosen double - logarithmic scales on which the characteristic features become more prominent . for hard spheres ,",
    "i.e. @xmath80 , only one peak , which we called the high frequency peak ( hf - peak ) , exists at @xmath134 for @xmath135 .",
    "now , making @xmath1 larger than one , we observe an additional peak at @xmath12 about one decade below the hf - peak .",
    "this peak is what we called the orientational peak @xmath15 in the first section .",
    "it already appears for @xmath136 , the smallest value we have chosen besides @xmath80 . with increasing aspect ratio , up to our maximum value @xmath137 , the position of the @xmath17 almost does not change whereas @xmath138 first increases and then decreases .",
    "the most striking features are ( i ) the @xmath17 becomes broader and ( ii ) the ratio of the height of the @xmath17 and the hf - peak increases with increasing @xmath1 .",
    "this behavior can be understood as follows .",
    "increasing @xmath1 enhances the steric hindrance which leads to a stronger translational - rotational - coupling .",
    "therefore the orientational motion which is an almost free rotation with a single frequency for @xmath1 close to one couples stronger and stronger to the translational motion which enters into the compressibility .",
    "this leads to a more hindered rotational motion involving a broader band of rotational frequencies such that the @xmath17 becomes broader and it leads to an enhancement of the orientational contribution at @xmath12 relative to the translational one at @xmath134 .",
    "since @xmath134 does not change with @xmath14 @xcite it must be related to the translational motion .",
    "the fact that a distinct `` fingerprint '' of the orientational dynamics can be observed in the compressibility spectrum already for @xmath136 might be surprising .",
    "but figure [ fig3 ] supplies an explanation .",
    "there we show @xmath139 ( 4.2 , @xmath140 ) and @xmath141 ( 4.2 , @xmath140 ) on linear scales , for the volume fractions marked in figure [ fig1 ] for @xmath136 . because these quantities for @xmath142 and @xmath143 strongly resemble that for @xmath144 we only show data for @xmath145 and @xmath146 .",
    "@xmath147 @xmath148 and @xmath149 @xmath150 exhibit one rather sharp peak at @xmath151 .",
    "for @xmath80 it follows from eq .",
    "( [ eq9 ] ) with eq .",
    "( [ eq10 ] ) that @xmath152 for @xmath153 . using this , @xmath154 and @xmath155 ( for @xmath80 ) we get from eq .",
    "( [ eq17 ] ) the frequency @xmath156 for a free rotation of a sphere with @xmath157 .",
    "therefore it is obvious that the peak in @xmath147 and @xmath149 at @xmath158 comes from an almost free rotation",
    ". if the rotation is _ completely _ free then @xmath159 and @xmath160 are proportional to @xmath161 .",
    "although the coupling of the rotational motion into @xmath162 is very small for @xmath163 it is the almost @xmath164-like behavior of @xmath159 and @xmath160 which can contribute significantly to @xmath2 and @xmath165 .",
    "this contribution is more apparent for @xmath162 than for @xmath166 , as can be seen from figure [ fig3 ] .",
    "whereas the @xmath17 at @xmath167 occurs in @xmath162 for all studied volume fractions it only becomes present in @xmath166 closer to the glass transition .",
    "the fact that @xmath168 supports the rotational origin of the @xmath17 .",
    "two more features follow .",
    "first , the spectra for @xmath169 depend sensitively on @xmath0 whereas those for @xmath144 almost do not change , and second @xmath12 is practically constant in contrast to the position @xmath134 of the hf - peak which moves towards higher frequencies with increasing @xmath0 .",
    "the latter observation implies that with increasing @xmath0 the glass becomes more stiff with respect to the translational than for the rotational dynamics , provided @xmath1 is close to one .",
    "now let us consider the results for the largest value for @xmath1 we have studied .",
    "figure [ fig4 ] presents the spectra ( again on linear scales ) for @xmath137 and the volume fractions indicated in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "the glass translation occurs at @xmath170 .",
    "comparison of figure [ fig4 ] with figure [ fig3 ] shows that all the spectra have become more structured and broader due to the increase of @xmath1 .",
    "the rather narrow peak in @xmath147 @xmath148 and @xmath149 @xmath148 at @xmath171 for @xmath136 has almost disappeared .",
    "it occurs as a shoulder in @xmath147 and as a peak in @xmath149 deeper in the glass .",
    "its shape and intensity depends on @xmath0 .",
    "a well pronounced peak also occurs in @xmath147 and @xmath149 at @xmath172 between @xmath173 and @xmath174 , depending on @xmath0 .",
    "this peak is present in the liquid @xmath175 and the glass @xmath176 .",
    "these two peaks have their counterparts in @xmath162 and @xmath166 at @xmath177 and @xmath178 , although the peak in @xmath162 at @xmath179 becomes more pronounced deeper in the glass , and has a shoulder - like behavior for @xmath166 , only . besides these two peaks a hf - peak exists above @xmath174 , for all volume fractions .",
    "we have checked the dependence of these peak positions on the moment of inertia @xmath14 and have found that only @xmath168 shifts with @xmath14 .",
    "therefore the peak at @xmath168 , which is much less pronounced then for @xmath136 is the orientational peak .",
    "the origin of the intermediate peak will be elucidated below .",
    "it is also interesting to study the @xmath47-dependence of the spectra .",
    "this has been done for an intermediate aspect ratio @xmath22 and @xmath180 , i.e. deep in the glass ( cf .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the result is depicted in figure [ fig5 ] for @xmath181 and @xmath182 .",
    "the @xmath47-dependence of @xmath183 is quite similar .",
    "even more pronounced than for @xmath137 we observe two peaks in @xmath149 at @xmath184 and at @xmath185 .",
    "again , these two peaks have their counterpart in @xmath165 at @xmath12 and @xmath172 .",
    "in addition there is a hf - peak at @xmath134 .",
    "the dispersion of these peak positions depends on @xmath29 .",
    "@xmath12 is practically @xmath47-independent whereas @xmath186 exhibits some @xmath47-dependence , and the position of the intermediate and the hf - peak shows dispersion for @xmath187 and @xmath188 .    to understand the existence and the @xmath47-dependence of these peaks at least qualitatively we have calculated for @xmath189 and @xmath190 the eigenfrequencies @xmath191 of the @xmath192 matrix @xmath193 , @xmath194 , @xmath195 and the `` renormalized '' frequencies @xmath196 , @xmath197 and @xmath198 which are the eigenfrequencies of the @xmath199 matrix @xmath200 ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . since @xmath201 for @xmath29 and/or @xmath56 equal to zero",
    ", @xmath202 is indeed a @xmath199 matrix for @xmath203 .",
    "the results for @xmath204 and @xmath205 are given in figure [ fig6]a and [ fig6]b , respectively . figure [ fig6]b also contains @xmath206 , @xmath207 and @xmath208 determined from @xmath209 for @xmath22 and @xmath180 , i.e. deep in the glass .",
    "since @xmath210 can not be distinguished from @xmath211 there are practically three branches in figure [ fig6]a . because @xmath212 for @xmath213 it is the longitudinal acoustic branch , whereas the others are optic - like .",
    "these optic - like behavior also appears for the `` renormalized '' frequencies @xmath214 and @xmath215 which seem to reproduce at least qualitatively the results for @xmath216 and @xmath217 .",
    "the same holds for @xmath218 which is in phase with @xmath219 where @xmath219 is the `` renormalized '' bare frequency @xmath220 .",
    "unfortunately , our results for @xmath221 become less accurate for small @xmath47 . for",
    "an expalantion see ref .",
    "therefore we can not definitely determine the dispersion for @xmath222 .",
    "the intermediate peak only appears deep in the glass . in that case",
    "the nondiagonal static correlator @xmath223 becomes large .",
    "therefore we believe that the origin of that peak comes from the additional coupling between the modes with @xmath224 and @xmath188 which already exists on the linear level ( see discussion at the end of section 2 ) .",
    "we have calculated the dynamics of a system of hard ellipsoids as a function of the volume fraction @xmath0 and the aspect ratio @xmath1 . in the spectra for the center of mass dynamics",
    "we have found an orientational peak at @xmath12 , roughly one decade below a high - frequency peak . due to its shift with the moment of inertia and its appearance in the spectra of the `` quadrupolar '' motions ( quantities with @xmath225 ) its origin is mainly of orientational nature .",
    "this peak becomes broader and its intensity relative to the intensity of the hf - peak increases with increasing @xmath226 , i.e. with the increase of the steric hindrance .",
    "its position is practically q - independent and it scales with @xmath13 .",
    "this implies that it originates mainly from localized modes with @xmath227 , as already found in refs . @xcite and @xcite . for the dipolar hard sphere system studied in ref .",
    "@xcite it has also been speculated that this orientational peak could be one of several contributions to the _ boson peak_. since hard ellipsoids are an athermal system we can not draw such a conclusion here .",
    "however , the appearance of the @xmath17 for all aspect ratios we have studied together with its existence for dipolar hard spheres may give a hint that it may occur in many molecular liquids . that it is not an artefact of the approximate character of the used equations of motions has clearly been demonstrated by the md - simulation @xcite .",
    "it is also interesting for @xmath1 close to one that a variation of @xmath0 almost does not affect the spectra for @xmath228 , in contrast to those for @xmath229 .",
    "there is a significant influence of the rotational motion on @xmath230 and @xmath231 but much less feedback from the translational motion to @xmath232 and @xmath233 for weak steric hindrance .",
    "finally , deep in the glass we have found an intermediate peak between the @xmath17 and hf - peak .",
    "this peak did not appear for dipolar hard spheres where the static correlators were taken diagonal in @xmath29 and @xmath56 .",
    "since this is not the case for the system of hard ellipsoids we believe that the intermediate peak turns up due to a coupling between modes with @xmath224 and @xmath7 mediated by the nondiagonal elements of @xmath234 .",
    "the q - dependence of the orientational , intermediate and the hf - peak in the compressibility spectrum can be described by the `` renormalized '' eigenfrequencies , at least on a qualitative level .    * acknowledgement *",

    "<S> this orientational peak is the counterpart of a peak appearing in the quadrupolar spectra @xmath4 and @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> the latter peak is almost insensitive on @xmath0 for @xmath1 close to one , i.e. for weak steric hindrance , and broadens strongly with increasing @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> deep in the glass we find an additional peak between the orientational and the high frequency peak . </S>",
    "<S> we have evidence that this intermediate peak is the result of a coupling between modes with @xmath6 and @xmath7 , due to the nondiagonality of the static correlators . </S>"
