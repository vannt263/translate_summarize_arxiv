    "fu  orionis - type objects ( fuors ) constitute a small group of young stars characterized by large optical - infrared outbursts , attributed to highly enhanced accretion @xcite . during these outbursts , accretion rates from the circumstellar disk to the star are in the order of 10@xmath2m@xmath3/yr , three orders of magnitude higher than in quiescence or in normal t  tauri stars .",
    "fuors are natural laboratories where not only enhanced accretion but enhanced mass loss can be studied .",
    "most fuors have optical jets , molecular outflows , and optically visible ring - like structures on a 0.1pc scale that , in some cases , might be connected to expanding shells thrown off during previous outbursts @xcite .",
    "circumstellar envelopes are supposed to play a significant role in the outbursts of fuors , partly by replenishing the disk material after each outburst @xcite , partly by triggering the eruptions @xcite .",
    "for this reason , envelopes are not static , but evolve with time . based on the appearance of the 10@xmath4 m silicate feature , @xcite defined two categories of fuors : objects showing the feature in absorption are younger , still embedded in a circumstellar envelope ; objects showing the silicate band in emission are more evolved , with direct view on the surface layer of the accretion disk .",
    "a similar evolutionary sequence was outlined by @xcite based on the amount of far - infrared excess .",
    "these studies suggest that fuors represent a fundamentally important transition period during early star formation when the embedded protostar clears away its enshrouding envelope to become a class ii ttauri star @xcite .",
    "traditionally , a large part of our knowledge on fuor envelopes comes from modeling broad - band spectral energy distributions of the dust emission , based on spatially unresolved photometric data mainly at infrared and submillimeter wavelengths .",
    "the gas component , however , is typically much less studied . with the goal to obtain a general picture of the molecular gas content , we perform a comprehensive and homogeneous survey of all known fuors , by measuring millimeter co lines using single dish telescopes . in this paper",
    "we present observations of the envelopes of eight southern and equatorial fuors , and study the distribution and kinematics of the circumstellar gas , including the characterization of the molecular outflows where detected .",
    "our data reveal the large variety and trends in the envelope structures predicted by the evolutionary models .",

    "the outflow masses , momenta , and energies of the fuors fall into the upper 30% compared to the distribution of these values measured by @xcite for a sample of 28 outflows driven by low - mass protostars . the outflow of v346  nor was already detected by @xcite in @xmath0co(32 ) and by @xcite in the @xmath0co(10 ) , revealing a similar morphology of the outflowing gas as our data .",

    "envelopes with higher mass exhibit broader lines , while the low - mass envelopes have narrower lines or remain undetected towards the source .",
    "temperatures calculated from the ratio of the @xmath0co(43 ) and @xmath0co(32 ) line ratios show that the low - mass envelopes are typically cold ( 5 - 7k ) , while the higher - mass envelopes are warm ( @xmath2340k ) .",
    "outflows are only detected from sources with higher - mass envelopes . by observing a large sample of low - mass protostars",
    ", @xcite found that the envelope mass decreases sharply from typically 1@xmath24 in class0 objects to @xmath25 in the classi phase . placing our targets into this evolutionary scheme ,",
    "fuors with higher envelope masses represent a very early evolutionary phase .",
    "the fuors with low envelope masses or upper limits may be close to the end of the classi phase .    as we summarized in the introducion , @xcite proposed a different way to order fuors into an evolutionary sequence : objects showing silicate absorption at 10@xmath4 m are younger , still embedded in their opaque envelopes , while those showing silicate emission are more evolved .",
    "we checked the cornell atlas of spitzer / irs sources for mid - infrared spectra , and found that hbh  494 , haro  5a  irs , oo  ser , and v346  nor have silicate absorption feature , while bran  76 , hbc  687 , and v900  mon exhibit emission ( see also tab .  [",
    "tab : results ] ) .",
    "our division based on the co gas properties of our targets correlates well with the division based on the 10@xmath4 m silicate feature .",
    "objects possessing massive gas envelopes exhibit silicate absorption , while those with lower - mass envelopes show silicate emission ( tab .",
    "[ tab : results ] ) .",
    "this conclusion suggests a parallel evolution of the circumstellar dust and gas in fuors .",
    "when young stellar objects transition from the embedded to the disk - only phase , they clear away their envelopes to become an optically visible star . according to the hypothesis of @xcite , repetitive fuor outbursts may drive this process , since a thick obscuring envelope produces an absorption feature , while for an emission feature , large opening angle for the polar cavity in the envelope is needed to provide a clear line - of - sight to the inner disk ( see also @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "fuor outbursts gradually widen the outflow cavity due to the enhanced outflow activity during the eruptions .    during a typical fuor outburst 0.01@xmath26 mass",
    "is accreted onto the central star @xcite .",
    "depending on the length of the quiescent periods , a similar amount of material may be accreted between the outbursts .",
    "this is comparable to the envelope mass found in our more evolved subsample .",
    "the mass reservoir in these systems to replenish the disk after an outburst is very small .",
    "therefore , these objects are probably very close to the transition to the disk - only phase and may represent the links between the classi and classii phases of protostellar evolution .",
