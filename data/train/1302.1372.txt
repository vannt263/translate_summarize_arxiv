    "shot noise is often used as a tool for characterizing the magnitude of energy relaxation for example due to electron - phonon scattering in small electron systems ( for a recent example , see ref .  ) .",
    "this method relies on the fact that the noise power @xmath4 , defined as the fourier transform of the current - current correlator , through a given conductor is quite generally proportional to the average of the electron temperature in this sample .",
    "biasing the system with a voltage @xmath5 induces joule heating , and the static electron temperature follows from a balance between this heating and the energy relaxation out of the system . this way the strength of energy relaxation can be read off from the noise .    at low temperatures in metals",
    "the main energy relaxation mechanism is due to the direct diffusion of electrons to the electrodes .",
    "this heat conduction is typically characterized by the wiedemann - franz ( wf ) law,@xcite according to which the heat conductivity @xmath6 is directly proportional to the charge conductivity @xmath7 and the local electron temperature @xmath8 .",
    "the proportionality factor @xmath9 is known as the lorenz number . in the limit of a large voltage compared to the temperature @xmath10 of the electrodes , @xmath11",
    ", the wf law results into shot noise which is proportional to the average current @xmath12 , with a universal fano factor @xmath13.@xcite this fano factor is independent of the sample geometry and applies even in the presence of a non - uniform electron conductivity or a non - uniform cross - section of the sample .",
    "the only requirements are the validity of the wf law and the quasiequilibrium limit,@xcite where the electron  electron scattering is strong enough , so that the electron distribution function can everywhere be described via a fermi - dirac distribution function with a well - defined position - dependent electron temperature .",
    "this value has been demonstrated experimentally@xcite more than a decade ago and it is now well - established .",
    "are connected to each other via a normal - metal spacer of length @xmath14 and to electrodes held at different potentials @xmath15 and @xmath16 and at a temperature @xmath17 . ]    recently a lot of interest has been devoted to the problem of heat transfer in magnetic systems.@xcite one of the key findings is that as internal energy relaxation of the electrons couples the energies in the two spin systems without relaxing their charges , the wf law breaks down.@xcite in this paper we show how the breakdown of the wf law leads to a shot noise with a fano factor deviating from the universal value in these devices .",
    "in particular , we find that in a spin valve with antiparallel orientation of magnetizations ( fig .",
    "[ fig : system ] ) , the fano factor is strongly suppressed implying an almost noiseless transmission of current through the device .",
    "this is counterintuitive , as the antiparallel magnetization orientation can be envisaged as a reduced overall transmission of electrons through the spin valve  compared to the parallel orientation  and typically such a reduction of transmission leads to an increased fano factor rather than a reduced one.@xcite this behavior also sharply contrasts with the results for spin valves with spin - flip scattering in the paramagnetic metal,@xcite where the maximum fano factor corresponds to the maximum resistance .    .",
    "as the higher temperature corresponds to the lower conductance , the would - be temperature profiles are highly asymmetric , and switching on the interaction results in a heat exchange whose direction is shown by orange arrows . ]    if there were no spin - flip and electron - electron scattering , a diffusive spin valve could be considered as two isolated parallel conducting channels with spin - up and spin - down electrons connecting the same reservoirs .",
    "each channel would separately give a fano factor @xmath18 , yielding the same overall fano factor characteristic of diffusive wires out of equilibrium .",
    "this value would be independent of electrode magnetizations or the details of the sample.@xcite    if each spin subsystem were in local equilibrium but there were no heat exchange between electrons with opposite spins , this quantity would change to @xmath0 and remain sample - independent because of the direct proportionality between the electric and heat conductivities .",
    "however if the heat exchange between spin subsystems is switched on , it results in a heat transfer between the channels , which is not accompanied by any charge transfer and hence may violate the wiedemann - franz law .",
    "this increases the effective @xmath19 ratio and decreases the fano factor below @xmath0 .    in the case of parallel magnetizations of the electrodes and a vanishing normal region ,",
    "the spatial dependence of the electron temperature in both spin - up and spin - down channels would have the same symmetric shape and therefore would not be affected by heat exchange between the channels .",
    "however in the case of antiparallel magnetization , the distribution of temperature in thermally isolated channels would be strongly asymmetric ( see fig.[fig : isolated ] ) .",
    "the regions where the electrons with given spin direction are minority carriers would have a much lower conductivity and a much higher temperature than the ones where they are in the majority .",
    "therefore it is the minority - carrier regions that would be the dominant sources of noise . as the heat exchange between the spin subsystems",
    "is switched on , the hotter minority - carrier regions appear to be in direct thermal contact with much colder majority carriers in the opposite - spin channel . as the majority carriers have much larger electric and thermal conductivity , they represent almost perfect heat sinks for the minority carriers and strongly suppress their effective temperature together with the fano factor .",
    "we describe the ferromagnet  normal - metal  ferromagnet ( fnf ) system shown schematically in fig .  [",
    "fig : system ] , where the ferromagnets of equal length @xmath20 are connected to a normal - metal spacer with length @xmath14 and conductivity @xmath21 . for simplicity we only consider the collinear orientation of magnetizations . in the case of parallel magnetizations ,",
    "the majority ( minority ) spin `` up '' ( `` down '' ) electrons in both electrodes have conductivity @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) with @xmath24 , whereas in the case of antiparallel magnetization orientation the conductivities of the spin - up and spin - down channels are interchanged in the right ferromagnet .",
    "an alternative way to describe the spin - dependent conductivities is to define the average conductivity @xmath25 and spin polarization @xmath26 .    in the diffusive limit ,",
    "where all length scales in the problem are large compared to the elastic mean free path @xmath27 , the electron distribution function @xmath28 for spin @xmath29 electrons satisfies @xcite @xmath30+i_{\\rm e - ph}^s[f_s , n_{\\rm ph } ] , \\label{eq : boltzmann}\\ ] ] where @xmath31 is the diffusion constant for spin @xmath32 , @xmath33 denotes the spin opposite to @xmath32 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the collision integrals for electron  electron ( e - e ) and electron  phonon scattering . in what follows ,",
    "we concentrate on low temperatures where the latter can be disregarded.@xcite the role of e - e scattering is to equilibrate the electron system into a common local temperature without any transfer of electron energy to non - electronic excitations . however , whereas in the absence of spin - flip scattering the spin - dependent potentials are unaffected by e - e scattering , the energies of the two spin ensembles are coupled@xcite and therefore in the limit of strong e - e scattering spin - up and spin - down electrons can be described with the same temperature @xmath36 .    in the quasiequilibrium limit the distribution hence reads @xmath37 , where @xmath38 + 1\\}^{-1}$ ] is the fermi function .",

    "for @xmath63 the normal metal dominates the resistance , and the fano factor tends to the value @xmath64 . in the opposite limit @xmath65 a symmetric spin valve does not maintain any spin accumulation , and the same fano factor @xmath0 is retained . ]",
    "in the absence of spin heat accumulation , the validity of the wiedemann - franz law depends on the presence or absence of spin accumulation . the latter vanishes if @xmath66 , i.e. , @xmath67 , and both in the limit where majority of the resistance comes from the normal - metal spacer , i.e. , @xmath68 or in the opposite limit @xmath69 . in the latter case the absence of spin accumulation results from the symmetry of the setup .",
    "the temperature distributions in the thermally uncoupled spin - up and spin - down channels would be identical and therefore would not be affected by the heat exchange . in those limits we hence obtain the universal result @xmath70 for the fano factor .",
    "the intermediate case is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : parallelfano ] .",
    "we find that @xmath71 obtains a minimum when @xmath72 and this minimum becomes wider and deeper as the polarization increases . for @xmath73",

    "the minimal value @xmath77 is obtained at @xmath78 .",
    "note that this limit requires quite a strong polarization of the ferromagnets ( see fig .",

    "in the antiparallel configuration of the magnetizations , the spin accumulation is non - zero even in the case of a negligible resistance of the normal - metal spacer ( i.e. , @xmath69 ) . in this case @xmath79 the shot noise power is therefore suppressed by inter - spin relaxation due to e - e scattering .",
    "the quasiequilibrium fano factor tends below the nonequilibrium limit @xmath80 when @xmath81 and the shot noise ( almost ) vanishes in the half - metal limit @xmath82 ( note that also the average current vanishes there , but the noise vanishes faster ) .",
    "the reason is that the distribution of temperature in the case of a thermally uncoupled spin - up and spin - down channels would be strongly asymmetric in this case .",
    "the electron - electron scattering balances these temperatures , resulting in a strongly suppressed average temperature together with a suppressed fano factor .    .",
    "note the log - scale in the horizontal axis .",
    "for @xmath83 the normal metal dominates the resistance , and the fano factor tends to @xmath0 . in the opposite limit @xmath65 the fano factor tends to @xmath84 given by eq .",

    "let us now estimate the parameter regime where our discussion is valid .",
    "we have assumed that the length @xmath90 is shorter than the spin diffusion length .",
    "spin - flip scattering would suppress the spin accumulation , and therefore also the violation of the wiedemann - franz law .",
    "the deviations of the fano factor from @xmath0 would therefore be smaller in systems with stronger spin - flip scattering .",
    "on the other hand , the quasiequilibrium limit generally requires @xmath91 , where @xmath92 is the electron - electron scattering length and @xmath93 is the electron - phonon scattering length .",
    "we may now generalize the overall behavior of the fano factor from ref .   to spin valves : for @xmath94 , the fano factor is 1/3 , independent of the magnetization configuration or the microscopic details . increasing the voltage and thereby decreasing @xmath92",
    ", fano factor tends to another value , which now depends on both the magnetization configuration and the relative sizes of the spacer and the ferromagnets .",
    "in summary , we showed that the breakdown of the wiedemann - franz law via inter - spin energy relaxation leads to a drastic change in the shot noise through a diffusive spin valve .",
    "unlike spin - flip scattering , the heat exchange between the two spin subsystems leads to a suppression of the noise for the antiparallel magnetization of the electrodes when the resistance of the valve is maximal .",
