    "<S> these states arise due to the distortion of the two ti atoms adjacent to the extra sro layers and the associated splitting of the local ti @xmath47 states . as shown in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> the distortions at the extra sro layers localize the cbm ( vbm ) orbital at the edges ( center ) of the perovskite layers , leading to the quasi two - dimensional properties of the rp series . </S>",
    "<S> if the distortions are removed from the structure of @xmath7 by artificially aligning the sr and ti atoms with the o atoms , the cbm becomes a degenerate set of @xmath7 ti @xmath48 states and the cbm wavefunction recovers to an unconfined uniform distribution of @xmath48 states along the vertical direction ( see fig .  </S>",

    "<S> experimentally , low - lying conduction states and excitonic effects become negligible due to limited resolution ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig4 ]  ( a ) ) and optical gaps converge continuously with increasing @xmath7 , explaining the absence of band gap discontinuity in the optical measurements ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig3 ]  ( a ) ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the increase of exciton binding energy at small @xmath7 implies a spatial localization of the exciton of @xmath8 . as a means of visualizing the lowest singlet exciton , fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig4](b)-(c ) shows the top and side views of an isosurface probability amplitude of finding an electron given a hole is fixed near the o atom . </S>",
    "<S> the exciton displays charge - transfer character and localizes , in the 2d plane defined by the lone tio@xmath9 layer . </S>",
    "<S> the real space wave function envelope of the exciton resembles the @xmath60 state of the 2d hydrogenic model and has an average radius of @xmath61  @xcite , with @xmath62 the bohr radius . </S>",
    "<S> our calculations show that the exciton binding energy is insensitive to epitaxial strain : while direct and indirect band gaps decrease linearly by  @xmath63  ev from tensile ( @xmath64% ) to compressive ( @xmath65% ) strain , the exciton binding energy varies by less than 10  mev in the same strain range . as @xmath7 increases , the exciton localizes on the tio@xmath9 layers next to the extra sro layer due to the distortions next to the sro layers .    in summary , </S>",
    "<S> we have used dft with different functionals , and the @xmath25/bse approach to compute quasiparticle and optical spectra of selected members of the sr@xmath0ti@xmath1o@xmath2 series . </S>",
    "<S> our @xmath25/bse direct and indirect optical gaps for the rp series are in excellent agreement with measured optical gaps when electron - hole interactions are included . </S>",
    "<S> we find that quantum confinement , induced by the extra sro layers in the rp series , produces a larger increase in quasiparticle band gaps , relative to trends in optical gaps . </S>",
    "<S> the exciton binding energy is significant and increases for small @xmath7 , reaching a value of 330  mev . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath25/bse spectra reproduce the main experimental features and reveal excitonic structure near the gap edge . </S>",
    "<S> our work suggests that the rp series may be a useful framework for the study of dimensionality and quantum confinement in optoelectronic properties of complex oxides . </S>"
