    "quantum physics is a technically difficult and abstract subject .",
    "the subject matter makes instruction quite challenging , and advanced students constantly struggle to master basic concepts .",
    "several investigators have explored difficulties in learning quantum mechanics  @xcite . here",
    "we describe the results from part of a survey of quantum mechanics concepts given to 202 graduate students from seven different universities .",
    "the 50 minute written survey administered at the beginning of a first - year , first - semester / quarter graduate quantum mechanics course covers a wide variety of fundamental quantum concepts . to investigate the difficulties with these concepts in depth , fifteen beginning graduate students or physics seniors from the university of pittsburgh enrolled in an undergraduate quantum mechanics course",
    "were interviewed using a think - aloud protocol  @xcite .",
    "students were asked to verbalize their thought processes while they were working on the survey problems .",
    "students were not interrupted unless they remained quiet for a while . in the end",
    ", we asked them for clarifications of the issues they had not made clear earlier .",
    "although students from some universities performed better on average than others , we find that students have common difficulties with many basic concepts in quantum mechanics , regardless of where they are enrolled .    during the design of the survey",
    ", we consulted three faculty members at pitt who had taught quantum mechanics .",
    "previously , we discussed with them the fundamental concepts that they expected the students in a first - semester graduate quantum mechanics to know .",
    "we iterated the survey several times before coming up with the final version .",
    "here , we discuss the findings from the part of the survey that covers topics such as allowed wave functions , the time - dependence of wave functions , the probability of measuring energy and the expectation value of energy in a given state .",
    "the wave function of an electron in a one - dimensional infinite square well of width @xmath0 at time @xmath1 is given by @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the ground state and first excited stationary state of the system .",
    "( @xmath5 @xmath6 , @xmath7 where @xmath8 )    answer the following questions about this system : + ( a ) write down the wave function @xmath9 at time @xmath10 in terms of @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "+ ( b ) you measure the energy of an electron at time @xmath1 .",
    "write down the possible values of the energy and the probability of measuring each .",
    "+ ( c ) calculate the expectation value of the energy in the state @xmath9 above .",
    "+ table 1 shows percentage of correct responses for each part .",
    "the last column lists the percentage of students who displayed various kinds of common difficulties .",
    ".percentage of correct responses and the percentage of students with common difficulties on q@xmath11 ( 2 ) .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     in question 2(a ) , we were expecting the response : + @xmath12 .",
    "@xmath13 of the students provided correct responses . for tallying purposes",
    ", responses were considered correct if students wrote the phase factor for the first term as @xmath14 where @xmath15 is any real constant ( e.g. , @xmath16 in the numerator , incorrect sign , or some other constant , e.g. , mass @xmath17 in the phase were considered minor problems and ignored even though they can make the phase a quantity with dimension ) .",
    "some students wrote incorrect intermediate steps ; _",
    "e.g. _ , @xmath18 .",
    "such responses were considered correct for tallying purposes . during the individual interviews , a student proceeded from an intermediate incorrect step to the correct time - dependence in the second step similar to the expression above .",
    "further probing showed that the student was having difficulty differentiating between the hamiltonian operator and its eigenvalue and was probably thinking of @xmath19 where the hamiltonian @xmath20 acting on the stationary states gives the corresponding energies .",
    "as shown in table 1 , @xmath21 of students wrote common phase factors for both terms , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xmath22 .",
    "interviews suggest that these students were having difficulty differentiating between the time - dependence of stationary and non - stationary states .",
    "since the hamiltonian operator governs the time - development of the system , the time - dependence of a stationary state is via a simple phase factor .",
    "but non - stationary states in general have a non - trivial time - dependence because each term in a linear superposition of stationary states evolves via a different phase factor .",
    "apart from using @xmath23 as the common phase factor , other common choices include @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 etc .",
    "several students thought that the time dependence was a decaying exponential , e.g. , of the type @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 etc . during the interviews , some of these students explained their choice by insisting that the wave function must decay with time .",
    "other incorrect responses were due to partial retrieval of related facts from memory such as the following :    * @xmath33 * @xmath34 * @xmath35 * @xmath36    interviews suggest that these students often correctly remembered that the time - dependence of non - stationary states can not be represented by a common time - dependent phase factor but did not know how to correctly evaluate @xmath9 .",
    "interestingly , @xmath37 of the students wrote responses that did not have any time dependence .    in question 2(b ) , students were asked about the possible values of the energy of the electron and the probability of measuring each in the initial state @xmath38 .",
    "this turned out to be the easiest question on the survey .",
    "we expected students to note that the only possible values of the energy in state @xmath38 are @xmath39 and @xmath40 and their respective probabilities are @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "@xmath43 of students provided the correct response .",
    "@xmath44 got confused between individual measurements of the energy and its expectation value but almost none of these students calculated the correct expectation value of the energy .",
    "another common mistake was assuming that all allowed energies for the infinite square well were possible and the ground state is the most probable because it is the lowest energy state .",
    "some students thought that the probabilities for measuring @xmath39 and @xmath40 are @xmath45 and @xmath46 respectively because they included the normalization factor for the stationary state wave functions @xmath47 while squaring the coefficients .",
    "some believed that the probability amplitudes were the probabilities of measuring energy and did not square the coefficients @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "interviews suggest that students who were having difficulty with this question were very uncomfortable with the poslutates of quantum mechanics and in making qualitative inferences from quantitative tools .    in question 2(c ) , students had to calculate the expectation value of the energy in the state @xmath9 .",
    "the expectation value of the energy is time - independent ( it is the same in states @xmath9 and @xmath38 ) because the hamiltonian does not depend on time . if @xmath50 , then the expectation value of the energy in this state is @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the probability of measuring the energy @xmath53 .",
    "this question turned out to be difficult for students and only @xmath54 provided the correct response .",
    "a surprising result is that a majority of students who had answered 2(b ) correctly did not see its relevance for 2(c ) , and did not exploit what they found for 2(b ) in answering 2(c ) .",
    "consequently , many of the @xmath54 of students who answered question 2 ( c ) correctly worked out @xmath55 from scratch by explicitly writing @xmath56 , then writing the wave function @xmath9 as a linear superposition of the ground state and first excited state , then using the fact that @xmath20 acting on a stationary state will give the corresponding energy and the same state back and using the orthonormalization of the wave function .",
    "they explicitly showed that the time - dependent phase factors for the two terms that survive will go away due to complex conjugation .",
    "however , many students who tried to solve the problem this way by writing down the wave function explicitly inside the integral got lost along the way . some got lost early while others did not remember the orthonormalization condition or forgot to take the complex conjugate of the wave function .",
    "some forgot that there was an integral involved in calculating the expectation value of a physical observable and wrote @xmath57 .",
    "their final answers were in terms of the ground and first excited state wave functions .",
    "interviews suggest that there are two main reasons for why students did not exploit their response to part 2(b ) for answering 2(c ) : ( i ) students did not recall the interpretation of expectation value as an ensemble average and thought that the only way to calculate the expectation value is by the formal method above ( during the interviews , these students incorrected claimed that if the wave function is not given but the allowed energies and the probability of measuring each energy are given , it is not possible to calculate @xmath55 ) , and ( ii ) students believed that the probability of measuring different energies should depend on time ( despite the fact that they evaluated @xmath9 in question 2 ( a ) ) .    in the interview , one student who answered 2(b ) correctly did not know how to apply it to question 2(c ) .",
    "he wrote an explicit expression involving the wave function for the ground and first excited states but thought that @xmath58 with no @xmath59 on the right hand side of that equation .",
    "therefore , he got a final expression for @xmath55 that involved wave functions .",
    "when he was told explicitly by the interviewer that the final answer should not be in terms of @xmath60 and @xmath61 and he should try to find his mistake , the student tried his best but could not find his mistake .",
    "then , the interviewer explicitly pointed to the particular step in which he had made the mistake and asked him to find it .",
    "the student still had difficulty because he believed @xmath58 was correct .",
    "finally , the interviewer told the student that @xmath62 .",
    "at this point , the student was able to use orthonormality correctly to obtain the correct result @xmath63 .",
    "then , the interviewer asked him to think whether it is possible to calculate @xmath55 based upon his response to 2 ( b ) .",
    "the student s eyes brightened and he responded , ",
    "i never thought of it this way ...",
    "i can just multiply the probability of measuring a particular energy with that energy and add them up to get the expectation value because expectation value is the average value \" . then , pointing to his detailed work for 2(c ) he added ,  you can see that the time dependence cancels out ... \" .",
    "@xmath64 of the students simply wrote @xmath65 or @xmath66 and did not know how to proceed .",
    "a few students wrote the expectation value of energy as @xmath67/2 $ ] or @xmath68/2 $ ] .    which of the following wave functions are allowed for an electron in a one dimensional infinite square well of width @xmath0 with boundaries at @xmath69 and @xmath70 : ( i ) @xmath71 , + ( ii ) @xmath72 $ ] and + ( iii ) @xmath73 ?",
    "in each of the three cases , @xmath15 is a suitable normalization constant .",
    "you must provide a clear reasoning for each case .",
    "we hoped that students would note that the last wave function @xmath73 is not allowed because it does not satisfy the boundary conditions for the system ( does not go to zero at @xmath69 and @xmath70 ) . on the other hand , the first two wave functions @xmath71 ,",
    "@xmath72 $ ] with suitable normalization constants @xmath15 are allowed .",
    "they are both smooth functions that satisfy the boundary condition ( each of them goes to zero at @xmath69 and @xmath70 ) so each can be written as a linear superposition of the stationary states .",
    "@xmath74 of students could identify that the second wave function is an allowed wave function because it is explicitly written in the form of a linear superposition of stationary states .",
    "only @xmath75 gave the correct answer for all three wave functions .",
    "within this subset , a majority correctly explained their reasoning based upon whether the boundary conditions for the system are satisfied by these wave functions . for tallying purposes ,",
    "responses were considered correct even if the reasoning was not completely correct .",
    "for example , one student wrote ( incorrectly ) :  the first two wave functions are allowed because they satisfy the equation @xmath76 and the boundary condition works \" .",
    "the first part of the reasoning provided by this student is incorrect while the second part that relates to the boundary condition is correct .",
    "@xmath77 believed that @xmath71 is not allowed but that @xmath72 $ ] is allowed .",
    "interviews suggest that a majority of students did not know that any smooth single - valued wave function that satisfies the boundary conditions can be written as a linear superposition of stationary states using the ",
    "fourier s trick \" .",
    "interviews and written explanations suggest that many students incorrectly believed that the following two constraints must be independently satisfied for a wave function to be allowed : ( i ) it must be a smooth single - valued function that satisfies the boundary conditions _ and _ ( ii ) one must either be able to write it as a linear superposition of stationary states , or it must satisfy the time - independent schroedinger equation ( tise ) .    as in the example below , some who correctly realized that @xmath71 satisfies the boundary condition , incorrectly claimed that it is still not an allowed state :    * @xmath71 satisfies b.c .",
    "but does not satisfy schrodinger equation ( i.e. , it can not represent a particle wave ) .",
    "the second one is a solution to s.e .",
    "( it is a particle wave ) .",
    "the third does not satisfy b.c .",
    "many claimed that only pure sinusoidal wave functions are allowed , and @xmath78 or @xmath79 are not allowed .",
    "interviews and written explanations suggest that students believed that @xmath71 can not be written as a linear superposition of stationary states and hence it is not an allowed wave function .",
    "the following are examples :    * @xmath71 is not allowed since it is not an eigen function nor a linear combination .",
    "* @xmath71 is not allowed because it is not a linear function but schroedinger equation is linear .",
    "* @xmath71 is not allowed .",
    "only simple sines or cosines are allowed . * @xmath71 works for 3 electrons but not one .",
    "the most common incorrect response was claiming incorrectly that @xmath71 is not allowed because it does not satisfy @xmath80 .",
    "students asserted that @xmath71 does not satisfy tise ( which they believed was the equation that all allowed wave functions should satisfy ) but @xmath72 $ ] does .",
    "many explicitly wrote the hamiltonian as @xmath81 and showed that the second derivative of @xmath71 will not yield the same wave function back multiplied by a constant .",
    "incidentally , the same students did not attempt to take the second derivative of @xmath72 $ ] ; otherwise they would have realized that even this wave function does not give back the same wave function multiplied by a constant . for this latter wave function",
    ", a majority claimed that it is allowed because it is a linear superposition of @xmath6 .",
    "incidentally , @xmath71 can also be written as a linear superposition of only two stationary states .",
    "thus , students used different reasoning to test the validity of the first two wave functions as in the following example :    * @xmath82 can not be equal to @xmath83 so it is nt acceptable .",
    "second is acceptable because it is linear combination of sine .",
    "some students seemed completely confused .",
    "some incorrectly noted that @xmath72 $ ] is allowed inside the well and @xmath73 is allowed outside the well .",
    "others incorrectly claimed that @xmath71 does not satisfy the boundary condition whereas @xmath72 $ ] does .",
    "some dismissed @xmath71 claiming it is an odd function that can not be allowed for an infinite square well which is an even potential . in the interview ,",
    "a student who thought that only @xmath72 $ ] is allowed said , ",
    "these other two are not linear superpositions \" .",
    "when the interviewer asked explicitly how he could tell that the other two wave functions can not be written as a linear superposition , he said , ",
    "@xmath71 is clearly multiplicative not additive ... you can not make a cubic function out of linear superposition ...",
    "this exponential can not be a linear superposition either \" .",
    "@xmath84 of students claimed that @xmath73 is an allowed wave function for an infinite square well .",
    "these students did not examine the boundary condition .",
    "they sometimes claimed that an exponential can be represented by sines and cosines and hence it is allowed or focused only on the normalization of the wave function .",
    "also , not all students who correctly wrote that @xmath73 is not allowed provided the correct reasoning .",
    "many students claimed that the allowed wave functions for an infinite square well can only be of the form @xmath85 or that @xmath73 is allowed only for a simple harmonic oscillator or a free particle .",
    "the survey results and interviews indicate that students share common difficulties about basic quantum mechanics concepts , regardless of their background .",
    "instructional strategies that focus on improving student understanding of these concepts should take into account these difficulties .",
