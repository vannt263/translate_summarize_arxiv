    "today s most pressing cosmological questions demand the construction of galaxy surveys of unprecedented depth and volume .",
    "such questions include : is the accelerating rate of cosmic expansion driven by einstein s cosmological constant or some different form of ` dark energy ' ?",
    "what are the properties of this dark energy ? can competing models of inflation be discriminated by accurate measurements of the shape of the primordial power spectrum of mass fluctuations ?",
    "galaxy surveys delineate the large - scale structure of the universe and thereby provide a powerful and independent constraint on the cosmological model . the currently - favoured ` concordance model '  in which @xmath10 per cent of the energy density of today s universe is resident in a relatively unclustered form known as ` dark energy ' ",
    "is evidenced by a combination of observations of the cosmic microwave background ( e.g.  spergel et al .",
    "2003 ) with either those of galaxy clustering ( e.g.  percival et al .",
    "2001 ) or of high - redshift supernovae ( e.g.  riess et al .  1998 ; perlmutter et al .  1999 ) .",
    "either pair of these independent datasets are required to break the degeneracies between model parameters and render a unique cosmology .    according to standard cosmological theory ,",
    "if the linear - regime clustering power spectrum is measured with sufficient precision then it will no longer appear smooth and monotonic : specific features and modulations will become apparent .",
    "two such attributes are predicted : firstly , a series of _ acoustic oscillations _  sinusoidal modulations in power as a function of scale imprinted in the baryonic component before recombination ( peebles & yu 1970 ; hu & sugiyama 1996 )  and secondly , a _ turnover _  a broad maximum in clustering power on large scales originating from the radiation - dominated epoch .",
    "these features encode characteristic cosmological scales that can be extracted from the observations , greatly improving constraints upon cosmological models ( e.g.  blake & glazebrook 2003 ; seo & eisenstein 2003 ) .",
    "moreover , other currently - unknown modulations in power ( e.g.  signatures of inflation ) may be discovered when the clustering pattern is examined with sufficiently high precision ( e.g.  martin & ringeval 2004 ) .",
    "very recently , the acoustic signature has been convincingly identified for the first time in the clustering pattern of luminous red galaxies in the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; eisenstein et al .",
    "the 2df galaxy redshift survey has produced consistent measurements ( cole et al .  2005 ) .",
    "these results confirm previous tantalizing hints ( e.g.  miller , nichol & chen 2002 ; percival et al .",
    "the challenge now is to make more accurate measurements at different redshifts , using these features to further constrain the cosmological parameters , in particular the dark energy model . at low redshift",
    "the available volume is limited : the effect of _ cosmic variance _ is significant .",
    "therefore such surveys are insensitive to clustering modes on very large scales and are hampered by non - linear growth of structure on small scales .",
    "higher - redshift large - scale surveys are consequently required to map greater cosmic volumes : tracing clustering modes with longer wavelengths and additionally unveiling the pattern of linear clustering to significantly smaller scales .",
    "the high - redshift spectroscopic surveys currently being executed ( e.g.  deep2 , davis et al .",
    "2003 ; vvds , le fevre et al .",
    "2003 ) cover solid angles of @xmath11 deg@xmath1 , which are insufficient for detecting the predicted features in the clustering power spectrum .",
    "such projects are fundamentally limited by existing instrumentation , being performed by spectrographs with relatively small fields - of - view ( @xmath12 ) and restricted ( albeit impressive ) multi - object capabilities .",
    "some proposed new instrumentation addresses this difficulty ( e.g.  the kaos project , barden et al .  2004 ) , permitting spectroscopic exposures over single fields of @xmath13 deg@xmath1 using @xmath14 fibres .",
    "however , these projects will take many years to reach completion .",
    "in this paper we consider the role that _ photometric redshift catalogues derived from deep imaging surveys _ could play in addressing the scientific goals outlined above .",
    "extensive imaging surveys ( covering @xmath15 deg@xmath1 ) to reasonable depths ( @xmath16 ) are ongoing ( e.g.  sdss ) ; the implied redshift distributions map galaxies over cosmic distances to @xmath17 with sufficient number density that clustering measurements are limited by cosmic variance rather than by shot noise .",
    "future deeper imaging surveys ( e.g.  pan - starrs , kaiser et al .",
    "2000 ; ctio dark energy survey , http://cosmology.astro.uiuc.edu/des ; lsst , tyson et al .",
    "2002 ) are being planned to address a host of scientific questions including in particular weak gravitational lensing .",
    "we argue that such surveys will also provide powerful measurements of features in the galaxy clustering pattern .",
    "the utility of photometric redshifts  derived from broadband galaxy colours rather than from spectra  has been well - established , with many different techniques being successfully utilized .",
    "the simplest method involves the fitting of model spectral templates ( e.g.  bolzonella , miralles & pello 2000 ) .",
    "other approaches use spectroscopic ` training sets ' to calibrate the photometric redshifts via an empirical polynomial of colour terms ( connolly et al .",
    "1995 ) or an artificial neural network ( firth , lahav & somerville 2003 ) .",
    "the precision @xmath18 with which galaxy redshifts ( and therefore radial distances ) may be determined varies with the method and filter set used , together with the galaxy type , magnitude and redshift , but at best is currently @xmath19 ( e.g.  combo-17 , wolf et al .",
    "for the sdss imaging component , the rms photometric redshift accuracy varies from @xmath20 for bright galaxies with @xmath21 to @xmath22 for magnitudes @xmath23 ( csabai et al .  2003 ) .    the blurring of large - scale structure in the radial direction due to the photometric redshift error degrades measurements of the clustering pattern .",
    "however , _ on physical scales larger than that implied by the redshift error , the information is preserved_. moreover , on smaller scales the tangential information always survives , and the vast area which may be readily covered by an imaging survey can potentially provide more independent structure modes on a given scale than those yielded by a fully spectroscopic survey of a smaller solid angle , implying very competitive cosmological constraints .",
    "photometric redshifts have already been used to construct volume - limited samples of low - redshift galaxies and measure their angular clustering properties ( budavari et al .",
    "2003 ; see also meiksin , white & peacock 1999 , cooray et al .",
    "the cosmological parameter constraints resulting from future photometric redshift imaging surveys have been simulated by seo & eisenstein ( 2003 ) ; amendola , quercellini & giallongo ( 2004 ) and dolney , jain & takada ( 2004 ) .    in this study",
    "we use a monte carlo approach to model the galaxy power spectra resulting from a host of simulated photometric redshift surveys as a function of the limiting magnitude of the initial imaging and the accuracy of the derived photometric redshift .",
    "our simulation methodology is described in section [ secmeth ] , where first results for the accuracy of power spectrum measurements are presented .",
    "we infer constraints on the cosmological model using two complementary methods with very different prior assumptions .",
    "firstly , in sections [ secwig ] and [ secturn ] we discuss in detail the resulting confidence of detection of the acoustic oscillations and power spectrum turnover , respectively , and the accuracy with which the associated characteristic cosmological scales may be extracted . in these analyses",
    "we make minimal assumptions , purely concerning ourselves with the statistical detection of power spectrum features relative to a smooth monotonic fit .",
    "secondly , in section [ seccospar ] we use the full power spectrum shape information in conjunction with theoretical fitting formulae to compute constraints on the basic parameters of the cosmological model , in particular the baryon fraction @xmath24 and the running of the spectral index of the primordial power spectrum @xmath25 . in all cases",
    "we compare our results to those deduced from spectroscopic redshift surveys .",
    "we evaluate the effect of the approximations of our methodology in section [ secapprox ] , in particular considering a wider range of photometric redshift error distributions .",
    "finally , in section [ secrealsurv ] we outline the prospects for obtaining the requisite imaging depth and photometric redshift accuracy using realistic future surveys .",
    "our methodology for simulating the large - scale structure of future galaxy surveys is to generate many ` monte carlo ' realizations of galaxy distributions from a fiducial power spectrum .",
    "an observed power spectrum is measured for each realization separately , using techniques similar to those which would be employed for real survey data .",
    "the resulting ensemble of observed power spectra can then be used to quantify the error distribution in derived quantities , without any need to approximate the likelihood surface by techniques such as fisher matrices ( e.g.  seo & eisenstein 2003 ; amendola et al .",
    "2004 ; dolney et al .",
    "for example , the standard deviation in the measurement of the power spectrum @xmath26 in a given bin around scale @xmath27 follows from the scatter in the recovered values of @xmath26 in that bin across the realizations , without the need for analytic approximations .",
    "our procedure for modelling photometric redshifts is to convolve the simulated galaxy distributions in the radial direction with a photometric redshift error function ( in the fiducial case , a gaussian with width @xmath28 in real space ) .",
    "the measured power spectrum is derived by computing the fourier transform of the whole survey box , then discarding small - scale radial fourier modes with wavenumbers @xmath29 ( which contribute no signal due to the radial smearing ) .",
    "note that the resulting number of useful fourier structure modes is identical to that obtained if the survey box is instead split into many independent slabs of width @xmath28 and a purely _ angular _ power spectrum is measured for each slice .",
    "in particular , we wish to assess the confidence with which we can detect specific features in the clustering power spectrum such as the acoustic oscillations and the ` turnover ' .",
    "these features can be modelled by simple empirical formulae which can be fitted to each measured power spectrum realization , and the best - fit @xmath30 statistic calculated .",
    "the resulting best - fit @xmath30 can be compared with that of a smooth ( featureless ) power spectrum fit , resulting in a _ relative probability of feature detection for each realization_. the distribution of the relative probabilities across the monte carlo realizations enables a very realistic assessment of the efficacy of future surveys across the statistical ensemble of possible universes .",
    "furthermore , we are interested in recovering _",
    "characteristic scales _ from these features in the power spectrum .",
    "these scales can be encoded into our empirical fitting formulae ; the distribution of best - fitting values of these scales across the realizations is indicative of the realistic accuracy with which it is possible to measure them with the simulated survey .    in order to perform our simulations",
    "we must also adopt a fiducial set of cosmological parameters , which determine both the cosmic volume mapped by a given survey and the fiducial power spectrum ( via the fitting formulae of eisenstein & hu 1998 ) .",
    "we characterize a photometric redshift imaging survey using two parameters :    * the photometric redshift error distribution ( in the simplest case , a gaussian distribution with standard deviation @xmath18 ) , which controls the ` smearing ' of the underlying large - scale structure in the radial direction . *",
    "the threshold apparent magnitude of the input imaging catalogue , @xmath31 , which determines the redshift distribution @xmath32 of the ` unsmeared ' galaxy distribution , i.e.  the radial depth of the survey .",
    "this magnitude limit is defined using the sdss @xmath33-band filter .    in this paper",
    "we present the results of simulations of a range of photometric redshift surveys as a function of these two parameters .",
    "we assume the survey area in all cases is @xmath0 deg@xmath1 .    in the following section we provide a detailed account of the assumptions and method we used to simulate the observed power spectra .",
    "for analyses of future spectroscopic redshift surveys using a similar method we refer the reader to blake & glazebrook ( 2003 ) and glazebrook & blake ( 2005 ) .      1 .",
    "a fiducial cosmology is chosen for the simulation . unless otherwise stated we assumed a flat @xmath8cdm universe with parameters @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",

    "the chosen redshift interval depends on @xmath31 as described in section [ secnz ] ( and listed in table [ tabsurv ] ) .",
    "we performed our simulations using a ` flat - sky approximation ' for computational convenience ( this approximation has a negligible effect on our results as discussed in section [ secapprox ] ) .",
    "a cuboid with sides of co - moving lengths @xmath42 is created , possessing a volume equal to that enclosed by the survey cone .",
    "we take the @xmath43-axis as the radial direction .",
    "the length @xmath44 is the co - moving distance between redshifts @xmath45 and @xmath46 , and the other dimensions are determined by stipulating @xmath47 ( although the results are independent of the ratio @xmath48 , assuming that both of these dimensions are large enough to imply a sensitivity to structural modes with scales contributing to the acoustic oscillations ) .",

    "@xmath49 is computed for the chosen parameters @xmath50 from the fitting formula of eisenstein & hu ( 1998 ) , assuming a @xmath51 normalization @xmath52 and a primordial power - law slope @xmath53 .",
    "the survey is assumed to have an ` effective ' redshift @xmath54 .",
    "the power spectrum is scaled to this redshift using a standard @xmath8cdm growth factor : @xmath55 where we use the carroll , press & turner ( 1992 ) approximation for @xmath56 and a constant linear bias factor @xmath57 for the clustering of galaxies with respect to matter .",
    "the value @xmath58 is assumed for our surveys , unless otherwise stated .",
    "we neglect any evolution of clustering across the depth of the survey box .",
    "this approximation is discussed in section [ secapprox ] ; we note that the clustering amplitude of galaxies is known to evolve much less rapidly with redshift than that of the underlying mass fluctuations ( indicating an evolution of the galaxy bias parameter in the opposite sense ) .",
    "the location in @xmath27-space of the transition between the linear and non - linear regimes of gravitational clustering , @xmath59 , is determined from @xmath60 in a conservative manner ( see blake & glazebrook 2003 , figure 1 ) .",

    "7 .   a set of monte carlo realizations ( numbering 400 for all simulations presented here )",

    "10 . a photometric redshift error distribution is assumed .",
    "for our main set of simulations , we modelled this function as a gaussian distribution , such that the radial co - moving co - ordinate @xmath43 of each galaxy was smeared by an amount @xmath63 sampled from a probability distribution @xmath64 } . \\label{eqzerr}\\ ] ] in practice we specified a redshift error parameter @xmath65 and derived @xmath28 in accordance with the equation @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the value of the hubble constant measured by an observer at redshift @xmath68 .",

    "the resulting distribution is our simulated photometric redshift survey .",
    "we note that our simple photometric - redshift error model represents a convolution of the ` unsmeared ' galaxy number distribution with the error function @xmath72 ( equation [ eqzerr ] ) . in this case , according to the convolution theorem , the resulting power spectrum signal is damped along the radial direction : @xmath73 } \\label{eqpkdamp}\\ ] ] where @xmath74}$ ] is the square of the fourier transform of @xmath72 .",
    "the power spectrum of the resulting distribution is measured using standard estimation tools : essentially this involves taking the fourier transform of the density field , subtracting that of the survey window function , and binning up the resulting modes in @xmath27-space ( see e.g.  hoyle et al .",
    "2002 ; note that we do not use the optimal - weighting technique presented by feldman , kaiser & peacock ( 1994 ) because this does not represent a simple convolution of the density field and consequently step ( xiii ) below would not be possible ) .",
    "power spectrum modes in fourier space are divided into bins of total @xmath27 , up to a maximum of @xmath59 .",
    "we only include modes with a value of @xmath75 less than a maximum @xmath76 .",
    "this is because in accordance with equation [ eqpkdamp ] , the photometric - redshift smearing damps the clustering signal along the radial direction such that modes with high values of @xmath75 contribute only noise .",
    "hence the dominant contribution to power spectrum bins with @xmath77 originates from tangential fourier modes with @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "the value of @xmath80 is determined by the equation @xmath81 where the coefficient of 2 was determined by experiment to be optimal for the surveys presented here .",

    "the values of the fitted parameters are displayed in table [ tabsurv ] .",

    "for each apparent magnitude limit we selected a redshift interval @xmath39 for the simulation .",
    "for all but the shallowest surveys we set @xmath94 , the results are insensitive to this choice because there is minimal volume contained by lower redshifts . as the value of @xmath95 increases ,",
    "the variance in the recovered power spectrum is determined by a balance between two conflicting effects : increasing survey volume ( i.e.  decreasing cosmic variance ) and decreasing average number density ( i.e.  increasing shot noise ) owing to the fixed magnitude threshold .",
    "we determined the optimal value of @xmath95 for each magnitude threshold by experimenting to determine the most accurate measurement of the acoustic oscillations ( see section [ secwig ] ) .",
    "our chosen ranges are listed in table [ tabsurv ] .",
    "we note that the optimal value of @xmath95 for measuring power spectrum modes around the turnover is marginally higher than that for detecting the acoustic oscillations , because in the former case the power spectrum amplitude is at a maximum , implying a lower required galaxy number density for suppressing shot noise .",
    "we always use the more conservative values of @xmath95 in table [ tabsurv ] , but this does not change our results significantly .",

    "the vvds survey databases would constitute a suitable spectroscopic calibration set ( see table [ tabfutcalib ] ) for photometric redshift techniques that require it .",
    "as discussed in section [ secphotozerr ] , the inevitable presence of a small fraction of interlopers with significantly larger redshift errors does not compromise the scientific results .    combining these results with our figures [ figwigconfphoto ] and [ figturnconfphoto ]",
    "we conclude that a photometric redshift analysis of the entire sdss imaging database may not succeed in detecting features in the galaxy power spectrum in the model - independent manner discussed in sections [ secwig ] and [ secturn ] .",
    "for example even if @xmath108 and @xmath109 were possible then figures [ figwigconfphoto ] and [ figturnconfphoto ] would imply a wiggle ` detection ' with 90 per cent confidence and a turnover ` detection ' with 80 per cent confidence .",
    "however the prospects for using the @xmath8cdm fit in figure  [ figconf_obom ] are better , implying a detection of @xmath110 with a significance of 8-@xmath99 ( for fixed values of @xmath111 and @xmath112 ) .    however , it is clear that certain sub - classes of galaxy perform significantly better regarding photometric redshifts : sdss red galaxies yield an accuracy twice that of blue galaxies ( csabai et al .",
    "2003 ) , and luminous red galaxies ( lrgs ) permit a rms redshift precision of @xmath113 for @xmath114 ( padmanabhan et al .",
    "in addition , these lrgs inhabit massive dark matter haloes and are consequently biased tracers of the large - scale structure ( we assume a linear bias factor @xmath115 ) .",
    "the resulting amplification of the clustering strength implies that a lower space density is required to yield a given power spectrum accuracy , although in some models of galaxy clustering the amplitude of acoustic oscillations is diluted for the most massive galaxies ( e.g.  peacock & smith 2000 ) .",
    "the optimal imaging approach is therefore to analyze an lrg _ photometric redshift catalogue _ ( a suitable spectroscopic training set is the sdss-2df lrg redshift survey , see padmanabhan et al .",
    "we simulated such a catalogue using a redshift interval @xmath116 , assuming a gaussian redshift distribution peaking at @xmath117 of standard deviation @xmath118 .",
    "we supposed lrgs could be selected from the photometric data with a surface density @xmath119 deg@xmath92 and photometric redshifts measured with an accuracy @xmath113 ( i.e.  @xmath120 ; see padmanabhan et al .",
    "in addition , lrgs are assigned a linear bias factor @xmath115 .",
    "some of these assumptions may be optimistic , in particular padmanabhan et al .",
    "note that the photometric redshift accuracy degrades for @xmath121 .",
    "we quantified the confidence of detection of acoustic oscillations for a @xmath0 deg@xmath1 survey .",
    "the average value of @xmath122 is @xmath123 , corresponding to a detection slightly less confident than but comparable to the lrg spectroscopic database , with @xmath124 of realizations possessed a ` model - independent ' confidence exceeding 3-@xmath99 .",
    "the simulated accuracy of the standard ruler measurement is @xmath125 . for the turnover analysis ,",
    "our simulated detection confidence is low : we derive an average value of @xmath126 , with an accuracy for the turnover scale of @xmath127 .",
    "again , individual realizations may perform significantly better .",
    "we conclude that the sdss imaging dataset has the potential to yield a marginal model - independent detection of acoustic oscillations using a sub - sample of red galaxies .",
    "however , we caution that the currently - available third sdss data release ( dr3 ) , which covers a sky area @xmath14 deg@xmath1 , possesses a complicated angular window function which renders this experiment more difficult : as discussed in section [ secapprox ] , the observed power spectrum is a convolution of the underlying power spectrum and the survey window function ; if this latter possesses a substantial width in fourier space then the oscillatory signal will be smoothed and consequently harder to detect .",
    "we now turn our attention to future surveys .",
    "we first note that the availability of _ near infra - red imaging _ to appropriate depths is extremely valuable for galaxies with redshifts @xmath128 . in this range ,",
    "bolzonella , miralles & pello ( 2000 ) derived a factor of 2 improvement in redshift accuracy when @xmath129 photometry was added to the standard optical wavebands .",
    "the combination of the future ukidss infra - red data ( see table [ tabfutsurv ] ) with the ongoing sdss optical survey will therefore be very powerful , and should permit detection of the acoustic oscillations using the complete galaxy population rather than special sub - classes .",
    "for example , if the photometric error were halved from @xmath108 to @xmath130 ( assuming a magnitude threshold @xmath131 ) then the model - independent wiggle detection limits in figure [ figwigconfphoto ] show a detection at 99 per cent confidence ( as opposed to just over 90 per cent without the infra - red data ) .",
    "it is clear from figure [ figwigconfphoto ] that in order to deliver a _",
    "high - significance _ measurement of the acoustic peaks using photometric redshifts ( together with a significant detection of the power spectrum turnover ) , a much deeper optical database is required ( @xmath132 ) over an area of several thousand deg@xmath1 . such a catalogue may first be provided by the ctio dark energy survey ( des ; see table [ tabfutsurv ] ) . in this case",
    ", a photometric - redshift precision @xmath133 suffices for delineation of the acoustic oscillations and turnover , a redshift accuracy which has been achieved in existing analyses of the hubble deep field ( e.g.  fernandez - soto et al .",
    "furthermore , judged solely by the accuracy with which the power spectrum features can be mapped out , this photometric - redshift approach will be competitive when compared to the spectroscopic redshift surveys which will be contemporary to the des ( e.g.  the kaos proposal )  although we note that in terms of measuring the dark energy parameters , a spectroscopic survey yields critical additional information in the radial direction ( namely , the hubble constant at high redshift ) which is forfeited by the photometric - redshift approach .",
    "the ` ultimate ' photometric - redshift survey would cover an area @xmath40 approximating the whole sky to a magnitude depth @xmath134 ; surveys with the lsst will approach these specifications ( see table [ tabfutsurv ] ) .",
    "if we assume that the redshift accuracy can not exceed the limit @xmath135 , in this best case a competing spectroscopic survey would need to cover @xmath136 deg@xmath1 to produce comparable power spectrum constraints ( i.e.  trace the same number of fourier structure modes ) . in optical wavebands , spectrographs with fields - of -",

    "we note that ultimately the matter power spectrum derived from gravitational lensing will circumvent the assumptions about bias necessary for the interpretation of galaxy surveys . of course",
    ", lensing investigations can be performed with the identical imaging datasets discussed here , and indeed the application of photometric redshifts will form an important part of that interpretation .",
    "however , due to the unknown intrinsic shapes of galaxies , many galaxies have to be averaged to obtain a cosmic shear signal .",
    "therefore we will always be able to obtain constraints from the galaxy power spectrum that are vastly tighter than those inferred from the lensing power spectrum , albeit less reliable owing to the caveats regarding bias .",
    "thus galaxy surveys are the best place to look for the first glimpses of any exciting new physics revealed by studies of large - scale structure .",
    "we have used monte carlo techniques to estimate the measurement precision of the galaxy power spectrum achievable using photometric redshift imaging surveys with a variety of magnitude depths and photometric redshift accuracies .",
    "we have focussed on two main areas : + @xmath140 the ` model - independent ' measurement of specific features in the galaxy power spectrum : the acoustic oscillations and the turnover . in particular , we have carefully quantified the statistical confidence with which these features may be detected , together with the accuracy with which the acoustic and turnover scales can be inferred .",
    "+ @xmath140 the assumption of the @xmath8cdm paradigm to place tighter constraints on the baryon fraction @xmath24 from galaxy surveys alone , and an evaluation of the additional constraints on the running of the spectral index of the primordial power spectrum as increasingly powerful galaxy surveys are combined with wmap .",
    "we summarize our general findings as follows : + @xmath140 on linear - regime scales , a large photometric redshift survey can provide competitive power spectrum measurements when compared to contemporaneous spectroscopic surveys .",
    "for example , given a magnitude threshold @xmath141 , a @xmath0 deg@xmath1 photometric redshift survey with error parameter @xmath108 results in a confidence of detecting the acoustic oscillations that is comparable to a spectroscopic survey covering @xmath142 deg@xmath1 .",
    "( albeit with the loss of radial information that is helpful for constraining dark energy models ) .",
    "+ @xmath140 we compare various different definitions of ` detection of acoustic oscillations ' , the most optimistic of which is a @xmath8cdm fit to the data ( i.e.  derivation of a baryon fraction significantly exceeding zero ) which ( for fixed values of @xmath111 and @xmath112 ) yields detections with statistical significance approximately a factor of four @xmath99 s greater than our default ` model - independent ' fit using no shape information .",
    "+ @xmath140 concerning the power spectrum turnover , the relevant scales are sufficiently large that photometric redshifts with precision better than @xmath143 retain information equivalent to spectroscopic surveys .",
    "an imaging depth @xmath132 is required to deliver a 3-@xmath99 detection confidence .",
    "+ @xmath140 our results are robust against more complex photometric redshift error distributions such as double gaussian models , if our parameter @xmath65 is interpreted as the overall rms error .    in terms of realistic ongoing and future surveys : + @xmath140",
    "the sdss has already yielded a convincing detection of acoustic features in the spectroscopic survey of luminous red galaxies .",
    "a marginal ` model - independent ' detection may also follow from this sample .",
    "+ @xmath140 analysis of an lrg photometric redshift database selected directly from the imaging data may yield a measurement of comparable precision .",
    "+ @xmath140 assuming a @xmath8cdm model and calculating the number of standard deviations by which @xmath24 ( marginalized over the shape parameter @xmath144 ) exceeds zero shows that , for our simulated full sdss spectroscopic survey the baryons would be detected at @xmath145-@xmath99 , whereas for a photometric redshift survey to magnitude depth @xmath146 with @xmath147 the detection level is 9-@xmath99 .",
    "we note that these analyses assume a conservative specification of the maximum wavenumber @xmath148 for which a linear power spectrum is fitted .",
    "+ @xmath140 a high - significance analysis of the acoustic oscillations from photometric redshifts , and a model - independent detection of the power spectrum ` turnover ' , requires a significantly deeper optical database ( @xmath132 ) over an area of several thousand deg@xmath1 .",
