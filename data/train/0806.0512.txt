    "recent vlti interferometric observations in the 813  wavelength range by @xcite confirm the presence of a geometrically thick , torus - like dust distribution in the nucleus of circinus , as required by unification schemes of seyfert galaxies .",
    "several aspects of their data require that this torus is irregular , or clumpy , in agreement with the earlier prediction of @xcite .",
    "we have recently developed the first formalism for handling clumpy agn tori and presented initial results @xcite .",
    "the reported clumpy models have since been employed in a number of observational studies , including the first analysis of spitzer observations by the goods legacy project @xcite .",
    "our clumpy torus models were also employed in the analysis of spatially - resolved , near - diffraction - limited 10  spectra of the ngc  1068 nucleus @xcite .",
    "the geometry and kinematics of both water maser @xcite and narrow - line emission @xcite indicate that the ngc  1068 torus and accretion disk are oriented nearly edge - on .",
    "the @xcite clumpy model for ir emission is the first to correctly reproduce the observed near - ir flux with an edge - on orientation .",
    "in contrast , smooth - density models require viewing angles 2230  above the equatorial plane in order to bring into view the warm face of the torus backside @xcite .",
    "clumpiness is also essential for understanding the puzzling interferometry result that dust temperatures as different as @xmath3 800 k and 200300k are found at such close proximity to each other @xcite .",
    "the mounting observational evidence in favor of clumpy , rather than smooth , dust distribution in agn tori has sparked additional modeling efforts by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this two - paper series expands the analysis of @xcite . in its first part (",
    "* hereafter ) we develop the full formalism for continuum emission from clumpy media and construct the source functions of dusty clouds  the building blocks of the agn torus . here",
    "we assemble these clouds into complete models of the torus , and study the model predictions and their implications to ir observations .",
    "in comparing the predictions of any torus model with observations one faces a difficult problem  the overwhelming majority of these observations do not properly isolate the torus ir emission .",
    "starburst emission is increasingly recognized as an important component of the ir flux measured in many , perhaps most , agn ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in addition to this well known contamination , even ir from the immediate vicinity of the agn may not always originate exclusively from the torus , further complicating modeling efforts .",
    "a case in point is the @xcite modeling of ngc1068 .",
    "all flux measurements with apertures @xmath4 are in good agreement with the model results , but the flux collected with larger apertures greatly exceeds the model predictions at wavelengths longer than 4 .",
    "this discrepancy can be attributed to ir emission from nearby dust outside the torus .",
    "mason et al show that the torus contributes less than 30% of the 10  flux collected with apertures @xmath5 and that the bulk of the large - aperture flux comes at these wavelengths from dust in the ionization cones ; while less bright than the torus dust , it occupies a much larger volume ( see also * ? ? ? * ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the torus dominates the emission at short wavelengths ; at 2 , more than 80% of the flux measured with apertures @xmath5 comes from the torus even though its image size is less than 0.04@xmath6 @xcite .",
    "these difficulties highlight a problem that afflicts all ir studies of agn .",
    "the torus emission can be expected to dominate the agn observed flux at near ir because such emission requires hot dust that exists only close to the center . but longer wavelengths originate from cooler dust , and the torus contribution can be overwhelmed by the surrounding regions . unfortunately , there are not too many sources like ngc1068 .",
    "no other agn has been observed as extensively and almost no other observations have the angular resolution necessary to identify the torus component , making it impossible to determine in any given source which are the wavelengths dominated by torus emission .",
    "there are no easy solutions to this problem .",
    "one possible workaround is to forgo fitting of the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) in individual sources and examine instead the observations of many sources to identify characteristics that can be attributed to the torus signature .",
    "one example for the removal of the starburst component is the @xcite composite sed analysis of the _ spitzer _ observations of pg quasars .",
    "netzer et al identify two sub - groups of `` weak fir '' and `` strong fir '' qsos and a third group of far - ir ( fir ) non - detections . assuming a starburst origin for the far - ir",
    ", they subtract a starburst template from the mean sed of each group .",
    "the residual seds are remarkably similar for all three groups , and thus can be reasonably attributed to the intrinsic agn contribution , in spite of the many uncertainties .",
    "however , while presumably intrinsic to the agn , it is not clear what fraction of this emission originates from the torus as opposed to the ionization cones",
    ". an example of sample analysis that may have identified the torus component is the @xcite compilation of _ spitzer _ ir observations . in spite of the large aperture of these measurements , seyfert 1 and 2",
    "galaxies show a markedly different behavior for the 10  feature , both in their mean ir seds and in their distributions of feature strength .",
    "furthermore , ultraluminous ir galaxies ( ulirg ) that are not associated with agn show yet another , entirely different behavior , indicating that the observed mean behavior of seyfert galaxies is intrinsic to the agn . accepting the framework of the unification scheme ,",
    "the differences hao et al find between the appearances of seyfert 1 and 2 can be reasonably attributed to the torus contribution ; the ionization cones dust is optically thin , therefore its ir emission is isotropic and can not generate the observed differences between types 1 and 2 .",
    "here we invoke both approaches in comparing our model predictions with observations .",
    "we start by assembling dusty clouds into complete models of the torus , as described in  [ sec : model ] .",
    "our model predictions for torus emission and the implications to ir observations are presented in   [ sec : seds][sec : spp ] , while in  [ sec : others ] we discuss aspects of clumpiness that are unrelated to the ir emission , such as the torus mass , unification statistics , etc . in  [ sec : discussion ] we conclude with a summary and discussion .",

    "for a given torus model , the distributions of dust temperature and of brightness are unique functions of the scaled radial distance @xmath32 : two sources with the same cloud properties but different luminosities will have the same distributions in terms of @xmath32 , only the more luminous one will have its brightness spread over a larger area because of its larger  ( this point is explained further in the appendix ) . denoting the torus flux by @xmath33 , the spectral shape @xmath34 is independent of @xmath7 .",

    "such screens present a contrived solution for the 10  absorption in ulirgs .",
    "in contrast , a single entity of smooth - density embedding dust that is both geometrically and optically thick accounts naturally for the total ir characteristics of deeply absorbed ulirgs .",

    "therefore , if this finding is verified it could indicate that the optical depths of torus clouds perhaps are larger in qsos than in seyfert galaxies . however , this is not a unique interpretation .",

    "taking account of the torus clumpiness has immediate implications for a number of other issues not directly related to its ir emission .      as shown in  2.3 of part i , the total mass in torus clouds can be written as @xmath117 ; note that  does not involve the volume filling factor . with the cloud distribution from eq .",

    "for example , if the volume filling factor is 10% , in order to encounter  = 510 clouds along each radial equatorial ray , the torus must contain  @xmath66 45 clouds ,          the classification of agn into types 1 and 2 is based on the extent to which the nuclear region is visible . in its standard formulation , the unification approach posits the viewing angle as the sole factor in determining the agn type , and this is indeed the case for any smooth - density torus whose column density declines with angle @xmath19 away from the equatorial plane .",
    "the agn is obscured from directions that have @xmath127 and visible from those with @xmath128 .",

    "the issue is currently unsettled because @xcite have recently found that @xmath136 is only about 50% in seyfert galaxies , or @xmath139 30 .    within the clumpy torus paradigm ,",
    "the difference between types 1 and 2 is not truly an issue of orientation but of probability for direct view of the agn .",
    "since that probability is always finite , type 1 sources can be detected from what are typically considered type 2 orientations , even through the torus equatorial plane : if  = 5 , for example , the probability for that is @xmath140 on average .",
    "this might offer an explanation for the few seyfert galaxies reported by @xcite to show type 1 optical line spectra together with 0.416  sed that resemble type 2 .",
    "conversely , if a cloud happens to obscure the agn from an observer , that object would be classified as type 2 irrespective of the viewing angle . in cases of such single cloud obscuration , on occasion",
    "the cloud may move out of the line - of - sight , creating a clear path to the nucleus and a transition to type 1 spectrum .",
    "the time scale for such an event is determined by the cloud size and velocity .",
    "neither quantity can be found from the sed since optical depth is the only property of a single cloud that can be determined from sed analysis .",
    "however , at a distance @xmath141 ( in pc ) from a black - hole with mass 7  ( in ) , the local keplerian speed is @xmath142 kms@xmath84 and resistance to tidal sheer implies that the size of a cloud with column density @xmath143 @xmath116 is restricted to @xmath144 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the ratio of this cloud size and local keplerian speed produces a time scale of @xmath145years , an order - of - magnitude estimate for a cloud crossing time across the line of sight .",
    "although the likelihood of catching such crossing by chance is small , transitions between type 1 and 2 line spectra have been observed in a few sources ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , and @xcite has argued that a couple of these cases are consistent with the change in reddening expected from cloud motion across the line of sight .",
    "it is worthwhile conducting monitoring observations in an attempt to detect additional such transitions .",
    "the most promising candidates would be obscured systems with relatively small x - ray obscuring columns , which may minimize the number of clouds along the line of sight , small torus sizes , i.e. , lower luminosities , and large black - hole masses .",

    "the sharp - edge clumpy torus has @xmath147 , practically indistinguishable from a smooth - density torus when @xmath148 exceeds  34 .",
    "however , the situation changes fundamentally for soft - edge distributions because at every viewing angle , the probability of obscuration increases with the number of clouds .",
    "as is evident from figure [ fig : f2 ] , the gaussian distribution produces a strong dependence on  and significant differences from the sharp - edge case . since the sharp - edge angular distribution is ruled out by observations (  [ sec : geometry ] ) , _ the fraction of obscured sources depends not only on the torus angular width but also on the average number of clouds along radial rays_. while the fraction @xmath149 requires @xmath113 in the sharp - edge case , in a gaussian clumpy torus it implies @xmath150 when  = 5 and @xmath151 when  = 10 ; in terms of the torus height and radius , @xmath60 (= tan@xmath16 ) is reduced from  1 to  0.7 .",
    "it is noteworthy that the behavior of the 10  feature in the @xmath152 models comes closest to matching the observed averages of both type 1 and type 2 agn , as is evident from figure [ fig : sil10a ] .",
    "the fraction @xmath136 of obscured agn decreases when the bolometric luminosity increases .",
    "this has been verified in a large number of observations that estimate the luminosity dependence of either @xmath136 or @xmath153 ( the fraction of unobscured sources ) , or differences between the luminosity functions of type 1 and 2 agn ( see * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "as is evident from figure [ fig : f2 ] , the observed decrease of @xmath136 when @xmath7 increases can be produced by either a decrease of @xmath16 at constant  or a decrease of  at constant @xmath16 .",
    "both options are equally plausible because the torus inner radius increases as @xmath13 ( eq .",

    "the decreasing-@xmath16 option would arise if the torus height is independent of luminosity or increases more slowly than @xmath13 , the decreasing-  option would arise if the torus outer radius is independent of luminosity or increases more slowly than @xmath13 .    the observed trend of @xmath136 to decrease with @xmath7 may arise from either @xmath16 or  or both .",
    "source statistics can not distinguish between the various possibilities , the only way to decide between them is to find @xmath7-dependence in other observable quantities . the 10  silicate feature offers such an indicator (  [ sec : sil ] ) . among type 1 agn",
    ", quasars consistently produce an emission feature but seyfert galaxies are featureless on average , displaying either weak emission or absorption scattered around zero feature strength . in type 2 agn the feature switches from clear absorption in seyfert galaxies to apparent emission in qso2 .",
    "that is , in both type 1 and type 2 agn the feature moves toward emission with the increase from seyfert to quasar luminosities .",
    "as is evident from figure [ fig : sil10a ] , the decreasing-  option naturally produces such a universal trend : the feature appears in emission for both pole - on and edge - on viewing when  decreases to 2 at a fixed @xmath16 .",
    "in contrast , the decreasing-@xmath16 option produces the observed trend toward stronger emission feature only in type 1 agn , not in type 2 ; varying @xmath16 has virtually no effect on the 10  feature in type 2 viewing . explaining the switch toward apparent emission feature in qso2 would require that in this case higher luminosities not only reduce @xmath16 but are also accompanied by an increase in the optical depth of individual clouds .    as is evident from this discussion , current observations ,",
    "if accepted at face value and assuming that the torus contribution dominates the 10  spectral range on average , can be explained if an increasing luminosity causes a decrease in the number of clouds .",
    "whether or not this is also accompanied by a decrease in the torus angular width can not be ruled in or out .",
    "obscuration statistics and the 10  feature do not yet provide decisive information to uniquely constrain the behavior of the torus parameters with increasing luminosity .",
    "the decreasing-@xmath16 scenario is known as the receding torus model , first suggested by @xcite .",
    "it is intriguing that @xcite and @xcite derived independently an almost identical relation @xmath154 .",
    "however , both studies , as well as every other analysis of obscuration statistics thus far , were based on sharp - edge angular obscuration .",
    "removing this assumption affects profoundly the foundation of the receding torus model because the dependence on the number of clouds necessitates analysis with two free parameters , therefore @xmath16 can not be determined without .",
    "dusty material absorbs continuum radiation both in the uv / optical and x - rays , therefore the dusty torus also provides x - ray obscuration .",
    "but dust - free gas attenuates just the x - ray continuum , so clouds inside the dust sublimation radius will provide additional obscuration only in this band .",
    "observations give overwhelming evidence for the orientation dependent x - ray absorption expected from agn unification . in general , the 210 kev x - ray continuum is heavily obscured in type 2 sources and relatively unobscured in type 1 agn ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "the strong orientation - dependence of the absorption can not be attributed to the host galaxy because the agn axis , as traced by the jet position angle , is randomly oriented with respect to the galactic disk in seyfert galaxies @xcite and the nuclear dust disk in radio galaxies @xcite . yet in spite of the overall correspondence between the optical and x - ray obscuration , there is a significant number of agn for which the expected characteristics are different in the two bands . although substantial x - ray absorption is common among type 2 agn , there are also unabsorbed x - ray sources that present only narrow emission lines in their optical spectra .",
    "such cases can be explained with the observational selection effect suggested by @xcite and @xcite : in these sources , the optical light of the host galaxy outshines the agn continuum and broad lines .",
    "this suggestion is supported by the subsequent studies of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the opposite case , obscuration only in x - rays , exists too  there are type 1 , broad line agn with significant x - ray absorption @xcite .",
    "extreme cases include quasars whose optical spectrum shows little or no dust extinction while their x - ray continuum is heavily affected by compton thick absorption @xcite .",
    "this can not be attributed to observational selection effects .",
    "obscuration that affects the x - rays but not the optical arises naturally from absorption by dust - free clouds .",
    "conclusive evidence for such absorption comes from the short time scales for transit of x - ray absorbing clouds across the line of sight , which establish the existence of obscuring clouds inside the dust sublimation radius @xcite .",
    "extreme cases involve 4 hour variability @xcite and variations in absorbing column of more than @xmath116 within two days , indicating compton thick x - ray absorption from a single cloud in the broad - lines region @xcite .",
    "these observations show that the torus extends inward beyond the dust sublimation point to some inner radius  @xmath155 .",
    "clouds at @xmath156 partake in x - ray absorption but do not contribute appreciably to optical obscuration or ir emission because they are dust - free .",
    "since every cloud that attenuates the optical continuum contributes also to x - ray obscuration but not the other way round , the x - ray absorbing column always exceeds the uv / optical absorbing column , as observed @xcite .",
    "further , @xcite find that the x - ray absorbing column exceeds the reddening column in each member of an agn sample by a factor ranging from 3 up to 100 , implying that the bulk of the x - ray absorption comes from the clouds in the dust - free inner portion of the torus .",
    "this could explain the @xcite finding that at least 50% of seyfert 2 galaxies are compton thick .    in steep radial distributions such as @xmath1 , which seems to adequately describe the torus dusty portion ,",
    "most clouds are located close to the inner radius .",
    "if this radial profile continued inward into the dust - free zone , that region would dominate the x - ray obscuration  as observed .",
    "similar to the optical regime , the observed fraction of x - ray absorbed agn varies inversely with intrinsic luminosity @xcite .",
    "this fraction is usually derived from the statistics of sources that have at least one x - ray obscuring cloud along the line of sight to the agn , therefore it follows the behavior plotted in figure [ fig : f2 ] but with  corresponding to the total number of ( dusty and dust - free ) clouds .",
    "as the previous section shows , either the radial thickness @xmath16 or the cloud number  could be responsible for a decreasing @xmath136 .",
    "@xcite find that the @xmath136 fractions follow similar trends with @xmath7 in the x - ray and optical regimes , indicating that whichever intrinsic parameter is responsible for these trends it might behave similarly in the dusty and dust - free portions of the torus .      in the ubiquitous sketch by @xcite , the agn central region , comprised of the black hole ,",
    "its accretion disk and the broad - line emitting clouds , is surrounded by a large doughnut - like structure  the torus .",
    "this hydrostatic object is a separate entity , presumably populated by molecular clouds accreted from the galaxy .",
    "gravity controls the orbital motions of the clouds , but the origin of vertical motions capable of sustaining the `` doughnut '' as a hydrostatic structure whose height is comparable to its radius was recognized as a problem since the first theoretical study by @xcite .",
    "two different types of observations now show that the torus may be a smooth continuation of the broad lines region ( blr ) , not a separate entity .",
    "ir reverberation observations by @xcite show that the dust innermost radius scales with luminosity as @xmath13 and is uncorrelated with the black hole mass , demonstrating that the torus inner boundary is controlled by dust sublimation ( eq .  [ eq : rd ] ) , not by dynamical processes .",
    "moreover , in each agn for which both data exist , the ir time lag is the upper bound on all time lags measured in the broad lines , a relation verified over a range of 6  in luminosity .",
    "this finding shows that the blr extends all the way to the inner boundary of the dusty torus , validating the @xcite proposal that the blr size is bounded by dust sublimation .",
    "the other evidence is the finding by @xcite that the x - ray absorbing columns in seyfert 2 galaxies display time variations caused by cloud transit across the line of sight .",
    "most variations come from clouds that are dust free because of their proximity ( @xmath155 0.1 pc ) to the agn , but some involve dusty clouds at a few pc .",
    "other than the different time scales for variability , there is no discernible difference between the dust - free and dusty x - ray absorbing clouds , nor are there any gaps in the distribution .",
    "these observations suggest that the x - ray absorption , broad line emission and dust obscuration and reprocessing are produced by a single , continuous distribution of clouds .",
    "the different radiative signatures merely reflect the change in cloud composition across the dust sublimation radius .",
    "the inner clouds are dust free .",
    "their gas is directly exposed to the agn ionizing continuum , therefore it is atomic and ionized , producing the broad emission lines .",
    "the outer clouds are dusty , therefore their gas is shielded from the ionizing radiation , and the atomic line emission is quenched . instead , these clouds are molecular and dusty , obscuring the optical / uv emission from the inner regions and emitting ir .",
    "thus the blr occupies @xmath157 while the torus is simply the @xmath158 region .",
    "both regions absorb x - rays , but because most of the clouds along each radial ray reside in its blr segment , that is where the bulk of the x - ray obscuration is produced . since the x - ray obscuration region ( xor ) coincides mostly with the blr , it seems appropriate to name this region instead blr / xor . by the same token ,",
    "since the unification torus is just the outer portion of the cloud distribution and not an independent structure , it is appropriate to rename it the tor for toroidal obscuration region .",
    "the close proximity of blr and tor clouds should result in cases of partial obscuration , possibly leading to observational constraints on cloud sizes .",
    "the merger of the ionized and the dusty clouds into a single population offers a solution to the torus vertical structure problem .",
    "mounting evidence for cloud outflow ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) indicates that instead of a hydrostatic `` doughnut '' , the tor is just one region in the clumpy wind coming off the black - hole accretion disk ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "the accretion disk appears to be fed by a midplane influx of cold , clumpy material from the main body of the galaxy .",
    "approaching the center , conditions for developing hydromagnetically- or radiatively - driven winds above this equatorial inflow become more favorable .",
    "the disk - wind rotating geometry provides a natural channel for angular momentum outflow from the disk and is found on many spatial scales , from protostars to agn @xcite .",
    "the composition along each streamline reflects the origin of the outflow material at the disk surface .",
    "the disk outer regions are dusty and molecular , as observed in water masers in some edge - on cases @xcite . at smaller",
    "radii the dust is destroyed and the disk composition switches to atomic and ionized , producing a double - peak signature in some emission line profiles @xcite .",
    "the outflow from the atomic and ionized inner region feeds the blr and produces many atomic line signatures , including evidence for the disk wind geometry @xcite .",
    "clouds uplifted from the disk dusty and molecular outer region feed the tor and may have been detected in water maser observations of circinus @xcite and ngc 3079 @xcite .",

    "the inner and outer outflow regions , as the clouds rise and move away from the disk they expand and lose their column density , limiting the vertical scope of x - ray absorption , broad line emission and dust obscuration and emission .",
    "the result is a toroidal geometry for both the blr / xor and the tor . because of the strong photoionization heating of blr clouds they may rise to relatively lower heights than the tor dusty clouds .",
    "detailed comparisons of x - ray and optical obscuration in individual sources and in large samples should help to constrain the parameters , @xmath16 and  separately for the tor and the blr / xor .",
    "such comparisons must consider the large scatter of obscuration in individual sources around the sample mean ( see paper i ,  4.2 ) . in the outflow scenario ,",
    "the tor disappears when the bolometric luminosity decreases below  because the accretion onto the central black hole can no longer sustain the required cloud outflow rate @xcite . with further luminosity decrease , suppression of cloud outflow spreads",
    "radially inward and the blr , too , disappears . the recent review by @xcite presents extensive observational evidence for the disappearance of the torus and the blr in low luminosity agn .    the circinus seyfert 2 core provides the best glimpse of the agn dusty / molecular component .",
    "water masers trace both a keplerian disk and a disk outflow @xcite .",
    "dust emission at 813  shows a disk embedded in a slightly cooler and larger , geometrically thick torus @xcite .",
    "the dusty disk coincides with the maser disk in both orientation and size .",
    "the outflow masers trace only parts of the torus .",
    "the lack of full coverage can be attributed to the selectivity of maser operation ",
    "strong emission requires both pump action to invert the maser molecules in individual clouds and coincidence along the line of sight in both position and velocity of two maser clouds @xcite .",
    "proper motion measurements and comparisons of the disk and outflow masers offer a most promising means to probe the structure and motion of tor clouds .",
    "we have developed a formalism for handling radiative transfer in clumpy media and applied it to the ir emission from the agn dusty torus . in the calculations we execute only the first two steps of the full iteration procedure outlined in  3.2 , paper i , and the moderate total number of clouds considered here validates this procedure .",
    "when that number increases , the probability for unhindered view of the agn decreases , the role of indirectly heated clouds becomes more prominent and eventually requires higher order iterations .",
    "our current calculations employ some additional simplifying approximations : the grain mixture is handled in the composite - grain approximation , all dust is in clouds without an inter - cloud medium and all clouds are identical .",
    "we have already begun work on removing these assumptions and will report the results in future publications .",
    "in contrast with the smooth - density case , the clumpy problem is not well defined because clouds can have arbitrary shapes , and any given set of parameters can have many individual realizations .",
    "our formalism invokes a statistical approach for calculating an average behavior , and it is encouraging that other approaches produce similar results .",
    "@xcite conduct `` quasi - clumpy '' calculations in which the torus is modeled as a set of axisymmetric rings , and compare the results with the smooth - density case . in agreement with our conclusions",
    "they find that only smooth - density models can produce very deep absorption feature while clumpy dust produces stronger near - ir , broader sed and much more isotropic ir emission . @xcite",
    "employ 3d monte carlo calculations that bypass some of our approximations .",
    "they also treat different cloud realizations for the same global parameters , allowing them to show the intrinsic scatter in sed due to the stochastic nature of the problem .",
    "their results are in agreement with ours , validating our approach and the approximations we employ .",

    "@xcite too find that the silicate absorption feature is never as deep as expected for a uniform dust distribution , and obtain qualitatively similar behavior of the silicate emission feature and overall sed shape .",
    "the models presented here show that clumpy torus models are consistent with current agn observations if they contain  515 dusty clouds along radial equatorial rays , each with an optical depth  30100 .",
    "the cloud angular distribution should decline smoothly toward the axis , for example , a gaussian profile centered on the equatorial plane .",
    "power - law radial distributions @xmath159 ",
    "@xmath160 produce adequate results .",
    "dust grains with optical properties of the standard galactic mixture provide satisfactory explanation to the ir observations .",
    "the behavior of the 10  silicate feature , in particular the lack of any deep absorption features , is reproduced naturally without the need to invoke any special dust properties .",
    "several suggestions that the abundance or composition of agn dust might differ from its galactic counterpart can be discarded because of subsequent developments .",
    "@xcite note that , assuming standard dust abundance , the large column densities discovered in x - ray absorption imply torus masses in excess of the dynamical mass , posing a problem for the system stability . however , their mass estimates were based on the uniform mass distribution and large torus sizes derived from smooth - density models .",
    "the compact sizes and steep density distributions of clumpy models eliminate the problem ( see  [ sec : mass ] ) .",
    "@xcite suggested that the widely different uv and x - ray extinctions they found in individual sources could imply low dust abundance , but the subsequent discovery of rapid variations shows that x - ray obscuration by dust - free clouds is the more likely explanation ( see  [ sec : x - rays ] ) .",
    "they also invoked the lack of prominent 10  absorption features as an indication that agn dust is different from galactic , but this is a natural consequence of clumpy dust distributions ( see  [ sec : sil ] ) .",
    "intrinsic extinction curves deduced from spectral analysis of type 1 sources ( see * ? ? ? * for a recent review and a comprehensive discussion of uncertainties ) generally indicate a depletion of small grains , as could be expected : the obscuration in type 1 sources is dominated by the dusty clouds closest to the center and these clouds contain predominantly large grains , which survive at the smallest distances from the agn ( see  [ sec : sublimation ] ) .",
    "there is no compelling evidence for significant differences between the properties of agn and galactic dust .",
    "other dust compositions are not ruled out , but nothing in the current data requires major departures from the dust grains we use .",
    "the close proximity of dust temperatures as different as @xmath3 800 k and 200300k found in interferometry around 12  can not be explained by smooth - density models even when they account for the individual temperatures of grains with different sizes @xcite .",
    "clumpiness resolves this puzzling observation because the dust on the dark side of an optically thick cloud is much cooler than on the bright side .",
    "thanks to the mixture of different dust temperatures at the same radial distance , clumpy models naturally explain the torus compact size . in spite of the high anisotropy of its obscuration , the torus emission is observed to be nearly isotropic at @xmath35 12 .",
    "clumpy models resolve this puzzle too , since the emission from a torus with radial thickness @xmath17 = 10 varies little with viewing angle .",
    "the variation is especially small if the radial distribution is @xmath1 or steeper , and such steep radial profiles maintain a nearly isotropic emission even at larger torus sizes .",
    "in addition to ir observations , clumpiness significantly impacts the analysis of other data , in particular obscuration statistics .",
    "the fraction @xmath136 of obscured sources is controlled not only by the torus angular thickness @xmath16 , as in all analyses to date , but also by the cloud number . with",
    "= 5 , a 70% fraction of type 2 agn implies @xmath16  30instead of the standard 45 .",
    "observations indicate that increasing the bolometric luminosity from the seyfert to the quasar regime induces ( 1 ) a decrease of @xmath136 and ( 2 ) a switch to emission feature at 10  for both type 1 and some type 2 agn .",
    "both trends can be explained with a change in a single torus parameter  decreases from  5 in seyfert galaxies to  2 in qso ( see figures [ fig : sil10a ] and [ fig : f2 ] ) .",
    "decreasing @xmath16 , the scenario known as the receding torus model , explains the first trend but has no effect on the second .",
    "the emergence of the 10  in emission would require in this case the additional increase of individual clouds optical depth to  @xmath3 100 in qso .",
    "the decreasing-  scenario provides the simplest explanation for the trends observed when @xmath7 is increasing , but that does not guarantee its validity .",
    "this demonstrates the difficulties in deducing the model parameters from observations that can not yet resolve the torus basic ingredient  the individual dusty clouds .",
    "the problem is compounded by the lack of angular resolution that hinders clean separation of the torus component from the flux measured at most ir wavelengths and by the degeneracies of the radiative transfer solutions that prevent decisive , one - to - one associations between model parameters and observable quantities .",
    "the only practical way around these difficulties is to match trends identified in the data with similar general properties of the models .",
    "our main conclusions can be summarized as follows :    * the torus angular distribution has to be soft edged * clumpy models can produce nearly isotropic ir emission together with extremely anisotropic obscuration * clumpy models can explain all current observations with compact torus sizes ; sed fitting is a poor constraint on the size * standard interstellar dust describes adequately agn observations ; there does not seem to be a need for any major modifications of grain properties * clumpy sources never produce a very deep silicate feature ; apparent optical depth , obtained from @xmath107 where @xmath108 is the residual intensity at maximum absorption , is a poor indicator of the actual optical depth * the probability for direct line - of - sight to the agn at large viewing angles is small , but not zero * the statistics of obscured sources depend on both the torus angular thickness and the number of clouds along radial rays * the torus and the blr are the dusty ( outer ) and dust - free ( inner ) regions in a continuous cloud distribution ; a more appropriate designation for the torus is toroidal obscuration region ( tor ) * x - ray obscuration comes from both tor and , predominantly , blr clouds    as long as ir observations are incapable of resolving individual torus clouds , one must rely on the combined evidence for clumpy structure instead of on a `` smoking gun '' .",
    "individual tor clouds seem to have been resolved in observations of outflow water masers in circinus and ngc 3079 .",
    "proper motion measurements and comparison of these masers with their disk counterparts provide the most promising method for probing the tor structure and kinematics .",

    "<S> from extensive radiative transfer calculations we find that clumpy torus models with  515 dusty clouds along radial equatorial rays successfully explain agn infrared observations . the dust has standard galactic composition , with individual cloud optical depth  30100 at visual . </S>",
    "<S> the models naturally explain the observed behavior of the 10  silicate feature , in particular the lack of deep absorption features in agn of any type . </S>",
    "<S> the weak 10  emission feature tentatively detected in type 2 qso can be reproduced if in these sources  drops to 2 or  exceeds 100 . </S>",
    "<S> the clouds angular distribution must have a soft - edge , e.g. , gaussian profile , the radial distribution should decrease as @xmath0 or @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> compact tori can explain all observations , in agreement with the recent interferometric evidence that the ratio of the torus outer to inner radius is perhaps as small as 510 . </S>",
    "<S> clumpy torus models can produce nearly isotropic ir emission together with highly anisotropic obscuration , as required by observations . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast with strict variants of unification schemes where the viewing - angle uniquely determines the classification of an agn into type 1 or 2 , clumpiness implies that it is only a probabilistic effect ; a source can display type 1 properties even from directions close to the equatorial plane . </S>",
    "<S> the fraction of obscured sources depends not only on the torus angular thickness but also on the cloud number . </S>",
    "<S> the observed decrease of this fraction at increasing luminosity can be explained with a decrease of either torus angular thickness or cloud number , but only the latter option explains also the possible emergence of a 10emission feature in qso2 . </S>",
    "<S> x - ray obscuration , too , has a probabilistic nature . resulting from both dusty and dust - free clouds , </S>",
    "<S> x - ray attenuation might be dominated by the dust - free clouds , giving rise to the observed type 1 qso that are x - ray obscured . </S>",
    "<S> observations indicate that the obscuring torus and the broad line region form a seamless distribution of clouds , with the transition between the two regimes caused by dust sublimation . </S>",
    "<S> torus clouds may have been detected in the outflow component of h@xmath2o maser emission from two agn . </S>",
    "<S> proper motion measurements of the outflow masers , especially in circinus , are a promising method for probing the morphology and kinematics of torus clouds . </S>"
