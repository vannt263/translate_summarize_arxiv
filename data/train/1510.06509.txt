    "the description of complex systems in terms of the so - called `` collective '' variables has a long history in condensed matter physics .",
    "an important example of such a variable is the `` order parameter field '' usually employed for theoretical analysis of phase transitions . a convenience of this approach is guaranteed by the most economic formulation , nevertheless enabling to provide nontrivial results .",
    "sometimes the correct description can even be constructed phenomenologically , as was the case , e.g. , with the celebrated ginzburg - landau theory of superconductivity @xcite justified later on microscopic grounds @xcite .",
    "another milestone of this formalism is represented by the feynman - vernon influence functional theory @xcite and the related caldeira - leggett analysis of quantum dissipation @xcite . within this description all",
    "`` unimportant '' ( bath ) degrees of freedom are integrated out and the theory is formulated in terms of the effective action being the functional of the only collective variable of interest .",
    "both dissipation and superconductivity are combined within the ambegaokar - eckern - schn ( aes ) effective action approach @xcite describing macroscopic quantum behavior of metallic tunnel junctions . in this case",
    "the collective variable of interest is the josephson phase , and the whole analysis can be formulated for both superconducting and normal systems embracing various equilibrium and non - equilibrium situations .",
    "later on it was realized that the aes type - of - approach can be extended to arbitrary ( though sufficiently short ) coherent conductors , including , e.g. , diffusive metallic wires , highly transparent quantum contacts etc . also in this general case a complete effective action of the system can be derived both within matsubara @xcite and keldysh @xcite techniques , however the resulting expressions turn out to be rather involved and usually become tractable only if one treats them approximately in certain limits .",
    "the character of approximations naturally depends on the problem under consideration .",
    "e.g. , coulomb effects on electron transport in short coherent conductors , as well as on shot noise and higher current cumulants can be conveniently studied within the quasiclassical approximation for the phase variable @xcite , renormalization group methods @xcite , instanton technique @xcite and for almost reflectionless scatterers @xcite .",
    "some of the above approximations are also helpful for the analysis of frequency dispersion of current cumulants @xcite .",
    "another type of approximation is realized if one restricts phase fluctuations to be sufficiently small",
    ". this approximation may be particularly useful for superconducting contacts with arbitrary transmissions of their conducting channels . in this case",
    "one can derive the effective action in a tractable form @xcite and employ it for the analysis of various phenomena , such as , e.g. , equilibrium supercurrent noise , fluctuation - induced capacitance renormalization and coulomb interaction effects .",
    "an important feature of the effective action @xcite is that it fully accounts for the presence of subgap andreev bound states in superconducting contacts . in the case of sufficiently short contacts the corresponding energies of such bound states are @xmath1 , where @xmath2 @xmath3 is the superconducting gap , @xmath4 defines the transmission of the @xmath5-th conducting channel and @xmath6 is the superconducting phase jump across the contact . in the tunneling limit @xmath7",
    "we have @xmath8 for any value of the phase @xmath6 , i.e. subgap bound states are practically irrelevant in this case .",
    "for this reason such states are missing , e.g. , in the aes action @xcite . on the other hand , at higher transmission values the energies of andreev levels ( [ and ] ) can be considerably lower than @xmath3 and may even tend to zero for fully open channels and @xmath9 .",
    "the presence of such subgap states may yield considerable changes in the behavior of ( relatively ) transparent superconducting contacts as compared to that of josephson tunnel junctions .",
    "recently the authors @xcite performed experiments aimed at directly detecting andreev levels by means of microwave spectroscopy of non - tunnel superconducting atomic contacts . in this work",
    "we will employ the effective action approach @xcite and develop a microscopic theory of andreev level spectroscopy in superconducting contacts with arbitrary distribution of transmission values @xmath10 . as a result of our analysis",
    ", we will formulate a number of predictions which would allow for explicit experimental verification of our theory .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in section",
    "ii we will specify the system under consideration and formulate the problem to be addressed in this work . in section iii we will employ our effective action formalism @xcite and evaluate the impedance of an effective environment formed by a system involving subgap andreev levels .",
    "these results will then be used in section iv in order to establish the @xmath11-function for our system and to determine the relative intensity of different current peaks in the subgap part of the @xmath0 curve .",
    "the effect of capacitance renormalization on both the positions and the heights of such peaks will be studied in section v , while in section vi we will address thermal broadening of these peaks .",
    "in section vii we will analyse the @xmath0 curve at larger voltages where quasiparticle tunneling dominates over that of cooper pairs .",
    "the paper will be concluded in section viii by a brief summary of our main observations .",
    "following the authors @xcite we will consider the circuit depicted in fig .",
    "this circuit can be divided into two parts .",
    "the part to the right of the vertical dashed line represents a superconducting loop pierced by an external magnetic flux @xmath12 .",
    "this loop includes a josephson tunnel junction with normal state resistance @xmath13 and josephson coupling energy @xmath14 connected to a non - tunnel superconducting contact thereby forming an asymmetric squid .",
    "the latter contact is characterized by an arbitrary set of transmissions @xmath10 of their transport channels and  provided the superconducting phase difference @xmath6 is imposed  may conduct the supercurrent @xcite @xmath15 where @xmath16 stands for the electron charge .",
    "below we will assume that temperature @xmath17 is sufficiently low @xmath18 and we will stick to the limit @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the normal state resistance of a non - tunnel contact . in this case",
    "the critical current of the josephson tunnel junction @xmath21 strongly exceeds that of the non - tunnel superconducting contact @xmath22 . in this limit",
    "the phase jump across the josephson junction is close to zero , while this jump across the non - tunnel contact is @xmath23 . here",
    "@xmath24 is the superconducting flux quantum , @xmath25 is the light velocity and the planck s constant is set equal to unity @xmath26 .    the remaining part of the circuit in fig",

    "bearing in mind the kinetic inductances of both the josephson element and the non - tunnel superconducting contact , to a certain approximation this environment can also be viewed as an effective @xmath39-contour . an important difference with the latter ,",
    "however , is the presence of extra quantum states  discrete andreev levels ( [ and ] )  inside the superconducting contact .",
    "hence , tunneling of a cooper pair can also be accompanied by upward transitions between these states and  along with the current peaks at voltages ( [ discv ] )  one can now expect the appearance of extra peaks at @xmath49    this simple consideration served as a basic principle for the andreev spectroscopy experiments @xcite as well as for their interpretation @xcite .",
