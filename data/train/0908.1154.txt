    "relativistic jets , which contain highly collimated streams of plasma travelling close to the speed of light , are commonly found in diverse astrophysical environments .",
    "they are associated with some extreme relativistic phenomena such as radio galaxies and quasars , microquasars , pulsars , supernovae and gamma ray bursts .",
    "bipolar jets in a radio galaxy or quasar are launched from the central region of an active galaxy , probably from a rotating magnetized accretion disk around a massive spinning black - hole , the `` central - engine '' @xcite .",
    "while astrophysical jets have begun to reveal their mysteries , many of their basic properties , such as their ejection , collimation , stability and composition , remain to be understood .",
    "fundamental questions raised by astrophysical jets include the roles of magnetic fields in their survival against internal instabilities out to distances approaching hundreds of kiloparsec from the galactic nucleus and in the formation of the radio hotspot and lobe due to the jet s termination .",
    "recently we have reported the discovery of a radio source associated with the bright elliptical galaxy ( at @xmath2 ) and displaying a unique combination of properties , including the largest detected radio jet @xcite .",
    "this extraordinary object was originally spotted by us serendipitously in the nvss database @xcite .",
    "thereafter , we imaged it with the gmrt ( fig .  1",
    ", at 1.3  ghz frequency , resolution 3to 11 ) and with the effelsberg radio telescope ( fig .  2 , at 8.4  ghz frequency , resolution 84 ) .",
    "we also took its optical spectrum with the 2-meter telescope recently set up by iucaa near pune ( india ) at girawali observatory . the massive elliptical galaxy hosting this radio source",
    "is projected 22(= 1.1 mpc ) away from the ( radio - quiet ) central elliptical galaxy of the rich cluster abell  2040 at @xmath3 .",
    "the @xmath48.6(= 440 kpc ) long radio jet terminates in an edge - brightened lobe , similar to a fanaroff - riley ii ( fr  ii ) radio - jet morphology ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "below we highlight a few striking properties of which , when taken together , set it apart from nearly all the known fr  ii radio galaxies :    @xmath5 its remarkably well collimated radio jet is not only the largest detected jet , it is also very strongly polarized ( @xmath620 to 50% at 8 ghz , inspite of the averaging by the large 84 beam ) .",
    "furthermore , the observed strong linear polarization and its orientation imply a well organized transverse ( toroidal ) magnetic field for this giant radio jet .",
    "the projected magnetic field orientation is predominantly orthogonal to the jet ( fig .",
    "[ f2 ] ) , contrary to the norm for fr  ii jets @xcite .",
    "thus , the jet appears to be a truly rare example where an extremely well ordered toroidal / helical magnetic field configuration is able to persist out to a scale @xmath7100  kpc from the nucleus .",
    "@xmath5 the radio lobe inflated by this giant jet is strikingly compact with hardly any back - flow",
    ". this could be result of  blocking \" of the back - flow of its synchrotron plasma by a toroidal magnetic field @xcite , as hinted to by the polarization map ( fig .",
    "[ f2 ] ) .    @xmath5",
    "the two radio jets appear quite similar upto the initial @xmath4100 kpc , but thereafter the northern jet undergoes an abrupt fading . any lobe formed by it could not be detected even in the effelsberg single - dish map , as well as gmrt and nvss maps ( fig .  1 and 2 ) .",
    "this implies an extreme factor ( @xmath8 ) for the lobe flux asymmetry .",
    "thus , contrary to the nearly universal trend , the brightness contrast between the two opposite sides of this double radio source _ increases _ with distance from the nucleus .",
    "@xmath5 the optical spectrum reveals that the host galaxy harbours a supermassive nuclear black hole of mass @xmath9 m@xmath10 .",
    "this is reflected in the very large stellar velocity dispersion @xmath11 = 375@xmath1235 km s@xmath13 of absorption lines and large bulge luminosity in k - band ( @xmath14 , @xmath15 ) .",
    "@xmath5 the observed core - to - lobe flux density ratio , @xmath16 at 1.28 ghz is an extreme value ; for fr  ii radio galaxies with matching radio lobe power to cgcg  049 - 033 , @xmath17 is typically only @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "the large excess in @xmath17 , by a factor @xmath19 , could be attributed to relativistic beaming which can boost the core flux by a factor @xmath20 ( usually _ n_@xmath21 for compact flat - spectrum jets , and the doppler factor is @xmath22^{-1}$ ] , where @xmath23 is the bulk speed of jet and @xmath24 , the bulk lorentz - factor ) .",
    "the corresponding viewing angle @xmath25 of the nuclear jet @xcite : cos ( @xmath25 ) = @xmath26/\\sqrt{f}$ ] , is then quite small ( @xmath25 28@xmath27 , for @xmath28 1 ) .",
    "such small angles are jointly disfavored by the projected giant radio size , the apparent symmetry of the inner jets and the identification with a galaxy @xcite .",
    "jet bending on parsec scale can result in a strongly doppler boosted nuclear jet ( despite the large projected size of source ) .",
    "however , the observed straightness and good alignment of the inner kiloparsec jets disfavor this scenario ( fig .  [ f1 ] ) .",
    "a higher resolution mapping of the polarization structure of the jets and the radio lobe will reveal what role a toroidal / helical magnetic field might play in stabilizing this remarkable radio jet upto an unprecedented scale of @xmath4400 kpc .",
    "the observed quasi - regularly spaced ( @xmath29 kpc ) sequence of radio knots ( fig .",
    "1 ) as well as its excellent collimation make this mega - jet a prime target for probing jet confinement mechanisms . a deeper radio imaging of this jet could be used to test viability of the theory of jet stabilization upto @xmath7100 kpc scales via a spine - sheath type flow @xcite , or the jet collimation by a surrounding high pressure ambient medium , leading to a sequence of reconfinement shocks @xcite . an x - ray imaging study with _",
    "chandra _ of the inner @xmath4100 kpc scale jet and counter - jet region , the associated agn and the hot gaseous halo of the host galaxy is being planned .",
    "we thank the operations teams of the gmrt ( ncra  tifr ) , effelsberg ( mpifr ) and iucaa girawali observatory ( igo ) for help during observations ."
