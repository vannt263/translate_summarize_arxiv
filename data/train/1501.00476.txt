    "the main purpose of this article is to study aspects of ` locality ' for the connective constants of cayley graphs of finitely presented groups .",
    "the locality question may be posed as follows : if two cayley graphs are locally isomorphic in the sense that they agree on a large ball centred at the identity , then are their connective constants close in value ? the current work may be viewed as a continuation of the study of locality for connective constants of quasi - transitive graphs reported in @xcite .",
    "the locality of critical points is a well developed topic in the theory of disordered systems , and the reader is referred , for example , to @xcite for related work about percolation on cayley graphs .",

    "this is proved subject to a condition on @xmath1 and @xmath5 , namely that they support so - called unimodular graph height functions.    cayley graphs of finitely generated groups provide a category of transitive graphs of special interest .",
    "they possess an algebraic structure in addition to their graphical structure , and this algebraic structure provides a mechanism for the study of their graph height functions .",

    "the study of the existence and structure of non - constant harmonic functions on cayley graphs has acquired prominence in geometric group theory through the work of kleiner and others , see @xcite .",
