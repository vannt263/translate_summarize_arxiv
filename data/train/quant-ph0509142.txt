    "recently , generation of entanglement in atomic systems has been intensely paid attention to because of the motivations in the potential applications in quantum information@xcite and computation processing@xcite .",
    "the realization of easily controllable atomic entangled states turns out to be one of the crucial and challenging tasks .",
    "a number of shcemes of generating entanglement between atoms have been put forward to realizing quantum teleportation@xcite and swapping@xcite . in many of the cases ,",
    "atoms are trapped in cavities or potential wells so that they can be connected through directly exchanging real photons and then they can be strongly entangled . while , practical applications in quantum information processing require _ engineering _ entangled atoms@xcite .",
    "this expects operable atoms so that they can be moved to distance without losing of information . to overcome this obstacle ,",
    "many schemes have been proposed@xcite , for example , in ref .",
    "[ 12 ] , the atoms are assumed to move in and out of the optical cavities and precisely received by detectors , maximum entanglement ( me ) are acquired by fixing controlling time . in this paper",
    ", we propose a simple scheme to realize an easily engineered two - atom entangled state .",
    "the advantage of this scheme is only one atom is trapped in a cavity , and the other one can be spatially moved freely outside the cavity .",
    "further more , the amount of the entanglement can be manually tuned by adjusting some key observable variables of the system .",
    "we consider a system constituted by two two - level identical atoms ( 1 , 2 ) and a single mode electromagnetic cavity field , as is shown in fig .",
    "atom 1 resonantly interacting with the cavity field ( sinelike line in the diagram ) is trapped in a slender microcavity .",
    "atom 2 lies beside atom 1 out of the cavity .",
    "we assume the cavity is so much narrow that atom 2 is close to atom 1 .",
    "if the relative distance of two atoms and the de broglie wavelength of two atoms can compare , the dipole - dipole interaction ( dashed line connecting two atoms in the diagram ) should be included .",
    "the whole device is located in vacuum .",
    "the hamiltonian of this system can be written as@xmath0where @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 are spin operators and raising ( lowering ) operators of atom @xmath5 and @xmath6 respectively , @xmath7 , ( @xmath8 ) is the creation ( annihilation ) operator of field , @xmath9 is the coupling strength of atom 1 to field , while @xmath10 is the coefficient of atom - atom dipole - dipole interaction which has been considered by many authors@xcite . in the invariant sub - space of the global system , we can choose a set of complete basis of atom - field system as @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 .",
    "on this basis , the hamiltonian of the system can be written as@xmath15    we can easily get four eigenvalues of this hermite hamiltonian as@xmath16where , @xmath17 , @xmath18 with @xmath19 , @xmath20 .",
    "also , the corresponding four eigenvectors are    @xmath21\\ ] ]    with @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) satisfy @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28}{\\sqrt{n+2}g\\gamma } $ ] , @xmath29}{\\sqrt{n+1}\\sqrt{n+2}% g^{2}\\gamma } $ ] , where @xmath30 for odd @xmath31 and @xmath32 for even @xmath31 .    for a given initial state @xmath33 of system",
    ", we can obtain the evoluted dressed state of system @xmath34 which is controlled by an unitary transformation @xmath35 .",
    "also , @xmath34 can be expanded as a superposition of eigenstates @xmath36@xmath37the coefficients @xmath38 are determined by solving schrodinger eqution , so that@xmath39the reduced density matrix of two - atom is obtained by tracing over the field variables of system density matrix @xmath40 , that is @xmath41 .",
    "the initial condition @xmath42 is easily given for an initial system state @xmath43 .    in the next section , we will discuss the two - atom entanglement induced by the dipole - dipole interaction between atoms .",
    "wootters concurrence , which has been proved to be effective in measuring the entanglement of two qubits , is defined as@xcite@xmath44where @xmath45 are four non - negative squre roots of the eigenvalues of the non - hermitian matrix @xmath46 in decreasing order . in dealing with this model , the concurrence",
    "is simply determined by several density matrix elements since most of the off - diagonal elements are eliminated due to the adiabatic evolution .",
    "we choose the initial system state is a separable pure state as@xmath47    then the evolution of system state is determined by a series of parameters space @xmath48 , @xmath9 , @xmath49 .",
    "2 shows two - atom entanglement under parameters space @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 for solid line and @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath53 for dashed line .",
    "generally , the entanglement shows local peaks , all the peaks present to be covered under series of wave packets .",
    "this is caused by the rabi oscillation of atoms , and in fact the synchronization difference between the coupling of atom 1 to field and atom 1 to atom 2 .",
    "the curves show that _ larger _ dipole - dipole interaction can improve the local peak of the entanglement but take no effect on the width of the peak of the amount of entanglement .",
    "physically , dipole - dipole interaction @xmath10 can be enhanced by reducing the relative distance between two atoms or increasing the dipole polar moment for each atom@xcite .",
    "3 shows the influence of different coupling of atom 1 to cavity on the two - atom entanglement under same dipole - dipole coupling strength .",
    "surprisingly , weak atom - field coupling amplifies the packets of the entanglement so that the amount and the width of each peak of the entanglement are both enlarged .",
    "especially , the first packet of the entanglement is amplified most evidently . since the coupling of intro - cavity atom and cavity depends on the relative position of atom , @xmath54 , in the cavity , such that @xmath55 $ ] with @xmath56 the peak coupling rate , @xmath57 and @xmath58 the wave vector and width of the cavity mode@xcite .",
    "the ideal case would be fixing the atom to keep @xmath9 a constant so that the controlling time of peak entanglement can be precisely operated .    in fig .",
    "4 , we depict the entanglement under different intro - cavity field densities @xmath59 .",
    "the alternating of field density does not seem to take influence on the local peak of the amount of the entanglement . while , the width of the packet is slightly broadened for larger @xmath59 . to distinctly represent the entanglement under this situation , we illustrate two - atom entanglement versus initial field density and dipole - dipole interaction strength in fig .",
    "5 . in computing the results , the controlling time is restricted to be @xmath60 . note that the mecan never be reached when @xmath10 is small for arbitrary @xmath59 .",
    "surprisingly , the local peak entanglement arises for a series of fixed @xmath59 whatever the value of @xmath10 be , for example , the first peak emerges at about @xmath61 , the second at about @xmath62 .",
    "this suggests us the initial field density acts as a tuning switch that discretely controls the generation of me at any specific time whatever the dipole - dipole interaction strength be .",
    "certainly , appropriate @xmath10 is optimal , since the mearises at about @xmath63 when @xmath64 and @xmath65 , in this system .",
    "we proposed a simple scheme to entangle two two - level atoms that can be realized physically .",
    "the hamiltonian for the system was diagonalized to obtain the eigenvalues . for a given initial global state ,",
    "the evolutive state of the two - atom subsystem was found to be entangled .",
    "the amount of the entanglement is presented to depend on the coupling strength @xmath9 of intra - cavity atom to field and the atomic dipole - dipole interaction strength @xmath10 . it was found that larger @xmath10 and smaller @xmath9 benefit the quantity and quality of peak entanglement .",
    "when these two characters were fixed , the entanglement would be determined by the cavity field density and the controlling time . and",
    "for a fixed controlling time , the me took place at a series of discrete field density intervals . from this point of view",
    ", the field density @xmath59 acts as a me generation tuning switch .",
    "the advantage of this scheme is the extra - cavity atom can be moved so that the relative distance between two atoms can be controlled , then @xmath10 is controllable .",
    "also , field density @xmath59 can be alternated using high quality laser jet .",
    "so , this device may be further developed into an engineered atom - atom entangler .",
