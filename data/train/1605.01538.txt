    "the gs equation governs the axisymmetric mhd equilibria of static plasmas .",
    "essentially it is a second order elliptic , generally nonlinear pde , whose solutions reveal the topology of the magnetic field on the poloidal cross section of a toroidal plasma . in the case of incompressible flows , parallel to the magnetic field ,",
    "the equation remains identical in form @xcite .",
    "also , in @xcite and @xcite the equation was further generalized for incompressible flows of arbitrary direction with an additional @xmath0-term associated with the equilibrium electric field ( see also eq .",
    "( [ gen_gs ] ) below ) . in cylindrical coordinates",
    "@xmath1 the gs equation takes the familiar form @xmath2 with @xmath3 , @xmath4 being free - arbitrary functions which respectively are related to the poloidal current and the plasma pressure .",
    "specifically @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the pressure in the absence of macroscopic flows . in the presence of field aligned",
    "flows the total plasma pressure is given by the bernoulli equation @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the magnitude of flow velocity and @xmath9 the mass density .",
    "the dependent variable @xmath10 is related to the poloidal flux function @xmath11 through the transformation @xmath12^{1/2}ds\\ ] ] where @xmath13 is the poloidal mach function @xcite .",
    "once the free functions @xmath3 and @xmath4 are specified the solutions of ( [ gs ] ) provide us all the information about the macroscopic equilibrium properties of the magnetofluid .",
    "so far analytical solutions of ( [ gs ] ) have been constructed and studied extensively for choices of constant @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "the corresponding solutions describe the so - called solovev equilibrium , which is characterized by monotonic current density and safety factor profiles .",
    "solutions for free functions proportional to @xmath10 , expressed in terms of coulomb or whittaker wave functions , have been obtained for the first time by hernneger @xcite and independently by maschke @xcite .",
    "the work of atanasiu et al @xcite was focused on the case of free functions linear in @xmath10 , computing the required particular solutions of the inhomogeneous pde with a series - expansion - based technique .",
    "wang @xcite employing also linear ansatzes , reduced the gs equation into a helmholtz equation and derived analytical solutions describing equilibria with toroidal current reversals ( tcr ) .",
    "in addition , particularly limited progress has been made in the analytical integration of ( [ gs ] ) for nonlinear free functions ; in the works of cicogna and pegoraro @xcite classical and non - classical symmetries of special nonlinear forms of the gs equation were exploited for the derivation of analytical solutions .",
    "these solutions were implemented on the construction of nonlinear equilibria .    in this letter , exploiting the translational symmetry of the gs equation , we convert it into a system of two first order pdes .",
    "this system contains all solutions of the gs equation and thus the original problem is reduced to the solution of the two first order pdes .",
    "this is a quite interesting procedure since in several cases it might be more convenient to seek solutions or reduction ansatzes of the reduced equations rather than of the original pde . in our case it was nt difficult to find a simple ansatz to further reduce this system .",
    "we show that the original pde results in a single ode in terms of a reduction variable which depends on the choice of the aforementioned ansatz .",
    "this procedure serves as a prototype for algorithmic derivation of reductions , that can possibly be exploited employing additional symmetries which are admitted for some particular choices of the free functions . regarding the derived solutions , in the linear case the principle of superposition allows a linear combination of the derived solutions which results in magnetic configurations with closed and nested magnetic surfaces , essential for the confinement in fusion devices .",
    "however this is not the case for the corresponding nonlinear solutions and therefore the magnetic field configurations do not form closed surfaces .",
    "a similarity reduction is a procedure by which one may find a  grouping \" of the independent variables so as to assume a functional form of the solution that enables the original pde to be reduced to a simpler form , usually to an ode .",
    "our treatment which finds such a reduction form for the grad ",

    "diffusion equations by a method known as  group foliation \" . in general",
    "a group foliation converts a pde into an equivalent system of lower order pdes , called group resolving system , whose independent and dependent variables correspond respectively to the invariants and the differential invariants of a given infinitesimal symmetry generator . in other words",
    "a group of point symmetry transformations induces a foliation of the solution space .",
    "each solution of the group resolving system corresponds to a one - parameter family of exact solutions of the original pde .",
    "the interested reader may refer to @xcite and @xcite .",
    "in our case due to the arbitrariness of the free functions @xmath3 and @xmath4 the only symmetry which is admitted in general by the gs equation is the z - translational symmetry . we show that exploiting this symmetry and following the treatment described in @xcite we can reduce eq .",

    "@xmath15 this method yields similarity reductions of the gs equation .",
    "the invariants @xmath16 of @xmath17 satisfy @xmath18 . in the space of independent and dependent variables @xmath19 we can identify two such invariants namely @xmath20 and @xmath21 . the differential invariants @xmath22 of the z - symmetry infinitesimal generator are quantities invariant under the action of @xmath17 on the extended , by the first order derivatives of @xmath10 , space that is @xmath23 .",
    "we are making use of a mixed notation for the partial derivatives so as to underline the fact that @xmath24 and @xmath25 serve also as new variables .",
    "the action of @xmath17 on the extended space is realized through its first order prolongation @xmath26 which for the translation symmetry is @xmath17 itself i.e. @xmath27 . for a detailed description one may refer to @xcite and @xcite",
    ". therefore the additional invariants provided by the action of @xmath17 on the extended space are @xmath28 , @xmath29 .",
    "obviously the relation @xmath30 must hold and the invariantized variables should also satisfy eq .",

    "hence we obtain the following system of two coupled pdes for the functions @xmath31 and @xmath32 @xmath33 called translation group resolving system ( grs ) .",
    "the grs can easily be reduced into a system of odes , employing the ansatz @xmath34 , @xmath35 where @xmath36 , @xmath37 are constants .",
