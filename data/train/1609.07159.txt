    "the interstellar medium ( ism ) plays a central role in the evolution of galaxies .",
    "the formation of new stars slowly consumes the ism , locking it up for millions to billions of years while stars , as they age , return much of their mass increased in metallicity , back to the ism",
    ". stars also inject radiative and kinetic energy into the ism and this controls the physical characteristics ( density , temperature and pressure ) as well as the dynamics of the gas as revealed in observed spectra .",
    "this interplay of stars and surrounding gas leads to the presence of distinct phases ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "diffuse atomic clouds ( the cold neutral medium , cnm ) have densities of about @xmath1 and temperatures of about @xmath2 , where atomic hydrogen is largely neutral but carbon is singly ionized by photons with energies between @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "the warmer ( @xmath5 ) and more tenuous ( @xmath6 ) intercloud phase [ the warm neutral medium ( wnm ) and warm ionized medium ( wim ) ] is heated and ionized by fuv and euv photons escaping from hii regions @xcite . while these phases are often considered to be in thermal equilibrium and in pressure balance , the observed large turbulent width and presence of gas at thermally unstable",
    ", intermediate temperatures may indicate that kinetic energy input is important .",
    "thermally unstable gas could indicate that the gas does not have sufficient time to cool between subsequent passages of a shock or after intermittent dissipation of turbulence ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , the ism also hosts molecular clouds , where hydrogen is in the form of @xmath7 and self - gravity plays an important role .",
    "all of these phases are directly tied to key questions on the origin and evolution of the ism , including energetics of the cnm , wnm and the wim ; the evolutionary relationship of atomic and molecular gas ; the relationship of these ism phases with newly formed stars ; and the conversion of their radiative and kinetic power into thermal and turbulent energy of the ism ( e.g. @xcite ) .    the diffuse interstellar medium has been long studied using , in particular , the 21 cm hyperfine transition of neutral atomic hydrogen ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "these observations have revealed the prevalence of a two phase structure in the interstellar medium of cold clouds embedded in a warm intercloud medium .",
    "however , it has been notoriously difficult to determine the physical characteristics ( density , temperature ) of these structures in the ism as hi by itself does not provide a good probe .",
    "optical and uv observations of atomic lines can provide the physical conditions but are by necessity limited to pinpoint experiments towards bright background sources .",
    "however , with the opening up of the low frequency radio sky with modern interferometers such as the low frequency array for radioastronomy ( lofar , @xcite ) , murchison wide field array @xcite , long wavelength array @xcite and , in the future , the square kilometer array ( ska ) , systematic surveys of low frequency ( @xmath8 ) carbon radio recombination lines ( crrls ) have come in reach and these surveys can be expected to quantitatively measure the conditions in the emitting gas @xcite .",
    "carbon has a lower ionization potential ( 11.2 ev ) than hydrogen and can be ionized by radiation fields in regions where hydrogen is largely neutral .",
    "recombination of carbon ions with electrons to high rydberg states will lead to crrls in the sub - millimeter to decameter range .",
    "crrls have been observed in the interstellar medium of our galaxy towards two types of clouds : diffuse clouds ( e.g. : @xcite ) and photodissociation regions ( pdrs ) , the boundaries of hii regions and their parent molecular clouds ( e.g. : @xcite ) .",
    "recently , @xcite discovered extragalactic crrls associated with the nucleus of the nearby starburst galaxy , m82 .",
    "theoretical models for crrls were first developed by @xcite and @xcite , including the effects of dielectronic recombination with the simultaneous excitation of the @xmath9 fine - structure level and later extended by @xcite and by @xcite .",
    "however , these studies were hampered by the limited computer resources available at that time .    in the coming years",
    ", we will use lofar to carry out a full northern hemisphere survey of crrl emitting clouds in the milky way .",
    "this will allow us to study the thermal balance , chemical enrichment and ionization rate of the cold neutral medium from degree - scales down to scales corresponding to individual clouds and filaments in our galaxy .",
    "furthermore , following the first detection of low - frequency crrls in an extragalactic source ( m82 ; @xcite ) we will also use lofar to perform the first flux limited survey of crrls in extragalactic sources . given the renewed observational interest in crrls , a new theoretical effort seems warranted . in the first paper of this series , ( @xcite , hereafter paper  i ) , we studied the level population of hydrogenic atoms including the effects of dielectronic recombination in carbon atoms .",
    "the level population of atoms , however , is not the only process that influences the strength of an observed line as radiative transfer effects can alter the strength / depth of an observed line . in this paper",
    ", we use the results of paper  i to develop crrls as a tool to derive the physical conditions in the emitting gas . in this",
    ", we will focus on cold diffuse clouds as these are expected to dominate the low frequency crrl sky .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ section_radtransf ] we review radiative transfer theory in the context of radio recombination lines .",
    "we review the line broadening mechanisms of crrls in section [ section_lineprofile ] . in section [ section_results",
    "] , we present the results of our models and compare them with observations from the literature and provide guidelines to analyze such observations .",
    "finally , in section [ section_conclusions ] , we summarize our results and provide the conclusions of our work .",
    "the physical conditions of the diffuse interstellar medium ( temperatures of @xmath10 and electron densities @xmath11 ) favor an increase in the level population at high quantum levels via dielectronic recombination ( paper  i ) .",
    "moreover , the presence of an external radiation field can also alter the level population of carbon atoms .",
    "in addition , while low frequency crrls are observed in absorption against a background continuum ( e.g. @xcite ) , high frequency recombination lines are observed in emission .",
    "therefore , radiative transfer effects must be analyzed in order to derive meaningful physical parameters from observations .",
    "we begin our analysis by revisiting the radiative transfer problem in the context of crrls . at a given frequency , the observed emission has two components , corresponding to the line transition itself and the underlying continuum emission . in appendix",

    "when the @xmath32 factor in equation  [ eqn_integlinetocont ] is positive ( negative ) the line is in absorption ( emission ) .",

    "low frequency observations can , thus , provide an upper limit on the density and radiation field .",
    "as illustrated in figure  [ fig_widthdiff ] , the transition from a doppler to a lorentzian broadened line is quite rapid ( in frequency space ) but the actual value of @xmath55 where it occurs depends on the physical conditions of the cloud ( i.e. @xmath133 ) .    in figure  [ fig_widthdiff ]",
