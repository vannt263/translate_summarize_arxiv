    "the interchain , interplane transport of electrons in low dimensional ( quasi 1d , 2d ) materials attracts much attention @xcite in view of striking differences between longitudinal and transverse transport mechanisms revealing a general problematics of strongly correlated electronic systems . beyond the low field ( linear ) conduction , the tunnelling current - voltage j - u characteristics @xmath0 , @xmath1 are of particular importance .",
    "the interest has been renewed thanks to recently developed @xcite design of intrinsic tunnelling devices where electronic transitions between weakly coupled chains or planes take place in the bulk of the unperturbed material .",
    "the first feature one expects to see at any tunnelling experiment in gapful conductors is the regime of free electrons when the current onset corresponds to the voltage @xmath2 of the gap in the spectrum of electrons .",
    "but contrarily to usual systems , like semi- or even superconductors , there is also a possibility for tunnelling within the subgap region @xmath3 .",
    "it is related to the pseudogap ( pg ) phenomenon known for strongly correlated electrons in general , well pronounces in quasi 1d systems and particularly in cases where the gap is opened by a spontaneous symmetry breaking ( see @xcite and refs . therein ) .",
    "the pg is originated by a difference , sometimes qualitative , between three forms of electronic states : a ) short living excitations which are close to free electrons , b ) dressed stationary excitations of the correlated systems , and c ) added particles which modify the ground state itself @xcite . for our typical examples of electrons on a flexible lattice , the modification results in self - trapped states ( b ) like single particle @xmath4 polarons with energies @xmath5 below the single electron ( a ) activation energy @xmath6 ; then the new gap @xmath7 will be observed as a true threshold with the pg in between .",
    "there may be also contributions of two - particle @xmath8 states ( c ) - bipolarons , which energy gain per electron is larger than for polarons @xmath9 .",
    "while the cases ( a , b ) are common for low symmetry and discrete symmetry cases , for ( c ) there is a further drastic effect of a spontaneous symmetry breaking like the case of the polyacethylene @xmath10 or of some doubly commensurate cdws .",
    "now the bipolarons are decoupled into particles with a nontrivial topology , solitons or kinks , changing the sign of the order parameter of the dimerization .",
    "the situation is further intricate in systems with a continuous gs degeneracy like incommensurate charge density waves ( icdw ) or wigner crystals .",
    "here even the self - trapping of a single electron is allowed to lead to topologically nontrivial states , the amplitude solitons ass . in the same class",
    "we find a more common case of acoustic polarons in a 1d semiconductor @xcite .",
    "properties of systems with different types of the gs degeneracy , and required theoretical approaches , are quite different . here",
    "we shall concentrate on systems with a discrete , precisely double , degeneracy which also include most basic elements of non - degenerate systems .",
    "theoretically , the tunnelling in cdws was studied in details for regimes of free electrons @xcite when the current onset corresponds to the voltage @xmath2 of the gap in the spectrum of electrons .",
    "we shall consider the tunnelling in the pg regime .",
    "we shall follow the method @xcite developed for studies of single particle spectral density @xmath11 in applications to pes and arpes intensities .",
    "we refer to this publication for details in techniques and literature .    a word of notations . in the following we shall invoke many quantities with the dimension of energy ( or frequency , since we shall keep @xmath12 ) which will be classified according to different characters ( with indices ) .",
    "@xmath13 and @xmath14 will be the external voltage difference for tunnelling and the external frequency for pes or optics .",
    "@xmath15 will always stay for electronic eigenvalue in a given potential , negative values will be addressed explicitly as @xmath16 .",
    "@xmath17 will be branches of a total energy ( of deformations together with electronic energies ) supporting eigenstates @xmath18 which may be filled with occupation numbers @xmath19 .",
    "@xmath20 will be total energies of stationary states , that is @xmath21 .",
    "@xmath22 will be the frequency of a collective mode ( phonons specifically to cdws ) which interaction with electrons is responsible for their self - trapping .",
    "the collective deformation @xmath23 will also be measured as the potential energy experienced by electrons .",
    "we shall keep the electron charge @xmath24 hence potentials will be measured as energies and the interchain current @xmath25 will have the dimension _ number - of - particles / unit - time / unit - length_. the indices @xmath26 will number coupled chains ; indices @xmath27 will number moments @xmath28 of time for virtual processes .",
    "a possibility of tunnelling or of other excitations within the gap in spectra of free electrons @xmath29 is related to a more general phenomenon of the pseudogap pg . for electrons ,",
    "the pg signifies the remnants of the spectral density @xmath30 , or the integrated one @xmath31 , at @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the absolute boundary of the spectrum .",
    "@xmath33 is the energy of a fully dressed state of one electron interacting with other degrees of freedom .",
    "( there may be totally external modes like deformations or polarizations for usual polarons , external modes essentially modified by the bath of electrons like in cdws , internal collective modes of electronic system itself like in sdws . ) most commonly , the self - trapped state of one electron is known as the `` polaron '' while more complex objects , solitons , can appear for systems with continuously degenerate gss ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "the functions @xmath34 and @xmath30 are measured directly in pes and arpes experiments ( these abbreviations stay for the integrated photo - emission spectroscopy and for the angle ( that is momentum ) resolved one ) . as such",
    "they have been studied theoretically for the pg region by the present authors @xcite and we refer to these publications for a more comprehensive discussion and for the literature review .",
    "the one electron spectra can be accessed also in traditional external tunnelling experiments : junctions or stm . for the last case , and",
    "practically for macroscopic point junctions , only the integrated @xmath34 is measured .",
    "elements of the full dependence @xmath30 become necessary to describe strongly anisotropic materials ( layered quasi-2d or chain quasi-1d ones ) where the coherent tunnelling is realized in internal junctions of `` mesa '' type devices @xcite . here",
    "the tunnelling goes between adjacent layers within the single crystal of the same material , hence the momentum is preserved . in a simpler version ,",
    "the internal subgap tunnelling takes place from free electrons of some metallic bands or pockets to polaronic states within gapful spectra which probably takes place in @xmath35 @xcite .",
    "otherwise it measures actually the joint spectral density for creation a particle - hole excitation at adjacent chains ( the interchain exciton ) . in this respect",
    "it will be instructive to compare the coherent tunnelling and the subgap optical absorption oa ( see a short excursion and references in @xcite , iii.e ) .",
    "a less expected version of the internal tunnelling is a possibility for bi - electronic transfers ( tunnelling of bipolarons or of kink - antikink pairs ) which usually is attributed only to superconductors .",
    "we shall see that these processes extend the pg further down to even lower voltages .    in any case , the tunnelling current @xmath0 is given by the transition rate of electrons between two subsystems @xmath36 kept at the potential difference @xmath37 . for a weak coupling @xmath38 , the electron tunnelling from @xmath39 to @xmath40 is given by the convolution of spectral densities @xmath41 if the momentum is conserved , or of their integrals @xmath42 for the incoherent tunnelling .",
    "( everywhere we assume @xmath43 . )",
    "recall that for free electrons with a spectrum @xmath44 we have @xmath45 while @xmath34 becomes the dos @xmath46 , e.g. for @xmath47 @xmath48 near the bottom of the free band where the electron effective mass is @xmath49 .",
    "consider briefly the case where one of reservoirs , say @xmath50 , is composed by free electrons with a known dos @xmath51 .",
    "one of applications of a tunnelling between the free spectrum and the pg may be the case of several families of conjugated polymers ( polypyrolle , polythiophene ) where origins of filled , @xmath52 or empty , @xmath53 bands below and above the gap are essentially different .",
    "then the polaronic effect , hence the pg , may be pronounced only for one type of particles : electrons or holes .",
    "the same concerns 1d systems made of semiconducting wires where both effective masses and deformation potentials for electrons and holes are usually very different .",
    "then , for the incoherent tunnelling , @xmath54 gives directly either the tunnelling current @xmath55 ( if @xmath56 has a sharp peak at the fermi level , which is typical for using junctions with superconductors ) or the tunnelling differential conductance @xmath57 ( if @xmath58 at the fermi surface ) .    below we shall be mostly interested in systems with the charge conjugated symmetry ( or qualitatively equivalent ones ) ; the examples are carbon nanotubes , symmetric conjugated polymers like polyphenylenes , polyanilines and polymers where the gap is formed ( partly at least ) by the spontaneous symmetry breaking : the polyacethylenes ( @xcite ) .",
    "numerical details will be presented for the last rich case . in all these cases",
    "the pg  will exist near both rimes @xmath59 of the free excitation gap @xmath60 .",
    "recall now some known results for @xmath34 within the pg @xcite .",
    "it has the form @xmath61 where the action @xmath62 is proportional to the big parameter of our adiabatic approximation : @xmath63 .",
    "@xmath64 is determined by an optimal fluctuation localized in space and time ( an instanton ) which supports the necessary split - off local level @xmath65 . in principle",
    ", the prefactor @xmath66 also depends on @xmath67 and may show power law dependencies near extremals @xmath68 .",
    "but within constraints of the adiabatic approximation @xmath69 the dependence @xmath70 is negligible in comparison with the one of @xmath64 .",
    "the characteristic value of @xmath71 may be important for estimates of the overall magnitude of observable effects .",

    "the resulting curve is plotted at the figure [ fig : s4pol ] .",
    "moreover , the regime ( 1 . ) can be mapped exactly @xcite upon the problem of a particle in a quenched random uncorrelated potential which here is created by instantaneous quantum fluctuations of the media .",

    "it is instructive to compare the interchain tunnelling probability with the on chain interband optical absorption oa when the matrix element of density @xmath83 changes to the one of the momentum : @xmath84 . in both cases",
    "the @xmath85 pair is created and the same spectral densities are involved .",
    "the difference is in matrix elements : the oa takes place between states of opposite parity while the tunnelling requires for the same parity .",
    "the on - chain oa between edges @xmath86 of the free gap is known to be allowed since the parity of states near @xmath86 is opposite , hence @xmath87 is finite and the oa intensity as a function of frequency @xmath88 rises as @xmath89 .",
    "but for the same reason , the tunnelling matrix element between identical chains is prohibited at @xmath90 and the tunnelling will show only a weak edge onset @xmath91 .",
    "nevertheless , in many cases of gaps opened due to spontaneous dimerization , the neighboring chains tend to order in antiphase .",

    "( actually , in view of the time reversion symmetry , the number of boundary conditions is twice smaller . )",
    "a similar analysis of the extremal solution shows that optimal fluctuations @xmath177 are identical in shape , up to shifts of their centra : @xmath181 , @xmath245 .",
    "hence the energies are identical @xmath246 , and also the resonance conditions @xmath247 take place at the impact moments @xmath28 .",
    "moreover , the simple hierarchy of our model @xmath248 shows that all branches @xmath17 cross at the same point @xmath249 ( see figures [ fig : u12],[fig : u14],[fig : u18 ] below ) .",
    "then the evolution @xmath141 switches directly from the branch @xmath250 to the branch @xmath8 and back , without following the intermediate branch @xmath4 .",
    "it means that the intervals @xmath251 and @xmath252 of one - electron transfers @xmath4 are confined to zero : @xmath253 .",
    "in other words , only processes of simultaneous tunnelling of pairs of particles are left .",
    "notice that this picture changes in more general models , particularly taking into account important coulomb interactions .",
    "they add , to the energy branch of a shallow bipolaron , the energy @xmath254 where @xmath255 is the dielectric susceptibility of the media in the interchain direction , @xmath256 is the localization length of @xmath257 , such that @xmath258 . now the intermediate intervals @xmath259,@xmath260 appear where the evolution follows the @xmath4 branches , see figure [ fig : u16+c ] . with increasing coulomb interactions this single particle interval becomes more pronounced and the bipolaronic threshold is shifted towards the one of two independent polarons .    in any case , the extremum solution for the action ( [ 2e ] ) is achieved on the instanton trajectory given be the equation @xmath261 the extremal action is @xmath262 this action is finite if the turning point @xmath263 does exist , that is if @xmath264 .",
    "notice that , neglecting coulomb interactions , the energy @xmath166 is determined only by the total number @xmath265 of electrons and holes .",
    "then the energy of the bipolaron ( both @xmath266 and @xmath267 are either empty or doubly occupied ) and the energy of the exciton ( both @xmath268 and @xmath269 are singly occupied ) are the same .",
    "then the trajectory of the bi - electronic tunnelling becomes the same as the one for the case of optical absorption @xcite , only the action is doubled @xmath270 . up to the pre - exponential factor",
    "we have @xmath271^{2},\\]]where @xmath272 is the optical absorption probability for one chain .    for common systems with a nondegenerate ground state ,",
    "the dependence @xmath273 resembles qualitatively the law [ j1low ] for the one - electron contribution , with a similar behavior near the threshold @xmath274 .",
    "the situation changes for a doubly degenerate ground state where the bipolaron dissolves into a diverging pair of solitons ( dimerization kinks ) .",
    "thus for the peierls model the evaluation of ( [ s2(u ) ] ) gives , similar to the oa law of @xcite , near the two particle threshold @xmath275 with @xmath276 .",
    "the overall dependence for the @xmath277 is shown at the figure [ fig : s4sol ] . here",
    "we see explicitly that in the order @xmath240 the threshold voltage @xmath278 is smaller than @xmath279 obtained in the order @xmath280 .",
    "therefore this is the main contribution to the current in the region @xmath281 .",
    "figure [ fig : s4sol ] shows that the dependence of @xmath282 near the low @xmath37 onset is much sharper than that of @xmath0 at the figure [ fig : s4pol ] near the polaronic onset which corresponds to the higher singularity in the limiting formula ( [ j2min ] ) in compare to ( [ j1low ] ) .",
    "in quasi 1d systems with a gapful electronic spectrum , the interchain tunnelling ( as well as pes or oa ) can be used to test virtual electronic states within the pseudogap . due to the interaction of electrons with a low frequency mode , phonons in our examples ,",
    "the tunnelling is allowed in the subgap region @xmath283 which forms the pseudogap .",
    "the one electron processes lead to universal results similar both for systems with the build - in gap and for those where the gap is due to the spontaneous breaking of a discrete symmetry .",
    "the pg is entered with the law ( [ nh ] ) and continues down to the threshold @xmath284 , approached with the law ( [ nl ] ) .",
    "this threshold corresponds to the interchain transfer of fully dressed particles : polarons with the energies @xmath33 .",
    "but in tunnelling the pg is stretched even further down thanks to processes of a simultaneous tunnelling of two electrons .",
    "it terminates at the lower threshold @xmath285 or @xmath286 , @xmath287 . here",
    "@xmath288 is the energy of the bipolaron - a bound state of two electrons selftrapped together . in degenerate systems the bipolaron dissolves into unbound solitons , hence the threshold at @xmath289 with a more pronounced dependence of the tunnelling rate ( [ j2min ] ) as well of the oa .",
    "numerical results are presented at figures [ fig : s4pol],[fig : s4sol ] .",
    "there is an important difference between subgap processes and the usual overgap transitions at @xmath290 of free electrons in a rigid system .",
    "it comes , beyond intensities , from different character of matrix elements . actually within the pg region",
    "there are no particular selection rules since the wave functions of virtual electronic states split off within the gap are localized having a broad distribution of momenta . then the pg absorption is allowed independent on the interchain ordering .",
    "contrarily , the regular tunnelling across the free gap shows an expected dos singularity @xmath291 for the out of phase interchain order while for the in - phase order the threshold is smooth @xmath292 .",
    "this difference may be important to choose an experimental system adequate for studies of pgs .",
    "the smearing of the free edge singularity is a natural criterium for existence of the pg below it @xcite .",
    "but the total absence of this strong feature in systems with forbidden overgap transitions can allow for a better resolution of the whole pg region , down to the absolute threshold .",
    "probably a very smooth manifestation of gaps in usual tunnelling experiments on cdws @xcite , while the gaps show up clearly through activation laws , is related to this smooth crossover from the overgap to the subgap region .",
    "( notice that the existing experiments refer mostly to icdws which , with their continuous degeneracy of the gs , must be studied specially which is beyond the scope of this article . )",
    "finally we shall discuss relations with other theoretical approaches .",
    "most theories of tunnelling , see @xcite , keep the following assumptions : i. they refer to the overgap region where interactions or fluctuations are not important and usually are not taken into account .",
    "they refer to the incoherent tunnelling , local in space , which is a usual circumstance of traditional experiments .",
    "the pg in tunnelling was considered by monz et al in @xcite in the framework of the approach @xcite .",
    "this method became popular recently in theories of the pg thanks to its easy implementation : it is sufficient to average results for a rigid system over a certain distribution of the gap values .",
    "apparently this is the way to describe an average over a set of measurements performed on similar systems with various values of the gap , e.g. manipulating with the temperature , the pressure or a composition .",
    "but actually , as we could see above , the pg is formed by fluctuations localized both in space and time , the instantons , with localization parameters depend on the energy deficit being tested .",
    "there is an intermediate approach applied @xcite to a complex of the pg phenomenon from optics to conductivity and susceptibility .",
    "it treats fluctuations as an instantaneous disorder due to quantum zero point fluctuations of the gap .",
    "indeed , this picture can be well applied , as it was done already in @xcite , but only to dynamical processes and only in the upper pg region , just below the free gap @xmath293 , which leads to the law ( [ nh ] ) .",
    "but deeper within the pg , the fluctuations are not instantaneous : they require for an increasingly longer time and become self - consistent with the measured electronic state leading to another law and to appearance of the lower threshold .",
    "generalizations and deeper analysis of the model of the instantaneous disorder lead to interesting theoretical studies @xcite , but their applicability is very limited unless the variable time scale is realized as we have demonstrated in this and preceding articles .    our approach can be compared to the work @xcite on the fluctuational creation of pairs of phase solitons in a 1d commensurate cdw under the longitudinal electric field .",
    "but in our case me deal , in effect , with the interchain tunnelling of pairs of solitons under the transverse field ; also the solitons have a more complex character of a multielectronic origin .    in conclusion ,",
    "the presented and earlier @xcite studies recall for the necessity of realizing the variable time scale of subgap processes both in theory and in diverse interpretations of different groups of experiments ( dynamic , kinetic , thermodynamic ) which address excitations with very different life times .",
