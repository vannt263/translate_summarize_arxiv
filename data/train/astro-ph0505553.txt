    "in the past several calculations concerning the role of magnetic reconnection in the vicinity of the heliopause have been performed .",
    "@xcite(and references therein ) calculated reconnection probabilities and gave estimations for reconnection rates , but without complete reconnection solutions of the nonideal mhd equations .",
    "here , we present a plane model of the heliosphere in the framework of stationary nonideal mhd .",
    "we assume that the tail direction is the direction of the @xmath2axis ( see figure [ parkerflow ] ) , which is also the direction of the asymptotical flow around the heliosphere .",
    "the direction of invariance is the @xmath3direction .",
    "results depend mainly on the tilt angle between the asymptotical magnetic field to the asymptotical plasma velocity .",
    "we concentrate on investigating the region where the interstellar plasma encounters the solar wind plasma .",
    "in our plane model of the heliosphere we make the following assumptions :    * we take only stationary fields , i.e. @xmath4 , and take : @xmath5 * incompressibility as a substitute for the energy equation is assumed .",
    "incompressibility here means that the density of a fluid element moving with the flow does not change in time meaning that the convective derivative @xmath6 vanishes . using the mass continuity @xmath7 we thus can derive with @xmath8 which implies @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "then we introduce the auxiliary flow field or streaming vector @xmath11 with @xmath12leading to @xmath13 .",
    "therefore , the basic mhd equations are given by the following set @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the thermal pressure and @xmath16 is the bernoulli pressure .",
    "@xmath17 is the part of the electric potential whose gradient gives the poloidal field components ( i.e. the components in @xmath2- and @xmath18-direction ) of the electric field , so that @xmath19 , and @xmath20 is a constant component of the electric field in the invariant @xmath3direction .",
    "this is to ensure that @xmath21 ( stationarity condition ) and to fulfill @xmath22 .",
    "@xmath23 is the nonidealness and the other symbols have their usual meaning .",
    "eq.([ohmresimhd1 ] ) is the generalized ohm s law ( see @xcite and @xcite ) . for @xmath24 and @xmath25",
    "we make the following ansatz : @xmath26 where the index p on the right hand side of these equations stands for the poloidal part of the magnetic and the velocity field , and @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 are functions of @xmath2 and @xmath18 . with these assumptions",
    "we find for the generalized ohm s law from eq.([ohmresimhd1 ] ) @xmath31 which results in @xmath32 the momentum balance equation eq.([bisimhd2 ] ) can be written as @xmath33 the problem here is to get rid of the @xmath3component on the right hand side of equation ( [ eulerink ] ) , as the @xmath3-dependence of the bernoulli pressure @xmath34 has to vanish if the problem should be restricted to a two  dimensional problem .",
    "this can be solved by setting @xmath35 which in general then leads to @xmath36 this is the condition for the vanishing of the @xmath3component in the euler - equation ( [ eulerink ] ) .",
    "this partial differential equation ( eq.[scherkomp6 ] ) can be solved by any regular function @xmath37 which defines the shear components as @xmath38 as long as both we are dealing with a real two  dimensional problem , and there does not exist an implicit function of @xmath27 and @xmath28 , or that @xmath27 is an explicit function of @xmath28 , so that we need to have @xmath39 almost everywhere in the considered domain .",
    "other cases has been discussed for example by @xcite or @xcite without the constraint of incompressibility but with the constraint of a vanishing nonideal term @xmath23 .",
    "it should be mentioned , that due to the mass continuity equation for the stationary and incompressible flow the density @xmath40 is a function of the stream function @xmath27 , since from the mass continuity equation @xmath41 it follows @xmath42 which implies that @xmath43 considering the last steps we can rewrite ohm s law ( eq.([ohmresimhd2 ] ) ) in the form @xmath44 where @xmath45 , @xmath46 .",
    "the first equation represents the @xmath3-component , and the other two equations the @xmath27- and @xmath28-components ( i.e. the poloidal components ) of ohm s law .",

    "next we look at the euler or momentum balance equation ( eq.([eulerink ] ) ) : @xmath50 with @xmath51 this delivers the whole set of equations of motion to be solved @xmath52 with two potentials , which are explicit functions of the stream function @xmath27 and the ( magnetic ) flux function @xmath28 .",
    "these equations have already been derived by @xcite for the pure 2d case with @xmath53 and @xmath54 .      we know from @xcite and @xcite that field line connection breaks down with respect to the plasma velocity @xmath55 if , in our stationary case the equation @xmath56 for an unknown function @xmath57 , where @xmath58 and @xmath25 are given , can not be fulfilled . for solutions of non - ideal mhd",

    "it is therefore necessary that @xmath65 which implies that @xmath66 constant .",
    "equation ( [ polkompel ] ) can be expressed in the form of an equation similar to the telegrapher s equation for the unknown shear function @xmath67 @xmath68 where @xmath69    it is possible to rewrite equation ( [ zkompel ] ) with the help of the chain rule @xmath70 which is equivalent to @xmath71 in the following we will use eq.([linevio ] ) to define line violation and therefore reconnection rates .",
    "it should also be mentioned that the @xmath3component of ohm s law ( eq.([ohmresimhd3 ] ) ) indicates , that the asymptotical flow component within the plane around the heliosphere , which may be inclined with respect to the asymptotical magnetic field components within the plane , determines the constant electric field in the invariant direction .",
    "consequently , if we restrict to @xmath72 and @xmath73 and if the plasma is ideal everywhere and the flow is field  aligned at infinity , then the flow is field  aligned everywhere .",
    "this is due to the fact that the electric field in the @xmath3-direction is invariant .",
    "so if the electric field in the invariant direction vanishes at infinity , the jacobian matrix in eq.([ohmresimhd3 ] ) vanishes .",
    "this then implies that the flow is in fact field - aligned everywhere .",
    "a similar discussion for axissymmetric equilibria can be found e.g. in @xcite .",
    "we set @xmath74 which results in @xmath72 and @xmath73 and take the parker outflow ( @xcite ) for our investigation @xmath75 the parker flow field is defined by a potential field . in this article we assume the auxilliary flow field and the magnetic field to be potential fields , i.e. @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "the stream lines of the parker outflow given by the potential @xmath78 in eq.([parkerpot ] ) can be seen in fig.[parkerflow ] . in general , potential fields",
    "can be represented by laurent series .",
    "we define @xmath79 as the complex flux function with @xmath80 , the scalar magnetic potential , as the real , and @xmath81 as the imaginary part of @xmath82 . using the assumption of a finite number of neutral points @xmath83 and asymptotical boundary conditions , @xmath84 , we can write : @xmath85 the roots of the polynomial @xmath86 are correlated to multipole moments : @xmath87 where @xmath88 .",
    "the same procedure is valid for potential flows given by @xmath89 .",
    "therefore , we can draw the conclusion , that the topology determines the global geometry of a heliospheric model , if the magnetic neutral point , i.e. stagnation point distribution for such a potential magnetic field is known . the field lines , crossing a magnetic neutral point are called magnetic separatrices . in the case of the heliosphere",
    "this magnetopause encloses the inner region of the heliosphere , therefore called heliopause .",
    "but on the other hand , there is also a ` hydropause ' , which is marked by the separatrix of the plasma flow .",
    "this separatrix passes through the stagnation point and leads to the following questions : what is the ` heliopause ' ?",
    "is it the ` hydropause ' ,  or is it the ` magnetopause ' ?",
    "if hydro and magnetopause are not identical , does this include a breakdown of the magnetic connectivity with respect to the bulk plasma flow and therefore magnetic reconnection ?",
    "how large is the reconnection rate or line violation rate in the case of potential fields with an incompressible flow ?",
    "this includes the question , whether the heliosphere is open or closed with respect to the counterstreaming interstellar medium .",
    "we will analyze the magnetic reconnection processes due to the simplified scenario we have developed in the last subsections with the help of the critereon for line and flux conservation .",
    "this relation is given , e.g by @xcite and references given therein .",
    "our assumption here is , that the magnetic field looks like a parker - spiral ( see e.g. theory : @xcite and measurements : @xcite ) by imitating the azimuthal component and spiral pattern of the field lines using a complex monopole moment representation . hereby , the complex monopole moment is given by @xmath90 , which results in the following representation of @xmath81 : @xmath91 solving for the neutral points gives the relation between the monopole moment on one hand and the coordinates of the neutral point and the asymptotical components of the magnetic field on the other hand @xmath92     ( left panel ) and @xmath93 ( right panel ) tilting of the asymptotical magnetic field with respect to the asymptotical classical parker ( out)flow ; the asymptotical parker flow is aligned to the @xmath2axis .",

    "scale as in fig.1,title=\"fig:\",width=226 ]    how does this given potential field influence the strength and importance of the resistivity @xmath94 ?",
    "with the help of the asymptotical boundary conditions we get for the asymptotical electric field : @xmath95 .",
    "we calculate reconnection rates ( @xmath96line violation rates ) , by using the derivative of ohm s law yielding @xmath97 where the jacobian should be regarded as a function of @xmath78 and @xmath81 .",
    "we use vasyliunas expression of line conserving flows ( @xcite ) , which shows the condition for line freezing .",
    "line freezing is fulfilled , if @xmath98 vanishes everywhere . if @xmath99 vanishes only in the ideal region @xmath100 , line freezing is violated and reconnection is taking place .",

    "scale as in fig.1,title=\"fig:\",width=245 ]    in this case we assume , that stagnation and magnetic neutral point are identical to fix at least one point of these two pauses .",
    "with increasing angle between @xmath102 and @xmath103 , the parker spiral winding grows , and also the deviation of the shapes of magneto and hydropause ( see figs.[parkerflow ] and [ feldlinzedeg ] ) .",
    "fig.[ratezedeg ] shows that the line violation rate is much stronger in the lower right region , where the angle @xmath104 between the asymptotical magnetic field and the flow is larger . here",
    "the magnetic field lines of the parker  spiral have a higher curvature in the case of larger inclination ( see right panel of fig.[ratezedeg ] ) . in fig.[ratezedeg ] in front of the heliopause nose there is a bulge which shows that the reconnection rate here is larger than at other locations in the vicinity of the stagnation point .",
    "we presented a method for calculating reconnection rates for a driven reconnection process .",
    "further investigations need to consider non - potential fields to account for spontaneous processes including ohmic heating .",
    "as we have shown it would be highly valuable to obtain observational knowledge of the location of magnetic neutral points and stagnation points in the heliosphere , because on the basis of that knowledge a unique solution could be given according to our prescription .",
