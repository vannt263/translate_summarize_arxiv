    "outflow winds are observed to be ubiquitous in star  forming galaxies at low and high redshift ( e.g. tremonti et  al . 2007 ; chen et  al . 2010 ; weiner et  al . 2009 ; steidel et  al . 2010 ) , and are thought to be an essential physical process to regulate galaxy formation and evolution . in theoretical models and simulations , appropriate treatment of the outflows is critical to recover the observed properties of galaxies over a wide range of cosmic time , mass and star formation activity : feedback by outflows powered by the star formation , although in forms that still remain rather unclear , is traditionally introduced to prevent excessive star formed from cooling baryons and to explain the luminosity function of galaxies , especially at the bright and faint end ( white & frenk et al .",

    "the critical parameter of galactic outflow is the mass loss rate as a function of the star formation history and halo mass , which is far from being accurately constrained . theoretically , how outflow wind is launched remains poorly understood , especially the relative contribution by agn and by star formation in powering cool ( i.e. @xmath7 k ) outflows .",

    "galactic outflows leave their spectral footprints across the whole electromagnetic spectrum ( veilleux et  al . 2005 and reference therein ) , revealing a variety of gas phases associated with outflow wind , from plasma to molecular gas . as one moves to distant universe , however , blueshifted atomic absorption lines arising from cool gas remain almost the only probes of galactic outflow . at low and intermediate redshift , interstellar medium ( ism ) absorption lines of  d @xmath11 and",

    "these lines are favored because of their high oscillator strength , moderate contamination from stellar photosphere and rich abundance in galaxies . the information carried by these absorption lines is unfortunately limited by",

    "this effect , has been largely ignored in previous studies .    ignoring dust extinction ,",
    "the propagation of resonant photons in the ism involves two types of processes : resonance scattering and fluorescence .",

    "for example , a typical resonant transition in near uv band is @xmath13 .",
    "if a resonance transition is associated with fluorescence transition , the random walk of resonance photons could be terminated , as resonance photons are re - emitted as optically thin fluorescence photons and exit the nebula . in an outflow wind , since absorbing medium has multi velocity components , continuum photons are absorbed in only limited regions of the wind , namely those where the co - moving wavelength of photons are doppler shifted to local resonance wavelength .",
    "this means that for a photon of wavelength @xmath14 , absorption is contributed only by parts of wind with velocity around @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the default line center of resonance transition and @xmath17 is light speed . as a conclusion",

    "the details of the multi - wavelength catalog and sed - fitting can be found in guo et al .",
    "since the peak of stellar emission of @xmath50 galaxies , redshifted to around the irac @xmath51 , is covered by our multi - wavelength data , our sed - fitting yields robust mass estimates , with a typical internal uncertainty of @xmath52 dex , comparable to the mass uncertainties of sed - fitting in literature .    unlike the measure of stellar mass , the instantaneous rate of star - formation ( sfr ) and dust extinction , parametrized by the e(b - v ) , are not well constrained by sed fitting , because they critically depend on the assumption on the star formation history .",
    "we measured both these quantities for each gmass galaxy through the slope and luminosity of the rest - frame far uv continuum .",

    "frame uv continuum in the approximate range 13002000  , and derived the unobscured sfr from its dust - corrected rest - frame uv continuum using the formula by kennicutt ( 1998 ) . compared with sed fitting , this method is less model - dependent and requires no prior information on the star - formation history of the galaxies ( e.g. , lee et al .",

    "luminosity shows that the uv dust correction method provides a good measurement of sfr for galaxies with intermediate sfr , namely @xmath53 ( wuyts et al .",

    "for galaxies with @xmath57 , however , both studies find that the uv dust correction method tends to overestimate the sfr by a factor of 1.52 . in our sample",
    ", we have 16 galaxies ( @xmath58 of our sample ) with @xmath59 , whose sfrs should therefore be used with caution .",
    "uncertainties are estimated with monte - carlo re - sampling of the photometry of each band of a galaxy , assuming a gaussian distribution with the mean and 1-sigma deviation equal to the flux and flux uncertainty of the band , and re - run the sed - fitting and uv sfr 100 times for the galaxy .",
    "then the uncertainty of the mass , sfr , and e(b - v ) is taken to be the standard deviation of the 100 runs .      to explore the dynamic properties of cold / warm gas responsible for absorption / emission , such as outflows and inflows ,",
    "an accurate determination of the systemic redshift of the galaxies is required . in the rest  frame wavelength probed by the gmass spectra considered here and given the available s / n ratio ,",
    "the doublet [ ] @xmath60 emission line , unresolved at the available resolution , is the only useful spectral feature to determine the systemic redshift .",
    "we have first selected the galaxies in our sample which have [ ] detected at the @xmath61 level in their spectra , for which the systemic redshift is measured from fitting a single gaussian profile to the line , whose rest wavelength we set to @xmath62  .",
    "this sub sample contains 43 galaxies , and in the following we will refer to it as `` sample [ ] '' .",
    "the redshifts of the galaxies in sample [ ] are expected to be the systemic ones . in all cases ,",
    "the interpretation of the emission line as [ ] is confirmed by examining the alignments of uv absorption lines at shorter wavelengths . for",
    "the wavelength / redshift ranges covered by the gmass sample , the most prominent uv absorption lines are feii / mgii lines , plus @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "we estimate the s / n ratios of the individual spectra in two continuum bands , [ 1740 - 1820  ] and [ 2680- 2760  ] ; typically , the blue band has s / n=7 and the red band has a typical s / n=4 .    for the remaining galaxies in the sample the redshift of the [ ]",
    "could not be measured , either because the line is outside of the available spectral range or because the s / n ratio was poor ( typically due to overlapping oh night sky emission lines ) . to measure their redshifts",
    "we have stacked the spectra from sample [ ] to generate a high s / n template spectrum , and then we have used the iraf task xcsao to cross  correlate this template with the spectra with no [ ] . for these galaxies the cross ",
    "correlation determines the redshift primarily from interstellar absorption features , and since the velocity of winds in the individual galaxies is in general different from that of the template spectrum ( which represents average wind properties ) , the redshifts measured in this way deviate from systemic by a random amount of the order of a few hundred km / s .",
    "we have visually inspected the spectra with cross - correlation redshift , and we have excluded low quality spectra , i.e. those with less than three identified features . the resulting sample of cross  correlation redshifts contains 98 galaxies , and we will refer to this sub sample as `` sample abs '' hereafter .",
    "thus , in total , we have redshifts for 141 galaxies , and for 97 of them the spectra cover the multiplets at @xmath67  .",
    "these 97 galaxies form the final sample that we have used in our subsequent analysis .",

    "( 2009 ) , who conclude that such an over - density of galaxies represents a proto  cluster .",
    "the uncertainty in the measure of the redshift of sample [ ] galaxies is dominated by the uncertainty in the determination of the line centroid , which is estimated from the covariance matrices during gaussian fit .",
    "the corresponding errors are small , less than 25km / s .",
    "for the cross  correlated redshifts , we have followed tonry and davis(1979 ) and used the xcsao package to calculate the error as a function of the r statistics of the correlation peak ( kurtz & mink et al .",

    "the mean error in the estimation of the peak of the correlation function is : @xmath69 , where @xmath70 is the fwhm of the correlation peak and r is the ratio of the correlation peak height to the amplitude of the antisymmetric noise .",
    "the effectiveness of this assumption has been discussed in detail by kurtz & mink ( 1998 ) . in our case ,",
    "the value of the uncertainty is @xmath71 , but we also have to consider an additional source of uncertainty due to the variation in outflow velocities , which is also in the range @xmath72 ( erb et al .",
    "2012 ) .    in figure",
    "[ fig : sfr_m ] , we show the sfr - m * diagram for the 97 gmass galaxies in our sample overplotted with the region defined by the deep2 sample studied by kornei et al .",

    "the mean locations of the low mass and high mass subsamples and low age and high age subsamples studied by erb et al ( 2012 ) are also plotted in the figure for comparison .",
    "while the range of the gmass galaxies overlaps with those of the other studies , for given stellar mass the gmass sample appears to include larger numbers of galaxies with larger sfr relative to the deep2 ones , which is very likely due to the higher redshifts of the former .",
    "the galaxies in the sample by erb et al .",
    "( 2012 ) cover a range of stellar mass that is lower than that of the gmass galaxies , even if the redshifts of the two samples are similar .",
    "this is very likely the result of the uv selection of the former and of the mid  ir selection of the latter . at the low mass end",
    "the gmass sample is sparse in the region covered by the erb et al.s sample .",
    "we have averaged the spectra of both sample [ ] and sample abs separately , and then combined both .",
    "prior to averaging , the spectra are shifted back to their rest frame and are linearly interpolated to a uniform grid with @xmath74/pixel .",
    "the rest frame wavelength coverage of each spectrum is recorded , after being trimmed of low s / n edges , for further selections of subsamples with constrained rest - wavelength coverage . to avoid being biased towards bright objects , which have higher s / n and higher flux density , individual spectra are normalized before averaging . in this study , we focus on and lines between @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "we extract three spectral windows from each individual spectrum , @xmath77 , @xmath78 and @xmath79 ( band 1 , 2 and 3 , respectively ) . in each window ,",
    "the individual spectrum is normalized by the continuum determined by fitting a straight line to the two spectral regions adjacent to the features : [ @xmath80 , @xmath81 for band 1 , [ @xmath82 , @xmath83 for band 2 and [ @xmath84 , @xmath85 for band 3 .",
    "finally , we calculate the median for each pixel to derive a `` representative '' spectrum of our sample . throughout this work ,",
    "we have estimated the uncertainty of any measurement based on the `` representative '' or average spectra from the variance of 200 boostrap realizations of the data .",

    "blueshifted and are clearly present in both samples , with velocity of maximum absorption in the range @xmath87 km / s .",
    "the absorption lines are fairly separated , with slight blending for @xmath88 ( @xmath89 ) and @xmath90 ( @xmath91 ) .",
    "this is not simply due to the relatively low resolution of our spectra ( @xmath92 km / s ) , but must be due to the broad blue wings of the absorption lines characterizing outflow kinematics .",
    "four emission features are clearly present around the wavelengths of absorption lines at @xmath93 , @xmath94 , @xmath95 and @xmath96  , as marked in figure  [ fig : avg_spec ] .",
    "the detection of these emission features in the spectra of star  forming galaxies has only been recently reported ( rubin et al . 2011 ; p11 ; coil et al . 2011 ) . as suggested by these authors , emission features around absorption lines",
    "could simply be explained as * fluorescence emissions , which are downward transitions to excited fine structure levels from the same upper levels of the observed absorptions .",
    "the high s / n achieved by averaging our spectra together offers an ideal chance to study the origin of these emission features , and in section 4 we examine whether indeed photon scattering could be the primary excitation mechanism for * emissions .",
    "similarly to figure 1 in p11 , we show the energy level diagrams of and associated * lines in figure  [ fig : level_dia ] .",
    "we use the atomic data from morton ( 2003 ) .",
    "the five observed resonance lines in absorption are associated with six downward permitted transitions to excited fine structure levels ( also called fluorescence transitions ) , respectively .",
    "these transitions are : @xmath23 @xmath97 * @xmath98/ * @xmath99 ; @xmath24 @xmath97 * @xmath100 ; @xmath26 @xmath97 * @xmath101/ * @xmath102 ; @xmath27 @xmath97 * @xmath103 .",
    "note that for @xmath25 , no fluorescence downward transition is permitted .",
    "the transition * @xmath104 is blended with @xmath105 , and the * @xmath106 is undetected in our average spectra .",
    "the null - detection of * @xmath106 could pose a potential challenge to the picture shown above , and we will come back to this point in section 4.2 .    unless lower excited levels are significantly populated , the cold gas should be optically thin to the * emission , and once these photons are produced they can escape the interstellar medium or outflow winds .",
    "this suggests that the * lines should be observed at systemic velocity , since in a symmetric wind , the * lines from the advancing and receding parts of the wind are both received by the observer ( rubin et al .",
    "2011 ) .      in the following sections we discuss the dependence of the ew ( ) and ew ( ) on the location of absorbing medium and the wind kinematics and discuss the implications .",
    "we start by discussing the profile of the absorption lines .",
    "two parameters control the propagation of resonance photons through the ism , namely the lower level oscillator strength of that transition , @xmath107 , which determines how frequently a photon is absorbed , and the probability of fluorescence , which measures the likelihood that the random walk of resonant photons in the nebula is terminated by an absorption event .",
    "the probability of fluorescence is defined as :    @xmath108    where @xmath109 and @xmath110 are the einstein coefficient for spontaneous emission of fluorescence transition * @xmath111 and resonance transition @xmath112 , respectively .",
    "thus , @xmath113 is simply the possibility for a resonance photon @xmath114 to be re - emitted as a * photon after an absorption event .",
    "@xmath115 and @xmath107 of transitions are listed in table  [ tab : abs ] . for the absorption lines ,",
    "line profiles are entirely controlled by @xmath107 and @xmath115 . before discussing how this is achieved ,",
    "we first point out that there exists a monotonic decreasing relationship between @xmath107 and @xmath115 for the five transitions of concern in this study , which is shown in figure  [ fig : os_conv ] .",
    "the transitions with higher oscillator strength always have lower @xmath115 , and this relationship can be approximated as @xmath116 .",
    "figure  [ fig : os_conv ] shows that , transitions can be placed on a monotonic sequence : transitions on the left - top corner have low @xmath107 and high @xmath115 , resonance photons of these transitions are less absorbed , each absorption is likely followed by a re - emission of * photon .",
    "we refer to them hereafter as `` fluorescence - like '' transitions . at the opposite end ,",
    "transitions on the right  bottom corner have high @xmath107 and low @xmath115 and thus resonance photons of these transitions are more frequently absorbed but less frequently or never give rise to fluorescence transitions .",
    "we refer to them hereafter as `` scattering - like '' transitions . in an homogeneous , dustless ism",
    ", the propagation of these two types of resonance photons is illustrated by figure  [ fig : propagation ] .",
    "we note here again that figure  [ fig : propagation ] only represents a special case in a static ism .",
    "the propagation of photons in an outflow wind further depends on velocity gradient in the flowing fluid , as continuum photons are absorbed in regions those where the co - moving wavelength of photons are doppler shifted to local resonance wavelength .      to measure the ews of and absorption lines , we combined sample [ ] and sample abs to achieve higher s / n ratio .",
    "we used only the 83 spectra with common coverage the rest frame spectral range @xmath117  .",
    "we fit a gaussian profile to each absorption line , since several lines are slightly blended ( @xmath118 and @xmath119 ) and can not be measured by direct integration of each line s spectrum .",
    "although the intrinsic line profile should be asymmetric due to the outflow , our spectral resolution is too low to observe this effect , and the absorption line profiles show small deviation from the gaussian one .",
    "the bootstrap resamplings of the spectra show that internal errors of our measures are @xmath120% or less .",
    "the results are listed in table  [ tab : abs ] .",
    "the oscillator strengths of the five lines range over one order of magnitude , and including the doublet further extended this range by a factor of 2 .",
    "in contrast , their ews span a relatively narrow range from @xmath121 .",
    "the line with the lowest ew , @xmath122 , also has the lowest oscillator strength @xmath123 .",
    "this has been interpreted in previous work as evidence that the lines are saturated . however , as shown in p11 , fig 5 , in an expanding wind model the presence of scattered emission could mimic the effect of partial covering of the continuum source .",
    "this is because a ) in an outflow wind , transitions with higher @xmath107 are associated with stronger redshifted p - cygni emission features from back - scattered photons , which are likely blended with absorption lines in our low resolution , average spectrum .",
    "we will show evidence of this effect in section 3.7 ; b ) absorption lines with high @xmath107 could be `` re - filled '' by scattered photons . according to the @xmath124 diagram",
    ", low @xmath107 lines are efficiently converted to fluorescence photons instead of being resonantly scattered .",
    "it is unclear to us whether these effects can reproduce the narrow range of ews that we observed , but it is important to keep in mind that that contributions from unsaturated absorption lines should not be ignored .      in this work ,",
    "we model line profiles by means of a two parameter representation .",
    "as illustrated by figure  [ fig : measure_v ] , first we measure the extent of blue line wing by @xmath125 , the velocity where @xmath126 of the continuum is absorbed .",
    "we then calculate the velocity centroid of absorption as :    @xmath127    @xmath128    where @xmath129 and @xmath130 are the wavelengths at which the depth of absorption trough decrease to @xmath18 of the peak depth on the blue side and the red side , respectively .",
    "the wavelength centroid @xmath131 is calculated between @xmath129 and @xmath129 , weighted by apparent optical depth @xmath132 .",
    "@xmath133 , where @xmath134 is the depth of absorption trough at wavelength @xmath14 .    in the following sections , we discuss how @xmath125 and @xmath135 depend on locations of in @xmath136 diagram .      consider an expanding wind with increasing velocity and decreasing density moving away from the galactic center . to first order",

    "dust extinction preferentially suppresses the red side of * emission , as photons scattered from the receding part of the wind travel longer paths to reach the observer .",
    "the flux - weighted line centroids , listed in table  [ tab : v_ems ] , are consistently blueshifted in all * lines , although no blueshift velocity is significant above the @xmath222 level .",
    "this result is in agreement with erb et al .",
    "( 2012 ) . on the other hand , high - z star - forming galaxies commonly have blueshifted centroids of absorption lines and this high frequency of outflowing absorbing material ( martin et al .",

    "however , one should keep in mind that our flux - limited sample could be biased toward `` face - on '' objects such that we are facing a direction where the ism column density is low , and the wind can most easily propagate out . when viewed from an edge - on direction , the strength of the absorptions is expected to be reduced relative to the * emissions , due to less covering fraction and scattered filling .",
    "ew ( * 2612 ) and ew ( * 2626 ) appear to decrease with increasing sfr , e(b - v ) and stellar mass .",
    "feii*(2365 ) and feii*(2396 ) , however , show opposite trends , that is , increasing ews with increasing sfr , e(b - v ) and possibly stellar mass .",

    "( 2012 ) are not statistically significant and require larger sample to be confirmed or rejected . however ,",
    "if these trends are real , we should question the validity of the explanations given above for the variation of ews ( * ) .",
    "this discrepancy is hardly explained in terms of different geometrical factors or radiative transfer processes of the  and * transitions .",
    "geometrical factors ( i.e. viewing angle , slit loss etc . ) should affect all * lines in a similar way .",
    "on the other hand , note that in figure  [ fig : os_conv ] , the * 2612/ 2586 couple has a @xmath115 that is higher than that of the * 2396/ 2374 couple and lower than that of the * 2365/ 2344 couple .",
    "the radiative transfer properties of * 2612 should lie between * 2365 and * 2396 , whereas * 2612 differs from both lines in terms of its scaling relationship with galaxy properties .",
    "it is true that dust extinction is likely observed in our co - added spectra , and it could cause varying degrees of suppression among the * lines , but simply dust extinction could not offer a solution to the observed opposite trends between transitions with similar scattering and fluorescence frequencies .",
    "a candidate explanation for this complexity is that the * 2612 and the * 2626 features are suppressed by overlapped absorption . in sedtion 4.2",
    ", we ve shown that this could be a result of stellar absorption .",

    "we average our data to create high s / n average spectra , which enables the identification of faint features , not otherwise visible in the individual spectra .",
    "because the gmass survey is contained in the goods south field , a full complement of panchromatic photometry is available to reliably estimate the integrated properties of the stellar populations of the galaxies such as star formation rate , stellar mass and dust extinction .",

    "we have also confirmed that fluorescence is a plausible excitation mechanism of the * lines , which are commonly observed in the spectra of star  forming galaxies at high redshift , such as those studied here . while other excitation mechanisms for this lines are possible , and have not been addressed here , the relative strengths of * are in agreement with the prediction from continuum fluorescence .",
    "\\(b ) we show that the intensity of * @xmath95 , * @xmath96 * @xmath106 is possibly suppressed by underlying stellar continua .",

    "\\(c ) by stacking 2d spectral images , we find that the region where the * emission is produced is compact and close to the galactic disks , as no extended emission of * is detected beyond @xmath6 kpc in radius . although no evidence is found that emissions are more extended than * in this study , the lower blueshifted velocities of lines relative to doublet , as well as the scarcity of scattered emission redward of 2382 in emitting systems , argue against that absorption/ * transitions probe a region of outflow wind that is spatially and dynamically identical with that probed by .",
    "this study confirms the unique diagnostic power of / * multiplets for probing the structure and kinematics of galactic outflows at @xmath227 .",

    "some important questions remains unsolved , such as whether the flattening of velocity distribution is associated with a phase change of wind , and if so , how .",
    "the answer to these questions might be directly linked to the kinematic profile of cool outflow wind , which is a crucial factor in constraining mass flow rate of wind .",
    "consider absorption at blue wing of absorption line and assume unit covering fraction .",
