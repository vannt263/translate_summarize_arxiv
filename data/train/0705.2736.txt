    "observation of polarized radiation at radio wavelengths is one of the prime means to study the roles of magnetic fields in astrophysics , through synchrotron emissivity which samples magnetic fields in relativistic plasmas , and through faraday rotation , created by radiation propagation through magnetized thermal plasmas .",
    "understanding the origin and evolution of magnetic fields is a key science goal of the the square kilometre array , a next - generation radio telescope under development by the international community @xcite .",
    "the primary observational tool to study the magnetic universe will be an ska all - sky rotation measure survey of background radio sources and diffuse galactic emission down to polarized flux density levels of @xmath11jy @xcite .",
    "however , while modern source counts approach flux density sensitivities of @xmath12jy in total intensity @xcite , very little is known about the polarization properties of the faint radio source population .",
    "the most extensive analyses of polarization of compact extragalactic sources were carried out by @xcite and @xcite , who used the nvss data @xcite to derive statistical polarization properties for @xmath1330,000 sources with @xmath14 mjy .",
    "similarly , @xcite used nvss sources with total flux density greater than 80 mjy to extrapolate polarized source counts to @xmath9jy levels .",
    "@xcite found that the mean fractional polarization of radio sources in the nvss brighter than 80 mjy was anti - correlated with flux density , especially for steep - spectrum radio sources ( @xmath15 , for @xmath16 ) .",
    "@xcite confirmed this result for the median of the fractional polarization for steep - spectrum sources only ( 87% of their sample ) , but found no significant trend for flat spectrum sources ( 13% of their sample ) .",
    "@xcite also noted that the flat shape of the polarized source counts indicates a dependence of the fractional polarization on flux density .",
    "radio sources with @xmath14 mjy are predominantly associated with flat or steep spectrum active galactic nuclei .",
    "star forming galaxies begin to be a significant fraction of the population at flux densities less than a few mjy ( see e.g. hopkins 2000 , windhorst 2003 ) .",
    "however , there is still ongoing debate about the fraction of the sub - mjy radio sources which is radio - quiet active galactic nuclei ( agn ) @xcite .",
    "it is thus uncertain that polarization properties derived from the strong radio source population are applicable to the sub - mjy radio sources .",
    "we have begun a project called the drao planck deep fields to explore the high latitude sky at high sensitivity in polarized radio continuum and in atomic hydrogen emission .",
    "the project uses the drao synthesis telescope at 1.4 ghz to create deep images of two fields , one with a very low column of foreground material , the elais n1 region @xmath17 , and a larger region of highly structured infrared cirrus emission at @xmath18 . this paper reports initial results from the first 30% of observations of elais n1 .",
    "the elais n1 ( european large area _ iso _ survey north 1 ) field @xcite , is an area of approximately 2 square degree chosen for a mid - infrared survey of distant galaxies with _ iso_. the field was selected to minimize confusion with galactic cirrus and the zodiacal background , being one of the lines of sight to the extragalactic sky with minimum _ iras _ 100 @xmath9 m emission .",
    "a larger area that includes elais n1 was later observed by the _",
    "spitzer _ wide area infrared extragalactic survey ( swire ) @xcite .",
    "the large amount of archival data from these extragalactic surveys make this region ideal for studies of the faint polarized radio source population .",
    "the drao synthesis telescope ( drao st ) is described in detail in @xcite .",
    "the telescope is a seven - element east - west array of 9-m diameter antennas .",
    "three antennas are moved to provide complete sampling of the uv plane from the shortest baseline ( 12.86 m ) to the longest baseline ( 617.18 m ) after a full synthesis of 12 times 12 hours .",
    "the array has a primary beam size 1072 ( fwhm ) at @xmath19 , which makes it an effective instrument for wide - field surveys .",
    "the first sidelobe of the synthesized beam is at the 3% level , and side - lobes farther from the main lobe of the beam are less than 0.5% .",
    "the first grating ring of the synthesized beam appears at @xmath20 from the main lobe at 1420 mhz , which is outside the field of view defined by the 10% sensitivity level of the primary beam .",
    "the telescope observes simultaneously the hi  21 cm line and continuum at 408 mhz and full polarimetry in four 7.5 mhz wide frequency bands centered around @xmath19 .",
    "the antennas have prime focus feeds and at 1420 mhz receive both right - hand ( r ) and left - hand ( l ) circularly polarized radiation . the observations and data processing techniques used in this paper follow those that have been used to obtain high - fidelity wide - field polarimetric images of the galactic plane with the drao st @xcite .",
    "the system temperature of the telescope as described by @xcite was @xmath21 , leading to an rms noise in a synthesized image of a single field of @xmath22jy  beam@xmath3 at field center .",
    "however , starting in 2003 , the sensitivity was enhanced by a series of improvements , completed by the time the current observations began in 2004 . these improvements comprised installation of new low - noise amplifiers , modifications to telescope structures to reduce ground noise , and installation of shielding fences to further block ground radiation from entering the aperture . the system temperature of the seven individual antennas now spans the range @xmath23 to @xmath21 , and the overall system temperature is @xmath24 , leading to a field - center rms noise of @xmath25jy  beam@xmath3 ( @xmath26 ) at 1420 mhz . a higher sensitivity and larger field of view are obtained by creating a mosaic of overlapping fields . the most uniform sensitivity across a mosaic",
    "is obtained if the fields are centered on a hexagonal grid . the field centre separations for the survey presented here",
    "is @xmath27 , which is @xmath28 of the fwhm diameter of the primary beam .",
    "observations for the drao elais n1 survey began in august 2004 and will continue to create a final mosaic of 30 fields .",
    "this paper presents 21-cm continuum polarimetry of the first 10 fields .",
    "figure  [ surveyarea - fig ] shows the location of the 10-field mosaic in relation to the _ iso _ elais n1 field , and the swire survey of elais  n1 .",
    "the theoretical maximum 1-@xmath29 sensitivity in our mosaic of 10 fields is @xmath30jy .",
    "complex gains for the center of each field were determined by observing the unresolved and unpolarized sources 3c147 and 3c295 between 12-hour observing runs .",
    "the absolute polarization angle was calibrated by observing the highly linearly polarized source 3c286 once every 4 days .",
    "the polarization images do not contain much flux , making self - calibration ineffective .",
    "therefore r and l gain solutions derived from self - calibration of the stokes @xmath4 images were applied to the polarization data as well .",
    "the resulting visibility data sets for each field were then corrected for the effects of instrumental polarization across the field of view ( which leads to leakage of stokes @xmath4 power into @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) .",
    "instrumental polarization is a complex quantity , with phase and amplitude terms .",
    "these were measured for the seven individual antennas with a holographic technique , using the unpolarized source 3c  295 , on a @xmath31 grid across the primary beam .",
    "after interpolation , these measurements were used to predict conversion of @xmath4 into @xmath0 and @xmath1 at any point in the beam based on clean component models from processing the @xmath4 image for a field .",
    "residual errors in instrumental polarization for an individual field are estimated at 0.25% for the field center , growing to 1% at a distance of @xmath32 . with a field separation in the mosaic image of @xmath33 the instrumental polarization in the central 3.6 square degrees of the mosaic remains less than 0.5% . towards the edge of the mosaic instrumental terms",
    "may be as large as 1% .",
    "after these initial procedures there are usually still confusing arc - like structures left in the images , centered on bright sources inside and outside the primary beam .",
    "these are the result of residual complex gain errors at large distance from the field center .",
    "effects from these are removed from the visibilities using a procedure called modcal , which is in principle a direction - dependent self - calibration @xcite .",
    "the antenna sidelobes are highly polarized , and sources outside the primary beam can produce strong spurious polarized signals .",
    "the sun is seen in the sidelobes whenever it is above the horizon , but its effects are usually confined to the shorter baselines because of its large extent .",
    "the effects of the sun were removed by making images centered on the sun s position and removing the response from the visibilities .",
    "terrestrial interference , which is always polarized , is another source of spurious polarization .",
    "interference effects in images appear as a spurious source concentrated around the north celestial pole , and can be largely eliminated by making an image at the pole and correcting the visibilities .",
    "radiation from the ground appears to be polarized , and can appear as a correlated signal in visibilities corresponding to short baselines ; this effect is more difficult to remove . in some particularly bad cases the data for affected interferometer spacings were simply flagged and removed .",
    "figure  [ en21-fig ] shows the deep 21 cm continuum images of the elais n1 area in stokes @xmath4 , @xmath0 , and @xmath1 .",
    "the images are centered on @xmath34 = @xmath35 , @xmath36 = @xmath37 and cover an area of 7.43 square degrees ( the area within the thick gray line in figure [ surveyarea - fig ] ) .",
    "the angular resolution varies with the declination over the images and is given by @xmath38 .",
    "at the mosaic center the resolution is @xmath39 .",
    "the noise near the center of the mosaic ( white square in figure  [ en21-fig ] ) is measured to be @xmath2jy in @xmath0 , and @xmath1 ( see   [ detect - sec ] ) .",
    "the stokes @xmath4 image is not limited by confusion , but the noise is slightly higher at @xmath40jy near the center of the mosaic , probably because of a contribution from faint sources .",
    "the final images are virtually free of artifacts , so the sensitivity is limited by the noise .",
    "the rms brightness sensitivity is @xmath41 .",
    "the dynamic range near the center of the mosaic is more than 3000:1 in stokes @xmath4 .",
    "with very few exceptions , sources in figure  [ en21-fig ] appear as compact ( nearly ) unresolved sources , that can be characterized by their peak intensity and a single polarization angle .",
    "this is consistent with expectations from the angular size  flux density relation for extragalactic radio sources @xcite ; the median angular size of a @xmath42 source is @xmath43 .",
    "flux densities and positions of all sources in the pilot deep field images were measured with a source extraction algorithm that fits a two - dimensional gaussian and a background level to each source .",
    "the mosaic images were multiplied by the primary beam response function of the mosaic to obtain an image with a uniform noise level , equal to the noise level at the center of the image .",
    "this operation retains the correct signal - to - noise ratio for each source , but the resulting uniform noise level greatly facilitates automated source extraction .",
    "the inverse primary beam correction is applied to the measured flux densities of sources from the uniform noise map to transform back to true flux density .",
    "the rms noise level in the uniform noise images was measured by fitting a gaussian function to the distribution of amplitudes in the image .",
    "the result is shown in figure  [ fig : q_unoise ] .",
    "the noise distribution in both the @xmath0 and @xmath1 images is well fitted by a gaussian with dispersion @xmath44jy .    the polarized flux density image ( @xmath45 )",
    "was searched for polarized sources . for gaussian noise in the @xmath0 and @xmath1 images with rms amplitude @xmath29 ,",
    "the statistical distribution of the noise in a measurement of @xmath46 for a source with an intrinsic polarized flux density of @xmath47 is a rice distribution @xcite @xmath48 here @xmath49 is the modified bessel function of the first kind . for @xmath50 ,",
    "the distribution reduces to a rayleigh distribution , @xmath51 which gives the probability distribution of pixel amplitudes in the @xmath46 image in the absence of polarized emission .",
    "the noise in the @xmath46 image has a non - zero mean and has higher probability of positive peaks above a given detection threshold than gaussian noise .",
    "we searched the @xmath46 map down to a level of @xmath52 , which has an equivalent probability for false positive signals to the @xmath53 level for a gaussian distribution .",
    "the measured polarized flux density @xmath46 was corrected for noise bias to obtain an estimate of @xmath54 through the relation @xmath55 , which is a good approximation if the signal to noise ratio is larger than 4 @xcite .",
    "the 83 sources detected are listed in table  [ table_polsources ] , which gives the position of each source , the integrated total flux density , noise bias - corrected peak polarized intensity , polarization position angle , fractional polarization defined as the ratio of the bias - corrected peak polarized intensity to the peak total intensity , and the spectral index of the total flux density between @xmath56 and @xmath19 if the source appears in the wenss catalogue @xcite . to ensure possible spurious polarized sources due to instrumental polarization",
    "are not included , we conservatively remove sources with observed fractional polarization , @xmath57 , less than 1% .",
    "only two sources were removed from the sample for this reason .",
    "the intrinsic fractional polarization @xmath58 of radio sources provides astrophysical information about the nature of the polarized sources .",
    "however , the observed fractional polarization @xmath57 is sensitive to the noise in @xmath46 and in @xmath4 .",
    "in addition to @xmath46 being a biased estimator of @xmath54 , the error distribution of the ratio @xmath59 has strong non - gaussian wings , so @xmath57 is not a very accurate estimate of @xmath58 even for relatively high signal - to - noise sources .",
    "this is illustrated in figure  [ polstat_demo ] , which shows the relation between @xmath57 and stokes @xmath4 flux density for an artificial sample of sources , all with @xmath60% and gaussian noise added with equal amplitudes in stokes @xmath4 , @xmath0 , and @xmath1 .",
    "only those sources with a @xmath46 flux density more than @xmath61 are shown .",
    "error bars represent standard error propagation in @xmath57 from the errors in @xmath46 and @xmath4 .",
    "the high values of @xmath57 at signal - to - noise ratio less than @xmath13100 is a result of the detection threshold in @xmath46 and the non - gaussian error statistics of @xmath57 .",
    "the effect is much larger than the polarization noise bias alone .",
    "these problems highlight the need for careful analysis of the effects of noise and polarization detection thresholds in studies of the fractional polarization of faint sources .",
    "previous studies have focused on the fractional polarization of bright radio sources in the nvss .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , and @xcite considered polarized sources in the nvss with stokes @xmath4 flux density stronger than 80 mjy , 100 mjy , and 80 mjy respectively .",
    "the high flux density thresholds in these studies were adopted to achieve a good level of completeness in @xmath57 down to the limit set by residual instrumental polarization ( @xmath62 ) .",
    "these studies found a @xmath57 distribution that decreases monotonically with increasing @xmath57 , and with a median @xmath63 .",
    "for these bright sources , noise effects are small , and the @xmath57 distribution should be close to the intrinsic @xmath58 distribution down to limits set by residual instrumental polarization .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the shape of the @xmath58 distribution for much fainter stokes @xmath4 flux densities than those considered in previous work .",
    "the present data have angular resolution similar to the nvss , so differences in the measured degree of polarization because of a difference in resolution are not expected .",
    "our results can be compared directly with results based on the nvss .",
    "noise effects such as those illustrated in figure  [ polstat_demo ] were taken into account by a monte carlo analysis .",
    "a set of simulated catalogs was generated to accurately represent the effects of noise and the polarized flux density detection threshold in the data .",
    "stokes @xmath4 flux densities of simulated sources were drawn from the fit to observed source counts by @xcite .",
    "we assume in these simulations that the stokes @xmath4 source counts of polarized sources have the same shape as those for all radio sources .",
    "this is a reasonable assumption because @xmath64 of radio sources in the nvss display significant polarization @xcite .",
    "the intrinsic stokes i flux density is multiplied by the degree of polarization , @xmath58 , drawn from an assumed @xmath58 distribution to obtain the intrinsic polarized intensity @xmath54 .",
    "the intrinsic stokes @xmath49 and @xmath54 of a simulated source are transformed to observed flux densities @xmath4 and @xmath46 by adding noise with statistical properties identical to the properties of the noise in the data .",
    "first , @xmath54 is converted into intrinsic stokes @xmath65 and @xmath66 , assuming a random polarization angle .",
    "the error in the flux density is assumed to consist of a part that is proportional to the noise in the image at the location of the source , and a part that is proportional to the flux density of the source , added in quadrature .",
    "the error in the flux density @xmath67 is evaluated as @xmath68 where @xmath67 represents the intrinsic flux density @xmath49 , @xmath69 , or @xmath66 , @xmath29 is the rms noise in the image and @xmath70 and @xmath71 are constants .",
    "the value of @xmath70 was determined from the rms variation of the flux density of bright sources in the ten fields after field registration @xcite .",
    "flux densities of sources brighter than @xmath72 varied by @xmath73 ( rms ) over the ten fields . from this",
    "we adopt @xmath74 .",
    "the value of the constant @xmath75 was taken to be that found by @xcite from monte carlo simulations for flux density errors in the westerbork northern sky survey ( wenss ) .",
    "the value of @xmath29 is different for each source , to represent variation of the noise with location in the mosaic .",
    "the distribution of polarized intensities of the resulting simulated sources , have the same statistical effects as the observed polarized intensities , including the effects of noise bias , the detection threshold and the variation of the noise with position in the mosaic .    to derive the @xmath58 distribution directly from the data , we compare the distribution of the data in a @xmath76 diagram with the probability distribution for simulated source catalogues .",
    "figure  [ beck - fig ] shows the observed data points , and the model probability distribution assuming the @xmath58 distribution function of @xcite .",
    "as expected , sources brighter than @xmath77 are represented well by this model",
    ". however , fainter sources in our sample are more highly polarized than predicted by this distribution .",
    "this is clearly visible in figure  [ beck - fig ] for sources with @xmath78 , where an offset exists between the distribution of observed sources and the predicted ridge of maximum source density . a 2-dimensional kolmogorov - smirnov test @xcite rejected the hypothesis that the data were drawn from the simulated distribution at the 99.9% confidence level .",
    "the best fit @xmath58 distribution was derived by fitting source probability density distributions to the data in the @xmath79 plane for trial @xmath58 distributions .",

    "\\label{ghseries - eq}\\ ] ] we consider only modest deviations from a gaussian , since previous work on bright nvss sources suggests that the shape of the distribution is nearly gaussian . assuming that the @xmath58 distribution peaks at zero and declines monotonically with increasing @xmath58 , we use only the fourth term ( @xmath81 ) in equation  [ ghseries - eq ] , which results in symmetric deviations .",
    "a coefficient @xmath82 means that the wings of the distribution are stronger than the wings of a gaussian distribution , as shown graphically by @xcite .",
    "higher order terms were not considered because of the limited size of our data sample at this time .",
    "the @xmath58 distribution defined by equation  [ ghseries - eq ] thus has two free parameters , the gaussian standard deviation , @xmath83 , and the amplitude of the lowest order symmetric deviation from a gaussian , @xmath84 .",
    "the fits maximize the likelihood @xmath85 of the data as a function of these parameters , @xmath86 with the probability of an observed ( @xmath87 ) for a given @xmath83 and @xmath84 @xmath88 the product over @xmath89 is over all sources in the data , @xmath90 . whereas the sum over @xmath91 is over all simulated sources in the catalog , @xmath92 , for a particular @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "typically @xmath93 .",
    "the values @xmath94 and @xmath95 are the observed errors in stokes @xmath4 and polarized flux density for the @xmath96 source .",
    "the maximum likelihood @xmath58 distribution was found through a grid search over the parameter space .",
    "the best fitting model has parameters @xmath97 , and @xmath98 .",
    "the probability density function of this model is shown along with the data in figure  [ bestfit_pi ] .",
    "the uncertainty in the best - fitting parameters was evaluated empirically .",
    "three hundred randomly selected samples , each containing on average the same number of sources as the observed sample , were drawn from the best fitting simulated catalog .",
    "each of these samples was fitted with the maximum likelihood fit to evaluate the spread of the best - fitting parameters .",
    "two thirds of these fits yielded a @xmath83 within 1% of the maximum likelihood value @xmath99 .",
    "we conclude that @xmath100 .",
    "the fitted value of @xmath84 is not independent of @xmath83 , because a larger @xmath84 can partially compensate for a smaller @xmath83 . from the same 300 experimental fits , two thirds yielded a value @xmath101 .",
    "although the data are consistent with @xmath102 , those fits with @xmath84 contrained to be zero yield an average @xmath103 .",
    "the data therefore suggest that the @xmath58 distribution may be somewhat broader than a simple gaussian with @xmath104 .",
    "the best - fitting model was also subjected to a 2-dimensional kolmogorov - smirnov test .",
    "the hypothesis that the data were drawn from the best - fit distribution in figure  [ bestfit_pi ] was rejected at the 98% confidence level .",
    "this is much better than the result for the @xcite distribution , but it is still suggestive that all the data are not well represented by the maximum likelihood model distribution .",
    "this is entirely the result of the fact that the best fitting gauss - hermite distribution does not fit the bright sources in the sample very well .",
    "we were able to produce a better fit by creating a set of hybrid simulated catalogs that use the @xcite distribution for brighter sources and our best fitting distribution for faint sources .",
    "the transition between these regimes was made smooth , with equal contributions from the two distributions at a flux density of 30 mjy .",

    "the effect of the varying noise level over the mosaic on source detection probability ( completeness correction ) was measured as a function of flux density by repeating the source detection on 1000 simulated images having the same noise characteristics and source density as the data .",
    "separate simulations were performed for total intensity and for polarized intensity images .",
    "each simulated image contained random gaussian noise smoothed to the resolution of the drao images , and the same uniform rms amplitude as the data .",
    "for each simulated polarization image , two independent noise images were created to represent the @xmath0 and @xmath1 images .",
    "sources were placed at random positions , with flux densities drawn from the source - count curve derived by @xcite between 0.1 and @xmath108 .",
    "sources below the detection limit were included in the simulations to account for crowding in the field , and the possibility that faint sources are observed above the detection limit because of noise . the resulting synthetic stokes @xmath4 and polarized intensity images were then searched for sources in an identical manner as for the observed images .",

    "the polarized source counts are also listed in table  [ polcounts - tab ] .",
    "counts were derived in bins starting at @xmath110jy to avoid sources with completeness correction greater than 10 .",
    "this resulted in the removal of the fifteen faintest sources from the counts .",
    "the stokes @xmath4 source counts show good agreement with the windhorst curve , although we find somewhat higher numbers around @xmath111 .",

    "this may suggest a continuing trend toward even higher fractional polarization in the sub - mjy population .",
    "the complete drao 30-field survey of the region , and other deep polarization surveys , will test this .",
    "the positions of the polarized radio sources were examined in the _ spitzer _ swire images of elais n1 .",

    "the sensitivity of the first images is sufficient to detect a stokes @xmath4 counterpart for every polarized source in the elais n1 deep field .",
    "approximately 35% of the polarized radio sources showed resolved structure on scales of 2  to 30 in the first images .",
    "a polarized source may be associated with a radio lobe instead of the core of a radio galaxy .",

    "another 17 polarized sources had uncertain identifications , i.e.  there was more than one possible counterpart within the errors of the radio position .",
    "two sources were not covered by swire .",
    "the remaining 12% of the sources ( 10 objects ) have no counterpart in the swire images .",
    "similar statistics resulted from the search for counterparts of the stokes @xmath4 sources with no detectable polarized emission .",
    "a wide range in flux density and angular size was found among the identified _",

    "region 2 is occupied mainly by dusty star - forming galaxies with strong pah bands at red - shift @xmath119 .",
    "this is because the strongest pah features at low redshift contribute to the flux in irac bands at 3.6 and @xmath118 m . region 3 is occupied by galaxies with fainter pah emission , or by dusty starforming galaxies at redshift @xmath120 .",
    "a conspicuous concentration of galaxies in region 3 is the blue clump near @xmath121 , @xmath122 .",

    "the host galaxies of the polarized sources occupy mainly regions 1 and 3 .",
    "the source in region 4 can not be considered a convincing high - redshift galaxy in view of uncertainties in the photometry and its proximity to the boundary with regions 1 and 3 . the majority ( 71% ) of the host galaxies of polarized sources in the _ spitzer",
    "_ color - color diagram are either in region 1 or in the blue clump . in both cases ,",
    "the radio emission is interpreted as emission from an agn .",
    "eleven polarized sources ( 27% ) are found in the region of pah - dominated galaxies , with @xmath124 , a few dex above the blue clump .",
    "their location in the color - color diagram suggests either pah - dominated galaxies at redshift @xmath125 , or galaxies with faint pah bands at lower redshift @xcite .",
    "inspection of the first and swire images of these sources shows that all appear to be elliptical galaxies with a smooth morphology , and some have resolved symmetric radio sources , suggestive of radio lobes .",
    "this suggests that the polarized radio emission in these galaxies is associated with agn activity , while the pah emission originates from dust at a substantial distance from the agn , where it is shielded from the hard ultraviolet radiation that would destroy the pahs .",
    "dust in elliptical galaxies is a common phenomenon @xcite .",
    "it can be produced in the envelopes of cool red giant stars or it can be acquired through a merger with a gas - rich galaxy .    the stokes @xmath4 sources with no detectable polarized emission generally occupy the same areas of the color - color diagram as the polarized sources , with two exceptions .",
    "first , a significant fraction ( 15% ) of the stokes @xmath4 sources is located in region 2 , the area where star forming , pah - dominated galaxies are expected .",
    "these objects are generally the faintest stokes i radio sources , and none would be detectable in polarization at our sensitivity level .",
    "the stokes @xmath4 sources in region 2 are likely members of a population of star - forming galaxies that is believed to make up a large fraction of the radio source population below @xmath131 mjy .",
    "the second exception is that table  [ table_irac_colcol ] indicates an excess of polarized sources ( 27% ) relative to sources with no detected polarization ( 14% ) in region 3b , associated with galaxies having pah emission .",
    "this difference is significant if poisson errors are assumed .",
    "confirmation will require a more complete sample of polarized radio sources identified with _",
    "spitzer _ galaxies .",
    "the polarized sources found in the elais n1 field have a median stokes @xmath4 flux density of 12 mjy .",
    "models of radio source populations fitted to the total radio source counts suggest that most radio sources with @xmath19 flux density @xmath126 are steep - spectrum radio galaxies , whose power is ultimately derived from accretion onto a compact object .",
    "however , it is not clear a priori that a faint polarization - selected sample of radio sources is representative of the entire population . in principle",
    ", a highly polarized population of faint radio sources may constitute a significant fraction of a sample of faint polarized sources .",
    "in section  [ maxlike - sec ] we presented evidence that faint extragalactic polarized radio sources are on average more highly polarized than bright sources , with a median fractional polarization approximately three times higher . from an analysis of sources with stokes",
    "@xmath8 mjy in the nvss , @xcite also noted that the median fractional polarization of radio sources increases with decreasing flux density , from 1.05% for stokes",
    "@xmath127 mjy to 1.84% between @xmath128 . from a similar analysis of the nvss",
    ", @xcite showed that the anti - correlation between flux density and percentage polarization occurs only for steep - spectrum sources .",
    "they found that the median percentage polarization for steep - spectrum sources increased from 1.14% for flux densities greater than @xmath129 to 1.77% between @xmath130 .",
    "our result extends this to much lower flux densities and indicates a much stronger effect for faint sources , resulting in a median polarization of @xmath131 at stokes @xmath132 .",
    "analysis of table  [ table_polsources ] shows that these faint polarized emitters are dominated by steep - spectrum sources ; all but one of the polarized sources for which a 325 @xmath19 spectral index exists ( 75% ) has @xmath133 .",
    "polarized sources that can be identified with galaxies in the _ spitzer _ elais n1 deep field , are associated with elliptical galaxies .",
    "most of the host galaxies have near - infrared colors typical for dust emission from the vicinity of an agn , or an old stellar population with no significant dust emission .",
    "the majority of the polarized sources is associated with agn activity for this reason .",
    "the remaining 11 polarized sources associated with galaxies having pah emission are also likely to contain an agn .",
    "some are clearly resolved double - lobed objects in the first images , and all appear to be elliptical galaxies with a smooth brightness distribution .",
    "we conclude that there is no evidence for galaxies in our sample of polarized sources in which the radio emission is powered by star formation .",
    "the higher fractional polarization of faint radio sources may be related to a population of radio - quiet agn in which fainter radio emission correlates with conditions that favor increased polarization , for example more ordered magnetic fields or less internal faraday depolarization .",
    "high - resolution polarimetry of these objects will provide more insight into their nature .",
    "we present sensitive observations of a complete sample of compact polarized radio sources , as part of a deep integration of the elais n1 region made with the synthesis telescope at the dominion radio astrophysical observatory .",
    "a total of 83 polarized sources was detected in the ten - field mosaic .",
    "the distribution of fractional polarization of faint polarized sources was investigated with a monte - carlo analysis that generates synthetic source lists with the same noise statistics and observational selection criteria as the data .",
    "maximum - likelihood fits of the synthetic source lists to the data in the @xmath134 - @xmath135 plane yielded a best fitting gauss - hermite function with @xmath136 , @xmath137 for the distribution of intrinsic fractional polarization .",
    "the data demonstrate a trend of increasing fractional polarization with decreasing flux density .",
    "polarized source counts from the elais n1 deep field are presented down to @xmath138 .",
    "we find that the euclidean - normalized polarized counts remain flat below @xmath117 .",
    "the distribution of fractional polarization derived from our monte carlo analysis is convolved with the total - intensity source counts to produce a prediction of the polarized source counts .",
    "the predicted euclidean - normalized polarized counts are nearly flat to @xmath139 , in good agreement with the data .",
    "however , the data at the faintest polarized flux densities suggests a continuing trend of increased polarization fraction with decreasing flux density .",
    "the near - infrared color - color diagram for host galaxies identified with the polarized sources in the elais n1 field shows that most of the host galaxies are ellipticals , or galaxies for which the near - infrared spectrum is dominated by stochastically heated very small grains , presumably from the vicinity of an agn .",
    "some of the host galaxies appear to have pah bands in their near - infrared spectrum , but the morphological resemblance with ellipticals , and the fact that some of these polarized sources are resolved radio galaxies in the first survey , indicates that these objects also harbour agn .",
    "we suggest that the higher degree of polarization indicates a difference between agn observed at a flux density of hundreds of mjy , and fainter agn .",
    "observations and research on the drao planck deep fields are supported by the natural sciences and engineering research council of canada and the national research council canada .",
    "ev sheehan of drao was instrumental in improving the sensitivity of the drao synthesis telescope , with the outcome recorded in this paper .",
