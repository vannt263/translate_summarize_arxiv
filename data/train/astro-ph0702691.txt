    "nearby dark clouds like taurus and perseus contain dozens of dense molecular cores where stars like our sun are currently forming or have done so in the recent past ( myers 1995 ) .",
    "their large number , together with their proximity and simple structure , make cores unique targets to study the complex physics involved in the formation of a star .",
    "dense cores that have not yet formed stars , the so called starless or pre - stellar cores , inform us of the initial conditions of star formation , and their study can help us elucidate the process by which pockets of cloud material condense and become gravitationally unstable",
    ". cores with deeply embedded young stellar objects ( `` protostellar cores '' ) are unique targets to study the complex motions that occur during the period of accretion , when a combination of infall , outflow , and rotation is necessary to assemble the star and redistribute the gas angular momentum . finally , evolved cores are primary targets to study the interaction between the newly born star and its environment .",
    "these feedback effects are responsible for the transition of the protostar from embedded to visible , and may be important determining the final mass of the star and stabilizing the nearby gas via turbulence generation .    the observational study of dense cores has advanced enormously over the last decade thanks to the increase in resolution provided by the new millimeter and submillimeter interferometers , and also due to the systematic combination of observations of dust and molecular tracers ( e.g. , bergin & tafalla 2007 ) .",
    "this brief review summarizes some new results from dense cores studies and presents a number of current issues that will greatly benefit from alma observations .",
    "the limited space of this article makes any attempt to review the field necessarily incomplete , and the reader is referred for further information to the other contributions on star formation in these proceedings , in particular to those by van dishoeck , andr , shepherd , aikawa , wilner , johnstone , and crutcher .    despite significant recent progress , our understanding of the structure and evolution of dense cores is still incomplete due in part to limitations in the resolution and sensitivity of the available observations .",
    "even the highest resolution data of nearby dense cores can not discern details finer than about 100 au , which is still insufficient to disentangle the complex kinematics of infall and outflow motions in the vicinity of a protostar .",
    "probably more important , the low temperatures of the gas and the dust in cores ( @xmath0  k ) make the emission of any core tracer intrinsically weak , so any increase in the resolution needs to be accompanied by a parallel increase in the sensitivity , or the observations will not achieve enough s / n to provide useful information .",
    "this is particularly important when using weak , optically thin tracers to sample the innermost gas in the core .",
    "these tracers , in addition , often present extended emission , which poses a problem to the current generation of interferometers that cover sparsely the @xmath1 plane and therefore suffer systematically from missing flux . the high resolution and collecting area afforded by alma , combined with its great sensitivity to extended emission , promises to revolutionize the field of dense cores studies . on the one hand",
    ", alma will allow studying the dense cores of nearby clouds with the greatest detail , achieving subarcsecond resolution with high sensitivity .",
    "on the other hand , alma will permit the systematic study of dense cores in more distant clouds , enlarging the sample of available targets from the current set of the nearest clouds to cores at distances of at least 1  kpc .",
    "the earliest phase of a core , the so - called starless or pre - stellar stage , is characterized by the lack of a point - like object at its center ( e.g. , di francesco et al . 2007 ) .",
    "this characterization is of course dependent on the current sensitivity limits of the observations , and is therefore susceptible of misclassifying a core with an embedded source of very low luminosity ( see the case of vellos below ) .",
    "still , the significant number of dense cores with no pointlike source detected even after deep spitzer space telescope observations suggests that a population of truly starless cores exists in nearby clouds like taurus ( werner et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "starless cores present systematically a close to constant density of @xmath2-@xmath3 @xmath4 over the central 5000 - 10000 au followed by an almost power - law drop at large distances .",
    "this central flattening of the density profile has been observed in a number of cores using different observational techniques , like millimeter dust continuum emission ( ward - thompson et al .",
    "1999 ) , mir absorption ( bacmann et al . 2000 ) , and nir extinction ( alves et al . 2001 ) , and therefore constitutes a robust result of recent core studies .",
    "the presence of a density flattening provides further evidence that starless cores have not yet developed a central singularity , and that they are of pre - stellar nature .",
    "the physical origin of the flattening , however , is still a matter of debate , as a number of interpretations are consistent with it .",
    "the most natural one is that the profile results from an equilibrium configuration in which the pressure of an isothermal gas balances its gravitational attraction , the so called bonnor - ebert profile ( e.g. , alves et al .",
    "2001 ) . indeed , the gas temperature in a core is typically close to constant ( @xmath0  k ) , and the associated thermal pressure dominates the turbulent component by a factor of several ( e.g. , tafalla et al .",
    "the bonnor - ebert interpretation , however , seems in conflict with the non - spherical shape of most cores ( typical axial ratio is 2:1 , myers et al .",
    "1991 ) , and with the fact that the density contrast observed in cores often exceeds the factor of 14 limit for stability of the bonnor - ebert analysis ( bacmann et al .",
    "2000 ) . additional magnetic field support could be responsible for these deviations from the theoretical expectation , but unfortunately , the observation of this magnetic component is extremely hard to make ( see contribution from crutcher in this volume ) .",
    "even the apparently `` simple '' structure of the cores still eludes our understanding .",
    "when the density distribution of a core , as inferred from dust measurements , is compared with the observed emission from most molecular tracers , it is commonly found that they disagree significantly . as illustrated in fig .  1 for l1498 in taurus , the dust emission of a core often appears centrally concentrated ( with of course a relative flattening at the center ) , while all molecular species but nh@xmath5 and n@xmath6h@xmath7 present ring - like distributions around the continuum peak .",
    "radiative transfer analysis of the molecular emission indicates that the abundance of most species drops by at least a factor of 10 towards the high density peak of the molecular core ( caselli et al .",
    "1999 , bergin et al . 2002 , tafalla et al . 2002 ) .",
    "such strong abundance decrease is suffered by all the c - bearing molecules as well as other species ( like so ) , while it does not affect significantly nh@xmath5 or n@xmath6h@xmath7 ( see di francesco et al .",
    "2007 and bergin & tafalla 2007 for reviews ) .",
    "nh@xmath5 seems in fact to be enhanced toward the center of most cores ( tafalla et al .",
    "2002 ) , while the n@xmath6h@xmath7 abundance tends to have a constant value or may drop at the very center of some cores ( bergin et al .",
    "2002 , pagani et al . 2005 ) .",
    "cores therefore have a differentiated ( onion - like ) molecular composition , with a center rich in nh@xmath5 and n@xmath6h@xmath7 and a series of outer layers containing c - bearing species .    the inhomogeneous composition of the starless dense cores most likely results from the freeze out of the main molecular species onto the cold dust grains at the center ( bergin & langer 1997 , aikawa et al . 2005 ) .",
    "the high densities and low temperatures typical of dense core centers make the freeze out time ( @xmath8 yr ) become much shorter than the core dynamical scale ( @xmath9 1  myr ) , and as a consequence , species like co disappear rapidly from the gas phase .",
    "other molecular species suffer the same fate as co , but more importantly , the original chemical balance , characterized by a relative large co abundance ( @xmath10 ) , is changed dramatically by freeze out .",
    "a new chemical balance emerges , and it is characterized by the enhancement of certain n - bearing species , like n@xmath6h@xmath7 , which are daughter products of n@xmath6 and whose abundance is controlled by the amount of co in the gas phase ( co is the main destroyer of n@xmath6h@xmath7 ) . even as n@xmath6 freezes out on the dust grains with a similar binding energy as co ( berg et al .",
    "2005 ) , the n@xmath6h@xmath7 abundance can increase relatively from its value in the diffuse cloud ( where co is undepleted ) and give rise to the relatively `` high '' abundances ( few 10@xmath11 ) typical of dense cores .",
    "nh@xmath5 can then form from n@xmath6h@xmath7 via dissociative recombination ( geppert et al . 2004 ) , giving rise to the observed central enhancement ( aikawa et al .",
    "2005 ) .",
    "another effect of the co depletion in cores is the enhancement of deuterated species .",
    "deuteration at the low ( 10  k ) temperature of dense cores occurs via the enhancement of h@xmath6d@xmath7 , which then passes the deuterium atom to other species via ion - molecule reactions ( dalgarno & lepp 1984 ) .",
    "as h@xmath6d@xmath7 is mainly destroyed by co , the depletion of co further enhances the h@xmath6d@xmath7 abundance , which in turn enriches in deuterium a number of additional species .",
    "high abundance of h@xmath6d@xmath7 has in fact been observed in the heavily co - depleted dense core l1544 ( caselli et al .",
    "2003 ) , and a correlation of co depletion and high deuteration has been reported by bacmann et al .",
    "( 2003 ) and crapsi et al .",
    "this deuteration in the cold and dense pre - stellar phase is responsible for the extreme deuteration values of species like h@xmath6co , ch@xmath5oh , and nh@xmath5 seen toward protostellar cores ( ceccarelli et al .",
    "1998 , roueff et al .",
    "2000 , van der tak et al .",
    "as cores evolve , they are expected to become more and more centrally concentrated until they reach the point of gravitational instability .",
    "one of the most pressing issues in star formation studies is to understand whether this process of concentration is driven by the loss of magnetic field support via ambipolar diffusion ( e.g. , shu et al .",
    "1987 , mouschovias & ciolek 1999 ) or by the dissipation of turbulence via shocks ( e.g. , maclow & klessen 2004 ) . observations of dense cores can not yet distinguish between these scenarios , but do show a systematic correlation between central concentration and other indicators of evolution , like co depletion and deuterium fractionation ( crapsi et al . 2005 ) .",
    "evidence for inward motions also seems correlated with central concentration , and this suggests that some cores that we see now as starless have already begun collapsing to form stars .",
    "one of the best candidates for such a collapsing system is the l1544 core in taurus , whose pattern of inward motions has been studied in a number of molecules ( tafalla et al .",
    "1998 , williams et al .",
    "1999 , caselli et al .",
    "the l1544 dense core is characterized by a high central density and concentration ( ward - thompson et al .",
    "1999 , tafalla et al .",
    "2002 ) , a high degree of co depletion and deuterium fractionation ( caselli et al . 1999 , 2002 ) , and seems starless despite deep spitzer space telescope observations in the ir ( bourke , private communication ) .",
    "clearly this core , an similar objects , will be prime targets for alma observations .",
    "cores more evolved than l1544 are expected to contain already a luminous object surrounded by an envelope of accreting material .",
    "the little observable difference between the pre and proto - stellar phases of a core is illustrated by the case of l1521f , a core initially thought from molecular data to be an almost twin of l1544 ( crapsi et al .",
    "2004 ) and later found with spitzer observations to have a luminous central star ( bourke et al .",
    "the central object in l1521f has a luminosity close to 0.1  l@xmath12 , and is characteristic of a new group of objects identified by the spitzer telescope and usually referred as vellos ( very low luminosity objects ) .",
    "these vellos seem associated with very weak nir nebulosity and low velocity bipolar outflows ( bourke et al . 2005 ) , and their status in the evolutionary sequence of protostars is still unclear .",
    "although some vellos could represent precursors of substellar objects (  proto brown dwarfs  ) , it seems more likely that in the case of l1521f we are witnessing the very first moments of accretion , when the central source has an extremely low mass .",
    "the proto brown dwarf alternative is unlikely in this case because the dense core has about 5 m@xmath12 of mass ( crapsi et al .",
    "2004 ) , and no clear perturbation seems stopping the accretion ( the outflow has too little mechanical power ) .",
    "the pristine nature of vellos makes them ideal candidates to study star - forming infall motions .",
    "the study of these motions has a long and rich tradition , and is plagued by difficulties as illustrated by the case of b335 .",
    "this dense core harbors a very young ( class 0 ) object whose inward motions were first characterized by zhou et al .",
    "these authors found that the spectral signatures from this core are in good agreement with the expectation from the inside - out collapse model of shu ( 1977 ) .",
    "high resolution observations with the plateau de bure interferometer by wilner et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , however , have shown that some of the signatures of `` infall '' ( like the high velocity wings in the cs lines ) arise in fact from outflow acceleration , and not from an increase in velocity of the infalling material as it approaches the central object .",
    "a revisit of b335 ( and similar objects ) making use of alma s high angular resolution and selecting appropriate ( i.e. , depletion resistant ) tracers is therefore needed to clarify the still confusing picture of star - forming infall motions .",
    "the clean appearance of some vellos , together with their weaker outflow emission , offers an interesting alternative to the more evolved ( and massive ) objects like b335 , that have fully developed outflows . because of their lower mass",
    ", vellos may present weaker signatures of infall and may be tracing the very first moments of collapse .",
    "the combined study of vellos and more luminous class 0 and class i sources should therefore allow us to reconstruct the sequence of star - forming accretion as a function of time .    the presence of a protostar at the center of a core affects not only the gas kinematics but its chemistry .",
    "the newly born star heats up the nearby gas and dust introducing a temperature gradient in its vicinity . in the @xmath13  au region where the dust temperature exceeds the co evaporation temperature ( @xmath14 - 30  k )",
    ", this molecule returns to the gas phase and undoes part of the chemical processing that occurred during the pre - stellar phase ( jrgensen et al .",
    "2004 , jrgensen 2004 ) .",
    "closer to the protostar ( @xmath15  au ) , the dust temperature reaches the 90 - 100  k value at which water evaporates from the grains , further enriching the chemistry . observations of some very young protostellar objects , like iras 16293 - 2422 , show that these very small regions have extreme abundance of a number of complex molecules like hcooh , hcooch@xmath5 , and ch@xmath5och@xmath5 ( cazaux et al .",
    "2003 , bottinelli et al . 2004 ) .",
    "the chemical richness of these regions rivals that of the hot cores around massive protostars , justifying their common denomination as `` hot corinos '' ( ceccarelli et al .",
    "the exact origin of the complex molecules in these regions , however , is still not fully understood .",
    "one possibility is that they result from direct evaporation of species trapped in the water ice , while an alternative is that they result from the processing of simpler evaporated molecules .",
    "even the geometry of hot corinos remains unknown , with the innermost part of the envelope or a more stable disk - like distribution as the most likely locations . despite these temporary uncertainties ,",
    "hot corinos offer a unique opportunity to study the innermost vicinity of low - mass protostars .",
    "their distinctive chemical composition makes them highly selective tracers of the most complex and interesting region of the protostar , where inflow , outflow , and rotation motions play comparable roles , and angular momentum is transfered between different gas components .",
    "hot corino studies with alma will surely constitute some of the first scientific projects of the instrument .",
    "at the same time that protostars accrete material , they eject powerful bipolar outflows of supersonic speed .",
    "co observations of these outflows reveal masses that are too large to originate directly from the central protostar , and indicate that most of the moving gas is core ambient material accelerated by a collimated stellar wind ( lada 1985 ) .",
    "the lobes of bipolar outflows , in addition , commonly coincide with evacuated cavities seen via scattered light from the protostar , further illustrating how the outflow phenomenon represents a major disruption in the core internal structure ( padgett et al . 1999 ) .    despite more than two decades of intense outflow research ,",
    "a number of outstanding problems remain , and alma observations represent our current best hope to solve them ( see also contribution by d. shepherd in this volume ) .",
    "the properties of the underlying wind , for example , are not yet understood , and several alternative models have been proposed over the years .",
    "the two main types of models that attempt to fit the observations are the jet - driven outflow and the wind - driven shell , each of them with a number of flavors ( see bachiller 1996 for a review ) . despite significant successes , however , neither type of model can reproduce the rich variety of kinematic properties found by observations , so each of of them is necessarily incomplete ( lee et al .",
    "2002 ) . in the jet driven model , a highly collimated agent shocks and sweeps cloud material along an almost straight line .",
    "this model succeeds in explaining the highly collimated co outflows often found toward class 0 objects , but fails to reproduce observations of less collimated flows ( usually powered by class i sources ) , where the co emission arises from gas along limb - brightened shells ( like l1551 , see moriarty - schieven et al .",
    "1987 ) . to fit these less collimated systems , the jet models need to broaden the outflow path , and",
    "this has been done by either invoking jet precession/wandering ",
    "( masson & chernin 1993 ) or large - scale bow shocks ( raga & cabrit 1993 ) .",
    "none of these elements however seems consistent with observations ( see arce et al .",
    "2007 for more details ) , and this leaves the jet models limited to fitting the youngest , and admittedly more spectacular , bipolar outflows .",
    "wind - driven models , on the other hand , naturally produce shell - like structures thanks to a wide - angle agent that sweeps ambient material ( shu et al .",
    "these models , unfortunately , do not reproduce the appearance of the highly collimated outflows or the mass - velocity distribution commonly observed even in the poorly collimated flows ( masson & chernin 1992 ) .    a combination of high resolution observations and new developments in outflow modeling are starting to show a possible solution to the current impasse .",
    "interferometer mapping of the outflow powered by the very young source iras 04166 + 2706 in taurus shows both jet and shell features simultaneously ( see fig . 2 and poster contribution by santiago - garca et al .",
    "the jet - like feature in this outflow , seen in both co and sio emission , is extremely rectilinear , appears only at the highest velocities ( between 30 and 50 km s@xmath16 ) , and shows no evidence for precession or wandering .",
    "the shell - like part appears at low velocities ( 2 to 10 km s@xmath16 ) and seems to delineate two opposed cavities with the iras source at their vertex .",
    "this cavity interpretation is supported by the fact that the blue outflow shell coincides with the walls of a nir scattering nebula seen in spitzer images , as expected from its more favorable projection .",
    "in addition , the high velocity jet runs along the axis of the two cavities showing a remarkable degree of symmetry ( see poster contribution for further details ) . the data from iras 04166 + 2706 , therefore , leads to the inevitable conclusion that , at least in some cases , both highly collimated and wide - angle components coexist in the outflow driving agent , and that a model that considers both components simultaneously is needed to explain the observations .",
    "interestingly enough , recent realistic modeling of the interaction between the x - wind of shu et al .",
    "( 1994 ) and a toroidal core shows that both jet and shell components should be observed simultaneously in very young outflows ( shang et al .",
    "this so - called `` unified '' model of bipolar flows shows in fact a remarkable likeness with the iras 04166 + 2706 observations , both in geometry and kinematics ( compare fig .  2 and the models in shang et al .",
    "2006 ) .    the unified outflow model not only unifies the jet and wide - angle aspects of the outflows , but also brings together the evolution of flows and the dense cores , two elements often treated separately .",
    "evidence for outflow - core interaction has been reported in a number of systems ( e.g. , tafalla & myers 1997 , arce & sargent 2006 ) , but no unified framework of how this interaction happens or how outflows and cores evolve in parallel exists yet .",
    "the beautiful simulations of shang et al .",
    "( 2006 ) illustrate how the most important elements of this interaction occur inside the central 1000  au region , which corresponds to less than @xmath17 even towards the most nearby clouds .",
    "high angular resolution observations with alma are clearly needed to sample the complex geometry and kinematics inside this critical region , and thus compare real outflows with their simulated counterparts .",
    "producing a unified picture of the different and interacting processes occurring during the formation of a solar - type star can be one of most significant achievements of alma ."
