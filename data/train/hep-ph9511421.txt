    "despite the success of the standard model ( sm ) in describing the strong and electroweak interactions at energy scales accessible to present colliders , this model is regarded as an incomplete theory .",
    "two of the main theoretical problems with the sm are related to the electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "first , it is hard to understand why the scale of electroweak symmetry breaking is much smaller compared to the planck scale .",
    "second , the existence of fundamental scalars in the sm model is problematical since their masses are unstable under radiative corrections .",
    "both problems are potentially solved in supersymmetric theories . for this and other reasons , since its discovery @xcite",
    ", supersymmetry has received great attention and has become the leading candidate for physics beyond the sm .",
    "the simplest supersymmetric extension of the sm is called the minimal supersymmetric model ( mssm ) @xcite  and it is based on r  parity conservation and minimal particle content .",
    "many experiments have looked for supersymmetric particles , but no signal has been found so far @xcite . the @xmath9 annihilation is a clean environment for searching for new particles , and the lepii collider will have enough energy to look for supersymmetric particles with mass up to about half the center of mass energy , since they are produced in pairs . besides the lightest higgs boson , candidates to be found at lepii are charginos , neutralinos , and sleptons because they are typically lighter than other susy particles . among them ,",
    "the cleanest signatures are produced by charged particles : charginos and charged sleptons .",
    "if a supersymmetric particle is detected at lepii , it is crucial to know what can be learned about the model from the lep measurements . in the case of chargino pair production",
    ", this issue was addressed recently in the case of global supersymmetry @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in supergravity ( sugra ) models with radiatively broken electroweak symmetry , the predictions are more powerful @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , charged sleptons can be lighter than charginos , and for this reason a charged slepton may be the first supersymmetric signal to be detected .    in supergravity models with radiatively broken electroweak symmetry , selectrons are in general not lighter than staus and smuons and , therefore , the latter may be detected first .",
    "but staus and smuons can be produced in @xmath9 colliders only with intermediate photons and @xmath1bosons in the @xmath10channel .",
    "furthermore , couplings of charged sleptons to @xmath11 or @xmath1 depend only on electroweak parameters like the gauge coupling constant @xmath12 , the weak mixing angle @xmath13 , or the electric charge @xmath14 .",
    "this implies that other than the mass of the stau or smuon , and the mass of the decay products ( lightest neutralino ) , it will be hard to extract more information on the supersymmetric parameters of the model with the discovery of these particles .",
    "this is not the case with selectrons .",
    "in addition to intermediate @xmath11 and @xmath1bosons , selectrons may be produced in @xmath9 colliders with intermediate neutralinos in the @xmath15channel , and therefore , its production cross section depends on the neutralino sector and is sensible to important supersymmetric parameters .    in global supersymmetry , many authors have studied the selectron pair production in @xmath9 colliders @xcite , and also the production of off - shell selectrons @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to study this process in the context of supergravity models , where the parameters are tightly constrained , and therefore the predictive power is greater .",
    "we will demonstrate that the experimental observables associated with the detection of a pair of selectrons , , the total production cross section , the mass of the selectron , and the mass of its main decay product , the lightest neutralino , allow us to calculate the supersymmetric parameters that define the model , and through them , to predict the entire supersymmetric spectrum .",

    "we see that @xmath218 gev for @xmath219 , and @xmath220 gev for @xmath221 are the lowest possible values for which their br start to be compatible with the experimental bound .",
    "however an improvement of this measurement would soon discard most of these scenarios with @xmath214 , having perhaps those with @xmath205 as the only surviving ones . in any case",
    "let s stress the fact that , in the region of the parameter space so far analyzed , @xmath202 gives a much lighter spectrum and therefore a bigger cross section for the production of selectrons .",
    "if right selectrons are discovered at lepii , measurements of the total cross section @xmath222 , the selectron mass @xmath223 , and the mass of the lightest neutralino @xmath224 will be available with some degree of experimental error . by looking at fig .",
    "11 we can see how these measurements can be used to test the model . in this figure",
    "we plot the total cross section as a function of the neutralino mass for constant values of the selectron mass @xmath225 and 86 gev , and both signs of @xmath3 . in each case",
    ", curves of constant @xmath0 are shown .",
    "we appreciate that the dependence of the cross section both on @xmath0 and sign(@xmath3 ) is weak , therefore , in a first stage where experimental errors may be high , we will not be able to predict the value of these important parameters from these measurements alone , since @xmath226 depends strongly on this parameter , as we can see from fig .",
    "nevertheless , it will be possible to test the model , because the curves corresponding to one value of @xmath223 are close together and reasonably apart from the group of curves corresponding to the other value of @xmath223 .",
    "for this to happen , there is a maximum tolerable experimental error on the selectron mass which is obvious from the figure . in the next experimental stage , where precision measurements are available",
    ", it will be possible to predict both the values of @xmath0 and sign(@xmath3 ) .",
    "despite of the multi - dimensional free parameter space that minimal supergravity predicts , many phenomenological restrictions can be used altogether to reduce the possible values of the soft terms that define the spectrum .",
    "apart from the direct experimental limits on susy particles and z  pole physics , we have also imposed constraints coming from a prediction of these spectra for the br of @xmath227 compatible with the experimental value , and from the requirement that the lps should be neutral .",
    "the discovery of selectrons at lepii will allow us to test the remaining minimal sugra scenarios . in a stage where experimental errors are large , lep measurements , like the total production cross section @xmath228 , the selectron mass @xmath223 , and the lightest neutralino mass @xmath224 , will validate or rule out the model in its simplest form . in this scenario ,",
    "other supersymmetric particles are light enough to be produced at lepii . among them",
    "is the lightest cp - even neutral higgs boson @xmath141 , whose discovery and measurement of its mass can give us an important insight into the value of @xmath0 and sign(@xmath3 ) . on the other hand , in a stage where precision measurements of the observables mentioned above are available , information on the value of @xmath0 and the sign of @xmath3 can be directly obtained , and with it , the entire supergravity spectrum can be predicted .",
    "the work of bdec was supported by a spanish mec postdoctoral fellowship for most of the time while this research was carried out , and by a pparc postdoctoral fellowship during the final stages of it .",
