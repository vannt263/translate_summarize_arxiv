    "a quasi - thermal photosphere is expected in all grb ejecta ( cavallo & rees 1978 ; goodman 1986 ; shemi & piran 1990 ) , either due to pairs or to baryonic electrons , in addition to a possible non - thermal component from dissipation ( shocks or reconnection ) .",
    "preponderance of one or the other depends on whether the photosphere occurs inside or outside the saturation radius where the bulk lorentz factor saturates to the dimensionless entropy of the outflow . below the saturation radius ,",
    "the photospheric luminosity dominates whereas above it the greater part of the energy is in kinetic form . in the latter case , the energy available in the from of radiation or pairs depends on the variable portion of the outflow and the efficiency of dissipation in shocks ( daigne & mochkovitch 2002 ; ramirez - ruiz et al .",
    "2002 ) , or on the reconnection efficiency ( mszros & rees 2000 ) .",
    "in this letter we investigate the relationship between the quasi - thermal baryon - related photosphere in relativistic outflows , and the internal shock arising around this limiting radius .",
    "this photosphere is a source of soft thermal radiation , which may be observationally detectable in some grb spectra ( murakami et al . 1991 ) . in these models",
    ", dissipation happens whenever internal shocks develop in the ejecta ( rees & mszros 1994 ) , which reconverts some fraction of the kinetic energy into radiation .",
    "if this dissipation takes place below the photosphere , the non - thermal shock luminosity could compensate for the adiabatic decrease of the post - saturation photospheric luminosity , so that the radiative efficiency in the outflow would be high .",
    "the relative roles of photosphere and shocks are reexamined in section 2 .",
    "a solution is presented in section 3 for the spectrum of high energy @xmath0-rays confined to a quasi - thermal baryonic photosphere and the possible non thermal spectral distortions in it .",
    "the relation of theses ideas to grb phenomenology is outlined in section 4 .",
    "consider a relativistic wind outflow expanding from some initial minimum radius @xmath1 cm , where the wind baryon load @xmath2 is parametrized by a dimensionless entropy @xmath3 .",
    "we then assume that the actual value of @xmath4 ( or @xmath5 ) is unsteady .",
    "the lorentz factor saturates to @xmath6 at a saturation radius @xmath7 where the wind energy density , in radiation or in magnetic energy , drops below the baryon rest mass density in the comoving frame ( shemi & piran 1990 ) . the location of the baryonic photosphere , where @xmath8 , due to electrons associated with baryons , is @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "the above equation holds provided that @xmath4 is low enough that the wind has already reached its _ terminal _ lorentz factor at @xmath12 .",
    "this requires ( mszros & rees 2000 ) @xmath13    if the value of @xmath4 at the base increases by a factor @xmath14 over a timescale @xmath15 , then the later ejecta will catch up and dissipate a significant fraction of their energy at some radius @xmath16 given by @xmath17 the shocks can not occur when @xmath18 since in this region both shells accelerate at the same rate @xmath19 and do not catch up . in order for a shock to occur above a photosphere which is in the coasting region @xmath20",
    "if one takes @xmath21 , where @xmath22 .",
    "if , on the other hand , @xmath23 sec , then @xmath24 .",
    "the initial wind starts to decelerate when it has swept up @xmath25 of its initial mass .",
    "for sufficiently high @xmath4 , the deceleration radius can formally become smaller than the collisional radius of equation ( [ eq : rint ] ) .",
    "this requires @xmath26 this deceleration allows slower ejecta to catch up , replenishing and re - energising the reverse shock and boosting the momentum in the blast wave .",
    "1 shows the schematic world - lines of a relativistic outflow with a range of lorentz factors .",
    "we identify three types of contributions to the observed time history , each with a different character . for a relatively low lorentz factor @xmath27 , as in curve ( a ) of fig .",
    "1 , the radius @xmath28 , and the dissipation occurs before the wind is optically thin . below the baryonic photosphere",
    ", shocks would occur at high optical depths .",
    "section 3 investigates the relationship between the quasi - thermal baryon - related photosphere in relativistic outflows and the internal shocks arising near this limiting region . for a larger lorentz factor @xmath29 , corresponding to curve ( c ) of fig .",
    "1 , the ejecta would expand freely until the contact discontinuity had been decelerated by sweeping up external material .",
    "it would then crash into the reverse shock , thermalising its energy and boosting the power of the afterglow .",
    "the impact of such collisions on the prompt emission have been studied in ramirez - ruiz , merloni & rees ( 2001 ) . in curve ( b ) , with intermediate @xmath4 , deceleration occurs at radii @xmath30 , and dissipation takes place when the wind is optically thin ( i.e. when it is most effective ) .      the lab - frame baryonic photospheric luminosity @xmath31 and dimensionless temperature @xmath32 evolve as @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the initial temperature at @xmath35 . using the expression for @xmath36 , this can be written as @xmath37 for @xmath38 and @xmath39 otherwise .",
    "the internal shocks in the wind can dissipate a fraction of the terminal kinetic energy luminosity @xmath5 above the saturation radius @xmath40 , @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is a bolometric radiative efficiency when the cooling timescale is shorter than the dynamical time . if the poynting flux provides a fraction @xmath43 of the total luminosity @xmath5 at the base of the wind ( at @xmath35 ) , the magnetic field there is @xmath44 g. the comoving magnetic field at @xmath45 is @xmath46 g. if the electrons are accelerated in the dissipation shocks to a lorentz factor @xmath47 , the ratio of the synchrotron cooling time to the dynamic expansion time in the comoving frame is @xmath48 so a very high radiative efficiency is ensured even for @xmath15 as high as seconds .",
    "it is therefore clear that a magnetic field can ensure efficient cooling even if it is not strong enough to be dynamically significant ( i.e. even for @xmath49 ) .    for a given @xmath5 ,",
    "an individual burst is characterized by an average @xmath4 . for @xmath50 ,",
    "the photosphere arises in the accelerating region , and in this region shocks are not possible . for @xmath51 , we have @xmath52 , so that the baryonic photospheric component dominates the non - thermal internal shock component in a bolometric sense .",
    "low values of @xmath4 lead to further out , weaker photospheres and , at the same time , relative stronger shocks occurring near the photosphere . for @xmath53 , the thermal photospheric peak will tend to blend with the synchrotron peak , resembling the canonical non thermal grb spectrum . for lower @xmath27 ,",
    "the thermal peak is even softer with @xmath54 , while shocks occur closer in and produce harder synchrotron peaks ( ramirez - ruiz & lloyd - ronning 2002 ) .",
    "the corresponding shocks occur below ( or near ) the baryonic photosphere where the scattering depth of the shells is larger ( panaitescu et  al .",
    "1999 ; ramirez - ruiz & lloyd - ronning 2002 , kobayashi et  al .",

    "[ comptfig ] , most of the luminosity at low energies results from @xmath0-ray downscattering .",
    "so far we have approximated the electrons in the medium to have zero temperature and have assumed that compton scattering is the main interaction process for @xmath0-rays .",
    "compton cooling of @xmath0-rays , however , produces a population of secondary energetic electrons .",
    "the fate of these electrons depends on the composition , ionization state and magnetic field present in the medium , as well as on the energy density of the background radiation .",
    "when the energy density in the ( black body ) photospheric photons is much larger than the energy in scattered photons ( i.e. @xmath52 ) , the secondary electrons will lose energy mostly in collisions with the photospheric photons and form a secondary photon spectrum .",
    "this is the situation considered in this section .",
    "to first approximation , the scattering medium can be considered as a cold plasma if the time between successive scatterings , @xmath84 , is much longer than the characteristic cooling time of the secondary electrons , @xmath85 . here",
    "@xmath86 and @xmath87 are the energy densities of the continuously injected photons and the photospheric radiation , respectively .",
    "the secondary electrons created by downscattering compton cooled before the next generation of hot electrons is created if @xmath88 ) .",
    "therefore , the bulk of the injected radiation is likely to be scattered by cooled particles when @xmath52 . in what follows",
    "we assume the scattering medium to be `` cold '' since it greatly reduces the calculations .",
    "a detailed discussion of the relevance of a hot scattering medium , its steady state solutions for various input spectra , and its range of applicability ( i.e @xmath89 ) will be presented in future work .",
    "the injected photons repeatedly downscatter to form a steady state distribution . during this process , a population of secondary",
    ", energetic electrons is injected .",
    "down - scattering of @xmath0-rays on a cold medium produces secondary electrons at a rate @xmath90 where @xmath0 is the electron lorentz factor and @xmath91 is the steady state photon density distribution . here",
    "$ ] is the minimum energy required for a photon to up - scatter an electron from rest to the energy @xmath0 .",
    "the maximum energy of the secondary electrons is then given by @xmath93 .",
    "these secondary electrons could lose their energy mainly through synchrotron or compton energy - loss mechanisms .",
    "one or both of these mechanisms may be present , depending on the bulk lorentz factor , the isotropic equivalent total energy of the burst , and the efficiency of dissipation in shocks . in the previous section we discussed the criteria for the non - thermal component to dominate over , or",
    "be dominated by , the photospheric thermal component .",
    "a photosphere should be prominent in the lowest baryon load cases.the black body photons can then act as seeds for scattering to higher energies , if there is substantial amount of energy in scattering centers .",
    "alfvn waves generated by magnetic field reconnection or mhd turbulence can act as such centers .",
    "repeated scattering on the alfvn waves acts in the same way as comptonisation off hot electrons .",
    "electrons resulting from down - scattering will therefore lose energy mostly in collisions with the photospheric emission when the energy density in the photospheric blackbody exceeds the scattered one .",
    "the steady state electron distribution ( blumenthal & gould 1970 ) is given by @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the blackbody photon density distribution .",
    "the production rate of secondary high - energy photons ( i.e. @xmath96 ) produced by the upscatter of blackbody photons by the secondary electrons is given by @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the rate of scatterings of electrons from @xmath0 to @xmath99 on blackbody photons .",
    "zdziarski ( 1988 ) has given an explicit expression for @xmath100 .",
    "the assumption of negligible photon - photon pair production guarantees that collisions between secondary electrons and black body photons take place in the @xmath101 limit . the total rate of photon injection is then given by @xmath102 .",
    "this photon rate results in a new steady state photon distribution ( [ eqn : kineq ] ) , and , in turn , a new secondary electron production rate ( [ elec ] ) .",
    "the production rate of secondary photons resulting from scatterings of the new secondary energetic electrons with the black body photons is calculated and subsequently added to the total rate of photon injection .",
    "this procedure is repeated until convergence is achieved ( i.e. @xmath103 for @xmath104 ) . for each step",
    "the integral equation ( [ eqn : kineq ] ) is solved with the scattering probability ( [ eqn : scprob ] ) numerically by iteration ( see e.g. right panel of fig .",
    "[ comptfig ] ) .",
    "[ comptall ] illustrates the effect of compton up - scattering of photospheric blackbody photons at @xmath105 by secondary electrons .",
    "the dotted curve shows the steady state photon distribution with the inclusion of the soft black - body photons while the black dashed line gives the photon distribution after only the first iteration procedure .",
    "the photons from photospheric upscattering dominate the spectrum at @xmath74 .",
    "the highest energy ( upscattered ) photospheric photons are produced by relativistic electrons from compton downscattering of the primary photons . at lower energies , on the other hand , the upscattered photospheric photons are due to electrons arising from multiple scattered photons .",
    "the importance of the upscattered photospheric photons at @xmath106 depends mainly on the low - energy tail distribution of the primary photons and thus its effect on the photon spectra increases with subsequent iterations .",
    "this emission could be responsible for the x - ray excess observed in some grbs .",
    "in contrast , at higher energies , the injected photon distribution ( i.e. @xmath107 ) is not significantly alter by subsequent iterations and the role of upscattered photospheric photons to the high - energy spectra can be estimated with only a few iterations .",
    "one does not expect this scattered photospheric component to be a pure wien spectrum , since in order to change the shape of a soft spectrum and make it into a dilute black body spectrum would require that each photon be scattered @xmath108 times by a population of electrons in thermal equilibrium .",
    "this requires an optical depth much larger than unity , which is generally not the case anywhere near the photosphere .",
    "the scattering depth per shock due to pairs is also unlikely to be much larger , because the scattering and the pair - formation cross sections are comparable , and unless dissipation and pair formation occurs uniformly throughout the entire volume , down - scattering of photons above the pair threshold rapidly leads to self - shielding ( mszros et al . 2002 ) .",
    "the standard internal shock model of grb is generally assumed to produce its observed non thermal radiation by synchrotron ( or possibly inverse compton ) process . here ,",
    "in addition to synchrotron we have also considered in more detail the role of the outflow photosphere and of possible non thermal distortions in it .",
    "a strong baryonic photosphere component should be present at the beginning of bursts .",
    "however , the farther beyond the coasting radius the photosphere occurs , the weaker its energy fraction is relative to the primary injected photons arising from internal shocks , because its energy drops as @xmath109 .",
    "the problem of reprocessing x - rays and @xmath0-rays by compton scattering could be the key to understanding the x - ray excess above the power - law extrapolation from higher energies observed in a non - negligible fraction of bursts ( kippen et al .",
    "2001 ; heise et al .",
    "2001 ; amati et al . 2002 ; lloyd - ronning & ramirez - ruiz 2002 ; sakamoto et al . 2005 ) , although smoothing and softening could be stronger where there is substantial pair formation ( pilla & loeb 1998 ; ghisellini & celotti 1999 ; mszros et al . 2002 ; peer & waxman 2004 ) .",
    "if there were a power - law non - thermal spectrum in which significant fraction of the resulting photons are above 1 mev in the comoving frame , then pair production will change the situation .",
    "photons with a few mev energies in the comoving frame will then be converted into pairs with very modest @xmath0 provided that the compactness parameter is more than unity .",
    "the pairs will generally have relativistic energies , and will themselves participate in the synchrotron and inverse compton emission ( peer & waxman 2004 ) . in reality the actual time dependence for an unsteady outflow leading to shocks , pair formation , and comptonisation could be more complicated .    if both a photospheric and a shock component are detected , one would expect the thermal photospheric luminosity ( and its non thermal part , if present ) to vary on similar timescales as the non thermal synchrotron component ( unless the shock efficiency is radius dependent , or unless one or both are beyond @xmath110 , in which case @xmath111 imposes a lower limit on the corresponding variability timescale ) .",
    "the luminosity in a given band ( e.g. _ swift _ ) probably varies differently , since the thermal peak energy is @xmath112 and falls off steeply , while the synchrotron peak energy varies @xmath113 and falls off more slowly .",
    "a preferred low - energy break ( fig .",
    "3 ) could be attributed to a scattered photospheric component , provided the baryon loads are low or the outflow variability timescales are large ( fig .",
    "1 ) . this still requires a relatively strong shock synchrotron component , or possibly alfvn wave comptonisation in the photosphere ( e.g. thompson 1994 ) , to explain the high - energy power - law spectra .",
    "it would also imply a pronounced upward change of slope above the x - ray excess , from the thermal peak to a flatter power law in all bursts where a low break is observed .",
    "further data on x - ray and @xmath0-ray spectral features during the burst ( as opposed to the afterglow ) , will surely offer important clues to the nature of the bulk flow and the macroscopic source of energy driving the microscopic processes of particle acceleration and cooling .",
