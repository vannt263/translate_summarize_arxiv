    "different approaches to integrability of partial differential equations ( pdes ) , @xcite , are based on their diverse but related properties such as existence infinite hierarchies of ( local or nonlocal ) symmetries and/or conservation laws , zero - curvature representations ( zcr ) , bi - hamiltonian structures , recursion operators , etc .",
    "much progress was achieved in the study of pdes with two independent variables . in particular , in a big number of examples it was shown that a pde  integrable in the sense of presence of a zcr  with a non - removable parameter ( we call such equations _ lax - integrable _ ) have infinite hierarchies of higher local symmetries , see , e.g. , @xcite . in the multidimensional case",

    ", we present five examples of multi - dimensional systems with higher local symmetries .",
    "all these systems are defined as cotangent coverings , @xcite , for lax - integrable pdes with three or four independent variables , namely , for the r - th dispersionsless dym equation , @xcite , @xmath0 the r - th dispersionsless kp equation , @xcite , @xmath1 the veronese web equation , @xcite , @xmath2 with @xmath3 , the universal hierarchy equation , @xcite , @xmath4 and for the 4-dimensional analogue of  ,  @xcite , @xmath5 introduced in @xcite .",

    "we make an observation that all the symmetries of the cotangent coverings of equations   with @xmath7 , with @xmath8 , and   with @xmath9 up to order 5 are the point symmetries .",
    "this leads to a conjecture that the cotangent coverings of equations  , , have local higher symmetries whenever these equations are lax - integrable .",
    "if this claim turns out to be correct , it will be a valuable refinement of the observations of @xcite .    in the last section , we consider _ lagrangian deformations _ of cotangent coverings to some of the equations considered above and construct variational bivectors ,",
