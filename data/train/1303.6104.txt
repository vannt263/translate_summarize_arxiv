    "as an intriguing consequence of their presence , fluctuations of an embedding medium may manifest themselves in terms of effective forces acting on its confining boundaries .",
    "the critical casimir force is such a fluctuation - induced force which arises due to the emergence of long - ranged thermal fluctuations if a fluid close to a second - order phase transition is confined between surfaces .",
    "this phenomenon , first predicted by fisher and de  gennes @xcite is the analog of the casimir effect in quantum electrodynamics @xcite .",
    "reference @xcite provides a recent review which illustrates analogies as well as differences between these two effects and guides the reader towards further reviews of the subject and the pertinent original literature .",
    "the dependence of the critical casimir force on the distance between the confinements and on temperature is characterized by a universal scaling function , which is determined by the bulk and surface universality classes ( uc ) @xcite of the confined system .",
    "it is independent of microscopic details of the system , and its form depends only on a few global and general properties , such as the spatial dimension @xmath0 , the number of components of the order parameter , the shape of the confinement , and the type of boundary conditions ( bc ) @xcite .    in recent years the critical casimir effect has attracted numerous experimental @xcite and even more theoretical investigations .",
    "critical casimir forces can be inferred indirectly by studying wetting films of fluids close to a critical end point @xcite . in this context , @xmath1he wetting films close to the onset of superfluidity @xcite and wetting films of classical @xcite and quantum @xcite binary liquid mixtures have been studied experimentally .",
    "only recently direct measurements of the critical casimir force have been reported @xcite by monitoring individual colloidal particles immersed into a binary liquid mixture close to its critical demixing point and exposed to a planar wall .",
    "the critical casimir effect has also been studied via its influence on aggregation phenomena @xcite .",
    "not only the strength of critical casimir forces can be tuned by small temperature changes but even their sign depends on the bc of the confining boundaries .",
    "the two interfaces of a @xmath1he film impose a symmetry - preserving dirichlet bc [ denoted by @xmath2 on the superfluid order - parameter at both sides of the film , which causes attractive critical casimir forces leading to a thinning of the film near the @xmath3 transition @xcite .",
    "however , for classical binary liquid mixtures ( or simple fluids ) , surfaces preferentially adsorb one of the two species of the mixture ( or the gaseous or the liquid phase of a simple fluid , respectively ) .",
    "this corresponds to symmetry - breaking bc ( denoted as @xmath4 or @xmath5 bc ) acting on the order parameter which is , e.g. , the concentration difference in a binary liquid . within the theoretical description @xmath6 bc",
    "are realized by surface fields and the @xmath7 bc by their absence .",
    "the emergence of long - ranged thermal fluctuations close to a second - order phase transition leads to a mesoscopic extent of the adsorption layer close to surfaces with @xmath6 bc . depending on whether the adsorption preferences of the confining surfaces of the fluid are the same @xmath8 or different @xmath9 , critical casimir forces acting on them are either attractive @xmath8 or repulsive @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "the critical casimir force between walls with @xmath6 bc is the combined effect of the change of the fluctuation spectrum due to the confinement and the interference of the adsorption layers , which are present even within mean - field theory .",
    "the shapes of the adsorption layers themselves are strongly influenced by non - gaussian fluctuations , i.e. , they differ from mean - field predictions . in this sense , the effective forces acting on surfaces which confine a ( near- ) critical fluid provide a classical analog of the casimir effect both in the case of symmetry - breaking and in the case of symmetry - preserving bc .",
    "early theoretical investigations of the critical casimir force used , to a large extent , field - theoretical methods ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite for a list of references ) .",
    "only recently have monte carlo ( mc ) simulations allowed for their quantitatively reliable computation .",
    "early numerical simulations for the critical casimir force have been employed in ref .",
    "@xcite for the film geometry with laterally homogeneous bc .",
    "more recently the critical casimir force has been determined by numerical simulations for the @xmath10 uc @xcite , which describes the critical properties of the superfluid phase transition in @xmath1he , as well as the ising uc @xcite which describes , _ inter alia _ , the experimentally relevant demixing transition in a binary liquid mixture .",
    "since casimir forces may affect or empower future devices on the micro- and nanoscales , their modifications due to the presence of nano- or microstructures on the substrates has been a topic of intense research during the past decade .",
    "recent theoretical and experimental studies of qed casimir forces ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) as well as critical casimir forces @xcite for _ topologically _ structured substrates exhibit remarkable deviations from the corresponding ones for planar walls as well as the occurrence of lateral forces .",
    "however , only _ chemically _ patterned substrates allow for interesting combinations of attractive and repulsive critical casimir forces so that , among the various realizations of the critical casimir effect , the force in the presence of a chemically patterned substrate has recently attracted particular interest @xcite .",
    "experiments with binary liquid mixtures as solvents have been used to study critical casimir forces acting on dissolved colloids close to a chemically structured substrate @xcite , which creates a laterally varying adsorption preference for both components of the solvent .",
    "such kind of systems have been investigated theoretically for the film geometry within mean - field theory @xcite , within gaussian approximation @xcite , and with mc simulations in a three - dimensional film geometry in the presence of a single chemical step @xcite .",
    "the critical casimir force in the presence of a patterned substrate has also been studied in the case of a sphere near a planar wall within the derjaguin approximation @xcite .",
    "if the lateral chemical patterns do not consist of stripes with sharp chemical steps between areas of strong but opposite adsorption preferences , one faces spatial regions characterized by surface fields of medium strength .",
    "this case has been studied so far only for laterally homogeneous bc in the presence of variable boundary fields .",
    "this case already gives rise to interesting crossover phenomena , which have been studied within mean - field theory @xcite , by exact calculations in two spatial dimensions @xcite , and with mc simulations @xcite .",
    "motivated by the aforementioned experimental results , and based on previous investigations by two of the authors @xcite , here we present a mc study of a three - dimensional lattice model in the film geometry , representing the ising uc in the presence of a chemically striped substrate .",
    "moreover , we compare the universal scaling functions of the critical casimir forces obtained from these mc results with the corresponding mean - field results , which we obtain by generalizing a previous study @xcite and which are valid in @xmath11 spatial dimensions .",
    "we employ periodic boundary conditions in the lateral directions and different bc for the two surfaces confining the slab . to this end",
    ", we consider a film of thickness @xmath12 confined along the normal @xmath13 direction on one side by a surface at which the order parameter of the fluid exhibits a laterally homogeneous bc which corresponds either to strong adsorption @xmath4 or to the so - called ordinary surface transition @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "the other side of the film is confined by a surface which is periodically patterned by stripes leading to strong , alternating adsorption preferences corresponding to @xmath4 or @xmath5 bc , respectively , varying along the lateral @xmath14-direction .     so that the period @xmath15 . ]        here we focus on stripes of equal width @xmath16 corresponding to half of the period @xmath17 along the @xmath14-direction , so that the important geometrical parameter is given by @xmath18 , which relates the width of the stripes to the film thickness ( see figs .  [ bcstripes ] and [ bcopenstripes ] ) . within the lattice model",
    "this system is realized by either fixing the ising spins in the upper surface to @xmath19 or imposing an open boundary by not fixing them , whereas the lower surface consists of alternating stripes of equal width , where the spins are fixed to @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "the chemical steps separating the stripes are taken to be sharp .",
    "our results show that , in the limit of stripe widths small compared to the film thickness , the lower surface effectively realizes dirichlet bc .",
    "such bc can also be obtained in the presence of a surface characterized by a locally random adsorption preference , such that on average there is no preferential adsorption for one of the two species @xcite .",
    "thus the system reduces for @xmath21 to @xmath22 or @xmath23 bc , and , in order to be able to compare with this limiting case , here we also consider a film in which both surfaces have a laterally homogeneous bc from the outset ( see figs .",
    "[ bcplusopen ] and [ bcopenopen ] ) .",
    "this may provide a novel possibility of studying also symmetry - preserving bc for simple fluids and binary liquid mixtures which are difficult to establish experimentally otherwise @xcite .            in order to extract universal quantities from mc simulations , it is important to take corrections to scaling into account in order to be able to extrapolate data for systems of finite size @xmath12 to the thermodynamic limit @xmath24 . in particular , in the standard three - dimensional ising model , scaling corrections are proportional to @xmath25 , with @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "the presence of nonperiodic boundary conditions , such as in the direction normal to the film , gives rise to additional scaling corrections , the leading one being proportional to @xmath27 , which is numerically difficult to disentangle from the previous one .",
