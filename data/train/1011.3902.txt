    "at present , the yakutsk array is measuring the soft component of eas with 58 stations , muons with 6 underground detectors , and cherenkov light with 48 pmts .",
    "all detectors are irregularly distributed within a 10 km@xmath4 array area ( fig .",
    "[ fig : map ] ) ; the target energy range of investigations is @xmath5 ev to @xmath6 ev .",
    "more technical details and physical results are given in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "our next task is to modernize the array in order to obtain a precise instrument capable of measuring the highest - energy galactic crs  their sources , energy spectrum , and mass composition .",
    "related to this , we also aim to study a transition region between galactic and extragalactic components of crs where some irregularities in spectrum and composition may be revealed .",
    "a crucial clue in this approach is the accurate determination of the mass composition of crs , which is a weak point of existing giant eas arrays . in this context",
    "we plan to adapt the well - known atmospheric cherenkov telescope technique ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to measure the angular and temporal structure of the signal connected to eas longitudinal profiles above @xmath7 ev .",
    "the idea is not to concentrate on discriminating the gamma - ray initiated showers from the hadronic showers ; instead , all showers from different primary particles will be detected by the wide field of view ( fov ) telescopes in coincidence with the array detectors .",
    "the angular and temporal parameters of showers measured will then be analyzed to identify eas primary particles .",
    "longitudinal shower profile measurements can also be used to estimate some hadronic interaction parameters @xcite .",
    "experimental arguments in elucidating the origin of the knee and ankle in cr spectrum will significantly strengthen due to the estimation of mass composition in the energy range relevant .",
    "existing models ( e.g. , listed in introduction ) are very different in composition expected around the knee and ankle , so the estimation of the average mass of the primaries in addition to the improved measurement of the sharpness of the knee / ankle should allow us to discriminate between models .",
    "another important step in the adaptation is the essential reduction in the size and cost of the telescope .",
    "this is possible through increased threshold energy because the total number of cherenkov photons emitted by eas relativistic electrons is proportional to the shower energy .",
    "if we compare one of the high - energy stereoscopic system ( hess ) telescopes ( diameter @xmath8 m , @xmath9 ev /www.mpi - hd.mpg.de / hfm / hess / hess.shtml/ ) with that reduced to @xmath8 cm , then the number of cherenkov photons detected from eas is comparable at @xmath0 ev . hence , in our energy range , the set of cherenkov telescopes with @xmath8 cm is approximately equivalent to hess functioning in the energy range @xmath10 ev ; this is , of course , excepting the event rate : cr intensity ratio in two energy intervals is @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the integral spectrum index .",
    "it is well known that the angular and temporal structure of cherenkov light emitted by eas can be used to infer the longitudinal development parameters of a shower @xcite .",
    "the angular distribution of a cherenkov signal from eas was calculated by @xcite , where it was assumed that the angular distribution of emitted photons is determined by that of electrons in the shower .",
    "@xcite then proposed using the pulse shape of the cherenkov signal , namely the pulse width , to indicate the shower maximum position @xmath1 in the atmosphere .",
    "experimental measurements of the cherenkov signal pulse shape were performed in yakutsk in 19731979 .",
    "the pulse width was measured in the core distance interval ( 100,800 ) m for the shower size @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "the results were used not only to estimate @xmath1 , but attempts were also made to evaluate the eas cascade curve at energies around @xmath14 ev @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the angular and temporal resolutions of optical instruments and data - acquisition systems at that time were not sufficient to obtain the accuracy required to distinguish eas primaries and/or nuclear interaction models",
    ".    to verify the ability of the cherenkov telescope to discriminate angular and temporal profiles of signals from showers initiated by primary nuclei and photons at energies above @xmath5 ev , we modeled the process .",
    "the same assumptions as in @xcite are used to describe the cherenkov light emission in atmosphere by the vertical eas : the energy spectrum of electrons is taken at @xmath15 ( shower maximum ) ; the spatial distribution of electrons is neglected ; angular distributions of electrons and cherenkov photons are gaussian ; and the time of flight to detector for photons is given by @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the refraction coefficient of air , @xmath18 is height , and @xmath19 is axis distance .    in this crude approximation",
    "the number of photons is given by the integral of the eas cascade curve multiplied by the function giving the contribution of an electron to the cherenkov light flux at a given @xmath19 and depth in the atmosphere @xcite .",
    "as the cascade curve , we used the gamma - distribution approximation of the hires results @xcite . in the energy range @xmath20 ev beyond the reach of hires , we used nexus2 model simulation results for showers initiated by @xmath21 @xcite . a difference in @xmath22 of showers from proton and iron nuclei in this model",
    "was also employed as the input parameter for the cascade curve from hires . for the @xmath23-initiated showers ,",
    "the greisen formula was used .",
    "m from the axis .",
    "vertical showers ( @xmath7 ev ) are shown .",
    "the areas within dotted curves represent the intrinsic fluctuations of the showers . ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig : angular ] the angular distribution of cherenkov light in the detector at @xmath24 m is shown .",
    "the eas primaries are @xmath21 , and @xmath23 with @xmath7 ev .",
    "it appears from this that the angular resolution @xmath25 of the cherenkov telescope is sufficient to distinguish the primaries ( @xmath0 ev ) , at least the @xmath23-quanta from the nuclei , based on the angular distribution of the signal alone .",
    "another parameter that has been suggested by the pioneers is the temporal characteristic of the cherenkov signal from eas . in fig .",
    "[ fig : temporal ] the results of our simulations are shown . in this case",
    "the approximation used is too rough , so that the half width of the signal is overestimated by @xmath26 in comparison with the actual value measured in yakutsk @xcite and with more precise simulations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "nevertheless , assuming that the overestimation is independent of the primary particle type ( diminishing the widths of the signals to 0.7 in all three cases ) , we can conclude that the time resolution @xmath27 ns is sufficient to distinguish the primaries at @xmath0 ev .",
    "shower fluctuations characterized by @xmath28 g / cm@xmath4 , for @xmath30 primaries respectively , are shown by the dotted curves in figs [ fig : angular ] ,  [ fig : temporal ] .",
    "conclusions about the possibility to distinguish primaries do not weaken because of fluctuations less than the differences caused by the primaries .",
    "more reliable results will be achieved by combining both the angular and the temporal measurements in one experiment .",
    "recent developments in the pmt industry have made it possible to dramatically reduce the size of cherenkov telescopes .",
    "for example , the imaging camera for the hess telescope consists of 960 pmts each with a photocathode area of @xmath31 cm@xmath4 ( pixel size ) . proportionally reducing the area of mirror and camera 10@xmath32 times",
    ", we should have a pixel size of @xmath33 mm@xmath4 for the same angular resolution .    a newly developed semiconductor light - sensor , the so - called geiger - mode avalanche photodiode ( g - apd , or silicon",
    "pmt ) , typically has a sensitive area of @xmath34 mm@xmath4 covered by 100 to 10@xmath32 cells .",
    "this is larger than we need , but on the other hand , the mirror diameter can be greater than 13 cm .",
    "application of this type of light - sensor is currently being widely discussed ",
    "see for example @xcite  and there are examples of cameras designed with appropriate data - acquisition systems ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "another type of light - sensor applicable to the cherenkov mini - telescope is position - sensitive pmt . in this case",
    "the flat multi - anode is segmented in @xmath35 pixels ( @xmath36 for hamamatsu products ; pixel area @xmath37 mm@xmath4 ) .",
    "we selected hamamatsu r2486 pmt with a @xmath38 crossed wire anode for the prototype detector .",
    "the pmt is used as an imaging camera placed near the focus of a spherical mirror . because the radius of the r2486 photocathode is 3 cm ,",
    "the mirror diameter was chosen to be d = 26 cm , and the radius of curvature r = 22.5 cm .",
    "the mirror parameters were optimized to provide as wide a fov as possible where the image distortions are less than the given pixel size .",
    "the result of modeling in the plane intersecting the mirror optical axis is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : scans ] . the light intensity emitted by the distant point sources with slant angles @xmath42",
    "is shown as a function of the axis distance on the camera surface .",
    "the root - mean - square radius of the light spot averaged over camera surface is 0.64 of the pixel size .",
    "thus , the position of intensity maximum is an explicit function of incident angle .",
    "this demonstrates the ability of our prototype cherenkov telescope to convert the angular distribution of light sources to the spatial distribution of signals on the imaging camera surface with adequate accuracy .",
    "the effective acceptance area of our prototype telescope is @xmath43 cm@xmath4 taking into account the device geometry , shadowing of the mirror , etc .",
    "this is comparable to the area of feu-49 pmt ( 176 cm@xmath4 ) in use in cherenkov detectors of the yakutsk array .",
    "thus , the real eas event rate previously detected with the cherenkov sub - array can be used as an estimator of the expected number of showers . in the arrangement of cherenkov light detectors shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : map ] , the number of showers detected per hour at @xmath44 ev is 62 , and 4 events were observed at @xmath45 ev @xcite .    if we place the set of cherenkov telescopes in a congruent hierarchical triangle structure as in fig .",
    "[ fig : map ] ( filled circles ) , then the expected number of eass detected per year ( assuming 500 hours / year is suitable for cherenkov light measurements ) is @xmath46 at @xmath44 ev , and @xmath47 at @xmath45 ev .",
    "we have demonstrated the possibility of investigating eas longitudinal development in the atmosphere through measuring the angular and temporal distributions of a cherenkov signal with a telescope embedded in a surface eas array environment .",
    "the enhancement of the yakutsk array by a set of cherenkov telescopes adapted to the energy range @xmath0 ev is aimed at significantly improving the array s ability to study the mass composition of crs .",
    "the main advantage of this combination consists in the integration of the multi - component measurement of eas and model - independent cr energy estimation by the surface array with excellent angular and temporal resolution of the cherenkov telescopes .",
