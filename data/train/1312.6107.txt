    "the hamiltonian @xmath23 ( [ hammy ] ) acts as the identity on @xmath30 , but it can be used to reduce @xmath31 into a direct sum of energy eigenspaces @xmath32 @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the spectrum of @xmath23 for a particular @xmath10 .    because @xmath17 is a symmetry of @xmath23 , the space @xmath31",
    "can also be reduced into a direct sum of irreps of @xmath17 labeled by the triplet @xmath35 , i.e.@xmath36 where @xmath37 labels the degeneracy of @xmath38-type irreps .",
    "the three labels @xmath39 of the irreps correspond to the three factors of @xmath17",
    ". first , the center - of - mass excitation quantum number @xmath40 labels the irreps for @xmath21 .",
    "second , the parity quantum number @xmath41 labels the irrep for parity inversion .",
    "the relative parity quantum number @xmath42 will be used instead of @xmath43 to remove the contribution due to the parity from the center - of - mass excitations since inversion of the just the center - of - mass coordinate is contained with the @xmath21 symmetry factor .",
    "the third factor of @xmath17 is the symmetric group @xmath19 . here",
    "i briefly summarize some notation for @xmath19 and its irreps as necessary for this article ; consult a standard reference like @xcite for details .",
    "the group @xmath19 has @xmath15 elements corresponding to the permutations of @xmath1 objects .",
    "the set of elements of @xmath19 decomposed into conjugacy classes for each partition @xmath44 of @xmath1 , e.g.  for four particles there are five partitions @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 . for each conjugacy class",
    "there is also an irrep of @xmath19 , and these are often depicted as standard young diagrams with @xmath1 boxes , e.g.  @xmath50 .",
    "the dimension of each irrep @xmath51 is the number of standard young tableaux for that diagram , i.e.  the diagram s boxes are labeled such that rows of boxes always have an equal or increasing number as one moves to the right , and vertical boxes have always have increasing numbers . for a given @xmath1 ,",
    "the irrep @xmath52 is one - dimensional and totally symmetric and the irrep @xmath53 is one - dimensional and totally antisymmetric .",
    "all other irreps are multidimensional .",
    "conjugate representations , in which rows and columns are exchanged , have the same dimension . within an irrep ,",
    "each element of @xmath19 is represented by a @xmath51-dimensional matrix .",
    "the traces of these matrices are called the characters of the representation , and all elements of @xmath19 from the same conjugacy class have the same character .",
    "assuming there are no other symmetries of the hamiltonian than @xmath17 for the parameter range @xmath54 , then the degeneracy of any eigenvalue @xmath55 is constrained to be the dimension of an irrep of @xmath17 and there is a unique correspondence between each energy degeneracy subspace @xmath32 and a specific irrep @xmath56 .",
    "this correspondence will not change as @xmath10 is adiabatically tuned within the range @xmath54 , even though energy of the subspace may vary .",
    "therefore the energy levels in the subspace @xmath57 do not cross or reorder as @xmath10 is varied from non - interacting to hard - core repulsion .",

    "if there are no spin degrees of freedom , or only one spin component is accessible , the spin hilbert space @xmath30 is one - dimensional and the decomposition of @xmath31 into @xmath17 irreps is the complete reduction of the problem . in that case , only the irreps @xmath52 for bosons and @xmath53 for fermions are physically realizable .",
    "if the particles have multiple accessible spin components , then there are several different ways to proceed .",
    "one way is to reduce the spin hilbert space @xmath30 with respect to @xmath19 and then takes its direct product with the spatial hilbert space @xmath31 .",
    "note that the total spin operator @xmath58 is invariant with respect to @xmath19 so subspaces with the same total spin and spin component will belong to an irrep of @xmath19 .",
    "techniques for the reduction of a spin system are well - known  @xcite ; an example with four spin-@xmath59 fermions is provided in table [ spintable ] .",
    "then the total hilbert space @xmath60 can be symmetrized to account for fermions or bosons by taking the direct product of the @xmath19 irreps for the spin with the @xmath19 factor of the @xmath17 irrep for the spatial part .",

    "<S> spectroscopic labels for a few particles with spin that are harmonically trapped in one - dimension with effectively zero - range interactions are provided by quantum numbers that characterize the symmetries of the hamiltonian : permutations of identical particles , parity inversion , and the separability of the center - of - mass . </S>",
    "<S> the exact solutions for the non - interacting and infinitely repulsive cases are reduced with respect to these symmetries . </S>",
    "<S> this reduction explains how states of single - component and multi - component fermions and bosons transform under adiabatic evolution from non - interacting to strong hard - core repulsion . </S>",
    "<S> these spectroscopic methods also clarify previous analytic and numerical results for intermediate values of interaction strength . </S>",
    "<S> several examples , including adiabatic mapping for two - component fermionic states in the cases @xmath0 , are provided .    </S>",
    "<S> the quantum system of a few particles in one dimension , confined by an external field and interacting via a short - range potential , has been a touchstone model for nuclear , atomic , statistical , and mathematical physics since the 1930 s . </S>",
    "<S> this system possesses enough symmetry and regularity to be analytically tractable in many cases , but also manifests a rich enough phenomenological structure to serve as physically significant model for realistic systems . </S>",
    "<S> this class of models has been a playground for studying the interplay of integrability and solvability , the emergence of universality in few - body phenomena , and the transition from few - body to many - body physics .    </S>",
    "<S> this article focuses specifically on the quantum system of @xmath1 particles of mass @xmath2 confined in a one - dimensional harmonic trap with frequency @xmath3 and interacting via an effectively zero - range potential . </S>",
    "<S> the hamiltonian for the model is @xmath4 with the particle coordinates @xmath5 expressed in units of @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> this hamiltonian has received intense attention recently because it serves as a model for neutral cold atoms with interactions tunable through the manipulation of feshbach and confinement - induced resonances trapped in extremely prolate , approximately harmonic optical wells  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the model has been used to investigate few - body and many - body properties of one - dimensional trapped ultracold gases of bosons  @xcite , fermions  @xcite , and mixtures of bosons and fermions  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the so - called unitary limit @xmath7 of hard - core repulsive interactions is known as the tonks - girardeau gas and has been realized in the laboratory with bosons  @xcite , as has the metastable super - tonks - girardeau limit @xmath8  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> recent experiments in which the state of a few trapped , interacting fermions can be controlled and measured  @xcite have generated excitement that tunable fermi gases will allow simulation of solid - state phenomena such as the transition to ferromagnetism  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the solutions of hamiltonian ( [ hammy ] ) form a complete basis for the spatial states of @xmath1 distinguishable particles , and these solutions can be symmetrized to account for identical bosons or fermions , whether single species or multi - component . </S>",
    "<S> an exact , complete set of solutions of ( [ hammy ] ) are known when @xmath9 for all @xmath10  @xcite , and these solutions have become the benchmark for further theoretical investigations . for @xmath11 , a complete set of exact solutions </S>",
    "<S> are known only for the interaction - free case @xmath12 and for the hard - core limit @xmath13   solutions are also energy eigenstates at @xmath14 , but they no longer form a complete basis due to the existence of bound states . ] . in the @xmath12 case , the system is equivalent to the well - known isotropic oscillator in @xmath1 dimensions . in the @xmath13 limit , @xmath15 independent solutions can be constructed from each @xmath12 fermionic solution  @xcite by generalizing the famous bose - fermi mapping  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this mapping has also been generalized to construct exact solutions at @xmath16 for multi - component fermions  @xcite , multi - component bosons  @xcite and boson - fermion mixtures  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> both sets of exact spatial solutions can be described using a unified spectroscopic framework . </S>",
    "<S> the spectroscopic labels correspond to the irreducible representations ( irreps ) of the total symmetry group @xmath17 of the hamiltonian . </S>",
    "<S> the group @xmath17 is isomorphic to the direct product @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is permutation symmetry , @xmath20 corresponds to parity and @xmath21 to contact symmetry of the one - dimensional harmonic oscillator in the separated center - of - mass variable . </S>",
    "<S> the symmetry group @xmath17 holds for any interaction strength @xmath22 , so @xmath17 irrep labels serve as quantum numbers that are respected by the interparticle interaction for all values of @xmath10 , not just for the exact limits .    </S>",
    "<S> in this article , i argue that these spectroscopic labels can be used to help implement symmetrization , understand the transformation of states under rapid or adiabatic changes in the interaction parameter , and improve approximation schemes for states in the intermediate interaction regime . </S>",
    "<S> many previous works have exploited the symmetry and representation theory of @xmath19 to construct symmetrized states , e.g.  @xcite , but this treatment differs in three substantial ways . </S>",
    "<S> first , the symmetrization and reduction into @xmath17 irreps in the @xmath12 and @xmath7 limits is facilitated by using the jacobi hypercylindrical coordinate system , defined below . </S>",
    "<S> this coordinate system naturally incorporates the contact and dilation symmetries ( c.f . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) of @xmath23 . </S>",
    "<S> second , a method is used to construct spatial states with the right properties for symmetrizing multi - component spin systems that does not require explicitly constructing the spin state . </S>",
    "<S> third , and perhaps most importantly , the group @xmath17 exhausts the symmetry of @xmath23 ( except for @xmath24 or @xmath25 ) , whereas @xmath19 does not . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , for intermediate values of @xmath10 , each possible set of spectroscopic labels uniquely identifies a distinct degenerate energy subspace , and each subspace has the dimension of the corresponding @xmath17 irrep .    when @xmath12 and @xmath13 the symmetry group of ( [ hammy ] ) is larger than @xmath17 but contains it as a subgroup . </S>",
    "<S> that means the degenerate energy eigenspaces are reducible into irreps of @xmath17 , and they are usually not simply reducible . </S>",
    "<S> the reduction problem for these two exact limits is solved in this article . </S>",
    "<S> comparing the pattern of irreps of @xmath17 at @xmath12 and @xmath13 provides the generalization of the boson - fermion mapping to multicomponent cases or mixed symmetry . under adiabatic evolution of the interaction strength </S>",
    "<S> , states follow this mapping . </S>",
    "<S> the results of this method agree with recent calculations by other methods  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , once this map is known , one can construct approximate solutions for intermediate interaction strengths from the extreme exact cases using variational methods ( c.f .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) . in a subsequent work </S>",
    "<S> i will show how this same spectroscopic framework also allows the dynamics arising from rapid variations of the interaction parameter , or quenches , to be described accurately and efficiently .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , the spectroscopic notation developed here clarifies results achieved by a variety of analytic and numerical approximation methods for intermediate values of @xmath10  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these methods typically produce spectral graphs that are dense with crossing lines , but these lines can be assigned unique labels with this system . when the graphs are partitioned into @xmath17 irreps , </S>",
    "<S> there are no level crossings . </S>",
    "<S> exact diagonalization methods that exploit this spectroscopic system will require fewer basis states to get the same accuracy because there are no interaction matrix elements between states in different @xmath17 irreps . </S>"
