    "more than 25 years after their discovery,@xcite many aspects of the physics of the high-@xmath0 cuprate superconductors remain unclear.@xcite for a long period , researchers attempted to discuss the physics in terms of single - band models , including the @xmath7-@xmath8 model and the one - band hubbard model.@xcite while much of the low - energy physics can be explained by single - band models with appropriately chosen parameters,@xcite many properties of the cuprates and other transition metal oxides require consideration of more realistic models.@xcite the importance of the oxygen bands was stressed early on by emery and reiter,@xcite and their ideas were encoded in the `` three - band '' model @xcite which retains the cu @xmath9 and o @xmath10 orbitals on the cuo@xmath11 plane .",
    "early qualitative studies of this model@xcite have been followed by recent quantitative studies@xcite using the dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft)@xcite and sometimes in conjunction with density functional theory calculations.@xcite a very recent paper has argued that even the low energy physics may reveal signatures of non - hubbard or non-@xmath7-@xmath8 physics.@xcite although the three - band model helps us in understanding various features of cuprates , it has its limitations .",
    "for example , the three - band model has been shown to provide an inadequate description of the optical absorption at frequencies @xmath12",
    "ev.@xcite    a natural question is whether other cu orbitals , in particular the cu @xmath13 , play an important role .",
    "higher energy spectroscopies@xcite have detected these states , which may lead in particular to excitonic states in the spectrum.@xcite an early theoretical study,@xcite based on the slave boson approximation , argued that the @xmath2 orbitals are not just admixed into the conduction band , but can give rise to another sheet of the fermi surface at reasonable doping levels .",
    "variations between material families in the energy and mixing of the @xmath2 orbital were recently argued to affect the value of the second neighbor hopping , thereby explaining the material dependence of @xmath0.@xcite the comparison of theoretical and experimental optical absorption was argued to be at least partially resolved by consideration of the cu @xmath2 and apical oxygen orbitals.@xcite    these and many other observations motivate this paper , in which we study a six - band model which includes , in addition to the three bands included before , the cu @xmath13 orbital and ( depending on crystal structure ) apical oxygen @xmath14 orbitals above and below the cuo@xmath11 plane .",

    "the resulting model involves six bands , and we restrict attention here to paramagnetic phases , so it is not necessary to write the spin dependence of the band structure explicitly .",
    "the band theory part of the hamiltonian is thus a @xmath20 matrix in @xmath21-space .",
    "we neglect the periodicity in the @xmath22-direction , thus the hamiltonian only has @xmath23 and @xmath24 dependences .",
    "the hopping integrals between cu and o are also labelled on fig .",

    "therefore we derive the six - band model by applying the lwdin downfolding procedure@xcite to a model involving the six bands considered here plus a cu @xmath29 band ( see appendix for details ) .",

    "[ sec : opcond ] ) we leave it as it is here , explicitly keeping the two apical oxygen orbitals separately .",
    "we choose @xmath37ev.@xcite if there is cubic symmetry , @xmath38 and @xmath39 but in the @xmath3 phase the cu - o bond length is longer along the @xmath22-axis than @xmath40-axes , resulting in a smaller value of @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "we follow ref .   and use @xmath41ev , @xmath42ev , @xmath43ev and @xmath44ev .",
    "these values are consistent with other estimates found in the literature.@xcite the value of @xmath45 has not been considered in ref .",
    "but since the downfolding procedure implies that @xmath46 ( see appendix ) , we set @xmath47ev .",
    "we note that the effect of oxygen - oxygen hopping has been studied in detail in ref .   and",
    "it has been shown that the precise values and form of oxygen - oxygen hopping does not change the physics in any important way . to model the @xmath4-phase , in which the apical oxygen states are absent , we set @xmath48 .",
    "we next turn to the interaction part of the hamiltonian . when more than one cu orbital is important , interactions beyond the hubbard @xmath49 must be considered .",
    "we adopt the standard slater - kanamori form@xcite for the interacting part of the hamiltonian @xmath50 : @xmath51 here we have used @xmath52 ( @xmath30 ) as the creation ( annihilation ) operator for the planar @xmath1 orbital , and @xmath53 ( @xmath31 ) as the creation ( annihilation ) operator for the @xmath2 orbital .",
    "all the interactions are on - site so we have not written the site indices explicitly .",
    "we follow the conventional choice of @xmath54 which comes from symmetry arguments of @xmath5-orbitals .",
    "note that in keeping with the common practice in modelling cuprates we do not consider interactions on the oxygen sites . at the parameter values we consider the density of holes on the oxygen sites small enough that these interactions are not expected to be important .",
    "except in the construction of the phase diagram we will choose the value @xmath55 ev @xcite believed to be representative of cuprates , and set the bare @xmath56 and @xmath5 energies equal : @xmath57 and @xmath58 ( where there are @xmath19 orbitals ) .",
    "we define the bare charge - transfer energy @xmath59    as will be seen , a large difference in @xmath5-occupancy and other aspects of the physics arises from difference in in - plane and @xmath16-axis hopping implied by the crystal structure .",
    "we study @xmath60 and @xmath61ev .",
    "we solve the model using the single - site dynamical mean field approximation@xcite with the continuous - time quantum monte carlo impurity solver in its hybridization - expansion ( ct - hyb ) form.@xcite to obtain real - frequency information we perform analytic continuation of the imaginary - axis self - energies using the method of ref .  .",
    "the specifics are described in refs .  .",
    "the key approximation is assuming that the lattice self - energy is momentum - independent , @xmath62 .",
    "the self energy is a matrix in the space of orbitals . because the interaction is local , which involves only the @xmath5 electrons , all entries of @xmath63 except",
    "the @xmath5-@xmath5 components vanish .",
    "in this section we present the metal - insulator phase diagram and electron spectral functions for the six - band model for varying choices of hund interaction @xmath8 and compare the results to the phase diagram and spectra previously published for the three - band model.@xcite to facilitate the comparison we remove the hartree energy by shifting the @xmath64-axis of the six - band model by @xmath65 relative to the three - band model .",
    "the magnitude of the hartree shift can be understood as follows . in the three - band model",
    "the undoped compound is the @xmath66 state with the energy @xmath67 ; adding one electron leads to the @xmath68 state with the energy @xmath69 ; the two - hole state nearest in energy is @xmath70 with energy @xmath71 .",
    "therefore the physical charge - transfer energy is ( note that we use electron notation ; in some of the literature the charge - transfer energy is defined in hole notation , without the @xmath49 and with @xmath72 and @xmath73 reversed ) @xmath74 however , in the six - band model there is an additional hartree shift arising from the @xmath13 orbital . in this case",
    "the @xmath66 state has energy @xmath75 ( see , e.g. table ii of ref .  ) ; the @xmath68 state has energy @xmath76 and the two - hole state nearest in energy is the @xmath70 state whose energy is @xmath77 .",
    "the physical charge - transfer energy is thus @xmath78 shifted by @xmath79 relative to the three - band model .",
    "the spectra presented below show that six - band models with the same value of @xmath80 have the same energy splitting between the non - bonding oxygen band and the upper hubbard band , and that this splitting is also the same as would be found in a three - band model with charge - transfer energy @xmath81 .",
    "the solid , dashed and dash - dotted lines in fig .",
    "[ phase ] show the phase boundaries calculated from the @xmath3-phase six - band model for three different values of @xmath8 .",
    "the metal - insulator phase transition is first order @xcite with a coexistence region .",
    "@xmath82 , the limit of stability of the metallic phase , is indicated by the left - hand lines in fig",
    ".  [ phase ] .",
    "the limit of stability of the insulating phase is denoted by @xmath83 and is indicated by the right - hand lines .",
    "once the hartree shift is removed , the hunds coupling @xmath8 is seen to have a minor effect on the location of the phase boundary and the width of the crossover regions , although the crossover region is slightly narrower for larger @xmath8 .",
    "the shaded area ( green on - line ) shows previously published@xcite results for the coexistence region of the three - band model : the left boundary is @xmath82 and the right boundary is @xmath83 . even after the hartree shift is removed , the phase boundaries are displaced significantly , and the coexistence regime is wider .",
    "some of the difference in width arises because the three - band model could be studied to lower temperature ( @xmath84 ev ) than the six - band model , but the difference is larger than the thermal effect .",
    "while a small portion of the difference in location of the phase boundary arises from the difference in hartree shift arising from small differences in the occupancy of the @xmath1 orbitals , the majority of the change is due to non - hartree many - body effects .",
    "in essence , in the six - band model the insulating phase remains stable down to weaker values of the effective correlation strength than in the three - band model .",
    "we do not have a definitive explanation of this finding at this stage ; further clarification of this issue is important .",

    "the results are obtained by maximum - entropy analytic continuation of the self energies , following ref .  .",
    "we note that analytic continuation produces very wide tail down from @xmath85 ev which we do not present since it is subject to large uncertainties while being unimportant for our discussion .",
    "the spectra of the @xmath1 and the @xmath26 orbitals are similar to that of the three - band model with comparable parameters.@xcite the new features are the @xmath2 and ( for the @xmath3 structure ) the apical oxygen @xmath19 orbital .",
    "the spectrum of the @xmath19 orbital includes a @xmath86-function centered at @xmath87 because , as noted above , one linear combination of the @xmath19 orbital decouples .",
    "the two side - bands in the @xmath19 spectrum are the bonding and antibonding portions of the orbital which couple .",
    "inclusion of oxygen - oxygen hopping between different unit cells in the @xmath22-direction would broaden the @xmath86-function , however this effect is not important for our considerations .",
    "the hybridization to the @xmath19 orbitals is evident in the spectrum of the @xmath2 orbital : it has mainly a two - peak feature which both at around the same place as the side - bands of the @xmath19 orbitals , although their strengths are quite different .",
    "the onset of the @xmath2 spectrum is at a lower energy ( around 1 ev ) than that of the @xmath1 which is due to the fact that the lattice is distorted in the @xmath16-direction away from the octahedron .",
    "the lower part of panel ( a ) shows the result calculated at @xmath88 . the ground state is marginally metallic and one can see a narrow quasiparticle peak appears at the fermi energy .    panel ( b ) of fig .  [ aomega ] shows the result in the @xmath4-phase , where the apical oxygen orbitals are absent .",
    "we see similarities in the lineshape of the @xmath1 and @xmath26 orbitals .",
    "however the @xmath2 spectrum is quite different : it now has a single peak centered at an energy slightly above @xmath73 , with its onset similar to panel ( a ) .",
    "this is a main change induced by absence of apical oxygen sites .",
    "the quasiparticle peak in the lower part of panel ( b ) is more broad than that of panel ( a ) indicating that in this case the system is less strongly correlated .",
    "further support for this notion comes from the values of the imaginary part of matsubara - axis self energy ; here larger magnitudes correspond to larger values of the effective correlation strength .",
    "we find , for example , that at a doping of aound @xmath89 @xmath90 at the lowest matsubara frequency is @xmath91ev for the @xmath3 phase and @xmath92ev for the @xmath4 phase .    in constructing the figures we selected values of @xmath93 such that @xmath94 was the same for the @xmath3 and @xmath4 phase calculations .",
    "we can define the charge - transfer energy empirically as the energy difference between the non - bonding oxygen peak and the lowest peak in the upper hubbard band and the splittings in panels ( a ) and ( b ) are seen to be very similar .",
    "comparison of the upper panels of figures ( a ) and ( b ) shows that the gap in the @xmath4 phase calcuation is smaller than the gap in the @xmath3 phase calculation , indicating that for comparable paramters the @xmath4 phase is less strongly correlated than the @xmath3 phase .",

    "however since we are primarily concerned with the one - hole state , even at non - zero @xmath8 ( up to 1 ev ) the difference between the singlet and triplet is negligible .",
    "moreover , we have found ( not shown ) that @xmath8 induces very small effect on the exciton correlation function .",

    "it is interesting to view this correlation function in diagrammatic terms as a combination of bubble diagram ( convolution of interacting green s function ) and vertex correction .",

    "we have mapped out the metal / charge - transfer - insulator phase diagram , finding that after the atomic - limit hartree shift is accounted for , the phase boundaries are systematically shifted to the metallic regime compared to that of the three - band model .",
    "thus we conclude that incorporating the @xmath2 orbital expands the insulating regime of the system .",
    "the spectral functions are calculated by analytic continuation .",
    "the @xmath1 and @xmath26 spectra are observed to be similar to that of the three - band model . in the @xmath3-phase",
    "the non - bonding @xmath19 band appears as a @xmath86-function and two side - bands corresponds to the bonding apical oxygen bands .",
    "hybridization to these orbitals means that the @xmath2 has a double - peak structure .",
    "in contrast , in the @xmath4-phase , the spectrum of @xmath2 orbital has a single peak . in the insulating regime",
    ", we have found that the insulating gap is generically smaller in the six - band model than in the three - band model , for comparable correlation parameters .",
    "we have calculated the @xmath5-@xmath5 exciton spectrum , finding a sharp exciton line which should be visible in experiments . in the insulating phase ,",
    "the exciton states are inside the charge - transfer gap . in the metallic phase ,",
    "the exciton states are at slightly higher binding energy , but although they overlap in energy with the tails of the hubbard bands , the broadening is small .",
    "both in - plane and @xmath16-axis optical conductivy are calculated .",
    "we have found , in disagreement with previous publication,@xcite that inclusion of the additional @xmath2 and apical oxygen bands does not fix the problem of the near - gap magnitude .",
    "the @xmath16-axis conductivity is much weaker and the absorption is very small in the frequency range 2 ev to 4 ev . above 4 ev there is a relatively noticeable absorption due to transition from the decoupled apical oxygen bands to the upper hubbard band .    we have studied the distribution of doped holes onto different orbitals .",
    "we have shown that under no physically relevant doping values that the @xmath2 orbitals ( and @xmath19 orbitals in the @xmath3-phase ) are populated as a separate band .",
    "the fermi surface only contains one sheet .",
    "this is in disagreement with previous slave boson studies.@xcite",
    "we thank m. capone for helpful discussions , and n. lin for cross - checking our results with exact diagonalization solvers .",
    "xw is supported by the condensed matter theory center of university of maryland , and htd and ajm by nsf - dmr-1006282 .",
    "part of this research was conducted at the center for nanophase materials sciences , which is sponsored at oak ridge national laboratory by the division of scientific user facilities , u.s .",
    "department of energy .",
    "the impurity solver is based on a code primarily developed by p. werner@xcite and uses the alps library.@xcite",
    "in this appendix we present the `` six - band+s '' model involving an additional cu @xmath29 orbital in each unit cell .",
    "we take the basis as @xmath155 .",
    "then the hamiltonian is a @xmath156 matrix , which may be seperated to cu and o parts as @xmath157 where @xmath158 @xmath159 and the hybridization between cu and o orbitals : @xmath160    the downfolding@xcite of eq",
