    "with the advent @xcite and success of level set methods and its many applications @xcite to areas ranging from computational physics to computer vision there has been considerable interest in numerical methods for solving hamilton ",
    "jacobi equations , dynamic and static . for problems with complex geometries , or for problems on manifolds ,",
    "there is a demand for methods that work on unstructured meshes such as triangulations .",
    "three main directions of constructing discretizations on unstructured meshes can be found in the literature .",
    "first , there are methods that lift ideas of finite - difference upwinding and godunov schemes from hyperbolic conservation laws to hamilton  jacobi equations ( whose solutions are , at least in 1d , _ integrals _ of solutions to conservation laws ) , see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "second , there are finite - element methods that are based on a weak formulation of the semi - linear second order equation obtained by adding a small amount of factual viscosity , see , e.g. , @xcite . and third , there are methods that utilize the connection of hamilton  jacobi equations ( via bellman s principle ) to optimal control problems , see , e.g. , @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we propose a discretization that bears similarities with the last approach .",
    "we implicitly construct a linear finite - element solution by requiring that it solves _ locally _ a _ simplified _ equation with ( local ) boundary conditions given by the finite - element function itself .",
    "the simplified local equation is then solved by a _ local variational principle _ , the _ hopf  lax formula_.    this simple discretization is interesting in various respects .",
    "first , we will show that it generalizes quite a few approaches known in the literature .",
    "second , it allows for an extremely simple , self - contained convergence theory .",
    "in fact , the only results of the general theory that we rely on are a uniqueness theorem for viscosity solutions and the theorem of arzel  ascoli .",
    "existence of viscosity solutions will be shown _ in passing _ by the convergence of the finite - element discretization .    by construction",
    "the discretization inherits structural properties of the viscosity solution of the hamilton ",
    "jacobi equation such as a comparison principle . for each property",
    "we will carefully trace the specific assumptions on the hamiltonian and the boundary data that are needed for proofs in the continuous and the discrete case .",
    "in particular , it is known @xcite that the existence of a viscosity solution of the dirichlet problem necessitates a _ compatibility condition _ on the boundary data , which is basically a restrictive lipschitz bound .",
    "however , this necessary condition gets barely any mention in the literature on numerical methods , even in the formulation of convergence results , e.g. , ( * ? ? ?",
    "moreover , we propose in this paper a likewise simple iterative method for solving the resulting nonlinear system of equations , namely the _ adaptive gauss ",
    "seidel iteration _ , which is easily implemented and , at least experimentally , quite effective .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in ",
    "[ sect : visc ] we recall the concept , existence , and uniqueness of viscosity solutions of dirichlet problems for certain hamilton  jacobi equations . in ",
    "[ sect : rho ] we introduce the support function of the zero - level set of the hamiltonian which plays a major role in the definition of the discretization . in  [ sect : fem ] we define the linear finite - element solution based on a local variational principle .",
    "the existence , uniqueness , and uniform lipschitz continuity of the finite - element solutions are subject of  [ sect : disc ] .",
    "a suitable concept of _ consistency _ is introduced in  [ sect : conv ] and the convergence of the discrete solutions is proved . in  [ sect : eikonal ] we apply the finite - element discretization to a class of generalized eikonal equations in 2d and obtain , by a simple geometric argument , a closed formula for the local discrete equation . in ",
    "[ sect : gs ] we discuss the adaptive gauss ",
    "seidel iteration that we propose for an easily implemented and quite effective solution of the nonlinear system of equations .",
    "finally , in  [ sect : exp ] we study two numerical experiments and compare the proposed method to the ordered upwind method ( oum ) recently published by sethian and vladimirsky @xcite .",

    "<S> we propose a linear finite - element discretization of dirichlet problems for static hamilton - jacobi equations on unstructured triangulations . the discretization is based on simplified localized dirichlet problems that are solved by a local variational principle . </S>",
    "<S> it generalizes several approaches known in the literature and allows for a simple and transparent convergence theory . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> the resulting system of nonlinear equations is solved by an _ adaptive _ gauss  </S>",
