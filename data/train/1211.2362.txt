    "while in the coarse - graining method , excepting the obligatory ensemble average , one still has to carry out at least one of three average procedures : ( 1 ) coarse - graining in time@xcite ; ( 2 ) coarse - graining in space@xcite ; or ( 3 ) coarse - graining in the eigenvalue spectrum of energy and other collective variables@xcite .    in the coarse - graining techniques , the spatial coarse grained average plays an essential role in formulating all macroscopic problems .",
