    "in this section , we describe a procedure to calculate a spectrum of degraded @xmath0-ray line emission from @xmath1na .",
    "we numerically deal with the radiative transfer problem , because we need to treat photons with the energies higher than the electron rest energy and include effects of photoelectric absorption .",
    "we use a monte - carlo radiative transfer code having been developed by the present authors@xcite .",
    "we explain only modifications to the original code in subsections 2.2 and 2.3 .",
    "we assume that the envelope of the white dwarf is ejected at a constant mass - loss rate with a uniform velocity @xmath12 for a time interval @xmath13 .",
    "the resultant electron number density @xmath14 at @xmath15 is inversely proportional to the square of the radius @xmath16 , @xmath17 .",

    "the mass of @xmath1na produced in onemg novae is calculated by @xcite for wide ranges of the mass of the white dwarf and the envelope . to produce a sufficient amount of @xmath1na",
    ", the mass of the envelope is required to be @xmath23 .",

    "the other parameter characterizing the density structure of the ejecta is the duration @xmath13 , which determines the inner radius @xmath25 of the ejecta , @xmath26 . in the radiative transfer calculation ,",
    "the inner radius @xmath25 at @xmath27 is a free parameter to be selected to reproduce the observed x - ray spectrum . using these values , we calculate the optical depth for each photon at @xmath28 .",
    "the spectrum of the x - ray emission from v2491 cygni exhibits thermal emission from optically thin plasma with the temperature of @xmath29 kev @xcite .",
    "it seems that only the shocked gas located near the boundary between the ejecta and the interstellar medium emits the thermal emission .",
    "therefore , the temperature in the rest of the ejecta is much smaller than @xmath29 kev . if the gas in the entire ejecta emitted x - ray photons , the x - ray flux would be much larger than the observed flux .",
    "next , the spectrum of seed photons must be specified . following previous works @xcite",

    "a positron and a @xmath0-ray photon with the energy of 1.27 mev are produced by this process .",
    "the emission from the positron should be treated carefully , because it can be thermalized and form positronium in the ejecta . at temperatures below @xmath32",
    "k , the positron prefers the formation of a positronium rather than the direct annihilation to two @xmath0-ray photons @xcite .",
    "thus , the previous works @xcite assumed that 90 @xmath33 of positrons produced by @xmath30-decay form positroniums . in these studies , the positrons were assumed to form positronium after they penetrate a medium with the column mass density of @xmath34 g/@xmath35 , which is needed for the positrons to thermalize to the energies of @xmath36 ev via coulomb scattering by ions . because the cross section of coulomb scattering of a positron with the energy of @xmath37 ev to be @xmath38 @xmath35 , the number of scattering for the thermalization is on the order of @xmath39 , which is much larger than the expected number of scattering of a @xmath0-ray photon ( the optical depth of the ejecta on day 9 is @xmath40 ) .",
    "thus , it takes @xmath41 times longer time for a positron to form positronium than for a photon to escape from the ejecta .",
    "this means that the flux of the @xmath0-ray emission is dominated by the direct annihilation .",
    "therefore , we can assume that the other 10% of positrons produced by @xmath30-decay are directly annihilated and each of them emits two 511 kev photons .",
    "the photon fluxes @xmath42 of 1.27 mev photons and @xmath43 of 511 kev photons from the decay of @xmath1na are expressed as , @xmath44 \\left(\\frac{d}{10.5\\ \\mathrm{kpc}}\\right)^{-2}\\\\ & & \\times\\exp[-t/\\tau(^{22}\\mathrm{na } ) ] \\ \\",

    "they are photons without being scattered in the ejecta . except for the two spikes , the spectrum is continuous , which is a result of comptonization of the @xmath0-ray photons .",
    "especially , there is an extremely flat part ( @xmath84 kev@xmath85 kev ) in the spectrum of photons accumulated for period i. the spectral analysis of the x - ray emission of v2491 cygni shows that the spectrum in the energy range of @xmath84 kev @xmath86 kev is well fitted by a power law with the photon index of @xmath87 @xcite .",
    "this feature is well reproduced by our model .",
    "the analytical investigation of comptonization of photons escaping from a spherical plasma cloud by @xcite found similar flat spectra .",
    "the flat spectrum in figure [ f1 ] seems to be formed in the same manner .",

    "the spectrum of period ii shows a significant decrease of the flux in the energy range of @xmath84 kev @xmath86 kev . this is a result of the expansion of the ejecta .",

    "this fast change of the x - ray emission is in contrast to a similar model by @xcite in which the timescale of the x - ray light curve is of the order of 100 days or more .",
    "this difference comes from the assumed expansion velocities of the ejecta in the two models .",
    "@xcite assumed @xmath88 km s@xmath7 or 6 km s@xmath7 while we assume a much higher velocity @xmath89 km s@xmath7 as suggested from optical observations for this particular nova .",

    "figure [ f2 ] shows the resultant spectra of the model with @xmath90 cm . as well as the model with @xmath58 cm",
    ", the flat spectrum is obtained in period i. however , the spectrum for period ii remains flat .",
    "we can attribute this feature to effects of the small @xmath25 .",
    "for the model with a small @xmath25 , the fraction of photons travelling in the deep interior of the ejecta is large compared to that with a large @xmath25 . since low - energy photons are produced by repeated compton scattering in the deep interior , the fraction of low - energy photons remains large even on several tens days after the outburst . although the value of the flux in the flat part of the spectrum for period ii is smaller than that of period i , it may contradict the non - detection of the hard x - ray emission on day 29 .",
    "on the other hand , figure [ f4 ] shows the resultant spectra of the model with @xmath91 cm . in this case , the spectrum of period i fails to reproduce the flat spectrum .",
    "this is because the density of the ejecta becomes already too low to remain opaque to the @xmath0-ray line in the first 10 days . as a consequence ,",
    "the model with @xmath58 cm is preferred to explain the observational features of the x - ray emission from v2491 cygni .",
    "therefore , the mass ejection from the stellar surface is terminated by day 10 .",
    "figure [ f3 ] shows the resultant spectra for various values of the ratio @xmath73 of the number of ions to that of electrons in the ejecta .",
    "the seed photons are injected from @xmath81 day to @xmath53 day .",
    "each line represents the model with @xmath59 ( solid line ) , @xmath92 ( dashed line ) , and @xmath93 ( dotted line ) . for the solar abundance , the number ratio of fe to h is @xmath94",
    ".    one can recognize the tendency that the photon flux at several tens kev decreases with the increasing ratio @xmath73 .",
    "even for 1/10 of the solar value ( @xmath92 ) , the flat part of the spectrum to be seen in the model with @xmath59 disappears .",

    "we discuss the detectability of the @xmath0-ray line emission from v2491 cygni .",

    "thus , the present value of the photon fluxes are estimated as @xmath98 photons @xmath51 s@xmath7 and @xmath99 photons @xmath51  s@xmath7 . to detect these @xmath0-ray lines with sufficient s / n ratios ( @xmath100 ) ,",
    "about 100 ksec observations are required both for the _ integral _ spectrometer spi and the _ fermi _ gamma - ray burst monitor .",
    "in this letter , we consider the possibility that compton degradation of the @xmath0-ray line emission from the radioactive isotope @xmath1na can explain the observed hard x - ray emission from the classical nova v2491 cygni .",
    "we adopt a simple wind model as the ejecta model and calculate radiative transfer of the @xmath0-ray line emission in the ejecta . as a result",
    ", we succeed in reproducing the spectrum of the hard x - ray emission on the 9th day after the discovery . at the same time",
    ", our model can explain the absence of the hard x - ray emission on day 29 .",
    "this is because the optical depth of the ejecta decreases to 0.065 in these 20 days .",
    "the amount of @xmath1na synthesized in the ejecta is required to be @xmath2 to account for the flux of the hard x - ray emission .",
    "we also estimate the present value of the photon fluxes of the 1.27 mev and 511 kev line emissions and find that these line emissions can be detected by the gbm on _ fermi _ and the spi on integral with a reasonable observing time .",
    "finally , we mention an inadequacy of our model . previous observations and theoretical investigations of the outbursts on massive white dwarfs imply the ejecta mass of @xmath101 , which is much smaller than that of our model . in this case",
    ", the radioactive decay of @xmath1na must not be the origin of the hard x - ray emission from v2491 cygni , because the amount of @xmath1na is much smaller than that required to reproduce the emission .",
    "however , the x - ray detection from the pre- and post - outburst images of v2491 cygni may imply that it was an unusual nova .",
    "therefore , observations of the @xmath0-ray line emission by the _ integral _ and/or the _ fermi _ must provide us crucial information on the hard x - ray emission .    this work has been partly supported by grant - in - aid for jsps fellows ( 21@xmath1021726 ) and grants in aid for scientific research ( 21018004 ) of the ministry of education , science , culture , and sports in japan .",
