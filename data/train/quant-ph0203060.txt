    "the understanding and characterization of quantum entanglement is one of the most fundamental issues of modern quantum theory @xcite , and a lot of work has been devoted to this topic in the recent years @xcite .    in the beginning of modern quantum theory , the notion of entanglement was first noted by einstein , podolsky , and rosen @xcite , and by schrdinger @xcite . while in those days quantum entanglement and its predicted physical consequences were ( at least partially ) considered as an unphysical property of the formalism ( a `` paradox '' ) , the modern perspective on this issue is very different . nowadays quantum entanglement is seen as an experimentally verified property of nature , that provides a resource for a vast variety of novel phenomena and concepts such as quantum computation , quantum cryptography , or quantum teleportation .",
    "accordingly there are several motivations to study the entanglement of quantum states :    1 .",
    "interpretational and philosophical motivation : entanglement plays an essential role in apparent `` paradoxes '' and counter - intuitive consequences of quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "fundamental physical motivation : the characterization of entanglement is one of the most fundamental open problems of quantum mechanics .",
    "it should answer the question what is the nature of quantum correlations in composite systems @xcite .",
    "3 .   applied physical motivation : entanglement plays an essential role in applications of quantum mechanics to quantum information processing , and in particular to quantum computing @xcite , quantum cryptography @xcite and quantum communication @xcite(i.e .",
    "teleportation @xcite and super dense coding @xcite ) .",
    "the resources needed to implement a particular protocol of quantum information processing are closely linked to the entanglement properties of the states used in the protocol . in particular , entanglement lies at the heart of quantum computing @xcite .",
    "fundamental mathematical motivation : the entanglement problem is directly related to one of the most challenging open problems of linear algebra and functional analysis : characterization and classification of positive maps on @xmath0 algebras @xcite ( for mathematical literature see @xcite ) .    while entanglement plays an essential role in quantum communication between parties separated by macroscopic distances , the characterization of quantum correlations at short distances is also an open problem , which has received much less attention so far . in this case",
    "the indistinguishable character of the particles involved ( electrons , photons , ... ) has to be taken into account . in his classic book ,",
    "peres @xcite discussed the entanglement in elementary states of indistinguishable particles .",
    "these are symmetrizations and antisymmetrizations of product states for bosons and fermions , respectively .",
    "it is easy to see that all such states of two - fermion systems , and as well all such states formed by two non - collinear single - particle states in two - boson systems , are necessarily entangled in the usual sense .",
    "however , in the case of particles far apart from each other , this type of entanglement is not of physical relevance : _",
    "`` no quantum prediction , referring to an atom located in our laboratory , is affected by the mere presence of similar atoms in remote parts of the universe''_@xcite .",
    "this kind of entanglement between indistinguishable particles being far apart from each other is not the subject of this paper .",
    "our aim here is rather to classify and characterize the quantum correlations between indistinguishable particles at short distances .",
    "we discuss below why this problem is relevant for quantum information processing in various physical systems .",
    "perhaps the first attempt to study such quantum correlations in macroscopic systems was done by a.j .",
    "legett @xcite .",
    "more recently he has formulated the concept of _ disconnectivity _ @xcite of quantum states which is somewhat related to the concepts developed in this review .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section [ corrent ] we illustrate the consequences of indistinguishability . in section [ analogs ]",
    "we describe analogies between quantum correlations in systems of two indistinguishable fermions , bosons , and two distinguishable parties where we concentrate on the lowest - dimensional hilbert spaces that allow for non - trivial correlation effects .",
    "we derive the fermion and bosons analogues of recent results by wootters @xcite , by kraus and cirac @xcite and by khaneja and glaser @xcite .",
    "our results shed new light on a question posed recently by vollbrecht and werner : _ why two qubits are special _ @xcite ( see also @xcite ) . in section [ kai ] we report further results on quantum correlations in pure states of indistinguishable fermions in higher - dimensional cases .",
    "results on mixed fermionic states are summarized in section [ sumferm ] , and in section [ bosons ] we report further results on identical bosons .",
    "we conclude in section [ concl ] .",
    "semiconductor quantum dots @xcite  are a promising approach to the physical realization of quantum computers . in these devices charge carriers ( e.g.  electrons ) are confined in all three spatial dimensions .",
    "their electronic spectrum consists of discrete energy levels since the confinement is of the order of the fermi wavelength .",
    "it is experimentally possible to control the number of electrons in a such a dot starting from zero ( e.g. in a gaas heterostructure @xcite ) .",
    "when one wants to use quantum dots for quantum computation it is necessary to define how the qubit ( i.e. the basic unit of information ) should be physically realized .",
    "e.g.  the orbital electronic degrees of freedom or the electron spin @xmath1 can be chosen to form the qubit .",
    "an advantage of the latter approach is that the decoherence time is much longer for the spin than for the orbital degree of freedom ( usually three orders of magnitude @xcite ) .",
    "the implementation of quantum algorithms needs single qubit and two qubit quantum gates @xcite . for the spin degree of freedom the former",
    "can be achieved by the application of a magnetic field exclusively to a single spin @xcite .",
    "it is well - known @xcite that arbitrary computations can be done if , apart from single qubit rotations , a mechanism by which two qubits can be entangled is available ( the entangling gate @xmath2 [ def : sqrtswap ] , together with single qubit rotations , can be used to produce the fundamental controlled - not gate ) .",
    "it was proposed in @xcite to realize this mechanism by temporarily coupling two spins in two dots .",
    "the coupling , described by a heisenberg hamiltonian @xmath3 , can be turned on and off by lowering and raising the tunnel barrier between neighboring quantum dots .",
    "another interesting type of physical implementation possibilities are neutral atoms in magnetic @xcite or optical @xcite microtraps . here",
    "each single neutral atoms is trapped in a harmonic potential and their collisional interaction can be controlled by temporarily decreasing the distance of the traps or by state - selective switching of the trapping potential .",
    "we will use a schematic view of two electrons located in a double - well potential to illustrate the consequences of indistinguishability for entanglement .",
    "this description applies to the discussed examples of quantum information processing in quantum dots and in optical or magnetical microtraps ( replacing electrons by atoms ) . for this illustration",
    "we will assume that the qubit is modeled by the spin degree of freedom , which we will denote by @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "furthermore we have two spatial wavefunctions labeled @xmath6 and @xmath7 , initially localized in the left and in the right potential well , respectively .",
    "then the complete state - space is four dimensional : @xmath8 .",
    "we start with a situation where we have one electron in each well .",
    "even if they are prepared completely independently , their pure quantum state has to be written in terms of slater determinants in order to respect the indistinguishability .",
    "operator matrix elements between such single slater determinants contain terms due to the antisymmetrization of coordinates ( `` exchange contributions '' in the language of hartree - fock theory ) .",
    "however , if the moduli of @xmath9 , @xmath10 have only vanishingly small overlap , these exchange correlations will also tend to zero for any physically meaningful operator .",
    "this situation is generically realized if the supports of the single - particle wavefunctions are essentially centered around locations being sufficiently apart from each other , or the particles are separated by a sufficiently large energy barrier . in this case",
    "the antisymmetrization has no physical effect and for all practical purposes it can be neglected .",
    "such observations clearly justify the treatment of indistinguishable particles separated by macroscopic distances as effectively distinguishable objects .",
    "so far , research in quantum information theory has concentrated on this case , where the exchange statistics of particles forming quantum registers could be neglected , or was not specified at all .    under these conditions",
    "we write an initial state @xmath11 where @xmath12 ( alice ) and @xmath13 ( bob ) are ( physical meaningful ) labels for the particle in the left and the right dot , respectively .",
    "the situation is shown in figure [ fig:2dotst0 ] .     i.e.  the case of separated wells . @xmath6 and @xmath7 denote the spatial part of the wave - function localized in the left and in the right well , respectively . ]",
    "now we want to analyze the situation when the two wells have been moved closer together or the energy barrier has been lowered .",
    "in such a situation the probability of finding , e.g. , alice s electron in the right well is non - vanishing .",
    "then the fermionic statistics is clearly essential and the two - electron wave - function has to be antisymmetrized and reads @xmath14 $ ] .",
    "the indices @xmath12 and @xmath13 are changed to @xmath15 and @xmath16 here to stress that the enumeration of the particles is completely arbitrary since these labels are not physical : because of the spatial overlap of the wavefunctions the individual particles labeled @xmath15 or @xmath16 are not accessible independently",
    ". the situation is shown in figure [ fig:2dotst1 ] .",
    ", i.e.  after lowering the tunnel barrier .",
    "the electronic wavefunctions are no longer completely localized in one of the wells . ]",
    "note that not only the labeling of the particles but also the notation suggesting a tensor product structure of the space of states is misleading because the actual state space is just a subspace of the complete tensor product @xcite . as a consequence of this fact",
    "the antisymmetrized state @xmath17 formally resembles an entangled state although it is clear that this entanglement is not accessible , and therefore can not be used as a resource in the sense discussed above for distinguishable particles . to emphasize this fundamental difference between distinguishable and indistinguishable particles",
    ", we will use the term _ quantum correlations _ to characterize _ useful _ correlations in systems of indistinguishable particles as opposed to _",
    "correlations _ arising purely from their statistics ( thereby following @xcite ) .",
    "quantum correlations in systems of indistinguishable fermions arise if more than one slater determinant is involved , i.e.  if there is no single - particle basis such that a given state of @xmath18 indistinguishable fermions can be represented as an elementary slater determinant ( i.e. a fully antisymmetric combination of @xmath18 orthogonal single - particle states ) .",
    "these correlations are the analogue of quantum entanglement in separated systems and are essential for quantum information processing in non - separated systems .    as an example suppose it is possible to control the coupling @xmath19 of the electrons such that at time @xmath20 @xmath21\\ ] ] which is illustrated in figure [ fig:2dotst2 ] .    ]    in the given single - particle basis , @xmath22 is written in terms of two elementary slater determinants ( and evidently there is no basis in which it can be written as a single one ) .",
    "this state contains some useful correlations beyond the required permutation symmetry as can be seen through localizing the particles again by switching off the interaction , i.e.  raising the tunneling barrier or moving the wells apart ( here we neglect the effects of non - adiabaticity , see @xcite for a more detailed study of these effects ) .",
    "this corresponds to a partition of the basis between alice and bob , such that alices hilbert space is formed by @xmath23 and bobs by @xmath24 .",
    "then again the electrons can be viewed as effectively distinguishable , provided that none of the dots is occupied by two electrons .",
    "this does not happen here because the final final state is @xmath25 $ ] , where _ new _",
    "labels @xmath12 and @xmath13 are attributed to the particles , corresponding to the dot in which they are found after separation , i.e. the electron found in the left ( right ) dot is named @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "@xmath26 is shown in figure [ fig:2dotst3 ] .    .",
    "raising the tunneling barrier localizes the wavefunctions again . ]",
    "the final state @xmath26 , shown in figure [ fig:2dotst3 ] is the bell state @xmath27 , i.e.  a _ maximally entangled _ two qubit state ( thus the operation performed in this example is the entangling gate @xmath2 ) . in this sense",
    "it is reasonable to call @xmath22 a _ maximally correlated _ state of two indistinguishable fermions in a four - dimensional single - particle space and to view it as a resource for the production of entangled states of distinguishable particles .    motivated by these considerations in @xcite",
    "we have developed a classification of states of two fermions with @xmath28 accessible single - particle states .",
    "this question was also addressed very recently by li _",
    "_ @xcite and by paskauskas and you @xcite . in these papers two - boson systems",
    "are examined and analogues to earlier results about two - fermion systems @xcite are derived .",
    "however , refs . @xcite and @xcite differ in detail about which two - boson states should be considered as analogues of entangled states ( in a bipartite system ) in a certain limiting case .",
    "zanardi @xcite discusses another approach , ignoring the original tensor product structure through a partition of the physical space into subsystems .",
    "the entangled entities then are no longer particles but modes .",
    "this approach may be seen as complementary to the one followed here . for completeness",
    "we present the corresponding formalism in appendix [ app : zanardi ] .",
    "it is reasonable to consider both kinds of quantum correlations ",
    "which one is more useful depends on the particular situation , for instance on their usefulness for concrete applications , e.g.  cryptography or teleportation .",
    "the `` classic '' examples for quantum entanglement were studied in systems composed of separated ( and therefore distinguishable ) subsystems .",
    "the most investigated case involves two parties , say @xmath12(lice ) and @xmath13(ob ) , having a finite - dimensional hilbert space @xmath29 and @xmath30 , respectively .",
    "this results in a total space @xmath31 .",
    "an important tool for the investigation of such bipartite systems is the bi - orthogonal schmidt decomposition @xcite .",
    "it states that for any state vector @xmath32 there exist bases of @xmath29 and @xmath30 such that @xmath33 where the basis states fulfill that @xmath34 .",
    "thus , each vector in both bases for @xmath29 and @xmath30 occurs at most in only one product vector in the above expansion . the expression ( [ schmidt ] )",
    "is an expansion of the state @xmath35 into a basis of orthogonal product vectors with a minimum number @xmath36 of nonzero terms .",
    "this number can take values between one and @xmath37 and is called the _ schmidt rank _ of @xmath35 .",
    "@xmath38 is entangled if and only if @xmath39 .",
    "let us now turn to the case of two identical fermions sharing an @xmath40-dimensional single - particle space @xmath41 .",
    "the total hilbert space is @xmath42 where @xmath43 denotes the antisymmetrization operator .",
    "a general state vector can be written as @xmath44 with fermionic creation operators @xmath45 acting on the vacuum @xmath46 .",
    "the antisymmetric coefficient matrix @xmath47 fulfills the normalization condition @xmath48 under a unitary transformation of the single - particle space , @xmath49 @xmath50 transforms as @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the transpose of @xmath53 . for any complex _ antisymmetric _",
    "@xmath54 matrix @xmath50 there is a unitary transformation @xmath53 such that @xmath55 has nonzero entries only in @xmath56 blocks along the diagonal @xcite .",
    "that is , @xmath57 \\quad{\\rm with}\\quad z_i=\\left [ \\begin{array}{cc } 0 & z_i \\\\ -z_i & 0 \\end{array } \\right]\\ , , \\label{z}\\ ] ] where @xmath58 for @xmath59 , and @xmath60 is the @xmath61 null matrix .",
    "each @xmath56 block @xmath62 corresponds to an elementary slater determinant .",
    "such elementary slater determinants are the analogues of product states in systems consisting of distinguishable parties .",
    "thus , when expressed in such a basis , the state @xmath63 is a sum of elementary slater determinants where each single - particle basis state occurs at most in one term .",
    "this property is analogous to the bi - orthogonality of the schmidt decomposition discussed above .",
    "the matrix ( [ z ] ) represents an expansion of @xmath63 into a basis of elementary slater determinants with a minimum number @xmath36 of non - vanishing terms .",
    "this number is analogous to the schmidt rank for the distinguishable case .",
    "therefore we shall call it the _ fermionic slater rank _ of @xmath63 @xcite , and an expansion of the above form a _",
    "slater decomposition _ of @xmath63 .",
    "similarly , a general state of a system of two indistinguishable bosons in an @xmath40-dimensional single - particle space reads @xmath64 with bosonic creation operators @xmath65 acting on the vacuum state .",
    "the symmetric coefficient matrix @xmath66 transforms under single - particle transformations just the same as in the fermionic case , @xmath67 for any complex _ symmetric _",
    "matrix @xmath68 there exists a unitary transformation @xmath53 such that the resulting matrix @xmath69 is diagonal @xcite , i.e. @xmath70 with @xmath71 for @xmath59 .",
    "in such a single particle basis the state @xmath72 is a linear combination of elementary two - boson slater permanents representing doubly occupied states .",
    "moreover eq .  ( [ bossl ] ) defines an expansion of the given state @xmath72 into slater permanents representing doubly occupied states with the smallest possible number @xmath36 of nonzero terms . we shall call this number the _ bosonic slater rank _ of @xmath72 .",
    "an expansion of the form ( [ bossl ] ) for a two - boson system was also obtained very recently in refs .",
    "moreover the fermionic analogue ( [ z ] ) of the bi - orthogonal schmidt decomposition of bipartite systems was also used earlier in studies of electron correlations in rydberg atoms @xcite .",
    "regarding slater determinant states in fermionic hilbert spaces we also mention interesting earlier work by rombouts and heyde @xcite who investigated the question under what circumstances a given many - fermion wavefunction can be cast as a slater determinant built up from in general _ non - orthogonal _ single - particle states . since a wavefunction of this kind can in general not be written as a single slater determinant constructed from _ orthogonal _ single - particle states , i.e.  has non - trivial quantum correlations beyond simple antisymmetrization effects , the criteria obtained in @xcite do not address the issues here .    as we saw , elementary slater determinants in two - fermion systems , i.e.states with slater rank one , are the natural analogues of product states in systems of distinguishable parties .",
    "one needs at least a fermionic state of slater rank two to form a quantum correlated state corresponding to a schmidt rank two state of separated particles .",
    "in contrast , in the bosonic case one needs at least a state of slater rank four to perform the same task .",
    "this can already be seen from the fact that for distinguishable particles entangled states need at least a @xmath73 dimensional hilbert space .    in the following",
    "we shall refer to the schmidt rank or slater rank of a given pure state also as its _ quantum correlation rank_.      one of the most important issues in quantum information theory is the qualification and quantification of entanglement between several subsystems in a given state @xmath74 . for the case of two _",
    "distinguishable _ parties , a useful measure of entanglement of pure states is the von neumann - entropy of reduced density matrices constructed from the density matrix @xmath75 @xcite : @xmath76 where the reduced density matrices are obtained by tracing out one of the subsystems , @xmath77 and vice versa . with the help of the bi - orthogonal schmidt decomposition of @xmath35",
    "one shows that both reduced density matrices have the same spectrum and therefore the same entropy , as stated in eq .",
    "( [ vneuent ] ) .",
    "in particular , the schmidt rank of @xmath35 equals the algebraic rank of the reduced density matrices .",
    "a pure state is non - entangled if and only if its reduced density matrices are again pure states , and it is maximally entangled if its reduced density matrices are `` maximally mixed '' , i.e. if they have only one non - zero eigenvalue with a multiplicity of @xmath37 .",
    "the lowest - dimensional system of two distinguishable particles having non - trivial entanglement properties consists of just two qubits , i.e.   @xmath78 . for this system ,",
    "the entanglement measure ( [ vneuent ] ) takes a particularly simple form if the state @xmath35 is expressed in the so - called _ magic basis _ , @xmath79 i.e. @xmath80 , where an obvious notation has been used .",
    "with respect to this basis it holds @xcite @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the binary entropy function and the `` concurrence '' @xmath83 is defined by @xmath84 .",
    "thus , a state is fully entangled if and only if all its coefficients with respect to the magic basis have the same phase . what is furthermore `` magic '' about this basis is the fact that its elements are ( pseudo-)eigenstates of the time reversal operator @xmath85 @xcite : @xmath86 with @xmath87 here @xmath88 are pauli matrices in the basis used in the construction of the magic basis ( [ magbas ] ) , and @xmath89 is the operator of complex conjugation which acts on a product state of basis vectors as @xmath90 , where @xmath91 , and on a general vector as @xmath92",
    ". these relations are part of the definition of @xmath89 .",
    "@xmath93 is invariant under arbitrary su(2 ) transformations performed independently on the two subsystems , due to the relation @xmath94 for any @xmath95 .",
    "it was pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite that this property is particular to the @xmath56 matrix @xmath96 , and does not have a true analogue in higher dimensions .",
    "however , in the following we will encounter similar invariance relations in higher - dimensional spaces where the manifold of transformations is restricted to a physically motivated subgroup of the unitary group .    using the time reversal operator @xmath93",
    ", the concurrence can be written as @xmath97 with @xmath98 . moreover , since the entanglement measure @xmath99 is a monotonous function of @xmath83 with both functions ranging from zero to one , one can equally well use @xmath83 as a measure of entanglement @xcite , as we shall do in the following .",
    "the definition of the magic basis ( and as well of the complex conjugation operator @xmath100 ) refers explicitly to certain bases in the two subsystems .",
    "however , using the above invariance property , it is straightforward to show that switching to different local bases has only trivial effects without any physical significance . in particular ,",
    "the concurrence is invariant under such operations .",
    "this can be seen from writing @xmath38 in the computational basis as @xmath101 .",
    "then @xmath102 and in this context it has been named `` tangle '' by wootters @xcite .",
    "let us now turn to the case of two fermions .",
    "the lowest - dimensional system allowing a slater rank larger than one has a four - dimensional single - particle space resulting in a six - dimensional two - particle hilbert space .",
    "this case was analyzed first in ref .",
    "@xcite where a fermionic analogue of the two - qubit concurrence was found .",
    "it can be constructed in the following way : for a given state @xmath103 defined by its coefficient matrix @xmath47 , define the dual matrix @xmath104 by @xmath105 with @xmath106 being the usual totally antisymmetric unit tensor .",
    "then the concurrence @xmath107 can be defined as @xcite @xmath108 obviously , @xmath107 ranges from zero to one .",
    "importantly it vanishes if and only if the state @xmath109 has the fermionic slater rank one , i.e. is an elementary slater determinant .",
    "this statement was proved first in ref .",
    "@xcite ; an alternative proof can be given using the slater decomposition of @xmath63 and observing that @xmath110 this relation is just a special case of a general expression for the determinant of an antisymmetric @xmath111 matrix @xmath50 , @xmath112 which can be proved readily by the same means .",
    "note the formal analogy to the definition of the tangle of two qubits @xcite .",
    "moreover , it is straightforward to show that the concurrence is invariant under arbitrary su(4 ) transformations in the single - particle space .",
    "more generally , for any two states @xmath113 , @xmath114 being subject to a single - particle transformation @xmath115 , @xmath116 , @xmath117 , it holds @xmath118    in summary , the concurrence @xmath107 constitutes , in analogy to the case of two qubits , a measure of `` entanglement '' for any two - fermion state @xmath63 .",
    "it ranges from zero for `` non - entangled '' states ( having slater rank one ) to one for `` fully entangled '' states which are collinear with their duals . in this case",
    "the slater decomposition of @xmath63 consists of two elementary slater determinants having the same weight .    from the occurrence of the complex conjugation in the definition of the dual state ( [ defdual ] ) it is obvious that the dualisation of a two - fermion state is an anti - linear operation .",
    "in fact , as we will illustrate below , the dualisation of a state @xmath63 again corresponds to time reversal .",
    "as another physical interpretation , it can be identified with a particle - hole - transformation , @xmath119 along with a complex conjugation .",
    "the operator of dualisation @xmath93 , @xmath120 , can be written as @xmath121 where @xmath100 is the anti - linear operator of complex conjugation acting on the single - particle states and the fermionic vacuum as @xmath122    as a further analogy to the two - qubit case one also has a magic basis , i.e. a basis of ( pseudo-)eigenstates of the dualisation operator ( [ defdualop ] ) : @xmath123 expressed in this basis , the concurrence of a state @xmath124 just reads @xmath125 .",
    "therefore , @xmath63 has a concurrence of modulus one if and only if all its coefficients with respect to the magic basis have the same phase .    like in the two - qubit case , the definition of the complex conjugation operator @xmath100 and the magic basis refers to a certain choice of basis in the single - particle space",
    "however , due to the invariance properties described above , this does not have physically significant consequences .",
    "a four - dimensional single - particle space can formally be viewed as the hilbert space of a spin-@xmath126-object .",
    "having two indistinguishable fermions in this system means coupling two spin-@xmath126 states to total spin states that are antisymmetric under particle exchange .",
    "this leads to the two multiplets with even total spin , i.e. @xmath127 and @xmath128 .",
    "when the single - particle states labeled so far by @xmath129 are interpreted as states of a spin-@xmath126 particle with @xmath130 ( @xmath131 ) these multiplet states read explicitly : @xmath132 the phase of the last singlet state has been adjusted such that the dualisation operator reads in this ordered basis @xmath133 which is nothing but the time reversal operator acting on the two multiplets @xmath127 and @xmath128 .",
    "thus , the operation of dualisation can also be interpreted as a time reversal operation performed on appropriate spin objects . however , this interpretation is not necessarily the physically most natural one : the notion of dualisation and entanglement - like quantum correlations between indistinguishable fermions was first investigated for the case of two electrons ( carrying a spin of @xmath134 ) in a system of two quantum dots @xcite . there",
    "the interpretation of @xmath85 as the anti - linear implementation of a particle - hole - transformation , rather than time reversal of formal spin objects , seems clearly more appropriate .",
    "therefore we shall retain the general term dualisation for such an operation in the two kinds of systems investigated so far , and also in the case of a bosonic system to be explored below .",
    "having established all these analogies between two qubits and a system of two fermions sharing a four - dimensional single particle space , it is natural to ask whether similar observations can be made for a system of two bosons .",
    "the bosonic system showing properties analogous to those discussed before consists of two indistinguishable bosons in a two - dimensional single - particle space .",
    "this is the smallest - dimensional system admitting states with a bosonic slater rank greater than one .",
    "it can be viewed as the symmetrized version of the two - qubit system , and its two - boson space represents therefore the hilbert space of a spin-1-object .",
    "a general state vector of this system reads @xmath135 with a coefficient matrix @xmath136 being subject to the normalization condition @xmath137 .",
    "the appropriate dualisation operator is @xmath138 where @xmath100 is the complex conjugation operator with analogous properties as above , and the operator @xmath139 acts in the single - particle space as @xmath140 i.e. @xmath139 exchanges the state labels inferring a sign .",
    "when expressed in the ordered basis @xmath141 the dualisation operator reads @xmath142 which is , as natural , just the time reversal operator for a spin-1-object .",
    "now the concurrence @xmath143 can be defined as the modulus of the scalar product of @xmath72 with its dual @xmath144 and expressed as @xmath145 the last equation makes immediately obvious that @xmath143 is invariant under su(2 ) transformations in the single - particle space and is zero if and only if @xmath72 has bosonic slater rank one .",
    "therefore this quantity has properties that are completely analogous to the two other cases before .",

    "this is analogous to three distinguishable qubits where @xmath261 ( c.f .",
