    "jets are ubiquitous and are observed to accompany a variety of astrophysical objects such as , stellar - mass and super - massive black hole candidates , neutron stars , white dwarfs , young stellar objects ( ysos ) etc .",
    "these outflows exhibit different physical scales and power at one extreme , agns have jets with typical sizes @xmath0 few kpc to few @xmath1 kpc , jet velocities comparable to @xmath2 ( where @xmath2 is the light speed ) , luminosity range @xmath3erg / s and central mass in the range @xmath4 ( where @xmath5 is the mass of sun ) , while in the other extreme , yso jets have typical size @xmath6pc , outflow velocity @xmath7 , luminosity range @xmath8erg / s , and emerge from protostars with mass @xmath9 . in other words , only jets around compact objects are truly relativistic .",
    "jets around black hole candidates , be it from agns or micro - quasars , are shrouded in mystery . since black holes",
    "do not have hard surface and/or any atmosphere , therefore jets can only originate from the matter accreting onto it .",
    "moreover , the terminal speed of jets from around compact objects , though relativistic , but can vary widely too . for jets around grs 1915 + 105 or m87 exhibit terminal speed above ninety percent the speed of light @xcite , while the jet around ss433 is merely around @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "therefore , not only there is no consensus about the origin of jets , even the acceleration mechanism of jets are not well understood .",
    "there are few interesting properties of jets around compact objects .",
    "@xcite showed that the jet around m87 seems to originate within a region less than @xmath11 ( @xmath12 is the schwarzschild radius ) around the central object .",
    "in other words , entire accretion disc do not participate in generation of jets , but only the inner region of the accretion disc participate in jet generation .",
    "although the connection between jet states and spectral states of the accretion disc has not been conclusively established for massive black hole candidates like the agns , but for micro - quasars , this connection has firmly been established @xcite .",
    "persistent , quasi steady , mildly relativistic jets are observed in ` hard spectral state ' ( maximum power in the hard power law tail ) of the accretion disc .",
    "the jet seems to get stronger as the spectral state of accretion disc moves to the intermediate states . and",
    "truly relativistic jet blobs are generated during state transition to the steep power law state .",
    "no jet activity is observed in the canonical soft state ( maximum power in modified black body component ) @xcite .",
    "such close corelation of jet with the radiative states of the disc , points to the fact that the accretion disc physics is responsible for jet generation .",
    "matter accreting onto a compact object should possess some angular momentum and due to differential rotation some form of anomalous viscosity too .",
    "the first viscous disc model seriously considered by the community is the standard thin disc @xcite , although thin disc s inability to explain the origin of power - law photons , as well as , the theoretical inconsistencies like adhoc inner boundary condition , remained an overbearing concern .",
    "it was understood that a source of hot electron distribution a comptonizing corona , is required to explain the hard power law photons in the spectra of black hole candidates @xcite . since the boundary condition of black hole accretion is necessarily transonic , disc models with",
    "significant advective term gained popularity .",
    "the most popular model among the advective disc models was known as adaf or advection dominated accretion flow @xcite .",
    "this model is characterized by a single sonic point close to the horizon and subsonic elsewhere .",
    "however , it has been shown earlier that multiple sonic point may exist for inviscid rotating flow @xcite , and was confirmed that this is also true for dissipative advective accretion discs @xcite .",
    "and therefore it was shown by various authors that adaf is only a subset of general advective solution @xcite .",
    "general advective solutions which admits multiple sonic points may harbour standing or time - dependent shock solutions @xcite .",
    "shock in accretion has some interesting consequences , for the post shock hot electrons may inverse comptonize soft photons to produce the non - thermal hard radiation tail @xcite .",
    "a dominant shock associates with a low supply of soft photons from external keplerian disc , and the hot post - shock region inverse - comptonizes the intercepted photons and produces the low / hard state . and an increased supply of keplerian matter means supply of extra soft photons to cool down the post - shock region which results in weakening of , or , complete removal of the shock to produce the canonical high / soft state .",
    "in fact , the hardness intensity diagram ( hid ) of gro j 1655 - 40 was well explained by shocked accretion disc @xcite .",
    "these studies also showed that the steady state shock solutions are possible in a limited range of the parameter space , while oscillating or time dependent shocks are possible for a wide range of parameters or boundary conditions @xcite . and",
    "since these post - shock region also emits high energy radiations , therefore quasi - periodic oscillation of the shocked disc will give rise to quasi - periodic oscillation in hard radiations as well , and was furthered as a model for quasi - periodic oscillations or qpos @xcite .",
    "it was shown from observations that the spectral index increases ( hard to soft transition ) with the increase of qpo frequency , but remarkably the spectral index saturates ( indicating the attainment of high / soft state ) and then there are no qpo detected @xcite .",
    "the evolution of the qpo frequency with the spectral state for outburst sources like xtej1550 - 654 , gro 1655 - 40 etc , has been explained well with a model of inward drift of oscillating shock which translates into a spectral state transition from low / hard to intermediate hard . and the final disappearance of qpo with the disappearance of the inner disc or the post - shock disc @xcite . and",
    "it has been shown that indeed for the same outer boundary condition , the shock drifts inwards with the increase of the viscosity parameter @xcite .",
    "this implies that , with the increase of viscosity the pre - shock disc size increases , which increases the supply of soft photons .",
    "as the post - shock disc gets reduced , eventually the total output of the thermal comptonization ( dominant spectra in low / hard state ) decreases too . and",
    "since according to the advective accretion disc model , oscillation of post - shock disc gives rise to qpo , so the decrease of shock location increases the qpo frequency , until the shock itself disappears .",
    "hence the transition from hard to soft state , or in other words , the increase of spectral index should be correlated with the increase of qpo frequency , and finally the spectral index saturates @xcite as the contribution to the radiation from post - shock disc becomes negligible @xcite .    in our previous paper @xcite ,",
    "we have presented all possible advective viscous accretion solutions , including shocked and shock free solutions .",
    "a shocked accretion disc is more interesting , because the post - shock disc being hot can drive bipolar - outflows @xcite . since shock forms typically at @xmath13few @xmath14 , so the assertion that jet base is the inner part of the disc , favours the observational evidence from m87 that jet base is indeed @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "since it has also been shown that agns are just a scaled up version of the galactic black holes @xcite , therefore , following the above evidence one may argue that even for galactic black holes the jet base should be close to the central object .",
    "however , it is not just theoretical expectation that the inner region around agns and micro - quasars should be similar , therefore , the jet base for microquasars too would be close to the horizon . even in case of galactic black hole candidates ( bhc ) ,",
    "the detection of strong radio flares ( read jets ) with simultaneous disappearance of qpos and the absence of the comptonized component , points out to the fact that the same region which gave rise to the comptonized component and generated the qpo has been ejected as relativistic jets @xcite .",
    "the shocked accretion disc model seems to satisfy all these criteria , starting with the direct evidence of m87 jet originating close to the black hole , the connection between growth of qpo frequency , comptonized component and the radio flare , to the disappearance of jet activity in the soft state ( no or very weak shock ) .",
    "@xcite showed ( fig .",
    "5 of their paper ) that the correlation between thermally driven jets from shocked accretion discs and the spectral states from the same discs seems to follow the conclusions of observations of 10 microquasars @xcite . since post - shock disc produces the jets therefore when shock is absent or very weak , jets disappear mimicking the soft state .",
    "but thermally driven jets can achieve terminal speed up to @xmath16^{1/2}$ ] , where @xmath17 is the sound speed at the base , which for a shocked disc is the sound speed of the post - shock disc , and @xmath18 is the gravitational potential at the jet base .",
    "now the maximum sound speed physically possible is @xmath19 , and that the value of @xmath18 is quite significant because the jet base is rather close to the horizon @xcite . given these facts , the expression of terminal speed given above indicates that , truly relativistic jet terminal speed is not possible by only thermal driving .",
    "furthermore , jet states are correlated with the hard spectral states of the accretion disc , therefore , can the disc radiation accelerate the outflowing jet material ? in this respect , one may raise the issue that jet activities are not always observed during the state transition , which might be due to the lack of availability of simultaneous x - ray and radio / infra - red measurements .",
    "however , @xcite studied about 10 sources to draw the correlation between jet activity with the hard states , and the conclusion that jets are not seen during the canonical soft states .",
    "we would therefore like to study the interaction of radiations from the hard / hard intermediate states with the emanating jet , or in our parlance , the acceleration of jets with the radiation from a shocked disc , and how this radiative acceleration of jets is influenced with the change in viscosity parameter of the disc .",
    "it is to be remembered that , since we are investigating the disc in steady state , we are actually studying the generation and acceleration of steady , mildly relativistic jets generally associated with hard to hard intermediate states .",
    "the strong radio flares associated with relativistic blob ejections during hard intermediate to soft intermediate state transition @xcite is intrinsically a time dependent phenomenon and has not been addressed in this paper . since we have not incorporated all the physical aspects to mimic the transient phenomena , in this limited sense",
    "the results depend on the model assumptions .",
    "interaction of the disc radiation with the outflowing matter has been followed by many authors .",
    "@xcite studied radiative acceleration of jets above a keplerian disc , but in absence of radiation drag .",
    "@xcite showed that radiation drag is important for jets powered by radiation from a thick accretion disc @xcite .",
    "including radiation momentum deposition on an axial particle jet illuminated by an infinite thin disc in presence of drag term , @xcite showed that the upper limit of the terminal speed is around @xmath20 of @xmath2 .",
    "investigations on radiatively driven jets were extended by @xcite to generate relativistic terminal speeds for particle jets .",
    "moreover , the interaction of radiations from shocked accretion disc and jets were studied too @xcite .",
    "since shocked discs have two radiation sources , namely , the post - shock and pre - shock disc , therefore the redistribution of radiative power amongst these sources , could efficiently accelerate the jet around its axis .",
    "however , jets studied in the above mentioned papers were decoupled from the disc . in this paper",
    "we would like to study radiatively driven jet which is generated self consistently from the underlying accretion disc .",
    "in other words , we combine the accretion - ejection physics described by @xcite with the effect of radiative momentum deposition on the jets as shown by @xcite .    in the next section",
    ", we present the simplifying assumptions and equations of motion . in section 3 ,",
    "we present the methodology of solution . and in the last section we present the solutions and discussion .",
    "in this paper , we have assumed the axis - symmetric disc - jet system to be in steady state .",
    "the black hole is assumed to be non - rotating described by the pseudo - newtonian potential introduced by @xcite .",
    "the viscosity prescription in the accretion disc is described by the shakura - sunyaev @xmath21 viscosity .",
    "the jets are tenuous and should have less differential rotation than the accretion disc , as a result the viscosity in jets can be ignored . to negate any resulting torque ,",
    "the angular momentum at the jet base is assumed same as that of the local value of angular momentum of the disc .",
    "we estimate the radiative moments , namely , the radiative energy density , flux , and radiative pressure from the disc .",
    "the jets being optically thin are subjected to radiation force including the drag terms .",
    "figure 1 , shows the schematic diagram of the disc - jet system , where the pre - shock , post - shock disc and the jet are clearly marked .",
    "the black hole is at bh .",
    "the accretion disc occupies the space on or about the equatorial plane , and the jet flow geometry is about the axis of symmetry .",
    "we have used the geometric unit system where , @xmath22 ( @xmath23 is the mass of the black hole , @xmath24 is the gravitational constant ) .",
    "therefore , in this representation the unit of length is , the schwarzschild radius or @xmath12 , the unit of mass is that of the central black hole @xmath23 , and that of time is @xmath25 , respectively , consequently the unit of speed is @xmath2 .",
    "since we are investigating self - consistent accretion - ejection system , we should present the governing equations together .",
    "however , since the accretion and jets follow different flow geometries , we present them separately . in section 2.1.1",
    ", we present equations of motions , which when solved gives us the accretion solution . in section 2.1.2 , the equations governing the jet solution are presented . and",

    "we give a brief account of them .",

    "the issue of radiative acceleration of jets have been studied earlier @xcite , however , the jet base conditions in those works were assumed and were not self consistently obtained . in this paper , we do study the radiative acceleration of jets , but also by self - consistently solving the jet solution from the accretion disc solution itself .",

    "we consider a general radiative transfer model ( chakrabarti & mandal 2006 ) which consists of two components , a keplerian disc on the equatorial plane and a sub - keplerian component on the top of the keplerian disc .",
    "the keplerian disc supplies the multi - colour black body photons and a fraction of that photons are inverse - comptonized by post - shock region .",
    "the pre - shock sub - keplerian disc emits radiation via bremsstrahlung and synchrotron process whereas the post - shock region produces the same as in pre - shock along with the comptonization of the local and intercepted soft photons .",
    "we calculate the radiation spectrum of accretion disc using the viscous transonic shocked solution for a given outer boundary condition @xmath281 at @xmath227 . for a given value of @xmath21",
    ", a shock is formed at @xmath102 .",
    "the frequency integrated pre - shock and post - shock luminosity is then calculated .",
    "it has been shown in @xcite that for the same set of boundary conditions , @xmath102 decreases if @xmath21 is increased . in our case for a range of @xmath282 , for flows starting with the same injection values mentioned above , the shock location changes from @xmath283 ( fig .",
    "we calculate the ratio of post - shock to pre - shock luminosity @xmath240 for different values of @xmath102 in the range mentioned above and it has been plotted by dots in fig .",
    "( a1b ) . in fig",
    "a1c we plot the associated variation in photon index , which shows the spectra softens as shock moves inward .",
    "the ratio ( @xmath240 ) increases initially as the shock move inward , reaching a maximum value and then decreases sharply .",
    "this behaviour is due to fact that initially as shock moves inward both post - shock temperature and density increases and hence post - shock luminosity increases but as shock reaches closer to central object the pre - shock luminosity @xmath152 increases and the increased supply of pre - shock photons cools down the post - shock flow , and therefore the ratio would decrease too .",
    "we have fitted a polynomial through the model data points and this general behaviour of @xmath240 with @xmath102 is used to calculate @xmath154 for given value of @xmath152 ."
