    "reports of a narrow , light exotic baryon , the @xmath0 , have stirred considerable interest over the past year .",
    "although the existence of the @xmath0 has yet to be decisively confirmed@xcite , it certainly must be taken seriously .",
    "perhaps the most striking characteristic of the @xmath2 is its narrow width .",
    "most sightings quote only upper limits on @xmath9 determined by experimental resolution .",
    "these limits are as small as 9 mev@xcite .",
    "cahn and trilling have extracted @xmath10 mev from their analysis of xenon bubble chamber data@xcite .",
    "the @xmath2 is seen as a bump in @xmath11 or @xmath12 invariant mass spectra .",
    "these are the only open channels to which it can couple , therefore @xmath2 must appear in some partial wave of definite angular momentum , @xmath13 , isospin , @xmath14 , and orbital angular momentum , @xmath15 , in @xmath3 scattering the elastic scattering cross section is @xmath16 for center of mass momentum @xmath17 . at a narrow , elastic resonance",
    "the phase shift must rise rapidly through @xmath18 .",
    "therefore the @xmath2 must appear as a classic breit - wigner resonance in @xmath3 scattering .",
    "re - evaluations of old @xmath3 scattering data fail to show any evidence of the @xmath2 , leading to upper limits on its width in the range of 0.8  `` a few '' mev @xcite .",
    "it is clear that the @xmath2 is narrow , but so are other hadrons like the @xmath19 ( @xmath20 mev ) and @xmath5 ( @xmath21 mev ) .",
    "we think we know what makes these states narrow , but so far we lack a good physical explanation why the @xmath2 should be so stable .",
    "its small width poses a challenge for any theoretical interpretation . in this paper",
    "we use low energy scattering theory to gauge how great is the challenge . in particular we compare the width of the @xmath2 with what we should expect for a resonance that appears at 1540 mev in @xmath3 scattering in qcd , where the characteristic range of interactions is @xmath4 1 fermi .    the analysis of low energy hadron - hadron scattering in qcd is , in general , a very difficult problem .",
    "typically many channels are open , inelastic processes ( particle production ) are important , and relativistic effects can not be ignored .",
    "the @xmath19 , for example , is thought to be predominantly a @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 state strongly coupled to @xmath25 . at 1020 mev",
    "the kaons are non - relativistic .",
    "however the @xmath26 couples strongly to @xmath27 which must be described relativistically , and to @xmath28 which involves production and possibly the @xmath29 resonance in the final state . in general",
    "it is not possible to subject qcd models of hadrons to definitive tests by making predictions for hadron - hadron scattering .",
    "the @xmath30 is a striking exception : particle production is not kinematically possible ; only one channel is open has definite isospin . ] ; and the motion is non - relativistic ( @xmath31 for the nucleon and 0.30 for the kaon )",
    ". therefore it should be possible to use the methods of non - relativistic , two - body scattering theory , based on the schrdinger equation , to help characterize this peculiar particle .    roughly speaking",
    " we shall be more precise in the following sections  a resonance at low energy ( a ) can arise from the potential in the @xmath3 channel or ( b ) can be induced in @xmath3 scattering by coupling to a closed or confined channel .",
    "these mechanisms differ both in principle and in practice .",
    "case ( a ) is the one familiar from single channel potential scattering .",
    "the analysis of case ( a ) begins with a non - relativistic @xmath3 potential , @xmath32 , which may depend on isospin , @xmath15 and @xmath13 .",
    "if @xmath32 is attractive enough , it can generate a resonance in partial waves with @xmath33 , where the angular momentum barrier stabilizes the resonance .",
    "a resonance in the @xmath7-wave requires a potential with repulsion at long distances and attraction within .",
    "the resonance is a feature of the @xmath3 continuum .",
    "if the interaction were `` turned off '' , the resonance would become broader and broader until it disappeared into the continuum .",
    "case ( b ) is quite different",
    ". the resonance exists _ ab initio _ , independent of the @xmath3 interaction . in the case of a non - exotic channel in , say , @xmath34 scattering , it could be a @xmath35 state which happens to have the same quantum numbers as some @xmath36 partial wave . if quark pair creation is ignored , it is stable  a zero width bound state immersed in the meson - nucleon continuum . as the coupling is `` turned on '' , the state develops a width and appears as a resonance in meson nucleon scattering .",
    "cases ( a ) and ( b ) behave oppositely as the relevant coupling is sent to zero : potential resonances disappear from the scattering channel by subsiding into the continuum , confined channel resonances disappear because their widths go to zero .",
    "our prejudice is that most hadrons should be regarded as closed channel resonances : they decouple from hadron - hadron scattering as quark pair creation is turned off .",
    "however , exotics in general , and the @xmath2 in particular , could be an exception .",
    "the @xmath2 could be a @xmath3 scattering state , since its minimal quark content is @xmath37 .",
    "therefore we are obliged to compare the predictions of both mechanisms , ( a ) and ( b ) , with the properties of the @xmath2 .",
    "case ( a )  single channel , non - relativistic potential scattering  needs no introduction .",
    "in contrast , case ( b ) , non - relativistic scattering with confined channels , is not familiar to particle physicists .",
    "the natural formalism for discussing resonances in closed or confined channels in non - relativistic scattering was developed by fano and feshbach@xcite .",
    "it is well known in atomic and nuclear physics where the resulting states are known as `` feshbach resonances '' .",
    "the basic idea is extremely simple . in the case of two channels , one open ,",
    "the other closed / confined , the scattering particles make a transition to the closed channel where there is assumed to be an energy eigenstate nearby .",
    "the system sits in this state until the transition is reversed . if the transition potential is weak , the resonance is narrow .",
    "we explain the method further when we apply it to the @xmath38 system in section 3 .",
    "we consider both possible origins for the @xmath2 . in case ( a )",
    "we find that the @xmath2 s narrow width is unnatural unless the orbital angular momentum in the @xmath3 system is at least @xmath39 , or better @xmath40 .",
    "there is no resonance for @xmath41 . for @xmath42 , a resonance at 1540 mev with width of order 1 mev",
    "requires a unacceptably short range or otherwise unnatural potential@xcite .",
    "further results for this case are presented in fig .  1 .",
    "in case ( b ) we find the strength of coupling between the scattering channel and the confined / closed channel as a function of the range , @xmath43 , and orbital angular momentum @xmath15 , required to produce a width of order 1 mev . in order to normalize this strength ,",
    "we compare it with the results of an identical calculation for the @xmath5 .",
    "the @xmath5 is an excellent candidate for comparison because it is well described as a @xmath44-configuration that requires quark pair creation in order to decay into @xmath45 .",
    "since it has approximately the same mass as the @xmath2 , the kinematics of @xmath46 and @xmath47 are nearly identical .",
    "the @xmath5 partial width into @xmath45 is 7 mev . is not entirely analogous to the @xmath2",
    "is that it also couples to @xmath48 . for the purposes of this estimate we ignore the @xmath48 channel and use the @xmath45 partial width instead of the full width of the @xmath5 . ]",
    "our conclusions in this case depend on @xmath43 and are summarized in fig .  2 .",
    "in brief , for @xmath41 and @xmath49 1 fm , a state with the width of the @xmath2 would have to couple to @xmath3 with strength of order 1/50 of the @xmath50 coupling .",
    "for @xmath42 the strength would have to be of order 1/10 of the @xmath51 coupling , and for @xmath39 , 1/3 .",
    "our analysis has serious consequences for models of the @xmath2 .",
    "the important distinction between models is whether they rely on the @xmath3 potential to generate the resonance or they allow for confined / closed channels .",
    "chiral soliton models ( csm ) fall into the first class and quark models can , at least in principle , lie in the second .",
    "the width of the @xmath2 has been discussed in the chiral soliton model . indeed a narrow width was predicted before the particle was reported@xcite .",
    "however these predictions were not based on explicit calculations of @xmath3 scattering , but rather on the extraction of coupling constants using effective field theory . the meson - nucleon continuum in the csm model",
    "is described by quantizing mesonic small oscillations in the soliton background@xcite .",
    "partial wave amplitudes can be projected out using methods of group theory .",
    "since the model includes nothing beyond mesons and baryons ( which are coherent states of the meson field ) , it appears to fall into the category of @xmath3 potential models .",
    "this makes the extremely narrow width of the @xmath2 a mystery in the csm unless a ) @xmath52 , b ) the @xmath3 potential is very unusual , or c ) the resonance arises through coupling to some heretofore unknown closed or confined channel .",
    "quark models of the @xmath2 fare a little better .",
    "correlated quark models ( diquarks , triquarks , _ etc .",
    "_ ) introduce color configurations of the @xmath37 system which can not separate into @xmath3@xcite .",
    "if so , case ( b ) would apply .",
    "the configuration barrier that prevents @xmath2 decay has to be quite high .",
    "@xmath46 is suppressed by quark pair creation and @xmath39 with a resulting partial width of 7 mev .",
    "the barrier preventing the @xmath37 system from reorganizing into @xmath3 would have to be almost two orders of magnitude greater than this if it has @xmath41 and one order of magnitude greater for @xmath42 .",
    "this is a significant constraint on quark models .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows : in section 2 we analyze the @xmath2 as a potential scattering resonance ( case ( a ) ) and in section 3 we analyze it as a bound state in the @xmath3 continuum ( case ( b ) ) .",
    "resonances in non - relativistic potential scattering arise from the interplay of attraction and repulsion .",
    "there are no resonances in a uniformly attractive potential , only virtual states or bound states .",
    "the angular momentum barrier , @xmath53 , adds a repulsive term which can generate resonances for @xmath54 in otherwise attractive potentials . to generate a resonance in the @xmath7-wave it would be necessary to introduce a potential that is repulsive at long distances and strongly attractive at shorter distances .",
    "we put such unusual potentials aside and limit ourselves to the uniformly attractive case . under these conditions potential scattering can not explain a narrow resonance in the @xmath7-wave .    for @xmath54 , the narrower the resonance at a fixed center - of - mass momentum , @xmath55 , the shorter the range and greater the depth of the potential .",
    "a shorter range produces a higher barrier but must be accompanied by a greater depth in order to keep @xmath55 fixed .",
    "the question is , therefore , whether the width of the @xmath0 requires a range which is unnaturally small or equivalently , a potential that is unnaturally deep . to answer the question quantitatively",
    "we must choose a specific form for the potential @xmath32 .",
    "for our purposes the simplest form , a potential hole , or `` square well '' , @xmath56 , is adequate .",
    "smoothing out the edges of the square well would not change our results significantly .",
    "also we have checked that using a yukawa potential @xmath57 does not change our results qualitatively .",
    "in fact a square well is probably more realistic than a yukawa because the singularity at @xmath58 in the yukawa potential is not realistic in qcd since the kaon and nucleon are not point particles .    in the channel with angular momentum @xmath15 , the phase shift , @xmath59 , for the square well",
    "is given by an elementary calculation , @xmath60 where @xmath61 and @xmath62 and @xmath63 are spherical bessel and neumann functions respectively .",
    "the resonance , if there is one , is associated with a pole in the scattering amplitude , @xmath64 , which is related to @xmath59 by @xmath65 . for a narrow resonance",
    "any of the conventional definitions of the resonance location and width will suffice . to be specific",
    "we use the definitions suggested by sakurai @xcite , according to which the resonant energy @xmath66 is defined by @xmath67 and width by @xmath68^{-1}.\\ ] ] this is meaningful only if @xmath69 .",
    "of course we are interested in generating a narrow resonance , therefore in presenting the results below we restrict to values of @xmath43 for which this strong inequality is satisfied .",
    "our results are shown in fig .",
    "1(a - c ) for @xmath70 , and @xmath71 , where we plot the width and the depth of the potential as functions of the range , @xmath43 , the depth having been adjusted to keep the resonance at @xmath72 mev corresponding to @xmath73 mev . in fig .",
    "2(d ) we show the same information for a yukawa potential for @xmath42 .",
    "we conclude that a narrow @xmath2 at 1540 mev can not be obtained from a `` typical '' potential for @xmath41 or @xmath42 .",
    "even @xmath39 requires quite a short range @xmath74 fm for a width of 1 mev .",
    "should the @xmath2 be established to occur in the @xmath7- or @xmath8- wave , its origin can not lie in the forces between kaons and nucleons unless they are characterized by a distance scale very different from @xmath75 or involve some exotic behavior like repulsion at long distances .",

    "also shown is the depth of the potential ( dashed ) .",
    ", width=680 ]",
    "having failed to find a narrow @xmath2 in a low partial wave in @xmath3 potential scattering , we explore the possibility of adding the resonance by hand as a bound state in the @xmath3 continuum which can decay to @xmath3 .",
    "we review the formulation and solution of this simple scattering problem since it is not so widely known .",
    "in addition to the open @xmath3 channel ( of definite isospin ) we introduce a second channel which only has discrete eigenstates in the energy range of interest .",
    "the two channels are coupled by an off - diagonal potential , @xmath76 , which without loss of generality we take to be real .",
    "we do not need to know the potential in channel-2 .",
    "the potential in channel-1 , @xmath77 , is also unimportant .",
    "since it does not generate the resonance , it merely introduces a smooth background phase in the neighborhood of the narrow ( by assumption ) resonance generated by the bound state in channel-2 .",
    "therefore we set @xmath78 .",
    "the hamiltonian for this system is given by @xmath79 as explained , we assume that @xmath80 has a bound state solution given by @xmath81 with @xmath82= 270 mev .",
    "we want to solve coupled set of schrdinger equations @xmath83 with @xmath84 , @xmath85 to obtain the scattering amplitude in channel-1 .",
    "the particular solution for the second equation can be written in terms of the green s function in channel-2 , @xmath86 note the absence of a solution , @xmath87 , to the homogeneous equation , @xmath88 , which is excluded because there is no incoming wave in this confined / closed channel .",
    "this problem is simplified dramatically because the resonance is narrow .",
    "therefore we are only interested in values of @xmath17 close to @xmath55 . in that region",

    "therefore there is always a resonance at @xmath96 and its width is controlled by the magnitude of @xmath94 .",
    "conservation of angular momentum requires @xmath76 and @xmath80 to be spherically symmetric .",
