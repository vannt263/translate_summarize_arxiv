    "cryptography is a field of cryptography inclined towards efficient cryptographic implementations , as a response to the demands when using highly constrained hardware in low - cost devices , such as passive rfid - tags and smart cards .",
    "there are trade - offs to consider , e.g. , security , memory and performance .",
    "different constructions appear in different ends in the trade - offs ; for instance , aes and stream ciphers can be implemented efficiently in hardware but do not offer _",
    "provable security_. quite recently , a new trend arose in this area , building cryptographic primitives from problems in learning theory .",
    "problems based on learning theory provide a complexity theoretical foundation , on which the security of the cryptosystem can be based upon .",
    "they also have the property of being easy and efficiently implemented , thereby making them appealing in light - weight cryptography .",
    "being a central problem in learning theory , the lpn problem ( _ learning parity with noise _ ) has shown to be of significance in the field of cryptography .",
    "it is a supposedly hard problem - hard . ] , and is not known to be susceptible to quantum attacks , unlike some other classically hard problems such as factoring and the discrete log problem .",
    "the problem can briefly be described as follows .",
    "let @xmath1 be a @xmath2-dimensional binary vector .",
    "we receive a number @xmath3 of noisy versions of scalar products of @xmath1 from an oracle @xmath4 , and our task is to recover @xmath5 .",
    "let @xmath6 be a vector of length @xmath3 and let @xmath7 . for known random @xmath2 bit vectors @xmath8 , we can easily reconstruct an unknown @xmath9 from @xmath10 using linear algebra . in the lpn problem , however , we receive instead noisy versions of @xmath11 .    writing the noise in position @xmath12 as @xmath13 , and assuming each @xmath14 to be small , we obtain @xmath15 in matrix form ,",
    "the same is written as @xmath16 where @xmath17 , and the matrix @xmath18 is formed as @xmath19 .",

    "we now present numerical results of the improved partial key recovery attack on the authentication protocol lapin @xcite .",
    "the attack we describe concerns the instance of lapin using the degree @xmath20 polynomial @xmath21 and with the parameter @xmath22 . as claimed in @xcite , this given instance is designed to resist the best known attack on ring - lpn within the complexity @xmath23 .",
    "however , we have shown that it is possible to greatly improve the attack complexity .",
    "the improvements can be seen in table [ table : ring - lpn - parameterandsecurity ] .    for the distinguishing attack ,",
    "the complexity is only @xmath24 . for actual recovery of the secret polynomial",
    ", we need all five coordinates in the crt representation , which gives an upper bound on the security that is roughly @xmath25 . however , to solve this search problem , we describe a specified approach presented in the appendix that reduces the complexity to about @xmath26 .",
    "a comparison with previous algorithms is given in table [ table : ring - lpn - comparison ] in the introduction .",
    "we have proposed a new generic algorithm to solve the reducible case of ring - lpn . by exploiting the ring structure further ,",
    "our new algorithm is much more efficient than previous algorithms , enough to break the claimed 80-bit security for one of the two proposed instances of lapin .",
    "we have shown that a linear code arising from the crt transform characterizes the performance of this attack through its minimum distance .",
    "this is combined with some standard techniques of using birthday or possibly generalized birthday arguments and efficient recovery through fast walsh - hadamard transform .",
    "the low - weight property of the polynomials in the lapin case makes the problem considerably easier than otherwise and thus makes lapin susceptible to our attack .",
    "using really low - weight irreducible polynomials such as @xmath27 can give rise to linear relations with weight as low as 10 or even less .",
    "we have not seen that such polynomials have been pointed out as very weak before .",
    "the description of the new algorithm was influenced by the lapin case .",
    "there are more improvements that can be described in the general case .",
    "one such improvement is the use of a generalized birthday technique @xcite .",
    "this will allow us to consider larger dimensions at the cost of increasing the noise level .",
    "we have also noted that the simple bit - oriented samples in this paper can be replaced by more complicated vectorial samples , which will give a stronger bias .",
    "in this section , we describe the lapin two - round authentication protocol .",
    "let @xmath28/(f)$ ] be a ring and @xmath29 the set of units in @xmath30 .",
    "the protocol is defined over the ring @xmath30 .",
    "let @xmath31 be a mapping , chosen such that for all @xmath32 , @xmath33 if and only if @xmath34 .",
    "furthermore , let @xmath35 be a bernoulli distribution parameter and @xmath36 a threshold parameter .",
    "the elements @xmath30 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 are public parameters .",
    "the ring elements @xmath40 constitute the secret key .",
    "suppose that we have a key - generation oracle ; it will give us the key @xmath41 .",
    "the secret key is shared among the tag and the reader .",
    "protocol [ prot : ring - lpn - lapin ] gives how information is exchanged between the tag and the reader in lapin .",
    "in this section , we describe a better secret recovering approach on the instance proposed in lapin with a reducible polynomial .",
    "this attack exploits the secret polynomial s representations in the three relatively easy - attacked quotient rings @xmath42/(f_i ) , i = 1 , 2 , 3 $ ] , to decrypt those in rings @xmath42/(f_i ) , i = 4 , 5 $ ] , and thus obtains higher efficiency than simply attacking one ring by another .",
    "actually , it reduces the attacking complexity from @xmath25 to @xmath26 .",
    "we first recover the secret polynomials @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 in the corresponding smaller rings .",
    "this step costs around @xmath26 bit operations .",
    "then , using these known polynomials , we show that the secrets @xmath51 and @xmath52 can be recovered with negligible costs .",
    "the second step is transforming each ring - lpn sample to its corresponding standard lpn samples .",
    "this step will be tricky as we want to make use of the known information . since @xmath53 are distinct irreducible polynomials over @xmath42 $ ] , there exist polynomials @xmath54 such that @xmath55 and @xmath56 , where @xmath57 .",
    "moreover , these polynomials @xmath58 can be computed efficiently .",
    "then , for each sample ( @xmath59 ) , where @xmath60 , by adding the polynomial @xmath61 to @xmath62 , we create a new polynomial @xmath63 , which will be converted to a vector @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is the matrix whose @xmath12-th column is the coefficient vector of @xmath66 .",
    "the degree of @xmath51(@xmath52 ) is @xmath67(@xmath68 ) , thereby yielding that only the first @xmath67(@xmath68 ) columns of the matrix @xmath69 , denoted @xmath70 , are useful .",
    "we can compute those sub - matrices in @xmath71 bit operations for each ring - lpn sample , thereby economically constructing @xmath20 standard lpn samples @xmath72 for @xmath73 , where @xmath74 is the @xmath12-th row in the matrix @xmath75 .",
    "the last step is to attack a standard lpn problem with length @xmath76 and error probability @xmath77 . by levieil - fouque algorithm",
    ", the cost is small , i.e. , around @xmath78 bit operations .",
    "it requires @xmath79 standard lpn samples , i.e. @xmath80 ring - lpn ones .",
    "the number of samples in the second step is also bounded by that required in the final step ; the overall cost of the last two steps , therefore , is no more than @xmath81 bit operations , far less than that required in the starting step .",
    "thus , it is reasonable to embrace @xmath26 bit operations as the total attacking complexity .",
