    "current galaxy formation models can be very successful in predicting the general spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of galaxies at moderate redshifts by evolving stellar population models and co - adding a certain number of stellar populations with different ages .",
    "these models have become mainstream in obtaining stellar population properties ( like ages ) given current data . with them , constraints can be imposed on the formation times of old elliptical galaxies , the epoch of reionization and cosmology ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ".    however most stellar population models do not include the modelling of emission lines in galaxies .",
    "this is mainly due to the need for modelling the different phases present in the interstellar medium .",
    "some spectrophotometric codes such as pegase do include simple prescriptions for emission lines .",
    "other models such as starburst99 @xcite actually provide equivalent width and flux estimates for the most important emission lines usually observed in galaxy spectra .",
    "the broad band shape of the sed distribution can be related empirically to the presence of an emission line . roughly speaking ,",
    "we know that the emission line strength depends on the condition of the gas inside a galaxy ; this is strongly related to the amount of star formation ongoing in this galaxy ; the star formation can be inferred to a certain extent from the colour , i.e. we know that the sed of a star burst galaxy is much flatter than the corresponding sed of a more passively evolving red galaxy .",
    "therefore the shape of the sed must be correlated in some way to the presence of a strong emission feature in the same galaxy .",
    "we propose to find empirical correlations between the equivalent widths of different lines and the broad band colours from imaging data by utilising novel statistical methods .",
    "one method , artificial neural networks , is based on the annz code ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , previously used to predict photometric redshifts from galaxy colours .",
    "the second statistical method we explore here is locally weighted regression ( lwr ) .",
    "we can then use such correlations to understand better the process of galaxy formation and the conditions under which strong lines are produced .",
    "we suggest that with these statistical results , any model attempting to predict emission features in galaxy spectra could be considerably improved by being calibrated to have the same statistical properties as found in nature .",
    "another strong motivation for this work is the predictability of an emission feature present in high redshift galaxies .",
    "the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) and the 2df galaxy redshift survey ( 2dfgrs ) have probed the nearby universe .",
    "more current ( vvds and deep2 ) as well as future efforts will attempt to probe a large part of the high redshift universe .",
    "more specifically if one is only interested in redshift surveys and not on the more specific sed of a galaxy then it is important to minimize the amount of time spent looking for a galaxy redshift . the most efficient way of doing this is to perform redshift surveys targeted at emission line objects .",
    "if there is a possibility of predicting statistically which galaxies have strongest emission lines then the potential time spent locating all these galaxies in redshift space can be reduced and the scope for larger surveys increased in the same way .",
    "these approaches would be useful in particular for the forthcoming fmos survey @xcite and the planned wfmos survey .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in sec.[sec : data ] we present the data used to provide correlations found , we examine a low redshift sample ( sdss ) as well as a high redshift sample ( deep2 ) .",
    "section 3 presents the methodology used to extract the correlations from the data and describes the results found , we attempt to use lwr and annz for this purpose . in section 4 we present methodology for classification of agns and starforming galaxies .",
    "we comment on the prospects that this technique has in speeding up future redshift surveys in section 5 and conclude in section 6 .",
    "we also provide two short appendices describing the mathematics of the lwr and annz methods used .",
    "the low redshift data used in this work is a small sample taken from the sdss data release 2 @xcite .",
    "photometry is available for all galaxies in five optical bands ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 ) .",
    "we considered the same flux limited sample described in @xcite .",
    "this is a random sample of 20000 galaxies with reddening - corrected petrosian r - band magnitudes @xmath6 , and petrosian r - band half - light surface brightness @xmath7  mag  arcsec@xmath8 @xcite . as a quality cut",
    ", we selected only the objects that show a signal - to - noise ( s / n ) ratio greater than 5 in the @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 bands .",
    "we plot the redshift distribution of this sample in fig.[fig : nz ] .",
    "the sdss spectra used here cover the wavelength range @xmath9@xmath10  , and have a spectral resolution of @xmath11 .",
    "they were taken with the standard 3 arcsec diameter fibres in the sdss spectrograph .",
    "the spectra are first corrected for galactic extinction using the maps of @xcite and using the extinction law of @xcite .",
    "they are then brought to the rest frame and resampled from 3400 to 8900   in steps of 1   with a flux normalization by the median flux in the @xmath12@xmath13 region .",
    "these procedures are necessary to the spectral analysis described in section [ sec : lines ]      the data sample used at high redshift was the deep2 first data release @xcite .",
    "the deep project is an ongoing project , producing spectroscopy for targets at a redshift range @xmath14 .",
    "the surveys uses the deimos spectrograph @xcite on the keck ii telescope and aims to target around 40000 galaxies over 3 square degrees .",
    "the targets are pre - selected from imaging with b , r and i filters taken with the cfh12k camera on the canada - france - hawaii telescope ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "galaxies are imaged in @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 bands and selected to @xmath18 . furthermore",
    ", a colour - cut is applied to pre - select high - redshift objects above a redshift of @xmath19 and only @xmath20 3 per cent of galaxies above this redshift are rejected by the colour cut .",
    "the spectra are taken at moderately high resolution ( @xmath21 ) and span the range @xmath22   .",
    "hence the doublet @xmath233727 is found from @xmath24 .",
    "this sample contains 4681 objects and its redshift distribution is plotted in fig.[fig : nz ] .      in order to measure the emission lines from the sdss and deep2 galaxy spectra",
    "we have used a code to fit them as gaussian functions , composed of three parameters : width , offset ( with respect to the rest - frame central wavelength ) and flux . in the case of the sdss sample",
    ", we measured emission lines using the methods of described in detail by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the following emission lines have been measured : , h@xmath25 , , , h@xmath26 , and .@xmath233727 ,  for [ o  iii]@xmath235007 ,  for [ o  i]@xmath236300 , and  for [ n  ii]@xmath236584 . ]",
    "lines from the same ion are assumed to have the same width and offset , and we consider the following flux ratio constraints : @xmath27/@xmath28 and @xmath29/@xmath30 . to measure the intensities of emission lines we have to remove the stellar contribution in the continuum at their wavelength range , mainly to account for absorption features in the emission line regions .",
    "this is done by computing for each sdss galaxy a synthetic stellar spectrum obtained from a linear combination of simple stellar population spectra that fits the observed continuum in the whole spectral range ( after removal of the zones of emission lines and bad pixels ) .",
    "removing this synthetic spectrum from the observed one leaves us with a pure emission line residual spectrum from which we can easily measure the emission lines .",
    "this method provides a reliable estimate of the stellar absorption in the entire spectrum , including the windows where emission lines are found .",
    "this procedure is very important since the regions of some emission lines ( mainly the h@xmath26  and h@xmath25  balmer lines ) can be contaminated by strong absorption features which may reduce the equivalent width of the lines . for lines which have no absorption this should make no difference .",
    "we also have compared results with integrating over the spectrum and comparing it to the continuum and results do not change much showing that the method is robust .    for the deep2 data ,",
    "only the  line provided suitable measurements .",
    "moreover , we have adopted a distinct approach to measure this emission line . instead of fitting the continuum with a synthetic spectrum",
    "we have performed a polynomial fit of two continuum windows ( @xmath31@xmath32 and @xmath33@xmath34  ) around the line .",
    "the emission line was then measured from the continuum subtracted spectrum through the gaussian fitting procedure .",
    ", width=321 ]    it is well know that galaxy colours present a good correlation with the emission line properties of galaxies , such as their equivalent widths ( ew ) .",
    "we illustrate this in fig .",
    "2 , where the equivalent widths of emission lines measured from the sdss spectra are plotted as a function of various galaxy colours . several correlations can be identified between these quantities , as confirmed by the high values of the spearman rank correlation coefficients obtained for some of them , particularly those involving the h@xmath26  and h@xmath25emission lines .",
    "therefore , it is not only the 4000   break colour indice that encodes information about the emission features in galaxies ( e.g. mateus et al .",
    "2006 ) , as typical galaxy colours can also be used to infer these properties in a convenient manner , from photometric data only . on this basis , here we use different methods to combine all information available in the galaxy colours to produce an empirical relation between colours and emission strength .",
    "we have analyzed the data with two different techniques to reinforce the robustness of the correlations found and to compare the two techniques used .",
    "we have used artificial neural networks @xcite , as implemented in the publically available annz code ( collister & lahav 2004 and refereneces therein ) and a locally weighted regression ( lwr ) @xcite . see the appendices for the mathematical details and implementation of these methods .    both of the techniques we present here rely on a training set which is representative of the true population of galaxies in order to retrieve the information on the line features in each galaxy .",
    "we have separated the sample into two groups , one group which we have used to train the machine learning algorithms and a second sample which we will name the testing set which is set aside and then used to test the reliability of the methods .",
    "we have set aside 1100 galaxies in deep and 14000 galaxies in the sdss as testing sets .",
    "the rest of the sample was used as to train the algorithms , that is 2000 galaxies to train in the deep sample and 6000 galaxies to train in the sdss sample .",
    "for both methods used here we have to subdivide this sample into a training sample and a validation sample . in the case of neural networks this is done to prevent over - fitting . in the case of the lwr method , this is done to obtain the best kernel value k which is appropriate to the data . both prescriptions",
    "are explained in the appendix .",
    "the architecture of the neural network used is described in the appendix and is of the type n:2n:2n:1 where n is the number of magnitudes available which is three in the case of deep data and five in the case of sdss .    with the deep sample",
    "the only line which we have produced a fit for was the  line .",
    "we have performed this analysis only on this line because the deep survey relies heavily on the  line for redshift estimation , therefore having a high completeness .",
    "other lines do not appear in a large fraction of the galaxies in the entire sample .",
    "in the sample from sdss we performed this analysis for all measured lines : , h@xmath25 , , , h@xmath26 , and .",
    "we plot in fig.[fig::deep _ ew ] our attempts to recover the equivalent width of the  line in the deep survey using broad band photometry only .",
    "we have plotted a scatter plot of the real equivalent width versus the predicted equivalent width for the testing set given the training set . as we can see the logarithm of the equivalent width",
    "is predicted reasonably well and show that this weak correlation can be inferred very well with the techniques we have proposed here .",
    "we can predict the log of the equivalent width with an error of 0.27 without any spectroscopic information on the redshift of each galaxy .",
    "we present in fig.[fig::scatter ] the results we find by fitting different line widths to sdss galaxies . again in these plots we have used only galaxies in the testing set which have not been used in the training process .",
    "we find that some line equivalent widths are relatively well predicted by galaxy magnitudes and colours .",
    "this is the case for the hydrogen lines where a reasonably strong correlation was found .",
    "we have found however that the collisional lines observed are harder to predict .",
    "for instance the  line equivalent width had virtually no correlation with any combination of the colours and magnitudes found .",
    "we compare results for both of the techniques using the same testing sets in fig.[fig::scatter ] .",
    "we plot them side by side so that we can see the relative comparison between the neural network non - linear fit to the data and the locally linear regression used .",
    "we have inspected the data and found that there was no significant difference between both methods .",
    "both predictions have yielded results with a very similar scatter given the data volume available .",
    "we conclude that for fitting purposes neural networks and a locally weighted regression performs well and on an equal footing .",
    "we have also attempted to simply classify objects into line - emitting and non line - emitting .",
    "we have made this separation for each galaxy upon the simple criterium : whether an emission line is detected above a certain value .",
    "this separation has been done for each line emission analyzed .",
    "for instance if a certain galaxy has an  line but does not posses an h@xmath26 line then it is considered as an emitting object for the purpose of the analysis on the  line but it is considered as a non - emitting object for the purposes of the h@xmath26 line analysis .",
    "results we can also see that our methods go further than simply detecting this bi - modality clearly separating objects with high and low equivalent width .

    "when a neural network is trained by binary values between zero and one , it returns a probability ( e.g. lahav et al . 1996 and refereces therin ) of that given object belonging to the class described by the binary number .",
    "so in our case the value returned by the neural network will be the probability of that object having the emission feature tested for .",
    "we have also attempted to perform the same analysis with the lwr technique but found that despite the lwr technique producing predictive results which are comparable and as good as the neural network fit it was not able to perform this classification task nearly as well as the neural networks .",
    "this was to be expected as the lwr method is not directly applicable to classification tasks .",
    "this is because the linear fit results are not representative of a probability range in the same way the neural networks are .",
    "we plot these results in fig.[fig::counter ] .",
    "we can see that the results are varied and depend on the emission line being assessed .",
    "for instance there is a good prospect of training a neural network to distinguish between hydrogen emitters and  emitters at low redshift but on the other hand the  line exhibits a very poor correlation between colours and magnitudes and its ew .",
    "the other oxygen lines exhibit some correlation that are picked up by our methods .    in order to have an idea of what contamination",
    "would be introduced but performing a selection based on the predicted equivalent width of a galaxy with our method , we have plotted histograms for the entire sample and then chosen the center of the distribution of the equivalent widths in log space .",
    "we have then plotted the histograms for the samples with high predicted equivalent width and low predicted equivalent width in fig.[fig::hist ] .    while predicting the equivalent widths for these emission lines we have found the already known result of galaxy bi - modality .",
    "we know that galaxies are bimodal and that late type galaxies have higher star formation rates and therefore stronger emission features whereas the opposite is true for late type galaxies .",
    "we can see this bi - modality in the histogram of the equivalent widths for the different lines in fig.[fig::hist ] .",
    "this is not found on every set of lines because there are selection effects ( fainter lines are simply not seen in some galaxies ) .",
    "for instance the ratio of the h@xmath26 and h@xmath25 lines for a single galaxy should be roughly constant just below three .",
    "this is because both lines are recombination lines and the temperature dependence of the emissivity is roughly the same for both lines .",
    "however we do not find this bimodality for h@xmath25 but we find it for h@xmath26 .",
    "this is simply because the h@xmath25 flux is smaller and this makes so that a lot of the fainter lines remain undetected .",
    "furthermore we argue that the correlations found in h@xmath25 are strong which suggests that the method we are using is going beyond simply separating the bi - modality and is classifying the line widths according to their size .",
    "we adopted a traditional procedure to classify galaxies according to their emission line properties . by examining diagnostic diagrams formed by line ratios of optical emission lines , such as the /h@xmath25 versus /h@xmath26 diagram proposed by @xcite",
    ", we can distinguish emission - line galaxies according to the mechanism responsible for producing the lines .",
    "in such diagrams , hosts of active nuclei ( agn ) and star - forming galaxies form two very distinct branches , or wings , making easier the task to separate them .",
    "we use this ` convenient ' diagram to classify galaxies following the classification scheme discussed in @xcite based on a theoretical curve used to distinguish galaxies with pure star - formation from those objects with some contribution from nuclear activity to the line intensities .",
    "galaxies below such a curve are classified as normal star - forming galaxies ( sf ) .",
    "in addition , we have also used the empirical curve proposed by @xcite to identify the agn hosts .",
    "galaxies between the two curves are hybrid objects ( the contribution of the agn to the h@xmath25emission of galaxies below the kauffmann et al .",
    "line is at most 3 per cent ) and therefore will not be included in our analysis .",
    "the agn hosts are then selected as those objects located above the kauffmann et al . empirical curve .    .",
    "as we can see it is possible to predict agn features from broad band photometry well .",
    "there is a degeneracy between the colours of many passive galaxies and star forming ones but it is in general possible to classify them with colours only . as expected hybrid objects lie on the line between agn and sf galaxies .",
    "[ fig::agn],width=359 ]      in this subsection we attempt to classify the spectral features instead of simply predicting the equivalent width of lines .",
    "we have described in sec.[sec : class ] how we separate galaxies with emission features into agn or star forming ( sf ) galaxies .",
    "we have separated the 20000 sdss galaxies we used in this paper into the following classes : passive galaxies , agn , star forming galaxies and hybrid objects .",
    "some objects were not classified by the code analysing the spectroscopic data and we have removed those galaxies . we have associated a doublet @xmath35 to each one of these categories in the following way : passive galaxies ( 0,0 ) , agn ( 1,0 ) , sf galaxies ( 0,1 ) and hybrid objects ( 0.5,0.5 ) .    we have then used a neural network with 5 input nodes , 2 hidden layers with 10 nodes in each layer and 2 output nodes to classify galaxies into agn , passive galaxies and sf galaxies according to the doublets assigned above .",
    "we have used only photometry to perform the training .",
    "we used 5000 galaxies for training and 3000 for validating the network .",
    "the remaining galaxies were plotted as a testing set in fig.[fig::agn ] .",
    "the network returned a doublet for each galaxy . for visual reasons ,",
    "we plot the doublets in the following basis @xmath36 , so that the labels agn , sf galaxies and passive galaxies are on the corners of an equilateral triangle .    as we can see from fig.[fig::agn ] , there is a trend on the distribution of points in this @xmath35 diagram .",
    "the distribution does not infer a transition between passive galaxies to sf galaxies to agn .",
    "it indicates that the colour data is able to make a good distinction between passive galaxies and agn , there is a relativelly good distinction between agn and sf galaxies and a certain overlap between passive and sf galaxies , which we had already found attempting to classify galaxies in the previous section .",
    "this offers an alternative to classifying objects photometrically as agn or star forming galaxies via a training set and broadband photometry only .",
    "we have shown that it is possible to predict emission features using broad band photometry .",
    "we find that the correlations vary in strength from line to line .",
    "particularly recombination lines are more predictable than collisional lines .",
    "we have not included any information on the shape or size of the galaxies .",
    "we expect that the results found here would be stronger if information such as shapelet coefficients for galaxies is included into the analysis as we know that galaxies with different star formation rates and therefore different line strengths have different morphologies .",
    "we argue that this technique can be used in future spectroscopic redshift surveys to speed them up .",
    "future facilities such as fmos or wfmos will produce spectroscopic surveys in the optical and the ir part of the spectrum targeting mainly the  and the h@xmath26 lines .",
    "we have shown here that there is a reasonable predictability of the  line at high redshift and that the h@xmath26 and h@xmath25 line are well predicted in the low redshift universe .",
    "a high redshift complete sample of around 10000 objects could be used to train a network to then select the preferred targets .    if one chooses to predict the line strengths one alternative would be to fit stellar population synthesis models to the observed spectrum and from that infer a star formation rate and therefore a line flux .",
    "we argue that the technique we have proposed here is complementary and one would be able to encode information on the morphology of the galaxy easily whereas if one fits stellar population models to the training data it would be hard to include special information in the analysis .",
    "we have looked , in this paper , for empirical relations between the equivalent width for several different lines and the broad band colours for the same objects .",
    "we used an automated way to explore the correlations found in the data via the use of lwr and ann .",
    "the two methods give very similar results .",
    "we have performed the analysis in two samples , a low redshift sample obtained from the sloan digital sky survey covering the nearby universe and a high redshift sample from the first data release of the deep survey covering a deeper sample off the universe .",
    "we found that in the deep data one could predict the equivalent width of the  line relatively well by looking at broad band colours only . with the sdss data six lines",
    "were predicted from a training set sample . in general collisional lines presented little correlation although some of them were reasonably predicted by the colours .",
    "there was a stronger correlation found in recombination lines .",
    "we have compared the power of prediction of both methods used .",
    "we have concluded that both artificial neural networks and the locally weighted regression methods are capable of recovering most of the information encoded in the training set with little statistical difference between both methods .",
    "we have used both methods for classification purposes and found that the neural networks are capable of classifying the objects into line - emitting and non line - emitting but that the locally weighted regression method was unable to do so .",
    "we have shown that it is possible to classify galaxies into agn , passive galaxies and line emitting galaxies well without galaxy spectra , using solely colours and a training set of the order of 15000 galaxies .",
    "we have discussed the prospects of speeding up redshift surveys with this and we conclude that with a reasonable training set of the order of 10000 galaxies one would be able to considerably speed up future surveys done with instruments such as fmos and wfmos . furthermore , in this paper we have only taken advantage of the colour data ; however the methods described can accommodate very easily other information such as morphology or size .",
