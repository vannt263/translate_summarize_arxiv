    "cosmic shear , the weak gravitational lensing effect by the large - scale structure of the universe , will be one of the primary probes in most of the forthcoming cosmological galaxy surveys , including kids , des , hsc , lsst , and _ _ euclid _ _ @xcite .",
    "the correlations of the distortions of distant galaxy images induced by the continuous deflection of their light by the matter distribution along the line of sight are sensitive to both the evolution of structure and the geometry of the cosmos , so that cosmic shear can provide excellent constraints on dark matter , dark energy , and potential deviations from general relativity @xcite .",
    "precision measurements of cosmological parameters need to be matched by an equally superb control of systematic errors .",
    "in particular , weak lensing surveys will have to undertake major efforts to control their dominant astrophysical contamination , the intrinsic alignment of galaxy shapes , which mimics the correlations induced by gravitational lensing .    to date ,",
    "the knowledge about intrinsic alignments is limited , and virtually non - existent at the typical redshifts of galaxy samples used for weak lensing analyses around @xmath5 , and at small , non - linear scales from where the majority of cosmological constraints originates ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "hence several methods have been designed to remove or calibrate the intrinsic alignment signal with minimal assumptions about the form of the intrinsic correlations ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "while most of these approaches constitute valuable consistency checks , it is likely that none is capable of controlling the intrinsic alignment contamination without a significant loss of statistical power of the survey , unless prior constraints on the systematic are available .",
    "therefore a robust and comprehensive model for intrinsic galaxy alignments is paramount to allow for the optimal exploitation of the future rich weak lensing data sets .",
    "even the design of surveys would profit from an improved understanding of intrinsic alignments which , for instance , are the main driver for the requirements on the accuracy of galaxy redshift measurements @xcite .",
    "moreover , intrinsic alignments potentially constitute an interesting astrophysical signal that probes the dependence of galaxy formation and evolution on environment , and that is complementary to established techniques .",
    "this calls for an intrinsic alignment model that can explain e.g. their dependence on redshift , environment , merger history , and physical properties of galaxies .",
    "the classical  picture of how galaxies acquire certain shapes assumes a dichotomy between spiral and elliptical galaxies .",
    "the shapes of the former are determined by their disc whose rotation axis is aligned with the halo angular momentum , which in turn was created via tidal torquing during the assembly of the galaxy @xcite . as the resulting angular momentum scales with the square of the quadrupole of the gravitational potential , one expects the correlations between the angular momenta and hence the projected shapes of spiral galaxies to vanish to first order @xcite .",
    "the shapes of elliptical galaxies are assumed to follow the generally triaxial shape of their haloes which are subjected to tidal stretching by the surrounding large - scale matter distribution .",
    "the projected ellipticity of the galaxy is then proportional to the quadrupole of the gravitational potential , leading to the linear alignment model for early - type galaxies @xcite .",
    "even if these simple prescriptions prove to be valid for correlations at large galaxy separation , one expects modifications on small scales where non - linear structure evolution , baryonic physics , and dynamical processes in high - density regions become relevant .",
    "one way forward is to incorporate the alignments of satellite galaxies in a halo model @xcite , which predicts similar correlations as an earlier empirical ansatz by @xcite to employ the full non - linear power spectrum in the linear alignment model .",
    "the predictions of intrinsic alignments by the tidal torque and tidal stretching paradigms are consistent with current observations , which however are still fraught with relatively large uncertainties .",
    "measurements among late - type galaxies in the sdss main samples @xcite and the overlap region between the sdss and wigglez surveys @xcite have not yielded any significant detection , except at very low redshift @xcite .    in contrast , correlations between intrinsic shapes as well as the alignment of intrinsic shapes towards overdensities of early - type galaxies have been robustly detected in several data sets out to redshift 0.7 ( @xcite ; see also @xcite for a detection in cosmic shear data ) .",
    "the observed correlation functions are in agreement with the galaxy separation and redshift dependencies predicted by the linear alignment model and its non - linear modifications ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ) , featuring in addition a clear increase in amplitude with galaxy luminosity @xcite .    concerning small scales , observations of satellite galaxy shape alignment towards the centre of clusters reach back to @xcite .",
    "recent results range between weakly significant radial alignment of satellites @xcite and non - detection of anisotropy in the orientations @xcite , with uncertain levels of selection effects and systematic errors .",
    "a successful model of intrinsic galaxy shapes has to fit large - scale correlations of galaxy ellipticities , small - scale satellite alignment , as well as the distribution of galaxy ellipticities simultaneously . in @xcite , paper i",
    "hereafter , dark matter halo properties from the millennium simulation were combined with semi - analytic models of galaxy evolution and analytic models for the link between the shape of galaxies and their underlying halo .",
    "the resulting shape models were confronted with one - point statistics and distributions of galaxy ellipticities measured in the cosmos survey .    in this work",
    "we continue to follow this ansatz of semi - analytic  galaxy shape modelling , now investigating the two - point statistics of ellipticities .",
    "the millennium simulation @xcite is well suited to build our galaxy shape models because it has a sufficiently large volume to allow for measurements of correlations among widely separated galaxies , combined with good mass resolution for accurate halo shape and angular momentum measurements ( cf .",
    "@xcite who use a similar approach but rely on simulations that have 20 times higher particle mass ) .",
    "numerous publications ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have investigated the correlations of dark matter halo ellipticities and angular momenta with each other , and with the large - scale matter distribution , in n - body simulations . to enable an accurate selection of galaxy samples for comparison with observations , we supplement this information with multi - band photometry and galaxy type classifications from the semi - analytic models of galaxy formation and evolution by @xcite .    to incorporate the critical link between the shape of the visible , baryonic matter and the structure of the underlying dark matter distribution , we make use of the statistical properties of this relation extracted from a large number of small - scale , high - resolution hydrodynamic simulations by @xcite . furthermore , as the millennium data includes the positions of satellite galaxies , but not the shapes of the corresponding subhaloes , we resort to simple models of satellite shapes and alignments , based on the high - resolution simulations by @xcite whose findings are qualitatively in agreement with similar investigations by @xcite .",

    "the impact of the best - matching intrinsic alignment model on weak lensing surveys is studied in section@xmath6[sec : impact ] . in section@xmath6[sec : conclusions ] we summarise and conclude on our findings .    unless stated otherwise , rest - frame magnitudes are @xmath7-corrected to @xmath0 and computed assuming the cosmology of the millennium simulation ( see below ) except a hubble constant @xmath8 with @xmath9 .",
    "magnitudes extracted from the millennium database are given in the vega system , while all observations use the ab system .",
    "if direct comparison is necessary , we resort to the conversion tables of @xcite . when multiple data sets with error bars are plotted , points are slightly offset horizontally for clarity throughout .",
    "in this section we briefly summarise the key aspects of the simulations that we use .",
    "more details are provided in section@xmath62 of paper i. the basis of our galaxy shape models is the millennium simulation @xcite which provides us both with the volume ( comoving box size @xmath10 ) to measure correlations on cosmological scales and with the mass resolution ( particle mass @xmath11 ) needed to determine the properties of galaxy - sized dark matter haloes accurately .",
    "we will work with the 32 snapshot outputs from @xmath12 to @xmath0 .",
    "the cosmology of the millennium simulation follows a spatially flat @xmath13cdm model with matter density parameter @xmath14 .",
    "the baryon density parameter is @xmath15 , the hubble parameter @xmath16 , the power - law index of the initial power spectrum @xmath17 , and the normalisation of the power of matter fluctuations @xmath18 .",
    "this latter value is high compared to recent observational constraints suggesting @xmath19 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but the impact of @xmath20 on the strength of intrinsic galaxy correlations is unknown at present ( see paper i for a discussion on the expected effects of high @xmath20 as well as of baryons on intrinsic alignments ) .",
    "we will compare the simulation - based intrinsic alignment signals directly to observations , thereby assuming that the high value of @xmath20 does not affect our results significantly .",
    "note however that , when calculating the importance of intrinsic alignments relative to cosmic shear correlations , we will use @xmath18 also for the latter to be consistent .",
    "models of galaxies were placed into the millennium haloes via the semi - analytic galaxy evolution model ` galform ` in the version of @xcite . from these models we extract apparent and rest - frame magnitudes in various bands as well as the distinction between central and satellite galaxies , where",
    "the former are defined as the galaxy in the most massive substructure of a halo at any given time .",
    "moreover , we adopt the classification of galaxy morphologies via the bulge - to - total ratio of @xmath21-band luminosity , @xmath22 , as proposed by @xcite .",
    "we define our early - type  galaxy sample via @xmath23 and the late - type  sample accordingly by @xmath24 .",
    "the latter comprises spiral and lenticular galaxies , the cut at @xmath25 being motivated by the strikingly different merger histories of these populations ( see * ? ? ?",
    "ray - tracing is employed to compute the gravitational shear at the positions of dark matter haloes , generated by the light deflection of the matter distribution along the line of sight .",
    "the method is detailed in @xcite and provides us with 64 light cones with an area of @xmath26 each , yielding a mock survey of @xmath27 out to a redshift of @xmath12 .",
    "special care has been taken to avoid that parts of dark matter haloes end up on different lens planes which in the context of this paper could e.g. create artificial alignments of close halo / galaxy pairs .",
    "all vectorial quantities such as satellite positions , shape ellipsoid major axes , or angular momenta are transformed into a coordinate system with the line of sight as one basis vector , which facilitates projection onto the plane of the sky .",
    "in the following we provide a synopsis of the various shape models which we investigate . here",
    "we will focus on the alignment properties , while the assignment of galaxy shapes has been laid out in detail in section@xmath63 of paper i. generally , we divide the galaxy sample into central and satellite galaxies , as identified by the semi - analytic models , and further distinguish between early- and late - type galaxies based on the bulge - to - total luminosity , @xmath28 .",
    "an overview on the model variants used and their naming conventions is given in table  [ tab : galaxymodels ] .    [ cols=\"<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : galaxymodels ]      we base our models of galaxy shapes on the morphologies and angular momenta of the underlying dark matter haloes .",
    "the same approach as in @xcite is used to identify bound structures in the matter distribution of the simulation and to compute the shapes and angular momenta of haloes .",
    "a friends - of - friends algorithm is employed to construct groups of simulation particles within which self - bound structures are detected with the ` subfind ` code @xcite .",
    "a halo is then defined as a collection of self - bound sub - haloes .",
    "a halo shape is computed via the quadrupole tensor of the mass distribution @xmath29 with components @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the number of all particles that belong to the halo , and where @xmath32 denotes the position vector of particle @xmath33 with respect to the halo centre ( defined as the location of the gravitational potential minimum ) .",
    "the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of @xmath29 define an ellipsoid , with the eigenvalues per unit mass giving the square of the semi - axis lengths , and the corresponding eigenvectors specifying the axis orientations .",
    "we interpret this ellipsoid as an approximation to the shape of the halo .",
    "our input catalogues contain all haloes in the millennium database that host a galaxy , with particle numbers down to 20 . in paper",
    "i it was demonstrated that a minimum particle number of @xmath34 is required to measure halo shapes and orientations accurately , i.e. to have less than @xmath35 deviation of the measured axis ratios from the truth , and less than @xmath36degrees uncertainty in the direction of the largest eigenvector ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "sparsely sampled haloes tend to produce smaller axis ratios ( and hence larger ellipticity on average ) as well as rapidly increasing uncertainty in the halo orientation , leading to an underestimation of ellipticity correlations @xcite .",
    "the minimum requirement can be relaxed to @xmath37 when accepting @xmath38 deviation of the measured axis ratios and @xmath39degrees deviation of the measured orientation of the largest eigenvector .",
    "since @xmath40 is a restrictive condition that would discard more than half of the haloes identified in the millennium simulation , we will adopt this less stringent limit when comparing the simulation intrinsic alignment signals to data and when predicting ii and gi signals , but keep to a minimum particle number of 300 for the investigation of dependencies in the simulation of intrinsic alignment correlations in section@xmath6[sec : simresults ] .",
    "furthermore we make use of the @xcite calculations of the specific angular momentum of haloes within the virial radius , restricted to @xmath40 .",
    "we find that shape models based on the halo angular momentum have negligible correlations for halo masses slightly above @xmath41 ( see section@xmath6[sec : simresults ] ) , so that the absence of angular momentum information for low - mass haloes should not affect our results .",
    "we test whether our results depend on the radius within which the angular momentum is calculated . to this end",
    ", we calculate correlations between the normalised angular momenta of massive haloes with at least 300 particles within @xmath42",
    ". however , the correlations in orientation resulting from computing @xmath43 within @xmath42 and within @xmath44 do not show significant deviations beyond the error bars computed from field - to - field variance .",
    "all central galaxies with @xmath45 and in haloes with more than 100 particles are assumed to have the same three - dimensional shape as their host haloes .",
    "the complex galaxy ellipticity ( in projection ) is computed from the symmetric tensor @xmath46 as defined in section 3.1 of paper i via , as opposed to the polarisation @xmath47 which was employed in paper i. the two quantities are related via @xmath48 @xcite . ]",
    "@xmath49    a frequently used alternative is to base the shape of elliptical galaxies on the reduced inertia tensor of the halo , arguably producing a better approximation of the shape of the galaxy residing close to the halo centre as it gives more weight to small radii . to model the impact of switching from the simple inertia tensor of equation ( [ eq : massquadrupole ] ) to the reduced one , we devise models for which we increase the halo semi - axis ratios by about @xmath50 , thereby approximating the results of @xcite .",
    "early - type models are denoted by ` est ` if based on the simple inertia tensor , and by ` ert ` if based on the reduced inertia tensor .",
    "additionally we construct a model named ` ema ` which is based on the simple inertia tensor and includes a random misalignment of halo major axes .",
    "the misalignment angles are drawn from a gaussian distribution with a scatter of @xmath51 , as proposed by @xcite who obtained this scatter by matching the intrinsic ellipticity correlations of an sdss lrg sample to halo shape correlations extracted from n - body simulations .    since ellipticity correlations among early - type galaxies , whose haloes have @xmath52 and thus no measured halo shape , are expected to be small ( see also section@xmath6[sec : simresults ] ) , it is safe to assume that these galaxies have random orientations .",
    "we make the further assumption that the statistical halo shape properties of galaxies with @xmath52 are the same as those of more massive galaxies . in each redshift slice",
    "we construct two - dimensional histograms of halo axis ratios and assign randomly sampled shapes from these histograms to low - mass galaxies at the same redshift .",
    "all central galaxies with @xmath40 and @xmath53 are modelled as circular thick discs whose orientation is determined by the angular momentum vector @xmath54 of the underlying halo .",
    "the ellipticity of the galaxy image is determined analogously to the procedure outlined in paper i , except that , due to the different definition of ellipticity , paper i , equation ( 6 ) is modified to @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the polar angle of the image ellipse .",
    "the axis ratio of the ellipse reads @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the ratio of disc thickness to disc diameter , i.e. approximately the axis ratio for a galaxy viewed edge - on .",
    "we explore two values of this parameter : @xmath59 , similar to what is expected for the disc of e.g. the milky way ( models denoted by ` sth ` ) , and @xmath60 , designed to include the effect of bulges ( models denoted by ` sal ` ) and motivated by the observations of @xcite .    like in the case of the early - type galaxy shape model",
    ", the projection implicitly assumes that the three - dimensional light distribution is uniform with a sharp cut - off at the perimeter .",
    "we refrain from using more complicated schemes involving a realistic radial light distribution as this could imply variable ellipticity as a function of radius .",
    "moreover we neglect any small deviations of the image from an elliptical shape in the projection of discs .",
    "re - simulations of dark matter haloes with high resolution and including baryonic particles modelled in different ways indicate that galaxy discs are not perfectly aligned with the halo angular momentum .",
    "@xcite collected the misalignment results from over 500 haloes simulated with baryons and galaxy formation physics ( from @xcite and @xcite , using the simulations of @xcite and @xcite respectively ) , as well as 95 haloes without baryons ( also from @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite found that the polar misalignment angles @xmath61 between angular momentum vector and disc rotation axis can be jointly described by the distribution @xmath62 with @xmath63 .",

    "the galaxy disc is then constructed perpendicular to @xmath67 .",
    "note that @xcite used a similar prescription for late - type galaxy models .",
    "disc thickness is accounted for by rescaling ellipticities as @xmath70 , which in the edge - on limit corresponds to an axis ratio of 0.16 , hence lying in - between the models for @xmath58 that we consider .",
    "misalignment angles between angular momentum vector and rotation axis were extracted from the simulations by @xcite .",
    "the set of simulations studied in @xcite is superior in number of galaxy / halo systems and resolution , although both agree on a median misalignment of the order @xmath71degrees .",
    "the fit to the distribution of @xmath61 suggested by @xcite appears to be more accurate in particular for large misalignments than the truncated gaussian proposed by @xcite .",
    "this misalignment prescription is implemented for disc models with @xmath60 , denoted as ` sma ` .",
    "analogous to low - mass early - type galaxies , late - type galaxies with @xmath72 that have no angular momentum information are modelled as randomly oriented thick discs , where @xmath58 has the same value as the model used for the corresponding model of central late - type galaxies with @xmath40 .      for galaxies residing in the substructures of haloes we do not have information about the properties of their dark matter distribution .",
    "therefore we have to rely on external data to model both the shapes and orientations of satellite galaxies .    for early - type satellites",
    "we proceed in analogy to the central galaxies with @xmath73 and sample the axis ratios of three - dimensional ellipsoids from the histograms obtained for massive haloes with shape information at each redshift slice ( model ` est ` ) .",
    "optionally these axis ratios are rescaled to mimic the use of the reduced inertia tensor ( model ` ert ` ) .",
    "the ellipsoids are then oriented to point their major axis towards the central galaxy of the halo and subsequently projected along the line of sight using equation ( [ eq : ellipseprojection3 ] ) to yield image ellipticities .",
    "the radial alignment of satellite galaxies towards the centre of the halo is strongly supported by simulations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ) and has also been detected in galaxy clusters ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although the statistical significance is still low and detections are plagued by systematic effects ( see * ? ? ?",
    "simulation results indicate that tidal torquing is the cause for satellite alignment @xcite .",
    "the perfect radial alignment that we assume by default is to be understood as an upper limit for the satellite ellipticity correlation signal .    as an alternative model",
    "we implement the modifications of shapes and orientations of subhaloes found by @xcite in high - resolution dark matter - only simulations ( knebe08 model hereafter ; identifier ` ekn ` ) .",
    "the corresponding modifications to halo shapes are detailed in paper i , section 3.3 .",

    "similar to their central counterparts , late - type satellite galaxies are assumed to be thick circular discs perpendicular to the angular momentum vector of the halo , where we place the angular momentum vector at an arbitrary pointing perpendicular to the line connecting the position of the satellite with the centre of the halo .",
    "this means that a satellite disc galaxy viewed edge - on points  towards the centre of a halo .",
    "otherwise we explore the same model variants as for central late - type galaxies , i.e. the two values of @xmath58 ( models ` sth ` and ` sal ` for @xmath59 and @xmath60 respectively ) and the optional misalignment of the angular momentum vector from its default direction according to @xcite , which in this case is equivalent to the misalignment of the position vector of the satellite with the major axis of the projected image of an inclined disc ( model ` sma ` ) .",
    "we begin our analysis by studying galaxy shape correlations and their trends with various galaxy properties , separated into early types ( i.e. based on halo shapes ) and late types ( i.e. based on halo angular momenta ) . here",

    "could potentially provide another test of our models , but applying the corresponding selection criteria to the simulated catalogues produces only a few hundred galaxies per line of sight , so that any results would be inconclusive due to large error bars .",
    "a selection based on a colour - magnitude diagram as for the wigglez samples is problematic as @xcite split the population by observed rather than rest - frame magnitude which leads to an uncertain yet significant contamination of the blue sample by early - type galaxies ( see the discussions in @xcite and @xcite ) .",

    "this should be more effective at selecting galaxies with particularly low ( or high ) @xmath274 and will be investigated in future work .    note that here we only suggested to make the sample selection in different filters . when also performing the shape measurement at different wavelengths , different structures within the galaxies dominate the light distribution , and thus the alignment properties may change as well .",
    "we can not investigate this effect with our simple analytic models , but the forthcoming multi - band surveys will shed more light on its significance . ultimately , the intrinsic alignment contamination may become a major reason to perform weak lensing studies in a completely different part of the electromagnetic spectrum ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "b - modes generated by intrinsic ellipticity correlations seem to be affected by spurious contributions , so that we can only set an upper limit of @xmath326 . a potential exception is the ii b - mode signal at @xmath339 , which attains similar amplitudes as the corresponding e - mode .",
    "such signals could serve as an independent complement to e - modes to constrain intrinsic alignment models .",
    "future analysis of highly accurate simulations with very good mass and spatial resolution is needed to firmly establish whether intrinsic alignments leave a clear signature in the b - mode , especially at high redshift .",
    "a semi - analytic approach to galaxy shape modelling as proposed here , or alternatively an advanced halo model ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , has the major advantage of jointly predicting various shape and clustering statistics for a wide range of galaxy samples .",
    "such models readily combine constraints from large and small scales and include realistic galaxy bias , allowing access to the deeply non - linear regime and thus enabling two - point analyses of small - scale surveys such as cosmos .    although the shape models employed in this work are still simplistic and involve strong assumptions , the actual major concern is the lack of observational constraints . to date , there are essentially no informative intrinsic alignment measurements for blue , under - luminous galaxies which , however , are the main constituents of galaxy samples used for weak lensing .",
    "furthermore the amplitude of intrinsic alignments at redshifts of order unity and beyond is currently unknown although the majority of galaxies in forthcoming weak lensing surveys will populate this regime .",
    "future observations need to improve statistical constraints and extend them closer to the depths of weak lensing studies .",
    "this is a challenging task as both accurate galaxy shape measurements and redshift estimates have to be available , as e.g. in the overlap regions of imaging and spectroscopic redshift surveys . reducing shot noise and",
    "sample variance sets tight requirements on number density , area coverage , and survey geometry for the galaxy sample to be studied . since a critical ingredient is a redshift estimate for every galaxy which is accurate to roughly the per - cent level , multi - band photometric surveys like pau , or low - resolution spectroscopy as performed by primus @xcite , targeted at weak lensing surveys , are a promising strategy .",
    "the _ euclid _ mission not only sets the highest requirements on the control of intrinsic alignments , but also provides data ideally suited for their calibration , with unprecedented constraints expected on emission - line galaxies from the spectroscopic survey , and the opportunity of directly measuring the intrinsic alignment signal on the weak lensing sample thanks to the highly accurate photometric redshifts supplied by the deep survey @xcite .",
    "next steps in the simulation - based modelling of galaxy shapes include the usage of a hierarchical suite of n - body simulations which will provide the cosmological volume to improve on statistical power , as well as the mass resolution to determine robust halo properties of low - mass and satellite galaxies .",
    "semi - analytical models that simultaneously determine the photometry and the morphology , based on halo properties and merger history , will establish a more realistic link between the shape of a galaxy and its luminosity and colours , thereby allowing us to examine the efficiency of suppressing the contamination by intrinsic alignments via colour cuts on the galaxy sample .",
    "the results of the hydrodynamic simulations performed by @xcite challenge the paradigm that the different evolution of disc and spheroidal galaxies is caused by the details of the merger history .",
    "they found that the difference between late and early galaxy types can rather be associated with the infall directions and thermo - dynamic state of the accreted gas .",
    "similarly , @xcite concluded from their suite of hydrodynamic simulations that the angular momentum of galactic gas is larger than that of the dark matter halo , and closely linked to the surrounding large - scale structure .",
    "these recent findings question the choice of analytic models of galaxy shapes that are directly derived from halo properties , as taken in this paper .",
    "however , the proposed scenarios are likely to produce distinctively different predictions for e.g. the radial dependence ( due to a stronger link of angular momentum with filamentary structures ) and the evolution ( due to a stronger correlation with gas infall events than with mergers ) of intrinsic alignments , and hence can be put to the test by comparison to intrinsic alignment observations in analogy to our approach .    once hydro - dynamic simulations can be run on cosmologically relevant scales with sufficient resolution",
    ", one can by - pass the critical assumptions about the link between the shapes of dark and luminous matter and directly create mock galaxy images on which a standard shape measurement code can then be run .",
    "there would still be critical assumptions involved , most prominently about the sub - grid physics of baryons in the simulation .",
    "for instance , a strong dependence on feedback models , as seen for weak lensing power spectra @xcite , is also expected for intrinsic alignment signals .",
    "however , these issues would be shared with the models of galaxy evolution and of cosmological probes , and hence allow for intrinsic alignments to be integrated smoothly into a wider cosmological context .",
