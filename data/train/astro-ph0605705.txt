    "the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss )  @xcite is an imaging and spectroscopic survey that has now mapped over @xmath7 of the sky .",
    "it has already proven to be a powerful tool for the identification of galactic substructure .",
    "for example , @xcite and @xcite identified a ring at low galactic latitude , often called `` the monoceros ring '' .",
    "it spans over 100@xmath8 in the sky  ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but its progenitor remains unclear  @xcite .",
    "@xcite used sdss data to find the spectacular 10@xmath8 tidal tails around the sparse and disrupting galactic globular cluster pal 5 .",
    "more recently still , @xcite found @xmath9 tails around the high - latitude globular cluster ngc 5466 , while @xcite discovered a @xmath10 tail that presumably arises from a so far unidentified globular cluster .",
    "the best known example of a stream is the tidally stripped stars and globular clusters associated with the sagittarius dwarf spheroidal . a panorama of the the sagittarius stream in the northern hemisphere was recently obtained by @xcite , who mapped out the stars satisfying @xmath11 in almost all of sdss data release 5 ( dr5 ) .",
    "this color plot of the high - latitude galactic northern hemisphere has been dubbed the `` field of streams '' .",
    "in addition to the features associated with the sagittarius dsph , the plot exhibits extensive substructure . the purpose of this paper is to analyze the `` orphan stream ''  so named for its lack of obvious progenitor .",
    "this is a striking feature discovered by  @xcite in the field of streams , and independently detected in public sdss data by  @xcite .",
    "sdss imaging data are produced in five photometric bands , namely @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16  ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    ", we use the maps of  @xcite .",
    "all the magnitudes in the paper are reddenning corrected . data release 5 covers @xmath17 square degrees around the galactic north pole , and 3 strips in the galactic southern hemisphere .",
    "the left panel of figure  [ fig : vasa ] shows the orphan stream in an rgb composite image .",
    "it has been constructed using all sdss dr5 stars   with @xmath18 , with blue for stars with @xmath19 , green for stars with @xmath20 and red for stars with @xmath21 .",
    "the orphan stream is clearly visible running roughly from top to bottom at right ascensions @xmath22 .",
    "it may be traced over nearly @xmath23 of arc in dr5 .",
    "some familiar objects are marked in the right panel of figure  [ fig : vasa ] , including the bifurcated sagittarius stream , the monoceros ring , the newly discovered globular cluster segue 1  @xcite and the two distant dwarf spheroidal galaxies leo i and leo ii .",

    "our aim is to constrain the distance and the stellar content of the orphan stream by comparison with cmds of populations of known age and metallicity . for this purpose ,",
    "we create masks ( or color - magnitude boxes ) based on the @xmath14 versus @xmath25 ridgeline of globular clusters and theoretical isochrones by shifting them both horizontally and vertically .",
    "the mask is applied to select stars from the fields on and off the stream shown in the right panel of figure  [ fig : vasa ] .",
    "the signal is assessed by measuring the difference in the number of stars between the on and off streams as a function of distance modulus .",
    "the left panel of figure  [ fig : hess ] shows a hess diagram using all the stars in dr5 . from blue to red , the main components of this cmd are the halo , thick disk and thin disk of the milky way .",

    "the right panel shows a sequence of theoretical isochrones computed by  @xcite for the sdss photometric system .",
    "different metallicities are distinguished by different colors as shown in the key to the panel .",
    "although we investigate a range of ages , only the isochrones corresponding to 1 , 5 , 10 and 14 gyrs are displayed . to compare the model predictions with observations",
    ", we also use the illustrated masks based on the ridgelines of the old ( 14 gyrs ) clusters m92 ( [ fe / h ] = @xmath27 ) , m13 ( [ fe / h ] = @xmath28 ) and m71 ( [ fe / h ] = @xmath29 ) .",
    "these are produced from the data of @xcite and chosen to span a representative range of metallicities .",
    "the orphan stream ( and parts of the sagittarius stream ) shown in figure  [ fig : vasa ] are blue - green in our rgb scheme .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath30 , which is typical for the old , metal - poor halo .",
    "most of the stars are redwards of @xmath31 .",
    "the stars that are bluewards could be either blue stragglers / blue horizontal branch stars , or main sequence turn - off stars scattered by large photometric errors .",
    "it is well - known that , given a color - magnitude diagram , simultaneously fitting for age , metallicity and distance modulus is degenerate .",
    "however , we have some clues as to the likely nature of the solution .",
    "the length and the width of the orphan stream suggests that it is dynamically old .",
    "if star formation ceased after the interaction that produced the tails , then the stars in the stream are expected to be old . also ,",
    "when viewed from the sun , tidal streams deviate from a great circle .",
    "the deviation is controlled by @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the stream s average heliocentric distance and @xmath34 is the offset of the sun from the galactic center ( here taken as 8 kpc ) .",
    "this parallactic effect gives an average heliocentric distance to the stream of @xmath35 kpc .",
    "the results of applying the masks to the photometric data are shown in figure  [ fig : stellarpops ] . in the left column",
    ", each panel corresponds to a different field . for a given metallicity and age ,",
    "the masks are applied at different distance modulus and the number of excess stars in the on - stream field is calculated .",
    "the maximum value fixes a distance modulus .",
    "the number of excess stars at this distance modulus is used to build up the curve .",
    "the different colored lines correspond to different metallicities . even though there is a degeneracy , the distances to which models of different metallicities converge are broadly consistent .",
    "for example , in field 1 , most of the distances are between 20 and 30 kpc , whereas in field 5 , they are mostly above 30 kpc . these values are somewhat higher than the @xmath36 kpc obtained from the parallactic effect , but consistent given the uncertainties and given the strong assumptions in the latter calculation .",
    "the m92 and m13 masks perform similarly to the corresponding isochrones , although there are some small discrepancies .",
    "it is reassuring that the results based on theoretical models are supported by those based on data .",
    "even though young stellar population seemingly perform quite well in figure  [ fig : stellarpops ] , this is not really the case . from the turn - off color of the orphan stream ( see e.g. , figure  [ fig : vasa ] ) , we can exclude young populations with a turn - off bluer than @xmath37 .",
    "young isochrones are so blue that even the metal - rich ones extend blue enough to overlap with the orphan stream cmd and hence give a signal in figure  [ fig : stellarpops ] .    the general conclusion",
    "is that the old , metal - poor masks perform better , and in some instances , significantly better than the metal - rich masks . given this , we take the three metal - poor models , namely [ fe / h ] @xmath38 , and identify the age at which the signal is maximised .",
    "these masks are now used to investigate the behavior of the signal as a function of distance modulus , shown in the panels in the right column .",
    "also shown are the curves based on the ridgelines of m92 ( solid ) and m13 ( dotted ) .",
    "they all show a similar performance and so we average them as displayed in the inset ( solid black curve ) .",
    "a gaussian model is then fit to this curve to give a central value , its uncertainty and a dispersion .",
    "these numbers are recorded in table  [ tab : orphan ] .",
    "the uncertainty in the mean gives a lower bound to the true distance error , whilst the dispersion overestimates the error , as the curves in the insets are a convolution of the true error distribution with the mask .",
    "@xcite has also recently analyzed the stars of the orphan stream .",
    "grillmair s detection method uses m13 as a template for the stellar population of the stream .",
    "his figure 3 shows a clear upper main sequence and sub - giant branch  which appear to be located somewhat blueward of the m13 ridgeline .",
    "this is consistent with a stream composed of a somewhat younger and/or metal - poor stellar population than m13 . in turn",
    ", this is in agreement with the blue color of the orphan stream in our figure  [ fig : vasa ] , suggesting that our detection method is picking up primarily turn - off and upper main sequence stars .",

    "these are identified with the cut @xmath39 , and as usual the difference between on - stream and off - stream fields is computed .",
    "bhb stars have an absolute magnitude of @xmath40 ( see the right panel of figure  [ fig : hess ] ) .",
    "such a bhb population would be detected by peaks in the differential number distribution in the apparent magnitude range @xmath41 for the five fields inspected .",
    "there is no evidence for such a signal .",
    "however , blue stragglers have an absolute magnitude @xmath42 of between 2 and 4 and there are hints of peaks in fields 1 and 5 for @xmath43 .",
    "this seems consistent , given the distance moduli in table  [ tab : orphan ] .",
    "figure  [ fig : dist ] shows cross - sections across the stream in a coordinate system which has been rotated so the stream lies along the @xmath44-axis .",
    "the cross - section contains only those stars with @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "we estimate that the thickness ( fwhm ) of the orphan stream is @xmath47 in projection ( or @xmath48 pc assuming a conservative distance of @xmath49 kpc ) , which would make it broader than all known globular cluster streams , but smaller than the branches of the sagittarius stream and the monoceros ring .",
    "this suggests that the progenitor was a low luminosity dwarf satellite galaxy , rather than a globular cluster .",
    "taking the total profile ( upper curve in figure  [ fig : dist ] ) , we fit a polynomial to estimate the background and then compute the luminosity of the stream .",
    "the number of excess stars in the @xmath50 arc of the stream is @xmath51 within @xmath52 .",
    "hence , the total apparent magnitude of the stream in these stars is around @xmath53 ( assuming an average @xmath14 magnitude of 21.0 ) . given the stream fwhm of @xmath47 , the average density of these stars is @xmath54 per square degree , which translates to an average surface brightness of the stream of @xmath55 per square arcsec . to correct for other stars , we use the data on the luminosity function of m92 derived from cfht observations ( clem 2006 , private communication ) .",
    "this gives the average surface brightness of the stream as @xmath56 per square arcsec and the total @xmath14 magnitude as @xmath57 .",
    "assuming the distance really is @xmath49 kpc gives an absolute magnitude of the @xmath50 arc as @xmath58 assuming plausibly that there ought to be at least the same again on the other side of the progenitor , then we can boost the total to at least @xmath59 for the stream stars alone .",

    "m92 , m13 and m71  were used to build cmd masks .",
    "there is a degeneracy between age , metallicity and distance which can not be broken with the existing photometric data .",

    "were torn off as tidal debris during the merging .",
    "complex a could be neutral gas that was stripped from a gas - rich dwarf irregular progenitor , perhaps at a disk - crossing . alternatively , a large galaxy can shock and compress ionised gas in the halo , which can then cool  @xcite , leaving a trail of neutral gas in its wake .",
