    "recently many new mesons have been observed in the open and hidden charm sectors @xcite . from the need of theoretical interpretation of those states , the interesting possibility of identifying",
    "new `` exotic '' structures has been pointed out . in the following",
    "i discuss the case of @xmath0 , which represents one of the most interesting examples in this sense .",
    "in particular i focus the attention on the properties of the radiative decays @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the experimental observations can be summarized as follows :    * the @xmath0 resonance has been found in @xmath2 distribution by four experiments , both in @xmath3 decays(@xmath4 ) , both in @xmath5 annihilation @xcite .",
    "the mass is @xmath6 mev while the width remains unresolved : @xmath7 mev ( 90 % cl ) ; * there is no evidence of resonances in the charged mode @xmath8 or in @xmath9 @xcite ; * the state is not observed in @xmath10 annihilation ; * for @xmath11 produced in @xmath3 decays the ratio @xmath12 is obtained @xcite ; * the dipion spectrum in @xmath2 is peaked at large mass @xcite ; * the decay in @xmath13 is observed @xcite with @xmath14 : this implies g - parity violation ; * the radiative mode @xmath15 is found @xcite with @xmath16 , therefore charge conjugation of the state is c=+1 ; * the angular distribution of the final state is compatible with the spin - parity assignment @xmath17 @xcite ; * there is a signal in @xmath18 with @xmath19 @xcite ; the near - threshold @xmath18 enhancement in @xmath20has a the peak at @xmath21 mev with @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "all the measurements are compatible with the assignment @xmath23 , but if the @xmath24 is identified with @xmath25 , another recently observed meson , there is an overpopulation of @xmath26 @xmath27 mesons .",
    "this , together with the observation of the g - parity violating @xmath11 transitions suggested the conjecture that @xmath0 is not a charmonium @xmath28 state .",
    "indeed , the coincidence between the @xmath11 mass as averaged by pdg and the @xmath29 mass inspired the proposal that @xmath0 could be a molecular quarkonium @xcite , a @xmath30 and @xmath31 bound state with small binding energy due to a single pion exchange @xcite . in this scheme",
    "the wave function of @xmath0 is given by @xcite : @xmath32 ( with @xmath33 ) and so one could explain why this state seems not to have definite isospin , why the mode @xmath34 was not found , and why , if the binding mechanism is a single pion exchange ( which is in fact a controversial point ) , there are no @xmath35 molecular states .",
    "the opposing remark concerning the large value of the ratio @xmath36 is that the ratio of the amplitudes is small : @xmath37 , so that the isospin violating amplitude is 20% of the isospin conserving one , an effect that could be related to the mass difference between neutral and charged @xmath38 mesons , considering the contribution of @xmath39 intermediate states to @xmath11 decays @xcite . moreover , the central value of the mass measured in @xmath18 is @xmath40 mev higher than the pdg value ( with a large systematic error ) , a result difficult to explain in the molecular picture @xcite .",
    "it has also been suggested that the molecular interpretation would imply that the radiative decay in neutral @xmath38 mesons : @xmath41 should be dominant with respect to @xmath42 @xcite .",
    "however , assuming that @xmath0 is an ordinary @xmath23 charmonium and describing the @xmath43 amplitude by polar diagrams with @xmath44 and @xmath45 as intermediate particles the ratio @xmath46 depends only on the ratio @xmath47 , @xmath48 being the parameter governing the radiative @xmath49 matrix element , and @xmath50 representing the coupling @xmath51 ( or @xmath52 ) .",
    "the ratio @xmath53 is plotted in fig.[fig : ratio ] versus @xmath54 and it is shown that in any case @xmath55 . thus , there is a suppression of the radiative @xmath11 decay mode into charged @xmath38 mesons with respect to the mode with neutral @xmath38 .",
    "moreover , for small values of @xmath56 the ratio @xmath53 is tiny , so that this seems not a peculiar feature of a molecular structure of @xmath0 .",
    "the photon spectrum in radiative @xmath11 decays to both neutral and charged @xmath38 meson pairs for two representative values of @xmath57 , namely @xmath58 and @xmath59 , is depicted in fig.[fig : spectra ] .",
    "+      for small values of the parameter @xmath47 , i.e. in the condition where the intermediate @xmath44 dominates the decay amplitude , the photon spectrum in the @xmath60 mode essentially coincides with the line corresponding to the @xmath44 decay at @xmath61 mev and width determined by the @xmath44 width .",
    "the narrow peak is different from the line shape expected in a molecular description , which is related to the wave function of the two heavy mesons bound in the @xmath0 , in particular to the binding energy of the system , being broader for larger binding energy . on the other hand ,",
    "the photon spectrum in the charged @xmath62 mode is broader , with a peak at @xmath63 mev , the total @xmath64 rate being severely suppressed with respect to the @xmath65 one .    at the opposite side of the @xmath47 range , where @xmath45 gives a large contribution to the radiative amplitude",
    ", a peak at @xmath66 mev appears both in neutral and charged @xmath38 meson modes , in the first case together with the structure at @xmath61 mev .",
    "this spectrum was described also in @xcite , where in this case the radiative decay was interpreted as deriving from the @xmath28 core of @xmath0 . in this range of parameters",
    "the ratio of the @xmath64 to @xmath65 rates reaches the largest value .",
    "the experimental determination of the photon spectrum of the type depicted in fig.[fig : spectra ] , together with the measurement of the @xmath67 widths is a challenging task .",
    "nevertheless , this measurement is important to shed light on the structure of @xmath0 .",
    "other methods to distinguish between a molecular and a quarkonium description have been proposed , and concern the pionic @xmath11 decays to @xmath68 @xcite .",
    "i have summarized the features of @xmath0 , discussing in particular possible tests of the molecular interpretation of this state .",
    "i have focused the attention on the radiative decays @xmath69 , showing that the suppression of the charged channel with respect to the neutral one is not a distinctive feature of the molecular picture . however , in this decay mode the photon spectrum is expected to be different in the @xmath70 and molecular description , so that its experimental investigation could be useful to shed more light on this puzzling hadron .",
