    "the scalar channels in the region up to 1 gev is a stumbling block of qcd .",
    "the point is that not only perturbation theory fails here , but sum rules as well in view of the fact that isolated resonances are absent in this region .",

    "hunting the light @xmath1 and @xmath15 mesons had begun in the sixties already .",
    "but long - standing unsuccessful attempts to prove their existence in a conclusive way entailed general disappointment and a preliminary information on these states disappeared from particle data group ( pdg ) reviews .",
    "one of principal reasons against the @xmath1 and @xmath15 mesons was the fact that both @xmath2 and @xmath16 scattering phase shifts do not pass over @xmath17 at putative resonance masses @xcite .",
    "situation changes when we showed ( 1994 ) that in the linear @xmath1 model @xmath18- \\frac{m_\\sigma^2}{2}\\sigma^2- \\frac{m_\\pi^2}{2 } \\overrightarrow{\\pi}^2 \\nonumber\\\\[9pt ]   & & - \\frac{m_\\sigma^2-m_\\pi^2}{8f^2_\\pi}\\left [ \\left ( \\sigma^2+\\overrightarrow{\\pi}^2\\right ) ^2 + 4f_\\pi\\sigma \\left ( \\sigma^2+\\overrightarrow{\\pi}^2\\right ) \\right ] ^2\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] there is a negative background phase which hides the @xmath1 meson @xcite .",
    "it has been made clear that shielding wide lightest scalar mesons in chiral dynamics is very natural .",

    "another thing is the @xmath1 propagator    @xmath26    the @xmath1 meson self - energy @xmath27 is caused by the intermediate @xmath2 states , that is , by the four - quark intermediate states .",
    "this contribution shifts the breit - wigner ( bw ) mass greatly @xmath28 .",
    "so , half the bw mass is determined by the four - quark contribution at least .",
    "the imaginary part dominates the propagator modulus in the region 300 mev @xmath29 600 mev .",
    "so , the @xmath1 field is described by its four - quark component at least in this energy ( virtuality ) region .",
    "in theory the principal problem is impossibility to use the linear @xmath1 model in the tree level approximation inserting widths into @xmath1 meson propagators because such an approach breaks the both unitarity and the adler self - consistency condition .",
