    "materials with either negative real relative permittivity or negative real relative permeability at a certain frequency are not uncommon .",
    "consideration of materials for which both these quantities are simultaneously negative and real  valued , commenced with veselago s paper of 1968 @xcite . although he pointed out many unusual properties of such materials , including inverse refraction , negative radiation pressure , inverse doppler effect , over three decades ago , the considerations were completely speculative in view of the lack of a material , or even a nonhomogeneous composite medium , with a relative permittivity having a negative real part and a very small imaginary part .",
    "a breakthrough was achieved by smith _",
    "@xcite , who , developing some earlier ideas by pendry _",
    "@xcite , presented evidence for a weakly dissipative composite medium displaying negative values for the real parts of its _ effective _ permittivity and _ effective _ permeability .",
    "their so  called _",
    "meta_material consists of various inclusions of conducting rings and wires embedded within printed circuit boards .",
    "their conclusions were based on observations from three separate composite mediums .",
    "* consisted of a lattice of ring  like inclusions , which for a certain field configuration was presumed to have a resonant relative permeability @xmath0 of the form @xcite @xmath1 where the resonance frequency @xmath2 depends principally on the geometry of the rings . in this model ,",
    "dissipation is facilitated by @xmath3 , and @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) is the ratio of the area occupied by a ring and that of a unit cell . for weak dissipation ,",
    "the real part of @xmath6 is negative for @xmath7 . * consisted of an included matrix of wires .",
    "the effective relative permittivity @xmath8 of this composite medium supposedly displays plasma  like behaviour according to @xmath9 the effective plasma frequency @xmath10 being dependent on the geometry .",
    "in such a medium , @xmath8 is negative for @xmath11 . *",
    "combined the first two , it being postulated that the combination would exhibit negative real  valued permeability and negative real  valued permittivity within a certain frequency range .",
    "although some numerical and experimental evidence was presented in 2000 @xcite , the most striking report appeared the following year @xcite and gave preliminary indications of the observation of the so ",
    "called negative index of refraction .",
    "other types of nanostructural combinations with similar response properties can also be devised @xcite .",
    "the emergence of a clear terminology is often a difficult process with regards to scientific findings relating to novel effects , something that is also apparent in the present instance .",
    "the original classification of the materials exhibiting the effects discussed labelled them _ left  handed electromagnetic materials _ @xcite .",
    "but chiral materials are important subjects of electromagnetics research and the terms _ left  handedness _ and _ right  handedness _ have been applied to the molecular structure of such materials for well over a century @xcite .",
    "the continued use of the term _ left  handed materials _ ( lhms ) for achiral materials in , for example",
    ", @xcite will thus confuse the crucial issues .",
    "other authors @xcite are promoting the term _ backward medium _",
    "( bw ) which presumes the _ a priori _ definitions of forward and backward directions . in the most recent contribution @xcite ( which also provides the most extensive theoretical and numerical analysis of the negative index of refraction to date ) ,",
    "the authors introduce the technical term _",
    "double negative _ ( dng ) medium to indicate that the real parts of both permittivity and permeability are negative .",
    "while sensible enough , such nomenclature conceals the importance of dissipative effects .    in time , a consensus about terminology will undoubtedly emerge ; and it is not our aim to contribute to this particular discussion .",
    "instead the purpose of this note is pedagogical . in the first instance",
    ", it is important that dissipation be included in the analysis .",
    "this was largely neglected in the reports cited earlier , with the exemption of the most recent study @xcite .",
    "secondly , it is desirable to derive the general condition for the type of _ anomalous _ propagation that is characteristic of the considered materials : namely , where the phase velocity is directed oppositely to the power flow .",
    "consider a plane wave propagating along the @xmath12 axis in a linear , homogeneous , isotropic , dielectric ",
    "magnetic medium whose relative permittivity and relative permeability are denoted by @xmath13 and @xmath14 , respectively .",
    "an @xmath15 time ",
    "dependence is assumed here .",
    "then @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the free  space wavenumber , @xmath18 is the intrinsic impedance of free space , and @xmath19 .",
    "consequently , the poynting vector is parallel to the @xmath12 axis and its time  average is given as @xmath20 = { \\rm re } \\left [ \\frac{n}{\\mu_r}\\right]\\ , \\frac{\\vert a\\vert^2}{2\\etao}\\,\\exp(-2\\ko{\\rm im}[n]z)\\,~,\\ ] ] where @xmath21 $ ] and @xmath22 $ ] , respectively , denote the operations of taking the real and the imaginary part , whilst @xmath23 indicates complex conjugation .",
    "let us now assume a lorentzian model for @xmath24 and @xmath14 .",
    "this will include the specified forms ( [ mu ] ) and ( [ eps ] ) as special cases .",
    "dissipation results from the imaginary parts of @xmath24 and @xmath14 whilst causality dictates that @xmath25 > 0 $ ] and @xmath26 > 0 $ ] , so that @xmath24 and @xmath14 lie in the upper half of the complex plane .",
    "however , there are two resultant complex refractive indexes , @xmath27 , of which @xmath28 lies in the upper half of the complex plane and @xmath29 in the lower half .",
    "the situation is summarized in figure 1 for which the resonant form of ( [ mu ] ) was used as representative of both @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "of course , the resonances of @xmath32 and @xmath31 are unlikely to coincide , so that for a particular value of @xmath33 , the arrows corresponding to @xmath24 and @xmath14 will not be necessarily parallel .",
    "only the upper half of the complex plane is shown in the figure .",
    "now @xmath34 may be written as @xmath35 where @xmath36 here @xmath37 and @xmath38 , representing the arguments of @xmath24 and @xmath14 respectively , must obey the conditions @xmath39 .",
    "consequently , @xmath40 .",
    "we then always have @xmath41 > 0 \\quad { \\rm i.e.}\\ p_z(n_+ ) > 0\\ ] ] and also @xmath42 < 0 \\quad { \\rm i.e.}\\ p_z(n_- ) < 0 \\,.\\ ] ] thus the choice @xmath28 _ always _ relates to power flow in the @xmath43 direction , whilst @xmath29 _ always _ relates to power flow in the @xmath44 direction .",
    "since necessarily @xmath45 > 0 $ ] and @xmath46 < 0 $ ] , power flow is always in the direction of exponential decrease of the fields amplitudes .",
    "we can now identify when the phase velocity is opposite to the direction of power flow .",
    "this occurs whenever @xmath47 < 0 $ ] ( and consequently @xmath48   > 0 $ ] , also ) . after setting @xmath49 ( where @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the real and imaginary parts of the relative permittivity and the relative permeability , respectively )",
    ", the following condition is straightforwardly derived for such propagation : @xmath52 \\left [ + { \\left ( { \\mu'_r}^2 + { \\mu''_r}^2    \\right ) } ^{1/2}- { \\mu'_r } \\right ] > \\eps''_r\\mu''_r~~.\\ ] ]    before turning to a fully illustrative example in the proceeding section , let us investigate some immediate repercussions of the inequality ( [ inequality ] ) which is central to this paper .",
    "* consider , in the first instance , the behaviour at a resonance of the relative permittivity , i.e. @xmath53 , @xmath54 .",
    "then , ( [ inequality ] ) reduces to @xmath55 > \\mu''_r \\ , , \\ ] ] an inequality that is always fulfilled when @xmath56 .",
    "+ likewise , at a resonance of the relative permeability , i.e. @xmath57 , @xmath58 , ( [ inequality ] ) is fulfilled whenever @xmath59 . * further insight into inequality ( [ inequality ] ) can be gained by requiring that @xmath60 and @xmath61 simultaneously hold .",
    "consequently , ( [ inequality ] ) is definitely satisfied .",
    "it should be remarked though , that the parameter space of the permittivity and permeability that fulfils ( [ inequalitye ] ) and ( [ inequalitym ] ) is only a subset of the one fulfilling ( [ inequality ] ) . in any case ,",
    "( [ inequalitye ] ) holds if and only if @xmath59 , and ( [ inequalitym ] ) holds if and only if @xmath56 ( we remind the reader that @xmath54 , @xmath62 because of causality requirements ) . we note that @xmath59 and @xmath56 can only occur close to absorption resonances ( as discussed in the previous item ) . * finally ,",
    "consider an electromagnetic wave propagating in a plasma below the plasma frequency ( @xmath63 ) and in which dissipation is very small ( @xmath64 , @xmath65 ) .",
    "straighforward taylor expansions reduce inequality ( [ inequality ] ) to @xmath66 therefore , the existence of the type of anomalous propagation being studied here depends in this case crucially on the ratio of the imaginary parts of the relative permittivity and relative permeability .",
    "whether the criterion ( [ ineq ] ) is satisfied or not , the power flow in this case is in any case small .",
    "let us exemplify the foregoing in detail by an explicit invocation of the lorentz model for both @xmath24 and @xmath14 ; thus , @xmath67 here @xmath68 is the free  space wavelength , @xmath69 are the oscillator strengths , @xmath70 are the resonance wavelengths , while @xmath71 are the resonance linewidths .",
    "figures 2a and 2b comprise plots of the real and imaginary parts of @xmath24 and @xmath14 as functions of @xmath72 , when @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76  mm and @xmath77  mm .",
    "clearly , five separate spectral regions can be identified in figure 2 . at the either extremity of the horizontal axis",
    "are the two regions wherein @xmath78 and @xmath79 . in the neighbourhood of @xmath80  mm ,",
    "@xmath81 but @xmath82 . both @xmath83 and @xmath84 in the neighbourhood of @xmath85  mm .",
    "finally , @xmath78 but @xmath84 around @xmath86  mm . of course , both @xmath87 and @xmath88 for all @xmath72 .",
    "detailed calculations confirm that the spectral region wherein the inequality ( [ inequality ] ) is satisfied is larger than the middle region ( wherein both @xmath83 and @xmath84 ) .",
    "the former cover parts of the adjoining regions , in which either ( [ inequalitye ] ) or ( [ inequalitym ] ) holds .    in the five spectral regions identified , the isotropic dielectric ",
    "magnetic medium would respond differently to monochromatic electromagnetic excitation .",
    "suppose that a plane wave is normally incident on a half  space occupied by this medium .",
    "the reflectance @xmath89 is then given by the standard expression @xmath90 where @xmath91 for all @xmath72 by virtue of the principle of conservation of energy .",
    "the reflectance spectrum calculated with the constitutive parameters used for figures 2a and 2b is shown in figure 3 .",
    "the reflectance is markedly high in the two regions wherein @xmath92 and @xmath93 have opposite signs , but not in the other three regions .",
    "the reflectance is particularly low in the leftmost and the rightmost regions ( @xmath78 and @xmath79 ) because the ratio @xmath94 is close to unity therein .",
    "however , the reflectance is somewhat higher in the central region ( @xmath83 and @xmath84 ) because @xmath95 .",
    "in this pedagogical note , we have derived a general condition for the phase velocity to be oppositely directed to the power flow in isotropic dielectric  magnetic mediums in which the only constraints on the values of the relative permittivity and relative permeability are those imposed by causality . in this regard , the topical case of mediums in which @xmath24 and @xmath14 have negative real parts is seen to be a sufficient , but not necessary , condition for such propagation , as noted in the comments succeeding ( [ inequality ] ) .",
