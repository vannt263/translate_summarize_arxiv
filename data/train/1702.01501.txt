    "large - scale molecular line observations are important to unveil how molecular clouds have been formed and evolved because in interstellar space , large - scale dynamical events such as bubbles and supersonic turbulent flows often influence the structure and kinematics of molecular gas where star formation happens ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in the present paper ,",
    "we investigate the cloud structure and kinematics of the aquila rift and serpens molecular cloud complex , on the basis of large - scale multi - co line observations .",
    "aquila rift is located in the first galactic quadrant , spanning from 20@xmath12 to 40@xmath12 in galactic longitude and @xmath13 to 10@xmath12 in galactic latitude .",
    "it appears in the optical image as a dark lane that divides the bright band of the milky way longitudinally @xcite .",
    "the total molecular gas mass is estimated to be about a few @xmath14 on the basis of the co ( @xmath15 ) observations with an angular resolution of about 7@xmath5.5 @xcite .",
    "@xcite identified a number of dark clouds in this region using the digitized sky survey visual extinction data .",
    "these previous studies indicate that the region has complex density and velocity structure , suggesting that the dynamical interaction and events might be ongoing and/or have happened in this region @xcite .",
    "in fact , @xcite pointed out that several nearby superbubble shells appear to converge toward the aquila rift region . in the southern part of aquila rift , @xcite suggested that the virial mass of the molecular cloud complex is significantly larger than the molecular gas mass and star formation is less active .",
    "however , the molecular gas distribution and star formation activity in the northern part above the galactic plane have not been extensively explored so far . here , we focus on the western part of aquila rift , which stretches from @xmath16 to @xmath17 in galactic longitude and @xmath18 to @xmath19 in galactic latitude .",
    "the western part of aquila rift contains several active star - forming regions such as serpens main , serpens south , w40 , and mwc 297 . in a well - studied nearby cluster - forming region , serpens main star - forming region @xcite , several young protostars are blowing out of powerful collimated outflows .",
    "recently , the _ spitzer _",
    "observations have discovered an extremely - young embedded cluster of low - mass protostars , serpens south , which contains a large number of class 0/i objects @xcite .",
    "in fact , @xcite detected a number of co outflows in the central part of serpens south ( see also * ? ? ? * ) . in more evolved star - forming region , w40 hii region ,",
    "the expanding structure affects the star formation in this region @xcite .",
    "recent studies also suggest that cloud - cloud collision may have triggered star formation in serpens main region @xcite and serpens south region @xcite .",
    "mwc 297 is an embedded young massive b1.5ve star , one of the closest massive stars @xcite .",
    "a molecular outflow is detected toward the mwc 297 region , implying that active star formation is ongoing . in spite of the effort of these previous studies , it remains uncertain why star formation in the western part is much more active than the southern part .",
    "in addition , the distance to the aquila rift and serpens cloud complex is somewhat controversial . for the serpens main star - forming region , the distance of @xmath20",
    "260 pc has been used @xcite .",
    "this distance determination is based mainly on measurements of the extinction suffered by stars in the direction of serpens .",
    "however , recent vlba measurements of young stellar objects , ec95a and ec95b , suggest a larger distance of 415 pc @xcite . for the w40 cloud",
    ", the distance is estimated to be @xmath21 pc and has not yet been determined to a satisfactory precision @xcite .",
    "the distance to mwc 297 is estimated to be 250 pc @xcite or 450 pc @xcite on the basis of measurements of the extinction of stars , and the uncertainty is a similar degree to other regions in the aquila rift and serpens cloud complexes .",
    "serpens south has a local standard of rest ( lsr ) velocity similar to serpens main @xcite .",
    "this fact suggests that serpens south may have a distance similar to serpens main .",
    "however , no accurate distance measurements have been done so far .",
    "the uncertainty of the distance makes it difficult to clarify the cloud dynamical states in the aquila rift and serpens cloud complexes . in the present paper ,",
    "we compare the cloud physical quantities for both 260 pc and 415 pc .    in the present paper ,",
    "as a first step toward a better understanding of star formation activity in the aquila rift and serpens molecular cloud complexes , we investigate the large - scale molecular cloud structure of the region with an angular resolution of about 3@xmath5 , on the basis of wide field @xmath0co ( @xmath22 ) and @xmath2co ( @xmath22 ) observations . in section [ sec : obs ] , we present the detail of our observations . in section",
    "[ sec : results ] , we describe the large - scale co structure in this region .",
    "we find several arcs that may have been formed by the large - scale flows .",
    "we also derive the @xmath23 factor of this region by comparing co velocity - integrated intensity map and the 2mass extinction map . in section [ sec : clouds ] , we apply ` scimes ` @xcite to the co data cube , and identify the clouds . in the present paper ,",
    "we call structures identified by ` scimes ` as `` clouds '' . then",
    ", we attempt to assess their dynamical states .",
    "finally , we briefly summarize the main results in section [ sec : summary ] .",
    "we carried out @xmath0co ( @xmath22 ) , @xmath2co ( @xmath22 ) , and c@xmath24o ( @xmath22 ) mapping observations toward the aquila rift and serpens molecular cloud complexes , during the periods from 2012 february to 2012 march and from 2012 december to 2013 march .",
    "the observations were done in the on - the - fly ( otf ) mapping mode with a 2sb sis mixer receiver on the 1.85 m radio telescope of osaka prefecture university .",
    "the telescope is installed at the nobeyama radio observatory ( nro ) . the image rejection ratio ( irr )",
    "was measured to be 10 db or higher during the observations . at 230 ghz band ,",
    "the telescope has a beam size of @xmath25 ( hpbw ) and a main beam efficiency of @xmath26 = 0.6 . at the back end",
    ", we used a digital fourier transform spectrometer ( dfs ) with 16384 channels that covers the 1 ghz bandwidth , which allows us to obtain the three molecular lines , @xmath0co ( @xmath22 ) , @xmath2co ( @xmath22 ) , and c@xmath24o ( @xmath22 ) , simultaneously . in the present paper ,",
    "we focus on the @xmath0co ( @xmath22 ) and @xmath2co ( @xmath22 ) data .",
    "the frequency resolution was set to 61 khz , which corresponds to the velocity resolution of @xmath20 0.08 km s@xmath7 at 220 ghz . during the observations ,",
    "the system noise temperatures were about 200 @xmath11 400 k in a single sideband .",
    "further description of the telescope is given by @xcite .",
    "the observed area was a rectangle area with 40 square degrees whose coordinates of the bottom - left - corner ( blc ) and top - right - corner ( trc ) are @xmath27 ( @xmath17 , @xmath18 ) and ( @xmath16 , @xmath19 ) , respectively . the area was divided into 40 boxes of @xmath28 , each of which was scanned a few times in both galactic longitude and lattitude with a row spacing of @xmath29 at a scan speed of @xmath30 sec per row .",
    "the standard chopper wheel method was used to correct the output signals for the atmospheric attenuation and to convert them into the antenna temperatures ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "then , we corrected the antenna temperatures for the main beam efficiency to obtain the brightness temperatures @xmath32 (= @xmath33 ) .",
    "we applied a convolution technique with a gaussian function to calculate the intensity onto a regular grid with a spacing of 1@xmath5 .",
    "the resultant effective angular resolution was @xmath34 .",
    "the rms noise levels of the final @xmath0co and @xmath2co maps vary from box to box , and are summarized in appendix a ( tables a1 and a2 ) .",
    "the average noise levels are given in the last column of table 1 .",
    "to compare with the molecular line data , we downloaded the near - infrared ( nir ) color excess map of @xmath35 shown in figure [ fig:2mass](a ) from http://darkclouds.u-gakugei.ac.jp/2mass/download.html .",
    "the map was originally generated by @xcite and @xcite utilizing the 2mass point source catalog , and sampled at the same @xmath29 grid along the galactic coordinates as the co data .",
    "the angular resolution , however , varies in the range of @xmath36 , because the map was drawn using the  adaptive grid \" technique to achieve a constant noise level .",
    "see @xcite and @xcite for details . in section [ sec",
    ": av ] , using the @xmath35 color excess map , we construct the visual extinction map of the aquila rift and serpens cloud complexes , which is presented in figure [ fig:2mass](c ) .",
    "some of the active star - forming regions are designated in figure [ fig:2mass](c ) .",
    "figure [ fig:12co integ map ] shows the @xmath0co ( @xmath22 ) velocity integrated intensity map toward the aquila rift and serpens molecular cloud complexes . for comparison ,",
    "the @xmath0co ( @xmath22 ) channel maps and the longitude - velocity diagram averaged over the galactic latitude range of @xmath37 are shown in figures [ fig:12co channel map ] and [ fig : pv map ] , respectively .",
    "@xmath0co , @xmath2co , and c@xmath24o line spectra at several positions are also presented in figure [ fig : spectra ] .",
    "the co emission is extended almost over the entire mapped area .",
    "the co integrated intensity takes its maximum at the position of @xmath38 , which is in the molecular cloud associated with the serpens cluster a. the @xmath0co emission associated with the serpens cluster b is not so prominent .",
    "other co peaks are located at @xmath39 , which corresponds to the w40 hii region , and at the position of @xmath40 .",
    "most co emission comes from the velocity range of 0 @xmath11 20 km s@xmath7 , which is presumably associated with the gould belt , an expanding ring of stars in the local spiral arm .",
    "a prominent feature of the longitude - velocity and channel maps is the existence of two spatially - extended components with different velocities , @xmath41 km s@xmath7 and 8 km s@xmath7 in the part of galactic longitude smaller than 29@xmath12 .",
    "the former component is recognized in the first panel ( @xmath42 km s@xmath7 ) of the velocity channel map in figure [ fig:12co channel map ] .",
    "the latter is more spatially - extended in the entire observed area . in the @xmath0co longitude - velocity diagram ( figure [ fig : pv map ] ) , the two components appear to converge at around the position of the serpens south and w40 cloud , which might suggest the two components interact with each other , triggering the active star formation in serrpens south and w40 . however , there is also a possibility that the two components are simply overlapped along the line - of sight .",
    "another interesting characteristic is that in the channel maps , some velocity - coherent , large - scale linear structures can be recognized .",
    "for example , in both 1@xmath114 km s@xmath7 ( the first panel of figure [ fig:12co channel map ] ) and 9@xmath1113 km s@xmath7 ( the third panel of figure [ fig:12co channel map ] ) panels , a couple of large arcs with similar morphologies are recognized . to emphasize these structures ,",
    "we show in figures [ fig:12co channel map2]a and [ fig:12co channel map2]b , the @xmath0co intensity maps integrated over the velocity intervals of @xmath43 km s@xmath7 and @xmath44 km s@xmath7 , respectively , where the velocity - coherent linear structures are indicated with dashed curves . assuming a distance of 260 pc",
    ", these linear structures are found to be very large as about 6 @xmath11 20 pc in length .",
    "hereafter , we call these linear structures arcs . since ism is highly turbulent , such large - scale structures should be created by large - scale dynamical events such as large - scale turbulent flows and/or supernova shocks .",
    "these arcs might be created by the superbubbles converging toward the observed area @xcite .    for comparison",
    ", we show @xmath2co ( @xmath22 ) velocity integrated intensity map toward the aquila rift and serpens molecular cloud complexes in figure [ fig:13co integ map ] .",
    "the @xmath2co ( @xmath22 ) channel maps and the longitude - velocity diagram integrated over the galactic latitude range of @xmath37 are indicated in figures [ fig:13co channel map ] and [ fig : pv map2 ] , respectively .",
    "comparison between the @xmath2co map and the extinction map indicates that the @xmath2co emission better traces the extinction image than the @xmath0co emission ( figure [ fig:13co integ map]b ) .",
    "two components with different velocities seen in the @xmath0co channel maps are also recognized in the @xmath2co channel maps .",
    "some arcs identified with @xmath0co can be seen in the @xmath2co map , indicating that densities of those arcs are relatively high .",
    "the longitude - velocity diagram shows that only 8 km s@xmath7 component is prominent in the @xmath2co map .",
    "here we compare the co data with dust detected in the @xmath35 map .",
    "while the co lines are emitted only in dense regions ( e.g. , @xmath45 @xmath46 ) , the color excess map traces the total dust column density along the line of sight including diffuse regions in the background ( or foreground ) unrelated to the co emitting volumes . we therefore should remove the background of the @xmath35 map to compare the two dataset directly .    for compact clouds at high latitudes ,",
    "such removal of the background can be easily done by subtracting a constant or by fitting the background with an exponential function of the galactic latitudes @xmath47 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . those methods",
    ", however , do not work well in the case of the clouds in aquila rift , because the region suffers from great complexity over a large extent .",
    "we therefore decided to use the following procedure to remove the background : we first defined the temporary background as the regions without showing apparent small scale - structures in figure [ fig:2mass](a ) , and masked the apparent clouds in the figure by eye - inspection .",
    "we then fitted the unmasked pixels by two dimensional ( 2d ) polynomial function of @xmath48 degree , and subtracted it from the original @xmath35 map to convert the residual map to @xmath49 as @xmath50 where the coefficient is calculated using the reddening law found by @xcite .",
    "we smoothed the resulting @xmath49 map with @xmath51 pixels ( @xmath52 ) , and redefined the background as the regions with @xmath53 mag in the smoothed map .",
    "the background regions defined in this manner is shown in figure[fig:2mass ] ( b ) . to better assess the background , we further fitted the background regions in the figure with a 2d polynomial function with higher orders ( @xmath54 ) , and decided to adopt @xmath55 degree to produce the final @xmath49 map which we use in the following analyses .",
    "we show the map in figure [ fig:2mass](c ) .",
    "the maximum value found in the map is @xmath56 mag , and the @xmath57 noise level of the map is @xmath58 mag .    in order to infer the possible systematic error due to the background removal , we reproduced background maps with different orders of polynomials @xmath59 to derive @xmath49 maps in the same way as described above .",
    "we found that the @xmath49 values in the resulting maps vary by @xmath60 mag at most depending on @xmath54 , which we regard as the uncertainty in our @xmath49 map arising from the background determination .    to compare the co and @xmath49 data directly , we smoothed both of the data to the common 6@xmath5 ( fwhm ) angular resolution .",
    "we excluded some positions from the analyses where the @xmath49 map suffers from a very low angular resolution ( @xmath61 ) .",
    "figures [ fig:13co_vs_av ] and [ fig:12co_vs_av ] show the relations of the @xmath2co and @xmath0co integrated intensities vs. @xmath49 , respectively . in the case of the @xmath2co emission ,",
    "the relation is simple and can be fitted by a linear function , while that of the @xmath0co emission is complex mainly due to the heavy saturation at higher @xmath49 .",
    "this saturation is presumably due to the fact that @xmath0co emission becomes optically thick at higher @xmath49 .    in order to estimate the total masses of clouds that we identified with the molecular data",
    "( see section [ sec : clouds ] ) , we formulate the dependence of @xmath62 on @xmath49 . for this purpose , we fitted the @xmath62 vs. @xmath49 relation by a linear function , @xmath63 where the coefficient best fitting the relation is @xmath64    the relations of @xmath65 vs. @xmath49 and @xmath62 vs. @xmath49 appear to be better fitted with exponential functions . here ,",
    "we attempt to fit these relations with exponential functions . similar attempt has been done by @xcite .",
    "for the @xmath62 vs. @xmath49 relation , we consider the following exponential function , @xmath66    \\ , \\label{eq : exp_13co}\\ ] ] where @xmath67 and @xmath68 are constants .",
    "the coefficients best fitting the relation are obtained as @xmath69 and @xmath70    for the @xmath65 vs. @xmath49 relation , we consider the following exponential function @xmath71   ,   \\label{eq : exp_12co}\\ ] ] where @xmath72 and @xmath73 are constants .",
    "the coefficients best fitting the relation are derived as @xmath74    the relations expressed by equations ( [ eq : exp_13co ] ) and ( [ eq : exp_12co ] ) are shown in figures [ fig:13co_vs_av ] and [ fig:12co_vs_av ] , respectively .",
    "the @xmath23 factor gives a scaling between co luminosity and molecular cloud mass and we use @xmath23 to derive the masses of the clouds identified in the next section .",
    "as shown above , @xmath62 is well correlated with @xmath49 .",
    "therefore , we use @xmath2co emission to identify the clouds and evaluate their masses .",
    "the @xmath10 factor is calculated as @xmath75 where we used equation ( [ eq : linear_13co ] ) and assumed the relation of @xmath76 @xmath77 mag@xmath7 and @xmath78 @xcite .",
    "adopting the above @xmath10 factor , the total molecular gas mass in the observed region is estimated to be about @xmath79 under the assumption of @xmath80 pc .",
    "the @xmath23-factors are usually estimated by using the @xmath0co ( @xmath15 ) line . for our galaxy",
    ", the averaged @xmath81 is evaluated to be @xmath82 @xmath77 k@xmath7 km@xmath7 s with an uncertainty of @xmath83 @xcite .",
    "this values vary from region to region .",
    "for example , @xcite derived the @xmath84-factor of @xmath85 @xmath77 k@xmath7 km@xmath7 s in the taurus molecular cloud . for l1551 , @xcite measured the @xmath86 @xmath77 k@xmath7 km@xmath7 s.    here , we attempt to compare our @xmath84-factor using higher transition with these previous values using the @xmath15 line . we choose the serpens main cloud because this region basically has single component . in constrast ,",
    "the serpens south+w40 region contains multiple - components . the part including serpens main cloud has @xmath87 k km s@xmath7 and @xmath88 k km s@xmath7 . in the part including serpens main cloud , the mean intensity of @xmath0co @xmath89 and line width are evaluated to be 5.6 k and 3.5 km s@xmath7 , respectively . the mean intensity of @xmath2co ( @xmath22 ) and line width are evaluated to be 2.5 k and 2.5 km s@xmath7 , respectively .",
    "adopting the h@xmath90 density of @xmath91 @xmath46 , @xmath92 k , the h@xmath90 column density of @xmath93 @xmath77 ( @xmath94 ) , the co fractional abundance of @xmath95 , and @xmath0co/@xmath2co ratio of 80 , the intensity of @xmath0co ( @xmath15 ) is derived as @xmath20 7 k using ` radex ` @xcite , and thus @xmath96 k km s@xmath7 .",
    "thus , we can convert our @xmath97 to @xmath98 @xmath77 k@xmath7 km@xmath7 s , which is about 2.5 times larger than the standard value of @xcite .",
    "therefore , our @xmath97 value is consistent with the previous estimation , taking into account a large variation of @xmath84-factor values .",
    "as shown in section [ sec : results ] , the correlation between @xmath2co integrated intensity and extinction @xmath49 is reasonably good . therefore , we identify molecular clouds from the @xmath2co data cube and derive their physical quantities such as cloud masses , radii , and line widths .",
    "there are several methods proposed to identify clouds . in the following ,",
    "we apply a new method called ` scimes ` @xcite to our co data cube . `",
    "scimes ` uses the output of ` dendrogram ` @xcite , and identify the structures that are clustering , based on a graph theory .      `",
    "dendrogram ` characterizes the hierarchical structure of the isosurfaces for molecular line data cubes and have been used to identify the structures like cores and clumps @xcite .",
    "however , it is sometimes difficult to characterize the structures identified only with ` dendrogram ` .",
    "recently , @xcite constructed a new method called ` scimes ` ( spectral clustering for interstellar molecular emission segmentation ) to identify clustered structures with similar emission properties as `` clouds '' based on the hierarchical structures identified by ` dendrogram ` . applying ` scimes ` to the @xmath0co ( @xmath15 ) data cube of orion a",
    ", @xcite demonstrated that ` scimes ` can identify the cloud structure well . in the following ,",
    "we apply ` scimes ` to our @xmath2co data cube because @xmath2co trace the cloud structures better than @xmath0co ( see the previous section ) and call a clustered structure identified by ` scimes ` as a `` cloud '' . before applying ` dendrogram ` to our data , we masked pixels whose intensities are about twice the noise level of each observation box .",
    "` dendrogram ` requires three input parameters : ` min_value ` , ` min_delta ` , and ` min_npix ` .",
    "the first parameter , ` min_value ` , specifies the minimum value above which ` dendrogram ` identifies the structures .",
    "the second parameter , ` min_delta ` , is the minimum height required for a structure identified .",
    "the third parameter , ` min_npix ` , is the minimum number of pixels that a structure should contain in order to remain an independent structure .",
    "we apply ` dendrogram ` with the following three input parameters of ` min_value ` = 2 @xmath99 , ` min_delta ` = 3 @xmath99 , and ` min_npix ` = 50 , where @xmath99 is the rms noise level of the data .",
    "the value of ` min_npix ` = 50 is adopted to estimate the physical quantities with reasonable accuracy .",
    "for the ` dendrogram ` analysis , we adopt @xmath100 k. the ` dendrogram ` classifies two types of structures : _ leaves _ and _ branches_. _ branches _ are the structure which split into multiple sub - structures , and _ leaves _ are the structures which do not have any sub - structures .",
    "see @xcite for the detail of the ` dendrogram ` analysis .",
    "then , we applied ` scimes ` with the results of ` dendrogram ` .",
    "we use the element - wise multiplication of the luminosity and the volume matrix for analyzing the clustering of the dendrogram . see @xcite for more details . in total , we identified 61 clouds .",
    "we classified all the structures as clouds . in figure",
    "[ fig : scime ] , we also plot the clouds identified on the @xmath2co velocity - integrated intensity map .",
    "the structure enclosed by each colored curve corresponds to the cloud identified .    in table 2",
    ", we list positions and some physical quantities of the clouds identified such as the cloud velocity @xmath101 , the lengths of major and minor axes , and position angles .",
    "the positions of a cloud are determined as the intensity - weighted positions of the structure identified in the corresponding directions .",
    "major and minor axes of the projected structure onto the galactic longitude - latitude plane , @xmath102 and @xmath103 , are computed from the intensity - weighted second moment in direction of greatest elongation and perpendicular to the major axis in the galactic longitude - latitude plane , respectively .",
    "the position angle is the angle of the major axis in degrees counter - clockwise from the longitude axis .",
    "the region including the w40 hii region and serpens south embedded cluster is assigned as a single cloud .",

    "the two line - width - size relations of @xcite are derived based on the @xmath2co ( @xmath15 ) data of perseus molecular cloud and n@xmath90h@xmath124 ( @xmath15 ) data of the central molecular zone ( cmz ) .",
    "the line - width - size relation of @xcite is derived based on the @xmath0co ( @xmath15 ) data of orion a molecular cloud .",
    "the cloud line - width of perseus by @xcite is about 1.5 times larger than that of orion a by @xcite at a given radius .",
    "our line - width - radius relation is consistent with the @xcite relation , perseus relation by @xcite , and orion a relation by @xcite .",
    "if we adopt a distance of 415 pc , the line - widths of the clouds tend to be smaller than those of @xcite s perseus and orion a relations . for comparison ,",
    "we show the line - width - radius relation of the identified clouds in figure [ fig : line - width - radius]b , where we assumed @xmath125 pc . for both the distances ,",
    "the clouds in cmz have significantly larger line - widths , which support the results of @xcite .",
    "the gravitational boundedness is often evaluated by the virial parameter . in figure",
    "[ fig : virial - mass]a , we plot the virial parameter against the cloud mass . here",
    ", we define the virial parameter as @xmath126 where @xmath127 is constant and we set @xmath128 corresponding to a centrally - condense sphere with @xmath129 . for uniform sphere , @xmath130 .",
    "we did not apply the correction of the thermal line width of the h@xmath90 gas to the line width @xmath131 because its contribution to the total line width should be small as long as the gas temperature stays at around 10 k. majority of the clouds identified has virial parameters close to unity . even for smaller clouds ,",
    "the virial parameters are close to or less than the unity .",
    "this indicates that most of the clouds identified are gravitationally - bounded .",
    "it is worth noting that similarly to the line - width - radius relation , the virial - parameter - mass relation is affected by the adopted distance . if we adopt a distance of 415 pc , the clouds tend to become more gravitationally - bounded . in either way , the majority of the clouds are gravitationally - bounded both for @xmath132 pc and 415 pc .",
    "this may be the reason why the northern part of aquila rift contains several active star - forming regions .",
    "we speculate that interaction of superbubbles , large - scale turbulent flows and/or cloud - cloud collisions may have trigger star formation in this region .",
    "accurate distance measurements are crucial to clarify the dynamical states of the clouds in this region .",
    "finally , we present the mass - radius relation of the identified clouds in figure [ fig : massradius ] , where we adopt a distance of 260 pc and 415 pc for the panels ( a ) and ( b ) , respectively . according to @xcite ,",
    "the clouds forming massive stars ( @xmath133 ) have masses larger than @xmath134 , where we rescaled @xcite s relation by a factor of 1.5 to take into account the difference in the adopted dust parameters , following @xcite .",
    "in addition , @xcite derived the threshold column density of 1 g @xmath77 for massive star formation . for comparison ,",
    "we indicate @xcite s relation and @xcite s criteria for massive star formation in figure [ fig : massradius ] with dashed and dashed - dotted lines , respectively . for both panels , most of the identified clouds",
    "are distributed below the two lines .",
    "most massive clouds are located near @xcite s line . therefore , we suggest that in the observed area , it may be difficult to form massive stars in near future without any external events such as cloud - cloud collision which can increase the local column densities",
    ". in fact , there are only a couple of regions associated with hii regions in the observed area , w40 and mwc 297 .",
    "the exciting stars of the hii regions are late o - type and b - type stars with masses of @xmath135 .",
    "this fact supports the idea that the aquila rift and serpens cloud complexes may not be a massive star - forming region .",
    "we summarize the main results of the present paper as follows .",
    "* we carried out large - scale @xmath0co ( @xmath22 ) , @xmath2co ( @xmath22 ) , and c@xmath24o ( @xmath22 ) mapping observations toward the aquila rift and serpens region of @xmath136 and @xmath4 at a effective angular resolution of 3@xmath5.4 ( @xmath137 pc ) and at a velocity resolution of @xmath20 0.08 km s@xmath7 with the velocity coverage of @xmath8 km s@xmath138 @xmath139 35 km s@xmath7 .",
    "* from the co channel maps , we found a number of arcs , which extend over 1 @xmath11 7 pc .",
    "these structures may have been formed by the superbubbles that converge toward our observed area ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "the velocity integrated intensities of @xmath2co are well correlated to the 2mass visual extinction .",
    "we derived the @xmath10 factor , @xmath140 by comparing the @xmath2co velocity integrated intensity map with the 2mass extinction map .",
    "* there are two distinct components with having different velocities ( @xmath141 km s@xmath7 and 8 km s@xmath7 ) .",
    "they appear to converge at the position of the serpens south and w40 cloud .",
    "this is consistent with the scenario that the collision between flows and clouds triggered active star formation in this region @xcite .",
    "however , there is a possibility that the two components are simply overlapped along the line of sight .",
    "* applying ` dendrogram`+`scimes ` to the @xmath2co data cube , we identified 61 clouds .",
    "* the line - width - radius relation of the clouds reasonably agrees with those of nearby star - forming regions .",
    "however , if we adopt the uniform distance of 415 pc to the region , the agreement of the line - width - radius relations becomes worse .",
    "we speculate that the representative distance to this area is @xmath132 pc , or two components with different distances ( @xmath20 260 pc and @xmath142 415 pc ) are overlapped along the line of sight . *",
    "the virial - parameter - mass relation shows that the clouds identified are close to virial equilibrium with large dispersion .",
    "this may be the reason why the observed area contains several active star forming regions .",
    "this characteristic is contrast to that of the southern part of aquila rift , where the virial parameters tend to be larger than unity @xcite . for a larger assumed distance of @xmath143 415 pc , the majority of the clouds have virial parameter smaller than unity . in other words ,",
    "the clouds appear too gravitationally - bounded .",
    "this research made use of two python packages : ` dendrogram ` @xcite and ` scimes ` version 0.2.0 @xcite .",
    "the former is a python package to characterize the hierarchical structure of molecular cloud .",
    "the latter is a python package to find relevant structures into dendrograms of molecular gas emission using the spectral clustering approach .",
    "we made use of astropy version 1.1.2 python package to make several plots @xcite . without these packages",
    ", we could not complete the analyses presented in this paper .",
    "we would like to express our special appreciation to all the developers of the packages .",
    "we also thank to kazuki tokuda who helped data reduction of the 1.85-m data .",
