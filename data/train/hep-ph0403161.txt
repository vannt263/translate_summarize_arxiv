    "0    the @xmath10 meson electromagnetic transition form factor ( ff ) @xmath11 is among the simplest exclusive processes for investigation of which at large momentum transfer the perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) methods @xcite can be applied . because of the recent cleo data @xcite , where the form factor @xmath12 was measured with high precision , the interest in this process has been renewed .",
    "thus during the last few years for computation of @xmath12 the various theoretical methods and schemes were proposed @xcite .",
    "the aim here is twofold : to elaborate methods for the calculation of @xmath13 within pqcd and , at the same time , to extract from experimental data information on the pion distribution amplitude ( da ) .",
    "the latter , being independent of a specific exclusive process and universal quantity , is an important input ingredient in studying various processes that involve the pion .",
    "it is known that in experiments the @xmath1 transition was explored at momentum transfers of @xmath14 , which are far from the asymptotic limit @xmath15 , where the pqcdfactorization formula with the pion leading - twist asymptotic da leads to reliable predictions . in the present experimentally accessible energy regimes ,",
    "power - suppressed corrections @xmath16 play an important role in explaining the experimental data @xcite .",
    "there are numerous sources of power corrections to @xmath12 .",
    "for example , the pion higher - twist ( ht ) da s and higher fock states generate such corrections .",
    "power corrections can also originate from the end - point regions @xmath17 as a result of the integration of the pqcd factorization expression with the qcd running coupling @xmath18 [ @xmath19 over the pion s quark longitudinal momentum fraction @xmath20 .",
    "in fact , in order to reduce the higher - order corrections to a physical quantity and improve the convergence of the corresponding perturbation series , the renormalization scale @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) , i.e. , the argument of the qcd coupling , in a feynman diagram should be set equal to the virtual parton s squared four - momentum @xcite . in the exclusive processes the scale @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) chosen",
    "this way inevitably depends on the longitudinal momentum fractions carried by the hadron constituents . for the photon - meson transition we have @xmath23 and @xmath24 , because at two leading order diagrams of the partonic subprocess @xmath25 , absolute values of the virtual quark and antiquark squared four - momenta are determined by these expressions .",
    "but then the pqcd factorization formula diverges , since @xmath26 [ @xmath27 suffers from end - point @xmath28 [ @xmath29 singularity .",
    "the running coupling ( rc ) method solves this problem by using a borel transformation and applying the principal value prescription . as a result ,",
    "one obtains the borel resummed expression for the @xmath1 transition ff , which contains power - suppressed corrections .",
    "the rc method in conjunction with the infrared ( ir ) renormalon calculus was used for computation of such power corrections to the @xmath1 and @xmath30 transition ff s @xcite , to the electromagnetic ff s of the light mesons @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) @xcite , as well as to the gluon - gluon-@xmath33 meson vertex function @xcite .    in the present work we compute power corrections to the @xmath1 transition ff employing the version of the hard - scattering amplitude symmetrized under replacement @xmath5 .",
    "the symmetrization procedure is important for exclusive processes with two external photons ( gluons ) in the hard - scattering feynman diagrams , because it allows one to treat within the rc method both virtual and real photons ( gluons ) on the same footing .",
    "the latter is required in order to consider the @xmath34 and @xmath35 transitions in a unifying way , i.e. , to get in the limits @xmath36 ( @xmath37 is the asymmetry parameter ) from the @xmath38 transition ff @xmath39 the ff @xmath40 of the @xmath1 transition .",
    "the advocated method was used in our previous work @xcite to investigate the virtual and on - shell gluon-@xmath33 meson transitions . in what follows",
    "we refer to this approach as the symmetrized rc ( src ) method .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",

    "iv we perform numerical computations and from comparison of our predictions with the cleo data extract constraints on the parameters @xmath44 and @xmath45 in the pion da s with one and two nonasymptotic terms , respectively .",
