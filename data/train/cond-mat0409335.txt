    "the properties of the superconducting state of conventional , single - band , electron - phonon superconductors differ markedly from bcs predictions.@xcite however , they are well - described within isotropic eliashberg theory with a single electron - phonon spectral density @xmath3 for the average interaction over the fermi surface .",
    "this function is accurately known from inversion of tunneling data.@xcite in many cases , the @xmath3 has also been calculated from first principle electronic band structure calculations extended to include the electron - phonon interaction , sometimes with the phonons taken directly from inelastic neutron scattering measurements . in many cases ,",
    "such results agree very well with the corresponding tunneling data . while it is to be noted that , in principle , the electron - phonon spectral density for the various electrons on the fermi surface is anisotropic leading to energy gap anisotropy@xcite , this feature often does not play a prominent role because , in many instances , the electronic mean free path is much smaller than the coherence length . in such circumstances ,",
    "a fermi surface average of the electron - phonon spectral density can be used .",
    "nevertheless , corrections due to gap anisotropy have been identified and studied in the past@xcite , often , but not always , in a separable anisotropic model.@xcite    the history of two - band superconductivity@xcite and of mgb@xmath2 ( with @xmath4 k@xcite ) in particular@xcite is somewhat different . to our knowledge ,",
    "as yet , there exists no inversion@xcite of tunneling data from which the electron - phonon interaction is determined . in fact , it has been noted@xcite that this may well never be possible in mgb@xmath2 because of its two - band nature which requires a microscopic description in terms of four separate electron - phonon spectral functions @xmath5 , where @xmath6 ( or 1 , 2 ) , with the two - dimensional @xmath7 band having the largest electron - phonon coupling . the three - dimensional @xmath8 band on its own would have a smaller value of @xmath0 , the critical temperature , although it has a higher value of the electron density of states at the fermi energy .    in the absence of tunneling data giving reliable information on the fundamental kernels entering the two - band eliashberg equations , first principle band structure calculations of @xmath9 in mgb@xmath2",
    "have been used to compute superconducting properties ( for example , @xcite ) . to do this",
    ", it is also necessary to know the coulomb pseudopotential repulsions @xmath10 which are different for various indices ( @xmath11 ) , but these have also been calculated .",
    "good agreement with experiment is obtained in this way for the properties considered so far , more explicitly , the specific heat@xcite , the penetration depth@xcite , and the anisotropy in the two gaps , as well as their temperature dependence . for the penetration depth , impurity scattering can be important , and in and out of plane orientation of the magnetic field are different@xcite .",
    "in this paper , we use the band theory information on @xmath9 and @xmath10 in mgb@xmath2 to calculate the critical temperature , the energy gap with its anisotropy and temperature dependence , and other thermodynamic properties , as well as the penetration depth , giving particular emphasis to strong coupling corrections .",
    "further to our discussion of mgb@xmath2 , we provide a full listing of calculated dimensionless bcs ratios , now modified by both the anisotropy and the strong coupling effects in mgb@xmath2 , and make comparison with experiment .",
    "we also consider effects of variations in microscopic parameters away from those of mgb@xmath2 , as well as impurity scattering - intraband and interband . to this end",
    ", we reduce the two - band eliashberg equations , which fully account for retardation , in the two - square - well approximation ( also called the @xmath12 model ) .",
    "this leads to simple _",
    "renormalized _ bcs ( rbcs ) forms which , when compared to our full numerical eliashberg results , allow us to identify the strong coupling corrections which we find to be significant even for mgb@xmath2 .    when considering variations in microscopic parameters away from those of mgb@xmath2 , we place particular emphasis on two limiting cases : the limit of small interband coupling and the opposite case , when the intraband coupling is zero and the superconductivity is due to the interband coupling alone , a case discussed in the early work of shul _",
    "et al._@xcite .",
    "we also consider the special case when the intraband coupling in the second band is repulsive .",
    "the limit of small interband coupling is particularly interesting because it allows us to understand how the offdiagonal terms lead to the integration of otherwise two completely independent and non - communicating superconducting bands with separate transition temperatures @xmath13 .",
    "in this regard , we find that @xmath14 and @xmath15 behave very differently with 21 the most effective variable at integrating the two systems and 12 the most effective at changing the critical temperature .",

    "i.e _ , the one with the smaller of the two @xmath13 values .",
    "more specifically , surprisingly small values of the mass renormalization parameter @xmath17 , as compared with @xmath18 and @xmath19 , have a large effect on the region of @xmath16 .",
    "we also find that relatively modest values of the interband impurity scattering rates lead to the significant integration of the two bands .",
    "even when the bands are well - integrated , in the sense that little trace of a second sharp transition at @xmath16 remains , there still exist important modifications of the usual one - band bcs results because of the two distinct bands . as an example , the bcs dimensionless universal ratios now depend on the ratio of the electronic density of states at the fermi energy of the two bands .",
    "simple analytic expressions for these ratios are derived , which provide insight into the physics underlying two - band superconductivity and guidance as to how these results are to be interpreted .    in section",

    "vi , we deal briefly with the less realistic case of zero intraband electron - phonon coupling , where the superconductivity is due only to the interband piece .",
    "conclusions are found in section vii .    finally , in light of the recent developments in other areas of superconductivity and correlated electrons , we wish to emphasize that our use of the term `` gap anisotropy '' here is in reference to the difference in the magnitudes of the two gaps , each of which are isotropic s - wave in this work , and",

    "our middle set of curves obey this constraint , but we have ignored it for the other curves in order to illustrate the general behaviour of each individual type of scattering separately . as found for the @xmath79 s , the effect of @xmath75 and that of @xmath78 on @xmath0 are quite different .",
    "the quantity @xmath75 represents scattering from band 1 to band 2 and leads to pairbreaking much like paramagnetic impurities in the one - band case .",

    "carbotte@xcite have found for the specific case of pb , the classic strong coupling material , that the @xmath12 model overestimates the initial slope of the drop in @xmath0 value , with increasing impurity scattering .",
    "the physics is simple . for strong coupling , @xmath89 is larger than its bcs value _",
    "i.e. _ , the gap is bigger than expected on the basis of its @xmath0 .",
    "this is because as @xmath31 is increased , that part of the inelastic scattering which corresponds to the real ( as opposed to virtual ) processes , which are pairbreaking , increases and @xmath0 is reduced below the value it would be without . as a result ,",
    "the initial drop in @xmath0 value with increasing impurity content is not as large in strong as in weak coupling because the system has a larger gap which is more robust against impurities .",
    "the same applies to interband scattering in a two - band superconductor .",

    "mitrovi also presents functional derivatives for ordinary impurities@xcite and his findings compliment our calculations here .",
    "in addition , as low frequency phonons act like ordinary impurities , the previous work by mitrovi on functional derivatives@xcite for the electron - phonon spectral functions also confirms our impurity results by comparison with the behaviour of the low frequency part of the functional derivatives for 12 versus 21 .    finally",

    "otherwise additional corrections for the other channels may exist but there would be no merit in such complexity of including these corrections over doing the full numerical calculations with the eliashberg equations .",
    "it is expected that in real systems , @xmath18 is large relative to the other parameters and hence dominates the strong coupling aspect of the result . however",

    "more importantly , the value of the upper gap ratio increases above its bcs ratio 3.53 and can reach 4.6 in renormalized bcs , a feature which comes from the two - band nature of the system . comparing the dotted curves to the solid circles for @xmath94",

    "note finally that the relative size of the superfluid density in each band will vary with @xmath108 and @xmath163 , neither of which have been properly accounted for in this figure , as we wished to illustrate solely the effect of @xmath46 and @xmath17 on the issue of integration of the bands and modification of @xmath0 .",
    "( 250,200 )    the changes , with the offdiagonal elements @xmath46 and @xmath17 , in the temperature dependence of the upper and lower gaps are closely correlated with those just described for the superfluid density .",
    "this is documented in fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] which has two frames . in all cases @xmath55 and @xmath56 . in the top frame , @xmath86 equal to 0.0001 ( solid ) , 0.01 ( short - dashed ) , and 0.1 ( long - dashed ) .",
    "the various pairs of curves apply to the upper and lower gap ratios .",
    "note the long tails in the short - dashed curve ( lower gap ) , still small but extending to @xmath233 .",
    "for the long - dashed curve , the lower and upper gaps now have very similar temperature dependences , but these are not yet identical to bcs .",
    "we have already seen in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] , for the specific case of mgb@xmath2 , that the lower gap falls below bcs at temperatures above @xmath234 , which is expected when it is viewed as an evolution out of two separate gaps , with two @xmath0 values , due to increasing the offdiagonal coupling . in the lower frame ,",
    "we show results for @xmath224 ( dot - dashed ) and @xmath227 ( dotted ) . again , as expected , the two dash - dotted curves show distinct temperature dependences while for the dotted they are very similar .",
    "( 250,200 )    a very similar story emerges when interband impurity scattering is considered .",
    "results are given in fig .",
    "[ fig12 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig13 ] .",
    "[ fig12 ] has three frames . here",
    ", @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and @xmath219 , with our lorentzian electron - phonon spectral functions @xmath9 described previously . the top frame deals with the temperature dependence of the normalized superconducting state electronic specific heat @xmath217 .",
    "the middle frame gives the gap ratios of @xmath94 and @xmath102 and thus the curves come in pairs , with @xmath235 . and",
    "the bottom frame shows the deviation function @xmath144 for the thermodynamic critical magnetic field .",
    "what is varied in the various curves is the interband impurity scattering rate @xmath77 ( taken to be equal in value , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath236 ) . the solid curve , which clearly shows two transitions , is for @xmath88 .",
    "it is to be noted first , that in all cases , offdiagonal impurity scattering changes the value of the critical temperature , reducing it to less than 0.8 of its pure value in the case of the dot - dashed curve .",
    "this decrease in @xmath0 does not translate , however , into a steady decrease in the specific heat jump at @xmath0 .",
    "we see that while the jump initially decreases with increasing @xmath77 , eventually it increases and is largest for the dot - dashed curve . both watanabe and kita@xcite and mishonov _",
    "et al._@xcite , using only an unrenormalized bcs model , find an increase with impurity scattering and no initial decrease as is found in the full eliashberg calculation .",
    "this is a clear illustration that , at minimum , a renormalized bcs formula needs to be used to capture the qualitative trend and full eliashberg theory is required if one wishes to be quantitative .",
    "it is also clear that as interband impurity scattering increases , the jump in the specific heat at the second transition , seen in the solid curve , is rapidly washed out and little remains of this anomaly in the dot - dashed curve .",
    "even the long - dashed curve shows little structure in this region , in analogy to what we found to hold for the case of increasing the offdiagonal electron - phonon elements .",
    "note , however , there remains a point of inflection which has moved to higher temperature .",
    "such a shift of the inflection point can also be brought about by increasing the offdiagonal @xmath105 s as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] .    the temperature dependence of the gap ratios ( middle frame of fig .  [ fig12 ] ) also mirror what we found in fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] .",
    "the dashed curves exhibit quite distinct temperature dependences between @xmath94 and @xmath102 while this is no longer the case for the pair of long - dashed curves .",
    "note that , as compared to the solid curve , the anisotropy in the gaps for the long - dashed curve has been reduced considerably .",
    "the upper gap has decreased and the lower increased even more .",
    "the washing out of the gap anisotropy by offdiagonal impurity scattering is expected and has been studied theoretically@xcite and experimentally@xcite . for carbon doping ,",
    "the gaps are seen to merge at about 13% for which @xmath0 has been reduced to about 20 k with the large gap reducing to its bcs value and the smaller gap moving upwards only very little in contrast to our model calculations for which the lower gap changes relatively more and isotropy is reached at about a 30% reduction in @xmath0 .",
    "of course , as one dopes , the electronic density of states and the electron - phonon parameters also change@xcite , and one needs to include these in addition to any interband scattering .",
    "finally , the effect of interband ordinary impurity scattering on the deviation function , shows a behaviour similar to that found for paramagnetic impurities in one - band superconductors@xcite .",
    "initially , as in the other properties , the impurities smear the structure related to the second transition temperature ( in this case the cusp feature in the solid curve ) and once the two bands are fairly well integrated , then like paramagnetic impurities , the effect here is to keep the minimum at the same temperature but change its value .",
    "a key difference though is that , in the case of paramagnetic impurities in one - band , the extremum in the curve moves from positive ( and strong coupling ) to negative ( and weak coupling ) because the gap is being reduced towards zero . here , with the two bands ,",
    "the impurities do not reduce @xmath0 , and hence the gap , to zero , but rather to a finite value related to the washing out of the anisotropy between the two bands , and hence the extremum in this case will move from negative ( where it is positioned due to large anisotropy ) to smaller values , reflecting this .    ( 250,200 )    next we turn to the results given in fig .",
    "[ fig13 ] , which shows the temperature dependence of the superfluid density for various values of impurity parameters .",
    "again , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and @xmath219 with the lorentzian spectra . what is illustrated in these four frames",
    "is how very different the effect of @xmath237 , @xmath238 , @xmath75 , and @xmath78 are .",
    "the solid curve is for reference and is the pure case . once again , for the case of varying @xmath75 and @xmath78 , we have violated the constraint that their ratio must be fixed by the ratio of the density of states .",
    "this we can do theoretically to decouple and , therefore , illustrate the effects of these different scattering channels , but in real systems , they would be constrained and the net result would be a combination of the effects from both channels . the top left frame shows the effect on the superfluid density of increasing the impurity scattering in the first band ( intraband scattering ) .",
    "such impurities reduce the superfluid density in band 1 while leaving band 2 unaltered . in the lower right - hand frame",
    "it is the superfluid density in the second band that is reduced , leaving the first unchanged .",
    "@xmath0 is unaffected by intraband impurity scattering in isotropic s - wave superconductors due to anderson s theorem .",
    "the top right - hand frame shows that increasing @xmath75 reduces the critical temperature as well as reduces the superfluid density in band one without , however , having much effect on the second band .",
    "the kink associated with the rise of the second band is hardly changed as @xmath75 is not the integrating variable , rather it is @xmath78 which integrates rapidly the bands as seen in the lower left - hand frame . however , in this case , the critical temperature is hardly changed and there is little change to the curve above @xmath239 .",
    "while the two - band nature in mgb@xmath2 , driven by the electron - phonon interaction , is well - established , there have been many reports of possible two - band superconductivity in other systems , including the conventional a15 compound nb@xmath240sn@xcite . with a @xmath241 k and a main gap @xmath242 ,",
    "there is specific heat evidence for a second gap at @xmath243 .",

    "a small gap is induced in the second band . as two - band superconductivity is likely to be a widespread phenomenon , not confined to electron - phonon systems , it seems appropriate to investigate further an extended range of parameter space for the @xmath79 s and in particular the possibility that the offdiagonal elements are the dominant mechanism for superconductivity .",

    "( [ eq : u ] ) for the gap anisotropy @xmath251 written as : @xmath252 this equation gives @xmath113 in terms of @xmath149 and @xmath61 .",

    "for @xmath258 , as an example , @xmath259 and @xmath260 , which is very large .",
    "this occurs for @xmath261 , using @xmath262 , which is in the weak coupling regime .",
    "however , to achieve an upper gap ratio value greater than 11 or so , will correspond an unrealistically small value of @xmath190 ( of order @xmath263 , for example ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig14 ] , we show results in the upper frame for @xmath210 versus @xmath46 for various @xmath17 values . in the lower frame ,",
    "we show @xmath113 versus @xmath46 .",
    "the difference between fig .",
    "[ fig14 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] shows that large values of @xmath96 are more naturally obtained in the pure offdiagonal regime and are associated as well with small values of @xmath113 and the weak coupling regime .",
    "this latter feature implies that there will be no further strong coupling corrections to an already large gap ratio .",
    "we have also calculated the thermodynamics and superfluid density in this regime , for a range of parameters , but have found these properties to show quite ordinary behaviour and have discovered no new physics . for the sake of brevity , we present none of these results but instead note that in this limit the @xmath215 s are @xmath264 = \\frac{1}{2}\\biggl[1+\\frac{1}{\\alpha^*}\\biggr],\\\\ \\chi_2 & = & \\frac{1}{2}\\biggl[1+\\frac{\\bar\\lambda_{12}}{\\bar\\lambda_{21}}\\biggr ]   = \\frac{1}{2}(1+\\alpha^*),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath265 , and hence , the various dimensionless ratios are : @xmath266\\ ] ] and @xmath267 and @xmath268 where @xmath269 . the ratio for the zero temperature critical field of eq .",
    "( [ eq : hratio ] ) does not change its form and so is not repeated here .",
    "these ratios behave , qualitatively , no differently from what we found in section iii .",
    "a difference worth noting is the following . in linear order",
    ", the effect of interband impurity scattering on @xmath0 takes the form ( [ eq : tcimp]-[eq : rhoimp ] ) : @xmath270 ^ 2 \\label{eq : odtcimp}\\ ] ] which is always negative and larger for paramagnetic than for normal impurities .",
    "it can also be very large for @xmath271 .",
    "this is another distinction between pure offdiagonal coupling and mgb@xmath2 , for example . in obtaining ( [ eq :",
    "odtcimp ] ) , we have used the fact that @xmath272 and @xmath273 .",
    "we have calculated thermodynamics , gap anisotropy and penetration depth for a two - band eliashberg superconductor . for the parameters appropriate to mgb@xmath2 which are obtained from first principle band structure calculations of the electron - phonon spectral functions , we find good agreement with the existing experimental data .",
    "we reduce the eliashberg equations to a renormalized bcs form by application of the two - square - well approximation .",
    "comparison of these results with those from the full eliashberg equations allows us to determine strong coupling corrections , which we find to be significant in mgb@xmath2 . when the parameters for the electron - phonon interaction are moved away from those specific to mgb@xmath2",
    ", the strong coupling corrections can become much larger , and superconducting properties reflect this fact , as well as the change in anisotropy between the bands . within the @xmath12 approximation",
    ", we derive simple analytic expressions for the various dimensionless bcs ratios which would be universal in the one - band case , but are not in the two - band one .",
    "they depend on the anisotropy and particularly on the ratio of the electronic density of states in the two bands .",
    "the anisotropy in the ratio of the two gaps at zero temperature is investigated and is found to increase as @xmath19 is reduced and made repulsive , in which case the existence of superconductivity in the first band , and the offdiagonal coupling to it , induces a gap in a band which would , on its own , not be superconducting .",
    "we have paid particular attention to the limit of nearly decoupled bands , _",
    "i.e. _ , small interband coupling , with the superconductivity originating from @xmath18 and @xmath19 in the first and second band , respectively .",
    "when @xmath274 , there are two transitions at @xmath216 and @xmath16 and two specific heat jumps .",
    "as the interband coupling is turned on , the two bands become integrated and the second transition smears .",
    "we have found that the two parameters , @xmath46 and @xmath17 , have very different effects on the smearing of the second transition and on @xmath0 .",
    "@xmath46 largely modifies @xmath0 , reducing it , whereas , @xmath17 alters the lower temperature region around the second transition . only very small values of @xmath17 , as compared with @xmath18 and @xmath19 , are needed to cause large changes in the region around @xmath16 .",
    "it was found that a small amount of interband impurity scattering can also significantly smear the second transition , and so reduce the distinction between the two bands .",
    "however , even when the two bands are well - integrated and a sharp second transition is no longer easily discernible , this does not imply that the superconducting properties become those of a one - band superconductor .",
    "anisotropy remains and this affects properties .    in view of the possible widespread occurrence of two - band superconductivity , even for systems with exotic mechanism not necessarily due to the electron - phonon interaction , we deemed it of interest to consider the case of zero intraband coupling , @xmath246 , with superconductivity due only to the interband @xmath46 and @xmath17 , which need not have the same value . when these are very different , the resulting gaps are quite different from each other and the ratio of @xmath94 to @xmath0 can become large particularly in the weak coupling limit . this is a distinguishing feature of pure offdiagonal coupling .",
    "another distinguishing feature is the possibility of a rapid reduction of @xmath0 towards zero by interband impurity scattering , as compared with the case for which the diagonal elements play the leading role .",
