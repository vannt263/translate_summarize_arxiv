    "the physics of gravitational accretion and radiation pressure provides one natural timescale , the @xmath2-folding time @xmath7 years of a black hole accreting mass with a radiative efficiency @xmath8 and shining at a fraction @xmath9 of its eddington luminosity @xcite .",
    "but while @xmath10 and @xmath11 are plausible values for a quasar , it is possible that black holes accrete much of their mass while radiating at much lower efficiency , or at a small fraction of @xmath12 . the task of determining @xmath6 must therefore be approached empirically .",
    "the observed evolution of the quasar luminosity function imposes a strong upper limit on @xmath6 of about @xmath13 years , since the whole quasar population rises and falls over roughly this interval ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . the lifetime of individual quasars could be much shorter than the lifetime of the quasar population , however , and lower limits of @xmath14 years rest on indirect arguments , such as the requirement that quasars maintain their ionizing luminosity long enough to explain the proximity effect in the ly@xmath15 forest ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "a typical lifetime @xmath16 years would imply that quasars are rare phenomena , arising in at most a small fraction of high - redshift galaxies .",
    "conversely , a lifetime as low as @xmath14 years would imply that quasars are quite common , suggesting that a large fraction of present - day galaxies went through a brief quasar phase in their youth .",
    "the comoving space density @xmath17 of active quasars at redshift @xmath18 is proportional to @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the comoving space density of quasar hosts .",
    "`` demographic '' studies of the local black hole population ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have opened up one route to determining the typical quasar lifetime : counting the present - day descendants of the quasar central engines in order to estimate @xmath21 and thus constrain @xmath6 by matching @xmath17 . roughly speaking",
    ", the ubiquity of black holes in nearby galaxies suggests that quasars are common and that @xmath6 is likely in the range @xmath22  @xmath23 ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , as @xcite emphasize , the lifetime estimated in this way depends crucially on the way one links the mass of a present - day black hole to the luminosity of a high - redshift quasar , which in turn depends on assumptions about the growth of black hole masses since the quasar epoch via mergers or low - efficiency accretion .    in this paper",
    "we propose an alternative route to the quasar lifetime , using measurements of high - redshift quasar clustering .",
    "the underlying idea goes back to the work of @xcite and @xcite : in models of structure formation based on gravitational instability of gaussian primordial fluctuations , the rare , massive objects are highly biased tracers of the underlying mass distribution , while more common objects are less strongly biased .",
    "therefore , a longer quasar lifetime @xmath6 should imply a more clustered quasar population , provided that luminous quasars reside in massive hosts .",
    "the specific calculations that we present in this paper use the press - schechter ( 1974 ; hereafter ps ) approximation for the mass function of dark matter halos and the ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter mw ) and @xcite approximations for the bias of these halos as a function of mass .",
    "the path from clustering to quasar lifetime has its own uncertainties ; in particular , our predictions for quasar clustering will rely on the assumption that the luminosity of a quasar during its active phase is a monotonically increasing function of the mass of its host dark matter halo .",
    "however , the assumptions in the clustering approach are at least very different from those in the black hole mass function approach , and they can be tested empirically by detailed studies of quasar clustering as a function of luminosity and redshift .",
    "our theoretical model of quasar clustering follows a general trend in which the study of quasar activity is embedded in the broader context of galaxy formation and gravitational growth of structure ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this paper also continues a theme that is prominent in recent work on the clustering of lyman - break galaxies , namely that the clustering of high - redshift objects is a good tool for understanding the physics of their formation and evolution ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "our model of the quasar population is idealized , but by focusing on a simple calculation with clearly defined predictions , we hope to highlight the link between quasar lifetime and clustering strength . after presenting the theoretical results , we will draw some inferences from existing estimates of the quasar correlation length .",
    "however , our study is motivated mainly by the anticipation of vastly improved measurements of quasar clustering from the 2df and sloan quasar surveys ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these measurements can test various hypotheses about the origin of quasar activity , including our primary assumption of a monotonic relation between quasar luminosity and host halo mass .",
    "if this assumption proves valid , then the first major physical result to emerge from the 2df and sloan measurements of high - redshift quasar clustering will be a new determination of the typical quasar lifetime .",
    "we adopt a simple model of the high - redshift quasar population that is , doubtless , idealized , but which should be reasonably accurate for our purpose of computing clustering strength as a function of quasar lifetime .",
    "we assume that all quasars reside in dark matter halos and that a given halo hosts at most one active quasar at a time .",
    "the first assumption is highly probable , since a dark matter collapse is necessary to seed the growth of a black hole , and the second should be a fair approximation at high redshift , where the masses of large halos are comparable to the masses of individual galaxy halos today .",
    "our strongest and most important assumption is that the luminosity of a quasar during its active phase is monotonically related to the mass of its host dark matter halo , and that all sufficiently massive halos host an active quasar at some point .",
    "more precisely , we assume that an absolute - magnitude limited sample of quasars at redshift @xmath18 samples the most massive halos present at that redshift , and that the probability that a halo above the minimum host mass @xmath24 harbors an active quasar at any given time is @xmath25 , where @xmath6 is the average quasar lifetime and @xmath26 is the halo lifetime .",
    "we can therefore compute the value of @xmath24 for a quasar population with comoving space density @xmath17 from the condition @xmath27 we compute @xmath28 using the ps approximation , and we compute the bias of halos with @xmath29 using the mw approximation .",
    "a connection between quasar luminosity and host halo mass is plausible on theoretical grounds  the cores of massive halos collapse early , giving black holes time to grow , and these halos provide larger gas supplies for fueling activity .",
    "it is also plausible on empirical grounds  local black hole masses are correlated with the host spheroid luminosity @xcite , which in turn is correlated with stellar velocity dispersion @xcite .",
    "a precisely monotonic relation is certainly an idealization , and we explore the effects of relaxing this assumption in  [ sec : sen ] .",
    "the assumption of an approximately monotonic relation can be tested empirically by searching for the predicted relation between clustering strength and luminosity , as we discuss in  [ sec : pros ] .",
    "the ubiquity of black holes in luminous local spheroids supports our assumption that all sufficiently massive halos go through a quasar phase .",
    "however , once the quasar space density declines at @xmath30 , the occurrence of quasar activity must be determined by fueling rather than by the mere existence of a massive black hole , so it is not plausible that all large halos host a _ low - redshift _ quasar .",
    "we therefore apply our model only to the high - redshift quasar population , at @xmath31 .",
    "we implicitly assume that a quasar turns on at a random point in the life of its host halo .",
    "in this sense , our model differs subtly from that of @xcite , who assume that a quasar turns on when the halo is formed , but this difference is unlikely to have a significant effect on the predicted clustering .",
    "@xcite pointed out that a longer quasar lifetime would correspond to stronger quasar clustering because of the association with rarer peaks of the mass distribution , but they did not calculate this relation in detail .",
    "because the quasar lifetime enters our calculation only through the probability @xmath25 that a halo hosts an active quasar at a given time , it makes no difference whether the quasar shines continuously or turns on and off repeatedly with a short duty cycle ( as argued recently by @xcite ) . for our purposes , @xmath6 is the total time that the quasar shines at close to its peak luminosity .",
    "we also assume that quasars radiate isotropically , with a beaming factor @xmath32 , but because a smaller beaming factor simply changes the conversion between observed surface density and intrinsic comoving space density , all of our results can be scaled to smaller average beaming factors by replacing @xmath6 with @xmath33 .",

    "<S> although the population of luminous quasars rises and falls over a period of @xmath0 years , the typical lifetime of individual quasars is uncertain by several orders of magnitude . </S>",

    "<S> , the @xmath2-folding timescale of an eddington luminosity black hole with accretion efficiency @xmath3 , corresponds to a quasar correlation length @xmath4 in low - density cosmological models at @xmath5 ; this value is consistent with current clustering measurements , but these have large uncertainties . </S>",
    "<S> high - precision clustering measurements from the 2df and sloan quasar surveys will test our key assumption of a tight correlation between quasar luminosity and host halo mass , and if this assumption holds then they should determine @xmath6 to a factor of three or better . </S>",
    "<S> an accurate determination of the quasar lifetime will show whether supermassive black holes acquire most of their mass during high - luminosity accretion , and it will show whether the black holes in the nuclei of typical nearby galaxies were once the central engines of high - luminosity quasars . </S>"
