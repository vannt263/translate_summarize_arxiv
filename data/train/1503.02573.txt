    "we consider a mathematical model of mosquito population dynamics within the framework similar to @xcite , where the continuous population evolution is formulated as initial value problem ( ivp ) of non - autonomous system @xmath0,\\,{\\text{\\textbf{x}}}(0)={\\text{\\textbf{x}}}_0\\succeq { \\mathbb{0}}.\\ ] ] in natural setting , the system equation contains a hyperparameter @xmath1 whose appearance describes a collection of measurable intrinsic factors : e.g. natural births , natural deaths , age - based transitions . studying the qualitative behavior of the solution , one demands the fluctuation phenomena within those factors to be distinguished as those of which essentially depend on time . as a consequence of uncertainty in environmental condition , some elements of @xmath1 differ in time with possible seasonal trends : monotonic increasing , monotonic decreasing , oscillating , or even fluctuating with brownian - type movement .",
    "many references have even hypothesized that such intrinsic factors may behave with periodic streamline in many cases due to environmental changes : cf .",
    "ironically , in a national integrated mosquito management programme , for example , bonds @xcite summarized that fluctuating meteorology ( raindrop , wind speed , air temperature , air humidity , terrestrial radiation , etc ) had been out of concern during deployment of control devices in the field .",

    "this dependency of parameters in time brings the model into non - autonomous groundwork . as an extrinsic factor",
    ", the control measure @xmath2 is incorporated into the system for which it plays as a system regulator towards achievement of the general objectives : i.e. minimizing both population and cost for the control . in other words , the following objective functional @xmath3 attains its minimum for given weighting constants @xmath4 and @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 .    in line with matching the underlying dynamical process of the solution with that from empirical measurement , we demonstrate estimation of some undetermined parameters in the model by firstly settling them as random variables . then by exploiting information from the system",
    ", one can characterize the solution as a handling function expressed in terms of such random variables .",
    "we utilize the property of maximum likelihood ( ml ) and least square ( ls ) which is basically minimization of the difference between the handling function value - points and the measured data over all possible values of undetermined parameters in a bounded set .",
    "the next problem arises when analytical solution of the system , or eventually the handling function , can not be determined explicitly due to complexity of the equation . for this reason ,",

    "recently , several regimes in coping with ml for parameter estimation within epidemic dynamical system have been explored e.g. in @xcite .",
    "there have been numerous mathematical papers discussing application of optimal control scenario to the mosquito reduction issue ( see e.g. @xcite and some references therein ) .",
