    "a peculiar feature of the standard model ( sm ) is that none of the gauge bosons carry baryon or lepton number",
    ". many extensions of the sm predicted the existence of exotic particles that carry global quantum numbers , among then leptoquarks and bileptons .",
    "the bileptons are defined as bosons carrying two units of lepton number and are presents in @xmath5 grand unification theory and in the 3 - 3 - 1 model , for example .",
    "in particular , the 3 - 3 - 1 model in its minimal version @xcite includes singly ( @xmath6 ) and doubly charged ( @xmath2 ) bileptons whereas neutral and single - charged bileptons are present in the model version with right - handed neutrinos @xcite .",
    "in addition to these new gauge bosons , there are new quarks that carry two units of lepton number , called leptoquarks .",
    "it is interesting to study the prospects for the detection of bileptons at linear and hadron colliders because its existence leads to unique experimental signature .",
    "one expect that the lhc will spoil new physics and show up the existence of new particles .",
    "we guess that bilepton are among the new discoveries and we intend , in this work , to extend our analysis about the production of bileptons at the lhc .    it is known the effort of lhc experiments to search for new charged gauge boson .",
    "atlas and cms established model dependent bounds for @xmath7 mass , by analyzing lepton - antineutrino production from a sequential @xmath7 particle , having the same coupling to fermions as the ordinary sm gauge boson @xcite . in the present work",
    "we explore lepton - neutrino production from a singly charged bilepton with peculiar properties and couplings for which the experimental mass limits do not apply .",
    "we also include the production of a pair of same - sign lepton related to doubly charged bilepton contribution .",
    "there are no background for these processes however we consider the production of leptons from sm contribution that can be misidentified with the signal and we show that they can be easily eliminated by convenient cuts .",
    "there are some previous works about the production of charged bileptons in the literature .",
    "some authors established model independent bounds for mass and couplings from low energy data and linear collider experiments . using two versions of the 3 - 3 - 1 model , h. n. long _ et al . _",
    "@xcite studied the bilepton production in @xmath8 collider .",
    "the contribution of doubly charged bileptons to four lepton production at linear collider was considered in @xcite . for",
    "a detailed review about bileptons from an independent model approach see @xcite .    from the same model b. dion _",
    "@xcite obtained the total cross section for the production of a pair of bilepton in hadron colliders , whereas in ref .",
    "@xcite the authors studied the production of just one bilepton associated with an exotic quark .",
    "more recently , we consider two versions of this model to analyze singly and doubly charged bilepton pair production for lhc energies @xcite .",
    "it is shown that the total cross section for vector bilepton production is three orders of magnitude larger than for scalar pair production for @xmath9 tev and @xmath10 tev .",
    "for that reason we do not include the scalar bilepton contribution in the present paper .",
    "a recent result was obtained by one of us for the decay of a 3 - 3 - 1 higgs candidate into two photons where the vector bilepton play an important role @xcite . their analysis show",
    "that a bilepton doublet with mass @xmath11 gev and an @xmath12 branching ratio of the higgs boson into invisible states can reasonably fit the available data .",
    "it was also shown that bileptons are associated with leptoquark production @xcite .    here",
    "we analyze the contribution of bileptons to lepton production .",
    "we consider an unexplored bilepton mass domain accessible by the lhc ( from @xmath13 to @xmath14 gev ) by respecting peculiar relations between the gauge boson masses .",
    "we consider the elementary process @xmath15 where , apart from the standard model particles , the exotic quarks and the extra neutral gauge boson @xmath16 contributions are taken into account . in the section ii",
    "we give a brief review of the 3 - 3 - 1 model , section iii is devoted to our results for the total cross section and final lepton distributions , and section iv is devoted to our conclusion .",
    "the electric charge operator is defined as : @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are two of the eight generators satisfying the @xmath20 algebra @xmath21 is the unit matrix and @xmath22 denotes the @xmath23 charge .",
    "besides the ordinary standard model gauge bosons , the model predicts the existence of a neutral @xmath16 , double charged @xmath24 and single charged @xmath6 gauge bosons .",
    "the charge operator determines how the fields are arranged in each representation and depends on the @xmath25 parameter . among the possible choices",
    ", @xmath26 @xcite corresponds to the minimal version of the model , whereas @xmath27 leads to a model with right - handed neutrinos and no exotic charged fields @xcite .    in the minimal version of the model",
    "the left- and right - handed lepton components of each generation belong to triplet representation of @xmath20 .",
    "the procedure to cancel model anomalies imposes that quark families be assigned to different @xmath20 representation @xcite .",
    "here we elect the left component of the first quark family to be accommodated in @xmath20 triplet and the second and third families ( @xmath28 ) to belong to the anti - triplet representation as follows : @xmath29 the corresponding right handed component are : @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 are exotic quarks with respectively @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath36 units of the positron charge ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "the numbers inside the parentheses are the @xmath20 representation dimension and the @xmath22 charge of each quark .",
    "the higgs structure necessary for symmetry breaking and that gives to quarks acceptable masses includes three triplets ( @xmath38 and @xmath39 ) and a scalar ( @xmath40 ) in the sextet representation that generates the correct lepton mass spectrum @xcite .",
    "the neutral field of each scalar multiplet develops non - zero vacuum expectation value ( @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 ) and the consistency of the model with the sm phenomenology is imposed by fixing a large scale for @xmath41 , responsible to give mass to the exotic particles ( @xmath45 ) , with @xmath46 gev@xmath47 .",
    "we call attention to the relation between @xmath16 , @xmath6 and @xmath2 masses @xcite : @xmath48    this constraint respects the experimental bounds and it is equivalent to the @xmath49 to @xmath50 masses relation in the sm",
    ". this ratio is @xmath51 for @xmath52 @xcite , and so , @xmath53 can decay into a bilepton pair .",
    "the charged current interaction of leptons ( @xmath54 ) with vector - bilepton are given by : ^cc=-_+ h.c .. in the neutral gauge sector , the interactions of fermions @xmath55 and bosons are described by the lagrangian : @xmath56\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath57 is the fermion electric charge and @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 are the fermion vector and axial - vector couplings with @xmath50 and @xmath53 respectively , displayed in table i. the trilinear couplings from the self - interactions of gauge fields are shown in table ii .    finally , the couplings of ordinary to exotic quarks are driven by charged bilepton as follows : @xmath62 y^{++}_\\mu \\nonumber \\\\ + \\left[\\bar d \\gamma^\\mu \\la 1 - \\gamma^5 \\rf   \\la { \\cal v}_{21 } \\,\\,j_2 +   { \\cal v}_{31 } \\,\\,j_3 \\rf + \\bar j_1 \\gamma^\\mu \\la 1 - \\gamma^5 \\rf \\,\\ , { \\cal u}_{11 } \\,\\,u \\right ] v^+_\\mu + h.c . \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath63 , @xmath64 are mixing matrices elements .    from this expression , and considering the leptonic number conservation , we conclude that the exotic quarks carries two units of leptonic quantum number and so they are a class of leptoquarks .",
    "let us first consider the experimental bounds on bilepton masses .",
    "as it was explained in the introduction , the experimental limits for @xmath7 mass established by atlas and cms collaborations do not apply to the bilepton @xmath6 mass @xcite , because this bilepton couples with exotic quarks in addition to the ordinary quarks . on the other hand , a bound on the doubly charged bilepton mass of @xmath65 gev was obtained from lep data when including exotic contributions to @xmath66 and @xmath67 production ; this bound increases to @xmath68 gev when lepton - flavour violating charged lepton decay data are included @xcite .",
    "a model independent and more recent analysis shows that a bilepton mass values around @xmath69 gev is at the limit of the exclusion region from lep data for an specific range of double charged bilepton - lepton coupling @xcite .",
    "the relation between bileptons to @xmath16 masses gives @xmath16 mass values used in the present work ( @xmath70 and @xmath71 tev ) not excluded by the experimental bounds that are model dependent @xcite .    on the theoretical point of view , a small bilepton mass ( around @xmath69 gev ) is convenient for respecting the constraint on the three measurable quantities , called @xmath72 , @xmath73 , and @xmath74 , that parameterize potential new physics contributions to electroweak radiative corrections .",
    "another important issue related to the gauge boson mass in the @xmath75 model is a landau pole that appears when the ratio of @xmath76 to @xmath77 coupling constants becomes infinite at a finite energy scale . to avoid this critical situation ,",
    "the @xmath16 must be kept below @xmath78 tev @xcite . from these remarks , we adopt three values for the singly charged bilepton mass namely : @xmath79 , @xmath69 and @xmath14 gev , corresponding m@xmath80 and @xmath81 tev respectively .",
    "next we consider bilepton contribution for lepton - neutrino production .",
    "for the three values of bilepton mass , the corresponding widths are @xmath82 , @xmath83 and @xmath84 gev .",
    "we do an important choice in order to avoid @xmath6 decaying into exotic quarks by fixing , in our calculation , the exotic quark mass equal to @xmath85 tev . this way",
    ", @xmath6 decays only into the three lepton flavors with the same branching ratios .",
    "in our procedure we consider the production of two pairs of lepton - neutrino in proton - proton collision from the process below : @xmath86 where @xmath54 and @xmath87 stands for electron or muon and the braces indicate the particles corresponding to the decay of each charged gauge boson .",
    "we calculate the total cross section and we generate the final state events by using the comphep package @xcite . on the set of events",
    "previously generated , we apply convenient cuts for the detector acceptance , and kinematic cuts for final leptons : @xmath88 from the selected events and using madgraph / madanalysis @xcite we obtain some distributions which allow us to compare the signal from the sm process @xmath89 and @xmath90 where @xmath54 and @xmath87 stands for electron or muon , the braces indicate the particles corresponding to the decay of each charged gauge boson and @xmath91 is an hadronic jet .    in the figure 1 , we presents our results for the lepton - neutrino invariant mass distribution ( up ) and lepton transverse momentum distribution ( down ) at @xmath92 tev . in the invariant mass distribution plot",
    ", we are including the signal from the bilepton production plus the sm background",
    ". from this figure one observes that @xmath93 contribution is smaller than the three considered bilepton contributions for lepton invariant mass from @xmath94 gev . on the other hand the @xmath95 @xmath96 channel contributes less than bileptons for @xmath13 gev dilepton invariant mass and its contribution becomes even less important for larger dilepton masses .",
    "one also observes that when the final lepton comes from a bilepton , its transverse momentum distribution is smeared in a wide range of @xmath97 in contrast with the sm final lepton @xmath97 distribution .",
    "these plots clearly show that it is possible to completely isolate the sm contributions by applying a convenient cut on the lepton - antineutrino final state invariant mass and on the charged lepton transverse momentum .",
    "finally , from the calculated cross section and considering @xmath98 fb@xmath99 integrated luminosity , one expect @xmath100 , @xmath101 and @xmath102 events _ per _ year for @xmath103 and @xmath14 gev respectively .",
    "tev.,title=\"fig : \" ]   tev.,title=\"fig : \" ]    in the following we consider the contribution of the doubly charged bilepton for the production of two pairs of equal sign leptons : @xmath104 where @xmath54 and @xmath105 stands for electron or muon and the braces indicate the particles corresponding to the decay of each charged gauge boson .",
    "this is an interesting process because it can encode a non conservation of lepton number .",
    "this violation is much more clear in this case than for for singly charged induced process , where it can also occur .    in the present analysis we respect the relation between gauge boson masses that characterizes the minimal version of the 3 - 3 - 1 model ( eq . [ essa ] ) , by selecting three values for the bilepton mass ( @xmath106 and @xmath14 gev ) corresponding respectively to @xmath107 and @xmath71 tev .    in our calculation ,",
    "exotic quark t - channel exchange is taken into account to guarantee that elementary processes cross section does respect unitarity .",
    "on the other hand , we fix exotic quark masses equal to @xmath85 tev to avoid a large jet production from bilepton decaying into exotic plus ordinary quark . this way we get equal",
    "branching fraction for bilepton ( @xmath108 and @xmath14 gev ) decaying into same sign leptons with widths @xmath109 and @xmath110 gev .",
    "we follow the same procedure as before by adopting the kinematic cuts for final leptons : @xmath111 to obtain @xmath112 and @xmath113 events _ per _ year for the select masses at @xmath92 tev and @xmath98 fb@xmath99 integrated luminosity .",
    "figure 2 shows the results for equal - sign leptons",
    "invariant mass ( up ) and lepton transverse momentum distributions ( down ) .",
    "one observes the peak related to the resonance corresponding to three bilepton masses and their very narrow widths . besides , lepton transverse momentum distribution is similar to the case where it is produced from a single charged bilepton .",
    "tev.,title=\"fig : \" ]   tev.,title=\"fig : \" ]    we have analyzed the lhc potential for discovering singly and doubly charged vector bileptons at @xmath114 c.l . and @xmath115 for electron channel efficiency @xmath116 ,   defined as @xmath117}$ ] .",
    "our results in the figure 4 show the calculated values of integrated luminosity as a function of bilepton mass .",
    "first it is shown in figure 4 ( up ) that @xmath118 fb@xmath99 is sufficient for discovering a singly charged bilepton with @xmath119 up to @xmath14 gev at @xmath92 tev .",
    "for the same bilepton mass and higher energies ( @xmath120 tev ) the integrated luminosities of @xmath121 and @xmath122 fb@xmath99 are required .",
    "the lhc potential for discovering a doubly charged bilepton is represented in the figure 4 ( down ) where one realize that these bileptons can be found for the same luminosity referred before with @xmath123 gev .",
    "we extended our analysis below @xmath79 gev in order to consider the bilepton mass used in @xcite .",
    "the potential for discovering doubly charged vector bileptons at @xmath92 and @xmath124 tev was also obtained in @xcite . in that paper , the authors clearly violates the constraint expressed in eq .",
    "[ essa ] by combining four bilepton mass values with a fixed @xmath16 mass equal to @xmath85 tev .",
    "another issue that deserves a comment is the choice made by the authors exploring low exotic quark masses ( @xmath125 tev ) , that gives an uncontrolled jet production rate .",
    "the lhc at cern opened the possibility to explore an energy regime where the standard model of electroweak interactions have not yet been tested . at these energies",
    "one expect that new resonances , associated with the existence of extra gauge bosons like @xmath7 and/or @xmath16 , can be produced .",
    "these particles are predicted in some sm extensions or alternative models such as the 3 - 3 - 1 model studied in the present paper .",
    "the particle content of the minimal version of this model includes scalars and gauge boson carrying two units of leptonic charge ( @xmath126 ) , called bileptons , and new quarks ( leptoquarks ) with exotic electric charges ( @xmath127 ) leading to rich phenomenological consequences . in particular , this paper focus on lepton number violation in the production of one lepton pair ( @xmath128 ) and a anti - lepton pair ( @xmath129 ) induced by bileptons .",
    "an important characteristic of this model keeps some similarity with the sm one .",
    "we are referring to the relation between charged and neutral gauge boson masses that in the sm is @xmath130 .",
    "our calculation takes into account the constraint expressed in the eq .",
    "[ essa ] in contrast with @xcite , where the authors combined different charged bilepton mass with only one extra neutral gauge boson mass .",
    "we perform the total cross section calculation using the comphep and madgraph packages to generate events that for @xmath131 fb@xmath99 annual integrated luminosity results in a considerable number of leptons .",
    "the observation of a transverse lepton momentum distribution smeared and locate at large @xmath97 values is in contrast with the shape corresponding to the misidentified leptons from the sm resonance . moreover the invariant mass distribution is shifted to large values in contrast with he sm distribution allowing to select the signal by a convenient cut .",
    "we analyzed the lhc discovery potential as a function of bilepton mass showing that an integrated luminosity of order of @xmath98 fb@xmath99 is enough for discovering a bilepton with @xmath132 gev which implies that such signal can be observed for lhc at @xmath133 or @xmath102 tev , whereas for the lhc running at @xmath10 tev one needs lower luminosity .",
    ".the @xmath50 and @xmath53 vector and axial - vector couplings to quarks ( @xmath134 , and @xmath135 ) , @xmath136 and @xmath137 are @xmath138 and @xmath139 diagonal mixing matrix elements , with @xmath140 , @xmath141 and @xmath142 .
