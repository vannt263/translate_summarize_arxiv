    "the traditional picture of low - mass star formation in isolation ( shu , adams , & lizano 1987 ) envisions an early period of pure accretion , prior to the appearance of any wind .",
    "this expectation is based on simple theoretical considerations .",
    "since the star is building up mass from its parent cloud , the rate of mass infall exceeds that of any outflow .",
    "in addition , both theory and observation suggest that the _ speeds _ of infalling and wind gas are comparable .",
    "thus , the ram presure from the collapsing envelope should crush the wind , preventing its escape from the stellar or inner disk surface .",
    "why is it , then , that the most embedded stars , including those designated class 0 ( andr 1993 ) are observed to produce vigorous winds ?",
    "how do wind and infall simultaneously occur in a very young object ?",
    "the answer , as has long been appreciated , is that neither flow is isotropic .",
    "rotation and magnetic fields , in both the star and cloud , break spherical symmetry and alter the geometry of the wind and infall .",
    "moreover , rotational distortion increases as the collapse of the parent cloud proceeds in an inside - out fashion ( shu 1977 ) .",
    "our goal in this paper is to examine numerically the interaction between wind and infall . since the full situation is complex , it is best to proceed in stepwise fashion .",
    "we concentrate , therefore , on the effect of infall geometry , positing for simplicity a spherical wind .",
    "we also focus exclusively on the rotational influence .",
    "that is , we neglect any magnetic force on the infalling gas , under the assumption that decoupling from the ambient field has already occurred ( li & mckee 2000 ) .    as in our first study of this topic ( wilkin & stahler 1998 ; hereafter paper i )",
    ", we follow the dynamics of the thin shell formed by the colliding wind and infall .",
    "paper i derived an evolutionary sequence of shells under the simplifying assumption of quasi - steady flow .",
    "that is , we took the expansion or contraction of the shell to be slow compared to either the wind or infall speeds .",
    "we now study the matter in more detail , solving the initial value problem of shell motion in a fully time - dependent manner .",
    "our finding , in brief , is that the shell can either break out or recollapse to the star , depending on both the flow parameters and the epoch during cloud collapse .",
    "we derive the time of breakout as a function of the wind and infall parameters , and explain how to generalize this to the case of an anisotropic driving wind .    in  2 below , we first detail the mathematical formulation of the problem , obtaining the time - dependent version of the dynamical equations . after describing our method of solution in  3",
    ", we show in  4 that our previous , quasi - steady shells are in fact dynamically unstable .",
    "we set up our initial conditions and nondimensionalization of the launch problem in  5 , before presenting an overview of our numerical results in  6 .",
    "we also rederive key findings in a heuristic , analytical fashion .",
    "finally , section 7 discusses the broader astrophysical implications of our study .",
    "in particular , an observational signature of the trapped wind phase may be fluctuations of the accretion luminosity , as an oscillatory shock structure is expected to develop prior to breakout of the wind .",
    "the supersonic collision of wind and infall leads to the formation of both an inner and outer shock front . at",
    "the wind speeds appropriate for low - mass stars ( typically less than @xmath3 ) , the cooling behind these shocks is relatively efficient .",
    "( recall the discussion in  2.2 of paper i. ) hence we may describe the intershock region as a cold , thin shell , characterized by its radius @xmath4 and mass surface density , @xmath5 . here , @xmath6 is the polar angle measured from the rotation axis of the parent cloud . as in paper",
    "i , we assume this shell to be axisymmetric , i.e. , invariant with respect to the azimuthal angle @xmath7 .    within the shell , two fluids with very different",
    "temperature and velocity come into contact .",
    "the internal shearing layers are subject to the kelvin - helmholtz instability , which leads quickly to turbulent mixing .",
    "we shall assume that the mixing is so efficient that we may describe the shell as a single fluid with a time - averaged velocity at each point @xmath8 .",
    "this velocity has an azimuthal component arising from rotation of the infalling envelope",
    ". it also has a meridional component along the shell .",
    "furthermore , we do _ not _ neglect , as in paper i , the velocity of the shell normal to the surface .",
    "the evolution of the shell is governed by the incident fluxes of mass and momentum from the wind and infall .",
    "it is also influenced critically by the gravitational attraction of the star for the shell material .",
    "the central difference of the present study and paper i is that we no longer assume the evolution to be quasi - steady .",
    "that is , the properties of the shell are allowed to change over the time required for material to travel along the surface .",
    "the infall arises from the gravitational collapse of a dense cloud core within a larger molecular cloud . to obtain the resulting accretion flow , we idealize this core as a singular isothermal sphere rotating rigidly with angular velocity @xmath2",
    "our calculation does not address the formation of the core itself , and neglects any turbulence in the initial structure .",
    "recent theoretical work ( e.g. , cho , lazarian , & vishniac 2002 ; vazquez - semadeni , ballesteros - paredes , & klessen 2003 ) suggests how cores might condense out of a turbulent flow .",
    "nevertheless , observations continue to show that nonthermal motion in the core itself is relatively small ( barranco & goodman 1998 ) .",
    "once the infalling gas becomes supersonic , the effects of this turbulent component are expected to be minor .",
    "our adoption of a spherical body , while clearly an idealization , should be of little consequence for the flow deep within the core s center .    in any event",
    ", the distributions of infalling density @xmath9 and velocity @xmath10 depend on time , because the collapsing region spreads out as a rarefaction wave at the isothermal sound speed @xmath11 , gradually engulfing material of higher specific angular momentum ( shu 1977 ) .",
    "we adopt the infall model of cassen & moosman ( 1981 ) , which represents the inner limit of the full collapse .",
    "this limit applies to radii that are small compared to the expansion front @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the time since the collapse began .",
    "we may gauge the total rate of infall by examining the transport of mass across a surface located well inside the expansion front . according to the inside - out collapse model of shu ( 1977 ) , this transport rate is : @xmath14 where @xmath15 .",
    "the infall itself is characterized by a time - dependent length scale , the centrifugal radius @xmath16 .",
    "this is given by @xmath17 our reference value for @xmath2 is chosen to be consistent with inferred rotation rates based upon velocity gradients in cloud cores lacking embedded iras sources ( jijina , myers , & adams 1999 ) . for an equator - on rotating core , this corresponds to a velocity gradient of @xmath18 . in regions where @xmath19 , rotational distortion of the flow is significant , and",
    "some of the infalling matter strikes the equatorial plane ( @xmath20 ) , forming a circumstellar disk .",
    "when @xmath21 , the infall is nearly spherically symmetric . equation ( 1 ) gives the _ sum _ of the mass per unit time impacting the star directly and that entering the disk .",
    "in terms of the nondimensional radial variable @xmath22 , the infall velocity components and density are ( terebey , shu & cassen 1984 ) @xmath23^{-1}\\,\\ , .",
    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the function @xmath24 is the legendre polynomial , where @xmath25 is a lagrangian variable that labels the streamlines . specifically , @xmath25 is the initial polar angle of each fluid element , just before it is overtaken by the rarefaction wave .",
    "this angle is given implicitly in terms of the instantaneous coordinates @xmath26 and @xmath6 by the trajectory equation @xmath27    our goal is to assess the collimating influence of the anisotropic infall .",
    "accordingly , we idealize the wind to be spherically symmetric , with an associated mass transport rate of @xmath28 . if the star lies at the origin of a spherical coordinate system , then the wind density at a radial distance @xmath29 is @xmath30 here , @xmath31 is the wind velocity .",
    "note that the components @xmath32 and @xmath33 are both zero .",
    "we do not investigate the structure of the star , which is taken simply to be a spherical , gravitating mass .",
    "the value of this mass is @xmath34 thus , we assume that both the matter entering the disk and that colliding with the infall are efficiently recycled to the star .",
    "how gas within the shocked shell reaches the disk is , of course , one of our main concerns . on the other hand ,",
    "the transport of matter _ within _ the disk through internal torques is beyond the scope of this project .",
    "once the shell truly moves dynamically , mass accretion onto the star and disk is halted , and we freeze the stellar mass at the value corresponding to the launch time of the shell ( see  4 ) .",
    "as in paper i , we consider a small , three - dimensional patch of the shell , whose center is located at @xmath35 within a global , spherical coordinate system centered on the star .",
    "we also utilize a global , cartesian system @xmath36 .",
    "( see figure 3 of paper i , i.e. , figure i.3 ) to help in following our necessarily abbreviated derivation of the equations , we advise the reader to consult  2.3 of paper i.    figure  [ fig : wsif4 ] , a slightly modified version of figure i.4 , shows the representative patch in more detail .",
    "we let @xmath37 denote the surface tilt , i.e. , the angle between the patch normal @xmath38 and the radial direction from the star @xmath39 .",
    "the upper and lower faces , i.e. , those depicted with the largest areas , coincide with the inner and outer shock fronts .",
    "the narrow faces to the left and right of the upper one trace loci of constant polar angle @xmath6 , while the remaining two have fixed @xmath7 .",
    "note that the length @xmath40 is a small increment of the global coordinate @xmath41 measuring distance along the shell from the pole to the equatorial plane .",
    "inspection of figure  [ fig : wsif4 ] shows that @xmath42 and that the patch width is @xmath43 .",
    "the surface area of either the upper or lower face is @xmath44 , and the total patch volume is @xmath45 . here",
    "@xmath46 ( called @xmath47 in paper i ) is the patch thickness .",
    "the factor @xmath48 is given by @xmath49    for a mathematical description of the shell evolution , we let @xmath50 be a dependent variable . then the tilt angle @xmath37 is given by @xmath51 , where @xmath52 . during the evolution , we want the sides of our patch to retain fixed angular positions in @xmath6 and @xmath7 . on the other hand , we allow the upper and lower surfaces to move in and out radially , in order to follow expansion or contraction of the shell .",
    "let us denote by ( @xmath53 ) the velocity of matter within the shell .",
    "( note the lack of additional subscripts , which we use to denote wind or infall . )",
    "the velocity component of this fluid pointing along the patch normal is @xmath54 now shell expansion gives the patch itself a normal velocity @xmath55 our kinematical constraint on the patch motion is simply @xmath56 . combining equations ( 11 ) and ( 12 ) , we find @xmath57    proceeding to the dynamical equations , we first derive an expression for @xmath58 , the rate of change of any physical quantity within the patch .",
    "let @xmath59 denote the volume density of this quantity . this density may change with time , as may the patch volume .",
    "we thus have @xmath60 where the partial derivative is at fixed @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "the change in our quantity comes in part from advection into and out of the patch .",
    "the rate here depends on both the wind and infall velocities , and those within the patch itself .",
    "note that the relevant wind and infall velocities are the normal components _ relative to the patch _",
    ", since the latter has the normal velocity @xmath61 .",
    "let @xmath62 and @xmath63 be the density of the quantity in the wind and infall , respectively .",
    "then these flows make an _ external _ contribution to @xmath58 : @xmath64\\,\\delta s\\,\\delta w,\\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\,{\\cal a}\\,\\bigl[{u}_{w , n}'\\,q_w\\ , -\\",
    ", { u}_{i , n}'\\,q_i\\bigr]\\ , \\delta\\,\\theta\\,\\delta\\,\\phi\\,\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have used primes for the relative normal velocities .",
    "we must also account the _ internal _ contribution to advection , i.e. , the effect of flow within the shell .",
    "part of this flow is due to motion in the @xmath6-direction . noting that the radial thickness of the shell is @xmath65 , figure  [ fig : wsif4 ] shows that @xmath66_{\\theta-\\delta\\theta/2}\\ , -\\ ,   [ u_\\theta\\,q\\,\\delta r\\,\\delta w]_{\\theta+\\delta\\theta/2}\\,\\nonumber\\\\   &   = & -{{\\partial}\\over{\\partial\\,\\theta}}\\ , \\biggl({\\cal a}\\,{{u_\\theta\\,q\\,\\delta\\ , n } \\over { r}}\\biggr)\\ , \\delta\\,\\theta\\,\\delta\\,\\phi\\,\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the final contribution to advection stems from the @xmath7-velocity . here we find@xmath67_{\\phi-\\delta\\phi/2 } -   [ u_\\phi\\,q\\,\\delta\\,s\\,\\delta\\,n]_{\\phi+\\delta\\phi/2 }   \\nonumber\\\\   & = & \\ , - u_\\phi\\,r\\,\\sec\\gamma\\ , { { \\partial q } \\over { \\partial \\phi}}\\,\\delta\\,n\\,\\delta\\,\\theta\\,\\delta\\,\\phi.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] apart from notation , this equation is identical to equation ( i.18 ) .",
    "we now sum all the advective terms to form @xmath68 . combining equations ( 15)-(17 )",

    "we let @xmath59 be the mass density @xmath71 .",
    "note that this quantity , like the others we shall be considering , is formally infinite in the limit @xmath72 , whereas @xmath73 is the finite surface density @xmath74 . since there are no sources or sinks of mass , we demand that @xmath75 .",
    "we find @xmath76    turning to momentum , we first note that the magnitude of the gravitational force on the patch is @xmath77",
    ". this force would increase the momentum within the patch even if there were no advection .",
    "suppose we choose our patch to be located at @xmath78 in the global , spherical coordinate system .",
    "then the cartesian components of the gravitational force become @xmath79 , @xmath80 , and @xmath81 .",
    "the physical conservation law is most directly expressed in terms of cartesian coordinates . in the @xmath82-momentum equation ,",
    "we let @xmath83 in equations ( 14 ) and ( 18 ) , and demand that @xmath84 . for the patch centered on @xmath78 , @xmath85 and @xmath86 . here",
    "@xmath87 is the cylindrical radial component of velocity .",
    "we obtain @xmath88 the @xmath89-component of momentum conservation is simpler since @xmath90 .",
    "we now let @xmath91 , and use @xmath92 and @xmath93 to find @xmath94 we may obtain a simpler form of this @xmath7-force equation by instead writing it in terms of the z - component of angular momentum .",
    "first note that using equation ( 13 ) , we have the relation @xmath95 . multiplying this equation by @xmath96 , and adding it to @xmath97 times equation ( 21 ) ,",
    "we obtain @xmath98 similarly , the z - force equation is obtained using @xmath99 : @xmath100    we have seen that beginning with cartesian components of velocity , the azimuthal symmetry of the problem leads naturally to equations in terms of the cylindrical components of velocity .",
    "however , for a radial driving wind , it will be most useful to use spherical components . by taking linear combinations of equations ( 20 ) and ( 23 ) , and substituting @xmath101 and @xmath102",
    ", we may recast them in terms of the velocities @xmath103 and @xmath104 : @xmath105 previously , giuliani ( 1982 ) derived an equivalent set of equations , including magnetic fields , but without accounting for gravity or rotation .",
    "in practice , it is simplest to solve the evolutionary equations by recasting them in lagrangian form .",
    "consider first the comoving derivative of any quantity @xmath106 within the shell . in the eulerian description we have used until now",
    ", @xmath106 is a function of @xmath13 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 .",
    "it also depends implicitly on radius , since , at fixed @xmath6 and @xmath7 , the radius @xmath107 varies with time .",
    "the comoving derivative is therefore @xmath108 we now let @xmath106 be , in turn , the radial and angular positions of a moving fluid element that constitutes part of the shell .",
    "this element is no longer constrained in @xmath6 and @xmath7 , as was our patch . retaining the old notation for these coordinates , now serving as dependent variables , we substitute into equation ( 26 ) to find @xmath109 in deriving equation ( 27 ) ,",
    "we have used both equation ( 13 ) and the definition of @xmath37 in terms of @xmath110 .",
    "equations ( 27)-(29 ) describe both the expansion of the shell and tangential motion along its surface .",
    "we next substitute for @xmath106 in equation ( 26 ) the quantity @xmath111 . after utilizing equation ( 19 )",
    ", we arrive at the lagrangian expression for mass conservation , which we may write as @xmath112\\,/\\,\\sigma     - { { \\partial } \\over { \\partial \\theta}}\\biggl({{u_\\theta } \\over { r}}\\biggr).\\ ] ] to obtain the @xmath29- and @xmath6- components of the force equation , as well as the expression for angular momentum conservation , we substitute for @xmath106 the quantities @xmath103 , @xmath104 , and @xmath113 , respectively .",
    "we then use our eulerian conservation laws and equation ( 30 ) in each case to find @xmath114/\\sigma + { { { u_\\theta^2 } } \\over r }   + { { { \\l}^2 \\sin\\theta } \\over { { \\varpi}^3 } }   - { { g\\ , m _ { * } } \\over { r^2}},\\\\   { { d\\,u_\\theta } \\over { d\\,t } } & = &     \\ [ \\rho_w\\,u_{w , n}'\\,u_{w,\\theta}'\\ ,   - \\,\\rho_i\\,u_{i , n}'\\,u_{i,\\theta}']/\\sigma   - { { u_r\\ , u_\\theta } \\over r }    + { { { \\l}^2 \\cos\\theta } \\over { { \\varpi}^3}},\\\\ { { d\\,\\l } \\over { d\\,t } } & = &   [ \\rho_w\\,u_{w , n}'\\,\\l_w ' - \\rho_i\\,u_{i , n}'\\,\\l_i']\\,/\\,\\sigma.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here we have let @xmath115 be the @xmath116-component of specific angular momentum , and have further defined @xmath117    equations ( 27)-(29 ) and ( 31)-(33 ) may be summarized in vector form as @xmath118/\\sigma     - { { g\\ , m _ { * } } \\over { r^2}}\\,{\\hat { \\bf r}}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as expected , the acceleration of the fluid element depends on both the radial force of gravity and on the input of momentum from wind and infall .",
    "note finally that the mass conservation equation ( 30 ) contains an eulerian derivative on the righthand side , so that our equations are not in purely lagrangian form .",
    "indeed , the normal components of wind and infall speed that enter equations ( 30)-(33 ) also require , through the angle @xmath37 , the eulerian derivative @xmath119 . in practice , this mixed character of the equations , and the fact that @xmath6 acts as both a dependent and independent variable , present no special difficulty for integration .",
    "equations ( 27)-(33 ) fully describe the motion of a fluid element within the shell . because the latter is axisymmetric",
    ", there is no need to track the @xmath7 coordinate , and we may ignore equation ( 29 ) .",
    "we treat the others effectively as ordinary differential equations in time , and use them to follow a collection of 50 discrete points that represents our shell .",
    "we evaluate the cross derivatives @xmath119 and @xmath120 , by numerically differencing @xmath107 and @xmath121 .",
    "this method has been employed previously for the similar problem of steady - state , non - axisymmetric bow shocks and expanding supershells ( mac low and mccray 1988 ; bandiera 1993 ) , and works well provided the spacing between adjacent trajectories is fine enough to determine numerical derivatives .    for each of the 50 points , we integrated the equations in time using a fifth - order runge - kutta scheme .",
    "cross derivatives were obtained at each point by using the two nearest neighbors , and were thus second - order accurate .",
    "since the points move in a manner dictated by the local fluid velocity , they are unevenly spaced in angle . in practice",
    ", we approximated the shell segment by fitting a circular arc through each triad of points .",
    "the cross derivatives at the middle point were then obtained analytically from this curve .    as the shell evolved in time , some of its representative points inevitably drifted toward the equatorial plane .",
    "in addition , points could move so close together that there was little variation in the intervening space . in either circumstance",
    ", we removed a point from the original set .",
    "we immediately replaced it with another , which we introduced at the part of the shell that was most sparsely covered .",
    "we always retained one point on the symmetry axis , where the boundary conditions @xmath122 were applied . here",
    "the mass equation was written in modified form to account for the vanishing of the @xmath123 factor within @xmath48 .",
    "we tested our code on three problems with known , analytic solutions .",
    "they include : ( 1 ) an expanding , spherical shell driven by an isotropic wind , ( 2 ) a shell driven by an angle - dependent wind within an @xmath124 density distribution ( shu 1991 ) , and ( 3 ) the bowshock created by the wind from a star that is moving into a uniform medium .",
    "the first two tests confirmed the code to better than @xmath125 accuracy in a non - steady situation .",
    "for the last problem , wilkin ( 1996 ) found analytic solutions for the steady - state shell configuration , including the surface density and flow velocity along the shell .",
    "figure  [ fig : wsif3 ] shows the expansion of our time - dependent bowshock as it approaches the steady - state endpoint .",
    "we have checked that the approach to equilibrium agrees with the calculations of giuliani ( 1982 ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : errors ] compares a number of quantities in the analytic solution with our numerical results , at a time when equilibrium has been reached .",
    "the fractional errors are between @xmath126 and @xmath127 , except close to the pole .",
    "judging from the three tests , we believe our code is capable of tracking all variables in the time - dependent shell to within an accuracy of 1 - 2 percent .",
    "before displaying our fully time - dependent results , we first discuss the quasi - steady solutions obtained in paper i. ] these shells are in dynamical equilibrium , with gravity and the infall ram pressure opposing the outward ram pressure from the wind . because gravity plays a dominant role , we suspected that the shells might be dynamically unstable .",
    "( see  4 of paper i. ) we now demonstrate this fact both analytically and numerically .",
    "we first examine the stability in the region of the polar axis .",
    "this approach extracts the basic physics while bypassing a full modal analysis , such as that done for wind bowshocks by dgani , van buren , & noriega - crespo ( 1996 ) . the total radial force per unit area acting on the shell near the axis is @xmath128 note that we have omitted centrifugal terms , which are vanishingly small near the pole .",
    "the condition of normal force balance is that @xmath129 , where @xmath130 is the shell s equilibrium polar radius .",
    "we now imagine perturbing the shell , and examine the resulting change in @xmath131 . for this purpose ,",
    "we consider the lowest - order oscillation mode of the shell , i.e. , its breathing mode .",
    "we find the altered wind density @xmath132 from equation ( 8) , and the infall density @xmath9 and velocity @xmath133 from equations ( 6 ) and ( 3 ) , respectively .",
    "for the latter two quantities , we specialize to the pole by setting @xmath134 . to obtain the perturbed value of the mass density @xmath74",
    ", we ignore any additional mass swept up by the shell during its oscillation .",
    "thus , to conserve mass , we write @xmath135 , where @xmath136 is the equilibrium value . equation ( 38 ) then becomes @xmath137 where @xmath138 .",
    "note that we have also neglected alterations to the surface density due to _ the perturbation _ in the tangential motion .",
    "we showed in paper i that such motion is generally small compared to the wind and infall speeds .",
    "we next nondimensionalize equation ( 39 ) by dividing through by @xmath139 . again employing subscripts for equilibrium values ,",
    "we have @xmath140 the constants @xmath141 and @xmath142 are the nondimensional ( fractional ) contributions of the infall and gravitational forces , respectively , at the equilibrium position .",
    "these are given by @xmath143    the requirement that @xmath130 be an equilibrium radius means that @xmath144 .",
    "thus , we may eliminate @xmath142 from equation ( 40 ) .",
    "writing @xmath145 and recalling that @xmath146 , we linearize in @xmath147 to find the small radial force due to the oscillation : @xmath148 \\delta.\\ ] ] we see that there is a critical value for @xmath141 : @xmath149 if the actual @xmath141 in the equilibrium solution exceeds @xmath150 , then the radial force is directed opposite to the displacement , i.e. , the shell is stable ( or overstable ) .",
    "conversely , @xmath151 implies dynamic instability .",
    "the _ minimum _ value of @xmath150 , that for infinite @xmath152 , is 0.8 .",
    "that is , at least @xmath153 percent of the confining force must come from the infall ram pressure , rather than gravity , to ensure stability .",
    "we now return to the exact results of paper i. there we found @xmath141 to be @xmath154^{-1},\\ ] ] where @xmath155 is the ratio of wind to infall mass transfer rates .",
    "this result is taken from equation ( i.60 ) , where the three terms of that equation correspond , from left to right , to the normal force due to wind , infall , and gravity , respectively . for a fixed value of @xmath152 , decreasing @xmath156 increases @xmath141 .",
    "thus , we consider the limit @xmath157 , to obtain the largest possible value of @xmath141 .",
    "if we set @xmath158 in equation ( 45 ) , then @xmath141 monotonically increases with @xmath152 .",
    "the maximum of @xmath141 occurs in the limit @xmath159 , @xmath160 , in which case @xmath161 .",
    "since this is substantially less than the minimum value of @xmath141 necessary for stability , we conclude that there are no combinations of @xmath156 and @xmath152 such that the shell is stable .",
    "while this analysis is based upon conditions near the symmetry axis , the small contribution of centrifugal effects at larger angles ( section i.3.3 ) suggests that the same result should hold throughout the shell .",
    "one might argue that the steady - state solution might nevertheless be achieved in some average sense . while this has been found to be true for isothermal bowshocks ( blondin & koerwer 1998 ; raga 1997 ) ,",
    "the calculations we next describe indicate that this is not the case in our problem .",
    "we next use our time - dependent code to evolve shells starting near the steady - state conditions derived in paper i. the latter calculation gives us the run of @xmath162 for a grid of @xmath163values .",
    "we first verified the validity of the steady - state solutions , checking that the net normal force on a fluid element is equal to the normal component of the centrifugal force it experiences . despite this balance",
    ", the shells do not stay in their initial configuration , but evolve quickly .",
    "shells begun at a size slightly larger than equilibrium expand , while those of slightly smaller size collapse , as expected by the analytical argument .",
    "a representative example is shown in figure  [ fig : instab ] .",

    "the equilibrium solution shown is that of the critical ( innermost ) model for @xmath164 shown in figure i.9 .",
    "the slightly shrunken , collapsing shell quickly accelerates to free - fall speed , while the expanding structure eventually decelerates at large radius as a momentum - conserving snowplow .",
    "the analytic argument of the preceeding section , together with these and similar numerical experiments , show convincingly that the quasi - steady shells are dynamically unstable .",
    "this basic result motivates our current study , where we consider the shell evolution as an explicitly time - dependent , initial value problem .",

    "our shell is initially spherical and massless , with radius equal to that of the protostar , @xmath165 .",
    "as the structure evolves , it receives mass from both the wind and infall .",

    "all physical variables can be written as dimensionless factors times appropriate combinations of @xmath183 , @xmath193 , and @xmath194 .",

    "the initial launch is within the inner , anisotropic region of the infall . in order to compute the evolution of the shocked shell in dimensionless units , only the three nondimensional ratios",
    "@xmath156 , @xmath200 , and @xmath204 need to be specified .",
    "another obvious ratio is that of the dynamical and evolutionary timescales : @xmath205 this quantity is of order @xmath206 .",
    "since our calculations span only dynamical times , @xmath207 does not appear explicitly in the final , nondimensional equations ( see below ) .",
    "note that our previous physical units can be written as    @xmath208    the nondimensional equations include various quantities related to the infall .",
    "these , in turn , depend on the time @xmath13 since the start of collapse . since our basic temporal unit is @xmath193 , we may write @xmath209 here , @xmath210 is the nondimensional evolutionary time , written in terms of @xmath182 . in practice , the difference between @xmath210 and @xmath204 is exceedingly small .",

    "the primary effect of infall angular momentum is to establish an asymmetric flow , which is then swept up by the expanding shell .",

    "the shell first elongates as it expands up to and beyond the disk radius , indicated in figure  [ fig : breaking ] .",
    "this outward motion never ceases , as the wind is able to drive back the infalling envelope in all directions .",
    "we refer to such an outcome as _",
    "breakout_. while at intermediate times ( see figure  [ fig : breaking2 ] ) the shell is quite elongated and a bipolar geometry is obtained , at late times ( figure  [ fig : breaking3 ] ) the shell takes on a more spherical appearance . in this spatial regime , well beyond the disk radius , the ambient density is also spherically symmetric .",
    "figure  [ fig : rising ] shows that dramatically different results are obtained with very similar input parameters ( @xmath238 , @xmath239 , @xmath240 ) .",
    "dimensionally , the wind speed has now been lowered to @xmath241 .",
    "the shell initially rises as before , but it stalls and falls back to the star at nearly free - fall speed . as the shell plummets to the stellar surface , initial ripples are amplified ; higher numerical resolution would be needed to follow this apparent instability .",
    "we will not be interested in such details , but only in whether or not the shell succeeds in driving back the infall .",
    "shells that break out are typically quite smooth and regular . even for those that recollapse ,",
    "the structure is smooth up to the point of turnaround .",
    "note that recollapse is caused primarily by gravity acting on the heavy shell , rather than infall ram pressure . turning off gravity in the code",

    "the boundary between the crushed wind and the trapped wind is the locus @xmath248 given by equation ( 70 ) , where infall and wind ram pressures balance at the stellar surface .",

    "finally , @xmath249 again rises at late times . in this case , the critical wind speed is independent of @xmath156 and increases as @xmath250 .    let us see in more detail how these results arise .",

    ", equations ( 62 ) , ( 64 ) ) so the gravitational force per unit area on the shell @xmath258 also behaves as @xmath250 .",
    "comparing the wind ram pressure @xmath259 to the sum of infall ram pressure and gravity , we obtain @xmath260 .",
    "the downturn in @xmath249 at @xmath261 occurs because the star is now interior to the centrifugal radius .",
    "the decrease in the infall density along the z - axis relative to spherical accretion implies that breakout becomes easier .",
    "because the shell s mass is dominated by the infall contribution , the decrease in the infall density along the axis decreases both the infall ram pressure and the gravitational force on the shell . at late times , the centrifugal radius has grown so large that the primary source of mass input to the shell is the wind . in this regime ,",
    "the wind speed necessary for breakout is proportional to the stellar escape velocity , which in turn varies as @xmath250 .",
    "we compare these numerical results for @xmath249 with three analytical approximations in figure  [ fig : analytic ] .",
    "a hypothetical wind of speed @xmath262 ( the diagonal , dash - dot line ) would be fast enough to break out if we neglect the mass and momentum fluxes to the shell from infall .",
    "we see that except for late times ( @xmath263 ) , the wind must be considerably faster than the escape speed to drive a swept - up shell that will break out . at late times , our constant speed wind can break out with @xmath264 because we have neglected gravitational deceleration of the preshock wind . , and numerically determining the corresponding critical speed for breakout with our code ( filled triangles in figure  [ fig : analytic ] ) , we see that the late - time critical curves are shifted vertically and converge to the escape speed . at early times , since breakout speeds were already much larger than the escape speed , the difference between a constant speed and a decelerating wind is negligible , and the critical curves are unchanged . because no observed winds actually decelerate , we consider the constant velocity curves to be more applicable . ]",
    "the second approximation is that of @xmath265 , shown by the dashed line , yielding ram pressure balance of wind and infall at the stellar surface .",
    "this approximation underestimates the necessary wind speed for breakout by a factor of @xmath266 at early times , when the infall is spherically symmetric , but it underestimates the critical speed by a much larger factor once the infall becomes significantly aspherical .    the two foregoing analytical approximations give a poor agreement with @xmath249 because the first neglects the infall ram pressure , while the second neglects the gravitational force on the shell . to include in an analytic fashion the effect of both infall ram pressure and gravity on the shocked gas within the shell",

    "if we neglect changes in the infall momentum flux per unit solid angle once the shell is launched , @xmath275 is expected to be an estimate of the necessary wind speed to launch a shell that will break out . in practice , as the shell advances , the forces on the shell change , and typically the wind weakens less quickly than the infall , so the above condition overestimates the required wind speed . except for the vertical offset",
    ", however , the curve follows closely the shape of the numerically - derived critical curve , suggesting @xmath279 throughout the evolution . by choosing @xmath280 , so as to fit the late - time behavior , an approximate fit to the critical curves is shown in figure  [ fig : crits ] .",
    "the previously described calculations may be extended to anisotropic winds by defining angular dependences of the wind mass and momentum fluxes according to @xmath281 where @xmath282 is the streamline - averaged wind speed and the functions @xmath283 and @xmath284 are normalized to have unit average value over @xmath285 steradians .",
    "although a diversity of shell shapes may be generated in this fashon , we focus only on the behavior at the symmetry axis , where breakout is easiest . if the properties of the wind are smooth near the pole , i.e. @xmath286 , the shell has @xmath287 and looks locally as though it is driven by an isotropic wind .",
    "figure  [ fig : breaking2 ] shows a numerical example . here",

    "this angular dependence represents the lowest - order expansion that is axisymmetric and of even parity , and has been chosen arbitrarily to give a pole - to - equator density contrast of @xmath291 . because the derived polar behavior @xmath292 of a shell driven by an anisotropic wind follows that of a spherical wind having the same polar mass and momentum fluxes , the critical wind speed @xmath249 for breakout of an anisotropic wind may be determined from our numerical curves . defining @xmath293",
    ", the equivalent spherical wind corresponds to @xmath294 and @xmath295 .",
    "a wind that is focused preferentially towards the poles mimics a spherical wind corresponding to a higher value of @xmath156 and a reduced value of @xmath249 , breaking out at an earlier time ( see below ) . in our example , the @xmath288 wind has @xmath296 and the shell propagates along the axis like a bubble from an isotropic wind of higher @xmath156-value .",
    "given the curves for the critical wind speed for breakout ( figure  9 ) , we now wish to estimate the time at which breakout occurs .",
    "we first note that a wind whose speed is independent of @xmath210 would experience no trapped phase , since the curves for @xmath249 decrease as @xmath297 .",
    "although we are not offering a general theoretical account of protostellar winds , we note that a constant wind speed is unlikely on purely empirical grounds .",
    "stars of all masses and ages tend to have @xmath290-values roughly equal to the appropriate surface escape speed ( lamers & cassinelli 1999 ) .",
    "we therefore recast figure  9 as a plot of @xmath298 versus @xmath210 ( figure  11 ) . for comparison ,",
    "we have also plotted @xmath299 , to delimit the end of the crushed wind phase , using equation ( 70 ) for @xmath300 .",
    "suppose , then , that @xmath301 were strictly a constant , equal to unity .",
    "taking the case @xmath238 in figure  11 , we see that the wind would first be able to advance from the stellar surface at @xmath302 years , but breakout would be achieved at @xmath303 years . for the @xmath304 model ,",
    "these times increase to @xmath305 and @xmath306 years , respectively .",
    "our numbers rely on a relatively modest value of @xmath233 . based upon equation ( 52 ) ,",
    "increasing @xmath2 by a factor of two would decrease the above breakout times by a factor of @xmath307 .",
    "thus , the trapped outflow phase may be a significant fraction ( @xmath308 ) of the time prior to breakout .",
    "for the example we have shown , when the shell breaks out , it does so at essentially all angles .",
    "however , this is not the case for all runs and is not true in general .",
    "thus , our breakout time is to be interpreted as the time at which the wind first breaks out along the @xmath309axis . at larger angles ,",
    "the wind may be unable to break out until a later evolutionary time , resulting in simultaneous outflow and infall .",
    "usually , however , the wind escapes globally , as shown in figures  5 - 7 .",
    "the shell aspect ratio then begins and ends as unity , either at the stellar surface or far from the star .",
    "the maximum distortion , which is still modest , is attained at intermediate times , when the shell is a few au from the stellar surface .",
    "our recollapsing shells generally become unstable during the trapped wind phase .",
    "portions that are initially inside neighboring regions fall faster , increasing any perturbation of an initially smooth surface .",
    "while our calculations do find this strong dynamical effect , we can not detect the nonlinear instability of vishniac ( 1994 ) , which relies on a finite shell thickness .",
    "our results make it clear , in any case , that the true behavior during the trapped wind phase is exceedingly complex . after a portion of the shell collapses to the stellar and disk surfaces ,",
    "a new shock is immediately driven outward by the steady wind .",
    "thus , there will simultaneously be contracting and expanding patches at different angles .",
    "portions of the wind may escape temporarily between recollapsing fragments before falling back .",
    "while the details of this process can not be followed by our computational method , we believe our calculated breakout times should still be reasonably accurate . in any event , this time can not decrease by more than about a factor of two , since the infall crushes the wind entirely at an earlier epoch",
    ".    one observational signature of the trapped wind phase would be fluctuations in luminosity due to the rising and recollapse of the shell .",
    "this luminosity arises from both the shocking of the wind and ambient gas .",
    "when a portion of the shell is rising , the corresponding wind component of luminosity decreases because of the lowered shock velocity .",
    "the infall component of the luminosity may either increase ( because the shock velocity is raised ) , or decrease ( because @xmath310 decreases at larger radius . )",
    "all luminosity fluctuations should increase in both period and amplitude with evolutionary time , because as breakout is approached , the shell rises higher before recollapse .",
    "further study is needed to determine the observed magnitude of these fluctuations , as well as the transport of radiation through the infalling gas .",
    "as indicated earlier , the wind may also break out along the axis , while portions of the shell at larger angles continue oscillatory behavior . in this case",
    ", one would observe a bipolar jet accompanied by quasi - periodic fluctuations in luminosity .",
    "figures  5 - 7 show that the lobe - like appearance of our shells is a transient phenomenon created by anisotropy in the infalling gas .",
    "in particular , this elongated morphology can not be identified with the collimation seen in herbig - haro jets .",
    "our assumed mixing of shocked wind and infall is , in fact , an agent for _",
    "decollimation_. a fluid element of the wind , initially moving radially outward , acquires a positive @xmath6-velocity .",
    "thus , there is a tendency for gas to move towards the disk plane , despite the ( temporary ) elongation of the shell .",
    "our mixing assumption was made purely for computational simplicity . in reality",
    ", there must be considerable shear between the two shocks .",
    "this shear may have several important consequences .",
    "first , shocked wind may be refracted along the shell s inner surface toward the polar axis , resulting in a more jet - like flow .",
    "such a geometry would resemble the early outflow model of cant ( 1980 ) , although the latter pictured a shell in pressure balance with a static , external medium .",
    "a second effect is that shocked , ambient gas will move tangentially toward the _",
    "equator_. the overall result will be a shell of lower mass that is less confined by stellar gravity .",
    "the duration of the trapped wind phase will therefore be reduced , resulting in earlier breakout . however , we note that even in the limit of no mixing , the wind must still be crushed by infall at a sufficiently early epoch . in future calculations , we hope to explore quantitatively the consequences of relaxing the mixing assumption . in a series of numerical simluations carried out through the 1990s , a.  frank and",
    "colleagues found that the interaction of a spherical wind and infall produces very strong collimation .",
    "however , these studies ( beginning with frank & noriega - crespo 1994 ) modified the equations for infall , thus obtaining a much larger density anisotropy than adopted here .",
    "for example , frank & mellema ( 1996 ) used an equator - to - pole density contrast of @xmath311 , while delamarter ( 2000 ) allow this ratio to exceed @xmath312 . for comparison ,",
    "the density contrast in our outflow only exceeds 50 only for @xmath313 .",
    "our escaping shell spends relatively little time within this region , sweeping up a small amount of mass .",
    "we conclude that a spherical or modestly anisotropic wind undergoes little collimation through interaction with a physically realistic infall , unless it is through the shear effect described above .",
    "our finding of an early , trapped wind phase is a similarly robust result , although it was missed in previous simulations .",
    "frank & mellema adopt such a large wind velocity ( @xmath314 ) that the infall ram pressure is overwhelmed .",
    "mellema & frank ( 1997 ) did find oscillating shells that , under some conditions , collapsed .",
    "however , the driver of their oscillations was a variable wind , so that collapse always coincided with the weakest outflow phase .",
    "more recently , delamarter ( 2000 ) utilized as an infalling background the flattened , rotating cloud of hartmann , calvet , & boss ( 1996 ) . although they claim that especially weak winds may be stifled entirely by infall , their numerical results always show the wind escaping through at least a narrow solid angle through the symmetry axis .",
    "we maintain , based on the arguments presented above , that early wind crushing and eventual breakout are inescapable features within a realistic account of the wind - infall interaction . in contrast , a strong , untrapped wind that is present _ ab initio _ , as in previous simulations , would have already modified substantially the background infall , rendering subsequent results of dubious validity .",
    "our own calculations of breakout can provide useful starting conditions for future investigators who wish to follow the wind evolution well beyond this critical , early phase .",
    "we have seen that , for canonical values of our parameters , the wind is trapped for a period of roughly @xmath315 yr .",
    "although the evolutionary status of the most embedded sources is by no means secure , those designated as class 0 ( andr 1993 ) are generally considered to be the youngest .",
    "they are detectable only at far - infrared and submillimeter wavelengths , and have spectral energy distributions corresponding to dust temperatures of roughly 30 k. an additional argument for their extreme youth is their relatively low population . in a submillimeter survey of @xmath71 ophiuchi , motte ( 1998 ) found that class i sources outnumber those of class 0 by a factor of 10 .",
    "since the former have traditionally been assigned ages of order @xmath316 yr ( kenyon 1990 ) , class 0 stars could be as young as @xmath211 yr , if the population is forming in steady - state fashion .",
    "visser ( 2002 ) , in their recent scuba survey of lynds dark clouds , have challenged these figures .",
    "they find nearly equal numbers of class 0 and i sources , and conclude that the former also have ages of roughly @xmath316 yr .",
    "regardless of the outcome of this controversy , both surveys , as well as other studies , have found that essentially all stars with massive , dusty envelopes produce winds , as evidenced by associated co outflows .",
    "where , then , is the trapped phase ?",
    "we see two possible answers to this question .",
    "the first , and less likely , is that our choice of input parameters requires adjustment .",
    "however , the necessary changes would be severe . for",
    "fixed @xmath156 , @xmath200 , and @xmath210 , @xmath317 scales as @xmath318 .",
    "it strains credibility to suppose , for example , that the cloud sonic speed @xmath11 is so high that @xmath317 is reduced by an order of magnitude .",
    "in addition to this change of scale , we may change nondimensional solutions , by assuming a faster wind ( greater @xmath200 ) .",
    "as seen in figure  [ fig : nonsteady ] , the breakout time is relatively insensitive to @xmath200 until a value is reached where the trapped wind disappears entirely ( where the dashed curves are horizontal ) .",
    "this option , however , would imply very high wind speeds ( @xmath319 for @xmath238 , or @xmath320 for @xmath304 ) . as noted in  6.3 , making the wind more anisotropic effectively raises @xmath156 and also leads to earlier breakout .",
    "winds launched via the magnetocentrifugal mechanism , however , typically have modest anisotropy until they propagate a considerable distance ( see , , najita & shu 1994 ) . a second , and more plausible",
    ", answer is that we are _ already _ witnessing at least partially trapped winds . following the arguments in  7.1",
    ", it may be that simultaneous infall and outflow occur well before our idealized model indicates the onset of breakout .",
    "it would be extremely interesting , in this regard , to monitor the temporal variability of outflows from class 0 sources .",
    "we have presented a detailed numerical calculation of the interaction between a spherical , protostellar wind and an anisotropic , infalling envelope .",
    "the anisotropy in our model is derived from the rotation of the star s parent cloud core .",
    "collapse is assumed to proceed in inside - out fashon from a singular , isothermal sphere , in the absence of magnetic forces .",
    "we have idealized the double - shock interaction region as a thin shell that is well - mixed internally . after demonstrating that our previous , quasi - steady solutions are dynamically unstable ,",
    "we have followed the shell dynamics in a fully time - dependent manner .    at very early times , the wind is crushed by ram pressure associated with infalling matter .",
    "wind breakout is delayed by the gravitational force exerted on the shocked material .",
    "the shell must not only be supported by wind ram pressure , but must have sufficent kinetic energy to escape the star s potential well , even while gathering additional mass from the envelope . breakout would occur earlier if either the wind or infall were more anisotropic , or if we were to include the internal shear between the shock surfaces .",
    "bearing in mind the observations of jets and outflows from embedded stars , we acknowledge two important limitations of our model .",
    "first , our assumption of complete , early trapping may be incorrect , because of shell fragmentation .",
    "second , the observed collimation of stellar jets over long distances is not approached asymptotically in our calculation . instead , our shells ,",
    "while they are temporarily elongated , eventually become spherical .",
    "jet collimation may be a consequence of magnetic pinching in the wind itself , or of a cloud background that is very different from the one we assume here .",
    "an initially more anisotropic cloud core will , of course , yield an altered pattern of infall .",
    "alternatively , a shallower falloff in the background density will give rise to crossing shocks in the interaction region ( see , e.g. ,  cant , raga , & binette 1989 ) .",
    "these shocks further aid in wind collimation .",
