    "accurate measurements of particles masses , couplings and widths are possible by measuring production cross sections near threshold .",
    "the possibility of measuring the top quark mass as well as other relevant parameters at a next linear collider ( nlc ) has been under discussion for some years and was nicely review for the group by raja@xcite .",
    "this technique has also been investigated more recently in the context of muon colliders .",

    "@xcite contains a nice review of the most salient experimental measurements that can be done .",
    "this includes not only measurements of the mass and couplings of the top quark from the total cross section , but also extracting information from the various distributions of the detected particles .",
    "these issues carry over completely to the muon collider case , with some important differences in the characteristics of the collider beam having some impact on the sensitivities ( see below ) .",
    "fadin and khoze first demonstrated that the top - quark threshold cross section is calculable since the large top - quark mass puts one in the perturbative regime of qcd , and the large top - quark width effectively screens nonperturbative effects in the final state @xcite .",
    "such studies have since been performed by several groups @xcite .",
    "the phenomenological potential is given at small distance @xmath11 by two - loop perturbative qcd and for large @xmath11 by a fit to quarkonia spectra .",
    "the most important parameters affecting the shape of the threshold cross section are the top quark mass @xmath6 and the strong coupling constant @xmath9 .",
    "the mass determines at what energy the threshold turns on , while the strong coupling determines the binding between the @xmath0 pairs and hence causes in principle a resonance structure in the spectrum .",
    "however , since the top quark mass has turned out to be so large , only the @xmath12 state appears as a structure on the threshold curve .",
    "the stronger the strong coupling , the tighter the binding and the lower the @xmath12 peak occurs in energy .",

    "in addition there is information contained in the various distributions of the final state particles .",
    "the momentum distribution of the top quark pairs as well as the forward - backward asymmetry are sensitive to the top quark width and @xmath13 .",
    "the presence of the higgs boson affects the threshold curve .",
    "this contribution depends on the higgs boson mass and the yukawa coupling with which the higgs boson couples to the top quark .",
    "the yukawa coupling is fixed in the standard model for a given top quark mass , but could be different in extensions to the standard model .",
    "the higgs boson contribution mainly affects the overall normalization of the threshold curve .",
    "since the exchange of a light higgs boson can affect the threshold shape , a scan of the threshold cross section can in principle yield some information about the higgs mass and its yukawa coupling to the top quark .",
    "figure  [ figure8 ] shows the dependence of the threshold curve on the higgs mass , @xmath10 .",
    "however , it may be difficult to disentangle such a higgs effect from two - loop qcd effects , which are not yet fully calculated  @xcite . since one does not expect an accurate measurement of the higgs mass from the @xmath0 threshold",

    "two methods have been used to calculate the threshold cross section .",

    "the other method ( the momentum space approach ) involves solving a bethe - salpeter equation .",
    "the construction and the relationship between the qcd potentials used in each case is subject of recent study@xcite . at a high luminosity muon collider",
    "it is evident that theoretical uncertainties in the threshold cross section might be the limiting factor in the ultimate obtainable precision .",

    "these next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) have not been taken into account even though there contributions can be important .",
    "for example , the @xmath17 relativistic corrections can shift the location of the @xmath12 peak by @xmath18  mev and introduce a shift in the normalization of the total cross section of order @xmath19@xcite .",
    "hoang described a procedure to calculate some of the nnlo corrections to the threshold cross section using nrqcd , an effective field theory of qcd for heavy quarks .",
    "nrqcd does away with the need for a phenomenological potential , and allows at least in principle the calculation of the cross section and all the distributions from the qcd lagrangian .    the abelian part ( i.e. those contributions also present in qed ) of the nnlo corrections calculated by hoang are shown in fig .",

    "if the luminosity available for the threshold measurement is significantly less than 100  fb@xmath34 , one can regard the value of @xmath35 coming from other sources as an input , and thereby improve the top - quark mass determination .",

    "differences of cross sections at energies below , at , and above the resonance peak , along with the location of the resonance peak , have different dependencies on the parameters @xmath6 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath47 and should allow their determination .",
    "consequently , the scan procedure described here can be further optimized for extraction of a particular parameter@xcite .",
    "the production of top quark pairs at energies above the threshold region at muon colliders will provide a great opportunity for searching for anomalous couplings and rare decays of the top quark .",
    "the production of top quarks can be used to test couplings to the neutral gauge bosons @xmath48 in the production and to the @xmath2 in the decays .",
    "an important new feature of top quark decays is the fact that the top quark decays before it has a chance to hadronize , so the spin information can be preserved from production to decay .",
    "this introduces the possibility that spin correlations between @xmath49 and @xmath50 might even be measurable@xcite .",

    "a unique feature of the muon collider is the ability to produce the higgs boson in the @xmath62-channel@xcite .",
    "this possibility arises because the higgs boson coupling to leptons is proportional to their mass . since the higgs boson might be a very narrow object",

    "an interesting set of decays are flavor changing ones , which for the standard model higgs boson are completely absent .",
    "many extensions to the standard model have flavor changing processes at the tree - level , and then the question becomes why they are so small in the physics that we see . if the higgs boson is heavier than the top quark then one can consider the possibility that the higgs boson decays via @xmath63 .",

    "instead a reasonable choice is to assume that the flavor changing couplings adhere to the same hierarchy as the fermion masses@xcite @xmath66 and tree - level fc couplings can be substantial for the top quark .",
    "this model ( like all two higgs doublet models ) is parameterized by a mixing angle @xmath67 between the two neutral scalars .    an important consideration for producing higgs bosons in the @xmath62-channel , is the relative size of the beam width to the width of the higgs boson@xcite . a sufficiently sharp beam ,",

    "a possible manifestation of new physics is resonance structure in the @xmath0 mass distribution .",
    "the tevatron is sensitive to both color singlet and color octet , while at the lhc should be relatively insensitive to new color singlet gauge bosons ( like @xmath89 ) because gluon fusion is the dominant means of producing @xmath0 pairs .",
