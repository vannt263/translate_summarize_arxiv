    "the total intensity of the cosmic far - infrared background ( cfirb ) is now established with absolute photometry @xcite .",

    "this halo modeling allows a way to describe the galaxy clustering power spectrum and correlation function through the halo occupation number describing the number of galaxies in a given dark matter halo as a function of the halo mass .",
    "recent improvements in the halo model involve an occupation number description that takes into account for the luminosity dependence of the satellites through what are now called conditional luminosity functions ( clfs ; @xcite ) .    while an attempt was made to incorporate clfs to describe the cfirb power spectrum ( @xcite",
    "; see recent works in @xcite ) , this was based on a phenomenological model for the number counts and luminosity functions ( lfs ) of far - ir sources @xcite .",
    "the number counts and lf measurements from the _ herschel _ space observatory now allow us to both improve the model and extract parameters of the underlying clf description .",
    "separately , modeling of recent measurements of the cfirb anisotropy power spectrum with _ herschel _ and planck , and the dusty galaxy signal in cmb secondary anisotropy data , is somewhat controversial . the best - fit parameters of the original study @xcite either had a power - law slope for satellites that was steeper than 1.3 or had a relation between the satellite mass scale @xmath15 and the minimum halo mass to host a galaxy @xmath16 such that @xmath17 .",

    "they found that the most efficient halo mass scale for starformation is @xmath129 , which is closer to the typical value of optical galaxies in the standard halo model @xcite .",

    "the difference with @xmath141 and @xmath142 between the two works comes in part from the fact that the model we have presented here accounts for that the brighter satellites are in more massive halos and in part from our rescaling of the cirrus amplitude . as discussed in @xcite , @xcite overestimated the cirrus contamination and underestimates the clustering power spectrum of the cosmic infrared background .",
    "we have refitted the cirrus amplitude as part of the joint fit to the power spectrum measurements using both a halo model and a power - law power spectrum for cirrus .",
    "the simple halo occupation number used in @xcite is not able to make a distinction between the luminosity and mass of satellite galaxies .",
    "moreover , in the current description , the shape of the luminosity - mass relation determines the strength of the 1-halo term , while in the standard halo - model , the strength of the 1-halo term is mainly determined by the slope of the halo occupation number of satellite galaxies . as the 1-halo term",
    "is clearly detected in the _ herschel _ cfirb power spectrum the previous results were biased by an incorrect model that attempted to model - fit high signal - to - noise power spectrum measurements .",
    "we are also finding an amplitude for the cirrus contamination which is smaller than @xmath115 : @xmath143 .",
    "a reduced cirrus contamination requires a reduced relative amplitude between the 1-halo and 2-halo terms that can be achieved with a lower slope for the satellite contributions .",
    "we note also that the fit to the cirrus amplitude confirms that the previous analysis of the same clustering data in @xcite overestimated the cirrus contribution as already has been found by the @xcite , where a factor @xmath144 of difference was found in the cirrus contamination .",
    "the model used in this work is hence able to alleviate the tension between planck and herschel analysis .    in terms of the duty cycle parameters , at @xmath145 , where the constrain came only from the luminosity function data , we found a weak constraint on the duty cycle , that is @xmath146 at @xmath147 confidence level .",
    "the amplitude of the luminosity function is in fact affected by both the duty cycle and other parameters of the luminosity mass relation , in particular @xmath73 and @xmath45 .",
    "thus , in the absence of other constraints , the duty cycle can not be measured efficiently . on the other hand",
    ", the parameters of the @xmath110 relation also determine the hod and the relative amplitude of 1-halo and 2-halo terms .",
    "combining clustering measurements and luminosity function data can hence strongly improve the constraints on the duty cycle .",
    "also the @xmath145 luminosity function is better determined in narrow , deeper surveys compared to the case of the @xmath145 lf .",
    "all this results in a determination of high - z duty cycle parameters with relatively small uncertainties .",
    "we have found that the duty cycle generally decrease with redshift until @xmath148 and slowly increase again for higher @xmath103 ( see table [ highz_table ] and fig .",

    "in @xcite the authors have excluded very low duty cycle values ( @xmath150 ) finding that the planck power spectrum data favor duty cycles close to unity .",
    "our results lie in the middle between these two extreme cases .",
    "however in @xcite the duty cycle parameter is estimated by comparing the shot noise predicted for a fixed @xmath34 to the results of the empirical model of @xcite , rather than fitting to the data .",
    "moreover the model used here differs in the description of the luminosity mass - relation and introduces a possible redshift evolution both for the duty cycle and for the 250 @xmath0 m luminosity - halo mass relation .",
    "interestingly our constraints are much more similar to the results of @xcite , where the model we are using here , with some differences in the l - m relation and its redshift dependence , was also used to analyze the uv luminosity function and two point correlation function data of starforming galaxies in the range @xmath151 . in that work",
    "@xcite used @xmath34 as an input parameter rather than as a free parameters and found that extremely short ( @xmath152 ) and extremely long ( @xmath153 ) duty cycles are ruled out at the @xmath154 confidence level .",
    "our results also suggest a mid range for @xmath34 . the agreement could imply that a large fraction of the uv - selected starforming galaxy sample studied in @xcite",
    "could also be responsible for the cfirb anisotropies .",
    "this could be directly tested via a cross - correlation between the two datasets and such studies are expected in the near future given the _",

    "in section  [ model ] we described the duty cycle in terms of the duration of the starformation @xmath36 in the halos with respect to the time interval @xmath37 covered by the survey . a long duty cycle @xmath155 implies a starformation time scale that is @xmath156 , while small duty cycles with @xmath157 correspond to the opposite case with @xmath158 .",
    "the central value with @xmath159 implies @xmath160 . in terms of the physical time , once accounted for the time interval spanned by each redshift bin , the duty cycles listed in table  [ highz_table ] correspond to a starformation phase lasting for @xmath161 gyr .",
    "such a long starformtaion timescale is consistent with what has been suggested in @xcite and the physical model of @xcite .",

    "our analysis suggests that the l - m relation has a redshift dependence , with @xmath45 that decreases for higher redshifts ( see eq .",

    "we parameterize the opacity with a power low @xmath178 with the power index in the range @xmath179 .",
    "the calculation requires the spectral energy distribution of dust and we assume a thermal black - body spectrum wit dust temperature in the range @xmath180 .",
