    "it is of vital importance to identify the first generation stars in the universe , i.e. , totally metal - free ( @xmath1 ) , population ( pop ) iii stars .",
    "the impact of the formation of pop iii stars on the evolution of the universe depends on their typical masses .",
    "recent numerical models have shown that , the first stars are as massive as @xmath2 100 @xmath3 @xcite . the formation of long - lived low mass pop iii stars may be inefficient because of slow cooling of metal - free gas cloud , which is consistent with the failure of attempts to find pop iii stars .",
    "however , it is still controversial how the initial mass function ( imf ) depends on the metallicity .    in the early universe",
    ", the chemical enrichment by a single sn can dominate the preexisting metal contents , because the timescale of mixing in the interstellar medium may be longer than the age of the galaxy .",
    "thus the abundance pattern of the enriched gas may reflect nucleosynthesis in the single sn ( @xcite ) .",
    "low - mass stars formed in the chemically enriched gas have long lifetimes and are observed as extremely metal - poor ( emp ) stars and hyper metal - poor ( hmp ) stars ( @xcite ) .",
    "therefore the abundance patterns of emp and hmp stars reflect the yield of a single sn at extremely metal - poor environment , thus constraining the nature of the first ( pop iii ) sne and imf .    here",
    "we summarize the comparisons between the abundance patterns of the emp stars ( @xcite ) and hmp stars , he01075240 ( @xcite ) and he13272326 ( @xcite ) .",
    "we have calculated the chemical yields for various metallicities , including hypernovae ( hne : see next section ) ( @xcite ) .    in the metal - free stellar evolution , because of the lack of initial cno elements , the cno cycle dose not operate until the star contracts to a much higher central temperature ( @xmath4 k ) than population ii stars , where the 3@xmath5 reaction produces a tiny fraction of @xmath6c ( @xmath7 in mass fraction ) . however , the late core evolution and the resulting fe core masses of metal - free stars are not significantly different from metal - rich stars .",
    "therefore , [ @xmath5/fe ] is larger by only a fraction of @xmath8 dex and the abundance ratios of the iron - peak elements are not so different from metal - rich stars , except for mn . on the other hand ,",
    "the cno cycle produces only a small amount of @xmath9n , which is transformed into @xmath10ne during he - burning .",
    "the surplus of neutrons in @xmath10ne increases the abundances of odd - z elements ( na , al , p , ... ) .",
    "therefore , the metallicity effect is realized for odd - z elements and the inverse ratio of @xmath5 elements and their isotopes ( e.g. , @xmath11c@xmath12c ) .",
    "[ na / fe ] and [ al / fe ] of metal - free stars are smaller by @xmath13 and @xmath14 dex than solar abundance stars , which are consistent with the observed trends .",
    "figure [ fig : yield - z ] shows the abundance ratios of pop iii ( @xmath1 ) sne ii and hne as a function of the progenitor mass ( left ) and the imf weighted yields of sne ii and hne as a function of metallicity ( right ) .",
    "the solid and dashed lines show the sn ii and hn yields , respectively .",
    "the yield masses of @xmath5 elements ( o , ne , mg , si , s , ar , ca , and ti ) are larger for more massive stars because of the larger mantle mass .",
    "since the fe mass is @xmath15 , being independent of the progenitor s mass for @xmath16=1 , the abundance ratio [ @xmath5/fe ] is larger for more massive stars . for hne ,",
    "although fe production is larger for more massive stars because of the higher energy , [ @xmath5/fe ] is almost constant independent of the stellar mass because we assume the mass - cut to get [ o / fe ] @xmath17 .",
    "regarding supernova ( sn ) yields , one of the most interesting recent developments is the discovery of hyper - energetic supernovae , whose kinetic energy ( ke ) exceeds @xmath18erg , about 10 times the ke of normal core - collapse sne ( hereafter @xmath19erg ) ( @xcite ) .",
    "such sne are called hypernovae ( hne ) .",
    "nucleosynthesis in hne has some special features , so that the contribution of hne in early chemical evolution can be seen the abundance patterns of hmp / emp stars .",
    "the hypernovae 1998bw and 2003dh were clearly linked to the gamma - ray bursts grb 980425 ( galama et al .",
    "1998 ) and grb 030329 ( stanek et al . 2003 ; hjorth et al . 2003 ) , thus establishing the connection between long grbs and core - collapse supernovae ( sne ) .",
    "sne  1998bw and 2003dh were exceptional for sne  ic : they were as luminous at peak as a sn  ia , indicating that they synthesized 0.3 - 0.5 @xmath3 of @xmath20ni , and their kinetic energy ( ke ) were estimated as @xmath21 30 - 50 ( iwamoto et al . 1998 ; woosley et al . 1999 ; nakamura et al .",
    "2001a ) .",
    "other hne have been recognized , such as sn  1997ef ( iwamoto et al .",
    "2000 ; mazzali , iwamoto , & nomoto 2000 ) and sn  2002ap ( mazzali et al .",
    "these hypernovae span a wide range of properties , although they all appear to be highly energetic compared to normal core - collapse sne .",
    "the mass estimates , obtained from fitting the optical light curves and spectra , place hypernovae at the high - mass end of sn progenitors .",
    "in contrast , sne ii 1997d and 1999br were very faint sne with very low ke ( turatto et al . 1998 ; hamuy 2003 ; zampieri et al . 2003 ) . in the diagram that shows @xmath22 and the mass of @xmath20ni ejected @xmath23ni ) as a function of the main - sequence mass @xmath24 of the progenitor star , therefore , we propose that sne from stars with @xmath25 20 - 25 @xmath3 have different @xmath22 and @xmath23ni ) , with a bright , energetic `` hypernova branch '' at one extreme and a faint , low - energy sn branch at the other ( nomoto et al . 2003 ) . for the faint sne ,",
    "the explosion energy was so small that most @xmath20ni fell back onto the compact remnant .",
    "the extreme cases of the faint sn branch may correspond to hmp stars as will be discussed below . between the two branches , there may be a variety of sne ( hamuy 2003 ) .",
    "this trend might be interpreted as follows .",
    "stars more massive than @xmath2 25 @xmath3 form a black hole at the end of their evolution .",
    "stars with non - rotating black holes are likely to collapse `` quietly '' ejecting a small amount of heavy elements ( faint supernovae ) . in contrast , stars with rotating black holes are likely to give rise to hypernovae .",
    "the hypernova progenitors might form the rapidly rotating cores by spiraling - in of a companion star in a binary system .      in core - collapse supernovae / hypernovae , stellar material undergoes shock heating and subsequent explosive nucleosynthesis .",
    "iron - peak elements are produced in two distinct regions , which are characterized by the peak temperature , @xmath26 , of the shocked material . for @xmath27k",
    ", material undergoes complete si burning whose products include co , zn , v , and some cr after radioactive decays . for @xmath28k @xmath29k ,",
    "incomplete si burning takes place and its after decay products include cr and mn ( e.g. , nakamura et al . 1999 ) .",
    "we note the following characteristics of nucleosynthesis with very large explosion energies ( nakamura et al .",
    "2001b ; nomoto et al .",
    "2001 ; umeda & nomoto 2005 ) :    \\(1 ) both complete and incomplete si - burning regions shift outward in mass compared with normal supernovae , so that the mass ratio between the complete and incomplete si - burning regions becomes larger . as a result ,",
    "higher energy explosions tend to produce larger [ ( zn , co , v)/fe ] and smaller [ ( mn , cr)/fe ] , which can explain the trend observed in very metal - poor stars ( umeda & nomoto 2005 ) .",
    "\\(2 ) in the complete si - burning region of hypernovae , elements produced by @xmath5-rich freezeout are enhanced .",
    "hence , elements synthesized through capturing of @xmath5-particles , such as @xmath30ti , @xmath31cr , and @xmath32ge ( decaying into @xmath30ca , @xmath31ti , and @xmath32zn , respectively ) are more abundant .",
    "hypernova nucleosynthesis may have made an important contribution to galactic chemical evolution . in the early galactic epoch when the galaxy was not yet chemically well - mixed",
    ", [ fe / h ] may well be determined by mostly a single sn event ( audouze & silk 1995 ) .",
    "the formation of metal - poor stars is supposed to be driven by a supernova shock , so that [ fe / h ] is determined by the ejected fe mass and the amount of circumstellar hydrogen swept - up by the shock wave ( ryan , norris , & beers 1996 ) .",
    "then , hypernovae with larger @xmath22 are likely to induce the formation of stars with smaller [ fe / h ] , because the mass of interstellar hydrogen swept up by a hypernova is roughly proportional to @xmath22 ( ryan et al .",
    "1996 ; shigeyama & tsujimoto 1998 ) and the ratio of the ejected iron mass to @xmath22 is smaller for hypernovae than for normal supernovae .",
    "here we make comparisons between the theoretical yields and the abundance patterns of the emp stars , given in cayrel et al .",
    "( 2004 ) and honda et al .",
    "( 2004 ) where the data of 35 and 22 metal - poor stars are provided , respectively .",
    "though the trends of elemental abundance ratios are similar to those found earlier ( @xcite ) , cayrel et al .",
    "( 2004 ) found much smaller dispersions .",
    "first the theoretical yields are compared with the averaged abundance pattern of four emp stars , cs  22189 - 009 , cd-38:245 , cs  22172 - 002 and cs  22885 - 096 , which have low metallicities ( @xmath33}<-3.5 $ ] ) and normal [ c / fe ] @xmath34 ( @xcite ) .",
    "figures  [ fig7 ] show the comparison with the 25 @xmath3 model of normal energy explosion ( @xmath35 : left ) and hyper energetic explosion ( @xmath36 : right ) .    in the normal sn model , the mass - cut is determined to eject fe of mass 0.14 @xmath3 ) .",
    "then the yields are in reasonable agreements with the observations for the ratios [ ( na , mg , si)/fe ] , but give too small [ ( sc , ti , mn , co , ni , zn)/fe ] and too large [ ( ca , cr)/fe ] .    in the hn model ( right ) ,",
    "these ratios are in much better agreement with observations .",
    "the ratios of co / fe and zn / fe are larger in higher energy explosions since both co and zn are synthesized in complete si burning at high temperature region . to account for the observations , materials synthesized in a deeper complete si - burning region",
    "should be ejected , but the amount of fe should be small .",
    "this is realized in the mixing - fallback models ( umeda & nomoto 2002 , 2005 ) .    in the hn model ( right ) , the low - density progenitor model is used ( @xcite ) to enhance the @xmath5-rich freeze - out . as a result ,",
    "the sc / fe and ti / fe ratios are especially enhanced .",
    "it has been found that , in the observed abundances of halo stars , there are significant differences between the abundance patterns in the iron - peak elements below and above [ fe / h]@xmath37 - @xmath38 .",
    "\\(1 ) for [ fe / h]@xmath39 , the mean values of [ cr / fe ] and [ mn / fe ] decrease toward smaller metallicity , while [ co / fe ] increases ( mcwilliam et al . 1995 ; ryan et al .",
    "cayrel et al .",
    "( 2004 ) found much flatter trend of [ mn / fe ] .",
    "\\(2 ) [ zn / fe]@xmath40 for [ fe / h ] @xmath41 to @xmath42 ( sneden , gratton , & crocker 1991 ) , while at [ fe / h ] @xmath43 , [ zn / fe ] increases toward smaller metallicity ( cayrel et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "the larger [ ( zn , co)/fe ] and smaller [ ( mn , cr)/fe ] in the supernova ejecta can be realized if the mass ratio between the complete si burning region and the incomplete si burning region is larger , or equivalently if deep material from the complete si - burning region is ejected by mixing or aspherical effects .",
    "this can be realized if ( 1 ) the mass cut between the ejecta and the compact remnant is located at smaller @xmath44 ( nakamura et al .",
    "1999 ) , ( 2 ) @xmath22 is larger to move the outer edge of the complete si burning region to larger @xmath44 ( nakamura et al .",
    "2001b ) , or ( 3 ) asphericity in the explosion is larger .    among these possibilities ,",
    "a large explosion energy @xmath22 enhances @xmath5-rich freezeout , which results in an increase of the local mass fractions of zn and co , while cr and mn are not enhanced ( umeda & nomoto 2002 ) . models with @xmath45 do not produce sufficiently large [ zn / fe ] . to be compatible with the observations of [ zn / fe ] @xmath46 , the explosion energy must be much larger , i.e. , @xmath47 for @xmath48 , i.e. , hypernova - like explosions of massive stars ( @xmath49 ) with @xmath50 are responsible for the production of zn .    in the hypernova models , moreover",
    ", the overproduction of ni , as found in the simple `` deep '' mass - cut model ( 1 ) , can be avoided ( umeda & nomoto 2005 ) .",
    "therefore , if hypernovae made significant contributions to the early galactic chemical evolution , it could explain the large zn and co abundances and the small mn and cr abundances observed in very metal - poor stars .",
    "figures [ fig4c]-[fig4a ] show the theoretical trial to reproduce the observed trend in cayrel et al .",
    "( 2004 ) and honda et al .",
    "( 2004 ) with the supernova - induced star formation model .",
    "the supernova models with @xmath51 ( 13 , 1 ) , ( 15 , 1 ) , ( 20 , 10 ) , ( 25 , 10 ) , ( 30 , 20 ) , ( 40 , 30 ) , and ( 50 , 40 ) are used , where the stars more massive than 20 @xmath52 are assumed to explode as hne .",
    "these models are located at [ fe / h ] = log@xmath53 ( fe/@xmath54 , and can be consistent with the observed trend even without mixing of materials in the interstellar medium .",
    "since hne may explode as jet - like explosions , the hn models adopt the mixing - fallback and the `` low - density '' model ( see umeda & nomoto 2005 ; tominaga et al .",
    "2005 for details ) .",
    "the trends of most elements can be well reproduced by these models , except for the overproduction of cr and the underproduction of k. for cr , only the gradient of cr with [ fe / h ] can be reproduced .",
    "recently two hmp stars , he01075240 ( @xcite ) and he13272326 ( @xcite ) , were discovered , whose metallicity fe / h is smaller than 1/100,000 of the sun ( i.e. , [ fe / h ] @xmath0 ) , being more than a factor of 10 smaller than previously known emp stars .",
    "these discoveries have raised an important question as to whether the observed low mass ( @xmath2 0.8  @xmath3 ) hmp stars are actually pop iii stars , or whether these hmp stars are the second generation stars being formed from gases which were chemically enriched by a single first generation supernova ( sn ) ( @xcite ) .",
    "this is related to the questions of how the initial mass function depends on the metallicity . thus identifying the origin of these hmp stars is indispensable to the understanding of the earliest star formation and chemical enrichment history of the universe .",
    "the elemental abundance patterns of these hmp stars provide a key to the answer to the above questions .",
    "the abundance patterns of he13272326 and he01075240 are quite unusual ( fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) . the striking similarity of [ fe / h ] ( = @xmath55 and @xmath56 for he13272326 and he01075240 , respectively ) and [ c / fe ] ( @xmath57 ) suggests that similar chemical enrichment mechanisms operated in forming these hmp stars .",
    "however , the n / c and ( na , mg , al)/fe ratios are more than a factor of 10 larger in he13272326 . in order for the theoretical models to be viable , these similarities and differences should be explained self - consistently .",
    "iwamoto et al .",
    "( 2005 ) showed that the above similarities and variations of the hmp stars can be well reproduced in unified manner by nucleosynthesis in the core - collapse `` faint '' supernovae ( sne ) which undergo mixing - and - fallback ( @xcite ) .",
    "we thus argue that the hmp stars are the second generation low mass stars , whose formation was induced by the first generation ( pop iii ) sn with efficient cooling of carbon - enriched gases .",
    "we consider a model that c - rich emp stars are produced in the ejecta of ( almost ) metal - free supernova mixed with extremely metal - poor interstellar matter .",
    "the similarity of [ fe / h ] and [ c / fe ] suggests that the progenitor s masses of pop iii sne were similar for these hmp stars .",
    "we therefore choose the pop iii 25 @xmath3 models and calculate their evolution and explosion ( @xcite ) .",
    "the abundance distribution after explosive nucleosynthesis is shown in figure  [ fig5 ] ( left ) for the kinetic energy @xmath22 of the ejecta @xmath58 .",
    "the abundance distribution for @xmath59 is similar . in the `` faint '' sn model , most part of materials that underwent explosive nucleosynthesis",
    "are decelerated by the influence of the gravitational pull ( @xcite ) and will eventually fall back onto the central compact object .",
    "the explosion energies of @xmath60 and @xmath61 lead to the mass cut @xmath62 and @xmath63 , respectively , and the former and the latter models are used to explain the abundance patterns of he13272326 and he01075240 , respectively .    during the explosion , the sn ejecta is assumed to undergo mixing , i.e. , materials are first uniformly mixed in the mixing - region extending from @xmath64 to the mass cut at @xmath65 ( where @xmath44 is the mass coordinate and stands for the mass interior to the radius @xmath66 ) as indicated in figure  [ fig5 ] ( left ) , and only a tiny fraction , @xmath67 , of the mixed material is ejected from the mixing - region together with all materials at @xmath68 ; most materials interior to the mass cut fall back onto the central compact object . such a mixing - fallback mechanism ( which might mimic a jet - like explosion )",
    "is required to extract fe - peak and other heavy elements from the deep fallback region into the ejecta ( @xcite ) .",
    "figure  [ fig5 ] ( right ) shows the calculated abundance ratios in the sn ejecta models for suitable choice of @xmath67 which are respectively compared with the observed abundances of the two hmp stars . to reproduce [ c / fe ] @xmath2 + 4 and other abundance ratios of hmp stars in figure  [ fig5 ] ( right ) ,",
    "the ejected mass of fe is only 1.0 @xmath69 for he13272326 and 1.4 @xmath70 for he01075240 .",
    "these sne are much fainter in the radioactive tail than the typical sne and form massive black holes of @xmath71 .",
    "the question is what causes the large difference in the amount of na - mg - al between the sne that produced he01075240 and he13272326 . because very little na - mg - al is ejected from the mixed fallback materials ( i.e. , @xmath72 ) compared with the materials exterior to the mass cut , the ejected amount of na - mg - al is very sensitive to the location of the mass cut .",
    "as indicated in figure  6 , @xmath73 is smaller ( i.e. , the fallback mass is smaller ) in the model for he13272326 ( @xmath62 ) than he01075240 ( @xmath74 ) , so that a larger amount of na - mg - al is ejected from the sn for he13272326 .",
    "since @xmath73 is sensitively determined by the explosion energy , the ( na - mg - al)/fe ratios among the hmp stars are predicted to show significant variations and can be used to constrain @xmath16 .",
    "note also that the explosion energies of these sn models with fallback are not necessarily very small ( i.e. , @xmath75 ) .",
    "further these explosion energies are consistent with those observed in the actual `` faint '' sne ( @xcite ) .",
    "the next question is why he13272326 has a much larger n / c ratio than he01075240 . in our models ,",
    "a significant amount of n is produced by the mixing between the he convective shell and the h - rich envelope during the presupernova evolution ( @xcite ) , where c created by the triple-@xmath5 reaction is burnt into n through the cn cycle .",
    "for the he13272326 model , we assume about 30 times larger diffusion coefficients ( i.e. , faster mixing ) for the h and he convective shells to overcome an inhibiting effect of the mean molecular weight gradient ( and also entropy gradient ) between h and he layers .",
    "thus , larger amounts of protons are carried into the he convective shell .",
    "then [ c / n ] @xmath34 is realized as observed in he13272326 .",
    "such an enhancement of mixing efficiency has been suggested to take place in the present - day massive stars known as fast rotators , which show various n and he enrichments due to different rotation velocities ( @xcite ) .",
    "recent numerical models have shown that , the first stars are as massive as @xmath2 100 @xmath3 ( abel et al . 2002 ) .",
    "the formation of long - lived low mass pop iii stars may be inefficient because of slow cooling of metal free gas cloud , which is consistent with the failure of attempts to find pop iii stars .",
    "if the most fe deficient star , he0107 - 5240 , is a pop iii low mass star that has gained its metal from a companion star or interstellar matter ( yoshii 1981 ) , would it mean that the above theoretical arguments are incorrect and that such low mass pop iii stars have not been discovered only because of the difficulty in the observations ?    based on the results in the earlier section , we suggest that the first generation supernovae were the explosion of @xmath2 20 - 130 @xmath3 stars and some of them produced c - rich , fe - poor ejecta . then the low mass star with even [ fe / h ] @xmath0 can form from the gases of mixture of such a supernova ejecta and the ( almost ) metal - free interstellar matter , because the gases can be efficiently cooled by enhanced c and o ( [ c / h ] @xmath76 ) .",
    "in contrast to the core - collapse supernovae of 20 - 130 @xmath3 stars , the observed abundance patterns can not be explained by the explosions of more massive , 130 - 300 @xmath3 stars .",
    "these stars undergo pair - instability supernovae ( pisne ) and are disrupted completely ( e.g. , umeda & nomoto 2002 ; heger & woosley 2002 ) , which can not be consistent with the large c / fe observed in hmp stars and other c - rich emp stars .",
    "the abundance ratios of iron - peak elements ( [ zn / fe ] @xmath77 and [ co / fe ] @xmath78 ) in the pisn ejecta ( fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] ; umeda & nomoto 2002 ; heger & woosley 2002 ) can not explain the large zn / fe and co / fe in the typical emp stars ( mcwilliam et al .",
    "1995 ; norris et al .",
    "2001 ; cayrel et al . 2003 ) and cs22949 - 037 either .",
    "therefore the supernova progenitors that are responsible for the formation of emp stars are most likely in the range of @xmath79 @xmath3 , but not more massive than 130 @xmath3 .",
    "this upper limit depends on the stability of massive stars ."
