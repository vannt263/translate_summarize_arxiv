    "recently appeared a number of papers @xcite,@xcite claiming that the chromosphere - corona transition region of the solar atmosphere should be considered in the non - collisional approximation . in these papers",
    "it is said that ion - acoustic turbulence is the reason of differentiation of solar plasma into two regions with high ( @xmath0  k ) and low ( @xmath1  k ) electron temperature , correspondingly .",
    "in this paper we present the solution of the equation of balance between the thermal heating and radiative cooling with classical electron conductivity .",
    "this solution explain differentiation of solar plasma to the high and low electron temperature .",
    "the characteristic thickness of the chromosphere - corona transition region is greater then thickness corresponding to the free path for thermal electron collisions and such temperature distribution agrees with observed solar radiation .",
    "in this paragraph we obtain temperature @xmath2 distribution with depth @xmath3 for the heating solar plasma by thermal flux , taking radiation loss into account .    _",
    "the thickness _ is defined as    @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the number density of particles .",
    "the thickness represents the number of atoms in the column of unit cross - section along the direction of thermal flux .",
    "the distribution @xmath6 can be obtained with the help of the equation of balance between the thermal heating and radiative cooling :    @xmath7 where @xmath8 is electron thermal conductivity ,    @xmath9 @xcite,@xcite , @xmath10 is the distribution of radiative energy losses with temperature ( see fig.[fig1 ] ) ,  @xmath11  stationary thermal heating at the infinity .",
    "parameter @xmath12 of the equation ( [ e : tepl ] ) are known : @xmath10 was taken from @xcite.to determine the number density dependence on the temperature @xmath13 let us consider the cases of slow and fast heating .",
    "one has to specify doundary conditions for the temperature in the equation ( [ e : tepl ] ) : @xmath14    according to @xcite , to obtain the dependence @xmath6 from the equation of the thermal balance ( [ e : tepl ] ) one has to multiply both parts of the equation ( [ e : tepl ] ) by @xmath15 . then after simple manipulations we have the following expression for the thermal flux @xmath16 :    @xmath17 where the thermal flux @xmath16 is defined as : @xmath18    to express ( [ e : f(t ) ] ) in dimensionless form we multiply ( [ e : f(t ) ] ) by    @xmath19 where @xmath20 are the units of the depth , concentration , temperature and electron conductivity , correspondingly .",
    "we obtain @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the coulomb logarithm , @xmath23 and @xmath24 @xmath25 let us choose the units to be the following ( recall that these values are simply our choosen units and not the actual values at the infinity ) : @xmath26 @xmath27 @xmath28 from equation ( [ e : deff ] ) we obtain the following expression for @xmath3 : @xmath29 we choose the origin of @xmath3-coordinate to be the point where the temperature has a fixed value @xmath30 , @xmath31 ( @xmath32 when @xmath33 ) .    finally , to get the distribution @xmath34 we can find @xmath35 from equation ( [ e : f(t ) ] ) and then , after putting @xmath35 into ( [ e : deff ] ) , obtain @xmath36 and thus @xmath34 .    in the case of fast heating , when concentration is constant throughout the layer depth ( @xmath37 ) , let us set @xmath38 , or in dimensionless form @xmath39",
    ".    in the case of slow heating gas pressure is constant throughout the layer depth ( @xmath40 ) . in this case , because @xmath41 concentration becomes @xmath42 or in dimensionless form : @xmath43    the dependence of the thermal flux on the temperature @xmath44 for the cases @xmath37 and @xmath40 is shown in fig.[fig2 ] .",
    "here @xmath45 the dependence of the temperature along the depth @xmath6 for the cases @xmath37 and @xmath40 is shown in fig.[fig3 ] .",
    "classical collisional heat conduction @xcite,@xcite is valid if two following conditions are satisfied :    @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the mean free path for thermal electron collisions , @xmath50 is the characteristic scale of length on the temperature profile .    condition ( [ e : cond1 ] ) may be written as : @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the characteristic depth for equilibrium temperature distribution obtained above , and @xmath47 is the thickness corresponding to the free path for thermal electron collisions .",
    "@xmath53 @xmath54    the dependence @xmath55 for the cases @xmath37 and @xmath40 and the dependence @xmath56 are shown in fig.[fig4 ] .    as we can see from fig.[fig4",
    "] @xmath57 , that is the characteristic thickness at which temperature is changing is more then thickness corresponding to the free path for thermal electron collisions in 400 - 500 times . for example , on the temperature @xmath58 temperature is changing on the 35 km and the free path for thermal electron collisions 70 m.    thus the chromosphere - corona transition region of the solar atmosphere shall be considered in the collisional approximation .",
    "linear theory of the thermal instability was constructed in monography @xcite due to field . the uniform medium in the thermal and mechanical balance in linear theory is characterised by 3 dimensionless parameters @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 .",
    "if the heating is such that energy gain per second to the gramm of substance is now dependent on temperature and density , and cooling of the medium becomes formed by volume radiation energy losses ( @xmath62 ) , than the parameter @xmath59 will depend only on temperature . and in this case @xmath59 is the logarithmic derivative of @xmath63    @xmath64 parameter @xmath60 characterises comparative significance of the thermal conductivity .",
    "if the conductivity is defined only by free electrons ( [ e : kappa ] ) , then    @xmath65 that is , @xmath60 also depends only on the temperature ; here @xmath66 is the effective molecular weight ( for plasma with cosmic abundance of elements @xmath67 ) .",
    "dependence of @xmath59 and @xmath60 on the temperature is shown in the fig.[fig5 ] .",
    "we assume @xmath68 in the equation ( [ e : beta ] ) .    on figure 7",
    "we can see regions where perturbations of the following types can be unstable : 1 ) _ isobaric perturbations _ , for which @xmath40 .",
    "regions where @xmath69 correspond to isobaric perturbations .",
    "this mode is called _ condensation _ mode of thermal instability .",
    "2 ) in regions where @xmath70 _ adiabatic _ ( entropy @xmath71 ) perturbations are unstable .",
    "this mode of thermal instability is named _ wave _ or _",
    "sonic_. 3 ) in regions with @xmath72 _ isochoric _ ( @xmath73 ) perturbations are unstable @xcite .",
    "let @xcite,16 :    @xmath74 @xmath75 @xmath76    on the scales which are smaller than critical @xcite,26 , thermal instability is stabilized by condactivity : @xmath77 @xmath78 for the condensation and wave mode .",
    "these values of thickness which also depend only on temperature , are shown in the fig.[fig7 ] .",
    "the values of characteristic thickness which correspond to the biggest increase rate of thermal instability are @xcite,46 :    @xmath79    @xmath80 for the condensation and wave mode , correspondingly ; they are also shown in the fig.[fig7 ] .",
    "the characteristic thicknesses corresponding to the stationary chromosphere heating in the cases @xmath40 and @xmath73 for the temperature profiles are shown in fig.[fig7 ] .",
    "at all points of distribution the balance between the thermal heating and radiative cooling has its place .",
    "let us look at fig.[fig7 ] .",
    "if @xmath81 , then perturbations are smoothened out by electron conductivity , if @xmath82 , then pertrubations will grow .",
    "note , that our solutions ( in the cases @xmath83 and @xmath37 ) are crossed by the curve @xmath84 corresponding to condensation instability .",
    "then , if in the places of instability there is a spontaneous change of the temperature profile , the profile will return to its original position .",
    "so , we have undrestood that the temperature profile can not be flatter than equilibrium plofile .",
    "it also can not be steeper , because then the same temperature will be accumulated at smaller thickness , so the emission in this temperature range will be lower .",
    "the ability to emit of a certain region is named the emission measure ( @xmath85 ) .",
    "@xmath86 here @xmath87 is the length of emitting region along the line of sight , @xmath88 is the interval of length .",
    "differential emission measure ( @xmath89 ) is the derivative of emission measure with respect to temperature .",
    "let us rewrite @xmath89 in terms of @xmath3 : @xmath91    now , we can calculate the distribution @xmath92 for the cases @xmath37 and @xmath40 , using the dependences @xmath36 and @xmath93 .",
    "the result and measured dme points ( for different lines ) is shown in the fig.[fig8 ] .",
    "the distribution of temperature with depth was found , assuming that the electon conductivity had place , and at all points of distribution the balance between the thermal heating and radiative cooling had place .",
    "our solution is stable ( see iv ) and observed uv - radiation can be explained by it ( see v ) .",
    "the obtained results can be used to show that temperatures are distributed in such a way that _ classical collisional _ heat conduction is valid in the chromosphere - corona transition region of the solar atmosphere , because the characteristic thickness , at which temperature is changing greater then thickness , corresponds to the free path for thermal electron collisions .",
