    "hole doping of cuprate superconductors removes electrons from the antibonding planar cu@xmath1o@xmath2 states ; thus increasing doping is expected to shorten the planar cu  o bonds .",
    "all accessible crystallographic data , however , give evidence for a significant deviation from the pauling - type contraction of covalent bonds on increasing covalency . between the onset of superconductivity at @xmath3(2 ) , and the closure of the large pseudogap at @xmath4(2 ) the basal plane area ( @xmath5 or @xmath6 ) is always found @xcite concave away from the @xmath7 axis instead of convex toward it .",
    "this `` bulge '' exhibits a maximum around optimum doping @xmath8(1 ) , and collapses at @xmath4(2 ) , notably @xmath9 the overdoped regime .",
    "optimum doping may inflate the basal plane area by up to 30% of its overall variation .",
    "we connect the anomalous outward electronic pressure with the @xmath11 principles of the many body state in hole - doped square - planar cuo@xmath12 lattices . on the high energy scale of coulomb ( @xmath13 ) and exchange ( @xmath14 ) interactions",
    "there is little doubt that the non - double - occupancy constraint for holes at the cu@xmath15 sites ( @xmath16 ) is the basic rule that determines the electronic structure .",
    "it is a necessary , however , not a sufficient rule .",
    "here we propose that the characteristic hole concentrations of the bulge , 0.07(2 ) , 0.16(1 ) , and 0.21(2 ) , point to the effect of an additional non - double - occupancy constraint for doped holes in a corner - linked , square cuo@xmath0 lattice .",
    "therein corner linked `` cages '' of 4 oxygens ( squares in fig .",
    "1 ) enclose single cu sites . due to the phase coherence in the symmetric combination of the four o@xmath17 orbitals , holes doped into the cage form extraordinarily stable spin - singlets with the central cu spins .",
    "these `` zhang - rice singlets '' ( zr ) do not allow for an occupancy of their cages with two oxygen holes .",
    "the repulsion between two nonorthogonal zr singlets may be estimated as @xmath18 ev .",
    "@xmath19 ev is the oxygen on - site coulomb repulsion .",
    "the effective repulsion between overlapping zr singlets will create an excluded area extending over the four @xmath20 cages and `` protect '' the spin - singlet in the central cage@xcite .",
    "a scheme for such a `` self - protecting singlet '' ( sps ) is given in fig . 1 ( left ) .",
    "hole doping obeying @xmath21 non - double - occupancy constraints will populate the cuo@xmath0 lattice with sps , instead of overlapping zr or simple rvb singlets .",
    "two neigboring sps may connect each other in a `` site centered '' , or a `` bond centered '' configuration , ( see fig .",
    "1 , middle ) .",
    "the latter has consequences for pairing , since its connecting site ( black dot ) is located at the @xmath22-axis , and is an inversion center for all space and spin coordinates .",
    "two sps connected along the cu  o bonds thus may in principle exchange their oxygen holes , and form a `` paired self - protecting singlet '' ( psps ) .    copper and oxygen hole states in a psps are not dynamically independent from each other : a spin - singlet of the oxygen holes in cages a and b ( fig .",
    "1 , right ) will be strongly correlated with the antiferromagnetic chain of cu spins , acdb , that polarizes the delocalized oxygen hole spins .",
    "in addition a psps is expected to develop a boson - fermion structure .",
    "for example , a spin - singlet of the fermionic oxygen holes in cages a and b will glue together the two bosonic zr singlets , and thus form a strongly anisotropic bosonic pair .",
    "moreover , any attractive exchange interaction between cages a and b has to proceed via two repulsive intermediate triplet excitations , repelling the sites ( a  a ) from ( d  d ) , and ( b  b ) from ( c  c ) .",
    "thus two bosonic zr singlets bound by a singlet of their delocalized fermionic oxygen holes will effectively @xmath23 the psps along the cu  o direction .",
    "doping of the cuo@xmath0 lattice with intact psps and sps is geometrically limited by their closest packings : @xmath24 , and @xmath25 .",
    "overdoping with @xmath26 will start destroying the inversion center of the psps and therewith the condition for pairing . then at @xmath27 the oxygen cages will also start to be destroyed . at @xmath28",
    "all oxygen cages will be broken and zr singlets may not form any longer . consequently @xmath29 at @xmath30 .",
    "it is thus appropriate to connect optimum doping with a many body state of the densest packed psps , and the closure of the ( large ) pseudogap with the destruction of all bosonic zr singlets . as a consequence the electronic structure up to optimum doping is expected to be inhomogenous , in the sense that the charge , spin and lattice dynamics are determined by an intrinsic pairing length of @xmath31 along the cu  o bond directions .",
    "an adiabatic snapshot of the electronic structure taken at @xmath32 would capture a `` tweed - like '' pattern of densest packed psps zig - zagging along the cu  o directions ( fig .",
    "2 , left ) .",
    "how may the two oxygen holes in a psps achieve the necessary overlap for pairing by exchange ?",
    "perfectly rigid square lattices will certainly tend trapping the holes in their oxygen cages .",
    "the lattice dynamics of doped pervoskites is , however , disposed to delocalize holes along the cu  o bonds by a soft bond stretching ( lo ) phonon ( fig .",
    "2 , right ) , favoring hole exchange between two cages . notably the lattice dynamics of the superconducting cuprates seems to distinguish itself from that of other perovskites by an abrupt softening of this bond stretching phonon at a wavevector @xmath34 , signaling the onset of a charge order at @xmath35 k @xcite .",
    "we suggest low temperatures to favor ordering of the charge accumulating along the zig - zagging psps at each third row of the cu grid ( fig .",
    "2 , @xmath36 ) ."
