    "the quantum dynamics of closed many - body quantum systems is relatively unexplored  @xcite and has become the subject of active research only recently with the advent of highly tunable ultracold atomic gases  @xcite . in these systems the almost perfect decoupling from the external environment and the long time",
    "scales allow to study details of the quantum dynamics that are not easily accessible , e.g. , in solid - state systems .",
    "an example of the tunability of ultracold gases is the use of optical lattices  @xcite to freeze the transverse motion and confine the gas in one dimension , a regime where quantum fluctuations play a prominent role  @xcite .",
    "interestingly several 1d hamiltonians relevant to ultracold gases are known to be integrable , _",
    "i.e. _ , they possess an infinite number of local conserved quantities  @xcite .",
    "the implications of integrability on the time evolution of a quantum system is far from being understood as shown in the highly debated quantum newton cradleexperiment of ref .   which promptly followed the realization of a tonks - girardeau gas  @xcite .",
    "in this latter work a 1d gas of bosons interacting via a contact potential ( lieb - liniger model  @xcite ) is separated in two symmetric clouds that subsequently collide in a harmonic trap .",
    "interestingly the clouds bounce off each other several hundred times without noticeable decay of the oscillatory motion . on the other hand , in three dimensions",
    "the dynamics are dramatically different with the clouds merging in a single motionless lump - _ i.e. _ , a thermal state - after few bounces  @xcite .",
    "this sharp difference between the behaviors in one and three dimensions has triggered a vast amount of theoretical work  @xcite aimed at understanding the nature of the asymptotic state ( if any ) reached when the time evolution is dictated by an integrable hamiltonian .",
    "it is fairly clear that integrability manifests itself only in out of equilibrium dynamics whose accurate description requires eigenstates with an energy substantially larger than the ground state energy  @xcite . on the contrary 1d integrable and nonintegrable models",
    "behave alike when the dynamics are restricted to the low energy spectrum , _ i.e. _ in the linear response regime . for instance , a large class of integrable and nonintegrable 1d hamilonians are known to fall in the universality class of the tomonaga - luttinger liquid , an integrable model  @xcite .    as illustrated in ref .  , ultracold gases can be easily driven in different out of equilibrium and nonlinear regimes while a substantial effort is needed to probe only their linear response  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately not many approaches are available to study the out of equilibrium dynamics of interacting quantum systems . only in 1d",
    "the time - dependent density matrix renormalization group ( tdmrg )  @xcite allows the  numerically exact  simulation of the real time dynamics for arbitrary hamiltonians , with the restriction that the entanglement content of the evolving wavefunction is initially not too large and not growing too rapidly in time  @xcite .",
    "alternatively one can discard the fine - grained description of a system , such as the full wavefunction ( or an approximation thereof ) , and focus directly on the collective dynamics of the observables of interests , the particle density being the easier to access in the context of quantum gases .",
    "the collective field approach has been very successful for bose - einstein condensates , called also coherent matter waves  @xcite . at much lower temperatures than the condensation temperature the only relevant degree of freedom of a gas of weakly interacting bosons",
    "is a space - dependent complex order parameter , namely the wavefunction in which a macroscopically large number of particles condense , and interactions can be safely accounted for at the mean - field level  @xcite .",
    "the evolution of the complex order parameter is governed by the celebrated gross - pitaevskii equation  @xcite which has proved to be very effective in providing quantitative predictions for the static , dynamic , and thermodynamic properties of trapped bose gases  @xcite .",
    "the gross - pitaevskii equation is equivalent to the standard euler s equations of fluid dynamics for an inviscid fluid , albeit with an additional quantum pressureterm .",
    "the tomonaga - luttinger theory of 1d many - body systems is sometimes called hydrodynamics  @xcite or harmonic fluidapproach  @xcite since the canonical fields in the hamiltonian are the integrated density @xmath0 and velocity @xmath1 and represent the relevant collective modes at low energies and long wavelength  @xcite . while the gross - pitaevskii s is in essence a classical nonlinear hydrodynamics ,",
    "the tomonaga - luttinger model is a linear  noninteracting  quantum field theory .",
    "nonlinear extensions of the tomonaga - luttinger theory have been discussed in several contexts  @xcite , but throughout this work hydrodynamics descriptionwill stand for a system of nonlinear equations for a classical fluid . incidentally",
    ", this is the same approach used in time - dependent density functional theory ( td - dft )  @xcite in particular in its orbital free formulation  @xcite , where the density is the sole dynamical variable .    for experiments such as the collision between degenerate clouds comprising a large number of interacting atoms",
    "a collective field description is usually the only available option .",
    "various phenomena have been studied in collision experiments , such as the interference of matter waves  @xcite , dispersive shock waves in becs  @xcite , superfluidity , shock wave formation and domain wall propagation in the unitary fermi gas  @xcite , spin transport  @xcite , and lack of thermalization in quasi - integrable 1d systems  @xcite .    with reference to the experimental setup of ref .",
    ", we study the collision of two clouds of one dimensional bosons for arbitrary interaction strength , by means of a time - dependent density matrix renormalization group ( tdmrg ) approach  @xcite based on a matrix product state ( mps ) approximation of the full wavefunction .    a first important result presented here",
    "is that the numerical simulation of the experiment in ref .",
    "for the first few ( @xmath2 ) oscillations is within reach of tdmrg and we provide details on how this has been accomplished .",
    "moreover , if the time evolution is computed accurately , the entanglement is slowly growing in the quenches that we perform , a fact that can possibly allow to reach times much longer than the ones considered in this work . assessing the maximal evolution time allowed by tdmrg",
    "requires a more accurate analysis of the numerical errors which is beyond the scope of the present work .",
    "therefore the important questions of thermalization and of the nature of the asymptotic state is not the focus here .",
    "however we put forward a definition of local temperature that could be useful in this context ( see below ) .    a second result presented here",
    "is the accurate comparison of the exact quantum dynamics with a generalized gross - pitaevskii equation or _ generalized nonlinear schrdinger equation _ ( gnlse )  @xcite which , in hydrodynamic form , contains a pressure term derived from the bethe ansatz solution of the lieb - liniger model .",
    "this is the best available hydrodynamic description for the present problem .",
    "while hydrodynamics works for several oscillations for the breathing mode , in the case of the clouds collision the formation of shock waves leads to a chaotic behavior which is not reflected in the periodic behavior shown by the tdmrg data . only from the latter",
    "the oscillation period as a function of the interaction strength can be accurately extracted and it is found to be different from the breathing period , an easily testable prediction .",
    "this result emphasizes that a better understanding of quantum shock waves is instrumental to a  at least qualitatively  correct hydrodynamic description of 1d quantum gases .",
    "finally , we further characterize the formation of shock waves by studying the wigner distribution function , a tool used by other authors in the context of shock wave dynamics of free fermions  @xcite . starting from the wigner function ,",
    "we show how it is possible to define a _ local energy distribution function _ and that at the onset of shock waves formation the latter shows _ population inversion _ , _ i.e. _ higher energy states are more occupied than lower energy ones .",
    "recently  @xcite a _ negative temperature _ , namely a population inversion in the energy distribution of the motional degrees of freedom of atomic gases has been realized .",
    "moreover , it was shown in ref .",
    "that population inversion does not necessarily imply a fast decay to the true thermal equilibrium state , thus showing the quite unique properties these systems possess .",
    "we suggest that the small thermalization rate and absence of visible decay of the oscillatory motion in the density profiles observed both in ref .   and in our simulations are a dynamical manifestation of the same remarkable ( meta-)stability of the negative temperature state realized in ref .  .",
    "in fact , we employ a possible definition of local temperature out of equilibrium  put forward in ref .    and find again negative values in correspondence of the shock wave formation time .",

    "we consider two kinds of quench . in the first one the external potential is an harmonic well with a sudden change in frequency at @xmath8 @xmath14 this excites the _ breathing mode _ of a gas initially in the ground state . in a second kind of quench",
    "we prepare the gas in the ground state of the potential @xmath15 in order to have two clouds of particles separated by a distance @xmath16 , and we let it evolve for @xmath17 in the harmonic potential  ( [ eq : post_pot ] ) with @xmath18 ( _ microcanonical picture of transport _",

    "tdmrg has been applied mainly to lattice systems for relatively short time scales  @xcite , but simulations of systems in the continuum limit and for quite long time scales ( of the order of several periods ) are feasible  @xcite .",
    "details are provided in appendix  [ appendix : tdmrg ] .",
    "in essence we use a wavefunction in mps form that explicitly conserves the number of particles and is evolved in time using a sixth order trotter expansion @xcite . moreover the sizes of the mps matrices are allowed to change dynamically both in space and in time by fixing the discarded weight [ see app .",
    "[ appendix : tdmrg ] ] . in our simulations",
    "we have employed two different discretizations   of  ( [ eq : ll ] )  @xcite , either as a bose - hubbard model ( nonintegrable ) , or as a xxz spin chain ( integrable ) using the bose - fermi mapping for arbitrary interaction strength @xmath9",
    "the lattice hamiltonians are given in appendix  [ appendix : discretization ] .",
    "no substantial difference in the results has been observed .",
    "importantly we find that , for an accurate time evolution of the mps , the entanglement entropy is bounded or very slowly increasing  @xcite which translates in a manageable size of the mps .",
    "thus , in principle , longer times could be explored but we show only results for the first few half periods @xmath21 .    in the following , lengths are expressed in units of the lattice spacing @xmath22 of the discretized model , which is a small , but otherwise arbitrary length scale , energy is in units of @xmath23 , and time in units of the post - quench oscillation half period @xmath21 .",

    "we ensured , by separately tuning @xmath19 and @xmath20 for each value of the coupling @xmath9 [ see table  [ tb : frequencies ] ] , that the particle density _ per site _ never exceeds @xmath27 , thus lattice effects are negligible ( continuum limit )  @xcite .",

    "the clouds distance is fixed at @xmath30 [ see  ( [ eq : init_pot ] ) ] . with this choice of distance the two clouds are always partially overlapping while simulations for well separated clouds are more numerically demanding .    in the actual experiment",
    "@xcite the number of particles varies between @xmath31 and @xmath32 , figures not far from the one used in our simulations .",
    "moreover we will see that the dynamics can be well described in the local density approximation , namely using the local pressure calculated in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "thus our results are significant for much larger system sizes , a fact that we explicitly verified in the case of free fermions where a scaling in the number of particles can be easily performed .",

    "interestingly , while shock waves greatly affect the gnlse dynamics by triggering an aperiodic and chaotic behaviour , this does not occur in the full quantum dynamics where the system is found to return to the initial state after ( approximately ) half of the harmonic trap period , as in the case of the breathing period .",
    "we observe essentially no decay within the time scales that we have been able to explore ( @xmath119 ) , an indication of the extremely small dissipation in the system .",
    "this suggest that the shock structure is controlled by a dispersive term which is however rather different from the quantum pressure in eq .",
    "( [ eq : mom ] ) , since it leads to a qualitatively different dynamics and to an oscillatory structure different from the usual one  @xcite .",
    "we provide results for the oscillation period as a function of the interaction strength in the case of the collision of clouds , a nonperturbative result that , to our knowledge , can be obtained with no method other than tdmrg .",
    "the experiment in ref .",
    "is important for the problem of thermalization , namely what is the appropriate statistical ensemble that can describe the state asymptotically reached by an integrable system .",
    "although this is not our main focus here , we point out that tdmrg could be useful in the future for this purpose since in the kind of quench that we study the entanglement has very little or no growth , which implies that the computational cost grows linearly with the maximum time reached in a simulation [ see ref .",
    "@xcite and app .",
    "[ appendix : tdmrg ] ] . in the present case",
    "we study only the first few oscillations .",
    "notice , however , that in a three - dimensional collision of two bose - einstein condensates the thermalization scale is @xmath120  @xcite , well within reach of our method .",
    "importantly , we observed that the dynamics for finite interaction strength @xmath9 is continuously connected  @xcite to the tonks - girardeu case ( free fermions , @xmath13 ) for which the dynamics in a harmonic trap is stricly periodic , _",
    "i.e. _ there is _ no decay _ towards a stationary asymptotic state .",
    "understanding if this is the case also for arbitrary finite interactions is an important question , and in the future it may be possible to provide some lower bounds on the decay rate using tdmrg .",
    "the results presented here are also relevant to the broad problem of understanding the hydrodynamics of quantum gases , namely to provide an effective description using as dynamical variables only the observables of interest , such as density and velocity fields  @xcite .",
    "such a description can be of great value since it is computationally more affordable than full quantum simulations such as those provided by tdmrg .",
    "this is the same point of view adopted by td - dft in its orbital free formulation  @xcite .",
    "in fact the runge - gross theorem  @xcite of td - dft guarantees that an exact hydrodynamic description of quantum dynamics exists  @xcite , although the analytical expression of the stress tensor is unknown even for free fermions  @xcite .",
    "the use of dmrg to study density functional theory in an exact setting , has been put forward in ref .   in the context of ground - state calculations . here",
    ", we have approached the dynamical problem for one of the simplest many - body systems in the same fashion .",
    "we emphasise that a better understanding of shock waves even in the tonks - girardeau limit is an important step towards the goal of a better hydrodynamic description of ultracold gases .",
    "finally , we have shown that quantum shock waves lead to a population inversion in the local energy distribution , namely to a negative effective temperature , a result confirmed by a possible definition of temperature out of equilibrium put forward in ref .  .",
    "our results suggest that statistical ensembles with negative temperatures for the motional degrees of freedom , as shown in ref .  , are a common feature in collision experiments with ultracold gases  @xcite .    this work has been supported by doe under grant no .",

    "the numerical results presented in this work have been obtained by using an implementation of the tdmrg code with matrix product states , developed by the team coordinated by davide rossini at the scuola normale superiore , pisa ( italy ) .",
    "in the tdmrg simulations a matrix product state ( mps ) representation  @xcite of the wavefunction has been employed @xmath121}\\cdot \\bm{a}^{[n_2]}\\cdot \\ldots\\cdot \\bm{a}^{[n_{l-1}]}\\cdot \\bm{a}^{[n_l]}\\,,\\ ] ] with @xmath122 a given set of occupancies of the lattice with length @xmath123 .",

    "the link dimension is position dependent and it is the crucial parameter that needs to be tuned to find a balance between accuracy and speed  @xcite . for open boundary conditions @xmath130 . the dot @xmath131denotes the matrix multiplication .",
    "a standard trick for increasing the speed of tdrmg is the use of the conservation of the number of particles ( @xmath132 ) .",
    "this leads to a block structure for the matrices @xmath124}$ ] .",
    "it can be easily checked that large blocks of @xmath124}$ ] are zero and the size of the mps is greatly reduced .    during the time evolution",
    "the link dimension @xmath127 is kept to a low value by performing a singular value decomposition  @xcite ( svd ) of a two - site matrix @xmath133}_{\\ell_{i-1}\\ell_{i+1 } } = \\sum_{\\ell_i}\\bm{a}^{[n_i]}_{\\ell_{i-1}\\ell_i}\\bm{a}^{[n_{i+1}]}_{\\ell_i\\ell_{i+1}}$ ] and discarding the lowest singular values compatibly with the condition @xmath134 where @xmath135 are the singular values obtained by svd and @xmath136 is the _ discarded weight _ , a small parameter that controls the precision .",
    "note that according to this truncation procedure the link dimension @xmath127 adapts automatically in space and time to the evolving wavefunction of an inhomogeneous and out of equilibrium system .",
    "the block structure carries over to @xmath133}_{\\ell_{i-1}\\ell_{i+1}}$ ] and the svd can be performed blockwise with considerable speed - up  @xcite .",
    "a mps with a block structure imposed by the conservation of the number of particles and the truncation prescription described above are the two ingredients that enable to simulate reliably the quench protocol presented in the main text for long enough times to observe several collisions of the clouds .",
    "the same techniques have been employed successfully for the fermi - hubbard model in ref .   and for the bose - hubbard model with two species in ref .  .",
    "additional details on the structure imposed on the mps by particle number conservation can be found in ref .  .",
    "in our simulations we used a discarded weight @xmath137 and we employed a sixth order trotter expansion for the time evolution  @xcite with time step @xmath138 for the bh discretization and @xmath139 for the xxz discretization .",
    "the reason for using a sixth order expansion has been discussed in ref .  .",
    "the reliability of our simulations has been controlled in several ways .",
    "first , we checked our results against exactly solvable cases , namely free bosons and free fermions ( hard - core limit @xmath43 ) verifying that the exact diagonalization results are indistinguishable from the tdmrg ones over several oscillation half periods @xmath21 , the scale of one collision .",
    "second , the discarded weight has been lowered to @xmath140 without observing significant differences in the evolved density profile @xmath141 .",
    "finally the comparison between hydrodynamic and tdmrg data in the case of the breathing mode quench [ see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] and  [ fig2 ] ] is by itself an unbiased check , for any value of the interaction strength , of the accuracy of our simulations over several oscillation periods .    in the supplementary online materials",
    "@xcite we provide animations of the density profiles obtained both with tdmrg and gnlse , alongside the corresponding link dimension @xmath127 and block entropy @xmath142",
    "@xcite illustrating the important point that in our tdmrg simulation the entanglement growth is not so dramatic , which allows in principle to reach longer times than those presented here .",
    "the lieb - liniger model has been discretized in two distinct ways :    * * bose - hubbard discretization *  @xcite [ eq : bose - hubbard ] + _ bose - hubbard = & -j_i ( b^_ib_i+1 + h.c . ) + & + _ i n^2_i + _ iv_in_i , + with @xmath143 bosonic annihilation and creation operators on the @xmath128-th site and @xmath144 the corresponding on - site density operator .",

    "<S> using time - dependent density matrix renormalization group ( tdmrg ) we study the collision of one - dimensional atomic clouds confined in a harmonic trap and evolving with the lieb - liniger hamiltonian . </S>",
    "<S> it is observed that the motion is essentially periodic with the clouds bouncing elastically , at least on the time scale of the first few oscillations that can be resolved with high accuracy . </S>",
    "<S> this is in agreement with the results of the quantum newton cradleexperiment of kinoshita _ et al . _ </S>",
    "<S> [ nature * 440 * , 900 ( 2006 ) ] . </S>",
    "<S> we compare the results for the density profile against a hydrodynamic description , or generalized nonlinear schrdinger equation , with the pressure term taken from the bethe ansatz solution of the lieb - liniger model . </S>",
    "<S> we find that hydrodynamics can describe the breathing mode of a harmonically trapped cloud for arbitrary long times while it breaks down almost immediately for the collision of two clouds due to the formation of shock waves ( gradient catastrophe ) . in the case of the clouds collision tdmrg alone allows to extract the oscillation period which is found to be measurably different from the breathing mode period . </S>",
    "<S> concomitantly with the shock waves formation we observe a local energy distribution typical of population inversion , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ , an effective negative temperature . </S>",
    "<S> our results are an important step towards understanding the hydrodynamics of quantum many - body systems out of equilibrium and the role of integrability in their dynamics . </S>"
