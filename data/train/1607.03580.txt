    ", it has been shown previously that energies evaluated at the level of a single pair of particle - hole excitations are already quite accurate  @xcite .",

    "the formal similarity ensures that a similar hierarchy of the particle - hole excitations as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite also exists in our system . for example , when the dependence of @xmath143 and @xmath144 in @xmath145 is neglected , the equations are decoupled from contributions from higher - order particle - hole excitations .",

    "@xcite , for the case of a spin - orbit coupled fermi gas as well , an expansion in the hole wave vector @xmath143 represents the successive inclusion of contributions from the subspace of multiple particle - hole excitations .",
    "now , the crucial question is whether the energy of the polaron also converges quickly under soc , when contributions from higher - order particle - hole excitations are successively included .      following the arguments in ref .",
    "@xcite , we caculate the polaron energies with a single pair of particle - hole excitations , and with two pairs of excitations . for polarons with two pairs of particle - hole excitations ,",
    "we consider the following three cases : ( 1 ) @xmath150 in @xmath145 ; ( 2 ) @xmath151 in @xmath145 ; and ( 3 ) @xmath143 and @xmath144 in @xmath145 can take arbitrary values below the fermi sea . note that throughout our work , the fermi surface lies in the lower helicity branch , which implies @xmath152 always . as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , these three cases represent a successive inclusion of corrections with two pairs of particle - hole excitations . as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : supp2 ] , the polaron energy quickly converges as the approximation improves .",
    "this confirms that the chevy - type ansatz wave functions should be applicable in our system . due to the formal similarities of the underlying equations ,",

    "<S> . these are due to the ring - topology of the fermi sea , and consequently , the existence of two fermi momenta  @xcite . finally , while similar in the overall profile as the polaron spectra , the trimer spectra have less pronounced peaks and richer fine structures . </S>",
    "<S> these distinctive signatures should allow us to differentiate the impurity states in cold - atoms experiments .    _ </S>",
    "<S> summary_. our results demonstrate the robustness of soc - induced universal trimers in the many - body setting , and reveals the crucial role of particle - hole fluctuations in stabilizing these trimers . </S>",
    "<S> the existence of stable universal trimers in a many - body system opens up new avenues for the study of few to many crossover physics in mesoscopic cold - atoms systems . </S>",
    "<S> we hope our work can stimulate more explorations of intriguing many - body phases with novel few - body correlations .    _ </S>",
