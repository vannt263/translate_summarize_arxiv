    "a number of scenarios have been put forth for explaining why the amounts of dark matter and ordinary matter are relatively close to each other , within one order of magnitude .",
    "one of the popular approaches is to consider dark matter with a conserved particle number and a particle - antiparticle asymmetry related to matter - antimatter asymmetry  @xcite .",
    "( for a recent review , see , e.g. , ref .",
    "such asymmetric dark matter does not annihilate at present , and , as long as it is stable , no indirect detection signals are expected in gamma rays or neutrinos . at the same time , some inconsistencies between numerical simulations of cold dark matter ( cdm ) and the observations hint at the possibility of self - interacting dark matter  @xcite .",
    "indeed , interactions of dark - matter particles can facilitate the momentum transfer and angular momentum transfer in halos , hence creating cored rather than cuspy density profiles in both dwarf spheroidal galaxies and in larger halos .",
    "there is a variety of particle - physics candidates for self - interacting dark matter , which include , e.g. , hidden - sector particles with gauge  @xcite , or yukawa interactions  @xcite , as well as non - topological solitons with a large enough geometrical size  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we will show that , if dark matter is both asymmetric and self - interacting , then its detection in gamma rays is possible .",
    "although asymmetric dark matter particles do not annihilate , their interactions can result in emission of quanta of the field that mediates the self - interaction .",
    "we will investigate several methods of producing these quanta and decay paths ; on the production side , we particularly consider emissions occuring in elastic scattering ( as bremsstrahlung ) , or in the events of two interacting particles forming a bound state .",
    "the latter is plausible because a number of models have employed attractive self - interaction , such as , for example yukawa fields .    to illustrate the possibilities of indirect detection",
    ", we will consider a fairly generic model of scalar dark matter @xmath0 interacting by means of exchange of some lighter scalar field @xmath1 , both of which are singlets of the standard model gauge group .",
    "the mediator field @xmath1 can have a nonzero mixing with the higgs boson , and , therefore the @xmath1 boson can decay into photons and other standard model particles , even if its coupling to standard model particles are otherwise highly suppressed .",
    "this decay ultimately produces the signal detectable by gamma - ray telescopes .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : model ] , we discuss the relevant features of the particle physics model under consideration . in section  [ sec :",
    "dm_bound_states ] , we consider the bound states formation and the prospects of indirect detection of dark matter forming bound states .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : bremsstrahlung ] , we discuss possible signals from bremmstrahlung of self - interacting dark matter .",
    "we begin this section by introducing the minimal particle physics model that we will use . following this ,",
    "we discuss properties of the dark matter halo within the milky way .",
    "we then discuss the relevant constraints on the parameters present in the model in general , although detailed discussion of the implementation of these constraints is contained in later sections where the signal from bremsstrahlung and bound state formation is explicitly calculated .",
    "then finally we discuss the decays of the dark force mediator .",
    "we begin with a specific model of the relevant particle physics .",
    "we supplement the standard model with a complex scalar @xmath2 singlet @xmath0 ; we also introduce a global @xmath3 symmetry under which @xmath4 without a loss of generality we may assume @xmath0 particles carry unit @xmath3 charge . due to charge conservation , the @xmath0 particles are completely stable .",
    "we will assume that dark matter is composed of the @xmath0 particles , and the correct abundance is generated in some process similar to or combined with baryogenesis .",
    "we do not assume that dark matter is necessarily a thermal relic . to make this dark matter self - interacting , we introduce an additional scalar field @xmath1 which is a singlet under all the gauge symmetries , as well as @xmath3 .",
    "the most general potential , after the standard model gauge symmetry is spontaneously broken , is    @xmath5    the higgs field @xmath6 and the @xmath1 field carry identical quantum numbers and therefore mix .",
    "the true mass eigenvalues are @xmath7 and the eigenstates are @xmath8 where the mixing angle is",
    "@xmath9 we will require that the mixing between the higgs field and the @xmath1 field be small ; this can be accomplished by setting the free parameter @xmath10 appropriately .",
    "then we may speak of the @xmath1 fields and higgs fields as approximate mass eigenstates with masses @xmath11 and @xmath12 respectively ; this allows the mass @xmath12 to be small even though no light scalar boson has been observed .",
    "we assume that any interactions between the dark sector particles ( @xmath0 , @xmath13 , and @xmath1 ) and the particles of the standard model are highly suppressed .",
    "finally , we note that the relevant unitless coupling to describe the yukawa interaction between the @xmath0 and @xmath1 particles is @xmath14 .",
    "this can be established in two ways . regarding bound states , it is well - known that the bethe - salpeter equation reproduces the ground state energy of the hydrogen atom",
    ". therefore , one may determine @xmath15 by setting the binding energy of the lowest bound state , @xmath16 , equal to @xmath17 , which includes the correction for identical particles .",
    "secondly , one may consider the non - relativistic limit of two particle scattering .",
    "we recall that quantum - field - theoretic wavefunctions include a normalization factor of @xmath18 for each @xmath0 particle .",
    "therefore , the relevant prefactor before the overlap integral for one particle exchange is @xmath19 , which again gives @xmath14 .",
    "if one instead defines @xmath20 , as in @xcite for example , then additional factors of 4 must be introduced in other equations , e.g. , the bound state mass .",
    "let us now discuss the assumptions that we will make regarding the properties of dark matter in the milky way halo .",
    "first , we assume that the correct abundance of @xmath0 particles is determined by some process that is similar to baryogenesis or related to baryogenesis , as in models reviewed in ref .",
    "the absence of antiparticles in today s universe eliminates the possibility of a signal from @xmath21 annihilation .",
    "we use the navarro - frenk - white profile @xcite to approximate the spatial mass distribution of dark matter , @xmath22 we do not expect this profile to be accurate near the center of the galaxy ; indeed , one of the motivations of self - interacting dark matter is to remove the cusp present at @xmath23 in the nfw profile .",
    "therefore , we will cut off our intergrals at scales of 1 kpc .",
    "we emphasize that our results are not dependent on the sharp cusp present in the nfw profile .",
    "the parameters @xmath24 and @xmath25 are related to the virial mass , virial radius , and concentration by @xmath26 for the milky way , we use the parameters @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "this gives @xmath30 and @xmath31 .    in calculating the cross sections for bremsstrahlung emission of @xmath1 particles and bound state formation",
    ", we will need to average over the relative velocities of the particles .",
    "therefore , we need the velocity distribution @xmath32 as a function of the distance from the center of the galaxy .",
    "if the dark matter has virialized , then its average circular velocity should decrease near the galactic center , except for a small region near the supermassive black hole .",
    "however , the dark matter radial velocity profile and dispersion are currently unknown .    because of these uncertainties , we will instead use a maxwellian distribution with the effective temperature @xmath33 chosen such that the average velocity is @xmath34 .",
    "we note that simulations support the assumption of a locally gaussian velocity distribution even for cold dark matter @xcite , and the isothermal approximation is better for self - interacting dark matter @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the velocity distribution for two non - relativistic @xmath0 particles is @xmath35 in terms of the total velocity @xmath36 and the relative velocity @xmath37 , the distribution is @xmath38 we integrate over the total velocity to find the relative velocity distribution ( in a reference frame at rest with respect to the milky way ) .",
    "@xmath39 because the @xmath0 particles are moving non - relativistically , this distribution also applies to their center of momentum frame .",
    "we observe that this is peaked at slightly larger velocities than the velocity distribution of a single particle .",
    "thus far , we have introduced a model which provides a viable dark matter candidate .",
    "we introduced several parameters in the lagrangian describing our model ( e.g. , the self - interaction coupling ) .",
    "these parameters can not be set arbitrarily ; there are numerous constraints they must satisfy , from both astrophysics and particle physics . in this subsection",
    ", we will give only a general discussion of these constraints ; the specifics of how the constraints are implemented will be discussed when particular values for the coupling constants are chosen , which will be done seperately for bremsstrahlung emission and bound state formation .",
    "since we aim to demonstrate that this model produces an observable indirect detection signal , we demand that it satisfy all experimental constraints except those from indirect detection experiments .",
    "first , we require that this model make only insignificant modifications to the branching ratio for the decays of the higgs boson .",
    "we forbid the decay @xmath40 by requiring @xmath41  gev , using the recent higgs mass measurements @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the decay @xmath42 can be arbitrarily suppressed by taking @xmath43 to be sufficiently small ; this parameter is not used elsewhere in our analysis .",
    "we also demand that the mixing angle @xmath44 be small enough that the apparant branching ratio for @xmath45 is less than the branching ratio for the @xmath46 decay .",
    "there are many well - known bounds on the self - interaction cross section of dark matter .",
    "as explained in  @xcite , these constraints more appropriately restrict @xmath47 , the momentum transfer cross section .",
    "( for identical particles , the closely - related viscosity cross section should be used instead  @xcite . in the limit @xmath48 , which will be valid for our parameters , these differ by @xmath49  @xcite and so we will ignore this complication . ) the bullet cluster bound requires @xmath50",
    "@xcite , and bounds from the evaporation of galactic halos favor @xmath51  @xcite .",
    "these bounds appear to be in conflict with the prefered range to eliminate cuspy profiles , @xmath52  @xcite .",
    "however , because these bounds affect vastly different scales , they may be resolved by considering a velocity dependent into the cross section , as naturally arises in the yukawa exchange of a light boson  @xcite ,  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , such a cross section may additionally solve the  too big to fail \" problem  @xcite .",
    "for an attractive yukawa potential , as we have introduced above , the bounds are consistent for yukawa interactions provided that the masses @xmath53 and @xmath12 satisfy particular relations given in  @xcite,@xcite .",
    "the precise constraint is a function of @xmath54 , the velocity at which @xmath55 peaks at a transfer cross section equal to @xmath56 .",
    "additional bounds on the self - interaction cross section arise from observations of halo ellipticity , as introduced in  @xcite , although these bounds are quite model - dependent .",
    "yukawa couplings are discussed in @xcite , which uses the observed elliptical shape of the dark matter halo of galaxy ngc 720 .",
    "if the self - interaction between the @xmath0 particles is too strong , the energy transfer from these collisions makes the halo spherical instead of elliptical .",
    "reference @xcite presented analyses for masses up to 4 tev ; however , we will consider masses above this . furthermore ,",
    "as has been noted by @xcite , these bounds may in fact be somewhat weaker due corrections from the triaxial distribution of dark matter outside of the core ; however , as they note , more detailed simulations are required to firmly establish this conclusion .",
    "we discuss these issues in more detail in appendix [ ap : halo_extension ] , in which we extend the halo ellipticity bounds to the relevant mass range .",
    "direct detection experiments such as xenon100 @xcite and cdms @xcite have set an upper bound on the cross section for the interaction between @xmath0 particles and nucleons ; because this interaction occurs through the exchange of a higgs boson , this constrains @xmath57 .",
    "the stability of neutron stars generally imposes stronger constraints on @xmath57 @xcite but these constraints do not apply to scalar dark matter with masses at the tev scale or above  @xcite .",
    "we will not use @xmath57 in our analysis ; therefore , it can be set arbitrarily small .",
    "these constraints can also constrain the quartic interaction between self - interacting dark matter @xcite ; we may also set this aritrarily small because it will not be used in our analysis .",
    "we note that while we can arbitrarily suppress the @xmath0-nucleon interaction which occurs through the exchange of a higgs boson , there is an additional diagram in which the @xmath0 boson emits a @xmath1 boson , which turns into a higgs boson via mixing , which is then absorbed by the nucleon .",
    "although we are not free to arbitrarily suppress this diagram , as one might expect , this cross section is beneath current direct detection limits ; we discuss it in more detail in appendix [ ap : s - nucleon_cross_section ] .      from the constraints discussed above",
    ", we have seen that the mass @xmath12 must be relatively small . however , these dark force mediator particles are not necessary stable , and their decays can potentially produce detectable signals . later in the paper",
    "we will discuss how these @xmath1 bosons are produced ( for example , though bound state formation or bremsstrahlung ) ; in this section , we will simply discuss their decays irrespective of their production .",
    "due to the nonzero @xmath1-higgs mixing , a @xmath1 particle has the same decay modes as the higgs boson , provided that they are kinematically allowed .",
    "the amplitudes are suppressed by the @xmath1-higgs mixing parameters .",
    "since the mass @xmath12 must be small , we consider the decays @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "for @xmath60 a few mev , the dominant decay is @xmath59 . the decay rate in the rest frame of the @xmath1 boson is @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the weak coupling constant .",
    "if @xmath63 , the decay @xmath59 is kinematically forbidden , and instead the dominant decay is @xmath58 . in the @xmath1 particle s rest frame , the decay rate is @xmath64 in this equation , @xmath65 , @xmath62 is again the weak coupling constant , @xmath66 is the number of color states of the particle in the loop , and @xmath67 is this particle s electric charge .",
    "the dominant contributions to the loop will be from electrons , up quarks , and down quarks , for which @xmath68 where @xmath69 , and @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "we note that in a reference frame in which the @xmath1 particle is moving with speed @xmath72 , its gamma factor is @xmath73 and its lifetime is @xmath74    for the product of decay to be observed , the particles must decay in flight before they travel the distance @xmath75  kpc separating earth from the galactic center . for our choice of parameters ,",
    "the mean distance travelled in the milky way s rest frame before decaying is significantly shorter than this distance .",
    "we also note that we do not need to take into account scattering when calculating decays of @xmath1 bosons because the collisions are rare ( see appendix  [ ap : mean_free_path ] ) .",
    "to determine the signal produced by our model , we also need to know the width of the energy distribution of the decay products .",
    "the above decays are two body decays ; therefore , in the rest frame of the @xmath1 particle the energy spectrum of the decay products is a sharp line at @xmath76 .",
    "this energy spectrum must be boosted into the milky way reference frame , in which the @xmath1 particles are moving with speed @xmath77 . because the @xmath1 boson is spinless , the energy distribution is flat .    for decays to an",
    "electron and positron , the energy distribution is @xmath78 for @xmath79 between the values of @xmath80    similarly , for decays to two photons , the energy distribution is @xmath81 for @xmath79 between the values of @xmath82",
    "it has previously been observed that many models of self - interacting dark matter , including supersymmetric models , permit the existence of dark matter bound states  @xcite .",
    "the same reference notes that the decay of emitted force carrier particles could , in theory , produce a signal for indirect detection experiments .",
    "therefore , we will begin by explicitly calculating the produced signal for the above asymmetric scalar dark matter model .",
    "we will establish that it is indeed possible to produce a signal above current observational bounds , establishing the possibility of indirect detection of asymmetric self - interacting dark matter .",
    "however , we will further show that the limit @xmath83 , as taken in @xcite , does not produce a detectable signal .",
    "we begin by discussing in more detail the constraints that our parameters must satisfy . to facilitate the formation of bound states ,",
    "we desire a large coupling @xmath84 ; we will choose @xmath85 .",
    "although calculations in the strongly - interacting regime are notorously difficult , the astrophysical bounds determined in @xcite and @xcite may be extrapolated to these regimes ; in both references , the transfer cross section used includes corrections for the strongly - interacting regime , as the authors note",
    ". we will also consider @xmath86 and show that this is not sufficient to produce an observable signal .",
    "first , we ensure that our parameters are consistent with ellpitical halos ; as discussed in  @xcite , the restriction on @xmath15 becomes weaker as @xmath12 is increased . in appendix",
    "[ ap : halo_extension ] , we have determined the minimum @xmath12 for which we may consistently choose @xmath87 as a function of @xmath53 .",
    "we choose @xmath88 , which requires that we choose @xmath89 ; we will take @xmath90 .",
    "similarly , for @xmath88 and @xmath86 , we must satisfy @xmath91 ; we choose @xmath92 .",
    "we must also ensure that our parameters are consistent with the astrophysical data .",
    "the velocity for which @xmath93 is @xmath94 ; this is @xmath95 and @xmath96 respectively for the two sets of parameters above . to be consistent with astrophysical data",
    ", we then must have @xmath97  @xcite ; the above numbers correspond to @xmath98 and @xmath99 .    in order to produce a bound state ,",
    "a real @xmath1 particle must be emitted ; therefore , we must also have @xmath100 , where the binding energy @xmath101 .",
    "for the first set of parameters chosen , the binding energy is @xmath102 , and for the second set of parameters , @xmath103 . for both , @xmath100 .",
    "the rate of formation of bound states , neglecting charge depletion , is given by @xmath104 where @xmath105 is the number density of @xmath0 particles and @xmath106 is the cross secton for bound state formation .",
    "because the @xmath0 particles do not escape to infinity , this can not be approximated using the born approximation . in appendix",
    "[ ap : bs_cross_section ] we present a calculation of this cross section as a function of the relative momentum @xmath107 where @xmath108 is the reduced mass of the system .",
    "( this cross section is calculated by adapting the derivation for positronium formation given in @xcite to the case for the exchange of a spinless boson . )",
    "the distribution of relative momentum of the incoming particles can be found from equation and is given by equation . averaging the above equation over the relative momentum",
    "gives @xmath109    the first set of parameters discussed above corresponds to a cross section of @xmath110 , which gives the rate @xmath111 . in one year , @xmath112 bound states are formed , which means that during the lifetime of the milky way , @xmath113 would have formed .",
    "this is indeed negligible in comparison to the total number of @xmath0 particles between 1 kpc and 8 kpc , which is @xmath114 .",
    "this justifies our neglect of charge depletion .",
    "if we decrease @xmath15 to 1 , then the cross section drops by two orders of magnitude , to @xmath115 .",
    "the rate is also two orders of magnitude smaller , @xmath116 .",
    "again , we may neglect charge depletion .",
    "the @xmath0 particles do not interact electromagnetically .",
    "therefore , when a bound state is formed , the excess energy is carried off by a light @xmath1 particle .",
    "although the binding energy is large enough that a higgs boson could be emitted instead , the @xmath1 particle dominates because it is lighter and has a stronger coupling to the @xmath0 particles . due to",
    "the nonzero @xmath1-higgs mixing , this @xmath1 particle has a non - zero probability to transform into a higgs boson which then decays .",
    "given our choices for @xmath12 , the dominant decay is @xmath117 .    in the rest frame of the milky way",
    ", the @xmath1 particles will have a typical energy equal to the binding energy ; the additional energy the @xmath1 particle may carry from the kinetic energy of the non - relativistic @xmath0 particles is negligible .",
    "using equation , we find that the lifetime of the @xmath1 boson , in the milky way s rest frame , is @xmath118 , or @xmath119 , for the first set of parameters .",
    "the distance that they travel before decaying is @xmath120 , which is significantly less than both the distance from the galactic center to the solar system and the mean free path calculated in appendix [ ap : mean_free_path ] . for the second set of parameters ,",
    "the lifetime is @xmath121 .    as explained in section [ sec : sigma_decay ] , the resulting electrons and positrons have a flat energy distribution ; their spectrum is @xmath122 these electrons and photons have typical energies on or just below the tev scale ; they lose energy through synchrotron radiation and inverse compton scattering rapidly , within about 1 kpc @xcite .",
    "therefore , few of these particles will be observed near earth .",
    "there are three sources of background photons : the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation , starlight , and the starlight reprocessed by dust ( including the extragalactic background light , which is the starlight re - emitted by dust outside milky way ) . outside the central molecular zone , the cosmic microwave background radiation dominates the photon number density  @xcite .",
    "if the cross section exhibited a rapid growth with energy , the higher - energy optical photons could have played a role , but this is not the case for the ic cross section . for the signal from distances between 1  kpc and 8  kpc from the galactic center , one may safely neglect scattering from photons other than cmb photons .",
    "due to the smallness of the ic mean free path , other propagation effects are not significant .    in appendix",
    "[ ap : cmbscattering ] , we calculate the final energy distribution for a scattering photon using the klein - nishina cross section ; we then average over the appropriate energy distribution for the electrons and positrons produced by dark force mediator decays .",
    "the rate of the production of these photons is the rate of production of the high energy fermions themselves .",
    "the end result of this calculation is described by equation , which gives the number of photons produced by this process per unit energy per unit time ; from this , we can find the flux of gamma rays at the solar system .",
    "the production of dark force mediator particles results in an isotropic flux of these particles about the galactic center ; similarly , we expect the flux of their decay products and the scattered photons to be isotropic about the galactic center .",
    "therefore , the photon flux per unit area is well - approximated by an equivalent point source at the galactic center .",
    "we can find the average flux per unit area , per unit solid angle by further dividing by @xmath123 , since the signal will appear to come from the hemisphere centered on the galactic center .",
    "we note that this is an average ; as a function of solid angle , we expect the signal to be greater near the galactic center and less further away from it .",
    "we also note that this is only an approximation to the true diffuse flux , meant to demonstrate that a detectable signal is possible .",
    "( as discussed above , we neglect the contribution from the galactic center itself and include only the contributions from decays outside the inner kiloparsec . )",
    "if such a signal were to be observed , more careful analysis should be done before attempting to fit this scenario to the data .",
    "furthermore , we note that the production of the dark force mediator bosons @xmath1 scales as the density squared ; this increases as one approaches the galactic center .",
    "since the sigma bosons only travel @xmath124  m before decaying into the fermions which scatter the cmb photons , the signal is dominated by the innermost region we consider .",
    "since we have cutoff our calculation at an inner radius of 1 kpc to avoid the known cusp in the nfw profile , the signal comes predominantly from the region near this cut .",
    "therefore , the point source approximation is better than one may naively expect .",
    "( we remind our reader that due to this cutoff , this calculation produces an approximate lower bound on the signal strength . )",
    "we find that the average flux over the hemisphere centered on the galactic center , neglecting the galactic center itself , is @xmath125    to compare with the the sensitivity of the fermi - lat gamma ray telescope , we evaluate @xmath126 ; this function is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : signal ] .",
    "the signal for @xmath86 is peaked at a lower energy and falls off more sharply , as we would expect because the binding energy is smaller .",
    "we see that @xmath87 produces a signal that is one order of magnitude larger than the values measured by fermi - lat , but the signal produced by @xmath86 is two orders of magnitude too small . therefore , we conclude that sufficiently large couplings may produce a detectable signal .",
    "this suggests that wimponium models  @xcite , which assume @xmath83 , will not produce a detectable signal through bound state formation .",
    ", as shown in the legend , and for @xmath88 , @xmath90 for @xmath87 , @xmath92 for @xmath86 .",
    "for comparison , the data from fermi lat space telescope are also shown  @xcite . ]",
    "one can also show that the resulting signal is rather insensitive to the precise value of @xmath12 , provided that @xmath117 remains the dominant decay .",
    "however , this parameter is highly constrained by the astrophysical bounds discussed in section [ sec : constraints ] .",
    "finally , we also note that this signal depends relatively weakly on the cutoff we imposed to avoid the center cusp of the nfw profile .",
    "if we cut off the integral at 1 pc instead of 1 kpc , the signal would only be about 20 percent greater , although the point source approximation would be more accurate .",
    "we will briefly discuss the possibility of producing a detectable positron or electron signal within this model .",
    "this is a particularly interesting question because of the positron excess observed by pamela  @xcite , which was confirmed by fermi - lat  @xcite and more recently ams - ii  @xcite . in order to travel from the galactic center to the solar system relatively unimpeded , the fermions would need to be lower energy that those discussed above , which lost significant energy due to inverse compton scattering .",
    "energy loss due to inverse compton scattering is somewhat suppressed for energies on the gev scale ; therefore , we will briefly discuss the difficulties of producing electrons and positrons on this scale .",
    "to produce a significant number of dark force mediator particles , we desire to keep @xmath15 relatively large in order to maintain a large cross section for bound state formation .",
    "however , the energy of the fermions produced by the decay of the dark force mediator depends only on the mass of the @xmath0 particles and @xmath15 .",
    "therefore , to produce 10 gev - scale positrons and electrons , we must decrease @xmath53 to be on the scale of a few hundred gev .",
    "this is below the scale typically discussed in the wimponium literature .",
    "naively , these parameters appear to run into difficulties with the halo ellipticity bounds such as in @xcite ; for example , @xmath127 with @xmath87 appears to require @xmath128 , for which the dominant decay is to muons instead of @xmath129 .",
    "( however , it should be noted that the analytic approximation for the cross section begins to break down at @xmath130 . )",
    "this appears to eliminate the possibility of an observable electron or positron excess .",
    "however , a more detailed analysis of the bounds by @xcite suggests that these bounds should be about an order of magnitude weaker . in appendix",
    "[ ap : halo_extension ] , we have parametrized this uncertainty with the parameter @xmath131 , which is one if the considerations of @xcite are ignored .",
    "if one assumes @xmath132 , then a small region of parameter space remains which is consistent with the halo ellipticity bounds and @xmath12 is small enough ( 50 to 80 mev ) that the decay to @xmath133 dominates .",
    "the analysis proceeds as above , up to the point where one calculates the inverse compton scattering . for these lower energy electrons and positron",
    ", we do not expect inverse compton scattering to be a significant effect .",
    "however , other effects can influence the shape of the spectrum observed at earth ; for example , we must be particularly concerned with positron annihilation , which will generically decrease the detected positron fraction .",
    "we do expect these particles to lose energy due to bremmstrahlung .",
    "a detailed analysis could be run using cosmic ray propagation software such as galprop .",
    "however , we believe that it is unlikely that the resulting spectrum could be tuned to reproduce the observed positron excess observed in pamela  @xcite , fermi - lat  @xcite , and ams - ii @xcite .",
    "the energy spectrum of fermions produced through the decay of dark force mediator particles is flat , and while this spectrum will no doubt be modified by a detailed analysis of propagation from the galactic center to the solar system , we think the resulting @xmath134 is unlikely to be as flat as that observed by pamela . furthermore , the positron excess extends to higher energies beyond that which can be accomodated by our model .",
    "hence , we conclude that such models are unable to account for this observed excess .",
    "finally , we note that it may be possible to adjust the parameters so that an excess of positrons or electrons above pamela s observations is produced , although again careful analysis of the propagation of said fermions would be necessary .",
    "if such an excess can be produced , we would expect it decrease at or before the tev scale , at which point the spectrum would be limited due to inverse compton scattering energy losses . since no such behavior is observed in pamela s spectrum , one would translate this into bounds on the parameters .",
    "however , since the parameter space in which such a signal is potential possible is already quite small , any resulting constraints ( if any ) would be quite weak .",
    "in this section , we will discuss the signal produced by bremmstrahlung emission of a @xmath1 boson which decays to photons .",
    "first , we choose our free parameters consistent the constraints discussed in [ sec : constraints ] .",
    "then we calculate the rate at which @xmath1 bosons are produced via bremsstrahlung near the galactic center . finally , we determine the flux at the earth and compare with observations by the integral experiment .",
    "we will see that while the flux exceeds the flux produced via bound state production , the resulting signal is significantly beneath observational limits , due to the substantial background at lower energies .      in bremsstrahlung emission",
    ", the emitted @xmath1 boson will carry an energy comparable to the kinetic energy of the @xmath0 particles .",
    "since these have a velocity of order @xmath135 , this means that the typical energy scale of bremsstrahlung emission will be six orders of magnitude below @xmath53 .",
    "we will require @xmath136 because we do not want an additional suppression from the difficulty of emitting real @xmath1 bosons .",
    "this will influence the implementation of the constraints discussed in section [ sec : constraints ] .",
    "( we note , however , that due to the contribution of the tail of the relative velocity distribution , we do not necessarily expect a sharp cutoff at the average kinetic energy . )",
    "the first constraint comes from ref .",
    "@xcite , which determines the condition for astrophysical observations to be consistent with dark matter whose self - interaction is described by a yukawa potential .",
    "the precise constraint is a function of @xmath54 , the velocity at which @xmath55 peaks at a transfer cross section equal to @xmath56 . if @xmath137 , then the astrophysical constraints are consistent if @xmath138  @xcite",
    "; we will verify that we satisfy this condition below .",
    "combining this with @xmath136 reveals that we must satisfy @xmath139 let us choose @xmath140 and @xmath141 .",
    "next let us discuss the bound from halo ellipticity ; this will constrain the coupling @xmath84 .",
    "we extended the analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite to @xmath140 in appendix [ ap : halo_extension ] ; this showed that for @xmath141 and @xmath140 , we prefer to take @xmath142 although this may be loosened somewhat . if we choose to saturate this bound , we find @xmath143 .",
    "these values give @xmath144 , self - consistent with our initial assumption that @xmath137 .",
    "the bremsstrahlunged @xmath1 boson can be emitted by either of the @xmath0 particles ; however , it can also be emitted by the @xmath1 boson exchanged between the @xmath0 particles .",
    "these diagrams involve the coupling @xmath145 , which is thus far unconstrained . in order to enhance the signal",
    ", we will saturate the perturbativity bound , taking @xmath146 . on the other hand",
    ", we will also consider @xmath147 , which is equivalent to neglecting the two diagrams on the right of fig .",
    "[ fig : bremsstrahlung_diagrams ] .",
    "while this certainly wo nt help to increase our signal , the properties of the signal will be qualitatively different in the two cases in interesting ways .",
    "next , we must know the cross section for bremsstrahlung emission of a soft @xmath1 boson , which involves evaluating the 10 diagrams shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bremsstrahlung_diagrams ] .",
    "the derivation of this cross section , including averaging over the relative velocity of the incoming particles , is contained in appendix [ ap : bremsstrahlung_sigma ] . for the parameters given above , the cross section is @xmath148 .",
    "this is the same order of magnitude as the @xmath87 cross section for bound state formation ; we note , however , that we did not have to increase the coupling @xmath15 into the non - perturbative regime in order to reach this value . in general , as we would expect , the bremsstrahlung cross sections are indeed large in comparison to the bound state formation cross section .",
    "we shoud note that this cross section does not include any enhancement due to sommerfeld factors ; this contribution will be discussed later .",
    "also , although naive estimates would suggest a large enhancement , in this regime the sommerfeld factor may be unreliable and a proper resummation suggests that any enhancement is at most @xmath49 to @xmath149@xcite .",
    "this is discussed in somewhat more detail after the calculation of the cross section in appendix [ ap : bremsstrahlung_sigma ] .",
    "the rate of production of bremsstrahlung @xmath1 bosons is @xmath150 where @xmath105 is the number density of dark matter @xmath0 particles , and @xmath151 is given by equation .",
    "we have also averaged over the relative velocity of the @xmath0 bosons , and the integration extends from 1 kpc to 8 kpc , the distance from the solar system to the galactic center . for the given parameters , @xmath152 , or @xmath153 .",
    "as might be expected , for @xmath154 , we find the lower rate @xmath155 .",
    "the fact that the cross section drops by two orders of magnitude shows that at @xmath156 , the diagrams in which the bremsstrahlung @xmath1 boson is emitted by the exchanged @xmath1 boson dominate .",
    "since these diagrams are absent for @xmath147 , we expect the signals produced to have qualitative differences",
    ".    we will show that bremsstrahlung will not produce a detectable signal , while we found that for sufficiently large couplings bound state formation can .",
    "since this is perhaps a surprising result , one may find it beneficial to compare with the calculation of the bound state signal at each step to determine why this is so .",
    "we emphasize , however , that such comparisons must be made carefully , since the bound state calculations were performed in a different region of parameter space .",
    "we wish to emphasize that for any fixed perturbative value of @xmath15 , the rate of bremsstrahlung production will always be much greater than the rate of bound state formation , as one would expect .",
    "however , if one compares the value of @xmath157 found above with @xmath158 given in the previous section , which are evaluated at different parameters , one finds that @xmath158 is larger by about an order of magnitude , even though we have chosen parameters such that the cross sections are comparable .",
    "this is a result of taking @xmath140 here as opposed to @xmath102 above ; increasing @xmath53 decreases the number density @xmath159 .",
    "next we observe that the spectrum of the emitted @xmath1 bosons per @xmath160 event is given by @xmath161 as we might expect , this spectrum is sharply peaked at 600 kev , which is on the same scale as the kinetic energy .",
    "the spectrum of the produced @xmath1 bosons per unit time is @xmath162      for @xmath141 , the dominant decay mode of the @xmath1 boson is @xmath58 , which is decribed by equation .",
    "if we assume the mixing angle between the @xmath1 boson and the higgs boson is @xmath135 , then the typical lifetime of the produced @xmath1 bosons is @xmath163 , during which they travel about @xmath164 , which is significantly less than the @xmath165 between the galactic center and the solar system .",
    "the spectrum of the photons produced by the decay of the bremsstrahlung @xmath1 bosons is given by @xmath166 where the distribution of photon energies , as a function of the initial @xmath1 boson energies , is given by equation .",
    "( the @xmath167 dependence appears in evaluating the heaviside step functions . )",
    "as we would expect , this spectrum is peaked around 300 kev .",
    "we note that the tail decreases less rapidly as @xmath145 is decreased . as a result",
    ", the signal for @xmath147 will be skewed torwards higher energies .",
    "the production of dark force mediator particles results in an isotropic flux of these particles about the galactic center ; similarly , we expect the flux of their decay products to be isotropic about the galactic center .",
    "therefore , the photon flux per unit area is well - approximated by an equivalent point source at the galactic center .",
    "we can find the average flux per unit area , per unit solid angle by further dividing by @xmath123 , since the signal will appear to come from the hemisphere centered on the galactic center .",
    "we note that this is an average ; as a function of solid angle , we expect the signal to be greater near the galactic center and less further away from it . we also note that this is only an approximation to the true diffuse flux , meant to demonstrate that a detectable signal is possible ( and we remind the reader that we are already neglicting the contribution from the galactic center itself ) .",
    "we find that the average flux at the solar system is @xmath168 where @xmath169 is the distance from the galactic center to the solar system . since we have calculated the number of produced @xmath1 bosons out to a radius of 8 kpc , the signal we calculate here comes from the hemisphere centered on the galactic center , which explains the @xmath170 .",
    "we note that this is the average over the hemisphere ; the flux will be somewhat greater towards the galactic center and somewhat less towards the edges ; however , this is a relatively small effect , contributing perhaps an order of magnitude increase as we approach the center .    again ,",
    "with the same caveats as above , let us compare with the bound state case .",
    "the photon energies here are spread out over the scale of @xmath171 , whereas the photon signal for the bound state production is spread over the scall of @xmath172 .",
    "however , a single high energy fermion produces about @xmath173 gev - scale photons through scattering off of the cmb , while each @xmath1 boson produced through bremsstrahlung produces a mere 2 photons . as a result , the estimated ratio of fluxes is @xmath174 or @xmath175 .",
    "we note that since the two scenarios are in different regions in parameter space , this can not be interpretted as the ratio of actual bremsstrahlung - produced photons to bound state produced photons in the galaxy .",
    "the relevant energy scale for bremsstrahlung emission is on the scale of hundreds of kev , while the relevant energy scale for bound state emission is on the scale of a hundred gev .",
    "astrophysical backgrounds are significantly larger at this smaller scale ; the spi on the integral experiment records @xmath176 on the order of 1 to 10 @xmath177 for energies",
    "20 kev and 1000 kev  @xcite .",
    "the flux of produced photons can not be distinguished from this large backaground .",
    "particles and their subsequent decay for @xmath140 , @xmath141 .",
    "]    the resulting signal is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : brem_signal ] ; as we expect , it is about 8 orders of magnitude smaller than the bound state formation signal .",
    "more importantly , the larger @xmath146 signal is about 7 orders of magnitude beneath integral s observations .",
    "we also can see the qualitative difference in the signal shapes alluded to above ; this is because for @xmath156 , the rightmost two diagrams of fig .",
    "[ fig : bremsstrahlung_diagrams ] dominate , whereas these are absent if @xmath178 .",
    "we observe that without these diagrams , the signal is significantly smaller , but it is peaked at higher energies .",
    "we have noted above that the calculated cross section does not include a sommerfeld enhancement , because some analysis suggest that such large factors are unreliable @xcite . even if we assume that the naive sommerfeld factor given by @xmath179 is accurate to arbitrarily large scales , this enhancement is not sufficient to produce a detectable signal . for the parameters in the range discussed ,",
    "the enhancement is of order @xmath180 or @xmath181 , which is still too small to produce the seven orders of magnitude amplification required for the signal to be detectable .",
    "the signal can be increased by increasing the couplings ; and indeed , as discussed in appendix [ ap : halo_extension ] , there is some uncertainty in the halo ellipticity bounds . to produce a detectable",
    "signal requires increasing the coupling @xmath15 to @xmath182 , well outside the perturbative regime and far beyond what can be made consistent with the halo ellipticity bounds .",
    "it is true that @xmath145 is unrestricted by astrophysical bounds , but in order to amplify the two diagrams it appears in to the scale of integral s observations , we would need to take @xmath183 , which is unreasonably large .",
    "therefore , we conclude that bremsstrahlung emission of dark force mediator particles can not produce detectable signals , although the photon flux is generally significantly larger than bound state production .",
    "one might consider the idea that even if the signal produced near the galactic center is not detectable , perhaps such processes enhance the gamma ray or x - ray emission of nearby dwarf galaxies sufficiently to be observable ; however , a simple estimate reveals that this is not the case .",
    "even if the signal calculated above , for the milky way galaxy , was somehow shrunk into a dwarf galaxy 40 kpc from us which covered a @xmath184 by @xmath184 patch of the sky , the number of counts expected in an ideal @xmath185 detector is of order @xmath186 , which is again well below the background emission .",
    "we have considered indirect detection signals produced by a minimal asymmetric self - interacting dark matter . due to the @xmath3 asymmetry ,",

    "however , we demonstrated that asymmetric self - interacting dark matter can , in fact , produce a strong signal from the processes accompanying the formation of bound states , as has been discussed in the wimponium literature .",
    "we have found that signals are possible for sufficiently large couplings .",
    "this effect makes possible indirect detection of asymmetric self - interacting dark matter .",
    "the spectrum of gamma rays can help distinguish collisionless dark matter from self - interacting dark matter .",
    "we have performed explicit calculations for several sets of parameters ; showing that for @xmath87 , @xmath88 , and @xmath90 the signal would be detectable .",

    "additionally , we have also considered the signal produced by the bremsstrahlung emission of the @xmath1 boson .",
    "this was calculated for two points in parameter space ( @xmath187 with @xmath146 and @xmath178 ) to demonstrate two limits of spectrum shape .",

    "as was noted in section [ sec : constraints ] , the dominant interaction between the @xmath0 boson and nucleons , which is relevant for direct detection experiments , typically occurs through the exchange of a single higgs boson .",
    "this diagram is proportional to @xmath43 , which is otherwise unconstrained in our model , and therefore we can arbitrarily decrease this coupling , thus killing the signal .",
    "however , as we note in the text , there is another diagram which becomes dominant at sufficiently small values of the coupling : the @xmath0 boson may emit a @xmath1 boson , which transforms into a higgs boson via mixing and couples to a nucleon .",
    "this diagram involves the coupling @xmath84 and the mixing angle @xmath44 .",
    "we can not take either of these parameters to zero without eliminating the signal , although the mixing angle may be quite small .",
    "thus one can not arbitrarily decrease the @xmath0-nucleon cross section ; there is a minimum value set by this diagram . in this appendix",
    ", we will show that the contribution of this diagram is indeed quite small , as expected , and causes no tension with direct detection constraints .",
    "we note that the oscillation time scale , which is given by @xmath199 , is generally many orders of magnitude smaller than the interaction time scale , which can be estimated by considering the overlap of the wavefunctions . consequently , averaging over the  detector scale \" ( nucleon size ) , along with the source location , will simply give a factor of @xmath200 .",
    "( this is in contrast with certain neutrino oscillation experiments , for which @xmath201 may be large in comparison to other experimental scales , due to the small @xmath202 . in our scenario , @xmath203 . )",
    "the @xmath0 particles under consideration are generally much heavier than the protons ; we will masses between 4 and 10 tev .",
    "therefore , in the center of momentum reference frame the @xmath0 particles will be approximately stationary , while the protons approach at speeds of approximately @xmath34 .",
    "the momentum transfer is approximately @xmath204 , which is far below the scale at which the nucleon form factors must be included .",

    "all of our other choices for parameters give a cross section below this value .",
    "this is well beneath the limits from direct detection experiments , which are @xmath213 or @xmath214 @xcite , @xcite .",
    "there is a significant uncertainty in the contribution of the @xmath215-quark to the effective quark mass .",
    "since the higgs coupling to @xmath215 is much greater than the couplings to @xmath206 and @xmath216 , even a relatively small contribution of the sea quarks with higher masses can dominate the cross section .",
    "the measured @xmath215 quark contribution , manifest as the nuclear pion - nucleon sigma term , is uncertain , and the resulting uncertainty in the cross section can be as large as an order of magnitude  @xcite . however , even at the upper edge of the range , the cross section does not reach the present lowest cross sections accessible in experiment .",
    "hence , at present , direct detection experiments do not constrain the scenario we have considered .",
    "as was noted in section [ sec : sigma_decay ] , the mean free path for the @xmath1 particles in the galaxy must be greater than the distance they would travel before decaying ; otherwise , constant scattering can act like a quantum zeno experiment that prevents the decay . in this appendix , we present the calculation for the mean free path , and show that it is greater than the distance from the galactic center to the solar system for the relevant regions of parameter space .",
    "since the quartic coupling @xmath217 can be made aribtrarily small , we will assume that the scattering is dominated by the @xmath218 interaction mediated by an @xmath0 boson ; there are two diagrams that contribute , which are shown in fig .",

    "we do not assume any relation between @xmath219 and the kinetic energy of the @xmath0 particle .",
    "since the cross section is a relativistic invariant , we may evaluate it in the center of momentum frame , which under the above assumptions is attained by boosting by @xmath220 . keeping only the largest terms , we find that the initial and final four - momenta in the cm frame are @xmath221 where we have used the fact that the collision is elastic .",

    "if we decrease @xmath219 to 1 mev , the mean free path increases to order @xmath231 ( at 1 pc again ) .",
    "these values are all much greater than the @xmath165 between the galactic center and the solar system ; therefore , requiring that the @xmath1 particles decay before reaching the solar system provides a stronger bound as claimed .",
    "in this appendix , we calculate the cross section for two @xmath0 particles to form a bound state through the exchange of @xmath1 bosons . we emphasize that because the @xmath0 particles form a bound state , they do not escape to infinity , and therefore the born approximation is not applicable .",
    "we note that , although the coupling is strong , we are in the classical regime , because @xmath191 ; therefore we do not need to include additional quantum corrections such as those calculated numerically in @xcite .",

    "first , we will show that we can neglect the energy loss due to synchotron radiation , which is described by @xmath285 where the unitless coefficient @xmath286 is given by @xmath287 @xmath47 is the thomson cross section .",
    "since we consider a spherical region extending from 1 kpc to 8 kpc , very few of the fermions will be created in the galactic plane .",
    "therefore , the appropriate magnetic field is @xmath288  @xcite ,  @xcite , which gives @xmath289 .",
    "the energy loss of a single fermion due to inverse compton scattering is described by the equation @xmath290 where now the unitless coefficient is @xmath291 @xmath292 is the klein - nishina cross section , which reduces to the thomson cross section when relativistic corrections are negligible .",
    "since this is applicable for scattering with cmb photons , @xmath293 and is approximately independent of energy .",
    "( for the parameters with @xmath86 , we have @xmath294 instead . ) since this is two orders of magnitude larger than the corresponding value for synchrotron radiation , we may neglect energy loss due to synchrotron radiation .",
    "therefore , we calculate the photon energy spectrum from inverse compton scattering with cmb photons .",
    "the cosmic microwave background radiation is a blackbody at @xmath295 ; therefore the photon density per unit energy is @xmath296 where @xmath297 is the energy of the unscattered photon . for inverse compton scattering ,",
    "the number of scattered photons per unit energy per unit time produced by an electron or positron with lorentz factor @xmath298 is given by @xcite,@xcite @xmath299 where @xmath300 is @xmath301 and @xmath302 we have put a subscript on @xmath303 to remind us that this variable measures the time during which the fermion scatters against cmb photons .",
    "we use the symbol @xmath304 for the final energy of the scattered photon .",
    "the thomson limit corresponds to @xmath305 which is applicable here . by energy conservation ,",
    "only energies @xmath304 between the following values are allowed @xmath306 which we enforce by writing @xmath307",
    "this equation gives the number of photons per unit energy per unit time scattered by an electron or positron with energy @xmath308 . from the fermion energy distribution given in equation ,",
    "the corresponding @xmath298 distribution is @xmath309 for @xmath298 between the values @xmath310 averaging @xmath311 over the @xmath298 distribution gives @xmath312 this equation gives us the number of photons scattered per electron ( or positron ) per unit time ; however , we require the total number of photons scattered by one electron before it loses all of its energy . properly , we should integrate over @xmath303 ; this is complicated because @xmath298 is a function of @xmath303 .",
    "therefore , we will approximate @xmath313 where @xmath314 is the relevant time - scale for energy loss .",
    "this gives @xmath315 the equation describes the total number of scattered photons of a particular energy , per single electron or positron .",
    "we have evaluated this equation for the @xmath87 parameters and the result shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dnde ] for energies between 1 gev and 10 gev .",
    "we see that it drops off rapidly as a function of energy .",
    ", described by equation , evaluated for the first set of parameters ( @xmath87 , @xmath316  tev , @xmath317  mev ) . ]    to find the total number of photons per unit energy per unit time , we must multiply by the rate of production of the high energy fermions , which gives @xmath318",
    "in this appendix , we derive the cross section for bremsstrahlung emission of a @xmath1 boson in @xmath319 scattering .",
    "then 10 relevant tree - level diagrams are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bremsstrahlung_diagrams ] .",
    "note that the @xmath320 and @xmath206-channel diagrams cancel to lowest order in the @xmath321 limit .",
    "therefore , the resulting cross section may be smaller than what one may naively expect .",
    "let us denote the incoming four - momenta as @xmath322 and @xmath323 , the outgoing momenta of the two @xmath0 particles as @xmath324 and @xmath325 , and the outgoing momentum of the bremsstrahlung @xmath1 particle as @xmath326 .",
    "the matrix element is then      where the last term , in which the momenta @xmath324 and @xmath325 are switched , represents the contribution of the bottom row of diagrams .",
    "we will specialize to the center of mass frame ; we note that the total cross section is a relativistic invariant and therefore it is irrelevant what frame it is calculated in . without a loss of generality we write the momenta as @xmath328 @xmath329 @xmath330 @xmath331 and @xmath332    now we turn our attention to the cross section , which is given by @xmath333 where the extra @xmath200 comes from the two identical particles in the final state and @xmath334 is the lorentz - invariant phase space for the final state particles . in particular , this is @xmath335    in the phase space denominators , we may make the approximation @xmath336 , and we integrate over the 3-momentum delta function , setting @xmath337 .",
    "when the @xmath0 particles are non - relativistic , the energy delta function becomes @xmath338 let us call the angle between @xmath339 and @xmath340 @xmath341 .",
    "the delta function enforces @xmath342 which can be solved for @xmath343 in terms of @xmath344 and @xmath341 .",
    "@xmath345 we must of course ensure that the result is positive . by our choice of coordinates ,",
    "the @xmath346 integral is trivial ; this leaves the integrals over @xmath347 , @xmath348 , @xmath349 , and @xmath350 to be done numerically .",
    "this integral is not infrared divergent due to the nonzero mass of the @xmath1 boson .",
    "since the initial momentum in the center of momentum frame is @xmath351 , the above calculation gives @xmath352 .",
    "we can then average over the relative momentum @xmath353 using equation .",
    "finally , we address sommerfeld factors , which multiply the cross section and naively can have a large impact at low velocities .",
    "( note that this is a multiplicative factor in addition to the typical @xmath354 behavior of the cross section . )",
    "these describe the formation of a quasi - bound state during the interaction ; the modified cross section is @xmath355 for the parameters under consideration , these factors can be extremely large , of order @xmath180 or @xmath181 .",
    "however , it has been argued that in this regime the sommerfeld factor given above is unreliable ; additional diagrams beyond the ladder diagrams implicitly summed in the above equation must be taken into account and a proper resummation suggests the factors are of order @xmath49 to @xmath149 @xcite .",
    "this is supported by some experimental evidence @xcite , @xcite , including more recent observations at babar @xcite . as we note in the text , even these large sommerfeld factors (",
    "if correct ) would not be sufficient to produce a detectable signal through bremsstrahlung emission .",
