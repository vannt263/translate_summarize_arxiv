    "this enables spintronic devices that require neither any ferromagnetic materials , nor the control over magnetic field to operate @xcite .",
    "recently , a number of experimental @xcite and theoretical @xcite studies have investigated transport of heavy holes in rings .",
    "these studies are relevant because of the strong spin - orbit coupling of heavy holes confined to the ring @xcite , and long coherence length ( @xmath0 in carbon - doped gaas ) , making the interference effects in transport observable .",

    "the interference effects can be traced to the aharonov - bohm and aharonov - casher phases accumulated by a spin experiencing a time dependent field while moving along a trajectory through the ring . in the adiabatic limit",

    ", the spin texture of the orbiting carrier depends on the momentum ( see below ) and profoundly influences the transport .",
    "therefore , for the carriers with cubic spin - orbit coupling , the aharonov - casher phase can be controlled by changing the momentum of the carriers , without the need to modify the coupling constant .",
    "this point is especially important in the structures fabricated in symmetric quantum wells where the rashba coupling is absent , and the dresselhaus spin - orbit coupling is given by the crystalline structure . even though the coupling constant is fixed , due to the cubic form of spin orbit coupling , the aharonov - casher phase",
    "can still be indirectly controlled through the manipulation of the carrier momentum .",
    "in addition , the dresselhaus and rashba terms produce different patterns in conductance as a function of backgate voltage , so that the conductance in phase - coherent rings reveals the dominant type of spin - orbit coupling .",

    "this is in sharp contrast to the electrons in a two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) , where the spin - orbit is in the lowest order linear in momentum .",
    "effects of spin orbit coupling in general depend on the confinement , both to the 2dhg and to the ring .",
    "we will treat the spin - orbit coupling strengths @xmath22 and @xmath23 as free parameters and absorb the influence of the electrostatic potential that confines the holes to two dimensions into their values .",
    "in particular , if the confinement to two dimensions is caused by a symmetric potential , the rashba coupling vanishes , @xmath27 .",
    "we neglect the orbital effects of the magnetic fields so that @xmath28 is the kinetic momentum of the hole .    in order to illustrate the spin structure of ring eigenstates",
    ", we will first solve for the eigenvalues and wave functions of the heavy holes confined to the ring in the absence of magnetic field .",

    "states of the hole orbiting the ring in the limit of strong confinement are products of the ground state radial wave function in the potential @xmath29 , and a function of the angular coordinate @xmath33 . for strong radial confinement ,",
    "the motion of the hole in the ring is described by an effective hamiltonian that depends only on the angular coordinate along the ring and all the properties of the radial wave function enter the problem only through the parameters of the effective one - dimensional hamiltonian .",
    "the description in terms of the effective one - dimensional hamiltonian is valid when both the energy spacing of the 2dhg confinement and the energy spacing of the radial confinement are much larger than the energies associated with the motion along the ring .",
    "we find an effective hamiltonian for the ring by introducing the confinement potential @xmath29 in the radial direction in @xmath34 and reducing it to the subspace of the lowest radial mode , in analogy with @xcite . typically these results were obtained by introducing a model potential and explicitly calculating the angular hamiltonian for the lowest radial mode .",
    "the resulting one - dimensional effective hamiltonian for the harmonic radial confinement was found for the case of linear- @xcite and cubic rashba @xcite spin - orbit coupling .",
    "we note that generically the solution to the radial problem in an arbitrary potential can lead to divergences in the effective hamiltonian .",

    "the constraints can be proven using integration by parts in the radial part of the schrdinger equation , under the assumption that the radial part of the wave function vanishes at the origin together with its derivatives up to order 3 .",
    "we have checked that this conclusion holds in the limit of a series of potentials that converge to the hard wall .",
    "also , note that the relation between @xmath49 and @xmath50 is satisfied for the radial wave functions of the harmonic confinement for which @xmath51 diverges @xcite .",

    "we see that the strength of the spin - orbit coupling terms depends on the width of the one - dimensional ring @xmath32 through the parameter @xmath54 .",
    "this means that the spin - orbit coupling terms can be enhanced in a very narrow ring . in this limit , however , the spin - orbit coupling is effectively linear .",
    "therefore , the effects of the cubic spin - orbit coupling presented here will be pronounced in the rings of intermediate widths , and the strength of radial confinement that is strong enough for the approximation of the single radial mode to hold .",
    "the effective hamiltonian ( [ eq : h1d ] ) describes a ring of heavy holes in the presence of both dresselhaus and rashba spin - orbit interaction , when @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "our goal is to understand the role of cubic spin - orbit coupling in transport , and contrast its effects to the standard linear spin - orbit coupling , experienced by the electrons in a similar configuration .",

    "typical experiments measure the conductance as a function of the magnetic field that threads a magnetic flux through the ring and introduces the zeeman coupling . in our model of tunneling conductance",
    "the aharonov - bohm phase can be incorporated in the boundary conditions for the ring wave function , using the singular gauge .",
    "this leads to a quantization condition for @xmath180 , where @xmath181 is the flux threaded through the ring , and @xmath96 is the flux quantum .",

    "the gap between these doublets scales as @xmath187 ( @xmath188 ) for weak dresselhaus ( rashba ) spin - orbit coupling , while all the other states are separated by larger gaps that originate from the kinetic energy terms and persist in the absence of spin - orbit coupling .",

    "the quantum number @xmath13 is a half of an odd integer and @xmath202 .",
    "therefore , this simplified description correctly predicts the minima in conductance when half a flux quantum threads the ring .",
    "the conductance value is zero in this simple model , but it turns out to be nonzero when the additional levels are included in the more detailed model .",

    "this splitting is a clear signature of pseudospin dependent transport .",
    "the standard setup for a study of conductance oscillations as a function of the magnetic field consists of measuring the conductance at a fixed lead chemical potential and sweeping the external magnetic field .",
    "the conductance then typically reveals the oscillations with the period @xmath206 , @xmath207 being the ring surface area and @xmath96 the flux quantum .",
    "the spin - orbit coupling was found to modify these oscillations @xcite . in our model",
    "the conductance is modified due to the presence of four closely spaced energy levels that correspond to each peak in the conductance . at zero flux",
    "these four levels are the kramers doublets @xmath71 and @xmath208 .",
    "the splitting between these pairs in the absence of magnetic field is of second order in spin - orbit coupling . as the magnetic flux is threaded through the ring the quartet of levels splits , with two of the levels with @xmath209 gaining energy , and the levels with @xmath210 losing it .",

    "calculations for both plots are done for the lead chemical potential of @xmath213 , close to an energy level of an isolated ring in the absence of spin - orbit coupling , and the linear spin - orbit coupling model is derived from the cubic one by setting @xmath214 .",
