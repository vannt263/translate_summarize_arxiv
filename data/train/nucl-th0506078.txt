    "it is observed that the transport ratios depend on the difference @xmath111 as expected .",
    "however , in contrast to what was assumed in refs .",
    "@xcite , it is seen that they also depend on the pre - equilibrium emission which reduces the absolute value of the transport ratios .",
    "both effects are smaller in the case of the asysuperstiff @xmath2 , for which indeed a larger @xmath112 ratio is obtained .",
    "in this work we have studied processes related to isospin equilibration in semipheripheral collisions at fermi energies and their dependence on the symmetry term of the @xmath2 .",
    "a special feature of these reactions is the development of a low density interface between the two residues .",
    "the neck region is controlling the proton and neutron currents and their direction .",
    "the presence of density gradients also affects the isospin exchange between projectile and target and we have shown that this is sensitive to the density dependence of the symmetry energy .",
    "the neutron to proton ratio emitted during the interaction stage is also influenced by the asy-@xmath2 .",
    "the interplay between the two processes leads to a stronger equilibration for asy - soft @xmath2 , as it is evidenced by the isospin transport ( imbalance ) ratio . actually , in the asy - stiff case",
    ", a larger isospin transfer is observed , due to the presence of density gradients , directed from @xmath14 and @xmath15 towards the neck region .",
    "however , since we are studying binary processes , finally we observe a kind of compensation between the asymmetry of the matter transferred from projectile to target ( @xmath55 ) and from target to projectile(@xmath56 ) .",
    "> from this point of view , to put in better evidence effects due to the presence of density gradients , it would be more appropriate to study events where fragments originating from the neck region are also detected , possibly with their isospin content .    in the present study a rapidly increasing symmetry energy at subnormal densities ( asysuperstiff ) appears to be in better agreement with the existing data @xcite .",
    "more recent work also considered momentum dependent interactions , showing that the more repulsive character of the overall dynamics may reduce the symmetry energy stiffness required to reproduce the data @xcite .",
    "the study of the interplay between the effects due to the isoscalar and isovector part of the @xmath2 on isospin transport observables deserves further attention . in conclusion , charge equilibration measurements in semi - peripheral heavy ion collisions at fermi energies provide new independent observables to study the poorly known density dependence of the symmetry term of the nuclear eos .",
    "this is of interest for other properties of asymmetric matter , like neutron skin and isovector collective response in finite nuclei , and may also be important for neutron star crust structures @xcite .",
