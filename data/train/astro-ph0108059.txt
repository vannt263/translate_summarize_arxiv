    "rapid periodic oscillations are observed in the optical flux of high accretion rate ( `` high-@xmath4 '' ) cataclysmic variables ( nova - like variables and dwarf novae in outburst ) @xcite .",
    "these oscillations have high coherence ( @xmath5@xmath6 ) , short periods ( @xmath740  s ) , low amplitudes ( @xmath8% ) , and are sinusoidal to within the limits of measurement .",
    "they are referred to as `` dwarf nova oscillations '' ( dnos ) to distinguish them from the apparently distinct longer period , low coherence ( @xmath910 ) quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) of high-@xmath4 cataclysmic variables , and the longer period , high coherence ( @xmath10@xmath11 ) oscillations of dq  her stars .",
    "dnos appear on the rising branch of the dwarf nova outburst , typically persist through maximum , and disappear on the declining branch of the outburst .",
    "the period of the oscillation decreases on the rising branch and increases on the declining branch , but because the period reaches minimum about one day after maximum optical flux , dwarf novae describe a loop in a plot of oscillation period versus optical flux .",
    "the dwarf nova ss  cygni routinely exhibits dnos during outburst .",
    "optical oscillations have been detected at various times with periods ranging from 7.3  s to 10.9  s @xcite . in the soft x - ray and euv wavebands ,",
    "quasi - coherent oscillations have been detected in _ heao 1 _ led  1 data at periods of 9  s and 11  s @xcite , _ exosat _ le data at periods between 7.4  s and 10.4  s @xcite , _ euve _ ds data at periods between 2.9  s and 9.3  s @xcite , and _ rosat _ hri data at periods between 2.8  s and 2.9  s @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that the period of the euv oscillations of ss  cyg is a single - valued function of the euv flux ( hence , by inference , the mass - accretion rate onto the white dwarf ) , and explained the loops observed in plots of oscillation period versus optical flux as the result of the well - known delay between the rise of the optical and euv flux at the beginning of dwarf nova outbursts . while the quasi - coherent oscillations of ss  cyg are usually sinusoidal to high degree , @xcite pointed out the pronounced distortion of the euv waveform at the peak of the 1994 june / july outburst .",
    "we present here new observations in the optical and euv obtained during the 1996 october outburst of ss  cyg .",
    "as discussed by @xcite , aavso optical , _ euve _ , and _ rxte _ observations of ss  cyg were obtained during a multiwavelength campaign in 1996 october designed to study the wavelength dependence of the outbursts of dwarf novae .",
    "the _ euve _",
    "@xcite observations began on @xmath12 and ended on @xmath13 .",
    "data are acquired only during satellite night , which comes around every 95 min and lasted for 23 min ( at the beginning of the observation ) to 32 min ( at the end of the observation ) .",
    "valid data are collected during intervals when various satellite housekeeping monitors [ including detector background and primbsch / deadtime corrections ] are within certain bounds . after discarding numerous short ( @xmath14  min ) data intervals comprising less than 10% of the total exposure ,",
    "we were left with a net exposure of 208 ks .",
    "euv photometry is provided both by the deep survey ( ds ) photometer and short wavelength ( sw ) spectrometer , but the count rate is too low and the effective background is too high to detect oscillations in the sw data .",
    "unfortunately , the ds photometer was switched off between october 11.37 ut and october 14.70 ut because the count rate was rising so rapidly on october 11 that the _ euve _ science planner feared that the ds instrument would be damaged while the satellite was left unattended over the october 1213 weekend .",
    "we constructed an euv light curve of the outburst from the background - subtracted count rates registered by the two instruments , using a 72130    wavelength cut for the sw spectroscopic data , and applying an empirically - derived scale factor of 14.93 to the sw count rates to match the ds count rates .",
    "the resulting euv light curve is shown by the filled symbols in the upper panel of figure  1 , superposed on the aavso optical light curve shown by the small dots ( individual measurements ) and histogram ( half - day average ) .",
    "as shown by @xcite , the euv light curve _ lags _ the optical light curve by @xmath15 days during the rising branch of the outburst , then _ leads _ the optical light curve during the declining branch of the outburst .",
    "the secondary maximum of the euv light curve at the very end of the optical outburst appears to be real , and coincides with the recovery of the hard x - rays flux measured by _",
    "rxte _ @xcite .    to determine the period of the oscillations of the euv flux of ss  cyg , for each valid data interval we calculated the power spectra of the background - subtracted count rate light curves using 1.024  s bins ( the bin width of the primbsch / deadtime correction table ) .",
    "individual spectra typically consist of a spike superposed on a weak background due to poisson noise , so in each case we took as the period of the oscillation the location of the peak of the power spectrum in the interval @xmath16@xmath17 ( @xmath1810  s ) .",
    "the resulting variation of the period of the euv oscillation is shown in the lower panel of figure  1 .",
    "the oscillation was first convincingly detected on the rising branch of the outburst at a period of 7.81  s , fell to 6.59  s over an interval of 4.92  hr ( @xmath19 ) , _ jumped _ to 2.91  s , and then fell to 2.85  s over an interval of 4.92  hr ( @xmath20 ) before observations with the ds were terminated .",
    "when ds observations resumed 3.4 days later during the declining branch of the outburst , the period of the euv oscillation was observed to rise from 6.73  s to 8.23  s over an interval of 2.10 days ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "it is clear from the lower panel of figure  1 that the period of the euv oscillation of ss  cyg anticorrelates with the ds count rate , being long when the count rate is low and short when the count rate is high . to quantify this trend , we plot in figure  2 the log of the period of the oscillation as a function of the log of the ds count rate . as in the previous figure ,",
    "the data fall into two groups : one during the early rise ( distinguished with crosses ) and decline of the outburst , the other during the interval after the frequency of the oscillation had doubled .",
    "the trend during the early rise and decline of the outburst is clearly the same ; fitting a function of the form @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the ds count rate , an unweighted fit to the data gives @xmath24  s and @xmath25 .",
    "a similar fit to the data acquired after the oscillation frequency had doubled gives @xmath26  s and @xmath27 .",
    "the first trend is consistent with that observed during outbursts of ss  cyg in 1993 august and 1994 june / july @xcite , but the trend after the frequency had doubled is clearly distinct : not only did the oscillation frequency double , it s dependence on the ds count rate became `` stiffer '' by a factor of @xmath28 in the exponent .",
    "ss  cyg seems to have been doing what it could to avoid oscillating faster than about 2.8  s. if this is the keplerian period of material at the inner edge of the accretion disk , then @xmath29  s , requiring @xmath30 ( assuming the @xcite white dwarf mass - radius relationship ) . if instead , @xmath31",
    "s ( i.e. , the observed 2.8  s period is the first harmonic of a 5.6  s keplerian period ) , then @xmath32 .",
    "the data of @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite are consistent with a binary inclination @xmath33 and white dwarf mass @xmath34@xmath35 , hence favor the second option , but it requires only a @xmath36 reduction in the inclination angle to accommodate the first option .      in an effort to obtain the first simultaneous optical and euv / soft x - ray measurements of dwarf nova oscillations , optical photometry of ss  cyg was obtained with the 2.7-m telescope at mcdonald observatory and the stiening high - speed photometer on the nights of 1996 october 13 , 14 , and 15 ut . the stiening photometer simultaneously measures the flux in four bandpasses similar to the johnson @xmath0 bandpasses ( see @xcite for the effective wavelengths and widths of the bandpasses ) .",
    "fluxes were calibrated using the standard star bd+28@xmath374211 , and the time standard was utc as given by a gps receiver located at the dome of the telescope .",
    "the start times of the observations were @xmath38 , 370.644 , and 371.587 ; the run lengths were 3.14 , 1.37 , and 3.97 hr respectively ; and sample intervals were 0.5  s throughout .",
    "ss  cyg was observed to fade by @xmath39 mag between the first and second nights and by another @xmath40 mag between the second and third nights , but the mean flux ratios remained nearly constant from night to night : the @xmath41 flux ratios are @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 , with @xmath45 , 9.27 , and 9.56 for october 13 , 14 , and 15 ut , respectively .",
    "a search was made for optical oscillations by calculating the power spectra of the light curves in the various bandpasses .",
    "we found no detectable periodicities in the light curves from the first night with an upper limit on the relative amplitude @xmath46 for any periodicity between 2.5  s and 10  s. oscillations were detected on the second and third nights with periods of 6.58  s and 6.94  s , respectively .",
    "the mean properties of these oscillations are listed in table  1 .",
    "the fluxes in that table should be accurate to a few percent , and the oscillation amplitudes from the third night also should be accurate to a few percent , but on the second night the accuracy of the amplitude measurements are no better than @xmath47 because the light curves are weak and contaminated by noise so the oscillation amplitudes are poorly determined and biased upwards by noise .",
    "the band fluxes @xmath48 , oscillation amplitudes @xmath49 , and relative amplitudes @xmath50 from the third night are plotted in figure  3 , where it is apparent that the continuum flux of ss  cyg rises monotonically from @xmath51 through @xmath52 , while the absolute and hence the relative oscillation amplitudes are smallest in @xmath53 . as shown by the dotted line ,",
    "the @xmath1 spectral distribution of the oscillation amplitudes is reasonably consistent with rayleigh - jeans , whereas the spectral distribution of the continuum is much flatter : an unweighted fit to the @xmath1 measurements of the oscillation amplitudes and continuum assuming a function of the form @xmath54 yields @xmath55 and 0.57 , respectively",
    ".      to compare the periods of the oscillations detected in the euv and optical , we added the points for the optical periods to the lower panel of figure  1 .",
    "the period of the oscillation on the second night is about what one would expect from an extrapolation of the _ euve _ data , but , more importantly , the period of the oscillation on the third night is consistent with the value measured contemporaneously by _ euve_. to investigate this further , we focused the analysis on that ( unfortunately short ) interval when optical and _ euve _ data were obtained simultaneously : during @xmath56371.6724 and 371.7297371.7417 ; two stretches of strictly simultaneous observations separated by an _",
    "euve _ orbit .",
    "given the low amplitude of the optical oscillations , we calculated power spectra of the various bands in the encompassing interval @xmath57371.7417 .",
    "for the _ euve _ data , we calculated the power spectra separately for the two intervals .",
    "these spectra are plotted in the left panels of figure  4 ( where the euv power spectrum is the average of the two intervals ) . in each case",
    "( four optical bands , two euv intervals ) , the period of the oscillation is found to be 6.94  s ( actually , @xmath58",
    "s for the optical channels , @xmath59  s for the euv channel ; the higher accuracy for the optical channels is due to longer data interval ) . to determine the relative phase of these oscillations , we phase",
    "- folded the data assumed a common period of 6.94  s and a common zero point at @xmath60 , midway between the two data intervals .",
    "fitting a sine wave @xmath61 to each band separately , we derived the parameters listed in table  2 ; the phase - folded light curves and sinusoidal fits are shown in the right panels of figure  4 . the primary result from these efforts",
    "is that the relative phase of the oscillation is the same for all the bands . in particular , the phase of the euv and optical oscillations are the same within the errors : the difference is @xmath62 .",
    "the relative amplitudes derived by these means are higher than derived in the previous section , but it is to be expected that higher amplitudes will be derived over short intervals when the oscillation period is more nearly constant . as before , the oscillation amplitude is highest in @xmath52 , lowest in @xmath53 , and comparable at an intermediate value in @xmath63 and @xmath51 .",
    "we have described euv and optical photometric observations of ss  cyg obtained during its 1996 october outburst . during the rise to outburst , the period of the euv oscillation was observed to fall from 7.81  s to 6.59  s over an interval of 4.92  hr , _ jump _ to 2.91  s , and then fall to 2.85  s over an interval of 4.92  hr . during the decline from outburst ,",
    "the period of the euv oscillation was observed to rise from 6.73  s to 8.23  s over an interval of 2.10 days .",
    "optical oscillations were detected on the second and third nights of observations during the decline from outburst with periods of 6.58  s and 6.94  s , respectively . during the times of overlap between the optical and euv observations on the third night ,",
    "the oscillations were found to have the same period and phase ; they differ only in their amplitudes , which are 34% in the euv and 0.05%0.1% in the optical .    the first striking aspect of these observations is the frequency doubling observed on the rise to outburst .",
    "ss  cyg appears to have undergone a `` phase transition '' at a critical period @xmath64  s , when the frequency of its oscillation doubled ( fig .  1 ) and the `` stiffness '' of its period - intensity relation ( @xmath65 ) increased by a factor of @xmath28 in the exponent ( fig .  2 ) .",
    "optical oscillations were detected on the second and third nights of observations at periods above @xmath66 , but not on the first night when an extrapolation of the trend would predict an oscillation period below @xmath66 .",
    "it is interesting to speculate that the optical oscillations of ss  cyg ( and possibly other dwarf novae ) disappear on the rise to outburst when ( if ) the source makes the transition to the higher oscillation frequency and `` stiffer '' period - intensity state , and then reappear on the decline from outburst when the source reverts back to its normal state .",
    "additional simultaneous optical and euv / soft x - ray observations are required to determine if this is the case .",
    "such observations are also required to determine if this transition takes place at the same period on the rise to and decline from outburst , or whether there is a `` hysteresis '' in the transition .",
    "the observational data are consistent with ss  cyg pulsating at a fundamental period @xmath67  s , then switching to a first harmonic and stiffening its period - intensity ( by inference period-@xmath4 ) relationship so as to avoid oscillating faster than @xmath68  s. this minimum period @xmath69  s is consistent with the keplerian period at the inner edge of the accretion disk if , as seems to be the case observationally , the binary inclination @xmath70 and the mass of the white dwarf @xmath71 .",
    "a secure white dwarf mass would confirm this interpretation .",
    "the second striking aspect of these observations is the lack of a phase delay between the euv and optical oscillations measured simultaneously on the third night ( fig  4 ) .",
    "the relative phase delay @xmath72 for @xmath73  s , or @xmath74  s. the @xmath75 upper limit @xmath76",
    "s corresponds to a distance @xmath77  cm .",
    "if the euv oscillation originates near the white dwarf , and the optical oscillation is formed by reprocessing of euv flux in the surface of the accretion disk , the delays @xmath78 , where the binary inclination @xmath33 and @xmath79 is the azimuthal angle from the line of sight .",
    "then , the distance to the reprocessing site @xmath80  cm . to give a sense of scale",
    ", this is about 30 white dwarf radii or one - third the size of the disk .",
    "in contrast , eclipse observations of ux  uma @xcite , z  cha @xcite , and ht  cas @xcite indicate that in these high-@xmath4 cataclysmic variables much or all of the disk contributes to the optical oscillations",
    ". the much smaller size of the optical emission region in ss  cyg is derived from an application of echo mapping , made possible for the first time by our strictly simultaneous optical and euv observations .",
    "the other diagnostic of the optical oscillations is their spectrum , which is nearly rayleigh - jeans in @xmath1 ( fig .",
    "3 ) . given this result",
    ", it is interesting to ask if the @xmath1 oscillations of ss  cyg are simply due to the rayleigh - jeans tail of the spectrum responsible for the euv oscillations .",
    "@xcite discuss the euv spectrum of ss  cyg and show that it can be parameterized in the 72130    _ euve _ sw bandpass by a blackbody absorbed by a column density of neutral material .",
    "acceptable fits to the spectrum are possible for a wide range of temperatures @xmath81 , hydrogen column densities @xmath82 , and luminosities @xmath83 , but the tight correlation between these parameters significantly constrains the allow region of parameter space . from figures 810 of mauche ,",
    "raymond , & mattei , a reasonable set of acceptable parameters is as listed in the first three columns of table  3 , where we have assumed a source distance @xmath84 pc and a fiducial sw count rate of @xmath85 .",
    "scaling to the sw count rate of @xmath86 observed during the interval of overlap on the third night of observations , the fractional emitting area of these blackbodies @xmath87 are as listed in the fourth column of table  3 for an assumed white dwarf radius @xmath88  cm . with the exception of the coolest model , these fractional emitting areas are smaller than the value @xmath89 expected for a boundary layer with a scale height @xmath90 .",
    "the @xmath63 band flux densities @xmath91 of these models are as listed in the fifth column of table  3 , and after multiplying by the euv oscillation amplitude of 34% they become the oscillation amplitudes @xmath92 listed in the sixth column of table  3 . with an observed oscillation amplitude @xmath93 jy ( table  2 ) , the relative model oscillation amplitudes @xmath94 are as listed in the seventh column of table  3 .",
    "we conclude that a single source can ( within a factor of @xmath95 ) produce both the euv and @xmath1 oscillations of ss  cyg if its boundary layer temperature @xmath96  ev and hence its luminosity @xmath97 .",
    "unfortunately , other data can not confirm or exclude this possibility .",
    "first , while blackbody fits to _ heao  1 _ led  1 and _ rosat _ pspc soft x - ray spectra _ favor _",
    "temperatures @xmath9830 ev , they are not _ inconsistent _ with temperatures as low as @xmath99  ev @xcite .",
    "second , while the strength of the @xmath100 emission line at the peak of the outburst implies a boundary layer luminosity @xmath101 , hence @xmath98  ev , the luminosity can be increased to the required value if the fraction of the boundary layer luminosity intercepted by the disk is decreased from @xmath102 to @xmath103 ; such a model has the added charm of producing the _ expected _ boundary layer luminosity @xmath104 ( mauche , raymond , & mattei ) .",
    "the recent _ chandra _ letg spectrum of ss  cyg in outburst will better constrain the boundary layer parameters , hence allow us to determine if the boundary layer can produce both the euv and @xmath1 oscillations .    either way ,",
    "we are left to explain the enhancement of the oscillation amplitude in @xmath51 over that predicted a by rayleigh - jeans spectrum ( fig .  3 ) .",
    "we have no compelling explanation for this datum , but the echo mapping constraint from above still applies , so the source of the extra oscillation amplitude in @xmath51 must lie within the inner third of the accretion disk .",
    "we note that @xcite recently measured the spectrum of the optical oscillations of the dwarf nova v2051 oph in outburst and found that the oscillation amplitudes of the balmer and he  i emission lines were stronger than the continuum by factors of @xmath105 .",
    "our @xmath51 bandpass contains the h@xmath106 emission line , so it interesting to speculate that the enhanced oscillation amplitude in @xmath51 might be due to the larger oscillation amplitude of the h@xmath106 line flux compared to the continuum .",
    "unfortunately , it seems unlikely that the needed factor - of - two enhancement can be produced this way .",
    "also , for this explanation to work , the higher - order balmer lines must not significantly enhance the oscillation amplitude in @xmath63 .",
    "fast optical spectroscopy of ss  cyg in outburst is required to determine if this scenario can explain the enhanced oscillation amplitude in @xmath51 , and , more generally , to determine if our explanation of the origin of the @xmath1 oscillations is correct .",
    "clearly , there is much more observational work to be done .",
    "the _ euve _ observations of ss  cyg could not have been accomplished without the efforts of the members , staff , and director , j.  mattei , of the american association of variable star observers ; _ euve _ deputy project scientist r.  oliversen ; _ euve _ science planner b.  roberts ; the staff of the _ euve _ science operations center at cea , and the flight operations team at goddard space flight center .",

    "<S> using euv photometry obtained with the _ extreme ultraviolet explorer _ ( _ euve _ ) satellite and @xmath0 optical photometry obtained with the 2.7-m telescope at mcdonald observatory , we have detected quasi - coherent oscillations ( so - called `` dwarf nova oscillations '' ) in the euv and optical flux of the dwarf nova ss  cygni during its 1996 october outburst . </S>",
    "<S> there are two new results from these observations . </S>",
    "<S> first , we have for the first time observed `` frequency doubling : '' during the rising branch of the outburst , the period of the euv oscillation was observed to _ </S>",
    "<S> jump _ from 6.59  s to 2.91  s. second , we have for the first time observed quasi - coherent oscillations _ simultaneously _ in the optical and euv . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the period and phase of the oscillations are the same in the two wavebands , finally confirming the long - held assumption that the periods of the optical and euv / soft x - ray oscillations of dwarf novae are equal . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath1 oscillations can be simply the rayleigh - jeans tail of the euv oscillations if the boundary layer temperature @xmath2  ev and hence the luminosity @xmath3 ( comparable to that of the accretion disk ) . </S>",
    "<S> otherwise , the lack of a phase delay between the euv and optical oscillations requires that the optical reprocessing site lies within the inner third of the accretion disk . </S>",
    "<S> this is strikingly different from other cataclysmic variables , where much or all of the disk contributes to the optical oscillations . </S>"
