    "the fact that electron - photon system is only in a weak resonance here can be confirmed by inspecting figures [ fig - erof - x ] , [ fig - erof - y ] , and [ fig_erofneg ] .",
    "all the same , it is necessary to have in mind that even for the @xmath31-polarization here , we have dressed electron states with a mixed photon content .",

    "we have used our model of electron transport through a central system with interacting electrons and photons to describe the time evolution of the system after it has been started / prepared in a certain eigenstate of the closed system .",
    "time resolved experiments in this field have not yet been performed , but transport experiments on electron systems in photon pumped cavities are gaining strength.@xcite the importance of time dependent modeling of the systems is twofold : first , they allow us to gain insight into the underlying processes in the system .",
    "second , with the knowledge of these active fundamental processes and their time evolution we can research the states of the system we would like to maintain with an external photon pumping and their relations , even in a system with a complex structure .",
    "accuracy in numerical calculations is essential and error can cumulate in different parts of a model evaluation .",
    "we have taken care designing all functional bases and necessary truncations thereof balancing ram memory requirements and exactness of the results for the closed system within reasonable bounds , not shying away from heavy ram usage .",
    "this is only feasible with heavy parallelization of the code .",
    "as we use no time - integration of the equation of motion for the long times we are interested in , we escape errors seeping in through finite time steps in an integration .",

    "this is a nontrivial task and has been studied within the qutip python - framework.@xcite in our approach the accuracy of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors measured by the trace of the reduced density operator is such that the trace is always equal to 1 with at least 8 accurate figures for all the cases described here , evaluated with double precision in fortran .",
    "we only notice a deviation form this level of accuracy if we attempt a calculation with no states in the bias window defined by the chemical potentials of the left and right external leads .",
    "only 84 points , exponentially distributed on the time - axis , are used in the figures to conserve computational time",
    ". a careful study of the details of the relaxation of the spin components forming a braided pattern , for example in figure [ fig_occ - vg20 ] in the range @xmath111 ps , would require more points .",
    "as expected , resonant tunneling through the lowest states of the central system quickly bring it into a steady state .",
    "the situation becomes more complex if the bias window defined by the external leads is located higher in the many - body energy spectrum .",
    "then the character of the states in the window and below it , shaped by their geometry and the coupling between the constituents of the system , are of importance . in these cases",
    "we find small but important off - resonance current through the system .",
    "we observe that even when the system , judged from the transport current through it , seems to have reached a steady state there still can be slow internal processes at work bringing it into the real ( final ) steady state .",
    "( see , for example , figures [ fig_curr - vg20 ] and [ fig_occ - vg20 ] )    from our modeling efforts it is clear that the character of the transport into and through the system is highly tunable with , or strongly depends on , the plunger gate voltage and the photon frequency of the cavity .",
    "this fact underlines the importance of a computationally effective approach to explore the dynamic properties of the system,@xcite and the possibility to enhance further the description of the details of the underlying physical processes beyond the presently implemented sequential tunneling to high order .",
