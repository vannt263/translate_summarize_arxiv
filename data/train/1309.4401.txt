    "mostly because of the ever improving precision achieved by casimir force experiments  @xcite , it has become important to be able to discriminate that force from other interactions which , under some circumstances , may even mask it completely . among them ,",
    "the most relevant ones are usually electrostatic in nature .",
    "indeed , in the usual experimental setup one deals with metallic mirrors which , even if electrically neutral , may still produce relevant residual effects .",
    "surface imperfections can lead to a local departure from ideal metallic behaviour , yielding space - dependent ` patch ' potentials on the mirrors surfaces .",
    "those potentials , which may be interpreted as due to the existence of superficial dipole layers on otherwise neutral bodies  @xcite , can indeed produce a force .",
    "this force may be relevant in precision experiments related to many different areas of physics  @xcite .    for the case of two infinite parallel planes , that force has been studied in detail by speake and trenkle in ref.@xcite .",
    "the force is , naturally , a function of @xmath1 , the distance between the mirrors , and of the patch potentials on the surfaces .",
    "it has been shown , however , that the force depends on the potentials only through their autocorrelation functions . a conceptually different situation , which however leads to a formally identical result corresponds to random potentials . in those cases ,",
    "the correlation functions is all the information we have about the underlying potentials .",
    "recent casimir effect experiments do involve , however , different geometries .",
    "of particular interest is the case of a sphere in front of a plane ; the influence of patch potentials in casimir measurements for this geometry has been recently analyzed in ref.@xcite , using a proximity force approximation ( pfa ) @xcite . the same system has also been studied by using an exact numerical approach  @xcite .",
    "the pfa approach amounts , in this context , to a local application of the parallel plate result , and may therefore be implemented based in the results of ref.@xcite .",
    "it is the aim of this paper to go beyond the pfa , by extending the results for the patch potentials force , known for parallel planes , to a class of different geometries , namely , to the case of an infinite plane facing a slightly curved surface . by the latter we mean a surface which curvature radius is much larger than the distance between the surfaces .",
    "moreover , we know that in this situation the casimir interaction may be calculated using a derivative expansion ( de ) approach  @xcite , of which the proximity force approximation ( pfa ) is the leading term",
    ". we shall construct here the same approximation for the patch potentials force , namely , the first nontrivial correction to the pfa .    with the extra requirement that the autocorrelation lengths should also be smaller than the curvature radius of the curved surface , we shall be able to apply here essentially the same approach used in the casimir case to the calculation of the leading and subleading terms for the patch potential electrostatic interaction",
    ". the leading term will of course amount to the well - known pfa , while the subleading one shall account for the first correction to it .    to be more precise about the system that we consider",
    ", it will consist of two static surfaces , denoted by @xmath2 and @xmath3 , embedded in @xmath4-dimensional space .",
    "@xmath2 shall be assumed to be flat , and , by a proper choice of coordinates , to coincide with the @xmath5 plane ( @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 denote the three cartesian coordinates of a point @xmath9 in this coordinate system ) .",
    "the @xmath3 surface is , on the other hand , assumed to be definable by a single function , namely , by an equation of the form  , where . this assumption does not cover all the possible curved surfaces ; however , it is sufficiently general as to describe the usually considered experimental setups . as",
    "advanced , the @xmath3 surface will be assumed to be smooth , something that will be quantified below in terms of @xmath0 , its derivatives , and the correlation lengths characterizing the patch potentials .",
    "the extension to the case of two slightly deformed surfaces is straightforward .    in a previous work",
    "@xcite , dealing with a de approach to the electrostatic interaction between perfect conductors , we analyzed what may be regarded as a limiting case of a system with patch potentials .",
    "namely , one in which the surfaces @xmath2 and @xmath3 are held at constant potentials , so that there is a constant electrostatic potential difference @xmath10 between them .",
    "there , at second order , the de of the electrostatic energy @xmath11 stored between the surfaces was found to be : @xmath12 \\;. \\label{de perf}\\ ] ] on the other hand ( for a system with the same geometry ) in the presence of patch potentials , on general grounds we expect a de expansion ( up to the same order ) to have the form : @xmath13\\ , , \\label{de expected}\\ ] ] where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are functions that depend on the shape of the @xmath3 surface and on the correlation functions for the patch potentials on both surfaces .",
    "one of our main goals in this paper is to find an explicit expression for the function @xmath15 ( the zeroth - order , pfa contribution has already been computed in previous works ) .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sec : energy ] , we obtain a formal general expression for the electrostatic interaction energy between the two surfaces , in terms of the correlation function between the patch potentials , and of the exact dirichlet green s function for the spatial region delimited by the two surfaces . based on that formal expression we obtain , in section  [ sec : expansion ] , the electrostatic interaction energy for small departures from the parallel planes case . in section",
    "[ sec : deriv expansion ] , we use those results to expand the interaction energy up to the second order in derivatives , and apply the results to different geometries and different models for the correlation functions of the patch potentials . our final remarks are included in section [ sec : conc ] . the appendix contain some details of the expansion of the green s function for almost flat surfaces .",
    "in order to obtain the interaction energy , we calculate the electrostatic potential @xmath16 , solution to an electrostatic problem in the region @xmath17 , limited by the surfaces @xmath2 and @xmath3 , namely , @xmath18 .",
    "a proper definition of the problem requires some care , since one wants to consider the seemingly inconsistent situation of having space dependent potentials on the surfaces of conducting bodies .",
    "we bypass that problem by following the approach of ref.@xcite , where the conflicting conditions are introduced on ( infinitesimally close ) different surfaces .",
    "more concretely , the electrostatic problem is defined for the volume @xmath17 , with dirichlet type boundary conditions on the @xmath2 and @xmath3 surfaces .",
    "patch potentials are then introduced not on @xmath2 and @xmath3 , but on two slightly shifted surfaces , @xmath19 and @xmath20 , defined by @xmath21 and @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) , respectively .",
    "potentials are not introduced as boundary conditions ( they have already been defined on @xmath2 are @xmath3 ) ; rather , one models them by means of two electric dipole layers with surface densities @xmath24 , ( @xmath25 : unit normal to the respective surface ) .    in the limit when the layers are adjacent to the surfaces , those moment distributions generate variations in the surface potentials , determined by two functions , , which indeed do fix the potential @xmath16 on the inner face of @xmath2 and @xmath3 , respectively .",
    "thus , the electrostatic problem amounts to one where the charge density inside @xmath17 ( associated to the dipole layers above ) is given by : @xmath26 \\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath27 , the limit whereby the dipole layers approach the two surfaces ` from inside ' shall be taken when deriving the expression for the energy ( see below ) .",
    "the energy @xmath28 may be written in terms of the scalar potential @xmath29 , as follows : @xmath30 to proceed , we need to write @xmath28 in terms of @xmath31 and @xmath32 . the formal solution for @xmath16 inside @xmath17",
    "may be written in terms of the dirichlet green s function @xmath33 , defined for @xmath9 and @xmath34 in @xmath17 , as follows : @xmath35 in our conventions , @xmath36 is determined by the equations : @xmath37 besides , the dirichlet green s function is symmetric : @xmath38 .    inserting eq.([rho ] ) into eq.([solgen ] ) , we obtain @xmath39 where @xmath40 denotes the surfaces of the two layers , and @xmath41 is the directional derivative along the outer normal to @xmath42 at each point on the surface , and @xmath43 is the surface element at each point @xmath44 .",
    "note that the r.h.s .",
    "of the equation above is completely determined by the prescribed values @xmath45 of the patch potentials on @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "inserting now ( [ eq : solphi ] ) into ( [ eq : defw ] ) , integrating by parts , using ( [ eq : green ] ) , and then letting @xmath27 , we see that @xmath28 may be written as follows : @xmath46 where we have removed the @xmath47 subscript for the surfaces since the @xmath27 has been taken .",
    "the kernel @xmath48 is constructed in terms of the normal derivatives of the exact green s function @xmath36 on @xmath49 : @xmath50 note that the presence of the metallic media has been taken into account , by discarding boundary terms which involve the values of the green s function on those media . at this point",
    "the distinction between @xmath51 and @xmath52 ceases to be necessary , since we have ended up with an expression where one has to integrate on the inner faces of the mirrors only .",
    "expression ( [ eq : wg ] ) has to be now particularized to the case of the region we are considering , and the assumed values for the potential on the boundary .",
    "denoting by @xmath53 , @xmath54 the special form adopted by the kernel @xmath48 when its first argument belong to the surface @xmath55 and its second argument to @xmath56 , we see that : @xmath57 where : @xmath58 where we have written the area element in terms of the parametrization of the respective surface , namely , on @xmath2 , @xmath59 , while on @xmath3 : @xmath60 .",

    "to obtain the de , following the approach we introduced in previous references , we consider now the situation with @xmath71 , and expand @xmath28 in powers of @xmath72 , up to the second order .",
    "this expansion shall induce the corresponding expansion for @xmath28 , @xmath73 where the index denotes the corresponding order in @xmath72 .",

    "the leading term of the interaction energy can be obtained by evaluating the densities above in fourier space .",
    "the result is @xmath91 where we have used the symmetry @xmath92 ; besides , @xmath93 is by construction a function of @xmath94 .",
    "it is worth mentioning at this point that an identical result would follow from the assumption of the existence of purely statistical correlations between the potentials .",
    "the result of eq.([eq : orden0 ] ) coincides , up to terms independent of @xmath1 , with that of ref .",
    "one could try to recover the usual result for perfect conductors assuming that @xmath95 and @xmath96 . in this case",
    "eq.([eq : orden0 ] ) gives @xmath97 , i.e. the usual result for a capacitor with the opposite sign .",
    "this sign comes from the fact that we are computing the electrostatic energy for two grounded surfaces with dipole layers close to them , that we are modelling with the potentials @xmath98 .",
    "the case of two surfaces at different potentials has an additional surface term ( discarded in the formal derivation of the previous section ) that would reverse the sign in the final answer .",
    "regarding the @xmath99 order , it is quite straightforward to see that it vanishes under the assumption that the spatial average of @xmath72 is zero . this will be enough for our purpose of computing the de ( see below ) .",
    "finally , let us consider now the second order contributions .",
    "we shall neglect here the @xmath100 correlations , since they are assumed to be strongly suppressed with the distance between plates ( at least in comparison with the autocorrelations @xmath101 ) .",

    "we shall further assume that even when one of the surfaces is curved , the product of the two potentials is appreciably different from zero only when the distance between the two arguments is small .",
    "assuming that this autocorrelation length is much smaller than the curvature radius , we shall still assume the translation invariance of the arguments in the green s function on that region .",
    "in this way , those contributions may be again written in terms of the autocorrelation functions , namely , @xmath103_{x'_3=x''_3=0}^{(2 ) } \\omega_{ll}({\\mathbf x_\\parallel''}-{\\mathbf x_\\parallel ' } ) \\nonumber\\\\ u^{(2)}_{rr } & = & \\frac{\\epsilon_0}{2}\\ , \\int_{{\\mathbf x_\\parallel'},{\\mathbf x_\\parallel '' } } \\ ; \\big[\\partial'_3 \\partial''_3 g({\\mathbf x'},{\\mathbf x''})\\big]_{x'_3=\\psi({\\mathbf x_\\parallel ' } ) , x''_3=\\psi({\\mathbf x_\\parallel''})}^{(2)}\\ , \\omega_{rr}({\\mathbf x_\\parallel''}-{\\mathbf x_\\parallel'})\\;.   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    then , performing the expansion of the green s function , a rather lengthy but otherwise standard calculation shows that , for @xmath104 , @xmath105 with : @xmath106 it is reassuring to verify that , as it happened with the zeroth - order term , the perfect conductor limit is correctly obtained ; namely , when @xmath107 and @xmath96 , one has @xmath108 , @xmath109 and eq .",

    "naturally , lagrange s multipliers become also functions of the source point @xmath34 .",
