    "recently , research on the spinel compound liv@xmath0o@xmath1 has been an exciting field since the discovery of the large electronic specific heat coefficient @xmath3 = 420 mj / mol@xmath4k@xmath5 at low temperature  @xcite .",
    "this value of @xmath3 is the largest among @xmath6-electron compounds .",
    "moreover , liv@xmath0o@xmath1 has been found to exhibit heavy - fermion like behavior ; i.e. , a broad maximum in the magnetic susceptibility @xmath7  @xcite , @xmath8-dependence in the electrical resistivity  @xcite , and the korringa type relaxation , @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the spin - lattice relaxation rate derived from the @xmath11li - nmr measurements  @xcite .",
    "it should also be noted that the solid - solution li@xmath12zn@xmath13v@xmath0o@xmath1 undergoes a metal - insulator transition as a function of @xmath14  @xcite . in spite of enormous studies ,",
    "however , origin of these anomalous behavior is not clearly solved .",
    "several models have been proposed to explain the physical properties of liv@xmath0o@xmath1 . at first",

    "have shown that their @xmath11li - nmr results are consistent with this mechanism .",
    "however , temperature dependence of the electrical resistivity at high temperatures differs qualitatively from that of the @xmath15-electron based kondo - lattice systems  @xcite . for the kondo - lattice formation in liv@xmath0o@xmath1 , both the conduction and the localized electrons are needed , whereas the presence of well - defined localized electrons is not clearly demonstrated . on the other hand , fujiwara _ et al . _",
    "have interpreted their @xmath11li - nmr results as the characteristic behavior of itinerant - electron systems with strongly - enhanced ferromagnetic spin - fluctuations  @xcite .",
    "they have shown that the temperature dependence of @xmath10 is well described by the spin - fluctuation theory ( scr theory ) for weakly- or nearly - ferromagnetic metals  @xcite .",
    "neutron scattering studies by krimmel _",
    "have also suggested possible nearly - ferromagnetic state for liv@xmath0o@xmath1 at high temperatures  @xcite .",
    "thus , physical properties of liv@xmath0o@xmath1 have been argued in terms of completely different electronic states , i.e. , localized- or itinerant - electron systems .",
    "in addition , the effect of geometrical frustration arising from the spinel structure is suggested to be essential for the anomalous behavior in liv@xmath0o@xmath1  @xcite .",
    "this is inferred from the observations of spin - glass order in a slightly mg- or zn - doped variants  @xcite .    to obtain further insight for the magnetic state of liv@xmath0o@xmath1",
    ", we have performed a high - field magnetization measurement on liv@xmath0o@xmath1 . since magnetic field",
    "can enhance the ferromagnetic spin - correlation , this experiment would give valuable information about the spin correlation in liv@xmath0o@xmath1 . to see the effect of geometrical frustration , we have also studied on an oxygen - deficient sample liv@xmath0o@xmath2 .",
    "powder sample of liv@xmath0o@xmath1 was prepared by a solid state reaction from powder samples of li@xmath16vo@xmath1 , v@xmath0o@xmath16 , and v@xmath0o@xmath17 . the same procedure reported in ref .",
    "@xcite was employed .",
    "an oxygen deficient sample liv@xmath0o@xmath2 was prepared by varying the nominal composition .",
    "x - ray diffraction confirmed the spinel structure for both the samples .",
    "magnetic susceptibility was measured using a superconducting quantum interference device ( squid ) magnetometer at 1 koe .",
    "high - field magnetization measurements were performed at 4.2 k by an induction method with well - balanced pickup coils .",
    "magnetic fields up to 45 t were generated by a long - pulse magnet at the institute for solid state physics , university of tokyo .",
    "figure 1 shows inverse magnetic susceptibility 1/@xmath7 of liv@xmath0o@xmath1 and liv@xmath0o@xmath2 as functions of temperature @xmath18 . for both the systems",
    ", @xmath7 follows a curie - weiss behavior at high temperatures , and shows no evidence of magnetic ordering down to 2 k. 1/@xmath7 of liv@xmath0o@xmath1 shows a saturation behavior around 10 k , and slightly decreases below 5 k. this small decrease is attributed to the contribution of impurities and/or defects . subtracting this contribution by a curie term yields a minimum at @xmath19 = 16 k , as can be seen in the dotted line in fig .",
    "this is consistent with those reported by several authors  @xcite .",
    "1/@xmath7 of liv@xmath0o@xmath2 also shows a curie - weiss behavior , and the data above 60 k agree with those of liv@xmath0o@xmath1 . below about 20 k ,",
    "1/@xmath7 of liv@xmath0o@xmath2 decreases rapidly without any anomaly .",
    "absence of anomaly in @xmath7 of liv@xmath0o@xmath2 has been suggested previously  @xcite .",
    "one may consider that a large contribution from defects masks a minimum in the intrinsic @xmath20 of liv@xmath0o@xmath2 .",
    "however , we found that a minimum is not given in @xmath20 of liv@xmath0o@xmath2 by reasonable corrections .",
    "this suggests that @xmath7 of liv@xmath0o@xmath2 at low temperature is qualitatively different from that of liv@xmath0o@xmath1 , though the high - temperature behavior agrees each other .",
    "figure 2 shows magnetization @xmath21 of liv@xmath0o@xmath1 and liv@xmath0o@xmath2 as functions of magnetic field @xmath22 . for both the systems",
    ", @xmath21 increases linearly up to 15 t. at higher fields , @xmath21 of liv@xmath0o@xmath1 turns to increase nonlinearly , and exhibits an inflection point at @xmath23 = 38 t. such a metamagnetic behavior in liv@xmath0o@xmath1 is also reported in the literature  @xcite .",
    "magnetic moment at 45 t is about 1.1 @xmath24 per formula unit ( f.u . ) .",
    "in contrast , @xmath21 of liv@xmath0o@xmath2 increases monotonically up to 40 t with no indication of metamagnetic behavior . the value of @xmath21 at 40 t is less than 0.7 @xmath24/f.u .",
    ", considerably smaller than that of liv@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "figure 3 shows the arrott - plot of the two systems .",
    "the slope of @xmath25 vs. @xmath26 for liv@xmath0o@xmath1 is negative , consistent with the metamagnetic behavior . on the other hand ,",
    "the slope for liv@xmath0o@xmath2 is positive , in a clear contrast to that for liv@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "one can therefore expect that @xmath21 of liv@xmath0o@xmath2 increases monotonically until its saturation value , without metamagnetic behavior even for much higher fields .",
    "in this section , we argue on the possible mechanism for the metamagnetic behavior in liv@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "metamagnetic behavior is usually explained as a spin - flopping process in antiferromagnetic ( afm ) ordered systems .",
    "in contrast , liv@xmath0o@xmath1 does not order magnetically down to the lowest temperature , as is demonstrated by many works including specific heat  @xcite , @xmath11li - nmr  @xcite , muon spin relaxation  @xcite and neutron diffraction  @xcite . hence ,",
    "the metamagnetic behavior observed in liv@xmath0o@xmath1 is not attributed to a spin - flopping .",
    "alternatively , metamagnetic behavior out of a paramagnetic state has been observed in such cases as : ( i ) kondo - lattice systems like ceru@xmath0si@xmath0  @xcite , cecu@xmath27  @xcite or ybcual  @xcite , and ( ii ) itinerant - electron systems close to ferromagnetic ( fm ) order  @xcite like yco@xmath0  @xcite or tibe@xmath0  @xcite .",
    "notably , both the two models , kondo - lattice and nearly - fm metal , have been used to explain the anomalous physical properties of liv@xmath0o@xmath1 .    for kondo - lattice systems ,",
    "the precise mechanism of the metamagnetic behavior has not been clearly understood yet .",
    "nevertheless , it is widely accepted that the metamagnetic behavior accompanies a qualitative change in the @xmath15-electron state . for ceru@xmath0si@xmath0 , where a distinct metamagnetic behavior has been observed at @xmath28 = 7 t  @xcite ,",
    "a drastic change in the magnetic response has been demonstrated by the neutron scattering studies  @xcite ; from strong afm fluctuations at @xmath29 to single - site ( @xmath30-independent ) fluctuations at @xmath31 .",
    "similar change in the magnetic response has also been observed in cecu@xmath27  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the de haas - van alphen effect measurements on ceru@xmath0si@xmath0 have revealed the change in its fermi surface from itinerant at low fields to almost localized @xmath15-electrons at high fields  @xcite .",
    "hence , the high - field states in these compounds are well described by localized @xmath15-electrons with single - site kondo fluctuations .",
    "it is also notable that the magnetization of ce@xmath32(la , y)@xmath13ru@xmath0si@xmath0 at high fields is almost independent of @xmath14 , though the metamagnetic behavior becomes broadened with increasing @xmath14  @xcite .",
    "similar behavior is also observed in ce@xmath32la@xmath13fe@xmath0ge@xmath0  @xcite and yb@xmath32y@xmath13cual  @xcite .",
    "this substitution dependence is well explained by the single - site character of @xmath15-electrons at high fields , since the single - site interactions are insensitive to disorder .",
    "thus , we can conclude that such a localized - electron state at high fields is a common feature in kondo - lattice systems .    here , note the qualitative difference in the magnetization of liv@xmath0o@xmath1 and liv@xmath0o@xmath2 : @xmath21 of liv@xmath0o@xmath2 at 40 t is considerably smaller than that of liv@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "this distinct difference in @xmath21 does not agree with the high - field state expected for kondo - lattice systems .",
    "therefore , the kondo - lattice model is unlikely for liv@xmath0o@xmath1 as far as the mechanism of the metamagnetic behavior is concerned .",
    "instead , this result is likely to suggest that the intersite correlation is still important even at high fields , because intersite correlation should be sensitive to disorder or defects .",
    "this indicates that the metamagnetic behavior is relevant to the evolution of intersite fm correlation .",
    "thus , we turn to the next picture ; itinerant - electron systems close to fm order .    within the itinerant - electron description ,",
    "the curie - weiss susceptibility in liv@xmath0o@xmath1 is attributed to the temperature dependent fm ( @xmath33 ) spin fluctuations , not to localized moments  @xcite . here",
    ", curie constants do not necessarily agree with the effective magnetic moment expected for a free ion , and a negative weiss temperature no longer indicates antiferromagnetic ( afm ) interactions . several nearly - fm metals exhibit metamagnetic behavior as well as a maximum in @xmath7  @xcite .",
    "such examples are yco@xmath0  @xcite , tibe@xmath0  @xcite , and co(s , se)@xmath0  @xcite .",
    "recently , metamagnetic behavior has also been reported in the metallic oxide sr@xmath16ru@xmath0o@xmath34   around @xmath22 = 5 t  @xcite .",
    "it is notable that this compound shows a maximum in @xmath7 and a large @xmath35 100 mj / ru - mol@xmath4k@xmath5 , and is considered to be close to a fm ordering  @xcite .",
    "these features of nearly - fm metals are quite similar to those observed in liv@xmath0o@xmath1 including the metamagnetic behavior .    on the other hand , it has been shown that liv@xmath0o@xmath1 also exhibits quite contrasting behavior to the feature for nearly - fm metals .",
    "for example , neutron scattering experiments by lee _ el al . _ have revealed the presence of afm fluctuations at @xmath36 0.6 @xmath37  @xcite .",
    "in addition , spin - glass ordering has been observed in mg- or zn - doped samples  @xcite .",
    "these observations suggest the presence of strong afm interaction and the effect of the geometrical frustration , the latter of which prevents this system from a long - range afm ordering . in this respect ,",
    "liv@xmath0o@xmath1 has been compared with ( y , sc)mn@xmath0 and @xmath38-mn  @xcite , where the afm order is suppressed by the geometrical frustration , and the resulting fluctuations enhance the electronic specific heat coefficients  @xcite .    it should , however , be stressed that the temperature dependence of @xmath7 of ( y , sc)mn@xmath0 and @xmath38-mn differs qualitatively from that of liv@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "@xmath7 of the formers are almost @xmath18-independent and do not show curie - weiss behavior  @xcite , consistent with the dominant afm ( @xmath39 0 ) fluctuations .",
    "in contrast , @xmath7 as well as the @xmath11li - knight shift @xmath40 of liv@xmath0o@xmath1 show curie weiss behavior , suggesting the importance of the fm ( @xmath41 0 ) fluctuation .",
    "furthermore , the metamagnetic behavior observed in the present study evidences the importance of the fm interaction in this system . from these facts",
    ", we conclude that both the fm ( @xmath41 0 ) and the afm ( @xmath36 0.6 @xmath37 ) interactions are important in liv@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "this is similar to the case in v@xmath17se@xmath42 , where both fm ( @xmath41 0 ) and afm ( @xmath43 ) fluctuations are considered to be enhanced  @xcite .",
    "this model has successfully explained the itinerant afm behavior and the curie - weiss susceptibility of v@xmath17se@xmath42  @xcite .",
    "the presence of two kind of spin - fluctuations in liv@xmath0o@xmath1 has been suggested by the earlier neutron scattering study  @xcite and the scr analysis for the specific heat data  @xcite .",
    "recently , eyert _ et al .",
    "_ have performed first - principles calculations , and have shown that afm state is stable for liv@xmath0o@xmath1 and the energy of fm state is slightly higher  @xcite .",
    "this result is indicative that applying high fields would reduce the energy for the fm state , which results in a metamagnetic transition .",
    "it is notable that the temperature where @xmath7 has a maximum is @xmath44 10 k for tibe@xmath0  @xcite and @xmath45 = 16 k for sr@xmath16ru@xmath0o@xmath34  @xcite , comparable to @xmath45 = 16 k for liv@xmath0o@xmath1 , whereas the field where metamagnetic behavior occurs is @xmath23 = 6 t for tibe@xmath0  @xcite and @xmath23 = 5 t for sr@xmath16ru@xmath0o@xmath34  @xcite , remarkably smaller than @xmath46 38 t for liv@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "this may be a result of competition of the fm and the afm fluctuations in liv@xmath0o@xmath1 below @xmath23 .",
    "we expect that the afm fluctuations are suppressed at around @xmath23 and the fm correlation becomes dominant above @xmath23 . on the other hand",
    ", fm correlation does not appear to develop in liv@xmath0o@xmath2 .",
    "this suggests that the afm interaction is dominant even at high fields in this system .    instead of the itinerant - electron picture mentioned above ,",
    "the possibility of liv@xmath0o@xmath1 as a localized - moment system is not still ruled out .",
    "the value of the spin - lattice relaxation rate 1/@xmath47 of the @xmath48v  @xcite and of the @xmath11li nuclei  @xcite at high temperatures are consistent with those for a localized - moment system .",
    "the evolution of localized electrons has been suggested theoretically by the splitting of the @xmath49 orbital into almost localized @xmath50 and conductive @xmath51 orbitals due to a trigonally distortion in the vo@xmath27 octahedra and the coulomb interactions  @xcite . in this case ,",
    "the most probable explanation for the metamagnetic behavior is the evolution of fm interaction due to the double exchange mechanism . here",
    ", the fm interaction evolves via the hund coupling between local moments and conduction electrons , while afm interaction can also arise via the exchange interaction between local moments  @xcite .",
    "this would also result in the situation where both the fm and the afm interactions are important .",
    "although our results do not clarify whether the @xmath6-electron state in liv@xmath0o@xmath1 is itinerant or localized , the absence of metamagnetic behavior in liv@xmath0o@xmath2 seems to be of particular importance .",
    "the reduced @xmath21 in this system implies that the fm interaction is rapidly reduced by a slight disorder or defects .",
    "this may be a hint for the origin of the fm interaction in liv@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "since the @xmath6-electrons in liv@xmath0o@xmath1 involve degrees of freedom of orbital and charge quanta , orbital and/or charge order would also be suppressed by the geometrical frustration .",
    "this multiply frustrated state can be easily lifted by a small defect .",
    "the fm correlation in liv@xmath0o@xmath1 may be a result of the competition of the multiply frustrated state . to elucidate the electronic state and the mechanism for the evolution of the fm correlation in liv@xmath0o@xmath1 , more systematic experiments as well as theoretical studies should be performed .",
    "we have reported a metamagnetic behavior in liv@xmath0o@xmath1 around @xmath28 = 38 t and absence of metamagnetism in liv@xmath0o@xmath2 up to 40 t. arrot plot of the former shows the characteristic curve for a metamagnetic behavior , while that for the latter has a positive curve .",
    "this implies that metamagnetic behavior would not appear for liv@xmath0o@xmath2 even at much higher fields .",
    "moreover , high - field magnetic moment of this system is significantly smaller from that of liv@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "this qualitative difference in the magnetization of the two samples is of particular importance to consider the mechanism of the metamagnetic behavior .",
    "metamagnetic behavior out of a paramagnetic state has been observed in two cases : kondo - lattice systems and itinerant - electron systems with strong ferromagnetic spin - fluctuations . for the case of kondo - lattice systems ,",
    "the high - field state is described by localized electrons with single - site kondo fluctuations .",
    "consequently , the magnetic moments at high fields are insensitive to a slight disorder or defects for kondo - lattice systems . for the present case , the significant difference in the magnetization of liv@xmath0o@xmath1 and liv@xmath0o@xmath2 does not agree with the local moment state .",
    "the kondo - lattice model is therefore unlikely as far as the mechanism for the metamagnetic behavior is concerned .",
    "instead , these results favor the evolution of intersite ferromagnetic spin - correlation at high fields for the origin of metamagnetic behavior in liv@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "this may lead to the interpretation that liv@xmath0o@xmath1 is a nearly - ferromagnetic metals , as is suggested by fujiwara _",
    "et al . _ from their @xmath11li - nmr experiments",
    "in fact , many itinerant - electron systems with strong ferromagnetic spin - fluctuations exhibit metamagnetic behavior by fields  @xcite . for liv@xmath0o@xmath1 , however , neutron scattering experiments have revealed the presence of antiferromagnetic fluctuations at low temperature  @xcite . from these facts , we conclude that both the ferromagnetic and the antiferromagnetic interactions are important in liv@xmath0o@xmath1 , and the former is strongly enhanced by external fields",
    ".    microscopic origin of the ferromagnetic correlation is unclear .",
    "the qualitative difference in the high - field magnetizations of liv@xmath0o@xmath1 and liv@xmath0o@xmath2 is likely to suggest that the effect of geometrical frustration for spin , orbital , and charge order is relevant to the ferromagnetic interaction .",
    "the other possibility for the ferromagnetic correlation would be the double exchange mechanism .",
