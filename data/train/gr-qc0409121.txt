    "the question of conserving energy - momentum in general relativity ( gr ) always attracted much attention .",
    "one of the reasons is that covariant description of energy - momentum seems to be incompatible with the integral conservation law .",
    "particularly , it is generally believed that no integral conservation law follows from the covariant differential conservation law for the energy - momentum tensor ( emt ) of matter ( i.e. from its covariant divergence being zero ) @xcite .",
    "we shall show that this is not quite right : the nullification of the divergence of material emt yields a sort of integral conservation law , although it is formulated in unusual way .",
    "the _ covariant integral conservation law _ for the material emt will be formulated in terms of path groups introduced earlier for the alternative formulation of gauge theory and gravity ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the formalism of path groups is a group - theoretical version of the mandelstam s path - dependent wave functions formalism and the yang s non - integrable phase factors @xcite .",
    "the resulting form of the conservation law for the material emt is unusual .",
    "it is formulated not directly in the physical space - time @xmath0 but rather in a `` standard flat space - time '' .",
    "the latter is the minkowski space @xmath1 which may be considered as a model of any tangent space to @xmath0 .",
    "the standard space - time @xmath1 is connected with the physical space @xmath0 in a non - holonomical way .",
    "this is used for characterization of points in @xmath0 in terms of paths in @xmath1 .",
    "it has been shown earlier that the equivalence principle ( ep ) for the mechanical law of motion as well as its quantum generalization may be naturally formulated in terms of the ` standard ' space - time @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the material energy - momentum conservation law will be formulated also in terms of @xmath1 and interpreted as ep for energy : gravitational field may be excluded from the formulation of this conservation law .",
    "let us set forth the problem systematically .",
    "in the flat ( minkowski ) space - time , i.e. in the case of null gravity , energy and momentum are described locally by the corresponding emt @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) which satisfies the ` differential conservation law ' @xmath4 where @xmath5 are derivatives in the coordinates @xmath6 of minkowski space ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "the corresponding integral conservation law follows ( see for example @xcite ) from the 4-dimensional gauss theorem @xmath8 where @xmath9 is a 4-dimensional region of space - time , @xmath10 its ( 3-dimensional ) boundary , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are correspondingly elements of 4-volume and of area of the 3-dimensional hypersurface in minkowski space .",
    "it follows from eq .",
    "( [ nulldivergnoncovar ] ) that the integral in the r.h.s . of eq .",
    "( [ gaussfourdimnoncovar ] ) is zero for any @xmath9 .",
    "therefore , the l.h.s . is null for the boundary @xmath10 of an arbitrary 4-volume .",
    "let @xmath9 be a 4-volume swept by some 3-volume @xmath13 during a time interval @xmath14 $ ] .",
    "then the boundary @xmath10 of @xmath9 consists of two space - like hypersurfaces ( ` bottom ' and ` top ' ones ) presenting the 3-volume @xmath13 at the two time moments @xmath15 and @xmath16 , and a time - like ` side ' hypersurface which presents the boundary @xmath17 of @xmath13 in all times between @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "the null value of the l.h.s . of ( [ gaussfourdimnoncovar ] ) is then naturally interpreted as an integral form of the conservation law : the difference between energy - momentum in the volume @xmath13 at times @xmath16 and @xmath15 is equal to the flow of energy - momentum throw the boundary of @xmath13 during the interval @xmath14 $ ] .",

    "denote the coordinates in @xmath0 as @xmath32 , and the derivatives in these coordinates as @xmath33 , @xmath34 .",
    "if the divergence @xmath35 of emt had everywhere null value , the conservation of energy - momentum could be derived in the usual way ( see above ) .",
    "this however is not the case in gr .",
    "einstein equations of gr have the form @xmath36 where the r.h.s .",
    "is proportional to the emt of matter @xmath37 and the l.h.s .",

    "it follows from the so - called bianchi identity that the _ covariant divergence _ ( expressed through the covariant derivatives @xmath38 instead of @xmath39 ) of einstein tensor is zero .",
    "therefore , the same is valid for the emt of matter : @xmath40    no integral energy - momentum conservation law could be derived from the covariant equation ( [ covardiffconserv ] ) with the help of the usual procedure sketched above . to solve the problem ,",
    "einstein introduced a pseudotensor presenting energy - momentum of gravitational field .",
    "one may ( see for example @xcite ) rewrite the covariant differential law ( [ covardiffconserv ] ) in the form @xmath41 where the non - tensor entity @xmath42 ( transforming non - covariantly under change of the coordinate frame ) is the _ pseudotensor of energy - momentum of gravitational field_. eq .",

    "we shall show that an integral conservation law for the material emt @xmath43 does in fact follow from the differential conservation law ( [ covardiffconserv ] ) .",
    "the price paid for this feasibility is that the _ path - dependent forms _ are used in the corresponding integrals instead of the usual local ( point - dependent ) forms .",
    "this reflects the non - holonomic character of the connection between physical space - time @xmath0 and ` standard ' minkowski space - time @xmath1 .",

    "( [ gaussfourdimnoncovar ] ) but for path - dependent forms and covariant derivatives .",
    "the resulting integral conservation law includes only emt of matter ( without gravitational field ) and may be interpreted as the _ extension of ep _ : gravitational field may be excluded from the integral energy - momentum conservation law for matter just as it is excluded from the law of motion .",
    "the key point making this possible is that the covariant derivatives acquire , in the path group formalism , a group - theoretical interpretation as generators of elements of the path group ( generalized translations ) .",

    "formalism of path groups ( see @xcite and references therein ) generalizes the concept of translation onto the case when infinitesimal translations do not commute ( as parallel transports in non - abelian theory or gr do not ) .",
    "non - commutativity of translations forces us , when composing a finite translation from infinitesimal ones , to specify the order of those .",
    "the finite translation is characterized then not only by the difference between the initial and final points , but also by the shape of the curve along which the translation is performed .",
    "the resulting ( generalized ) translation is formalized as a _ path _ , an element of a path group @xmath46 .",
    "mathematically a path is defined as a class of equivalent continuous curves in the corresponding space , with the appropriate definition of equivalence .",

    "@xmath51-paths _ on @xmath1 ( @xmath51-dimensional ordered manifolds ) may be defined recurrently as @xmath52 .",
    "we shall need @xmath51-paths on @xmath1 with @xmath51 up to @xmath53 to generalize 3-dimensional and 4-dimensional integrals .",
    "in any path group @xmath54 the subgroup of closed paths , or loops , exists , @xmath55 .",
    "it contains the curves with the initial and final points coinciding with each other .",
    "in particular , in the group of @xmath51-paths in minkowski space , the subgroup of @xmath51-loops , @xmath56 , is defined .",
    "it contains the curves in @xmath57 which begin and end by the same @xmath58-path .    for each path @xmath59 we shall define the _ shift along the path _ , @xmath60 , specifying the difference between its final and initial points .",

    "closed paths have null shifts : @xmath63 if @xmath64 is a loop in a linear space ( e.g. @xmath65 ) or @xmath66 for a loop in the group space ( @xmath67 ) .    besides ` free ' paths @xmath59 forming a group @xmath68 we shall consider also _ pinned paths _",

    "relation between both types of paths is analogous to the relation between free and pinned vectors .",
    "not going into much details , let us comment on some essential points of the definition of the path groups , illustrating them in case of paths in minkowski space .",
    "the main point is that a path is not an individual curve but a class of equivalent continuous curves .",
    "the equivalence is defined in such a way that the paths form a group .",
    "1 )  the multiplication @xmath71 of continuous curves @xmath72 and @xmath73 ( in any manifold , for example in minkowski space ) is defined as the passage along one of them after the other : @xmath74 ( @xmath75 is necessary to obtain again a continuous curve ) . for this multiplication being associative ( as is necessary for a group ) , each path is characterized by the corresponding curve independently of its parametrization .",
    "this means that the curves are considered equivalent if they differ only by the way of parametrization .",
    "\\2 ) the inversion of a curve @xmath76 is defined as passing the same curve in the opposite direction : @xmath77 .",
    "the multiplication of a path by the inverse path has to give the group unity .",
    "this means that a curve obtained by passing along some set of points and just after this along the same set of points in the opposite direction , is equivalent to the constant ( null ) curve .",
    "the class of all such curves is interpreted as the unity of the path group . to make this more manifest",
    ", one may think that the backward passage of a curve cancels this curve .",
    "the inclusion of such to - and - back - passed curves in the middle of any curve ( as an appendage ) converts the curve in an equivalent one .",
    "\\3 ) if only these two elements of equivalence are used in constructing the equivalence classes , then the resulting classes form the set @xmath70 of _ pinned paths_. the initial and final points of each pinned path are fixed .",
    "the pinned paths are convenient as a technical instrument . in the present paper",
    "we shall formulate the definitions of integrals in terms of pinned paths .",
    "however @xmath70 is not a group but only a _ groupoid_. this means that not any pair of pinned paths may be multiplied : for this being possible , the initial point of one of them has to coincide with the final point of the other . to obtain a group",
    ", we have to go over to the _ free paths _ or simply _ paths_. for this end",
    "we need one more element of equivalence : two curves are considered equivalent if they differ by a general shift , @xmath78 ( by a right shift in the case of curves on a group , @xmath79 ) .",
    "each path @xmath46 is defined as a class of equivalent curves and may be presented by any of these curves .",
    "we shall write in this case @xmath80 or @xmath81 for paths on a group . if a path @xmath46 and some point @xmath82 ( or @xmath83 in case of the path on a group ) are given , the pinned path @xmath69 ( correspondingly @xmath84 ) starting in this point is evidently determined .",
    "applying path groups in gr has important special features as compared to their application in gauge theory without gravity .",
    "the reason is that the actual ( physical ) space - time without gravity is minkowski space @xmath1 , hence path groups may be defined on the physical space - time itself : @xmath47 , @xmath85 , etc . with non - zero gravitational field , the actual ( physical ) space - time @xmath0 is pseudo - riemannian and has generally no group structure .",
    "no natural concept of general shift ( such as right shift of a group space ) can be defined on such @xmath0 , and the group of paths on @xmath0 can not be defined .",
    "it happens however that the group @xmath47 of paths on minkowski space may do work also in gr .",
    "the action of @xmath68 is defined in this case not in the space - time @xmath0 , but in the fiber bundle @xmath86 of orthonormal local frames ( bases of tangent spaces ) over @xmath0 .",
    "this is possible because a tangent space to any point of @xmath0 has the structure of minkowski space @xmath1 ( note that this is just what underlines einstein s ep ) . as a result",
    ", a sort of _ non - holonomic _ correspondence between curves in @xmath0 and paths in @xmath1 ( i.e. elements of @xmath68 ) may be naturally defined .",
    "this correspondence has been used in @xcite for formulating ep and its quantum generalization in terms of the path group @xmath87 .",
    "the paths ( in @xmath1 ) associated ( in non - holonomic way ) with the curves in @xmath0 are called there _ flat models _ of these curves .",
    "ep have an elegant formulation in these terms : the classical particles move ( in @xmath0 ) along the trajectories which have straight lines ( in @xmath1 ) as their flat models .    instead of the correspondence between curves in @xmath0 and their flat models in @xmath1",
    "we shall make use of an equivalent machinery : the action of the path group @xmath47 on the fiber bundle @xmath86 of orthonormal local frames over @xmath0 .",

    "this is the integral energy - momentum conservation law but formulated in terms of 3-paths ( ordered volumes ) instead of usual volumes .",
    "however , it can easily be seen that the integral over an ordered space - like volume in this construction does not depend of its ordering . to show this",
    ", we may form a 3-path @xmath179 with the null side hypersurface and bottom and top differing only by ordering ( therefore covering the same volume ) .",
    "then it follows from the conservation law that the integrals over bottom and top are equal , hence the volume integral does not depend on the ordering .",
    "there is one more peculiarity of the conservation law ( [ covaremtint ] ) as compared with the flat - space - time one .",
    "the geometric elements ( past and future volumes and side hypersurface ) are described in ( [ covaremtint ] ) in terms of the ` standard ' minkowski space - time @xmath1 which is connected with the physical space - time @xmath0 in an non - holonomic way . in particular , a continuous ( solid ) volume in @xmath1 corresponds in general case to a ` dispersed volume ' in @xmath0 . such a ` volume ' consists of distinct infinitesimal volume elements with infinitesimal spaces between them ( or quite the reverse , infinitesimally intersecting with each other ) .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] where the two - dimensional analogy is presented .",
    "an example of parallel paths in @xmath1 is drawn in the left part of the figure . in @xmath0",
    "( right part ) these paths correspond to a family of geodesics which are parallel at the beginning but diverge later .",
    "the small volumes filling the spaces between the parallel paths in @xmath1 , correspond in @xmath0 to small volumes of the same size , but now they do not fill the spaces between the geodesics .",
    "( [ gravthreefourstokes ] ) describes the conservation of the energy - momentum of matter , without energy - momentum of the gravitational field . in this sense",
    "it extends the _ equivalence principle _ from the law of motion to the energy - momentum conservation law : energy - momentum of matter alone is conserved , gravitational field is excluded from this conservation law .",
    "this can not be done in terms of usual coordinate frames , but is naturally described by paths in subsidiary minkowski space : elements of a dispersed volume are then brought together in the solid volume .    if the paths in the 4-integral ( [ covarfourint ] ) are direct lines ( as in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , but not necessarily parallel ) describing the parts of the matter moving along geodesics , then the conservation law is interpreted as the conservation of the rest energy of matter .",
    "it is commonly believed that no integral conservation law follows from the fact that the covariant derivative of the energy - momentum tensor ( emt ) of matter is zero in general relativity ( [ covardiffconserv ] ) .",
    "we showed above that this is wrong .",
    "nullification of covariant derivative of emt leads to the integral conservation law for energy - momentum of matter ( without energy - momentum of gravitational field ) .",
    "this may be interpreted as an _ equivalence principle for energy_.    mathematically this conservation law is expressed in terms of the standard minkowski space - time @xmath1 connected with the physical space - time @xmath0 in a non - holonomic way .",
    "path groups provide an adequate mathematical formalism for dealing with @xmath1 and @xmath0 .",
    "fiber bundle @xmath86 of orthonormal local frames ( having @xmath0 as its base ) is essentially used in this formalism .",
    "previously the equivalence principle ( claiming that the material points move along geodesics ) as well as its quantum generalization were formulated in terms of ` standard ' minkowskian space - time @xmath1 and group @xmath87 of paths in @xmath1 @xcite",
    ".    one of the consequences of the non - holonomic connection between @xmath1 and @xmath0 is that a solid volume in @xmath1 ( appearing in the discussed conservation law ) corresponds to a dispersed volume in @xmath0 .",
    "this feature is the reason why the energy conservation law formulated above in terms of the paths in the ` standard ' space - time @xmath1 can not be expressed directly in terms of usual coordinates in the physical space - time @xmath0 .",
    "the physical interpretation of this unusual property of energy in its relation to volume may be connected with the phenomenon of dark matter and serve as an explanation of this phenomenon .",
    "this will be discussed in a separate paper .",
