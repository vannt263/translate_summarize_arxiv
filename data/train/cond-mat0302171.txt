    "numerical recipes based on the discretization of the feynman - ka formula@xcite are the most successful ways to account for the quantum contributions in equilibrium statistical simulations for many - body systems .",
    "the feynman - ka formula represents the density matrix and the partition function of a canonical quantum system as an infinite dimensional stochastic integral of a brownian bridge functional.@xcite this stochastic integral is then approximated by a sequence of finite dimensional integrals , which in turn are evaluated by monte carlo techniques . the random series implementations,@xcite which lead to some of the most effective discretization techniques , utilize the ito - nisio theorem@xcite to construct the brownian bridge in the feynman - ka formula .",
    "there are two discretization techniques of practical importance that can be derived from a given random series representation : the partial averaging@xcite and the reweighted methods.@xcite as a direct method , the partial averaging ( pa ) technique features many desirable properties , as for instance ( i ) good behavior at low temperature ( avoiding the so - called `` classical collapse''),@xcite ( ii ) convergence for a wide class of potentials , including those that have negative coulombic singularities,@xcite and ( iii ) favorable asymptotic convergence of up to @xmath3 for smooth enough potentials.@xcite    however , a major concern in the practical applications of the feynman - ka formula is the asymptotic rate of convergence as measured against the number of variables used to parameterize the paths @xmath4 as well as the computational time necessary to evaluate the various quantities involved . in this respect ,",
    "the main disadvantage of the partial averaging method is that it involves the gaussian transform of the potential .",
    "this makes the pa technique hard to implement if the gaussian transform is not analytically known .",
    "it has been recently recognized that there is an indirect application of the partial averaging method.@xcite more precisely , since the properties of the partial averaging method are mathematically well understood , one may try and devise methods that ( asymptotically ) simulate the effect of partial averaging , with the hope of capturing at least some of its desirable features .",
    "as such , the reweighted ( rw ) random series techniques , which will be rigorously defined in the following section , are designed to achieve superior asymptotic convergence by simulating the partial averaging approach . by construction , the reweighted techniques do not involve any modifications of the physical potential .",
    "rather , they are based on some specialized constructions of the brownian bridge that enters the feynman - ka formula .",
    "this makes the rw techniques straightforward to implement yet , for any given series representation , there are reweighted techniques that achieve an asymptotic convergence better than that of the corresponding partial averaging method .",
    "as opposed to the partial averaging method , the reweighted techniques are not uniquely defined by the random series representation .",
    "in fact , we talk about a family of methods called reweighted techniques that are derived from a given random series representation .",
    "they share the property that their asymptotic convergence is characterized by the same convergence theorems .",
    "then , these theorems can be used to design reweighted methods having improved asymptotic behavior . in this article ,",
    "i use the aforementioned convergence theorems to design two special reweighted techniques based on the lvy - ciesielski and wiener - fourier series , respectively . the technique based on the lvy - ciesielski representation",
    "will be shown to have @xmath0 asymptotic convergence for kato - class potentials that have first order sobolev derivatives.@xcite i also conjecture that the asymptotic rate of convergence may reach @xmath1 for the potentials that have second order sobolev derivatives .",
    "quite important , the method preserves the favorable @xmath2 scaling for the time necessary to compute a path at a given discretization point . the technique based on the wiener - fourier series",
    "is proven to have @xmath1 asymptotic convergence for potentials that have second order sobolev derivatives .",
    "however , the convergence constant has more favorable dependence with the inverse temperature as compared to the partial averaging convergence constant .",
    "moreover , the convergence constant does not depend upon the second order derivatives and i speculate that the cubic asymptotic convergence extends to the class of potentials that have first order sobolev derivatives only .",
    "the special treatment received by the wiener - fourier series is motivated by the fact that it is the optimal series representation of the brownian bridge with regard to the minimization of the number of variables used to parameterize the paths.@xcite    in this paper , our primary interest is the development of the mathematical ideas lying behind the reweighted techniques . as such , the two lvy - ciesielski and wiener - fourier reweighted techniques developed in the paper may still not be the optimal ones .",
    "rather , they serve as examples demonstrating that there is a large class of methods which have cubic convergence for sufficiently smooth potentials and which are direct methods in the sense that they do not use `` effective potentials '' for their implementation .",
    "the content of the article is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "i give a short review of the random series and the partial averaging methods with the purpose of establishing the notation .",
    "next , i define the reweighted methods and justify the mathematical relevance of the definition . in the first part of section  iii ,",
    "i provide a description of the main class of potentials for which the reweighted method is expected to converge to the correct feynman - ka result . in the second part of the same section , i state",
    "some important convergence theorems , which are valid for all series representations . in section",
    "iv , i utilize the results of section  iii to design two specific reweighted methods based on the lvy - ciesielski and wiener - fourier series , respectively .",
    "their convergence properties are reinforced by numerical studies of a simple harmonic oscillator .",

    "<S> i prove several convergence results valid for all series representations and then i specialize the results for the lvy - ciesielski and wiener - fourier series . </S>",
    "<S> as opposed to the partial averaging method on which they are based , the reweighted techniques do not involve any modification of the physical potential . </S>",
    "<S> rather , the underlying idea is to develop some specialized constructions of the brownian bridge that enters the feynman - ka formula , so as to simulate the partial averaging effect . for the lvy - ciesielski series representation , </S>",
    "<S> i develop a reweighted technique which has @xmath0 convergence for potentials having first order sobolev derivatives . </S>",
    "<S> it is suggested that the asymptotic convergence may reach @xmath1 for potentials having second order sobolev derivatives . </S>",
    "<S> the method preserves the favorable @xmath2 scaling for the time necessary to compute a path at a given discretization point . for the wiener - fourier series representation , the particular reweighted method designed in the present article </S>",
    "<S> is shown to have @xmath3 convergence if the potential has second order sobolev derivatives . </S>",
    "<S> the convergence constant has superior dependence with the inverse temperature as compared to the partial averaging method for the same series . because the expression of the convergence constant does not actually involve the second order derivatives of the potential , it is conjectured that the @xmath1 convergence extends to the potentials having first order sobolev derivatives only . </S>"
