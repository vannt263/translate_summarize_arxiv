    "graphene monolayers and bilayers are recently discovered two - dimensional gapless semimetals .",
    "the dirac spectrum of excitations in monolayer graphene gives rise to a number of novel transport properties , including anomalous quantized hall conductance with plateaus at @xmath0 in multi - terminal samples.@xcite bilayer graphene has a quadratic , electron - hole - symmetric excitation spectrum , leading to quantized hall conductance values @xmath1.@xcite both monolayer and bilayer graphene have a zeroth landau level , located at the charge neutrality point ( cnp ) , which is eightfold degenerate in bilayers and fourfold degenerate in monolayers .",
    "other landau levels are all fourfold degenerate in both types of graphene.@xcite the novel transport signatures not only reflect this underlying band structure , but serve as an experimental tool for identifying the number of layers and characterizing sample quality.@xcite    in recent work on graphene , two - terminal magnetoconductance has emerged as one of the main tools of sample characterization.@xcite while a two - terminal measurement is not as straightforward to interpret as the corresponding multi - terminal measurement@xcite , it is the simplest to perform and may be the only measurement possible , for instance with very small samples .",
    "the presence of non - zero longitudinal conductivity causes quantum hall plateaus measured in a two - terminal configuration to not be as well quantized as in multiprobe measurement.@xcite as discussed in detail below , plateaus exhibit a characteristic n - shaped distortion arising from the finite longitudinal conductivity that depends on device geometry .    in this article , we systematically examine two - terminal conductance in the qh regime for monolayer and bilayer graphene for a variety of sample aspect ratios ( table i ) .",
    "we especially focus on the features that can help to distinguish monolayer and bilayer graphene : the conductance extrema in the n - shaped distortions of the quantum hall plateaus and at the cnp .",
    "we find that these features depend both on the sample aspect ratio and the number of graphene layers .",
    "results are compared to recent theory@xcite , in which two - terminal conductance for arbitrary shape is characterized by a single parameter @xmath2 , the effective device aspect ratio ( @xmath3 for rectangular samples , where @xmath4 is the length or distance between contacts , and @xmath5 is the device width ) .",

    "[ ] , the positions of conductance extrema on the distorted plateaus were linked to incompressible densities . here",
    "we find that this relation can be used to distinguish monolayer and bilayer graphene devices even when the distortions of the plateaus are strong .",
    "the analysis of rectangular two - terminal samples is extended to a sample with asymmetric contacts , extracting an effective sample aspect ratio via conformal mapping .",
    "best - fit values of the aspect ratio , @xmath6 , obtained by fitting the theory to the experimental data , are compared to the measured sample aspect ratio , @xmath7 .",
    "agreement is generally good , but not uniformly so .",
    "we speculate on possible causes of these discrepancies , including inhomogeneous contact resistance , electron and hole puddles , and contributions of transport along _ p - n _ interfaces .",
    "representative theoretical plots of two - terminal conductance for monolayer , bilayer , and gapped bilayer graphene as a function of filling factor , @xmath8 , are shown in fig .  1 .",
    "for both monolayers and bilayers , the absence of an energy gap between the conduction and valence bands gives rise to a zero energy landau level ( ll)@xcite , which can either increase or decrease the two - terminal conductance around the charge neutrality point , depending on the aspect ratio of the sample .",
    "the eightfold degeneracy of the zero - energy ll in bilayer graphene@xcite enhances the size of this feature relative to monolayer graphene .",
    "a gap in the spectrum of bilayer graphene opens when the on - site energy in one layer differs from the on - site energy in the other.@xcite this may result , for instance , from asymmetric chemical doping@xcite or electrostatic gating.@xcite the gap splits the zero - energy ll , suppressing conductance at the cnp .",
    "the qualitative effect of a gap in the bilayer spectrum can be seen in fig .  1 by comparing the gapped case [ fig .",
    "1(c ) ] , which always has a zero of conductance at @xmath9 , to the gapless cases [ figs .",
    "1(a , b ) ] , which has a non - zero value of conductance at @xmath9 .",
    "also illustrated in fig .",
    "1 is how the aspect ratio of the sample affects the two - terminal conductance near quantum hall plateaus for all three spectrum types .",
    "finite longitudinal conductivity leads to n - shaped distortions of the plateaus,@xcite which are of opposite signs for aspect ratios @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "note , however , that the extrema of conductance  minima for @xmath10 and maxima for @xmath11are aligned with the plateaus centers , which coincide with the incompressible density values ( different for monolayers and bilayers ) . distorted plateaus thus remain useful for characterizing the number of layers and density .",
    "the back - gate dependence of conductance for the five samples reported are most similar to those in figs .",
    "1(a , b ) , indicating that these samples are single layers and gapless bilayers only ( see table 1 ) .",
    "we use the model of ref .",
    "[ ] to fit the conductance data treating the aspect ratio as a fit parameter . in doing so ,",
    "our presumption is that the visible dimensions of the sample may not reflect the actual pattern of current flow .",
    "since the conductance problem for a sample of any shape can be reduced to that of an effective rectangle via a conformal mapping @xcite , which depends on the sample shape but _ not _ on the conductivity tensor , the rectangular geometry is universal for two - terminal conductance",
    ". thus the model of a conducting rectangle with an unspecified aspect ratio is suitable for describing systems in which current pattern is not precisely known .",
    "graphene devices were fabricated by mechanically exfoliating highly oriented pyrolytic graphite@xcite onto a @xmath12 si wafer capped with @xmath13 of @xmath14 .",
    "potential single and bilayer graphene flakes were identified by optical microscopy .",

    "differential conductance @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the current and @xmath22 the source - drain voltage , was measured using a current bias ( @xmath21 chosen to keep @xmath23 ) and standard lock - in technique at a frequency of 93hz .",
    "all samples show @xmath24 characteristics of high - quality single - layer and bilayer graphene@xcite : a cnp positioned at back - gate voltage @xmath25 and a large change in @xmath26 ( in excess of @xmath27 ) over the @xmath28 range of @xmath29 .",

    "the observed features in @xmath26 for samples a1 and a2 can be compared to theory@xcite for two - terminal quantum hall conductance , which uses a model of a conducting rectangle @xmath53 with a spatially uniform conductivity .",

    "the current - density distribution for a rectangular sample with an arbitrary aspect ratio is found analytically by conformal mapping ( see refs . [ ] ) . the current density",

    "the best - fit aspect ratio , @xmath58 , differs considerably from the measured value , @xmath31 . for sample a1 ,",
    "the best fit gives the landau level broadening parameter @xmath59 .",
    "this theoretical curve ( @xmath60 ) reproduces the essential features of the data : local maxima align with the filling factors @xmath61 ... , and @xmath26 exhibits a dip at the cnp .",
    "the alignment of conductance minima with densities corresponding to the integer filling factors as well as a peak at the cnp observed for sample a2 are consistent with theoretical predictions for a short , wide monolayer graphene sample .",
    "as illustrated in fig .",
    "2(b ) , the best - fit aspect ratio @xmath62 agrees well with the measured @xmath7 for sample a2 .",
    "we observe that the size of peaks and dips in fig .",
    "2(a , b ) increases for higher ll . in contrast , theory@xcite predicts that peaks and dips at @xmath63 lls are all roughly the same . this discrepancy may reflect the inapplicability of the two - phase model approach of ref .",
    "[ ] , which underlies the semicircle law obtained in this work , to higher lls . indeed , because for dirac particles the spacing between lls decreases at higher energies as an inverse square root of the level number , one may expect mixing between non - nearest lls to increase at high energies .",
    "such mixing can lead to the longitudinal conductivity values in excess of those of ref .",
    "[ ] , which only considers mixing between nearest lls ( see the discussion in ref .",
    "[ ] ) .    to take these effects into account , we extend the model of ref . [ ] by assuming that the contribution of the @xmath64 ll to the conductivity tensor in monolayer graphene is described by a modified semicircle (  elliptic \" ) law , [ eq : modified ] _ n_xx^2+a_n^2 ( _ n_xy-_xy , n^0)(_n _ xy-_xy , n^0)=0 , where @xmath65 and @xmath66 are the effective longitudinal and hall conductivities , @xmath67 and @xmath68 are the quantized hall conductivities at the neighboring plateaus . here",
    "@xmath69 and @xmath70 are neighboring ll indices , related by @xmath71 ( except the doubly degenerate @xmath8 = 0 ll for the bilayer , in which case @xmath72 and @xmath73 ) .",
    "the @xmath74 account for departures from the semicircle law .",
    "we take @xmath75 for @xmath76 , and @xmath77 for other lls , consistent with previous observations.@xcite",
    "the black curve in fig .",
    "3 shows measured @xmath30 for sample b1 ( @xmath78 ) at @xmath79 t and @xmath80k .",
    "this sample has two features indicating that it is a bilayer sample : plateaus in conductance appearing near 4 , 8 , 12 and @xmath81 , and a conductance maximum at the cnp whose relative size is much larger then those at higher lls .",
    "the conductance values at the plateaus @xmath82 here are lower than the expected @xmath83 for a bilayer sample , falling to @xmath84 on the electron ( hole ) side of the cnp .",
    "the peak value in conductance at @xmath9 ( @xmath85 ) is @xmath86 . at higher filling factors , the plateaus exhibit two different behaviors , showing a flat plateau at @xmath87 and a plateau followed by a dip at @xmath88 .",
    "the small dips align with the filling factors @xmath89 for @xmath90 ( see inset of fig .",
    "3 ) , using @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "theoretical @xmath26 curves for aspect ratios @xmath78 ( dashed blue curve ) and @xmath93 ( solid red curve ) are shown in fig .",
    "theoretical @xmath30 curves for these two aspect ratios are similar at high density , but differ for @xmath9 : the curve for @xmath78 has a dip in conductance at the cnp while the best - fit curve ( @xmath93 ) has a peak , similar to the experimental curve .",
    "the curve for @xmath93 also agrees better with experiment at higher densities .        in some cases the quantized conductance values",
    "are found to be quite different from the expected quantized values , as demonstrated in fig .  4 for sample b2 ( @xmath48 ) .",
    "in this sample , @xmath26 reaches a maximum of @xmath94 at the cnp , with adjacent minima of @xmath86 .",
    "away from the cnp , conductance plateaus appear at values of @xmath95 and @xmath96 , neither of which are near expected values for monolayer or bilayer graphene .",
    "since there are no strong peaks or dips in @xmath26 away from charge neutrality , as is expected for a device with a @xmath97 , it is difficult to determine the number of layers from the location of the conductance extrema .",
    "there are two conductance features , however , that suggest the sample is gapless bilayer graphene .",
    "first , the peak at @xmath9 is much more pronounced than any other peak in the conductance .",
    "second , the spacing in @xmath28 between the two lowest lls is twice as large as the spacing between any other two successive lls ( in fig .  4 , @xmath98 ) .",
    "both features arise in bilayers as a result of the zero - energy ll being eightfold degenerate , twice as much as all other bilayer lls and the zero - energy ll in single layer graphene.@xcite the theoretical prediction , using @xmath99 ( solid red line ) and @xmath48 ( dashed blue line ) , for the bilayer sample b2 are shown in fig .  4 .",
    "in this section we extend the comparison of theory and experiment to a non - rectangular device , sample c , shown schematically in the inset of fig .",
    "the measured two - terminal conductance of sample c ( black curve in fig .  5 ) has properties very similar to those expected for a square monolayer sample : around the cnp the conductance is nearly flat with value close to @xmath33 , monotonically increasing on the electron and hole sides at filling factors @xmath100 .",
    "theoretical curve shown in fig.5 is obtained from the conducting rectangle model using a best - fit effective aspect ratio @xmath101 and the ll broadening parameter @xmath102 .",
    "this choice of parameters yields particularly good agreement for @xmath103 . at higher fillings ,",
    "the plateaus are washed out , suggesting that the ll broadening is stronger for lls @xmath104 .",
    "it is interesting to compare the best - fit value @xmath6 to an effective aspect ratio , obtained from conformal mapping of sample c to a rectangle . as discussed below , this",
    "conformal mapping can be constructed directly , owing to the relatively simple geometry of sample c. the effective aspect ratio obtained in this way is @xmath105 , which is consistent with the best - fit value .    , width=192 ]    before we proceed to construct the conformal mapping we note that the geometry of sample c , pictured in fig .",
    "6 , is that of a polygon . in principle , any polygon can be mapped onto the upper half - plane by inverting a schwarz - christoffel mapping.@xcite however , since this mapping is defined by a contour integral , the inverse mapping can only be found numerically . in order to circumvent this difficulty , two approximations are employed below , allowing the desired mapping to be constructed as a composition of a few simple mappings .    the steps involved in this construction are illustrated in fig .",
    "first , the rectangular shape in fig.6 is replaced by a semi - infinite strip shown in fig .",
    "this approximation should not significantly affect the conductance , as the current flows mostly in the region between contacts 1 - 2 and 3 - 4 .",
    "without loss of generality we set the length scale @xmath106 .    , eq .",
    "( [ eq : crossratio ] ) , and evaluate the effective aspect ratio , eq .",
    "( [ eq : xi_eff]).,width=312 ]    our next step is to straighten out the contact 3 - 5 - 6 - 4 . for that , let us consider an auxiliary mapping that maps the upper @xmath107 plane onto the upper @xmath108 plane with a removed rectangle  @xcite : [ eq : map1 ] -ia=_0^ ( ) ^1/2 d. we choose the parameter @xmath109 to be equal [ eq : a ] a= _ 0 ^ 1 ( ) ^1/2 d0.60 , so that the removed rectangle has vertices [ c ] _",
    "3,4=a , _ 5,6=a+ia .",
    "these points correspond to the points @xmath110 , @xmath111 in the @xmath107 plane .",
    "the value of @xmath109 ensures that the edge of the sample on the @xmath112 axis remains on the @xmath112 axis under the mapping ( [ eq : map1 ] ) .",
    "the distance between points @xmath113 and @xmath114 plane equals @xmath109 , as follows from eq .",
    "( [ eq : map1 ] ) and the identity [ eq : equality ] _",
    "1^ | |^1/2 d= _ 0 ^ 1 ( ) ^1/2 d , which can be proved by making the change of variables , @xmath115 in the integral in the left - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : equality ] ) , and @xmath116 in the integral in the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : equality ] ) .",
    "the removed rectangle has aspect ratio equal to 2 , the same as that for the contact 3 - 5 - 6 - 4 , however , their dimensions differ by a factor of @xmath109 . scaling and shifting both @xmath108 in @xmath107 , [ eq : ztildez ] = a(z-5 ) ,",
    "= a(w-5 ) , we obtain the required mapping which straightens out the contact 3 - 5 - 6 - 4 .",
    "the second approximation is necessary because the mapping ( [ eq : map1 ] ) ,  ( [ eq : ztildez ] ) , while straightening the segments 3 - 5 - 6 - 4 , distorts the rest of the boundary .",
    "we notice , however , that sufficiently far from the contact 3 - 5 - 6 - 4 the mapping ( [ eq : map1 ] ) is close to the identity : [ eq : z = w ] z(w1)=w+o(1/w ) , |z-5|1 .",
    "this property and the relatively small size of the segments 3 - 5 - 6 - 4 compared to the strip width guarantees that the distortion is small .",
    "this is shown schematically in fig .",
    "7(b ) , where the curved grey polygon represents the actual image of the sample , with the deviation of its boundary from the strip of the same asymptotic width ( shown in red and exaggerated for clarity ) .",
    "the deviation is indeed small : by investigating the mapping ( [ eq : map1 ] ) ,  ( [ eq : ztildez ] ) numerically we found that the boundary is displaced the most at the point 2 which is shifted by approximately @xmath117 away from its original position @xmath118 along the real axis .",
    "this is small compared to the sample width , equal to 6 , which allows us to neglect the displacement of the boundary .",
    "thus we assume that the mapping ( [ eq : map1 ] ) ,  ( [ eq : ztildez ] ) transforms sample c into the semi - infinite strip shown in fig .",
    "7(c ) .    after this approximation",
    "is made , it is straightforward to transform the semi - infinite strip in fig .",
    "7(c ) into the upper half - plane , which can be done by the following mapping , [ eq : map2 ] = cosh . in the @xmath119 plane ,",
    "the contacts are mapped on the real axis , with the end points 1 , 2 , 3 and 4 mapped to @xmath120 , @xmath121 , @xmath122 , @xmath123 . from these values , following the procedure described in ref .",
    "[ ] ( appendix ) , we compute the cross ratio [ eq : crossratio ] _ 1234=-0.64 , and then obtain the aspect ratio from the relations [ eq : xi_eff ] = = ; _ 1234=(1-k^2)/2k , where @xmath124 is the complete elliptic integral of the first kind , and @xmath125 .",
    "this procedure yields the value @xmath126 , identical to that found from the best fit to a conducting rectangle model ( see fig.5 ) .",
    "in summary , we have studied the effect of geometry on the conductance of two - terminal graphene devices in the qh regime , comparing experiment and theory .",
    "the quantized qh plateaus typically exhibit conductance extrema that are stronger for wide , short samples . for non - rectangular samples , the equivalent rectangle approach appears works well .",
    "theoretically , for short , wide samples ( @xmath127 ) the two - terminal conductance a conductance minimum is expected at filling factors where plateaus exist in multiterminal devices , while for long , narrow samples ( @xmath128 ) , a conductance maximum is expected at these filling factors .",
    "along with the behavior at the cnp , these signatures provide a clear way to identify the number of layers in the sample even when the quantization is weak or absent .",
    "we find in the five samples measured that conductance as a function of gate voltage is well described by theory , allowing for a phenomenological landau level broadening , and treating the aspect ratio as a fit parameter . in some samples , however , the best fit aspect ratio differs considerably from the measured aspect ratio of the sample .    what might lead to the discrepancy between some of the measured and fit aspect ratios ?",
    "one source of discrepancy could be that only part of the contact actually injects current .",
    "it might also be that the contacts locally dope the graphene , causing the aspect ratio to appear smaller .",
    "this latter scenario , however , would require that the doping penetrates @xmath129 into the graphene , which is @xmath130 orders of magnitude larger than expected.@xcite another , more interesting possibility could be that the picture of an effective medium characterized by local conduction , on which the argument leading up to the semi - circle relation@xcite is based , may not hold .",
    "this might arise , for instance , from large density fluctuations , giving rise to electron and hole puddles@xcite forming a network of _ p - n _ interfaces along which conduction occurs . in this case",
    ", the effect of the back gate is to alter the percolation properties of this _ p - n _ network .",
    "transport mediated by such states would almost certainly change the conventional picture of local conduction .",
    "further studies are required to clarify the physical mechanism responsible for the observed behavior .",
