    "recently , we proposed the notion of compound control @xcite which captures a salient characteristic feature of biological control .",
    "compound control is a biological way of realizing proper input / output relationship of regulatory dynamics to cope with diverse , complicated and unpredictable environmental changes .",
    "it is paradoxical that the theoretical and/or physical basis of the modeling / simulation paradigm has not been well exploited , in spite of the remarkable success it has attained . for instance , in many papers on intracellular regulations , the traditional michaelis - menten - hill equation in enzymology is extensively used for describing molecular interactions , e.g. , the action of repressors in transcription regulation , or the effect of feedback @xcite@xcite@xcite @xcite@xcite@xcite , without sound justification .",

    "this paper aims to establish a unified framework with solid mathematical grounding and physical plausibility that is able to capture various bio - physical attributes of intracellular regulations .",
    "a significant portion of genes encode enzymes which are involved in metabolic control , another important form of intracellular regulation .",
    "metabolic control is a relatively old subject of bio - chemistry , where allosteric enzymes are the major agents of control .",
    "allosteric enzyme is a macro - molecule that has several binding sites which can bind substrate and ligands .",
    "the binding pattern of ligands changes the conformations of the enzyme , through which the activity of the enzyme for the target reaction is controlled .",
    "quantification of the activity changes of allosteric enzyme has been a central issue in biochemistry since the classical monod - wyman - changeux model was first proposed @xcite@xcite . since then , various theoretical and experimental methods have been used to predict the conformation changes due to substrate binding and modification by ligands @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "the regulatory mechanism of allosteric enzymes is in some sense similar to that of operons , in spite of the obvious functional and structural differences between them .",
    "both of them are controlled by interactions between binding sites ( catalytic sites for metabolic cases and _ cis_-regulatory elements for genetic cases ) and binding factors ( ligands and substrate in the metabolic case and transcription factors in the genetic case ) . in the metabolic case ,",
    "interactions take place between proteins , while in the genetic case they take place between protein and dna .",
    "it is interesting that although the allosteric protein is a player in both regulations , it plays totally different roles . in the metabolic control , it is controlled by ligands , while in the genetic control it acts as transcription factors to control genes .",
    "the protein / protein interactions of metabolic regulation and protein / dna interactions in transcription control are weak and essentially reversible , and they share many properties .",
    "in fact , equilibrium statistical mechanics is used to quantify both metabolic regulation @xcite and genetic regulation @xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "if we view the binding / unbinding processes taking place between binding sites and binding factors in both cases as a common stochastic process , it suggests a common theoretical framework to deal with metabolic and genetic regulations in a unified way .    along this line",
    ", we propose a common theoretical framework for describing biological regulators of metabolic and genetic regulations to facillitate quantitative descriptions of intracellular bio - chemical processes .",
    "the core of our approach is to describe protein / protein and protein / dna interactions with a common markov process focusing on the behavior of a single molecule rather than a population of molecules .",
    "this viewpoint enables us to describe phenomena with a finite state markov process , which greatly simplifies the argument by avoiding the difficulties associated with infinite dimensionality @xcite .",
    "all the quantification features associated with various complicated physical and biological phenomena can then be condensed into transition probabilities .",
    "we introduce a new notion of probability flow that offers a new insight into the stationary distribution of the markov process .",
    "the stationary equation is regarded as representing the conservation of probability flows at each node .",
    "it is closely related to the wegscheider condition derived a century ago .",
    "based on the notion of probability flow , we derive a representation of the stationary probability distribution , which leads to a unified quantitative form for the general biological regulator .",
    "our method of computing the stationary probability distribution dramatically simplifies the classical king and altman method @xcite , which is used for computing the stationary distribution of chemical processes .",
    "it is expected to yield a new computational tool for operon regulation that can deal with the increasing complexity of operons @xcite .",
    "metabolic and genetic controls have been investigated relatively independently because of their apparent large differences in modality .",
    "therefore , there have been few studies dealing with systems that combine metabolic and genetic regulations @xcite . the unified framework described in this paper",
    "will enhance our understanding of intracellular biochemical processes .    in the next section ,",

    "we introduce the notion of probability flow and explain its relevance to the stationary distribution .",
    "sections [ sec4 ] and [ sec5 ] deal with the single loop case and introduce the wegscheider condition , which guarantees that the probability flow vanishes .",
    "section [ sec6 ] generalizes the results of the preceding section to multi - loop cases .",
    "section [ sec7 ] discusses the meaning of transition probabilities to deduce biologically meaningful representations of biological regulations .",
    "the main stage of genetic control is transcription regulation whose fundamental mechanism is to change the transcription rate of the operon via binding / unbinding of transcription factors to and from their _ cis_-regulatory elements .",
    "the main agent of metabolic control is the allosteric enzyme that determine the rate of the target chemical reaction via binding / unbinding of substrate and ligands .",
    "the fundamental common feature of both regulations lies in the molecular interaction between sites of the macro - molecule and molecular binding factors that work through binding / unbinding processes ( see table  [ table:1 ] ) .",

    "we assume that the macro - molecule , which is the main agent of the regulation , has @xmath0 binding sites ( bs ) , each of which can bind some of @xmath1 ligands with different affinities that depend on the binding patterns of sites . instead of the ligand , we use the word _ binding factors _ ( bf ) to emphasize the bilateral symmetry of sites to be bound and factors to bind .",

    "since we have the empty state @xmath12 , the total number of states is @xmath13 .    the state of the regulator changes as its binding pattern changes , i.e. , as bfs bind to and dissociate from bss .",

    "the stationary probability distribution of the reduced diagram is identical to that of the original diagram .",
    "we derived a purely graphical method of computing the stationary probability distribution based on the notions of probability flow and modifiers .",
    "we derived a simple equation for computing the probability flow .",
    "our method dramatically simplifies the classical king and altman method @xcite .",
    "our result suggests that there are two kinds of stationary probability distributions : the one which satisfies the detailed balance , and one which does not .",
    "the former class is characterized by zero probability flow , the latter by non - zero probability flows . in the latter case ,",
    "the probability distribution is fixed , but continuous flows of probability exist in loops , which perhaps reflects a sort of thermal irreversibility of molecular interactions .",
    "exploitation of the bio - chemical characterization of the probability flow is an interesting issue of theoretical biology .",
    "the theoretical framework developed in this paper is based on the observation that the intracellular regulations are embedded in a homogeneous computational medium of molecular interactions .",
    "this view is not entirely new , but no serious attempt has been made so far to mathematically formulate it , within the best of our knowledge .",
    "a finite markov process model proposed in this paper captures some essential features of the computational medium and explains the versatility , evolvability and flexibility of the intracellular regulations and various signal transductions .",
    "it offers a potential capability to deal with systems in which metabolism and gene expressions are linked and integrated together .",
