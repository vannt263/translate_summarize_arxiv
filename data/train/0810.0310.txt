    "a graph @xmath0 is _ representable _ if there exists a word @xmath1 over the alphabet @xmath2 such that letters @xmath3 and @xmath4 alternate in @xmath1 if and only if @xmath5 for each @xmath6 .",
    "it is @xmath7-representable if each letter appears exactly @xmath7 times .",
    "the notion of representable ( directed ) graphs was introduced in  @xcite to obtain asymptotic bounds on the _ free spectrum _ of the widely - studied _ perkins semigroup _ which has played central role in semigroup theory since 1960 , particularly as a source of examples and counterexamples . in @xcite , the only paper solely dedicated to the study of representable graphs , numerous properties of representable graphs are derived and numerous types of representable and",
    "non - representable graphs are pinpointed .",
    "still , large gaps of knowledge of these graphs have remained , and the purpose of this paper is to address them .",
    "we address the three most fundamental issues about representable graphs :    * are there alternative representations of these graphs that aid in reasoning about their properties ? * which types of graphs are representable and which ones are not ? and , * how large words can be needed to represent representable graphs ?",
    "these can be viewed as some of the most basic questions of any graph class .",
    "we make progress on each of these .",
    "we characterize representable graphs in terms of orientability .",
    "the edges can be directed so as to yield a directed graphs satisfying a property that we call _ semi - transitivity_. it properly generalizes the transitivity property of comparability graphs , constraining the subgraphs induced by certain types of cycles .",
    "the definition and the characterization is given in section 3 .",
    "this formulation allows us to reason fairly easily about the types of graphs that are representable .",
    "we show that the class of representable graphs captures quite involved properties . in particular ,",
    "all 3-colorable graphs are representable .",
    "this resolves a conjecture of @xcite regarding the petersen graph , showing that it is representable .",
    "we actually give an explicit construction to show that it is 3-representable .",
    "the result also properly captures all the previously known classes of representable graphs : outerplanar , prisms , and comparability graphs . on the negative side ,",
    "we answer an open question of @xcite by presenting a non - representable graphs all of whose induced neighborhoods are comparability graphs .",
    "finally , we show that any representable graph is @xmath9-representable , again utilizing the semi - transitive orientability .",
    "previously , no non - trivial upper bound was known on the representation number , which is the smallest value @xmath7 such that the given graph is @xmath7-representable .",
    "this result implies that problem of deciding whether a given graph is representable is contained in np . this bound on the representation number is tight up to a constant factor , as we construct graphs with representation number @xmath10 .",
    "we also show that deciding if a representable graph is @xmath7-representable is np - complete for @xmath11 , while the class of circle graphs coincides with the class of graphs with representation number at most 2 .    however , the first , and currently the only , paper solely dedicated to the study of representable graphs is  @xcite .",
    "we review some of the results from that paper in section  [ def ] .",
    "the current paper provides substantial additions to the known results on representable graphs , in particular solving some of open problems in  @xcite .",
    "if a word @xmath1 is @xmath7-uniform ( each letter of @xmath1 occurs exactly @xmath7 times in it ) then @xmath8 is called @xmath7-representable .",
    "it was shown in  @xcite that a graph is representable if and only if it is @xmath7-representable for some @xmath7 .",
    "however , nothing was known on an upper bound for the length of words representing graphs except for words that permutationally represent graphs ( see section  [ def ] for definitions ) , namely that a permutationally representable graph on @xmath9 nodes is @xmath12-representable ( this follows from lemma  [ l1 ] below proved in  @xcite , the fact that the dimension of a poset on @xmath9 elements is at most @xmath10 , and an evident fact that a @xmath7-representable graph is also @xmath13-representable ) . in this paper",
    "we prove that if a graph on @xmath9 nodes is representable then it is @xmath9-representable , from which one concludes that the recognition problem for representable graphs is in np . in section",
    "[ nice ] we prove a fact that a comparability graph is permutationally @xmath14-representable if and only if the poset induced by this graph has dimension @xmath15 .",
    "thus it is np - hard to determine if a graph is permutationally @xmath7-representable , and also whether it is @xmath7-representable for @xmath16 that effectively kills the hope of giving any nice characterization of , say , the class of 3-representable graphs . on the other hand ,",
    "permutationally 2-representable graphs are the permutation graphs , and 2-representable graphs are the circle graphs which generalizes a result in  @xcite that each outerplanar graph is 2-representable ( see section  [ nice ] and  @xcite ) .",
    "we leave as an open problem the decision problem `` is a given graph representable ? '' .",
    "it turns out that 3-colorable graphs are representable ( see section  [ char ] ) while 4-colorable graphs are not necessarily representable . in any case , it is possible to give a characterization of representable graphs in terms of orientations which we do in section  [ char ] .",
    "we give an example of @xmath7-representable but not @xmath14-representable graph thus showing that there does not exist a constant @xmath17 such that each representable graph is @xmath18-representable for @xmath19 ( see section  [ nice ] ) . as an example one can take the graph @xmath20 obtained from a cocktail party graph @xmath21 by adding an all - adjacent vertex .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ def ]",
    "we give definitions of objects of interest and review some of the known results . in section  [ char ]",
    "we give a characterization of representable graphs in terms of orientations and discuss some important corollaries of this fact . in section",
    "[ nice ] we consider the problems concerning the representation numbers , and show that it is always at most @xmath9 but can be as much as @xmath10 .",
    "we explore in section  [ classif ] which classes of graphs are representable , showing , in particular , 3-colorable graphs to be representable , but numerous others to be orthogonal to representability .",
    "finally , we conclude with a discussion of algorithmic complexity and some open problems in section  [ open ] .",
    "in this section we follow  @xcite to define the objects of interest .    let @xmath1 be a finite word over an alphabet @xmath22 .",
    "if @xmath1 involves the letters @xmath23 then we write @xmath24 .",

    "a word is @xmath7-_uniform _ if each letter appears in it exactly @xmath7 times .",
    "a 1-uniform word is also called a _",
    "permutation_. denote by @xmath28 the _ concatenation _ of words @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "we say that the letters @xmath31 and @xmath32 _ alternate _ in @xmath1 if the word induced by these two letters contains neither @xmath33 nor @xmath34 as a factor . if a word @xmath1 contains @xmath7 copies of a letter @xmath3 then we denote these @xmath7 appearances of @xmath3 by @xmath35 .",
    "we write @xmath36 if @xmath37 stays in @xmath1 before @xmath38 , i.  e. , @xmath37 is to the left of @xmath38 in @xmath1 .",
    "let @xmath0 be a graph with the vertex set @xmath2 and the edge set  @xmath39 .",
    "we say that a word @xmath1 _ represents _ the graph @xmath8 if there is a bijection @xmath40 such that @xmath41 if and only if @xmath31 and @xmath32 alternate in @xmath1 .",
    "it is convenient to identify the vertices of a representable graph and the corresponding letters of a word representing it .",
    "we call a graph @xmath8 _ representable _ if there exists a word @xmath1 that represents @xmath8 . if @xmath8 can be represented by a @xmath7-uniform word , then we say that @xmath8 is _",

    "some other small non - representative graphs are given in fig .  1 ( this figure appears in  @xcite ) .",
    "paper  @xcite contains several open problems . in this paper",
    "we solve some of them .",
    "the word representation of representable graphs is simple and natural .",
    "yet it does not lend to easy arguments for the characteristic of representable graphs .",
    "non - representability is even harder to argue in terms of the many possible corresponding words .",
    "the main result of this section is a new characterization of representable graphs that leads easily to various results about representability .",
    "we give a characterization in terms of orientability , which implies that representability corresponds to a property of a digraph obtained by directing the edges in certain way .",
    "recall that lemma  [ l1 ] states that a graph is permutationally representable if and only if it has a transitive orientation .",
    "we prove a similar fact on representable graphs , namely , that a graph is representable if and only if it has a so - called _ semi - transitive orientation_. our definition , in fact , generalizes that of a transitive orientation .",
    "other orientations have been defined in order to capture generalizations of comparability graphs . as transitive orientations form constraints on the orderings of induced @xmath60 , these generalizations form constraints on the orderings of induced @xmath61 .",

    "an acyclic digraph is a _ shortcut _ if it is induced by the vertices of a semi - cycle and contains a pair of non - adjacent vertices .",
