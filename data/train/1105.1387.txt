    "the analysis of apsidal motion in eccentric binary stars has been used for years to test stellar structure models .",
    "the periastron advance of an eccentric binary system is a direct consequence of the finite size of the stellar components , and of tidal interactions between them .",
    "consequently , apsidal motion serves as a measure of the internal structure of stars @xcite .",
    "specifically , measurement of apsidal motion in eccentric binary systems allow stringent tests of the internal structure constant @xmath3 predicted by theory .",
    "apsidal motion also provides a test of general relativity outside of our solar system .    the photometric variability of the 2.408 day period , eccentric , massive eclipsing binary ( eb ) v578  mon ( hde  259135 , bd@xmath41299 ) , comprising a b1 type primary star and a b2 type secondary star , was first identified in the study by @xcite of ngc  2244 within the rosette nebula ( ngc  2237 , ngc  2246 ) .",
    "the absolute dimensions of v578  mon have been determined from three seasons of strmgren @xmath5 photometry and one season of radial - velocity data by .",
    "an analysis of the metallicity and evolutionary status of v578  mon was undertaken by and h2000 .",
    "the masses and radii of v578  mon determined from these data are @xmath6 @xmath0  and @xmath7 @xmath0 , and @xmath8 r@xmath9 and @xmath10 r@xmath9 , for the primary and secondary respectively ( h2000 ) .",
    "these masses and radii are accurate to better than 3% , making v578  mon one of only nine ebs with @xmath11 @xmath0  and with sufficient accuracy to be included in the compilation of benchmark - grade ebs . however , of these , v578  mon is the only eccentric eb lacking an apsidal motion measurement .",
    "the classical theory of tides and general relativity both predict that a close , eccentric system such as v578  mon will experience a certain amount of periastron advance .",
    "the angle of periastron , @xmath12 , is given by the equation @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the angle of periastron at the reference epoch hjd@xmath15 , and @xmath16 is the time since hjd@xmath15 .",
    "the apsidal period is given by @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the orbital period and @xmath19 is the apsidal motion in deg  cycle@xmath20 .",
    "the aavso research note by @xcite presented the first long term photometry of v578 mon that was used to identify apsidal motion in the system and to update its ephemeris .",
    "the author estimated a value of @xmath21  @xmath22  yr   from 14 independent primary eclipse minima measured over a 40 year period . here",
    "we present an analysis of the apsidal motion of v578  mon using the state - of - the - art eb modeling software phoebe @xcite , which updates and extends the venerable wilson - devinney code @xcite .",
    "traditionally , apsidal motion of ebs has been determined via eclipse timings .",
    "however , the apsidal motion of an eccentric eb causes not only the eclipse timings to vary ; it also causes the shapes and depths of the eclipses  as well as the morphology of the out - of - eclipse portions of the light curve  to vary over time . therefore , in principle a full light curve model takes into account more of the apsidal information encoded in the light curve data , and should yield an extremely precise measure of the apsidal motion .    using our own light curve data spanning 40  yr together with previous light curves from the literature",
    ", we measure an apsidal period for v578  mon of @xmath1  yr . furthermore , as a consequence of including the apsidal motion for the first time into the analysis of the orbit of v578  mon , we report an updated eccentricity of @xmath2 , which differs from the previous literature value of 0.0867@xmath230.0006 ( h2000 ) .",
    "these fundamental orbital parameters set the stage for follow - up analyses to determine the internal structure of the stars in v578  mon for the first time , and to re - determine the stellar radii , for detailed tests of stellar evolution models with this benchmark system .",
    "in  [ sec : data ] , we present the photometry used in this paper . in  [ sec : analysis ] , we perform the light curve analysis of all photometry . in  [ sec : results ] , we present the apsidal period and orbital eccentricity along with an error analysis .",
    "we conclude in  [ sec : summary ] with a discussion and summary .",
    "the available time - series photometry of v578  mon covers nearly 40  yr and more than one full apsidal motion period .",
    "a summary of the various light curve epochs , including filters and observing facilities used , is presented in table  [ table : phot ] .",
    "photometry from @xcite includes multiband light curves spanning 19672006 from the 16-in telescope at kitt peak national observatory ( kpno ) and from the tennessee state university(tsu ) -vanderbilt 16-in automatic photoelectric telescope ( apt ) at fairborn observatory .",
    "the kpno johnson @xmath24 light curves comprise 725 data points spanning 19671984 with average formal uncertainties per data point of 0.004 mag .",
    "the apt johnson @xmath25 light curves span 19942006 and consist of 1783 data points with formal uncertainties per data point of 0.001 mag for b and 0.002 mag for v @xcite .",
    "light curves from h2000 span 19911994 from the 0.5-m strmgren automatic telescope ( sat ) at la silla , with 248 data points in each of the @xmath5 filters and average formal uncertainty per data point of 0.003 mag ( h2000 ) .",
    "table  [ table : phot ] lists these formal uncertainties , @xmath26 , as reported by the original authors .",
    "however , from our light curve fits ( see below ) we found that these formal errors were in most cases underestimated .",
    "thus we also report as @xmath27 in table  [ table : phot ] the uncertainties that we ultimately adopted for each light curve ( see  [ sec : globalfit ] for details ) .",
    "here we determine @xmath19 with the light curve modeling program phoebe using all of the available photometry ( table  [ table : phot ] ) .",
    "we perform the light curve fitting in two separate approaches . in the first approach (  [ sec : epochfit ] ) , we determined @xmath19 by finding the linear change in @xmath28 from fits to individual light curve epochs . in the second approach (  [ sec : globalfit ] ) , we determine @xmath19 by finding a global light curve solution simultaneously to all of the light curve data in table  [ table : phot ] .",
    "all fixed parameters are listed in table  [ table : params ] . for fixed parameters in both approaches ,",
    "we adopt the spectral type of the primary to be b1v , which implies @xmath29k ( h2000 , and references therein ) .",
    "we adopt gravity brightening ( @xmath30 , @xmath31 ) and surface albedos ( @xmath32 , @xmath33 ) to be 1 , as appropriate for stars with radiative envelopes .",
    "the rotational synchronicity parameters ( @xmath34 , @xmath35 ) are fixed at @xmath36 and @xmath37 for the primary and secondary , respectively , based on the @xmath38 and radii determined by h2000 .",
    "our limb darkening coefficients follow the square - root law for fully radiative stars . in all cases",
    "we also adopt the semi - major axis ( @xmath39 ) and the mass ratio ( @xmath40 ) from h2000 because these parameters are determined principally from the radial - velocity curves .",
    "we do not include star spots in any of the light curve modeling ; as discussed below , the variations in the light curve data are fully reproduced through the effects of apsidal motion .      to obtain an initial , simple estimate of the apsidal period , we first determine @xmath19 by finding the linear change in @xmath41 from the individual johnson @xmath25 light curve epochs 19731976 , 19941995 , and 20052006 ( table  [ table : phot ] ) .",
    "we chose these epochs because they span one full apsidal period , and because these light curves were obtained using the same instrument and filter set .",
    "johnson @xmath25 light curve epochs 19731976 are a portion of the kpno 1967 - 1984 light curve listed in table  [ table : phot ] .",
    "the free parameters are the angle of periastron @xmath41 , the inclination of the orbit @xmath42 , the secondary temperature @xmath43 , and the surface potentials @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "the starting values for these parameters are from h2000 ( see table  [ table : params ] ) .",
    "note that we fit for the surface potential of the stars ( i.e. , @xmath46 ) as well as @xmath43 , in order to give the light curve model full freedom to fit the eclipse widths and depths , however we regard the best - fit values of these parameters as preliminary .",
    "we fixed @xmath2 , as determined in the global solution to all light curve data described in ",
    "[ sec : globalfit ] .",
    "we set the orbital period , @xmath18 , to the value from @xcite , and we used the primary minima eclipse times from @xcite as the hjd@xmath15 values for each light curve epoch .",
    "the resulting best - fit @xmath12 at specified hjd@xmath15 s and formal errors from each light curve epoch are given in table  [ table : w ] .",
    "a least - squares line fit to these @xmath12 vs.  orbital cycles initially gave a reduced chi square @xmath47 , where n is the number of data points .",
    "this indicates that the uncertainties on the individual @xmath12 values are underestimated .",
    "this is not surprising because the formal uncertainties on @xmath12 here do not take correlations with other parameters into account , as we do in our global light curve solution below .",
    "therefore we scaled the uncertainties in table  [ table : w ] to achieve @xmath48 .",
    "the slope of the fitted line gives @xmath49 deg  cycle@xmath20  and thus an apsidal period @xmath50  @xmath51  yr .",
    "next we perform a global light curve solution fit simultaneously to all epochs and filters of available light curve data ( see table  [ table : phot ] ) .",
    "the free parameters are @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath42 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and @xmath19 .",
    "the initial values for these parameters are from h2000 except for @xmath19 , for which we used @xmath57 deg  cycle@xmath20  calculated from the estimated apsidal period from @xcite .",
    "we again fixed @xmath18 and hjd@xmath58 to the values from @xcite .",
    "we perform two global light curve fitting iterations . for the first iteration we used the formal photometric uncertainties , @xmath26 in table  [ table : phot ] , which yielded a total @xmath59 , indicating underestimated photometric errors .",
    "thus for the second iteration we scaled the photometric errors to make the @xmath60 of each light curve to equal the number of data points @xmath61 of the light curve .",
    "the scaled photometric errors @xmath27 listed in table  [ table : phot ] reflect more realistic , conservative values given the quality of our photometry .",
    "effectively this causes @xmath62 of each light curve to be approximately unity .",
    "this yielded a total @xmath63 for the final fit .",
    "the best fit global solution is plotted over multiple light curve epochs in figures [ fig : b ] , [ fig : v ] , [ fig : sat ] , and [ fig : kpno ] .",
    "the resulting apsidal motion is @xmath64 deg  cycle@xmath20 , giving an apsidal period @xmath65  @xmath1  yr . the quoted uncertainties are from a detailed @xmath60 analysis ( see  [ sec : wdot_vs_e ] ) . in table",
    "[ table : params ] , we list the full set of system parameters resulting from the global light curve model fit .",
    "note that the changes in the shapes , depths , and timings of the primary and secondary eclipses  as well as the changes in the out - of - eclipse portions of the light curves  are due to apsidal motion effects and are very well reproduced by the model .",
    "these variations over time due to apsidal motion are clearly demonstrated in figure  [ fig : demo ] , which displays the global light curve solution for the johnson @xmath66 light curve epochs 20052006 , 19992000 , 19951996 , 19941995 , and 19731976 .",
    "we have determined the apsidal motion , @xmath19 , of v578  mon via model fits to the available light curve data . calculating the linear change in @xmath28 by fitting individual light curve epochs spaced over one apsidal period results in @xmath49 deg  cycle@xmath20  and @xmath65  @xmath51  yr . calculating @xmath19 via a global light curve solution results in @xmath64 deg  cycle@xmath20  and @xmath65  @xmath1  yr .",
    "the two values are consistent within the uncertainties .",
    "we adopt the latter value as it incorporates the full dataset , is more precise , and furthermore our error analysis accounts for correlations in the fitted parameters ( see below ) .",
    "we prefer the approach of fitting the full light curves because it incorporates all available light curve data in table  [ table : phot ] , not just the eclipse timings . as shown across multiple observing seasons in figures [ fig : b ] , [ fig : v ] , and [ fig : kpno ] , the shapes , depths , and timings of the primary and secondary eclipses change with time due to @xmath19 .",
    "furthermore , the light curves show variation in the out - of - eclipse data over time which are very well reproduced by the light curve model .",
    "the model light curves do not include star spots , showing that the out - of - eclipse variations in the light curve of v578  mon are indeed a manifestation of apsidal motion .",
    "the eccentricity from our light curve model fit incorporating apsidal motion is @xmath2  ( table  [ table : params ] ) , which differs significantly from the previously reported value of @xmath67 ( h2000 ) . to further investigate the h2000 eccentricity",
    ", we perform a light curve fit within phoebe using only the sat photometry ( the same data used in h2000 ) .",
    "we set @xmath19 to zero and @xmath39 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath42 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 to values from h2000 .",
    "the only free parameter is @xmath52 .",
    "this phoebe fit converges to a light curve solution with @xmath70 , reproducing the @xmath52 found by h2000 .",
    "evidently , accounting for the effects of apsidal motion yields a different @xmath52 .",
    "the @xmath52 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 are correlated parameters in light curve analysis , meaning that our significantly different @xmath52 could yield different radii for the stars .",
    "the new , tentative radii we compute are approximately @xmath71 r@xmath9 and @xmath72 r@xmath9 for the primary and secondary as compared to the literature values of @xmath8 r@xmath9 and @xmath10 r@xmath9 ( h2000 ) .",
    "thus there is an indication that the updated @xmath52 together with the @xmath19 newly reported here may result in a significantly different r@xmath73 .",
    "this will be the subject of an in - depth analysis in a forthcoming paper .      in order to determine realistic uncertainties on @xmath19 and @xmath52",
    ", we performed a detailed analysis of the @xmath60 space around the best fit values .",
    "we varied @xmath19 over 0.07020.0716 deg  cycle@xmath20 with step length 0.00006 deg  cycle@xmath20 , and we varied @xmath52 over 0.07650.0787 with step length 0.000084 .",
    "for each of the 625 combinations of @xmath19 and @xmath52 , we recomputed the global light curve fit as before .",
    "figure  [ fig : wdot_vs_e ] shows the resulting contour plot of @xmath60 for @xmath52 vs.  @xmath19 .",
    "contours are drawn at @xmath74 values corresponding to 1@xmath27 , 2@xmath27 , and 3@xmath27 uncertainty for a @xmath75 distribution of two parameters of interest @xcite .",
    "the contour shapes indicate that @xmath19 and @xmath52 are not strongly correlated given our analysis .",
    "moreover , figure  [ fig : wdot_vs_e ] clearly demonstrates that the previously reported value of @xmath76 ( h2000 ) lies well beyond the 3@xmath27 contour and can therefore be ruled out with very high statistical significance .",
    "the accurate apsidal period of @xmath1  yr  and updated orbital eccentricity of @xmath2  of v578  mon underscores the value of a long time baseline of photometric observations for eccentric eclipsing binary stars .",
    "the traditional eclipse timing method uses the timing of the primary and secondary eclipse of an eccentric binary star system to calculate @xmath52 and @xmath19 among other parameters . in this paper",
    ", we use the eclipse timings but also the changing shapes , widths , and depths of the primary and secondary eclipse due to @xmath19 , as well as the light curve variations in the out - of - eclipse phases to determine realistic constraints on @xmath19 and @xmath52 .",
    "furthermore , we demonstrate that including the apsidal motion parameter in light curve fitting can affect the eccentricity measurement of eclipsing binary systems .",
    "the apsidal motion of v578  mon can provide an accurate test of theoretical calculations of the internal structure constant ( @xmath3 ) . for example , find generally good agreement between the theoretically predicted and measured @xmath77 when they consider ebs with radii to @xmath232% accuracy .",
    "comparing against ebs with very accurately measured radii is critical , because the theoretically predicted @xmath77 is highly dependent upon the stellar radii ( @xmath78 ) .",
    "currently , only 18 eccentric ebs have stellar radii and @xmath19 measured with sufficient accuracy to stringently test theoretical internal structure models . of these , only em  car , v478  cyg , v453  cyg , and cw  cep have masses greater than 10  @xmath0 , well constrained @xmath19 , and radii accurate to @xmath232% .",
    "a detailed reanalysis of v578  mon will yield accurate radii and , combined with our @xmath64 deg  cycle@xmath20 , will yield an accurate @xmath77 with which to test theoretical internal structure models of high mass stars .",
    "there is still much to know about high mass stellar evolution , especially at young ages , making v578  mon an important testbed for stellar evolution models given the large amount of precise photometry and radial velocity data on the system . to date",
    ", there are only nine ebs with component masses greater than 10 @xmath0  whose masses and radii are accurate to @xmath233% .",
    "stellar evolution models for stars with masses greater than 10 @xmath0  thus remain poorly constrained by ebs .",
    "future reanalysis of v578  mon will include a precise calibration of high - mass evolution models similar to the work on v453  cyg by @xcite .",
    "finally , v578  mon s location allows for precise age and distance constraints of the rosette nebula , similar to previous work on v578  mon by h2000 .",
    "a follow - up paper will incorporate the accurate orbital parameters newly determined here in order to re - determine all of the physical properties  including internal structure parameters  of this important , benchmark eb .",
