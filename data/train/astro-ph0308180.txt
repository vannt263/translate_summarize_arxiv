    "massive stars are responsible for many important phenomena in galaxies .",
    "they alter their environment through the emission of high energy radiation and the deposition of momentum and mechanical energy into the interstellar medium through powerful winds . at the end of their lives ,",
    "massive stars explode as supernova enriching the interstellar medium and causing shocks that may trigger the formation of new stars .",
    "the life and death of massive stars have a profound impact on both local and galactic scales .",
    "massive stars are believed to form in warm dense cores of molecular clouds .",
    "the earliest stage of a star in the process of forming is known as ` prestellar core ' ( psc ) @xcite .",
    "pscs have not yet formed a central protostar and will not be detected in the near infrared ( nir ) or at radio wavelengths .",
    "moreover pscs have temperatures of only @xmath120 k and their spectral energy distributions ( seds ) peak in the far infrared ( fir ) at @xmath1200 @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the next phase of evolution toward the main sequence is known as the hot core ( hc ) phase . in this stage , a compact , dense and warm molecular cloud core is believed to harbor a massive protostar in a process of rapid accretion , probably surrounded by an equatorial accretion disk @xcite .",
    "hcs are not detected at wavelengths shorter than @xmath110 @xmath0 , their seds are broader than a single temperature black body distribution , but they have a pronounced peak at @xmath1100 @xmath0 . since the protostar experiences a process of rapid massive accretion it can not produce a detectable region @xcite . after the accretion is over or greatly diminished , the lyman continuum photons emitted by the massive star ionize the surrounding gas and a ultra - compact ( uc ) region is formed .",
    "uc regions have seds also peaking at @xmath1 100 @xmath0 , but they now can be detected at shorter wavelengths , such as 1 - 2 @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the ionized gas is surrounded by a warm dust cocoon which makes uc regions bright sources in the mid infrared ( mir ) , as well .",
    "as the star evolves , the uc region expands , the natal gas and dust are swept away by intense stellar winds . eventually , the ionizing star becomes visible , but it may have moved 10 - 15% along its evolutionary track ( i.e after the zero age main sequence ) at this stage @xcite , and important questions regarding the formation of massive stars and their environment can not be directly addressed anymore .",
    "ngc 3576 harbors at least a dozen intriguing objects with color indexes @xmath2@xmath32 , identified by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter fbdc ) .",
    "the @xmath4-band spectra of some of the brighter sources do not show any photospheric features .",
    "moreover , the co 2.3 @xmath0 bandhead is seen in emission or absorption in the spectra of 4 of these objects . although the presence of this feature in emission or absorption has been explained by a variety of mechanisms , such as circumstellar disks , stellar or disk winds , magnetic accretion , instabilities in the inner regions of accretion disks of low mass stars or free - falling gas along field lines ( see the references in fbdc ) ,",
    "disk emission is the most preferred model , at least for low mass stars .",
    "the case is not yet clear for massive stars .",
    "the co bandhead was also found in emission in massive stars in m17 by @xcite in low resolution spectra .",
    "optical spectra of some of these same stars suggest they do have circumstellar disks .",
    "@xmath2 excess \" objects in ngc  3576 may be even younger than the m17 objects , which are visible in the @xmath5 band @xcite and are believed to be massive young stellar objects ( ysos ) perhaps surrounded by a thick accretion disk .",
    "there are analogous massive objects with strong nir excess in w31 @xcite , w42 @xcite , and w49 @xcite .",
    "four sources - # 48 , # 50 , # 60 and # 60b ( all sources with  # \" in the present paper follow the fbdc nomenclature ) - were found at the position of the mir source irs 1 , identified by @xcite .",
    "the @xmath4-band spectrum of # 48 does not show any photospheric lines and moreover , source # 50 was not detected at @xmath6 and @xmath7 bands . for this reason",
    "no further information , such as spectral type could be derived from nir data . however , at this evolutionary stage , crucial stellar parameters , like luminosity and hence the stellar mass , can be inferred by measuring their fluxes in the mir .",
    "this spectral regime is also suitable to study the environment where the ysos are forming .",
    "the spatial distribution of dust can put constraints on the geometry of accretion since accretion via a disk needs large amounts of gas ( which is mixed to the dust ) concentrated in a small region .",
    "ngc 3576 ( also known as g291.3 - 0.71 or rcw57 ) is a giant region located in the galactic plane at a kinematic distance 2.8 ( @xmath8 ) kpc ( fbdc ) .",
    "it was observed at radio wavelengths by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "methanol and water masers were detected by @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "nir photometry was performed by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and fbdc who presented a deep nir study of ngc 3576 .",
    "@xcite originally observed the region in the mir .",
    "five sources were identified and the brightest , irs 1 , was unresolved with a 7@xmath9 diaphragm . later",
    "mir observations of ngc 3576 , from @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and more recently , @xcite , were also unable to resolve the source irs 1 .    in this paper",
    ", we present high - resolution mir observations of 3 selected fields in ngc 3576 , taken through the atmospheric windows near 10 @xmath0 and 18 @xmath0 , in @xmath10 2 . the data and the discussion of the results are presented in the @xmath10 3 .",
    "the conclusions are summarized in @xmath10 4 .",
    "the data were obtained at the gemini south observatory 8-m telescope on 2001 november 30th and december 4th and 6th in service mode with the university of florida oscir mir camera .",
    "the camera employs a rockwell 128@xmath11128 pixel si : as bib detector , the plate scale at gemini was 0.0859/pixel ; the total field of view ( fov ) of the array was 11@xmath1111 .",
    "flux calibration was performed using the mir standard star @xmath12 cma observed during the night as part of the baseline calibration program .",
    "air mass differences between the standard star observations and the target observations were @xmath130.3 resulting in an uncertainty of approximately 10% .",
    "table [ stdlog ] presents a summary of the observations , as well as the filter parameters .",
    "sky and background subtraction were achieved by the standard chop - and - nod technique .",
    "sky images were taken @xmath14 to the north of the selected fields .",
    "images were processed using the oscir reduction package running under iraf environment , including the flat field correction .",
    "the processed images were also corrected for bad pixels and finally were flux calibrated .",
    "the photometry was performed assuming a gaussian psf model fitted to the objects .",
    "images were obtained through the @xmath15-broad band at 10.5 @xmath0 and the narrow - band filters at 7.9 , 9.8 , 12.5 and 18.2 @xmath0 .",
    "the 40 seconds exposure time was the minimum value to allow a complete chop - nod cycle . based on pre - commissioning sensitivity , this value would result in a narrow - band s / n of @xmath13 for a 100 mjy point source .    the detection limit ( s / n@xmath11 ) is @xmath1100 mjy in all bands , except at 18.2 @xmath0 , which is @xmath1900 mjy .",
    "three fields were observed : the region associated with irs 1 ( in all bands ) , the region centered on source # 95 ( at 7.9 , 9.8 , 12.5 and 18.2 @xmath0 bands ) and field where sources # 52 and # 54 are located ( only at the 12.5 @xmath0 band ) .",
    "the first field observed was centered at the position of irs 1 , where 3 nir sources were found by @xcite and fbdc : # 48 , # 50 and # 60 .",
    "the second field observed is located @xmath16 east of irs 1 .",
    "this field hosts 2 yso candidates ( # 95 and # 83 ) and a late - o / early - b star ( # 85 ) identified in the color - magnitude diagram presented by fbdc ( their figure 3 ) .",
    "this second set of images , however , has lower s / n ratio and for this reason we could measure the flux only for source # 95 in the 7.9 , 9.8 and 12.5 @xmath0 bands .",
    "the third field was imaged only in the 12.5 @xmath0 band and for this reason will not be presented .",
    "it is located @xmath17 southern of irs 1 and hosts one yso candidate ( # 52 ) and an object detected by fbdc only in the @xmath4-band ( # 54 ) .",
    "a third object was detected in this field as a negative pattern , its position relative to the extend emission seen at the top of image , led us identify this object as source # 73 caught in the sky beam of chopping procedure , 15 @xmath9 north .",
    "sources in irs 1 are presented in figure [ fign ] .",
    "panel ( a ) shows the @xmath4-band image of sources # 48 , # 50 and # 60 taken with the phoenix acquisition camera under good seeing ( @xmath130.3 ) , the average psf is @xmath18 and the camera plate scale is 0.055@xmath9/pixel .",
    "the sources are labeled according to fbdc .",
    "figure [ fign ] ( b ) displays the @xmath15-band image of the same region showing the sources in irs 1 resolved for the first time at 10 @xmath0 and identified with the nir counterparts ( again , adopting the source numbers of fbdc ) .",
    "the brightest mir source is # 50 , followed by # 48 , opposite from the situation seen in the @xmath4-band image , which shows source # 48 brighter than source # 50 .",
    "for this reason , source # 48 was associated with irs 1 by previous authors .",
    "both images also show the double nature of source # 60 .",
    "the companion of source # 60 , hereafter # 60b , is located @xmath19 away to southwest . like source # 50",
    ", it is brighter at longer wavelengths .",
    "the images taken through the mir narrow - band filters are presented in the figure [ mos - irs1 ] .",
    "every image shows persistent artifacts located at the upper and lower right corners produced by the chop and nodding procedure .",
    "a careful inspection of the sky beam images did not show any point source object , however the artifacts could be produced by weak diffuse sources in the chopped sky beam .",
    "a logarithmic gray scale was used to emphasize the low level extended emission where the sources are embedded .",
    "the elongated shape in the n - s direction seen in the images at 7.9 @xmath0 and 12.5 @xmath0 ( figure [ mos - irs1]a and [ mos - irs1]c , respectively ) was produced by non optimum tuning of the primary mirror active optics system .",
    "a careful inspection of the images , especially the image taken at 9.8 @xmath0 ( figure [ mos - irs1]b ) , shows # 60 elongated in the ne - sw direction . in this case , it is the effect of its near companion , as seen in the @xmath4-band image .",
    "it can be noted also , that source # 60 is undetected in 7.9 and 12.5 @xmath0 , but it is clearly seen in the 9.8 @xmath0 image .",
    "this brightening at 9.8 @xmath0 comes from the emission of dust silicate grains in low density regions surrounding source # 60 .",
    "the case of source # 60b(n ) and # 60b(k ) is somewhat different . comparing the images taken at @xmath4 and @xmath15",
    ", we note that its centroid , relative to the centroid of other sources in the field , is shifted by @xmath20 .",
    "both images were supposed to be taken under the same orientation , but a slight rotation could lead us to a mistake in the identification of the sources .",
    "the positions of the sources , relative to source # 50 , are listed in the table [ shifts ] .",
    "they were obtained from the astrometry of sources in the figure [ fign ] .",
    "the positions of all sources are the same ( whithin the errors ) , except the position of source # 60b .",
    "this fact means that the @xmath4-band image has the same orientation of the @xmath15-band image .",
    "therefore we believe sources # 60b(k ) and # 60b(n ) to be associated .",
    "this shifting in the positions represents @xmath21 cm at 2.8 kpc .",
    "this length scale is nearly the same expected for uc regions which have radii up to @xmath22 cm and dust cocoons that are 10 times larger @xcite .",
    "we speculate that the positional shift is caused by emission and/or reprocessing of radiation arising from different places in the source # 60 dust cocoon .",
    "@xmath4-band emission could be radiated by superheated dust grains located in a dense , self - protective accretion disk , near the star @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , radiation detected at longer wavelength , such as the @xmath15 band , is emitted in the outer layers of the cocoon by warmer dust grains .",
    "the spatial resolution of both images , @xmath19 ( or @xmath23 cm ) is just high enough to make this effect evident .",
    "source # 95 is presented in figure [ comp ] , a contoured mosaic in the 12.5 @xmath0 band built from the images taken at the positions of irs 1 and source # 95 .",
    "the level curves are in arbitrary units but a logarithmic scale was used to enhance the extended emission surrounding the sources .",
    "this figure is composed of 2 adjacent images with a small overlapping area .",
    "the positions of sources # 83 and # 85 are indicated for reference , as well as the position of a previously unknown mir source , detected 8@xmath9 southeast of irs 1 .",
    "this source does not have any nir counterpart to be correlated , so we named it irs 1:se .",
    "images of source # 95 and irs 1:se are shown in the figure [ mos-95 ] , the extended emission seen around the sources comes from the warm dust distributed in the intra - cluster medium .",
    "source # 50 has a psf fwhm which is statistically indistinguishable from that of the unresolved standard star .",
    "irs 1:se is an extended source but it has a prominent peak as intense as source # 95 .",
    "for this reason and the fact that irs 1:se is located in low density end of the  tail \" of the extended emission of # 50 we believe it is an embedded source instead of a bright knot in the cloud .",
    "the position of the peak emission is @xmath12= 11h11m54.8s and @xmath24= -61@xmath2518@xmath2626@xmath9 ( j2000 ) .",
    "source # 95 , instead , closely resembles a cometary uc in the classification scheme of @xcite .",
    "photometry was performed by fitting a gaussian psf to the objects detected in the images , except irs 1:se . in this case",
    "the fluxes were obtained through a circular aperture of 1.5@xmath9 radius centered at the peak of irs 1:se emission .",
    "the @xmath15-band flux extracted from the calibrated image is given in the table [ nir - mir ] along nir fluxes .",
    "the @xmath27 fluxes were calculated from the magnitudes reported by @xcite and the @xmath28 flux is from @xcite .",
    "the magnitudes were converted into fluxes adopting the zero points from @xcite .",
    "seds in the range 1.25 to 18.2 @xmath0 are plotted in the figure [ nirsed ] .",
    "the seds show a flat spectrum for source # 48 and a spectrum rising toward longer wavelengths for source # 50",
    ". the 18.2 @xmath0 flux for sources # 60 and # 60b might be the fluxes of sources # 60 and # 60b together , since at this wavelength the sources remain unresolved .",
    "fluxes measured for each source at mir wavelengths are presented in table [ mir ] .",
    "the upper limits reported in this table ( except for the sources # 60 and # 60b ) represent the fluxes of the local background emission .",
    "they were obtained by integrating the flux of the extended emission at the position of the source over a circular aperture of 0.6@xmath9 .",
    "therefore they represent the minimum flux that the source indicated should have to be detected .",
    "the seds corresponding to the fluxes obtained with the narrow - band filters are shown in the figure [ mir - sed ] .",
    "the expected level of free - free mir emission was obtained by extrapolating the 3.4 cm flux from @xcite , assuming @xmath29 , after deconvolving the @xmath30 radio beamwidth .",
    "the free - free emission represents 0.2% of the @xmath15-band flux of source # 48 and # 60b , 0.02% for # 50 , 0.05% for # 95 and 0.1% for irs 1:se .",
    "while there is no reason to expect the standard classification of low mass ysos to be similar to that for high mass ysos , we can calculate similar spectral indices for the present sources to compare with those of lower mass stars .",
    "the 2.2 - 12.5 @xmath0 spectral indices @xmath31 @xcite for sources # 48 , # 50 and # 95 which we have measured the fluxes at 2.2 and 12.5 @xmath0 are reported in the table [ spt ] . sources # 48 and # 50 have indices like low mass class i object ( @xmath32 ) and source # 95 has a similar index as low mass class ii object ( @xmath33 ) , according to the classification scheme of @xcite .",
    "the geometry of birth sites of these stars can explain the differences in the observed seds .",
    "it might be that the stars are surrounded by their birth material in the form of a torus seen at different lines of sight .",
    "the radiation escaping along the rotation axis would produce a dust evacuated region , disrupting the spherical symmetric dust cocoons making them highly non uniform in density .",
    "therefore , the stellar luminosities derived from the fluxes reprocessed by the dust can be taken as lower limits , only .",
    "figure [ torus ] is a sketch of this scenario .",
    "the light emitted by sources viewed edge - on or nearly edge - on is absorbed by the torus , consistent with deep dust absorption observed at 9.8 @xmath0 and little or no emission at wavelengths shorter than 10 @xmath0 .",
    "however , the emission of superheated dust grains in the inner radius of the torus ( seen as white ) could be detected in the @xmath4 band if it is not seen exactly edge - on .",
    "this would be the case of source # 50 . from above",
    "( or below ) the torus equatorial plane , the light emitted by the star would travel through regions with lower density , implying lower absorption by the dust . from this viewpoint",
    ", the light emitted at nir wavelengths ( @xmath34 ) could be detected , but photospheric lines would appear veiled by the inner torus emission .",
    "the co bandhead at 2.3 @xmath0 is detected in emission if the angle is small ( the case of source # 48 ) , otherwise it would be detected in absorption ( like we see in the spectra of the yso candidates # 4 , # 160 and # 184 , for which we do not have any mir data yet ) .",
    "increasing the angle over ( or below ) the equatorial plane , one would observe the radiation that crosses regions with even lower densities ( the gray volume around the torus ) , in this case the dust absorption feature is absent and the star becomes brighter at wavelengths shorter than 2 @xmath0 .",
    "this would be the scenario for sources # 95 and # 60 . even at this vantage point , the photospheric lines would still appear veiled by the inner torus emission and/or by radiation reflected by the lower density dust near the star .",
    "observations at two different wavelengths can be combined to determine the dust color temperature and optical depths @xcite .",
    "since temperature determines the ratio of blackbody flux densities at any two wavelengths , color temperature maps can be obtained by simply ratioing two calibrated images at different wavelengths .",
    "the dust color temperature of sources in the field of irs 1 was obtained from the ratio of images taken at 7.9 and 18.2 @xmath0 .",
    "both images were registered by matching the position of source # 50 and zoomed to show the sources , the resulting image is shown in the figure [ ctemp ] .",
    "sources # 50 and # 48 are clearly seen and they have color temperatures of @xmath35 ( @xmath3610 ) k and @xmath37 ( @xmath3615 ) k respectively .",
    "sources # 60 and # 60b are not detected in this map due to their low s / n ratio .",
    "the dust color temperature of sources # 95 and irs 1:se were also obtained , but in this case through the fluxes measured in the 12.5 and 18.2 @xmath0 band , since the image taken at 7.9 @xmath0 has low s / n ratio .",
    "the results are : t = 270 ( @xmath3610 ) k for source # 95 , t = 100 ( @xmath3620 ) k for source irs 1:se .",
    "the uncertainties in the temperatures represent the difference between the results obtained using the 7.9/18.2 @xmath0 flux ratio and the 12.5/18.2 @xmath0 flux ratio .",
    "mir luminosity of sources # 48 and # 50 were estimated by integrating the fluxes measured at 3.5 ( @xmath28 band ) , 7.9 , 12.5 and 18.2 @xmath0 .",
    "the mir luminosity of source # 60b , instead , was estimated by performing the same integration , but using only the fluxes measured at 7.9 , 12.5 and 18.2 @xmath0 . from these results",
    ", we can estimate the bolometric luminosity assuming that mir luminosity must represent @xmath38% of the bolometric luminosity @xcite .",
    "the results are presented in the table [ spt ] .",
    "the spectral types were obtained from the derived bolometric luminosities and the grids of stellar models of @xcite , and they should be considered approximate given the large bolometric correction used to derive the bolometric luminosity .",
    "the silicate absorption map can be used to investigate the spatial distribution of dust and was obtained by ratioing the 9.8 @xmath0 band image and a  continuum \" image . this",
    " continuum \" was produced by averaging the images at 7.9 and 12.5 @xmath0 .",
    "the silicate optical depth , obtained by the procedure described by @xcite , is @xmath39 = 3.7 for source # 50 , corresponding to @xmath40 mag , assuming @xmath41 @xcite and @xmath42 = 0.77 for source # 48 corresponding to an @xmath43 = 12 .",
    "previous estimates of the opacity of irs 1 are from @xcite who found @xmath42=3.5 using a 15@xmath9 beamwidth and from @xcite , who found @xmath44 using a cvf 10 @xmath0 spectrum taken with an aperture of 7.5@xmath9 .",
    "both estimates were made using large apertures which include contributions from all sources and also their surrounding dust . values for visual extinction obtained with nir data for source # 48 are @xmath45 ( fbdc ) and @xmath46 @xcite .",
    "irs 1 was initially thought to be an important source of radiation to ngc 3576 , but we have found that it does not contribute substantially , as we show below .",
    "the number of lyman continuum photons derived from the radio data @xcite is @xmath47 s@xmath48 for ngc 3576 .",
    "a single o3 star or a cluster of at least 10 o6 stars is needed to produce the amount of lyman continuum photons found in ngc 3576 , but where are the ionizing sources ?",
    "figure [ 3576-cmp ] can give us an idea .",
    "the @xmath4-band image of ngc 3576 , from fbdc , was overplotted by the 3.4 cm continuum contour curves , from @xcite .",
    "the radio beamwidth in the image is @xmath30 .",
    "ysos are shown inside the circles and the positions of mir sources , detected by @xcite , are shown as boxes .",
    "none of the mir sources ( irs 1 - 5 ) is associated with the radio peak emission , moreover irs 1 does not affect the level curves in its vicinity .",
    "however , the strong continuum emission and rather large beam size of the radio image may be limiting our ability to detect compact radio emission around the irs 1 source .",
    "the radio data neither eliminate nor preclude their presence . however , according to our torus model and expectations for the evolutionary status of the massive ysos outlined in  1 , we expect these sources might be in the uchii region phase . despite the lack of a compact 3.4 cm source , there is very strong br@xmath49 emission surrounding the irs 1 sources @xcite .",
    "this strongly suggests a local contribution to the ionization of the circumstellar environment of these objects . for the brightest @xmath50band source , # 48 ,",
    "we have recently obtained a high spectral resolution ( @xmath5150,000 ) spectrum at 2.17 @xmath52 m on the gemini south telescope which shows a marked double peak morphology .",
    "this morphology does not include broad wings typical of a disk like signature , but would be consistent with a shell or torus geometry .",
    "this spectrum ( to be published in an upcoming paper ) is consistent with our torus model , and we thus prefer the interpretation that the irs 1 sources are in an uchii region phase , rather than in an earlier phase of evolution .    returning to the issue of where the dominant ionizing sources in ngc  3576 lie , we note that the radio peak emission corresponds to a region of dark patches to the south in the @xmath50band image and for this reason no ionizing source(s ) could be detected at @xmath4 .",
    "the radio peak emission lies far from any mir source and it is identified as an uc region in the figure 2(f ) of @xcite .",
    "the ionizing source(s ) must be a stellar cluster , just blocked by the dark clouds in the line of sight . in this case the cluster stars must be somewhat evolved : they already have broken out their birth material producing the quoted lyman continuum photons that are ripping apart the interviewing dark patches and hence do not form any detectable uc region . if the stars in the cluster were in an earlier , more enshrouded stage of evolution they could not produce the observed radio emission .",
    "a complete mir map of the region is planned in order to further study the massive yso candidates and their environment on the same basis as we have done for irs 1 .",
    "we have presented mir images of ngc 3576 .",
    "irs 1 is resolved into 4 sources for the first time at 10 @xmath0 .",
    "the brightest source in the @xmath15 band is source # 50 , which is different from the situation seen at @xmath4 , where source # 48 is the brightest .",
    "we have also presented mir images of the yso candidate # 95 , and the detection of nir sources # 52 , # 54 and # 73 as a negative object in the sky beam .",
    "seds of sources # 48 , # 50 and # 60 were constructed from 1.25 to 18.2 @xmath0 by combining the data available in the literature with our data .",
    "we also constructed the mir seds for sources # 48 , # 50 , # 95 and the detected companion of source # 60 , named # 60b , based on the fluxes measured through narrow - band filters .",
    "the optical depth , and hence the visual extinction toward each object was obtained from the silicate absorption feature and amounts to @xmath42 = 3.7 ( a@xmath53 = 59 mag ) for # 50 and @xmath42 = 0.77 ( a@xmath53 = 12 mag ) for # 48 .",
    "previous values of visual extinction for source # 48 are @xmath54 ( fbdc ) and @xmath55 @xcite .",
    "the mir luminosity of sources # 48 , # 50 , # 60b and # 95 were obtained after integrating their mir fluxes in order to give an approximate of their bolometric luminosities and hence the spectral types .",
    "we argue , based on the radio continuum image , that the irs 1 sources are not the major contributors to the ionization of ngc 3576 .",
    "nevertheless , we conclude that sources # 48 , # 50 and # 95 are young massive stars possibly surrounded by a torus of gas and dust which is responsible for the different seds observed .",
    "we report the detection of a new diffuse mir source without any nir counterpart .",
    "this source was found at 8@xmath9  southeast of # 50 and has a core - halo morphology .",
    "we named it irs 1:se and derived the color temperature of @xmath1100 k. irs 1:se has both morphology and color temperature compatible with hcs @xcite . moreover",
