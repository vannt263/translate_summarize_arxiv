    "after van den bergh @xcite introduced the notion of nccr ( noncommutative crepant resolution ) , its importance is now well recognized . a nice reference of the theory is leuschke s recent survey article @xcite .",
    "the most basic example is the following :    [ ex - intro - tame - quot ] let @xmath0 $ ] , a power series ring over a field @xmath1 , @xmath2 a small finite subgroup with @xmath3 , and @xmath4 the invariant subring .",
    "then the endomorphism ring of the @xmath5-module @xmath6 , @xmath7 , is isomorphic to the skew group ring @xmath8 and so a nccr .",
    "namely it has finite global dimension and is a mcm ( maximal cohen - macaulay ) @xmath5-module .",
    "( unlike the original definition of nccr by van den bergh , we do not assume that the base ring @xmath5 is gorenstein . )",
    "we are interested in generalizing this example .",
    "in particular , we would like to investigate the following problem :    [ prob - intro - motivating ] let @xmath9 be a module - finite and pure extension of commutative domains such that they are both noetherian , complete , local and normal , and moreover @xmath6 is regular . then is @xmath7 a nccr ?",
    "our main motivation for this problem is the situation in positive characteristic",
    ". then the extension @xmath9 can be purely inseparable and we have no galois group @xmath10 and can not use the isomorphism @xmath11 to show that @xmath7 is a nccr .    the purity condition in the problem does not matter in characteristic zero , because every module - finite extension of normal domains is pure . as corollary",
    "[ cor - byproduct ] shows , the condition is necessary in positive characteristic .",
    "apart from example [ ex - intro - tame - quot ] , the answer to the problem is known to be positive in dimension two .",
    "indeed , in this case , @xmath7 is mcm , as every reflexive module is mcm .",
    "moreover @xmath6 contains every indecomposable mcm @xmath5-module as a direct summand @xcite .",
    "then @xmath7 has finite global dimension from the following theorem :    [ thm - intro - leuschke ] let @xmath6 be a commutative noetherian complete local cm ring and @xmath12 a finitely generated mcm @xmath6-module which includes every indecomposable mcm @xmath6-module as a direct summand .",
    "then @xmath13 has finite global dimension .    in dimension @xmath14",
    ", one can hardly expect that a ring @xmath5 with a regular covering @xmath6 has only finitely many indecomposable mcm modules",
    ". however we will generalize theorem [ thm - intro - leuschke ] as follows :    let @xmath6 and @xmath12 be as in theorem [ thm - intro - leuschke ] .",
    "suppose that @xmath9 is a pure subring such that @xmath6 is a finitely generated @xmath5-module .",
    "suppose also that @xmath15 is mcm .",
    "then @xmath16 has finite global dimension .    as a corollary",
    "we obtain a partial answer of problem [ prob - intro - motivating ] :    let @xmath5 and @xmath6 be as in problem [ prob - intro - motivating ] . if @xmath7 is mcm , then it is a nccr .",
    "thus the remaining problem is :    with the assumption as in problem [ prob - intro - motivating ] , is @xmath7 always mcm ? or , when is it ?      using the above result and yi s theorem of the global dimension of a skew group ring @xcite , we will prove the following result on wild quotient singularities :    let @xmath17 $ ] , @xmath18 a finite group of order divisible by the characteristic of @xmath1 and @xmath4 .",
    "suppose that @xmath6 is unramified over @xmath19 in codimension one .",
    "then @xmath5 is not a pure subring of @xmath6 or strongly f - regular .",
    "several cases are known where the invariant ring @xmath20 is not cohen - macaulay , hence nor f - regular .",
    "for instance , it is the case if @xmath21 , the action is linear and the fixed point locus has codimension @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "we are interested also in the role of frobenius morphism in the theory of noncommutative ( crepant ) resolution .",
    "( by a ncr ( noncommutative resolution ) , we mean an endomorphism ring @xmath16 having finite global dimension . )",
    "firstly an interesting problem similar to problem [ prob - intro - motivating ] is :    [ prob - frob - nccr ] let @xmath5 be a commutative ring of characteristic @xmath22 such that its frobenius map @xmath23 is finite",
    ". then one can consider the endomorphism ring @xmath24 associated to the @xmath25-iterated frobenius @xmath26 . when is it a nc(c)r ?",
    "this is of particular intereset , because @xmath27 and @xmath28 is the ring of differential operators on @xmath5 .",
    "if for sufficiently large @xmath25 s , @xmath24 have global dimensions bounded from above , then from @xcite , @xmath29 also has finite global dimension .",
    "the ring @xmath24 is also closely related to the f - blowup @xcite .",
    "the following is our partial answer to problem [ prob - frob - nccr ] :    let @xmath6 and @xmath5 be as in problem [ prob - intro - motivating ] .",
    "suppose that @xmath7 is mcm .",
    "then for sufficiently large @xmath25 , @xmath24 is a nccr and morita equivalent to @xmath7 .",
    "in fact , the core of our proof is due to hara @xcite , who proved the corresponding result in dimension two .",
    "also toda and the author @xcite previously proved the theorem in the case of tame quotient singularities .",
    "their proof uses a result from the representation theory , while hara s argument replaces it with an elegant ring - theoretic argument .",
    "we should notice that @xmath24 is not a nccr for a general singularity @xmath5 .",
    "indeed dao proved @xcite that if @xmath5 is a local complete intersection which is regular in codimension two , then @xmath24 is not a nccr for any @xmath25 .      for commutative rings or schemes ,",
    "the frobenius morphism has been exploited as a tool to study singularities : kunz s characterization of regularity ( smoothness ) @xcite , the study of f - singularities ( see @xcite ) among others . in @xcite ,",
    "the author defined the frobenius morphism of the endomorphism ring of a module over a commutative ring . in section [ sec - nc - frob - gldim ]",
    ", we will also define the frobenius morphism of the skew group ring associated to a commutative ring and a finite group in an obvious way",
    ". then we will study relation between the finiteness of global dimension and the flatness of frobenius morphism . for commutative rings , both properties are characterizations of regularity and herzog @xcite gave a direct proof that the latter implies the former .",
    "koh and lee @xcite refined his result and proved certain constraint which the minimal resolution of every module satisfies",
    ". we will prove the noncommutative version of koh and lee s result ( theorem [ thm - koh - lee ] ) .",
    "however , in order to obtain finite global dimension using this , the flatness of frobenius morphism is not sufficient unlike the commutative case",
    ". then we will axiomize the properties of frobenius morphism which are necessary to deduce finite global dimension .",
    "moreover if the relevant noncommutative ring is @xmath16 , then we will relate the properties with those of @xmath12 in terms of the frobenius of @xmath5 .      throughout the paper",

    "thus every commutative ring has krull dimension @xmath30 .",
    "a _ module _ means a finitely generated left module unless otherwise noted .",
