    "this work has two motivations . first , to study the unruh effect@xcite for an observer with a finite lifetime .",
    "second , to probe the thermal time hypothesis@xcite .",
    "the unruh effect is the theoretical observation that the vacuum state @xmath2 of a quantum field theory on minkowski spacetime looks like a thermal equilibrium state for an uniformly accelerated observer with acceleration @xmath3 . the observed temperature is the davis - unruh temperature @xmath4 , and is closely related to hawking s black hole temperature ( @xmath5 is the speed of light , @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the planck and boltzmann constants . )    there exist many derivations of the unruh effect.@xcite one generally assumes that the observer moves over along an infinite worldine of constant acceleration .",
    "a model detector moving on this world line and interacting with the vacuum state of the field becomes excited and reaches a thermal state . for a free field , this can be computed integrating the two - point functions along the infinite trajectory .",
    "alternatively , one can consider the region causally connected to the world line .",
    "this region is the rindler wedge @xmath8 .",
    "a quantization scheme for the field restricted to @xmath8 leads to the definition of particle states .",
    "the conventional vacuum @xmath2 is a thermal distribution state of these particle .",
    "another approach is based on bisognano - wichman theorem@xcite : world lines of uniformly accelerated observers in @xmath8 , parametrized by proper time , are orbits of the action of a one - parameter group , which can be interpreted as the time flow of the accelerated observers .",
    "the vacuum state @xmath2 is a kms state with temperature @xmath9 , with respect to this time flow , over the algebra of the local observables in @xmath8 .",
    "intuitively , the reason the accelerated observer does not see a pure state can be viewed as related to the fact that he has no access to part of @xmath2 .",
    "each observer instantaneity surface is cut into two parts by the edge of the wedge .",
    "the degrees of freedom of the field on the other side of the edge are inaccessible to the observer . since @xmath2 has vacuum correlations across the edge ,",
    "the two sets of degrees of freedom on the two sides of the edge are entangled .",
    "the restriction of @xmath2 to the edge interior , therefore , fails to be pure a state .",
    "doubts have been raised on the universality of the unruh effect , for instance in ref .",
    "[ ] . one of the sources of the doubts is that most derivations of the effect consider infinite trajectories , while the trajectories of realistic detectors have a beginning and an end . in our opinion ,",
    "the theoretical support for the unruh effect is rather robust , and these doubts do not have much consistency . nonetheless , the issue of observers with finite lifetime is interesting .",
    "the region causally connected to a finite trajectory is far smaller than @xmath8 . typically , it is the intersection of the future of the beginning point of the trajectory with the past of its end point .",
    "such a region is called a  diamond \" . in suitable lorentz",
    "coordinates @xmath10 , any diamond can be represented as the region @xmath11 , with @xmath12 , defined by @xmath13 @xmath14 is the lifetime of the observer if he moves inertially . in a sense ,",
    "only the finite region @xmath11 can take part in the thermalization process .",
    "more precisely , the observer has access only to the degrees of freedom of the field that lie within @xmath15 on the @xmath16 simultaneity surface .",
    "does this observer see a thermal state ?",
    "is there a sense in which there is an associated temperature ?",
    "these questions can be addressed in a variety of ways .",
    "here we consider the possibility of adapting the bisognano - wichman approach to this case .",
    "let us now come to the thermal time hypothesis .",
    "consider a system with a large number of degrees of freedom .",
    "we describe our experimental knowledge of its state as a statistical state .",
    "a generic state determines a flow : in quantum theory , a state over an observable algebra determines a flow called the modular flow , or the tomita flow . in the classical case",
    ", the relation between a state and a its modular flow reduces to the relation between the distribution @xmath17 on phase space representing the state and the hamiltonian flow of @xmath18 .",
    "the thermal time hypothesis demands that the flow determined by the statistical state coincides with what we perceive as the physical flow of time . a second part of the hypothesis refers to the special cases in which a geometrical background provides an independent notion of temporal flow : if the geometric flow and the modular are related , the ratio of the rates of the two flows is identified as the temperature .",
    "the hypothesis was initially motivated by the problem of time in quantum gravity .",
    "the unruh effect can be interpreted as an example in which the thermal time hypothesis is realized .",
    "the relation between the unruh effect and the thermal time hypothesis is the following .",
    "the vacuum state @xmath2 , restricted to the algebra of the observables in the wedge @xmath8 generates a modular flow .",
    "this modular flow is precisely proportional to the proper time flow of uniformly accelerated observers .",
    "for each observer , the ratio of the two flows is @xmath9 . according to the thermal time hypothesis",
    ", this means that the natural physical time generated by @xmath2 on the algebra of the observables in the wedge is the proper time of an accelerated observer , and the corresponding temperature is the davis - unruh temperature .    a natural question , then , is whether there are other cases in which the thermal time associated to a spacetime region has a physical meaning .",
    "local algebras associated to diamonds are very natural objects in algebraic quantum field theory .",
    "as mentioned , a diamond is the region causally connected to an observer with finite lifetime .",
    "it is natural to wonder whether the modular flow generated by the vacuum restricted to the local algebra associated to a diamond the  diamonds flow \" , or the ",
    "diamonds time\" may have any significance at all .    in general",
    ", there is no reason to expect that a modular flow should have a geometric interpretation and lead to a notion of temperature .",
    "remarkably , however , the modular flow of a diamond _ is _ associated to a geometric action in the case of a conformally invariant quantum field theory in four dimensions .",
    "does this lead to a notion of temperature ?",
    "the modular parameter @xmath19 can not be directly proportional to the proper time along the geometric flow , because the modular parameter runs all along @xmath20 while the proper time @xmath21 of an observer in @xmath11 is bounded .",
    "however , we can nevertheless define a local temperature as the _ local _ ratio of the two flows .",
    "this allows us to define a temperature which is a natural generalization of the unruh - davies temperature to observers with a finite lifetime . in this paper",
    "we explicitly compute this temperature . for fixed acceleration",
    ", this temperature reduces to the unruh temperature when @xmath22 is large .",
    "furthermore , this temperature does not vanish even for non - accelerating observers .",
    "the ( minimal ) temperature associated an inertial observer with lifetime @xmath0 is the temperature @xmath23 this temperature is related to the fact that a finite lifetime observer does not have access to all the degrees of freedom of the field .",
    "but we leave any physical interpretation of this temperature for future investigations .",
    "in particular , it would be interesting to study whether it is related to the response of model detectors .",
    "section 2 briefly presents our main tools ( definition of local observable algebra , modular automorphism and kms condition ) and the thermal time hypothesis . in section 3",
    ", we recall the discussion of the unruh effect in the bisognano - wichman approach .",
    "section 4 presents our new results , namely the discussion of the generalization of the unruh effect to diamonds @xmath11 and its physical interpretation .",
    "section 5 briefly discusses the case of the future cone .",
    "minkowski metric has signature @xmath24 . from now on , we take @xmath25 .",
    "consider a quantum field theory on four dimensional minkowski space . we restrict our attention to conformally invariant quantum field theories .",
    "the conformal group is the group of transformations @xmath26 that preserve the causal structure : @xmath27 iff @xmath28 . in four dimensions ,",
    "this is the fifteen - parameters group generated by poincar transformations , dilatations and proper conformal transformations .",
    "an infinitesimal transformation is given by @xmath29 where @xmath30 are infinitesimal parameters .",
    "we assume that both the dynamics and the vacuum of our quantum field are invariant under these conformal transformations .",
    "since mass terms break conformal invariance , this means that we are dealing with a massless field .",
    "equivalently , we are considering a regime in which masses can be neglected .",
    "we recall a few elements on local observable algebras.@xcite  we have a hilbert space @xmath31 carrying a unitary representation @xmath32 of the poincar group .",
    "if the theory is conformally invariant , @xmath32 extends to a representation of the entire conformal group .",
    "there is a ray @xmath2 in @xmath31 , called the physical vacuum , invariant under the action of the poincar group ( or the conformal group ) .",
    "a field is an operator valued distribution over minkowski space @xmath33 .",
    "there is no operator corresponding to the value @xmath34 of the field @xmath35 at a given point @xmath36 ; there is an operator @xmath37 corresponding to the quantity obtained smearing out the field with a smooth function @xmath38 @xmath39 consider a finitely extended open subset @xmath40 of @xmath33 . the algebra generated by all operators @xmath37 , where @xmath38 has support in @xmath40 , is interpreted as representing physical operations that can be performed within @xmath40 . by completing this algebra in the norm topology",
    ", we obtain a @xmath41-algebra @xmath42 .",
    "this is called the local observable algebra associated to @xmath40 .",
    "we have an algebra @xmath42 associated to each open subset @xmath40 .",
    "the reeh - schlieder theorem states that the vacuum @xmath2 is a cyclic and separating vector for @xmath42 as soon as the causal complement of @xmath40 ( the set of all points which lie space - like to all points of @xmath40 ) contains a non - void open set .",
    "is cyclic but not separating for the algebra associated to the entire minkowski space @xmath43 .",
    "intuitively , a separating state can be thought as a density matrix with nonvanishing components on _ all _ basis states . ]",
    "the tomita - takesaki theorem associates a preferred flow @xmath44 to any @xmath41-algebra @xmath45 acting on a hilbert space with a preferred cyclic and separating vector @xmath2 .",
    "the flow is built as follows .",
    "let @xmath46 be the conjugate linear operator from @xmath47 to @xmath48 @xmath49 for any @xmath50 .",
    "@xmath46 is closeable with respect to the strong topology and its closure - still denoted by @xmath46- has a unique polar decomposition @xmath51 where @xmath52 is a selfadjoint positive operator ( unbounded in general ) called modular operator and @xmath53 is antiunitary .",
    "this allows us to define a one - parameter group of automorphisms of @xmath45 : the modular group @xmath44 of @xmath45 associated to @xmath2 @xmath54 ( see [ ] for details on the definition of @xmath55 ) with @xmath56 . if @xmath45 is the algebra of local observables on an open set @xmath40 of minkowski space , with non - void causal complement , we call _ modular group of @xmath40 _ the modular group of @xmath42 associated to the vacuum @xmath2 .",
    "we denote it as @xmath57 .",
    "we write @xmath58 for the corresponding modular operator .",
    "let us now recall the relation between modular flow and thermodynamics .",
    "consider a physical system with a finite number of degrees of freedom , say @xmath59 particles in a finite box with volume @xmath60 .",
    "in statistical physics , an equilibrium state is a state of maximal entropy .",
    "if @xmath31 is the hamiltonian describing @xmath46 , the mean value of any observable @xmath3 when @xmath46 is in an equilibrium state at inverse temperature @xmath61 is @xmath62 where the partition function @xmath63 is given by @xmath64 consider now the thermodynamical limit of this system : send the volume of the box @xmath60 and the number of particles @xmath59 to infinity , keeping the density @xmath65 fixed . in this limit",
    "the total energy @xmath66 goes to infinity and therefore the partition function ( [ z ] ) is no longer defined .",
    "one therefore needs a way to characterize the equilibrium states alternative to equations ( [ eq ] ) and ( [ z ] ) .",
    "this can be obtained as follows .",
    "an equilibrium state @xmath67 of inverse temperature @xmath61 can be directly characterized as a state over the algebra satisfying the kms condition .",
    "this requires that for any two observables @xmath3 and @xmath68 @xmath69 where @xmath70 denotes the time translation @xmath71 extended to a complex argument , and that the function @xmath72 is analytic in the strip @xmath73 a state @xmath67 satisfying these conditions is called kms with respect to the time translation @xmath70 .",
    "one can shows that both conditions ( [ kms1 ] ) and ( [ kms2 ] ) reduce to ( [ eq ] ) in the case of a finite dimensional system .",
    "these conditions represent the correct extension of the definition of an equilibrium state to infinite - dimensional systems.@xcite    now , the remarkable fact is that , given a @xmath41-algebra @xmath45 acting on a hilbert space @xmath31 with a cyclic and separating vector @xmath2 , the faithful state @xmath67 over @xmath45 defined by @xmath74 for any @xmath75 ( we use dirac notations ) is kms with respect to the modular group @xmath44 defined by @xmath2 .",
    "more precisely one has @xmath76 define @xmath77 .",
    "then @xmath78 therefore , if we _ define _",
    "@xmath79 we obtain condition ( [ kms1 ] ) ( as far as ( [ kms2 ] ) is concerned , see ref .  [ ] ) .",
    "in other words : _ an equilibrium state at inverse temperature @xmath61 can be characterized as a faithful state over the observable algebra whose modular automorphism group @xmath44 is the time translation group .",
    "the modular parameter @xmath19 is proportional to the time @xmath80 .",
    "the proportionality factor is minus the inverse temperature . _",
    "( the minus sign is there only for historical reasons : the mathematicians have defined the modular flow with sign opposite to that given by the physicists ) .",
    "the modular group equips a system in a generic state with a dynamics .",
    "the existence of such an intrinsic dynamics suggests a solution to a longstanding open puzzle in the physics of general covariant systems .",
    "the dynamical laws of a generally covariant system determine correlations between observables , but they do not single out any of these observables as time . this ",
    "timeless \" structure is sufficient to provide all dynamical predictions .",
    "however , this timeless structure leaves us without any understanding of the physical basis for the flow of time , a flow that has evident observable effects particularly in thermodynamical contexts .",
    "the _ thermal time hypothesis _ is the idea that there is no dynamical basis for the flow of time , but there is a thermodynamical basis for it .",
    "more precisely , a generic state determines a modular flow , and it is this flow that represents the physical basis of the flow of time .",
    "this flow is state dependent .",
    "thus :    _ the physical time depends on the state .",
    "when the system is in a state @xmath67 , the physical time flow is given by the modular flow of @xmath67_.    the second part of the hypothesis demands then that if the modular flow is proportional to a flow in spacetime , parametrized with the proper time @xmath21 , then the ratio of the two flows is the temperature @xmath81 in other words , when @xmath80 is independently defined , ( [ temps ] ) becomes a definition of the temperature . in previous applications of this idea , only cases",
    "in which @xmath82 is exactly constant along the flow were considered . in this paper , we extend the framework slightly , by considering a case in which the modular flow is proportional to a flow in spacetime , but the constant of proportionality between @xmath83 and @xmath84 varies along the flow . in such a situation ,",
    "it is natural to consider a local notion of temperature , defined at each point by @xmath85    the thermal time hypothesis is based on the idea that the origin of time is thermodynamical , and that the time flow is state - dependent . in a sense , the thermal time hypothesis is an inversion and a generalization of kms theory . given a time flow @xmath86 , kms theory identifies the thermal states as the kms states of the time flow .",
    "but given the kms state , the time flow @xmath86 is precisely its modular flow . since any generic state defines a modular flow , the idea here is that , generically , this modular flow is in fact the physical time that governs macroscopic thermodynamics .    as far as conventional systems are concerned ,",
    "notice the following remarkable fact : if we measure the statistical distribution of an equilibrium state , we can infer the hamiltonian from the result . we can then define time as the parameter of the flow generated by the hamiltonian .",
    "this provide an operational characterization of time . on the other hand",
    ", it is well known that it is difficult to provide a purely dynamical ( as opposed to statistical / thermodynamical ) characterization of what is time . in a generally covariant context , where definitely no physical time is determined by the dynamics",
    ", the thermal time hypothesis identifies the physical time as the modular flow for generic states .",
    "the thermal time hypothesis has been checked in several examples .",
    "the most striking one concerns the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) .",
    "the statistical state distribution describing the cmb determines a flow that coincides with the time coordinate of usual friedman - robertson - walker metric.@xcitethe associated temperature is the cmb temperature .",
    "the rindler wedge provides another example in which the hypothesis is realized .    for a detailed discussion of this issue and",

    "the trajectory ( [ ao ] ) is an orbit of this group .",
    "the proper time @xmath21 along the orbit is proportional to the boost parameter @xmath17 , and the proportionality factor is given by @xmath3 @xmath98 we can therefore parametrize the trajectory ( [ ao ] ) with the proper time @xmath21 and write it as @xmath99 so that @xmath100 that is , @xmath101 generates a proper - time translation of proper time @xmath21 along the accelerated world line .    consider a quantum field theory defined on @xmath43 and let @xmath102 denote the representation of the generator of this boost , so that @xmath103 then the operator @xmath104 can be viewed as an operator that generates the evolution in proper - time seen by the accelerated observer .",
    "the region causally connected to the accelerated observer , namely the set of the points that can exchange signals with a uniformly accelerated observer is the rindler wedge @xmath8 , defined by @xmath105 the wedge @xmath8 has a non void causal complement thus the modular group @xmath106 is defined .",
    "the modular operator @xmath107 is known@xcite .",

    "consider now an observer that lives for a finite time .",

    "more precisely , we consider the one parameter group of transformations @xmath124 of the diamond into itself given by @xmath125 since this is a composition of conformal transformations , @xmath126 is a one - parameter subgroup of conformal transformations .",

    ", we have @xmath173 which is the davis - unruh temperature .",
    "therefore , the thermal time hypothesis associates precisely the davis - unruh temperature to a uniformly accelerated observer _ with a finite lifetime _ that passes near the edge . for fixed acceleration @xmath3 ,",
    "an observer with finite lifetime , in the middle of his life , observes the davis - unruh temperature if his lifetime @xmath174 is large enough .",
    "the first order correction in @xmath175 gives @xmath176 while the exact formula for every @xmath22 is given by ( [ exact ] ) .",
    "this result provides a complete generalization of the unruh effect to observers with finite lifetime . in order to better appreciate this result , consider the dependence of the temperature from the proper time . in the limit of large @xmath22 ,",
    "this is given by @xmath177 in figure 1 we have plotted this function in the finite region of the observer proper time .",
    "notice that the function goes rapidly to zero at the boundaries of the interval of the life of the observer , but it is nearly flat over most of the region .",
    "that is , for the observer measuring his proper time , @xmath178 is constant and @xmath179 for most of his lifetime .",
    "next consider the case in which , for a given lifetime @xmath0 , the acceleration is small . in particular , consider the case in which @xmath180 .",
    "this is the observer moving along a straight line from @xmath113 to @xmath114 .",
    "interestingly , the temperature associated to this observer does not vanish . the inverse temperature @xmath61 reaches a maximum value at @xmath16 , which is @xmath181 therefore the thermal time hypothesis associates the finite temperature @xmath182 to an observer with a finite lifetime @xmath0 .",
    "inserting back the dimensional constants @xmath183 and @xmath7 , we get equation ( [ td ] ) .",
    "what is the meaning of this temperature ?",
    "it is tempting to conjecture that this temperature is due to the fact that the observer can not observe all the degrees of freedom of the quantum field . in particular",
    ", he can only observe the degrees of freedom that at time zero are inside the sphere @xmath184 .",
    "because of the quantum field theoretical correlations between the inside and the outside of this sphere , the vacuum state restricted to this sphere is not a pure state .",
    "if this is correct , there should be a physical temperature naturally associated to observers with a finite lifetime , whether they are accelerating or not .",
    "we leave the study of this idea for future investigations ( comparison with entanglement entropy of [ ] may be interesting ) .",
    "for completeness , we describe here also an observer that is born at @xmath113 and lives forever .",
    "the region causally connected to this observer is the future cone @xmath185 of @xmath113 . since this has a non void causal complement , the vacuum restricted to @xmath185 is a separating state and we can search the action of its modular group @xmath186 .",
    "in fact this action is also geometrical .",
    "taking @xmath113 in the origin , it corresponds to the dilatation@xcite @xmath187 as for the wedge and the diamond , we can interpret the orbits of this action as motions of a physical observer .",
    "an inertial observer with constant speed @xmath188 with respect to the origin , which leaves the origin at @xmath145 follows the world line @xmath189 where @xmath190 , @xmath191 with @xmath192 .",

    "starting from the thermal time hypothesis , we have obtained the result that the unruh effect exists also for observers with a finite lifetime . restauring dimensional constants , the thermal time hypothesis associates the temperature ( [ temptau ] ) @xmath197 to an observer living for a finite time and moving with constant finite acceleration @xmath3 between two spacetime points at proper temporal distance @xmath198 from each other .",
