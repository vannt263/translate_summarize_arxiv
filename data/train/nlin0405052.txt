    "the cycle - to - cycle combustion variability has been a subject of interest for many years @xcite .",
    "it is possible that many different disturbances influence the process making it stochastic but in case of high sensitivity on the process conditions one should also consider appearance of chaotic behaviour @xcite .",
    "the pressure signal can be used to control the engine combustion @xcite .",
    "its variations might originate from a complex dynamics leading , presumably with some stochastic component , to non - periodic behaviour .",
    "thus , the crucial problem is to understand the nonlinear dynamics of the process observing the internal pressure inside the cylinder . in the present note",
    "we discuss experimental results of a direct measurement of internal pressure and analyse its time series using the coarse grained entropy method @xcite .",

    "the encoder ( lika c58l ) , due to the engine configuration , was fixed on the camshaft .",

    ", there is no rigid connection between the engine crankshaft and the encoder shaft , therefore synchronisation problems may appear . to overcome this , before each testing session , motored engine tests were accomplished , to determine the shifting between the encoder trigger and pressure maximum peak .",
    "the reference level for the cylinder pressure was established using the intake pressure signal , acquired with an inductive pressure sensor . before each test session , this sensor was calibrated using a simple system containing : a piston pump which creates the calibration pressure , a high precision manometer , a signal amplifier which amplifies the sensor output and a voltmeter @xcite .",

    "using our experimental standing we have measured internal pressure time series for 1000 cycles measuring 6000 points per cycle . in fig .",
    "2 we have plotted pressure against the crank angle @xmath0 for first five consecutive cycles of measured engine work against the crank angle @xmath0 for different torque loadings @xmath1 , 20 and 40 nm . note that with larger loads the peak pressure is higher and the combustion zone concentrates near the tdc .",
    "variations of pressure reflects the efficiency of combustion process in successive cycles .",
    "such a phenomenon is associated with the burned fuel fluctuations and influence negatively on its consumption .",
    "the cyclic fluctuations of pressure in combustion process can be described by its maximal value @xmath2 in each cycle .",
    "interestingly , as it was proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , it is possible to use the maximal values of pressure @xmath3 involved in control process to achieve stable combustion .",
    "the method of peak - to - peak analysis appeared to be useful to analyse some kind of dynamical systems @xcite , as it is in our case .",
    "this peak - to - peak variation is our starting point for further analysis by means of a coarse - grained entropy and an autocorrelation function .    to show its cycle - to - cycle changes we have plotted @xmath2 against successive cycles @xmath4 in fig .",
    "one should note that both , average value of pressure @xmath5 as well as its standard deviation @xmath6 ( fig .",
    "4 ) increase with growing torque @xmath7 .",
    "interestingly , for about @xmath8 we observe the sudden growth of @xmath9 .",
    "this is a result of some diversity of a maximal pressure origin as pressure itself is a complex product of compression and combustion phenomena .",
    "clearly , one can see the intermittent behaviour of @xmath10 ( fig .",
    "3 for @xmath8 and 28 nm ) can be explained in these terms .",
    "lean combustion where the maximum of pressure is produced largely by piston compression with possible ignition missing corresponds to lower level of @xmath10 ( fig .",
    "3 ) while effective combustion happens from time to time corresponds to spikes in fig .",
    "similar effects can be seen for @xmath11 and @xmath12 but not for @xmath13 where the distribution of @xmath10 is going back to a gaussian type .",
    "in the @xmath14 dimensional embedding space @xcite the state is determined by a multidimensional vector @xmath15 where @xmath16 denotes the embedding delay in terms of cycles .",
    "the correlation integral calculated in the embedding space can be defined as @xcite    @xmath17    where @xmath18 is the number of considered points corresponding to pressure peaks in cycles and @xmath19 is the heaviside step function . for simplicity",
    "we use maximum norm .",
    "the correlation integral @xmath20 is related to the correlation entropy @xmath21 and the system correlation dimension @xmath22 by the following formula @xcite    @xmath23    the coarse - grained correlation entropy can be now be calculated as    @xmath24    in such a case the correlation entropy is defined in the limit of a small threshold @xmath25 .    in presence of noise described by the standard deviation @xmath26 of @xmath27 time series , the observed coarse - grained entropy @xmath28 @xcite can be written as @xmath29   \\nonumber \\\\ & \\times & \\left ( 1 + \\sqrt{\\pi } \\frac{\\sqrt { \\varepsilon^2/3 + 2 \\sigma^2 } - \\varepsilon/\\sqrt{3}}{\\varepsilon }    \\right).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    function g@xmath30 , present in the above formula , reads @xmath31    where erf@xmath32 is the error function .",

    "they should be fitted in eq .",
    "( [ eq5 ] ) to mimic the observed noisy entropy calculated from the experimental data .    using the above procedure in analysing the time series of pressure peaks we have calculated the coarse - grained correlation entropy for different loading levels ( @xmath36 , 20 , 28 , 40 , 43 nm ) . fitting it to the last formula ( eq . [ eq5 ] ) it was possible to estimate the noise level @xmath26 . in fig .",
    "[ rys5 ] we present the obtained results with the help of nts parameter defined as follows @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the standard deviation of maximum pressure signal data ( fig .",
    "the error on fig.5 comes from the fitting procedure of eq.(5 ) to observed coarse - grained correlation entropy .",
    "note , the leading tendency is that for higher loading the noise is larger , what is expected for most of the engines with lean combustion .",
    "however the cases of @xmath8 and 43 nm could be the exception of this rule . at @xmath8",
    "we simultaneously observe the first sudden increase of @xmath6 .",
    "it is natural that the overall effect ( eq .",
    "7 ) will cause decreasing of nts .",
    "interestingly , the nodal or very low loading @xmath1 signal ( of @xmath10 ) appears to be influenced more by a compression phenomenon mediated by combustion process ( fig .",
    "2a ) than combustion itself . in this case",
    "@xmath10 is highly correlated . in fig .",
    "[ rys6 ] we show the autocorrelation function for different torque loading @xmath1 , 20 and 40 nm .",
    "note that for the lowest loading ( @xmath1 ) the autocorrelation function does not decrease in contrast to the other cases .",
    "on the other hand at @xmath13 nm ( fig .",
    "5 ) we have to do with a different situation . in that case due to increasing loading",
    "the fresh fuel feeding is of higher level and cycles which misses of ignition do not happen any more . on the other hand for @xmath12 and 43 nm we observe further growing of the signal square deviation @xmath38 with an increasing load . in such conditions",
    "it is not a surprise that in such a case we also observe a lower level of nts .",
    "we applied the coarse - grained entropy method for the experimental data estimating the noise - level . this method",
    "enable to distinguish determined signal , including chaos with its short time prediction scale , and random noise .",
    "analysing our experimental data we decided to use maximal values of pressure @xmath2 . in",
    "all considered cases we have found a relatively high noise level .",
    "however it has appeared that larger loading led to more noisy system . for larger power",
    "the engine needs more fuel .",
    "increase of fluctuation in combustion can happen if the engine work is optimised for the lowest fuel consumption or the exhaust gas toxicity .",
    "another interesting point , discussed in the paper , was connected with a missing ignition effect .",
    "in fact such effects are present for small loading ( figs .",
    "2a - b ) but influence strongly @xmath10 distribution only if loading is large enough .",
    "we have also found that the pressure signal @xmath2 was more correlated ( fig .",
    "6 ) for small loading .",
    "note , the noise level obtained for a correlated signal case by our method can be underestimated by a few percents . a noise component for small loading",
    "can be also related to a well known problem of idle speed engine control difficulties @xcite .",
