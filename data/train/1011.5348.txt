    "entanglement is an exclusive nonclassical resource of quantum mechanics with promising applications in communication , cryptography and computing @xcite .",
    ", this resource is often required to be distributed between different partners ; a request that implies that at least one physical ( sub-)system is to be transmitted through a communication channel . in general , such a coupling of a quantum system to some environmental channel leads to decoherence of the system and usually to loss of entanglement before the state of the system can be further utilized .",
    "therefore , it is of great practical importance to investigate the decoherence and time evolution of entanglement for quantum systems that undergo the action of noisy channels .    typically , the time evolution of entanglement of a system is deduced from studying its state evolution under the influence of decoherence @xcite . following this line ,",
    "we have recently analyzed the entanglement dynamics of initially prepared pure three - qubit ghz and w states if transmitted through one of the pauli channels @xmath0 or a depolarizing channel @xcite . in this work",
    ", we employed the analytical solutions of the master equation as obtained by jung @xcite and a lower bound for the three - qubit concurrence @xcite in order to quantify the time - dependent entanglement of the mixed three - qubit states .    instead of making explicit use of the state evolution for the analysis of the entanglement dynamics of a given system , konrad @xcite recently derived an evolution equation of entanglement for a _ two - qubit _ system that provides a direct relationship between the initial and the final entanglement of the system when",
    "one of its qubits is subjected to an arbitrary noise .",
    "subsequently , li @xcite derived a generalized evolution equation of entanglement for a ( finite dimensional ) _ bipartite _ system , if initially prepared in a pure state and affected by an arbitrary noisy channel .",
    "recently , moreover , this latter result @xcite has been extended to the case of an initial mixed state of a bipartite system @xcite .    in this work , we suggest an evolution equation of entanglement for a _ multi - qubit _ system when one of its qubits undergoes the action of an arbitrary channel , . since there is no an analytically computable measure of entanglement for mixed multi - qubit states @xcite , we shall make use of the lower bound by li @xcite for the multi - qubit concurrence .",
    "in fact , this lower bound was proven to satisfy the general requirements @xcite of an entanglement measure @xcite .",
    "therefore , the evolution equation derived below characterize the entanglement dynamics of multi - qubit states representing a lower bound for an actual currently unavailable entanglement evolution .",
    "as example , we shall discuss in details the time evolution of entanglement of an initially mixed three - qubit state composed of a ghz and a w state @xcite @xmath1 if one of the qubits is affected by a phase or an amplitude damping channel .",
    "for a generalized amplitude damping channel , moreover , we also show the sudden death of entanglement @xcite for this mixed three - qubit state .    in the next section ,",
    "we first recall how the entanglement of a multi - qubit system can be quantified this lower bound was constructed in such a way that it includes only bipartite concurrences according to some `` bi - partite '' cuts of the multi - qubit system . in section .",
    "[ subsec:2.2 ] , we display and discuss the evolution equation of bipartite concurrence as obtained by li @xcite . based on their results for the bipartite concurrence ,",
    "until the present , it has been found difficult to quantify the entanglement of mixed many - partite states , and no general solution is known @xcite apart from wootter s ( two - qubit ) _ concurrence _ @xcite .",
    "this concurrence provides indeed a very powerful measure of entanglement but is just suitable for two - qubit systems .",
    "various extensions of wootter s concurrence have been worked out over the years , and especially for mixed bipartite states , if the dimensions of the associated hilbert ( sub-)spaces are larger than two @xcite . nonetheless , a full generalization of the concurrence towards mixed many - partite states has remained",
    "a challenge until now and will require further studies @xcite . in practice",
    ", however , one is mostly interested in the minimum ( nontrivial ) amount of entanglement @xcite which is preserved in a mixed state of some system when coupled to its environment , for instance , due to transmission of one or several of its subsystems through a communication channel . to this end , various analytically computable lower bounds to concurrence were suggested recently @xcite . in the next section , we shall exploit the lower bound to the multi - qubit concurrence as suggested by li @xcite .",
    "as mentioned before , this bound is based on the bipartite concurrences of the multi - qubit system with regard to some bipartite cuts .",
    "this `` bi - partitioning '' enables us eventually to construct an evolution equation for multi - qubit systems which is based on the evolution equation for bipartite systems @xcite .      for a given _ pure _ n - qubit state @xmath3 ,",
    "the concurrence can be written as @xcite @xmath4 and where the @xmath5 denote the reduced density matrix of the @xmath6-th qubit which is obtained by tracing out the remaining @xmath7 qubits .",
    "since any _ mixed _ state can be expressed also as a convex sum of some pure states @xmath8 : @xmath9 , the definition ( [ c - pure ] ) for the concurrence for pure n - qubit states can be generalized for mixed states by means of the so - called _ convex roof _ @xcite @xmath10 in this latter expression , however , the minimum has to be found with regard to _ all possible _ decompositions of @xmath11 into pure states @xmath12 .",
    "unfortunately , no solution has been found so far to optimize the concurrence ( [ c - mixed ] ) of a multi - qubit system analytically @xcite , apart from the two - qubit systems @xcite and a special case of three qubits @xcite . instead of the computationally demanding optimization of the right - hand side of eq .",

    "let us display this lower bound ( [ low - bound - n ] ) especially for three - qubits , @xmath28 , for which we wish later to describe the entanglement dynamics .",
    "for such states , the lower bound @xmath29 can be written in terms of the three bipartite concurrences that correspond to possible cuts of the two qubits from the remaining one , i.e. @xmath30 the bipartite concurrence @xmath31 ( for @xmath32 and @xmath33 ) are obtained as described above with the help of the operators @xmath34 , where @xmath25 is the generator of the group so(2 ) which is given by the second pauli matrix @xmath35 .",
    "the ( six ) generators @xmath36 of the group so(4 ) that can be expressed explicitly by means of the totally antisymmetric levi - cevita symbol in four dimensions as @xmath37 @xcite .      having the explicit expression ( [ low - bound - n ] ) for the lower bound @xmath38 to the multi - qubit concurrence , we can derive an evolution equation of this entanglement measure .",

    "any pure state @xmath39 can be obtained also from the maximally entangled state @xmath45 of the bipartite system by @xmath46 @xcite . in this notation",
    ", @xmath47 denotes a local ( filtering ) operator @xcite that acts on the first subsystem of the maximally entangled state .",
    "therefore , the final state @xmath11 of the bipartite system can be expressed as @xmath48    since the filtering operator @xmath47 and the noise @xmath43 act only on either the first or second subsystem , it has been shown in @xcite that the reduction of the entanglement of the system under the action of a noisy channel @xmath43 is independent of the initial state @xmath39 , and is bounded from above by the channel s action upon the maximal entangled state @xmath49 .",

    "fortunately , this is possible by following the procedure due to dr @xcite which is simple and just includes the computation of the 3-tangle as described in ref .",
