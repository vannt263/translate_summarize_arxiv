    "determination of physical parameters of astrophysical sources with plasma densities up to @xmath0 @xmath1 should include time - dependent ionization processes .",
    "the cooling time for a completely ionized plasma composed of electrons and ions with charge @xmath2 ( due to free - free radiation alone ; allowing for the recombination emission decreases this time severalfold ) is @xmath3 n_e \\sqrt{t/10 ^ 8}/z   $ ] in real grb , the duration of gamma - ray emission is 1 - 100 s and can be much smaller than the plasma cooling time .",
    "_ x - ray lines in the grb 011211 afterglow_. xmm - newton observations of grb011211 afterglow @xcite 11 hrs after the grb are best fit by a thermal plasma continuum with @xmath4 of several ( 2 - 4 ) kev and emission lines ( identified with highly ionized metal species , except for iron ) faded away over @xmath5 s. in contrast to purely geometrical interpretation of these observations ( which requires a very high density shell with @xmath6 cm ) , our time - dependent approach identifies this time with _ thermal relaxation time _ of a plasma heated by passing gamma - rays up to a temperature of several kev ( deposited energy @xmath7 kev per nucleon ) .",
    "this time implies plasma density @xmath8 @xmath1",
    ". then the observed x - ray emission measure @xmath9 @xmath1 means @xmath10 @xmath11 .    _",
    "need for clouds_. the optical thickness w.r.t .",
    "thompson scattering @xmath12 requires a _ clumpy surroundings _ with the number of clouds @xmath13 of size @xmath14 cm and the total volume providing the required emission measure .",
    "( this is an _ upper limit _ : the realistic cooling function yields @xmath15 @xmath1 for normal cosmic abundance and @xmath16 @xmath1 for plasma without h and he and other elements in solar ratio ) .",
    "the ism with such cloudy properties is common around e.g. late agb stars @xcite .",
    "sub - au clouds of the density @xmath17 @xmath1 were also involved by @xcite to explain the observed short time - scale variability on grb light curves in the external shock scenario .    _",
    "the energy deposit into surroundings_. the required energy deposit per nucleon @xmath18 10 kev limits the external space where such a medium can be heated by gamma rays to the distance @xmath19 where @xmath20 erg is the total isotropic grb energy , @xmath21 is the effective gamma - ray deposition cross section for heating the environment per nucleon @xcite .",
    "this distance is independent of the assumed isotropy / beaming of the grb emission .",
    "again , this distance is strikingly similar to what is needed in the external shock scenario @xcite .",
    "_ grb jet opening angle _",
    "@xmath22 should be specified to calculate the total volume of the circumburst matter illuminated by grb . assuming time delay @xmath23 s to be entirely due to thermal relaxation and not to geometrical retardation yields the relation @xmath24 for small @xmath22 , @xmath25 cm and @xmath26 we get @xmath27 .",
    "such jet collimation angles @xmath28 are common in grb @xcite .",
    "the total illuminated volume is thus @xmath29 @xmath1 which implies the cloud filling factor @xmath30 .",
    "so the physically acceptable structure of clumpy ism can actually be the source of the observed thermal x - rays from grb 011211 .",
    "for example , such a medium can be produced if several hundred late - type stars with strong winds fall within the grb cone .",
    "unusual in our galaxy , this could possibly take place in star - forming galaxies at large redshifts where grb are observed .    _",
    "modeling the x - ray spectrum_. we use time - dependent code to compute the state of ionization and radiation of thermal plasma which include the basic elementary processes ( collisional ionization , autoionization , photorecombination , dielectronic recombination , ion charge exchange ) and computes free - free , free - bound , bound - bound and two - photon emission for ions of all types .",
    "the parameters include time - dependent temperature @xmath4 , density @xmath31 and chemical composition .",
    "the calculated spectral lines are shown in fig .",

    "sp spz214nh1d1e+012 spzme214nh1d1e+010 [ width=.5 ] time evolution of x - ray spectrum ( in the observer frame at the grb redshift @xmath26 ) for different time moments .",
    "* upper panel : * solar composition ; * lower panel : * metal - rich plasma ( without h and he ) .",
    "the grb explosion in an inhomogeneous medium is a generic picture which is responsible for the observed variety of effects in x - ray and optical afterglow light curves ( see @xcite for pioneer study ) .",
    "we consider two possible types of surroundings : a cloudy , patchy medium and a shell - like structure around the grb .",
    "the second case could be identified with an earlier sn explosion or intensive stellar wind of the underlying sn - type event . in both cases ,",
    "a fraction of the grb energy is deposited into the surroundings .",
    "this energy is thermalized and radiated away .",
    "if plasma of the clouds is optically thin , it rapidly cools down .",
    "the time - dependent effects from the `` blue '' ( approaching the observer ) gamma - ray beam are expected on the plasma cooling timescale @xmath32 after the grb , while the reverberation effects could be observed at different wavelengths later on from the `` red '' ( receding ) jet on timescales @xmath33 . here",
    "@xmath34 is time - dependent distance of the photosphere ( if formed ) in the medium from which low - energy photons are generated .",
    "the maximum time the time - dependent effects from the `` red '' beam will be observed is determined by the limiting distance @xmath35 and also by possible hydrodynamical effects .",
    "so the evolving `` sn - like '' features in the optical spectra observed in the afterglow of grb 030329 several days  a month after the burst ( also called sn 2003dh @xcite ) could be a manifestation of such effects and might have no direct relation to sn explosion .    to illustrate how the cooling plasma forms a photosphere , we present the results of lte calculations of plasma opacities as a function of decaying temperature for a fiducial plasma density @xmath36 g/@xmath11 with normal cosmic abundance ( fig .",
    "[ opac ] ) .",
    "the scattering opacity is @xmath37 @xmath38 and is independent of temperature until recombination at low temperatures lowers it down to @xmath39 @xmath38 .",
    "these calculations indicate that up to limiting distances @xmath40 cm ( as appropriate to the case of grb 030329 ) , such a medium remains optically thin for scattering , but a photosphere start forming for hard photons when temperature drops below @xmath41 k.     g/@xmath42 ) with normal abundance . ]    to have an idea what kind of optical events can be expected from clouds illuminated , we apply the multi - group radiation hydrocode stella @xcite to calculate ubv - light curves ( in the grb rest - frame ) .",
    "we assume an energy deposit @xmath43 thermalized in a homogeneous cloud ( @xmath36 g/@xmath42 ) of mass @xmath44 over the grb duration time @xmath45 .",
    "no equilibrium between photons and plasma is assumed .",
    "these calculations are similar to our `` mini - supernova '' model @xcite , but the difference is that here the cloud is transparent for photons so the energy is thermalized within the entire volume of the cloud .",
    "[ large_cl ] shows the light curve for a large ( @xmath46 cm ) cloud with a total mass of @xmath47 , @xmath48 erg , and @xmath49s .",
    "the cloud is heated up to a temperature of @xmath50 k. the optical emission from the cooling cloud continues for more than a month . for comparison , u ( filled triangles ) ,",
    "b ( open squares ) , v ( open circles ) data of a typical plateau type ii sn 1969l are shown .",
    "a very bright optical outburst ( the peak absolute magnitude @xmath51 ) is expected shortly after the energy deposit ( the light travel time correction will somewhat smear the peak on the time scale @xmath52 . )",
    "this effect can be compared with the enigmatic outburst seen in the r afterglow of grb 030329 @xmath53 day after the grb @xcite .",
    "cm after energy deposit @xmath54 erg .",
    "sn 1969l is shown for comparison . ]    a different picture is obtained if we consider a smaller homogeneous cloud with @xmath55 cm and @xmath56 g/@xmath42 ( i.e. like those required to explain non - stationary x - ray emission lines in grb 011211 ) .",
    "an energy deposit of @xmath57 erg into the inner @xmath58 over @xmath59 s heats up the cloud to @xmath60 k. this yields ( fig .",
    "[ mini_cl ] ) @xmath61 . a collection ( @xmath62 ) of such clouds ( patchy presupernova wind ? ) at @xmath40 cm would naturally produce a reverberating optical bump with @xmath63 on the optical light curve of the canonical power - law grb afterglow several weeks after the grb .",
    "it is still to be explored if such clouds can mimic spectrum of a sn ic event spectroscopically identified in grb 030329 @xcite .",

    "time - dependent thermal plasma effects from grb surroundings should manifest in x - ray and lower energy afterglows of a grb twofold :    \\(1 ) shortly after grb ( on the plasma cooling time scale determined by density , chemical composition and the energy deposited over the grb emission time ) thermal effects may be produced by plasma heated up by the `` blue '' grb jet .",
    "the fading x - ray emission lines in grb 011211 may provide an example .",
    "( 2 ) at later times , variable thermal optical features can be observed superimposed on the underlying non - thermal afterglow continuum due to the contribution from cooling clouds / shells heated by the receding ( `` red '' ) grb jet on timescales limited by the most remote clouds @xmath35 .",
    "optical afterglows of grb 021004 and grb 030329 deviating from pure power - law can provide the example .",
