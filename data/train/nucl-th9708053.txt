    "ultrarelativistic heavy - ion collisions at rhic and lhc aim towards an understanding of nuclear matter properties under the extreme conditions of high energy density and small ( net ) baryon number density @xcite .",
    "lattice simulations of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) predict the occurrence of a ( phase ) transition between ordinary hadronic matter and a phase of restored chiral symmetry , where quarks and gluons are deconfined , at a temperature @xmath6 mev @xcite .",
    "such a phase , commonly termed quark  gluon plasma ( qgp ) @xcite , is believed to have existed in the early universe .",
    "the relative smallness of @xmath7 ( in comparison to the electroweak transition temperature ) will , for the first time , enable us to study a phase transition predicted by one of the fundamental theories of matter under laboratory conditions .    in order to assess whether the qgp can be re - created in ultrarelativistic heavy - ion collisions ,",
    "high - energy nuclear theorists are challenged to clarify whether highly excited nuclear matter can actually equilibrate on time scales that are short enough such that ( local ) temperatures still exceed @xmath7 .",
    "if matter equilibrates at later times , the system will already have decayed into hadrons . then",
    ", possible experimental signatures of the high - energy - density phase might be washed out by more complicated and thus less well understood non - equilibrium phenomena .",
    "the issue of equilibration requires understanding of the kinetic processes in the pre - equilibrium phase of an ultrarelativistic nuclear collision .",
    "these , in turn , can only be understood knowing the initial conditions for the collision in the first place . recently",
    ", mclerran and venugopalan @xcite have made considerable progress in that direction . in their model of an ultrarelativistic nucleus , the valence partons act as a classical color source for small@xmath8 gluons with transverse momenta @xmath9 , where @xmath10 mev is the qcd scale parameter and @xmath2 the transverse color charge density of an ultrarelativistic nucleus .",
    "the reason why the color source can be treated classically is the following : gluons with sufficiently small @xmath8 do not resolve the nuclear substructure , the ( lorentz - contracted ) nucleus appears coherent in longitudinal direction . in transverse direction",
    ", color is of course confined on scales larger than the nucleon s size .",
    "the transverse momenta of the respective gluons are , however , sufficiently high to coherently probe the colored interior of individual colorless nucleons .",
    "therefore , all valence partons throughout the longitudinal extension of the nucleus and inside a transverse area @xmath11 add up to the color source `` seen '' by these gluons .",
    "obviously , the transverse color charge density @xmath2 grows like @xmath12 and thus becomes large for heavy nuclei .",
    "the color charge in a given transverse area is therefore in a high - dimensional representation of the color algebra , and thus essentially classical .",
    "the original model of mclerran and venugopalan has recently been extended to include contributions of the sea partons @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the color charge density @xmath2 has been calculated in a more microscopic model of the nucleus @xcite and limitations of the classical approach have been pointed out @xcite .",
    "also , the classical gluon field produced in a collision of two such nuclei has been computed in a perturbative scheme @xcite and has been shown to agree with perturbative gluon bremsstrahlung as calculated in @xcite . the classical field was shown to have a quantum interpretation as a coherent state @xcite .",

    " time structure of the classical gluon field computed in @xcite and investigate its stability .",
    "it is well known that , in contrast to abelian theories , non - abelian gauge fields are in general classically unstable , due to their spin ",
    "field interaction with the corresponding gyromagnetic ratio for the gluon ( see for instance @xcite ) . a well - known case of this instability",
    "is the decay of a constant color - magnetic field @xcite .",
    "the dynamical instabilities have been shown to generate classical chaos @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it was demonstrated @xcite that they lead to inelastic final states in high - energy collisions of wave packets .",
    "here we shall show that the gluon field produced in ultrarelativistic nuclear collisions has at least one unstable mode throughout the evolution of the system .",
    "the growth rate of the instability is determined to be of order @xmath0 .",
    "the unstable mode originates from the self - interactions described by the non - abelian terms in the yang ",
    "mills equations , which have been neglected in the perturbative solution @xcite .",
    "since these self - interactions may , under favorable conditions , lead to thermalization , the rate of growth of the instability also sets the time scale for thermalization of the produced ( classical ) gluon field .",

    "the rate of growth @xmath157 of the instability is , however , at least for initial times @xmath158 of order @xmath159 .",
    "the existence of such instabilities and the order of magnitude of their rate of growth is remarkably stable against variations in the strength of the color field , @xmath160 .",
    "for instance , at early times @xmath158 , the exponential growth of the most unstable mode is only about a factor 2 stronger for @xmath160 being an order of magnitude larger , and only about a factor of 3 smaller if @xmath160 is decreased by an order of magnitude . since the field strengths in the present case are proportional to @xmath160 , cf .",
    "( [ ax0][a0z ] ) , this suggest a power ",
    "law dependence @xmath161 , in rough agreement with the one found in the previous subsection , @xmath162 .",
    "in this work we have explicitly shown the space  time structure of the classical gluon field produced in a collision between two ultrarelativistic color charges .",
    "the gluon field radiated in a nuclear collision is , to first order , a superposition of such fields .",
    "we have demonstrated that this field is unstable against perturbations on account of the non - abelian terms in the yang ",
    "mills equations .",
    "the self - interaction of the produced gluon field represented by these terms has been neglected in the perturbative approach of refs .",
    "@xcite to construct the solution .",
    "our results are in agreement with earlier studies of classical instabilities in non - abelian gauge theories @xcite , and once more emphasize that the transverse field degrees of freedom are of crucial importance for the dynamics of high - energy collisions .",
    "the growth rate of the instability was found to scale with the inverse distance between color charges , @xmath163 .",
    "this implies that , in collisions of large ensembles of color charges ( such as nuclear collisions ) , it should scale like the square root of the transverse area density of color charges , @xmath164 , since on the average the distance between color charges in the transverse plane decreases inversely proportional to the root of their area density @xmath2 .",
    "this argument is supported by the fact that on the average the gluon field energy density @xmath165 ( cf .  the calculation of the field energy in @xcite ) , such that @xmath166 , which was found to be proportional to the square root of the field strength , should scale as @xmath167 .",
    "we can also find the dependence on the coupling constant .",
    "the gluon field strength @xmath168 is proportional to @xmath83 , and the results of section iv.b suggest @xmath169 .",
    "this result is not unexpected , since this is the only combination of the coupling constant and the single dimensional scale in the problem , which does not contain @xmath170 and hence can occur in a classical theory .",
    "the results of section iv.c indicate that the coefficient @xmath171 in the relation @xmath172 is of order unity , such that @xmath173 ( @xmath174 for all practical purposes ) .",
    "as has been found in section iv.c , the uncertainty is only a factor of 2 , even if the strength of the color field varies by an order of magnitude . identifying the thermalization time scale @xmath175 , for @xmath176 mev , as estimated by the authors of @xcite for rhic collisions",
    ", we can expect thermalization times of the order of @xmath177 fm . for lhc , @xmath178 gev , and @xmath179 fm .",
    "this is in agreement with estimates of the equilibration time deduced from the maximum lyapunov exponent in random ensembles of classical su(2 ) and su(3 ) gauge fields @xcite .",
    "surprisingly , this equilibration time scale of classical color fields agrees also with estimates for the time scale for _ kinetic _ equilibrium due to collisions between `` hard '' field quanta @xcite .",
    "given the fact that the latter results were obtained based on a conceptually quite different framework , the agreement is truly remarkable .",
    "we conclude that with equilibration time scales of this order the odds for producing an equilibrated qgp in rhic and lhc collisions seem to be good .",
