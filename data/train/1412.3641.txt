    "ultracold gases of trapped atoms offer unique opportunities to study fermionic many - body systems under clean and adjustable conditions .",
    "in particular , by tuning the magnetic field around a feshbach resonance , one can realize either a repulsive or an attractive interaction , passing through the `` unitary limit '' where the scattering length @xmath0 diverges .",
    "especially this `` unitary fermi gas '' has attracted a lot of attention because it has `` universal '' properties ( there is no scale depending on the interaction strength ) and it has some similarities with completely different systems such as low - density neutron matter .",
    "a very interesting aspect of these strongly correlated atomic gases are the different dynamical regimes they can be in : they can be superfluid or normal - fluid , and in the normal - fluid phase hydrodynamic to collisionless behavior can be realized depending on interaction strength and temperature .",
    "experimentally , the transition between these regimes has been seen , e.g. , by studying the frequency and damping rates of the radial quadrupole mode @xcite .",
    "another source of information is the free expansion ( i.e. , after the trap is switched off ) of an anisotropic gas , which is very different in the ballistic and in the hydrodynamic regime @xcite .",
    "surprisingly , the low viscosity of the unitary fermi gas observed in this way @xcite seems to indicate some analogies even with the quark - gluon plasma created in ultrarelativistic heavy - ion collisions @xcite .    in the normal phase",
    ", the transition between hydrodynamic and collisionless regimes can be described by the boltzmann equation @xcite .",
    "the test - particle method for the numerical solution of the boltzmann equation has been used for many years in the field of heavy - ion collisions @xcite and more recently also for ultracold atoms @xcite . in this article , we extend the method developed in @xcite in order to simulate realistic systems ( trap geometry and particle number ) . at the same time , we include in - medium effects into the calculation , namely the `` mean - field '' potential @xcite and the in - medium cross - section @xcite , obtained within a t matrix theory .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : methods ] , we briefly recall the boltzmann equation with in - medium effects and explain the test - particle method we use to solve it numerically , concentrating mainly on elements which are new as compared to ref .  @xcite .",
    "then we describe in sec .",
    "[ sec : tests ] some tests of the reliability of the code . in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] , we discuss as first applications of the code the simulation of different anisotropic expansion experiments of the duke group @xcite and the radial quadrupole mode as measured at innsbruck @xcite . in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] we conclude and discuss perspectives for future work .    throughout the article",
    ", we use units with @xmath1 ( @xmath2 reduced planck constant , @xmath3 boltzmann constant ) .",
    "we study a two - component @xmath4 ) ultra - cold gas of @xmath5 atoms of mass @xmath6 with attractive interaction ( scattering length @xmath7 ) in an external potential @xmath8 .",
    "even if we will restrict the numerical implementation of the in - medium effects to the case of a spin balanced ( @xmath9 ) system , we keep the notation general .",
    "we will only consider the normal - fluid phase , i.e. , temperatures @xmath10 above the superfluid transition temperature @xmath11 . in this case , the dynamics of the system can be described with a distribution function @xmath12 which satisfies the boltzmann equation @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the collision integral ( see below ) and @xmath15 is the sum of the forces resulting from the external potential @xmath8 and from the mean field @xmath16 .",
    "the trap potential @xmath17 is essentially given by a time independent anisotropic harmonic trap @xmath18 ( in the cylindrically symmetric case , we use @xmath19 ) which defines the time and length scales @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "in addition to the static harmonic potential , @xmath17 can have a time dependent contribution , e.g. , in order to excite a collective mode ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "the density per spin state and the number of atoms of species @xmath23 are obtained from the distribution function as @xmath24    the right - hand side ( r.h.s . ) of the boltzmann equation ( [ eq : boltzmann ] ) describes the collisions between particles of opposite spin .",
    "it thus depends on the differential scattering cross section @xmath25 .",
    "if we consider , e.g. , the @xmath26 component , it reads explicitly : @xmath27,\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where , in the first term , @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the incoming and outgoing momenta , respectively , while in the second term , the roles are exchanged .",
    "we adopted the short - hand notation @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "since we consider only @xmath32-wave interactions , the cross section does not depend on the scattering angle @xmath33 and we simply have @xmath34 . in free space , it depends only on the relative momentum @xmath35 and is given by @xmath36 when in - medium effects are taken into account ( see sec .",
    "[ ss : inmed_xsec ] ) , there is of course no such simple form .      in this article",
    ", we use the test - particle method described , e.g. , in @xcite , but generalized to the case @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the number of test particles per atom .",
    "this case is of course of practical interest since it allows us to simulate a large number @xmath39 of real particles with a smaller number @xmath40 of test particles .",
    "however , the problem of a correct sampling of the phase space immediately arises .",
    "as discussed in detail in @xcite , the main problem when reducing the number of test particles is that one can not resolve any more the step of the distribution function at the fermi surface .",
    "this is , however , crucial for the description of pauli blocking of collisions .",
    "the resolution can be reduced at finite temperature since the fermi surface gets smoothed out . in the unitary limit , the superfluid transition temperature @xmath11 is already of the order of @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the fermi temperature defined in the usual way by @xmath43 ( which is lower than the local fermi temperature in the center of the trap ) .",
    "since we are anyway forced to stay above @xmath11 , we can work with a smaller number of test particles .",
    "the test - particle method consists of writing the ( non - equilibrium ) distribution function as @xmath44 where @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the position and momentum of the @xmath47-th test particle at time @xmath48 . in practice ,",
    "the first @xmath49 test particles represent atoms with spin @xmath26 , while the remaining @xmath50 test particles represent atoms with spin @xmath51 . to simplify the notation , we use the convention that the index @xmath52 runs from @xmath53 to @xmath54 , the index @xmath55 from @xmath56 to @xmath40 , and the index @xmath47 from @xmath53 to @xmath57 .    with the test - particle method , the l.h.s . of the boltzmann equation",
    "is replaced by a set of @xmath58 classical equations of motion @xmath59 to solve these equations , a particular attention has to be paid to the efficiency and numerical accuracy . for our simulations , we use the velocity verlet algorithm as in @xcite .",
    "the collision term is simulated by scattering two test particles of opposite spin by a random angle if their distance becomes smaller than that corresponding to the cross section ( see @xcite for details ) . to take pauli blocking into account ,",
    "the collision is only performed with a probability given by @xmath60 .    of course , the @xmath61 functions in eq .",
    "( [ ftestparticle ] ) can not be used to obtain meaningful numbers for the pauli - blocking factors @xmath60 . the usual way to avoid this problem is to consider gaussian distributions in @xmath62 and @xmath63 spaces instead of the dirac ones . in the calculation of the pauli - blocking factors , we therefore replace @xmath64 with @xmath65 , where @xmath66 and @xmath67 in contrast to the gaussian used in @xcite , the above gaussian @xmath68 takes explicitly into account the deformed shape of the gas . to be specific ,",
    "the widths appearing in the above equation are defined from an average width @xmath69 as @xmath70 where @xmath71 . in this way",
    "we exploit the fact that the typical length scales on which the distribution function varies , given by the trap potential , can be very different in the three spatial directions .",
    "the values of @xmath69 and @xmath72 must be chosen such that they smooth the statistical fluctuations due to the finite number of test particles but resolve the structure of the distribution function @xmath73 ( see @xcite for details ) .",

    "we transform @xmath74 into temperature @xmath10 by calculating @xmath74 with our equilibrium density profile including the mean field @xmath75 .",
    "the system is initialized with the given parameters in the anisotropic trap , then the trap potential is switched off except for the weak magnetic potential @xmath76 which was present in the experiments during the expansion and which affects merely the expansion in @xmath77 direction .    in the upper row of fig .",
    "[ fig : expansion ]        we display the column density @xmath78 in the @xmath79 plane at different times @xmath48 after the beginning of the expansion , for initial conditions corresponding to the experiment of ref .",
    "@xcite with @xmath80 .",
    "one can clearly see the inversion of the aspect ratio during the expansion . to quantify this",
    ", we apply the same procedure as in the analysis of the experiment @xcite and determine the cloud widths @xmath81 and @xmath82 by fitting the density profile with a gaussian @xmath83 the error of this fit is shown in the lower row of fig .",
    "[ fig : expansion ] , it does not exceed @xmath84 of the central density . in the center",
    ", one sees the numerical noise coming from the finite number of test particles ( @xmath85 ) used in the simulation .",
    "however , in the peripheral regions , where the density is low , we see systematic deviations : in @xmath86 direction , the cloud is smaller and in @xmath87 direction it is larger than the fitted gaussian .",
    "this indicates that the expansion does not exactly follow a scaling law of the form @xmath88 as assumed in previous analyses @xcite .",
    "this is not very surprising since one would expect that at the beginning of the expansion , the central part of the cloud follows viscous hydrodynamics and becomes ballistic at later times , while the dilute peripheral part of the cloud expands ballistically from the beginning .    the time dependence of the aspect ratio of the expanding cloud , i.e. , the ratio of the fitted cloud widths @xmath89 , is displayed in fig .  [ fig : compareelliott ]     of the expanding cloud in the simulation of the experiment by elliott et al .",

    "our result agrees very well with the experimental data . for comparison , we also show as the dashed line what one obtains if one defines the aspect ratio as @xmath90 .",
    "the discrepancy between the two curves comes from the ballistic low - density part discussed above .",
    "we also studied the influence of the in - medium effects on the expansion .",
    "apparently the effects of mean field and in - medium cross section practically cancel each other if the simulations with and without in - medium effects are made with the same initial temperature @xmath91 .",
    "however , the mean field is necessary to get the correct relation between the experimental observable @xmath92 and the temperature @xmath91 . the dash - dot line in fig .",
    "[ fig : compareelliott ] represents the result for the aspect ratio obtained with mean field but without in - medium effects in the cross section .",
    "since the collision rate with the free cross section @xmath93 is lower than the one with the in - medium cross section @xmath94 , the inversion of the aspect ratio is somewhat weaker than the one obtained in the full calculation .",
    "however , the difference is too small to make a conclusive statement whether the result with or without in - medium cross section is in better agreement with the experimental data .    in fig .",

    "the dotted lines show the limiting cases of an ideal hydrodynamic ( @xmath98 ) and a purely ballistic expansion .",
    "one observes that with increasing temperature , the behavior of the system becomes less hydrodynamic and approaches the collisionless regime .",
    "the same behavior is seen in the experimental data .",
    "although the agreement between simulation and experiment is not as good as in the case @xmath80 , it is satisfactory for a theory which does not have any adjustable parameter .",
    "since in the case of the expansion the calculation is quite simple ( one simulation per expansion ) , we were in this case able to increase the number of test particles and to reduce the time step by factors of two ( cf .",
    "table  [ tab : numericalparameters ] ) . however , already with the smaller number of test particles and the larger time step we obtained practically the same results as shown in figs .",

    "we consider a trapped gas in the unitary limit with the same characteristics as in the experiment of ref .",
    "@xcite , see table  [ tab : expinnsbruck ] .",
    "the quadrupole mode is then excited at @xmath99 by giving all particles a kick @xmath100 ( we use @xmath101 ) and we compute as observable the quadrupole moment @xmath102 to extract the frequency @xmath103 and damping rate @xmath104 of the quadrupole mode from the response @xmath105 , we fit it with a function of the form @xmath106 the motivation for the choice of this form , including the non - oscillating exponential with decay constant @xmath107 , is two - fold : it is similar to the fit function used in the experimental analysis @xcite , and it coincides with the form of the response one obtains analytically within the first - order moment method @xcite .    figure  [ fig : quad ]     instead of the unitary limit to avoid the divergence of the cross section for particles moving in parallel at the same speed .",
    "the dotted horizontal lines at @xmath108 and @xmath109 correspond to the frequencies of the quadrupole mode in the hydrodynamic collisionless limits , respectively .",
    "[ fig : quad ] ]    shows the temperature dependence of the frequency ( a ) and the damping rate ( b ) of the radial quadrupole mode of the gas whose parameters are given in table  [ tab : expinnsbruck ] .",
    "results obtained with and without in - medium effects ( @xmath94 , @xmath75 ) are shown as solid and dashed lines , respectively .",
    "the data points are the experimental results from ref .",
    "the irregularities of our results give an idea of the numerical error .",
    "because of the finite number of test particles , the results for @xmath105 are somewhat noisy , especially at large times when the amplitude of the mode has strongly decreased .",
    "this leads to some uncertainties in the fitted values of @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",
    "our calculations are globally in good agreement with the data .",
    "the influence of the in - medium effects is surprisingly weak .",
    "this is in contrast with @xcite where it was found within the second - order moments method that with in - medium effects , the collisionless regime was reached at too high temperature .",
    "later it was shown that compared with a numerical solution of the boltzmann equation , the second - order moments method tends to overestimate the collision effects @xcite , and that by extending the moments method to fourth order the discrepancy between the results with in - medium cross section and the experimental data was somewhat reduced @xcite . if one assumes that the moments method converges to the full solution of the boltzmann equation , the present results suggest that even higher orders in the moments method would further reduce the influence of the in - medium modification of the cross section .",
    "however , we see that at @xmath110 , the in - medium effects lead to a somewhat lower frequency , which is closer to the data and to the hydrodynamic result @xmath111 .",
    "furthermore , the maximum damping near @xmath112 is stronger and in better agreement with the data if in - medium effects are included .",
    "unfortunately , the mean field @xmath75 can not explain the experimental frequencies @xmath113 around @xmath114 , although an attractive mean field is able to increase the frequency of the quadrupole mode in the collisionless limit to values above @xmath115 @xcite .",
    "since our numerical solution of the boltzmann equation has the necessary flexibility , we can go a step further in our analysis and simulate more closely the experimental procedure . to that end",
    ", we excite the mode as before and let the system oscillate for some time @xmath116 , then we switch the trap off and let the system expand during @xmath117 ms @xcite .",
    "then we calculate the quadrupole moment after the expansion , @xmath118 .",
    "we repeat the procedure for 50 different values of @xmath119 from @xmath120 to @xmath121 ( corresponding to @xmath122 ms ) .",
    "therefore , the whole calculation is very time consuming .",
    "examples for the quadrupole moment after expansion as a function of @xmath116 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : quad_exp_example ]     and subsequent expansion during @xmath123 , for two different initial temperatures @xmath124 ( a ) and @xmath125 ( b ) .",
    "the circles show the results of the simulation with in - medium effects , while the solid line corresponds to the fit by eq .",
    "( [ eq : quad_tof_fit ] ) .",
    "the system parameters are the same as in fig .",
    "[ fig : quad ] .",
    "[ fig : quad_exp_example ] ]    ( circles ) for two different initial temperatures .",
    "in contrast to the case without expansion @xcite , we see that @xmath126 does not vanish for @xmath127 .",
    "the reason is easy to understand : the excitation by the kick ( [ eq : kick ] ) does not immediately create a quadrupole moment , but a quadrupolar velocity field . during the expansion ,",
    "this is transformed into a quadrupole moment .",
    "therefore , if we want to determine the frequency @xmath103 and damping @xmath104 , we have to modify the fit function and use instead of eq .",
    "( [ eq : quad_fit ] ) the more general form @xcite @xmath128 the fitted functions are also shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : quad_exp_example ] .",
    "one can see that , because of the strong damping , the response for @xmath124 ( a ) shows only a single oscillation and is dominated by numerical noise for @xmath129 .",
    "the determination of @xmath103 and @xmath104 by the fit with eq .",
    "( [ eq : quad_tof_fit ] ) is thus not very precise in this case ( as mentioned before , the same problem limits also the precision of @xmath103 and @xmath104 in the case without expansion ) . at @xmath130 ( b ) , the damping is weaker , and we get a higher precision .",
    "we repeat this procedure for a couple of temperatures .",
    "the results for @xmath103 and @xmath104 are displayed as the squares in fig .",
    "[ fig : quad_exp ] .    , but the results were obtained from the quadrupole moment with ( squares ) and without ( solid lines ) expansion ( both include in - medium effects ) . ]    comparing these results with those obtained without expansion ( solid lines ) , one concludes that the expansion before the measurement of the quadrupole moment does not affect the extracted frequencies and damping rates .",
    "there is one temperature where some discrepancy is visible , namely @xmath131 , but as discussed before , the precise extraction of the values @xmath103 and @xmath104 is difficult in this region of strong damping .",
    "in this paper , we described an extension of the test - particle method of ref .",
    "@xcite for the numerical solution of the boltzmann equation for ultracold trapped fermi gases in the normal phase .",
    "the main improvements are the possibility to treat realistic particle numbers in realistic ( strongly elongated ) trap geometries and the inclusion of the mean field and of the in - medium - modifications of the cross section , calculated within a t matrix approximation .",
    "this method allows us to simulate several recent experiments on the non - equilibrium dynamics of unpolarized fermi gases in the normal - fluid phase .    as a first example",
    ", we studied the anisotropic expansion of a unitary fermi gas as measured in refs .",
    "@xcite for temperatures @xmath132 . without any adjustable parameter",
    ", we obtain an excellent agreement with the time dependence of the aspect ratio measured in ref .",
    "@xcite and an overall reasonable agreement with the data of ref .",
    "we notice that the peripheral region of the cloud is never hydrodynamic and does not follow the scaling law which approximately describes the expansion .",
    "then we discussed the radial quadrupole mode as measured in ref .",
    "again , we find that the numerical solution of the boltzmann equation gives a reasonably good description of the data .",
    "in particular , the influence of in - medium effects on the frequency and damping rate of the quadrupole mode seems to be much weaker than in approximate solutions of the boltzmann equation based on the method of phase - space moments , where it was found to deteriorate the agreement with the data @xcite .",
    "we also show that the expansion before the measurement of the deformation of the cloud does not affect the final results for frequency and damping .",
    "these examples show that , if solved correctly , the boltzmann equation is able to describe out - of equilibrium processes of unpolarized fermi gases , even in the strongly interacting regime ( unitary limit ) , at a quantitative level , at least at not too low temperatures . note that even at @xmath124 , only in a very small part of the trapped gas the temperature is close to the local @xmath11 where one would expect pseudogap effects to invalidate the boltzmann equation . of course",
    ", the boltzmann equation is not applicable below the superfluid transition temperature ( @xmath41 for a trapped gas ) .    since our boltzmann code reproduces the anistroptic expansion experiments of refs .",
    "@xcite , it would be interesting to adapt it to calculate directly the temperature dependence of the shear viscosity @xmath133 , and to compare it with the one extracted from the experiments under relatively strong assumptions ( a refined analysis was made in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in principle",
    ", the result should be similar to that of refs .",
    "@xcite , where the viscosity was also calculated from the boltzmann equation with in - medium effects .",
    "a challenging subject for future work would be the description of shock waves as studied experimentally in @xcite by splitting the initial cloud into two and letting them collide in @xmath77 direction .",
    "the difficulty of this problem compared to the phenomena studied in the present work is the rapid change of the distribution function on a short length scale in the direction of the long axis of the trap .",
    "also a quantitative description of the collision of two spin - polarized clouds with opposite polarization as in the experiment of ref .",
    "@xcite is still missing . on a qualitative level , it was already shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that the boltzmann equation without in - medium effects can reproduce the different regimes ( bounce , transmission ) that were experimentally observed .",
    "what is particularly difficult in this case is the inclusion of in - medium effects , since the t matrix approximation used in the present work fails in the polarized case .",
    "a step into this direction was undertaken in ref .",
    "depending on the temperature , we use two different strategies to approximate the in - medium cross section .      at low temperature",

    "<S> using the test - particle method , we solve numerically the boltzmann equation for an ultra - cold gas of trapped fermions with realistic particle number and trap geometry in the normal phase . </S>",
    "<S> we include a mean - field potential and in - medium modifications of the cross - section obtained within a t matrix formalism . </S>",
    "<S> after some tests showing the reliability of our procedure , we apply the method to realistic cases of practical interest , namely the anisotropic expansion of the cloud and the radial quadrupole mode oscillation . </S>",
    "<S> our results are in good agreement with experimental data . </S>",
    "<S> although the in - medium effects significantly increase the collision rate , we find that they have only a moderate effect on the anisotropic expansion and on frequency and damping rate of the quadrupole mode . </S>"
