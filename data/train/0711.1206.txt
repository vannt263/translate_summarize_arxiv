    "two uncharged parallel conducting plates attract .",
    "casimir in 1948  @xcite demonstrated that this force of attraction can be attributed to the quantum vacuum energy associated with the electromagnetic field between the conducting plates .",
    "precision measurement of this force since 1997  @xcite being invoked as an evidence of zero - point energy of the vacuum has been questioned in  @xcite .",
    "the controversy arises due to the presence of divergences which make it difficult to extract self energies for single bodies . the local energy density , a component of the stress tensor , serves as a source to gravity .",
    "surface divergences in the local energy densities cause a serious difficulty in attempts to understand how the vacuum energy interacts with gravity .    in fall",
    "i  @xcite we demonstrated , using variational principles , that the gravitational force on casimir energy is the same as that on a conventional mass .",
    "in fall ii  @xcite we considered the motion of a casimir apparatus undergoing a constant acceleration . the casimir apparatus consisted of semi - transparent parallel plates , realized by background fields consisting of delta function potentials , which induced boundary conditions on a massless scalar field .",
    "the motion of the apparatus was studied in the accelerated frame of reference , described by rindler coordinates , in which it experiences a pseudo - force .",
    "this fictitious force is equated to the gravitational force by the principle of equivalence .",
    "we concluded that casimir energy , including the divergent contributions , falls under gravity like conventional mass .",
    "we made the remarkable observation that the divergent contributions to casimir energy could be suitably interpreted as renormalizing the bare masses of the individual casimir plates .",
    "saharian et al .",
    "@xcite , using zeta function technique for regularization , earlier reached at a similar conclusion for the finite part of the casimir energy .",
    "thus , in fall i and ii , which has been summarized and submitted to this proceedings by k a milton  @xcite , we have convincingly demonstrated that casimir energy falls like conventional mass in a weak gravitational field .",
    "to further verify our conclusion we here study the centripetal force acting on a rotating casimir apparatus .",
    "firstly , we use this opportunity to refine our definition of the force on the energy associated with the field .",
    "next , we consider a casimir apparatus rotating with constant angular speed such that the surfaces of the plates remain parallel to the tangent to the circle of rotation .",
    "we use appropriate curvilinear coordinates to transform into the accelerated frame of reference .",
    "we demonstrate that , exactly as in the case of rindler acceleration , the casimir energy , including its divergent parts , experiences a centripetal force exactly like a conventional mass .",
    "we express the centripetal acceleration in terms of the center of inertia of the apparatus .",
    "finally , we consider a rotating casimir apparatus such that the plates makes an arbitrary angle with respect to the tangent to the circle .",
    "we demonstrate that the centripetal force is independent of the orientation of the casimir apparatus in a frame in which the center of inertia evaluates to zero .",
