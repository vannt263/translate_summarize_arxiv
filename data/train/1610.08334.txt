    "the search for understanding the cosmological vacuum has been the issue of hard investigations@xcite .",
    "several models have been suggested@xcite in order to postulate the existence of a quantum vacuum ( e.g : fluid of zeldovich ) , but without proposing a physical interpretation for the vacuum until the emergence of symmetrical special relativitty ( ssr)@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite , which has brought a new interpretation for the quantum vacuum by means of the concept of an invariant minimum speed , which changes the causal structure of spacetime and geometrizes the quantum phenomena@xcite .",
    "this minimum speed modifies the basic metric of spacetime by provinding a metric of type de - sitter ( ds ) .",
    "such a metric describes the geometric structure of the gravitational bose einstein condensate ( gbec ) , which represents the core of a gravastar@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite @xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "so we are able to map them in such a way that we can associate the cosmological constant with the minimum speed connected to the vacuum energy density@xcite .",
    "we still associate the star s compactness with a factor that include the minimum speed in a type of ds - metric .",
    "thus by linking the star structure equations with the causal structure of spacetime of ssr , a phase transition appears in place of the horizon of event as postulated by chapline and other@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "such a phase transition can be related to this new causal structure of ssr , as nassif has demonstrated in ref.@xcite , where ssr describes perfectly a fluid which is similar to a relativistic superfluid of type of cosmological fluid , being the constituent of gbec .    in the 2nd .",
    "section , we introduce the concept of a minimum speed given in the intergalactic spacetime with the presence of a weak gravitational field@xcite .",

    "section , we introduce the gbec .",
    "we make a brief study about the concept of phase transition that appears in place of the horizon of event for the gravitational collapse .    in section 4",
    ", we discuss the relationship between the concepts of ssr and gbec , where we apply the concepts of ssr to gbec of a gravastar / dark energy star by relating ds - metric with ssr metric .",

    "we also introduce the typical quantum concepts of ssr that appear naturally in tov equation by showing how difficult is to penetrate the core of a gravastar ( gbec ) .",

    "we aim to obtain the spacetime metric in such a region where we verify that the metric does not diverge as occurs in the classical case for the schwarzchild radius ( no phase transition ) .",
    "we show that there is no divergence at such a transition region due to the fact that the coexistence radius of phases is slightly larger than the schwarzchild radius by preventing the singularity .",
    "a breakdown of the lorentz symmetry for very low energies@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite generated by the presence of a residual ( weak ) background gravitational field creates a new causal structure in spacetime , where we have a mimimum speed @xmath0 that is unattainable for all particles , and also a universal dimensionless constant @xmath1@xcite , which couples the gravitational field to the electromagnetic one , namely :    @xmath2    where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are respectively the mass of the proton and electron .",

    "the breaking of the lorentz symmetry group destroys the properties of the transformations of special relativity ( sr ) and so generates intriguing kinematics and dynamics for speeds very close to the minimum speed @xmath0 , i.e. , for @xmath9 , we find new relativistic effects such as the contraction of the improper time and the dilation of space@xcite . in this new scenario ,",
    "the proper time also suffers relativistic effects such as its own dilation with regard to the improper one when @xmath9@xcite@xcite , namely :    @xmath10    since the minimum speed @xmath0 is an invariant quantity as the speed of light @xmath11 , so @xmath0 does not alter the value of the speed @xmath12 of any particle .",
    "therefore we have called ultra - referential @xmath13@xcite@xcite as being the preferred ( background ) reference frame in relation to which we have the speeds @xmath12 of any particle . in view of this , the reference frame transformations change substantially in the presence of @xmath14 , as follow below :     and the unattainable minimum speed @xmath0 , which is a definitely prohibited boundary for any particle .",

    "we can say that ssr geometrizes the quantum phenomena as investigated before ( the uncertainty principle)@xcite in order to allow us to associate quantities belonging to the microscopic world with a new geometric structure that originates from a lorentz symmetry breaking .",
    "thus ssr may be a candidate to try to solve the problems associated with the gravitational collapse , which is a phenomenon that mixes inevitably quantum quantities with geometric structure of spacetime .",
    "in this section we present the energy - momentum tensor@xcite which describes a relativistic superfluid .",

    "such a background vector @xmath56 is related to the background reference frame ( ultra - referential ) @xmath14 , leading to lorentz violation .",

    "the core of a gravastar / dark energy star is described as being composed of an exotic material called gravitational bose einstein condensate ( gbec)@xcite@xcite@xcite . this is a relativistic superfluid as reported in the previous section .",
    "this region connects with a shell of ordinary matter ( baryonic matter ) described by the schwarzschild metric .",
    "such a connection would take place by means of a phase transition in spacetime@xcite@xcite@xcite that occurs near the schwarzschild radius .",
    "thus , by following the works of cfv and mm@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite , we write the metric of a gravastar @xcite@xcite , namely :    @xmath57    where the metric functions @xmath58 and @xmath59 are given for ds - sector ( gbec ) , namely :    @xmath60    and @xmath61 where the constant @xmath62 is found when we impose the continuity between the metric functions of ds ( gbec ) and the region of ordinary matter ( baryonic matter ) described by the schwarzschild metric . according to the model of mazur and motola@xcite@xcite , we have    @xmath63    where @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 are respectively the radius from where the phase transition begins , the total mass of the star , the variable radius and the radius of the dark core ; @xmath69 being a dimensionless variable , where @xmath70@xcite@xcite .",
    "@xmath71 is the newton gravitational constant .",
    "however , according to the present model , we will show that the phase transition occurs approximately at @xmath67 ( fig.5 ) .",
    "the schwarzchild metric can be written as the ds - metric , so that their metric functions are    @xmath72    the vacuum energy density is    @xmath73    where @xmath74 is the cosmological constant whose vacuum state is represented by the following eos :    @xmath75    where @xmath76 , @xmath77 is the pressure and @xmath78 is the vacuum energy density .    on the other hand , the baryonic region with ultra - relativistic matter is described by eos , namely :    @xmath79    with @xmath80 .",
    "here it is important to call attention to the fact that there is a general model for gravastar , i.e. , a dark energy star model , where we have a more general eos that encompasses several vacuum models , namely : @xmath81@xcite@xcite .",
    "we aim to consider those several vacuum vibration modes inside gbec in order to justify better the origin of anisotropy that leads to the increase of the pressure inside gbec , allowing the emergence of a phase transition that finishes to occur at the radius of core from where a quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) phase begins ( fig.5 ) .      by adopting the spherical coordinates",
    ", we write a metric with the observables of the star@xcite@xcite@xcite , namely :    @xmath82dt^{2}+\\frac{dr^{2}}{\\left(1-\\frac{2gm}{c^{2}r}\\right)}+r^{2}d\\omega^{2},\\ ] ]    where @xmath83 is the solid angle . the function @xmath84 is known as compactness .",
    "such a function measures how relativistic is a star and plays a special role in the structure of a gravastar when we discuss the energy conditions nec , dec , sec and wec@xcite , which are responsible for determining the closing of a region associated with the formation of an event horizon .",
    "the compactness is expressed by a ratio of speeds , that is to say we can write @xmath85 , where @xmath12 is the speed of escape from the star .",
    "when @xmath12 is compared to @xmath11 , we should have @xmath86 such that light can escape and so the event horizon is not formed .",
    "we choose the function @xmath87 to represent the local gravitational acceleration and @xmath88 is the mass - energy confined into a radius @xmath66 .",
    "the stress - energy tensor is @xmath89 $ ] .",
    "the component @xmath90 of the field@xcite is    @xmath91    where @xmath78 is an energy density .",
    "the spatial component @xmath92@xcite is given by    @xmath93}= \\frac{4{\\pi}r}{3}\\frac{\\rho(r)_{t}+3p_{r}(r)}{\\left(1-\\frac{2gm(r)}{c^{2}r}\\right)},\\ ] ]    where @xmath94 .",
    "let us continue to indicate explicitly the dependence of all relevant functions with the radius @xmath66 .",
    "considering the existence of a transverse pressure @xmath95 , the more general tov equation is written as    @xmath96    in the isotropic case , we find @xmath97 , however the works of cfv and debenedicts et al@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite demonstrate the relevance of the tangencial ( transverse ) pressure for a gravastar .",
    "so we define the dimensionless parameter that we call anisotropy , namely :    @xmath98    now we write the tov equation , which represents the hydrostatic equilibrium of a fluid .",
    "it is given in terms of the anisotropy , namely :    @xmath99    in the center of the core of the gbec ( @xmath100 ) , there is no anisotropy ( @xmath101 ) .    to complete the set of the structure equations of a star , we present the continuity equation , which regulates the mass behavior , namely :    @xmath102",
    "the study of fluid with negative pressure in stars was regulated in refs.@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite by following the buchdahl - bondi relation .",
    "we have the following conditions :    \\1 ) the nec ( the null energy condition )    @xmath103    \\2 ) the dec ( the dominant energy condition )    @xmath104    nec and dec are associated with the closing conditions@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite or the appearance of an event horizon . the imposition of such conditions for the compactness result in a range of values that the compactness should obey in such a way that the horizon event is not formed .",
    "thus , for the existence of a phase transition with the appearance of a repulsive core ( gbec ) , the values of compactness must conform to the following ranges in the respective layers near the schwazschild radius defined by the value cfv@xcite , respecting nec and dec conditions of buchdahl - bondi , namely :    @xmath105    where @xmath106 is the magnitude of the anisotropy .",
    "the coupling between the compactness and anisotropy characterizes the need to prevent the formation of the event horizon .",
    "usually , in the literature about nuclear astrophysics , the anisotropy is related to the presence of an electromagnetic field , but here the situation is different since the anisotropic term is introduced so that we can obtain a repulsive effect capable of preventing the formation of the event horizon .",
    "this is why the connection between anisotropy and the compactness is essential , which means that the anisotropy arises to respect the values above , being in accordance with the compactness that must be @xmath107 .",
    "in this section we map the geometric structure of ssr@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite in the geometry of spacetime of the gbec inside a gravastar .",
    "so we will rewrite ds - metric ( eqs.(7 ) , ( 8) , ( 9 ) and refs.@xcite@xcite ) . in view of this , here let us consider that there are effective constants like @xmath108@xcite@xcite , @xmath109 and @xmath110 for representing respectively an effective speed of light and a minimum speed in the gbec medium , and also an effective cosmological constant connected to an effective hubble constant associated with the spacetime of a certain gbec in the core of a gravastar .",
    "thus , we write    @xmath111    where the metric functions are @xmath112    we also rewrite the spacetime metric of ssr@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite in the following way :    @xmath113    , @xmath0 and @xmath74 could really change in the gbec of a gravastar , although we will explore deeper such a change elsewhere . in the last section",
    ", we will show how @xmath108 and @xmath114 vary just in the region of phase transition . ]      by equating the two metric functions associated with @xmath92 component of the metric ( eq.(6 ) and eq.(10 ) ) , we find    @xmath115    from where , we get    @xmath116^{2}.\\ ] ]    and knowing that @xmath117 , with @xmath118 , we write    @xmath119    the above equation shows the connection between the minimum speed and the dark mass density of a gravastar .",
    "thus , we are able to realize that , since the minimum speed @xmath114 inside the gbec depends on the density @xmath78 of the star , indeed such a minimum speed @xmath114 is not necessarily the fundamental minimum speed @xmath0 obtained for the universe@xcite .",
    "as the density @xmath78 of the gbec is normally much higher than the fundamental vacuum energy density of the universe , of course we expect that @xmath120 so that each star has its value of @xmath114 , whereas @xmath0 is a universal constant@xcite .",
    "so , as it is already known that a too strong gravity generated inside bh@xcite can lead to a variation of the speed of light ( fig.4 ) , it would be also natural to expect that there is an effective minimum speed @xmath114 inside a system on gravitational collapse , preventing the appearence of the singularity of horizon event and thus justifying physically the emergence of gbec .",
    "the effective minimum speed @xmath114 and the speed of light @xmath121@xcite ( fig.4 ) given in the region of phase transition of a gravastar will be obtained in section 5 .    rewriting the term of minimum spped ( @xmath122 ) in function of the effective cosmological constant given in the core of a gravastar",
    ", we find    @xmath123    this result provides interesting consequences , since there is an upper limit for @xmath124 , i.e. , we always find @xmath125 in view of the fact that @xmath114 corresponds to the unattainable minimum limit of speed in the region of gbec , and thus we can also obtain a limit for the radius of gbec of a gravastar , which represents the radius of core @xmath67 . beyond this",
    ", we should consider the radial function @xmath126 so that we can study the propagation of signals in the interior of the gbec , where there should be many kind of vibrating vacuums , also including the special case of the cosmological constant ( @xmath127 with @xmath76 ) .    by manipulating the above equation",
    ", we can find the following dimensionless constant for a gravastar ( gbec ) , i.e. , @xmath128 , namely :    @xmath129    the value of compactness connected to the cosmological constant is in agreement with the value that was found in previous works about gravitational collapses@xcite@xcite .",
    "the metrics of the two regions of a gravastar must obey the condition of continuity in the region of phase transition@xcite@xcite .",
    "taking into account such a condition , let us impose this condition to both metrics of ssr and schwarzschild ( eq.(6 ) and eq.(18 ) ) , by begining with the component @xmath92 .",
    "the schwarzschild metric is    @xmath130dt^{2}+\\frac{dr^{2}}{1-\\frac{2gm}{c'^{2}r}}+r^{2}d\\omega^{2}.\\ ] ]    the condition of continuity applied to the component @xmath92 of both metrics on about the radius of core @xmath131 , where the phase transition occurs , leads to    @xmath132    so we find that the ratio of speeds is directly connected to the compactness , as follows :    @xmath133    where we should stress that the mass of such a gravastar ( @xmath65 ) is considered to be approximately equal to its dark mass ( core mass ) , since its baryonic shell is too thin so that we are making the following approximation : @xmath134 .",
    "this result is expected since it is already known that the own compactness could be written as a ratio of speeds .",
    "thus we notice that @xmath135 gives the escape velocity of a star .",
    "therefore we realize that the compactness could be understood as being the ratio @xmath136 .",
    "so , with the imposition of the buchdal - bondi relation@xcite@xcite , we write    @xmath137    we finally obtain the upper limit for the ratio of speeds .",
    "although such a limit was already predicted before , here we have another limit , which also indicates when the phase transition begins to occur .",
    "this condition imposed to the compactness is compatible with the impossibility of formation of event horizon .",
    "thus we have a strong evidence that the causal structure of ssr prevents the formation of event horizon , even because the minimum speed is unattainable such that we must have @xmath138 , which is in agreement with the buchdahl - bondi relation , as we get @xmath139 . in this case",
    ", we interpret @xmath12 as being the input speed into the gbec , that is the opposite of the idea of escape speed from gravity , since we are considering that the core of a gravastar represents a repulsive region connected to an anti - gravity , so that now we need an input speed @xmath140 to reach the interior of the repulsive core ( gbec ) for a certain radial coordinate @xmath141 .",
    "let us now apply the continuity condition for the temporal component @xmath90 .",
    "as we are on the surface of the dark core governed by gbec , so we are in the limit of validity of the causal structure of ssr . imposing the continuity condition to the components @xmath90 of both metrics of ssr ( eq.(6 ) ) and schwarzschid ( eq.(18 ) ) , we obtain    @xmath142,\\ ] ]    where we consider @xmath131 ( on the shell of the dark core ) .",
    "and so we find    @xmath143    or yet    @xmath144    by deriving in @xmath131 for both of sides of the above equation , we obtain    @xmath145    as @xmath87 represents a gravitational acceleration in the region of schwarschild , we have @xmath146 so that we find    @xmath147    knowing that @xmath148 , we find @xmath149 .    in the same way we can write a condition for the ratio of speeds that prevents the event horizon , we can also write a ratio of possible radius of core in such a way to respect the causality condition by preventing the closing or formation of the event horizon , and thus forming a phase transition as suggested by chapline@xcite@xcite@xcite ( see fig.5 ) ; however this question is still to be better explained .",
    "we have    @xmath150^{2}<1.\\ ] ]    we believe that @xmath67 ( gbec radius ) vary by means of some intriguing way in the interval @xmath151 ( fig.5 ) .",
    "since such a phase transition is preventing the formation of the coordinate singularity , the radius of gbec must assume a value @xmath152 .",
    "it is interesting to notice that all the results we have obtained show explicitly the coupling of a certain cosmological parameter with the greatnesses associated with ssr@xcite .",
    "a gravastar has an eos@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite . by considering the more generic case of vacuum ,",
    "let us think about many possible effects of repulsive pressure of a gravastar / dark energy star , being represented by the following eos for gbec :    @xmath153    where @xmath126 was interpreted as an input speed into the gbec with a certain radial coordinate @xmath66 .",
    "we should note that , if the input speed is @xmath9 , we would be in limit of validity of ssr , which corresponds to the radius @xmath154 of the shell of the dark core . and , if the input speed is @xmath155 , we would be very close to the center of the dark core ( @xmath156 ) , which is governed by eos of the cosmological constant , where we have @xmath127 . in short ,",
    "ssr leads us to deal with the core of a gravastar as being made by a set of infinite spherical shells connected to a continuum spectrum of modes of vacuum , instead of simply only one mode of vacuum connected to the cosmological constant as described in the simple model in ref.@xcite ( fig.3 ) .",
    "the energy conditions dec and nec being revisited ( eq.(25 ) and eq.(26 ) ) are given , as follows :    @xmath157    and    @xmath158    by using the density @xmath78 calculated before ( eq.(46 ) ) , we find the following eos :    @xmath159    thus , by using eos above , we rewrite the pressure in terms of the ratio of speeds , where we consider the causal structure of ssr being directly related to the question about the formation of event horizon .",
    "so , if the energy conditions dec and nec are obeyed , this ensures that the event horizon does not appear for any value of radius , especially for @xmath160 .",
    "then we write    @xmath161    by substituting the above result ( eq.(50 ) ) into the energy condition , we find    @xmath162    so we verify that    @xmath163    where there must be a minimum radius @xmath164 in order to avoid the central singularity , i.e. , in order to prevent that @xmath165 .",
    "this question will be discussed elsewhere .",
    "it is important to stress that there is a strong connection between an effective cosmological constant @xmath166 and an effective mimimum speed @xmath114 given in spacetime of the region of gbec .",
    "we also realize that the minimum speed @xmath114 is directly proportional to the repulsive pressure .",
    "so , if @xmath167 , this would imply in a null pressure ( a null anti - gravity ) , which would lead to the absence of the dark core and thus the appearence of event horizon of a bh .    now verifying the other condition , i.e. , @xmath168 , we recover again the same result above .",
    "this strengthens our conclusion that there is no event horizon , although we do not still have a demonstration for the inferior limit that appears in the buchahl - bondi relation . in sum , we have shown that ssr obeys the energy condition for the upper limit @xmath169 in the buchahl - bondi relation , but we need to develop a new energy condition based on ssr in order to investigate the lower limit @xmath170 that appears in the buchahl - bondi relation .",
    "this issue will be explored elsewhere .",
    "if we consider that the effective minimum speed @xmath114 is a constant inside the core of a gravastar , we find the pressure on the surface of the dark core .",
    "so we have    @xmath171    where we should remember that @xmath172 . beyond this",
    ", we see a direct dependence between @xmath114 and the radius of the dark core ( @xmath67 ) , so that , if @xmath167 , the dark core would vanish ( @xmath173 ) , and therefore all this new physics based on ssr vanishes .",
    "this strengthens our comprehension that the quantum spacetime of ssr is needed to give consistency to the formation of a phase trasition that emerges in order to replace the event horizon by gbec during the gravitational collapse .       to be determined .",
    "the dominant anisotropy occurs for @xmath174@xcite@xcite , which is close to the region of baryonic matter . here",
    "we intend to show that such a transition occurs at a coexistence radius @xmath175 where the radial pressure @xmath77 vanishes . in the last section",

    "we believe that the origin of such a rapid decrease of gravity comes from the vacuum anisotropy that already begins to govern the collapse for @xmath180 until reaching the phase transition ( gravity / anti - gravity ) at @xmath181 , where the anisotropy reaches its maximum value .",

    "we interpret that such vibrations of gbec are responsible for variations of the pressure so that the formation of the event horizon does not occur .",

    "this compels us to add an anisotropic term and then also associate it with the structure of ssr .",

    "in such a region , as @xmath231_{aniso}\\rightarrow\\infty$ ] , we obtain a high frequency of vibration of a proof particle , and thus the anisotropy is fundamental .",
    "such vibrations are a more realistic profile of relativistic superfluid than usually treated in the literature with extremely hard eos ( @xmath252)@xcite , where the speed of signal propagation does not vary . in short , we should have a decomposition of spectrum of different vacuums inside gbec@xcite .    from the viewpoint of escape speed for the case of a bh ( attractive gravity ) , the region of event horizon would have an escape speed being the speed of light ( @xmath11 ) .",

    "so we can make the following approximation :    @xmath254    as we know that the speed @xmath12 has an upper limit given by the speed of light ( @xmath108 ) inside the gbec , the other three values such as @xmath66 , @xmath232 and @xmath114 are non - zero constants .",

    "this assumption will be better justified soon when we consider the light cone in the region of phase transition or close to the event horizon in the case of classical collapse@xcite .",
    "we expect that , in the region of coexistence between the two phases ( gravity or baryonic phase / anti - gravity or gbec ) , i.e. , for @xmath271 , the light cone becomes closed@xcite so that the speed of light is reduced to @xmath272 , leading to the closing of the light cone .",
    "however , thanks to the minimum speed , i.e. , the presence of the dark cone ( fig.1)@xcite , here we intend to show more clearly that the horizon is almost formed at the schwarzschild radius ( @xmath273 ) , but it is not exactly formed due to the appearence of a coexistence radius of phases ( @xmath232 ) , @xmath232 being slightly larger than @xmath183 such that the horizon becomes forbidden .    in order to obtain the coexistence radius",

    "so it is interesting to note that such a speed @xmath293 also plays the role of an order parameter obtained just in the region of phase transition of a non - classical gravitational collapse .",
    "this connection between the cosmological scenario with anti - gravity and the phase of a repulsive core inside a gravastar by means of the same universal order parameter of transition given by @xmath293 seems to be a holographic aspect of spacetime .",

    "dirac have already called attention to the importance of the well - known _ large number hypothesis _ even before the obtaining of @xmath1@xcite .",
    "so a given infinite greatness that appears in physics could be removed by a more fundamental principle still unknown . in view of this , it is interesting to notice that the metric in eq.(92 ) shows us that the tiny pure number @xmath1 in the denominator of the spatial term @xmath294 prevents its singularity and thus also prevents an interval @xmath248 of pure space - like as occurs at the event horizon of a bh , because now the cone does not become completely closed in the region of phase transition given by the metric in eq.(92 ) , since the temporal term of the metric above does not vanish ( @xmath295 ) , i.e. , @xmath296 as @xmath297 , which is exactly the order parameter of transition that indicates the begining of a new phase of anti - gravity for @xmath298 , as also occurs in the universe for a given radius such that @xmath299 , from where anti - gravity governs its expansion .",

    "however , as there is a very short and complicated transient between @xmath304 with signal @xmath300 ( eq.92 ) and @xmath67 with a minimal signal @xmath303 , here we have made a good approximation for both radius so that @xmath271 , although the speeds of signal vary abruptally between them .",
    "the improvement of this model in order to distinguish both radius within a more accurate way will be made elsewhere .",
    "we sill realize that the buchdahl - bondi relation for preventing the event horizon is now better justified by the constant @xmath305 , since we find    @xmath306    where @xmath307 and thus the anisotropy is in fact so large at @xmath232 , i.e. , @xmath308 as already expected .",

    "we have parameterised the gbec with a frequency which is fully analogous to the wavelength of de - broglie in ssr@xcite ( quantum structure of space ) , showing that the anisotropic and isotropic terms have opposite behaviors , one of them working as a cut - off for the other , in such a way to prevent the closing of the event horizon .",
    "we have also seen that the anisotropy is directly connected with the star s mass distribution ( classic profile ) , which reorders according to the repulsion given by the cosmological constant of the star , which is closely related to the structure of the ultra - referential in ssr ( quantum aspect of gravity ) , since it seems to be the origin of repulsion ( anti - gravity ) .",
    "so ssr confirms its vocation to be an anti - gravity theory , which is able to describe a superfluid even for the macroscopic case , since ssr was generated by a breaking of the lorentz symmetry .",
    "ssr opens a new perspective to the paradoxes of quantum gravity and gravitational collapse in order to be better explored .",
    "we also realize the need to postulate a new energy condition being compatible with ultra - referential @xmath14 , which will be studied in a next paper .",
    "we have the next perspectives to study the entropy of hawking - berkenstein , an equation of state that is less hard for describing the region of core , the hydrodynamic conditions of the superfluid generated by this new dark energy and discuss the relationship of gbec / ssr with the layer of baryonic matter , by taking into account the state equation @xmath310 to describe the region of radiation and the equation of mit bag model for baryonic matter .",
    "we also aim to study in detail the behavior of the light and dark cone inside the core of a gravastar and also close to the center of the dark core , including the behavior of the constants @xmath114 , @xmath108 and @xmath166 inside the star , i.e. , far away from the region of phase transition .",

    "<S> we aim to search for a connection between an invariant minimum speed that breaks down the lorentz symmetry and the gravitational bose einstein condensate ( gbec ) , which is the central core of a star of gravitating vacuum ( gravastar / dark energy star ) by introducing a cosmological constant into compact objects . </S>",
    "<S> this model was designed to circumvent the embarrassment generated by the paradoxes of a singularity as the final stage of a gravitational collapse , by introducing in place of the singularity of event horizon a spatial - temporal phase transition , a concept with which the causal structure of symmetrical special relativity ( ssr ) helps us to elucidate by providing a quantum interpretation for gbec and explaining the origin of anisotropy , which has been introduced in ad - hoc way before in the literature . </S>"
