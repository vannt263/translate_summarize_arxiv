    "the observation @xcite of cosmic ray ( cr ) events with energy @xmath3 gev ( ultra  high energy , uhe ) poses at least two distinct problems :    * * the energy problem : * it is very difficult , if not impossible , to accelerate protons to such energies in any known astrophysical source @xcite . * * the propagation problem : * protons with @xmath4 gev can photoproduce pions on the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) . the gzk effect @xcite implies that protons with @xmath5 gev should have been produced within a few dozen mpc of earth .",
    "the same conclusion holds for photons [ which get absorbed via @xmath6 , where @xmath7 belongs to the ( extra)galactic radio background ] and heavier nuclei ( which are broken up by collisions with cmb photons ) .",
    "current estimates of ( extra)galactic magnetic field strengths imply that protons with @xmath8 gev should point back to their source if they are produced within a few dozen mpc .",
    "there are , however , no known near sources of high  energy particles in the direction of the most energetic events .",
    "many suggested solutions of `` the uhecr puzzle '' actually only address the second problem .",
    "i will briefly review these ideas in the following section . in sec .",
    "3 i will discuss two approaches that can solve both problems , the main emphasis being on decays of super  massive particles , before concluding in sec .",
    "calculations of the gzk effect assume that @xmath9 is the same for @xmath10 ev , @xmath11 gev and @xmath12 mev , @xmath13",
    ". this assumption may be wrong if lorentz symmetry is violated .",
    "this is actually quite an old idea @xcite , which has been rediscovered recently @xcite . by assuming different",
    "limiting velocities for different species of particles one can arrange for a suppression of the gzk effect ; one can even avoid it altogether . in this case",
    "one would expect a completely smooth spectrum around the gzk cut  off .",
    "in particular , one would not expect a bump just below the gzk energy , which seems to be present in both the agasa and hires results @xcite .",
    "besides , it seems to me a step backwards to give up one of the basic symmetries underlying our understanding of nature ; it rather reminds me of bohr s willingness to give up energy conservation to explain nuclear @xmath14 decay spectra .",
    "back then , pauli s neutrinos saved the day ; i m confident that the puzzle of the uhecr events can also be solved without giving up well  established principles .",
    "if an exotic hadron @xmath15 with mass @xmath16 is @xcite the primary of the uhecr events , the gzk `` cut  off '' ( better : spectral break ) will be pushed upwards by a factor @xmath17 .",
    "even the agasa data can be explained if @xmath18 . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath15 is too heavy , it looses energy too slowly in the air shower it initiates when hitting the earth s atmosphere .",
    "it has been estimated @xcite that the produced shower will only look sufficiently proton  like if @xmath19 .",
    "there are at least two problems with this scenario .",
    "first , acceleration becomes much more difficult to explain .",
    "producing uhe @xmath15 particles by first accelerating protons and then colliding them with ambient matter ( or photons ) will likely over  produce neutrinos and uhe photons , since the ( inclusive ) cross section for pion production is several orders of magnitude larger than the cross section for @xmath15 production ; of course , this would also assume that protons can be accelerated to energies well beyond the most energetic observed cr event .",
    "directly accelerating stable @xmath15 particles is also problematic , since at least on earth they only constitute at most a tiny fraction of all matter , so the heavenly accelerator would presumably also `` waste '' most of its energy on accelerating ordinary protons and electrons .",
    "the second problem is that @xmath15 particles , being strongly interacting and rather light , should have been produced abundantly in collider experiments ; it is difficult to believe that they could have escaped detection .",
    "the idea @xcite is that uhe neutrinos are produced somewhere ; since they can propagate almost freely through the universe , this neutrino source may be anywhere within one hubble radius , 3 gpc , or so . within the gzk radius around the earth , a small fraction of these uhe neutrinos annihilate on relic background antineutrinos to produce @xmath20 bosons , most of which decay hadronically , giving rise to the observed uhecr events ; of course , uhe @xmath21 annihilating on relic @xmath22 also contribute .",
    "one problem with this explanation is that it aggravates the energy problem by several orders of magnitude .",
    "one will need uhe neutrinos of at least five times the energy of the most energetic uhecr event , since @xmath20 bosons decay into typically @xmath23 hadrons . in order to produce such neutrinos",
    ", one needs protons whose energy is higher by at least another factor of five or so , i.e. one would need a source of protons extending to @xmath24 gev .",
    "moreover , the flux @xmath25 , i.e. the intensity of this source must be _ much _ higher than that needed to directly accelerate the observed uhecr flux . indeed",
    ", the required uhe neutrino flux is at best marginally compatible with existing limits @xcite .",
    "this is another old idea @xcite that has been rediscovered recently @xcite .",
    "the main observation is that magnetic monopoles can actually be accelerated ( rather than only deflected ) by ( extra)galactic magnetic fields .",
    "indeed , this acceleration is quite efficient , partly due to the large effective charge ( @xmath26 ) of the monopoles . according to current estimates energies beyond @xmath27 gev",
    "are easily accommodated in this way .",
    "of course , monopoles are stable , so they can have been produced in the very early universe , most plausibly during a phase transition . the density , or flux , of monopoles required to explain the observed uhecr events is safely below",
    "all known bounds @xcite , as long as these monopoles do not catalyze nucleon decay .",
    "the biggest difficulty of this model is to explain why the observed events look so much like proton  induced air showers . in order to produce a shower at all",
    ", the monopole must be ultra ",
    "relativistic , i.e. @xmath28 gev .",
    "these monopoles can therefore not be associated with a grand unified symmetry ; instead one has to postulate the existence of an `` intermediate '' scale @xmath29 .",
    "of course , direct monopole searches at colliders imply @xmath30 .",
    "simple kinematics then implies that a monopole  induced air shower will penetrate much more deeply into the atmosphere than a @xmath31initiated shower does , unless the cross section for inelastic scattering of a monopole on an air nucleus is much _ larger _ than the corresponding cross section for protons .",
    "the authors of ref.@xcite argue that bound states of monopoles carrying nontrivial @xmath32 charge might conceivably have this property .",
    "in this view , successive collisions could increase the length of the color  magnetic qcd string ( or flux tube ) between the constituents , and hence the area of the bound state .",
    "note that this string can only break into monopole  antimonopole pairs .",
    "since monopoles are heavy , a purely color  magnetic string might therefore store many orders of magnitude more energy , and could correspondingly be many orders of magnitude longer , than the more familiar color  electric string does , which can break up into light @xmath33 pairs . the effective monopole ",
    "air cross section can grow quickly through this mechanism , leading to the desired short air shower .",
    "note , however , that the monopoles , being stable , should still reach the earth ( with non  relativistic velocity ) ; detecting these monopoles would be the ultimate test of this explanation .      another exotic possibility is that the uhecr events are due to the decay ( or annihilation ) of some super  heavy long  lived @xmath34 particle @xcite .",
    "we obviously need @xmath35 gev in order to generate a significant flux of uhecr primaries at @xmath36 gev .",
    "just as obviously , the lifetime of @xmath34 must be at least comparable to the age of the universe , @xmath37 yrs .",
    "this immediately raises two particle physics questions : how can such massive particles be so long  lived , with @xmath38 ? and how could such massive particles ever have been created ?    one way to ensure the longevity of the @xmath34 particles is to embed them into topological defects .",
    "the original proposal @xcite envisioned annihilating monopole ",
    "antimonopole pairs as source of uhecr events .",
    "this idea has later been refined to the concept of a `` cosmic necklace '' , ( anti)monopoles strung along a cosmic string @xcite . cosmic strings themselves become unstable when they intersect .",
    "such kinds of defects could be formed during a phase transition via the kibble mechanism @xcite .",
    "note that we now need the scale of symmetry breaking to be @xmath39 gev ( as opposed to @xmath40 gev in the previous subsection ) .",
    "this may be problematic , since with the scale of ( four  dimensional ) inflation determined to be @xmath41 gev , it is quite possible that the post  inflationary universe never was hot enough to have been in the `` unbroken '' phase , which would require @xmath42 gev .",
    "moreover , the increasingly well measured cmb anisotropies do not seem to show any evidence that topological defects ( like cosmic strings ) played a role in structure formation . in these topological defect models",
    "the @xmath34 particles could be superheavy gauge or higgs bosons , and/or their superpartners .",
    "alternatively the @xmath34 particles could exist as ( more or less ) free particles in today s universe .",
    "such particles might have been created at the end of inflation , when the energy density of the universe was more than one hundred orders of magnitude higher than it is today .",
    "several production mechanisms have been suggested , e.g. gravitational production due to the rapidly varying metric ( which could work for @xmath34 particles as heavy as @xmath43 gev ) @xcite , or in ( inclusive ) inflaton decays @xcite .",
    "the @xmath34 particles would then serve as `` batteries '' , storing energy from this extremely violent early epoch of the universe and releasing it in our much balmier times .    in order to explain the longevity of such free @xmath34 particles one has to postulate that their couplings to ordinary matter are very strongly suppressed .",
    "some such suppression is actually expected if @xmath34 resides in the `` hidden sector '' thought to be responsible for the spontaneous breaking of supersymmetry @xcite , which by definition only has @xmath44 suppressed couplings to the visible sector , although it is by no means guaranteed that this suppression is sufficient .",
    "the relevant couplings could also be suppressed by ( approximate ) symmetries @xcite , or geometrically in brane world scenarios @xcite .",
    "needs severe finetuning .",
    "this is not really true , since @xmath45 could be as large as @xmath46 yrs @xcite if @xmath34 particles constitute the bulk of dark matter .",
    "model builders therefore have some ten orders of magnitude in @xmath45 to aim for .",
    "of course , the observed uhecr flux determines the ratio @xmath47 to within a factor of a few , but this does not require any more finetuning of model parameters than in any other explanation of the uhecr events . ]",
    "the spectrum of uhecr primaries ( and other stable particles ) at source is determined by the physics of @xmath34 decays @xcite .",
    "this is quite nontrivial , as indicated in fig .  1 , which is taken from ref.@xcite .",
    "the primary few ",
    "body @xmath34 decay initiates a generalized parton shower .",
    "this is similar to , e.g. , the hadronic decay of @xmath20 bosons , which have been studied in great detail at lep and slc . from a theorist s perspective",
    ", a @xmath20 boson decays into a @xmath48 pair , whereas experimentally one observes twenty or so hadrons in the final state .",
    "the transition from the two ( anti)quarks to the @xmath49 hadrons entails both perturbative and non  perturbative physics .",
    "the perturbative part is called a parton shower .",
    "it can be envisioned by assuming that the original @xmath33 pair is not produced on  shell , but with initial time  like virtualities of order @xmath50 .",
    "the showering occurs when these partons move closer to the mass shell by emitting additional partons , mostly gluons , with smaller time  like virtualities .",
    "similarly , the particles produced in primary @xmath34 decay should be considered to have initial time  like virtualities @xmath51 . at such high energy scales",
    "parton showers are expected to develop quite differently from parton showers at scale @xmath50 . to begin with",
    ", the existence of a ( real , four  dimensional ) energy scale @xmath52 strongly indicates the existence of superparticles , which can stabilize this very large ratio of scales against radiative corrections @xcite . since the superparticle mass scale @xmath53 tev @xmath54 ,",
    "superparticles can be produced ( i.e. , will be `` active '' ) in the initial part of the shower development , even if @xmath34 decays primarily into sm particles . moreover , we know that at energy scales near @xmath55 all three gauge interactions are of approximately equal strength . in refs.@xcite",
    "we therefore included all gauge interactions as well as third generation yukawa interactions in the description of the parton shower .",
    "when the shower virtuality scale reaches @xmath56 , superparticles decouple from the shower and decay ; the electroweak gauge and higgs bosons , as well as top quarks , decouple at essentially the same scale .",
    "a careful treatment of these decays is mandatory if one wants to account for the entire energy released in @xmath34 decays .",
    "as well known , sparticle decays can be somewhat complicated even at the parton level , involving lengthy decay cascades .",
    "we treated these with the help of isasusy @xcite .    at shower scales between @xmath56 and @xmath57 gev",
    "only standard qcd is important for the evolution of the parton shower , as at lep . at scale @xmath58",
    "the non  perturbative parton @xmath59 hadron transition occurs .",
    "most hadrons , as well as heavy @xmath60 and @xmath61 leptons , eventually decay as well , as indicated in the figure . at the end one",
    "is thus left with seven species of particles ( plus their antiparticles ) : protons , electrons , photons , three kinds of neutrinos , and lsps .    out of the multitude of particles produced in a far ",
    "away @xmath34 decay at most one will be observed on earth .",
    "we therefore `` only '' have to compute the one  particle inclusive @xmath34 decay spectra into the seven stable decay products . in",
    "qcd the notion of fragmentation functions ( ffs ) has been developed precisely in order to describe single  particle inclusive spectra @xcite .",
    "these ffs depend on two variables : the energy scale of the shower , here @xmath55 , and the scaled energy @xmath62 of the stable decay product @xmath63 in the @xmath34 rest frame .",
    "the @xmath64 dependence of hadronic ffs at some reference scale has to be taken from data , since non  perturbative effects are important here ; we used the fits of ref.@xcite . or @xmath65 quark .",
    "] the scale dependence of the ffs is described by the appropriate generalization of the well  known dglap evolution equations @xcite .",
    "the decays of superparticles and other massive partons can also be treated in this framework , as long as their energy is much larger than their mass , in which case a collinear treatment is adequate .",
    "finally , at very small @xmath64 color coherence effects should be included @xcite .",
    "the main results of this analysis can be summarized as follows @xcite :    * for small @xmath66 , the @xmath67 and @xmath68 fluxes have essentially fixed ratios , independent of the primary @xmath34 decay mode(s ) and of the details of the susy spectrum .",
    "the @xmath69 flux is largest , exceeding the @xmath68 flux by a factor @xmath70 , while the photon and @xmath71 fluxes exceed the proton flux by a factor @xmath72 and @xmath73 , respectively .",
    "all these fluxes can be described by a simple power law in this region , @xmath74 .",
    "these features are due to qcd evolution effects . note that most @xmath75 and @xmath76 at @xmath66 originate from pion decays , and are thus subject to the same qcd effects .",
    ", as long as this extrapolation conserves energy and has a milder small@xmath77 behavior than @xmath78 . ] on the other hand , the @xmath79 and lightest superparticle ( lsp ) fluxes , which decouple much earlier in the shower , are model ",
    "dependent even at small @xmath64 .",
    "generally they increase more slowly with decreasing @xmath64 , and thus become subdominant for @xmath80 . * for @xmath81 the fluxes at source",
    "depend very strongly on the primary @xmath34 decay mode(s ) , and less strongly ( typically at the factor of two level ) on details of the susy spectrum , the relative ordering of and mass splitting between states being more important than the overall sparticle mass scale .",
    "for all @xmath34 decays into mssm particles the photon flux at source is larger than the proton flux . in case of hadronic",
    "@xmath34 decays the ratio @xmath82 reaches a minimum ( slightly above 1 ) at @xmath83 . at larger @xmath64",
    "it increases due to the emission of hard photons early in the shower , illustrating the importance of including electroweak interactions in the description of the shower . at smaller @xmath64",
    "this ratio increases because the ratio of ffs into pions and into protons increases with decreasing @xmath64 @xcite . for primary",
    "@xmath34 decays into only weakly interacting particles the photon flux at @xmath81 exceeds the proton flux by at least one order of magnitude , since in this case hadrons can only be produced after two electroweak branching processes , while photons can be emitted already in the first branching .",
    "the @xmath69 and @xmath84 fluxes also exceed the proton flux at large @xmath64 ; these two neutrino fluxes approach each other at @xmath85 , where most neutrinos come directly from electroweak branching and decay processes , rather than from pion decays . *",
    "the lsp flux is important even if the primary @xmath34 decay only involves sm particles .",
    "for example , bino  like lsps carry 23% of the total energy if @xmath34 decays into leptons , 56% if @xmath34 decays into quarks , 2030% if @xmath34 decays into squarks , and 3050% if @xmath34 decays into sleptons .",
    "the percentage is higher for @xmath34 decays into @xmath86 singlet sfermions , since they have shorter supersymmetric decay chains , and also shower less ( due to the absence of @xmath86 couplings ) .",
    "these fluxes are modified by propagation effects . even if most relevant @xmath34 decays",
    "occur in the halo of our own galaxy , which is expected @xcite if @xmath34 particles can move freely under the influence of gravity , electrons will loose most of their energy in synchrotron radiation on galactic @xmath87fields .",
    "moreover , the propagation distance is so large that oscillations essentially wash out all information about the original neutrino flavor dependence , i.e. approximately equal fluxes of @xmath88 and @xmath79 will reach earth independent of the ratios of these fluxes at source .",
    "how can one test this class of models ? given that @xmath55 and the source density @xmath89 are considered to be free parameters , it is not surprising that one can fit @xcite the observed uhecr flux .",
    "these models are even compatible with a gzk spectral break , as indicated by the current hires ( but not agasa ) data , if @xmath34 particles are distributed more or less uniformly throughout the universe , as would e.g. be expected if they are confined to cosmic strings .",
    "as mentioned earlier , freely moving @xmath34 particles are expected @xcite to have a large overdensity ( @xmath90 to @xmath91 ) in our galaxy , in which case most relevant @xmath34 decays would occur at distance well below one gzk interaction length . even in this case",
    "the hires spectrum can be described by @xmath34 decays , simply by choosing @xmath55 such that the spectrum cuts off just above @xmath27 gev .",
    "the composition of uhecr primaries is more problematic , however , observations indicate that most primaries are protons or heavier nuclei , not photons .",
    "this follows from an analysis @xcite of the longitudinal shower profile of the most energetic event ever observed ; from the large number of muons in the haverah park @xcite and agasa @xcite data ; and from the absence of a south  north asymmetry in the agasa data @xcite , which would be expected for photon primaries , since photons with @xmath92 gev split into @xmath93 pairs already high in the earth s magnetosphere .",
    "in contrast , as mentioned earlier , @xmath34 decay models predict the photon flux at source to be higher than the proton flux",
    ". if most sources are at cosmological distances , propagation effects may well suppress @xmath94 at post  gzk energies even more than @xmath95 .",
    "however , if most sources reside in the halo of our galaxy , propagation effects on @xmath94 are expected to be significant only if the galactic radio background has been underestimated by at least an order of magnitude .",
    "i do not know how ( im)plausible this might be .",
    "fitting the observed uhecr flux to @xmath95 alone increases the predicted flux of neutrinos and lsps on earth by about a factor of three if @xmath96 gev ; if @xmath97 gev , the enhancement amounts to a factor @xmath73 for hadronic primary @xmath34 decays , and to roughly one order of magnitude for leptonic decays .",
    "particles with @xmath98 gev are thus particularly difficult to reconcile with the experimental evidence against photons as main uhecr primaries . ] even without this enhancement the neutrino flux might be detectable by future experiments @xcite .",
    "one can look for long muon tracks as well as high  energy particle showers due to nc and @xmath99 cc events in neutrino telescopes like icecube @xcite .",
    "another technique , used by the rice experiment at the south pole @xcite , is to look for coherent cherenkov emission of radio waves , which is mostly sensitive to electromagnetic showers , i.e. to @xmath84 cc events .",
    "finally , future air shower detectors like the pierre auger array @xcite can look for `` horizontal '' air showers , which originate too deep in the atmosphere to be due to photons or protons , and for @xmath100leptons coming out of the earth at shallow angles and decaying in the atmosphere . in all cases one has to require @xmath101 tev in order to suppress the atmospheric neutrino background .",
    "some estimated @xcite event rates per year are collected in table 1 , for two extreme values of @xmath55 and two extreme @xmath34 distributions . `` galactic '' here means that essentially all relevant sources are closer than one gzk interaction length .",
    "in contrast , if @xmath34 particles are distributed homogeneously throughout the universe , @xmath34 decays occuring at distances well beyond one gzk interaction length contribute to @xmath102 , but not to @xmath95 ( at post  gzk energies ) .",
    "a homogeneous distribution therefore leads to @xmath103 times higher neutrino event rates than a galactic distribution does .",
    "similarly , @xmath97 gev leads to an about ten times higher neutrino event rate than @xmath104 gev does .",
    "the reason is that , in particular for a galactic distribution of @xmath34 particles , models with @xmath96 gev only allow to fit the very highest energy end of the uhecr spectrum , leading to significantly smaller fluxes at source .",
    "notice also that the cross sections for @xmath105 scattering grow significantly less rapidly than linearly with energy once @xmath106 tev @xcite .",
    "finally , the ranges in the table indicate the spread between different @xmath34 decay models . for @xmath104",
    "gev all relevant particles are at @xmath107 , in which case this model dependence disappears , as mentioned above .",
    ".number of neutrino events with @xmath108 tev per year expected in different detectors .",
    "see the text for further details . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "in this contribution i discussed particle physics explanations of the post  gzk cosmic ray events .",
    "my personal favorite remains the explanation in terms of superheavy late decaying particles , which can solve both the energy and propagation problems .",
    "the biggest current challenge of this class of models seems to be how to explain the paucity of photons as primaries in the observed events .",
    "a first minnowing of models should be achieved by measuring the flux of neutrinos with @xmath109 gev .",
    "a decisive test may require measuring ( or excluding ) the predicted flux of lsps with @xmath110 gev , which will be difficult , but may be possible using space  based experiments . proving the existence of such mysterious super  heavy but long  lived particles would revolutionize our understanding of physics .",
    "if these models are still viable after the next generation of cosmic ray observatories and neutrino telescopes have presented their data , no effort should be spared to search for these extremely energetic cosmic lsps .",
