    "the coordinate transformation method ( ctm ) @xcite employs the invariance of maxwell equations under coordinate transformations @xcite to establish an equivalence between metric transformations and changes of material parameters @xcite , @xcite .",

    "ctm has been exploited for various computational problems such as : design of perfectly matched layers ( pmls ) for simulations of open boundaries in finite - difference time - domain and finite element methods @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , simplifying the geometry of complex computational domains @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , representing waveguide bends and twists by equivalent straight segments @xcite , , and formulating novel perturbation schemes for anisotropic materials @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "pendry et al . suggested implementing transformation media as metamaterials and inspired the widespread use of ctm as an optical design tool .",
    "several distinct strategies for the ctm - based design of metamaterial structures have been proposed .",
    "a continuous transformation of the whole space gives devices that are inherently invisible ( like invisibility cloaks @xcite , electromagnetic field concentrators @xcite , rotators and perfect lenses , @xcite ) .",
    "various authors have previously applied ctm for design and modeling waveguides @xcite , , , @xcite , .",
    "more recently , the embedded coordinate transformation method has been described @xcite , where transformation media are embedded into surrounding space yielding devices that transfer the transformed fields from the devices to their exterior .    in this paper",
    ", we apply ctm to domains bounded by transformation - invariant boundary conditions ( bcs ) .",
    "such an approach is inspired by the fact that in practice electromagnetic fields are always confined in space , like in waveguides and electromagnetic cavities or like electromagnetic beams .",
    "a reflectionless ctm - based device can have a twofold function : it can rearrange at will the field distribution within itself and it can yield an orthogonally transformed ( rotated ) outgoing wave .",
    "the beam squeezer is considered as a typical example of the former and the waveguide bend as the typical example of the latter .",
    "the ctm - based design offers the possibility of realizing a device with a given function ( e.g. cloaking ) in countless ways but it is a rule of thumb that the resulting prescription for material parameters is very hard to implement . for optical applications ,",
    "probably the biggest problem is to obtain a material with a controlled permeability .",
    "non - magnetic ctm devices can be designed , but only for tm waves .",
    "therefore , as our main goal for the considered structures ( bend and squeezer ) we choose achieving a non - magnetic realization . in section iii",
    "we show that using a reduced set of material parameters instead of the originally magnetic transformation media may be promising , provided the impedance - matching condition is reasonably satisfied . in section",
    "iv we propose a different approach by considering transformations that yield non - magnetic transformation media . by giving examples of a non - magnetic waveguide bend and beam squeezer , we anticipate that in principle a structure with arbitrary shape can be designed as non - magnetic , provided that its optical length is unrestrained .",

    "the benefit here is that the absence of reflection comes as a simple consequence of transformation continuity .",
    "another application of the concept of bounded domains is in the design of structures with a desired external shape without affecting the way fields perceive the internal geometry .",
    "a typical example is in waveguide miniaturization or squeezing an electromagnetic beam , which we describe in detail below .",
    "the performance of any ctm - based device is , in principle , limited only by physical properties of the metamaterials implementing the transformation media . in the general case ,",
    "parameters required for transformation media are such that causality implies the occurrence of both dispersion and absorption over any finite frequency band .",
    "these limitations have been reported for cloaking devices in @xcite . moreover , the fabrication is complicated since the metamaterial will need to be both anisotropic and with spatially varying properties in general case , as can be seen from ( [ eps_mu ] ) . still , perhaps the biggest obstacle in optical applications is the difficulty in engineering the magnetic response . for these reasons , in ctm applications it is crucial to consider how can the material requirements be released or simplified even if it is sometimes achieved at the expense of departing from ideally required values .    in the following two sections we consider two characteristic devices , the waveguide bend and beam squeezer , and",
    "discuss their implementation with respect to the above mentioned problems .",
    "our main aim is to remove magnetism completely and that can be done for the tm polarized waves . in section iii",
    "this is achieved by substituting the original ( magnetic ) transformation media parameters with a reduced non - magnetic set having the same dispersion relation . in section",

    "the transformation of the rectangle @xmath122 to the rectangle @xmath123 is determined by the condition that the compression @xmath134 is reciprocal to the stretching @xmath178 : @xmath179 so the parameters of media in the rectangle @xmath123 are @xmath180    the simulation of a tm gaussian beam passing through the squeezer in figure [ fig_squeezer ] ( c1 ) and ( c2 ) confirms the perfect performance of the proposed device .",

    "it might not be apparent immediately , but the condition @xmath159 is quite lax and is equivalent to fixing the phase of the transformed field , which we had to do even in the case of reduced material parameters to minimize reflection ( recall fixing @xmath48 for the bend and @xmath135 for the squeezer ) .    in summary , the application of ctm to spatially confined electromagnetic fields was considered .",
    "it was used to give various solutions for the waveguide bend and beam squeezer . both approximate and exact non - magnetic realizations",
    "were found . in the case of structures with a reduced set of material parameters ,",
    "the influence of impedance mismatch and its dependence on free parameters were investigated .",
    "transformations with unit jacobian determinant were recognized as promising for the design of non - magnetic devices and used to find novel non - magnetic solutions for the bend and squeezer .",
    "several implementations using isotropic and homogeneous layered systems were considered . on the example of the bend with reduced parameters , it was shown that the inhomogeneity of effective permittivity tensor can be successfully controlled by varying only the layer thicknesses .",
    "the implementation of the non - magnetic bend with such layers was shown to be practically perfect .",
    "its application is in optical waveguides that allow tm polarized waves .",
    "the non - magnetic squeezer is interesting for focusing and imaging applications since it is not limited by diffraction .",
