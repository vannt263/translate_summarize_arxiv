    "relativistic quantum information , started out from the seminal paper @xcite , is a new promising field that aims at understanding how special or general relativity can affect quantum information processing ( see @xcite for reviews on different aspects of the theory ) . in particular",
    ", it has been understood that entanglement @xcite , a useful resource in quantum information science , is not a covariant quantity , which means that it depends on the observer @xcite .",
    "important examples can be found in cosmology , where the expansion of the universe can populate with particles and anti - particles the vacuum state @xcite .",
    "the created pairs result entangled and such entanglement has been studied in @xcite , where it was shown that entanglement also stores information about the history of the universe ( see also @xcite ) . as a further step , generation of entanglement between occupation numbers , vacuum and @xmath0-particle state , and polarizations ( spins ) of particles has been investigated @xcite . all such works employed robertson - walker ( rw ) models with the assumption of homogeneity and isotropy , so that it is yet unclear whether entanglement may be sensitive to spacetime anisotropies and to what extent universe s features are imprinted on it . taking into account anisotropic models is necessary because of anisotropy found in the cosmic microwave background radiation @xcite .",
    "another open question is how emerging entanglement is affected when going beyond the conformal coupling case .    in the theory of quantum fields in curved spacetime ( see e.g. @xcite ) , matter creation is associated with conformal symmetry breaking of the underling geometry , where the created pairs of particles and anti - particles with opposite momenta are entangled .",
    "we shall consider in the present paper three physical entities responsible for conformal symmetry breaking , namely mass of particles associated with the field , coupling between field and spacetime curvature , small gravitational disturbance ( anisotropy ) .",
    "we then characterize entanglement generated from the vacuum state by the anisotropic expansion of the universe assuming that we have access to particles modes only , and then evaluating the subsystem entropy .",
    "given the relation between entanglement and cosmological parameters we show how it is possible to extract information regarding the underlying geometry from the detected entanglement .",
    "the paper is organized as follow . in section [ section 2 ]",
    "we recall the bogoliubov transformations and we show how to relate their coefficients to the amount of created entanglement . in section [ section 3 ]",
    "we introduce a suitable cosmological model and explicitly compute the bogolyubov coefficients for a scalar field .",
    "next , in section [ ent ] , we show how entanglement within this model is affected by mass of particles , field - spacetime coupling strength , and anisotropy .",
    "section [ sec : para ] deals with the possibility of deriving cosmological parameters from the detected entanglement .",
    "the concluding section [ sec : conclu ] is devoted to summarize the results and to discuss possible extensions of the present work . in appendix",
    "[ app ] , for the sake of comparison with section [ ent ] , are shown results concerning a cosmological model with a different scale factor in the case of conformal coupling .",
    "consider a scalar field @xmath1 and two spacetime regions , called @xmath2-region and @xmath3-region , which we assume to be minkowskian .",
    "let us define two different basis @xmath4 and @xmath5 , with support on the relative region only , which can be used to decompose the field .",
    "elements in the basis set are orthonormal , which means @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 , according to the klein - gordon inner product , defined by [ kg - inn ] ( _ 1,_2)=-i _ d^_1_2^ * , where @xmath9 and @xmath10 , being @xmath11 a unit vector orthogonal to the spacelike hypersurface @xmath12 and @xmath13 the volume element in @xmath12 .",
    "notice that the inner product ( [ kg - inn ] ) is independent of @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "after that , we can associate to each mode @xmath14 and to its complex conjugate @xmath15 annihilation operators @xmath16 and creation operators @xmath17 , such that they satisfy the usual commutation relations @xmath18=\\delta_{kk'}$ ] and @xmath19=0 $ ] .",
    "therefore , we have two equivalent representations of the scalar field @xmath20 each mode can now be expanded in terms of the others @xmath21 which , when substituted in ( [ scadec ] ) implies the so - called bogoliubov transformation and its inverse @xmath22 these relate the ladder operators in the two different representations .",
    "the coefficients @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the well known bogoliubov coefficients , defined as @xmath25 and @xmath26 .    imposing now that @xmath27 and @xmath28 , defined through eq.([dir - bog - tra ] ) ,",
    "satisfy the standard commutation relations , we get @xmath29&=\\sum_k\\left ( \\alpha_{k_1k}^*\\alpha_{k_2k}-\\beta^*_{k_1k}\\beta_{k_2k }   \\right)=\\delta_{k_1\\,k_2},\\\\ \\left[a^{\\dagger\\,out}_{k_1 } , a^{\\dagger\\,out}_{k_2 } \\right]&=\\sum_k\\left ( \\alpha_{k_1k}\\beta_{k_2k}-\\beta_{k_1k}\\alpha_{k_2k }   \\right)=0    \\ , . \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we will be working with an homogeneous metric , meaning that the propagation of the field through the space can be decomposed into modes that will remain plane waves throughout , each with proper wave lenght , @xmath30 .",
    "therefore , the inner product between modes gives a dirac delta and the bogoliubov coefficients have to be @xmath31 plugging these into ( [ dir - bog - tra ] ) , gives diagonal bogoliubov transformations @xmath32 whose main feature is that they do not mix modes .",
    "furthermore eq.([bog - relations ] ) gives [ norm1 ] |_k|^2-|_k|^2=1 .",
    "the expectation value of the number operator for the @xmath3 mode , @xmath33 , in the vacuum state of the @xmath2 mode reads [ part - number ] _",
    "in0|n^out|0_in=|_k|^2 , thanks to eq.([inv - bog - tra1 ] ) .    in the context of cosmology",
    ", @xmath34 is the number of created particles per mode due to the dynamical nature of spacetime .",
    "let us consider now a vacuum state as seen by an observer in the early past ( @xmath2 region ) of our expanding universe .",
    "we focus only on modes @xmath35 for particles and @xmath36 for antiparticles , so that the input state we are considering is @xmath37 .",
    "being a pure state of a bi - partite system , the @xmath2-vacuum can be seen by an observer in the far future ( @xmath3 region ) as [ sch - dec ]    decomposition .",
    "to find the coefficients @xmath38 of ( [ sch - dec ] ) , following @xcite , we use linear independence and the fact that @xmath39 , obtaining c_n=(-)^n c_0 .",
    "then , imposing normalization on ( [ sch - dec ] ) we find that @xmath40 , with [ gamma ] = ||^2 .",
    "note that @xmath41 is always less than one because of ( [ norm1 ] ) .",
    "what we want now is to measure the entanglement between particles and anti - particles modes in the physical state ( [ sch - dec ] ) . to accomplish it we consider , first of all , the corresponding density operator @xmath42 .",
    "after that , the amount of entanglement can be evaluated using the von neumann entropy of the reduced density operator ( e.g. for particles ) @xcite s(k)=-tr(^out_k_2 ^out_k ) , where [ rho - k ] ^out_k = tr_-k(^out_k ,- k)=(1-)_n=0^^n|n_kn|^out .",
    "it then results [ sca - entr - funct ] s(k)=-_2(1-)-_2=_2 ( ) .",
    "let us now look into a specific model of an anisotropic universe filled with a matter field .",
    "the conformal symmetry breaking that leads to particles production can arise by the departure of the background spacetime from conformal flatness .",
    "following @xcite , let us consider a bianchi @xmath43 spacetime with metric ds^2=dt^2-_ia_i^2(t)dx_i^2 . since we assume weak anisotropy , we write @xmath44 .",
    "furthermore we introduce the time parameter @xmath45 to get [ metric ] ds^2=a^2()\\{d^2-_i(dx^i)^2 } , with @xmath46 .",

    "the cosmological parameters @xmath51 and @xmath52 represent , respectively , the expansion rate of the universe and the oscillation frequency of the perturbation .",
    "let us now consider a scale factor which allows us to compute the bogoliubov coefficients for a scalar field coupled with the spacetime just defined .",

    "the amount of anisotropy is therefore quantified by the parameter @xmath82 . if @xmath83 the anisotropy contribution in ( [ v - func ] ) would disappears because of the condition @xmath84 .      the total entanglement entropy and the isotropic entanglement entropy ( where for isostropic we mean the contribution from mass and curvature coupling ) have been plotted in figures [ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] , for @xmath85 and @xmath86 respectively , and with @xmath65",

    "this is sensitive to cosmological parameters and therefore to the choice of the relevant functions ( [ pert - func]),([con - sca - fac ] ) .",
    "the problem is twofold : for large @xmath35 the anisotropic coefficients clearly are not the right ones , while for small @xmath35 the isotropic part is troublesome . in fact",
    "when the mass is large , the approximation works well for the coupling term and badly for the mass term , while the opposite occurs for small mass . anyway , even if our results are trustworthy only in a limited range of @xmath35 , which generally exludes zero , very interesting features show up .",
    "the main is the fact that the total entropy oscillates as a function of @xmath35 after the contribution from isotropic quantities is dropped to zero .",
    "this means that for momenta higher than a certain value anisotropy plays a decisive role in creating and driving entanglement . also ,",
    "as expected , the oscillations are damped and their amplitude increase as @xmath51 decreases .",
    "as @xmath51 increases the entanglement entropy shrinks towards small momenta and oscillations tend to disappear . in this regime",
    "the isotropic contribution is dominant .",
