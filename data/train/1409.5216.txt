    "the lhc operational cycle for proton physics consists of injecting beams of proton bunches from the injector complex into both rings , accelerating them from injection energy ( @xmath0 ) to the flat - top energy ( @xmath1 in 2012 ) , and bringing them into collisions . a full cycle , called a _",
    "fill _ , is divided into different phases , which are commonly referred to as _ beam modes_. this paper covers two effects observed in the part of the cycle after the acceleration phase , which consists of the following beam modes :    * _ squeeze _ : the betatron squeeze , in which the currently separated beams are squeezed to the target collision optics ( in 2012 : @xmath2 ) . *",
    "_ adjust _ : the phase in which the separation between the beams in the interaction points is made to collapse and the beams are brought into collisions .",
    "* _ stable beams _ : the beam mode manually declared by the operators after all adjustments have been made , signalling to the experiments the start of physics data - taking .",
    "physics production fills generally remain in this beam mode for several hours , until the beams are eventually dumped .",
    "the lhc features a @xmath3 rf system corresponding to a bucket length of @xmath4 and a harmonic number of @xmath5 @xcite . for most proton physics production",
    "fills in 2012 , the lhc was filled with @xmath6 spaced bunches . from the sps ,",
    "eight batches of 144 bunches , three batches of 72 bunches , and one batch of six bunches ( witness bunches for transfer line verification ) were injected into each ring of the lhc , totalling 1374 bunches per beam @xcite , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fillingscheme ] .",
    "in the second half of 2012 , instabilities were frequently observed at the end of the squeeze beam mode @xcite in the lhc . despite not causing significant intensity losses or beam dumps ,",
    "these instabilities lead to a non - negligible transverse emittance increase of @xmath7 for the affected bunches .    figure  [ squeezeinstability ] shows , in blue , the horizontal @xcite bunch size measurement acquired for a different bunch every second from the scanning synchrotron light telescope ( bsrt ) system and , in red , the amplitude of the vertical base - band - tune ( bbq ) measurement .",
    "it can be seen that at @xmath819:20 , the bbq amplitude increases , indicating the presence of an instability . at the same time , certain bunches develop a higher transverse emittance ( the horizontal bunch size measurements separate into two bands ) .",
    "when the beams that experienced the end - of - squeeze instabilities go into stable beams , two distinct families of bunches can be seen , according to the evolution of their parameters : bunches with a larger emittance develop both higher losses and a shorter bunch length , possibly due to limits in the off - momentum dynamic aperture .",
    "this effect has historically been labelled ` bunch length histogram splitting ' , as it was visible on the fixed displays in the lhc control room as a double - peaked histogram of beam 1 bunch lengths .",
    "it has been discussed in detail in a previous publication @xcite , so it will not be treated any further in this paper .",
    "the underlying instabilities are subject to current beam  beam studies @xcite .",
    "the impact on the luminosity is mainly emittance - driven : the emittance , derived from the luminosity , at the start of the stable beams period was generally @xmath9 in 2012 , while the emittance of bunches affected by the instability was @xmath10 , with up to 70% of all bunches affected for particular fills in late 2012 .",
    "this corresponds to loss of up to 10% in both peak and integrated luminosity ; for example , from a peak instantaneous luminosity of more than @xmath11 for ` good ' fills to @xmath12 for fills with @xmath13 bunches affected .",
    "a very reproducible loss pattern was observed during long physics fills in 2012 : the integrated losses of the first @xmath14 bunches of each sps batch in beam  1 are up to 10% lower compared to later bunches after @xmath15 in stable beams , while such a pattern was always negligible , if present at all , for beam  2 . in the following analysis , only the batches of 144 bunches are considered for simplicity , although the batches of 72 bunches show the same behaviour .",
    "a similar pattern had already been noticed during 2011 operation @xcite .",
    "the bunch - by - bunch luminosity published by the main experiments and the total process cross - section @xcite allow the intensity lost due to luminosity burn - off to be calculated .",
    "removing the burn - off component from the total losses does not change the overall loss pattern , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ losspatterns ] .",
    "the cause of the pattern is as yet unknown ; in particular , no correlation with the number of long - range interactions has been identified .",
    "however , the loss structure of beam 1 clearly depends on the preceding gaps with no beam ( see fig .  [ fillingscheme ] ) : after each 36 bunches , a local decrease in losses is visible after the sps injection kicker gap , and the first bunches in the first sps batch after the large lhc dump kicker gap lose even less compared to the same bunches in later sps batches ( the lower blue curves in fig .",
    "[ losspatterns ] ) .      fitting a linear function to the integrated losses of the first 30 bunches of each sps batch",
    "allows the difference in losses among those bunches and therefore the strength of the effect to be quantified ; averaging over all 144 bunches of each sps batch shows the impact on the total losses .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ lossstats_expl ] for one sample fill .    figure  [ lossstats ] shows this analysis applied for all 2012 fills that lasted for at least @xmath15 in stable beams .",
    "it is to be noted that @xmath16 , the observed difference over the first 30 bunches , suddenly increases from less than 5% to up to @xmath17 after fill 2875 ( see fig .",
    "[ lossstats](a ) ) .",
    "this is suspected to be correlated with the increase of the bunch length target for the ramp from @xmath18 to @xmath19 from fill 2880 onwards , indicating that the pattern is correlated with longitudinal losses .",
    "an increase of @xmath20 , the average intensity loss of all bunches , is also observed for the same fills ( fig .",
    "[ lossstats](b ) ) , while @xmath21 , the intensity loss of the first bunch of each sps batch , remains at the same level ( fig .",
    "[ lossstats](c ) ) .      increased losses lead to a lower total intensity and therefore to a lower integrated luminosity for the same fill duration due to a decreased luminosity lifetime , which is defined as @xmath22 in    @xmath23    in the bunch - by - bunch luminosity lifetime calculated by fitting eq .",
    "[ llt ] to the luminosity per colliding bunch pair published by the atlas experiment for a time window of @xmath24 set at @xmath25 after the start of stable beams , the impact of the beam 1 loss pattern is visible , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ losspattern_lumi_lt ] .",
    "the increased total losses after fill 2875 are also visible on the total luminosity lifetime . as shown in fig .",
    "[ lossstats_lumi_lt ] , the luminosity lifetime after fill 2875 is on average @xmath26 lower in the long term compared to earlier fills . despite the rather large spread of the values , the bunch - by - bunch pattern observed ( fig .  [ losspattern_lumi_lt ] ) indicates a correlation with the loss pattern in question . assuming the same peak luminosity , this decrease in luminosity lifetime corresponds to a @xmath27 loss in integrated luminosity for a fill lasting @xmath15 in stable beams .",
    "observations on two distinct effects that affect the lhc luminosity production were studied and presented in this paper .",
    "first , instabilities at the end of the betatron squeeze increased the transverse emittances of selected bunches by @xmath7 .",
    "up to 70% of all bunches in beam 1 were affected in late 2012 , resulting in a loss of up to 10% of both peak and integrated luminosity .",
    "second , bunch - by - bunch observations on the integrated intensity losses of beam 1 bunches showed a very reproducible pattern building up over several hours in stable beams on 144-bunch sps batches , while no such pattern was observed on beam 2 . a clear cause for the pattern has not been identified yet , but the differences in losses over a sps batch , as well as the average losses , increased after an increase in bunch length , indicating a correlation with longitudinal losses .",
    "the shorter luminosity lifetime due to the increased losses leads to a loss of @xmath27 of integrated luminosity for long fills .",
    "the authors would like to thank g.  arduini , x.  buffat , w.  herr , t.  pieloni , the lhc beam - beam team , and the lhc beam operation committee for fruitful discussions on the topics covered by this paper .        until june 2012",
    ", a slightly different filling scheme including 12 witness bunches per beam ( and therefore 1380 bunches in total ) was used . no change in the loss pattern",
    "was observed due to the different filling scheme ."
