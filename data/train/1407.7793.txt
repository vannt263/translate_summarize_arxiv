    "the cosmological picture of an accelerating universe which came into limelight through seminal papers of perlmutter et al .",
    "@xcite and riess et al .",
    "@xcite is , at present , a well established scientific truth .",
    "the accelerating agent is termed as dark energy and the vintage cosmological term @xmath0 is a favourite choice of the researchers working with lambda - dark energy models as the dark energy representative .",
    "although einstein @xcite introduced @xmath0 as a constant in his field equations , due to cosmological problem and coincidence problem , now - a - days in most of the cases it is considered as a dynamical quantity @xcite . on the other hand , the gravitational constant @xmath1 is , in general , taken as a constant",
    ". however , sufficient amount of works related to variability of @xmath1 , both at theoretical and experimental front , are also available in literature @xcite .    in the third decade of the previous century , kaluza @xcite and klein @xcite attempted to unify electro - magnetic force with gravitational force which resulted in the development of kaluza - klein ( kk ) theory . in kk approach , an extra dimension , viz .",
    "fifth dimension was introduced for coupling the two forces mentioned earlier .",
    "chodos and detweiler @xcite have shown in their five dimensional model that the extra dimension contracts due to cosmic evolution . according to guth @xcite and alvarez and gavela @xcite , production of huge entropy due to the presence of an extra dimension",
    "can solve the flatness and horizon problems without invoking the idea of inflation .",
    "so , five dimensional model in the framework of kk theory has been successful in addressing some of the problematic issues of big bang cosmology and other realm of physics ( for a critical review on the kk theory one can look at the new - born article by wesson @xcite ) .",
    "a number of works are available in the literature where one or both of the cosmological constant @xmath0 and the gravitational constant @xmath1 are assumed to be variable .",
    "pradhan et al .",
    "@xcite and ozel et al .",
    "@xcite worked in the framework of kk cosmology with variable @xmath0 and constant @xmath1 while mukhopadhyay et al .",
    "@xcite performed an @xmath2-dimensional investigation with both @xmath0 and @xmath1 as variables .",
    "sharif and khanum @xcite and more recently oli @xcite have worked with kk cosmological models by considering both @xmath0 and @xmath1 as variables .",
    "a special note to the work of sharif and khanum @xcite is that they have investigated the effect of @xmath3 model ( where @xmath4 is a parameter ) in kk cosmology with variable @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "ray et al .",
    "@xcite showed the equivalence of @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 models in the four dimensional frw spacetime .",
    "so , the major motivations of the present work is to explore those features which were not touched upon in the work of sharif and khanum  @xcite .",
    "although generalized energy conservation law for variable @xmath0 and @xmath1 models have been derived by shapiro et al .",
    "@xcite and vereschagin et al .",
    "@xcite in two different ways , shapiro et al .",
    "@xcite have mentioned in their work that without any loss of generality usual energy conservation law can be retained for variable @xmath0 and variable @xmath1 models .",
    "beesham @xcite has supported this idea of retention of usual energy conservation law by stating that the usual energy conservation law can be used within a simple framework of variable @xmath0 and @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 deals with field equations and their solutions ; physical features explored in the work are presented in section 3 while some discussions are done in section 4 .",
    "the metric of kk cosmology is given by @xmath8\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath9 .",
    "perfect fluid energy - momentum tensor takes the usual form as @xmath10 where @xmath11 , @xmath12 = @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are five- velocity satisfying @xmath19 = @xmath14 , @xmath20 is the energy density and @xmath21 is the pressure of the cosmic fluid .",
    "the einstein field equations are given by @xmath22 where the terms used have their usual meanings .",
    "using ( 1 ) - ( 3 ) we have the following two equations @xmath23    @xmath24    for a flat universe , @xmath25 and hence eqs . ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) reduce to @xmath26    @xmath27    where @xmath28 is the hubble parameter .",
    "the continuity equation yields @xmath29 while the equation of state is @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the barotropic index .",
    "let us use the ansatz @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is a parameter .",
    "this type of model was dealt by overduin and cooperstock @xcite and arbab @xcite to account for the accelerating phase of the present universe .",
    "then equation ( 6 ) becomes @xmath34    also equation ( 7 ) reduces to @xmath35    dividing ( 11 ) by ( 10 ) and then simplifying we get @xmath36 which on integration yields the solution set as @xmath37    @xmath38    , with respect to age of the universe , @xmath39 , as given by equation ( 13 ) . the solid , dotted , dashed , long - dashed and dot - dashed curves represent @xmath40 and @xmath41 , respectively . ]",
    "@xmath42    @xmath43    @xmath44    @xmath45    to obtain the present - day feature of the dust filled universe one should put the constraint @xmath46 in the general form of eqs .",
    "( 13)-(18 ) .",
    "the physical features of the present model in the framework of kaluza - klein theory are buried in its solution set through eqs .",
    "( 13 ) - ( 17 ) .",
    "we choose here the numerical value of @xmath33 from the range @xmath47 in its lower limit i.e. @xmath48  @xcite , which represents the observed accelerated expansion , and then plot these solutions for different values of @xmath49 and @xmath41 as represented by solid , dotted , dashed , long - dashed and dot - dashed curves in figs .  1 - 5 .",
    "we take here , for simplicity , @xmath50 in eqs .",
    "( 14 ) , ( 16 ) and ( 13 ) , where they appear as a multiplier or divider .",
    "the obvious physical features are discussed below :    \\(i ) we find the condition , @xmath51 , for any physical validity of the solutions .",
    "\\(ii ) for the values , @xmath52 or @xmath53 or @xmath54 , @xmath0 becomes zero . here , the last two conditions , @xmath53 and @xmath54 , yield the unphysical situation , @xmath55 .",
    "\\(iii ) also , along with @xmath0 the hubble parameter reduces to zero with @xmath54 while both the scale factor and the matter - energy density become constant .",
    "none of these features support the present cosmological scenario .",
    "\\(iv ) with @xmath52 , @xmath1 becomes constant .",
    "thus the present model does not permit time variation of @xmath1 in the absence of the cosmological parameter @xmath0 .",
    "\\(v ) we also find @xmath56 from eq .",
    "( 14 ) with @xmath57 . with the present value of the hubble parameter as @xmath58 , the age of the universe comes out to be @xmath59 gyr which is much below the accepted range of @xmath60 to @xmath61 gyr ( see table 2 of the ref .",
    "@xcite ) . if we want to retain the non - zero values of @xmath33 and @xmath31 such that @xmath62 and @xmath63 respectively then the above value of the age , viz .",
    "@xmath59 gyr can be obtained . however , to attain the modern - day accepted value @xmath64 gyr one has to put @xmath65 .",
    "thus it is observed that with proper tuning of @xmath33 one may recover the age of the universe for any value of @xmath31 . in this",
    "regard we would also like to make a general comment that all the above discussion justify the necessity of the inclusion of @xmath0 in the field equations .",
    "\\(vi ) we also find inverse square law between time and density , @xmath66 , for @xmath46 .",
    "this relationship of @xmath20 with cosmic time was obtained earlier by ray et al .",
    "@xcite in four dimensional model with @xmath0 .",
    "\\(vii ) a negative value of the deceleration parameter , @xmath67 , signifies the present accelerating phase . for the given value @xmath48 ,",
    "the deceleration parameter @xmath67 ( eq .  18 ) flips the sign and becomes positive if @xmath68 . for the dust filled case ( @xmath46 )",
    ", @xmath67 flips the sign if @xmath69 .",
    "a significant aspect of the evolution of the universe is the flip over from a previously decelerating phase to the present accelerating one @xcite .",
    "so , the deceleration parameter @xmath67 must show a signature flipping to indicate that turnover and hence evolution of the universe .",
    "\\(viii ) all the plots for @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 are found sensitive with the variation of @xmath31 as it stands in the exponent of time and also due to the @xmath75 factor in the denominator .",
    "there is a little variation for the scale factor , @xmath70 , at @xmath76 irrespective of the value of @xmath31 .",
    "however , there is a large variation in the values of @xmath70 with respect to time . for the hubble parameter",
    ", we find large or small value depending on @xmath31 , which tend to zero with increasing time .",
    "the @xmath0 parameter is found to be always positive for the given @xmath33 and @xmath31 and thus acts as an dark energy agent of the accelerating scenario of the universe .    like @xmath70",
    ", there is not much variation in the density , @xmath20 , at @xmath76 . for @xmath31=0",
    ", density is found increasing with time .",
    "however , it shoots up at smaller time for non - zero values of @xmath31 .",
    "this type of feature has been observed by ray et al .",
    "@xcite for which they made a comment that idea of inflation is inherent in the phenomenological model @xmath32 .    in the present investigation",
    "the gravitational parameter @xmath1 varies with time and is also found sensitive with @xmath31 .",
    "in the present work we study cosmic evolution under the framework of kluza - klein cosmology . the emphasis has been on dynamic @xmath0 model with varying gravitational constant .",
    "we present our solutions for the scale factor , hubble parameter , gravitational constant and density with respect to time @xmath39 .",
    "these are also plotted for various values of equation of state parameter , @xmath31 .",
    "interesting physical features of these solutions have been summarized and discussed .",
    "solutions are mostly found in accordance of the observed features of the universe .",
    "we find that the time variation of the gravitational constant is not permitted without inclusion of @xmath0 .",
    "signature flipping of the deceleration parameter is attainable . besides",
    ", some previous results are also recovered in the present work .",
    "for instance , relationship of both the matter - energy density @xcite and gravitational constant @xcite can be recovered from eqs .",
    "( 16 ) and ( 17 ) respectively .",
    "the present work therefore can be regarded as a continuation of two previous works @xcite related to variation of the gravitational constant @xmath1 and also confirmation of some of the earlier results @xcite .    however , in the present phenomenological investigation of simple and elegant type some of the crucial issues have not been addressed , such as : _ firstly _ , calculation of the evolution of linear perturbations in this model .",
    "this point is particularly important , as the expansion laws are easy to match with observations , and distinguishing between models requires information on the perturbations . _",
    "secondly _ , one can raise a simple question such that where is the fifth dimension now",
    "? actually eq . ( 1 ) suggests that the fifth dimension is large and is around us .",
    "therefore , there must be a mechanism to make it small as modern physicists worry a lot about how to make the extra - dimensions compactified and one can again look at the review on kk theory by wesson @xcite to get a possible way out from the problem .",
    "all these aspects can , for the time being , be left as future efforts .",
