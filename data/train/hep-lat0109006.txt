    "the @xmath1 and @xmath2 semi - leptonic decays have a considerable phenomenological interest , since they can be studied to determine the modulus of ckm matrix element @xmath8 .",
    "furthermore , the presence of non - perturbative physics in these decays makes a lattice study particularly appealing .",
    "the predictions of the heavy quark effective theory ( hqet ) can be used to constrain the form of the matrix elements that describe semi - leptonic decays of heavy - light mesons . in particular ,",
    "the relevant matrix elements are expressed in terms of a set of form factors , that contain the non - perturbative physics of the decay :    @xmath9(\\epsilon^*\\cdot v)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath10 are the velocities of the initial and the final meson respectively , and @xmath11 ; @xmath12 is the polarisation vector of the @xmath13 meson . in the heavy quark limit ,",
    "the six form factors become related to a universal function known as the isgur - wise function , @xmath14 . however , there are two kinds of corrections to the heavy quark symmetry that one has to take into account : perturbative qcd corrections and symmetry breaking corrections proportional to inverse powers of the heavy quark mass . in terms of these corrections ,",
    "the relations between the form factors and @xmath14 are @xcite :    @xmath15\\xi(\\omega)\\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the @xmath16 terms are constants that fix the behaviour of the form factors in absence of corrections ( @xmath17 ; @xmath18 )",
    ". the @xmath19 and @xmath20 functions account for radiative corrections and power corrections of @xmath21 respectively .",
    "the radiative corrections are calculable in perturbation theory , while the power corrections are non - perturbative in nature @xcite . at zero recoil ( @xmath22 ) , however , luke s theorem @xcite guarantees that both @xmath23 and @xmath24 are of order @xmath25 . at small",
    "recoil , the isgur - wise function is modeled by :    @xmath26    where @xmath27 is called the slope parameter and @xmath28 because of current conservation .",
    "alternative parametrisations of @xmath14 have been proposed , which start to differ from ( [ eqn : linearwisgur ] ) at @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "the calculations presented in this work were performed using a non - perturbatively @xmath30 improved action ( sw , @xmath31 ) , within the quenched approximation , at @xmath3 , on a set of @xmath32 configurations , with a volume of @xmath33 .",
    "the improvement coefficients for the current operators were taken from the work of bhattacharya _ et al .",
    "the inverse lattice spacing , set using the sommer scale @xmath34 @xcite , was @xmath35 .",
    "the matrix elements have been extracted for eight combinations of the heavy quark masses ( @xmath36 ) and two values of the mass of light ( passive ) quark ( @xmath37 ) . since , at fixed @xmath38 , the residual dependence of @xmath14 on the heavy quark mass was statistically negligible , no extrapolations were necessary .",
    "the isgur - wise function has been extracted independently from the @xmath39 and @xmath40 form factors , that at @xmath41 are protected from @xmath42 power corrections by luke s theorem :    @xmath43    the power corrections have been neglected , as they have been estimated and found to be consistent with zero in the range @xmath44 .",
    "it is not possible to extract the isgur - wise function from the form factors for which @xmath45 as they are just a collection of qcd corrections ; similarly , the @xmath46 form factor could not be used because its power correction has been found large .",
    "the isgur - wise function has been fitted to the linear model ( [ eqn : linearwisgur ] ) .",
    "unconstrained fits have also been performed , i.e. relaxing the condition @xmath28 . in both decays , @xmath47 was found to be consistent with one .",
    "results are summarized in table ( [ tab : wisgur_fits ] ) and plotted in figure ( [ fig : wisgur ] ) .",
    "the data from the two decays are in excellent agreement with each other and lie consistently on the same line .",
    ".results of the linear fits the isgur - wise function , with and without the @xmath28 constraint .",
    "quoted errors are statistical . [ cols=\"<,<,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "the two following ratios of form factors have also been calculated :    @xmath48    these two ratios would be equal to one in the absence of symmetry breaking corrections . figures ( [ fig : r1 ] ) and ( [ fig : r2 ] ) show that this work s determinations are in agreement with the experimental determinations by the cleo collaboration @xcite .",
    "the systematic uncertainty on the slope of the isgur - wise function has been estimated considering the effect of the choice of the scale - fixing quantity , the residual light quark mass dependence , and the effect of using different non - zero momentum kinematic channels .",
    "three alternative models of the isgur - wise function have been considered , and the variation in the extracted slope parameter has been taken as a systematic uncertainty .",
    "the slope of the isgur - wise function has been extracted from a lattice study of the @xmath1 and @xmath2 semi - leptonic decays , using a @xmath30 non - perturbatively improved action at @xmath3 .",
    "the results from the two decays have been found in good agreement : @xmath5 from @xmath2 and @xmath6 from @xmath1 .",
    "this result is in good agreement with previous calculations performed by members of the ukqcd collaboration , which did not use a full set of non - perturbatively determined improvement coefficients @xcite",
