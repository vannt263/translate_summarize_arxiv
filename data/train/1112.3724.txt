    "the physical properties of bose - einstein condensates of atoms with nonzero spin can be tuned by external laser fields and magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "these condensates are much less affected by defects and impurities which exist extensively in usual condensed matter systems .",
    "therefore , the condensates can be used to simulate a variety of ideal condensed matter systems ( e.g. , the system of gluons ) for academic studies , or to work as ideal magnetic materials in practical application ( say , in quantum information and quantum computation ) . for the purpose of manipulation , how the condensates will react to an external magnetic field",
    "is a crucial problem to be clarified .",
    "usually , the particle number @xmath3 in a condensate would @xmath4 .",
    "if @xmath3 could be greatly reduced , new physics might emerge .",
    "for an example , for spin-2 condensates , it was predicted based on the mean field theory ( mft ) that the ground state would have three phases , namely , the ferromagnetic phase ( @xmath5-phase ) , polar phase ( @xmath6-phase ) , and cyclic phase ( @xmath7-phase ) @xcite .",
    "however , from a study based on a theory beyond the mft , the ground state may have 3 , 4 , or 5 phases depending on @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "the fine effect of @xmath3 could only be seen if @xmath3 is small ( say , @xmath8 ) . when @xmath3 is small , the properties of the condensates might depend on @xmath3 sensitively , just as the properties of the nuclei depend on the number of nucleons sensitively . on the other hand , recent progress in technique",
    "suggests that the condensates with @xmath3 very small could be experimentally achieved @xcite .",
    "therefore , a study of the small condensates is worthy because new knowledge additional to those from large condensates might be obtained .",
    "this paper is dedicated to small spin-2 condensates , and is a generalization of two previous papers @xcite on spin-2 and spin-1 condensates .",
    "the method adopted is beyond the mft .",
    "the aim is to study the sensitivity of the small condensates responding to the variation of an external magnetic field @xmath0 . to this aim",
    "the fidelity susceptibility @xcite and the average population of spin - components have been calculated . to clarify the underlying physics , the set of eigenstates with the @xmath1 symmetry firstly proposed in the refs .",
    "@xcite is introduced .",
    "based on the set , elementary excitation modes caused by the quadratic zeeman term have been found .",
    "these modes together with the associated energy gap are decisive to the response of the spin - structures against the appearance of @xmath0 .",
    "it is well known that the structures of the ground states depend on the interaction .",
    "on the other hand , the ways of excitation caused by the field is found to be strongly constrained by the inherent symmetry .",
    "thus both the interaction and symmetry together determine the response of the condensates to the field as shown below .",
    "since the study is not dedicated to a specific spin-2 system , the parameters of the spin - dependent interaction are considered as variable .",
    "mostly @xmath2 is given , the effect of a larger or smaller @xmath3 is also discussed .",
    "the atoms are assumed to be confined by an isotropic and parabolic potential @xmath9 .",
    "the temperature @xmath10 is assumed to be very low . since the energy of spatial excitation of individual atom is @xmath11 , when @xmath12 it is reasonable to assume that no atoms would be spatially excited and all of them would fall into a common spatial - state @xmath13 .",
    "this assumption is called the single mode approximation ( sma ) , which has been quite frequently used in the literatures . furthermore , a magnetic field @xmath0 lying along the @xmath14-axis is set .",
    "when an integration is carried out over the spatial degrees of freedom , we arrive at a model hamiltonian depending only on the spin - degrees of freedom as@xcite @xmath15 where an overall constant has been neglected , @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the combined spin of the particles @xmath18 and @xmath19 , @xmath20 is the projector of the @xmath17-channel , @xmath21 is the strength of interaction related directly to the @xmath22-wave scattering length of the @xmath17-channel , @xmath23 , and the last two terms are for the linear and quadratic zeeman energies , respectively . note that @xmath24 .",
    "we further introduce @xmath25 and @xmath26 so that @xmath27 , @xmath28",
    ". then we define @xmath29 . furthermore ,",
    "since @xmath30 ( the @xmath14-component of the total spin ) remains to be conserved under the field @xmath0 , the linear zeeman term provides only a constant and therefore can be neglected .",
    "when all the constants involved are removed , @xmath31 can be rewritten as @xmath32 where @xmath26 is from 0 to @xmath33 , @xmath34 . when the hamiltonian is transformed from eq .",
    "( [ e01_hmod ] ) to ( [ e02_hmodp ] ) , the set of eigenenergies will be multiplied by a common constant and will be further shifted as a whole .",
    "but the eigenstates will remain unchanged .",
    "since only two parameters @xmath26 and @xmath35 are contained in @xmath36 , related analysis is easier to perform .    when @xmath37 , it has been proved that @xmath31 can be rewritten as a sum of four casimir operators of a chain of groups @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "therefore the problem can be solved analytically based on the group algebra @xcite .",
    "three quantum numbers , namely , @xmath38 ( total spin ) , @xmath30 ( its @xmath14-component ) , and @xmath39 ( seniority , @xmath40 must be an even integer , and @xmath41 is the number of singlet pairs ) are introduced to classify the states .",
    "the eigenenergies related to these quantum numbers are @xmath42 where an irrelevant overall constant depending on @xmath3 has been further neglected .",
    "the associated eigenstates are denoted as @xmath43 .",
    "note that , for specifying a symmetry - adapted eigenstate , not all the @xmath44 pairs are allowed .",
    "some of them are prohibited by inherent symmetry .",
    "the details are referred to @xcite .",
    "( [ e03_evf ] ) leads to a notable feature , namely , when @xmath45 , all the symmetry - adapted @xmath43 with the same @xmath38 are degenerate .",
    "whereas when @xmath46 , all the symmetry - adapted @xmath43 with the same @xmath39 are degenerate .",
    "if the group of degenerate states happens to be the ground states , the low - temperature behavior of the condensate would be seriously affected .",
    "in general , a slight increase of @xmath3 ( say from being even to odd ) will affect the structure of the ground state .",
    "however , when @xmath3 is large , the effect is weak . for the convenience of discussion , it is assumed that @xmath3 is a multiple of 2 and 3 in the follows ( other cases of @xmath3 can be similarly discussed ) .",
    "when @xmath26 and @xmath30 are fixed ( @xmath47 is assumed ) , from eq .",
    "( [ e03_evf ] ) and from the symmetry - adaptability , the pair @xmath48 for the ground state ( the lowest state with the given @xmath30 ) can be determined .",
    "when @xmath49 , based on the method of group algebra , there are three regions of @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "when @xmath26 is from @xmath50 to @xmath51<\\pi$ ] ( region i ) , @xmath52 and @xmath53 , and accordingly the ground state is in the @xmath5-phase . in this phase",
    "all the spins are nearly aligned along a common direction to form a total spin , which is vertical to the @xmath14-axis ( if @xmath49 ) and has an arbitrary azimuthal angle .",
    "when @xmath26 is from @xmath54 to @xmath55 ( region ii ) , @xmath56 and @xmath57 , and accordingly in the @xmath6-phase , in which the spins are two - by - two to form the singlet pairs ( if @xmath3 is odd , the ground state would have @xmath58 and @xmath59 , and accordingly would be composed of a group of singlet pairs together with a single particle .",

    "the division into three regions based on the group algebra coincides with that from the mft when @xmath3 is sufficiently large@xcite .",
    "nonetheless , the details of spin correlations can be understood from the former but can not from the mft .    when @xmath61 , there is no analytical solution .",

    "thereby exact eigenstates @xmath68 of @xmath31 can be obtained , where @xmath18 is a serial number of the series of states with the given @xmath30 ( @xmath69 denotes the ground state ) .",

    "the case with @xmath49 is firstly considered .",
    "firstly , we would like to study the sensitivity of the ground state @xmath70 against the variation of the field . for this purpose the fidelity susceptibility @xcite @xmath71 has been calculated .",
    "a larger @xmath72 implies that the deviation between @xmath73 and @xmath70 is larger , thus the state responds more sensitively to @xmath35 .",
    "therefore this quantity measures quantitatively the sensitivity . from the eigenstates @xmath74 and @xmath75 (",
