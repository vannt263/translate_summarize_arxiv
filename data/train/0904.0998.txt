    "in recent years the increasing amount and accuracy of astronomical data has improved our knowledge about the composition and evolution of the universe dramatically .",
    "measurements of the temperature anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background , supernova surveys and the analysis of the power spectrum of galaxy clustering are in concordance with a spatially flat universe , which has recently become dominated by vacuum energy @xmath1 and cold dark matter ( cdm )  the so - called @xmath1cdm model ( for a review see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . with the increasing precision of cosmological parameters",
    "it is feasible that exotic particle interactions with a tiny rate @xmath2 comparable to the hubble expansion rate @xmath3 can be tested in cosmological surveys .",
    "in particular , luminosity distance measurements of cosmological standard candles like type ia supernovae ( sne )  @xcite might test feeble photon interactions with background magnetic fields , radiation and matter .",
    "the luminosity distance @xmath4 is defined as @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the luminosity of the standard candle ( assumed to be sufficiently well - known ) and @xmath7 the measured flux . if the flux from a source at redshift @xmath8 is attenuated by a factor @xmath9 the observed luminosity distance _ increases _ as @xmath10    the apparent extension of the luminosity distance by photon interactions and oscillations has been investigated in the context of axion - like particles  @xcite , hidden photons  @xcite , and also chameleons  @xcite .",
    "one of the main attractions of these models is the possibility that the conclusions about the energy content of our universe drawn from the hubble diagram can be dramatically altered . in particular , a contribution of dark energy as the source of the observed accelerated late - time expansion of the universe could be completely avoided by a strong dimming effect .    in this paper",
    "we will consider the possibility to constrain mini - charged particles ( mcps ) by their effect on the luminosity  redshift relation in the standard cosmological model . at first glance ,",
    "these hypothetical particles seem to be at odds with the observation that all known elementary particles obey the principle of charge quantization , _",
    "i.e. _ all charge ratios appear to be rational numbers close to unity .",
    "moreover , there are attractive extensions of the standard model , in particular grand unified theories that enforce this quantization naturally .",
    "however , charge quantization need not to be a fundamental principle and it is possible that extensions of the standard model include very light particles with extremely small electromagnetic charges . in particular",
    ", mcps may arise naturally in extensions of the standard model via gauge kinetic mixing  @xcite or in extra - dimensional scenarios  @xcite .",
    "typical predicted values for the mini - charge @xmath11 cover a wide range between @xmath12 and @xmath13 in terms of the electron s",
    "charge  @xcite .",
    "we will focus in this paper on sn dimming in a simple extension of the standard model by one additional mcp , either a dirac spinor or a scalar .",
    "we will show that , even with the rather large observational errors involved in redshift surveys , the limit on the charge @xmath11 of very light mcps is about two order of magnitude stronger than laboratory bounds  @xcite .",
    "this supplements comparable ( and even stronger ) bounds from the study of cosmological and astrophysical environments ( for reviews see  @xcite ) .",
    "note , that non - minimal mcp models , in particular kinetic mixing scenarios with additional abelian gauge bosons can partially alter these charge bounds .",
    "we will also comment on this effect on our limits from sn dimming .",
    "finally , we briefly speculate about a strong dimming effect as an alternative to dark energy .",
    "pair production of mcps by star light may take place via interactions in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) or via photon decay in the inter - galactic ( ig ) electron plasma and magnetic field .",
    "the latter process dominates in the high - frequency ( @xmath14 ) and strong - field ( @xmath15 ) limit with an average ig magnetic field strength denotes the ig field component perpendicular to the line of sight .",
    "] @xmath16 of the order of @xmath17ng  @xcite .",
    "the mcp pair production rate for unpolarized light is given as , @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 . ]",
    "@xmath21 where we assume @xmath22 with @xmath23 for ` replenishing ' and @xmath24 for ` adiabatic ' magnetic field expansion .",
    "the polarization - averaged quantity @xmath25 ( see refs .",
    "@xcite ) can be parametrized by the dimensionless parameter @xmath26 where we have introduced the abbreviations @xmath27 , @xmath28 , _ etc . _",
    "asymptotically , @xmath29 is given by @xmath30 with @xmath31 for dirac spinors and @xmath32 for scalars .",
    "for @xmath33  corresponding to the high - frequency and strong - field limit ",
    "the pair production rate  ( [ gig ] ) is independent of the mcp mass and can be written @xmath34 note , that in this limit the mcp pair production rate is stronger for lower photon frequencies , resulting in a _ blueing _ of distant star light .",
    "+    the differential flux of photons from a source at redshift @xmath8 is reduced by the exponential factor @xmath35 where the propagation distance @xmath36 is given by with hubble parameter @xmath3 .",
    "hence , the modified luminosity distance  ( [ dl ] ) of a source observed in a ( small ) frequency band centered at @xmath37 increases as @xmath38 where in a homogeneous and isotropic universe the luminosity distance is predicted as @xmath39 with @xmath40 and @xmath41 for spatial curvature , respectively .",
    "as an example , the upper panel of fig .  [ dimming ] shows the contribution from two mcp set - ups in the @xmath1cdm model with @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "the hubble parameter at redshift @xmath8 is given by where the present hubble expansion is with @xmath44 .",
    "the luminosity distance is shown as the difference between the measured apparent magnitude @xmath45 and the known absolute magnitude @xmath46 given by @xmath47    the mcp pair production rate  ( [ gig ] ) only depends on the mcp charge @xmath11 in the limit @xmath48 . in the lower panel of fig .  [ dimming ] we show the modified reduced @xmath49 value in comparison with the sne ia ` union ' compilation  @xcite for a varying mcp charge @xmath11 in the limit of small mcp masses . from this",
    "we can derive an upper bound on the charge of mcps with mass @xmath50  ev ( _ cf .",
    "_  eq .  ( [ lambda ] ) ) of compared to the case of dirac spinors . ]",
    "@xmath51 for larger mcp masses the rate @xmath52 becomes mass - dependent and the mcp dimming effect sets in at higher redshift ( _ cf .",
    "_  upper panel of fig .",
    "[ dimming ] ) . in this mass - region",
    "the sensitivity of the hubble diagram to mcp production is limited by the observational errors .",
    "the limit ( [ limit ] ) improves laboratory bounds on mcp charges by about two order of magnitude  @xcite and supplements other cosmological and astrophysical bounds in the range @xmath53 coming from the effect of mcps on big bang nucleosynthesis or on the evolution of stellar objects like sn 1987a , red giants and white dwarves ( for reviews see ref .",
    "however , it has been argued that these bounds could be ( partially ) avoided in non - minimal hidden sector models  @xcite .",
    "there are also strong bounds @xmath54 from the study of the cosmic microwave background  @xcite , which can even be extended to @xmath55 in kinetic mixing scenarios considering the scattering processes involving the additional hidden photons . the effect of the hidden photon in sn dimming is the exact _",
    "opposite_. a photon emitted from the source is only initially in its electromagnetic interaction eigenstate . after a distance of the order of @xmath56 ,",
    "the state has evolved into a superposition of the photon and hidden photon states , whose combined coupling to the mcp is drastically reduced  @xcite . hence ,",
    "a kinetic mcp production rate @xmath52 as low as the hubble expansion rate is not observable in this scenario and our bound does not apply in this case .",
    "we have shown that light mcps with a charge larger than a few@xmath57 can have an observable effect on the luminosity distance measured by sn surveys .",
    "so far we have only considered the limits on possible values of mcp charges and masses that arise from a comparison with the @xmath1cdm model .",
    "however , one might also ask if the dimming effect of mcps could be significant enough to change the usual conclusion of the underlying cosmological model .",
    "in particular , the accelerated late - time expansion of the universe observed by sn surveys could be attributed to a strong mcp dimming in a flat cdm model with @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "before we start to sketch a possible model , we would like to stress that the @xmath1cdm model is also ( indirectly ) substantiated by other cosmological observations , in particular by the analysis of angular anisotropies in the cmb and of spatial correlations in the large - scale distribution of galaxies  @xcite .",
    "however , these observations can be fitted equally satisfactorily in alternative models which have a small component of neutrino hot dark matter and invoke non scale - free primordial density fluctuations ( for a critical review see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "figure  [ deexample ] shows an example of a mini - charged dirac spinor with charge @xmath60 and mass @xmath61  ev in a cdm model .",
    "we assume an adiabatically expanding ( @xmath62 ) ig magnetic field with strength @xmath63  ng .",
    "the apparent luminosity distance ( [ approx ] ) is practically indistinguishable from the @xmath1cdm prediction .",
    "note , however , that the photon absorption in the background magnetic field is achromatic since @xmath64 in the @xmath65 region .",
    "this produces a _ negative _ colour - excess between the b and v band of the form , @xmath66 & \\equiv \\delta(m - m)_{\\rm b } - \\delta(m - m)_{\\rm v}\\\\\\nonumber & \\simeq-0.15\\left(1-(1+z)^{-1/2}\\right)\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which is also indicated in fig .",
    "[ deexample ] . for @xmath67",
    "the colour - excess is @xmath68|\\gtrsim0.03 $ ] , which seems already to challenge the observed colour - excess of high - redshift sne  @xcite ( see also discussions in refs .",
    "though this might constrain sn dimming by mcps as a ( full ) dark energy alternative , it should be possible to derive even stronger bounds on mcp charges by this achromaticity .",
    "the luminosity  redshift relation of cosmological standard candles provides information about the energy composition and geometry of our universe .",
    "the long distance covered by photons from these sources is sensitive to the production of hypothetical weakly interacting and light particles in the inter - galactic environment .",
    "we have shown that mini - charged dirac spinors with mass @xmath50  ev and charge @xmath69 are excluded by their dimming of sne in conflict with the relation in the cosmological ` concordance model ' .",
    "this bound supplements other strong limits on mcp charges from cosmological and astrophysical environments .",
    "on the other hand , if the dimming by mcp pair production is strong , the cosmological interpretation of sn surveys could be considerably modified .",
    "we have sketched a mcp model with an adiabatically expanding inter - galactic magnetic field of @xmath17  ng that reproduces the observed luminosity distance of sne from a cdm model with @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "a characteristic feature of this sn dimming mechanism is a _ blueing _ of the star light , giving a _ negative _ colour - excess with @xmath72|\\lesssim0.06 $ ] for redshift @xmath73 .",
