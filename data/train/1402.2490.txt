    "large - scale solar - wind disturbances in the interplanetary medium ( ipm ) can , and frequently do , distort radio - wave fronts coming from compact radio sources producing the so - called interplanetary scintillation ( ips ) @xcite .",
    "it is known that radio sources with an angular diameter smaller than 1 arcsec present interplanetary scintillation at frequencies @xmath10.1hz @xcite ; though , depending on the observing wavelength , ips can be present beyond 10hz @xcite .",
    "ips on a large number of compact radio sources has been observed using the _ ooty radio telescope _ ( ort ) , _ solar - terrestrial environment laboratory _ ( stel ) and _ mexican array radio telescope _ ( mexart ) , providing insight on solar - wind properties @xcite .",
    "solar events can affect the plasma of the earth s ionosphere either directly , through x - ray and/or euv radiation from flares as it reaches earth , or indirectly , through the perturbation of the magnetospheric electric field upon the arrival of an interplanetary cme @xcite .",
    "s ionosphere is considered a dispersive medium for radio waves .",
    "its refractive index is a function of the radio - wave frequency , the electron density , and the intensity of the earth s magnetic field , * b*. its perturbation can be an important source of error for the signals of the _ navstar global positioning system _ ( gps ) satellites and other positioning systems like _ galileo _ ( european union ) , _ glonass _ ( russia ) , and _ compass _ ( china ) .",
    "the error in the signals is proportional to the integrated electron density along the signal path , tec , and inversely proportional to the square of the carrier phase frequency , @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "the signals from gps satellites must travel through the earth s ionosphere in their way to the gps receivers ( on the earth s surface ) in the l - band : @xmath3mhz and @xmath4mhz .",
    "although there is another l - band , @xmath5mhz , gps users can not use it @xcite .",
    "several works have shown the importance of the ionospheric interference on the ips @xcite .",
    "part of this contamination , or ionospheric scintillation ( ions ) , can represent a serious problem in ips studies .",
    "in fact , the presence of ions can lead to a misinterpretation of the ips ; however , there are techniques to remove the ionospheric scintillation part . @xcite",
    "have explored another possible data contamination by ionospheric effects .",
    "they have shown an example related to a solar event on 15 december 2006 , where the fluctuations observed in the signal of the radio sources exhibited strong contamination by ionospheric disturbances ( iond ) .",
    "the behavior shown by the radio signal was consistent with the fluctuations observed from the signal emitted by polar satellites .",
    "the authors suggested that not only the total electron content ( tec ) and the geomagnetic equatorial index , _ dst _ , could be used to characterize the origin of such fluctuations , but also the possibility of removing the contaminating frequencies from the data to study separately the ips or the iond .",
    "since we have observed fluctuations in the radio signal of sources transiting the mexart observatory , the purpose of our study is to understand the nature of these fluctuations , as well as answering the following questions : are the fluctuations intrinsic to quiet solar - wind conditions ? when are these fluctuations related to ionospheric disturbances ?",
    "how do these fluctuations quantitatively affect the ips ? to answer these questions ,",
    "we have analyzed the radio signal of sources observed with the mexart .",
    "we have explored all observations to find if the ionospheric contribution is always present , even in the absence of solar events . in section [ obs ] ,",
    "we present the information related to the mexart observations for the period between april and may 2010 .",
    "section [ dat_an ] shows the data analysis applied and the results using wavelet analysis applied to the mexart data . finally , in sections [ dis ] and [ con ] we present the discussion and conclusions of our work , respectively .",
    "we considered two short periods of mexart ( located at a latitude of @xmath6 @xmath7 @xmath8 , longitude of @xmath9 @xmath10 @xmath8 , and elevation of 1964 m above mean sea level ) observations , from 20 to 30 april and 8 to 31 may 2010 , with a configuration that used a small section of the mexart antenna .",
    "we used a 1024-dipole rectangular sub - array arranged in 16 rows . each row",
    "is horizontally polarized in the east - west direction .",
    "the total area of the antenna is 2415 square meters , 17.25 m ( north - south ) @xmath11 140 m ( east - west ) , which is one fourth of the total mexart array .",
    "the array feeds a 16x16 butler matrix , which generates 16 beams , each of width 1x8 degrees .",
    "the receiver works at 139.65 mhz with a 2 mhz bandwidth and a time constant of 40 ms .",
    "the acquisition rate is 20 ms .",
    "further technical details of the radio telescope can be found elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the daily mexart observations and the transit of strong radio sources can be viewed in real time .",
    "transit observations of the following sources were taken on several days : 3c48 ( r.a.@xmath12 , dec@xmath13 , right ascension and declination respectively ) , 3c144 ( r.a.@xmath14 @xmath15 @xmath16 , dec@xmath17 @xmath18 @xmath19 ) , 3c274 ( r.a.@xmath20 @xmath21 @xmath22 , dec@xmath23 @xmath24 @xmath25 ) , cas a ( r.a.@xmath26 @xmath24 @xmath27 , dec@xmath28 @xmath29 @xmath30 ) , cen a ( r.a.@xmath31 @xmath32 @xmath33 , dec@xmath34 @xmath35 @xmath36 ) , and 3c405 ( r.a.@xmath37 @xmath38 @xmath39 , dec@xmath40 @xmath41 @xmath42 ) .",

    "data analysis of mexart radio signals yielded two statistical parameters : the signal to noise ratio ( s / n ) and the average root mean square ( rms ) value calculated for the previous and the ensuing days for each radio source observational period .",
    "we analyzed the time series for each source transit - time ( around 8 minutes ) , looking for strong fluctuations in the radio signals .",
    "we used several routines developed to analyze mexart data in which we included one to read the raw data , another one to remove interference and gaps , and a third one that included gaussian fits to obtain a detrended time series .",
    "the time interval covered by the gps data was the same , 20 april to 31 may , 2010 . during this period ,",
    "the gps data showed the typical diurnal variation without any significant event .",

    "width=226 ]    the two minima , mentioned above , were probably associated with the coronal mass ejections ( cme ) that occurred in active regions 11063 and 11072 , or with the coronal holes located close to central meridian around four days before they were registered .",
    "these solar events certainly modified the plasma conditions in the interplanetary medium , and possibly along the line of sight between the radio sources and the mexart observatory .",
    "four slow and narrow cmes were observed on 29 april , which could be associated with the minimum on 2 may ; however , these cmes seemed to have no significant effect on the earth s magnetosphere .",
    "the cmes occurred at 01:12 ut , 03:36 ut , 07:00 ut , and 17:00 ut , and had velocities of 138 km s@xmath52 , 178 km s@xmath52 , 187 km s@xmath52 , and 378 km s@xmath52 , respectively .",
    "their position angles ( pas ) were around 80@xmath53 for the first three , and 260@xmath53 for the last one .",
    "all these cmes seemed to originate from active region 11063 ( n16 e11 ) , very close to central meridian .",
    "a coronal hole was observed in x - ray images obtained with satellite _ goes _ 14 by the on of 24 april .",
    "this coronal hole appeared as a small region at the pole to the north  east of the solar disk .",
    "the coronal hole displaced towards the north ",
    "west during several days and reached lower latitudes where it became bigger .",
    "the high speed streams ( @xmath54600 to 700 kms@xmath52 ) originating in the coronal hole were registered by the plasma instruments onboard _ wind _ and the _ advanced composition explorer _ ( ace ) from 30 april to 2 may 2010 . before the initiation of the geomagnetic storm , the solar - wind speed had an average value of @xmath54400 kms@xmath52 . however , on 2 may , this value increased to around 650kms@xmath52 .",
    "this fact coincides with the growth of the plasma temperature ( reaching @xmath55k ) .",
    "the magnetic field magnitude also showed an increase , which is consistent with an observed rotation of the southward component of the magnetic field , b@xmath56 and with the growth of the plasma pressure .",
    "finally , the plasma @xmath57 parameter exhibited small values ( close to zero ) in the same time interval , confirming the effect of the high speed stream from this coronal hole .",
    "regarding the second minimum in the dst index on 29 may , the active region 11072 ( s15 w11 ) displayed some activity during several days starting on 24 may .",
    "a halo cme , with a linear speed of 427kms@xmath52 occurred on 24 may at @xmath0 14:06 ut .",
    "x - ray images from _ goes _ 14 also showed a coronal hole by the end of 24 may ; it appeared as a small region at the pole to the north  east of the solar disk .",
    "this structure continuously moved to lower latitudes and became bigger .",
    "thus , the presence of the active region , the cmes occurrence , and the high speed stream from a coronal hole , which displayed the characteristics of a magnetic cloud ( with a nice @xmath58 rotation ) , may have led to the dip in _",
    "the _ vtec _ showed a slight response to these events , whereas the _ dst _",
    "index presented minima .",
    "the total electron content had a maximum no greater than 45_tecu _ between 3 to 6 may , and no greater than 35_tecu _ between 29 and 31 may .",
    "unfortunately , we do not have mexart data for the period of 1 to 7 may .",
    "depending on the availability of mexart observations , we estimated the scintillation index for each source as in @xcite .",
    "a wavelet transform can map the power of a particular frequency at different times , giving an expansion of the signal in both time and frequency .",
    "furthermore , the wavelet transform not only tells us which frequencies can exist in the signal , but also shows whether a particular scale varies in time .",
    "in addition , the wavelet tool has an important advantage over fourier transforms since it can extract frequency information from a signal using search windows of variable scales .    the wavelet analysis used in this work",
    "is based mainly on the wavelet software provided by c. torrence and g. compo , and programmed in the interactive data language ( idl ) .",
    "we also included several new routines adapted to this software for analyzing mexart data .",
    "these routines were developed to read the data and fitting gaussian functions to get a detrended time - series , which was used in our wavelet approach .    the wavelet analysis was applied to the radio signal of every source day by day to look for fluctuations that stand above the background signal along the time interval for the data analysis used in this work . with this tool we characterized the frequencies associated with these fluctuations in perturbed time subintervals ( where the _ dst _ geomagnetic index and tec were slightly perturbed ) and we compared them with undisturbed subintervals .",

    "this is in agreement with the observed power spectra , which show similar behaviors with no significant periodicities beyond a 95% significance level .",
    "furthermore , we observe that sometimes there are narrow peaks mounted on the source radio - signal that modify the variance substantially ( bottom panel ) .",
    "these peaks are associated with lightning storms close to the mexart observatory and/or with transiting - satellite signals .",

    "on the other hand , figure [ fig4 ] shows significant differences in the period 27 to 30 may in comparison with figure [ fig3 ] .",

    "this increase could be probably associated with the arrival to earth of a cme , as is reflected by the _",

    "figure [ fig5 ] shows a different period of observation for this source , from 24 to 28 april . during this period of time ,",
    "the radio signal presents fluctuations every day .",
    "however , the frequencies indicate different origins . in fact , for 24 and 26 arpil the _ vtec _ and the _ dst _ index display a behavior corresponding to a quiet period ( see figure [ fig2 ] ) , suggesting that these fluctuations are probably associated with perturbations in the interplanetary medium producing ips . for 27 and 28",
    "april , the fluctuations could be associated with ips plus iond .",
    "figure [ fig9 ] shows that the index presents an abrupt peak on 30 april .",
    "this increase , although due to ionospheric disturbances , as can be appreciated from the wavelet analysis , does not let us clearly understand what is the contribution of the ionosphere ( in relation with the _ dst _ variation ) because this requires data from more radio sources .",
    "3c405 _ shows a behavior similar to that of _ cas a _ , when on 28 may the radio signal presents slight fluctuations with periodicities greater than 50sec ( @xmath540.02hz ) and with a significant power at these frequencies .",
    "however , on 29 may , the fluctuations are stronger with periodicities greater than 10sec(@xmath540.1hz ) and also with a significant power at these frequencies ( see figure [ fig6 ] ) .",
    "because the _ vtec _ ( see figure [ fig10 ] ) is not highly altered locally on 29 may , it is suggested that the fluctuations observed are probably due to ionospheric perturbations around the auroral region . on 30",
    "may the radio signal of this source shows a behavior corresponding to a quiet period . finally , on 31 may , the radio signal of this source presents slight fluctuations : however , in this case , the _ vtec _ ( see figure [ fig10 ] ) is also slightly perturbed at the end of 30 may , suggesting that the observed fluctuations may be contaminated by ionospheric disturbances ( see figure [ fig6 ] ) .",
    "the bottom panel shows the _",
    "index.,width=226 ] 3 .   _",
    "3c144 _ shows a different behavior .",
    "no fluctuations were observed on 27 may ( see figure [ fig7 ] ) .",
    "however , the radio signal of this source is highly perturbed , the perturbations have periods of around 10sec(@xmath540.1hz ) .",
    "in addition , both the _ vtec _ and the _ dst _ ( see figure [ fig10 ] ) show a behavior typical of quiet periods , suggesting that the fluctuations observed on this day may be due to ips .",
    "there are several cme events between 25 and 28 may that may contribute to the ips . finally , on 29 and 30 may no significant fluctuations are observed ( see figure [ fig7 ] ) .",
    "3c48 , _ remains unperturbed on 26 and 30 may , but on 28 and 29 may there are slight fluctuations observed in the wavelet window .",
    "however , the power spectra show no periodicities above the 95% significance level ( see figure [ fig8 ] ) . in this case , the fluctuations observed could be associated with ips and ionospheric perturbations , respectively . however , we need a higher s / n to have a better definition of their origin .    in summary , we have observed several sources that present fluctuations in their radio signal ( see table [ table1 ] ) .",
    "these fluctuations may be associated with iond , suggested by the _ vtec _ in some days ; but , in other cases , they were associated with ips , and sometimes with both .",
    "the fact that sometimes the radio signal from astronomical sources is contamined by ionospheric disturbances , suggests that these fluctuations should be taken into account as possible sources of contamination in ips measurements obtained with the mexart observatory @xcite .    from our results",
    ", we have found that this complementary study can help to understand the origin of the observed fluctuations in the radio signal of astronomical sources . in addition",
    ", we have found that the ionospheric disturbances can play an important role in the contamination of the signal when looking for ips .",
    "the ionosphere acts as an obstacle to radio waves of @xmath66mhz @xcite and sometimes it is not possible to discriminate _ a priori _ between ips or ionospheric disturbances as sources of the observed intensity fluctuations recorded by mexart .    from a further analysis using the radio signal from satellites transiting close to an astronomical source and detected by mexart observatory , it was possible to discern whether the intensity fluctuations were associated with iond or ips @xcite . in this context , we have used an additional tool , a wavelet analysis , in this article .",
    "this alternative tool lets us characterize the perturbed signal .",
    "the conclusions of our work can be summarized as follows :    * our study incorporates the use of wavelets together with complementary information provided by the _ vtec _ and _ dst _ index .",
    "this is the first time these tools have been applied to mexart data and allow a better understanding of cases when the ips may be contaminated by iond .",
    "* within the period of april  may 2010 , several radio sources presented fluctuations in their radio signal registered with the mexart . using wavelets we found the periods / frequencies that characterize these fluctuations .",
    "we found that the perturbations in the signal were sometimes associated with iond and/or ips ( see for instance figure [ fig4 ] top left , figure [ fig5 ] top left and figure [ fig8 ] top right ) . in this context",
    "the _ vtec _ can help to establish the cases in which the ips is actually contaminated by iond .",
    "furthermore , in the example shown in figure [ fig8 ] ( top left ) , the wavelet analysis indicates that the ionospheric scintillation is associated with quiet conditions , and in figure [ fig5 ] ( top left ) and figure [ fig6 ] ( top right ) the wavelet analysis shows ionospheric disturbances associated with the geomagnetic storm . * in addition , fourier spectra show that these fluctuations have frequencies between @xmath540.01 hz to @xmath541.0 hz ( periods of 100sec to 1sec , respectively ) for both iond and ips .",
    "we found that there is a tendency for the frequencies close to @xmath541.0 hz to be more likely associated with ips , whereas lower frequencies tend to be related to iond .",
    "however , in the cases where both ips and iond occur , we could not distinguish between them .",
    "* in the examples that neither the dst index nor the _ vtec _ showed any significant change , we can say that the fluctuations are not related to global ionospheric effects but could be probably related to ips .",
    "we observed that when the _ vtec _ is perturbed and solar - origin effects can be assumed , then the radio signal can be contaminated by ionospheric perturbations .",
    "this is probably the case observed by @xcite , where the fluctuations could be attributed to iond and/or ips . *",
    "the solar - minimum period has allowed us to characterize better the radio fluctuations of astronomical sources observed with the mexart , during this period the ionosphere can contribute strongly .",
    "this is especially true for those sources that having large elongations ( around 90@xmath53 , for instance ) present fluctuations in their signal .",
    "however , more work is needed to characterize the intrinsic fluctuations in the radio signal .",
