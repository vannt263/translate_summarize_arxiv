    "our recombination model is consistent with fragmentation , since our shower partons are derived from the fragmentation functions .",

    "azimuthal anisotropy is a problem that we have treated previously @xcite and will not be addressed here .",
    "since we describe all the processes in analytical expressions , our presentation has the advantage of showing the details of relevant quantities explicitly instead of being hidden in codes .",
    "in particular , we have found compact formulas to describe the parton momentum distributions at the surface of the medium at mid - rapidity for any centrality , after the hard and semihard partons have undergone momentum degradation in traversing the medium .",
    "since minijets play important roles in our description of hadron production , semihard partons that escape the initial thermalization are crucial ingredients in our formalism .",
    "the inclusive distributions of minijets with and without energy loss can jointly lead to the construction of a quantity analogous to the nuclear modification factor , but here for minijets , thereby offering a direct view of the medium effect on partons .",
    "the minijets generate shower partons after emerging from the medium surface .",
    "those shower partons recombine with themselves or with thermal partons in various combinations to form hadrons .",

    "it is an important property of the recombination model that the thermal partons are universal irrespective of the hadrons they form at low @xmath3 , where shower partons do not have any significant effect on the @xmath3 distributions .",

    "the process of momentum degradation on a semihard parton traversing the medium for any centrality and at any angle @xmath9 has been described in ref .",
    "@xcite in a manageable way that can yield scaling results in agreement with the data on the nuclear modification factor for pion , @xmath27 , at various centralities @xcite .",
    "we now upgrade that description with the aim to give a better fit to more accurate data on pion and proton production separately and to find simpler parametric formulas that can directly be applied without going through the geometrical details each time .",

    "( [ 6 ] ) with @xmath29 specifying the dynamical path length ( to be discussed below ) @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the parton density in the phase space @xmath32 at the point of creation , and @xmath33 is the momentum degradation function from @xmath34 to @xmath26 @xcite @xmath35 we have used an exponential form for the degradation with the burden being put on @xmath29 to carry all the information on geometry and dynamics .",
    "the distribution @xmath31 of the initial momentum @xmath34 has been parametrized in ref .",
    "@xcite , so our concern is the distribution @xmath36 of the momentum @xmath26 at the medium surface .",
    "since the dynamical path length @xmath29 depends on the nuclear medium and the azimuthal angle , it is more useful for phenomenological purposes to express @xmath25 in terms of measurable quantities : angle @xmath9 and impact parameter @xmath37 that can be related to the centrality .",
    "thus we define @xmath38 which averages over all @xmath29 with the weighting function @xmath39 being the probability of having @xmath29 at @xmath9 and @xmath37 .",
    "this probability function has been studied in detail in ref .",
    "the main points of the geometrical and dynamical considerations are summarized in appendix a for easy reference here .    since @xmath39 is properly normalized , the mean dynamical path length is @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the geometrical path length weighted by nuclear density defined in eq .",
    "( [ a1 ] ) , and @xmath42 is the probability of production of a hard ( or semihard ) parton at the creation point @xmath43 discussed in appendix a. the parameter @xmath44 represents the dynamical effect of energy loss per unit length . in ref .",
    "@xcite a value for @xmath44 is found for a generic parton sufficient for the purpose of calculating the pion @xmath45 . in this paper",
    "we aim to determine both the meson and baryon spectra that depend on the quark and gluon s differently , so we shall distinguish @xmath46 and @xmath47 and use @xmath48 as a generic symbol that replaces @xmath44 in eq .",

    "that property offers a remarkable degree of simplicity in the complex geometrical problem of nuclear collisions .",
    "it means that two collisions at different impact parameters may have @xmath23-type partons produced at different angles @xmath9 that experience the same mean @xmath60 and thus can have the same survival rate .    both @xmath61 and @xmath56",

    "it means that the partons that emerge from the surface are more likely to have had a short path length @xmath59 , which is @xmath66 .",
    "hence , from both geometrical and dynamical considerations the semihard partons that get out of the medium to produce shower partons are predominantly created nearer to the surface than in the deep interior .    for applications to problems that involve calculating the @xmath3 spectra of any hadron produced , averaged over @xmath9",
    ", we note that the @xmath9 variable occurs only in eq .",

    "we now go into the details of eqs .",
    "( [ 14 ] ) and ( [ 15 ] ) and attempt to find some simple algebraic representation that can help to circumvent the laborious task of dealing with all the intermediate complications involving @xmath53 and @xmath56 each time we need @xmath72 .",

    "we shall use only the parameters for au - au collisions at @xmath80 gev . combining the above equations we can calculate @xmath72 for any parton of type @xmath23 with momentum @xmath26 at the medium surface .    in applying @xmath72 to the calculation of shower partons in the next section",
    ", we shall find that gluons contribute more to pions than quarks , while quarks are more important for the formation of protons than gluons because of the valence structure . in being careful in deriving the quark and gluon s @xmath81 ,",
    "we further take note of the difference in the rates of energy loss by quarks and gluons , the former being only about half the latter @xcite .",
    "we implement that difference by requiring @xmath82 and the average being around 0.11 as given in eq .",

    "comparisons of those two curves of open symbols with the solid ( black ) line for gluons in ( a ) and dashed ( blue ) line for quarks in ( b ) show the nature of momentum degradation for @xmath106 .",
    "there is more suppression for gluons than for quarks throughout the @xmath26 region shown .",

    "@xmath110 is analogous to the nuclear modification factor @xmath112 , except that it is for @xmath23-type minijet and is not directly verifiable by experiment .    in fig .",
    "2(a ) and ( b ) we do not go below @xmath113 gev / c because minijets are ill - defined at lower @xmath26 and @xmath31 is given for @xmath114 gev / c in @xcite .",
    "the suppression of @xmath110 is due to a combination of three factors : @xmath59 being non - zero , the necessity for the initial momenta @xmath34 to be larger than the exit momenta @xmath26 , and the rapid damping of @xmath31 as @xmath34 increases .",
    "the increase of @xmath110 with decreasing @xmath26 is more rapid at low @xmath26 .",
    "that is because semihard initial partons with @xmath115 gev / c can be converted to the lower @xmath26 exit partons by degradation , but hard partons with higher @xmath34 are rarer and thus ineffective in raising the intermediate @xmath26 partons .",
    "what happens to the energy that is lost is a different issue , and is not a part of @xmath116 . for non - central collisions",
    "@xmath110 is higher , as one should expect , since there is less suppression when there is less nuclear medium .",
    "the @xmath67 dependencies are shown explicitly in fig .",
    "2(c ) and ( d ) for three typical values of @xmath26 . comparing fig .",
    "2(a ) and ( b ) we see that @xmath117 is roughly half of @xmath118 , but their @xmath26 dependencies are similar in shape .",
    "the enhanced degradation of gluon momentum is compensated by the higher initial gluon  @xmath119 compared to that for quarks @xmath120 .",
    "thus the resultant @xmath121 is roughly of the same magnitude as @xmath122 at all @xmath26 , as can be seen in fig .  1 , by comparing the black solid line in ( a ) to the blue dashed line in ( b ) . that has a consequence in the production of hadrons at intermediate and high , as we shall see in the following sections .",
    "it is important to emphasize that @xmath110 is not how much momentum fraction that a given parton retains after traversing the medium , but the probability of having a minijet with momentum @xmath26 relative to no energy loss ( @xmath123 ) after integrating over all contributing sources , all creation points , all azimuthal angles , and especially all initial parton momenta .",
    "thus in the hypothetical and unrealistic case of more abundant partons at large @xmath34 , @xmath110 would be greater than 1 even if @xmath124 because higher @xmath34 hard partons can feed the lower @xmath26 minijets after degradation . in reality",
    "it is the steepness of the falling of @xmath31 at high @xmath34 that results in the low value of @xmath110 even if the degree of degradation is not severe .",
    "figures 1 and 2 are the results of this study that present new understanding of the properties of minijets produced at intermediate @xmath26 before hadronization with all geometrical and nuclear complications at all centralities taken into account .",
    "there are , of course , approximations made in the calculation , most notably in treating energy loss per unit length weighted by nuclear density , i.  e.  @xmath125 for quarks and @xmath84 for gluons , which are based on phenomenology done previously .",
    "the ultimate test of how good those approximations are is to be found in comparing their consequences to the experimental data that we shall examine in the next two sections .",

    "we take @xmath7 to be the value @xmath193 gev / c determined in ref .",
    "@xcite without alteration .",
    "it is a phenomenological inverse slope that describes the pion and proton spectra at @xmath194 gev / c and should not be identified with any temperature in hydrodynamics .",
    "the only unknown that remains is the @xmath67 dependence of normalization of the thermal parton , @xmath195 .",
    "we write it in terms of the number of participants as in eq .",
    "( [ 25 ] ) with two undetermined parameters @xmath138 and @xmath139 .",
    "it should be noted that the formalism for hadronization described in sec .",
    "iv is applied at the final stage of the evolution of the system when the density is low enough for confinement to take place . since hadrons are formed by the recombination of quarks ( and antiquarks ) ,",
    "all gluons have been converted to quark pairs so that no partons are left at the end , although we look at only the single - particle inclusive distributions . that conversion has been implicitly accounted for in the determination of @xmath147 @xcite and explicitly in @xcite , and has been termed saturation of the sea .",
    "the thermal partons have quarks and antiquarks that are fully equilibrated in the light and strange sectors , since @xmath196 gev is significantly higher than the @xmath99 quark mass .",
    "thus @xmath197 in eq .  ( [ 25 ] ) applies to both sectors .",
    "we are now ready to compute the inclusive distributions of @xmath191 and @xmath141 by varying the two parameters @xmath138 and @xmath139 to fit all the data points .",
    "we emphasize that we have no parameters to adjust for the intermediate and high-@xmath3 regions , since all details on minijets have been specified in sec .",
    "iii . in varying @xmath197",
    "we only adjust the normalization of the thermal distributions . in fig .  3",
    "is shown the pion spectra , fig",
    ".  4 kaon spectra and fig .",
    "5 proton spectra for various centralities indicated .",
    "the data are from phenix and star collaborations @xcite .",
    "the thermal and shower components in various combinations are shown by the different line types .",
    "the dashed lines show the tt and ttt components ; their magnitudes are what we have adjusted to fit .",
    "they correspond to the values @xmath198 in eq .",
    "( [ 25 ] ) .",
    "what we find is that while the kaon and proton distributions at low  can fit the data well , the pion distribution is a little lower than the data for @xmath199 gev / c .",
    "there is a good reason for that , namely : contributions to the pion spectra from the decays of resonances are not included in our calculation of the tt component . without a definitive scheme to account for resonance decay , we insert a term for very low  so that the modified tt component differs from eq .",
    "( [ 24 ] ) as @xmath200{c^2\\over 6 } e^{-p_t / t }      \\label{46}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath201 is attributed entirely to the effect of resonances @xmath202 with parameters chosen to fit the pion data at @xmath199 gev / c , approximately the same as in ref .",
    "the solid lines in fig .",
    "3 are the results that include this term in eq .",
    "( [ 46 ] ) .",
    "we do not regard the presence of this term as a serious weakness of our model ; on the contrary , to find an agreement with the data in the absence of it would indicate a problem since resonance production is a reality .    in an overall view of figs .  3 - 5 it is remarkable",
    "how well the solid theoretical curves fit the data in all 16 cases by varying just two parameters in the centrality dependence of the thermal distribution . in each case",
    "the ts , tts and tss components play crucial roles in uplifting the spectra in the intermediate region between low @xmath3 where tt and ttt dominate and high @xmath3 where ss and sss dominate .",
    "that aspect of the @xmath3 behavior has become the hallmark of the success of the recombination model , now extended to all centralities .",
    "it should be noted that the use of @xmath83 and @xmath84 is not a free choice of the parameters for parton degradation .",
    "we have originally used @xmath203 as an approximation for a generic parton determined previously in @xcite , but were unable to obtain satisfactory result on both pion and proton spectra , slightly high on pion and low on proton at intermediate and large .",
    "we then used @xmath204 with average near 0.11 , not arbitrarily , but in recognition of the greater energy loss of gluon compared to quarks by a factor of about 2 , as mentioned in sec .",
    "iii . as a consequence ,",
    "more quark - type minijets survive the medium effect than the gluons , compared to the case of @xmath203 , and was sufficient in our treatment of hadronization by recombination to enhance the production of protons and suppress that of pions just enough to render a good fit of the respective spectra .",
    "it is at this point that we can refer back to the statement made at the end of sec .",
    "iii and confirm that our treatment of momentum degradation has found support in being able to reproduce the experimental data throughout the whole @xmath3 spectra of produced hadrons .",
    "thus the minijet distribution @xmath188 given in eq .",
    "( [ 18 ] ) and ( [ 19 ] ) , and shown in figs .  1 and 2 , represents reliable information in compact form that can readily be applied in other calculations .     for different centralities .",
    "the data are all from phenix @xcite , except for the open squares which are from the older data @xcite . ]    from the spectra obtained we can readily calculate the @xmath205 ratio . in fig .",
    "6 we show that ratio for two centralities : 0 - 10% and 20 - 40% .",
    "the data from phenix @xcite on @xmath206 show peaking at @xmath207 gev / c .",
    "our calculated curve in solid ( black ) line for 0 - 10% agree with the data very well . the dashed ( blue ) line for 20 - 40% peaks at  closer to 3 gev / c , and exceeds the maximum of the data by about 10% .",
    "nevertheless , the overall shape of the ratio is fairly well reproduced .",
    "the main message that this study conveys is that the @xmath3 and centrality dependencies of @xmath208 and @xmath141 spectra are well reproduced by the recombination model .",
    "furthermore , our analysis reveals the properties of the partons before hadronization . generally speaking",
    ", there is some degree of universality in the thermal and shower components that are insensitive to the hadron types , _ viz . _",
    "mesons or baryons , that they form . on the other hand , there are differences in details that come to light only in the hadronization procedure examined .",
    "the thermal partons have exponential behavior characterized by an inverse slope @xmath7 that is the same for both light and strange quarks .",
    "its value at 0.283 gev is higher than the freeze - out temperature of fluid considered by hydrodynamical studies at the final stage of the medium evolution .",
    "thus our @xmath7 is not the hydro temperature , but may be related to an effective temperature that includes the transverse flow energy of the hadrons in some hydro models @xcite .",
    "it is demonstrated in our calculation that a universal @xmath7 is sufficient to give rise to different low-@xmath3 behaviors of different hadrons because of differences in the recombination functions .",
    "furthermore , the centrality dependence of the magnitudes of thermal partons is nearly universal .",
    "we caution against being misled by the use of the work  thermal \" . without having investigated the problem of equilibration",
    ", we can not be certain of the time when thermalization is established .",
    "our approach allows for minijets to escape from the medium before equilibration , and the energy loss to the medium can enhance the thermal partons in the vicinity of the trajectories of the semihard partons , resulting in a phenomenological structure referred to as ridge @xcite . in our present study such detailed properties of the medium",
    "are imbedded in our thermal partons , but can not be extracted without further study of the azimuthal anisotropy .",
    "the fact that our results agree well with the data at all centralities and @xmath3 attests to the reliability of our description of the minijets and their shower partons . despite the complexities of the geometry and nuclear medium of non - central collisions that the semihard partons must traverse to emerge at any angle , the possibility that their distribution at the medium surface can be described by a formula as simple as eq .",
    "( [ 18 ] ) is remarkable .",
    "apart from the given dependence on the parton type , that formula is also universal and is crucial in determining the strengths of the shower partons that in turn are responsible for the good fits via ts , tts , etc .  components . of importance to bear in mind is the inclusion of all initiating partons that contribute to @xmath188 , created at any point with any momentum . in that sense",
    "it is an inclusive distribution of minijets .",
    "the ratio @xmath110 is analogous to the nuclear modification factor on the minijets , but is not due entirely to the momentum degradation of the hard and semihard partons .",
    "the suppression factor is also a consequence of the rapid damping of the initial distribution before momentum degradation takes effect .",
    "a significant advance made in this study is the differentiation of the dynamical path lengths @xmath85 for quarks and gluons .",
    "we have found in the course of our investigation that the use of an average @xmath209 for all partons , as done previously , led us to a point where we could not reproduce the pion and proton data at high  simultaneously .",
    "we were forced to recognize that the rate of energy loss for quarks and gluons are different ; thus by treating @xmath204 we obtained semihard and hard parton s that enabled us to fit both the pion and proton data very well . that success is not independent of the recombination formalism , since the hadrons formed in that procedure are sensitive to the parton s",
    " pions depend more on gluons and proton more on quarks . considering the various roles that partons and hadrons play in our hadronization scheme , we come to the conclusion that the success in fitting the data with such accuracy would not have been possible if the partons had been treated as some generic hadron constituents .",
    "the implication is that some simple rule to convert medium to hadrons , such as parton - hadron duality , would not be a reliable way to describe hadronization when examined closely .",
    "extension of this study to hyperons should be straightforward , provided that a reliable description of the relevant recombination functions can be found .",
    "omega production should be of particular interest because of what has been termed the  omega puzzle \" @xcite .",
    "it refers to the seemingly contradictory observation that the @xmath210 spectrum is approximately exponential up to @xmath211 gev / c @xcite on the one hand , while @xmath210-triggered events have associated particles @xcite on the other .",
    "suppression of the strange minijets should lead to the exponential thermal behavior , but thermal partons should have no correlated partners unless they are from the ridge stimulated by non - strange minijets .    at lhc",
    "we expect both @xmath7 and @xmath188 to change , but the basic mechanism for hadronization described in sec .",
    "iv does not .",
    "collisions at higher energy produce more partons , both thermal and shower , with increasing predominance of minijets since @xmath188 receives contributions from all higher initial - parton momenta @xmath212 .",
    "based these reasonable expectations , one may regard our description as being sufficiently reliable such that it may be used as a means to discover unexpected phenomenon , if the formalism encounters notable failure to explain some aspect of the lhc data .",
    "we thank r.  belmont for bringing us to the attention of ref .",
    "@xcite and providing us with numerical values of certain data points .",
    "this work was supported , in part , by the nsfc of china under grant no .",
    "11205106 and by the u.  s.  department of energy under grant no . de - fg02 - 96er40972 .",
    "we summarize here the essence of the treatment of momentum degradation of semihard partons traversing ellipsoidal medium at any angle , as originally discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , but with some modifications that improve the description .",
    "the geometrical details of determining the initial point of creation at @xmath43 and the exit point @xmath213 are not repeated here .",
    "what is important to note is that our definition of the path length between those two points includes weighting by the density of the medium of the static system , i.  e. , @xmath214 where @xmath215 is not time , but a marker of the trajectory from @xmath43 to @xmath213 , and @xmath216 is the local density along the trajectory calculable from the nuclear thickness function .",
    "the real system is not static , but the effects of expansion are mostly canceled in eq .",
    "( [ a1 ] ) because @xmath216 decreases , while @xmath217 increases , during expansion .",
    "thus @xmath50 may be regarded as being insensitive to hydrodynamical expansion , while being an effective measure of the distance in the nuclear medium that a semihard parton experiences in losing energy along its path .",
    "the probability of producing a hard ( or semihard ) parton at @xmath43 is proportional to @xmath218 , where @xmath43 are the cartesian coordinates of @xmath219 and @xmath220 are the thickness functions of nuclei @xmath221 and @xmath222 .",
    "we normalize it and call it @xmath51 so that its integral over all @xmath43 is unity .",
    "now , we insert a @xmath128-function in the integrand and define @xmath223 this is the probability for the emerging parton to have had a dynamical path length @xmath29 in the medium originated from any point inside and exiting at an angle @xmath9 .",
    "the parameter @xmath44 contains all the uncalculable effect of energy loss during the passage through the medium so that @xmath29 becomes a measure of degradation that accounts for both the geometrical length @xmath224 and the degree of degradation per unit length .",
    "it is found in ref .",
    "@xcite that a value of @xmath225 can satisfactorily reproduce the data on @xmath63 for @xmath3 in the range 4 to 8 gev / c .",
    "we now improve upon the above description by recognizing that quark and gluon lose energy at different rates as they propagate through the medium . while eq .",
    "( [ a3 ] ) has been sufficient as an average parameter to characterize momentum degradation of partons that lead to the calculation of pion production @xcite , our interest in this article to study both meson and baryon production leads us to the necessity of distinguishing the @xmath44 parameters for quark and gluons , whose hadronization by recombination depends on their momenta differently . to that end",
    "we use @xmath46 and @xmath47 for quarks and gluons , respectively , and expect them to straddle the average value @xmath203 on its two sides .",
    "it is generally understood that gluons lose about twice as much energy as quarks @xcite , so we expect @xmath83 and @xmath84 whose average is @xmath226 with a tilt toward gluon .",
    "the functions @xmath61 and @xmath56 have been studied in ref .",
    "@xcite with @xmath203 . in this appendix",
    "we proceed with the same notation with the understanding that it is only a multiplicative change from @xmath44 to @xmath48 and @xmath209 to @xmath85 . here",
    "we give simple analytic forms for them .",
    "since experimental data are usually presented in terms of centrality , instead of impact parameter , we replace @xmath37 by @xmath67 that denotes the average percentile centrality , where , for example , @xmath68 implies 0 - 10% .",

    "an analytic approximation of that @xmath9 dependence can be obtained by fitting the curves in the figure with the conditions that @xmath228 and that @xmath229 is independent of @xmath9 .",
