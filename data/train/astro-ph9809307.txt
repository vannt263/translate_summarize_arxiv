    "mcwilliam et al .",

    "they argued that this mechanism works for several species such as @xmath8-elements but has difficulties with the above trends .",
    "mcwilliam et al .",
    "( 1995b ) also pointed out that the galactic halo formation model proposed by searle & zinn ( 1978 ) is at odds with the time - delay mechanism .",
    "instead , they suggested that the metallicity - dependent supernova progenitor mass function could explain these trends , while still being consistent with searle & zinn ( 1978 ) .",
    "audouze & silk ( 1995 ) interpreted the observations as evidence that the galaxy was poorly mixed and proposed that at most two or three supernovae could have contaminated any particular cloud . in favor of this hypothesis ,",
    "ryan et al .",
    "( 1996 ) proposed that a variation of the supernova explosion energy , which is connected with both the yields and the amount of ejecta dilution , could cause these trends .",
    "mcwilliam ( 1997 ) and searle & mcwilliam ( 1998 ) suggested that diluting a primordial composition with solar composition supernova ejecta could explain the trends . in principle , hypothetical pre - galactic population iii objects , such as very massive stars or pair creation supernovae ( e.g. , bond et al . 1984 ) , could be the cause of the observed behavior .",
    "however , none of these objects has been investigated in full detail in quantitative nucleosynthesis yield studies nor ever been incorporated in chemical evolution calculations .",
    "timmes et al .",

    "it should be pointed out that self - consistent explosion and nucleosynthesis calculations , which start from core collapse , have not yet successfully determined the mass cut between the central neutron star ( or black hole ) and the ejected envelope .",
    "therefore , the mass cut of sne ii as a function of the progenitor mass is still an open question and can be treated as a free parameter .",

    "their results suggest that although the yields of iron peak elements depend on the progenitor metallicity , their variation in the range @xmath10 is only about 20% or less .",
    "since we are interested only in @xmath11 in this range , we neglect metallicity effects on progenitors and explore the dependence on other parameters , such as the stellar mass , mass cut , explosion energy , and neutron excess ( @xmath12 , where @xmath13 denotes the electron mole number ) . with this procedure",
    ", we can investigate the trends of the yields , i.e. , how much the yields increase or decrease with these parameters .    in  [ sec :",

    "stars initially more massive than 8@xmath14 explode as sne ii at the end of their life , leaving neutron stars or black holes .",
    "when they explode , nucleosynthesis proceeds explosively because of high temperatures and densities in the deep stellar interior . in order to investigate the explosive nucleosynthesis of sne ii ,",
    "we solve nuclear reaction networks , together with hydrodynamical equations , and calculate the energy generation by explosive burning .",
    "our calculations are performed in two steps .",
    "the first step is a hydrodynamical simulation of the sn ii explosions with a small nuclear reaction network which contains only 13 alpha nuclei ( @xmath15he , @xmath16c , @xmath17o , @xmath18ne , @xmath19 mg , @xmath20si , @xmath21s , @xmath22ar , @xmath23ca , @xmath24ti , @xmath25cr , @xmath26fe , and @xmath2ni ) .",

    "we also treat mass cuts and explosion energies independently , though these are physically related , because of uncertainties in the explosion mechanism .",

    "figure [ fig : sn6m10c13y8.elemp ] shows the isotopic composition of the ejecta of the explosion of the 20@xmath14 star as a typical sn ii . here three distinctive regions are seen .",
    "one is the innermost high temperature region .",
    "the outer boundary of this region is determined by the condition that maximum temperatures of @xmath34k is attained behind the shock . in this region , nuclear statistical equilibrium ( nse )",
    "is achieved except for the slow triple - alpha process ( @xmath8-rich freezeout ) .",
    "thus , the nucleosynthesis depends only on @xmath13 and the entropy , being dominated by iron group elements ( woosley , arnett , & clayton 1973 ; thielemann , hashimoto , & nomoto 1990 ) .",
    "the most abundant element in this region of complete si - burning with alpha - rich freeze - out is @xmath2ni , provided @xmath35 .",
    "the second region , which does not experience such high temperatures , undergoes incomplete si - burning with only partial si exhaustion ; here the most abundant nucleus changes from @xmath2ni to @xmath20si . in the third region",
    "the temperatures are too low to produce any iron group elements , and only explosive o , ne , or c - burning take place .",
    "farther out in radius , regions are encountered where explosive nucleosynthesis barely affects the pre - explosive composition and matter as produced during the quasi - static evolution is ejected essentially unchanged .    in order to investigate the ratios [ cr / fe ] , [ mn / fe ] and [ co / fe ] we look into the regions where these elements are produced . first of all",

    "@xmath26fe and @xmath36co , which decay into @xmath26cr and @xmath36mn , respectively , are mostly synthesized in the incomplete si - burning region .",
    "@xmath26fe is also synthesized in the complete si - burning region , but not a large amount .",
    "( note that the ordinate of figure [ fig : sn6m10c13y8.elemp ] is log - scaled . ) on the contrary , @xmath37cu , which decays into @xmath37co , is produced in the complete si - burning region .",
    "note that @xmath36mn and @xmath37co are the only stable isotopes of these elements and therefore , their abundances are identical with the mn and co element abundances .",
    "@xmath26cr dominates the cr element abundance by 84% ( in solar composition ) .",
    "thus , it is sufficient to take these isotopes into consideration when discussing the abundances of [ cr , mn , co / fe ] .",
    "the above discussion suggests that the choice of the mass cut can affect the ratios [ cr / fe ] , [ mn / fe ] , and [ co / fe ] .",
    "for a deeper mass cut ( i.e. smaller @xmath38 ) , the ejected mass of the complete si - burning region is larger ( i.e. , the masses of fe and co are larger ) , while the ejected mass of the incomplete si - burning region remains the same ( i.e. , the masses of cr , mn , and fe are the same ) , accordingly the ratios of [ cr / fe ] and [ mn / fe ] are smaller and [ co / fe ] is larger . for a mass cut at larger radii ( larger @xmath38 )",
    "these ratios show the opposite tendency . therefore",
    ", specific choices of mass cuts in sne ii might explain the behavior of [ cr / fe ] , [ mn / fe ] , and [ co / fe ] in the metallicity range @xmath39 [ fe / h ] @xmath40 .",

    "here we use the solar abundances by anders and grevesse ( 1989 ) . for smaller @xmath38 ,",
    "[ cr / fe ] and [ mn / fe ] are smaller , while [ co / fe ] and [ ni / fe ] are larger .",

    "one finds substantial @xmath41ni production only in the inner complete si - burning region , so that the behavior of [ ni / fe ] is similar to [ co / fe ] . the observational trends in cr , mn , co and ni are reproduced simultaneously .",

    "thus , all the metal to iron ratios are larger for smaller @xmath27 .",
    "the explosion energy of a typical sn ii is considered to be @xmath43 ergs .",
    "for example , the explosion energy of sn 1987a has been estimated to be @xmath44 ergs from modeling of the early light curve ( shigeyama et al .",

    "@xmath47 , while e = @xmath48ergs ( left ) and @xmath49ergs ( right ) .",
    "it is seen that the larger explosion energy forms a larger region of complete silicon burning , while the incomplete silicon burning region is enlarged only slightly . in other words , for larger @xmath50 , the region of incomplete silicon burning is shifted outward in mass without an appreciable change of the enclosed mass . therefore , the sn ii with a larger explosion energy produces a larger amount of iron group elements if mass cuts are the same .",
    "that is , a larger explosion energy affects abundance ratios in the same way as a smaller mass cut .",
    "the explosion energy of sne ii can vary by a factor of five ( burrows 1998 ) .",
    "we find that changing explosion energies from @xmath48 to @xmath49 ergs causes some changes in the abundance ratios , but can not explain the large variations in the observations .",
    "figure [ fig : pmdependence ] shows the progenitor mass dependence of sn ii nucleosynthesis .",
    "the progenitors are the 6@xmath14 he core of the 20@xmath14 star ( left ) and",
    "the 8@xmath14 he core of the 25@xmath14 star ( right ) .",
    "both models have the same kinetic energy of the ejecta ( @xmath51 ergs ) , but the deposited energies are different because of the difference in the gravitational potential energies between the two models .",
    "@xmath28 is set to be 0.4985 .",
    "note that a more massive supernova has more massive complete and incomplete si burning regions .",
    "as one can see in figure [ fig : pmdependence ] , the mass ratio between the complete and incomplete si - burning layers depends on the progenitor mass and the mass cut .",
    "more massive stars evolve faster .",
    "thus , we expect the ejecta of the most massive stars to dominate the earliest phase of galactic evolution , i.e. the period corresponding to the lowest [ fe / h ] .",
    "if the mass cut @xmath38 between the ejecta and the neutron star tends to be smaller for the larger mass progenitor which provides earlier chemical input into the galactic evolution , one could expect to reproduce the observed trend in [ cr / fe ] , [ mn / fe ] and [ co / fe ] . whether this trend agrees quantitatively with the observations has to be tested .",
    "the above trend between the progenitor mass and the mass cut can not be monotonic because of two effects which compete with each other .",
    "one is the amount of neutrino absorbing matter , and the other is the depth of the gravitational potential . for intermediate massive stars , heavier stars eject relatively larger amounts of @xmath2ni because of larger neutrino absorbing regions , while in more massive stars , such as sn1997d , the deeper gravitational potential wins and @xmath2ni is scarcely ejected due to the fall back ( burrows 1998 ) .",
    "note that recent observations , relating the total @xmath2ni mass to progenitor mass , seem to support this idea ( see figure [ fig : mvsni ] ) .",
    "we expect that the trend of increasing @xmath2ni yield with increasing progenitor mass holds over a large range of progenitor masses , while the reverse trend occurs more abruptly",
    ". therefore , we focus here on the increasing trend ( decreasing mass cut with increasing progenitor mass ) up to a maximum progenitor mass , above which we assume that sne ii do not contribute to galactic chemical evolution .",
    "figure [ fig : ratio4 ] shows the abundance ratios of various sn ii models given in table [ tab : ratio4 ] , where their parameters ( mass cut , etc ) are summarized .",
    "the abscissa of figure [ fig : ratio4 ] indicates only a model sequence ( a - i ) . for these models ,",
    "we take into account the observational trend between the ejected @xmath2ni mass and stellar mass by assuming that the @xmath2ni yield of the 25@xmath14 star is larger than that of less massive stars ( see figure [ fig : mvsni ] ) .",
    "correspondingly , figure [ fig : ratio4 ] shows that deeper mass cuts yield smaller [ cr / fe ] and [ mn / fe ] , while they lead to larger [ co / fe ] .",
    "this means that if supernovae at smaller [ fe / h ] have deeper mass cuts , the observed trends can be explained .",
    "we consider two models to relate [ fe / h ] and the progenitor masses .",
    "one is the ` well - mixed ' model , and the other is the unmixed model . in the well - mixed model , we assume that the mixing in the galactic scale is so efficient that the chemical uniformity is achieved in the early galaxy . in the unmixed model , on the contrary , we assume that the mixing is not effective and the composition of a metal - poor star is the same as produced by a single sn ii",
    ".    for these models , [ fe / h ] is related to the stellar masses as follows . for the well - mixed model , [ fe / h ] at galactic time @xmath52 , as well as other abundances ( e.g. cu , mn , and co ) , can be obtained by integrating the yields from all sne exploded for @xmath53 .",
    "[ fe / h ] decreases monotonically towards the past and the age at the lower [ fe / h ] corresponds to the shorter lifetime of more massive stars . in this way",
    ", we construct the galactic halo model where the ages at [ fe / h ] @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 roughly coincide with the time when stars of 25@xmath14 , 20@xmath14 and 13@xmath14 exploded , respectively .",
    "note that the mass vs. [ fe / h ] relation is based on several assumptions ( star formation rate , initial mass function , etc . ) , thus being subject to some uncertainties .",
    "the solid curves in figure [ fig : appli1 ] show the changes in the iron - peak abundance ratios as a function of [ fe / h ] . to calculate these ratios , a set of models [ * b * , *",
    "g * , * h * ] is used in figure [ fig : ratio4 ] , and the salpeter imf of @xmath57 is adopted .",
    "the observed trends of [ cr / fe ] and [ mn / fe ] are relatively well reproduced in figure [ fig : appli1 ] .    in the unmixed model ,",
    "the next generation stars were born in the ejecta of a sn ii which is uncontaminated by previous supernovae .",
    "then these stars have the same heavy element abundances as a single sn ii . in this case ,",
    "[ fe / h ] depends on how much interstellar material is mixed with the ejecta before forming the next generation stars .",
    "thus it is not trivial to see why there is a relation between [ fe / h ] and the progenitor mass @xmath58 . in  [ subsec : cbysnii ] we will discuss that the relation can be determined by @xmath58-dependence of the explosion energy and the strmgren radius . for now , we assign @xmath58 = 25 , 20 , and 13 @xmath14 to [ fe / h ] = @xmath59 and @xmath60 , respectively , though the exact correspondence depends on the @xmath58-dependent explosion energy and the strmgren radius .",
    "the filled circles in figure [ fig : appli1 ] show the unmixed case for the model set [ * b * , * g * , * h * ] .",
    "the trends in [ cr / fe ] and [ mn / fe ] are well reproduced with larger contrasts than in the well - mixed model .    for other set of models ,",
    "the contrast in the abundance ratios can be larger than the above case .",
    "the solid lines and the filled circles in figure [ fig : appli2 ] use the set [ * a * , * g * , * i * ] , and the contrasts in [ cr / fe ] and [ mn / fe ] are larger than the set [ * b * , * g * , * h * ] for both the well - mixed and unmixed cases .",
    "though it is hard to argue which model , between well - mixed and unmixed , is in better agreement with the observations , the slope of the abundance ratios for the well - mixed model seems to be slightly too gentle , while the unmixed model can produce a steeper slope .",
    "especially , the unmixed model better reproduces the inclination of the [ co / fe ] vs. [ fe / h ] curve .    in figures [ fig : appli1 ] and [ fig : appli2 ] , the calculated [ co / fe ] ratios are smaller than the observed ratios by a factor of 3 - 5 . in order to compare the slope of the curve with observations more easily ,",
    "the dashed lines in figures [ fig : appli1 ] and [ fig : appli2 ] show the models in which the amount of co is five times larger than in the models [ * b * , * g * , * h * ] and [ * a * , * g * , * i * ] . the filled triangles in figures [ fig : appli1 ] and [ fig : appli2 ] indicate the five times enhanced co for the unmixed model . as discussed in ",

    "although [ co / fe ] is larger , stable ni ( @xmath41ni , @xmath61ni , and @xmath62ni ) is overproduced and [ ni / fe ] is too large to be acceptable .",
    "therefore , the deficiency of @xmath37co ( i.e. , the deficiency of @xmath37cu ) is still an open question .",
    "in  [ sec : abundhalo ] , we have shown that the trends of [ cr / fe ] and [ mn / fe ] can be well explained with both the well - mixed model and the unmixed model",
    ". however , the well - mixed model tends to predict too small a metallicity dependence in the abundances ratios .",
    "indeed , audouze & silk ( 1995 ) and ryan et al .",
    "( 1996 ) argue that only one , or at most two to three , supernovae could have contaminated a particular cloud in the [ fe / h ] @xmath63 region . for the ` unmixed ' model , the observed variations of [ cr / fe ] , [ mn / fe ] , and",
    "[ co / fe ] can be explained with the systematic variations of these ratios as a function of the progenitor mass @xmath58 (  [ sec : abundhalo ] ) .",
    "the question is then why there should be a tight correlation between [ fe / h ] and @xmath58 .",
    "the [ fe / h ] of a star is determined by the amount of iron ejected from the relevant supernova and the mass of hydrogen in the mixing region .",
    "our calculations show that in order to explain the large variations of the observed abundance ratios ( e.g. @xmath64 dex in [ cr / fe ] ) , the iron mass from sn ii varies within a relatively narrow range of 0.05@xmath14 to 0.25@xmath14 .",
    "thus in the very low metallicity regions , there must be an order of magnitude variation in the hydrogen mass to produce the variation of [ fe / h ] in the range of @xmath65 to @xmath60 .",
    "ryan et al .",
    "( 1996 ) obtained an analytic expression for the mass of the ism ( interstellar matter ) , @xmath66 , mixed with the ejecta using equations ( 4.4b ) and ( 3.33a ) in cioffi et al .",
    "ryan et al .",
    "( 1996 ) suggested that @xmath66 depends only weakly on the environmental details , but strongly on the explosion energy @xmath50 of the supernova as @xmath67 . in this connection , we should note the recent discovery of a supernova with such a large explosion energy as @xmath68 erg from a massive progenitor ( sn1998bw ; iwamoto et al .",
    "if more massive supernovae tend to produce larger explosion energy and this @xmath58-dependence is large enough , the larger @xmath58 - smaller [ fe / h ] relation can be obtained .",
    "here we propose another possibility .",
    "the above discussion is derived under the assumption that the ism is uniform .",
    "however , there is a distinctive non - uniformity characterized by the `` strmgren sphere '' , within which matter is ionized .",
    "the progenitors of sne ii are so hot and luminous during their main - sequence phase that their strmgren spheres are as large as @xmath69pc .",
    "the strmgren sphere is likely to determine the amount of hydrogen into which the ejecta of a supernova are mixed .",
    "the shock advances easily within the strmgren sphere , but is strongly decelerated outside the sphere because it has to ionize the matter there ; this means the effective adiabatic index @xmath70 approaches @xmath71 outside the sphere .",
    "the radius of the strmgren sphere is sensitive to the effective temperature of the star .",
    "the change in the effective temperature by 25% leads to a doubling of the strmgren radius ( osterbrock , 1989 ) , which results in a factor of @xmath72 change in the swept up hydrogen mass .",
    "therefore , it is possible to explain the observed range in [ fe / h ] . also the larger @xmath58 - smaller [ fe / h ] relation can be explained , because a more massive , hotter star has a larger strmgren radius .",
    "this possibility can be corroborated by time scale estimates .",
    "the recombination time scale , i.e. , the strmgren sphere s life time , is @xmath73 - @xmath74 years .",
    "the stellar evolution time after the main - sequence phase , plus shock propagation time , is @xmath73 - @xmath74 years . therefore the strmgren sphere produced during the main - sequence phase survives until the sn ii explosion .",
    "then the shock radius coincides the strmgren radius , which depends on both the progenitor mass and the number density of hydrogen in the ambient ism per cubic centimeter , @xmath75 .",
    "we estimate that the hydrogen mass swept up by the shock is @xmath76 for @xmath77 25@xmath14 and @xmath78 for @xmath77 15@xmath14 , using low metal progenitor models ( schaller et al .",
    "these estimates show that the hydrogen masses differ by a factor of 10 .",
    "however , we should note that , for very small @xmath75 ( @xmath79 ) , the shock can not reach the strmgren radius , so that the hydrogen mass does not depend on the strmgren radius . on the other hand , for larger @xmath75 ( @xmath80 ) , the strmgren sphere vanishes before being approached by the shock . in this case , however , the difference in the swept up mass between larger and smaller mass stars is larger , because the longer life time of the latter makes it easier for the strmgren sphere to vanish .",
    "this possibility is worth investigating .",
    "our results in  [ sec : abundhalo ] suggest that a supernova from more massive progenitor has a deeper mass cut , thus ejecting a larger amount of @xmath2ni mass .",
    "the mass of @xmath2ni should be determined by the competition between the amount of neutrino absorbing matter and the depth of the gravitational potential .",
    "accordingly , the intermediate massive stars eject a relatively large amount of @xmath2ni because of a large neutrino absorbing region , while in a more massive star the deeper gravitational potential wins and @xmath2ni is scarcely ejected due to fallback .",
    "this is consistent with the recent @xmath2ni mass estimates from the light curve modeling for sne ii and type ib / ic supernovae ( sne ib / ic ) which are the explosions of bare cores of massive stars ( figure [ fig : mvsni ] ) . from sn",
    "iib 1993j ( nomoto et al . 1993 ; iwamoto et al .",
    "1997 ) , sn ic 1994i ( nomoto et al . 1994a ; iwamoto",
    "1994 ) and sn1987a ( e.g. nomoto et al .",
    "1994b for a recent review ) , the 13 - 20 @xmath14 stars eject @xmath81 @xmath2ni . for @xmath82 ,",
    "there has been little information , but recent sne ii / ic suggest the strong mass - dependence of fe yield .",
    "the light curve of sn ic 1997ef indicate the production of @xmath83 of @xmath2ni ( iwamoto et al .",
    "1998 ) , while that of sn ii 1997d shows the synthesis of only @xmath84 of @xmath2ni from the @xmath85 star ( turatto et al .",
    "sn ii 1994w is also a small fe producer ( sollerman et al .",
    "such an observed mass dependence of the @xmath2ni mass is consistent with the theoretical expectation .    for @xmath86",
    ", we expect that little @xmath2ni is ejected ( ww95 ) , because of a large amount of fall back . on the other hand",
    ", the outer mantle including the oxygen - rich layer would be ejected from such a massive supernova , which is also required from the galactic chemical evolution model ( tsujimoto et al .",
    "possible contributions of recently discovered hypernovae ( iwamoto et al .",
    "1998 ) are worth investigating .      in our new models , stars around @xmath87 have deeper mass cuts , thus ejecting a larger amount of fe compared with the yields adopted by tsujimoto et al .",
    ". it would be interesting to examine the consequences of such a stellar - mass dependent fe yield for the galactic chemical evolution model and to compare with observations . for [ fe / h ] @xmath88 , however , the error bars of the abundances in metal - poor stars other than cr , mn , co , ni and fe are still too large to make meaningful comparisons ( ryan 1998 ) .    for [ fe / h ] @xmath89 , we can assume that the ejecta from various sne ii are well mixed with ism .",
    "thus the abundance ratios between various elements and fe are determined by the total amount of fe ejected by previous sne ii . with the new choice of mass cuts ,",
    "the total amount of fe is almost the same as that in the previous model by tsujimoto et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , because tsujimoto et al .",
    "( 1995 ) assumed that 13 - 15 @xmath14 stars produce a larger amount of fe than stars more massive than 20@xmath14 , while in our model 13 - 20@xmath14 stars produce smaller amounts of fe than more massive stars .",
    "these differences almost cancel out , leading to similar total fe yield from sne ii .    because the total fe yield from sne ii is similar to tsujimoto et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , the evolution of the abundance ratios such as [ cr / fe ] and [ o / fe ] at [ fe / h ] @xmath89 in our model is similar to those in tsujimoto et al .",
    "figure [ fig : oovfe ] shows the evolution of [ o / fe ] against [ fe / h ] for the different fe yields from sne ii , i.e. , our model ( solid line ) and tsujimoto et al .",
    "( 1995 ; dashed line ) . in our model",
    ", we use the set [ * b * , * g * , * h * ] and assume no fe from stars more massive than 26@xmath14 .",
    "the upper mass and the lower mass of imf are set to be 40@xmath14 and 0.1@xmath14 , respectively , and the parameters of sne ia are chosen to reproduce the abundance distribution in the solar neighborhood ( kobayashi et al .",
    "these parameters are only slightly different from tsujimoto et al .",
    "( 1995 ) . our model and tsujimoto et al .",
    "( 1995 ) reproduce the observations almost equally well .",
    "the evolution of the [ mn / fe ] ratio between [ fe / h ] = @xmath60 and @xmath90 depends more on the sne ia rate rather than the sne ii rate ( kobayashi 1998 ) . at [ fe / h ] @xmath91 , [ mn / fe ] @xmath92 due to sne ii . with increasing [ fe / h ] , [ mn / fe ] approaches the solar value because of the increasing contribution of sne ia , which have [ mn / fe ] @xmath93 according to the sn ia model w7 ( nomoto et al . 1984 ) .",
    "detailed galactic halo chemical evolution models will be given in a separate paper .",
    "the deficiency of @xmath37co ( i.e. , @xmath37cu ) remains a problem .",
    "[ co / fe ] does not reach zero at [ fe / h ] = 0 in the above galactic chemical evolution model . the most important parameter which affects the abundance of @xmath37cu is @xmath28 ( see  [ subsec : yedep ] ) .",
    "lower @xmath28 produces larger [ ni / fe ] and [ co / fe ] , which results in a large deviation of [ ni / fe ] from the observations .",
    "therefore it seems unlikely that @xmath27 solves this problem .",
    "could uncertainties in nuclear cross sections solve this problem ?",
    "this may not be easy because nse is almost achieved in the region that produces @xmath37cu .",
    "thus , cross sections would not have a large effect .",
    "there are other elements which decay into co , but the amount of these elements is very small .",
    "the deficiency of co has to be investigated further .    in this work ,",
    "we use progenitor models with solar metallicity .",
    "metallicity dependence may not affect our main conclusions that the mass cut can explain the interesting trends in the abundance ratios , because the production sites of the relevant elements and their relative zone - thickness may not be so sensitive to metallicity . however , some quantitative features , e.g. , the absolute value of each yield , may be sensitive to metallicity .",
    "two of us ( h. u. & k. n. ) are currently investigating such metallicity effects .",
    "there are other potentially important effects , such as instabilities , dynamic convection , and rotation .",
    "these effects also should be investigated in the future .",
