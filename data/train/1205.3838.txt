    "the search for quantum spin liquids in frustrated quantum antiferromagnets has a long history .",
    "@xcite in recent years , thanks to the advance of numerical techniques , several candidates for spin liquids have emerged in two - dimensional ( 2d ) systems .",
    "these include the hubbard model on the honeycomb lattice ,  @xcite the spin-@xmath0 heisenberg model on kagome lattice ,  @xcite and more recently the spin-@xmath0 @xmath1 heisenberg model on the square lattice .",
    "@xcite in all these cases , a small but finite spin gap has been found and , according to generalizations of the lieb - schultz - mattis theorem for higher dimensionalities ,  @xcite a topological degeneracy is expected . in spite of these results , descriptions based upon fermionic resonating valence - bond ( rvb ) theory",
    "predict more often the existence of gapless spin - liquid states .",
    "for example , for the @xmath1 model on the square lattice ,  @xcite the heisenberg model on the triangular  @xcite or the kagome lattices ,  @xcite and , more recently , also for the unfrustrated honeycomb lattice ,  @xcite the fermionic rvb theory always predicts a gapless spin liquid phase with a dirac - type spinon dispersion as the best variational state .",
    "the @xmath1 model represents the simplest model to study the effect of frustration in a ( low - dimensional ) magnetic system ; for this reason it has been investigated by many different approaches in the last 20 years .",
    "@xcite at the classical level , the system is magnetically ordered for @xmath9 with the standard antiferromagnetic pattern at @xmath10 . for @xmath11",
    ", the ordering wave vector is moved to @xmath12 or @xmath13 ; these two ordered phases are separated by a first - order transition . within the linear spin - wave approach , which goes beyond the classical theory ,",
    "quantum fluctuations destroy the magnetic order in the intermediate region of @xmath14 , hence leading to a magnetically disordered state .",
    "@xcite however , the nature of this disordered phase is still elusive and several proposals have been raised .",
    "these include valence - bond solids with broken spatial symmetries  @xcite or gapless spin - liquid states .",
    "@xcite the latter proposal is especially attractive , since it provides a simple and very accurate fermionic rvb wave function for @xmath15 .",
    "this state has a dirac - type spinon dispersion and @xmath2 gauge structure and becomes stable for @xmath16 .",
    "more recently , density - matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) calculations provided some evidence for a fully gapped spin liquid in the intermediate region of @xmath17 .",
    "@xcite within this numerical approach , the spin gap increases linearly from @xmath18 , reaches a maximum around @xmath19 , and then rapidly decreases . for @xmath20 ,",
    "a collinear magnetic order takes place .",
    "the spin - liquid phase determined by these dmrg calculations is thus inconsistent with the fermionic rvb theory , due to presence of a finite spin gap .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the spin - liquid phase of the @xmath1 model with a bosonic rvb wave function .",
    "@xcite this is motivated by the following reasons .",
    "first , while the fermionic rvb state is found to be unable to open a spin gap for this system , a bosonic spin - liquid state is by definition gapped , because otherwise the ( bosonic ) spinon would condense and the system would develop magnetic order .",
    "second , since the spin - liquid phase is found to exist in a quite small region between two magnetically ordered phases ( for which a bosonic description is quite accurate ) , it is natural to expect that the intermediate spin - liquid phase inherits some bosonic characteristic .",
    "the bosonic rvb state has been adopted in many previous studies  @xcite and is found to describe quite well both the magnetic ordered state and the disordered state for unfrustrated systems .",
    "@xcite for frustrated magnetic systems , the use of the bosonic rvb wave function is very limited , since the loop gas algorithm for the bosonic rvb state encounters serious sign problems ; moreover , the computation of the wave function amplitude in the orthogonal ising basis involves permanents of matrices ,  @xcite implying a computational cost that grows exponentially with the size of the system . only very recently",
    ", this approach has been implemented on small clusters for the kagome lattice .",
    "@xcite    here , the bosonic rvb state is obtained after projecting the ground state of the mean - field schwinger boson hamiltonian  @xcite into the physical subspace with one spin per site .",
    "after this projection , the wave function turns out to be equivalent to the standard liang - doucot - anderson rvb ansatz ,  @xcite defined only in terms of a bosonic pairing function ( that connects opposite sub - lattices ) . to enforce the physical symmetry of the model in the rvb state",
    ", we have made a full symmetry classification of the schwinger boson mean - field ansatz on the square lattice with the projective symmetry group ( psg ) technique .",
    "@xcite then , we have performed variational monte carlo simulations in order to optimize such a bosonic rvb state , by using both the permanent monte carlo algorithm and the loop gas algorithm .",
    "we find that the bosonic rvb wave function gives a rather good variational description of the system .",
    "in addition , we find that the phase diagram predicted by the dmrg calculations can be well reproduced . more specifically , the system is found to enter a fully gapped spin liquid state around @xmath3 through a continuous transition , when the marshall sign rule in the ground state begins to be essentially violated .",
    "a level crossing of the spinon excitation is observed around @xmath5 , when the gap minimum of the spinon excitation branch is moved from the @xmath6 to the @xmath7 ( i.e. , @xmath8 ) point and a kink appears in the spin gap as a function of @xmath21 .",
    "finally , by psg symmetry considerations , it can be shown that the spin gap is always finite at the @xmath7 point in the spin - liquid region ( while it can vanish at @xmath22 , at the transition to the antiferromagnetic phase for small @xmath21 ) .",
    "this fact implies that the magnetic structure factor is always finite at the @xmath7 point , ruling out a continuous transition to the collinear phase at large @xmath21 .",

    "[ sec : model ] , we describe the model and the method ; in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] , we present our numerical results ; finally , in sec .  [ sec : conclusion ] , we draw our conclusions .",
    "in this paper , we consider the following model : @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 indicate nearest - neighbor and next - nearest - neighbor sites on the square lattice , respectively ; @xmath26 denotes the spin operator at site @xmath27 .    in the schwinger boson representation ,  @xcite the spin operator is written as @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is a boson operator , @xmath30 is the pauli matrix .",
    "bosons should satisfy the no double occupancy constraint @xmath31 , in order to be a faithful representation of the spin-@xmath0 operator . within this representation",
    ", the heisenberg super - exchange coupling can be written as ( apart from additive constants ) @xmath32 , where @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "@xcite    in the mean - field treatment , we replace @xmath35 and @xmath36 with their mean - field expectation value @xmath37 and @xmath38 , so to have : @xmath39 where @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and the chemical potential @xmath42 is introduced to fulfill , on average , the single - occupancy constraint .",
    "the mean - field ground state has the general form of @xmath43    then , a suitable rvb wave function in the _ physical _ hilbert space with one boson per site may be obtained by projecting the mean - field state , namely @xmath44 is a gutzwiller projector that enforces the constraint of one boson per site .",
    "the equivalence of the rvb state with the standard liang - doucot - anderson state  @xcite is clear after projection onto the physical subspace .",
    "the form of the rvb amplitude @xmath45 is determined by the parameters @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath42 . at the mean - field level ,",
    "@xmath46 and @xmath47 are non - zero only on those bonds with @xmath48 . however , from the variational point of view , we can take @xmath49 as a set of free parameters to construct the rvb state . in such a case , we can also introduce @xmath46 and @xmath47 on longer bonds , for which @xmath50 .    in order to describe a spin liquid state with",
    "the _ full _ symmetry of the model , the mean - filed parameters @xmath51 must satisfy certain symmetry conditions . since there exists a u(1 ) gauge degree of freedom in the schwinger boson representation of the spin operator ( i.e. , @xmath52 leaves @xmath53 unchanged ) , the symmetry requirement on the mean - field hamiltonian is actually the u(1 ) gauge projective extension of the physical symmetry of the model .",
    "such symmetry conditions on the mean - field ansatz can be readily worked out by the so called psg technique developed by wen  @xcite for the fermionic representation . the bosonic version of the psg is the u(1 ) subset of the fermionic psg .",
    "@xcite here , we will just point out some basic structures that are relevant to our study .    in the schwinger boson formalism , the mean - field parameters @xmath46 and @xmath47 describe antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic local correlations , respectively ( see appendix  [ app1 ] for the possible phases implied by this ansatz ) . here , we assume a non - zero @xmath46 between nearest - neighbor sites .",
    "then , we find that a non - zero @xmath46 between next - nearest - neighbor sites is compatible only with the so - called type b translational property of the mean - field hamiltonian ,  @xcite which implies a unit cell with two sites .",
    "we find that such state is much higher in energy than any state in the so - called type a class , characterized by a manifestly translational invariant mean - field ansatz .",

    "finally , the rvb amplitudes derived from the mean - field ground state are given by @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the number of sites , @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "the rvb amplitudes between sites in the same sub - lattice are identically zero .",
    "we would like to mention that , within the standard formulation based upon monte carlo sampling ,  @xcite only positive pairing functions @xmath78 have been considered so far . in our formulation",
    "this restriction applies only for standard antiferromagnetic phases , while negative amplitudes are found in the much more interesting spin - liquid phase .",
    "the mean - field hamiltonian  ( [ eq : mfhamiltonian ] ) has been studied by mila and collaborators ,  @xcite showing that no spin - liquid phases are stabilized and a direct transition between two ordered phases is present , with a phase diagram that is very similar to the classical limit .    in order to go beyond this approximation",
    ", we now move to the _ projected _ rvb state of eq .",
    "( [ eq : rvb ] ) , to assess the possibility that quantum fluctuations may induce a finite spin gap and , therefore , a stable spin liquid .",
    "we thus determine the parameters in the bosonic rvb state by optimizing the energy of the original @xmath1 model , rather than solving the self - consistent equations .",
    "then , the spinon gap can be estimated by inserting back the optimized parameters into the mean - field dispersion relation @xmath79 .",
    "note that the rvb wave function does not depend on the overall energy scale of the system . as a result",
    ", the spinon gap can be determined only up to a normalization constant . here",
    "we will use the chemical potential @xmath42 as the unit of energy . to have an estimate of the absolute scale of the spinon gap , we determine the pairing potential @xmath58 from the equation @xmath80 by inserting on the right - hand side the optimized values of @xmath81 and @xmath82 , which are @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "then @xmath42 can be determined by requiring that @xmath85 .",
    "the computation of the bosonic rvb wave function is very expensive in the ising basis , since it requires the calculation of permanents , for which no polynomial algorithm exists .",
    "@xcite however , on small clusters the calculation is still affordable . in this work ,",
    "we have used a @xmath86 cluster to perform the optimization of the parameters in the rvb wave function .",
    "@xcite it is important to note the key difference between the mean - field theory and the projected rvb wave function . in the mean - field theory ,",
    "the chemical potential @xmath42 is determined by the self - consistent equation for the total boson number .",
    "when the spinon gap approaches zero , the number of boson will diverge .",
    "thus , on any finite lattice , the spinon gap can never be zero and a finite - size gap must exist ( see appendix  [ app2 ] for the details on the spinon gap in the mean - field approach ) . on the contrary , after projection , the constraint of one boson per site is satisfied _ exactly _ and such a divergence will not appear . therefore , the rvb wave function is well behaved even when the spinon gap is zero .",
    "this fact implies that a vanishing spinon gap can be realized exactly after optimization of the corresponding projected rvb wave function on a relatively small cluster .    from our numerical optimization",
    ", we find that a spin gap can not be opened if we keep @xmath81 and @xmath82 only .",
    "moreover , by a direct optimization of the pairing amplitudes @xmath78 , a good accuracy can be achieved only by including a third - neighbor parameter @xmath87 , while the fourth - neighbor parameter @xmath88 is found to always negligibly small .",
    "therefore , in the following , we optimize the wave function with @xmath81 , @xmath82 and @xmath87 as variational parameters .",
    "in particular , we find that the inclusion of @xmath87 is crucial for the opening of the spin gap . the optimized value of the parameters in the rvb wave function are shown in fig .  [ fig2 ] .    the spinon gap at the @xmath6 and the @xmath7 points is shown in fig .  [ fig3](a ) .",
    "around @xmath5 , a level crossing in the spinon excitation occurs and the gap minimum changes from @xmath6 to @xmath7 . by further increasing @xmath21",
    ", the spinon gap at @xmath7 decreases and eventually approaches zero around @xmath4 . at this point",
    "the system becomes unstable with respect to magnetic ordering at @xmath12 .",
    "it should be noted that , although the spinon gap at the @xmath7 point approaches zero continuously for @xmath4 , our state can not be continuously connected to the collinear ordered state , and a first - order transition must exist between the fully symmetric spin liquid and the collinear ordered magnetic phase .",
    "this is clearly seen in the static spin structure factor : @xmath89 since @xmath90 by symmetry ( see appendix  [ app3 ] ) , the singularity in the coherence factor for @xmath91 is removed and the spin structure factor at @xmath12 is always finite .",
    "thus , the state can not be connected to the collinear ordered phase , in which @xmath92 diverges .",
    "therefore , we conclude that a first - order transition must exist between the spin liquid and the collinear ordered phase .    given the results for the spinon spectrum of fig .",

    "@xcite on the contrary , for a triplet excitation with momentum @xmath12 , we should use one spinon from the @xmath6 point and another spinon from the @xmath7 point .",

    "we would like to mention that our results for the spin gap are quite similar to the dmrg ones .",
    "@xcite indeed , within both approaches , the spin gap is found to open around @xmath3 and close around @xmath95 .",
    "in addition , a sharp maximum is present , though its position in the bosonic rvb approach is found to correspond to a lower value of @xmath21 with respect to the dmrg study .",
    "moreover , taking the value of @xmath42 estimated from eq.11 , which is @xmath96 at @xmath97 , we have that the maximal spin gap is quite consistent with the dmrg prediction .    in this work",

    "in such a picture the lowest triplet excitation within the symmetric spin liquid phase is always at @xmath10 .",
    "however , other possibilities for this structure may exist , among which a spin nematic liquid phase , which breaks the reflection symmetry @xmath98 but with all other physical symmetries intact , is especially interesting .",
    "@xcite since the dmrg calculations have been done on rectangular clusters , the nematic liquid phase can be connected to the symmetric state continuously on finite lattices .    to further check the accuracy of the bosonic rvb wave function",

    "the ground - state wave function satisfies the marshall sign rule .",
    "@xcite however , the marshall sign rule is essentially violated only for @xmath16 and , in the fermionic rvb approach , a @xmath2 spin liquid phase emerges just at the same point .",
    "@xcite a similar scenario also appear in the bosonic representation . in this case",
    ", when the rvb amplitudes from sub - lattice a to sub - lattice b are positive , then the wave function satisfies the marshall sign rule , otherwise ( if some amplitudes are negative ) the marshall sign rule is violated . in fig .",

    "the amplitude on bond @xmath106 becomes negative and the marshall sign rule is violated .",
    "it is just at this point that the spin gap opens .",
    "thus , the origin of the spin gap and the existence of the spin liquid phase can be understood as a result of violation of the marshall sign rule .",
    "such an understanding is consistent with several previous studies ,  @xcite in which the topological degeneracy , which is a hallmark of gapped spin liquid , is argued to be absent in system satisfying the marshall sign rule .",

    "the fermionic rvb wave function is better in the sense of sign structure and this is consistent with the fact that the fermionic wave function has a lower energy for large @xmath21 .",

    "the spin gap is found to have a maximum around @xmath5 , as a result of the level crossing between the spinon at @xmath6 and @xmath7 points .",

    "<S> we study the ground - state phase diagram of the spin-@xmath0 @xmath1 heisenberg model on the square lattice with an accurate bosonic resonating valence - bond ( rvb ) wave function . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to the rvb ansatz based on schwinger fermions , the representation based on schwinger bosons , supplemented by a variational monte carlo technique enforcing the exact projection onto the physical subspace , is able to describe a fully gapped spin liquid in the strongly frustrated regime . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , a fully symmetric @xmath2 spin liquid is stable between two antiferromagnetic phases ; a continuous transition at @xmath3 , when the marshall sign rule begins to be essentially violated , and a first - order transition around @xmath4 are present . </S>",
    "<S> most importantly , the triplet gap is found to have a non - monotonic behavior , reaching a maximum around @xmath5 , when the lowest spinon excitation moves from the @xmath6 to the @xmath7 point , i.e. , @xmath8 . </S>"
