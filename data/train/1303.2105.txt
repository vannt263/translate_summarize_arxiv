    "the electronic and magnetic behavior of layered @xmath2 transition metal oxides  @xcite has been a subject of intensive discussion in the last years . particularly exciting",
    "has been the suggestion by the authors of ref .",
    "that hexagonal iridates such as na@xmath0iro@xmath1 are a realization of the nearest neighbor kitaev - heisenberg ( nnkh ) model : @xmath3 this proposal is based on the premise that spin - orbit ( so ) coupling is the most important energy scale for the description of these systems so that ir @xmath2 @xmath4 orbitals are written in terms of @xmath5 and @xmath6 relativistic orbitals , with the kramers doublet @xmath5 represented by the operator @xmath7 .",
    "the combination of kitaev and heisenberg terms leads to a complex phase diagram with various magnetic and spin - liquid phases  @xcite .",
    "obviously , some of these properties can only manifest themselves when the kitaev term dominates or is at least comparable to the heisenberg term .",
    "also , other possible contributions , such as magnetic anisotropy , ring exchange or biquadratic exchange , to mention a few , may alter the phase diagram and the properties of the model considerably .",
    "most importantly , while the kitaev - heisenberg expression is the most general fully - symmetric expression for anisotropic pairwise magnetic interactions in the second order in spin in the presence of so coupling ( just as the heisenberg exchange represents the same in the isotropic non - relativistic case ) , it is not necessarily short ranged in the presence of considerable itinerancy .",
    "so far , essentially all analyses of the nnkh model for na@xmath0iro@xmath1 have been performed in the localized limit , where an assembly of weakly interacting relativistic atomic orbitals is assumed to be a good starting approximation . on the other hand ,",
    "first principles calculations suggest considerable delocalization of electrons over individual ir hexagons building quasi - molecular orbitals ( qmos )  @xcite .",
    "the associated itinerant energy scale ( the band width ) is @xmath8  ev , to be compared to the single - site spin - orbit splitting scale  @xcite @xmath9  ev and the hubbard and hund s rule correlation energy scale of @xmath10  ev .",
    "this makes the entire premise of the nnkh model questionable . at the same time , it has also been pointed out  @xcite that the nnkh model with the addition of the 2nd and 3rd neighbors heisenberg interaction is easier to reconcile with the experimental data .",
    "such relatively long - range exchange interaction is another hallmark of considerable itinerancy ( here and below , when we speak of itinerancy , we imply mostly delocalization over ir@xmath11 rings , but not necessarily over the entire crystal ) .    in the present work we revisit and discuss the validity of both limiting descriptions for na@xmath0iro@xmath1 ; itinerant ( qmo picture ) versus localized ( @xmath5 kramers doublet ) . to this end",
    ", we perform a thorough analysis of the electronic properties of na@xmath0iro@xmath1 within _ non - relativistic _ and _ relativistic _ density functional theory ( dft ) and derive , using projection on wannier functions , the relevant hopping parameters and show that qmos are naturally obtained as linear combinations of ir @xmath4 wannier functions .",
    "we discuss the relation between the quasi - molecular orbital and the relativistic orbital , @xmath12 , representations and show that the behavior of na@xmath0iro@xmath1 lies in between a fully localized and fully itinerant description .",
    "finally , the parametrization of the electronic bandstructure allows us to provide realistic estimates for the model parameters in the localized nnkh model .",
    "we thus investigate whether we are close to a regime where the kitaev interaction plays a decisive role or not .",
    "quite unexpectedly , we find that na@xmath0iro@xmath1 is an example of a material where minor details of the crystal structure can dramatically affect the electronic structure , and simple guessing of the band structure parameters , or estimating them from simplified crystallographic models ( so far all model calculations for this compound were utilizing one or the other approach ) can be exceptionally misleading .",
    "in fact some of the models energetically discussed in the community , while of undeniable theoretical appeal , are not even qualitatively close to the actual parameter range in na@xmath0iro@xmath1 .",
    "while this particular compound is very intriguing and has been enjoying extraordinary popularity lately , we want to emphasize that this strong dependence of the electronic properties on details of the crystal structure is an important result , whose relevance goes beyond specifically na@xmath0iro@xmath1 and is likely true for many other materials based on honeycomb transition - metal layers .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : two ] we review the crystal structure and magnetic properties of na@xmath0iro@xmath1 . in section  [ sec : three ] we provide details of the dft calculations and the projector method . in section  [ sec : four ] we present the results of the electronic structure analysis without inclusion of spin - orbit coupling and analyze the role of the structural distortions in na@xmath0iro@xmath1 . in section  [ sec : five ] we investigate the role of spin - orbit coupling and discuss the relation between the qmos and the relativistic orbitals ( @xmath12 ) . in this context",
    ", we discuss whether the existing experimental situation can distinguish between the dft description ( with the resulting itinerancy ) and localized ( @xmath13 models .",

    "the experimental structure of na@xmath0iro@xmath1 departs from the idealized case and shows a few distortions : ( i ) orthorhombic distortion that introduces inequality among nn ir - ir distances and among nn ir - o distances , ( ii ) iro@xmath22 octahedra rotations that place o atoms on the faces of a cube containing an ir hexagon ( see fig . 2 of ref .  ) and",

    "the fact that @xmath28 is much smaller than @xmath29 may be a signature of frustration , but it may be also caused by the itinerancy of ir @xmath2 electrons  @xcite as will be discussed in section  [ sec : six ] .",
    "the magnetic pattern observed experimentally  @xcite corresponds to a zigzag ordering , in contrast to the prediction of a stripe order by the nnkh model  @xcite ( see fig .",
    "[ patterns ] ) .",
    "recently , chaloupka _ et al . _",
    "@xcite argued that such a zigzag ordering can be also obtained by the nnkh model , when one correctly includes all the terms contributing to nn ir - ir exchange . in section",
    "[ sec : five ] , we will discuss this proposition in more detail .",
    "in this work we perform dft calculations using the linearized augmented plane wave ( lapw ) method as implemented in the full - potential code wien2k  @xcite .",
    "we employ the perdew - burke - ernzerhof generalized gradient approximation  @xcite to the dft exchange - correlation functional and set the basis - size controlling parameter @xmath30  @xcite to 7 .",
    "we consider a mesh of 500 @xmath31-points in the first brillouin zone .",

    "convergence with respect to relevant parameters ( the @xmath31-point mesh , the @xmath32 and the second variational energy cutoff , _ etc .",
    "_ ) has been carefully checked .      in order to be able to discuss various ir - ir @xmath2 processes ,",
    "we parameterize our non - relativistic dft results in terms of a tight - binding ( tb ) model where the tb ir @xmath2 hopping parameters are obtained through the wannier function projection formalism proposed in ref .   and generalized to molecular wannier functions in ref .  .",
    "we first construct wannier function projectors @xmath33 for the three @xmath4 ir  @xmath2 orbitals and calculate the tb hamiltonian @xmath34 ( in matrix form ) via @xmath35 where @xmath36 is a diagonal matrix of ir  @xmath2 @xmath4 bloch eigenvalues and the matrix @xmath37 is formed by the projectors @xmath38 . here , indices @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 run over equivalent ir atoms in the unit cell , ir  @xmath4 orbitals , and bloch bands , respectively . na@xmath0iro@xmath1",
    "has two ir per unit cell and only the six ir  @xmath4 bands near the fermi level @xmath42 are considered in the construction of projectors .",
    "we calculate the hopping integral @xmath43 between orbital @xmath40 on ir atom @xmath39 in the unit cell at a distance @xmath44 from a reference unit cell and orbital @xmath45 on ir atom @xmath46 in the unit cell at a distance @xmath47 from a reference unit cell by integrating @xmath34 over @xmath48 @xmath31-vectors in the first brillouin zone : @xmath49 where @xmath50 are the matrix elements of @xmath34 .",
    "correspondingly , the diagonal matrix elements @xmath51 give the on - site energies .      as was argued in ref .",
    ", the most natural description of the electronic structure of na@xmath0iro@xmath1 is in terms of quasi - molecular ( qmo ) orbitals localized on a hexagon .",
    "the strongest ir - ir hopping is between @xmath2 @xmath4 orbitals of neighboring iridium ions via common oxygens . in this case ,",
    "an electron on a given ir @xmath4 orbital propagates around an ir@xmath22 hexagon with the peculiarity than only a certain @xmath4 orbital at each ir participates in the hopping  @xcite , e.g. ir1(@xmath52)-ir2(@xmath53)-ir3(@xmath54)-ir4(@xmath52)-ir5(@xmath53)- ir6(@xmath54 ) ( see fig .  2 of ref .  ) .",
    "these qmos are analogous to the molecular orbitals of the benzene molecule c@xmath22h@xmath22 except for the fact that in benzene the same @xmath55-orbital on each carbon ion participates in the formation of the molecular orbital while in na@xmath0iro@xmath1 , as described above , different @xmath4 orbitals are involved in one qmo and the three @xmath4 orbitals on one ir ion contribute to three different neighboring qmos .",
    "we elaborate the details of the construction of the qmos in what follows .",
    "qmo projectors @xmath56 are obtained as linear combinations of ir  @xmath4 projectors @xmath57 : @xmath58 where in the ir  @xmath4 projectors @xmath57 , the index @xmath59 combines now the atomic index @xmath60 and orbital index @xmath40 , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath59 runs over all @xmath4 orbitals of all equivalent ir atoms .",

    "actual values for these factors depend on the manner in which a particular band structure code selects the unit cell ( see the appendix for the wien2k settings ) .",
    "in this section we analyze and discuss the ir - ir @xmath2 @xmath4 tight - binding parameters for na@xmath0iro@xmath1 _ up to second nearest neighbors_. as mentioned in section  [ sec : two ] , three structural distortions are present in na@xmath0iro@xmath1 : orthorhombic distortion , iro@xmath11 octahedra rotation and trigonal distortion .",
    "besides , the stacking of the honeycomb planes inherently violates the rhombohedral symmetry even if each plane is ideal .",
    "the formation of qmos relies on the dominance of _ _ intra__hexagon hopping  @xcite and therefore is sensitive to structural details .",
    "therefore it is important to understand the role of structural distortions in establishing electron hopping paths .",
    "this motivates us to study electronic properties of a number of artificially idealized na@xmath0iro@xmath1 unit cells where structural distortions of different types are systematically eliminated  @xcite .",
    "such a procedure has proven very useful  @xcite in understanding the behavior of sr@xmath0iro@xmath67 .",
    "we consider four different crystal structures : ( i ) the experimental crystal structure  @xcite , @xmath68 , ( ii ) an artificially idealized na@xmath0iro@xmath1 unit cell , @xmath69 , where the orthorhombic distortion has been removed from the experimental crystal structure , ( iii ) an artificially idealized na@xmath0iro@xmath1 unit cell , @xmath70 , where the iro@xmath11 octahedra rotations have been removed from @xmath69 , and ( iv ) an artificially idealized na@xmath0iro@xmath1 unit cell , @xmath71 , where the trigonal distortion has been removed from @xmath70 . table  [ total_energies ] shows a comparison of total ( non - magnetic ) dft energies for the various structures .",

    "energy is given per unit cell containing two formula units . [ cols=\">,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we present our results in figures  [ kj ] and [ all ] . in fig .",
    "[ kj ] we show the calculated values of @xmath75 and @xmath76 as a function of two variables : the @xmath77 axis is the hubbard @xmath63 associated with the upper kramers doublet , and the @xmath78 axis is the energy @xmath79 , associated with exciting an individual electron from the upper @xmath4 to an average @xmath80 state .",
    "the hubbard @xmath63 for @xmath2 electrons is , generally speaking , 1.5 to 2  ev .",
    "however , in this case it is additionally screened by the @xmath80 electrons , and also reduced by hybridization ( _ cf_. na@xmath81coo@xmath18  @xcite and fe pnictides  @xcite ) .",
    "experimental estimates of the hubbard @xmath63 defined as the energy cost for exciting electrons across the insulating gap ( which is the definition relevant to superexchange ) yield 0.3 - 0.5  ev  @xcite . additionally , lda+u calculations with @xmath82",
    "ev yield an excitation gap of the same order .",
    "we conclude that the realistic range of this parameter is 0.52  ev , with the smaller values more likely .    for the second parameter , @xmath79 , dft calculations give @xmath83  ev .",
    "this should be considered as a lower bound since dft tends to slightly overestimate the orbital overlap and crystal fields , and misses the effects of the @xmath84 hubbard interaction .",
    "one can thus limit the physically admissible range in the region 2.5  ev @xmath85  ev .    in figure",
    "[ all ] we show the phase diagram in the space of the two parameters above .",
    "several observations are in place : ( 1 ) while there is a zigzag phase in this diagram , it is very far removed from the range of the parameters that can be called physical , 0.5  ev @xmath86  ev , 2  ev@xmath87 @xmath88  ev ( even though in the above estimate we have liberally stretched the admissible range in favor of a zigzag phase ) . in fact , the zigzag regime appears only when @xmath89 , i.e. when the hubbard gap is larger than the @xmath90 splitting , a rather unlikely proposition .",
    "( 2 ) in the physical range of parameters , the ground state is either ferromagnetic or the spin liquid phase .",
    "it is rather curious that the very narrow slivers of the phase space in the @xmath91 coordinates  @xcite are transformed into a very large range in the @xmath92 space .",
    "it is also worth mentioning that in order to explain the experimental data of refs .",
    "one needs not only the ground state to be zigzag , but also that @xmath75 be several times larger than @xmath93 ; chaloupka _ et al . _",
    "@xcite used @xmath94 and @xmath95  mev .",
    "this solution can not be obtained for a given set of @xmath63 and @xmath79 ( see fig .",
    "moreover , a closer look at the expressions in their work reveals that @xmath96 , which does not depend on @xmath79 and is always negative .",
    "thus the two equalities above can not be satisfied simultaneously for any choice of parameters , be they physical or not .",
    "moreover , the values of @xmath76 and @xmath75 used in ref .   can only be obtained if @xmath97  ev , which is clearly an impossible regime .",
    "iro@xmath1 with parameters determined following ref .  .",
    "the calculated exchange integrals are functions of the mott - hubbard gap @xmath63 and the cubic crystal field splitting @xmath79 .",
    "the contours mark isolines of the ratio @xmath98 . ]      as mentioned above , an alternative interpretation of the experimental results , given in refs .",
    ", is in terms of sizable 2nd and 3rd neighbor exchange constants , comparable to the nearest neighbor exchange . in this picture",
    "the kitaev term may or may not play a role , but this role is not decisive in establishing the observed magnetic order . given that the calculated hopping amplitudes ( table i ) are clearly dominated by the nearest neighbor terms , standard superexchange can not explain such long range interactions .    however , it is important to remember that in the opposite , itinerant limit every electron is fully delocalized over a hexagon and , as such , is equally sensitive to the mean field magnetization pattern on the 1st , 2nd or 3rd nearest neighbors .",
    "as discussed in our earlier work  @xcite , the zigzag order , as compared to the stripy one , results in a sizable pseudogap at the fermi level even without a hubbard @xmath63 .",
    "this creates an energy gain that can not be cast in a form of nearest neighbor interaction , as it depends on the magnetization pattern over an entire hexagon .",
    "we are far from stating that the superexchange hamiltonian outlined in ref .",
    "is irrelevant and an itinerant description will give the final answer to all questions regarding the magnetism in na@xmath0iro@xmath1 .",
    "however , relying solely on the localized picture and , correspondingly , on the nnkh model , is , apparently , inadequate .",
    "in summary , we have performed an extensive investigation of the electronic properties of na@xmath0iro@xmath1 in the framework of non - relativistic and relativistic density functional theory calculations and derived by means of the wannier function projector method , the corresponding microscopic parameters .",
    "we resolved the following open questions : ( 1 ) by considering various idealized crystal structures for na@xmath0iro@xmath1 we could disentangle the effect of each of the structural distortions present in this system and concluded that it is the joint effect of these distortions that constructively enhances the intrahexagon effective hopping parameters and suppresses the interhexagon ones favoring the formation of quasi - molecular orbitals .",
    "( 2 ) we modelled the relativistic dft results in terms of a tight - binding model including the spin - orbit coupling term and analyzed the electronic properties of na@xmath0iro@xmath1 in terms of two complementary descriptions , the ( itinerant ) quasi - molecular basis and the ( localized ) relativistic @xmath99 basis .",
    "we observed that the behavior of na@xmath0iro@xmath1 lies in between the fully itinerant and the fully localized description and that a quasi - molecular orbital description keeps its character even at large values of the spin - orbit coupling strength .",
    "( 3 ) we showed that xas and rixs observations can be well understood within an itinerant description of na@xmath0iro@xmath1 in contrast to other iridates like sr@xmath1cuiro@xmath11 where localization is imposed by the crystallographic arrangement of the iro@xmath11 octahedra  @xcite .",
    "( 4 ) finally , we provided _",
    "ab initio_-derived estimates for the parameters appearing in the kitaev and heisenberg terms in na@xmath0iro@xmath1 and found that the recently proposed nnkh model ( see section  [ sec : six ] ) , even though it is a very interesting model _",
    "per se _ , is unfortunately not realistic for na@xmath0iro@xmath1 . in conclusion , in order to obtain a full understanding of the behavior of na@xmath0iro@xmath1 all three features ; spin - orbit , coulomb correlations and delocalization of valence electrons over ir@xmath11 hexagons are essential .    h.o.j .",

    "<S> in particular , we address the following aspects : ( i ) we investigate the role of the various structural distortions and show that the electronic structure of na@xmath0iro@xmath1 is exceptionally sensitive to structural details . </S>",
    "<S> ( ii ) we discuss both limiting descriptions for na@xmath0iro@xmath1 ; quasi - molecular orbitals ( small so limit , itinerant ) versus relativistic orbitals ( large so limit , localized ) and show that the description of na@xmath0iro@xmath1 lies in an intermediate regime . </S>",
    "<S> ( iii ) we investigate whether the nearest neighbor kitaev - heisenberg model is sufficient to describe the electronic structure and magnetism in na@xmath0iro@xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we verify the recent suggestion of an antiferromagnetic kitaev interaction and show that it is not consistent with actual or even plausible electronic parameters . finally , ( iv ) we discuss correlation effects in na@xmath0iro@xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that while the kitaev - heisenberg hamiltonian is the most general expression of the quadratic spin - spin interaction in the presence of spin - orbit coupling ( neglecting single - site anisotropy ) , the itinerant character of the electrons in na@xmath0iro@xmath1 makes other terms beyond this model ( including , but not limited to 2nd and 3rd neighbor interactions ) essential . </S>"
