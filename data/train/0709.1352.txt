    "quantum phase transition ( qpt ) is the phase transition that can only be accessed at absolute zero temperature , by the change of an external parameter or a coupling constant driven by quantum fluctuations @xcite .",

    "the hamiltonian for our extended dicke - bose - hubbard model is given by combining photon hopping between identical cavities in the photon - blockade regimes and the repulsive on - site tlas interaction with the presence of one - site energy chemical potentials , @xmath2 where @xmath3 are the index for the individual cavities and range over all sites , @xmath4 is the total number of atomic and photonic excitations .",

    "is the onset hamiltonian for @xmath0 tlas interacting with a single mode field within a photon cavity , given by the dicke model , i.e. @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the transition energy for the tlas , @xmath10 is the radiation field frequency , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the photon creation and annihilation operators , and @xmath13 are the collective raising and lowering angular momentum operators , respectively .",
    "the cavity mediated atom - photon coupling energy @xmath14 is assumed to be real here .",
    "a superfluid order parameter @xmath15 , to be physically real ( i.e. @xmath16 ) , has been introduced for the studying of the qpts in our dicke - bose - hubbard hamiltonian .",
    "the system is in the superfluid phase for a non - zero order parameter @xmath17 , while in the insulator phase for a zero order parameter @xmath18 . with the mean field assumption @xmath19 , we take decoupling approximation to investigate our dicke - bose - hubbard hamiltonian , i.e. @xmath20 which is proportional to @xmath15",
    ". then the on - site mean field hamiltonian of eq.([eqhtol ] ) reads @xmath21 this mean field hamiltonian is the same for every site . without bothering the number of nearest neighbors around each idea photon cavity , we select three nearest neighbors per cavity in our simulation for the reason that it dose not affect our numerical results actually .",
    "the interaction part @xmath22 in eq.([eqhdm ] ) actually does not change the field energy and commutes with arbitrary functions of the photon - number operator .",
    "hence , we choose the eigenstates of the total excitations @xmath4 to be the bare - states for the dicke - bose - hubbard hamiltonian .",

    "the extension of the dicke - bose - hubbard hamiltonian for arbitrary number of tlas is given in the section [ s - result ] , which can be easily calculated by the same approach .",

    "eigenstates that describe the two tlas are denoted as @xmath32 for the case all the two atoms are in the excited state , @xmath33 for the case only one atom is in the excited state , and @xmath34 for the case all the two atoms are in the ground state .",
    "these three bare - states are the normalized symmetric eigenstates of the noninteracting part @xmath35 in eq.([eqhdm ] ) .",
    "we neglect the dipole - dipole interaction , @xmath36 , and represent the two tlas interacting with the same cavity field simultaneously in an idea photon cavity . for arbitrary excitations , in order to calculate the transition amplitude of eq.([eqmf ] ) , we use these three complete symmetry degenerate bare - states replete with photons as the bases , i.e. @xmath37 here totally @xmath38 bare - state bases form a group for the whole hilbert space . based on these on - site bases , we construct a @xmath39 transition amplitude matrix for eq.([eqmf ] ) , i.e.    @xmath40\\nonumber\\\\ & & { + } { \\kappa}{|\\psi|^2}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    eq.([eqmat ] ) is the starting matrix elements for our dicke - bose - hubbard hamiltonian with mean field assumption .",
    "in general it is very difficult to diagonalize eq.([eqmat ] ) and find out all the desired dressed - states even for two tlas .",
    "however , it may be instructive to diagonalize part of the hamiltonian by assuming @xmath41 for the mean field hamiltonian . and a self - consistent method is applied for the case of @xmath17 numerically . in eq.([eqmat ] )",

    "in an idea photon cavity , when the two tlas are excited , the rest of the photons will be dressed by the two tlas . the interaction , last term in eq.([eqhdm ] ) , couples the three bare - states in the same excitation @xmath29 manifold . the eigenstates and eigenvalues",

    "<S> we extend the idea of quantum phase transitions of light in atom - photon system with dicke - bose - hubbard model for arbitrary number of two - level atoms . </S>",
    "<S> the formulations of eigenenergies , effective rabi frequencies , and critical chemical potentials for two atoms are derived . with a self - consistent method </S>",
    "<S> , we obtain a complete phase diagram for two two - level atoms on resonance , which indicates the transition from mott insulator to superfluidity and with a mean excitations diagram for confirmation . </S>",
    "<S> we illustrate the generality of the method by constructing the dressed - state basis for arbitrary number of two - level atoms . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we show that the mott insulator lobes in the phase diagrams will smash out with the increase of atom numbers . the results of this work provide a step for studying the effects with combinations of dicke - like and hubbard - like models to simulate strongly correlated electron systems using photons . </S>"
