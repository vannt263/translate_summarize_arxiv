    "2 , the structures of the carbon nanotube sheets are very complex , nanotubes and nanotube bundles having various diameters meander in three dimensions , like cooked spaghetti . therefore , the challenge is to formulate a model for these intractably complex nanotube sheets that is sufficiently simple that it can be tested and used for prediction of future results . a first approach to achieve",
    "this is to simplify the complex morphology of the meandering nanotubes in the thickness direction to a zigzag set of struts as illustrated in fig .",
    "the bends at the zigs and zags enable tractable representation of the observed deviation of nanotubes from perfect in - plane alignment and the geometrical effect of nanotube straightening on in - plane and thickness direction poisson s ratios .",
    "the bend force constant at the zigs and zags correspond to the effective force constant for elongating a meandering nanotube in a network of interacting neighboring nanotubes .",
    "coupling between intersecting nanotubes is at junctions , where the zags from one layer of zigzag chains are coupled to the zigs for the next layer of chains .",
    "the second simplification is to describe the disordered observed structure by an mechanically equivalent structure comprising layers that are periodic within the sheet plane as an ordered structure ( fig . 3 ( b ) ) .",
    "a simple example of an ordered structure that could be used for representing the nanotube sheets is similar to an egg - rack .",
    "this structure is composed of oppositely facing ` four - legged claws ' arranged on a square grid .",

    "while the egg - rack model incorporates aspects observed in real nanotube sheets , such as preferential nanotube orientation in the sheet plane ( but with positive and negative deviations from in - plane orientation ) and quite different poisson s ratios for sheet plane and sheet thickness directions , it lacks the needed isotropy for in - plane mechanical properties .",
    "anisotropic models have been previously deployed to represent sheets that have isotropic in - plane properties @xcite .",
    "uncertainty in the sign of poisson s ratio resulted from the need to average in - plane properties to obtain predicted properties for sheets having isotropic in - plane mechanical properties .",

    "are represented by zigzag chains parallel to the sheet plane ( with angle between the struts and the basal plane of @xmath10 and an inter - strut angle of 2@xmath11 = @xmath12 ) .",

    "the same mechanical properties result for the closely related structure shown in fig .",
    "6 , in which each successive layer of zigzag chains are equally likely to be added in either of two possible directions .",
    "before deformation by application of tensile stress along the @xmath14-direction , struts 1 have length @xmath15 and length projected onto the sheet plane ( @xmath16 plane ) of @xmath17 , and struts 2 have the same length ( @xmath18 ) and projected length ( @xmath19 ) as for struts 1 ( fig . 6 ) .",
    "for the special case of @xmath20 , @xmath21 .",
    "thus the structural model depicted in fig . 6 is the approximation used here to represent the complex structure of nanotube sheets .",
    "the last step on the model definition is to decide which nanotube deformation mechanisms in the real nanotube sheets will be taken into account within the model . due to the complex morphology of the nanotube sheets , the inclusion of all possible deformation types would not be possible for a predictive model .",
    "therefore , we incorporated only the deformation modes we considered to be most important for describing the mechanical properties of the nanotube sheets .",

    "2 ) , we use experimental data @xcite showing that the swnts have an average diameter of about 1.0 nm and a average bundle diameter of 20 nm and that the mwnts have an outer diameter of about 12 nm , and contain about nine walls ( fig .",
    "12 ) . from these data @xmath187 , @xmath188 , @xmath189 , and @xmath190 and @xmath191 ( @xmath151 in nm ) for swnt and mwnt sheets , respectively . for mwnts and swnt bundles sharing approximately the same length we can see that @xmath192 , two orders of magnitude larger than the previously obtained value of 2.6 when the nanotubes are considered completely rigid .",
    "while these estimates lead to positive and negative values for the in - plane poisson s ratio for swnt and mwnt sheets , respectively , in qualitatively agreement with experiment , quantitative agreement is poor ( 0.3 and @xmath00.6 for swnt and mwnt sheets , respectively , with @xmath193 nm ) . as we will see",
    ", this difference lies on the assumption that the effective force constant for elongating the nanotubes corresponds to the modulus of an individual straight nanotube .",
    "because of nanotube meandering , and possibly elasticity at inter - nanotube junctions , this assumption is not valid .    in order to better estimate @xmath56 we can proceed as follows .",
    "the young s modulus of the nanotube sheet is obtained by taking the second derivative of the per - strut energy of ( 11 ) with respect to @xmath68 ,    @xmath194    where we used @xmath195 from ( 15 ) and @xmath196 represents the volume per strut in the sheet structure . with this expression and the experimentally observed young s modulus for the nanotube sheets",
    ", we can obtain a more precise estimate of @xmath25 , instead of only @xmath22 , as previously considered in the limiting case of @xmath138 .",
    "deriving the effective strut lengths for the highly disordered swnt and mwnt buckypaper is important , since @xmath197 and @xmath196 are needed for comparing theory with experiment . in order to calculate these parameters , we look at the intersecting nanotubes ( or nanotube bundles ) as being stacked in the thickness direction like layers of logs having an effective diameter @xmath198 , where @xmath198 is the sum of the covalent diameter of the nanofiber and the 0.34 nm van der waals diameter of carbon .",
    "correspondingly , the volume per strut is @xmath199 .",
    "if the strut weight per strut length is @xmath200 and the measured nanotube sheet density is @xmath201 , then @xmath202 $ ] . using the observed densities for the mwnt ( 0.343 g/@xmath203 ) and swnt sheets ( 0.692 g/@xmath203 ) @xcite , the corresponding calculated @xmath197 for mwnt and swnt struts are 54.3 nm and 39.5 nm , respectively . while these distances seem shorter than suggested by the micrographs of fig .",
    "2 , note that these micrographs are for the sheet surface ( the face originally in contact with the filter membrane ) and do not provide the junction density and corresponding @xmath197 in the buckypaper interior . using this strut volume , eq .",
    "( [ eq_y ] ) becomes @xmath204    the @xmath140 for the mwnts is obtained by the sum of bending force constants for all component swnts ( with @xmath205 j / m@xmath143 @xcite ) and the @xmath140 for swnt bundles is derived from the measured average young s modulus for bending ( @xmath155 ) 20 nm diameter swnt bundles ( 50 gpa ) @xcite , using the force constant for bending a solid cylindrical rod @xmath206 @xcite .",
    "using the observed young s modulus ( 1.81 gpa and 3.21 gpa for mwnt and swnt sheets , respectively ) @xmath111 ( = @xmath141 ) can be self - consistently obtained from the relations above , which provides 1.84 and 0.42 for mwnt and swnt sheets , respectively .",
    "therefore , the predicted in - plane poisson s ratios are @xmath00.17 for mwnt buckypaper ( vs. the observed @xmath00.20 ) and 0.17 for swnt buckypaper ( vs. the observed 0.06 ) . considering @xmath207 gpa , which is within the range of experimental uncertainty @xcite ,",
    "the calculated @xmath56 for swnt buckypaper assumes the observed value . for this latter estimate",
    "we can see that @xmath208 in agreement with the previously predicted value of 2.6 for the case where spring constant for nanotube stretching is much larger than strut torsional rotations ( @xmath209 ) , fitted from observed in - plane and thickness direction poisson s ratios .",
    "having predicted the poisson s ratios for the mwnt content limiting cases of 0 wt .",
    "% ( swnt sheets ) and 100 wt . % ( mwnt sheets ) we expect that mwnt / swnt mixing in buckypapers can be represented by altering the intrinsic characteristics of the fibers ( nanotube bending and elongation force constants ) as well as by modifying the structural morphology ( sheet density , fiber connections ) to provide the observed intermediate poisson s ratios values .",
    "further investigations are necessary to explore all these possibilities and thus to provide a better understanding of the behavior of the poisson s ratios for buckypapers having intermediated mwnt content .",
    "we proposed a relatively simple model to represent the complex morphology of carbon nanotube sheets and to describe the behavior of the poisson s ratios .",
    "the model incorporates key structural features of the nanotube sheets : isotropic in - plane mechanical properties , nanotubes preferentially oriented in the sheet plane , and freedom to undergo stress - induced elongation as a result of straightening meandering nanotubes and changing the angle between intersecting nanotubes .",
    "the nanoscale origin of the constituent elements of the nanotube sheets is shown to play a fundamental role in determining the mechanical behavior that leads to auxetic features , specially the ratio between the force constants associated with the fiber bending and elongation .",
    "qualitative and quantitative agreement with experiment were obtained using the poisson s ratio expressions derived from the model , encouraging its use in predicting future results and new properties .",
    "specifically , negative linear compressibility ( material expansion in the sheet plane under hydrostatically compression ) was predicted for carbon nanotube sheets with the average angle of the fibers with respect to the sheet plane smaller than about 35@xmath4 , a value which is not too far from already produced nanotube sheets .",
