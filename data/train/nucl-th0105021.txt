    "the na50 collaboration has observed an anomalous @xmath0 suppression in @xmath1 @xmath1 collisions , i.e. a suppression significantly larger than the one expected from the extrapolation of @xmath8 and @xmath9 data .",
    "furthermore , the shape of the ratio @xmath0 over @xmath4 shows a clear change of curvature  from concave to convex  at @xmath2  gev close to the knee of the @xmath3 distribution followed by a steady decrease at larger @xmath5 .",
    "it is important for the discussion in this paper to distinguish between two types of analysis of the data @xcite .",
    "one is the standard analysis , in which the ratio @xmath0 over @xmath4 is measured .",
    "the other one is called the minimum - bias analysis . in the latter",
    "only the ratio of @xmath0 over minimum bias ( @xmath10 ) is measured  and is multiplied by a theoretical ratio @xmath10 over @xmath4 , i.e.    [ 1e ] ( j / dy ) _",

    "data for the true ratio @xmath0 over @xmath4 , i.e. obtained in the standard analysis , are only available up to the knee of the @xmath3 distribution .",
    "they give some indication of the change of curvature at @xmath11  gev mentioned above .",
    "however , the information on the behaviour of this ratio at larger values of @xmath3 comes entirely from the @xmath10 analysis . in this analysis ,",
    "the second factor in ( [ 1e ] ) is practically constant for @xmath12  gev and therefore the behaviour of the ratios @xmath0 over @xmath4 and @xmath0 over @xmath10 in this large @xmath3 region is practically the same .",
    "in this paper we present a simple ansatz according to which the ratio @xmath4 over @xmath10 is not constant at large @xmath3 but decreases for @xmath12  gev , i.e. its behaviour is qualitatively similar to the one of the ratio @xmath0 over @xmath10 . as a consequence ,",
    "the true ratio @xmath0 over @xmath4 for @xmath12  gev is significantly flatter than the one obtained according to eq .",
    "( [ 1e ] )  and in good agreement with the predictions based on comovers interaction , taking into account the fluctuations in the density of comovers at large @xmath3 .",
    "our ansatz is based on the trivial observation that , in the @xmath0 event sample , @xmath13  gev is taken by the @xmath0 trigger and , thus , the transverse energy deposited in the calorimeter by the other hadron species will be slightly smaller than the corresponding one in the @xmath10 event sample .",
    "this decrease is , of course , very small .",
    "however , its effect on the ratio of @xmath0 over @xmath10 at the tail of the @xmath3 distribution is much larger . a possible way to determine",
    "this hadronic @xmath5 loss is the following ( see section 2c for a more detailed discussion ) .",
    "assume that one pair of participants , out of @xmath14 , produces the @xmath0 and no other hadrons , except , of course , in the fragmentation regions of the collision of this pair ( which will contain at least the two leading baryons ) .",
    "the binary collisions of the remaining @xmath15 pairs are assumed to produce ordinary hadrons , exactely in the same way as in the @xmath10 event sample . in this case , the @xmath5 loss in the @xmath0 event sample at @xmath16 ( where @xmath14 is close to 200 ) is about 0.5  % . in order to have a rough estimation of its effect on the @xmath0 over @xmath10 ratio at the tail of the @xmath5 distribution let us consider the @xmath17 correlation @xmath18 with the values of the parameter given below ( section 2a ) we find at @xmath19  gev  :    [ 2e ] p_mb ( e_t = 130  gev , b = 0 ) p_j/ ( e_t = 130 , b = 0 ) = 1.3  .",
    "such an effect is close to what is needed in the model of refs . in order to reproduce the data",
    "this shows that a small variation in the value of @xmath20 between the @xmath0 and the @xmath10 event samples ( 0.5  % ) , produces a much larger effect in their ratio at the tail of the @xmath3 distribution .",
    "a more precise calculation of the hadronic @xmath5 loss and of its effect on the ratio @xmath0 over @xmath10 beyond the knee will be given below .",
    "however , independently of any details , we see that one should be very cautios in interpreting the experimental results on this ratio beyond the knee of the @xmath5 distribution .",
    "clearly , the effect discussed above will affect the ratio @xmath4 over @xmath10 in a similar way  while the ratio @xmath0 over @xmath4 turns out to be practically unaffected .",
    "of course , the ratio of @xmath0 over @xmath4 , obtained according to eq .",

    "we describe a model for @xmath0 suppression based on comovers interaction with the comovers density computed in the dual parton model ( dpm ) .",
    "we show that in the rapidity region of the dimuon trigger , the charged multiplicity per participant increases with centrality , whereas in that of the @xmath3 calorimeter it is centrality independent . in section 2b",
    "we introduce fluctuations in the density of comovers beyond the knee of the @xmath3 distribution . in section",
    "2c we propose a simple ansatz to compute the loss in the average @xmath21 of the @xmath0 event sample resulting from the trigger requirement . in section 3",

    ", most models , based on either deconfinement or comovers interaction , give a ratio @xmath0 over @xmath4 which is practically constant  in disagreement with na50 data .",
    "a possible way out was suggested in @xcite .",
    "the idea is that , since @xmath3 increases beyond the knee due to fluctuations , one can expect that this is also the case for the density of comovers .",

    "@xmath3 is the measured value of the transverse energy and @xmath21 is its average value given by eq .",
    "( [ 10e ] )  which does not contain the fluctuations .",
    "the replacement ( [ 13e ] ) assumes that the fluctuation in @xmath67 , in the rapidity region of the dimuon trigger , is identical to the fluctuation in @xmath3 measured by the calorimeter . since these two regions do not overlap , the two fluctuations could be weakly correlated .",
    "however , this is not the case in string models where multiplicity fluctuations are mainly due to fluctuation in the number of strings ( rather than to multiplicity fluctuations within individual strings ) .",
    "this introduces long - range rapidity correlations @xcite ( see also @xcite for a discussion on this point ) .",
    "it has been shown in @xcite that , introducing the fluctuations given by ( [ 13e ] ) in a deconfining approach , one can describe the na50 data , at large and intermediate values of @xmath3 , either with two sharp deconfining tresholds or with a gradual onset of @xmath0 suppression ( rather than a sharp one ) . moreover , according to the anaysis of @xcite , it should also fail to describe the preliminary data @xcite on the @xmath0 suppression versus the energy @xmath68 of the zero degree calorimeter for peripheral collisions .",
    "indeed , it was shown in @xcite that these data confirm the low @xmath3 shape of the data versus @xmath3 .",
    "moreover , this new data require the anomalous suppression to be present for very peripheral @xmath1 @xmath1 collisions . ] .    introducing the replacement ( [ 13e ] ) in the comovers model of section 2a",
    ", we obtain @xcite a change of curvature in the ratio @xmath0 over @xmath4 at @xmath2  gev . however , its decrease at larger values of @xmath3 is smaller than the experimental one . in the next section ,",
    "we introduce a new mechanism which increases the @xmath0 suppression at large @xmath3 , in the @xmath10 analysis .",
    "as discussed in the introduction , due to energy conservation , the production of a @xmath0 in the dimuon trigger produces a decrease of the @xmath3 of ordinary hadrons in the @xmath0 event sample  as compared to its value in the @xmath10 one .",
    "as discussed there , this effect is strongly amplified in the tail of the @xmath3 distribution .",
    "the size of this hadronic @xmath5 loss is very small .",
    "however , its exact value is difficult to compute since we do not know in detail the rapidity region affected by the about 3 gev of @xmath3 taken by the @xmath0 .",
    "we propose the following ansatz .",
    "let us single out the @xmath42 collision in which the @xmath0 is produced and let us assume that in this collision no hadrons , other than the @xmath0 , are produced in the central rapidity interval @xmath69  which includes the regions of the @xmath3 calorimeter and of the dimuon trigger . of course",
    ", ordinary hadrons , in particular the two leading baryons , will be produced in the two fragmentation regions of this collision . with this assumption ,",

    "( [ 10e ] ) by eq .",
    "( [ 14e ] ) is the maximal possible one .",
    "actually , this is not the case .",
    "indeed , it could happen that the @xmath0 trigger produces a decrease of the average energy of the other collisions involving either one of the two nucleons of the binary collision which produces the @xmath0 .",
    "in ( [ 14e ] ) we have assumed that this is not the case and that all these extra collisions produce exactly the same hadronic multiplicity as in the @xmath10 case .",
    "one could instead assume that no ordinary hadrons are produced in these extra collisions either , i.e. that one pair of participants produces only the @xmath0 and no other hadrons ( in the central rapidity interval defined above ) .",
    "in this case ( [ 10e ] ) should be scaled down by a factor @xmath70 , i.e.    [ 15e ] e_t(b ) = 1 2  q  n_a(b ) - 1 n_a(b ) n_y_ca^co(b ) .    both possibilities , eqs .",
    "( [ 14e ] ) and ( [ 15e ] ) , will be discussed in the next section but , obviously , their effect is negligibly small . ] .",
    "of course , for the @xmath10 event sample we use eq .",

    "using the values in table 1 we obtain 6.6 . multiplying it by 1.5 to include the neutrals and assuming an average @xmath5 per particle of 0.5 gev we obtain an average @xmath5 loss of @xmath73  gev .",
    "this is the average @xmath5 loss induced by eq .",
    "( [ 15e ] ) , where the contribution of one participant pair to the hadronic @xmath5 has been removed . at @xmath74 , where @xmath14 is close to 200",

    "we observe a turn - over and a subsequent decrease at large @xmath3 , qualitatively similar to the one in @xmath0 over @xmath10 ratio , but smaller in magnitude due to the absence , here , of the comover interaction  and , hence , of the effect of the fluctuations .",
    "it is interesting that the data , although having large statistical errors , also seem to indicate a turn - over . in any case , they are consistent with our results over @xmath10 has been measured in 1996 .",
    "the na50 collaboration does not consider the 1996 data to be reliable beyond the knee due to possible contamination of rescattering in the ( thick ) target .",
    "however , from the comparison of 1996 and 1998 data on the ratio @xmath0 over @xmath10 , we can expect that , using a thin target , the @xmath4 over @xmath10 ratio beyond the knee would be smaller than with a thick one . ] .",
    "a test of our mechanism could be provided by a measurement of the ratio open charm over @xmath10 beyond the knee .",

    "the agreement with the na50 data obtained with the @xmath10 analysis is substantially improved .",

    "while this allows to improve considerably the statistics , it can only be safely used from peripheral collisions up to the knee of the @xmath3 distribution . beyond it , this ratio is very sensitive to small differences between the average @xmath3 of the @xmath0 and @xmath10 event samples .",
    "we have argued that such a difference is indeed present due to the @xmath3 taken by the @xmath0 trigger .",
    "we have introduced a simple , physically sound , ansatz to evaluate this @xmath3 loss in the @xmath0 event sample ( as compared to its value in the @xmath10 one ) and have shown that with this ansatz the na50 data for the ratio @xmath0 over @xmath10 can be reproduced . in our model , this mechanism does not affect the true ratio @xmath0 over @xmath4  i.e. the one obtained by the standard analysis .",

    "agreement is obtained with the na50 data for this ratio , in both analysis .",
    "an unavoidable consequence of our approach is that the ratio @xmath4 over @xmath10 should also exhibit a turn - over close to the knee of the @xmath3 distribution followed by a subsequent decrease .",
    "actually , the 1996 na50 data @xcite provide some indication of such a turn - over .",
    "our results are in agreement with these data .    independently of the details of our implementation of the hadronic @xmath3 loss in the @xmath0 event sample",
    ", the analysis presented here indicates that it is premature to interpret the na50 data at large @xmath3 ( beyond the knee of the @xmath3 distribution ) as a manifestation of a phase transition to a new state of matter .",
    "actually , we have shown that a model based on comovers interaction provides a good description of the na50 data in the whole @xmath3 region .",
