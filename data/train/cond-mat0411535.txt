    "<S> we design and analyze a solid state qubit based on electron spin and controlled by electrical means . </S>",
    "<S> the coded qubit is composed of a three - electron complex in three tunable gated quantum dots . </S>",
    "<S> the two logical states of a qubit , @xmath0 and @xmath1 , reside in a degenerate subspace of total spin @xmath2 states . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate how applying voltages to specific gates changes the one - electron properties of the structure , and show how electron - electron interaction translates these changes into the manipulation of the two lowest energy states of the three - electron complex .    </S>",
    "<S> considerable experimental and theoretical effort is currently being applied towards the realisation of scalable quantum bits and gates . @xcite </S>",
    "<S> electron spin - based qubits are considered to be viable candidates due to demonstrated long coherence times @xcite . for single quantum dots @xcite </S>",
    "<S> it is now possible to isolate , control , and exploit the spin properties of electron at the single - spin level @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> simultaneously , progress has been made in coupled quantum dot systems , where control of electron numbers in individual dots and coupling between the dots necessary to realise the building blocks for quantum information processing @xcite has been demonstrated . despite this progress </S>",
    "<S> many obstacles need to be overcome before elementary quantum operations on electron spin - based qubits@xcite can be demonstrated . </S>",
    "<S> one of the fundamental challenges is the task of isolating a single - electron spin and contacting it to perform single - qubit operations . </S>",
    "<S> this challenge stems from the need to produce a localised and switchable magnetic field required for spin manipulation . </S>",
    "<S> a number of solutions have been proposed @xcite to replace the local magnetic field by locally engineered coupling ( @xmath3-factor ) to the constant magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath3-factor engineering has to be combined with equally challenging spatial manipulation of electron position using surface gates . </S>",
    "<S> to date , even single - qubit operation of qubits based on electron spin still awaits demonstration . </S>",
    "<S> an alternative solution to the problem of qubit operations on a single spin was proposed by divincenzo , lidar and collaborators @xcite , who suggested quantum computation with exchange interaction . </S>",
    "<S> the basic idea is to replace the two - level system based on the single - electron spin with selected levels of a composite object consisting of several spins . </S>",
    "<S> the manipulation of selected quantum levels proceeds not through operations on single spins but through manipulation of the coupling @xmath4 between neighbouring spins due to exchange interaction . </S>",
    "<S> for example , two qubit states @xmath5 and @xmath6 for a single total spin @xmath2 can be identified with two opposite spin directions ( @xmath7 ) up and down : @xmath8 and @xmath9 . by contrast , in a coded qubit consisting of three localised electron spins ( @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 ) we start by selecting a total spin @xmath7 of the three spins , e.g. , @xmath13 . a state with this direction can be realised by three different states : @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 , which differ by the position of the spin pointing up . </S>",
    "<S> we can group these three states into a single state with total spin @xmath17 and two orthogonal states with total spin @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> examples of the two orthogonal spin states forming the two logical qubit states @xmath0 and @xmath1 are @xmath18 and @xmath19 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the properties of a three - electron complex in a single quantum dot , including the two logical spin states discussed above , have been analyzed previously@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the three - electron states are a product of the orbital and spin part . </S>",
    "<S> the spin part has been discussed in terms of the logical qubit states . </S>",
    "<S> but it is precisely the orbital part , and specifically the one electron wavefunction , that can be manipulated using voltages , and hence it plays a crucial role in a coded qubit . in what follows we employ the methodology which allowed for a quantitative understanding of a single dot with controlled number of electrons @xcite to study the energy levels and spin and orbital wave functions of a realistic coded qubit . </S>",
    "<S> we show that there exist two low - energy states which map very well onto the two logical qubit states , and that they can be manipulated by applied voltages .    </S>",
    "<S> the proposed device is shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1]a . </S>",
    "<S> it consists of a metallic gate defining three coupled lateral quantum dots . </S>",
    "<S> the dots are defined by locally depleting the two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) at a distance @xmath20 below the surface . </S>",
    "<S> application of a negative voltage creates a broad region depleted of electrons , with three identical minima . </S>",
    "<S> an additional gate ( the control gate @xmath21 ) , shown in red , is positioned in - between the two adjacent dots 1 and 2 . the gate @xmath21 lowers or increases the tunnelling barrier between the two dots . </S>",
    "<S> as we will show , the effect of the gate is identical to the effect of the @xmath22 operation acting on logical qubit states . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath22 acting on logical qubit @xmath0 transforms it into qubit @xmath1 and vice versa . </S>",
    "<S> the manifestation of the @xmath22 operation is the energy splitting @xmath23 of the two degenerate logical qubit states . in order to have complete logical qubit rotation we need a second gate . </S>",
    "<S> this gate , labelled @xmath24 , plays the role of @xmath25 spin operation , and in our model it tunes the potential minimum of the third dot . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we need to precisely control the number of electrons @xmath26 in our device . </S>",
    "<S> this can be accomplished by following the detailed design which allowed to control the number of electrons in single and coupled quantum dots @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the operation of gates translates into the changes of a potential seen by each of the three electrons in a coded qubit . </S>",
    "<S> the electrostatic potential @xmath27 in the electronic plane due to the gates on the surface is given by an integral over the potential @xmath28 applied to the gates as @xcite latexmath:[\\[v_e(\\vec{r } ) = \\int { { d\\vec{r}'\\over 2\\pi }    @xmath20 is the distance between the surface and the 2deg layer , and @xmath28 is the electrical potential on the surface , corresponding to the appropriate voltage on the gates , and equal to zero in the openings ( the holes ) . in our calculation , we express all energies and distances in the units of effective rydberg , @xmath30 , and effective bohr radius , @xmath31 , respectively . here , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the electronic charge and effective mass , respectively , @xmath34 is the dielectric constant of the semiconductor , and @xmath35 is the dirac s constant . for gaas </S>",
    "<S> these units are @xmath36 mev , and @xmath37 @xmath38 10 nm . </S>",
    "<S> the candidate for a coded qubit investigated here has the length of the side of the rectangular gate of @xmath39 @xmath40 ( for better visibility of the potential minima , in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] we only show a central part of the gate , with side length of 14 @xmath40 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the diameter of the opening ( the hole ) in the gate is taken to be @xmath41 @xmath40 , the distance between the centers of each pair of holes is @xmath42 @xmath40 , and the distance between the gate and the 2deg layers is 14 @xmath40 . </S>",
    "<S> the voltage applied to the main gate corresponds to the electronic potential energy @xmath43 @xmath44 in the plane of the gates . </S>",
    "<S> as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] , the pattern of the holes in the surface gate translates into three potential minima on the electronic plane . as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1]a , if the voltage of the control gate @xmath21 is set to zero , the three potential minima are identical . </S>",
    "<S> but if we apply voltage @xmath45 @xmath44 , i.e. , opposite to that of the main gate , the barrier between two of the dots is lowered and the dots 1 and 2 are strongly coupled . </S>",
    "<S> note that the two other tunnelling barriers are weakly affected by the control gate . </S>",
    "<S> the voltage applied to the gates couples to the charge of the electron and determines the potential @xmath46 acting on each individual electron . </S>",
    "<S> the potential determines the single - electron energies @xmath47 and wave functions @xmath48 . </S>",
    "<S> the external voltages applied to control gates affect directly only single - electron properties , and through the modification of single - electron energies and wave functions - the states of the three - electron complex . to calculate the single - electron spectrum we discretize the area under the gates , and define the single - electron states @xmath48 on a lattice @xmath49 with spacing @xmath50 . </S>",
    "<S> electrons move on a lattice , and their spectrum is described by the tight - binding hamiltonian : @xmath51 where the site energy and hopping matrix elements are given by @xmath52 and @xmath53 , respectively . as a result we obtain a large , but sparse hamiltonian matrix , which is diagonalized using the conjugate gradient method . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2]a we show the calculated energies @xmath47 corresponding to nine lowest single - particle states as a function of the potential @xmath21 of the control gate . at zero bias </S>",
    "<S> the spectrum consists of three energy levels , the ground state and two degenerate excited states , separated by a gap from the rest of the spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding three lowest single - particle wave functions at zero bias are shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2]b . </S>",
    "<S> the states and the energy spectrum can be understood by considering a linear combination of wave functions @xmath54 localized on @xmath55-th dot . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding ground state can be written as @xmath56 , and the two degenerate excited states as @xmath57 and @xmath58 . in all of these states the electron is delocalised and shared between all dots . </S>",
    "<S> for negative gate voltages , i.e. , when the barrier between the two dots is lowered , the two excited states mix and energy levels split . </S>",
    "<S> when the voltage is zero , the three dots are identical , and the two excited states are degenerate . as the barrier between the two dots </S>",
    "<S> is increased even further ( positive gate voltages ) , the energies of degenerate states are split again . in this case , however , the splitting is not large . </S>",
    "<S> we attribute it to the fact that , in this regime , all interdot barriers are already high and the three dots are almost isolated . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , a further increase of the control gate voltage increases the total energy of the system , but does not lead to a significant symmetry breaking . now that we understand the effect of gate voltages on a single electron , we proceed to consider three electrons localized in our three - dot potential . </S>",
    "<S> we describe simultaneously the spin and orbital three - electron states in the language of second quantization as @xmath59 . </S>",
    "<S> the operator @xmath60 ( @xmath61 ) creates ( annihilates ) an electron with spin @xmath62 on the single - particle state @xmath63 calculated from eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ eq1 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the electron - electron interactions mix different three - electron configurations for a given set of applied voltages . the mixing is governed by the matrix elements of the hamiltonian , which takes the form : @xmath64 where the energies @xmath65 and matrix elements </S>",
    "<S> @xmath66 of the coulomb potential are implicit functions of the applied voltages @xmath21 , @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> these matrix elements are independent of spin . </S>",
    "<S> they are calculated in real space as @xmath67^{1/2}},\\ ] ] with parameter @xmath68 accounting for the finite thickness of the electron layer ( in the following example we take @xmath69 @xmath40 ) . to capture spin effects </S>",
    "<S> we generate all possible configurations of three electrons on @xmath70 single - particle states and classify them by total spin @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this allows us to construct the hamiltonian matrix separately in the spin @xmath71 and spin @xmath72 basis and diagonalize these matrices numerically . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig3 ] shows the low - energy segment of the three - electron energy spectrum as a function of the voltage on the control gate @xmath21 ( the energies are measured from the ground - state energy ) . </S>",
    "<S> the low - energy spectrum consists of two low - energy states corresponding to the two states of the @xmath2 hilbert space ( black lines ) , while the energy of the higher state corresponds to the high - spin @xmath17 state ( red line ) . </S>",
    "<S> the fact that the two @xmath2 logical qubit states are the lowest energy states is important as it facilitates the intialization of a qubit . </S>",
    "<S> it is also a rather counterintuitive result as one might expect exchange to favor spin polarized state . </S>",
    "<S> a detailed analysis of the correlations in a coded qubit and analogies with hubbard model will be presented elsewhere . </S>",
    "<S> the central result of this paper rests on the identification of the two lowest energy @xmath2 states of a three electron complex as the two logical states of the coded qubit . </S>",
    "<S> the two logical states can be manipulated by applying gate voltage @xmath21 , which shifts the energy of the two levels , as seen in figure  [ fig3 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the voltage @xmath21 acts analogously to the @xmath22 operation , while the @xmath25 operation can be implemented by applying voltage @xmath24 .    </S>",
    "<S> the remaining concern is that the two logical qubit states be well isolated from other states with the same total spin . </S>",
    "<S> the inset in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] shows the energy spectrum over larger energy scale , with a significant gap in the energy spectrum between the two logical qubit states and the remaining @xmath2 states .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , we show that realistic calculations of a lateral gated quantum dot device produce a voltage - tuneable qubit based on electron spin </S>",
    "<S> . the device should be able to combine long coherence time inherent to spin with ease of operation inherent to electrical means . </S>",
    "<S> while the understanding of real - time operation of the qubit , its coupling to environment , and design of complex qubit circuits remains to be investiagted , it appears that coded qubits based on electron spin are promising devices for quantum information processing . </S>"
