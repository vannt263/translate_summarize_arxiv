    "the ternary semiconducting compounds with the formula @xmath2 and @xmath3 such as @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 etc have been widely investigated because of their potential applications in electro - optic , optoelectronic and nonlinear optical devices .",
    "these compounds are promising candidates for solar cells @xcite , photovoltaic detectors , light emitting diodes @xcite , modulators , filters such as optical light eleminator filters @xcite and optical frequency conversion applications in solid state based tunable laser systems @xcite . among the two chalcopyrite type crystals",
    "the most intensive studies have been carried out in the series of @xmath8 family compounds where cu is involved as a group i element @xcite .",
    "very few works have appeared in literature where the group i element is ag @xcite .",
    "no detailed experimental and theoretical study of @xmath2 type semiconductors where group i element is ag and group iii element is al have been carried out .",
    "the substitution of a group i and a group iii elements give an average result similar to that of a group ii element in ii - vi compounds .",
    "so in case of @xmath0 the presence of three different kind of atoms provide desired structural , electronic and optical properties to satisfy the criteria for suitable electronic devices @xcite .",
    "+ @xmath8 type chalcopyrite semiconductors are also important from chemistry and physics point of view in many aspects . due to presence of group ib transition metal",
    "the d - electrons participate in chemical bonding .",
    "therefore it is important to know how much contribution of d - electrons are there and how they influence the electronic properties .",
    "many defect systems of this type of chalcopyrites have also been synthesized and studied @xcite . due to defect structure ,",
    "the system is more porous and so they have rich chemistry",
    ". therefore the defect systems can be doped by suitable elements to synthesize new materials @xcite .",
    "+ jaffe and zunger @xcite have proposed theory for band gap anomalies for @xmath2 chalcopyrite semiconductors relative to the binary analogous with the detailed study of cu - based chalcopyrites .",
    "they have shown significant effects of structural distortion on the band gap .",
    "their calculation was based on the potential - variational - mixed basis ( pvmb ) taking the experimental lattice parameters .",
    "similar effects are also expected for ag - based chalcopyrite but there are no systematic study carried out for these compounds .",
    "we fill up this gap .",
    "we have carried out a detailed band structure calculation using localized tight binding linear muffin - tin orbital ( tb - lmto ) method @xcite .",
    "the ab - initio calculation is based on density functional theory ( dft ) @xcite . unlike taking experimental lattice constants we have calculated total energy to find the equillibrium lattice constants , tetragonal distortion ( @xmath1 ) and anion displacement parameter ( u ) .",
    "+ shay and kasper @xcite have shown that for cu - based chalcopyrite the reduction in the band gaps relative to their binary analogous is co - related with the existance of d - bonding .",
    "their calculation was based on the study of spin - orbit splitting .",
    "this is further varified by jaffe and zunger @xcite .",
    "artus and his group @xcite have measured spin - orbit interaction at the fundamental gap for @xmath9 .",
    "they found that this splitting is smaller than the splitting for analogous ideal zinc blende structure .",
    "they argued that this is because of p - d hybridization .",
    "we have also shown with detailed calculation of partial density of states ( pdos ) that hybridization of d - orbital of ag with p - orbital of anion have significant contribution to band gap . in tb - lmto method , the basis functions are localized .",
    "therefore , very few basis functions are required to represent the highly localized d - orbital of ag in the systems under study .",
    "hence the calculation is not only cost effective , it gives also the accurate result .",
    "to start with , for our electronic structure calculations we have used the well established tb - lmto method , discussed in detail elsewhere @xcite .",
    "electron correlations are taken within lda of dft @xcite .",
    "we have used the von barth - hedin exchange @xcite with 512 * k*-points in the irreducible part of the brillouin zone .",
    "the basis of the tb - lmto starts from the minimal set of muffin - tin orbitals of a kkr formalism and then linearizes it by expanding around a ` nodal ' energy point @xmath10 . the wave - function",
    "is then expanded in this basis : @xmath11\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where , @xmath12 @xmath13 and @xmath14 are tb - lmto potential parameters and @xmath15 is the structure matrix .",
    "[ structural properties ] the tetragonal unit cell of a typical chalcopyrite semiconductor consists of two zinc blende unit cells .",
    "there are four ag atoms , four al atoms and eight m ( m = s , se , te ) atoms per unit cell .",
    "the positions of the various atoms in the tetragonal unit cell are : a(ag ) :  0.0  0.0  0.0 ; b(al ) :  0.0  0.0  0.5 ; c(m ) : u  0.25  0.125 , where ` u ' is anion displacement parameter . in an ideal zinc - blende structure of binary compound like gaas each anion has four similar cations as nearest neighbour . so the bond lengths are equal ( @xmath16 ) and the charge distribution is identical around each bond . therefore in binary compound ,",
    "having zinc blende structure , u is 0.25 and @xmath1 = 1 .",
    "we refer this as ideal case .",
    "but in chalcopyrite system under study each anion has two ag and two al cations as nearest neighbours as shown in figure 1 . due to dissimilar atoms as neighbours the anion acquires an equilibrium position closer to one pair of cation than to other .",
    "this new position of anion is called anion displacement which is the main cause for bond alternation ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "we refer this case as ` non - ideal ' case ( @xmath18 & @xmath19 ) . the quantity @xmath20 measures the extent to which the bond will alter in a system .",
    "the bond alternation gives rise to structure anomalies relative to the ideal zinc blend structure and it has significant effect on band gap .",
    "+ for self consistent calculation we introduce empty spheres because the packing fraction is low due to tetrahedral co - ordination of ions .",
    "we ensure proper overlap of muffin tin spheres for self consistency and the percentage of overlap is found .",
    ".[label ] structural parameters including bond lengths of @xmath0 .",

    "calculations and study of @xmath0 ( m = s , se , te ) suggest that these compounds are direct band gap semiconductors with band gaps of 1.98 ev , 1.59 ev and 1.36 ev respectively .",
    "our study further shows that electronic properties of these semiconductors significantly depend on structural distortion and the type of hybridization .",
    "the calculation is carried out using dft based tb - lmto method .",
    "we have used lda for our exchange co - relation functional .",
    "taking into account of the underestimation of band gap by lda , our result of band gap and structutal properties agree with experimental values .",
    "detail study of tdos and pdos shows that p - d hybridization between ag - d and anion - p drastically reduces the band gap .",
    "the reduction is 51% , 47% , 42% respectively for m = s , se and te . but",
    "band gap increases due to anion displacement in contrast to the result obtained by jaffe and zunger @xcite in case of @xmath25 .",
    "this is due to the relative value of anion displacement parameter ` u ' . in the case of @xmath0 ,",
    "u increases whereas for @xmath25 it decreases with respect to the ideal value u = 0.25 corresponding to binary zinc blende structure .",
    "the gap enhancement due to anion distortion is 9.8% , 8.2% and 5.1% respectively for @xmath0 ( m = s , se and te ) .",
    "tdos and pdos further show that there is significant effect on the electronic properties due to structural distortion and the presence of p - d hybridization .",
