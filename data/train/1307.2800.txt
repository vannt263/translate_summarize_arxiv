    "codes , recently introduced by arikan @xcite , are the first structured codes that provably achieve the symmetric capacity of binary - input memoryless channels ( bmcs ) . given a bmc @xmath0 , by performing the channel polarizing transformation over @xmath1 independent copies of @xmath0",
    ", we get a second set of synthesized bmcs .",
    "as the transformation size @xmath1 goes infinity , some of the resulting channels tend to completely noised , and the others tend to noise - free , where the fraction of the latter approaches the symmetric capacity of @xmath0 . by transmitting free bits over the noiseless channels and sending fixed bits over the others",
    ", polar codes can achieve the symmetric capacity under a successive cancellation ( sc ) decoder with both encoding and decoding complexity @xmath2 .    in delay insensitive communications , hybrid automatic repeat request ( harq )",

    ", an information block of @xmath3 bits is fed into a polar encoder .",
    "the output codeword of @xmath4 bits are punctured into @xmath5 bits and sent over the channel .",
    "if the receiver fails to decode the codeword , an nack ( negative acknowledgement ) is sent to the transmitter through the feedback channel .",
    "and then , @xmath6 of the information bits are retransmitted .",
    "the receiver tries to perform decoding with all the received @xmath7 bits .",
    "if the decoding is failed again , another @xmath8 bits are transmitted .",
    "this process continues until the transmitter receives an ack ( acknowledgement ) , or a maximum number of transmissions @xmath9 is achieved .",

    "let @xmath11 denote the number of elements in @xmath10 .",
    "we write lowercase letters ( e.g. , @xmath12 ) to denote scalars , bold - face lowercase letters ( e.g. , @xmath13 ) to denote vectors , and @xmath14 to denote the @xmath15-th element of @xmath13 . for any @xmath16",

    "the base of the logarithm is @xmath21 .",
    "the proposed transmission scheme depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig_diagram ] is based on a class of rcp codes with punctures and repetitions .",
    "the coded bits of a rcp code consist of two parts : the first part come from a punctured polar encoder , and these bits are called _ polar bits _ ; the other bits are the selective copies of the information bits and are called _",
    "repetition bits_. hereafter , the rcp code is represented by a three - tuple @xmath22 , @xmath23 , which means this code has an information block length @xmath3 , and the resulting @xmath1-length codeword consists of @xmath24 polar bits and @xmath25 repetition bits .    to construct a @xmath22 rcp code over a bmc @xmath0",
    ", we first need to construct a punctured polar code with code length @xmath24 .",
    "the punctured polar coding is discussed in @xcite .",
    "similar to constructing a conventional polar code , after performing a polarization transform on @xmath26 independent uses of @xmath0 , we get @xmath27 successive uses of synthesized binary input channels @xmath28 , @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the top integral function .    given a symmetric bmc @xmath0 , let @xmath31 denotes the probability density function ( pdf ) of the log - likelihood ratio ( llr ) of the received bit when a bit zero is transmitted .",
    "the reliability of @xmath0 can be measured as the error probability @xmath32 let @xmath33 , @xmath29 denote the llr pdfs of the received bit from @xmath28 when all - zero information bits are transmitted . after calculating @xmath33 by density evolution ( de ) @xcite ,",
    "the reliabilities of @xmath28 are determined by ( [ equ_bitpe ] ) . in transmitting a binary information block of @xmath3 bits ,",
    "the @xmath3 most reliable polarized channels @xmath28 with indices @xmath34 are selected to carry these information bits ; and the others with indices @xmath35 are called frozen channels and are used to transmit a fix sequence , where @xmath36 is the complementary set of @xmath37 .",
    "the index set @xmath37 and its complement set @xmath36 are called the information set and the frozen set , respectively .        different from the conventional polar codes , @xmath38 output bits of the polar encoder should be punctured when constructing a punctured polar code . therefore , before performing the polarization transform , the underlying channel uses corresponding to these punctured positions should be replaced by virtual channels which have the same input and output alphabets as @xmath0 but with zero capacities @xcite . as the performance of the punctured polar codes relies heavily on the specific puncturing pattern ,",
    "an efficient near - optimal puncturing scheme is provided in @xcite .",
    "after the punctured polar code is constructed , some error - prone information bits are duplicated and collected into a sequence of @xmath25 repetition bits .",
    "the repetition bits are directly sent into another @xmath25 uses of @xmath0 , these channel uses are called the _",

    "note that @xmath1 and @xmath4 do _ not _ have to take the same value under this setting .",
    "when constructing a rcp code , the mappings between the repetition channels and the information channels are determined one by one .",

    "thus , the reliability of this information channel is improved and updated .",
    "this procedure continues until all the repetition channels are determined .",

    "the block error rate ( bler ) of an @xmath22 rcp code under sc decoding can be evaluated as @xmath51",
    "the code length of rcp codes can be easily adjusted by adding or reducing the repetition bits .",
