    "current understanding of the formation and evolution of planetary systems in gaseous disks comes from studies of molecular content above or near disk midplanes , which place limits on the composition and density distribution of the gas and dust content in the inner ( r @xmath8 10 au ) planet - forming regions @xcite .",
    "`` transition '' disks refer to a class of ppds with an optically thick outer zone but an inner region significantly depleted of dust grains @xcite and are traditionally identified by the deficiency in near - infrared ( ir ) flux and steep rise of far - ir flux in the observed sed @xcite .",

    "the purple x - points represent all targets with mass accretion rates @xmath51 10@xmath169 @xmath170 yr@xmath20 , while the red diamonds represent the recx targets ( which have low mass accretion rates for primordial ppd targets ) .",
    "the black line is a negative correlation fit through all the purple points , suggesting that the mass accretion rate decreases as r@xmath3 increases .",
    "since the accretion luminosity , more specifically the stellar ly@xmath1 flux produced by the accretion , is directly related to the h@xmath0 emission observed , it is important to note that r@xmath3 is not necessarily correlated to the flux produced by the mass accretion rate .",
    "instead , r@xmath3 is sensitive to the observed emission line width , which is independent of the stellar incident flux.,scaledwidth=48.0% ]    we note that , for all transition disks in this study , r@xmath4 is found to be within the dust gap radius .",
    "one interpretation of this result , paired with the correlation between r@xmath3 and @xmath164 , is that the h@xmath0 fuv radiation observed from the inner ppd atmosphere lags behind the dust disk evolution .",
    "+ this does not automatically mean that the molecular content of the disk is clearing , and we need further evidence of evolution with other inner disk molecular tracers before we can make this distinction .",
    "@xcite outlined the conditions needed in the h@xmath0 disk atmosphere to produce ly@xmath1-pumped h@xmath0 fluorescence .",
    "the opacity of absorbing h@xmath0 in ground - state [ @xmath11,@xmath13 must be large , with excitation temperatures t@xmath171 @xmath51 1500k , and the mass accretion rate ( @xmath172 ) onto the proto - star must be large enough to produce enough ly@xmath1 photons to stimulate the molecules .",
    "the mass accretion rate implies there is a reservoir of material in the inner regions of ppds that feeds onto the proto - star , and a decrease in @xmath172 over time ( e.g. , @xcite ) strongly suggests that the inner disk material is being depleted .",

    "all mass accretion rates are taken from @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : rin_v_mdot ] shows a negative correlation between @xmath172 and r@xmath3(h@xmath0 ) , with spearman rank correlation [ @xmath159,@xmath160 ] = [ -0.80 , 1.9 x 10@xmath161 ] ( not including the recx targets ) , suggesting that the h@xmath0 atmosphere may be physically thinned or in different ground - state populations not suitable for ly@xmath1-pumping in the very inner disk regions of evolved ppds .",
    "the outlier points in figure [ fig : rin_v_mdot ] , recx-11 and recx-15 , appear to have abnormally low mass accretion rates given the evolutionary stage of the disks @xcite , and more targets of varying evolution may be needed to understand if this result is universal among a large sampling of ppds .",
    "it is important to note that r@xmath3 is primarily dervied from the observed line widths of h@xmath0 emission profiles , so determination of r@xmath3 is largely independent of the incident fuv flux .",
    "+ the link between @xmath172 and r@xmath3(h@xmath0 ) suggests that the inner disk is clearing of material as the mass accretion rate declines .",
    "one explanation for this correlation is that the warm h@xmath0 atmosphere dissipates with the small dust grains .",
    "dust grains present in the disk atmospheres of primordial disks may give warm h@xmath0 a formation site to replenish molecules lost to photo - dissociation and stellar accretion ( see @xcite ) . as the dust grains clear out and settle towards the disk midplane or evaporate from the inner disks of evolving ppds , the warm h@xmath0 atmosphere no longer has a formation site to maintain the molecular reservoir . via accretion and photo - dissociative processes with fuv continuum photons between 912 - 1120  , the leftover warm h@xmath0 will continue to disperse , even as the accretion flux decreases .",
    "this leaves an optically thin ( @xmath174 ) path for stellar ly@xmath1 to reach the warm h@xmath0 material at larger disk radii ( r @xmath51 3 au ) .",
    "+ the migration of r@xmath4(h@xmath0 ) with increasing n@xmath5 also suggests that neutral hydrogen ( hi ) is being cleared from the inner disks of transitional ppds .",
    "photo - excitation via stellar ly@xmath1 drives the h@xmath0 fluorescence observed in the disk atmospheres , and as the emitting h@xmath0 is observed further out in the disk , there must be new paths open for stellar uv radiation to reach the outer disk material .",
    "in primordial disks , hi re - processes and scatters incident stellar ly@xmath1 down into the inner disk @xcite while h@xmath0 self - shields the radiation from penetrating to the outer disk , preventing the stellar ly@xmath1 from reaching the outer disk effectively .",
    "if h@xmath0 and hi column densities in the inner disk become optically thin in transitional disks , more stellar ly@xmath1 can irradiate molecular material in the outer disk and may explain the observed correlation between r@xmath4(h@xmath0 ) and n@xmath5 .",
    "this suggests that hi clearing from the inner disk may happen over a similar timescale as the characteristic dust dissipation @xcite and mass accretion quenching @xcite .",
    "this inner - to - outer disk dissipation is in agreement with the uv switch model , which describes the dispersal of inner disk gas cut off from the gas reservoir of the outer disk , due to selective photoevaporation of material out to r @xmath7 5 - 10 au @xcite .",
    "observations of other outer - disk molecules photo - excited by ly@xmath1 radiation provide additional evidence for the loss of hi in the inner disks of transitional objects .",
    "for example , @xcite observe fuv - co fluorescence , also powered by stellar ly@xmath1-pumping , at t@xmath171 @xmath7 500k , in transitional phase objects with an average emission radius r@xmath175 @xmath7 1 - 5 au .",
    "this indicates that less hi and h@xmath0 column is present in the inner disk to shield the stellar ly@xmath1 flux from reaching the cooler co material at intermediate radii in transition systems .",

    "the inner disk emission radii of fuv h@xmath0 and near - ir co appear to be roughly co - spatial , which is a result also found by @xcite when comparing the observed fwhms of fuv h@xmath0 fluorescence emission and near - ir co emission .",
    "an extensive study by @xcite concluded there is a correlation between the near - ir co p(8 ) equivalent width and dust disk dispersal in transitional disks , suggestive of outer radial origins of the co emission as ppd dust evolves .",
    "we have shown that r@xmath177}$ ] increases with n@xmath5 and decreases with @xmath172 , providing further evidence that the inner gas disk environment becomes optically thin as disks evolve towards the transition stage .",
    "+ we note the disk locations of possible theoretical snow lines in ppds and these radii coincide with the h@xmath0 fluorescence in figure [ fig : radial_comparisons ] .",
    "as the disk evolves , it cools over time , so the snow line is expected to migrate inward in the disk as the protostellar system ages @xcite .",
    "several independent studies ( e.g. @xcite ) conclude that the location of the water - ice snow line in ppds are expected to be found within r @xmath7 1 - 3 au for all ppd states .",
    "@xcite shows that the evolution of the water - ice snow line at all stages of ppd evolution ( from ages 10@xmath178 - 10@xmath179 yr ) only varies by @xmath7 0.5 au . observations of h@xmath0o and oh ( which is thought to be a bi - product of h@xmath0o photo - dissociation ) in the near- and mid - ir are also consistent with these condensation radii @xcite . figure [ fig : radial_comparisons ] includes a shaded blue region that represents the assumed generalized h@xmath0o snow line radii in ppds , located between r@xmath180 = 1 - 3 au . with the exception of bp tau and df tau",
    "a , all targets have outer h@xmath0 emission radii that extend to within or outward of the water - ice snow line .",
    "we have created 2d radiative transfer models of fuv h@xmath0 fluorescence emission in ppds and compared them with observations made with _ hst_-cos and stis .",
    "we analyze the radial distribution of h@xmath0 emission produced by parametrized models , which are determined using a reduced-@xmath128 statistic , to understand how the emitting h@xmath0 regions changes as ppd dust disks evolve .",
    "we summarize our findings and interpret the evolutionary behavior of the molecular disk atmosphere as the inner dust disks of ppds disperse :    1 .",
    "the modeled h@xmath0 radial distributions differ between primordial and transitional disks .",
    "primordial disks have the majority of the total h@xmath0 flux arising from the innermost disk radii and less produced outside @xmath7 1 au . for transitional disks , the total h@xmath0 flux migrates to larger disk radii , producing less flux in the innermost disk and more out to r @xmath7 10 au .",
    "we see a positive correlation between the resulting inner and outer emission radii of fuv h@xmath0 ( r@xmath3 and r@xmath4 ) , which supports the result described in conclusion 1 .",
    "this can mean : a ) that the physical structure ( i.e. , temperature ) of the warm molecular disk atmosphere changes as ppds evolve , b ) the warm , ground - state h@xmath0 populations [ @xmath11,@xmath13 change , resulting in evolving regions of the disks where the warm h@xmath0 atmosphere will reprocess the stellar ly@xmath1 radiation field , or c ) h@xmath0 is being destroyed in the inner disk and not re - formed , owing to the lack of dust grains ; the latter point allows stellar ly@xmath1 to penetrate to larger r@xmath4 .",
    "we observe positive correlations between r@xmath3 , r@xmath4 , and n@xmath5 , suggesting that r@xmath3 corresponds with the loss of warm , small dust grains in the innermost disk .",
    "we find a negative correlation between r@xmath3 and @xmath172 , providing evidence that the warm h@xmath0 inner disk atmosphere may be physically thinned or cleared as the ppds evolve , possibly by the loss of a molecular formation site as the dust grains dissipate from the atmosphere .",
    "using the observed dust cavity radii of the transitional disk targets , we compare r@xmath4 to r@xmath143 and find that , for all transition disk targets , r@xmath4 is found inward of r@xmath143 .",
    "this indicates that the warm h@xmath0 disk ( for r @xmath51 r@xmath3 ) remains optically - thick where the warm dust grains are optically - thin in the disks .",
    "this suggests that the physical mechanism that clears or settles the inner disk dust either does not have the same effect on the molecular disk atmosphere , or there is a time lag for the gas disk to respond to the changes observed in the dust distribution .",
    "we examine where the emitting h@xmath0 originates in the disk relative to warm co and the theoretical location of water - ice snow lines .",
    "inner disk co is roughly co - spatial with r@xmath3 for all targets , which could point to the dispersal of the warm molecular disk atmospheres of evolving disk systems . with the exception of a few primordial disk targets",
    ", all targets have emitting h@xmath0 regions that encapsulate the theoretical water - ice snow line .",
    "if disk clearing mechanisms , such as disk photoevaporation via euv / x - ray photons , are primarily responsible for the final dispersal of the gas disk at the end of the ppd lifetime , it is important to examine late - type ppds to monitor molecular disk clearing as transitional disks evolve to debris disks .",
