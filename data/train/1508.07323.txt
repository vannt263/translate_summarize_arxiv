    "a good convergence pattern has been observed for the second and third order particle - particle diagrams with two - nucleon potentials only and when including additionally three - nucleon forces in the form of density - dependent two - body interactions .",
    "moreover , in ref.@xcite the n@xmath4lo three - body and four - body contributions to the energy per particle of isospin - symmetric nuclear matter have been estimated and large effects from the sub - leading chiral three - nucleon force have been found together with small corrections from the leading - order chiral four - nucleon interactions .    an analytical calculation of chiral four - body interactions in nuclear matter and pure neutron matter has been performed recently in ref.@xcite .",

    "irreducible  four - nucleon interaction turned out to be very small , with values below @xmath8mev for densities @xmath9@xmath10 .",
    "however , when including the @xmath11-isobar as an explicit degree of freedom and counting the delta - nucleon mass splitting @xmath12mev as a small scale ( comparable to the pion mass @xmath13 or the fermi momentum @xmath14 ) a new class of leading - order long - range four - nucleon interactions arises .",
    "these are mediated by two - fold @xmath11-isobar excitation of nucleons and the exchange of three pions .",
    "the analytical calculation of the pertinent 3-ring , 2-ring , and 1-ring diagrams at four - loop order has lead to a moderately repulsive contribution of @xmath15mev at nuclear matter saturation density @xmath16@xmath10 .",
    "however , the curve for @xmath17 rises strongly with the density , reaching about 10 times that value at @xmath18 . in the case of pure neutron matter",

    "the complete set of leading - order four - nucleon interactions in chiral effective field theory has been constructed by epelbaum in refs.@xcite using the method of unitary transformations .",
    "this method allows to project the dynamics of the interacting pion - nucleon system into the purely nucleonic subspace relevant for few - nucleon systems at energies below the pion - production threshold .",
    "in addition to the  irreducible  chiral four - nucleon interaction mentioned above , which follows ( via the feynman diagram technique ) directly from the vertices of the chiral lagrangian @xmath19 , the method of unitary transformations gives rise to eight classes of  reducible  four - nucleon diagrams .",
    "in ref.@xcite it is shown that disconnected diagrams always lead to vanishing @xmath20-forces and with the kinematically suppressed pion - energies at a weinberg - tomozawa @xmath21-vertex one obtains that actually three classes ( iii , vi , and viii ) vanish at leading order .",
    "the nonvanishing @xmath20-interactions , grouped into the classes i , ii , iv , v , and vii , involve multiple pion - exchanges and a spin - spin contact - interaction with coupling constant @xmath22 .",
    "the associated isoscalar central @xmath23-contact term proportional @xmath24 is absent because it drops out of the commutators arising in the construction of the reducible @xmath20-interaction .",
    "note that the `` irreducible '' four - nucleon interaction , which constitutes a part of class ii , is called @xmath25 in ref.@xcite .",
    "moreover , one finds that in an anti - symmetrized four - neutron state only the ( diagonal ) matrix - element of @xmath26 ( class i ) is nonvanishing and an explicit expression has been given for it in eq.(a14 ) of ref.@xcite .",
    "analogous expressions for the four - nucleon matrix - elements of the other classes have so far not been published .",
    "the purpose present paper is to evaluate analytically the five classes ( vii , v , iv , ii , i ) of reducible chiral four - nucleon interactions ( @xmath27 in the notation of ref.@xcite ) in isospin - symmetric nuclear matter and pure neutron matter . in order to facilitate a uniform treatment",
    "we will first introduce in section2 a general representation of @xmath20-interactions in terms of a product of four ( effective ) single - nucleon vertices and three  propagator-factors .",

    "the first - order  hartree - fock  contribution to the energy density of nuclear matter is obtained from the connected four - body diagram by closing its four nucleon - lines in all possible ways .",
    "the actually occurring chiral vertices have the convenient property that closing any nucleon - line to itself leads to a vanishing spin - trace or isospin - trace .",
    "therefore , one needs to consider here only the closed 2-ring and 1-ring diagrams generated by the reducible chiral @xmath20-interactions .",
    "these four - loop diagrams are then evaluated individually for the five different classes ( in the order vii , v , iv , ii , i ) in the subsections 2.1 up to 2.5 . in most cases",
    "the occurring integral over the product of four fermi spheres of radius @xmath14 can be reduced to an easily manageable one- or two - parameter integral , that depends on the dimensionless ratio @xmath28 .",
    "the 1-ring diagrams with crossed pion - exchanges related to class ii and i allow only for a partial analytical reduction , such that six - parameter integrals remain .",
    "the numerical results for the energy per particle @xmath17 as a function of the nucleon density @xmath29 are presented and discussed in section 3 .",
    "we consider two opposite values of the spin - spin contact - coupling , @xmath30@xmath31 and @xmath32@xmath31 , taken from table i in ref.@xcite .",

    "is determined entirely by a 2-ring diagram , since the three types of 1-ring diagrams compensate each other almost completely .",
    "the corresponding attractive energy per particle goes approximately as @xmath37 and it reaches a value of about @xmath38mev at @xmath39@xmath10 .    in summary one finds that the chiral four - nucleon correlations studied in this work are at least one order of magnitude smaller than those provided by the strongly coupled @xmath40-system @xcite with its small mass - gap of @xmath41mev .",
    "in this section we derive analytical expressions for the first - order contributions to the energy per particle of nuclear matter as they arise from the reducible chiral four - nucleon interactions of ref.@xcite . in order to facilitate a uniform treatment of the five different classes ( vii , v , iv , ii , i ) we introduce first a generic representation of @xmath20-interactions in terms of a product of four ( effective ) single - nucleon vertices and three  propagator-factors .",

    "interestingly , the net result for @xmath36 is thus entirely determined by the 2-ring part written in eq.(21 ) .",
    "the corresponding attractive energy per particle goes approximately as @xmath37 and it reaches the value of about @xmath38mev at the ( relatively high ) neutron density of @xmath135@xmath10 .",
    "in passing we note that our numerical results for the chiral four - body correlations in nuclear and neutron matter agree perfectly @xcite with those of the darmstadt group @xcite if the ( unessential ) regulator - function @xmath136 is set to @xmath137 .    in summary",
    "one can conclude that the chiral four - nucleon correlations studied in this work are at least one order of magnitude smaller than those provided by the strongly coupled @xmath40-system @xcite with its small mass - gap of @xmath41mev@xmath138 .",
