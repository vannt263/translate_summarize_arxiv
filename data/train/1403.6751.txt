    "low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) consist of a neutron star ( ns ) or black hole ( bh ) accreting from a low - mass ( @xmath6 ) stellar companion via roche - lobe overflow .",
    "they may be divided into two categories : persistent accretors with x - ray luminosity @xmath710@xmath8  erg  s@xmath2 , and transient systems .",
    "transient lmxbs undergo recurrent bright ( @xmath710@xmath8  erg  s@xmath2 ) outbursts lasting days to weeks and then return to long intervals of x - ray quiescence ( @xmath910@xmath10  erg  s@xmath2 ) lasting months to years .",
    "the long - term average mass accretion rate of the transients is thus substantially lower than in the persistent systems , owing to their low duty cycle .",
    "transient behavior is understood to arise from a thermal instability in the outer accretion disk wherein the viscosity ( and thus the mass accretion rate @xmath11 through the disk ) jumps to a higher value when a critical surface density is reached as the disk fills up ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "the persistent lmxbs avoid this instability because their higher accretion rates lead to increased x - ray heating , keeping the disks permanently ionized @xcite .    for the ns systems , the 0.510 kev x - ray spectrum of quiescent lmxb transients typically consists of two components : a low - energy ( `` soft '' ) @xmath120.1  kev thermal component , and a high - energy ( `` hard '' ) power - law component with photon index @xmath13 , where photon flux @xmath14 .",
    "the soft component is generally well fit by a hydrogen atmosphere model for the ns .",
    "the leading explanation for the energy source of the soft component is a deep crustal heating model @xcite in which the emission is powered by heat injected into the ns crust by pycnonuclear reactions driven by accretion during transient outbursts . in this model ,",
    "the contribution of quiescent accretion is negligible .",
    "x - ray spectroscopy of soft thermal emission in quiescent ns transients has been used to infer ns radii @xcite and to study the thermal relaxation of ns crusts ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "however , a possible problem for such studies is that accretion may not have completely shut off during quiescence , as suggested by the detection of quiescent variability in the two brightest quiescent ns / lmxbs , aql x-1 @xcite and cen x-4 @xcite .",
    "there has been considerable debate as to whether this variability is primarily in the soft thermal component , the hard power - law component , or both ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the origin of the hard power - law tail is unclear .",
    "it is not predicted by the deep crustal heating model @xcite .",
    "two explanations have been discussed : synchrotron shock emission from a radio pulsar wind and comptonization of the soft thermal photons by a hot corona @xcite .",
    "the synchrotron model is of particular interest given the recent confirmation that ns / lmxbs can turn on as radio pulsars at low accretion rates @xcite .",
    "a difficulty in discriminating between different models has been the absence of knowledge about how high the power - law component extends in energy , owing to lack of sufficient observational sensitivity above 10  kev .",
    "the recent launch of the _ nustar _ hard x - ray telescope provides the first opportunity to explore this question .",
    "the ideal target with which to address this is cen x-4 = x1455@xmath5314 ( galactic coordinates @xmath15 , @xmath16 ) , the brightest quiescent ns / lmxb . it was discovered in 1969 in the 312  kev band with the _",
    "vela 5a/5b _ satellites during an extremely bright ( @xmath1220 crab at peak ) x - ray outburst lasting over two months @xcite .",
    "a second bright ( @xmath124 crab at peak ) x - ray outburst was detected in 1979 @xcite along with counterparts in the optical @xcite and radio @xcite , but the source has been in x - ray quiescence ( @xmath17 fainter ) ever since .",
    "bright x - ray flashes , now understood as thermonuclear ( type i ) x - ray bursts , were observed around the time of both the 1969 and 1979 outbursts @xcite , conclusively establishing the source as a ns and setting an upper limit on the distance of 1.2@xmath180.3  kpc @xcite .",
    "a third burst may have been observed by the _ apollo 15 _ lunar mission in 1971 @xcite .",
    "the presence of thermonuclear bursts indicates that the surface dipole magnetic field is weak , with @xmath19  g @xcite and most likely @xmath20  g ( by analogy with other type i bursters ) .",
    "optical photometry and spectroscopy indicate that the binary companion v822  cen is a k3 - 7 v dwarf , the binary period is 15.1  hr , and the binary mass ratio is @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "the best - fit ns mass is @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "given the proximity and high galactic latitude of the source , it has extremely low interstellar extinction and absorption , allowing more sensitive observations in the ultraviolet and soft x - ray bands than usually possible for lmxbs @xcite .",
    "the integrated values along this line of sight are @xmath23 @xcite and @xmath24  @xmath25 @xcite .",

    "the data were processed and screened using the standard pipeline for on - axis point sources in the _ nustar _ data analysis system ( nustardas ) version 1.2.0 , along with the _ nustar _ calibration database ( caldb ) version 20130509 .",
    "light curves and spectra from both fpma and fpmb were extracted from a circular region centered on the source position with a radius of 75 arcsec .    a detailed background model for the source position in each of the two telescopes was derived by using the nuskybgd tool @xcite to fit blank sky regions covering the entire field of view for each focal plane .",
    "for faint point sources like cen x-4 , this is more accurate than the usual method of simply scaling from the background of a nearby blank sky region because it correctly accounts for the highly non - uniform background gradients across the detectors . in both telescopes ,",

    "the net exposure time was 27ks for epic - pn and 30ks for each of the epic - mos units .",
    "for all three detectors , we initially extracted light curves and spectra from a circular region centered on the source position with a radius of 43.5 arcsec . for the mos detectors , we measured the background using a square blank - sky region 3@xmath263 arcmin in size .",
    "for the epic - pn detector , an important consideration is that the outer parts of the field - of - view include photons due to cu fluorescence in the instrument while the inner parts do not . as cen",

    "these count rates are higher than the those observed in previous _ xmm - newton _ observations @xcite . in fact , the count rates in both the epic - mos and epic - pn detectors are close to the threshold where photon pileup effects may begin to distort the measured spectra , particularly during the flares .",

    "the compton cooling time scale is @xmath253 . for emission above the ns atmosphere , this yields @xmath254 so the cooling is nearly instantaneous . for this scenario",
    ", we might expect to measure spectral changes in the _ nustar _ band ( @xmath14010  kev ) during the flares , although we did not have sufficient signal - to - noise to do this with our observation .",
    "by contrast , emission in the riaf gives @xmath255 so that in this case short - term flaring behavior will not result in significant compton cooling of the bremsstrahlung electrons in the riaf flow .",
    "this might provide an avenue for discriminating between the two scenarios .    on longer time scales ( months to years ) , the fact that the slope of the hard x - ray power - law spectrum in cen x-4 was observed to vary from epoch to epoch over the course of two decades @xcite makes it unlikely that the 18  kev bremsstrahlung spectrum we have measured is a constant feature of the source in quiescence .",
    "in fact , we can demonstrate that the hard x - ray cutoff energy in cen x-4 is likely variable by noting that the departure of the hard x - ray spectrum from an unbroken power - law above @xmath36  kev is evident in our 2013 _ xmm - newton _ spectrum alone , even without including the _ nustar _ data .",

    "this relationship will eventually break down when @xmath4 gets sufficiently low , because an unbroken power - law no longer provides even a rough fit to a sharp spectral cutoff .",
    "the archival data roughly support this picture for @xmath257 erg  s@xmath2 . in figure  [ fig_gamma",
    "] , we plot @xmath59 versus @xmath256 for deep quiescent observations of cen x-4 made since 1994 , including our observation values found by @xcite for these observations are much smaller than for any other observations , as would be expected if there is significant pileup .",
    "we will reexamine these data elsewhere . ] .",
    "these observations are listed in table  [ tbl-3 ] ; the archival spectra are collected from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the trend of the observations in figure  [ fig_gamma ] with @xmath257 erg  s@xmath2 is roughly consistent with our expectation for a compton - cooled bremsstrahlung model .",
    "at the lowest thermal lumnosities , however , @xmath59 jumps to higher values .",
    "the abrupt change is suggestive of a spectral transition to a different emission mechanism .",
    "given the extremely low luminosities , one might consider coronal x - ray emission from the companion star @xcite , but the observed spectral shapes for these observations were not consistent with coronal emission @xcite .",
    "instead , we suggest that this may indicate a transition to synchrotron shock emission at the lowest luminosities .",
    "we discuss this further in  [ sec - comps ] .      as in most quiescent transient ns / lmxbs ,",
    "a basic requirement for cen x-4 is that most of the accretion flow does not reach the ns , since the inferred @xmath81 is substantially smaller than the binary mass transfer rate @xmath260 expected for a roche - lobe  filing main sequence donor in a 15.1  hr binary ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    ". there may be several mechanisms that contribute to this .",
    "first of all , the disk instability model for lmxb transients predicts that most of the accretion flow during x - ray quiescence builds up in the outer accretion disk until a thermal instability ensues , causing an outburst ( see * ? ? ? * ) . at low @xmath11 , the outer disk will transition into a quasi - spherical riaf flow at @xmath261 .",
    "it has previously been noted that riaf models for quiescent ns transients require that most of the riaf flow is somehow prevented from reaching the ns @xcite .",
    "one way of achieving this is the adios - like outflow that we discussed in  [ sec - bremss2 ] .",
    "another possibility is that most of the flow reaching the ns magnetosphere is centrifugally inhibited by the magnetic `` propeller effect '' @xcite .",
    "this occurs when the magnetosphere extends beyond the corotation radius ( see equation  [ [ eq_corot ] ] ) we define the magnetospheric radius @xmath101 as the location where the magnetic and material stresses are equal , @xmath262 where @xmath263 is the magnetic dipole moment of the ns , @xmath264 is an order unity constant that depends upon the details of the accretion flow near the magnetosphere ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the usual @xmath265 scaling is modified by the @xmath36-dependence of @xmath266 . in the propeller regime , @xmath267 . for ordinary thin - disk magnetic accretion , the disk extends to the magnetosphere , and the accretion is entirely shut off in this regime .",
    "however for a riaf flow onto a millisecond pulsar , @xmath101 will generally lie inside the transition radius @xmath261 , so that the flow onto the magnetosphere will be quasi - spherical . in this geometry ,",
    "a small fraction of the flow is able to reach the ns despite the centrifugal barrier present in the propeller regime @xcite . whether material is expelled in a strong or weak outflow , or else accumulates outside @xmath104 ( e.g. , a `` dead '' disk ) ,",
    "depends upon details of the disk - magnetosphere interaction @xcite .",
    "however , observationally , @xcite have shown that a strong propeller outflow can likely be ruled out in cen x-4 .",
    "our observations support the conclusion of @xcite that low - level accretion is occurring during x - ray quiescence in cen x-4 , indicating that a small fraction of the accretion flow must eventually reach the ns .",
    "however , it remains unclear what combination of the above mechanisms ultimately controls what that fraction is .",
    "after cen x-4 , the next brightest well - studied quiescent ns / lmxb transient is aql x-1 . unlike cen x-4 , aql x-1 has a relatively short recurrence time scale of 12  yr . there have been several recent studies of its quiescent emission @xcite , all observing a soft thermal component and hard power - law component with no cutoff .",
    "@xcite argue that , for their 2007 _ suzaku _ observations ( @xmath268[39]@xmath269 for an assumed distance of 5.2  kpc ) , the most appropriate model for the hard component is comptonization in either an optically thin ( @xmath270 ) , very hot ( @xmath271  kev ) corona or an optically thick ( @xmath272 ) , somewhat cooler ( @xmath273  kev ) corona .",
    "they do not find the same inconsistency between their measured @xmath64 and radially uniform accretion that we found in equation  ( [ eq_tau ] ) .",
    "this is a consequence of their @xmath11 being higher and their @xmath64 being lower than in our cen x-4 observation .",
    "however , we noted in  [ sec - compt ] that @xmath274 and @xmath4 vary inversely , and the high @xmath4 values ( and corresponding cutoff energies ) that @xcite fit lie above their observation bandpass .",
    "the _ suzaku _",
    "data are thus unable to rule out the presence of a cutoff below 50100  kev ( but still above their bandpass ) ; this would introduce the same difficulties for a comptonization model that we found in cen x-4 , although it would be somewhat mitigated by the higher @xmath11 .",
    "we note that our bremsstrahlung model could explain the hard component in aql  x-1 for @xmath275  kev .",
    "it is interesting to also compare the behavior of cen x-4 with systems that have been observed to transition between lmxb and radio pulsar states during x - ray quiescence .",
    "the theoretical expectation is that such transitions are controlled by location of the ns magnetospheric boundary @xcite .",
    "we can compare @xmath101 to both @xmath104 and the light - cylinder radius , @xmath276 for sufficiently low @xmath11 , we have @xmath277 and the system will be in the propeller regime , with accretion onto the ns ( mostly ) shut off @xcite . for even lower @xmath278 , we will have @xmath279 . in this case",
    ", the radio pulsar mechanism can turn on , with the radiation pressure of a radio pulsar wind clearing the magnetosphere and an intrabinary shock giving rise to synchrotron x - ray emission @xcite .",
    "the @xmath11 implied for transition to a millisecond radio pulsar state corresponds to @xmath280  erg  s , where the exact value depends on details of the system and the disk - magnetosphere interaction .",
    "indirect evidence for such transitions in ns / lmxbs during x - ray quiescence was previously reported in aql  x-1 ( @xmath281 erg  s@xmath2 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and sax  j1808.4@xmath53658 ( @xmath282 * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , more direct evidence has been reported more recently in at least three systems . the 1.7  ms radio pulsar psr j1023",
    "+ 0038 ( hereafter j1023 ) has made two transitions between the lmxb and radio pulsar states .",
    "it is now understood to have been in an lmxb state during 20002001 , with direct optical evidence for the presence of an accretion disk @xcite .",
    "however , a state transition then occurred , with subsequent observations establishing the absence of an accretion disk during 20022013 @xcite as well as the presence of a millisecond eclipsing radio pulsar during 20072013 @xcite , along with a low x - ray luminosity associated with intrabinary synchrotron shock emission @xcite .",
    "a second state transition was observed more recently , with the radio pulsar turning off and an accretion disk reemerging @xcite .    in all of these observations",
    ", j1023 has remained in x - ray quiescence in the sense that a high - luminosity ( @xmath283  erg  s@xmath2 ) transient x - ray outburst was not observed .",
    "however , two distinct sub - states are evident : a faint x - ray  quiescent state ( @xmath284 erg  s@xmath2 ) during which radio pulsations are seen , and a bright x - ray  quiescent state ( @xmath285 erg  s@xmath2 ) during which the radio pulsar is off .",
    "this suggests that @xmath101 has moved outside the light cylinder in the fainter state . in both sub - states ,",
    "the 0.310  kev x - ray emission has a power - law spectrum with little or no thermal component , with @xmath286 in the faint state @xcite and @xmath287 in the bright state @xcite .",
    "_ nustar _ observations show that these power - law spectra remain unbroken up to at least 79  kev @xcite . during faint x - ray  quiescence",
    ", the x - ray flux shows high - amplitude modulation at the orbital period @xcite , similar to what is seen in the x - ray emission from some ( but not all ) eclipsing millisecond radio pulsars ( the so - called  black widow  and  redback  systems ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . during bright x - ray  quiescence ,",
    "the x - ray flux shows strong , rapid flickering , with the intensity varying by an order of magnitude on time scales @xmath0100  s @xcite .",
    "a second object in which two lmxb / radio pulsar state transitions were seen is the m28 globular cluster source psr j1824@xmath52452i ( hereafter m28i ) , a 3.9  ms radio pulsar .",
    "the radio pulsar underwent a bright transient x - ray outburst ( @xmath288 erg  s@xmath2 ) in 2013 march during which accretion - powered millisecond pulsations and a thermonuclear x - ray burst were observed , establishing the system as an ns / lmxb .",
    "the system returned to x - ray quiescence within a month , at which point radio pulsations were again detected @xcite .",
    "these observations demonstrate that lmxb / radio pulsar state transitions can occur on time scales as short as days . during x - ray quiescence ,",
    "rapid ( @xmath31500  s ) intensity variations of nearly an order of magnitude are again seen [ ( 0.64)@xmath289 erg  s@xmath2 ] , with no change in the 0.310  kev x - ray spectrum : an absorbed power - law with @xmath291 and no detectable thermal component @xcite .",
    "remarkably , this rapid variability seems to toggle between two stable flux levels ; @xcite suggest that this represents fast transitions between synchrotron shock emission and magnetospheric accretion .",
    "no orbital variability of the x - ray flux is reported in m28i .",
    "the third object in which an lmxb / radio pulsar transition was seen is xss  j12270@xmath54859 ( hereafter j12270 ) , a faint hard x - ray source associated with a relatively bright _ fermi _ @xmath292-ray source . during 20032012 ,",
    "the source was in a quiescent lmxb state with an absorbed power - law x - ray spectrum with @xmath293 , no evidence for a thermal spectral component , a 0.110  kev luminosity of @xmath294  erg  s@xmath2 , highly variable x - ray flaring , and multiwavelength evidence for the presence of an accretion disk @xcite . in late 2012 , the source made a transition to a lower ( @xmath295  erg  s@xmath2 ) luminosity state with a power - law x - ray spectrum with @xmath291 , a thermal fraction @xmath09% , and a large - amplitude orbital modulation of the x - ray flux @xcite .",
    "after this transition , 1.69  ms radio pulsations were also detected @xcite .",
    "cen x-4 has comparable luminosity to j1023 , m28i , and j12270 , and so it is presumably at least close to the regime where lmxb / radio transitions could occur . the rapid x - ray variability we observe ( see  3.1 ) is quite different from the large - amplitude orbital modulation seen in the low - quiescent state of j1023 , but it is qualitatively similar to ( although somewhat weaker than ) the flickering seen in the high - quiescent states of j1023 and j12270 as well as the m28i quiescent variability . on the other hand , unlike those three sources , the x - ray spectrum of cen x-4 has a substantial thermal fraction ( @xmath360% )",
    "this may indicate that more of the accretion flow reaches the surface of cen x-4 than in the other systems .",
    "if we apply our cen x-4 compton - cooled bremsstrahlung model to the hard x - ray emission in j1023 , m28i , and j12270 during their radio - quiet / x - ray quiescent states , then we would expect a high ( 50100  kev ) electron temperature and an unbroken 210  kev power - law x - ray spectrum , consistent with what was observed .",
    "of course , synchrotron shock emission can also produce an unbroken power - law in the x - ray band , and we expect this mechanism to dominate in the radio pulsar state . at sufficiently low luminosity , cen x-4 should transition into a radio pulsar state ; we suggest that this may be what occurs at @xmath296 erg  s@xmath2 in figure  [ fig_gamma ] , and that the jump in @xmath59 might reflect a sharp transition from high - temperature bremsstrahlung emission to synchrotron shock emission .",
    "this is consistent with the suggestion by @xcite that the power - law component in quiescent ns / lmxbs arises from accretion at higher @xmath11 and from some a different , non - accretion mechanism ( e.g. , synchroton shock emission ) at lower @xmath11 ; they used this to explain how the fractional power - law contribution to the quiescent luminosity varies with @xmath278 in quiescent ns / lmxbs .",
    "it would be interesting to search for millisecond radio pulsations from cen x-4 when its x - ray luminosity next drops to @xmath297  erg  s@xmath2 .",

    "<S> the low - mass x - ray binary cen x-4 is the brightest and closest ( @xmath01.2 kpc ) quiescent neutron star transient . </S>",
    "<S> previous 0.510  kev x - ray observations of cen x-4 in quiescence identified two spectral components : soft thermal emission from the neutron star atmosphere and a hard power - law tail of unknown origin . </S>",
    "<S> we report here on a simultaneous observation of cen x-4 with _ nustar _ </S>",
    "<S> ( 379 kev ) and _ xmm - newton _ ( 0.310 kev ) in 2013 january , providing the first sensitive hard x - ray spectrum of a quiescent neutron star transient . </S>",
    "<S> the 0.379  kev luminosity was @xmath1  erg  s@xmath2 , with @xmath360% in the thermal component . </S>",
    "<S> we clearly detect a cutoff of the hard spectral tail above 10 kev , the first time such a feature has been detected in this source class . </S>",
    "<S> we show that thermal comptonization and synchrotron shock origins for the hard x - ray emission are ruled out on physical grounds . </S>",
    "<S> however , the hard x - ray spectrum is well fit by a thermal bremsstrahlung model with @xmath4=18  kev , which can be understood as arising either in a hot layer above the neutron star atmosphere or in a radiatively - inefficient accretion flow ( riaf ) . </S>",
    "<S> the power - law cutoff energy may be set by the degree of compton cooling of the bremsstrahlung electrons by thermal seed photons from the neutron star surface . </S>",
    "<S> lower thermal luminosities should lead to higher ( possibly undetectable ) cutoff energies . </S>",
    "<S> we compare cen  x-4 s behavior with the psr  j1023 + 0038 , igr  j18245@xmath52452 , and xss  j12270@xmath54859 , which have shown transitions between lmxb and radio pulsar modes at a similar x - ray luminosity . </S>"
