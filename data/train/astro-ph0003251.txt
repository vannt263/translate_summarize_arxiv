    "public data of _ cgro_/batse and _ rxte_/asm ( all sky monitor ) revealed that both the hard and the soft x - ray intensities of the source showed two outbursts as shown in figure [ fig : initial ] .",

    "the spin - up rate shows a positive correlation with the flux , which is similar to other transient x - ray pulsars .",

    "are located in the galactic plane whereas xte  j0111.27317 is located in the direction of the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) , i.e. at high galactic lattitude ( @xmath9 ) , it is very likely that xte  j0111.27317 lies in the smc .",
    "a candidate for the optical counterpart was detected in the _ asca _ error circle , and was found to be emitting strong h@xmath10 and h@xmath11 lines ( israel et al .",
    "1999 ; coe et al .",

    "the _ asca _ observation of the source was made to study the pulsations and the soft x - ray spectrum extending upto 10  kev . though the _ asca _ observation happened to coincide with the quiescent period between the two outbursts ( figure [ fig : initial ] ) , the source was bright enough for us to make a detailed study of its energy spectrum .",
    "we present here results of our temporal and spectral study of this source made with the _ asca _ data .",
    "the principal result from this study is discovery of a soft excess in the spectrum which is modeled as an `` inversely broken power - law model . '' in the following sections , we present the details of the observation and the temporal and spectral analysis , and discuss the results suggesting that this source is a be / x - ray binary .",
    "the observation of the new transient x - ray pulsar xte  j0111.27317 in the smc region was made between 1998 november 18.73 ut and november 19.65 ut with two solid - state imaging spectrometers ( sis ) and two gas imaging spectrometers ( gis ) of _ asca_. the sis ccds were operated in 1-ccd faint / bright mode with time resolution of 4  s , and the gis detectors were operated in normal ph mode which has higher time resolution of 62.5 ms . for details about _ asca _ itself , its x - ray telescope ( xrt ) , and the focal plane instruments sis and gis , please refer to tanaka , inoue , & holt ( 1994 ) , serlemitsos et al .",

    "( 1994 ) , and ohashi et al .",
    "the observation resulted in 19.8 ks and 25.7 ks of useful exposures with the sis and gis detectors respectively .",
    "average source count rates in the four _ asca _ detectors are 3.5 ( sis0 ) , 2.7 ( sis1 ) , 1.7 ( gis2 ) , and 2.3 ( gis3 ) per second .",

    "1998b ) .",
    "all data were collected when the satellite was outside the south atlantic anomaly region and deviation from nominal pointing was less than 001 .",
    "we have used the standard data reduction criteria of the _ asca _ guest observer facility by applying minimum cut - off rigidity of 6/4 gev/@xmath17 and minimum elevation angle of 10@xmath18/5@xmath18 for sis / gis , respectively .",
    "minimum angle from the bright earth s limb of 20@xmath18 was also applied for the sis data .",
    "data from the hot and flickering pixels of the sis detectors were removed .",

    "the count rates and spectra of the source were obtained from circular regions of @xmath19 diameter for the gis detectors and @xmath20 diameter for the sis detectors , and the background data were obtained from sections of the rest of the field of view .      to study the temporal properties , we have produced light curves from the two gis detectors with 0.5  s time resolution .",
    "arrival times of the photons were corrected to the solar system barycenter .",
    "data from the two detectors were added and a power spectrum was generated .",
    "pulsations were detected unambiguously with a barycentric period of 30.9497 @xmath21 0.0004  s. the pulse profile is predominantly sinusoidal with indication of one additional peak .",
    "we also have generated pulse profiles in three different energy bands of 0.72.0 , 2.05.0 , and 5.010.0  kev .",
    "the pulse profiles in these energy bands plotted in figure [ fig : pp ] show slight differences in shape and larger modulation at higher energy .",
    "the pulsed fraction , defined as the ratio of the pulsed intensity to the total intensity in the entire energy band of 0.710.0  kev , is found to be 25% and 29% with the sis and gis , respectively .",
    "the pulsed fractions in different smaller energy bands with the sis and gis are 17% and 24% in 0.72.0  kev range , 27% and 30% in 2.05.0  kev range , and 28% and 31% in 5.010.0  kev range , respectively .",
    "the error of the pulsed fraction is estimated to be @xmath222% in each band .",
    "the difference in the pulsed fraction between sis and gis would be mainly due to the fact that the pulsed fraction is larger at higher energy and the relative detection efficiency of gis to sis increases with energy .",
    "the poorer time resolution of sis may also be responsible for the difference of pulsed fraction .",
    "the smaller pulsed fraction at lower energy suggests spectral hardening during the pulse peak .",
    "we also searched for variation of a time scale from @xmath23 to @xmath24 in the light curve , but no significant variation was found .",
    "after appropriate background subtraction , spectra from the two pairs of sis and gis detectors were combined and the two resultant spectra were fitted simultaneously with slightly different normalizations for the sis and gis .",
    "the energy ranges chosen for spectral fitting are 0.5510.0  kev for the sis and 0.710.0  kev for the gis .",
    "we first applied several conventional single - component models , such as a simple power - law , a broken power - law , and a power - law with exponential cutoff , with a neutral absorber .",
    "we found that these models were inadequate to represent the spectra well : reduced @xmath25 was @xmath26 for @xmath27 degrees of freedom , because the residuals to the model fit showed presence of a soft excess below @xmath6  kev and indication of an emission line around 6.4  kev .",
    "we also found that the _ asca _ bandpass does not extend high enough ( 2030  kev ) to detect the type of spectral break observed in most x - ray pulsars .",
    "the emission - line feature was well described by a narrow gaussian centered at 6.4  kev .",
    "the continuum shape including the soft excess could be represented by an `` inversely broken power - law , '' which is a broken power - law with a larger / smaller photon index ( @xmath28 ) below / above a break energy @xmath29 .",

    "we found that two - component models constructed with a hard power - law ( @xmath41 ) and a soft component such as a blackbody or a bremsstrahlung , which is dominant only below 2  kev , could give almost the same fit for the spectra .",
    "however , these models require a very large emission region for the soft component .",
    "if , in the power - law plus blackbody model , the soft component is assumed to be isotropic blackbody emission from a spherical surface , the corresponding radius is estimated to be @xmath42 km , which is much larger than the neutron star surface area . in the power - law plus bremsstrahlung model , on the other hand , the emission measure is very high ( @xmath43  @xmath44 ) . taking account of the pulsed fraction below and above 2  kev ( @xmath45% and 30% respectively ) , and the fact that the soft component in these models is responsible for @xmath46% of emission below 2  kev",
    ", we conclude that the soft component should be pulsating .",
    "in fact , we extracted on - pulse and off - pulse spectra from phase 00.5 and 0.51 , respectively , and fitted them with the two - component models mentioned above .",
    "the fitting result indicated that the pulsed fraction of the soft compoent in 0.72.0  kev band is at least 1015% .",
    "the large emission region of the soft component could not explain the pulsation , thus we rejected these two - component models .    another two - component model constructed with two power - laws and",
    "a common absorption also gave a statistically identical fit .",
    "in this model , however , the soft power - law is very steep ( @xmath47 ) and hence the absorption column density became large ( @xmath48  h  @xmath1 ) .",
    "this requires a deep absorption edge at around 0.6  kev which is inconsistent with the sis spectrum , thus we rejected this model .",
    "the multiband pulse profiles as shown in figure [ fig : pp ] indicate a slight energy dependence in their amplitude and shape . to investigate this in detail ,",
    "we have carried out pulse phase resolved spectroscopy .",
    "we divided the entire pulse phase into four smaller phases describing the minimum , rising , maximum , and decaying part of the profile , respectively , as shown in the bottom panel of figure [ fig : pp ] .",
    "we fitted the phase - resolved spectra with the same model , and a summary of the result is given in table 1 .",
    "the photon indices are marginally smaller during the pulse maximum , in accordance with the energy dependence of the pulsed fraction and the pulse shape in figure [ fig : pp ] .",
    "the iron line equivalent width does not indicate a strong pulse phase dependence . on the other hand",
    ", the iron line normalization probably indicates an increase during the pulse maximum .",
    "the break energy and the column density of neutral absorber does not indicate a phase dependence .",
    "recently there has been a significant increase in the discovery of different types of x - ray pulsars owing to good sky coverage of the _ cgro_/batse and _",
    "rxte_/asm for transient sources , _ asca _ survey of the galactic ridge , and extensive observations with the _ rosat _ and _ bepposax_. the first millisecond pulsar sax j1808.43658 showing type - i bursts has been the most remarkable discovery ( wijnands & van der klis 1998 ; chakrabarty & morgan 1998 ) .",
    "the other newly discovered pulsars include a pulsar with type - ii bursts , pulsars in sgrs ( magnetars ) , pulsars in snrs , anomalous 6-s pulsars and many transient pulsars , most of which include a high mass companion .",
    "this has improved the sample of x - ray pulsars by about 40% in the last 23 years ( nagase 1999 ) .",
    "the present source xte  j0111.27317 is one in a series of new x - ray pulsars discovered in the magellanic clouds ( summarized in yokogawa et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "the x - ray continuum spectra of accreting pulsars are often phenomenologically described to be a broken power - law type or a power - law type with exponential cutoff ( white et al .",
    "the break in the spectrum for most sources is in the range of 1020  kev and the power - law photon index below the break energy is in the range of 12 .",
    "however , binary x - ray pulsars which are away from the galactic plane and therefore experience less interstellar absorption , show the presence of a soft component in the spectrum which has been often described as a blackbody and/or thermal bremsstrahlung emission ( smc x-1 , woo et al .",
    "1995 , wojdowski et al . 1998",
    "; lmc x-4 , woo et al .",
    "1996 ; rx  j0059.27138 , kohno , yokogawa , & koyama 2000 ; 4u 162667 , orlandini et al .",
    "1998 ) . a thermal soft component in 4u 162667",
    "requires the size of emission region to be comparable to that of the neutron star , because the intrinsic luminosity of this source is of the order of 10@xmath49 erg s@xmath2 .",
    "but for the pulsars in the magellanic clouds for which the distance is of the order of 5060 kpc ( and the luminosity is close to the eddington value ) , a soft component will require an emission region which is a few orders of magnitude larger than the size of the neutron star . the bremsstrahlung component in lmc x-4 , which is dominant in the intermediate energy range of 0.51.5  kev , is also found to be pulsating ( woo et al .",
    "the pulsating nature of the soft component at least in xte  j0111.27317 , lmc x-4 , and smc x-1 is difficult to explain if a thermal origin is assumed for the low energy part of the spectrum .",
    "the inversely broken power - law model that we have proposed for xte  j0111.27317 can possibly explain the pulsations in the soft x - ray band . if x - rays are emitted from different heights of an accretion column above the polar cap , then harder x - rays would be generated in a lower part of the accretion column , because larger gravitational energy is released there .",
    "in this situation , larger pulsed fraction could be naturally expected in the harder x - ray band , due to the proximity of the emission region to the neutron star surface .",
    "this explanation is qualitatively consistent with the observed properties , such as the smaller pulsed fraction and the broader peak in the lower energy ( see figure [ fig : pp ] ) .",
    "_ asca _ observations have also revealed the presence of a soft excess dominated by several emission lines near 1  kev , in some high - mass x - ray binary pulsars ( vela x-1 , nagase et al .",
    "1994 ; cen x-3 , ebisawa et al .",
    "1996 ; gx 3012 , saraswat et al .",
    "1995 ) . in these sources",
    ", pulsation is nearly absent in the low energy band leading to the conclusion that the soft component is originated at a large distance from the neutron star , probably due to scattering of the power - law component by circumstellar material ( nagase et al .",
    "the absence of low energy spectral lines in xte  j0111.27317 and the presence of pulsations at low energy make it different from the pulsars mentioned above .",
    "the fluorescent iron emission line has been detected in many pulsars , and the equivalent width of the line is found to be upto a few hundred ev in some cases ( white , swank , & holt 1983 ) . the iron line detected with an equivalent width of 50 ev in xte",
    "j0111.27317 is only modest .    in the pulse phase",
    "resolved spectra , we have found indication of an increase in the iron line strength during the pulse maximum . pulse phase resolved spectroscopy of many pulsars indicates an anti correlation between the iron line equivalent width and the intensity ( white et al .",
    "1983 ) , which is consistent with the iron line strength being constant . _",
    "ginga _ observations have indicated a pulse phase dependence of the iron line strength in accretion powered binary pulsars cen x-3 ( day et al .",
    "1993 ) , vela x-1 ( choi et al .",
    "1996 ) , and lmc x-4 ( woo et al .",
    "_ ginga _ and _ asca _ observations of gx 1 + 4 suggest a constant intensity iron line which shows a large increase in the equivalent width during the pulse minimum ( dotani et al .",
    "1989 ; kotani et al .",
    "1999 ) . however , a detailed study of the pulse phase dependence of an iron line equivalent width in the x - ray pulsars observed with _",
    "asca _ has not been done .",
    "the slight hardening of the spectrum observed in xte  j0111.27317 during the pulse maximum is common to many accreting x - ray pulsars ( white et al .",
    "1983 ) .      in figure",
    "[ fig : pp ] we see that the main pulse which arrives at a phase 0.45 earlier than the minimum contributes to most of the observed pulsed emission .",
    "the secondary peak is at a phase 0.17 after the minimum .",
    "the pulse profiles of x - ray pulsars depend on the beaming pattern ( fan or pencil ) , angles between the magnetic axis and the spin axis ( @xmath50 ) , and that between the observer line of sight and the spin axis ( @xmath51 ) .",
    "if @xmath52 , a multi - peak profile will be observed because in a pencil beam geometry , emission from both the polar regions will reach the observer during one revolution of the neutron star , and in a fan beam geometry , the line of sight will cross the magnetic equator twice in one revolution ( wang & welter 1981 ) .",
    "however , for such simple explanation to be valid , in pencil beam geometry , the two pulse peaks need to be separated by 0.5 in phase and the two minima should have same intensity level , while in fan beam geometry , the two peaks should have identical strength .",
    "absence of such symmetric features in the pulse profile indicates that the emission pattern is complex and also the two magnetic poles may not be positioned diametrically opposite to each other . a model of pulse profiles , which includes gravitational light bending and a polar cap or a ring type emission zone ( leahy & li 1995 )",
    "also does not explain the pulse profiles which are sufficiently complex in structure and show time variation .",
    "although the exact distance to this pulsar has not been measured , a possible optical counterpart , which has been identified as a be - type star , is likely to be located at the distance of the smc ( coe et al .",
    "in addition , the absorption column density deduced from the spectral analyses ( @xmath53  h  @xmath1 ; table [ tbl-1 ] ) is comparable to the total hi column density in this direction ( luks 1994 ) , which also supports that this object is beyond our galaxy and possibly in the smc .    the characteristics of this pulsar , like its transient nature , hard x - ray spectrum , high x - ray luminosity , and the rapid spin - up property during the transient phase , are analogous to the pulsars in binary systems with high mass companion ( bildsten et al .",
    "a pulse period of 31  s is also much larger than the period of x - ray pulsars in low mass binaries .",
    "the present outburst is analogous to the giant outbursts seen in be / x - ray pulsars characterized by high luminosity and high spin - up rates .",
    "considering all these properties in the x - ray band and the existence of a be star counterpart , we suggest that xte  j0111.27317 is very likely to be a be / x - ray binary system .",
    "the empirical relation between pulse and orbital periods known to exist among the pulsars in be / x - ray binaries ( corbet 1984 ) , suggesting an orbital period of 3050 days , is in agreement with the observed light curve during the first 70 days after the transient outburst ( figure [ fig : initial ] ) . in the public data of _ cgro_/batse",
    ", the pulse period history shows deviation from a linear trend which can be due to a changing mass - accretion rate or an orbital doppler shift or a combination of both .",
    "if we simply fit the pulse period history with a linear plus sinusoidal function , we obtain a binary period of @xmath54  day .",
    "this result is consistent with the predicted value mentioned above , hence also supports that this pulsar is a be / x - ray binary system .",
    "however , two anomalies could be noted .",
    "one is the photon index of 0.8 above @xmath6  kev obtained from this _ asca _ observation , which is lower than the typical value of @xmath55 for the be / x - ray pulsars ( white et al .",
    "the other is the presence of a soft excess with strong pulsations , which is rarely seen in binary pulsars in our galaxy .",
    "however , even if a pulsar in our galaxy had the soft excess like xte  j0111.2@xmath567317 , it could not be observable in most cases due to the strong absorption of the order of @xmath57  h  @xmath1 .",
    "the magellanic cloud pulsars therefore would be very suitable for a systematic study of soft x - rays from binary pulsars .",
    "we have presented the _ asca _ observation of the newly discovered x - ray pulsar xte  j0111.27317 in its bright transient phase .",
    "pulsations at 30.95  s were unambiguously detected , and the pulse shape and the pulsed fraction are found to have a slight energy dependence .",
    "the energy spectrum in the 0.710.0  kev band has a soft excess above a simple power - law type model , and can be described by an `` inversely broken power - law '' model , which is a broken power - law with a larger / smaller photon index below / above a break energy .",
