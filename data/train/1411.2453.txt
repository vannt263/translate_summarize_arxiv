    "we study the potential of two static quarks in the presence of two quarks of finite mass . while in @xcite we have exclusively considered two static antiquarks and two light quarks ( @xmath0 ) , where @xmath1 , here we also use @xmath2 and @xmath3 quarks , i.e.  investigate @xmath4 and @xmath5 , to obtain certain insights regarding the quark mass dependence of the static antiquark - antiquark interaction .",
    "we also discuss first steps regarding the static quark - antiquark case , i.e.  @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "@xmath9 systems as well as @xmath10 systems have been studied also by other groups ( cf .",
    "e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the @xmath9 and @xmath10 potentials @xmath11 are extracted from correlation functions @xmath12 according to @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the lattice spacing and @xmath15 denote suitable creation operators , which are discussed in detail below . for an introduction to lattice hadron spectroscopy cf .",
    "e.g.  @xcite .",
    "the starting point are static - light mesons , which either consist of a static quark @xmath18 and an antiquark @xmath19 or of a static antiquark @xmath20 and a quark @xmath21 with @xmath22 .",
    "these mesons can be labeled by parity @xmath23 , by the @xmath24-component of the light quark spin @xmath25 ( @xmath26 , because we do not consider gluonic excitations ) and in case of @xmath27 by the @xmath24-component of isospin @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "the lightest static - light meson has @xmath30 and is commonly denoted by @xmath31 , its heavier parity partner with @xmath32 by @xmath33 .",
    "the static - light meson @xmath31 is an approximation for @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 listed in @xcite .",
    "we use static - light meson trial states @xmath37 with @xmath38 for the @xmath31 and @xmath39 for the @xmath33 meson . for a more detailed discussion of static - light mesons cf .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we are interested in the potential of two static - light mesons , i.e.  their energy as a function of their separation @xmath41 . w.l.o.g .",
    "we separate the mesons along the @xmath24-axis , i.e.  their static antiquark @xmath20 and quark @xmath18 are located at @xmath42 and @xmath43 , respectively .",
    "the corresponding @xmath40 trial states are @xmath44 ( @xmath45 are spin indices , @xmath46 color indices and @xmath47 flavor indices ) .",
    "since there are no interactions involving the static quark spins , one should not couple static spins and spins of finite mass , but contract the static spin indices with @xmath48 .",
    "this results in a non - vanishing correlation function independent of @xmath49 .",
    "the separation of the static quark and the static antiquark restricts rotational symmetry to rotations around the axis of separation , i.e.  the @xmath24-axis .",
    "therefore , and since there are no interactions involving the static quark spins , we can label states by the @xmath24-component of the light quark spin @xmath50 . for @xmath51 ,",
    "i.e.  for rotationally invariant states , spatial reflections along an axis perpendicular to the axis of separation are also a symmetry operation ( w.l.o.g .",
    "we choose the @xmath52-axis ) .",
    "the corresponding quantum number is @xmath53 .",
    "@xmath54 can be used as a quantum number also for @xmath55 states , if we use @xmath56 instead of @xmath57 .",
    "parity @xmath58 is not a symmetry , since it exchanges the positions of the static quark and the static antiquark .",
    "however , parity combined with charge conjugation , @xmath59 is a symmetry and , therefore , a quantum number .",
    "when @xmath60 , isospin @xmath61 and its @xmath24-component @xmath62 are also quantum numbers . in summary , there are up to five quantum numbers , which label @xmath63 states , @xmath64 .",
    "we use @xmath65 trial states @xmath67 with @xmath68 ( @xmath69 denotes the charge conjugation matrix ) .",
    "arguments similar to those of the previous subsection lead to quantum numbers @xmath70 . for a more detailed discussion cf .  @xcite .",
    "we use three ensembles of gauge link configurations generated by the european twisted mass collaboration ( etmc ) ( cf .  table  [ tab_ensembles ] ) . for the @xmath9 potentials we use @xmath71 ensembles with lattice spacing @xmath72 for @xmath73 and an even finer lattice spacing @xmath74 for @xmath75 , because in the latter case",
    "the potentials are quite narrow .",
    "existing @xmath10 results are rather preliminary and have been obtained exclusively with @xmath76 and the @xmath77 ensemble with @xmath78 . for details regarding these etmc gauge link ensembles cf .",
    "@xcite .",
    "ccccccccc ensemble & @xmath79 & @xmath80 & @xmath81 & @xmath82 & @xmath83 & @xmath84 & a & @xmath85 + a40.24 & 2 & 3.90 & @xmath86 & 0.00400 & - & - & @xmath87 & @xmath88 + e17.32 & 2 & 4.35 & @xmath89 & 0.00175 & - & - & @xmath90 & @xmath91 + a40.24 & 2 + 1 + 1 & 1.90 & @xmath86 & 0.00400 & 0.15 & 0.19 & @xmath92 & @xmath93 +    correlation functions have been computed using around 100 gauge link configurations from each of the three ensembles .",
    "we have checked that these correlation functions transform appropriately with respect to the symmetry transformations ( 1 ) twisted mass time reversal , ( 2 ) twisted mass parity , ( 3 ) twisted mass @xmath94-hermiticity , ( 4 ) charge conjugation and ( 5 ) cubic rotations . in a second step",
    "we have averaged correlation functions related by those symmetries to reduce statistical errors .",
    "in the following we focus on the attractive channels between ground state static - light mesons ( @xmath31 mesons ) .",
    "for @xmath73 there is a more attractive scalar isosinglet ( @xmath95 , @xmath96 corresponding to quantum numbers @xmath97 ) and a less attractive vector isotriplet ( @xmath98 , @xmath99 corresponding to quantum numbers @xmath100 ) .",
    "for @xmath101 there is only a single attractive channel , the equivalent of the vector isotriplet . to study also the scalar isosinglet with @xmath2 quarks , we consider two quark flavors with the mass of the @xmath2 quark , i.e.  @xmath102 .",
    "similarly we consider @xmath103 to study a charm scalar isosinglet .",
    "proceeding as in @xcite we perform @xmath104 minimizing fits of @xmath105 with respect to the parameters @xmath106 ( light isotriplet ) , @xmath107 ( @xmath108 or @xmath76 ) or @xmath109 ( light isosinglet ) to the lattice results for the @xmath9 potentials .",
    "the resulting functions @xmath11 are shown in figure  [ fig001 ] .",
    "@xmath9 potentials ( [ eq_potfit ] ) for @xmath110 , @xmath108 and @xmath76 ( error bands are not shown ) . * ( a ) *  scalar isosinglet . *",
    "( b ) *  vector isotriplet.,title=\"fig:\"]@xmath9 potentials ( [ eq_potfit ] ) for @xmath110 , @xmath108 and @xmath76 ( error bands are not shown ) . * ( a ) *  scalar isosinglet . *",
    "( b ) *  vector isotriplet.,title=\"fig : \" ]    to determine , whether the investigated mesons may form a bound state , i.e.  a tetraquark , we insert the potentials shown in figure  [ fig001 ] into schrdinger s equation with reduced mass @xmath111 and solve it numerically ( cf .  @xcite for details ) .",
    "while there is strong indication for a bound state in the light scalar isosinglet channel , there seems to be no binding for the light vector isotriplet , or when @xmath112 or @xmath113 . to quantify these statements , we list in table  [ binding ] the factor by which the reduced mass @xmath114 has to be multiplied to obtain a bound state with confidence level @xmath115 and @xmath116 , respectively ( the factors @xmath117 in the light scalar isosinglet indicate binding ) .",
    "these results clearly show that meson - meson bound states are more likely to exist for @xmath16 mesons than for @xmath118 or @xmath36 mesons . in other words",
    "it seems to be essential for a tetraquark to have both heavy quarks ( leading a large reduced mass @xmath114 ) and light quarks ( resulting in a deep and wide potential ) .",
    "l|cc|cc|cc flavor & & & + confidence level for binding & @xmath115 & @xmath116 & @xmath115 & @xmath116 & @xmath115 & @xmath116 + scalar isosinglet & 0.8 & 1.0 & 1.9 & 2.2 & 3.1 & 3.2 + vector isotriplet & 1.9 & 2.1 & 2.5 & 2.7 & 3.4 & 3.5 +      at the moment there are only preliminary results for @xmath10 potentials corresponding to isospin @xmath119 and @xmath76 , i.e.  @xmath120 .",
    "interestingly we observed that all these potentials are attractive , while in the @xmath9 case only half of them are attractive and the other half is repulsive .",
    "this can be understood in a qualitative way by comparing the potential of @xmath121 and of @xmath122 generated by one - gluon exchange . for @xmath122",
    "the pauli principle applied to @xmath123 implies either a symmetric ( sextet ) or an antisymmetric ( triplet ) color orientation of the static quarks corresponding to a repulsive or attractive interaction , respectively . for @xmath121",
    "no such restriction is present , i.e.  all channels contain contributions of the attractive color singlet , which dominates the repulsive color octet .",
    "@xmath124 requires the computation of an additional diagram and @xmath125 and @xmath2 quarks are more demanding with respect to hpc resources than @xmath3 quarks .",
    "we expect corresponding results to be available soon .",
    "we have obtained insights regarding the quark mass dependence of @xmath9 potentials , which suggest that tetraquark states with two heavy @xmath126 antiquarks seem to be more likely to exist , when there are also two light @xmath125 quarks involved but not @xmath2 or @xmath3 quarks .",
    "preliminary results for @xmath10 potentials indicate that there are only attractive channels , which is in contrast to the @xmath9 case .",
