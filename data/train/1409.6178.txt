    "the superconducting proximity effect offers a unique possibility to study superconductivity in combination with other exotic materials properties . by depositing a non - superconducting material ( n ) on top of a known superconductor ( s ) , superconductivity leaks into the n material and the resulting superconducting state",
    "combines the original properties of n with those of superconductivity .",
    "one recent notable example of proximity - induced superconductivity is the measuring of a finite supercurrent in graphene by creating a sns , or josephson , junction in graphene.@xcite among the intriguing properties of graphene , the linear dirac spectrum offers the possibility of specular andreev reflection.@xcite another contemporary proximity system is created by depositing a topological insulator ( ti ) on top of a superconductor.@xcite a ti is insulating in the bulk and , due to the non - trivial topology of its band structure , it has a single conducting dirac cone surfaces state ( or an odd number).@xcite the surface state has its spin locked to the momentum described by a two - dimensional ( 2d ) dirac hamiltonian.@xcite combining the ti surface state with superconductivity has been shown to result in an effective spinless chiral @xmath2-wave superconductor.@xcite the main allure of such superconducting pairing is that it hosts majorana fermions in vortex cores and josephson junctions.@xcite the majorana fermion is its own antiparticle and obeys non - abelian statistics in 2d , which supports fault - tolerant quantum computation.@xcite as evident from both graphene and tis , proximity - induced superconductivity can result in very interesting phenomena when the normal material is effectively 2d . introducing a discrete third dimension in the normal system results in a bilayer structure in proximity - contact to the external superconductor .",
    "the additional layer degree of freedom naturally offers the possibility for yet more novel behavior . among bilayer systems",
    "currently actively studied are those naturally formed such as bilayer graphene,@xcite where the two layers can also partly decouple due to stacking faults present when grown on a silicon carbide substrate.@xcite recently , superconductivity in bilayer graphene has been predicted to both give rise to retro - reflection of electrons @xcite and be a playground for exotic spin - triplet @xmath0-wave interlayer pairing.@xcite also , abc stacked multilayer graphene has been shown to host zero - energy surface states , recently predicted to easily become superconducting.@xcite ti thin films is another actively studied bilayer system . for film thicknesses less than six quintuple layers of the ti bi@xmath3se@xmath4 the surface states on the opposite sides of the film hybridize and create a finite energy gap.@xcite proximity - induced superconductivity has recently been experimentally demonstrated in bi@xmath3se@xmath4 ti thin films by growing the ti on a conventional nbse@xmath3 superconductor.@xcite a superconducting energy gap was found also on the surface away from the superconductor interface , with a diminishing size with increasing film thickness .",
    "more generally , these and other bilayers systems can be seen as material specializations of the double layer formation of a 2d electronic gas in semiconductor heterostructures , creating an effective double quantum well system.@xcite in this work we provide a theoretical study of the proximity - induced superconducting state in a general bilayer ",
    "superconductor hybrid structure , with results applicable to bilayer systems ranging from ti thin films to generic double quantum well systems .    in terms of classifying the superconducting state in a general bilayer system , we first of all conclude that the layer degree of freedom adds another symmetry . the superconducting pair amplitude , being the wave function of the cooper pairs , needs to obey fermi - dirac statistics .",
    "thus a spin - singlet pair usually has even spatial parity ( @xmath5 ) such as @xmath0- and @xmath6-wave , whereas spin - triplet pairing gives odd spatial parity ( @xmath7-wave ) .",
    "in addition , the superconducting pairing amplitude can also be even or odd in time ( @xmath8 ) , or equivalently frequency,@xcite with the relation @xmath9 for spin - singlet ( triplet ) pairing .",
    "some theoretical proposals exist for intrinsic odd - frequency bulk superconductors,@xcite but odd - frequency superconductivity has mostly been associated with interfaces and surfaces.@xcite for example , superconductor  ferromagnet interfaces have been shown to host odd - frequency spin - triplet @xmath0-wave pairing responsible for a long - range proximity effect into the ferromagnet.@xcite more recently , odd - frequency spin - triplet @xmath0-wave pairing has also been shown to appear in tis without invoking any interface phenomenon , only requiring a superconducting state with a spatially varying amplitude or phase,@xcite or if in proximity - contact with a spin - triplet @xmath7-wave superconductor.@xcite finally , an additional layer degree of freedom ( @xmath10 ) gives rise to @xmath11 for spin - singlet ( triplet ) pairing .",

    "the smaller gap is mainly associated with layer 2 , which is the layer farthest from the superconductor , whereas the larger gap principally belongs to layer 1 .",

    "even before going into the details of the functions @xmath97 we can discuss the general structure of the induced pairing amplitudes given in eqs .  .",
    "first , the existence of @xmath85 spin - triplet pairing is a direct consequence of finite rashba spin - orbit coupling in the bilayer .",
    "moreover , this pairing term has chiral @xmath7-wave symmetry due to the @xmath98 prefactor .",
    "the spatial chirality is set directly by the spin quantum number along @xmath17 .",
    "the occurrence of spin - triplet chiral @xmath7-wave pairing for finite spin - orbit interaction is fully consistent with results on proximity - induced superconductivity in ti surfaces.@xcite secondly , the @xmath83 spin - triplet state is a consequence of finite magnetization @xmath16 .",
    "interestingly , this pairing term is always even in momentum space , in fact it has @xmath0-wave symmetry . due to the fermionic nature of the superconducting wave function",
    "this necessitates that intralayer @xmath99 spin - triplet @xmath0-wave pairing is odd in time , or equivalently frequency ( energy ) , which will be evident in the results following .",
    "this is in agreement with previous results on proximity effect in half - metallic ferromagnets , where spin polarization leads to odd - frequency @xmath83 spin - triplet @xmath0-wave pairing , while spin rotation at the interface leads to equal spin - triplet pairing.@xcite finally , the spin - singlet part of the induced anomalous green s function also have @xmath0-wave symmetry in momentum space . before presenting the full results for a generic bilayer we will in the following",
    "discuss experimentally relevant systems in some specific limits .",
    "we first let @xmath100 and thus completely decouple the two layers from each other . since we have assumed that superconductivity only tunnels directly into one of the bilayer layers , the induced anomalous green s function in the bilayer then just has a non - zero @xmath101 term .",
    "this term also significantly simplifies in the @xmath100 limit and can be written as : @xmath102 where @xmath103 is equal to @xmath104 and we have for simplicity assumed no parabolic dispersion in the bilayer . for a finite parabolic dispersion ,",
    "@xmath30 can simply be replaced by @xmath64 .",
    "the results in the single layer limit confirm the odd - frequency ( odd dependence on the energy @xmath105 ) @xmath0-wave nature of @xmath106 .",
    "it further shows that the spin - singlet pairing also has @xmath0-wave symmetry .",
    "moreover , eqs .",
    "show how it is possible , by tuning the external parameters @xmath107 , and @xmath30 , to manipulate both the amplitude and the very existence of some of the pairing terms .",
    "for example , by setting @xmath108 it is possible to completely eliminate @xmath109 pairing but keep @xmath110 pairing .",
    "another case simpler than the most generic bilayer system is that of a ti thin film .",
    "here , @xmath111 in eq .   and for simplicity",
    "we also ignore any possible doping of the system such that @xmath112 , and thus @xmath95 .",
    "focusing first on the intralayer spin - triplet pairing we find for the undoped ti thin film @xmath113 where @xmath114 and @xmath115 .",
    "even though the functional dependences on the external parameters are now more complicated compared to the single layer limit several notable observations are still possible .",
    "most interestingly , by tuning to the point @xmath116 it is possible to make one of the equal spin components completely disappear in one layer , while the other equal spin component disappears in the other layer .",
    "this is a consequence of the different helicities , set by the spin - orbit coupling , in the two surface states .",
    "we also again find that the intralayer @xmath99 spin - triplet state is an odd - frequency @xmath0-wave state .",
    "keeping in mind that the gap parameter for spin - triplet pairing can also be written in the form @xmath117 , we conclude that the @xmath118-vector takes the form @xmath119 $ ] for intralayer pairing in layers 1 and 2 , respectively .",
    "the layer degree of freedom also opens for the possibility of interlayer pairing @xmath120 .",
    "more specifically , for each spin and spatial symmetry the interlayer pairing @xmath120 can , even in the general bilayer case , be divided up into a part that is even ( el ) in layer index and a part that is odd ( ol ) : @xmath121 . for the part that is odd in layer index",
    "this leads directly to the frequency dependence necessarily also being odd , if the spin and spatial symmetries are to be the same as for the intralayer and even - interlayer pairings .",
    "this is in analogy with multiband systems where odd - frequency , odd - interband pairing has been shown to have the same spatial and spin symmetries as even - frequency , even - interband pairing.@xcite in a bilayer system , the layer index plays the same role as the band index in a multiband superconductor .    focusing on the existence of odd - frequency interband pairing",
    ", we find the components @xmath122 , @xmath123 , and @xmath124 for a ti thin film , where the linear energy dependence directly gives the odd - frequency nature .",
    "the equal spin pairing is a chiral @xmath7-wave state ( see eq .",
    "for the expression for @xmath120 ) and thus odd - frequency pairing means oddness in layer index .",
    "also the odd - frequency spin - singlet interlayer pairing is odd in layer index since it has @xmath0-wave spatial symmetry . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath99 pairing , dependent on a finite magnetization , has @xmath0-wave symmetry and thus the odd - frequency term is instead associated with even - interlayer pairing .",
    "it should be noted that the dependence on @xmath125 for the spin - triplet odd - frequency terms is a consequence of zero doping in the ti . at finite doping levels",
    "this is replaced by dependence on @xmath126 , as seen in the appendix [ app ] .",
    "also , while we do not explicitly list them here , the corresponding equal spin and spin - singlet even - frequency , even - interlayer pairing and the @xmath99 even - frequency , odd - interlayer pairing are also both present in a ti thin film , with the full analytical expressions given in appendix [ app ] .      for a general bilayer system",

    "the overall structure of the table entries is a direct consequence of eqs .  .",
    "the equal spin - triplet pairing is only present for finite rashba spin - orbit coupling @xmath19 and has always chiral @xmath7-wave symmetry , whereas the @xmath99 spin - triplet pairing requires a finite magnetization @xmath16 and has @xmath0-wave symmetry . due to the spin - triplet @xmath0-wave nature",
    "the latter pairing is necessarily odd in frequency for both intralayer and even - interlayer pairings .",
    "the spin - singlet pairing also has @xmath0-wave spatial symmetry .",
    "moreover , intralayer and even - interlayer pairing terms have the same overall behavior .",
    "in addition , as discussed above for a ti thin film , odd - interlayer pairing is also generally present .",
    "the oddness in layer index is accompanied by a change in the frequency dependence . for spin - singlet and equal - spin pairing",
    ", the odd - interlayer pairing is odd in frequency , whereas for @xmath99 spin - triplet pairing the odd - interlayer pairing is even in frequency .",
    "very generally , the symmetry of the superconducting state fulfills the requirement @xmath128 for spin - singlet and @xmath129 for spin - triplet pairing , where @xmath5 is the spatial parity , @xmath8 stands for time - reversal , and @xmath10 is the layer parity .",
    "we note that the interlayer pairing should be possible to detect experimentally using nonlocal spectroscopy of andreev bound states , as has recently been demonstrated in double quantum dots for inter - dot pairing.@xcite    very generally we can understand the occurrence and parameter dependences of the odd - frequency pairing by the following argument : odd - frequency pairing requires that the two electrons of the cooper pair have different energies , such that the overall energy dependence can become odd .",
    "this is why intralayer @xmath130 spin - triplet pairing can be odd in frequency , because it is proportional to the magnetization and each spin has a different energy in a magnetic field . in the undoped ti thin film limit",
    "we can instead keep each layer at a different energy by applying a finite bias @xmath125 .",
    "this produces odd - frequency spin - triplet pairing in - between the layers , i.e. interlayer pairing , proportional to @xmath125 .",
    "however , there in fact already exists another asymmetry between the layers in a bilayer  superconductor hybrid structure , since only one of the layers is in direct proximity to the superconductor .",
    "this is why odd - frequency interband pairing appears very generally for all bilayer systems , and not just for a limited range of parameters .    beyond the general symmetries displayed in table [ tab ] , the @xmath131 terms also have additional functionality of the input parameters @xmath132 .",
    "there exists multiple special cases where tuning these input parameters can result in an engineered superconducting state .",
    "for example , as already mentioned , in an undoped ti thin film setting @xmath133 eliminates @xmath134 and @xmath135 , such that the resulting equal spin state only has @xmath136-wave symmetry in layer 1 and @xmath137-wave symmetry in layer 2 .",
    "there is thus a fully chiral superconducting state in each layer for @xmath133 .",
    "this difference arises from the opposite spin - orbit coupling direction in the two different ti surfaces . at finite doping levels",
    "@xmath135 still vanishes but @xmath134 is now linearly dependent on @xmath30 .",
    "another experimentally relevant tuning is when the rashba coefficient @xmath138 , which describes a double quantum well system with no spin - orbit coupling .",

    "[ ] ) @xmath139 alternatively , we can also obtain overall amplitudes of the order parameters by integrating over all possible momenta . for @xmath7-wave symmetry",
    "we , however , then need to exclude the phase @xmath140 , @xmath141 , when we determine the overall amplitude of the order parameter .    in order to limit the possible parameter space , but still keep an experimentally relevant bilayer system in mind , we here focus on ti thin films at finite doping levels and with applied electric bias .",

    "even when we only focus on the sign of the order parameters at the two different fermi momenta , most of them still changes signs between the two fermi surfaces . incorporating this sign change in the order parameter symmetry ,",
    "the spin - singlet state should properly be addressed as a @xmath149-wave symmetry , whereas the spin - triplet state becomes a @xmath150 state , where the sign subscript indicates a sign change between the two fermi surfaces .",
    "such a sign - changing @xmath0-wave state is currently most prominently known from the iron - pnictide superconductors,@xcite although there the order parameter switch sign between the @xmath91 and @xmath16 points , whereas in the present case the sign change is between fermi surfaces both centered around @xmath91 .",
    "spin - orbit coupled semiconductors in proximity to a @xmath149-wave superconductor , such that the inner and outer fermi surfaces have effective order parameters with opposite signs , have recently been proposed as a route to engineer time - reversal invariant topological superconductors , which hosts pairs of majorana boundary states.@xcite here we find that for ti thin films the necessary sign switch in the superconducting order parameter between the two fermi surfaces is present even for a conventional @xmath0-wave superconductor , simply due to the bilayer structure .",
    "note that we used @xmath151 here in order to explicitly show that a time - reversal invariant non - trivial superconducting state is in generally present in biased ti thin films .    to further explore the sign switching between the two fermi surfaces we plot @xmath152 in @xmath153 space for both ti surfaces in fig .",

    "the somewhat different behavior of the layers 1 and 2 can be traced back to the different expressions for proximity - induced superconductivity in eq .  .",
    "in layer 1 superconductivity is a consequence of a direct tunneling process from the superconductor and given by @xmath156 , whereas in layer 2 superconductivity is also dependent on the interlayer ( intersurface ) tunneling process and expressed through @xmath157 .    beyond a sign change for the momentum - resolved order parameter @xmath142",

    "additional parameters are @xmath147  ev , @xmath158  ev . the insets show the even and odd - interlayer pairing terms .",
    "[ fig : deltav ] ]    as seen , for a range of bias potentials it is possible to have @xmath159 for both the spin - singlet @xmath0-wave and the spin - triplet chiral @xmath7-wave paring .",
    "this means that the order parameters change sign in the region between the two layers , creating an effective @xmath160-junction between the two ti surfaces .",
    "the @xmath160 phase difference in the intralayer order parameters between the two different layers is a consequence of the asymmetry between the two layers .",
    "interestingly , a two - wire system in proximity to an @xmath0-wave superconductor has very recently been shown to host a time - reversal invariant topological superconducting state if the two wires have different rashba spin - orbit couplings and the determinant of the pairing matrix in wire space is negative.@xcite in the parameter space where @xmath159 for a ti thin film these two conditions are easily satisfied between the two surfaces .",
    "a bilayer system with only one layer in proximity to a conventional @xmath0-wave superconductor might thus represent a 2d version of the same mechanism , only requiring tuning of an external electric bias potential .",
    "we have in this work studied bilayer  superconductor hybrid structures , where a conventional spin - singlet @xmath0-wave superconductor is in direct proximity contact with one of the layers in the bilayer .",
    "in order to address general bilayer systems we have used a model for a bilayer which includes general parabolic dispersion , rashba spin - orbit coupling , layer tunneling , bias potential , and magnetic zeeman field .    by extracting the proximity - induced anomalous green s function in the bilayer we have been able to show how , and",
    "also what type of , superconductivity is proximity - induced in the bilayer system . due to the layeredness , possible spin - orbit coupling , and tuning by electric and magnetic fields ,",
    "a very rich structure of the superconducting pairing can appear in a bilayer .",
    "even though we always assume that the external superconductor has spin - singlet @xmath0-wave symmetry , equal - spin spin - triplet @xmath1-wave pairing is induced in both layers in the presence of a finite spin - orbit coupling , and @xmath99 spin - triplet @xmath0-wave pairing with an odd dependence on frequency ( energy ) appears whenever a magnetic zeeman field is applied . moreover",
    ", not only intralayer pairing but also interlayer pairing , where the two electrons building up a cooper pair belong to different layers , is present in a bilayer . the interlayer pairing can be either even or odd in the layer index , and this additional index opens the possibility for additional odd - frequency pairing .",
    "more specifically , we find a complete reciprocity between oddness in frequency and in layer index .",
    "for example , spin - singlet @xmath0-wave pairing exists both as even - frequency intralayer ( and even - interlayer ) pairing as well as odd - frequency , odd - interlayer pairing .",
    "this is analogous to the situation recently discovered in multiband superconductors , where odd - frequency , odd - interband pairing can be generated.@xcite note , however , that interlayer pairing is naturally present in bilayer systems such as ti thin films , whereas interband pairing in a multiband superconductor requires additional band hybridization mechanisms .",
    "we have also calculated the induced superconducting order parameters in doped ti thin films , as a contemporary example of a bilayer system .",
    "such films have both an inner and outer fermi surface in the presence of a finite bias voltage , and we find that over a wide range of parameters the order parameters switches signs between the two fermi surfaces as well as between the two layers ( surfaces ) .",
    "interestingly , order parameter sign - switches , both in reciprocal space between fermi surfaces@xcite and in real space,@xcite have recently been proposed as a key to produce time - reversal - invariant topological superconductors with pairs of majorana fermions at surfaces .",
    "this opens up for the possibility of using ti thin films in proximity to conventional @xmath0-wave superconductors to engineer topological superconductors with majorana fermions and is the subject of future work .    beyond the structure and symmetry of the superconducting state we have also reported on the energy dispersion and ldos in the bilayer system , with superconducting energy gaps clearly present in both layers at finite interlayer hybridization . in reference to the presence of odd - frequency superconductivity we point out that we find no evidence of zero- or low - energy states in the superconducting gap .",
    "zero - energy and sub - gap states have been associated with odd - frequency pairing appearing at surface and interfaces,@xcite and also under more general terms.@xcite the lack of low - energy states in bilayer systems is , however , in agreement with other recent findings of odd - frequency pairing in multiband superconductors,@xcite in spatially inhomogenous tis,@xcite as well as in heavy - fermion compounds.@xcite    let us also briefly comment on the range of values for the input parameters in our calculations in terms of experimental accessibility . focusing mainly on the experimental parameters for a ti thin film , a prototypical spin - orbit coupled bilayer system ,",
    "the hybridization tunneling @xmath15 between the two surfaces of the ti thin film can be tuned by changing the thickness of the sample from @xmath161 for samples thicker than six quintuple layers to @xmath162  ev for films only two quintuple layers thick.@xcite the chemical potential @xmath30 and the potential difference between the two layers @xmath125 can be tuned electrically by a gate voltage .",
    "a range of at least a few hundred mev has been reported.@xcite magnetic fields up to 1 t , proportional to the order of @xmath163  mev in magnetic energy @xmath16 , has also been used experimentally,@xcite although higher magnetic fields should reasonably also be accessible . in terms of the external superconductor ,",
    "the order parameter is of the order of a few mev for conventional @xmath0-wave superconductors.@xcite the tunneling @xmath14 between the superconductor and the bottom layer of the bilayer system is harder to estimate but is expected to be small , due to interface imperfections between the bilayer and the superconductor .",
    "practically , the tunneling amplitude is often tuned in such as way as to reproduce experimental data .",
    "we have in this work explicitly chosen the input parameters in all figures to be well within this current experimental range ( apart from the superconducting gap in fig .  2 , which for illustrative purposes was chosen to be large ) , such that our results should be experimentally accessible using common bilayer and superconductor materials .    in summary ,",
    "a bilayer  superconductor hybrid structure provides a very rich playground for multiple types of proximity - induced superconductivity , including different spin states and odd - frequency pairing .",
    "the bilayer structure also offers the possibility of sign switches of the order parameter , both between the multiple fermi surfaces and between the two layers , with the possibility of generating majorana fermion pairs .",
