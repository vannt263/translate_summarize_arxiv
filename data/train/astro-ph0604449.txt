    "static , wide - field population studies continue to progress to fainter limits ( e.g. , sdss to @xmath8=21 mag ; * ? ? ? * ) and continue to produce a better understanding to the galactic boundaries and beyond . recently ,",
    "wide - field , temporal surveys have begun to catch up , going to deeper limits and becoming increasingly more common , such as the bsvs @xcite , quest @xcite , supermacho , @xcite , and the fsvs @xcite , with a variety of different science goals and target populations , probing new areas in astrophysics .",
    "a survey like the fsvs with variability sampling over hours to years samples a large range of dynamical phenomena including mass transfer events , pulsations , and stellar activity with amplitudes @xmath00.01 and larger .",
    "thus , the fsvs with multi - band photometry and variability sampling provides for both multiple population studies and for independent comparisons to other surveys .    for the fsvs to meet its design goals and be useful to future programs ,",
    "an understanding of the distribution of colors and variability sampled by the fsvs is necessary .",
    "a representative region of magnitude and color space was selected to provide a typical completeness level that can be achieved in the overall dataset .",
    "simulations of the variability sampled by the fsvs were produced in order to probe the sensitivity of the fsvs data . using the fsvs dataset ,",
    "a sub - sample was selected and examined for the general distribution of sources across magnitude , color , and variability space as a preliminary study .",
    "section 2 briefly reviews the key properties of the fsvs dataset described in detail by @xcite and describes the field sample selections used as the basis in the following sections with completeness estimates .",
    "the resulting color space is described is section 3 , including the extreme color limits and comparison to star counts of a bahcall galactic model .",
    "the variability space is described in section 4 including detection sensitivity in time - scale and amplitudes .",
    "section 5 combines the color and variability information to investigate the variable nature of point source populations , both galactic and extragalactic , in terms of a variability fraction by color .",
    "section 6 presents a discussion and summary of the dataset and study .",
    "the fsvs provides a database for studying faint populations and their variability , spanning @xmath01625 mag across the optical regime using the @xmath5 , @xmath3 , and @xmath9 filters , @xmath3 and rgo @xmath9 filter set at the isaac newton telescope , http://www.ing.iac.es/@xmath0quality/filter/filt4.html .",
    "the wavelength coverages ( center / width ) for each filter are 4298/1065 , 5425/975 , and 8063/937  for @xmath5 , @xmath3 , and @xmath9 respectively . ] with time - sampling obtained in the @xmath3-band over 10 s of minutes to years . with a total areal coverage of @xmath023 square degrees at moderate to high galactic latitudes , the fsvs also provides a sample spanning relatively different galactic populations .",
    "the fsvs was designed as both a photometric and astrometric survey to investigate the general potential of such a survey to faint magnitudes , kuiper belt objects , intrinsically faint ultracool dwarfs and old white dwarfs , interacting binaries , rr lyrae stars , and optical transients to gamma - ray bursts . since its completion , additional studies including white dwarf - red dwarf binaries , quasars ( lensing , variability , and association with galaxy groups ) and galaxy clusters @xcite have been added . in comparison to other surveys",
    ", the fsvs may only have a fraction of the areal coverage and time - sampling of the all - sky variability surveys , but the fsvs proceeds several magnitudes fainter opening up a distinct and significant volume of space .",
    "the data outputs of the survey include processed @xmath5 , @xmath3 , and @xmath9 images and four photometric databases with astrometry .",
    "the four photometry methods include variable psf fitting , 2xfwhm aperture , fixed 12 pixel aperture , and isophotal magnitudes , where the variable psf fitting photometry is the recommended dataset for variability studies .",
    "the stellarity parameter from sextractor provides point - to - extended source discrimination in the @xmath5 and @xmath3 filters , but due to the thinned ccds @xmath9 is highly inconsistent . in using a stellarity measure determined from co - adding the bulk of the best @xmath3 images , point - to - extended source discrimination reaches to @xmath3=23.524 mag overall .",
    "however , to depths fainter than @xmath3=2223 , many point sources are mis - classified as extended objects .",
    "the absolute calibration of magnitudes is @xmath00.05 and @xmath00.1 for @xmath10 and @xmath9 respectively and astrometric positions are found to be reliable to @xmath00.5@xmath11 over the entire dataset .",
    "the fsvs public release datafsvs / programs / readme ] as described by @xcite is used in this work .",
    "an additional version of the dataset will be available in the near future at the noao data products program web site and updates there will be described in future works as they are utilized .",
    "like all general surveys , the fsvs data set is not inherently uniform or complete ( e.g. , field pointing offsets , poor weather , technical problems ) . the unavoidable non - uniform sampling will not interfere with the general design of the fsvs to sample a large range of variability as described in @xcite .",
    "however , an estimation of the degree of incompleteness is required in order to cope with possible inherent selection effects and biases . to investigate the incompleteness , sub - sets in the fsvs data",
    "were created incorporating similar observational properties of magnitude , color , and variability sensitivities . in this paper",
    "we present a summary of the completeness using two specifically constructed field groups that are representative of the entire set as a whole .",
    "the fsvs _ field groups _ presented in table [ tab : fgrp ] are spatially contiguous fields that will share similar observational properties  from the same observing run , similar galactic populations , and similar time - sampling properties .",
    "field group 01 and 19 are similar in time - sampling and areal coverage , but are from different observing seasons and sample potentially different stellar populations at mid- to high latitudes respectively .",
    "field group 25 is similar in galactic position to field group 19 and observed in the same observing run , but has a larger sample of observations over an observing week , fewer yearly re - observations , and smaller areal coverage .    for our purposes here",
    ", we have initially selected the dynamic range in the fsvs to be set by the saturation limit at the bright end and a 3@xmath12 detection with respect to the background sky flux at the faint end of the calibrated dataset .",
    "the completeness of this sample should not depend on the parameter to obtain a set of point sources ( i.e. , the stellarity ) .",
    "as shown in figure 7 of @xcite , the stellarity value for the classification of point sources ( stellarity @xmath20.8 ) is usable to @xmath3 of 2324 mag , but begins to degrade beyond @xmath3@xmath022 mag .",
    "therefore , a @xmath3 range will need to be chosen to restrict losses due to point - to - extended source confusion .",
    "figure [ fig : allbvihist01 ] presents histograms of all sources contrasted with point sources detected in the @xmath5 , @xmath3 , and @xmath9 filters that have no error flag in field groups 01 .",
    "the source number peaks at 23.8 , 23.4 , and 21.5 mag in @xmath5 , @xmath3 , and @xmath9 respectively . the @xmath5 and @xmath3 filters show little change other than a loss of extended and fainter sources , moving the number peak to 23.6 and 22.4 mag in @xmath5 and @xmath3 respectively .",
    "the @xmath9 filter shows a significant deviation in the number of sources beyond 19.5 mag .",
    "the additional loss of sources in the @xmath9 filter is due to the required association for classification of a point source on the detection of the source in the @xmath3 filter ( see section 3.1 on extreme colors ) . with the @xmath9 filter detection result , further investigation of completeness",
    "will thus be done using only the @xmath5 and @xmath3 detections . in order to provide a uniform , complete sample over all field groups and provide a significant range of astrophysical importance ,",
    "a representative @xmath3 magnitude range was adopted .",
    "table [ tab : colset ] summarizes the magnitude limits and the slight differences between the fsvs field groups samples .    at fainter magnitudes ,",
    "the profile of fainter stars becomes significantly noisy and may become contaminated by crowding with faint galaxies in the wings of the star causing a mis - classification of the true point source as an extended one .",
    "conversely , de - blended galaxy sets may be classified more as point - like , adding to the confusion . to determine the magnitude threshold for clear classification of point sources ,",
    "a number fraction is investigated as a function of magnitude shown in figure [ fig : stelrng ] .",
    "two number fraction cases are plotted , the number of sources with a stellarity value @xmath20.9 divided by the total number of sources @xmath20.8 and the number of sources with stellarity @xmath20.8 divided by the number of sources with stellarity @xmath20.6 .",
    "both cases show a similar fraction indicating a similar trend of point sources moving to uncertain extended values of stellarity at fainter magnitudes . at @xmath3@xmath022 mag ,",
    "the point near which the slope of the trend becomes much steeper , @xmath093% of the sources are still considered strongly point - like . by @xmath3@xmath023 mag , the stellarity measure has lost many sources to the uncertain extended classification as there are roughly equal numbers being distributed throughout the stellarity range .",
    "losses from contamination factors including truncation at and near ccd edges , cosmic rays and bad pixels , close and bright neighbors , and saturation artifacts must also be quantified . as the adjoining fields observed overlap by a few arcminutes , source duplication is possible .",
    "thus , sources with matching coordinates to @xmath61@xmath11 are checked for and the data with less time - sampling and poorer magnitudes are removed .",
    "an additional requirement has been applied to the sample that at least 80% of the total @xmath3 observations exist , chosen to allow for the occasional loss by small field shifts into a bad pixel or inner ccd edge , and cosmic ray influence , but to not degrade the variability sampling .",
    "losses due to close , bright neighbors and saturation artifacts are estimated by visual inspection of the images for point sources @xmath3@xmath622.0 mag .",
    "the loss of sources that fall in between ccds is not an issue as the total areal size was calculated using the sum for each ccd .",
    "the adopted @xmath3 bright limit of 17.5 avoids losses due to variation in the saturation level .",
    "table [ tab : sourceloss ] summarizes the average loss of sources due to the factors mentioned above .",
    "inclusion of a possible 7% loss due to mis - classified point sources contributes approximately one - third to nearly half in the completeness estimate losses .",
    "the requirement that 80% of the time - sampled @xmath3 measurements exist is found to be of negligible effect in the completeness estimate .",
    "the dominant degradation of completeness comes from the simultaneous requirement of a @xmath5 and @xmath3 measurement , with 710% of sources lost due to detection losses in @xmath5 ( see sect . 3.1 ) .    with the multi - epoch observations , an estimation for the probability of a missed detection can be used as an internal check of completeness for a single detection as used in the palomar - green survey @xcite",
    "the fraction of a single detection to a double detection is given @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the number of sources found once and twice respectively , making @xmath16 the probability of only a single detection .",
    "the completeness can then be estimated using the percent of duplicate sky coverage by @xmath17 \\label{eq : compl}\\ ] ] where @xmath18 is the fraction of duplicate coverage . in the fsvs , an average of 96% with variations",
    "@xmath61% was found for the overlapping coverage and used for @xmath18 .",
    "all fields groups were found to have a high level of internal completeness using any of the 12 - 30 epochs in combination . within the adopted magnitude range ,",
    "the possible sources of detection loss are combined and show a nearly uniform estimate of total completeness presented in table [ tab : sourceloss ] for each field group .",
    "exploration of the fsvs color space provides a view of the populations contained within the fsvs .",
    "figure [ fig : cc01 ] presents an example description of the @xmath4 , @xmath19 color - color space and source number histograms in @xmath3 magnitude groups .",
    "the color limits given in table [ tab : colset ] still define a complete sample for @xmath3=17.522 mag .",
    "the @xmath19 color is included , but is not considered complete to the levels in table [ tab : sourceloss ] except for the first two @xmath3 magnitude group sets , 17.519.0 and 19.020.5 . for main sequence dwarfs , the @xmath4 color range spans the early a ( a0 ) to early m ( m2m5 ) spectral types , and also reaches late k to m0 giants as well @xcite .",
    "however , with just broadband @xmath1 filters and color calibration uncertainties of 0.07 ( @xmath4 ) and 0.11 ( @xmath19 ) in addition to the photometric uncertainties , color separation between luminosity classes is not possible .",
    "also , no correction is made for extinction or reddening in the sources as the correction is small , by design of the field selection @xcite process .",
    "this along with other details will be investigated in an overall encompassing analysis in a later work .",
    "the set of extreme color sources , sources not detected in all 3 filters , is presented in the following sub - section .",
    "the @xmath3 magnitude groups illustrate the changing population contributions to the color space sample in the fsvs field groups with a a bimodal distribution in the @xmath4 color space .",
    "the contribution to the redder @xmath4 colors increases dramatically as additional cooler dwarfs were sampled at fainter magnitudes . in the @xmath3=2223 mag group , the distribution is strongly smeared by the increasing color uncertainty as shown in the @xmath4 , @xmath19 color - color plot .",
    "ideally , extreme color sources are sources that do not have a complete detection in all filters due to having a steep spectral energy distribution .",
    "as the observations in multiple filters are not simultaneous , it is possible for sources with variability or proper motions to show up as extreme color sources .",
    "the extreme color sources may also be _ junk _ , or more commonly , image detection limited sources .",
    "false extreme color sources will provide an idea of the quality of source detection , matching , or inherent problems in the dataset pipeline itself .",
    "thus , image detection limited sources provides yet another test of the quality and limiting magnitude output from the pipeline reduction process .    with three filters used in the fsvs",
    ", there are six possible extreme color source types ; @xmath5 , @xmath3 , and @xmath9 only detections and combinations of @xmath10 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 . in terms of their spectral energy distribution",
    ", possible types of sources that will show up in @xmath5 only may include very hot sources such as hot white dwarfs and accretion powered objects . at longer wavelengths , @xmath9",
    "only detections can include cooler temperature sources such as very low - mass dwarfs ( investigated in more detail along with with @xmath20 detections by cross - matching the brightest with 2mass photometry and follow - up spectroscopy @xcite ) .",
    "@xmath3 only detections could include odd spectral sources such as quasars with strong emission ( i.e. , @xmath22 ) redshifted into the @xmath3 band region ( causing at least a @xmath5 band dropout ) or even further into the @xmath9 band resulting in an @xmath9 only detection .",
    "detection in the two filters @xmath10 and @xmath20 can be sources with less extreme of a spectral energy distribution ( i.e. , white dwarfs and m dwarfs ) , and more so near the detection limits .",
    "detection of a source in @xmath21 will be just as extreme as a detection of @xmath3 only just in the opposite sense with emission shifted out of the @xmath3 bandpass or more into the @xmath21 bandpasses such as composite objects like possibly white dwarf - red dwarf binaries .",
    "however , many extreme color sources are likely to be just near the image detection limits . table [ tab : xcol ] provides the color limits for sources in order to produce an extreme color boundary and give an average detection limit of the ccds in the field group 01 ( e.g. , for a @xmath5 only detection at the image limit , the @xmath4 color must be less than or equal to 0.52 ) .",
    "the work of @xcite presents a useful comparison of populations in the @xmath1 color space that when combined with the fsvs extreme color boundaries reveals where sources can appear as extreme color sources in the fsvs .",
    "variable or transient sources can also be recorded as single filter detections or filter dropouts given that the observations in the different filters are not simultaneous .",
    "inclusion of the multiple @xmath3 observations into a mean @xmath3 to replace the sources with missing photometric @xmath3 during the @xmath23 color sequence is possible , but not done here as sources can be largely variable and non - periodic requiring a case by case investigation .",
    "timescales of order 15 mins separate the different filter observations in the @xmath23 color sequence and up to 1 year in the @xmath3 observation that defines an exclusion window for detection .",
    "this timescale spans a wide range of populations that will exist near the detection limit of the survey ( i.e. , m dwarfs , quasars , supernovae , orphan grb afterglows )",
    ". some may show up once in one filter ( i.e. , fast outburst flare on an active m dwarf ) during the color sequence or in @xmath3 at the peak of their variability and possibly @xmath5 or @xmath9 depending on the spectral energy distribution ( i.e. , @xmath5 band dropouts in the case of m dwarfs again ) .",
    "single filter detections may also include rapidly moving solar system sources .",
    "a preliminary investigation by a team at the planetary science institute @xcite looking for kbos resulted in no conclusive identifications .",
    "since the field groups are far from the ecliptic , the numbers here are expected to be small .",
    "two moving sources were clearly identified in the @xmath3 only detection group that were bright enough to be classified as point - like , and are likely to be from the larger population of main belt asteroids .",
    "the error flags from the fsvs pipeline do not report information on the null detection of a source making it necessary to investigate the extreme color sources on a source by source basis .",
    "the total numbers of extreme color sources for field group 01 is given in table [ tab : xcol ] as a typical set .",
    "the occurrence of junk sources , ones that should have been detected and were not , is also estimated as a percentage of the total number cataloged .",
    "the sources of junk are identified as sources that were mis - matched , sources lost near saturated sources from bleeding and spikes , and sources affected by cosmic rays and prior unlabeled bad pixels .. ] for sources with a @xmath3@xmath2423.0 detection , the stellarity measure was utilized to give a percentage of the sources that are classified as point - like in table [ tab : xcol ] .",
    "no ideal extreme color sources were detected at the bright magnitude end of the survey , only near or at the faint detection limit .",
    "overall , the mid- and high galactic latitude fields are similar in their content of extreme color sources and thus fsvs field group 01 is presented as a representative sample from the numbers presented in table [ tab : xcol ] .",
    "histograms of single filter detections are shown in figure [ fig : x101 ] and show the majority of the @xmath5 and @xmath3 only detections occur at the plate limits .",
    "however , the @xmath9 only detection sources show an enhanced number well above the plate limit of the survey and partially explain the decline of sources detected as point sources in figure [ fig : allbvihist01 ] with very red limiting colors that peaks at @xmath252.6 ( populations of cooler , low - mass dwarfs and high redshift quasars ) .",
    "histograms of two filter detections are shown in figure [ fig : x201 ] .",
    "the histograms illustrate that the majority of the extreme color sources are actually just sources at the plate limits of the survey .",
    "figure [ fig : x2pt01 ] shows histograms of the point sources with @xmath3@xmath2423 mag for the @xmath10 and @xmath20 detections .",
    "the population missing as shown in figure [ fig : allbvihist01 ] are identified as the @xmath20 detected sources with @xmath3@xmath223 mag .",
    "the simple two component galaxy model ( main disk and halo ) of @xcite was used to compare the populations in field groups 01 and 19 .",
    "as the fsvs sources only have @xmath1 photometry with fairly large color uncertainties ( of order 0.1 mag ) , separation of luminosity classes is impossible .",
    "the bahcall model was run using the parameters listed in table [ tab : bahcallparm ] to produce a simple description of the expected distributions of stars .",
    "m13 was used as the halo turnoff as it provides generally the best fit to high galactic latitude observations @xcite .",
    "even though stars earlier than spectral type a are not expected , the bright absolute magnitude ( m@xmath26 ) was set at -6 as the function is smooth and will reflect the negligible low population .",
    "the faint m@xmath26 was set at 16.5 to provide a comparison to prior population studies ( i.e. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but may be an uncertain result since the fsvs is only complete to @xmath4@xmath01.5 and for dwarfs to @xmath27@xmath012.5 .",
    "the color binning in the model output is similar to the uncertainties of the fsvs photometry .",
    "table [ tab : bahcallres ] gives the output numbers of stars and percentage of giants for the entire sample , the disk , and the halo .",
    "figure [ fig : galmodel ] presents the fsvs star counts as a histogram of @xmath4 color with the bahcall model result over - plotted .",
    "the lower latitude field group 01 shows the larger number of disk stars at redder @xmath4 in comparison to the spheroid contribution .",
    "the high latitude field group 19 shows a roughly equal bimodal distribution with the spheroid contribution being larger for the bluer @xmath4 peak and the disk contribution being larger for the redder @xmath4 peak .",
    "however , the models do not exactly match the fsvs populations .",
    "red - ward of 1.5 in @xmath4 , both fsvs field groups show an under - abundance that is a reflection of the incompleteness of the samples for redder sources .",
    "blue - ward of @xmath4=0.5 , both the fsvs field groups are also under - abundant and may indicate an incompleteness problem as well .",
    "in fsvs field group 01 , an over - abundance from @xmath4@xmath00.61.4 is likely a thick disk contribution @xcite not included in the bahcall model .",
    "fsvs field group 19 shows no strong overabundance until @xmath4@xmath01.21.4 due to a much lower number contribution as expected from the disk population . using the outputs from the bahcall model ,",
    "an estimate of the number of giants in the field groups can be made ( @xmath08% and 13% at mid- and high galactic latitudes respectively ) that will be useful for understanding the population of variable sources detected in the fsvs until better photometry is obtained ( e.g. , source cross - matching to the sdss ) . table [ tab : bahcallres ] breaks down the numbers of expected giants for the field groups .",
    "with the fsvs time - sampling , a general statistical test must be applied to test for variability . for the detection of variability ,",
    "there are three thresholds that must be considered ; the probability in a statistical test , the amplitude , and the time - sampling .",
    "the first threshold is a pure statistical result , while the latter two will be related to the type of variability present .",
    "however , all three parameters will be convoluted by the others and simulations were constructed to test and explore the potential of the fsvs data set for detection of variability . the determination of variability will also be affected by the level of variability with respect to the photometric uncertainties and the number of points sampled and are included in the simulations .",
    "the large time - sample set can be broken up into smaller time groups to investigate intranight , day , week , and month - year variability . to compare the variability ,",
    "the fsvs field groups have been made roughly similar as summarized in table [ tab : fgrpvar ] .",
    "field groups 01 and 19 have the same number of nights ( 3 ) , and yearly re - observations ( 2 ) , with slightly different number of observations within each night , particularly in field group 01 .",
    "field group 25 has observations over 6 nights with only a 1 year re - observation .",
    "field group 01 and 19 represent the earlier time - sampling method in the fsvs , while field group 25 represents the switch to a larger sampling set within a week observing run .",
    "the two time - sampling groups , 01 and 25 , were specifically investigated to understand the benefits gained by additional time - sampling .",
    "field groups 01 and 19 were found to be equivalent .    to generally determine if a source is variable , an evaluation of the probability that the deviations in a light curve are consistent with the photometric errors was made to provide a null - hypothesis test .",
    "violation of the null - hypothesis test indicates variability in the source . to determine",
    "if the deviation in a light curve is consistent with the photometric errors , a reduced @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) value is calculated with respect to a weighted mean magnitude .",
    "the weighted mean magnitude is given by @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the number of included observations in the mean , @xmath32 is the @xmath33 magnitude , @xmath34 is the @xmath33 photometric error .",
    "the probability in the @xmath29 , p(@xmath35 ) , is the calculated integral of the probability distribution function for @xmath28 . essentially , the p(@xmath29 ) is a measure of the probability that another set of measurements on the same source would yield a light curve of equal or greater @xmath28 in the fit .",
    "thus , if p(@xmath35 ) of the light curve is 0.01 , a confidence level of 99% can be ascribed , taken to be that the source is very likely variable .",
    "statistically , a confidence level of 99% also indicates that only 1 in 100 sources showing similar variations would be found variable due to random fluctuations and not true variability in the source .",
    "if the uncertainties were not appropriately accounted for or if largely deviant photometry points exist ( i.e. , cosmic ray hit ) , spurious detections of variability would result as was found in the 2xfwhm aperture photometry in the first case ( see figure 6 ; @xcite ) .",
    "violation of the null test to a threshold p(@xmath29 ) , or confidence level , would indicate that the light curve shows some form of variability .",
    "the p(@xmath29 ) has no dependence on time directly , only the number of sample points and amplitude variations with respect to the photometric uncertainties . to investigate the variability at different time - scales ,",
    "the sample was divided into time groups ; night , week , week with nightly averages , all data with the week averaged .",
    "the p(@xmath29 ) was then calculated separately for the separate time groups .",
    "there is also the occurrence that nightly or yearly time groups may have only 2 photometric points . in the case of only two sample points ,",
    "the number of sigma separation of the points can be used , but is not simulated here .",
    "table [ tab : tgrp ] summarizes the re - sampling time groups of the fsvs photometry .",
    "the time groups offer only a guideline to the variability time - scale sampled as will be shown in the following section on simulations .",
    "the true amplitude of the variability is also difficult to clearly assess with the sparse and incomplete time - sampling .",
    "thus , the amplitude of variability was determined simply by the @xmath36v peak - to - peak values for the time group .",
    "a set of fortran routines was developed for simulation of light curves to model fsvs data and determine an appropriate threshold for classifying a source as variable .",
    "the program allows for inclusion of the field sampling pattern and photometric uncertainties to a basic sinusoidal function .",
    "the fsvs field groups used were found to have similar photometric uncertainties for the run of time - sampled data , mostly equivalent to a @xmath37 value for the uncertainties or the measured uncertainties at each epoch .",
    "additionally added to the simulated time - sampled photometry was a gaussian distribution of noise to represent an unmeasured variation present in the data set .",
    "a standard deviation amplitude based on the half - width at half - maximum of the observed @xmath38 distribution in each field group was used for each @xmath3 magnitude group , @xmath00.33@xmath39 .",
    "a set of 10000 non - variable light curves was created for the @xmath3 magnitudes 18 , 20 , and 22 for field group 01 and 25 .",
    "table [ tab : nvstat ] presents a summary of the statistical test results in a percent of the fraction falsely detected as variable at p(@xmath29 ) thresholds ranging from 10@xmath40 to 10@xmath41 and the re - sampled time groups for an average .",
    "the magnitude range dependence over @xmath3=1822 was weak and thus incorporated into the average uncertainties .",
    "the false variability detections are obviously higher than statistically expected due to the added gaussian noise for the under - represented photometric uncertainty in the photometry . with the inclusion of the additional noise term ,",
    "the false detection percentage from the non - variable light curve simulations give a truer measure of the false detections expected in the fsvs light curves . as a significant effect",
    "is not found in comparing fsvs field group 01 and 25 with difference sample sizes , a similar threshold of p(@xmath29 ) is useful for any fsvs field .",
    "a set of 10000 variable light curves for each field group was generated using a sinusoidal function to the non - variable configuration described above to test the sensitivity of the fsvs to detect variability .",
    "the periods ranged from 12 minutes to 600 days , similar to possible periods detectable by the fsvs and having scientific significance ( e.g. , flickering in accretion processes and g - mode pulsations in white dwarfs , to long period variables ) .",

    "simulated light curves were generated with periods ranging from 90 minutes to 600 days and show less sensitivity to variability on time - scales on the order of the 24 hour cycle and 30 days and longer as the number of observations become very sparse .",

    "a large sample , 56 , observations in one night , followed by a a similar size sample in a neighboring night would greatly benefit the determination of periods on hour time - scales . adding",
    "23 observations throughout the entire observing run would provide a better sample for day time - scales .",

    "would provide a better sample for week or greater time - scales .",
    "another weakness of this gradient form is the degraded coverage of fast features with long separations ( i.e. , eclipsing binaries and fast outbursts ) that would require even more extended sampling to improve upon .",
    "however , the trade - off in time - sampling is areal sky coverage , which in turn would relatively reduced the areal coverage from 5.2 to 1.7 square degrees in going from 1015 to 2530 epochs as found in the fsvs sample .    using two fsvs field groups ,",
    "the distribution of variability over magnitude , color , and galactic latitudes was investigated .",
    "the variability fraction as a function of @xmath3 magnitude ( 17.522.0 mag ) is found to be 58% in the fsvs in both the mid- and high galactic latitude field groups .",
    "the variability fraction is dominated by the @xmath60.05 mag amplitude sources in field group 01 set ( 0.1 mag in field group 19 ) to @xmath3@xmath019 mag and is likely not due to the increasing photometric uncertainties as shown by the light curve simulations .",

    "the @xmath4 variability fraction plot divided up into rough @xmath3 magnitude bins reveals the @xmath4 peak occurs at all @xmath3 magnitudes at the longer time - scales , but the peak at hour time - scales peaks for sources fainter than @xmath3@xmath019 mag .",
    "incorporation of the variable sources into a @xmath4 , @xmath19 color - color plot indicates the majority lying along the main sequence colors . at the redder end of the main sequence",
    "the sources are likely active g - m dwarfs .",
    "the results of the bahcall galaxy model @xcite predict 814% of the stars as evolved off the main sequence , thus , it may be reasonable to associate the @xmath4 peak sources as rr lyrae .",
    "a study of rr lyrae stars in the sdss by @xcite has found 148 candidates out of 100 sq .",
    "to r@xmath021 mag . if the bluer sources are truly pulsating stars , with @xmath3@xmath220 mag , then many of the sources will be near the edge of the halo @xcite . however , @xcite note that @xmath48 scuti stars ( population i type ) will begin to disappear around r@xmath613 mag for galactic latitudes @xmath230@xmath50 and the remaining class of sx phe ( population ii ) are only about 10% of @xmath48 scuti population .",

    "however , a much larger population of variable sources beyond a @xmath4 of 1.4 ( early m dwarf spectral type ) is found in comparison to @xcite and is not surprising as the fsvs samples a much larger volume at its magnitude limits . over the redder end of the color - color plot , g ",
    "m active dwarfs will likely contribute to the variability fraction due to starspots , chromospheric activity , and rotational effects .",
    "it is also possible for supernovae to be a constituent in the variability fractions .",

    "future work investigating the fsvs fields with the best time - sampling may be able to distinguish between short orbital modulation ( w uma , cvs ) and pulsational sources ( rr lyrae , @xmath48 scuti / sx phe ) .",
    "however , the overall number of sources found to be variable range from @xmath03070 per @xmath3 magnitude bin ( 15 - 35 in the bluer @xmath4 peak ) , providing an excess of sources even considering the populations of rr lyrae stars , @xmath48 scuti / sx phe stars , w uma binaries , and the smaller contributions from cvs and quasars . in future follow - up of these variable source , matching to sdss colors may provide some separation of source types @xcite , but better time - sampled photometry will provide the best identification and a data set to study the astrophysical parameters of the stellar sources ( i.e. , their periodicity ) .",
