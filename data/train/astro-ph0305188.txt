    "a examination of the distribution of galaxies in the local group ( e.g. , figure 3 by grebel 1999 ) clearly shows the density - morphology relationship for galaxies .",
    "the dwarf spheroidals are all located near the large mass concentrations of the large spirals , with the dwarf irregulars located at greater distances .",
    "one of the most useful ways to study the star formation and chemical evolution of a galaxy is to examine the elemental abundances and abundance ratios in its stars . in the magellanic clouds and the nearby dwarf spheroidals ,",
    "it is possible to determine the abundance of a wide range of elements from the red giant branch ( rgb ) stars , and since these stars have a range of metallicities and ages , then it is possible to build up a picture of the chemical evolution of those galaxies ; for more details see the contributions in this proceedings by hill , shetrone , and smith .",
    "the dwarf irregular galaxies appear to have undergone very little and very slow chemical evolution since they have very low nebular abundances ( down to 1/20 solar , e.g. , skillman 1989a ) .",
    "if dwarf galaxies are the corner stones for galaxy formation , as in the hierarchical structure simulations in the cold dark matter ( cdm ) scenarios , then the dwarf irregulars may be the cleanest remnants of the proto - galactic fragments from the high redshift universe .",
    "the dwarf irregular galaxies are too distant for detailed chemical abundance analyses of their rgb stars . however , there are relatively isolated , blue supergiants in these galaxies that are bright enough for detailed spectroscopy using the efficient spectrographs on the new 8 to 10-meter class telescopes .",
    "these stars are all young , thus we can not examine the build - up of elements from these systems as with the rgb stars , but we can examine the abundance of elements not available from nebular analyses ( e.g. , fe ) to examine the integrated chemical evolution in these systems to the present epoch",
    ".      0.1  dex / kpc , which is the same gradient found in the galaxy over a much larger scale ( smartt & rolleston 1997 ) .",
    "hollow squares show other nebular data ( pagel 1980 ) ; x s note the nebular results when the pilyugin ( 2001 ) r23 calibration is used ; + s note results for two nebulae ( hubble v and x ) from other authors .",
    "all of the data taken together ( of various qualities ) is consistent with no slope in the oxygen abundance .",
    ", width=377 ]    the closest , relatively isolated dwarf irregular galaxy is ngc6822 , with d@xmath1 @xmath2 0.5 mpc .",
    "a detailed color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) by gallart ( 1996a , b ) shows that the brightest blue supergiants in this galaxy are nearly 2 magnitudes brighter than the tip of the red giant branch . from keck - hires and vlt - uves spectroscopy",
    ", we showed that two stars located near the center of ngc6822 have oxygen and iron abundances that are in excellent agreement with the low nebular oxygen abundances ( venn 2001 ) ; i.e. , [ o / h ] = @xmath30.5 and [ fe / h ] = @xmath30.5 .",
    "preliminary analysis of a third star is in agreement with these results as well , though this star is located in the outer disk of the galaxy .",
    "an interesting sidelight to these abundances in ngc6822 is that the stellar and nebular oxygen results may show evidence for an abundance gradient .",
    "a marginal detection of a @xmath30.1 dex / kpc gradient can be seen from a least - squares linear fit to the stellar data with the nebular abundances derived only from hii regions where the oiii 4363 line is observed ; see fig .",
    "[ kvenn1 ] .",
    "this gradient is the same as that seen in the galactic disk over approximately 20  kpc , or @xmath210x larger distance than ngc6822 ( e.g. , smartt & rolleston 1997 ) .",
    "small scale abundance fluctuations , such as a gradient , are not expected in dwarf galaxies where it is thought that the mixing processes occur on short timescales to throughly mix the interstellar medium .",
    "confirmation of an abundance gradient would suggest much longer mixing timescales , _ in general _ , for newly processed material from sne",
    "ii and massive stars .",
    "the dwarf irregular galaxy wlm is more distant than ngc6822 at d@xmath4 @xmath2 1  mpc , but it also has lower foreground extinction putting the blue supergiants at similar magnitudes in both of these galaxies .",
    "the nebular abundances in wlm are much lower than in ngc6822 though .",
    "hodge & miller ( 1995 ) and skillman ( 1989a ) have analysed three hii regions ( totalled ) ; the oiii 4363 is detected and the results are in good agreement with one another at [ o / h ] = @xmath30.9 .",
    "thus , this galaxy is about four times _ more metal - poor than the smc _ , making it one of the most metal - poor galaxies in the local group and suggesting that its chemical evolution has been quite slow .",
    "spectra of two a - type supergiants were obtained with the vlt+uves and analysed using standard techniques ( venn 2003 ) .",
    "the stars have [ fe / h ] = @xmath30.4 , which is nearly 3 @xmath5 higher than the nebular oxygen abundance .",
    "in fact , this metallicity is in better agreement with the results from ngc6822 , which can be seen directly by comparing a portion of the spectra from the two stars in wlm to a star with similar parameters in ngc6822 ( see fig .",
    "refkvenn3 ) .",
    "the wlm stellar oxygen abundance is even higher , [ o / h ] = @xmath30.2 , but this was determined directly from only one star ; spectrum synthesis for this one star is shown in fig .",
    "the radial velocities and stellar parameters do support that these stars are members of wlm .",
    "the question then is how can these young stars be more metal - rich than the nebulae ?",
    "6147 and @xmath66149 , and the three oi lines near @xmath66158 in wlm-15 .",
    "the best fits to the data are for [ fe / h ] = @xmath30.4 and [ o / h ] = @xmath30.2 . the synthesis for an oxygen abundance that is 0.3  dex larger is shown ( too large ) , as well as the nebular oxygen abundance ( too small).,width=377 ]    at present , the most likely scenario is that there are large scale abundance variations in wlm .",
    "the two stars are located on the south - east side of the galaxy , whereas the nebular are in the central - west portions . if this is an edge on disk galaxy as suggested by its hi rotation curve ( j. cannon , _ private communication _ ) , then their positions within wlm could be even further apart",
    ". however , this galaxy is also significantly smaller than ngc6822 ; it has about 1/10 the mass and radius",
    ". it would be surprising to find such large abundance variation in wlm and not have seen them in ngc6822 .",
    "other possibilities seem even more unlikely though , e.g , dilution through the recent merger of a large hi cloud ( merger would have needed to occur _",
    "after _ the stars formed only 10 myr ago ) , or variations in the interstellar gas - to - dust ratio ( such as large amounts of oxygen locked in dust grains ) .",
    "it is not clear yet what the difference in the stellar and nebular abundances are telling us .",
    "is there something peculiar about wlm , or is this result telling us something general about chemical evolution , nucleosynthesis , or abundance measurements ?",
    "the evolution of the chemical abundances in a galaxy is intimately linked to its star formation history .",
    "different elements are produced during the evolution of stars of different masses , and over a range of timescales .",
    "if the star formation in a galaxy proceeds by a series of bursts , rather than smooth , approximately constant star formation , then this should lead to clear differences in the evolution of the chemical abundances .",
    "one ratio of particular importance is the @xmath0/fe ratio , typically characterized by [ o / fe ] .",
    "oxygen is produced primarily in the high - mass stars of negligible lifetimes and ejected by sne ii , while iron is produced in both sne ii and sne ia .",
    "stars that form shortly after the interstellar medium has been enriched by sne ii may have enriched [ @xmath0/fe ] ratios , while those that form sometime after the sne ia contribute will have lower [ @xmath0/fe ] . for more details , see the contributions in this proceedings by matteucci and chiappini .",
    "since bursts of star formation allow sne ii to contribute @xmath0-elements , and long quiescent periods allow sne ia to contribute iron , then the total [ @xmath0/fe ] ratios in a galaxy should be able to vary over time .",
    "gilmore & wyse ( 1991 ) wrote `` _ there is nothing special or universal about solar element ratios , and one should not expect _ [ solar abundances ] _ in any other environment which has had a different star formation history _ '' .",
    "nevertheless , ngc6822 has had a significantly different star formation history from the solar neighbourhood ( see gallart 1996a , b ) , and yet its young stars and nebulae have the solar ratio of [ o / fe ] .",
    "the same is true for the magellanic clouds ( e.g. , hill 1997 , 1999 ; hill 1995 ; venn 1999 ; rolleston 2003 ) .",
    "a comparison of the star formation histories for the magellanic clouds ( e.g. , pagel & tautvaisiene 1998 ) and ngc6822 ( gallart 1996a , b ) suggests that ngc6822 has had almost the opposite star formation history ( more old and intermediate - aged stars , few stars forming in the past 5  gyr , until a recent burst within the past 1  gyr )",
    ". how do such different systems result in similar ratios , and why are they all near solar ?",
    "/fe ] versus [ fe / h ] to illustrate some of the possibilities from different star formation histories and/or different star formation rates .",
    "the solid line represents the trend in abundance ratios for galactic stars .",
    "the short dashed lines represent a smaller star formation event where the same peak sne ii [ @xmath0/fe ] ratio is reached after an initial star formation epoch but at a lower metallicity such that the sne ia can contribute significant amounts of iron sooner in the chemical evolution . at some later time , a new burst of star formation might increase [ @xmath0/fe ] back to the peak sne ii ratio . alternatively , a very slow star formation rate such as in dwarf galaxies may allow the sne ia to contribute at very low metallicities , such that [ @xmath0/fe ] approaches the solar ratio sooner .",
    ", width=377 ]    matteucci ( 2002 ) had discussed the components that determine galactic evolution and notes that while the star formation history is important in determining absolute abundances at any given time , it is less important when determining abundance ratios . for ratios ,",
    "the stellar lifetimes , imf , and nucleosynthesis yields are critical .",
    "thus , galaxies with low star formation rates either in bursts or continuous should show a short plateau in [ @xmath0/fe ] at low metallcities ( irregulars and spirals ) , whereas galaxies with high star formation rates early in thier lifetimes will have longer plateaus ( bulges , and ellipticals ) . a cartoon sketch based on matteucci s ( 2002 )",
    "figure  1 is shown in fig .",
    "[ kvenn4 ] , where we have also added the potential effects of a strong intermediate - aged burst following gilmore & wyse ( 1991 ) . that all chemical evolution models for all systems tend towards the solar ratio at the present epoch is interesting , and suggests that stellar lifetimes , nucleosynthetic yields , and the imf , are universal ; possibly also that mixing is efficient throughout these galaxies on a relatively short timescale ( @xmath21 gyr ) .",
    "it is remarkable that any star formation that occurs after the initial epoch seems to have little influence on the present - day ratio , although this may also be related to the metallicity having already increased to the point where the addition of new atoms simply does nt affect the total abundance very much .",
    "/fe ] ratios for young stars in the dwarf irregular galaxies and the magellanic clouds , compared to galactic stars .",
    "filled symbols with errorbars are the mean of the young supergiant abundances , in order of increasing metallicity , in sextans a , gr8 , smc , ngc6822 , wlm , and the lmc ( references in text ) .",
    "two @xmath5 errors are plotted for the sextans  a and gr  8 stars because that work is still in progress .",
    "hollow circles represent galactic data ( edvardsson 1993 ; nissen 1997 ; stephens 1999 ; gratton & sneden 1988 , 1991 , 1994 ; mcwilliam 1995 ) . ,",
    "width=377 ]    this scenario might also help to explain why our preliminary results from two more metal - poor dwarf irregular galaxies , sextans  a and gr  8 , also have solar - like [ @xmath0/fe ] ratios ; see fig .",
    "[ kvenn5 ] . unlike wlm ,",
    "our preliminary stellar abundances in individual a - type supergiants in sextans  a and gr  8 from vlt+uves are consistent with the low metallicity determined from their hii regions ( van zee , skillman & hanes 1999 ; skillman 1989b ) for both oxygen _ and _ iron .",
    "the abundance ratios for wlm and ngc6822 are taken from the work discussed above .",
    "the abundance ratios for the young stars in the lmc and smc are taken from the literature for b - dwarfs to red giants , which are usually in excellent agreement ( e.g. , rolleston 2003 ; venn 1999 ; hill 1997 , 1999 ; luck 1998 ) .",
    "we also plot the [ @xmath0/fe ] ratio in dwarf spheroidal galaxies ( shetrone 2001 , 2003 ) and damped ly@xmath0 systems ( dlas , ledoux 2002 ) ; see fig .",
    "[ kvenn6 ] .",
    "again , we see that the ratios are lower than those in the galactic metal - poor stars in all of these systems . since the star formation histories are signficantly different between each of these systems , e.g. , some dwarf spheroidals seem to have formed all of their stars @xmath710 gyr ago ( sculptor ) , while others have undergone distinct burst of star formation at intermediate ages ( carina ) , and the dwarf irregulars are still undergoing strong star formation events , then it is impressive that they all have similar low [ @xmath0/fe ] ratios .",
    "/fe ] ratios for stars in the dwarf irregulars ( red circles ) , dwarf spheroidals ( green squares ) , and dlas ( black triangles ) , compared to galactic stars .",
    "clearly the [ @xmath0/fe ] ratio does not reach the peak sne ii contribution in any of these systems .",
    "but also , the stars in these systems rarely show subsolar [ @xmath0/fe ] .",
    "see text and fig .",
    "[ kvenn5 ] for references.,width=377 ]    a few systems may show the plateau in the [ @xmath0/fe ] ratios explected in their metal - poor stars when individual elements are examined ; in particular the lmc and sculptor may show the plateau in [ mg / fe ] in their oldest stars ( see the conference contributions by hill , shetrone , and smith in this proceedings ) .. that [ mg / fe ] may differ from the mean [ @xmath0/fe ] suggests the formation of mg should be considered separately from heavier @xmath0-elements such as ca and ti .",
    "also , the fact that most stars in the dwarf spheroidals show @xmath0-element ratios below the plateau suggests that they all have sne ia contributions , thus star formation had to be longer than the timescale for sne ia enrichment and mixing into the interstellar medium .",
    "finally , two stars in the dwarf spheroidals do appear to have [ @xmath0/fe ] that is less than solar .",
    "these are carina - m3 ( shetrone 2003 ) and sextans-58 ( shetrone 2001 ) .",
    "tolstoy ( 2003 ) estimate the ages for these stars from their red giant position on the cmd ; carina - m3 is 13 @xmath83 gyr and sextans-58 is @xmath26 gyr . while ages are not very well constrained",
    ", sextans-58 is the youngest star analysed in that galaxy which may suggest its chemical evolution has pushed its abundance ratios below the solar value .",
    "carina - m3 is not young though , it is one of the oldest stars analysed in that galaxy .",
    "however , carina has had a very complex star formation history with at least three distinct star formation epochs .",
    "perhaps the chemical evolution of this galaxy evolved to subsolar ratios before the intermediate - aged burst of star formation raised [ @xmath0/fe ] again .",
