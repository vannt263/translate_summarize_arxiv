    "it is generally believed that qcd describes the strong interaction of quarks and gluons .",
    "qcd is , however , very complicated to investigate .",
    "therefore , it is useful to study at first similar , but simpler models and apply the related knowledge gained to the real situation . the most frequently studied toy models for this 3 + 1 dimensional theory are the 1 + 1 dimensional models , e.g. the non - linear o(@xmath1 ) @xmath2 model in two dimensions , which have also found wide applications in the framework of the lattice field theory .",
    "they have not only the simple theoretical structure , but also are , due to low dimensionality , simple to simulate numerically .",
    "another high interest in these two - dimensional models is to be found in perturbation theory which plays an important conceptual and practical role in lattice field theory .",
    "however , the evaluation of lattice feynman diagrams is , in general , not easy . on the lattice",
    "the integrands become non - trivial function of internal and external momenta , which makes it difficult to apply the standard tools in continuum perturbation theory .",
    "a few years ago , lscher and weisz @xcite suggested a new position space method for the evaluation of lattice feynman diagrams in four dimensional yang - mills theories , inspired by the observation of vohwinkel  @xcite that the free lattice propagator can be calculated recursively by its values around origin .",
    "their method concerns a technique of computing feynman integrals in the coordinate space which allows to obtain very accurate results with little effort and small amount of computer time . in our work on the computation of four - loop @xmath3 function in the two - dimensional non - linear o(@xmath1 ) @xmath2 model @xcite , we have made extensive use of this technique . since we have found it very useful , we would like , in the present paper , to describe the method in the case of two dimensions .",
    "this will be done by choosing some typical diagrams and evaluating them explicitly .    to illustrate the basic ideas to be discussed in the present paper",

    "there are a few known conventional computer programs available to compute this integral .",
    "the numerical accuracy which can be achieved by these methods is , however , strongly limited and thus they are not very useful if one requires to have results with high precision . considering the integral in position space , however , provides us with a new possibility to compute it very accurately with high efficiency .    in position space",

    "after differentiation , @xmath8 falls off like @xmath9 and the sum ( [ b1sum ] ) is therefore absolutely convergent . in principle , one can then compute @xmath10 by summing over all points of @xmath7 up to some finite value , e.g. @xmath11 .",
    "however , since the convergence is slow , one requires to sum over large range of @xmath7 if one would like to have precise result .",
    "taking the limited computing availability into account , this is , of course , not the most efficient way . by studying the large @xmath7 behavior of the propagator @xmath0 , it is however possible to improve on the accuracy systematically until the desired level of precision is reached .",
    "it is the aim of the present paper to show how this can be done .    in next section",
    "we discuss the properties of the free propagator @xmath0 and , in particular , derive a recursion relation which allows us to express the propagator as a linear combination of its values near origin .",
    "these results will then be applied to the computation of lattice sums in section  [ secets ] where we take various examples to illustrate the procedure .",
    "it turns out that the method is quite efficient and gives very accurate results .",
    "finally , in section  [ secpdp ] we present a little more subtle case of evaluating feynman diagrams with non - zero external momenta , particularly in the continuum limit .",
    "the usefulness of the position space method in this case as well is demonstrated by dealing with a number of diagrams explicitly .",
    "we conclude the paper by including some detailed computations in a series of appendices to make it more readable .    [ [ section ] ] -    in this section we prepare for the main work in the next two sections where we show how the position space technique can be applied to the evaluation of feynman diagrams .",
