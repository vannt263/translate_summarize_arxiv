    "1995 ; patience et al .",
    "1998 ) , using speckle and occultation techniques .",
    "similar surveys of the hyades cluster found a smaller fraction of 0.30 @xmath6 0.06 , and a still lower fraction of 0.14 @xmath6 0.03 for g dwarfs in the solar neighborhood ( patience et al .",
    "1998 ) , suggesting an evolutionary effect and/or environmental effects during formation .",
    "deeply embedded class i and class 0 protostars can not be surveyed using similar techniques , since they are not visible at optical wavelengths and are generally too deeply embedded even at infrared wavelengths .",
    "millimeter / sub - millimeter - wavelength interferometry at sub - arcsecond resolution can resolve close companions if they have circumstellar disks .",
    "for example , l1551 irs5 was recently shown to be a binary based on 7 mm interferometric observations at the vla ( rodrguez et al .",
    "we present here evidence that l1551 ne also has a binary companion .",
    "l1551ne ( b1950 @xmath7 + @xmath8 ( draper , warren - smith & scarrott 1985 ) ) is a young stellar object in the l1551 molecular cloud , at a distance of 160 pc ( snell 1981 ) .",
    "discovered by emerson et al .",
    "( 1984 ) from iras data , it is the second brightest embedded source in the taurus complex after l1551 irs5 , with l@xmath9 .",
    "it has a molecular outflow ( moriarty - schieven , butner & wannier 1995 ) .",
    "the radial density distribution of l1551ne has been modeled by barsony & chandler ( 1993 ) from 800@xmath10 images , and by butner et al .",
    "( 1995 ) from 100@xmath10 and 200@xmath10 observations .",
    "both found that the density distribution implied by the radial intensity profile was much shallower than the @xmath11 predicted by the `` inside - out '' collapse model of terebey , shu & cassen ( 1984 ) .",
    "moriarty - schieven , butner & wannier ( 1995 ) have suggested that l1551 ne may be a class 0 source .",
    "the observations were taken with the owens valley radio observatory millimeter - wave array 1994 november 12 and 1997 january 17 , at a wavelength of 1.3 mm ( 230.65 ghz ) .",
    "the 1994 observations were taken with the array ( consisting at the time of six 10 m antennae ) in the compact `` @xmath12 '' configuration ( maximum baseline 115 m , minimum baseline 30 m ) , and in 1997 the data were taken using the extended `` @xmath13 '' configuration ( maximum baseline 241.7 m , minimum baseline 35 m ) .",
    "the effective resolution of the synthesized beam was @xmath02  and @xmath01  for the two configurations .",
    "the observations were made in `` snapshot '' mode , with a series of ten minute integrations interspersed with observations of other sources and the phase calibrators ( 0528 + 134 and 3c84 ) , to yield a total integration time of @xmath01 hour in the `` @xmath12 '' configuration and @xmath02 hours in the `` @xmath13 '' configuration .",
    "the system temperatures were @xmath01200k and @xmath01600k respectively .",
    "neptune was used as the primary flux calibrator .",
    "the continuum bandwidth is 1ghz .",
    "the data were reduced using the standard reduction package `` mma '' , and then exported to aips which was used to generate and clean images ( using the ` imagr ' task and uniform weighting ) .",
    "the clean box included only a small area covering the main source and the apparent binary companion .",
    "the angular resolution of the cleaned image was 1.29  @xmath2 1.07  at position angle -74@xmath14 .",
    "figure 1 presents a contour image of l1551ne .",
    "clearly seen are the primary source ( henceforth source a ) at ( b1950 ) 04@xmath1528@xmath1650.552@xmath17 18@xmath140209.85  , and another weaker source 1.43  to the southeast ( source b ) .",
    "emission also appears to extend to the north and to the east of the primary source , and surrounding source b.    to verify that we are seeing real sources and not phase instabilities , we generated images using the same techniques of another source , iras 04169 + 2702 , which was observed during the same two days and interspersed with l1551ne .",
    "phase errors would be manifested as `` anomalous '' sources or structures .",
    "no such anomalous sources are seen in the image of iras 04169 + 2702 .",
    "in addition , we cleaned the `` @xmath12 '' configuration data separately from the `` @xmath13 '' configuration data .",
    "the high - resolution data clearly had two peaks , while the low - resolution data showed an extended disk - like structure with long axis through the line joining the two sources .",
    "thus we believe that the structure seen here in l1551ne is real .    in table 1",
    "we present the positions , sizes and flux densities of the sources . the single - dish flux density at 1.35 mm is also shown .",
    "there are three distinct components apparent in the image shown in figure 1 ; a brighter , possibly extended source at the field center ( source a ) , a weaker , probably point - like source ( b ) 1.43  south - east of a , and diffuse , low - level emission which appears to surround both sources and extend @xmath02  to the northwest and east of a.    sources a and b were fit with elliptical gaussians using the _ aips _ task jmfit .",
    "the primary source a was found to have a size 1.53x1.28  ( i.e. it may have been slightly resolved with a size @xmath18 larger than the beamsize ) , peak intensity @xmath0 0.33 jy and integrated intensity @xmath0 0.47 jy ( i.e. @xmath040% ( @xmath19 ) larger than the peak intensity ) . if it is slightly resolved ( deconvolved size @xmath0 0.82x0.70  ) , then its size is @xmath0131x112 a.u . at a distance of 160pc .",
    "source b is located 1.43  ( 229 a.u . at 160pc ) south - east of a , and its size and intensity are consistent with it being unresolved , i.e. @xmath1100 a.u .",
    "we estimate the mass within each source using @xmath20 , and display these in table 1 .",
    "we used the integrated flux densities , assumed a distance of 160 pc ( snell 1981 ) , used dust temperature of 42k ( moriarty - schieven et al .",
    "1994 ) , and dust emissivities from hildebrand ( 1983 ) @xmath21  g  @xmath22 , assuming @xmath23 = 1 ( moriarty - schieven et al .",
    "1994 ) , and have assumed a gas to dust mass ratio of 100 .",
    "the derived masses are approximately 0.044 and 0.014 m@xmath4 for the emission from source a and b respectively , and 0.022m@xmath4 for the envelope .",
    "the total mass for the two sources plus envelope is @xmath00.078 m@xmath4 .",
    "rodrguez , anglada & raga ( 1995 ) imaged the l1551ne region at @xmath243.5c m and found a continuum source located within 1.5@xmath25 of our source a. rodrguez et al attribute the @xmath243.5 cm emission to shocks associated with the outflow ( moriarty - schieven , butner & wannier 1995 ) .",
    "thus source a is the likely origin of the l1551ne outflow .",
    "rodrguez et al .",
    "found a possible second source located @xmath00.6  east of a , which is not coincident with our source b , for which no @xmath243.5 cm emission was detected .",
    "if their source 0.6  east of a is real , this would suggest that l1551ne is at least a triple star system .",
    "however , another protostar capable of generating an outflow jet should have had a circumstellar disk large enough to be detected by our observations .",
    "possibly the eastern @xmath243.5 cm source is due to a jet from a but offset from the source , or is a background object .",
    "the single - dish flux density ( butner et al . 2000 ) found using the 14 m jcmt telescope ( fwhm 20  ) ) is not significantly different from the total intensity found in our image of l1551ne ( primary beam fwhm 28  ) .",
    "thus only a small amount , if any , of the single - dish flux can have been resolved out by the interferometer .",
    "however , considerable extended emission was seen at @xmath0850 @xmath26 m by barsony & chandler ( 1993 ) and moriarty - schieven et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , and at 200 @xmath26 m by butner et al .",
    "barsony & chandler and butner et al . modeled this extended emission as an envelope whose",
    "radial density distribution decreases very slowly with distance from the protostar .",
    "weak , low - level emission can be seen extending @xmath01 - 2  to the north and east of source a , and perhaps encompassing source b. this extended structure has a disk - like appearance , of dimension @xmath27 ( @xmath0800x300pc with long axis at position angle @xmath0 - 12@xmath14 .",
    "this is roughly perpendicular to the axis of the conical reflection nebula emanating from l1551ne ( draper et al .",
    "1985 ; hodapp 1995 ) , and hence of the molecular outflow ( moriarty - schieven et al .",
    "this disk - like structure may represent a circum - binary disk .",
