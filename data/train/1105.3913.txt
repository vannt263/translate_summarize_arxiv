    "predator - prey models are important tools that help us to understand the bio and ecosystems surrounding us @xcite .",
    "an important aspect of the model is how the predator interacts with the prey @xcite , which can be described by a functional response that specifies the rate of feeding of predator upon prey as a function of the prey density .",
    "the existence of traveling wave solutions is an interesting feature in population dynamics and plays an important role in understanding the long time asymptotic properties of such systems . in his pioneering works @xcite ,",
    "dunbar obtained the existence of several kinds of traveling wave solutions for diffusive predator - prey systems with type i and type ii functional responses .",
    "he considered the existence of small amplitude periodic traveling waves , and `` heteroclinic traveling waves '' that correspond to heteroclinic orbits connecting equilibrium - to - equilibrium or equilibrium - to - periodic orbits .",
    "the methods used by dunbar include the invariant manifold theory , the shooting method , hopf bifurcation analysis , and lasalle s invariance principle .",
    "huang et al .",
    "@xcite extended the work in @xcite to @xmath0 by using dunbar s method in @xcite .",
    "an interesting question is whether those results can be extended to a system with type iii functional response .",
    "recently , li et al .",
    "@xcite proved the existence of traveling waves in a diffusive predator - prey system with a simplified type iii functional response @xmath1 by employing the method similar to that used in @xcite .    the shooting method used by dunbar",
    "is based on a variant of wazewski s theorem @xcite .",
    "similar to the original wazewski set , dunbar s wazewski set @xmath2 has the property that there is an orbit starting from the unstable manifold of an equilibrium and staying in @xmath2 in the future .",
    "however , the wazewski set @xmath2 constructed in @xcite was unbounded . in order to ensure the boundedness of the orbit ,",
    "several additional lemmas ( see lemma 7 in @xcite , lemma 10 in @xcite , lemma 15 in @xcite ) were proved to rule out the possibility that the constructed orbit may escape to infinity . although the topological idea of shooting method in @xcite is clear and elegant , the use of unbounded sets @xmath2 in @xmath3 or @xmath0 makes the argument long and hard to read .",
    "therefore , it is highly desirable to construct a simple , bounded wazewski set @xmath2 and use the original wazewski s theorem to simplify the proof of the existence of heteroclinic traveling waves related to various predator - prey systems .",
    "another improvement is that in the proof of the existence of type i traveling waves , we are able to treat the two cases @xmath4 and @xmath5 together , while in dunbar s original work , @xmath5 was treated by taking a sequence @xmath6 and looking for convergence of the sequence of traveling wave solutions .",
    "finally , let @xmath7 , which is the quotient of the predator natural death rate verses the prey growth rate .",
    "we have obtained an exact threshold value @xmath8 . if @xmath9 , the traveling waves are oscillatory .",
    "it means if @xmath10 is big , then the reason the limit of the wave exists is due to the balance of large death rate of predator compensated by the large growth rate of prey so the population can approach the interior equilibrium .",
    "this causes the greater rate of exchange of bio - mass between the predator and prey , therefore causes the oscillation . while if @xmath11 , the traveling waves are non - oscillatory .",
    "it means the predators possess enough food to consume or have low death rate and then leads to the population density monotonically increasing . in dunbar s article ,",
    "only a lower estimate for the threshold is given .",
    "consider the following diffusive predator - prey system @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the population densities of the prey and predator respectively .",
    "the functional response of the system is more general and biologically useful than those in previous works . to the best of our knowledge",
    ", no rigorous work has been done on the existence of traveling wave solutions for system .",
    "the shooting technique has been an important method in proving the existence of traveling waves solutions , e.g. , see @xcite and the references therein . the method used in this paper",
    "is motivated by the techniques used there . however , as mentioned above , we shall construct a bounded set @xmath2 to replace the unbounded wazewski set introduced in @xcite .",
    "assume that our system has 3 equilibria @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 . instead of the extended wazewski s theorem used in @xcite , we shall use the original wazewski s topological principle as in @xcite to prove the existence of an orbit connecting @xmath16 and @xmath17 in @xmath2 .",
    "we first exam the flow on the surfaces of @xmath2 to determine its egress sets .",
    "then we construct a curve @xmath18 on the two dimensional unstable manifold with two endpoints in two disjoint egress sets .",
    "we show that there is a point on @xmath19 such that the orbit started from this point will remain in @xmath2 by using theorem 2.1 in hartman @xcite .",
    "a liapunov function is constructed to prove that any orbit that remains in @xmath2 shall approach an invariant set in @xmath2 while the maximal invariant set in @xmath2 is @xmath17 .",
    "thus the solution that stays in @xmath2 will approach the positive equilibrium @xmath17 .",
    "in other words , it is a heteroclinic orbit connecting the unstable equilibrium @xmath16 to @xmath17 .",
    "we also show the existence of traveling wave solution connecting @xmath15 to @xmath17 .",
    "our method is more straightforward than the shooting technique used in @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we assume @xmath20 .",
    "it is the limiting case where the prey species diffuses much slower than the predator species , e.g. , a plant species being consumed by a relatively mobile herbivore .",
    "the case @xmath21 is nonzero and small can be handle by the singular perturbation method and will appear in a separate paper ( wu et al . in preparation ) .",
    "to write system in a non - dimensional form , we rescale the variables @xmath22 by dropping the primes on @xmath23 for notational convenience , becomes @xmath24 where @xmath25 .",
    "let @xmath26 .",
    "we require that @xmath27 , which ensures has a positive equilibrium corresponding to the coexistence of the two species .",
    "it is easy to see that system has three spatially constant equilibria given by @xmath28}{u^*}. \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] by using the techniques described above , we will establish the existence of traveling wave solutions of system connecting the equilibria @xmath16 and @xmath17 ( type i wave ) , which is called the ",
    "waves of invasion \" ( see chow and tam @xcite , shigesada and kawasaki@xcite ) .",
    "this is of ecological interest since it corresponds to a situation where an environment is initially inhabited only by the prey species at its carrying capacity , the small invasion of the predators drives the system to a new stable state of co - existence of both species .",
    "we also establish the existence of traveling wave solutions of system connecting @xmath15 and @xmath17 ( type ii wave ) .",
    "this describes simultaneous spread of predator and prey into a new environment .",
    "moreover , a threshold property is given for the two types of traveling waves to be oscillatory or non - oscillatory .",
    "see theorem [ th2 ] for details .    the organization of the paper is as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we state our main results on the existence of traveling wave solutions .",
    "section 3 and section 4 are devoted to proving the existence or non - existence for type i and type ii waves , respectively . the construction of the wazewski set @xmath2",
    "will also be given in sections 3 and 4 . in section 5 ,",
    "we discuss the threshold property for the oscillation of the traveling waves in terms of @xmath10 , the quotient of the predator natural death rate verses the prey growth rate .",
    "a traveling wave solution of is a solution of the special form @xmath29 and @xmath30 , where @xmath31 and @xmath32 is the wave speed . substituting this solution into",
    ", we have the wave system @xmath33 note that also has three equilibria @xmath34 and @xmath35 , where @xmath15 corresponds to the absence of both species , @xmath16 corresponds to the prey at the environment carrying capacity in the absence of the predator , and @xmath17 corresponds to the co - existence of both species .",
