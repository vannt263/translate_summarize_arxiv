    "a bright soft x - ray enhancement in the monoceros and gemini constellations was first detected in rocket experiments over thirty years ago @xcite , and resolved into a shell - like structure by _",
    "heao-2 _ a decade later @xcite .",
    "spectral studies with _ rosat _ confirmed that this so - called ` monogem ring ' is a supernova remnant , probably in the adiabatic expansion phase @xcite .",
    "the distance is poorly constrained by evolutionary arguments  self - consistent sedov - taylor models were found by @xcite at all distances between 100 and 1300 pc  but distances around 300 pc are preferred on grounds of supernova energetics . at this distance , the model age is 86,000 years , explosion energy is @xmath1  erg , and current radius is 66 pc .",
    "the inferred interstellar medium density is @xmath2 , typical of the hot interstellar medium .",
    "the radio pulsar psr b0656 + 14 lies very close in projection to the center of the monogem ring , and an association between the objects seems natural @xcite .",
    "the pulsar is young , with a characteristic spin - down timescale of 110 kyr @xcite , pulsed non - thermal optical and x - ray emission , and unpulsed thermal x - ray emission consistent with a @xmath3 year - old cooling neutron star @xcite .",
    "but because the pulsar distance was estimated from interstellar dispersion measurements @xcite to be 760 pc  more than twice the best estimate for the remnant  and a proper motion measurement appeared to show the pulsar moving towards the center of the remnant @xcite , a physical association has been widely regarded as unlikely ( * ? ? ?",
    "* for example ) .",
    "new very long baseline interferometric measurements ( brisken et al .",
    "2003 ) lead us to reconsider this negative conclusion .",
    "the distance , now accurately known from parallax to be @xmath4  pc , is much lower than previously believed , and the proper motion , 44 mas / yr , is about 40% smaller . as we will show , these measurements , together with a re - examination of the x - ray data , convincingly demonstrate that the pulsar and remnant were born in a single supernova explosion about @xmath3 yrs ago .",
    "the monogem ring ( fig .",
    "1 ) shows significant deviations from circular symmetry , with what may be a blow - out to the west , away from the galactic plane , and a missing quadrant in the northwest , where foreground absorption is relatively high @xcite . because of the lack of symmetry , the morphological center of the ring is somewhat uncertain .",
    "for example , at low energy ( e.g. , the _ rosat _ r1 band image displayed as fig .  6 in plucinsky et al .",
    "1996 ) , the portion of the ring in the galactic plane is not readily visible , making the remnant appear smaller and offset slightly away from the plane ; the arc is evident in higher energy observations ( fig .",
    "1 , and also note fig .  8 of plucinsky et al .",
    "1996 ) , suggesting the importance of greater absorption on lines of sight near the plane .    in projection , the pulsar , at @xmath5 , lies well within the ring . to test the consistency of its position with the morphological center of the ring",
    ", we have fitted ` by eye ' a circle to the incomplete ring , centered on the pulsar .",
    "this fit , shown in fig .  1 , demonstrates that the pulsar s position is not inconsistent with the morphological center of the ring , within admittedly large uncertainties .    with the measured proper motion , 44 mas / yr",
    ", the pulsar has moved about @xmath6 in @xmath3  yrs , from roughly @xmath7 .",
    "this inferred birth position appears slightly further from the current center of the ring , but not unacceptably so .",
    "it is also important to distinguish the morphological center of the remnant from its true dynamical center : we should expect an old remnant expanding into a medium with density decreasing away from the galactic plane to have its apparent center offset from its explosion center in the direction away from the plane , just as observed @xcite .    in the end",
    ", we conclude that the pulsar position at birth was within a few degrees of the current morphological center of the ring .",
    "we note that the _ a priori _ likelihood of an unrelated background source projected within the ring falling this close to the center is about 5% .",
    "however , on its own the positional coincidence is a strong argument neither for nor against an association .",
    "the strongest argument against a physical association between the pulsar and remnant has been the pulsar distance , estimated at 760  pc from the measured column density of free electrons .",
    "sedov modeling formally allows a wide range of distances for the monogem ring , but a distance of about 300  pc has been preferred .",
    "although estimates of pulsar distances through interstellar dispersion are fairly crude ( the quoted uncertainty was 25% @xcite ) the distance discrepancy appeared significant . the small parallax distance , @xmath4  pc , thus came as a surprise .",
    "( we note , though , that the greater distance implied an unacceptably large thermal x - ray luminosity : an attempt to directly estimate the distance from x - ray modeling yielded @xmath8  pc or less @xcite . )    with this precise pulsar distance available , we consider whether the distance estimate for the remnant can also be improved .",
    "a strong interstellar o  vi absorption feature at @xmath9  km / s has been detected in the star 15  mon , in the southern region of the ring @xcite .",
    "the parallax distance of 15  mon is @xmath10  pc @xcite .",
    "because o  vi at such high velocity is rarely found in the disk , and the velocity is similar to that expected from a remnant at this stage , we consider this to be a secure upper limit to the distance of the monogem ring .",
    "other evidence suggests the ring is no farther than the pulsar .",
    "the absorption is low , @xmath11 @xcite , compared to @xmath12 for the pulsar @xcite .",
    "the pulsar dispersion measure is much higher than expected at a distance of 290 pc , suggesting a line of sight through a highly ionized region .",
    "it is also unlikely that the remnant is significantly closer than the pulsar . at an assumed distance of 300  pc ,",
    "the inferred explosion energy is already low : @xmath1  erg .",
    "a distance below 230  pc would imply an implausibly low energy , below @xmath13  erg .",
    "we conclude that the pulsar and remnant distances agree to within @xmath14  pc .",
    "indeed , since the shell radius is @xmath15  pc , the evidence is strong that the pulsar is currently within the expanding supernova shell .",
    "finally , we must consider the relative ages of the pulsar and remnant .",
    "the remnant age , from sedov modeling , has been estimated at 86,000  yrs for a distance of 300  pc .",
    "two lines of evidence suggest a comparable age for the neutron star .",
    "first , its current temperature is in good agreement with standard cooling models for a @xmath3  yr old neutron star @xcite .",
    "second , the characteristic spin - down timescale for the pulsar is @xmath16  yrs .",
    "the second argument deserves more comment .",
    "the age of a pulsar slowing with a torque proportional to a constant power @xmath17 of its frequency , @xmath18 , can be expressed as @xmath19,\\ ] ] where @xmath20 is the initial spin period . for magnetic - dipole braking ,",
    "the `` braking index '' @xmath21 , so if the pulsar is born spinning much faster than its current period , @xmath22 , while the age is overestimated if the pulsar were born near its current period .    for a handful of very young pulsars , where the braking index can be measured directly ,",
    "@xmath23 @xcite . for middle - aged pulsars , the good agreement between timing ages and so - called kinetic ages ( @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the height above the galactic plane ) requires a mean braking index near 3 @xcite .",
    "we acknowledge that the timing age can be misleading .",
    "several putative pulsar - snr associations suggest large discrepancies between timing and true ages : for example , psr j1012@xmath265226 , in the @xmath27  kyr old remnant pks 1209@xmath2651/52 , has a spin - down age of @xmath28  kyr @xcite , and psr j1811@xmath261925 , with a spin - down age of 24  kyr , has been associated with the snr of ad  386 @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , a recent comparison of kinetic and timing ages for 21 pulsars under 10  myr in age found a typical discrepancy of only @xmath29 @xcite . we conclude that both the timing and cooling ages of the pulsar are consistent with the remnant age .",
    "the angular position , distance , and age of the pulsar and remnant are all in excellent agreement with the hypothesis that both were born at the same location , @xmath30  pc away , @xmath3  yrs ago . the likelihood that this is merely a positional and temporal coincidence is extremely low . crudely estimating the galactic type ii supernova rate at one per century and the region within 300  pc of earth as @xmath31 of the area of the galactic disk , the mean supernova interval in this region is about 100  kyr .",
    "the chance that two unrelated supernovae occur within @xmath32  kyr , within @xmath33 on the sky , and within 50  pc in radial distance is vanishingly small .",
    "perhaps the most persuasive argument for an association comes from assuming the opposite . if this @xmath3  yr old remnant is not that of the supernova that formed the @xmath3  yr old pulsar , then where is the remnant of that supernova ?",
    "many old remnants are of course invisible because of distance or environment , but if the monogem ring and pulsar were formed in different supernovae then they occurred in very close physical and temporal proximity .",
    "the monogem ring itself is evidence that a remnant of age @xmath3 years expanding into this particular environment is visible at 300  pc .",
    "we conclude that a single supernova , 300  pc away and a hundred thousand years ago , formed both psr b0656 + 14 and the monogem ring .",
    "supernova remnants are generally believed to be acceleration sites for cosmic rays @xcite , and in this case it is intriguing to note that the monogem ring may hold a clue to a long - standing puzzle : the origin of the steepening in the primary cosmic - ray spectrum at about @xmath34  ev ( 3  pev ) , called the ` knee . '    between about @xmath35 and a few times @xmath36  ev , the differential cosmic ray energy spectrum is well - described by a broken power law , proportional to below the knee and above the knee .",
    "( a recent review can be found in @xcite . )",
    "possible explanations for the knee are extremely varied , including loss of the most energetic particles from the galaxy , unknown physical processes in the development of the atmospheric shower through which the cosmic rays are detected , or , most likely , a termination in the acceleration process .",
    "a typical cut - off energy for acceleration in supernova remnants is @xmath37  ev , where @xmath38 is the nuclear charge , though the exact cut - off will vary by perhaps an order of magnitude with variations in the explosion energy , magnetic field , interstellar medium density , and age @xcite .",
    "recently , erlykin and wolfendale ( ew ) have drawn attention @xcite to the sharpness of the knee feature , which has been a challenge for models in which the break arises from propagation effects or from a stochastic superposition of multiple sources with varying high - energy cut - offs .",
    "ew propose that around the knee a single nearby source dominates the cosmic ray spectrum , which is otherwise a smooth superposition of the contributions from many supernova remnants throughout the galaxy and from whatever sources provide the higher energy cosmic rays , up to @xmath39  ev and beyond . at energies of a few pev ,",
    "this single source alone produces 60% of the flux at earth .",
    "( this possibility has also recently been considered by other authors ( * ? ? ? * for example ) . )",
    "although the data are not yet conclusive , ew have identified the knee as most likely due to oxygen nuclei , with a smaller second break at about 10  pev due to iron nuclei .",
    "the shape and amplitude of the knee feature have led ew to predict @xcite that the single source is a 90100  kyr old supernova remnant between 300 and 350  pc from earth , expanding in an under - dense medium .",
    "the match with the properties of the monogem ring is striking , though almost certainly in part coincidental considering the large remaining uncertainties in cosmic ray acceleration and diffusion models .",
    "nevertheless , an important objection to the single source model for the knee feature has been the lack of a suitable source @xcite .",
    "that objection now appears to have been removed .",
