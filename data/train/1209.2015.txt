    "black hole solutions in modified theories of gravity ( namely @xmath0 gravity ) has received attentions in recent years @xcite .",
    "parallel to black holes there are studies on wormhole solutions in @xmath0 gravity as well @xcite . upon derivation of the necessary conditions for the existence of black holes in @xmath0 gravity @xcite , it will be in order to explore similar conditions for wormholes in the same theory .",
    "this amounts to make series expansions for functions around the throat radius ( @xmath2 ) of the wormhole .",
    "that is , any function @xmath3 can be expressed as @xmath4 such expansions are carried out for the ricci scalar @xmath5 @xmath6 @xmath7 and higher derivatives , as well as the pressure and density of the energy - momentum tensor .",
    "let us remind that even in the absence of external sources the curvature sources of @xmath0 theory remain intact .",
    "the reason for resorting these expansions is entirely physical : near the throat radius of a wormhole designated by @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) an observer does nt feel anything unusual so that the functions specifying all salient features are expressible in analytic functions .",
    "once these expansions are substituted into einstein s equations and zeroth , first and higher order terms in @xmath10 are identified automatic constraints emerge .",
    "these will comprise the necessary conditions for the existence of wormhole throats in any viable @xmath0 theory as a result of such a `` _ _ near - throat test _ _ '' . at the zeroth order the conditions are easily tractable and yield tangible results to say enough about an @xmath0 whether it admits a throat or not .",
    "we must note that the higher order terms , even the first one turns out to yield rather complicated relations in implementing the test . in this study",
    "we concentrate on an @xmath0 theory that admits at least a non - zero third order derivative , i.e. @xmath11 while all the rest will be dictated by einstein s equations . in this study our ansatz metric involves two unknown metric functions to be determined : the redshift function @xmath12 and the shape function @xmath13 . upon expansions aforementioned in powers of ( @xmath14 )",
    "there will be severe restrictions on these functions .",
    "the simpler case consists of choosing @xmath12 as constants , however , herein this will not be our strategy .",
    "one thing observed is that in the absence of matter sources the weak energy condition ( wec ) is violated in the construction of wormholes . to overcome this problem",
    "we introduce external energy - momentum and search for the satisfaction of the energy conditions .",
    "we find that wec holds true while the strong energy condition ( sec ) becomes valid under more stringent regulations .",
    "integration of @xmath0 incorporates constants that are related to the cosmological constant and with / without that constant validity of our energy conditions remains still valid .",
    "after we determine the redshift and shape functions analytically we embed our geometry into the ( @xmath15 ) sector with the embedding function @xmath16 the shape of our traversable wormhole is depicted in fig . 1 for the particular throat radius @xmath17",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we introduce our formalism of expansion around the throat in a generic @xmath0 theory .",
    "section iii extends / generalizes the formalism in the presence of external matter sources . with conclusion in section",
    "iv we complete the paper .",
    "we start with a general action for @xmath0 gravity written as@xmath18 in which @xmath19 and @xmath20 is a real arbitrary function of the ricci scalar @xmath21 obviously , in the presence of physical sources the action is to be supplemented by a matter part @xmath22 the @xmath23dimensional standard form of the wormhole line element in spherical symmetry is given by @xcite@xmath24where @xmath12 and @xmath25 are the redshift and shape functions , respectively .",
    "the throat of the wormhole is located at @xmath26 at which @xmath27 and radial coordinate @xmath28 is larger than @xmath29 we note that @xmath12 and @xmath30 in addition to @xmath5 @xmath0 and its higher derivatives should also satisfy constraints to have a traversable wormhole .",
    "these conditions for @xmath31 and @xmath12 are : i ) @xmath32 ii ) @xmath33 for @xmath34 and iii ) @xmath35 must not have any root ( horizon ) i.e. , @xmath36 must be finite everywhere .",
    "variation of the action with respect to the metric yields the field equation@xmath37 in which @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "the field equations explicitly read as@xmath40@xmath41@xmath42which are independent .",
    "note that the @xmath43 equation is identical with @xmath44 equation . by adding the four equations ( i.e.",
    ", @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath44 and @xmath43 ) we find @xmath47which is the trace of eq .",
    "our method to solve these equations is as follows : first , we consider the ricci scalar as a series about the throat i.e. , @xmath48 in which @xmath49 .",
    "herein and in the sequel a prime stands for the derivative with respect to @xmath28 and a sub @xmath50 implies that such a quantity is evaluated at the throat .",
    "next , we expand all other functions involved in the field equations i.e. , @xmath51and finally by equating different powers of @xmath52 we find all coefficients in terms of @xmath53 @xmath54 @xmath55 . in zeroth order",
    "we find @xmath56while to first order in @xmath52 we obtain@xmath57@xmath58we note that in our solution @xmath59 and @xmath60 are not specified . as one can see from the line element @xmath59 can be absorbed into the redefinition of time @xmath61 so we set it to be zero .",
    "on the other hand @xmath60 is a principal constant which we leave free so that other constants can be expressed in terms of it i.e. , @xmath62 and so on .",
    "clearly this is just the zeroth order approximation and it can not be considered for the generic solution .    in order to find the conditions @xmath25 must satisfy we start with @xmath63 which implies@xmath64the other condition i.e. , @xmath33 for @xmath34 is automatically satisfied since@xmath65and for small @xmath52 it leads to @xmath66 which is assumed valid .",
    "the last condition which constrains @xmath12 to be finite takes the form @xmath67this is guaranteed if @xmath52 is small enough to keep @xmath68 finite together with @xmath66 .",
    "now let s consider the energy conditions .",
    "if we directly write the field equations in the form of standard einstein equation@xmath69 in which @xmath70 stands for the einstein s tensor , with  @xmath71\\]]and @xmath72 is the external stress energy tensor which in the present case is zero .",
    "next , we consider the energy density @xmath73 and the pressure components produced by the geometry of @xmath0 gravity in the form @xcite@xmath74 .\\]]after some manipulation we find at the throat ( i.e. from the zeroth order einstein s equations ) @xmath75@xmath76and @xmath77it is observed that imposing @xmath78 makes @xmath73 positive but @xmath79 remain negative and in any case @xmath80 is negative .",
    "note that it may be this negative pressure that protects the wormhole against collapse . from the summation of ( 25 ) and ( 26 ) it can be seen easily that the weak energy condition ( wec ) which says that @xmath81 and @xmath82 is violated . in the next section",
    "we may avert this situation by adding external sources .      in this section",
    "we consider a matter source which provides an energy - momentum tensor of the form@xmath83\\]]in which @xmath84 @xmath85 and @xmath86 are arbitrary functions of @xmath87 the field equations , read now@xmath88the same method as we used in the previous section , i.e. , expansion of quantities about the throat , including @xmath84 @xmath85 and @xmath86@xmath89would lead to the following results in the zeroth order:@xmath90@xmath91and @xmath92next , we try to apply wec which implies @xmath93 and @xmath94 one finds the following conditions which should be satisfied simultaneously:@xmath95@xmath96and @xmath97 \\geq 0\\]]in which we used the choice that @xmath98 .",
    "next , one may add to the foregoing conditions @xmath99 which implies the strong energy conditions ( sec ) and gives@xmath100 in the case of @xmath101 @xcite one obtains @xmath102and @xmath103we note that although these conditions are very complicated in principle one can choose the proper parameters to satisfy them . in the next section we give an exact solution to the problem and with a particular example",
    "we shall justify our prediction .",
    "in this section we study the field equations not at the throat but at any @xmath104 this is also a generalization of ref .",
    "@xcite in which @xmath105constant .",
    "the field equations are given in eq.s ( 4)-(7 ) and the line element is considered as ( 2 ) while the energy momentum is given by ( 28 ) .",
    "a detailed calculation would imply the following relations for the components of energy momentum:@xmath106",
    "\\phi ^{\\prime } } { 2r^{2}}f+\\frac{\\left ( b^{\\prime } -4\\right ) r+3b}{2r^{2}}% f^{\\prime } -\\left ( 1-\\frac{b}{r}\\right ) f^{\\prime \\prime } , \\]]@xmath107@xmath108 } { 2r^{2}}f^{\\prime } + \\left ( 1-\\frac{b}{r}\\right ) f^{\\prime \\prime } .\\]]the case of ref .",
    "@xcite is easily observed if one sets @xmath109constant and therefore@xmath110@xmath111@xmath112the other limit can be checked for @xmath2 ( @xmath113 ) and the results found in ( 33)-(35 ) are recovered .",
    "next , let s consider an isotropic velocity distribution which implies @xmath114 together with the ansaetze @xmath115 and @xmath116 these in turn lead to@xmath117this equation admits two independent solutions and to keep our calculation analytic , we choose the simpler one given by@xmath118 in which @xmath119 is an integration constant .",
    "same ansatz in the ricci scalar gives @xmath120which implies ( through @xmath121)@xmath122for the integration constant @xmath123 that is related with the cosmological constant .",
    "finally one obtains @xmath124we note that the ricci scalar @xmath125 satisfies @xmath126 .",
    "this causes no restriction on the above expression and is well defined everywhere for @xmath127 our next step is to find the stress - energy components which are as follow:@xmath128furthermore the wec implies that @xmath129 and @xmath130 which in closed form read@xmath131and @xmath132one can see that both conditions are satisfied if both @xmath119 and @xmath123 remain positive .",
    "in addition to wec it is remarkable that the strong energy condition ( sec ) i.e. @xmath133 and @xmath134 is also satisfied under the following condition:@xmath135here @xmath119 and @xmath123 both are positive as chosen above for wec and @xmath136 is a positive parameter such that @xmath137 .",
    "it should be added that even for the case of @xmath138 , the sec holds true in the particular range of @xmath139 let us add that an expansion of @xmath0 in powers of @xmath125 yields@xmath140which gives the exact combination of integration constants ( @xmath141 ) that can be identified as the cosmological constant . the weak - curvature expansion ( 58 )",
    "suggests that @xmath142 is the crucial constant in order to attain einstein - hilbert term , but @xmath123 can be disposed .",
    "finally we look at the wormhole s line element @xmath143and check the conditions which @xmath144 and @xmath145 must satisfy . the first condition which states that @xmath146 is satisfied since@xmath147the second condition implies that @xmath148 this in turn reads @xmath149 and is obvious . finally @xmath150 means @xmath151 and is also satisfied for @xmath152 the condition on @xmath12 implies that it must be finite everywhere without root for @xmath34 which is trivially satisfied ( except for @xmath153 ) . to complete our example",
    "we give the embedded surface as @xmath154 this is shown in fig . 1 for @xmath17",
    "one of the most challenging problems in wormhole physics is to find an acceptable energy - momentum that will provide the outward push against gravitational collapse . in einstein s general relativity , i.e. @xmath155 , this has not been possible .",
    "now , with the advent of modified theories , namely the @xmath0 gravity , this may turn into reality .",
    "our approach to the problem of wormholes is to employ necessary existence conditions analogous to black holes .",
    "the existence problem of horizon in a black hole plays the similar role for throat radius in a wormhole .",
    "expansion of metric functions around the throat and substitutions into einstein s equations derive the necessary conditions . from these conditions , at the lowest order , we determine the metric functions that yield a traversable wormhole . in this process",
    "we have assumed that @xmath20 admits non - zero derivatives at least to third order , i.e. @xmath1 . with the introduction of external matter sources into @xmath0",
    "we show that the weak energy condition ( wec ) ( at least ) is satisfied in the construction of a wormhole in @xmath0 gravity .",
    "the @xmath0 function is explicitly determined ( eq .",
    "( 52 ) ) in which the ricci scalar satisfies @xmath126 .",
    "our results apply also to the case with / without a cosmological constant since the latter arises automatically as a combination of integration constants . in conclusion , in a generic class of @xmath0 theories satisfying the necessary conditions for existence of traversable wormhole , solutions can be supported by physical stress - energy tensor . the embedding diagram for the obtained wormhole",
