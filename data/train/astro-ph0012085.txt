    "a fundamental characteristic of the galaxy population , which has been the subject of study at least since @xcite , is the distribution of their luminosities .",
    "given the broad spectral energy distributions of galaxies ( especially in the presence of dust ) , the bolometric luminosity of galaxies is currently too difficult to measure to meaningfully study , so we must be satisfied with observing the luminosity function in some wavelength bandpass . in this paper",
    "we measure the luminosity function of local ( @xmath20 ) galaxies in five optical bandpasses , between about 3000   and 10000  .",
    "we also investigate the correlation of luminosity with other galaxy properties , such as surface brightness , intrinsic color , and morphology .",
    "this quantitative characterization of the local galaxy population provides the basic data that a theory of galaxy formation must account for and an essential baseline for studies of galaxy evolution at higher redshifts .",
    "the most recent determinations of the optical luminosity function of `` field '' galaxies ( those selected without regard to local density ) have come from large flux - limited redshift surveys .",
    "they include the luminosity function measurements of @xcite , using the las campanas redshift survey ( lcrs ; @xcite ) in the lcrs @xmath18-band ( around 6500  ) , and of @xcite using the two - degree field galaxy redshift survey ( 2dfgrs ; @xcite ) in the @xmath19-band ( around 4500  ) .",
    "other recent determinations of the local optical luminosity function have been mostly in the @xmath21- or @xmath19-bands , for example the nearby optical galaxy sample ( @xcite ) , the optical redshift survey ( @xcite ) , the stromlo - apm redshift survey ( @xcite ) , the durham / ukst galaxy redshift survey ( @xcite ) , and the eso slice project galaxy redshift survey ( @xcite ) .",
    "of particular interest here is the ability to use the multi - band photometry of the sdss to _ meaningfully _ compare our results to those of these other surveys .    in this paper",
    ", we use imaging and spectroscopy of 11,275 galaxies over about 140 square degrees complete to @xmath0 from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; @xcite ) commissioning data to calculate the luminosity function of galaxies . in section [ data ] we describe the source catalog and the redshift sample , with particular attention to our definition of galaxy magnitudes , which is based on a modified form of the @xcite system . in section [ method ] , we describe the maximum - likelihood method used to calculate the luminosity function . in section [ results ] , we present the results for the luminosity function in each band , for the luminosity density of the universe , and for the dependence of galaxy luminosity on surface brightness , color and morphology . in section [ isopetro ] , we examine the effects of using petrosian magnitudes rather than isophotal magnitudes for the luminosity function . in section",
    "[ others ] , we compare our results to those of lin _ et al . _",
    "( 1996 ; lcrs ) and folkes _ et al . _",
    "( 1999 ; 2dfgrs ) .",
    "we show that the sdss luminosity function implies a substantially higher mean luminosity density than either of these previous measurements , but that we can reproduce the results of both surveys if we mimic their isophotal definitions of galaxy magnitudes .",
    "we conclude in section [ conclusions ] .",
    "the sdss ( @xcite ) will produce imaging and spectroscopic surveys over @xmath22 steradians in the northern galactic cap . a dedicated 2.5 m telescope ( siegmund _ et al .",
    "_ , in preparation ) at apache point observatory , sunspot , new mexico , will image the sky in five bands ( @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 ; centered at 3540  , 4770  , 6230  , 7630  , and 9130   respectively ; @xcite ) using a drift - scanning , mosaic ccd camera ( @xcite ) , detecting objects to a flux limit of @xmath28 .",
    "approximately 900,000 galaxies , ( down to @xmath29 ) , 100,000 bright red galaxies ( brgs ; eisenstein _ et al .",
    "_ , in preparation ) , and 100,000 qsos ( @xcite ; newberg _ et al .",
    "_ , in preparation ) will be targeted for spectroscopic follow up using two digital spectrographs on the same telescope .",
    "the survey has completed its commissioning phase , during which the data analyzed here were obtained .    as of january 2001 ,",
    "the sdss has imaged around 2,000 square degrees of sky and taken spectra of approximately 100,000 objects . in this paper",
    ", we concentrate only on @xmath30 230 square degrees along the celestial equator in the region bounded by @xmath31 and @xmath32 ( j2000 ) .",
    "this region was imaged during two runs , known as sdss runs 752 and 756 , over two nights in march 1999 .",
    "each run consists of six columns of data , each slightly wider than 0.2 degrees and separated by about the same amount ; the runs are interleaved to form a complete , 2.5 degree wide , stripe .",
    "the seeing varied over the course of the runs from about @xmath33 to @xmath34 , with a median of approximately @xmath35 . in this area ,",
    "the spectroscopic survey has so far obtained more than 11,275 redshifts of galaxies selected from these runs , over about 140 square degrees of sky , from which we here calculate the luminosity function .",
    "the images produced by the camera are analyzed by a photometric pipeline specifically written for reducing sdss data ( photo ; lupton _ et al .",
    "_ , in preparation ) .",
    "photo subtracts the ccd bias , divides by the flat field , interpolates over data defects ( cosmic rays , bad columns , bleed trails ) , finds objects , deblends overlapping objects , and performs photometry .",
    "it estimates the local point - spread function ( psf ) as a function of position based on bright stars . among many other tasks , for each photometric band",
    "the pipeline calculates the @xmath36 diameter aperture magnitude @xmath37 , the psf magnitude @xmath38 ( that is , the magnitude using the local psf as a weighted aperture ) , and the petrosian magnitude @xmath39 ( described more fully below ) .",
    "it fits for the parameters of ( possibly elliptical ) de vaucouleurs and exponential profiles for each object .",
    "it picks the better model of the two in @xmath1 , and uses this model as a weighted aperture to calculate the `` model magnitude '' @xmath40 in all bands ; as described in the section [ target ] , while the flux limit is defined with repect to petrosian magnitudes , the model magnitudes are used to distinguish between stars and galaxies .",
    "more sophicated models will be fit to a bright subsample of the galaxies in a later paper , but the survey pipelines measure model magnitudes for every detected object in the survey , and to fit more complicated models to all objects would be prohibitively expensive . for each object , photo also measures an azimuthally averaged radial profile out to the maximum detectable distance .",
    "the measured magnitudes are calibrated in the @xmath41 system ( @xcite ) .",
    "the system is based on three `` fundamental standards '' ( bd @xmath42 , bd @xmath43 , and bd @xmath44 ) .",
    "the united states naval observatory 1 m telescope has calibrated about 150 `` primary standards '' with respect to the fundamental standards . meanwhile , a 0.5 m photometric telescope ( pt ; uomoto _ et al .",
    "_ , in preparation ) is used to relate the primary standards to a set of secondary standards , all fainter than @xmath45 and lying in patches referred to as `` secondary calibration patches . ''",
    "these patches lie along the survey stripes .",
    "thus , during the course of its imaging on any given night , the camera passes over these secondary calibration patches ; because the secondary standards are faint enough that they do not saturate the camera on the 2.5 m , they can be used to calibrate yet fainter objects detected by the imaging .",
    "then , all of the detected objects can be related to the primary standards , and thus to the fundamental standards .",
    "the pt serves yet another function , which is to monitor the primary standards during nights that the 2.5 m telescope is imaging , in order to determine extinction coefficients and their variation over the course of the night .",
    "while this procedure was used to calibrate the commissioning data , the resulting calibration has not yet been fully verified . here",
    ", we represent magnitudes with the notation @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath1 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 , rather than the standard notation @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 , to indicate the preliminary nature of the calibrations used here .",
    "we expect the final system to differ from the current system by 0.05 magnitudes or less .",
    "in particular , we have found consistent results from calculating the luminosity function in regions other than the equatorial stripe presented here , which were calibrated based on different secondary patches .      because galaxies are resolved objects with poorly defined edges , and do not all have the same radial surface brightness profile , some care is required to define the `` flux '' associated with each object .",
    "an ideal method would measure the `` total '' light associated with each galaxy , but in practice any such method requires a model - dependent extrapolation of the measured light profile , and an accurate extrapolation itself requires high signal - to - noise ratio data in the outer regions of the galaxy .",
    "a conventional alternative is to measure flux within a specified isophote , but with such isophotal magnitudes the _ fraction _ of a galaxy s light that is measured depends on the _ amplitude _ of its surface brightness profile , and the fraction decreases if the surface brightness is diminished by cosmological redshift dimming or by galactic extinction . to avoid these problems ,",
    "the sdss has adopted a modified form of the @xcite system , measuring galaxy fluxes with a circular aperture whose radius is defined by the _ shape _ of the galaxy light profile .",
    "more specifically , we define the `` petrosian ratio '' @xmath46 at a radius @xmath47 from the center of an object to be the ratio of the local surface brightness averaged over an annulus at @xmath47 to the mean surface brightness within @xmath47 : @xmath48}{\\left .",
    "\\int_0^r dr ' 2\\pi r ' i(r ' ) \\right/ [ \\pi r^2]},\\ ] ] where @xmath49 is the azimuthally averaged surface brightness profile and @xmath50 , @xmath51 define the annulus .",
    "the sdss has adopted @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "the petrosian radius @xmath54 is defined as the radius at which @xmath55 equals some specified value @xmath56 . the petrosian flux in any band is then defined as the flux within a certain number @xmath57 of @xmath1 petrosian radii : @xmath58 thus , the aperture in all bands is set by the profile of the galaxy in @xmath1 alone .",
    "the sdss has selected @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "the aperture @xmath61 is large enough to contain nearly all of the light for a typical galaxy profile ( see below ) , so even substantial errors in @xmath62 cause only small errors in the petrosian flux , but small enough that sky noise in @xmath63 is small ( typical statistical errors near the flux limit of @xmath64 are @xmath65 ) . in practice , there are a number of complications associated with this definition : the galaxy images are pixelized , some galaxies have undefined petrosian radii because sky noise begins to dominate before the petrosian ratio drops to @xmath66 , some galaxies have multiply - defined petrosian radii because of galaxy substructure , and so forth .",
    "we defer detailed discussion of these issues to lupton _",
    "( in preparation ) , since for nearly all galaxies in the spectroscopic sample the idealized account above is accurate .    given the petrosian flux , one can find the radius @xmath67 contained 50% of the petrosian flux and the radius @xmath68 containing 90% of the petrosian flux .",
    "as shown below , the petrosian flux measures virtually all of the flux in pure exponential profiles but only 80% of the flux in pure de vaucouleurs profiles .",
    "thus , for exponential profiles , @xmath67 and @xmath68 correspond to the true 50% and 90% light radii , but for de vaucouleurs profiles @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "we define the half - light surface brightness to be the average surface brightness within the half - light radius , in magnitudes per square arcsecond : @xmath71 .",
    "the `` concentration index '' of galaxies is defined as @xmath72 .",
    "high concentration index objects , such as de vaucouleurs profile galaxies , have a strong central concentration of light and large , faint wings .",
    "low concentration index objects , such as exponential profile galaxies , have a light distribution which is closer to uniform .",
    "we will generally express our results as a function of @xmath73 , the inverse concentration index .",
    "the petrosian ratio @xmath46 is manifestly indifferent to multiplicative changes in the surface brightness of the galaxy and depends only on the physical radius in the galaxy , not on its redshift or galactic extinction .",
    "thus , the ratio of the petrosian flux to total flux for any given galaxy depends on redshift only to the extent that the effects of seeing and @xmath74-corrections change the measured shape of the galaxy profile .",
    "petrosian magnitudes only become practical for relatively deep imaging ; otherwise the petrosian ratio ( equation [ petroratio ] ) is noisy and the aperture can not be made large enough to capture most of a typical galaxy s light .    using simulated galaxy observations , we can determine what fraction of the light the petrosian flux contains for typical galaxy profiles .",
    "this fraction is independent of redshift except when the size of the galaxy is comparable to the seeing .",
    "figure [ pvr.lf ] shows the ratio @xmath75 of the petrosian flux to the total flux , as a function of the ( true ) angular half - light radius of a galaxy .",
    "the top panel shows @xmath75 for a face - on exponential disk ; the bottom panel shows the same quantity for a circularly symmetric de vaucouleurs profile .",
    "the dotted line is the result in the limit of no seeing , for an axisymmetric galaxy .",
    "the solid line is the result assuming the median seeing of @xmath35 for the runs analyzed here , again for an axisymmetric galaxy . to calculate these quantities ,",
    "we convolve each model galaxy with a realistic point - spread function ( including the power - law wings ) measured from bright stars in the survey .",
    "as the size of the galaxy becomes comparable to the seeing , the fraction of light enclosed within a radius of @xmath76 becomes closer and closer to the corresponding fraction for a star , which is about 95% .",
    "in the case of exponential profiles , @xmath77 in the absence of seeing .",
    "seeing therefore reduces the fraction of light measured by the petrosian flux , though only by about 3% even for small galaxies . in the case of de  vaucouleurs profiles , about 82% of the light",
    "is measured by the petrosian flux in the absence of seeing .",
    "seeing therefore increases the fraction of light measured for a small de  vaucouleurs galaxy by about 10% .",
    "these results depend very little on the inclination of the disk or the axis ratio of the de vaucouleurs profile .",
    "for example , in figure [ pvr.lf ] , the dashed line in each panel shows the result for a galaxy with an axis ratio of 0.5 , convolved with seeing .    for comparison ,",
    "we show in figure [ r50hist ] the distribution of observed half - light radii .",
    "this figure shows the distribution of @xmath67 for galaxies with @xmath78 in the top panel , and the fractional cumulative distribution @xmath79 in the bottom panel .",
    "roughly half of the galaxies have @xmath80 , and thus probably have their petrosian fluxes under- or overestimated by a few percent .",
    "we emphasize that a comparably deep isophotal magnitude would have a similar dependence on angular size to that found here , without the benefits of being independent of galaxy redshift for galaxies with half - light radii larger than the seeing .      once objects have been identified and photometry has been performed , which can be done reliably to @xmath81 , a sample of targets is selected for spectroscopic observation .",
    "the details of this selection and the software pipeline used to implement it will be described in separate papers ( strauss _ et al .",
    "_ , in preparation ; vanden berk _",
    "et al . _ , in preparation ) .",
    "for the purposes of the main galaxy sample , extended objects ( galaxies ) are separated from stars based on the quantity @xmath82 in @xmath1 , where ( as described in section [ photo ] ) @xmath38 is the magnitude using a psf - weighted aperture and @xmath40 is the magnitude associated with the best - fit model to the galaxy profile .",
    "that is , if most of the object s light is contained within an aperture weighted by the psf , it is considered to be stellar .",
    "figure [ psfmodel ] shows the distribution of our spectroscopic galaxy targets versus @xmath82 .",
    "the objects which are galaxies ( based on the spectroscopic data ) are shown in the solid histogram , and those which are stars are shown in the dotted histogram . for the commissioning data ,",
    "the division was set at @xmath83 ; roughly 1% of objects brighter than the spectroscopic limit and identified as galaxies in this way are stars . indeed , most of the stellar spectra recovered from the galaxy sample are actually double stars , which shows that this method of separating the populations is fairly clean .",
    "it is clear from the drop - off in the distribution of galaxies as @xmath82 decreases that galaxies in this magnitude range with @xmath84 are extremely rare .",
    "we use the model magnitude here for star / galaxy separation rather than the petrosian magnitude because the model magnitude is more robust at faint magnitudes ( @xmath85 ) and to the effects of seeing ; we emphasize that for the spectroscopic sample such considerations are irrelevant , because the star / galaxy separation is so clean .",
    "given the set of extended objects in the commissioning data , we chose as spectroscopic targets all objects with a petrosian magnitude ( after an extinction correction using the dust maps of @xcite ) of @xmath86 and a fraction of those between 17.65 and 17.75 , with a probability declining linearly from unity to zero in this range .",
    "this flux limit was applied using the calibration available in the march 2000 , in a version of the processing known as `` rerun 1 . ''",
    "the magnitudes quoted here were calibrated in a later version known as `` rerun 4 . '' because of the differences in calibration , to define a complete sample we have restricted ourselves here to a flux limit of @xmath87 .",
    "in addition , a surface brightness cut of @xmath88 was used for the commissioning observations ; this cut eliminates less than 1% of all extended objects brighter than the flux limit , about half of which are real galaxies and half of which are ghosts or consequences of improper deblending . we have checked the effects of improper deblending by examining by eye all of the targets in the range @xmath89 .",
    "fifteen ( about 3% ) of the targets in this range are products of deblending failures which nevertheless have galactic redshifts successfully determined and thus contaminate our sample ; we have checked that the effect of this contamination is small compared to our estimated errors .",
    "the main survey uses improved methods for eliminating contamination by such defects and will accordingly have a somewhat more relaxed surface brightness limit .",
    "we will explore below ( section [ sbdep ] ) some of the consequences of the surface brightness limit in the commissioning data .",
    "a number of other requirements were used in selecting spectroscopic targets .",
    "the `` fiber magnitude '' ( defined in section [ photo ] as the magnitude within an @xmath36 diameter aperture ) was restricted to be fainter than @xmath90 in @xmath12 , @xmath1 , or @xmath13 to avoid cross - talk between fibers on the spectrograph ccds .",
    "objects brighter than @xmath91 and with half - light radii @xmath92 almost invariably turn out to be misclassified stars and therefore we reject them ; this cut always affects @xmath93 of objects , and only approaches this percentage in poor seeing conditions .",
    "we note that the brg sample targets galaxies fainter than @xmath94 that satisfy specified color and magnitude selection criteria ; we have _ not _ made use of the brg sample in the luminosity function measurements presented here .",
    "the spectra of the chosen galaxies are obtained using a multi - object fiber spectrograph that can take 640 spectra at once in a circular plate ( or `` tile '' ) 1.49 degrees in radius ( uomoto _ et al .",
    "_ , in preparation ) .",
    "each exposure is about 4560 minutes , depending on observing conditions .",
    "each fiber has a diameter of @xmath36 , and is led into a dichroic beam - splitter centered at @xmath95   which separates the light onto red and blue cameras .",
    "the resulting spectrum covers the range from 3800   to 9200  , with a resolution @xmath96 .    in practice ,",
    "48 of the fibers are used as sky fibers and spectrophotometric standards , leaving 592 for quasars , galaxies , and stars .",
    "typically , about 500 fibers per plate are used for galaxies .",
    "although this number provides enough fibers for all our desired targets , the galaxies are distributed non - uniformly on the sky .",
    "furthermore , no two fibers on the same plate can be placed closer than @xmath97 , a limit imposed by the physical size of the fiber plugs .",
    "for these two reasons , we must position the centers of the spectroscopic plates and allocate the targets to the plates carefully , in order to maximize the number of targeted galaxies ( blanton _ et al .",
    "_ , in preparation ) . in the commissioning data we assigned fibers to about @xmath98 of the targeted objects ( lumping main sample galaxies , qsos , and",
    "brgs together ) , although for the survey proper , for which the geometry will be considerably more favorable , our sampling will be above @xmath99 .",
    "most of the missing targets are due to the @xmath97 collision constraints .    after observation ,",
    "the spectra are analyzed using a specially written spectroscopic pipeline ( frieman _ et al .",
    "_ , in preparation ) which extracts the 640 spectra from each two - dimensional spectrogram , carries out wavelength and flux calibration , subtracts the sky , classifies the objects as stars , qsos , or galaxies , and determines the redshift . for galaxies ,",
    "redshifts are determined independently from emission lines and from a cross - correlation with absorption spectra ; using both methods provides a useful check on the software . in the data analyzed here ( not all of which is considered `` survey quality '' ) , and with a commissioning version of the pipeline ,",
    "the redshift success rate for objects targeted as galaxies is about 98% , as determined by eyeball examination of the spectra , independent of apparent magnitude and surface brightness .",
    "the remaining 2% fail to give redshifts , due for the most part to broken fibers and the accidental targetting of ghost images .",
    "the redshift errors are around @xmath100 km s@xmath101 , as determined by repeat observations of the same objects ; this error is completely negligible for the purposes of measuring the luminosity function .      to calculate the luminosity function ,",
    "we must map the selection function of the survey . aside from the flux limit",
    ", there are three main effects : missing galaxies due to lack of fibers in dense regions , missing galaxies due to spectroscopic failures , and missing galaxies due to fiber collisions . to account for these effects",
    ", we calculate the local sampling rate of galaxies separately for each region covered by a unique set of plates .",
    "that is , in the case of two overlapping plates , the sampling is calculated separately in three regions : the region covered only by the first plate , the region covered only by the second plate , and the region covered by both .",
    "we refer to each of these three regions as an `` overlap region . ''",
    "thus , depending on what overlap region it was in , each galaxy can be assigned a sampling rate @xmath102 , equal to the number of redshifts of galaxy targets obtained in the region divided by the number of galaxy targets in the region . in regions covered by a single plate , @xmath103@xmath104 ; in multiple plate regions , @xmath105@xmath106 .",
    "these completenesses average to the 92% quoted above .",
    "it is possible to simply weight each galaxy by @xmath107 when calculating the luminosity function .",
    "however , the majority of the missing galaxies are missing because of the fiber collision constraints .",
    "it is more appropriate to account for the collisions as follows .",
    "first , we group the galaxies using a friends - of - friends algorithm with a @xmath97 linking length . for each galaxy for which we obtained a redshift ,",
    "we assign a `` collision weight '' @xmath108 equal to the multiplicity of the group divided by the number of redshifts obtained in the group .",
    "that is , in a colliding pair for which we have one redshift , we weight that redshift by a factor @xmath109 .",
    "this procedure is essentially the same as assuming the two galaxies have the same absolute magnitude .",
    "the sampling rate using these collision weights , which we denote @xmath110 , turns out to be @xmath111@xmath106 for most overlap regions .",
    "when we calculate the normalization of the luminosity function below , we weight each galaxy by the factor @xmath112 .",
    "we should note that the difference between weighting by @xmath112 and by @xmath107 is negligible in the calculation of the luminosity function ( although this is certainly not the case for clustering statistics ) .      to convert the apparent magnitude @xmath113 to an absolute magnitude @xmath114",
    ", we must assume a particular cosmology and correct for the fact that the observed bandpass differs from the restframe bandpass .",
    "the relation between @xmath113 and @xmath114 can be written @xmath115 where @xmath116 is the bolometric distance modulus and @xmath117 is the @xmath74-correction .",
    "here we use distance moduli based on three different friedman - robertson - walker models : ( @xmath118 , @xmath119 ) ; ( @xmath120 , @xmath121 ) ; and ( @xmath120 , @xmath122 ) . see @xcite and references therein for distance measure formulae for these cosmologies . at @xmath123 , the highest redshift considered here , the difference in the distance modulus for these three cases is about 0.2 magnitudes at most .",
    "meanwhile , the comoving volume associated with a coordinate volume element @xmath124 differs among these models by as much as 40% .",
    "we use all three models for the calculation of our main results for the luminosity in each band , but for the investigation of the dependence of luminosity on other parameters , we consider only the @xmath120 , @xmath121 model for the sake of simplicity .",
    "we use @xmath125 km s@xmath101 mpc@xmath101 , with @xmath3 when we have not specified @xmath126 explicitly ; choosing alternative values for @xmath126 shifts all absolute magnitudes by @xmath127 and changes number densities by the factor @xmath5 .",
    "because we observe the galaxies in a fixed observed wavelength band , a @xmath74-correction is necessary to account for the fact that the observed band corresponds to different rest - frame bands at different redshifts .",
    "naturally , this @xmath74-correction is dependent on the galaxy spectral energy distribution ( sed ) .",
    "given the five - band sdss photometry and the high quality spectra over a large range in wavelength , the best approach in the long run will be to determine the @xmath74-corrections of the galaxies from the survey itself . for the present , however , we will simply use @xmath74-corrections supplied by @xcite for a range of galaxy types . using the observed galaxy redshift and the @xmath17 color , we interpolate between the galaxy types in @xcite to determine the intrinsic @xmath17 color and the appropriate @xmath74-correction . figure [ kcorrect ]",
    "shows the @xmath74-correction in @xmath1 as a function of redshift for several different galaxy colors over the range of redshifts of interest here .",
    "while the true survey bandpasses are not exactly those assumed by @xcite , we have tested the effect of using @xmath74-corrections based on recent estimates of the filter curves ( @xcite ) , and the differences in the resulting measured luminosity density are less than 5% in all bands .",
    "we define the unit - normalized luminosity function @xmath128 to be the distribution function of galaxies in luminosity , normalized to unit integral over the range from @xmath129 to @xmath130 .",
    "we denote the number density of galaxies in the range of luminosity considered as @xmath131 , in units of @xmath5 mpc@xmath6 .",
    "thus , the number density of galaxies per unit luminosity is @xmath132 . for plotting purposes",
    ", we use the luminosity function per unit magnitude , normalized to the mean density of galaxies : @xmath133 with @xmath134 , where @xmath135 is the luminosity of an object with absolute magnitude zero .",
    "we use the maximum likelihood approach outlined by @xcite and @xcite to calculate @xmath128 .",
    "this method is based on the conditional probability of observing a galaxy with a luminosity between @xmath136 and @xmath137 given its redshift @xmath138 : @xmath139 here , @xmath140 and @xmath141 are the minimum and maximum luminosities observable at redshift @xmath138 , given the faint and bright flux limits of the survey . as described below , we evaluate equation ( [ likefunc ] ) using two models for @xmath128 : a schechter function and a non - parametric model . note",
    "that the probability in equation ( [ likefunc ] ) is completely independent of the density field of galaxies ; this fact makes the method insensitive to the effects of large - scale structure , at least to the extent that the luminosity function is universal .",
    "in addition , this insensitivity makes it necessary to calculate the normalization in a separate step , described below .",
    "the procedure is to minimize the quantity @xmath142,\\ ] ] where the weight @xmath108 is applied to properly account for galaxies which are eliminated due to fiber collisions .",
    "that is , we assign double weight to a galaxy if it has eliminated a neighbor from the redshift sample due to a collision . in principle",
    ", we should use the weight @xmath112 , to also weight those galaxies that do not have fibers due to being in dense regions , but the changes in our results would be extremely small .",
    "note that the weights we assign only affect the mean of the maximum likelihood estimator if they correlate with the luminosity ; that is , the weights @xmath108 only make a difference to the extent that the typical luminosities of galaxies involved in fiber collisions are different from those of other galaxies .    to perform the minimization , we need to choose a model for @xmath128 . here",
    "we use both a @xcite function and a non - parametric model .",

    "the number of high surface brightness galaxies missed is therefore a tiny fraction of the full sample ; if we choose a higher cut - off for @xmath82 which excludes 1% of the canonical galaxy sample , the effect on the luminosity and surface - brightness distributions is negligible .",

    "however , the well - known relationship between surface brightness and luminosity ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , confirmed below , suggests that the excluded galaxies will preferentially be of low luminosity .",
    "since these underluminous galaxies are observable only within a rather small , nearby volume , they are given disproportionate statistical weight when the luminosity function is calculated , and thus even a small number of missing objects may significantly bias our estimate of the luminosity function at low luminosities .",
    "this effect is one reason why the full sdss sample will have a fainter surface brightness limit than 23.5 , as mentioned in section [ target ] above .",
    "a simple way to investigate this effect is to raise the surface brightness threshold to @xmath192 .",
    "this restriction excludes an additional 1.5% of the galaxies within our flux limits .",

    "if one extrapolates the fitted schechter functions to all luminosities , the difference is still only 5% .",
    "however , if the low - luminosity slope @xmath146 steepens considerably below @xmath195 , then the contribution of low surface brightness galaxies to the luminosity could be larger . because the objects with @xmath196 have a surface number density that is about 0.5% of that of galaxies in our sample , these effects represent a firm upper limit on the influence of our surface brightness threshold on the luminosity function in the range of absolute magnitudes considered here",
    "the joint distribution of surface brightness and luminosity is a valuable diagnostic for understanding surface brightness selection effects and an important quantitative characterization of the galaxy population in its own right ( see , _",

    "figures [ lsbf_m ] and [ lsbf_sb ] show slices parallel to the axes of this two - dimensional plane : the luminosity function for several ranges of intrinsic surface brightness ( figure [ lsbf_m ] ) and the surface brightness distribution for several ranges of absolute magnitude ( figure [ lsbf_sb ] ) .",

    "the intrinsic surface brightness distribution of galaxies with @xmath201 drops off well before our threshold of @xmath202 , providing further evidence that our luminosity function is unaffected by surface brightness selection in this magnitude range .",
    "for galaxies less luminous than @xmath203 , the surface brightness distribution does decline before hitting our threshold , but not in as definitive a manner as it does for more luminous galaxies ; thus , our galaxy density in this regime might be underestimated , and we can not rule out an upturn in the luminosity function at these magnitudes . however , the luminosity density for a schechter luminosity function with @xmath204 is dominated by galaxies with @xmath205 . unless there is a radical change in the shape of the luminosity function at @xmath206 , we can safely say that low surface brightness galaxies make a relatively small contribution to the luminosity density of the universe .",
    "all of these conclusions are in broad agreement with most recent studies ( @xcite ) .",
    "there is great potential for further studies of galaxy surface brightness and its correlation with other properties using the sdss . as a result of improvements in the photometric data reduction software , the main survey ( now underway ) will adopt a fainter surface brightness threshold , @xmath207 .",

    "follow - up efforts in optical and 21 cm and correlation with hi radio surveys such as hipass ( _ e.g. _ , @xcite ) will greatly improve the characterization of the low surface brightness galaxy population .",
    "it is well - known that galaxies of different intrinsic colors have quite different luminosity functions .",
    "we explore this issue here in a simple way , by calculating the joint distribution of luminosity and the intrinsic @xmath17 color .",
    "we determine the intrinsic @xmath17 color for a galaxy at a particular redshift by using the observed @xmath17 color to interpolate between the predicted colors at that redshift for various galaxy types in the results of @xcite .",
    "there are only five templates between which we are interpolating , which may affect the accuracy of our color estimates ( typical color corrections to rest frame are about 0.25 magnitudes , so our accuracy is considerably better than that ) .    the resulting distribution , @xmath208 is shown in figure [ lgmrf ] .",
    "this figure shows the `` e / s0 '' ridge at @xmath209 , which is well - known in the context of galaxy clusters , as well as the dependence of color on luminosity . as in the case of surface brightness",

    "once the final calibration is available , another improvement will be to use the broad - band imaging ( and possibly the spectra ) to determine the @xmath74-corrections from the data itself .",
    "methods developed for photometric redshifts , which can use the broad - band colors to reconstruct the typical spectral energy distributions of galaxies ( _ e.g. _ , @xcite ) , can be brought to bear on this problem and will resolve the difficulties mentioned above associated with the small number of templates used for interpolation .",
    "finally , let us consider the dependence of luminosity on the morphology of galaxies .",
    "although there are numerous ways to quantify galaxy morphology , we choose here for simplicity to use the `` concentration index , '' defined to be @xmath210 , the ratio of the radii containing 90% and 50% of the petrosian flux .",
    "we will actually study the inverse concentration index @xmath73 here , because it has the property of being between zero and one .",

    "it has been shown to correlate well with visual morphological classification for bright galaxies ( shimasaku _ et al .",
    "_ , in preparation ; strateva _ et al .",
    "_ , in preparation ) .",
    "figure [ lcrf ] shows the joint distribution of luminosity and inverse concentration index .",
    "as one might expect , the high luminosity galaxies tend to have high concentration index , and thus to have profiles which are closer to de vaucouleurs profiles .",
    "as before , we slice this two - dimensional plane to get the luminosity function for several ranges of the inverse concentration index in figure [ lcrf_m ] , and the distribution of the inverse concentration index for several ranges of luminosity in figure [ lcrf_cr ] .",
    "bear in mind that the concentration index is not the only , and perhaps not the best , measure of morphology .",
    "for example , some of the inverse concentration indices measured may be artificially affected by the effects of seeing .",
    "the inverse concentration index for a realistic psf measured from the survey is around @xmath216 , so exponential disks and de vaucouleurs profiles that are marginally resolved will tend to have their inverse concentration indices increased towards this value . furthermore , this measure of morphology is based only on the radial profile in @xmath1 , and thus does not use the information on color gradients , shape , and galaxy substructure that is available in the imaging . developing measures of morphology that use the full information from the galaxy images and that are independent of the effects of seeing",
    "is one of the ongoing projects within the sdss collaboration .",
    "as discussed in section [ target ] , we have selected spectroscopic targets and calculated galaxy luminosities using petrosian magnitudes , so that the fraction of a galaxy s light that is measured is independent of the amplitude of its surface brightness profile and independent of cosmological redshift dimming or galactic extinction . in order to compare our luminosity function results to those of previous surveys , most of which selected galaxies according to some variant of an isophotal magnitude , we must understand how the difference between petrosian and isophotal magnitudes affects the determination of the luminosity function .",
    "we can calculate an isophotal magnitude for each galaxy in our sample , by integrating the azimuthally - averaged radial profile of each galaxy , which is available as a standard output of photo ( lupton _ et al .",
    "_ , in preparation ) , out to a chosen isophote .",
    "these magnitudes do not correspond exactly to the common definition of isophotal magnitudes , which typically are not azimuthally - averaged .",
    "however , as we show in the next section by comparing the sdss results to those of other surveys , the two definitions are probably nearly equivalent , at least for luminosity statistics . before selecting galaxies according to our newly defined isophotal magnitudes and calculating a luminosity function , let us first directly examine the relationship between the sdss petrosian magnitudes and isophotal magnitudes . if @xmath217 were the same for all galaxies , the luminosity scale would differ in the zero - point , but there would be no other change in the shape of the luminosity function .",
    "however , @xmath217 depends on both surface brightness ( because low surface brightness objects hide a higher fraction of their light below any given isophotal level ) and redshift ( because of cosmological surface brightness dimming ) ; thus the resulting luminosity function is strongly affected . to show the redshift dependence , figure [ isomag_z_vol ] shows @xmath217 for a volume - limited sample of galaxies to @xmath123 ( roughly @xmath218 ) , for several choices of the isophotal limit . in each panel",
    "we show a linear regression fit , showing clearly that the isophotal flux is not a constant fraction of the petrosian flux as a function of redshift .",
    "figure [ isomag_m ] shows @xmath217 as a function of absolute magnitude . for luminous galaxies ,",
    "@xmath217 is large because most such galaxies are near the edges of the survey ( because more volume is there ) and thus suffer considerable surface brightness dimming . for underluminous galaxies",
    ", @xmath217 is again large , now because ( as dictated by the correlation of luminosity and surface brightness found in section [ sbdep ] ) many of these objects are low surface brightness .",
    "the redshift and luminosity dependence persists even at isophotal limits so faint that the typical redshift zero isophotal magnitude is _",
    "brighter _ than the same galaxy s petrosian magnitude . for isophotal limits more typical of other surveys , such as @xmath219 , which is comparable to that of the lcrs , or at @xmath220 , which under the assumption that @xmath221 is comparable to the 2dfgrs , the trend with redshift is quite strong . in section",
    "[ others ] , we will perform a much more careful comparison of our results to those of the lcrs and the 2dfgrs .",
    "figure [ phi.iso ] compares the luminosity functions derived using the isophotal and the petrosian samples in the @xmath1 band .",
    "clearly there is a considerable difference between the estimates , which is not attributable to a simple constant offset between isophotal and petrosian magnitudes .",
    "instead , the isophotal magnitude estimate differs from the petrosian magnitude estimate at the low and high luminosity ends .",
    "figure [ phi.iso ] also lists @xmath222 , the fraction of the integrated luminosity density in the petrosian sample that is recovered in each isophotal sample . from these results",
    ", we infer that surveys with shallower isophotal limits could be missing considerable amounts of luminosity density",
    ". we will compare our results more directly to other surveys ( and in the appropriate bands ) in section [ others ] below .",
    "there are two reasons that isophotal samples can underestimate the luminosity density when the isophotal limits are too bright .",
    "first , isophotal magnitudes with bright limits measure less flux for each galaxy , as revealed by figure [ isomag_m ] .",
    "second , because the fraction of the total flux measured by an isophotal magnitude decreases with redshift from cosmological surface brightness dimming , using the standard formula for the distance modulus overestimates the effective volume of each galaxy ( @xcite ) .",
    "the dominant effect in figure [ phi.iso ] is the first , that less light is measured .",
    "to show this , we recalculate luminosity functions using a simple @xmath223 estimator ( _ e.g. _ , @xcite ) .",
    "we first use the petrosian magnitudes both to determine the absolute magnitude of the galaxy and to apply the flux limits ( and thus also to determine @xmath224 )",
    ". then we use the isophotal magnitudes to do both , finding the expected reduction in luminosity density ( about 40% in the case of @xmath225 ) .",
    "we then calculate the luminosity function again , determining @xmath198 from the isophotal magnitude but applying the flux limits to the petrosian magnitude . in this case , the reduction of the luminosity density is nearly as great , around 35% . finally , we determine @xmath198 from the petrosian magnitude , but apply the flux limits to the isophotal magnitude , thus isolating the effect of an incorrect @xmath224 determination . in the case",
    "that @xmath225 , this procedure reduced the luminosity density only by 10% .",
    "these results show that it is the missing light beyond the isophotes that dominates the reduction in the luminosity density , rather than an overestimate of the maximum volume . presumably , this result is related to that of @xcite , that the systematic effects associated with isophotal magnitudes have only a moderate effect on the estimated @xmath226 distribution .",
    "the error in @xmath224 estimated with the standard distance modulus may be large in some individual cases , but most galaxies enter the sample at a redshift close to the largest one at which it is possible for them to , because that is where most of the volume is .",
    "the additional dimming out to the galaxy s limiting redshift is therefore small in most cases .",
    "as we have seen above , the choice of isophotal magnitudes can greatly affect the results for the galaxy luminosity function , confirming the results of @xcite .",
    "thus , in order to show that the results of the sdss are consistent with those of other surveys , we must reanalyze the sdss data in the same ways that previous surveys analyzed their data .",
    "the sdss provides the ability to do so ( for surveys of comparable depth ) in a way that no other large - scale survey has before . using the five - band color information and the color conversions for galaxies provided by @xcite",
    ", one can convert the sdss magnitudes into the appropriate band for almost any desired optical survey .",
    "we convert to the lcrs @xmath227 band and to @xmath19 , and compare to the lcrs and 2dfgrs luminosity functions , finding significantly more luminosity density in both cases . using the measured photometric properties",
    ", one can reconstruct an isophotal magnitude similar to that of any given survey ( albeit with azimuthally averaged light profiles ) .",
    "when we do so for the lcrs and for 2dfgrs , we find our results are consistent with theirs .",
    "these results demonstrate that the lcrs and 2dfgrs are missing significant fractions of the light in the universe because their measurements of galaxy magnitudes are based on fairly bright isophotes .",
    "the lcrs photometry is expressed in its own variant of the @xmath227 band , a hybrid of gunn @xmath47 and the kron - cousins @xmath227 band , which we will denote @xmath18 following @xcite .",
    "this band can be related to sdss magnitudes as follows ( @xcite ; @xcite ) : @xmath228 we use this transformation to calculate @xmath18-band petrosian magnitudes for all sdss galaxies , corrected for galactic extinction . using the method described in section [ method ] for defining complete samples in @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14",
    ", we define a complete sample in @xmath18 by setting a flux limit of @xmath229 . for consistency with @xcite , who calculate the @xmath18-band luminosity function in the lcrs",
    ", we use an einstein - de sitter universe in this case .",
    "the results are listed in table [ rbj_table ] .",
    "the top panel of figure [ lf_lcrs ] shows the @xmath227-band luminosity function determined from the sdss in this way and compares our result to that of @xcite .",
    "the two luminosity functions diverge at low and high luminosities for the reasons discussed in section [ isopetro ] : isophotal magnitudes underestimate the luminosities of low luminosity galaxies because of their low intrinsic surface brightnesses , and of high luminosity galaxies because of cosmological surface brightness dimming .",
    "the ratio of the @xmath227-band luminosity density found by @xcite to that found here is @xmath230 .",
    "that is , there is ( at least ) twice as much @xmath18-band light in the universe than found by the lcrs .",
    "rbj_table ] lists these results , along with the conversions of the luminosity densities to solar units ( assuming @xmath231 , using the results of @xcite and the relation @xmath232 from @xcite ; these choices are consistent with the results quoted by @xcite ) .",
    "let us now analyze the sdss images using the same method as used in the lcrs .",
    "first , we use isophotal magnitudes limited at @xmath233 ; this number approximately corresponds to the statement of @xcite that the lcrs isophotal magnitudes are limited at 15% of the sky brightness .",
    "second , @xcite exclude galaxies of low `` central surface brightness , '' as measured by the magnitude within a fixed angular aperture about the size of a fiber .",
    "similarly , we apply a `` central surface brightness '' cut based on the `` fiber magnitude , '' an aperture magnitude with a @xmath36 diameter .",
    "following @xcite , we define the fiber magnitude cut to be : @xmath234 finally , for consistency we calculate the @xmath74-corrections using the formula @xmath235 , as @xcite did ( although this makes rather little difference in our results ) .",
    "the bottom panel of figure [ lf_lcrs ] shows the comparison of the resulting luminosity function to that of @xcite .",
    "they are largely consistent , except that the sdss sample has a slightly brighter @xmath145 ; this difference may persist because our isophotal limit is not precisely what lcrs used .",
    "nevertheless , the general consistency shows that the extra flux detected in the sdss in the top panel is most likely real , and that the missing light in the lcrs is due to having shallow isophotes and excluding galaxies with low central surface brightnesses . to understand",
    "how much is due to the central surface brightness cut of equation ( [ mfiber ] ) , we list results in table [ rbj_table ] for the case in which we do not apply this cut ; this test indicates that the central magnitude cut is responsible for a substantial portion of the underestimate in the luminosity density .",
    "the 2dfgrs sample is based on apm plates ( @xcite ) and uses the @xmath19 band . here",
    "we relate the sdss photometry to @xmath19 using the relation @xmath236 determined using the results of @xcite and the galaxy color relation @xmath237 from @xcite .",
    "we follow the same procedure as for the lcrs in the previous section to create a sample limited at @xmath238 . again , for consistency with @xcite , we assume an einstein - de sitter universe . while our results are much closer to those of 2dfgrs than they were to the lcrs , we still measure about 1.4 times the luminosity density that @xcite do , as we show in figure [ lf_apm ] .",
    "this difference is significant , given that the stated errors in the @xmath19 luminosity density in the 2dfgrs are about 5% , and the errors for the sdss are about 15% .",
    "rbj_table ] lists these results , now using @xmath239 to convert to solar units ( determined using the stellar color relation @xmath240 from @xcite and the results of @xcite ) .",
    "let us analyze the sdss images using the methods used by 2dfgrs .",
    "apm magnitudes are isophotally limited at @xmath241 mag per square arcsecond , and then corrected to total magnitudes by assuming that the galaxy profile is a circularly symmetric gaussian ( @xcite ) . after determining these `` apm - like '' magnitudes for sdss galaxies , and applying a flux limit of @xmath242",
    ", we again calculate the luminosity function .",
    "this flux limit is considerably shallower than that of the 2dfgrs .",
    "thus , the mean redshift is lower , and to accurately match the isophotal limits would require a slightly brighter isophotal limit ; we have instead decided to err on the side of including a little more flux .",
    "the result is shown in the bottom panel of figure [ lf_apm ] .",
    "the sdss luminosity function determined in this manner is nearly identical to the 2dfgrs luminosity function .",
    "( although the schechter parameters are rather different , it is clear from the figure that the values are nearly degenerate ) . given our estimated errors and the fact that our @xmath19 sample is considerably shallower than that of the 2dfgrs , this agreement of the two results is somewhat surprising .",
    "this result indicates that the 40% difference in luminosity density between the sdss and 2dfgrs is due to the fact that the apm isophotal limits exclude a significant amount of light in the outer regions of galaxies , even when corrected . for comparison",
    ", we also give results in table [ rbj_table ] for the case of @xmath243 isophotal magnitudes , with no correction to `` total '' magnitudes based on the gaussian model .",
    "these results show that while the apm corrections work in the right direction , the gaussian model is an insufficient description of observed galaxy profiles for extrapolation to `` total '' magnitudes .",
    "we have presented the luminosity function and luminosity density of galaxies in five optical bandpasses ( @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath1 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 ) using @xmath244 galaxies in sdss commissioning data .",
    "the schechter function appears to be a good fit in all cases , with a low - luminosity slope that is remarkably similar in all bandpasses . on the other hand ,",
    "the slope @xmath146 is sensitive to galaxy surface brightness , color , and morphology .",
    "the redshift distribution of the galaxies is generally consistent with our derived luminosity function , although large - scale structure is still evident in our sample .",
    "we have demonstrated the correlation between @xmath1 luminosity and galaxy surface brightness , color , and morphology . in particular , we have shown that luminous galaxies tend to be higher surface brightness , redder , and more concentrated than less luminous galaxies , in accordance with previous results . we find that galaxies obey a strong magnitude - surface brightness relation .",
    "there is a high characteristic half - light surface brightness for luminous galaxies ; at the same time , low - luminosity galaxies show a broad surface brightness distribution , with many low surface brightness objects .",
    "as described above , refinements of the photometric analysis beyond the standard software used for the survey will improve our understanding of these correlations .",
    "for example , a better understanding of the effects of seeing , inclination , and internal dust extinction will improve our measures of surface brightness and morphology .",
    "improvements in our estimates of @xmath74-corrections , which will be possible using both the spectroscopy and the five - band photometry of the sdss , will improve our understanding of the distribution of galaxy colors and allow us to estimate the stellar mass function of galaxies .",
    "work in progress on the spectral classification of sdss galaxies ( _ e.g. _ , @xcite ) is showing the same trends of galaxy type with luminosity found here .",
    "we have shown that a considerable fraction of the luminosity density in the universe has been missed by previous samples that were based on shallower imaging .",
    "we measure 2 times the @xmath18-band luminosity density found in the lcrs and 1.4 times the @xmath19-band luminosity density found in the 2dfgrs .",
    "work in progress , which directly compares the measured magnitudes of galaxies in these surveys to sdss magnitudes in the regions where the surveys overlap , will test whether these differences are indeed reasonable . while large - scale structure could still have some effect on results from these surveys ,",
    "our internal tests show that the differences of results are almost certainly due to our adoption of petrosian magnitudes in preference to isophotal magnitudes .",
    "in particular , we can reproduce the lcrs and 2dfgrs results if we mimic their photometry and selection effects . the high luminosity density found by",
    "the sdss implies that the cosmic density of stellar matter @xmath245 is higher than previously thought .",
    "if this is the case , it may relieve some of the strain on galaxy formation models , which typically predict a higher density of stellar matter than previous observational estimates ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "our estimates of the luminosity density , given in tables [ lf_table ] and [ rbj_table ] , are almost certainly still underestimates .",
    "first , for the case of de vaucouleurs profiles , we know that up to 18% of the galaxy light may be missed by the petrosian magnitudes as we define them . including this light would increase somewhat the total luminosity density found here ( though only by a few percent , because de vaucouleurs profile galaxies constitute only about 20% of all galaxies ) .",
    "second , we have shown that while the explicit surface brightness limit @xmath246 of the commissioning data exclude only 0.5% of galaxies , these galaxies very likely represent a larger fraction of the luminosity density than that ; for example , only 1.5% of galaxies are in the range @xmath247 , but such galaxies are responsible for @xmath30 5% of the luminosity in the universe",
    ". the deeper surface - brightness limit of the main sdss survey will thus provide a more complete estimate of the luminosity density in the universe .",
    "third , our estimates assume a constant low luminosity slope @xmath146 .",
    "an upturn in the luminosity function at absolute magnitudes less luminous than @xmath248 , suggested by some studies ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , would mean there was yet more luminosity not included in this analysis .",
    "a final possibility , related to the previous one , is that a significant fraction of stars exist outside of galactic environments , having perhaps been tidally stripped from their galaxy of birth . as more sdss data is obtained and we perform more sophisticated analyses of the various selection effects in the survey , we will be able to address many of these problems .",
    "tables of the non - parametric fits to the luminosity function in each band and the joint relationships between luminosity and surface brightness , color , and concentration , are available on the world wide web .",
    "we expect that these results and the parametric fits in table [ lf_table ] , which represent a straightforward analysis of only a small fraction ( one percent ) of the expected sdss sample , will already provide interesting new constraints on theories of galaxy formation .",
    "in addition , this characterization of the luminosities , surface brightnesses , colors , and morphologies of local galaxies provides a solid baseline for interpreting the evolution of galaxies observed at higher redshift .",
    "future work with the sdss will allow us to explore the correlations between all of these properties and to describe fully the population of galaxies in the local universe",
