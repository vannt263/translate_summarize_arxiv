    "isospin is in very good approximation a symmetry of the strong interactions . at the fundamental level",
    ", isospin breaking occurs as a consequence of the electromagnetic interactions and the mass difference of the @xmath6 and @xmath7 quarks .",
    "the numerical value of the fine structure constant and the fact that @xmath8 is small compared to @xmath9 explains why this is a symmetry good at the few percent level . in this work",
    "we are concerned with the isospin and its breaking in the @xmath4 resonances .",
    "the experimental tests of this symmetry requires the precise determination of the mass and width of the charged and neutral states , a non trivial task since a precise definition of these quantities must be adopted .",
    "the values compilated by the particle data group @xcite for the @xmath0 mass and width are spread over a wide range .",
    "this is an unpleasent characteristic since one expects these intrinsic properties to be independent of the process where the resonance is observed and also to be model and background independent .",
    "this is related to the fact that different expressions are used to fit the data leading to different values for the parameters -  that one is tempted to identify with the physical mass and width  - which however are relevant only for the model under consideration .",
    "although this is a practical way to deal with the @xmath4 meson physics , _",
    "i.e. _ use a given parametrization and the corresponding values for the mass and width , the process and model independence of the physical quantities associated to any resonance are relevant from the conceptual point of view .",
    "the analysis of the experimental data @xcite is based on theoretical assumptions such as a parametrization derived in terms of analyticity and unitarity @xcite , a breit - wigner which incorporates an energy dependent width reflecting the p - wave nature of the @xmath4 and higher isovector - vector resonances @xcite or still phenomenological effective field theories @xcite .",
    "there is a priori no reason to favour any of these approaches in the description of physical process , on the contrary one would expect them to yield complementary or at least consistent information .",
    "all of them share two characteristics : _",
    "i ) _ they involve a momentum dependent width @xmath10 , and _",
    "ii ) _ they define the resonance mass @xmath11 as the energy for which the real part of the propagator is zero and the width as @xmath12 .",
    "we will refer collectively to them as the _ conventional _ , as opposed to the _ pole _ approach to be discussed next . on the other hand , the @xmath1 matrix formalism @xcite relates the mass and width of the resonance to pole(s ) of the amplitude in the complex plane .",
    "the pole associated to a given resonance is independent of the process where it is observed @xcite , thus this scheme offers the possibility to get an unambiguous determination of the intrinsic properties of the resonance . for the @xmath0",
    "this has been done in @xcite .",
    "the @xmath1 matrix formalism not only provides a convenient parametrization in terms of which the electromagnetic form factor of the pion can be expressed , but it can also be applied to any of results of the conventional approach . in fact",
    "we have two possibilities : the first is to make an expansion around the pole position of the expressions used in the conventional approach and then fit the data .",
    "we already know the result of such a procedure since in all cases the form factor will reduce to the @xmath1 matrix formalism , and the fit using this scheme was performed in @xcite .",
    "alternatively , fits to the data can be carried using the conventional parametrization and then , given the expression used and the parameters obtained in fitting the data , one can determine the associated pole .",
    "it is our purpose in this letter to perform the latter analysis considering fits reported for @xmath13 and for the tau decay @xmath3 which allow us to make a statement about the size of isospin violation in the @xmath14- @xmath15 system within a framework in which the masses and widths are unambiguously defined .",
    "we also consider the problem from the theoretical point of view . to this end",
    "we take into account both possible sources of isospin violation : the @xmath16 mass difference and the electromagnetic interactions , which is implemented at the hadron level by the use of vector meson dominance .",
    "the former contribution is known to vanish to lowest order implying thus a finite result for the latter .",
    "the explicit calculation of the one loop electromagnetic self energy shows that a finite result can be achieved only when the anomalous magnetic moment @xmath17 entering the three @xmath4 vector meson vertex ( vector meson dominated @xmath18 vertex ) takes the value @xmath19 .",
    "we briefly comment on this point .",
    "within the * conventional approach * , near the @xmath4 resonance , the electromagnetic form factor of the pion is parametrized in terms of a breit - wigner with a momentum dependent width :    f_(s ) = a(s )  d(s )  ;  d(s)=s - m_^2(s)+im_(s)_(s ) [ conven ]    although some expressions ocurring in the literature seem to differ from eq.([conven ] ) they can be cast in that form by an appropiated redefinition of @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "for example if instead of @xmath21 , we use @xmath23 , @xmath24 should be changed to :        since in the conventional approach the mass and width of the resonance are defined respectively by    re ( d(m_^2))=0  ;  and  im(d(m_^2)=m _ _ ,    the freedom in the choice of parametrization ( compare eqs.([conven],[scale ] ) ) implies an arbitrariness in the mass and width deffinition . on the other hand",
    ", the * @xmath1 matrix approach * @xcite avoids this problem by considering a simple observable pole with @xmath25 independent width and residue : f_(s)=r_p  s - s_p+b(s ) ,    where @xmath26 is the pole position , @xmath27 the pole residue and @xmath28 is the remaining part around the pole . in order that this description makes sense the remaining part @xmath28 ( which is fixed by the fit to the data ) should be a soft function of @xmath25 affecting minimally the pole position , except for obvious resonance effects as in @xmath29 mixing @xcite .",
    "in this formalism the mass @xmath30 and width @xmath20 of the resonance are deffined through :    s_p = m^2-im .",
    "[ pole ]    the fact that the background is a soft function arround the pole ( in this case for @xmath31 ) , does not imply that it can not have poles at other energies , however these can be included in an appropiated way in the background .",
    "different parametrizations within the conventional approach correspond to different backgrounds in the @xmath1 matrix formalism .",
    "thus even though the mass and width values obtained from a given `` conventional '' treatment are only relevant for that particular parametrization , on physical grounds one expects that all of them have a pole in the same position providing thus , through eq.([pole ] ) , the physical mass and width of the resonance .",
    "notice that in finding the pole @xmath32 no information about the overall normalization nor about @xmath21 is required , as one would expect from the @xmath1 matrix approach .",
    "the cleanest determination of the @xmath4 mass and width comes from the @xmath33 anihilation and tau - lepton decay data , which are in agreement with each other up to an overall normalization factor @xcite .",
    "although several analysis for the @xmath13 @xcite and @xmath34 @xcite data have been performed , we concentrate in the results of the aleph collaboration @xcite which seems to us the best suited for a study of isospin breaking since a combined fit to both sets of data was carried by these authors .",
    "notice however that the agreement is excellent with the fit to the data of the high statistics experiment by the cleo collaboration @xcite .",
    "the @xmath14 , @xmath15 masses and widths resulting from the analysis in @xcite and the values associated to the corresponding pole position are summarized in table 1 for the masses and table 2 for the widths .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     table 2 .",
    "widths of the @xmath14 and @xmath15 resonances as obtained by barate _ et al _ @xcite ( second and fourth column ) from a combined fit to @xmath13 and @xmath3 data .",
    "for comparison in the third and fifth column we quote the values associated to the corresponding pole .",
    "details about the notation can be found in the quoted literature .",
    "the results are remarkable . while in the conventional approach",
    "the masses are spread over a 10 mev range , the @xmath1 matrix formalism leads values that differ at most in 1.3 mev .",
    "similarly for the width where the two approaches yield values differing , within each scheme , in 14 and 2 mevs respectively .",
    "we can safely conclude that in contradistinction to the conventional approach the pole position is independent of the details of the parametrization used to fit the data providing thus an unambiguous definition for the mass and width of the @xmath4 .",
    "it is worth remarking that the mass and width values we obtained applying the @xmath1 matrix formalism to different parametrizations of the conventional approach agree with previous anlysis performed fully in the @xmath1 matrix formalism @xcite but are systematically below the values obtained in the conventional approach and the value reported by the pdg @xcite .",
    "as far as the isospin breaking is concerned , both schemes lead similar results .",
    "although in the conventional approach there is a strong dependence upon the parametrization used to fit the data , it is the same for the charged and neutral channels and it cancels out when differences are considered",
    ". let us emphasize again that the advantage of the pole approach is that it is based on an unambiguous definition of the mass and width and so , besides a nearly vanishing @xmath35 mass difference we have a precise knowledge of each mass and width .",
    "the isospin violation in the coupling constants , @xmath36 , implied by the pole decay rates is also consistent with zero , @xmath37 and @xmath38 are equal up to one percent .    when applying the @xmath1 matrix formalism to one of the parametrizations used in the conventional approach , as we have done , the uncertainty in the pole position follow from the result of the original fit .",
    "in order to calculate the errors quoted in tables 1 and 2 , we used the following procedure : we obtain the pole position using the central value of the parameters obtained from the fit , we then determine the variation of the pole position when the parameters of the fit are changed by one standard deviation .",
    "we quote for the pole position error the maximun variation found in this way .",
    "one further comment regards the @xmath39 parameter @xcite used in the second version of the gounaris - sakurai parametrization @xcite .",
    "@xmath39 modify the @xmath25 dependence of the @xmath4 decay width and it also changes the analytical structure obtained in an effective field theory .",
    "notice that the errors are much larger when @xmath39 is left as a free parameter , _",
    "i.e. _ when the @xmath25 dependence is not the one predicted by the effective field theory @xcite .",
    "in this section we consider the theoretical evaluation of the @xmath41 mass difference . in order to calculate the contribution due to the @xmath42 mass difference , we need to evaluate the matrix element of the flavour symmetry breaking hamiltonian @xmath43 .",
    "the matrix elements between @xmath4 states can be written as : & < |&(m_u |uu  +  m_d |dd  +  m_s |ss)| >  =  1 ( m_u - m_d)<||uu  -  |dd    + 1 ( m_u+&m_d&-2m_s)<||uu+ |dd-2 |ss | > + 1 ( m_u+m_d+m_s)<||uu+ |dd+ |ss     the operators entering in the two last matrix elements are singlet under @xmath44 , therefore they give the same contribution to the @xmath45 and @xmath15 and thus , do not contribute to the mass difference .",
    "on the other hand the first matrix element vanishes identical as consequence of @xmath46 parity .",
    "we therefore conclude that to lowest order in ( @xmath42 ) the @xmath47 mas difference vanishes :    m_^  -  m_^0 | _",
    "m_u m_d  =  0 .",
    "this result has an important implication . since the @xmath48 quark masses have completely disappeared from our calculations , there are no fundamental constants of the underlying qcd theory which could be used to renormalize ,",
    "_ i.e. _ to absorbe possible divergencies appearing in the calculation",
    ". therefore the electromagnetic self - mass contribution must be finite @xcite .",
    "later on we will see that the same conclusion can and has been reached @xcite using different arguments .",
    "let us now consider the second source of isospin breaking , the electromagnetic interactions .",
    "the lowest order contributions are shown in fig .",
    "1(@xmath49 ) , where @xmath50 stands for a pseudoscalar meson which in our case can be either @xmath51 , @xmath52 or @xmath53 , @xmath54 denotes an axial vector and @xmath55 or @xmath56 enters through vector meson dominance .",
    "the first diagramm is non vanishing for the charged @xmath4 and vanishes for the @xmath15 .",
    "diagram @xmath57 is non vanishing ( @xmath58 or @xmath56 ) both for the charged and neutral contribution .",
    "notice furthermore that the @xmath52 or @xmath53 can be intermediate state only for the neutral @xmath15 self - energy .",
    "we will neglect the contribution of the @xmath52 and @xmath53 as we expect these to be small ( one hundred times smaller than the contribution of diagram @xmath59 ) . on the other hand",
    ", the contribution from the loop with an internal pion yields the same contribution for the charged and neutral @xmath4 s .",
    "the third diagramm vanishes identically when @xmath60 due to @xmath46 parity and gives the same contribution to the @xmath14 and @xmath15 self - mass when @xmath58 or @xmath56 and therefore does not contribute to the mass difference .",
    "figures @xmath7 and @xmath59 are non - vanishing and contribute only to the charged and neutral meson mass respectively .",
    "thus , in the model we are considering , the @xmath14  -  @xmath15 mass difference is given by the contributions shown in fig . 1 ( @xmath61 and @xmath59 ) .",
    "to describe the photon @xmath4 vertex we use vector meson dominance , so that the @xmath4 form factor is modeled by a @xmath4 propagator .",
    "the feynman rules for the electromagnetic interaction of a charged massive spin @xmath62 vector meson can be found in @xcite .",
    "these rules depend upon the anomalous magnetic moment @xmath17 of the vector meson . using these rules , we find that the correction to the @xmath14 mass is given by ( for later use we introduce obvious notation for the loop integrals of @xmath63 and @xmath64 ) :    = 350 pt     +    one loop electromagnetic contribution to the self - mass of the @xmath4 .",
    "vector meson dominance is used to describe the coupling of the photon to the hadrons .",
    "p stands for a pseudoscalar ( @xmath51 , @xmath52 or @xmath53 ) , v for a vector meson ( @xmath4 , @xmath65 or @xmath56 ) and @xmath66 for the axial vector @xmath5 .",

    "@xcite the same conclusion was reached using completely different arguments ( based on dispersion relations and regge pole theory ) .",
    "furthermore one expects the @xmath72 vertex to be symmetric in the indices , which is achieved only if @xmath73 . taking that value for @xmath17 and @xmath74 we get :    ^_m_^  =  ^_m^2_^ 2 m _",

    "our result is consistent with a previous calculations by bijnens and gosdzinsky @xcite who using a different approach find @xmath77 .",

    "we have argued that the electromagnetic self - mass should be finite and we have shown that this result is obtained when the elctromagnetic coupling of the @xmath4 is modeled using vector meson dominance and the @xmath4 anomalous magnetic moment @xmath17 takes the value @xmath19 .",
    "the model satisfactorily describes the observed isospin breaking .",
    "let us finally comment that the parametrization independence of the pole position holds when a larger set of fits is considered .",
    "indeed when the typical parametrizations used in ref.@xcite are analyzed along the lines of this work ( except for the fit called vmd2(nu ) @xcite , which as pointed out by the author leads to a @xmath84 compared to the @xmath85 of all the others fits ) the mass values associated to the pole are spread over a five mev region arround 758 mev , in contrast to the 25 mev arround 767 mev obtained in the conventional approach .",
    "a similar situation holds for the width where the spreads are respectively 7 and 22 mev and the central values 143 and 151 mev respectively .",
