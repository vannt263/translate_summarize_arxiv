    "the recent discovery of layered fese based superconductors @xcite has reinforced the view that the quasi 2d structure of high temperature superconductors is important to obtain significant transition temperatures .",
    "however , this leads to a conundrum : a small interlayer hopping , @xmath2 , destroys 3d coherence of pair motion such that a purely two dimensional system should not superconduct .",
    "conversely , a large @xmath2 increases the kinetic energy to the point that pairs are destroyed and @xmath3 goes down as a result .",
    "the focus of this work is the effect of interlayer hopping @xmath2 on the condensation temperature , @xmath3 , of local fermionic pairs formed in a model of intersite attraction , @xmath0 , and local coulomb repulsion , @xmath1 .",
    "the question that we seek to answer with the present paper is whether there is an optimal anisotropy associated with particle transport that leads to an enhancement in the transition temperature at moderate interlayer hopping .",
    "the existence of such a maximum in the transition temperature would point to anisotropy as a key feature in high @xmath3 supreconductors . in the following",
    ", it is shown that @xmath3 is maximal when the underlying single fermion spectrum is strongly anisotropic .",
    "a feature of fese and cuprate superconductors is believed to be the formation of local pairs above the superconducting transition temperature , that then bose condense to form a superconductor @xcite .",
    "since these pairs are formed above the transition temperature they are often known as preformed pairs .",
    "the existence of local pairs above the transition temperature provides an intuitive explaination of a number of normal and superconducting properties of the cuprates , including the pseudogap  @xcite .",
    "preformed pair superconductors form in the following way  @xcite : ( i ) the attractive interaction between two charged fermions is sufficiently strong to form a bound state in the absence of a fermi surface .",
    "( ii ) at low carrier densities , the fermion pairs behave approximately as bosons and undergo bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) as temperature is dropped below the transition temperature .",
    "macroscopically , bec of pairs manifests itself as superconductivity .",
    "( iii ) at high densities , the pairs begin to overlap and the fermions experience additional repulsion due to the exclusion principle .",
    "such ` overcrowding '  @xcite gradually evaporates pairs as the density increases .",
    "superconductivity either transitions to the bcs regime or is destroyed altogether .    in a quasi 2d system , the condensation temperature of an anisotropic ideal bose gas in _ continuous _ space is given by @xmath4 which also applies to local pairs of fermions if the pairs are well separated .",
    "here @xmath5 is the volumetric density of bosons and @xmath6 is the @xmath7-th component of the boson s effective mass .",
    "since @xmath3 is an increasing function of @xmath5 , it can be systematically raised by increasing @xmath5 until the bosons are close packed .",
    "thus @xmath3 is maximal when @xmath5 is approximately equal to an inverse volume of the boson @xmath8 .",
    "such a maximal @xmath3 will be referred to as the _ close packed _ condensation temperature and denoted @xmath9 . in continuous space , it is given by @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is a dimensionless constant @xmath12 that accounts for the approximate nature of the argument .",
    "this formula can also be applied to lattice fermion pairs that behave approximately as hard core bosons .",
    "the coefficient is different but the dependence on the pair volume @xmath13 and pair effective masses @xmath14 and @xmath15 , is the same @xmath16 lattice bound states have two key properties .",
    "( i ) at large binding energies @xmath17 , the effective pair mass scales  @xcite as @xmath18 .",
    "( ii ) the volume of a fermion pair on a lattice , @xmath13 , must approach one lattice cell at strong coupling @xmath19 .",
    "conversely , the volume diverges at weak coupling : @xmath20 as @xmath21 .",
    "realistic models for local pairing comprise a short - range repulsive part originating from direct coulomb repulsion and a mid - range weak attractive part  @xcite which is thought to result from overscreening of the coulomb tails by phonons , magnons or other mediating excitations .",
    "the simplest potential of such kind that still allows ( partial ) analytical treatment consists of a strong on - site hubbard repulsion @xmath1 and an _ instantaneous _",
    "nearest neighbor attraction @xmath0 .",
    "hereafter , such a potential will be called the @xmath22 model .",
    "consider the effect of @xmath0 on @xmath23 .",
    "( from now on , the subscript ` lat ' will be omitted . ) at small @xmath0 close to the binding threshold , the effective pair volume @xmath13 diverges , and @xmath24 . in the opposite limit of large @xmath0",
    ", the pair volume tends to a constant whereas all the masses scale as @xmath25 . as a result , @xmath26 .",
    "thus @xmath23 tends to zero at both small and large @xmath0 , which implies a maximum at some intermediate optimal @xmath0 .",
    "likewise , there is an optimal interlayer hopping @xmath2",
    ". a large @xmath27 increases the overall kinetic energy and may destroy the pairs ( at small or intermediate @xmath0 ) . thus a large @xmath2 is analogous to a weak attraction , and @xmath24 .",
    "( the quasi-1d case @xmath28 is not a subject of this paper . )",
    "conversely , a very small @xmath2 produces a large interlayer mass @xmath29 and destroys 3d coherence .",
    "again , a vanishing condensation temperature results .",
    "therefore , one might expect to arrive at a generic phase diagram shown in figure  [ uv3d : fig : one ] .",
    "the purpose of the current work is to demonstrate the features of this phase diagram in a microscopic model .",
    "is too small then pairing does not occur . for large @xmath0 pairs",
    "become heavy , and eventually phase separate destroying superconductivity .",
    "if @xmath2 is too small , then 3d coherence and therefore superconductivity is lost .",
    "large @xmath2 leads to excess kinetic energy that also breaks pairs .",
    "therefore an optimal superconductor might be expected to have intermediate @xmath0 and @xmath2.,scaledwidth=60.0% ]    let us address applicability of the ideal bec formula ( [ 3uv2d : eq : three ] ) to dense systems .",
    "first , we note that even a strong boson - boson repulsion does not affect the critical temperature very much . even in superfluid @xmath30he , which is a strongly interacting system ,",
    "the critical temperature is only about 30% less than the bec value . within our approach , such an uncertainty",
    "is easily absorbed into the uncertainty of @xmath31 .",
    "secondly , @xmath31 will be set to be smaller than 1 , for reasons outlined in section  [ uv3d : sec : threefour ] .",
    "selecting a small value for @xmath31 is effectively the same as diluting the system , thereby reducing the pair - pair interaction .",
    "since the wave function decays exponentially , we estimate that the inter - pair interaction is of the order 1% or less of the total intra - pair interaction strength for all values of @xmath31 used in this paper .",
    "exact derivation of the inter - pair potential requires solving a four - fermion problem , which goes beyond the capabilities of the present method . at the same time , the _ sign _ of the effective interaction is important for the phenomenon of phase separation discussed here .",
    "it is known from analysis of three fermions that a fermion pair repels a third fermion in a pure 2d system  @xcite .",
    "the repulsion is due to the exclusion principle acting between a pair member and the extra fermion .",
    "this argument , being qualitative , should remain valid for four fermions ( two boson pairs ) in a quasi-2d system .",
    "one can speculate that the pair - pair interaction is repulsive at least in a finite parameter region above the pairing threshold .",
    "the work presented in this paper goes beyond previous work by presenting exact analytical and numerical solutions for local pairing in quasi-2d systems , and is to our knowledge the first detailed study using exact results to study the effect of anisotropy on local pairing and superconductivity .",
    "the paper is organised as follows : in section  [ uv3d : sec : three ] we analyze the problem in detail within a phenomenological lattice model that includes anisotropic hopping @xmath2 , on - site hubbard repulsion @xmath1 and intersite attraction @xmath0 : the tetragonal @xmath22 model .",
    "exact expressions for two - fermion energy , dispersion , wave function , and effective radius are combined to derive the conditions of pair close packing .",
    "numerical results including the model phase diagram are given in section  [ uv3d : sec : four ] , where we also present a quantum monte carlo analysis of two fermions coupled by a retarded interaction mediated by phonons , showing that models with retardation effects also have a peak in @xmath3 as @xmath2 varies .",
    "finally , a summary and conclusions are given in section  [ uv3d : sec : six ] .",
    "in this section , we make exact calculations for the properties of local pairs in an _ anisotropic _ @xmath22 model .",
    "the @xmath22 model can be derived from a number of interactions , such as the electron - phonon interaction , electron - spin wave interaction and @xmath32 model , as has been extensively discussed in the literature  @xcite . in the model studied here , hopping and interaction within an @xmath33-plane is assumed isotropic .",
    "the difference with previous work is that both bare fermion hopping and nearest - neighbor attraction between the layers may differ from corresponding in - plane values . to reflect lattice symmetries ,",
    "the model will be referred to as the _ tetragonal _ @xmath22 model .",
    "the main calculation tool in this section is the equality of a bose integral to an inverse pair volume @xmath34 where again @xmath35 is a constant that is less than 1 .",
    "[ note that the constant @xmath35 is slightly different from @xmath31 since it appears directly above @xmath36 , rather than @xmath37 . ]",
    "@xmath38 is the bottom of the pair energy band , that is the value that the pair chemical potential assumes at condensation ( a similar integral is used to compute the expressions in ( [ 3uv2d : eq : one ] ) and ( [ 3uv2d : eq : three ] ) ) .",

    "indeed , so long as the pairs do not overlap , @xmath3 can be increased further by adding more pairs since @xmath204 . in the opposite limit of pairs overlapping heavily , the additional repulsion brought by the exclusion principle evaporates the pairs and destroys local _ pair _ superconductivity .",
