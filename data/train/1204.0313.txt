    "attempts were made to reproduce the split times recorded during the men s 400 m and 800 m world record races . during the men s 400 m world record race ( duration 43.18 s ) , the athletes started from starting blocks equipped with electronic force sensors .",
    "the time elapsed between the start of the race and significant force generation by michael johnson was recorded to be 0.150 s.@xcite the ed model , map model , and x - factor model were therefore made to represent an athlete who remained motionless at the start for 0.150 s , and crossed the finish line at 43.18 s.    split times for the ed and map models were computed by using the published model parameters to generate pacing strategies .",

    "no blocks were used during the men s 800 m world record race .",
    "the motionless period at the start was estimated to be 0.3 s , and 200 m split time was determined to be 24.5 s , from video analysis by the author ; 400 m split time was given by track and field news as 48.9 s ;  @xcite 600 m split time and finish time are from ref . .",
    "split times for the ed and map models were again computed from published model parameters , resulting in races finished in 105.95 s ( ed model ) and 104.38 s ( map model ) , and then scaled to the world record finishing time as before .",

    "the x - factor accumulation model predicts each of the split times much better than either of the other two models .    it must be stressed that the mathematical functions used here for x - factor accumulation rate @xmath1 , while plausible , were chosen for analytic convenience and are not the result of a theory of x - factor accumulation .",
    "however , the result that the optimal pacing strategy for 400 m and 800 m races is to start at a pace faster than can be sustained until the end of the race is robust , and not dependent on the particular function used for x - factor accumulation rate .",
    "the traditional view is that muscles cease to function during high - intensity , anaerobic exercise due to a buildup of @xmath92 ions , which presumably leads to deactivation of enzymes needed for energy production .",
    "the strongest support for this comes from the many studies of athletes performing various high - intensity exercises to voluntary exhaustion .",
    "for example , sahlin et al .",
    "@xcite found via biopsy that the intracellular ph in the working muscle ( quadriceps femoris ) in exhausted cyclists had dropped from a baseline of 7.0 to 6.4 , while costill et al .",
    "@xcite found via biopsy that the ph in the gastrocnemius , after an all - out 400 m sprint , had dropped from a baseline of 7.03 to 6.63 , and theorized that runners , needing to maintain upright posture , could not tolerate so low a ph as cyclists .",
    "furthermore , ingestion of bicarbonate (  soda loading \" ) improves an athlete s capacity for intense anaerobic exercise , perhaps due to increased extracellular buffering of @xmath93 .",
    "@xcite    this traditional view is challenged by a variety of recent research results .",
    "for example , the ph of working muscles does not monotonically decrease during anaerobic exercise : upon initiation of exercise , there is a transient increase .",
    "@xcite this transient alkalosis is presumed to result from production of atp by splitting of phosphocreatine , a process which consumes @xmath92 ions .",
    "@xcite an alternative explanation that has been advanced for the cessation of function of the working muscles in 400 m runners is the depletion of phosphocreatine in the working muscles .",
    "@xcite for a review of literature challenging the traditional view , see allen et al .",
    "@xcite    since no single biochemical species may be unequivocally identified as the x - factor , it is suggested that the x - factor is best thought of as entropy . in making this suggestion ,",
    "no attempt is made to favor one or another of the competing biochemical hypotheses concerning the cause of cessation of muscle function in high - intensity exercise , or to suggest that inadequate heat dissipation is the cause .",
    "rather , the suggestion is made that a muscle at rest may be considered from the point of view of irreversible thermodynamics as a non - equilibrium stationary state , in which entropy - producing processes are sustained at constant levels by continual fluxes of energy and matter , and efflux of entropy .",
    "see chapter 1 of ref . for background to this perspective .    if the x - factor represents entropy , then @xmath4 represents entropy density , and eq .",
    "( [ eq : x_diff_eq ] ) is to be interpreted as the continuity equation for entropy regarding an entropy - rich region ( a working muscle ) , of entropy density @xmath4 , enclosed by a boundary that is resistant to the efflux of entropy , and surrounded by an entropy - poor region .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : x_diff_eq ] ) results by assuming the amount of entropy that crosses the barrier is insufficient to significantly raise the entropy density in the external region .",
    "the quantity @xmath6 describes the rate of diffusive efflux of entropy from the entropy - rich region .",
    "the function @xmath1 , describing the rate of generation of entropy as a function of running speed , is expected to grow at least as fast with @xmath2 as the rate of consumption of energy .",
    "therefore it should satisfy @xmath94 , since the runner encounters velocity - dependent frictional forces , such as air resistance .    with this interpretation , the difference in race tactics employed in 400 m and 800 m races from the pacing strategies employed in shorter and longer races is understood as follows .",
    "shorter races do not lead to high enough entropy density to cause loss of function in muscles . for longer races , the advantages of starting fast are blunted because the entropy density outside the working muscle ( for example , in the blood ) can no longer be considered small compared to the entropy density inside the working muscle . only in the 400 m and 800 m races",
    "is the entropy efflux term important enough to recommend positive - split pacing .",
    "the x - factor accumulation model suggests that runners training for 400 m and 800 m races should perform exercises that maximize the entropy density gradient across the boundaries of the working muscles in the legs .",
    "this might be expected to increase the abilities of the working muscles to rid themselves of entropy by diffusion .",
    "it seems apparent that the best way to maximize the entropy density gradient is to ask muscles to perform work in the absence of blood flow .",
    "it has long been known that sustained muscular contraction reduces blood flow through the contracting muscle ,  @xcite and there seems agreement that cessation of blood flow can be accomplished by sustained contraction at greater than 60 - 70% of maximum voluntary force .",
    "@xcite this is within the range of sustained muscle force required during certain weightlifting exercises , such as squats , favored by sprinters .",
    "it may be speculated that , in addition to building muscular strength , such weightlifting exercises aid performance in the 400 m and 800 m races by increasing the abilities of the working muscles in the legs to rid themselves of entropy by diffusion .",
    "runners in 400 m and 800 m races are often urged to attempt to run the second half of the race at the same pace as the first (  even splits \" ) , on the grounds that this is the most economical distribution of energy , as no doubt it is . however , almost no successful runners in 400 m and 800 m races actually do this , and the burden of this paper has been to try to understand why .",
    "a simple model of entropy accumulation suggests that for any reasonable relation between entropy generation and speed , the optimal race strategy is to run the first half of the race faster than the second .",
    "such a strategy causes the entropy density gradient across the boundary of the working muscle to take on a large value early in the race , which increases the entropy efflux . that this is in fact the optimal race strategy is proven by the overwhelming preponderance of positive - split races in the set of world records for one - lap and two - lap races . since there are many other factors that athletes encounter in races , such as the race tactics of other athletes , as well as psychological variables , this analysis may not justify advising an athlete who prefers to run even - split , or even negative - split races , to adopt a different pacing strategy .",
    "however , one should not , on the basis of energy arguments , discourage an athlete who prefers to run positive - split 400 m or 800 m races from doing so , because it may be that the athlete knows best .",
