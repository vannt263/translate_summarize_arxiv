    "<S> we consider a chain described by a next - nearest - neighbor hopping combined with a nearest - neighbor spin flip . in two dimensions </S>",
    "<S> this three - body term arises from a mapping of the three - band hubbard model for cuo@xmath0 planes to a generalized @xmath1 model and for large o - o hopping favors resonance - valence - bond superconductivity of predominantly @xmath2-wave symmetry . solving the ground state and low - energy excitations by analytical and numerical methods we find that the chain is a luther - emery liquid with correlation exponent @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the particle density .    </S>",
    "<S> pacs number : 74.20.-z , 71.27.+a , 75.10.jm    recently , there has been a considerable interest in obtaining the exact ground state of different strongly correlated systems , using a variety of techniques @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> although in some cases the model or the parameters are rather unrealistic , exact results are useful in clarifying the effect of different physical ingredients and as a test of approximations . </S>",
    "<S> particularly interesting are those models in which the ground state is superconducting , or has dominant superconducting correlations in one dimension @xcite , because they display superconducting mechanisms which are different from the conventional electron - phonon one and might be relevant to the understanding of the high-@xmath5 systems .    here </S>",
    "<S> we consider a one - dimensional ( 1d ) system described by the hamiltonian : @xmath6 where in terms of ordinary fermion operators @xmath7 ( double occupancy at any site is forbidden ) , @xmath8 is the spin operator at site @xmath9 , and @xmath10 denote the nearest neighbors of site @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> eq.(1 ) can also be written in the form of a hopping of singlet pairs : @xmath11    in 2d , @xmath12 was obtained as an important term in a systematic analytical derivation of a generalized @xmath1 model , starting from the extended three - band hubbard model @xcite . also , a numerical study of a cu@xmath13o@xmath14 cluster has shown that fitting of the energy levels using a generalized @xmath1 model improves considerably , and a correct ordering of the levels is obtained , if @xmath12 is included @xcite . if the direct o - o hopping @xmath15 of the three - band model is large enough , @xmath16 has opposite sign as the one which corresponds to a canonical transformation of the hubbard model @xcite and simultaneously the direct nearest - neighbor hopping @xmath17 has the sign which agrees with the observed fermi surface and other properties of hole - doped superconductors , and with the asymmetry in the magnetic properties between hole - doped and electron - doped cuprates @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> a recent exact diagonalization of a 4@xmath184 cluster shows that when @xmath19 corresponding to large @xmath15 , the system shows strong signals of @xmath2-wave superconductivity for realistic @xmath20 and doping @xmath21 = 0.25 @xcite . the @xmath2-wave superconducting susceptibility is strongly enhanced and the ground - state wave function has a significant overlap with a a simple short - range resonance - valence - bond state with superconducting off - diagonal long - range order ( odlro ) in the @xmath2-wave and @xmath22-wave channels ( the former being the dominant ) </S>",
    "<S> the fact that @xmath12 changes the physics dramatically is also evident in the symmetry of the ground state as a function of doping @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> another case of the three - band hubbard model in wich @xmath12 is important is the limit @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the cu - o charge transfer energy . in this case </S>",
    "<S> @xmath25 becomes of the order of @xmath26 , as can be seen from a canonical transformation that eliminates double occupancy in the effective one - band hubbard model @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately , although the saturation of the superconducting correlation functions in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite is an indication of odlro , a study of a small cluster can not assure the presence of odlro in the thermodynamic limit . instead , </S>",
    "<S> in 1d one can use powerful results obtained using conformal - field theory to relate the correlation exponents with thermodynamic quantities @xcite , and then , the effect of @xmath12 on superconducting correlations can be determined unambiguosly . as a first step , we drop the other terms of the generalized @xmath1 model . </S>",
    "<S> this allows us to obtain analytical results and to isolate the effect of @xmath27 .    to gain physical insight into the 1d problem , </S>",
    "<S> let us consider a chain with only one vacant site ( or hole ) . </S>",
    "<S> the action of the hamiltonian eq.(2 ) over a state in which the hole is localized at a given site , can be thought as a permutation of the hole with a nearest - neighbor singlet . </S>",
    "<S> thus , to take maximum advantage of @xmath12 , it is convenient that the spin configuration consists of a bond - ordering wave of non - overlaping singlets at each side of the hole ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the subsequent motion of the hole does not alter the spin configuration , the problem becomes equivalent to a tight - binding model with next - nearest - neighbor hopping @xmath28 , and the resulting ground - state energy in the thermodynamic limit @xmath29 coincides with the lower bound of @xmath12 which can be obtained using gerschgorin s theorem @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this fact confirms that the spin configuration is the optimum one . </S>",
    "<S> when more than one hole is present in the system , in order to have all spins paired in singlets of nearest - neighbor particles , it is necessary that the distance between two successive holes is odd ( the parity of this distance is conserved by @xmath27 ) . from the arguments given above , it seems clear that the ground state is a combination of sequences of these singlets and holes ( see fig.1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> although we could not prove analytically this statement for more than two holes , we have verified that the ground - state energy of an open chain with 14 sites and any even number of particles is the same as that of a spinless model ( eqs.(3 ) and ( 4 ) ) , obtained using the mapping sketched in fig.1 : each singlet is replaced by a spinless fermion . for a chain of length @xmath30 and @xmath31 particles ( @xmath31 even ) , the hopping , length and number of particles of the effective spinless fermion problem </S>",
    "<S> are given by : @xmath32 for example in fig.1 @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and then @xmath35 , @xmath36 . in a chain with open boundary conditions , the order of the singlets </S>",
    "<S> is conserved , and thus , the statistics of the fermions in the equivalent problem does not play any role . </S>",
    "<S> we recall that the ground - state energy of a spinless chain with open boundary conditions of length @xmath37 , @xmath38 fermions and hopping @xmath26 is ( see for example ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) : @xmath39    eqs.(3 ) and ( 4 ) describe the ground - state energy of @xmath12 for a chain with open boundary conditions . </S>",
    "<S> however , for the discussion below concerning the central charge and low - energy excitations , it is more convenient to know the energy of @xmath12 in a ring ( periodic boundary conditions ) . in this case </S>",
    "<S> , the mapping to the fermionic system can still be done : the fermionic sign which arises under a cyclic permutation of the fermions can be absorbed taking periodic ( antiperiodic ) boundary conditions if the number of fermions is odd ( even ) . </S>",
    "<S> this corresponds to an even number of particles not multiple of four ( multiple of four ) in the original system described by @xmath12 . in both cases </S>",
    "<S> the energy can be written as : @xmath40 using eq.(3 ) , the ground - state energy per site @xmath41 of a ring of length @xmath30 and density @xmath42 described by @xmath12 is : @xmath43    we have also verified eq.(6 ) for @xmath44 and all @xmath4 multiple of 1/7 . from eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) or eq . ( 6 ) one obtains in the thermodynamic limit : @xmath45 the corresponding wave function can be obtained through the mapping procedure in a similar way as in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    to obtain the long - distance behavior of any correlation function , using results of conformal - field theory </S>",
    "<S> , one needs information about the low - energy excitations of the system @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is easy to see that the low - energy triplet excitations on the ground state , act as barriers to the propagation of the holes . from arguments similar to those presented above for the one - hole case </S>",
    "<S> , one sees that the spin excitation of lowest energy is to change one singlet of nearest - neighbor particles into a triplet . for open boundary conditions in the equivalent fermionic problem , this is equivalent to changing a chain of length @xmath46 with @xmath47 particles into two equal chains of length @xmath30 whith @xmath48 particles . using eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) we obtain that the value of the spin gap in the thermodynamic limit is : @xmath49\\ ] ] the gap is maximum for @xmath50 and vanishes at @xmath51 .    </S>",
    "<S> the charge excitations , and in particular the charge velocity @xmath52 can also be calculated using the equivalent model of spinless fermions . </S>",
    "<S> it should be taken into account that distances and therefore also momentum are changed in the mapping procedure . while the minimum excitation energy @xmath53 of @xmath12 in a ring corresponds to @xmath54 , the corresponding momentum for the same energy in the equivalent spinless ring is @xmath55 . </S>",
    "<S> calling @xmath56 the charge velocity of the spinless ring , we can write @xcite : @xmath57 in the thermodynamic limit @xmath58 , and using eqs.(3 ) and ( 9 ) one obtains : @xmath59 expanding the denominator of eq.(6 ) up to third order in the argument and using eqs.(7 ) and ( 10 ) , one can see that for @xmath60 : @xmath61 where the number @xmath62 is called the central charge @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this scaling law characterizes a luther - emery liquid @xcite . in this liquid , </S>",
    "<S> the correlation functions are characterized by a single exponent @xmath63 . </S>",
    "<S> the superconducting pair - pair correlation functions depend on the distance @xmath64 between pairs as @xmath65 for @xmath66 and are the dominant correlation functions at large distances if @xmath67 @xcite . in this case a small coupling between different chains gives rise to superconductivity . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath63 can be calculated in terms of the charge velocity and the compressibility @xmath68 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> using eq.(7 ) on obtains : @xmath69 and using eq.(10 ) , a very simple expression for the correlation exponent results : @xmath70    this exact result allows to test numerical methods and approximations . as an example , we have calculated @xmath71 in a ring of 14 sites from the expression @xmath72 , obtaining @xmath73 and the drude weight @xmath74 numerically as in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . the comparison with eq.(13 ) </S>",
    "<S> is shown in fig.2 . </S>",
    "<S> one can see that the agreement is very good except for a small deviation at the extreme densities . </S>",
    "<S> this deviation is mainly due to the discretization of the expression of the second derivative which enters the compressibility .    </S>",
    "<S> the system has dominant superconducting correlations for @xmath75 . </S>",
    "<S> inspection of eq.(12 ) shows that there is no phase separation in the system for any density . </S>",
    "<S> this is in contrast to the @xmath1 and other models proposed to the cuprates in which superconductivity takes place near a region of phase separation @xcite . in the dilute limit @xmath76 , @xmath77 , as in the negative @xmath78 hubbard model for large @xmath79 : the physics is like that of hard - core bosons which undergo bose condensation . </S>",
    "<S> the same type of physics is expected in 2d in the dilute limit . </S>",
    "<S> we have confirmed this by numerical calculations in a 4@xmath804 cluster and comparison with a bcs - like wave function . instead , for @xmath81 , @xmath82 , as in the case of spinless fermions . </S>",
    "<S> addition of an attractive term like the superexchange @xmath83 of the @xmath84 model should extend the range of densities for which @xmath67 to larger values of @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> one also expects that addition of @xmath83 should close the spin gap for @xmath85 . </S>",
    "<S> the effect of the interplay of @xmath86 with the terms present in the @xmath1 model in 1d has been studied quite recently by numerical methods @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the main result is that the regions of superconductivity and phase separation for @xmath85 shift to higher ( lower ) values of @xmath87 if a small @xmath25 is added with the same ( opposite ) sign as the one which corresponds to a canonical transformation of the hubbard model . </S>",
    "<S> thus , as in 2d , the sign of @xmath16 favored for large @xmath15 in the mapping from the three - band hubbard model @xcite is more convenient for superconductivity for realistic doping .    </S>",
