    "the question of how coulomb interactions affect anderson localization has been a challenging problem for decades .",
    "it was first addressed by fleishman and anderson @xcite in the context of the stability of the insulating phase as well as the mechanism of system thermalization and energy exchange involved in hopping conductivity .",
    "thermalization of fermi - gas systems depends on inelastic scatterings of electrons .",
    "energy - exchange via electron - electron ( e - e ) scattering is required for establishing the fermi - dirac thermal - distribution , which defines the electron temperature .",
    "such events lead to de - coherence of the electrons and thus also control the quantum effects exhibited by the system .",
    "the most frequently encountered mechanisms for electronic energy - transfer in condensed matter systems are e - e and electron - phonon ( e - ph ) scatterings .",
    "the latter is needed to maintain steady - state conditions when the system is driven by an external source , and in particular , are responsible for the validity of ohm s law .    in metallic systems at sufficiently low temperatures",
    "the e - e inelastic - rate @xmath0 is usually the main source of scattering @xcite .",
    "both , @xmath0 , and the e - ph inelastic - rate @xmath1 can be measured in the diffusive regime based on weak - localization effects @xcite . while similar quantum effects sometime extend into the hopping regime of the same system @xcite , a theoretical framework to analyze such data and obtain inelastic scattering rates is unfortunately not yet established .",
    "@xmath0 in the hopping regime is defined in this work as the rate of energy - exchange @xmath2e involved in electron - electron scatterings where @xmath2e@xmath30 .",
    "these processes contribute to the _ overall _ life - time broadening of the electronic level , which is what our experiments are designed to capture .",
    "it should be remarked that the energy - state broadening includes the contribution of other mechanisms ( such as electron - phonon inelastic scattering ) . in the diffusive regime",
    "the contribution of e - e inelastic - rate may be separated from the e - ph one as demonstrated by bergmann @xcite .",
    "this is not yet achievable by the methodology used here for the insulating regime . on the other hand",
    ", this method yields information on a wide frequency range ( rather than just an average value for the inelastic - rate ) and it can still be shown that relative to the diffusive regime @xmath0 is dramatically suppressed .    it was recently shown that in the two - dimensional ( 2d ) hopping regime of crystalline indium - oxide in@xmath4o@xmath5 , @xmath0 is suppressed by @xmath6six orders of magnitude relative to its value at the diffusive regime at the same temperature @xcite .",
    "this was based on utilizing a unique property of electron - glasses @xcite ; using a non - ohmic field to take the system out of equilibrium , endows the system with excess conductance that may be used as an empirical measure of the energy absorbed by the electrons from the field .",
    "this technique allows a measurement on systems with very small volume , it is sensitive enough to allow for weak absorption from electric fields , and can be carried over a wide frequency range .",
    "here we report on measurements performed on anderson - localized amorphous indium - oxide films ( in@xmath7o ) that exhibit three - dimensional ( 3d ) hopping transport .",
    "the results of our measurements suggest that e - e energy exchange in in@xmath7o is strongly suppressed relative to its value in the diffusive regime at the same temperature .",
    "analysis of these results suggests that thermalization of the electronic system is governed by @xmath1 as was the case in the 2d crystalline version @xcite .",
    "however , approaching the metal - insulator transition by reducing the quenched disorder , the perceived inelastic - rate tends towards the @xmath0 value typical of the diffusive regime .",
    "this occurs while the system is still insulating ; it exhibits variable - range - hopping transport and its disorder is as strong as that of the 2d samples where @xmath0 was highly suppressed @xcite .",
    "we point out some similarity of these observations with a peculiar temperature dependence of the conductivity in 3d systems near their metal - insulator transition , which has been observed in several materials .",
    "the role of dimensionality , inherent inhomogeneities , many - body effects , and other issues that might be involved in bringing about an apparent de - localized behavior are discussed .",
    "three batches of in@xmath7o samples were used in this study .",
    "they were prepared by e - gun evaporation onto room - temperature substrates using 99.999% pure in@xmath4o@xmath5 sputtering target pieces .",
    "substrates were either 1 mm thick microscope glass - slides , or on 0.5@xmath8 m sio@xmath4 layer thermally grown on @xmath9100@xmath10 silicon wafers .",
    "samples thickness d was 630  or 1050  for the glass - slides , and d=750  for the si wafers .",
    "rate of deposition and thickness were measured by a quartz thickness monitor calibrated using optical interference measurements on thick mgf@xmath4 films .",
    "deposition was carried out at the ambience of ( 1 - 3)@xmath1110@xmath12 torr oxygen pressure maintained by leaking 99.9% pure o@xmath4 through a needle - valve into the vacuum chamber ( base pressure @xmath1310@xmath14 torr ) .",
    "rates of deposition used for the samples reported here were typically 0.6 - 0.9   / s . under these conditions , the in@xmath7o samples had carrier - concentration n in the range ( 7 - 8)@xmath1110@xmath15@xmath16 as measured by hall - effect at room temperatures on samples that were patterned in a 6-probe configuration using stainless - steel masks .",
    "these samples were prepared during the same deposition as the strips used for the low temperature transport measurements .",
    "a standard hall - bar geometry was used with the active channel being a strip of 1 mm wide , and 10 mm long .",
    "the two pairs of voltage probes ( that doubled as hall - probes ) , were spaced 3 mm from one another along the strip .",
    "this arrangement allowed us to assess the large scale uniformity of the samples , both in terms the longitudinal conductance and the hall effect .",
    "excellent uniformity was found on these scales ; resistivities of samples separated by 1  mm along the strip were identical to within @xmath175% .",
    "no change ( within the experimental error of 3% ) was observed in the hall effect due to annealing ( tested for samples with room temperature resistivity smaller than @xmath130.4@xmath18 cm which was the highest @xmath19 in the samples studied in this work ) . on",
    "a mesoscopic scales ( 10 - 100 nm ) however , in@xmath7o films show compositional inhomogeneities ; the various effects these may have on transport properties of these films were reported in @xcite .",
    "as - deposited samples had room - temperature resistivity @xmath19 in excess of 10@xmath20 cm which , for the low temperature studies , had to be reduced by several orders of magnitude .",
    "this was achieved by thermal annealing at temperatures t@xmath21@xmath975 degree celsius to prevent crystallization . for a comprehensive description of the annealing process and the associated changes in the material microstructure",
    "see @xcite .",
    "conductivity of the samples was measured using a two - terminal ac technique employing a 1211-ithaco current pre - amplifier and a par-124a lock - in amplifier .",
    "except when otherwise noted , measurements reported below were performed with the samples immersed in liquid helium at t=4.1k maintained by a 100 liters storage - dewar .",
    "this allowed long term measurements of samples as well as a convenient way to maintain a stable bath temperature .",
    "the ability to keep the sample at @xmath64k for long times is essential for these studies where a typical series of measurements takes 4 - 6 weeks to accomplish .",
    "the ac voltage - bias , used during the off - stress periods , was small enough to ensure linear response conditions ( judged by ohm s law being obeyed within the experimental error ) .",
    "as measure of disorder we use the ioffe - regel dimensionless parameter , k@xmath22=(9@xmath23n)@xmath24  where r@xmath25=@xmath26e@xmath27 is the resistance quantum .",
    "this is based on free - electron expressions using the measured room - temperature resistivity @xmath28 and the carrier - concentration n , obtained from the hall - effect measurements , as parameters .",
    "several sources were used for exciting the system by non - ohmic fields ; the internal oscillator of the par124a ( up to 2 khz and 10 vrms ) ( fluke pm5138a ( dc and up to 10 mhz and 40 vpp ) , and tabor ws8101 ( up to 100 mhz and boosted , when necessary , by ophir 5084 rf power - amplifier ) .",
    "complementary studies in the microwave regime employed the high - power synthesizer hp8360b .",
    "care was taken in these experiments to use `` rf - safe '' components near the sample immediate vicinity to minimize spurious heating .",
    "for the same reason , it was ascertained , by performing four - probe measurements , that the contacts resistance was always negligible relative to the sample resistance .",
    "optical excitation was accomplished by exposing the sample to algaas diode",
    "( operating at @xmath60.88@xmath170.05@xmath8 m ) , placed @xmath615 mm from the sample .",
    "the diode was energized by a computer - controlled keithley 220 current - source .",
    "the samples were attached to a probe equipped with calibrated ge and pt thermometers and were wired by triply - shielded cables to bnc connectors at room temperatures .",
    "the effective capacitance of the wires was @xmath2920pf .",
    "this allowed the use of 23 - 1500hz ac technique without a significant phase shift for any of the samples used here .",
    "fuller details of measurement techniques are given elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the main technique used in this study is the ` stress - protocol ' previously used in aging experiments @xcite .",
    "the procedure is composed of the following stages ( see fig.1 for details ) : after the sample is equilibrated at the measuring temperature ( typically for 24 hours ) , its conductance versus time  g(t ) is recorded while keeping the electric field f@xmath30 small enough to be as close to the ohmic regime as possible .",
    "this defines a baseline ` equilibrium g(0 ) ' .",
    "next , f is switched to a non - ohmic `` stress - field '' f@xmath31 , which is kept on the sample for a time t@xmath32 .",
    "initially , f@xmath31 causes the conductance to increase by @xmath33 g , but g is observed to keep increasing slowly throughout t@xmath32 . then the field is switched back to f@xmath30 and the conductance is continued to be measured for few thousand seconds .",
    "this last stage is depicted in figure 1 as a relaxation of g(t ) towards the equilibrium g(f@xmath30 ) with a logarithmic law characteristic of the relaxation processes in electron - glasses @xcite .",
    "a measure of the magnitude of the excess conductance that results from the stress is @xmath2g@xmath30 ( see inset to fig.1 ) , defined by extrapolating the @xmath2g(t ) curve to 1  second as illustrated in the inset to fig . 1 .",
    "@xmath2g(t ) is g(f@xmath30,t)-g(f@xmath30 ) .",
    "the origin of time for the logarithmic plot in the inset is taken as t@xmath32 + 1 ( i.e. , 1 second after f@xmath31 is reset to the ohmic field f@xmath30 ) .",
    "the relaxation of the excess conductance @xmath2g(t ) is a manifestation of the system approach to equilibrium from an excited state .",
    "a negative time - derivative of @xmath2g(t ) reflects energy release to the bath .",
    "this energy may have been imparted to the system by a number of different mechanisms ; for example , exposing the sample to infrared radiation ( fig.2 ) , or changing its carrier - concentration using a nearby gate ( fig.3 ) . in either case , the ensuing logarithmic relaxation of @xmath2g@xmath30 follows the same relaxation law as that produced by the stress - field .",
    "the mechanism by which stressing the system with a non - ohmic field increases the electronic energy is essentially joule - heating ; the energy absorbed by the electrons gives rise to an excess phonons , making it somewhat ` hotter ' than the bath .",
    "a steady - state may be established , while the stress - field is on , by the flow of energy carried by the phonons in the sample into the thermal - bath . the increased density of high energy phonons ( over the phonon population in equilibrium at the bath temperature ) , randomizes the charge configuration of the electron - glass in a similar vein that raising the bath - temperature would @xcite .",
    "this produces the excess conductance that relaxes back to its near equilibrium value once the stress is relieved .",
    "it is therefore plausible to take @xmath2g@xmath30 as a measure of the energy @xmath34 absorbed by the electronic system from the field .",
    "as long as @xmath2g@xmath30/g(0)@xmath351 , @xmath2g@xmath30 is arguably proportional to @xmath34 .",
    "it is emphasized that the only assumption we make in this procedure is that @xmath34 enters the sample via the coupling of f@xmath31 to the _ electronic system_. no other assumption is made . in particular , the reason for the very sluggish release of this energy is not relevant for our considerations in this work .",
    "the logarithmic nature of @xmath2g(t ) is taken as a convenient empirical fact that allows us to estimate the absorption via transport measurements .",
    "this rationale was used in @xcite in the study of the frequency dependence of the electronic absorption of two - dimensional ( 2d ) films of in@xmath4o@xmath5 . in this study",
    "we extend the study to three - dimensional ( 3d ) films .",
    "our first goal here is to define a protocol that allows a meaningful comparison between energy absorption from the stress - field applied to the system at various frequencies .",
    "the natural choice is to normalize @xmath36g@xmath37 - the excess conductance measured under f@xmath31 at a frequency f by @xmath2g@xmath38- the excess conductance measured with a dc field while keeping the same @xmath39g / g(0 ) and the same t@xmath32 for each tested frequency of the applied stress .",
    "it was found that for f@xmath930hz @xmath2g@xmath37 was indistinguishable ( within the experimental error ) from @xmath2g@xmath38 and in the experiments reported here we used the result for f@xmath31 operating at f=11 - 23hz as the normalizing value . for applying the stress - protocol at frequencies above @xmath61khz ,",
    "the conductance was measured at f=23hz and under low - bias conditions to ensure linear - regime measurement throughout the protocol . a stress - field f@xmath31 with frequency f",
    "was capacitively superimposed across the sample .",
    "the high frequency component of f@xmath31 was filtered out in the input to the current preamplifier ( in addition to the band - pass filtering in the 124a lock - in amplifier ) such that the conductance was measured at the low frequency .",
    "the amplitude of f@xmath31 was adjusted to achieve the desired @xmath39g / g(0 ) based on the conductance reading at f=23hz .",
    "the relaxation part of the protocol was always measured under near - ohmic conditions and at a low frequency ( or at dc ) .",
    "results of absorption at different frequencies for three of the 3d samples studied with the protocol described above are shown in fig.4 .",
    "for comparison , the figure includes the 2d samples studied previously @xcite .        *",
    "the general trend is for the absorption to decrease with frequency , and in all three cases shown in fig.4 there is a faster decline of the absorption with f above a certain roll - off frequency f@xmath40 .",
    "it is observed that f@xmath40 is considerably lower than the respective electron - electron inelastic rate @xmath0 of the material ( based on measurements performed on a 3d in@xmath7o system in its diffusive regime at the same temperature ) . *",
    "the frequency range over which the absorption decays appears to be rather wide , extending over several decades . for comparing results under different conditions ,",
    "we take f@xmath40 to be the frequency where @xmath2g@xmath37/@xmath2g@xmath38=1/2 .",
    "* for the range of disorder shown , there seems to be no dependence on the disorder in either 3d or 2d ; samples with different disorder show essentially identical absorption versus f curves .",
    "however , as will soon transpire , this is only true for samples in the strongly - localized regime .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that the roll - off frequency in the two - dimensional in@xmath4o@xmath5 samples ( lower graph in fig.4 ) is consistent with the electron - phonon inelastic scattering - rate @xmath1 of the material at 4k .",
    "this estimate was based on the assumption that , while under a dc stress - field , the system reaches steady - state conditions in which case the energy absorbed by the electrons from f@xmath31 equals the energy dissipated into the bath .",
    "this may be described by the following expression:@xmath41    the l.h.s of eq.1 is the joule - heating term ; v is the voltage across the sample , and r(v ) is its resistance under v. the r.h.s is the heat - removal rate while f@xmath31 is on , and assuming steady - state conditions . in this equation c@xmath42",
    "is the electronic heat - capacity , u the sample volume , t * is an `` effective electron - temperature '' , @xmath39 t is t*-t@xmath43 ( the bath temperature ) . for our samples being macroscopic , @xmath44(t * ) should coincide with the inelastic electron - phonon rate @xmath1 .",
    "the parameters needed for calculating , @xmath44(t * ) are all obtained from measurements on the respective sample except for c@xmath42 and t*. following the procedure used in @xcite , t * may be estimated from g(t ) data ( the uncertainty associated with this procedure will be commented on below ) .    the electronic heat capacity c@xmath42 is@xmath45proportional to the temperature and to @xmath46n@xmath47 , the thermodynamic density - of - states of the material . since the carrier - concentration of the in@xmath7o samples used in this work is comparable to that of in@xmath4o@xmath5 ( and therefore c@xmath42 for them should be similar ) , we can estimate of the ratio between @xmath1 of in@xmath7o to that of the in@xmath4o@xmath5 samples by : @xmath48 where the subscripts ` a ' and ` c ' signify values for the amorphous and crystalline material respectively .",
    "the voltages used in the respective experiments are extracted from the conductance - voltage g(v ) measurements of the respective samples . for the samples we chose for the analysis below",
    ", these data are shown in fig.5 :      the conditions that were used in the stress - protocol for our experiments were @xmath39g(0)/g(0)@xmath60.6 , and the associated f@xmath31 was applied for t@xmath32=1400   seconds . to achieve this @xmath39g(0)/g(0 ) a voltage of 10.2v = v@xmath21",
    "was needed for the in@xmath7o sample as compared to 0.5v = v@xmath49 for the crystalline sample @xcite , as can be read from fig.5 .",
    "note that these values ( with the respective resistances ) , mean that the power invested from the ( dc ) field is @xmath61500-times larger for the in@xmath7o sample .",
    "the volumes for these samples were : 10@xmath50m@xmath51=u@xmath49 and 1.2@xmath1110@xmath52m@xmath51=u@xmath21 .",
    "the effective temperature  t@xmath53 for the in@xmath4o@xmath5 sample estimated in @xcite was 4.8k@xmath6t@xmath54 .",
    "this was based on the measured g(t ) data for the sample under steady - state conditions . using the same logic here , the respective t@xmath53for the in@xmath7o sample , based on its g(t ) data , is 5.3k@xmath6t@xmath55 .",
    "the conductance versus temperature curves for this sample and two other samples of the same in@xmath7o batch with different degrees of disorder are shown in fig.6 below .",
    "it should be remarked that using the sample resistance as a thermometer to obtain t * is a dubious procedure ; in general , the resistance change due to the applied non - ohmic field is not _",
    "just _ a heating effect .",
    "in fact , deep in the hopping regime _",
    "most _ of the resistance decrease is actually due to field - assisted hopping @xcite .",
    "hopping conductivity may be significantly enhanced by field while a negligible increase of the electrons `` temperature '' is observed ; application of microwaves for example , may cause a @xmath39g@xmath100 with essentially no - heating @xcite , and the data in fig.4 demonstrate that this adiabatic effect gradually manifests itself even at lower frequencies . in using eq.2 for comparing between @xmath56 and @xmath57 it",
    "is tacitly assumed that the part ( reflected in @xmath33 g ) due to joule - heating is the same for both materials .",
    "the error in the determination of t@xmath53 by assuming that g is a faithful thermometer , is partially reduced in the ratio @xmath39t@xmath49/@xmath39t@xmath21 .    with these reservations ,",
    "we use the above parameters into eq.2 which gives : @xmath56/@xmath57=65 .",
    "this value is not far from the factor of @xmath675 difference between the roll - off frequencies of the two materials ( see fig.4 ) , which in view of the uncertainties inherent in the procedure should be judged as a satisfactory agreement .",
    "the larger @xmath1 of the amorphous material relative to in@xmath4o@xmath5 found in this work is plausible ; @xmath5810@xmath59at t@xmath64k is typical of many degenerate fermi systems @xcite . as a rule , phonons in amorphous materials are softer than the crystalline version of the same substance .",
    "soft phonon - modes of the amorphous phase usually lead to enhanced electron - phonon coupling .",
    "this is probably part of the reason why in@xmath7o , with less disorder and high carrier - concentration , is a superconductor below few degrees kelvin while in@xmath4o@xmath5 remains a normal conductor down to @xmath612mk even when in the metallic regime @xcite .    as to the second issue listed above ; the extended range over which the absorption decreases with frequency , especially conspicuous for the in@xmath7o samples .",
    "this wide range of @xmath1 , is presumably a consequence of a wide distribution of localization - lengths @xmath60,@xmath45an inherent property of the disordered system .",
    "it is noteworthy that the absorption starts to diminish quickly at a rather small frequency ( fig.4 ) suggesting a reduced @xmath61 .",
    "this is not surprising ; note that each inelastic scattering of electron by a phonon involves the overlap of an initial state @xmath62__i__@xmath63 with a final state @xmath62__j__@xmath63 and a phonon with the energy that matches the energy difference between these sites .",
    "unless compensated somehow by a disorder - enhanced phonon - electron matrix element @xcite , this inevitably should lead to reduced transition rates relative to the diffusive regime where both states are extended .",
    "unfortunately , there is yet no theory for @xmath1 in the hopping regime to compare our results with .",
    "the frequency dependence of the absorption results discussed above suggests that @xmath0 ( and , in some sense , also @xmath1 ) is suppressed relative to its typical values in the diffusive regime . in the case of @xmath0",
    "this reduction is by several orders of magnitude ( see fig.4 ) .",
    "these rate being the main sources of decoherence in most disordered electronic systems the question arises : does it also mean that there is less decoherence in the anderson insulator phase ?",
    "if one ignores the possibility that the highly disordered phase may breed decoherence agents that were not present in the diffusive regime , like new types of two - level - systems or local magnetic moments @xcite , then the answer is yes ; the insulating phase may have reduced inelastic rate relative to the diffusive phase .",
    "this however applies to the coherence _",
    "time _ ; the _ spatial _ extent of the electron coherence will be limited by the highly reduced diffusion constant . there is experimental evidence for quantum coherent effects in the anderson localized regime that , in some respects , are more prominent than in the diffusive regime but the phase - coherent length is limited to the hopping - length @xcite .",
    "the most compelling evidence for quantum - coherent effects is the anisotropy of conductance - fluctuations produced by magnetic field at different orientations is mesoscopic samples as well as in the magnetoresistance of two - dimensional samples @xcite .",
    "the existence of quantum - coherent effects deep in the hopping regime ought not be surprising .",
    "the overlap between the initial and final state is affected by the interference between different spatial trajectories .",
    "the phonon involved in the actual transition does not destroy the interference once the phonon wavelength exceeds the hopping - length , which inevitably happens at sufficiently low temperatures @xcite .    the suppression of @xmath0 may appear as a natural consequence of the spectrum discreteness associated with localization @xcite . on closer examination , and taking into account the role of coulomb interaction , this issue is more complicated and yet unresolved .",
    "the problem was first raised by fleishman and anderson @xcite .",
    "they considered several scenarios by which interactions may modify the single - particle aspects of anderson - localized systems , while noting that g(t ) of these systems still conforms to variable - range - hopping law .",
    "it may be illuminating then to see what we can infer from the vrh conductivity of the samples on the spectrum discreteness .      to get an estimate of @xmath2(@xmath60 ) one may use data for the temperature dependence of the hopping conductivity .",
    "this version of in@xmath7o obeys mott s law ( c.f . ,",
    "fig.5 ) @xmath65=@xmath66   $ ] where t@xmath30 is given by @xcite : @xmath67    using the data for @xmath68(t ) ( fig.6 ) and eq.4 , the mean - level - spacing for the two samples studied in fig.4 is @xmath2(@xmath60)@xmath610@xmath69k@xmath704k , and it is also much larger than e@xmath71e@xmath27/(@xmath72 ) where @xmath7310 is the dielectric constant for indium - oxide @xcite , and @xmath7410  as will be shown below . therefore ,",
    "unless many - body physics plays a role , it would appear that the spectrum discreteness is large enough to suppress electron - electron inelastic scattering .",
    "thermalization of the electronic system and non - zero conductivity then depend on the existence of a continuous bath , presumably phonons . fleishman and",
    "anderson @xcite reached this conclusion for the localized system in the limit of short range interaction .",
    "our absorption versus frequency results ( fig.4 ) are consistent with their conclusions for a realistic interaction range , probably of the order of the hopping - length r(t)@xmath75(t@xmath30/t)@xmath76 or @xmath75(t@xmath30/t)@xmath77 in 2d or 3d respectively      the frequency dependence of the absorption measured on two samples that were annealed to bring their k@xmath22 to 0.19 and 0.21 , is shown in fig.7 .",
    "these data exhibit a different trend than the more disordered samples shown in fig.4 above ; the absorption still decreases with frequency but it seems to extend to higher frequencies , possibly even surpassing the @xmath0 of the diffusive regime at this temperature . at the same time , these samples are on the insulating side of the mit , and their mean - level - spacing is still much larger than both e@xmath78 and the bath temperature ; their characteristic energies t@xmath30 ( defined by the vrh conductivity expression ) are @xmath64300k ( fig.6 ) and @xmath66600k ( fig.9 below ) for the sample with k@xmath22=0.21 and 0.19 respectively .",
    "more intriguing is the observation that the disorder of the samples in fig.4 is considerably larger than that of the 2d samples \\{fig.3 in @xcite and fig.4 } ; the disorder in the latter is comparable to that of these 3d samples in terms of @xmath2(@xmath60 ) ( and in terms of bulk resistivity the disorder in the 2d films it is even _ much _ _ weaker _ than in the 3d samples ) .",
    "if the reason for the energy - absorption cut - off in the 2d samples is the spectrum - discreteness of the electronic states ( having @xmath2(@xmath60)@xmath79k@xmath80 t ) then why the same is not sufficient for 3d samples that exhibit equally large @xmath2(@xmath60 ) ?      a possible direction to look for the difference between the 2d and 3d results may be related to the materials ; as noted above amorphous and crystalline version of indium - oxide have their differences but none that seems relevant for this particular feature . on the other hand",
    ", there is reason to suspect that _ dimensionality _ plays a role : just insulating 3d samples of in@xmath4o@xmath5 exhibit transport peculiarities that are not observed in 2d @xcite .",
    "the 3d samples exhibited insulating characteristics only when cooled below a disorder - dependent t*. above this temperature , they show a metallic - like g(t ) law . on the other hand , 2d samples of this material , with the same range of bulk resistivity exhibited insulating behavior ( @xmath810 when t@xmath820 ) over the same temperature range @xcite .",
    "three dimensional samples of in@xmath7o also exhibited the same `` t*-problem '' @xcite .",
    "to illustrate , an example of the `` t*-problem '' is shown in fig.8 using one of the currently studied specimen .",
    "note that , at low temperatures , g(t ) exhibits vrh conductivity ( inset to fig.8 ) .",
    "this implies g(t@xmath820)=0 , which means the system is _",
    "insulating_. however above t*@xmath660k the conductance law changes , and if one has no knowledge of the behavior of g(t ) at lower temperatures one will conclude , extrapolating along the dashed curve in the main figure that g(t@xmath820)@xmath100 , that the system is actually a _ metal_.    a similar g(t ) anomaly appears in quite a few other 3d systems ( note that this feature is easier to identify when g(t ) rather than r(t ) is plotted ) .",
    "such a peculiar g(t ) may be seen in a series of amorphous mn@xmath7si@xmath83 samples @xcite , in amorphous si@xmath83cr@xmath7 @xcite , in geal @xcite , in granular aluminum @xcite , in crystalline gesb@xmath4te@xmath84 @xcite , and in a - gd@xmath7si@xmath83 samples @xcite .",
    "we are not aware of any 3d system that was tested over a wide temperature range near its mit without showing the ambiguous g(t ) characterizing the t*-problem",
    ". this feature may be generic to 3d systems near their anderson transition .",
    "the phenomenology associated with this anomalous g(t ) , in particular the systematic increase of t * with disorder , and the absence of the effect in 2d @xcite , raised the possibility that t * signifies the mobility - edge ; a threshold energy e@xmath78 separating extended states for e@xmath10e@xmath78 from localized states for e@xmath9e@xmath78 .",
    "this indeed might account for the experimental observations .",
    "however , the values for t * necessary for this line of explanation turned out to be smaller than what one ( perhaps naively ) anticipates . note that near the metal - insulator transition the distance @xmath39e to the mobility - edge is expected to obey @xcite : @xmath85 where , e@xmath86 is the fermi - energy , g is the dimensionless conductance , g@xmath87 is the dimensional - conductance value at the mit transition , and the exponent @xmath88 is @xmath61 . to fit the g(t ) data to eq.5 it was necessary to use for e * , a value considerably smaller than the fermi energy of the material , which shed some doubts on the notion that t * reflects the mobility - edge @xcite .    the current results , and in particular the apparent role of dimensionality , instigated a renewed look at these phenomena",
    "the absorption experiments ( fig.7 ) and the g(t ) behavior of just insulating 3d samples have this in common : both exhibit diffusive characteristics , a tendency that becomes more conspicuous as they further approach the mit , and both involve probing the system away from its ground - state : the stress experiments take the system far from equilibrium , the t * problem is a finite temperature phenomenon .",
    "indeed , a simple explanation of the g(t ) anomaly might be related to a temperature - dependent probing length .",
    "an insulating sample will exhibit a diffusive g(t ) law when , for example , l@xmath89@xmath9@xmath60 where l@xmath89=l@xmath89(t ) is the inelastic diffusion length .",
    "this however can not account for the experimental t*-problem unless one assumes either , an unusual energy dependence for @xmath60 or a specific @xmath60 - distribution @xcite .",
    "a many - body scenario may have to be considered .",
    "let us examine the t*-problem in the context of the current issue assuming for the moment it is in fact a mobility - edge . if e@xmath78 is not far above e@xmath86 , then new avenues for electron - electron energy exchange may become available .",
    "it is thus of interest to find out how close is a system with a given k@xmath22 to the transition .",
    "this may be estimated from the dependence of the localization - length @xmath60 on the order - parameter k@xmath22 of the sample in question .",
    "the localization length is evaluated using the g(t ) data with eq.4 , this yields the @xmath60(k@xmath22 ) plot shown in fig.9 :      the dependence of @xmath60 on k@xmath22 in this figure fits reasonably well the expression : @xmath60=@xmath90   ^{\\text{-1}}$ ] which is a variation on on the scaling form @xcite ( with @xmath88=1 ) : @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the value of the localization - length far from the mit .",
    "fitting the dependence of @xmath60 on k@xmath22 ( fig.9 ) yields @xmath92=11 ,  which is of the order of the bohr - radius , a@xmath9315  for indium - oxide , so this is a plausible result . from eq.6a and",
    "eq.5 one gets : @xmath94 that can now be used for an estimate of e*. using eq.6b with @xmath39e@xmath9560k for the sample with k@xmath22=0.19 ; @xmath60=23  ( see fig.9 ) gives e*@xmath6120k .",
    "note that , similar to the low values for e*/e@xmath86 obtained in @xcite for other systems , the current e * is  smaller by more than an order of magnitude than the fermi - energy of the material ( e@xmath86 for in@xmath7o with a carrier - concentration n=8.1@xmath9610@xmath15@xmath97 is @xmath131600k ) .",
    "this value for e * yields @xmath39e@xmath1350k for the sample with k@xmath22=0.21 ; @xmath60=27  which exhibits diffusive - like absorption characteristics awhen measured at @xmath64k . this does not contradict the observation of an insulating g(t ) behavior at this temperature range ; thermal excitation to states lying @xmath650k above the mobility - edge will only contribute significantly to the conductance exceeding @xmath612k .",
    "note however that the distance to the mobility - edge associated with @xmath33e@xmath1350k is not yet small enough to allow appreciable electron - electron energy - exchange via virtual transitions to extended states ; the time allowed for diffusion in these states @xmath98/@xmath39e is @xmath610@xmath99 which is an order of magnitude shorter than @xmath0 of the diffusive system at these temperatures @xcite .",
    "it is therefore hard to see how to account for the results in fig.7 with a single - particle scenario and with just the implicit assumptions of system homogeneity made above .",
    "for example one may consider the possibility that a significant part of the current - carrying - path is composed of regions that are diffusive ( and their combined resistance is comparable to that of the bottleneck resistors ) .",
    "the occurrence of ` metallic - puddles ' within the globally insulating system is a likely scenario when the system approaches the metal - insulator transition from the insulating side @xcite .",
    "this could be a consequence of the distributed nature of the localization - length , a complication that is sometime ignored on the ( misguided ) logic that a specific value for @xmath60 is singled - out by percolation constraints @xcite .",
    "one should not be surprised to find deviations from the predictions of these models even for some aspects of the dc conductivity @xcite and anyway , for measurements that involve the bulk of the sample , a realistic distribution of localization - lengths should be taken into account . at finite frequencies diffusive regions",
    "need not percolate in the system ; it is only necessary that the applied f@xmath31 induces dissipative currents in them thus generating phonons in excess of those present in equilibrium .",
    "this then will be effective in system - randomization with the ensuing ( once ohmic conditions are restored ) , slowly relaxing excess - conductance which contributes to the perceived absorption .",
    "a pertinent consideration here is a conceivable modification of the wavefunctions due to correlation and many - body effects .",
    "the coulomb interaction on a scale of @xmath60 derived from the g(t ) data is comparable with @xmath39e of the samples in fig.7 therefore hybridization with states above e@xmath78 can not be ruled out @xcite .",
    "it is difficult to estimate the relevance of these processes nearer the transition where the contribution of electronic polarization to the dielectric - constant becomes dominant @xcite , so a self - consistent treatment must be invoked .",
    "another complication is that the states above e@xmath78 are actually localized in the ground - state ; they just _ appear _ to be extended under finite temperature or non - ohmic fields ( at high frequencies the latter will be effective even when the associated conductance - change is smaller than that required by t due to the relative freedom from percolation constraints ) .",
    "note that the many - body density - of - states grows extremely fast with energy ( unlike in a single - particle scenario where this change is algebraic ) , and delocalization or an increase of the localization - length @xcite may occur due to the excess energy supplied by the stress - field .",
    "the combination of potential fluctuations , higher - order excitations , and extended states lying close to the fermi energy may enhance the occurrence of metallic `` puddles '' .",
    "obviously , dimensionality plays a role in any of these scenarios .",
    "if however the observed e@xmath78 is a many - body mobility - edge it should also occur in 2d systems albeit probably at a considerably higher energy .",
    "more experiments are needed to elucidate the relative importance of these mechanisms .",
    "the appearance of the t*-problem in so many systems may be suggestive of an underlying physical effect relevant for the mit problem .",
    "it clearly deserves to be addressed whether it signifies a real mobility - edge or it is just a consequence of a finite temperature measurement .",
    "the effectively low  value of e * ( relative to e@xmath86 ) means that , over a wide range of the physical parameter that is used to characterize the disorder , the system may be still within the ` critical ' regime of the metal - insulator transition .",
    "we have presented results of energy absorption from applied electromagnetic - fields in three - dimensional in@xmath7o samples . for anderson - insulating samples that are far from the metal - insulator transition",
    ", the absorption appears to be limited to frequencies that are of the order of the electron - phonon scattering rates of the material .",
    "this suggests that the hopping process in the range of temperature and disorder studied is mediated by phonons .",
    "likewise , thermalization of the electronic system then hinges on the presence of  a phonon bath .",
    "this is in agreement with the conclusions reached by fleishman and anderson @xcite .",
    "these authors also anticipated a change of behavior as the mobility - edge is approached from below and expected that this would be reflected in g(t ) that ought to include contribution from activation to extended states .",
    "the experimentally observed change in g(t ) as the mobility - edge is approached appears to be more complicated , and it would appear that more elaborate models of conductivity need to be developed for the critical transport regime . these may also shed light on the observation that absorption from ac fields is more sensitive than temperature to the proximity of a mobility - edge ( whether real or apparent ) .",
    "the effective range of the interaction , clearly important to these issues , was not explicitly dealt with in our experiments . at finite temperatures the range of the coulomb interaction is limited by the finite conductivity for which the relevant scale is presumably the hopping - length r(t ) . at liquid helium temperatures and for the range of the disorder in the samples used in this study , r(t ) is of order of few hundred angstroms .",
    "this is an order of magnitude larger than the inter - carrier separation n@xmath100 suggesting that , for the more disordered samples , our experimental results are relevant for systems with long - range interaction .    as the disorder in our samples",
    "was reduced and the diffusive phase approached , the absorption extended to progressively higher frequencies .",
    "this was observed on 3d samples but not in 2d samples with comparable degree of disorder .",
    "the similarity of this observation with the t*-problem that appears to be a common feature in many 3d systems near their mit was pointed out .",
    "it is hoped that this problem will receive due theoretical attention .",
    "possible relevance of a nearby mobility - edge for bringing about this behavior as well as the diffusive - like absorption characteristics of just insulating 3d samples was discussed .",
    "various effects that might contribute to these phenomena were mentioned including possible many - body effects .",
    "it would be interesting to extend the absorption study to include the dependence of the absorption on the amplitude of the stress - field near the transition as it may shed some light on the relative importance of many - body effects .",
