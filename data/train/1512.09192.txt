    "blue compact dwarf ( bcd ) galaxies are compact and low - luminosity ( @xmath7 mag ) objects , which are undergoing active star formation at the present time @xcite .",
    "they are believed to be part of the building blocks of massive galaxies in the early universe .",
    "the gas consumption time - scale of bcds , given the current star formation rate , is much shorter than the age of the universe @xcite .",
    "bcds and dwarf irregulars ( dirrs ) are chemically unevolved and metal - poor ( @xmath8 ) galaxies , early - type dwarfs ( des ) have a considerable spread in metallicity @xcite . some extremely metal - poor bcds were initially considered to be young galaxies with their first generation of stars forming .",
    "however , subsequent detection of the underlying extended old stellar population in most bcds indicates that they are actually old systems @xcite .",
    "the underlying old populations of bcds are often regarded as the ` underlying host ' of the central star - forming region .",
    "the evolutionary relationship between bcds and other dwarf galaxies is not clear and still under debate .",
    "a possible evolution scenario , proposed by @xcite and @xcite , is that dirrs evolve into bcds in several starbursts , enrich the interstellar , exhaust their gas and then fade to gas - free des .",
    "later on , @xcite discussed the possible evolutionary connections between bcds and other dwarf galaxies and suggested that the stellar wind from the central starburst is necessary to explain the compactness and central brightness of bcds .",
    "recently , @xcite compared the structural properties of the underlying hosts of bcds in the optical and near - infrared ( nir ) bands with those of dirrs .",
    "they fit the outer regions of bcds exponentially and found that the underlying hosts of bcds are brighter in the centre and have smaller radii than dirrs .",
    "they concluded that , if bcds can evolve into dirrs , some physical mechanism should be responsible for the significant change of structural properties from bcds to dirrs .",
    "a different result was found by @xcite with deep imaging of luminous dwarf galaxies and intermediate - mass bcgs .",
    "they measured the structural parameters of the underlying hosts of bcgs with surface brightness in the @xmath6 band @xmath9 in the range 2628  @xmath10 and found that the hosts of bcgs have similar structural parameters with other dwarf galaxies like des and dirrs .",
    "they suggested that the obtained structural properties for surface brightness @xmath9 in 2426  @xmath10 range are possibly affected by nebular emission from central star - forming regions .",
    "it should be noted that the depth of the @xmath6 band image in @xcite only reaches @xmath3 26  mag @xmath4 .",
    "meanwhile , a fit only to the outer region of a galaxy may be sensitive to the selection of the inner boundary of the fit .",
    "@xcite determined the structural properties of the underlying host of bcds and des in the virgo cluster and also found the bcd hosts to be smaller than the dirrs .",
    "however , they argued in addition that the bcd hosts and dirrs together are largely overlapping with the structural parameters of des .",
    "moreover , the overlapping will be more significant if the different distance of each bcd from the virgo cluster centre are taken into consideration .    since nir light traces the old stellar population , many authors have used deep nir imaging to study the structural properties of the underlying hosts of dwarf galaxies @xcite .",
    "however , the deepest nir images ( usually @xmath2 band ) only reach @xmath3 23  mag @xmath4 for bcds @xcite and @xmath3 24  mag @xmath4 for other dwarf galaxies @xcite . to probe the underlying host of bcds at larger radii and better constrain their structural properties ,",
    "deeper nir images are needed . the cosmic assembly near - ir deep extragalactic legacy survey ( candels , @xcite ) obtained extremely deep images of galaxies with the wide field camera 3 ( wfc3/ir ) and the advanced camera for surveys on the _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) _ , which have a full width at half - maximum ( fwhm ) of @xmath3 0.13 arcsec at nir .",
    "the survey targets five sky regions . among them , the great observatories origins deep survey north and south fields ( goods - n and goods - s ) are two sky regions with deeper nir imaging than the other three .",
    "this deep nir photometry survey allows detailed analysis of the structural properties of dwarf galaxies outside our nearby universe . in this work",
    ", we select a bcd sample from the candels goods - n and goods - s fields and study the structural properties of the underlying hosts of these bcds .    throughout this paper",
    ", we adopt the cosmological parameters @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "all magnitudes in this paper are given in the ab photometric system unless otherwise stated .",
    "there are many definitions of bcds according to their distinctive spectral features or morphological properties .",
    "the widely used definition in @xcite defines galaxies with the following properties as bcds : the galaxy is 1 ) blue with @xmath14 ; 2 ) compact with peak surface brightness in the @xmath6 band @xmath15  mag  @xmath16 ; 3 ) a dwarf with @xmath17  mag . in this work ,",
    "we select bcds in the goods - n and goods - s fields from the wfc3-selected photometry catalogue of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we use the definition in @xcite but parametrize ` dwarf ' via the stellar mass determined by fitting the spectral energy distributions from optical to nir @xcite . to obtain a bcd sample with robust stellar mass and physical size estimation ,",
    "spectroscopic redshift is needed .",
    "considering the redshift dimming effect , the low surfaces of galaxies are not detectable at high redshift .",
    "therefore , only galaxies with @xmath18 are selected .",
    "our final selection criteria for bcd are : 1 ) peak surface brightness at _ hst _",
    "@xmath0 @xmath15  mag  @xmath16 ; 2 ) restframe colour of @xmath14 ; 3 ) stellar mass @xmath19 ; 4 ) redshift @xmath18 .",
    "finally , 20 galaxies in the goods - n field and 14 in the goods - s field are selected as bcd via spectroscopic redshift measurement .",
    "stellar mass and spectroscopic redshift are taken from the catalogue of @xcite , who estimate stellar mass by using fast code @xcite and compile spectroscopic redshift from literature .",

    "the basic properties of the bcd sample are listed in table 1 .",
    "we also calculate the rotational asymmetry of bcds by using the publicly available code , morpheus @xcite .",
    "the asymmetry is measured by rotating the galaxy image by @xmath21 and subtracting it from the original image @xcite . for simplicity",

    "although an evolutionary connection between late - type and early - type dwarf galaxies was suggested over 30 yr ago ( e.g. @xcite ) , the details remain vague .",
    "some late - type dwarf galaxies located in dense regions may be environmentally transformed into des @xcite .",
    "@xcite and @xcite showed that spheroidal galaxies are not dwarf elliptical but bulgeless s0 galaxies , with structural parameters consistent with the irregular galaxies .",
    "however , the difference in chemical abundances @xcite suggests that simple gas stripping is not enough to transform a dirr into a de . in this work",
    ", we investigate the possible evolutionary connection between late- and early - type dwarf galaxies by comparing their structural properties .    in the left - hand panel of fig .",
    "5 , it can be seen that the central surface brightness of the underlying hosts of our bcds are fainter than for other bcd samples but consistent with the des and dirrs .",
    "this difference between different bcd samples may be due to the different fitting methods , since we fit the two - component model to the whole galaxy rather than only an exponential function to the outer region . in the right - hand panel of fig .",
    "5 , the underlying hosts of bcds seem to have distinctive structural properties compared to des and dirrs . since sbps in the @xmath0 band only reach @xmath3 26 @xmath10 , the structural properties may be affected by nebular emission from the star formation region as discussed in @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , this distinctive distribution may also be due to the luminosities used for the underlying host of bcds and other dwarf galaxies .",
    "most comparisons in the literature , including fig . 5 in this work ,",
    "use the luminosity of a galaxy rather than the underlying host component .",
    "this is not representative for bcds , since their luminosity in the @xmath6 band includes a significant contribution of the central starburst region .",
    "if we replace the @xmath22-axis for our bcds in fig .",
    "5 with the absolute magnitude of the outer component , more than half of the bcds move to the region occupied by dirrs . therefore , we consider the difference of effective radius in the optical @xmath6 band to be unphysical .",
    "it is interesting to note that the structural parameters of the outer components of bcds are in remarkable agreement with those of des when utilizing the deepest nir imaging so far of bcds .",
    "this consistency suggests that the underlying hosts of bcds can not be distinguished from those of des and no significant change of structure is needed given the evolutionary connection between bcds and des .",
    "in addition , we also find an approximately common luminosity - size relationship of different types of dwarf galaxies which suggests a unified structural evolution for dwarf galaxies .",
    "in contrast to the outer disc , the inner components of bcds are significantly different from those of des .",
    "however , it should be noted that the luminosity of the inner components of bcds and des is fainter than the outer component by @xmath3 1.5 mag . with fewer data points ,",
    "the structural parameters of the inner component may be more sensitive to the fitting procedure ( such as initial value and parameter range ) and less robust than those of the outer component .",
    "nevertheless , if bcds evolve to des rather than a simple cessation of star formation , passive fading could play a role . these likely inflict perturbations upon the stellar body , which tend to increase the concentration , and which could therefore lead to the higher central surface brightness , compacter size and higher srsic index of the inner component .",
    "actually , the structure of a galaxy varies at different wavelengths @xcite .",
    "for example , the effective radius decreases towards longer wavelengths .",
    "therefore , the structural parameters of our bcds derived at the observed @xmath0 or @xmath1 band could be different from those for the rest - frame @xmath6 or @xmath2 band .",
    "@xcite investigated the wavelength - dependence of galaxy structure using a sample of bright low redshift galaxies .",
    "although the dependence of dwarf galaxies may be different , we could roughly estimate the redshift effect in our comparison .",
    "for example , in the case of bcds at @xmath23 @xmath3 0.25 , the @xmath0 and @xmath1 bands have restframe effective wavelengths of 3480 and 12800  , respectively .",
    "although the effective radius is dependent on wavelength , the variance of wavelength is quite small with such narrow redshift range . in fig .",
    "13 of @xcite , we find that the variances of effective radius are both generally small ( @xmath24 5 percent by eye ) in the wavelength range of 3480  4350 and 12800  16000 @xmath25 for galaxies with blue colour and @xmath26 .",
    "the difference of srsic index @xmath27 could be slightly larger ( see fig . 6 in @xcite ) . in a word ,",
    "we consider our result about the consistency between the structures of different types of dwarf galaxies to be robust .",
    "the main goal of this work is to study the structural properties of the underlying host of bcds and compare them with other dwarf galaxies such as dirrs and des . unlike many previous works , which study dwarf galaxies in the nearby universe",
    ", we selected 34 bcds in the candel goods - n and goods - s deep fields with a median redshift of 0.2 . with deep nir imaging from the candels survey",
    ", we obtained the deepest nir azimuthally averaged sbp of bcds so far , reaching @xmath3 26 mag @xmath4 at the 3@xmath5 level .",
    "then we fit the sbps with one- and two - component srsic models .",
    "there are 16 of 33 bcds in the @xmath0 band and 19 of 34 bcds in the @xmath1 band which favour the two - component model .",
    "comparison between the structural properties of different types of dwarf galaxies offers an inspection of the possible evolutionary connections between them .",
    "we derived the structural properties of the underlying hosts of bcds in the @xmath0 band and compared them to those of des and dirrs .",
    "the effective radii of the underlying hosts of bcds in the @xmath6 band are smaller than those of des and dirrs .",
    "this discrepancy is similar to findings in many previous works .",
    "however , when we compare the structural properties in the @xmath2 band , the difference between bcds and other dwarf galaxies seems to be less significant .",
    "furthermore , we find a remarkable agreement between the underlying hosts of bcds and des in the @xmath2 band .",
    "all dwarf galaxies , including dirrs , seem to follow a similar luminosity - radius relationship , which suggests a unified structural evolution for dwarf galaxies .",
    "in contrast to the underlying hosts , the inner components of bcds are significantly different from those of des .",
    "passive fading from bcds to des may be one of the possible mechanisms that can explain the different inner structure of bcds and des .",
    "there are two possible reasons for the disappearance of difference in structural parameters between bcds and other dwarf galaxies in the @xmath2 band .",
    "@xcite suggested that the sbps of bcds for @xmath28 in the 2426 mag @xmath4 range in the @xmath6 band are affected by nebular emission and therefore may not trace the underlying stellar population distribution . besides , comparison of the structures of dwarf galaxies using total luminosity is not representative for bcds since the total luminosities of bcds in the @xmath6 band include a significant contribution from the central star - forming region .    with deep nir photometry and detailed sbp fitting ,",
    "we conclude that the underlying hosts of bcds can not be distinguished from those of des , and no significant change of structure is needed given the evolutionary connection between bcds and des .",
