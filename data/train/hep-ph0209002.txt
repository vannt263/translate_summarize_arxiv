    "one of the most exciting aspect of present high energy physics is the exploration of cp violation in b - meson decays , allowing us to overconstrain both sides and three weak phases @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 of the unitarity triangle of the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix @xcite and to check the possibility of new physics .",
    "the `` gold - plated '' mode @xmath10@xcite , which allow us to determine @xmath11 without any hadron uncertainty , was recently measured by babar and belle collaborations@xcite : @xmath12 .",
    "in addition , there are many other interesting channels with which we may achieve this goal by determining @xmath0 and @xmath1@xcite .    in this letter",
    ", we focus on the @xmath13 and @xmath3 processes , providing promising strategies for determining the weak phases of @xmath0 and @xmath1 , by using the perturbative qcd method .    the perturbative qcd method ( pqcd )",
    "has predictive power demonstrated successfully in exclusive 2 body b - meson decays , specially in charmless b - meson decay processes@xcite . by introducing parton transverse momenta @xmath14 ,",
    "we can generate naturally the sudakov suppression effect due to resummation of large double logarithms @xmath15 $ ] , which suppress the long - distance contributions in the small @xmath14 region and give a sizable average @xmath16 .",
    "this can resolve the end point singularity problem and allow the applicability of pqcd to exclusive decays .",
    "we found that almost all of the contribution to the exclusive matrix elements come from the integration region where @xmath17 and the pertubative treatment can be justified .    in the pqcd approach",
    ", we can predict the contribution of non - factorizable term and annihilation diagram on the same basis as the factorizable one . a folklore for annihilation contributions",
    "is that they are negligible compared to w - emission diagrams due to helicity suppression .",
    "however the operators @xmath18 with helicity structure @xmath19 are not suppressed and give dominant imaginary values , which is the main source of strong phase in the pqcd approach .",
    "so we have a large direct cp violation in @xmath20 , since large strong phase comes from the factorized annihilation diagram , which can distinguish pqcd from other models@xcite .",

    "even though isospin analysis of @xmath2 can provide a clean way to determine @xmath0 , it might be difficult in practice because of the small branching ratio of @xmath21 . in reality to determine @xmath0 , we can use the time - dependent rate of @xmath22 including sizable penguin contributions . in our analysis",
