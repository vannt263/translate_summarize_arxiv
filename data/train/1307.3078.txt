    "this paper is a formal corollary to the recent ref .",
    "@xcite , where the truncated wigner representation of quantum optics @xcite was extended to multitime problems .",
    "( for a discussion of operator orderings , such as normal , time - normal and symmetric , we refer the reader to the classic treatise of mandel and wolf @xcite . )",
    "the goal of ref .",
    "@xcite was to develop a practical computational tool , while formal analyses were reduced to the bare necessities . in this paper",
    "we give proper justification to the formal techniques underlying ref .",
    "the functional techniques used here are to a large extent borrowed from vasilev @xcite ; they were first outlined in preprint @xcite . however , in @xcite a number of important results ( notably , continuity of time - symmetrically ordered operator products ) were overlooked .",
    "important for the putting the results of this paper in perspective is the connection between phase - space techniques and the so - called _ real - time quantum field theory _ ( for details and references see @xcite ) . according to @xcite , the _ keldysh rotation _",
    "underlying the latter is a generalisation of weyl s ordering to heisenberg operators .",
    "this generalisation is nothing but the aforementioned time - symmetric ordering .",
    "this paper could thus equally be titled , `` phase space approach to real - time quantum field theory '' .",
    "for physical motivation and literature we refer the reader to the introduction to @xcite . here",
    "we only briefly touch upon the more recent developments .",
    "the truncated wigner representation has found its main utility for the investigation and numerical modelling of bose - einstein condensates ( bec ) , where the presence of a significant third - order nonlinearity makes the exact positive - p method unstable except for very short times @xcite , although it is still also used in quantum optics . over the last few years",
    "it has been used for an increasing number of investigations , with the most relevant mentioned in what follows .    the ability to include the effects of initial quantum states other than coherent",
    "was first shown numerically for trapped bec molecular photoassociation in three papers by olsen and plimak @xcite , olsen @xcite , and olsen , bradley , and cavalcanti @xcite , using methods later published by olsen and bradley @xcite to sample the required quantum states .",
    "johnsson and hope calculated the multimode quantum limits to the linewidth of an atom laser @xcite .",
    "the quantum dynamics of superflows in a toroidal trapping geometry were treated by jain _",
    "@xcite investigated dynamical instabilities of bec at the band edge in one - dimensional optical lattices , while hoffmann , corney , and drummond @xcite made an attempt to combine the truncated wigner and positive - p representations into a hybrid method for bose fields .",
    "@xcite used the truncated wigner to simulate polarisation squeezing in optical fibres , a system which is mathematically analogous to bec . the mode entanglement and einstein - podolsky paradox",
    "were numerically investigated in the process of degenerate four - waving mixing of bec in an optical lattice by olsen and davis @xcite and ferris , olsen , and davis @xcite . also analysing bec in an optical lattice , shrestha , javanainen , and rusteokoski @xcite looked at the quantum dynamics of instability - induced pulsations .",
    "et al . _ performed a comparison of the truncated wigner with the exact positive - p representation and a hartree - fock - bogoliubov approximate method for the simulation of molecular bec dissociation @xcite , concluding that the truncated wigner representation was the most useful in practical terms .",
    "this practical usefulness has been demonstrated in studies of bec interferometry @xcite , domain formation in inhomogeneous ferromagnetic dipolar condensates @xcite , vortex unbinding following a quantum quench @xcite , a reverse kibble - zurek mechanism in two - dimensional superfluids @xcite , the quantum and thermal effects of dark solitons in one - dimensional bose gases @xcite , the quantum dynamics of multi - well bose - hubbard models @xcite , and analysis of a method to produce einstein - podolsky - rosen states in two - well bec @xcite . along with its continuing use in quantum optics ,",
    "the above examples demonstrate that the truncated wigner representation is an extremely useful approximation method , allowing for the numerical simulation of a number of processes for which nothing else is known to be as effective .",
    "the task in @xcite was split naturally in two .",
    "firstly , we constructed a path - integral approach in phase space , which we called _ multitime wigner representation_. within this approach , truncated wigner equations emerged as an approximation to exact quasi - stochastic equations for paths . secondly , we developed a way of bringing time - symmetric products of heisenberg  operators @xcite , expressed by the path integral , to time - normal order @xcite .",
    "the respective relations , called _ generalised phase - space correspondences _ , originate in kubo s formula for the linear response function @xcite .",
    "however , the properties of time - symmetric operator products @xcite were formulated without proof .",
    "details of the limiting procedure defining the path integral were ignored as irrelevant within the truncated wigner approximation .",
    "the logic of the present paper is best understood by drawing an analogy with our ref .",
    "@xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "our goal was to extend _ normal - ordering - based _ approaches of quantum stochastics beyond quartic hamiltonians .",
    "this paper is an attempt to extend the techniques of ref .",
    "@xcite further , this time to the _ weyl - ordering - based _ method of ref .",
    "particulars aside , in @xcite we applied _ causal _ @xcite , or _ response _",
    "@xcite , transformation to perel - keldysh diargam series @xcite for the system in question .",
    "the result was a wyld - type @xcite diagram series , which we called _",
    "causal series_. these kind of diagram techniques are well known in the theory of classical stochastic processes @xcite .",
    "it is therefore not surprising that we could reverse engineer the causal series resulting in a stochastic differential equation ( sde ) for which this series was a formal solution . for quartic ( collisional ) interactions",
    "the result is the well - known positive - p representation of quantum optics . for other interactions , finding an sde in the true meaning of the term",
    "is not always possible because of the pawula theorem @xcite . in such cases",
    "the causal series may be only approximated by a stochastic _ difference _ equation ( s@xmath0e ) in discretised time .",
    "attempts to simulate emerging s@xmath0es numerically have not been encouraging @xcite .",
    "this is the primary reason why in ref .",
    "@xcite we resorted to approximate methods .",
    "the key point of @xcite is a formal link existing between conventional quantum field theory ( schwinger - perel - keldysh s closed - time - loop formalism ) and conventional quantum optics ( time - normal operator ordering and positive - p representation ) .",
    "the existence of such a link was first pointed out by one of the present authors in @xcite .",
    "for the purposes of this paper , both backgrounds are inadequate or missing and have to be built from scratch . on the quantum - field - theoretical side",
    ", we develop a formal framework of `` symmetric wick theorems '' expressing time - ordered operator products by symmetrically - ordered ones . similar to wick s theorem proper ,",
    "this allows us to construct a `` symmetric '' variety of perel - keldysh diagram series with corresponding `` symmetric '' propagators . on the quantum - optical side",
    ", we introduce what we called a multitime wigner representation generalising weyl s ordering to multitime averages of heisenberg operators .",
    "the necessary `` flavour '' of causal transformation can then be borrowed from @xcite .",
    "the link to time - normal ordering is then based on a fundamental link between commutators of heisenberg operators for different times and the response properties of quantum fields @xcite .",
    "all our results apply to nonlinear quantum systems with , to a large extent , arbitrary interaction hamiltonians .",
    "the existence of symmetric wick theorems for the change of time ordering to symmetric may be of independent interest for a wider audience than that for which this paper is primarily intended .",
    "it is for this wider audience that in the appendix we present the generalisation of symmetric wick theorems to arbitrary quantised fields .",
    "the glue that holds the paper together is the concept of time - symmetric ordering of heisenberg operators . continuing the analogy with @xcite ,",
    "this ordering replaces the time - normal operator ordering on which @xcite was built . on the quantum - field - theoretical side , we express `` symmetric '' propagators by the retarded greens function . the induced restructuring of `` symmetric '' perel - keldysh series _",
    "automatically _ turns them into perturbative series for quantum averages of time - symmetrically ordered products of heisenberg operators . on the quantum - optical side",
    ", time - symmetric ordering appears as a natural generalisation of the conventional symmetric ordering to heisenberg operators .",
    "quantum field theory and quantum optics are not equal here .",
    "time - symmetric ordering emerges in quantum field theory as a fully specified formal concept . at the same time",
    ", there does not seem to be any way of guessing , save deriving , this concept from within conventional phase - space techniques without a reference to schwinger s closed - time - loop formalism @xcite .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in sections [ ch :",
    "symm ] and [ ch : wick ] , two formal concepts are prepared for later use . in section [ ch : symm ]",
    "we define time - symmetric ordering of heisenberg operators and prove its most important properties : reality , continuity , and the fact that for free fields it reduces to conventional symmetric ordering .",
    "in section [ ch : wick ] we prove `` symmetric wick theorems '' generalising wick s theorem proper from normal to symmetric ordering . in section [ ch :",
    "keldysh ] , we introduce a functional framework and derive closed perturbative relations with symmetric ordering of operators . the multitime wigner representation of an arbitrary bosonic system is formulated in section [ ch : commresp ] . in section [ ch : dynaph ]",

    "section [ ch : mod ] and the appendix .",
    "operator orderings act mode - wise , so that extension to many modes is straightforward .    the time - dependent creation and annihilation operators are defined as , @xmath6formally , they are heisenberg field operators with respect to the free hamiltonian , e.g. , @xmath7 ,   \\end{aligned }   \\label{eq:60a } % \\nonumber % \\z \\end{aligned}\\]]where @xmath8 is @xmath9 in the interaction picture , @xmath10we shall term @xmath11 free - field , or interaction - picture , operators , because this is the role they play in real problems with interactions .",
    "symmetric ordering is extended to free fields postulating that , @xmath12furthermore , adding an arbitrary , and , in general , time - dependent , interaction term to @xmath13 , @xmath14allows us to introduce the pair of the heisenberg fields operators proper , @xmath15where the evolution operator is defined through the schrdinger equation , @xmath16interaction picture is introduced in the usual way by splitting the evolution operator in two factors , @xmath17where @xmath18 is the evolution operator with respect to @xmath9 , @xmath19and @xmath20 obeys the equation , @xmath21with @xmath22 being @xmath23 in the interaction picture , @xmath24 the reader should have noticed that we adhere to certain notational conventions .",
    "calligraphic letters are reserved for evolution and heisenberg operators .",

    "<S> in this work we present the formal background used to develop the methods used in earlier works to extend the truncated wigner representation of quantum and atom optics in order to address multi - time problems . the truncated wigner representation has proven to be of great practical use , especially in the numerical study of the quantum dynamics of bose condensed gases . in these cases </S>",
    "<S> , it allows for the simulation of effects which are missed entirely by other approximations , such as the gross - pitaevskii equation , but does not suffer from the severe instabilities of more exact methods . </S>",
    "<S> the numerical treatment of interacting many - body quantum systems is an extremely difficult task , and the ability to extend the truncated wigner beyond single - time situations adds another powerful technique to the available toolbox . </S>",
    "<S> this article gives the formal mathematics behind the development of our `` time - wigner ordering '' which allows for the calculation of the multi - time averages which are required for such quantities as the glauber correlation functions which are applicable to bosonic fields . </S>"
