    "one of the most powerful tools for studying the origin of ultra - high energy cosmic rays ( uhecrs ) is their energy spectrum , which manifests several features that reveal important information about the cosmic rays , their sources , and their propagation across cosmological distances .",
    "one example is the high - energy ( @xmath3  ev ) suppression in the spectrum which was predicted by @xcite and by @xcite , and is called the gzk cutoff .",
    "these authors predicted a strong suppression in the spectrum due to the interaction of cosmic rays with photons of the cosmic microwave background radiation .",
    "they pointed out that a spectrum suppression is expected in both cosmic protons ( by photo - pion production ) and heavier nuclei ( by spallation ) for particles traveling more than 50  mpc from their sources .",
    "if cosmic rays are protons there should also be a dip in the spectrum , caused by @xmath4 pair production in the same interactions , at an energy of about @xmath5  ev @xcite . for heavier nuclei , interactions with the background photon flux do not cause such a dip .",
    "the agasa experiment @xcite , comprised of a surface array of 111 scintillation counters , was the first detector to be large enough to test this theory with sufficient statistics .",
    "however , they did not observe the suppression .",
    "the first experiment to observe the gzk cutoff was the high resolution fly s eye ( hires ) experiment @xcite , which consisted of fluorescence detectors located atop two desert mountains in western utah .",
    "hires reported a cutoff energy of @xmath6  ev , which is consistent with a suppression of protons .",
    "they also observed the ankle structure : a hardening of the spectrum , at an energy of @xmath7  ev as expected for cosmic protons .",
    "( for both of these values , the first uncertainty is statistical and the second systematic . ) hires also published measurements of the shower maximum slant depth ( @xmath8 ) that indicated a predominately light composition above @xmath9  ev @xcite .",
    "a somewhat different picture is seen by the pierre auger observatory ( pao ) , located in argentina .",
    "the pao consists of a surface detector ( sd ) of 1600 water tanks , accompanied by 24 fluorescence telescopes which are equally apportioned between four sites located at the sd corners .",
    "the pao also observes the high - energy suppression , but at @xmath10 ev @xcite .",
    "they see the ankle also , but their @xmath8 results may indicate that the composition is heavy at the highest energies @xcite .",
    "one possible interpretation of the pao results is that the high - energy suppression is caused by spallation of heavy nuclei .",
    "the cause of the ankle would need to be explained by a separate mechanism .",
    "the telescope array ( ta ) experiment , also in western utah , is the largest experiment studying ultra - high energy cosmic rays in the northern hemisphere .",
    "a layout of the ta experiment is shown in figure [ fig : array ] .",
    "layout of the telescope array experiment .",
    "this figure shows the 507 surface detector counters deployed on a 1.2  km grid .",
    "fluorescence telescopes overlook the surface detector at three sites called middle drum ( md ) on the north , long ridge ( lr ) on the southwest , and black rock ( br ) on the southeast .",
    "the central laser facility ( clf ) is situated in the center of array , equidistant from all three fluorescence detectors.,scaledwidth=90.0% ]    it consists of a surface detector of 507 scintillation counters @xcite , plus 38 fluorescence telescopes @xcite located at three sites overlooking the sd .",
    "24 of the telescopes , deployed at the two southern sites , were built new for the experiment , and the 14 telescopes at the northern site are reconditioned hires telescopes .",
    "ta combines the experimental techniques of agasa and hires , in order to understand the difference between their results .",
    "this paper reports on a measurement of the cosmic ray spectrum above @xmath11  ev made by the ta sd over approximately four years of observation between may 11 , 2008 and may 20 , 2012 . for this study , we used an analysis method that while standard for fluorescence detectors , is being successfully implemented for the first time for a surface array studying cosmic rays in the ultra - high ( @xmath12  eev ) energy regime . instead of restricting our analysis to a domain where we expect 100% efficiency , as has been done by previous surface detector experiments at these energies , the ta sd detector aperture is calculated using extensive air showers generated in detail by the corsika simulation package @xcite , accompanied by a full geant simulation of the detector @xcite .",
    "another important aspect of this technique , new to surface detectors operating in the ultra - high energy regime , is the validation of the simulation by comparisons of key distributions from the data to those obtained from the monte carlo ( mc ) simulation .",
    "moreover , our study overcomes the inability of `` thinned '' simulated showers ( e.g. as used in corsika and aires @xcite ) to reproduce the particle density and arrival time fluctuations far from the core .",
    "the solution applied is a novel dethinning technique that replicates a non - thinned simulation @xcite at the lateral core distances where most of the detector data is collected .",
    "each counter of the ta sd consists of two layers of 1.2 cm thick plastic scintillator , both 3  m@xmath13 in area .",
    "photons produced by ionizing particles passing through the counters are collected by wavelength shifting fibers and read out by photomultiplier tubes , one for each layer .",
    "a histogram of pulse heights , triggered by a coincidence between the two layers within an individual sd , is collected every 10 minutes .",
    "this histogram is dominated by single muons with a count rate of @xmath14  hz .",
    "each 10-minute histogram is used to calibrate the associated scintillator to the pulse height of a minimum ionizing particle ( mip ) with @xmath15 accuracy .",
    "the sd array trigger requires at least three adjacent counters with pulse heights over 3 mip to fire within 8  @xmath16sec .",
    "a 50  mhz flash adc readout system then saves the signal traces for all counters in the array with more than 0.3 mip .",
    "two fits are used to reconstruct the properties of the cosmic ray .",
    "first , a fit to the times that counters were struck , using the modified linsley shower - shape function @xcite , is made to determine the arrival direction and the core position of the event .",
    "subsequently , a lateral distribution fit , with the same functional form used by the agasa experiment @xcite , is employed to find @xmath17 , the density of shower particles at a lateral distance of 800  m from the core .",
    "the energy is then estimated by using a look - up table in @xmath17 and zenith angle determined from an exhaustive monte carlo simulation .",
    "in the ultra - high energy regime , computer - time requirements make it impossible to follow every particle when simulating showers . an approximation called thinning",
    "is used in programs like corsika and aires to reduce the computational load by only performing a small , statistically representative sample of the air shower simulation . thinned",
    "showers can be used for simulation of fluorescence detectors because the fluorescence light comes mostly from near the shower axis where the particle density is extremely high , and the fluctuations in the signal are dominated by the poisson nature of fluorescence photon statistics .",
    "but for surface detectors , which operate far from the shower core , the number of shower particles is low and the thinning approximation fails to represent the intrinsic density fluctuations within the shower . to simulate the ta sd accurately ,",
    "we have developed a procedure called `` dethinning , '' where we statistically regenerate each group of thinned particles from its weighted representative @xcite .",
    "the monte carlo simulation of the ta sd has the goal of making an accurate representation of the data and our detectors .",
    "we start with a library of showers generated by the corsika program using qgsjet - ii-03 @xcite to model high - energy hadronic interactions , fluka @xcite to model low - energy hadronic interactions , and egs4 @xcite to model electromagnetic interactions . for this library ,",
    "proton showers were used exclusively because both the hires composition results @xcite and the preliminary ta composition result @xcite are consistent with protons generated by qgsjet - ii-03 . a complete representation of calibration and ontime for each surface counter as a function of time is also included .",
    "events are then chosen from our shower libraries according to the spectrum previously measured by the hires collaboration @xcite.direct comparisons between data and monte carlo show that the result closely resembles the data @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : dtmc_s800 ]     data and mc comparison of the event @xmath17 distributions .",
    "the reduced @xmath18 is 1.06 , indicating a good agreement .",
    ", scaledwidth=90.0% ]    shows a comparison of the @xmath17 of cosmic ray showers .",
    "the excellent agreement between the data and simulation exemplifies the accuracy of our simulation and the resulting efficiency calculation of the sd .",
    "the selection criteria employed in our analysis are as follows :    1 .",
    "each event must include at least five counters .",
    "2 .   the reconstructed primary zenith angle must be less than @xmath19 .",
    "3 .   the reconstructed event core must be more than 1200  m from edge of the array .",
    "4 .   both the timing and lateral distribution fits must have @xmath20/degree of freedom value less than 4 .",
    "the angular uncertainty estimated by the timing fit must be less than @xmath21 .",
    ".   the fractional uncertainty in @xmath17 estimated by the lateral distribution fit must be less than 25% .    between may 8 , 2008 and may 20 , 2012",
    ", 13,100 events above @xmath22 ev were collected that satisfy these criteria .",
    "figure  [ fig : eff_loge ]     efficiency as a function of energy .",
    "both trigger and reconstruction effects are included.,scaledwidth=90.0% ]    shows the efficiency of reconstruction calculated from the ta sd monte carlo program .",
    "the values of aperture and exposure for this data set , corresponding to the 100% efficiency region , are 920  @xmath23 and 3690  @xmath24 , respectively . for energies above @xmath22  ev ( where the efficiency is @xmath25 of its plateau value ) we can accurately simulate all air showers , both well- and poorly- reconstructed .",
    "the resolution of the ta sd energy determination is better than 20% above @xmath26  ev .",
    "the uncertainty in energy scale of the monte carlo simulation of an sd is large , and possible biases associated with the modeling of hadronic interactions ( e.g. , from extrapolations of cross sections measured at much lower energies ) are difficult to determine .",
    "however , the energy scale uncertainty is experimentally well - controlled for a fluorescence detector ( fd ) since the energy measurement is calorimetric .",
    "we therefore correct our energy scale to the ta fd using events seen in common between the fd and sd .",
    "the observed differences between the fd and sd events are well described by a simple proportionality relationship , where the sd energy scale is 27% higher than the fd .",
    "figure  [ fig : en_scatter ]     energy comparison between the ta sd and fd _ after _ the 27% normalization has been applied to the sd . , scaledwidth=90.0% ]    shows a scatter plot of fd vs sd energies , where the latter have been rescaled .",
    "events from all three fd stations were included in this plot .",
    "the two southern fd stations were calibrated using independent techniques from the northern station , which consists of reconditioned hires fluorescence telescopes .",
    "the resulting energy scales are consistent for all ta fluorescence detectors .",
    "figure  [ fig : e3j ]     cosmic ray flux multiplied by e@xmath27 .",
    "solid line shows the fit of the ta sd data to a broken power law . , scaledwidth=90.0% ]    shows the spectrum measured by the ta sd , where the differential flux , @xmath28 is multiplied by @xmath29 , and plotted against @xmath30 .",
    "the ankle structure and the suppression at the highest energies are clearly visible .",
    "a fit to a broken power law ( bpl ) determines the energies of these features .",
    "the fit finds the ankle at an energy of @xmath31  ev and the suppression at @xmath32  ev .",
    "the power exponents for the three regions ( below the ankle , between the breaks , and above the suppression ) are @xmath33 , and @xmath34 respectively . also shown in figure  [ fig : e3j ] are the spectra reported by agasa @xcite , hires ( monocular mode ) @xcite , and pao ( combined hybrid and sd ) @xcite .",
    "the hires and ta sd spectra agree very well , both in the energy region above @xmath35 ev where the ta sd is 100% efficient , and also at lower energies where ta employs a substantial efficiency correction .",
    "a linear extrapolation of the power law below the suppression predicts 58.6 events above the break ; whereas ta observed only 21 events .",
    "this difference corresponds to a poisson probability of @xmath36 , or 5.5 standard deviations significance .",
    "a related observable , @xmath37 , is the energy at which the integral spectrum falls to 1/2 of its expected value in the absence of the gzk cutoff . under a wide range of assumptions about the spectrum of extragalactic sources , @xmath37",
    "is predicted to be @xmath38 ev for protons @xcite .",
    "hires reported @xmath39 @xcite .",
    "we measure @xmath40 .",
    "this 5.5 standard deviation observation provides independent confirmation of the gzk cutoff observed by hires @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the energy of the cutoff is consistent with the interpretation that the composition is protonic .",
    "@xcite includes a description of systematic uncertainties in the sd spectrum measurement .",
    "the largest source of systematic uncertainty in the spectrum is that of the energy scale . since the sd energy scale is fixed to that of the ta fluorescence detectors , we take the systematic uncertainty in the sd energy to be 22% @xcite , the same as the fd .",
    "this propagates into a 37% uncertainty in the flux .",
    "we estimate the systematic uncertainty in the aperture calculation by removing the event selection criteria , one by one , and measuring the ratio of the number of events in the data and in the monte carlo simulation .",
    "this ratio does not change by more than 3% in any energy bin above @xmath22 ev , so we assign this value to be the systematic uncertainty in the aperture .",
    "we have measured the spectrum of cosmic rays in the energy range @xmath41  ev using the surface detector of the telescope array experiment . in the analysis ,",
    "we have introduced a technique , new to the ultra - high energy regime for surface detectors , of calculating the surface detector aperture using monte carlo simulation , which allows us to measure the spectrum even when the sd efficiency is less than 100% .",
    "this technique includes a dethinning process that enables the simulation of air showers with excellent detail .",
    "we found that the energy scale of the sd determined from simulations can be reconciled with the calorimetric scale of fluorescence detectors by a simple renormalization of 27% .",
    "two features are seen in the spectrum , the ankle and the high - energy suppression .",
    "fitting the spectrum to a broken power law shows a definite break at an energy of @xmath42  ev , which is consistent with the gzk cutoff energy expected for protons .",
    "an extended spectrum beyond the gzk energy is ruled out with a statistical significance of 5.5 standard deviations .",
    "our result is in excellent agreement with that of the hires experiment where fluorescence detectors were used .",
    "this result demonstrates , contrary to the agasa claim , that there is no difference between measurements of the cosmic ray spectrum using a fluorescence detector and a surface scintillation array once the energy scales are normalized .    in summary , by combining the two techniques of surface detectors and fluorescence detectors ( used by the agasa and hires experiments )",
    ", we have now obtained a consistent energy spectrum for ultra - high energy cosmic rays from both techniques .",
    "the spectrum obtained by our experiment demonstrates spectral features , a dip and a cutoff , consistent with the interaction of extra - galactic protons with the cosmic microwave background ( gzk process ) . finally ,",
    "if we account for a 20% systematic difference in energy scale , our measurement is in good agreement with the spectrum reported by pao with one exception : the gzk break is reported at @xmath43  ev by pao @xcite ; even with a 20% energy scale correction the difference between the ta and pao measurements is three standard deviations .",
