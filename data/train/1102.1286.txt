    "the primary aim of ultra - relativistic heavy - ion collisions is to produce and study a state of high - density nuclear matter called the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) . in the search of this new form of matter , penetrating probes are essential in order to gain information from the early stage of the collisions .",
