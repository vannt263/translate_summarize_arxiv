    "the last decade brought a great breakthrough in gamma - ray burst studies .",
    "the batse detectors on gro have shown that grbs are distributed isotropically on the sky , and that their brightness distribution is not consistent with a uniform source distribution in euclidean space ( paciesas et al .",
    "observations of grb afterglows in x - ray , optical and radio wavelength domains ( costa et al .  1997 ; groot et al .",
    "1997b ) led to identification of grb host galaxies ( groot et al .",
    "1997a ) and measurements of their redshifts .",
    "this has solved the long standing problem of their distance scale . while we learned that grbs come from cosmological distances , there are still two major difficulties in understanding this phenomenon .",
    "first , we do not fully understand the physics of the outburst .",
    "although several models have been proposed , they all have yet to meet some severe constraints imposed by observations ( i.e. releasing energies of @xmath0@xmath1  ergs in timescales as short as @xmath2s in the case of some grbs ) .",
    "second we do not know what are the astronomical objects leading to gamma - ray bursts , i.e. what are their progenitors .    in recent years the black hole accretion disk model for grbs has been given much attention ( fryer , woosley & hartmann 1999a ; meszaros 2000 ; brown et al .",
    "progenitors leading to this model include collapsars ( woosley 1993 ; paczynski 1998 , macfadyen & woosley 1999 ) and binary mergers : helium star black hole ( fryer & woosley 1998 ) , double neutron stars ( ruffert et al .",
    "1997 ; meszaros & rees 1997 ) , black hole neutron star ( lee & kluzniak 1995 ; kluzniak & lee 1998 ) and black hole white dwarf systems ( fryer et al .",
    "also recently the connection between supernovae and gamma - ray bursts received much attention ( paczynski 1999 ; woosley 2000 ; chevalier 2000 ) , however , there is still no clear evidence that these two phenomena are intrinsically correlated ( graziani et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "a good method of discerning among the binary progenitors is to compare theoretical predictions of their merger site distributions around host galaxies with location of observed grbs within host galaxies .",
    "binary population synthesis can be of great help in addressing this question .",
    "one can calculate the properties of a given binary population and then place it in a galactic gravitational potential to trace each binary until its components merge due to gravitational wave energy losses .",
    "this method has to deal however with a number of uncertainties , that are inherent in the binary population synthesis .",
    "moreover there are uncertainties in what type and mass of a galaxy to use .",
    "the binary population synthesis method has already been applied to the study of compact object binaries in the context of grb progenitors . however most studies have been concentrated only on double neutron stars and black hole neutron star systems .",
    "lipunov et  al .",
    "( 1995 ) have used their `` scenario machine '' to model the population of double neutron star and black hole neutron star binaries in a galaxy .",
    "they calculated the expected @xmath3-@xmath4 grb distribution assuming that they are standard candles and compared it with the batse observations .",
    "portegies - zwart and yungelson ( 1998 ) have considered the origin and properties of double neutron star systems and black hole neutron star binaries .",
    "they considered a few binary population synthesis models , with varying kick velocities , initial binary separations , initial mass ratios distribution and also considered cases with and without hyper accretion in the common envelope stage .",
    "they found the rates of mergers to be consistent with the grb rate provided that grbs are collimated to about ten degrees , and mentioned that double neutron stars may travel mpc distances out of a milky way like galaxy before merging .",
    "bloom , sigurdsson & pols ( 1999 ) considered double neutron stars as possible grb progenitors , and calculated distributions of mergers of these binaries around galaxies with different masses , varying the average kick velocities in the code .",
    "they found that a significant fraction of double neutron stars merge outside their host galaxies .",
    "bulik , belczynski & zbijewski ( 1999 ) considered the mergers of binaries containing neutron stars , and belczynski , bulik & zbijewski ( 2000 ) investigated differences between the populations of black hole neutron star binaries and the double neutron stars .",
    "belczynski et al .",
    "( 2000 ) found that black hole neutron star binaries merge closer to the hosts than the double neutron stars .",
    "fryer et al .  ( 1999a ) considered other types of binary progenitors of grbs within the framework of the black hole accretion disk model of the grb central engine .",
    "these were white dwarf black hole mergers , helium star black hole mergers , and collapsars in addition to the double neutron star systems and black hole neutron star binaries .",
    "they performed a thorough parameter study , and repeated the calculations with a number of modifications of their standard evolutionary model .",
    "they calculated the distribution of merger sites in the potentials of galaxies with the masses of @xmath5 ( milky way ) , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 , however they do not vary the galactic size with mass .",
    "bloom , kulkarni & djorgovski ( 2001 ) presented a very detailed study of the observational offsets between observed afterglows and grb hosts galaxies .",
    "they compare these observations with the theoretical distributions calculated with the code of bloom et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and conclude that the so called delayed merging remnants i.e. double neutron star systems and black hole neutron star binaries are unlikely to be grb progenitors , and argue in favor of the prompt bursters like collapsars and black hole helium star mergers .    in this work",
    "we extend our previous studies ( belczynski & bulik 1999 ; bulik et al .",
    "1999 ; belczynski et al .",
    "2000 ) to include four more proposed binary progenitors : compact object ( black hole or neutron star ) white dwarf binaries and helium star mergers with black holes or neutron stars .",
    "we use a much improved and well tested binary population synthesis code and for consistency we also present the updated results for the two previously studied types of proposed progenitors : double neutron star and black hole neutron star systems .",
    "we calculate the properties of the ensemble of each type of the proposed grb progenitors and find their distributions around different types of host galaxies .",
    "we compare the observed grb distribution around host galaxies with the models . in order to verify the robustness of the results we perform a detailed parameter study and discuss the population synthesis models which are responsible for the largest differences .",
    "an additional way of telling which group of the proposed binaries might be responsible for grbs is to predict their rates and compare them to the observed rate of grbs .",
    "population synthesis is a powerful tool for predicting rates of binary populations although it suffers from many uncertainties as some parameters of single and binary evolution are poorly known .",
    "moreover , population synthesis works well in predicting the relative numbers of events , while calculation of absolute rates requires additional assumptions .",
    "however , such attempts have been made by a number of authors mentioned above . using the population synthesis method we calculate merger rates of white dwarf neutron star , white dwarf black hole , double neutron star , neutron star black hole systems , and formation rates of helium star black hole and neutron star mergers .",
    "we compare the batse detection rate of grbs with the cosmic rates of the binary progenitors predicted in our calculations .    in  2",
    "we describe the population synthesis code _ startrack _ used to calculate properties of binary grb progenitors , in  3 we present the results , and finally  4 is devoted to discussion with conclusions .",
    "we use the _ startrack _ population synthesis code ( belczynski , kalogera & bulik 2001b ) . here , we summarize only the basic assumptions and ideas of the code .    the evolution of single stars is based on the analytic formulae derived by hurley , pols & tout ( 2000 ) . with these formulae we are able to calculate the evolution of stars for zero age main sequence ( zams ) masses : @xmath8 and for metallicities : @xmath9 .",
    "we follow the stellar evolution from zams through different evolutionary phases depending on the initial ( zams ) stellar mass : main sequence , hertzsprung gap , red giant branch , core helium burning , asymptotic giant branch , and for stars with their hydrogen - rich layers stripped off : helium main sequence , helium giant branch .",
    "we end the evolutionary calculations at the formation of a stellar remnant : a white dwarf , a neutron star or a black hole .",
    "there are two modifications to the original hurley et al .",
    "( 2000 ) formulae concerning the treatment of ( i ) final remnant masses , and ( ii ) helium - star evolution ( see belczynski et al .  2001b ; belczynski & kalogera 2001 ) .    the _ startrack _ code employs monte carlo techniques to model the evolution of single and binary stars . in this work",
    "we use _ startrack _ to evolve large ensemble of stars , and calculate statistical properties of the binary grb progenitors .",
    "a binary system is described by four initial parameters : the mass @xmath10 of the primary ( the component which is initially more massive ) , the mass ratio @xmath11 between the secondary and the primary , the semi - major axis of the orbit @xmath12 , and the orbital eccentricity @xmath13 .",
    "each of these initial parameters is drawn from a distribution and we assume that these distributions are independent . more specifically , the mass of the primary is drawn from the scalo initial mass function ( scalo 1986 ) , @xmath14 and within the mass range @xmath15 .",
    "the distribution of the mass ratios is taken to be @xmath16 following bethe & brown ( 1998 ) .",
    "the initial binary separations are assumed as in abt ( 1993 ) @xmath17 and finally , the initial distribution of the binary eccentricity is taken following duquennoy & mayor ( 1991 ) @xmath18    as we are interested only in the systems capable of producing binary grb progenitors , containing at least one ns or bh , we evolve only massive binaries , with primaries more massive than 5 m@xmath19 . during the evolution of every system we take into account",
    "the effects of wind mass - loss , asymmetric sn explosions , binary interactions ( conservative / non - conservative mass transfers , common envelope phases ) on the binary orbit and the binary components .",
    "we also include the effects of accretion onto compact objects in common envelope ( ce ) phases ( brown 1995 ; bethe and brown 1998 ; belczynski et al .",
    "2001b ) and rejuvenation of binary components during mass transfer episodes .",
    "once a binary consists of two stellar remnants ( ns , bh , wd ) , we calculate its merger lifetime , the time until the components merge due to gravitational radiation and associated orbital decay .",
    "the _ startrack _ code may be used in several tens of modes , allowing for the change of main evolutionary parameters and initial distributions . in the following , together with the given above initial distributions ,",
    "we define standard evolutionary model , with the set of parameters , thought to represent our best understanding of stellar single and binary evolution .",
    "( 1 ) _ kick velocities . _",
    "compact objects receive natal kicks , when they form in supernova explosions .",
    "neutron star kicks are drawn from a weighted sum of two maxwellian distributions with @xmath20kms@xmath21 ( 80% ) and @xmath22kms@xmath21 ( 20% ) ( similar to the one of cordes & chernoff 1998 ) .",
    "for black holes formed via partial fall back we use smaller kicks , but drawn from the same distribution as for ns .",
    "the kick scales with the amount of material ejected in sn explosion or inversely with the amount of falling back material ( i.e. , bigger the fall back , smaller the kick ) . for bh",
    "formed in direct collapse of massive stars , we do not apply any kicks , as no supernova explosion accompanies the formation of such objects .",
    "( 2 ) _ maximum ns mass . _",
    "we adopt a conservative value of @xmath23m@xmath19 ( e.g. , kalogera & baym 1996 ) .",
    "the mass of a compact object is estimated based on the mass and evolutionary status of its immediate progenitor , and not on any a priori assumptions .",
    "once the mass of a compact object is calculated , its type ( either ns or bh ) is set by the value of @xmath24 .",
    "thus the choice of @xmath24 does not affect the overall population of compact objects .",
    "however , it affects the rates and various properties of binary grb progenitors , as some of their groups contain either ns or bh ( see  3 ) .",
    "( 3 ) _ common envelope efficiency . _",
    "we assume @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the efficiency with which orbital energy is used to unbind the stellar envelope ( e.g. , webbink 1984 ) , and @xmath27 is the measure of the central concentration of the giant ( e.g. , dewi & tauris 2000 ) ; ( 4 ) _ non  conservative mass transfer . _ in cases of dynamically stable mass transfer between non  degenerate stars we allow for mass and angular momentum loss from the binary ( see podsiadlowski , joss , & hsu 1992 ) , assuming that the fraction @xmath28 of the mass lost from the donor is accreted to the companion , and the rest ( @xmath29 ) is lost from the system with specific angular momentum equal to @xmath30/@xmath31 .",
    "we adopt @xmath32 ( e.g. , meurs & van den heuvel 1989 ) and @xmath33 ( e.g. , podsiadlowski et al .  1992 ) ; ( 5 ) _ star formation history .",
    "_ we assume that star formation has been continuous in the disk of a given galaxy . to assess the properties of the current population of grb progenitors , we start the evolution of a single star or a binary system @xmath34ago , and follow it to the present time . the birth time",
    "@xmath34 is drawn randomly from the range 010 gyr , which corresponds to continuous star formation rate within the disk of our galaxy ( gilmore 2001 ) .",

    "2000 ) include the effects of mass loss due to stellar winds .",
    "mass loss rates are adopted from the literature for different evolutionary phases . for h - rich massive stars on ms ( nieuwenhuijzen & de jager ( 1990 ) ; using @xmath37 dependence of kudritzki et al .",
    "1989 ) , for rg branch stars ( kudritzki & reimers 1978 ) , on agb ( vassiliadis & wood 1993 ) and for luminous blue variables ( hurley et al .",
    "2000 ) . for he - rich stars",
    "w  r mass loss is included using the rates derived by hamann , koesterke & wessolowski ( 1995 ) and modified by hurley et al .",
    "( 2000 ) .",
    "the population synthesis code allows us to calculate the age for each system at the time when both stellar remnants have formed , and the subsequent merger time of a given system based on the remnant masses and their orbit .",
    "we also calculate the systemic velocity gain due to asymmetric sn explosions and/or associated mass loss .",
    "we use these informations to propagate binary grb progenitor systems in different galactic potentials , and to compute the distribution of their mergers sites around different mass and size hosts .",
    "the potential of a spiral galaxy can be described as a sum of three components : bulge , disk , and halo .",
    "a good representation of the galactic disk and bulge potential was presented by miyamoto & nagai ( 1975 ) : @xmath38 where the index @xmath39 refers to either bulge or disk , @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the parameters , @xmath42 is the mass , @xmath43 and the @xmath44 coordinates span the galactic plane .",
    "the dark matter halo potential is spherically symmetric @xmath45\\ ] ] where @xmath46 is the core radius .",
    "the halo potential corresponds to a mass distribution @xmath47 $ ] , and we introduce a cutoff radius @xmath48 beyond which the halo density falls to zero , in order to make the halo mass finite and the halo gravitational potential is @xmath49 when @xmath50 .",
    "we consider galaxies with four masses , expressed in the units of milky way mass ( @xmath51 ) : @xmath52 .",
    "for the milky way mass galaxy the bulge potential ( @xmath53 ) is described by : @xmath54kpc , @xmath55kpc , @xmath56 ; the disk potential ( @xmath57 ) : @xmath58kpc , @xmath59kpc , @xmath60 ; the halo potential : @xmath61kpc , and @xmath62 and the @xmath63kpc ( paczynski 1990 ; blaes & rajagopal 1991 ) . to obtain the potential of a galaxy with the mass @xmath64 we rescale all the masses by the factor of @xmath26 and the distances @xmath65 by @xmath66 .",
    "such scaling keeps the galaxy density constant , and we made sure that our model galaxies have flat rotation curves .",
    "we adopt the following distribution of stars within the disk of a given galaxy ( paczynski 1990 ) : @xmath67 the radial distribution is exponential @xmath68 and extends up to @xmath69 .",
    "the vertical distribution is also exponential @xmath70 for a milky way type galaxy we have @xmath71 , and these parameters are assumed to scale with the galaxy mass as @xmath66 .",
    "each binary moves initially with the local rotational velocity in its galaxy , and has no vertical component of velocity .",
    "after each supernova explosion the kick imparted on the binary is added and the binary trajectory is calculated until the merger occurs .",
    "fryer et al . ( 1999b ) , suggested the possibility that white dwarf neutron star ( wd - ns ) merger may lead to formation of a black hole accretion disk system , followed by a grb .",
    "since the grb outburst mechanism is not well understood , the results of hydrodynamic calculations of stellar mergers should be treated with some caution .",
    "however , we will consider the group of wd - ns systems as potential grb progenitors , for the sake of completeness of the study . from the entire group of coalescing wd - ns binaries we chose these , which have the best chance to produce observable grbs ,",
    "i.e. , systems in which wd are more massive than @xmath72 to make sure that the mass transfer onto the ns is unstable , and the total mass of the system satisfies @xmath73 , since we require that the ns has to accrete enough material to collapse to a bh and that the disk formed in the merger must have the mass of at least @xmath74 to produce a grb ( fryer et al . 1999b , 2001 ) .",
    "fryer et al .",
    "( 1999b ) also suggested that mergers of white dwarf black hole ( wd - bh ) binaries may give a rise to grbs . following the fryer et al .",
    "( 1999b ) hydrodynamical calculations , we require that wd mass is larger than @xmath75 to classify a coalescing wd - bh system as a potential grb progenitor . only for these high wd masses , the accretion of wd onto bh is dynamically unstable and the rapidly disrupted ( in several binary rotations ) wd forms a thick disk around bh , which may give a rise to grb .",
    "in figure  [ wddis ] we present the distribution of wd masses in coalescing wd - ns and wd - bh systems . for wd - bh binaries ,",
    "wd masses distribution rises sharply at @xmath76 and then falls approximately exponentially to flatten out for masses higher that @xmath77 .",
    "therefore , changing the @xmath78 to slightly higher / smaller values , will decrease / increase the number of wd - bh grb progenitors roughly proportionally to the wd mass limit change . for wd - ns systems ,",
    "the wd masses distribution is also rather flat close to and over @xmath72 .",
    "however , as the value of limiting mass of wd is highly uncertain , we will present two models with the decreased and increased @xmath78 .",
    "fryer & woosley ( 1998 ) proposed yet another type of binary grb progenitors , i.e. binaries merging in ce events , with one component being an evolved ( giant ) star and the other already a compact object , either ns or bh . in this scenario",
    ", the binary does not have enough orbital energy to eject the common envelope , so the compact object spiraling in finally merges with the helium core of the giant .",
    "the compact object disrupts tidally the helium star , accreting part of its material , and becoming a bh , if it was not one already .",
    "the remainder of the giant s helium core forms a thick accretion disk around the bh , a configuration , which is believed to give a rise to a grb .    in our models",
    "we distinguish systems that contain either a ns or a bh at the onset of the ce phase , leading to the final merger .",
    "we will denote systems containing ns as helium star / neutron star mergers ( he - ns ) , and containing bh as helium star / black hole mergers ( he - bh ) .",
    "following the detailed studies of he - ns and he - bh mergers ( bottcher & fryer 2000 ; zhang & fryer 2000 ) , we choose only these systems in which helium core mass exceeds @xmath79 as grb progenitors .",
    "the distributions of helium core masses for he - ns and he - bh at the onset of the final ce phase are shown in figure  [ hedis ] .",
    "both distributions rise sharply at @xmath80 , then for he - ns mergers the distribution falls down rapidly above @xmath81 , while for he - bh mergers the distribution decrease starts at a higher mass , @xmath82 , and is more gradual . thus the number of grb progenitor he - ns mergers depends strongly on the value of @xmath83 , so we will present models with different value of this limiting helium core mass .    finally , the most intensively studied binary progenitors of grbs are double neutron stars ( ns - ns ) and neutron star black hole systems ( ns - bh ) . in defining the boundary between ns - ns systems and ns - bh systems",
    "we assume that the maximal mass of a neutron star is @xmath84 , however we will also present results for two smaller limiting masses of @xmath85 .",
    "the mass distribution of compact objects in these types of binaries , starts in our code with the maximum at the @xmath86 , followed by a rapid decline ( which reflects the shape of the assumed initial mass function ) and then at around @xmath87 flattens out and stays roughly constant up to the highest bh masses of @xmath88 .",
    "the maximum bh mass is set by the effect of wind mass loss on massive stars .",
    "this distribution is presented and discussed in detail by belczynski et al .",
    "( 2001b ) .",
    "belczynski & kalogera ( 2001 ) and belczynski , bulik & kalogera ( 2001a ) identified new subpopulations of ns - ns binaries .",
    "the new subpopulations dominate the group of coalescing ns - ns systems , and moreover , they were found to exhibit quite different properties than the systems studied to date .",
    "given the importance of these subpopulations to our conclusions , in the following subsection we briefly summarize the results of belczynski & kalogera ( 2001 ) and belczynski et al .",
    "( 2001a ) .",
    "double neutron stars are formed in various ways , including more than 14 different evolutionary channels , identified in belczynski et al.(2001b ) .",
    "we find that the entire population of coalescing ns - ns systems , may be divided into three subgroups .",
    "_ group i _ consists of non - recycled ns - ns systems ( containing two non - recycled pulsars ) , which finish their evolution in a double ce of two helium giants .",
    "two bare co cores emerge after envelope ejection , and they form two ns in two consecutive sn type ic explosions . provided that the system is not disrupted by sn kicks and mass loss , the two ns form a tight binary , with the unique characteristic that none of the ns had a chance to be recycled . for more details",
    "see belczynski & kalogera ( 2001 ) .",
    "_ group ii _ includes all the systems that finished their evolution through a ce phase , with a helium giant donor and a ns companion . during the ce phase a ns accretes material from the envelope of the giant , becoming most probably a recycled pulsar .",
    "the carbon - oxygen core of the helium giant forms another ns soon after the ce phase ends .",
    "the system has a good chance to survive even if the newly born ns receives a high kick because it is very tightly bound after the ce episode . for more details",
    "see belczynski et al .",
    "( 2001a ) . _",
    "group iii _",
    "consists of all the other ns - ns systems formed , through the classical channels ( e.g. bhattacharya & van den heuvel 1991 ) .    in our standard model ,",
    "group ii strongly dominates the population of coalescing ns - ns systems ( 81% ) over group iii ( 11% ) and i ( 8% ) .",
    "this is due to the fact that we allow for helium star radial evolution , and usually just prior to the formation of a tight ( coalescing ) ns - ns system we encounter one extra ce episode , as compared to the classical channels .",
    "this has major consequences for the merger time distribution of the ns - ns population , and in turn for the distribution of ns - ns merger sites around their host galaxies .",
    "merger times of classical systems are comparable with the hubble time , and that gives them ample time to escape from their host galaxies . as it has been shown in previous studies ( e.g. , bulik et al .  1999 ;",
    "bloom et al .",
    "1999 ) which did not include helium star detailed radial evolution , a significant fraction of the ns - ns population tended to merge outside host galaxies , exactly like group iii - the classical systems .",
    "in contrast , the binaries of groups i and ii , due to the extra ce episode , are tighter , and their merger times are much shorter : of order of @xmath89myr .",
    "thus even if they acquire high systemic velocities due to the asymmetric sn explosions , they will merge within the host galaxies , near the places they were born .",
    "group i and ii dominate the population , and thus the overall ns - ns distribution of merger sites will follow the distribution of primordial binaries or star formation regions in the host galaxies .",
    "the formation of ns - ns systems of group i and ii depends on the assumption that evolved low mass helium donors can initiate and survive ce phase .",
    "this assumption have yet to be proven by detailed hydrodynamical calculations .    since",
    ", the properties of these new subpopulations were already discussed separately ( belczynski et  al .",
    "2001a ) we present here only the results for the overall population of ns - ns binaries .",
    "we call the time a given system needs to evolve from zams to form two stellar remnants , the evolutionary time and denote it by @xmath90 .",
    "we call the time required for these stellar remnants to merge due to gravitational radiation the merger time and denote it by @xmath91",
    ". the total lifetime of a given system is the sum of the two : @xmath92 . in figure  [ times ] we show the distributions of both evolutionary and merger times for all grb binary candidates , while in table  [ times ] we list the distributions medians and spans defined as the time range containing 90% of the systems around the median .    in general ,",
    "the evolutionary delays are of the order of a few to several tens myrs , and their distributions are rather narrow for different types of systems .",
    "since the rate of evolution of a given star depends primarily on its mass , @xmath90 is set mainly by the mass of a given binary components .",
    "the evolution proceeds slower for less massive stars , and @xmath90 is determined in general by the mass of the secondary ( unless the mass ratio is reversed due to the mass transfer ) .",
    "this is why @xmath90 for wd - ns and wd - bh systems is the longest and almost equal ( @xmath93  myr ) , as wd are the lightest components of binary grb candidates .",
    "the ns - ns and ns - bh binaries are formed in shorter times , with the median of @xmath90 distributions of @xmath94  and @xmath95  myr , respectively .",
    "evolutionary times for he - ns and he - bh @xmath90 are very short ( @xmath96  myr ) , as they finish their evolution even before formation of a second remnant .",
    "merger times are quite different for various binary grb candidates . for he - ns and he - bh mergers",
    "we do not list @xmath91 , as these events take place even before two stellar remnants are formed , due to the components merger in ce spiral in .",
    "the shortest merger times are found for ns - ns binaries and for wd - ns systems , with the medians of @xmath97  and @xmath98  myr , respectively .",
    "much longer merger times are characteristic of wd - bh systems ( @xmath99myr ) , with the longest @xmath91 found for ns - bh binaries ( @xmath100  myr ) .",
    "the method of population synthesis requires use of quite a number of parameters , and initial distributions of variables which may affect the final results . in order to assess their influence on the final results we have repeated the calculations with varying evolutionary parameters .",

    "the coalescence rates of different types of grb progenitors within each model are shown in table  [ rates ] .",

    "the statistical accuracy of most rates is better than a few percent , however in some cases where the rates are smaller than @xmath103myr@xmath21 the accuracy is of the order of a few tens percent , yet improving them would require a huge computational effort .",

    "we show the dependence of coalescence rates on the assumed kick velocity distribution . due to the fact that high kicks tend to disrupt binaries",
    ", the number of systems formed with at least one compact object , falls off quickly with the kick velocity .",
    "this has already been noticed for ns - ns and ns - bh binaries ( e.g. , lipunov , postnov & prokhorov 1997 ; belczynski & bulik 1999 ) , and also for wd - bh systems and he - bh mergers ( fryer et al .",
    "1999a ) . as seen from figure  [ frac ]",
    ", the coalescence rates of grb progenitors fall off approximately exponentially with the kick velocity .",
    "note however , that the slope is smaller for he - ns and he - bh mergers than for other types of progenitors .",
    "this is due to ( i ) only one kick the system receives , ( ii ) the relatively high total mass of the binary ( recall that @xmath110 ) , so the kick imparted to ns or bh does not have a big impact on such systems",
    ".    for the majority of models the rates for wd - ns mergers stay close to several coalescence events per myr per galaxy .",
    "however , the rate changes significantly ( @xmath111  myr@xmath21 ) for a few extreme models . besides the strong dependence of the rates on kick velocity discussed above ,",
    "a large number of wd - ns is produced in models d1 and d2 , in which the neutron star maximal mass is smaller than in the other models .",
    "this increase is due to our requirement that only systems with total mass higher than the maximal neutron star mass increased by 0.3 @xmath112 are classified as grb progenitors .",
    "in fact , the coalescence rate of _ all _ wd - ns systems ( irrespective of wd or total system mass ) is as high as @xmath113  myr@xmath21 and @xmath114  myr@xmath21 for our standard model and model d2 , respectively . for the very low ce efficiency of model e1 , the rate drops down almost to zero , since in this model many systems potentially able to form a wd - ns grb progenitor evolve through ce phase .",
    "once the ce efficiency drops , a system needs to use more orbital energy to expel the envelope , and it becomes tighter . at very small efficiencies , there is not enough orbital energy for envelope ejection , and the two stars merge , thus decreasing the final number of wd - ns systems .",
    "coalescence rates of wd - bh vary much less than these of wd - ns progenitors , and they stay close to few coalescence events per myr per galaxy for most models . the largest change ( @xmath115  myr@xmath21 )",
    "appears for models d2 and e1 similarly to the case of wd - ns .",
    "the lowest rate of model e1 is explained in the same way as for wd - ns progenitors .",
    "the highest rate of model d2 , reflects the fact of the lowest ns / bh mass limit , and many systems classified in other models as wd - ns , here are counted as wd - bh .",
    "the coalescence rates of he - ns change almost by 3 orders of magnitude ( @xmath116  myr@xmath21 ) , although for most models , including the standard one , they remain close to several events per myr per galaxy .",
    "the number of helium star mergers strongly ( 2 orders of magnitude ) depends on the required minimum mass of the helium core - see models p1 - 2 and also figure  [ hedis ] .",
    "this is explained by our adopted imf , which gives more low mass stars , therefore low - mass helium cores are much more abundant ( note the high rate of model p1 with @xmath117 ) than the massive ones ( low rate of model p2 with @xmath118 ) .",
    "the lowest rates are found for models d1 and d2 , with the maximal ns mass of 2.0 and 1.5 @xmath112 . with decreased @xmath119 , as compared to our standard model , we choose only the lightest possible primaries , which will evolve to form ns . on the other hand we require that the secondary must form @xmath120 helium core , so it needs to have been massive already at the start . in these models only the binaries with relatively comparable mass components ( @xmath121 ) may evolve to form he - ns mergers .",
    "thus , decreasing @xmath119 , narrows down the range of @xmath11 in which he - ns mergers may be formed , which results in drop of their rate ( recall that we adopted a flat initial mass ratio distribution ) .",
    "the rates for he - bh mergers are the most independent of model parameters varying just by an order of magnitude ( @xmath122  myr@xmath21 ) , which considering the extreme changes in model parameters and initial distributions is quite remarkable .",
    "the coalescence rate for standard model is 23.5 events per myr per galaxy , and it remains approximately at this level for the majority of models .",
    "the dependence of ns - ns and ns - bh merger rates on the model parameters is discussed in detail by belczynski et al .",
    "( 2001b ) , and in what follows we restrict the description just to a brief summary .",
    "merger rates for ns - ns systems change by two orders of magnitude in various models ( @xmath123  myr@xmath21 ) and the standard model rate is about 50 merger events per myr per galaxy .",
    "as these systems experience two sn explosions , and the ns receive highest possible kicks ( not lowered as in the case of bh ) , their rate depends very strongly on the assumed kick velocity distribution .",
    "the highest rates are found for smallest kick models ( b1 - 5 ) .",
    "production of coalescing ns - ns binaries is greatly reduced by reducing ce efficiency ( model e1 ) , for the reasons described above ( see the discussion of wd - ns merger rates ) . also altering the distribution of the initial mass ratio ( model m2 ) changes the rates significantly and leads to an enhanced production of ns - ns systems .",
    "finally , the merger rate of ns - bh systems stays at a rather constant level ( @xmath124  myr@xmath21 ) , with most model rates of approximately 10 events per myr per galaxy .",
    "the rate is not so sensitive to the kick velocity as the merger rates of ns - ns systems , because ns - bh binaries receive at least one smaller kick ( that imparted on the bh ) and also ns - bh systems are more massive , so the kicks have smaller chance to disrupt them . the smallest merger rate is found for the model with the enhanced wind mass loss rate ( model g2 ) . due to the high mass loss the stars do not form massive compact objects , and the number of bh formed ( and systems harboring bh )",
    "is greatly reduced .",
    "the highest rate is achieved by the shift in ns maximal mass of model d2 to its lowest value adopted here , which enhances the rate of ns - bh and depletes the rate of ns - ns systems .      _ standard model _",
    "the results of the population synthesis code can be combined with the cosmic star formation rate history to yield the rate of various types of grb progenitors as a function of redshift .",

    "they were born , while for smallest galaxies up to 10% merge outside but close to the host outer regions .",
    "since they are lighter than the wd - bh systems , and on average they receive higher kicks , one could expect that their mergers should be spread out more than these of wd - bh binaries .",
    "the distribution of the merger sites for a given mass galaxy is in general the result of two competing effects ; ( i ) the magnitude of kicks the systems of a given type receive and ( ii ) the systems characteristic lifetimes .",
    "these two effects are not independent ; the binary lifetimes become smaller with stronger kicks because then only the tight , strongly bound systems survive . as it turns out , for wd - ns systems the short lifetime effect dominates over the velocity effect , and",
    "although they receive higher kicks they do not have enough time to travel outside the host before the merger takes place .",
    "locations of he - ns and he - bh merger sites follow closely the initial distribution of their birth places , independently of the host galaxy mass ( see figure  [ ns ] ) .",
    "this is primarily due to their very short lifetimes but also to their small systemic velocity gain .",
    "both , he - ns and he - bh systems have the shortest lifetimes of all the potential grb progenitors studied here ( see table  [ times ] ) . their mergers take place even before the secondary finishes its nuclear evolution ( i.e. , before it forms a remnant ) in the ce phase , when the secondary evolves off the main sequence and expands to giant size .",
    "for all the other progenitor types , both stars have to first form the stellar remnants , and then usually considerable time is needed for gravitational radiation to bring the two remnants together to a final merger .",
    "also he - ns and he - bh systems are relatively heavy , so the one kick the system experiences , does not have a great effect on the systemic velocity .",
    "distribution of the projected distances of ns - ns merger sites follows very closely the initial distribution of primordial binaries ( see figure  [ ns ] ) .",
    "only 2% of ns - ns stars merge outside a massive host , and as little as 8% escape and merge outside of the lightest dwarf galaxies .",
    "these systems receive two kicks , however due to their very short merger times of the order @xmath89myr ( see belczynski et al .",
    "2001b for a discussion of the merger time distribution ) they predominantly merge within even the smallest hosts .",
    "the ns - ns merger site distribution is quite similar to that of wd - ns systems .",
    "however , for ns - ns merger distribution there is a tail extending to large distances from the host for small mass galaxies .",
    "this tail is due , to these systems which were formed along classical channels .",
    "these ns - ns have much longer merger times ( typically @xmath163  gyr ) than the rest of systems formed through one of the newly recognized pathways .",

    "the effect of such a treatment , as compared to our standard evolution where half of the material is lost form the system , is that post - mt systems have wider separations , since no material and thus no angular momentum is lost from the binary . naturally , the final wd - ns binaries are wider as well , and have longer merger times , which allow some systems to escape from host galaxies .",
    "such a model is rather extreme , as we know that during mt events material is lost from at least some systems ( e.g. , meurs & van den heuvel 1989 ) .",
    "distributions for wd - bh merger sites show quite significant spread , allowing the possibility that majority of these systems merge outside the low - mass hosts .",
    "although for massive hosts , most of the models show that these systems merge within the host boundary , for low mass galaxies as much as 40% , or even more merge outside the hosts .",
    "two most extreme cases are these for models designated as e3 and l1 . for both models ,",
    "the systems formed after ce or a mt phase are wider than for our standard evolutionary scenario .",
    "therefore , it is natural that wd - bh binaries have longer merger times and have greater chances of escaping the hosts .",

    "the probability even rises to 0.94 for the case of a very small mass @xmath178 galaxy , however this number is rather uncertain due to the very wide range of k - s probabilities obtained for different population synthesis models .",
    "these uncertainties are not that large in the case of @xmath7 and larger galaxies",
    ".    similarly we can not reject the he - bh and he - ns mergers . in these cases",
    "the probabilities are not as large as in the case of wd mergers , however these groups also constitutes a viable grb progenitor .",
    "one should note that the systematic errors due to different population synthesis models are very small in this case , and the main factor that influences the value of the ks test probability is the distribution of stars in a model galaxy .",
    "he - bh and he - ns mergers evolve on very short timescales and therefore take place in star forming regions .      _ merger rates _ a comparison of our merger rates of ns - ns and ns - bh binaries with a number of other studies has been discussed in detail by belczynski et al .",
    "( 2000b ) . in short ,",
    "our rates are in good agreement with previous theoretical predictions . although we have noted some significant differences , we attributed them to the more approximate treatment of stellar and binary evolution in earlier studies and to our recognition of new ns - ns populations .",
    "recognition which was based on the assumption that ce phases initiated by evolved low - mass helium stars do not always lead to binary component mergers .",
    "merger rates for several other binary grb candidates have been so far presented only by fryer et al .",
    "( 1999a ) .",
    "we are not able to directly compare the rates because fryer et al.(1999a ) did not define the masses of wd selected to enter the wd - bh grb progenitor candidate group .",
    "we encountered a similar problem in the case of he - bh mergers , for which the masses of he cores are not given .",
    "however , if we assume that their systems correspond to our definition of grb binary candidates , then we note a very close resemblance of the he - bh the rates , and a rather good agreement of wd - bh rates .",
    "fryer et al . ( 1999a ) found their rates of @xmath180myr@xmath21 for wd - bh and @xmath181myr@xmath21 for he - bh for their standard evolutionary model . in our models closely resembling the fryer et al .",
    "( 1999a ) standard model , in particular these with smaller binary fraction ( k1 ) and higher kicks ( b9 - 12 ) , we predict wd - bh rates of @xmath182myr@xmath21 and he - bh rates of @xmath183myr@xmath21 .    _ host merger site distributions _ we may compare our results to those of bloom et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , bulik et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , fryer et al .",
    "( 1999a ) , and belczynski et al .",
    "these authors calculated distributions of ns - ns and ns - bh mergers around different mass galaxies .",
    "the main conclusion of these studies was that a significant fraction ( up to 40% for massive hosts , and up to 80% for low mass hosts ) of ns - ns and ns - bh binaries merge outside of host galaxies . for ns - bh binaries",
    "we find very good agreement with previous studies , as we find that up to 25% and 80% of these binaries will merge outside a massive and low mass host ( see figure  [ nsps ] ) .",
    "although our calculations show bigger concentration of ns - bh mergers in massive hosts , it is explained by the fact that we have adopted decreased kicks for bh , and therefore systemic velocity gain is decreased as well . however , our conclusions for ns - ns mergers are very different from all previous studies , due to the newly recognized short lived populations of these binaries , as discussed throughout this work .    both fryer et al .",
    "( 1999a ) and bloom et al .",
    "( 2001 ) assumed that he - bh mergers will take place in the star formation regions of the host galaxies . with our calculations",
    "we may confirm that , in fact , he - bh and he - ns merger sites , follow exactly star formation regions in their host galaxies .",
    "fryer et al .  ( 1999a ) argued that wd - bh merger sites are also concentrated within host galaxies , a conclusion that was later adopted by bloom et al .",
    "our detailed calculations show that , in fact , for massive galaxies these systems follow closely the initial primordial binary distribution , and merge within hosts . however , for small mass galaxies , a significant fraction of wd - bh binaries merge outside of hosts . depending on the assumed evolutionary model as many as 50% of these systems",
    "may merge outside of small mass hosts ( see figure  [ wdps ] ) as discussed in  3.6 .",
    "fryer et al .  ( 1999a ) argued that as these systems have very short merger times of @xmath184myr , and they will not have enough time to escape from hosts .",
    "we find that the merger times of these systems are indeed of order of @xmath184myr ( see table  [ times ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , the actual calculations of wd - bh trajectories prove that this conclusion is not valid for small mass and size hosts ( @xmath185 ) .",
    "we have presented calculation of rates and spatial distributions around host galaxies of several binary merger events , which were proposed as possible grb progenitors .",
    "we have used the _ startrack _ population synthesis code in our calculations .",
    "we have found that the rates are very sensitive to the assumed set of stellar evolutionary parameters . using the rates alone",
    "we were not able to exclude any of the proposed binaries as grb progenitors , since the highest rates obtained were always higher than observed batse grb rate for any type of a binary . in the framework of the standard population synthesis model ( model a ) we find that the total rate of all the proposed binary events is roughly ten times larger than the observed grb rate .",
    "however , we find that the spread in the rates due to uncertainties in population synthesis is large , and in some cases exceeds a factor of @xmath184 .",
    "this corresponds to the uncertainty in the estimate of the collimation of a factor of ten . on the other hand we note that our standard model ( model a ) leads to an expected collimation half  opening angle of @xmath186",
    "the measured collimation angles are somewhat smaller than this value , typically a few degrees ( panaitescu & kumar 2001 ) .",
    "estimates of the grb rates or collimation based on population synthesis alone carry large systematic errors .",
    "distributions of binary system merger sites around galaxies may be compared to the locations of grb optical afterglows with respect to the galaxies identified as their hosts .",
    "most of grbs take place inside or close to the host galaxies ( e.g. , bloom et al .",
    "2001 ) . observed grb hosts are small - mass galaxies , often thought to be going through vigorous star formation phase .",
    "there are no reliable grb host mass estimates , and thus we have calculated models for a range of galaxy masses .",
    "our standard model calculations were repeated for a number of different evolutionary models to assess the robustness of our results . we have found that the ns - bh mergers take place mainly outside of their host galaxies , and thus are inconsistent with the observed locations of grbs around hosts .",
    "some wd - bh binaries may merge outside the star formation regions of their host galaxies .",
    "however , the distribution of the wd - bh merger sites around their host galaxies is consistent with the observed distribution of grb offsets from the centers of galaxies .",
    "thus one can not reject the wd - bh mergers purely on the basis of comparison with the observed offsets .",
    "however , if one additionally requires that the mergers should take place in the proximity of star forming regions in galaxies then the wd - bh mergers can be rejected as potential grb candidates .",
    "merger sites of wd - ns , he - ns , he - bh , and ns - ns trace the star formation regions of the hosts , for all the cases of the host mass and size considered here , and independently of the adopted population synthesis model .",
    "we conclude that these types of binaries may be responsible at least for a part of observed grbs .",
    "grbs form a very nonuniform group of events , with different outburst times , very different light curves and observed energies .",
    "thus , there is a possibility that grbs originate in more than one type of progenitor .",
    "locations of grbs with respect to host galaxies has so far been measured only for long grbs .",
    "there is a growing evidence that these grbs are related to collapsing massive stars : collapsars .",
    "however , our results show that several types of binary system progenitors can not be rejected purely on the basis of their merger site distribution . additionally ,",
    "if binaries were responsible for only a part of the observed grbs , we also can not exclude them purely on the basis of their expected coalescence rates .    because of the expected short duration times , ns - ns and ns - bh mergers are the primary candidates as short burst progenitors .",
    "these two populations exhibit very different distributions of merger sites .",
    "mergers of ns - ns systems take place predominantly within hosts , to the contrary of what was so far believed , provided that ce phases initiated by low - mass helium stars do not always lead to binary component mergers , assumption which yet have to be tested by detailed hydrodynamical calculations . on the other hand ,",
    "a significant fraction of ns - bh systems merge outside of their host galaxies . at some point in the future",
    "afterglows from short grbs will be observed and their locations with respect to host galaxies will be measured , and then such calculations may provide a useful tool to distinguish between these two progenitor models ( perna & belczynski 2001 ) . future and current space missions like hete - ii , integral , glast or swift will hopefully measure precise positions of a large number of bursts even of the short duration and settle down the issue of grb progenitors .",
