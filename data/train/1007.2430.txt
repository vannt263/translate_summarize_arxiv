    "it has been widely discussed that qcd predicts at high - energy formation of a new state of matter , the so - called color - glass condensate ( cgc ) @xcite . in this state , the density of quarks and gluons @xmath1 with transverse momenta less that @xmath2 reaches a high value , namely @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the strong coupling constant and @xmath2 is a new momentum scale ( saturation momentum ) that increases with energy .",
    "therefore , @xmath5 and this fact allows us to treat this system on solid theoretical basis .",
    "one of the most characteristic and qualitative consequences of the cgc is the emergence of a new mechanism for hadron production at high energy . in this approach",
    ", the process of secondary hadron production goes in two stages : production of gluon mini - jet with a typical transverse momentum @xmath2 ; and the decay of gluon mini - jets into hadrons .",
    "the cgc picture for the hadron production has passed two critical tests .",
    "first , it explains the main features of hadron multiplicity in heavy ion - ion collisions at rhic ( kln papers @xcite ) ; and it predicts the inclusive hadron production in proton - proton ( @xmath6 ) collisions @xcite at the lhc which was recently confirmed experimentally by the cms collaboration at @xmath7 tev @xcite and the lower lhc energies @xcite , see also ref .",
    "the ion - ion collisions at the lhc will lead to a crucial test of the cgc approach .",
    "indeed , the kln success @xcite in the description of rhic data shows that we are dealing with scatterings of dense partonic systems even at rather low energies . at higher energies we expect that the density of scattering systems increases resulting in more transparent and unambiguous evidence for the creation of the cgc .    in this paper",
    "we wish to extend our approach @xcite to ion - ion ( @xmath8 ) collisions at the lhc . as it was discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , we improve the kln approach @xcite in various ways incorporating the unintegrated gluon density that describes hera data at small bjorken-@xmath0 .",
    "we also include our knowledge on proton - proton scatterings at the lhc to make our prediction more reliable .",
    "in particular , we re - calculate the saturation momentum for nuclei from the saturation momentum in the proton target obtained from dis data at hera and confront it with the rhic s gold - gold data . on the contrary , in the kln approach @xcite ,",
    "the lhc saturation momentum was found via an extrapolation of the energy dependence of the saturation scale at rhic in the bfkl region .    in the next section ,",
    "we discuss the @xmath9-factorization and our main formulation for the inclusive hadron production in @xmath6 and @xmath8 collisions .",
    "in particular , we introduce the impact - parameter dependent saturation scale for a proton and a nuclear target .",
    "section iii is devoted to comparison with the experimental data and to discussion of various predictions for the lhc energies .",
    "finally , we conclude in sec . iv .",
    "the gluon jet production in nucleus - nucleus collisions can be described by @xmath9-factorization given by @xcite , [ m1 ] = d^2 k_t ^g_a(x_1;_t)^g_a(x_2;_t -_t ) , where @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the transverse - momentum and rapidity of the produced gluon mini - jet .",
    "@xmath13 denotes the unintegrated gluon density and is the probability to find a gluon that carries @xmath14 fraction of energy with @xmath9 transverse momentum in the projectile ( or target ) nucleus @xmath15 .",
    "we defined @xmath16 where @xmath17 denotes the number of colors .",
    "the @xmath9-factorization has been proven @xcite for the scattering of a diluted system of parton with a dense one .",
    "such a process can be characterized by two hard scales : the transverse momentum of produced particle @xmath11 and a saturation scale which are both larger than the soft interaction scale @xmath18 .",
    "the ion - ion scattering is a typical example in which we have three scales : @xmath11 and two saturation scales for the projectile and the target .",
    "the @xmath9-factorization might be then violated only at low @xmath19 and @xmath20 , and when @xmath21 is smaller than both saturation scales .",
    "outside of this kinematic region we are actually dealing with scatterings of diluted - dense system since one of the saturation scales is small . for the case of scatterings of dense - dense system of partons ,",
    "the @xmath9-factorization has not yet been proven .",
    "nevertheless , the success of the kln approach @xcite which is based on the @xmath9-factorization , in description of the experimental data at rhic for gold - gold collisions suggests that the @xmath9-factorization is currently the best tool that we have at our disposal for the processes of ion - ion scatterings .",
    "the relation between the unintegrated gluon density @xmath22 and the color dipole - nucleus forward scattering amplitude has been obtained in ref .",
    "it reads as follows [ m2 ] ^g_a(x_i;_t)= d^2 b d^2 r_t e^i _ t_t^2_t n^g_a(x_i ; r_t ; b ) , with notation [ m3 ] n^g_a(x_i ; r_t ; b ) = 2 n_a(x_i ; r_t ; b ) - n^2_a(x_i ; r_t ; b ) , where @xmath23 is the dipole - nucleus forward scattering amplitude which satisfies the perturbative nonlinear small-@xmath0 balitsky - kovchegov ( bk ) quantum evolution equation @xcite . in the above",

    ", we extended the @xmath9-factorization given in by introducing a running strong - coupling @xmath28 .",

    "the procedure how to select the event with a fixed @xmath32 and its relation to the centrality bins is well - known , see for example refs .",

    "( [ m1 ] ) is not a simple fourier transformation which is commonly used in literature and also depends on the impact - parameter .",
    "the impact - parameter dependence in these equations is not trivial and should not be in principle assumed as an over - all factor . using the general properties of high density qcd that the underlying physics depends only on the saturation scale we reconstruct the dipole - nucleus scattering amplitude in two steps .",
    "first , we choose the saturation model which effectively incorporates all known saturation properties @xcite driven by the bk equation including the impact - parameter dependence of the dipole amplitude @xcite .",
    "this model describes both the hera dis data at small-@xmath0 @xcite and the proton - proton lhc data @xcite .",
    "second , we replace the proton saturation momentum by that of the nucleus .",

    "( [ m8 ] ) gives @xmath55 , in agreement with the basic idea of saturation and the cgc picture @xcite .",
    "this is because @xmath56 ( where a is the effective mass number of the nucleus in a given centrality ) and the integral in eq .",

    "therefore , the main contribution of the unintegrated gluon density at the lhc high - energy in the kinematic region considered here for both @xmath8 and also @xmath6 collisions @xcite comes from the small-@xmath0 region where the saturation physics is important .",
    "for the importance of the saturation effects in @xmath68 collisions at the lhc , see ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the @xmath9-factorization eqs .",
    "( [ m1],[m4 ] ) gives the cross - section of radiated gluon mini - jets with zero mass while what is actually measured experimentally is the distribution of final hadrons .",
    "we therefore should model the nonperturbative hadronization stage of gluon mini - jets .",
    "we employ the local parton - hadron duality principle @xcite , namely the hadronization is a soft process and can not change the direction of the emitted radiation .",
    "hence the form of the rapidity distribution of the mini - jet and the produced hadron are different only with a numerical factor @xmath69 .",
    "it is well - known that the general assumption about hadronization leads to the appearance of mass of the mini - jet which is approximately on average equal to @xmath70 @xcite where @xmath18 is the scale of soft interaction .",
    "the mini - jet mass @xmath71 effectively incorporates the nonperturbative soft pre - hadronization in the pseudo - rapidity space and can be approximately related to the saturation scale @xcite .",
    "accordingly , one should also correct the kinematics every where in eq .",
    "( [ m4 ] ) due to the presence of a non - zero mini - jet mass , namely replacing @xmath72 in @xmath73 and also in the denominator of @xmath74 .",
    "finally , in order to take account of the difference between rapidity @xmath12 and the measured pseudo - rapidity @xmath75 , we employ the jacobian transformation between @xmath12 and @xmath75 @xcite .    following ref .",
