    "diffusion controlled bio - chemical reactions play a central role in keeping any organism alive  @xcite : the transport of molecules through cell membranes , the passage of ions across the synaptic gap , or the search carried out by drugs on the way to their protein receptors are predominantly diffusive processes . further more ,",
    "essentially all of the biological functions of dna are performed by proteins that interact with specific dna sequences  @xcite , and these reactions are diffusion - controlled .",
    "however , it has been realized that some proteins are able to find their specific binding sites on dna much more rapidly than is ` allowed ' by the diffusion limit  @xcite .",
    "it is therefore generally accepted that some kind of facilitated diffusion must take place in these cases .",
    "several mechanisms , differing in details , have been proposed .",
    "all of them essentially involve two steps : the binding to a random non - specific dna site and the diffusion ( sliding ) along the dna chain .",
    "these two steps may be reiterated many times before proteins actually find their target , since the sliding is occasionally interrupted by dissociation .",
    "berg  @xcite and zhou  @xcite have provided thorough ( but somewhat sophisticated ) theories that allow estimates for the resulting reaction rates .",
    "recently , halford has presented a comprehensive review on this subject and proposed a remarkably simple and semiquantitative approach that explicitly contains the mean sliding length as a parameter of the theory  @xcite .",
    "this approach has been refined and put onto a rigorous base in a recent work by the authors  @xcite .",
    "although analytical models provide a good general understanding of the problem , they fail to give quantitative predictions for systems of realistic complexity .",
    "therefore , numerical simulations are required to calibrate the set of parameters that form the backbone of these models . however , a straight forward simulation of a protein searching through mega - bases of non - target dna to find its specific binding site would be prohibitive for all except for the most simple numerical models .",
    "fortunately , there are better ways .",
    "two of the authors ( kk and jl ) have recently introduced the method of excess collisions ( mec ) for an efficient simulation of intramolecular reactions in polymers  @xcite . in the present work ,",
    "this method is modified to apply to second order diffusion controlled chemical reactions ( section [ sec : mec ] ) .",
    "we thereby construct a simple random walk approach to facilitated diffusion of dna - binding proteins ( section [ sec : facilitated ] ) and apply the mec and our analytical estimate for reaction times to this model ( section [ sec : appl ] and [ sec : tauf ] ) .",
    "section [ sec : chain ] provides details about the generation of dna - chains , followed by a set of simulations covering a large range of system dimensions ( section [ sec : simu ] ) to verify the performance of the mec .",
    "we consider a ( time - homogeneous ) stochastic process . the problem is to find the average time @xmath0 of the first arrival at a certain state a , provided that , at time @xmath1 , the system occupied another state b.",
    "suppose we observe the system for a long time interval @xmath2 and monitor the events of entering state a. these events will be referred to as collisions .",
    "each collision that occurs for the first time after visiting state b will be called prime collision .",
    "we obtain the ( asymptotically correct for @xmath3 ) relation @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the average numbers of all and of prime collisions during the time interval @xmath2 , respectively , and @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the corresponding mean recurrence times . hence , @xmath9 the ratio @xmath10 defines the average number of collisions between two visits to state b and does actually not depend on @xmath2 , once @xmath2 is chosen sufficiently large .",
    "the mean recurrence time @xmath8 of prime collisions is simply the average time the system requires to move from state a to b and back from state b to a : @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the mean time of first arrival at state b starting from a. with eq .",
    "( [ eq:10 ] ) we then obtain @xmath13    this relation is useful for the numerical estimation of @xmath0 if @xmath14 . a simulation cycle then starts in state a and ends as soon as state b is reached , i.e.  the reversed reaction @xmath15 is simulated in order to obtain the ( much lower ) reaction rate of the original reaction @xmath16 . in this case",
    "we can write @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the average number of collisions in a simulation cycle and the second term accounts for the prime collision ( which is not observed in the simulations , since the cycle starts at the time instant that immediately follows the prime collision ) .",
    "as will be shown later in section [ sec : appl ] , the recurrence time @xmath7 can be renormalized and computed efficiently inside a small test system . note that eq .",
    "( [ eq:20 ] ) can be written as @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the mean number of excess collisions per simulation cycle  @xcite , since the ratio @xmath21 is just the mean number of collisions that would be observed in a simulation run of length @xmath12 with a starting point at an arbitrary state of the system ( not necessary state a ) .",
    "we consider a spherical volume ( cell ) of radius @xmath22 and inside it a worm - like chain ( dna ) of length @xmath23 and radius @xmath24 .",
    "the protein is represented as a random walker moving inside the cell with a certain time step @xmath25 .",
    "a collision takes place once the walker enters the active binding site , a spherical volume of radius @xmath26 positioned in the middle of the chain that , in its turn , coincides with the center of the cell .",
    "we want to point out that the parameter @xmath26 does not necessary correspond to any geometrical length in the real system .",
    "it defines a probability for the reaction to take place , and may cover additional variables which are not included explicitly in the model , like protein orientation and conformation .",
    "an attractive step potential is implemented as @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the shortest distance between walker and chain .",
    "this defines a pipe with radius @xmath24 around the chain contour that the walker is allowed to enter freely from outside , but to exit only with the probability @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the boltzmann factor , otherwise it is reflected back inside the chain .",
    "we may therefore denote @xmath31 as _ exit probability_. it is important to note that @xmath31 defines the equilibrium constant @xmath32 of the two phases , the free and the non - specifically bound protein , according to @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the concentration of free proteins and @xmath35 is the linear density of proteins that are non - specifically bound to the dna , with @xmath36 being the geometric volume of the chain .",
    "the two states of interest are the protein entering the cell , b , and the same protein reaching the active site in the center of the cell , a. more specifically , we are interested in finding the time @xmath0 the walker requires to reach a distance @xmath37 when starting at distance @xmath38 .    we shall first define the excluded volume of the chain as @xmath39 } { k_{\\rm b } t}\\right)\\right]\\ , d{\\bf r } = v_c\\ , \\left ( 1 - \\frac{1}{p } \\right)\\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath40 is the energy of the walker as defined by eq .",
    "( [ eq:40 ] ) and the integration is performed over the geometric volume of the cell , @xmath41 .",
    "the effective volume @xmath42 of the cell is then @xmath43 next we assume that simulations were carried out within a small test system of radius @xmath44 and that the recurrence time @xmath45 of the walker was found .",
    "its recurrence time in the larger system is then found as @xmath46 where we have defined @xmath47 this ratio does not depend on system size and may therefore be called _ specific recurrence time_. it only depends on the potential - depth @xmath48 and the step - size chosen for the random walk .",
    "the idea is to compute @xmath49 ( as described in section [ sec : tautilde ] ) for a small test system with dimensions of the order of @xmath26 ( which is the radius of the specific binding site ) to obtain @xmath7 for the system of interest using eq .",
    "( [ eq:80 ] ) .",
    "once @xmath7 is known , @xmath12 is computed via random walk simulations in the large system , starting at @xmath50 and terminating as soon as the periphery of the cell @xmath51 is reached . following the trajectory of the walker , the number of collisions @xmath52 is monitored as well , so that eq .",
    "( [ eq:20 ] ) can be used to determine the much longer reaction time @xmath0 .      as has been discussed in detail elsewhere",
    "@xcite , it is possible to estimate the reaction time for the protein using an analytical approach , once certain conditions are satisfied .",

    "is known analytically via eq .",
    "( [ eq:50 ] ) .",

    "a ( non rigorous ) interpretation of eq .",
    "( [ eq:95 ] ) is as follows : the first term in the round brackets represents the time of free diffusion of the walker , whereas the second term stands for the time of one - dimensional sliding . with increasing affinity of the walker to the chain ( expressed as a reduced value for the exit probability @xmath31 ) ,",
    "the sliding variable @xmath60 increases and the contribution of free diffusion to the reaction time ( first term in [ eq:95 ] ) becomes less significant . at the same time , the second term of eq .",
    "( [ eq:95 ] ) is growing . depending on the choice of system parameters",
    ", there may be a turning point where the latter contribution over - compensates the former , so that the total reaction time increases once @xmath60 is growing further .    for a random walk model as simple as used here ,",
    "this analytical formula describes the reaction times well within 10% tolerance , as long as the following conditions are satisfied : ( 1 ) @xmath61 , i.e.  the sliding parameter should be small compared to the system size .",
    "this restriction assures the correct normalization of the protein s probability distributions and the diffusion efficiencies as discussed in  @xcite .",
    "( 2 ) during the diffusion process , the system reaches its equilibrium , so that the constant @xmath32 represents the average times the protein spends in free and in non - specifically bound mode .",
    "this requires either a crowded environment ( the chain - density inside the cell is high enough ) or a reasonably small value for @xmath60 , since the initial position of the walker is always at the periphery and outside the chain , i.e.  not in equilibrium .",
    "( 3 ) @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is the persistence length of the chain .",
    "this restriction accounts for the assumption that the walker moves along an approximately straight line during one sliding period .",
    "however , numerical tests have shown that deviations from a straight geometry actually have little impact to the accuracy of the model .",
    "( 4 ) the step - size of the random walk has to be small compared to the size of the binding site .",
    "it should be pointed out that an analytical approach as simple as that is by no means supposed to simulate the actual situation in a living cell .",
    "instead , it serves as a platform for a much wider class of semi - empirical models .",
    "the sliding - parameter @xmath60 contains the affinity of non - specific protein - dna binding and is flexible to vary with the potential chosen for the simulation .",
    "the diffusion coefficients @xmath55 and @xmath56 can be adapted to experimental measurements , and the target size @xmath26 contains protein - specific reaction probabilities .",
    "these parameters can be fitted to either describe system - specific experimental results or the output of more sophisticated numerical codes which would otherwise not permit any analytical treatment .",
    "in order to approximate the real biological situation , the dna was modeled by a chain of straight segments of equal length @xmath64 .",
    "its mechanical stiffness was defined by the bending energy associated with each chain joint : @xmath65 where @xmath66 represents the dimensionless stiffness parameter , and @xmath67 the bending angle .",
    "the numerical value of @xmath66 defines the persistence length ( @xmath63 ) , i.e.  the `` stiffness '' of the chain .",
    "the excluded volume effect was taken into account by introducing the effective chain radius @xmath24 .",
    "the conformations of the chain , with distances between non - adjacent segments smaller than @xmath24 , were forbidden .",
    "the target of specific binding was assumed to lie exactly in the middle of the dna .",
    "the whole chain was packed in a spherical volume ( cell ) of radius @xmath22 in such a way that the target occupied the central position .    to achieve a close packing of the chain inside the cell",
    ", we used the following algorithm .",
    "first , a relaxed conformation of the free chain was produced by the standard metropolis monte - carlo ( mc ) method .",
    "for the further compression , we defined the center - norm ( c - norm ) as the maximum distance from the target ( the middle point ) to the other parts of the chain .",
    "then , the mc procedure was continued with one modification .",
    "namely , a mc step was rejected if the c - norm was exceeding 105% of the lowest value registered so far .",
    "the procedure was stopped when the desired degree of compaction was obtained .",
    "the protein was modeled as a random walker within the cell with reflecting boundaries . during one time",
    "- step it was displaced by the distance @xmath57 in a random direction .",
    "once approaching the chain closer than its radius @xmath24 defining the  non - specific binding pipe \" , it was allowed to enter it freely and continue its random walk inside . upon crossing the pipe boundary from inside ,",
    "it was either allowed to pass with the exit probability @xmath31 or otherwise reflected back inside , as described in section [ sec : facilitated ] .    below in this paper , one step @xmath25 was chosen as the unit of time and one persistence length @xmath68 nm of the dna chain as the unit of distance .",
    "the following values of parameters were used .",
    "the length of one segment was chosen as @xmath69 , so that one persistence length was partitioned into 5 segments .",
    "the corresponding value of the stiffness parameter was @xmath70  @xcite .",
    "the chain radius was @xmath71 , and the active site was modeled as a sphere of identical radius @xmath72 embedded into the chain .",
    "the step - size of the random walker both inside and outside the chain was @xmath73 , corresponding to a diffusion coefficient @xmath74 .",
    "this choice was a compromise between accuracy and simulation time .",
    "tests have confirmed that a smaller step - size could somewhat reduce the gap between theoretical ( eq .",
    "[ eq:95 ] ) and simulated reaction time at small values of @xmath60 .",
    "to compute the specific recurrence time @xmath49 of eq .",
    "( [ eq:85 ] ) , a very small test system is sufficient .",
    "moreover , the computations can be carried out for the collisions from within the specific binding site of radius @xmath26  @xcite .",
    "the entire system , i.e.  the sphere and a short piece of chain , was embedded into a cube of @xmath75 side - length with reflective walls . in principle",
    ", the size of the cube should be of no relevance , but it was found that , if chosen too small , effects of the finite step - size were emerging .",
    "the walker started inside the sphere .",
    "each time upon leaving the spherical volume a collision was noted .",
    "if the walker was about to exit the cylindrical volume of the chain , it was reflected back inside with the probability @xmath76 .",
    "the clock was halted as long as the walker moved outside the sphere and only counted time - steps inside the sphere .",
    "since the binding site was embedded into the chain , its effective volume ( eq .  [ eq:65 ] ) was simply @xmath77 , with @xmath78 being the volume of the specific binding site .",
    ".recurrence time ( 3rd column ) inside the spherical binding site ( @xmath79 ) , specific recurrence time eq .",
    "( [ eq:85 ] ) ( 4th column ) , and simulation results for the large system ( @xmath80 , column 5 - 9 ) .",

    "the last column defines the speed - up achieved with the mec approach .",
    "[ tab : ncoll ] [ cols=\">,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     figure [ fig : tauf ] displays the first reaction times @xmath0 as a function of the sliding parameter @xmath60 . both methods ( explicit simulation and mec approach ) deliver identical results within the statistical errors .",
    "the solid curve is a plot of the analytical estimate eq .",
    "( [ eq:95 ] ) , which consistently under - estimates the first reaction time by 5 - 10% but otherwise describes the trends accurately , including the location of the minimum .",
    "the results prove that facilitated diffusion is able to accelerate the reaction considerably .",
    "it is also obvious that a very high affinity of the protein to the chain becomes counter - productive : the walker spends long periods of time trapped within a particular loop of the chain without being able to explore the remaining parts of the cell exhaustively . ideally , the affinity has to be chosen so that the walker is occasionally able to dissociate from the chain and associate again after having passed some time in free diffusion .",
    "the actual value of the ideal affinity depends on the system parameters and is easily estimated using eq .",
    "( [ eq:95 ] ) prior to any simulations .",
    "table [ tab : simu ] contains a summary of the simulation results for various system sizes .",
    "it appears that the speed - up delivered by the mec approach increased proportional to the square of the cell radius , and gained a significant dimension in the largest of our test systems .",
    "whereas a cell as small as @xmath82 was treated within 30 minutes on a pc , including 2000 runs of explicit simulation @xmath16 for 12 different values of the exit probability @xmath31 , the large cell of @xmath80 required more than 5 days for the same set of computations . the mec method reduced that time to less than four hours .",
    "in this work , the method of excess - collisions ( mec ) , recently introduced as a technique to speed up the simulation of intramolecular reactions in polymers , is generalized to second order diffusion controlled reactions , and applied to the problem of facilitated diffusion of site - specific dna - binding proteins .",
    "this method is based on eq .",
    "( [ eq:20 ] ) and ( [ eq:80 ] ) to simulate the much faster back - reaction @xmath83 ( protein starts at the binding site and propagates to the cell - periphery ) instead of @xmath84 .",
    "we have demonstrated how mec led to a speed - up of up to two orders of magnitude , depending on protein - dna affinity ( table [ tab : ncoll ] ) , and gaining significance with increasing cell size ( table [ tab : simu ] ) .",
    "the cell model employed in this work was perhaps the most simple ansatz that was possible without being trivial , and intentionally so .",
    "the simulations had to cover a large range of system sizes in order to verify the efficiency of the mec approach .",
    "the chain - lengths span a factor of 64 from the smallest to the largest system .",
    "nevertheless , the validity of our results does not depend on the complexity of the model , such as protein - dna potential , which modifies the equilibrium constant @xmath32 in eq .",
    "( [ eq:50 ] ) and thereby the sliding parameter @xmath60 ( eq .",
    "[ eq:100 ] ) , hydrodynamic interactions , which would lead to effective diffusion coefficients , also modifying @xmath60 , or the introduction of protein orientation and conformation , acting on the effective target size @xmath26 .",
    "the speed - up is consistently evaluated in terms of simulation steps , not cpu - time , to ensure invariance on the complexity of the underlying protein / dna model .",
    "based on the results presented here , the mec approach can be expected to reduce the numerical effort by orders of magnitude , once more sophisticated ( and time consuming ) simulation techniques are employed to study biochemical reaction times in systems of realistic dimensions ."
