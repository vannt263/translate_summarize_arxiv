    "if a binary star , or a planet revolving around a star , is perturbed by one or more distant relatively slowly moving masses the perturbation can be approximated by a tidal field .",
    "fast computation of secular perturbations in such a potential is thus desirable .",
    "potential applications include the kozai resonance , motion of a well isolated binary in a star cluster and cometary motion under the galactic tidal field .",
    "several authors have considered the computation of cometary motion perturbations due to the galactic tidal field e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "more recently @xcite suggested the use of the time averaged secular perturbing function and the lagrangian equations for computing the evolution of orbital elements of a comet . while @xcite compared various ways to compute the evolution of orbital elements ( using keplerian or delaunay elements ) .",
    "@xcite used the so called vectorial elements , i.e. the areal velocity vector and the eccentricity vector .",
    "however , the perturbing potential considered in all these studies was a simplified one , in most cases just the term causing the force perpendicular to the galactic plane was included .",
    "in this paper we consider a general quadratic potential . for more mathematical generality",
    "we include the possibility of a constant force ( although such a term does not appear in a tidal field ) and also a slow rotation of the quadratic perturbing field is allowed .",
    "we form the simple regular equations of motion using the vectorial elements .",
    "finally it is necessary to stress that the main purpose of this paper is to introduce the simple secular equations of motion when a two - body system is perturbed by a ( at most ) quadratic perturbing potential .",
    "consider a system in which the keplerian motion of a particle around a central mass @xmath0 is perturbed by a perturbing potential @xmath1 .",
    "in addition , a slow rotation ( with angular velocity @xmath2 ) is assumed .",
    "the hamiltonian may be written @xmath3 where @xmath0 is the mass of the central body , @xmath4 is the position vector with components @xmath5 , @xmath6 is the velocity vector with components @xmath7 i.e. @xmath8 ( which also can be identified as the momentum vector ) and @xmath9 is the semi - major axis of the kepler motion . the function @xmath10 is the perturbing function , assumed at most quadratic in the coordinates .",
    "if the time dependence of @xmath10 is due to rotation of the potential with a constant angular velocity , then one can consider the system in the rotating coordinate system in which the perturbing function is a constant .",
    "thus , using the suffix notation , one may write in place of @xmath10 @xmath11 where there is no time dependence , @xmath12 are components of a ( possible ) constant acceleration vector @xmath13 and @xmath14 is the second derivative matrix : @xmath15 the last term in ( [ perturbingfunction ] ) is the scalar product of the angular velocity vector @xmath16 of the perturbing potential and the angular momentum vector of the moving particle , here written using the levi - civita symbol @xmath17 .",
    "since the matrix @xmath14 is symmetric it can be diagonalized by selecting a suitable coordinate system .",
    "however , there may be situations in which this is not convenient .",
    "therefore we consider the general non - diagonal case . in the theory presented here that does not add any substantial complications .",
    "the auxiliary quantities needed in averaging the hamiltonian are :    1 .   the angular momentum vector per unit of mass ( actually areal speed ) of the particle @xmath18 2 .",
    "the eccentricity vector ( also known as the runge - lenz- or laplace vector ) @xmath19 or , for our purposes , the vector @xmath20 is more convenient .",
    "3 .   the mean values of the position vector components @xmath21 4 .",
    "the time averaged coordinate products can be written @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the kronecker @xmath24 .",
    "this result was easy to derive for @xmath25 .",
    "the generalization was then formed by educated guess and use of computer algebra for confirmation .",
    "the secular perturbing function @xmath26 takes the form @xmath27    if one introduces the matrixes @xmath28 and @xmath29 with the elements @xmath30 and the vector @xmath31 @xmath32 then the averaged perturbing function can be written in the simple form @xmath33 where the vectors @xmath31 ,   @xmath2 , and matrices @xmath34 , @xmath35 are constants in any particular orbit .",
    "the reason for the choice of the elements @xmath36 and @xmath37 was that one obtains for their components the simple poisson bracket relations @xmath38 with these formulae one gets the equations of motion ( breiter and ratajczak(2005 ) and references therein ) @xmath39 and by ( [ quadratich ] ) the partial derivatives of @xmath40 with respect to the vectorial elements are @xmath41 where we have used the vector - matrix notation . in deriving the above equations one should note that @xmath36 and @xmath37 are constants of motion under the two - body hamiltonian @xmath42 .",
    "thus @xmath9 can be considered a ( numerical ) constant since @xmath43 .",
    "the equations of motion have the integrals @xmath44 here we must remark that the form of the perturbing function is not unique .",
    "this is because of the larger - than - necessary number of variables and because one may e.g add terms proportional to @xmath45 and/or to @xmath46 which would not affect the final expressions for the derivatives of the elements in ( [ jequation ] ) and ( [ eequation ] ) .",
    "note that when the rotation term @xmath47 is included , the result for the evolution of the vectorial elements will be obtained in the rotating coordinate system .",
    "possible applications of the vectorial element equations include :    1 .   constant force , or rotating constant force .",
    "this may be restricted to toy applications , but was included in our treatment for the sake of generality and because it is mathematically simple .",
    "isolated binary in a star cluster . assuming the perturbing stars are distant and",
    "move relatively slowly , one may approximate the perturbing potential by @xmath48 where @xmath49 are the positions of the perturbers relative to the centre - of - mass of the binary .",
    "writing @xmath50 we get for the components of the matrix @xmath51 @xmath52 where the matrix elements may be time dependent , but this does not invalidate the equations presented above .",
    "3 .   kozai resonance .",
    "this term is often used in connection of triple systems in which averaging over the outer orbit gives the perturbing potential of the form @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the mass of the third body , @xmath55 is the semi - minor axis of the outer ellipse and @xmath56 is the unit normal vector of the orbital plane of the distant body . in this case",
    "we have @xmath57 where @xmath58 are the components of the vector @xmath56 .",
    "cometary motion under the galactic tide . in this case",
    "the tidal potential is usually written @xmath59 which is possible by choosing the coordinate system such that @xmath60 axis is perpendicular to the galactic plane and the @xmath61-axis points to the galactic centre .",
    "5 .   the perturbing potential due to a small disk of mass",
    "can also be expressed easily in terms of the vectorial elements , although not in quadratic form . the secular perturbing function for this case",
    "is often written in terms of the delaunay elements in the form @xmath62 where @xmath63 is a ( small ) constant and @xmath64 are the delaunay elements . here",
    "@xmath65 is a constant , @xmath66 and @xmath67 , where @xmath56 is the unit direction vector of the symmetry axis of the potential .",
    "thus @xmath68 consequently it is easy to include the effect of any such potential into the equations of motion for the vectorial elements .",
    "note that this kind of a term could be used to approximate the effect of the planets ( averaged over orbits ) to comets that come close , but not too close , to the solar system .",
    "we ran some numerical test computations and compared results against direct numerical integration of the equations of motion for the coordinates .",
    "the tests used the tidal field of the galaxy in the form @xmath69 ( parameters from @xcite ) and a value for the semi - major - axis of an oort cloud comet of @xmath70au .",
    "the experiments suggest :    if one needs results for a long time and infrequent output is allowed , then one of the best numerical integrators available is the burlirsh - stoer method ( actually the code known as @xmath71 , originally written by burlirsh ) . however , this is efficient only when run with optimally long steps , which may be too long for some applications .",
    "if one needs frequent output , then the method of choice is the implicit midpoint method .",
    "it is very simple to implement and gives quite high precision , especially it conserves the quadratic integrals of motion ( @xcite , @xcite ) .    in this case one",
    "finds that the stepsize equal to one period ( i.e. @xmath72 years ) gives a clearly satisfactory accuracy : the plots of the vectorial elements from both computations ( secular and coordinate integration ) agree well , except for a small phase error .",
    "however , for @xmath73au the results differ and the reliability of a secular theory becomes questionable .",
    "we have generalized the equations of @xcite who considered the simple case of perturbing function of the form @xmath74 .",
