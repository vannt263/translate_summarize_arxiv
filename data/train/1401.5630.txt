    "the long standing problem in nebular physics related to the abundance and temperature discrepancy between the results obtained from optical recombination lines ( orl ) and collisionally excited lines ( cel ) has been visited by many researchers in the last few decades .",
    "several explanations for the general trend of obtaining higher abundances and lower temperatures from orl than from cel of the same ions have been put forward .",
    "one explanation is a multi - component model of planetary nebulae in which low temperature , high metallicity components ( clumps ) produce the orl and are embedded in a high temperature , relatively low metallicity , hydrogen - rich component that produces the cel @xcite .",
    "it has been suggested recently @xcite that this discrepancy may be largely explained by the assumption of a different electron energy distribution , a @xmath0-distribution , rather than the maxwell - boltzmann  ( mb ) distribution which is traditionally accepted as the dominant distribution in the low density plasma found in the planetary nebulae .    the debate about the electron energy distribution in astronomical objects , including planetary nebulae , is relatively old and dates back to at least the 1940s when hagihara @xcite suggested that the distribution of free electrons in gaseous assemblies deviates considerably from the mb distribution .",
    "this was refuted by @xcite who , on the basis of a detailed quantitative balance analysis , concluded that any deviation from the maxwellian equilibrium distribution is very small .",
    "the essence of their argument is that for typical planetary nebulae conditions , the thermalization process of elastic collisions is by far the most frequent event and typically occurs once every second , while other processes that shift the system from its thermodynamic equilibrium , like inelastic scattering with other ions that leads to metastable excitation or recapture , occur at much larger time scales estimated to be months or even years . bohm and aller also indicated the significance of any possible deviation from a maxwellian distribution on derived elemental abundances .",
    "however , nobody seems to have considered non - mb electron distributions as a possible solution for the orl / cel discrepancy problem until the recent proposal of @xcite . in the light of this suggestion",
    ", it seems appropriate to ask whether there is any empirical evidence from observation for departures from mb energy distributions in nebulae .",
    "a preliminary investigation of this possibility has been given recently by @xcite and @xcite who proposed a method based on using atomic dielectronic recombination ( dr ) theoretical data in conjunction with observational line fluxes to sample the free electron distribution and compare to the theoretical distributions , i.e. maxwell - boltzmann  and @xmath0 .",
    "for all the objects studied by @xcite the limited observational data analyzed were found to be better described by a single mb distribution than a @xmath0-distribution but the uncertainties were sufficient that a @xmath0-distribution could not be conclusively excluded .",
    "a two - component model incorporating low temperature material was also found to not fit the data as well as a single mb model .    the current paper approaches this problem by modeling the magnitude of the balmer discontinuity and nearby balmer continuum of the planetary nebula hf  2 - 2 .",
    "this nebula is an extreme example of the orl / cel discrepancy trend since its abundance discrepancy factor ( adf ) , defined as the ratio of orl abundance to cel abundance , reaches an exceptionally high value between 68 - 84 @xcite .",
    "an exceptionally high temperature discrepancy between the cel and orl results , which differ by about an order of magnitude , has also been obtained for this nebula .",
    "the shape of the balmer continuum is principally determined by a convolution of the @xmath2 hydrogen recombination cross - section and the free electron energy distribution .",
    "the shape of the continuum therefore offers the possibility of gaining information about the free electron energy distribution .",
    "we shall see below that in the case of hf  2 - 2  the continuum shape is primarily determined by the free electron energy distribution . in section",
    "[ hf2 - 2 ] we outline the properties of hf  2 - 2  and in section  [ theory ] we deal with the theory describing the continuum processes and new results relating to recombination using a @xmath0-distribution .",
    "the fitting procedure and the resulting fits to the spectral data with mb and @xmath0 distributions are described in section  [ method ] and our conclusions in section  [ conclusions ] .",
    "hf  2 - 2  is a faint southern highly symmetric low density planetary nebula with a central cavity and interior disc - shaped multi - shell structure .",
    "its spectrum includes carbon , nitrogen , oxygen , neon , sulphur and argon lines as well as helium .",
    "hf  2 - 2  seems to have a high abundance in he and c with a high c / o ratio and an exceptionally strong c  ii  @xmath34267    signature .",
    "the nebula , which is in the galactic bulge at a distance of about 4.0 - 4.5  kpc , has a spectrally - varying close binary central system with a period of about 0.40  day @xcite .",
    "hf  2 - 2  has common spectral features with old novae like dq  her @xcite , and therefore being a planetary nebula may be disputed .",
    "this unusual nebula is marked by a number of exceptional features .",
    "hf  2 - 2  exhibits a very high adf , possibly the highest recorded for a planetary nebula , with very strong orl emission . hf  2 - 2  also has the very large c / o abundance ratio of about 19 @xcite .",
    "a third unusual feature is a very large balmer jump associated with a rapid fall in the balmer continuum intensity towards shorter wavelengths .",
    "an estimation based on the magnitude of the balmer discontinuity indicates an electron temperature of about 780 - 1000  k in sharp contrast to the forbidden lines estimation of about 8800  k from an [ o  iii ] line @xcite .",
    "the deduced balmer discontinuity temperature is one of the lowest observed for a planetary nebula .",
    "these findings led @xcite to conclude that a multi - component model of cold hydrogen - deficient knots embedded into a metal - poor nebula may be inevitable to explain these exceptional observations .",
    "with regard to orl electron temperature derivations for hf  2 - 2 , @xcite obtained a mean electron temperature of @xmath4  k from c  ii  lines , while @xcite derived an electron temperature of about 630  k and @xcite a temperature of about 3160  k from o  iilines .",
    "as for the stellar temperature of this nebula , it is estimated by @xcite between 5000067000  k , while @xcite set the temperature of the two stars ( assuming a binary system which seems to be largely accepted ) in their model to 67000  k and 7500  k.    the observational data of hf  2 - 2  which is used in the present paper were obtained in 2001 by a boller and chivens long - slit spectrograph mounted on the ground - based 1.52  m european southern observatory telescope located in la silla chile .",
    "more details about this data set can be found in @xcite .",
    "the observed spectrum is shown in figure  [ contfitseg ] , with the measured flux normalized to balmer h11 , an apparently unblended line close to the balmer discontinuity .",
    "k ( dashed ) .",
    "the fit was optimized on the two longer wavelength of the three wavelength segments ( shown in the figure as horizontal lines ) : 3585 - 3645 , 3780 - 3790 and 4180 - 4230   . ]",
    "to model the magnitude of the balmer discontinuity and the shape of the balmer continuum we consider the contributions to the continuum spectrum from recombination of h@xmath5 and he@xmath5 , h 2-photon emission and the underlying scattered stellar continuum .",
    "recombination of he@xmath6 is neglected due to the very low he@xmath6/h@xmath5 fraction in hf  2 - 2  which is estimated to be about 0.002 @xcite .",
    "the recombination of an atomic ion @xmath7 with an electron , @xmath8 of energy @xmath9 to a state @xmath10 of the recombined ion , @xmath11 gives rise to continuous emission with emission coefficient ( energy emitted per unit time per unit frequency and per unit particle densities ) @xmath12 where , @xmath13 is the frequency of the emitted photon , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the statistical weights of the initial and final states respectively , @xmath16 is the free electron energy distribution function , @xmath17 is the photoionization cross - section for the inverse process of equation  [ genrecomb ] and @xmath18 is the rydberg energy constant .",
    "the other symbols have their usual meanings . in the present paper , the photoionization cross - sections for states of h and he are taken from @xcite and @xcite",
    "respectively as described in more detail by @xcite .    in this paper we consider two possible forms for @xmath16 , the maxwell - boltzmann distribution @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the electron temperature , and the @xmath0-distribution @xcite given by    @xmath21 where @xmath0 is a parameter defining the distribution , @xmath22 is the gamma - function for the given arguments , and @xmath23 is a characteristic temperature .",
    "note that @xmath24 becomes a mb distribution with @xmath25 as @xmath26 .",
    "the normalization of the continuum flux to h11 flux requires that the effective recombination coefficients for h11 should be calculated both with a maxwell - boltzmann distribution and a @xmath0-distribution .",
    "the hydrogen line emissivities tabulated by @xcite and @xcite were calculated assuming that the free electron energy distribution is described by a maxwell - boltzmann distribution for all physical processes between bound and continuum states involving free electrons .",
    "here we use the techniques and computer codes described in the last two references and extend them to include a @xmath0-distribution . at the electron number densities typical of photoionized nebulae ( @xmath27  @xmath28 )",
    "the populations of the low - lying states of h are determined primarily by recombination and radiative cascading and are relatively insensitive to the ambient electron density .",
    "hence any error introduced into the calculation of collision rates between high-@xmath29 states caused by the use of a maxwell - boltzmann distribution rather than a @xmath0-distribution should have minimal effect at nebular densities .",
    "we therefore make the approximation of computing the direct recombination coefficients to all the individual levels using a @xmath0-distribution but retain a maxwell - boltzmann distribution for the energy and angular momentum changing collisions among the higher-@xmath29 states .",
    "this should provide a good approximation for the h11 emissivity .",
    "for a general free electron energy distribution , the recombination coefficient to a state x@xmath30 is given by    @xmath31    on solving the collisional - radiative recombination problem for hydrogen we obtain the recombination coefficients to all levels and the effective recombination coefficients @xmath32 for a transition of wavelength @xmath3 .",
    "we define a line emission coefficient @xmath33 as the energy emitted per unit volume per unit time for unit ion and electron density , so that @xmath34    @xcite derive the following approximate expression for converting recombination coefficients calculated with a maxwell - boltzmann electron energy distribution to those applicable with a @xmath0-distribution , @xmath35 to obtain this result , @xcite use the fact that the photoionization cross - section falls approximately as @xmath36 for @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the threshold frequency for photoionization . so that the integrand in equation  [ alphaeq ] contains a @xmath39 term .",
    "@xcite simplify the integral by moving the @xmath39 term outside of the integral , making it possible to carry out the integration analytically . in practice",
    "the integral is a convolution of the free - electron energy distribution with the @xmath39 term , which is energy dependent . at low temperatures",
    "the rapid fall in the electron energy distribution function with increasing energy means that it is a good approximation to neglect the energy dependence of the frequency term . at higher temperatures , both terms are essential in the calculation of the recombination coefficient .",
    "the expression for @xmath40 in equation  [ mbkappa ] is independent of temperature , density and transition .",
    "this approximation will fail at sufficiently high temperatures where the effects of the free - electron energy distribution and the frequency dependent term become comparable .    using the approximate function @xmath40 , we can express the results of our more complete collisional - radiative treatment for @xmath33 in terms of a correction factor @xmath41 as follows    @xmath42    the values of @xmath43 can be obtained from @xcite and @xcite . in table  [ h11mbkappa ] we tabulate values of @xmath41 for h11 corresponding to various values of @xmath0 at a range of temperatures .",
    "we also tabulate in the last line @xmath44 as a function of @xmath0 .",
    "note that , in principle , @xmath45 also depends on electron density but in practice it is very insensitive to electron density for densities up to @xmath46  @xmath28 , so we only tabulate values calculated at @xmath47  @xmath28 .",
    ".values of the correction factor @xmath41 , defined in equation  [ epseq ] , as a function of @xmath0 and logt[k ] for computing the emission coefficient , @xmath48 for h11 . in the last row of the table @xmath44 , as defined in equation [ mbkappa ] , is given as a function of @xmath0 .",

    "< , < \" , ]      it is clear from figure  [ contfitseg ] that the magnitude of the balmer discontinuity and the slope of the balmer continuum shortward of the discontinuity can not be explained by emission from hydrogen and helium at the forbidden line temperature",
    ". this has already been discussed by @xcite who estimated that the shape of the continuum implies that the emitting region has a temperature of @xmath49  k. in figure  [ singlefreemb ] we show the result of making a fit to all three spectral segments shown in figure  [ contfitseg ] using a single mb electron energy distribution in which the temperature is a free parameter .",
    "the background continuum is computed using the parameters from fit ( a ) in table  [ confit ] .",
    "the temperature of best fit is 1334  k and although the continuum model is improved compared to figure  [ contfitseg ] , it matches neither the magnitude of the discontinuity nor the slope adequately .",
    "k. ]    as discussed earlier , one resolution of the orl / cel abundance and temperature discrepancy in nebulae that has been proposed is that there are relatively cold high - metallicity knots embedded in hotter lower abundance gas .",
    "we therefore attempt to match the continuum with two components having different temperatures .",
    "we set the temperature of one component equal to a typical forbidden line temperature for this object of 8800  k and allow the other to vary .",
    "the continuum emissivity has only weak density dependence so we choose representative electron densities for the two components of 1000  @xmath28 for the forbidden line region and 5000  @xmath28 for the cold material @xcite .",
    "the relative emission measure of the two components is then allowed to vary by making the volume ratio of the two components a free parameter . in figure  [ 2mb1free ]",
    "we show the resulting fit , which is excellent .",
    "the optimum temperature of the cold component is 540  k and the fraction of the total volume occupied by the cold component is 0.00706 .",
    "hence the cold component has an emission measure , which is proportional to the product of the volume fraction and particle density squared , that is 15.0% of the total recombination line and continuum emission measure .",
    "k and the other is free to vary .",
    "the ratio of the volumes of the two components is also treated as a free parameter . ]",
    "an alternative possible resolution of the orl / cel problem is that there is no separation of the emitting material into high and low temperature components with significantly different abundances but rather a single medium in which the electron energy distribution is non - maxwellian , with a @xmath0-distribution being a possible candidate .",
    "the balmer continuum close to the balmer discontinuity provides a means of testing the validity of this proposal for the very low energy part of the distribution function . in figures  [ t100003kappa ] and [ t10003kappa ]",
    "we illustrate how the magnitude of the balmer discontinuity and shape of the balmer continuum change as @xmath0 is varied for two different temperatures .",
    "compared to a mb , @xmath0-distributions have more particles at the lowest and highest energies and less at intermediate energies . at low energies",
    "the @xmath0-distribution function thus falls more rapidly with increasing energy than a mb distribution .",
    "this can be seen in figure  [ t10003kappa ] , for example , with the magnitude of the balmer discontinuity increasing and the slope of the balmer continuum becoming steeper as @xmath0 decreases .",

    "we now fit the chosen three spectral segments to a @xmath0-distribution of which the temperature and value of @xmath0 are free parameters and the final values that we obtained for these parameters are @xmath55 and @xmath56  k. figure  [ 1kappa ] shows a plot of this fit . on visual inspection",
    "the best - fit @xmath0 distribution where @xmath0 and temperature are allowed to vary is significantly less good than the two - component mb fit .",
    "it should be remarked that the optimized @xmath0 obtained from this fitting exercise is very different to values proposed by @xcite which usually fall in the range 10 - 20 . for comparison , we include in figure  [ 1kappa ] a fit carried out with a fixed value of @xmath57 .",

    "we wish to address the question of whether the fit to the continuum using a @xmath0-distribution is significantly worse than the two - component mb fit .",
    "a visual inspection of figures  [ 2mb1free ] and [ 1kappa ] shows that while the - two - component fit provides a very good match to the three segments of the continuum used for fitting , the best @xmath0-distribution fit underestimates the magnitude of the balmer discontinuity and also underestimates the steepness of the decline at shorter wavelengths .",
    "we will use a comparison of @xmath1 values for these two fits to quantify the relative goodness of fit . to estimate @xmath1",
    "we need an estimate of the uncertainties on the observational data , which by inspection and from instrumental considerations are not independent of wavelength , being much larger at the shortest wavelengths .",
    "we therefore compute separate rms deviations of the data from the two - component mb fit for each of the three wavelength segments . since we use deviations from the two - component fit to define the data uncertainties it follows that the value of @xmath1 for the fit , summed over the three wavelength segments , will be given by @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the number of degrees of freedom , @xmath61 is the number of data points in the three segments and @xmath62 is the number of free parameters .",
    "we now use the estimates of the data uncertainties from the two - component mb fit to compute @xmath1 for the best fit @xmath0-distribution and we find @xmath63 .",
    "we wish to test the null hypothesis that the @xmath0-distribution is an equally good fit to the data as the two - component mb fit .",
    "the following square - root transformation of @xmath1 @xcite ,    @xmath64    is such that for large @xmath60 , the transformed distribution is approximately normal with zero mean and unit standard deviation . for the best fit @xmath0-distribution",
    "we find that @xmath65 standard deviations from the zero mean , indicating that the probability that the null hypothesis is true is vanishingly small .",
    "thus , a two - component maxwell - boltzmann  model is highly favored compared to the single - component @xmath0 model .",
    "the single - component mb model is even less likely to be correct than either of the two - parameter models based on the same @xmath1 analysis , giving @xmath66 standard deviations .",
    "the analysis of the balmer continuum spectrum of hf  2 - 2  seems to indicate the signature of a two - component nebula with two different temperatures . assuming that one component has a temperature of 8800  k , we find that the best fit to the data is obtained by adding a second component with temperature of 540  k and emission measure 15.0% of the total .",
    "we also modeled the continuum with a single component with @xmath0-distributed free electron energies , but on the basis of a @xmath1 test we found this model to be significantly less likely to be correct . in the case of @xmath0-distribution models , it is important to note that modeling the balmer continuum only samples the free electron energy distribution at the lowest energies , below the mean energy , and therefore gives no information about departures from mb at energies above the mean energy which might affect the excitation of nebular forbidden lines , for example .",
    "the extreme nature of hf  2 - 2  and the similarity of some of its spectral features to old novae like dq  her may also cast some doubt on the applicability of the conclusions reached to the properties of planetary nebulae in general .",
    "the work of pjs was supported in part by stfc ( grant st / j000892/1 ) . during the final stages of writing this paper ,",
