    "presently the hydrodynamical approach is known as one of basic tools for the description of the collective aspects of the relativistic heavy - ion collisions .",
    "however , instead of extensive analyses of experimental data based on this approach @xcite , the study of the effect of dissipation is yet poorly explored @xcite .",
    "till now , two basically different approaches to describe relativistic dissipative hydrodynamics are commonly employed ; one is the relativistic extension of navier - stokes theory introduced by landau - lifshitz ( ll ) @xcite and eckart @xcite , and the other is the causal dissipative ( cd ) hydrodynamics or second order theory , where the version due to israel - stewart @xcite is most popularly known .",
    "the relativistic navier - stokes theory ( ns ) is usually considered in the literature as a natural covariant generalization of the navier - stokes equation and in contrast to cd hydrodynamics , it is also refereed to as the first order theory .",
    "authors who applies the first order theory argue that the second order theory is not yet completely established and the difference of two approaches would be not significant , since the effect of viscosity is the measure of the deviation from the local thermodynamical equilibrium , and should be small where the hydrodynamical approach is meaningful . however , a crucial point of the reason why the second order approach should be explored is that the propagation speed in the first order theory is infinite and it does not satisfy the relativistic causality .",
    "it is also known that the first order theory leads to dynamical instabilities .",
    "these aspects are not only the question of conceptions but also related to serious practical problems and deserve a more detailed analysis .    one way to solve the problem of acausality in a first order theory is introduce , for example , a memory effect with a finite relaxation time @xcite .",
    "in this way , we can derive a cd hydrodynamics from the ll theory .",
    "there are several different approaches to derive the cd hydrodynamics @xcite . in this work",
    ", we consider the israel - stewart type cd hydrodynamics .",
    "a crucial point is whether a relativistic dissipative hydrodynamics is stable or not .",
    "if a theory is unstable , it will be very difficult to extract any physically meaningful results from it .",
    "the analysis of the stability of relativistic dissipative hydrodynamics has been extensively studied by hiscock and his collaborators @xcite .",
    "their conclusions are summarized as follows .",
    "1 ) the eckart theory is unstable for the linear perturbation around the hydrostatic states whereas the ll theory and the is theory ( of the landau frame ) are stable @xcite .",
    "2 ) the ll theory is shown to be unstable for the linear perturbation around hydrostatic states in a general frame where the fluid is lorentz boosted @xcite .",
    "another important analysis was implemented by kouno et al @xcite .",
    "they discussed the linear perturbation around the scaling solution of the ll theory and found that the scaling solution of the ll theory can be unstable .",
    "a similar discussion is repeated by @xcite using another equation of state .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to complement these discussions",
    ". we will , in particular , focus on two subjects .",
    "one is the relation between causality and stability . in general , the concept of causality and stability are independent , but in relativistic systems , as we will see , they are closely related . to show this",
    ", we discuss the stability from lorentz boosted frames and show that instability is induced because of acausality .",
    "the other is the stability around the scaling solution in the cd hydrodynamics . in the ll theory ,",
    "the scaling solution can be unstable , although it is always stable when the reynolds number is larger than one .",
    "the stability around the scaling solution has not yet been discussed in the cd hydrodynamics .",
    "the applicability of the scaling ansatz is not obvious in the cd hydrodynamics , because , as we will see later , the numerical calculation of the cd hydrodynamics shows a kind of non - periodic oscillations in the central rapidity region .    in this paper , we restrict ourselves to the discussion on 1 + 1 dimensional motion of massless ideal gas ( to be specific , an ideal three flavor massless qgp gas ) , for simplicity .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ chap:2 ]",
    ", we discuss the stability and causality around the hydrostatic states .",
    "the result of this section has already been shown in @xcite . to establish the relation between causality and stability",
    ", we discuss the stability of the hydrostatic state from lorentz boosted frames in section [ chap:3 ] . in section [ chap:4 ] ,",
    "the stability around the scaling solution is discussed .",
    "section [ chap:5 ] is devoted to concluding remarks .",
    "before discussing the relation between causality and stability , we will discuss first the stability near the hydrostatic state following his2,his3,dkkm2 .    in the cd hydrodynamics of 1 + 1 dimensional systems ,",

    "the parameters @xmath14 and @xmath15 characterize respectively the magnitudes of the viscosity and the relaxation time footnote1 . as we will see later , the parameter @xmath15 should be smaller than @xmath16 to be consistent with causality @xcite .",

    "the stability of the theories are summarized in the above table . around the hydrostatic state , the ll theory and",
    "the cd hydrodynamics are stable . however ,",
    "when we move to a lorentz boosted frame , the acausal theories like the ll theory and the cd hydrodynamics with acausal parameter set become unstable .",
    "the second line shows that causality and stability are intimately correlated in relativistic dissipative hydrodynamics .",
    "the stability of a theory should not depend on the choice of frames . in this sense , the ll theory and the cd hydrodynamics with acausal parameter sets",
    "are inconsistent .",
    "the stability of the scaling solution was analyzed by using the lyapunov direct method . in the ll theory",
    ", it is known that the scaling solution is stable against homogeneous and inhomogeneous perturbations when we use initial conditions which satisfies @xmath110 @xcite . in the cd hydrodynamics",
    ", we found that the scaling solution can not be stable even for @xmath143 .",
    "for the homogeneous perturbation ( @xmath96 ) , we confirmed that most parts of the trajectories of the scaling solutions pass the stable region in the phase diagram , which was plotted in terms of @xmath123 and @xmath144 .",
    "thus , the scaling solution will be stable for the homogeneous perturbation .",
    "however , as the @xmath37 increases , the confirmed stable region in the phase diagram shrinks and the trajectories of the scaling solutions start to penetrate the unconfirmed region .",
    "when the unconfirmed regions are real unstable regions , it means that the scaling solution is unstable for inhomogeneous perturbations .",
    "this instability is distinguished for larger bulk viscosity because the trajectory with larger viscosity is easier to penetrate the unstable region .    above conclusion",
    "may be supported by the numerical calculations . as a matter of fact",
    ", we found that the numerical calculations of the 1 + 1 dimensional cd hydrodynamics becomes unstable as the bulk viscosity coefficient increases and a kind of non - periodic oscillations appears in the central rapidity region . to see the quantitative signature of the oscillations",
    ", we have to investigate various cases with different parameters and initial conditions.this oscillation may be interpreted as turbulence because the instability of the scaling solution indicates chaos which acts as the trigger of turbulence .",
    "however , in this work , we could not confirm the unstable region on the phase diagram . to see the appearance of turbulence , we need more systematic study of the instability around the scaling solution beyond the lyapunov direct method .",
    "this is a challenge for the future",
    ".    when we discuss the shear viscosity , we have to find the parameters which is consisitent with causality as was discussed in this paper .",
    "this is also a future task .",
    "t. koide acknowledges helpful discussions and comments with h. kouno , i. mishustin , f. takagi and g. torrieri .",
    "this work is supported by cnpq and faperj .",
    "the propagation speed of the fluid has been discussed based on the linear analysis , and hence the effect of nonlinearity is ignored . in this section , following the discussion of @xcite , we derive the effect of the nonlinearity in the propagation speed .    for the simple 1 + 1 dimensional system ,",
    "the hydrodynamic equations are summarized as follows ; @xmath145 where @xmath146 and @xmath147 @xmath148 @xmath149 here , @xmath150 is the effective enthalpy density , @xmath151 .",
    "the characteristic speed @xmath152 is given by @xmath153 the speed is easily estimated in the local rest frame , @xmath154 .",
    "then we have the following three solutions , @xmath155 one can easily see that if @xmath156 is small and we can replace @xmath150 with @xmath157 , this result is same as eq .",
    "( [ eqn : lk ] ) .",
    "we consider the case of the effective enthalpy density is positive .",
    "then , to satisfy causality , the transport coefficients should satisfy the following condition , @xmath158 this is , again , the generalization of the restriction for the transport coefficients discussed below eq .",
    "( [ eqn : def - tau ] ) .",
    "in section [ chap : move ] , the stability from a lorentz boosted frame was discussed .",
    "a similar problem was discussed by hiscock and lindblam his3 . in this appendix",
    ", we apply their discussion to the cd hydrodynamics .",
    "they consider the transformation of the coordinate by using the following replacement of the variables , @xmath159 where @xmath33 and @xmath37 are variables in the rest frame , and @xmath160 and @xmath161 are in the new frame , which moves with the velocity @xmath152 . substituting into the result obtained in the rest frame ( [ eqn : disp ] ) , we have @xmath162 we can easily solve the equation for @xmath163 , @xmath164 the imaginary part is positive and hence the theory is still stable .    on the other hand , in the ll theory ,",
    "the solutions are given by @xmath165 thus , the ll theory is unstable again .",
    "here , we summarize the stability analysis based on the lyapunov function . as an example , let us consider the damped harmonic oscillator , @xmath166 the solution of the equation converges to @xmath167 .    to discuss the stability around the equilibrium solution @xmath168 , we introduce a function which characterizes the deviation from the equilibrium .",
    "for example , we choose @xmath169 this is positive definite and if this function monotonically decreases with time , the system is stable and the function @xmath55 is called the lyapunov function .",
    "the time evolution of the function @xmath55 is given by @xmath170 where @xmath171 the eigen values of the matrix @xmath172 are given by @xmath173 one can see that when @xmath174 , @xmath55 is a monotonically decreasing function in time .",
    "thus @xmath55 is the lyapunov function and the equilibrium state is stable .",
    "however , if we use @xmath175 , the function generally have a positive and negative eigen values .",
    "thus we can not determine the stability of the equilibrium solution . in this sense",
    ", the lyapunov direct method usually underestimates the stability of the system .",
    "similarly , when we find that the minimum eigen value is positive and hence @xmath55 is a monotonically increasing function , the equilibrium solution is unstable .",
    "instead of eq .",
    "( [ eqn : x ] ) , we introduce the following vector , @xmath177 then , the lyapunov function is given by @xmath178 then the evolution equation of the lyapunov function is @xmath179 where @xmath180      99 see for example , hama y , kodama t and socolowski jr o 2005 braz",
