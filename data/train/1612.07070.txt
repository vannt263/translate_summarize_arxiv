    "network science @xcite has emerged in the last decades as a transverse interpretative framework for understanding the structure and function of a wide range of complex systems , as well as the dynamic phenomena that takes place on them , ranging from financial crises and traffic congestion to epidemic and social influence spreading @xcite .    in the realm of dynamical systems",
    "@xcite , network techniques have been applied to the analysis of nonlinear time series , with a particular focus on characterizing chaotic dynamics @xcite .",
    "the main idea of this methodology is to project the information of a time series into the topology of a network .",
    "the key element of this approach resides in the identification of nodes and links in the network from the time series information .",
    "several alternatives have been proposed in this context @xcite .",
    "thus , zhang and small  @xcite consider cycles of a pseudo - periodic time series as the nodes of a network , which are connected by links depending on the similarity between cycles .",
    "lacasa _ at al . _",
    "@xcite , on the other hand , build on the concept of _ visibility graphs _",
    ", where nodes correspond to series data points and two nodes are connected if a straight line can be established between them without intersection with any intermediate data height .",
    "another general approach is based on encoding topological information from the reconstructed phase space of a time series into a _ proximity network_. in these networks , nodes represent segments of time series or vectors in the related reconstructed phase space , and links depend on a specific criterion determining adjacency in phase space .",
    "cycle networks @xcite , correlation networks @xcite , and recurrence networks @xcite are typical examples of proximity networks . finally , the related class of _ transition networks _ @xcite encompasses different models for mapping time series into networks , in which the values on the time signal are mapped into a finite number of states ( regions in the phase space of the series ) , representing the nodes , which are connected if the signal transits from one state to another .",
    "this transformation procedure preserves the temporal information of the dynamics in the network , is stable to noise affecting real time series and can account for the fundamental structure of the related attractors @xcite .    using this kind of network projections ,",
    "several aspects of dynamical systems have been cast in terms of topological network properties . here",
    "we will focus in particular on the effects that the _ fractal _ and _ multifractal _ properties of a time signal have on the topology of representative classes of projected network .",
    "many time signal , particularly those arising from a chaotic or strange attractor @xcite , have a fractal structure , characterized by a statistically self - similar pattern in phase space .",
    "moreover , they can also show multifractal properties , described by a strongly heterogeneous probability of visiting different neighborhoods in the phase space @xcite . using as a simple example a transition network representation @xcite , framed within a box counting formalism @xcite in which each box corresponds to a vertex",
    ", we find analytic expressions tying the visitation probability of a box with its associated degree . from these relations",
    "we obtain the conditions under which a projected network grows with a scale - free topology @xcite , characterized by a degree distribution of the form @xmath0 .",
    "our results highlight the correspondence between an attractor s structure and the topology of the associated projected network , and relate the possible origin of a heterogeneous scale - free topology with the heterogeneous and hierarchical visitation probability characterizing multifractal attractors .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : mult - time - sign ] we briefly summarize the multifractal formalism for chaotic time series and attractors . in sec .",
    "[ sec : nework - mapping ] we present a transition network mapping for general time series , based on the box - counting algorithm @xcite . in sec .",
    "[ sec : topol - prop - proj ] we relate the topological properties of the associated networks with the multifractal properties of the original time series .",
    "this relation is directly mediated by the natural measure of the series , defined as the probability that the time sequence visits a given box in a partition of the substrate of the series .",
    "numerical checks of our theoretical predictions are detailed in sec .",
    "[ sec : numer - exper ] . finally , we present our conclusions in sec .  [",
    "sec : discussion ] .",
    "for time signals arising from strange ( chaotic ) attractors , it is common that different regions of the phase space are differently visited , and chaotic orbits spend most of their time in a small region of the support underneath the chaotic attractor itself .",
    "this heterogeneity is at the basis of the so - called multifractal structure of the strange attractor , which can be mathematically captured by the formalism presented below @xcite .",
    "let us consider a real time signal , or a @xmath1-dimensional chaotic attractor , given by the normalized sequence of points @xmath2^d , t= 1 , 2 ,    \\ldots n \\right \\}$ ] , where the index @xmath3 represents either time or the order in the sequence of points that generate the attractor ( e.g. the index of the iteration in an iterated map ) , while @xmath4 is the number of points in the signal .",
    "we consider a partition of the set @xmath5^d$ ] in @xmath6 boxes of length @xmath7 .",
    "box are labeled by the indexes @xmath8 , with @xmath9 .",
    "let us associate to each point @xmath10 in the sequence an integer index @xmath11 in the range @xmath12 , where @xmath13 , and @xmath14 is the floor function .",
    "in this sense , the signal or attractor can be interpreted as visiting the @xmath15-th box in the partition at time @xmath3 . in heterogeneous fractals ,",
    "not all the boxes will be equally visited .",
    "in general , during the @xmath16 steps of the signal , the @xmath8-th box will be visited a number of times @xmath17 , and the total number of boxes visited at least once will be @xmath18 .",
    "this quantity coincides with the number of boxes of length @xmath19 needed to cover the fractal set , and thus we can define the box or capacity dimension of the attractor @xcite , @xmath20 , by the relation @xmath21    let us define the probability @xmath22 , termed the _ natural measure _ , as the probability that the chaotic map visits the @xmath8-th box of the @xmath18 available during an infinitely long orbit . for an homogeneous structure in @xmath1 dimensions , @xmath23 , while in the case of a uniform fractal of dimension @xmath24 , @xmath25 . in more complex situations , however ,",
    "the attractor exhibits a non - uniform fractal distribution , and we assume a general form for the natural measure @xmath26 , where the exponent @xmath27 , taking values in the interval @xmath28 $ ] , measures the strength of the local singularity of the measure at box @xmath8 . in general , there will be many boxes with the same value of @xmath29 , such that their number scales as @xmath30 .",
    "the function @xmath31 , called the multifractal spectrum of the measure , defines the fractal dimension of the set of boxes with the given value @xmath29 , and is in general a convex function with a single maximum .",

    "in order to construct a transition network representation , we follow the approach in refs .",
    "@xcite , and associate a ( virtual ) vertex to each box @xmath9 in the partition of the chaotic attractor in phase space .",
    "actual vertices in the network are given by the set of boxes that have been visited at least once by the signal , with a size @xmath18 .",
    "edges in the network are established by associating an undirected connection between vertices @xmath8 and @xmath43 whenever the signal jumps between boxes @xmath8 and @xmath43 in two consecutive time steps , i.e. @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "the resulting projected networks , which are characterized by the coarse - grained scale @xmath19 , are connected by construction , and preserve temporal information of the generator of the signal . a completely random , stochastic signal will lead to a fully connected network ;",
    "on the other hand , for a limit cycle or periodic attractor , the projected network will be ring , with a number of nodes equal to the period of the cycle .",
    "the former case corresponds to @xmath46 , and the latter to @xmath47 .",
    "in the case of a multifractal time series , the topology of the associated transition network described above can be related to the generalized dimensions @xmath32 .",
    "we will consider in particular the degree distribution @xmath48 of a projected network with a coarse - graining level @xmath19 , defined as the probability that a randomly chosen node has degree @xmath49 , i.e. , it is connected to @xmath49 other nodes . to make explicit this relation , we observe that every node ( box ) @xmath8 , will be characterized by a number of visits @xmath17 and a degree @xmath50 . in the limit @xmath51",
    ", we assume that the relative number of visits , i.e. the natural measure @xmath52 , and the degree of a node are stable quantities .",
    "the corresponding degree distribution will thus depend only on the phase space discretization @xmath19 . on average , the two quantities @xmath52 and @xmath50 will be related , since obviously the more times a box is visited , the larger is expected to be the degree of the associated node .",

    "this observation allows to extract conclusions on the functional form of the degree distribution , which will depend on the particular growth law @xmath64 .",
    "we will consider analytically tractable forms in the following section . to avoid complications in the development",

    "we have focused on the prototypical and general cases of an exponential and an algebraic growth @xmath64 , showing that the latter results in power law degree distributions whose exponent @xmath110 is controlled by the multifractal exponents of the generating signal .",
    "we have verified the validity of our approach through extensive numerical simulations , highlighting the excellent agreement observed in many cases , and discussing in detail the reasons why in some cases ( e.g. , the henon map in @xmath112 ) the numerical experiments depart from theoretical predictions .    in particular , we could conclude that a sufficient condition to obtain a scale - free topology is that the natural measure of a box must increase with the degree of the associated node in a algebraic fashion . in our numerical experiments",
    "we have observed that this condition is fulfilled in multifractal attractors in @xmath112 with fractal dimension @xmath177 .",
    "this fact leads us to conjecture that scale - free networks can be observed in general multifractal time series in which the fractal dimension is equal to the euclidean dimension of the embedding phase space .",
    "our work extends existing approaches bridging time series analysis and network science by addressing the ubiquitous case of signals exhibiting multifractal properties . by doing this",
    ", it enriches the set of interpretative tools available for a better characterization of empirical time - series .",
    "for this reason , we can envisage that it will be of interest also to the growing community of interdisciplinary researchers studying natural time series through the lenses of network science .",
