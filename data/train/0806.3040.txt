    "holography is a new concept of the superstring theory based on the duality between gauge and supergravity theories , proposed by maldacena in 1997.@xcite the superstring theory with conformal and lorentz invariance has ten - dimensional space - time to avoid anomalies .",
    "its elemental degrees of freedom are one - dimensional open or closed strings",
    ". the fluctuation modes of these strings are expected to give the elementary particle degrees of freedom as in the standard model .",
    "one can also find a soliton of strings as the ( @xmath2 + 1)-dimensional membrane composed by the condensed strings , called @xmath3-brane.@xcite in particular , @xmath3-brane has two important aspects as follows .",
    "first , a ( @xmath2 + 1)-dimensional gauge theory appears _ on _ @xmath3-brane . here , an open string with the two edges on the @xmath3-brane has ten independent fluctuation modes ; scalar fields @xmath4 and the other vector - like fields @xmath5 .",
    "@xmath5 have an index @xmath6 on @xmath3-brane extending to ( @xmath2 + 1)-dimensional space - time , and @xmath7 fields can be regarded as gauge fields on the @xmath3-brane . in this sense ,",
    "( @xmath2 + 1)-dimensional gauge theory appears _ on _ @xmath3-brane .",
    "second , @xmath8(@xmath2+_1_)+1@xmath9-dimensional supergravity appears _ around _ the @xmath3-brane .",
    "in fact , @xmath3-brane is found to be a strong gravitational system in ten - dimensional space - time as a black hole or a black brane,@xcite giving nontrivial curvatures around it . due to the geometrical symmetry",
    ", the angle coordinates around @xmath3-brane become trivial and can be integrated out in the action of @xmath3-brane . then , there eventually remains just one radial dimension with nontrivial curvature , indicating the existence of gravity . in this sense ,",
    "@xmath8(@xmath2+_1_)+1@xmath9-dimensional supergravity appears _ around",
    "_ @xmath3-brane .",
    "( the italic `` _ 1 _ '' denotes the radial dimension around @xmath3-brane . )",
    "now we discuss the holography .",
    "holography indicates the equivalence between the ( @xmath2 + 1)-dimensional gauge theory without gravity _ on _ @xmath3-brane and the @xmath8(@xmath2+_1_)+1@xmath9-dimensional supergravity _ around _ @xmath3-brane .",
    "dimensions are different with each other to give the concept of holography . in particular , the ( @xmath2 + 1)-dimensional gauge theory projected on the surface of @xmath3-brane is often called as the `` hologram '' of the @xmath8(@xmath2+_1_)+1@xmath9-dimensional supergravity .    the most essential property of holography is the existence of strong - weak duality ( s - duality ) between the gauge theory and the supergravity : couplings are transversely related with each other . therefore , if one wants to analyze the non - perturbative ( strong - coupling ) aspects of one side , one can attack from the other dual side only with the tree - level ( weak - coupling ) calculations .",
    "consequently , this new concept of holography is expected to be a powerful tool for both sides of the gauge theory in hadron physics and the gravitational theory in astrophysics.@xcite",
    "if one succeeds in constructing qcd with quarks and gluons on a special configuration of @xmath1-branes , one can attack the non - perturbative aspects of qcd from the tree - level dual supergravity side .",
    "this is the strategy of holographic qcd .    in 2005 ,",
    "sakai and sugimoto succeeded in constructing massless qcd on @xmath0 multi-@xmath1-brane system.@xcite @xmath10-brane has opposite chirality relative to @xmath11-brane to introduce the concept of chiral symmetry in this model .",
    "then , by using the concept of holography , non - perturbative aspects of massless qcd can be analyzed by the tree - level calculation in the dual @xmath8(4+_1_)+1@xmath9-dimensional supergravity side , called holographic qcd . in fact",
    ", this theory describes mesons as color - singlet low - energy objects , and reproduces meson mass spectra in coincidence with experimental data , and also other many traditional meson phenomenologies like vector - meson dominance , ksrf relation , gsw model and so on.@xcite in this sense , holographic qcd can be regarded as the `` unified meson theory '' based on qcd .    in this construction , however , @xmath8(4+_1_)+1@xmath9-dimensional classical supergravity is dual with large-@xmath12 qcd . then , as a general property of large-@xmath12 qcd , another important color - singlet objects as _ baryons _ do not directly appear in the large-@xmath12 limit.@xcite in fact , it is non - trivial to describe baryons in the large-@xmath12 holographic qcd .",
    "in order to describe baryons in holographic qcd , we introduce the concept of chiral solitons ( skyrmions ) in the large-@xmath12 holographic model .",
    "the skyrme model is first proposed in 1961,@xcite describing a baryon as a topological chiral soliton of the pion field , which is the nambu - goldstone boson relating to spontaneous chiral - symmetry breaking . here",
    ", the stability of the chiral soliton is known to be sensitive to the four - derivative terms of pion fields .",
    "chiral and lorentz symmetries allows three candidates as four - derivative terms : @xmath13 ^ 2,\\hspace{4mm}{\\rm tr}\\{l_\\mu , l_\\nu\\}^2,\\hspace{4 mm } { \\rm tr}(\\partial_\\mu   l_\\nu)^2 ,   \\label{deri1}\\ ] ] where @xmath14 is one - form of pion fields , @xmath15 . the first term in eq.([deri1 ] )",
    "is the skyrme term .",
    "the other two candidates in eq.([deri1 ] ) are known to give instability of the skyrmion,@xcite but these two can not be excluded by the symmetry arguments .    as a remarkable fact , in the leading order of holographic qcd ,",
    "only the skyrme term in eq.([deri1 ] ) appears .",
    "this can be understood from the fact that the leading order of the effective action ( dbi action ) of @xmath11-brane includes only `` two time - derivatives '' at most , which gives a severe restriction on the possible terms in the effective meson theory .",
    "thus , the topological picture for baryons is derived from qcd and seems to be justified ingeniously in this framework with the superstring theory .",
    "we investigate the hedgehog configuration for pion fields @xmath16 and @xmath17 meson fields @xmath18 in the meson effective action derived from holographic qcd as @xmath19 @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) is a dimensionless function with boundary conditions @xmath22 and @xmath23 , giving topological charge equal to unity as a unit baryon number . with the hedgehog configuration ansatz ( [ wytp ] ) , we uniqeuly derive the energy density @xmath24 $ ] for the brane - induced skyrmion including interaction terms of pions and @xmath17 mesons from holographic qcd as follows : @xmath25 =               \\frac{f_\\pi^2}{4}{\\left [ } 2{\\left ( } r^2 f^{'2}+2\\sin^2f { \\right ) } { \\right ] } + \\frac{1}{32e^2}{\\left [ } 16 \\sin^2f { \\left ( } 2 f^{'2}+\\frac{\\sin^2f}{r^2}{\\right ) } { \\right ] } \\nonumber\\\\           & + & \\frac{1}{2 }              { \\left [ } 8{\\left\\ { } \\newcommand{\\rtk } { \\right\\ } } 3\\tilde{g}^2 + 2 r \\tilde{g}(\\tilde{g}^ { ' } ) + r^2\\tilde{g}^{'2}\\rtk { \\right ] } + m_{\\rho}^2              { \\left [ } 4 r^2 \\tilde{g}^2 { \\right ] } - g_{3\\rho }                { \\left [ } 16 r \\tilde{g}^3 { \\right ] } + \\frac{1}{2}g_{4\\rho }              { \\left [ } 16 r^2 \\tilde{g}^4 { \\right ] } \\nonumber\\\\           & + &   g_1               { \\left [ } 16 { \\left\\ { } \\newcommand{\\rtk } { \\right\\ } } f^{'}\\sin f \\cdot{\\left ( } \\tilde{g}+ r \\tilde{g}^{'}{\\right)}+\\sin^2f\\cdot\\tilde{g}/r\\rtk { \\right ] } - g_2              { \\left [ } 16 \\sin^2f\\cdot\\tilde{g}^2 { \\right ] } \\nonumber\\\\           & - & g_3               { \\left [ } 16 \\sin^2f\\cdot{\\left ( } 1-\\cos f{\\right)}\\tilde{g}/r { \\right ] } - g_4              { \\left [ } 16 { \\left ( } 1-\\cos f{\\right)}\\tilde{g}^2 { \\right ] } + g_5               { \\left [ } 16 r { \\left ( } 1-\\cos f { \\right)}\\tilde{g}^3 { \\right ] } \\nonumber\\\\            & + & g_6              { \\left [ } 16 r^2 f^{'2}\\tilde{g}^2 { \\right ] } + g_7              { \\left [ } 8 { \\left ( } 1-\\cos f{\\right)}^2\\tilde{g}^2 { \\right ] } . \\label{energy_dense_an}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] all the coupling constants ( @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 ) in eq.([energy_dense_an ] ) are uniquely determined by just two experimental inputs as @xmath30 and @xmath31 , which is a remarkable consequence of holographic framework .",
    "we numerically obtain the stable chiral soliton solution as a baryon in holographic qcd , which basically supports the `` skyrme soliton picture '' for baryons with corrections by @xmath17 mesons .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows the total energy density of a baryon and each contribution of @xmath17 meson interaction terms derived from holographic qcd . this result indicates the active contribution of @xmath17 mesons in the deeper interior region of baryons , and such a `` @xmath17 mesonic parton '' in the soliton may lead to a new picture for baryons from holographic framework",
    "we have performed the first study of baryons as chiral solitons in holographic qcd with @xmath0 multi-@xmath1-brane system.@xcite we have found that the holographic qcd has a stable hedgehog soliton solution as a baryon , which is basically described as the skyrme soliton of pions including @xmath17 mesons in the interior region .    just after our study , similar studies of baryons were done using instantons in the five - dimensional gauge theory in holographic framework.@xcite it is also interesting to compare chiral solitonic baryons in the holographic qcd with other - type construction of stringy hadrons in a holographic framework.@xcite    from more general point of view , `` holography '' is a powerful concept which links qcd - hadron physics and blackhole - astrophysics by virtue of its s - duality .",
    "large applications of this new concept are much expected in near future .",
