    "we consider bimatrix games with square payoff matrices @xmath26 @xmath27 , where the thermodynamic limit consists of @xmath28 .",
    "we assume that the entries of the payoff matrices at different sites are identically and independently distributed .",
    "since the two payoff matrices may be multiplied by any constant or have any constant added to them without changing the properties of the game in any material way there is no loss of generality involved in considering payoffs of order @xmath29 and of zero mean . in the thermodynamic limit",
    "one finds that only the first two moments of the payoff distribution are relevant , as is generally the case in fully connected disordered systems described by mean - field theories .",
    "hence the entries of the payoff matrices may be considered to be gaussian distributed .",
    "then the only property of the distribution of payoffs which is not fixed by these specifications is the correlation @xmath30 between entries at the same site of the two payoff matrices .",
    "we thus choose the entries of the payoff matrices to be drawn randomly according to the probability distribution @xmath31 i.e. a gaussian distribution with zero mean , variance @xmath32 and correlation @xmath33 for all pairs @xmath8 and @xmath34 . here and in the following , the double angles denote the average over the payoff distribution ( [ eq : payensemble ] ) .",
    "for @xmath35 ( [ eq : payensemble ] ) includes a dirac - delta @xmath36 corresponding to a zero - sum game and we recover the situation of @xcite as a special case .",
    "@xmath37 corresponds to uncorrelated payoff matrices and @xmath38 is the so - called symmetric case @xmath39 where the two players always receive identical payoffs .",
    "thus the parameter @xmath30 describes the degree of similarity between the payoffs to either player and can be used to continuously tune the game from a zero - sum game to a purely symmetric game . in the former case ,",
    "the gain of one player is the loss of the other , so generally negative @xmath30 correspond to a competitive situation , whereas for positive @xmath30 there are many pairs of strategies which are beneficial to both players .",
    "in this section we construct an indicator function which is zero at a ne with payoffs @xmath14 and @xmath15 to players @xmath0 and @xmath1 respectively , and non - zero everywhere else .",
    "this function will be made the argument of a properly normalized dirac - delta function . integrating the dirac - delta function over the mixed strategies of both players",
    ", we are effectively counting the number of ne with the specified payoffs . from the resulting spectrum of ne the statistical properties of ne in bimatrix games may be deduced .",
    "since we expect the number of ne to scale exponentially with the size of the game our central tool of investigation will be the _ entropy of nash equilibria _ defined by @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the number of ne with the specified payoffs per unit interval within a small interval around @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "since @xmath42 is expected to be an extensive quantity , we may assume that @xmath43 is self - averaging and in the thermodynamic limit the average value of the entropy will be realized with probability one .",
    "hence the central goal of our calculation will be to evaluate @xmath44 .    in this framework the total number of ne",
    "is given by @xmath45 so in the thermodynamic limit the ne will be exponentially dominated by the maximum of the curve @xmath46 .",
    "this implies that a randomly chosen ne will yield the payoffs where the maximum occurs with probability 1 . on the other hand , the line where @xmath47 delimits the smallest and the largest values of @xmath48 for which there is still an exponential number of ne .",
    "the three expressions may be encoded in a single condition @xcite by introducing the variables @xmath49 and @xmath50 with @xmath51 condition ( [ eq : ne2 ] ) may be written as @xmath52 so for positive @xmath53 , @xmath54 , whereas for negative @xmath53 we have @xmath55",
    ". furthermore we have @xmath56 if @xmath57 and @xmath58 for @xmath59 .",
    "the condition @xmath60 is thus satisfied automatically .",
    "analogous relations hold for player @xmath1 .",
    "the new variables therefore serve as a convenient tool to encode the ` complementary ' quantities @xmath19 and @xmath61 in a single variable .",
    "analogous relations hold for player @xmath1 . the density of ne with payoffs @xmath14 and @xmath15",
    "may thus be written as @xmath62 where the mixed strategies are rescaled to @xmath63 so we define the measure @xmath64 as @xmath65 this scaling of the mixed strategies assumes that the an extensive number of strategies are played with non - zero probability , so the individual terms @xmath19 and @xmath66 are all of order @xmath67 .",
    "the integrals over @xmath68 effectively amount to choosing a set of strategies with @xmath59 and @xmath69 , solving the resulting linear equations for the components played with non - zero probability , and checking if this candidate for a ne fulfills the conditions ( [ eq : ne2 ] ) .",
    "it may thus be viewed as performing the so - called support enumeration algorithm analytically @xcite .",
    "in this section we calculate the average of @xmath70 over the disorder ( [ eq : payensemble ] ) . in order to represent the logarithm of ( [ ch3part ] ) we use the replica - trick @xmath71 and compute the average over @xmath72 for integer @xmath73 taking the limit @xmath74 by analytic continuation at the end . using integral representations of the dirac - delta function",
    "we obtain @xmath75 where @xmath76 runs from @xmath77 to @xmath73 .",
    "the most awkward term of this expression is the absolute value of the normalizing determinant , i.e. the jacobian matrix of @xmath78 given by @xmath79 which arises from the coefficients of @xmath80 and @xmath81 in @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",

    ", one finds that only the resulting quadratic submatrix of size @xmath89 by @xmath89 contributes to the determinant of @xmath84 . from ( [ eq : ne2 ] ) one finds that the distinction between @xmath90 and @xmath91 is immaterial since the number of strategies played by player @xmath0 at any ne always equals that played by @xmath1 and the determinant of @xmath84 is zero for @xmath92 . in the following",
    "we will assume that @xmath93 is a self - averaging quantity depending on @xmath94 .",
    "splitting off the normalizing determinant , the average over the payoffs may now easily be performed , details of the calculations are given in appendix [ appendix ] .",
    "the average over the disorder introduces a coupling between the replicas and one introduces the symmetric matrix of the overlaps between mixed strategies of each player as order parameters , @xmath95 as well as their conjugates @xmath96 . at non - zero values of @xmath30",

    "we calculate the distribution of strategy strengths @xmath119 and the potential payoffs @xmath120 at ne . due to the symmetry of ( [ partrep2 ] ) under an interchange of players for @xmath121",
    "it is sufficient to calculate these distributions for a single player only .",
    "we make use of the set of variables @xmath53 introduced in section [ ch3indi ] , since the distribution @xmath122 is equal to @xmath123 for @xmath124 and equal to @xmath125 for @xmath126 . by the same token , the fraction of strategies with @xmath56 is equal to @xmath127 and the fraction of potential payoffs with @xmath128 is @xmath129 .",
    "since all pure strategies are equivalent after averaging over the payoffs ( translation - invariance ) , we calculate @xmath130 in order to be able to perform the average over payoffs occurring in both the numerator and the denominator , we have represented the denominator by @xmath131 replicas .",
    "the average over payoffs now proceeds exactly as in the previous section . introducing the matrices of order parameters @xmath132 again ,",
    "the @xmath133 term may be split off from the saddle point integral without distorting the saddle point in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "taking the replica symmetric ansatz one obtains @xmath134 where @xmath135 was defined in ( [ gdef ] ) , the order parameters take on their saddle point values , and we have dropped the player - indices of the order parameters .",
    "these functions have to be evaluated numerically and will be discussed in section [ ch3dissstab ] .",
    "the same procedure may be used to calculate another quantity of interest , namely the fraction @xmath136 of pure strategies which are _ both _ played with non - zero probability in two randomly chosen ne equilibria . like @xmath137 ,",
    "this quantity is a measure of the degree of similarity of two randomly chosen ne .",
    "however @xmath136 does not directly depend on the self - overlap of the mixed strategies and may serve to test if there are strategies which are more likely to be played at a ne than others . from ( [ partrep2 ] ) and ( [ ch3rs ] ) one obtains @xmath138      the results for the quenched average were derived on the basis of the replica - symmetric ansatz ( [ ch3rs ] ) . in this section",
    "we investigate the stability of this ansatz with respect to small fluctuations around ( [ ch3rs ] ) in order to check if this ansatz is at least locally stable .",
    "we restrict ourselves to the special case @xmath37 , where the payoff matrices are uncorrelated and the order parameters @xmath139 do not arise @xcite .",

    "the criterion for rs to be locally stable needs to be determined by working out the paths of integration in the complex plane of @xmath145 and @xmath146 . denoting the replicon - eigenvalues of @xmath147 , @xmath148 , and @xmath149 by @xmath150",
    "respectively one obtains the criterion for the local stability of rs @xmath151 for details of the calculation see appendix [ appch31rsstab ] .",
    "the quantity @xmath152 contains a wealth of information .",
    "we begin by discussing the general shape of @xmath152 and the number of ne as a function of @xmath30 , then turn to the statistical properties of ne and give a geometric interpretation of the results , and finally discuss the distribution of potential payoffs and the strategy strengths .",
    "the expression ( [ srep ] ) for @xmath153 defines a family of curves with a pronounced maximum shown exemplarily for @xmath37 in figure [ figkappa0 ] .",
    "= 7.5 cm    as argued in section [ ch3indi ] in the thermodynamic limit the maximum of @xmath154 dominates the spectrum of ne .",
    "another point of interest is the value of @xmath155 where @xmath154 crosses the @xmath156 axis . due to the symmetry of @xmath43 under an interchange of the players",
    "this point indicates the ne with the maximum sum of the payoffs .",
    "for @xmath35 it takes on the value @xmath157 and increases monotonously with @xmath30 . at @xmath158 it diverges to infinity ; @xmath154 no longer crosses the @xmath156 axis . in this case",
    "there is an exponentially large number of ne offering an arbitrarily large payoff to either player , where an arbitrarily small fraction of strategies are played . from the annealed approximation one",
    "obtains @xmath159 , the corresponding result from the rs expression for the quenched average is @xmath160 .",
    "this effect may be explained as follows : at large values of @xmath30 players may pick a few of the pairs of strategies @xmath8 , which offer a large payoff to both of them and play them with a large probability .",
    "an exponential number of ne may be constructed in this way , even though their number is exponentially small compared to the total number of ne .",
    "the entropy of ne given by the maximum @xmath161 of @xmath154 is shown in figure [ figsk ] .",
    "= 7.5 cm    we find @xmath162 since there is only a single equilibrium point for zero - sum games . @xmath161 increases with @xmath30 , so for all @xmath163 the typical number of ne scales exponentially with @xmath164 .",
    "the maximum of the typical number of ne is reached for the case of symmetric games , where @xmath165 .",
    "this result may be compared with a rigorous upper bound for the maximal number of ne in a bimatrix game derived using geometric methods @xcite : for any non - degenerate @xmath164-by-@xmath164 bimatrix game with large @xmath164 there are at most @xmath166 equilibrium points .",
    "as expected , the typical - case scenario does not saturate this bound , at least not for the distribution of payoffs considered here .",
    "nevertheless for @xmath163 the typical number of ne investigated here and the maximal number of ne both scale exponentially with @xmath164 .",
    "the increase of the number of ne with the correlation between the payoff matrices may be explained as follows : as will be discussed in the next section , the payoff @xmath155 to both players increases with @xmath30 . for increasing values of @xmath167 the necessary ( but not sufficient ) conditions for a ne @xmath168",
    "become increasingly easy to fulfill .",
    "in fact for @xmath169 only a single point on the simplexes of the two players fulfills ( [ nenecc ] ) , whereas for large @xmath155 a correspondingly large section of the simplexes qualify as a candidate for equilibrium points @xcite . as a result",
    "the number of points which apart from ( [ nenecc ] ) obey @xmath170 and @xmath171 and thus constitute ne increases with @xmath30 .      in the thermodynamic limit",
    "not only the number of ne will be dominated by the maximum of @xmath154 , but a randomly chosen ne will also give the payoff @xmath172 with probability one , because the number of ne with this payoff is exponentially larger than the number of all other ne .",
    "similarly , the selfoverlap , the mutual overlap , and the fraction of strategies played with non - zero probability will take on their saddle - point values evaluated at the maximum of @xmath154 with probability 1 .",
    "= 7.5 cm    = 7.5 cm    figure [ fignup ] shows the payoff dominating the spectrum of ne and the corresponding fraction @xmath173 of strategies played with non - zero probability , whereas the self - overlap of mixed strategies @xmath174 and the overlap @xmath137 between the mixed strategies of different ne are shown in figure [ figq01 ] .    at @xmath35",
    "we recover the results for zero - sum games with @xmath175 , @xmath169 , and @xmath176 @xcite .",
    "as @xmath30 rises , the payoff increases .",
    "this effect may be understood as follows : at increasing @xmath30 the outcome of a pair of strategies @xmath8 which is beneficial to player @xmath0 say , tends to become more beneficial to player @xmath1 . as a result players focus on these strategies and the payoff at a ne to both players rises . by the same token",
    ", the fraction @xmath173 of strategies which are played with non - zero probability at a ne decreases with @xmath30 and the self - overlap @xmath174 of the mixed strategies increases .",
    "the geometric structure of the set of ne may be elucidated by considering the mutual overlap @xmath177 between mixed strategies of different ne . at @xmath35 , where there is only a single ne",
    ", @xmath137 equals the self - overlap @xmath174 . after an initial increase @xmath137 decreases with increasing @xmath30 .",
    "the initial increase of @xmath137 is due to the rapid increase of the lengths of the mixed strategy vectors and is thus not seen in the ratio between the overlaps .",
    "this result may be interpreted geometrically in that the ne become more and more separated with increasing @xmath30 , and for @xmath178 they end up in nearly uncorrelated positions , @xmath179 . at the same time",
    "an increasing fraction of components of the mixed strategies have @xmath56 , i.e. lie on an edge of the simplex .",
    "= 7.5 cm    even though the ne spread over the simplex with increasing @xmath30 , players still tend to focus on specific strategies .",
    "this may be seen by comparing the fraction of strategies @xmath136 played in _ both _",
    "mixed strategies of two randomly chosen ne with the corresponding result @xmath180 , which would result if players chose @xmath173 strategies to be played with non - zero probabilities at random . from figure [ figbp ] one finds that although @xmath136 decreases with @xmath30 consistent with the spread of ne over the simplex it always remains above @xmath180 . this behaviour is consistent with the idea that with increasing @xmath30 players focus on pairs of strategies which are beneficial to both , of which there is a large number for large values of @xmath30 .",
    "since ne are isolated points , replica symmetry describes a set of equilibrium points which are distributed uniformly over a part of the simplex with opening angle @xmath181 . a replica - symmetry breaking scenario would involve clusters of ne , and maybe even clusters of clusters , so an ansatz explicitly including more than two overlap scales would have to be employed along the lines of the parisi - scheme @xcite .",
    "however , at least for @xmath37 , we found that replica symmetry is locally stable for @xmath182 and most importantly at the maximum of the curve .",
    "rs remained locally stable across the range of @xmath155 investigated , nevertheless rs may become locally unstable again at sufficiently large values of @xmath155 .",
    "thus we may conclude that for typical ne at @xmath37 the replica - symmetric ansatz is self - consistent . since we know from the results of @xcite",
    "that rs is marginally stable at @xmath35 one may in fact speculate that for the typical ne the rs scenario holds across the entire range of @xmath30 .",
    "nevertheless there may well be distributions of the payoffs which lead to non - uniform distributions of ne and to replica - symmetry breaking , presumably distributions with large values of @xmath30 , or with correlations between the entries of the payoff matrices at different sites .",
    "figure [ figstabs ] shows the distribution of strategy strengths @xmath119 ( @xmath124 ) and the potential payoffs @xmath120 ( @xmath126 ) calculated in section [ ch3distr ] .",
    "the decrease of the fraction of strategies played with non - zero probability , @xmath129 with @xmath30 is clearly visible .",
    "one also finds a marked tendency for both players to use large values of @xmath19 and @xmath66 for decreasing values of @xmath173 , as is demanded by the normalization condition .",
    "one also observes the formation of a ` shoulder ' in the distribution of @xmath183 ( @xmath126 ) centered at @xmath184 .",
    "it shows that the distribution of @xmath185 remains peaked at zero leading to the formation of the shoulder at @xmath186 as @xmath155 increases .",
    "= 0.8      the numerical results for figure [ figsk ] , [ figstabs ] , @xmath137 in [ figq01 ] , and @xmath136 in [ figbp ] were obtained by using so - called vertex enumeration to enumerate all ne .",
    "since the computational effort for vertex enumeration scales with @xmath187 , the system size had to be restricted to @xmath188 and averages were taken over 100 samples , resulting in pronounced finite size effects .",
    "nevertheless the increase of the number of ne with @xmath30 is clearly confirmed by the simulations .",
    "the numerical results for figure [ fignup ] , @xmath174 in figure [ figq01 ] , @xmath173 in [ figbp ] , and figure [ figstabs ] were obtained by using an iterated variant of the lemke - howson algorithm @xcite to locate _ a single _ ne and by averaging the results for @xmath189 over 200 different realizations of the payoffs .",
    "although some finite - size effects remain , there is good agreement between the analytical and the numerical results .",
    "we analysed the properties of nash equilibria in large random bimatrix games . to this end",
    "we constructed an indicator function which was used to count the number of ne with given payoffs to both players .",
    "we found that the number of ne is exponentially dominated by ne with a certain payoff to both players , and a certain set of order parameters .",
    "this implies that for a randomly chosen nash equilibrium quantities such as the fraction of strategies played with a given probability , the self - overlap , and most importantly the payoff to either player take on a specific value with probability 1 .",
    "we considered square payoff matrices and argued that for large games and identically and independently distributed elements of the payoff matrices at different sites @xmath8 , the only relevant parameter of the probability ensemble is the correlation between elements of the same site of the payoff matrices @xmath76 and @xmath190 .",
    "we then calculated the quenched average of the number of nash equilibria , from which one may also deduce quantities such as the payoff , the self - overlap and the mutual overlap of mixed strategies at ne , and the distribution of the strategy strengths and the potential payoffs .",
    "we found that both the number of equilibrium points and the payoff to both players increase with the correlation between the payoff matrices : with increasing correlation the number of pairs of strategies which are beneficial to both players grows .",
    "players may focus on these pairs and achieve a larger payoff , the fraction of strategies played with non - zero probability decreases accordingly . from the values of the saddle - point parameters",
    "one may also deduce information on the geometric properties of ne : with increasing correlation between the payoff matrices the ne spread out over wider regions of the simplex .",
    "these analytic results were quantitatively compared with extensive numerical simulations and good agreement was found .",
    "another point of relevance is that for a sufficiently large correlation between the payoff matrices , an exponentially large number of ne appears which offer arbitrarily large payoffs ( on the statistical mechanics scale ) to both players .",
    "the number of such ne is of course exponentially small compared to the total number of ne , nevertheless these equilibrium points may be relevant if players are free to choose equilibrium points .",
    "a number of generalizations and extensions of these scenarios may be envisaged at this stage , including the investigation of bimatrix games with rectangular payoff matrices or payoff matrices with correlations between the elements at different sites .",
    "furthermore , a scenario of games of several players might be extended to describe cooperative games , where coalitions of players pool their payoffs and seek to maximize the gain of their respective coalition . in this context it may also be interesting to consider the case of @xmath191 players choosing between @xmath67 strategies .",

    "in the following we give a derivation of the quenched average of the entropy of ne . in order to represent the logarithm of @xmath192 we replicate @xmath73 times the expression for the number of ne @xmath192 ( [ ch3part ] ) to obtain ( [ partrep1 ] ) .    treating the normalizing determinant as a self - averaging quantity , we may split off @xmath193 with @xmath194 from ( [ partrep1 ] ) and _ separately _ average the normalizing determinant over the disorder . leaving out all the rows and columns which have only the entry @xmath77 along the diagonal and do not contribute to the determinant ,",

    "we obtain @xmath224 a particularly efficient way to disentangle the three sums over the replica - replica couplings is to use two coupled gaussian integrals over variables termed @xmath76 and @xmath190 echoing the original average over the payoff matrices , which yield @xmath225 where @xmath111 with @xmath112 is defined by ( [ ch3pdef ] ) .",

    "<S> one of the cornerstones of modern economics and game theory is the concept of a nash equilibrium @xcite , for an introduction see also @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a nash equilibrium ( ne ) describes a situation where no player can unilaterally improve his payoff by changing his individual strategy given that the other players all stick to their strategies . </S>",
    "<S> however this concept is thought to suffer from the serious drawback that in most games there is a large number of nash equilibria with different characteristics but no means of telling which one will be chosen by the players , as would be required of a predictive theory .    </S>",
    "<S> this conceptual problem already shows up in the paradigmatic model of a bimatrix game between two players @xmath0 and @xmath1 where player @xmath0 chooses a so - called _ pure strategy _ </S>",

    "<S> a nash equilibrium @xmath12 is defined by @xmath13    the condition for a ne with a _ given set _ of expected payoffs @xmath14 and @xmath15 may be written as @xmath16 where we have dropped the @xmath17 indices for simplicity . </S>",
    "<S> the first column ensures that there are no pure strategies ( and thus also no mixed strategies ) which will yield a payoff larger than @xmath14 to player @xmath0 and @xmath15 to player @xmath1 . thus no player will have a reason to deviate from his mixed strategy . </S>",

    "<S> in this situation there exists no mixed strategy which will increase the expected payoff to @xmath0 if @xmath1 does not alter his strategy and vice versa for @xmath1 . </S>",
