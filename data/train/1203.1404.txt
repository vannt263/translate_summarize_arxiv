    "it is known that in the leading order radiative contribution to the binding energy of atomic or molecular system the most complicate for numerical evaluation quantity is the bethe logarithm @xcite .",
    "one of the first most accurate results for the helium ground state was obtained by c.  schwartz @xcite in 1961 and remained the best one over 30 years ! in 1999 , goldman and drake @xcite suggested a new way to evaluate the bethe logarithm , @xmath3 , for a helium atom , which is based on another presentation of @xmath3 in terms of the _ acceleration gauge _ dipole operators and a full diagonalization of the hamiltonian .",
    "this method works well for two- and three - electron helium(lithium)-like atoms @xcite but attempts to apply it to other systems like h@xmath0 molecular ion were not very successful .",
    "the other disadvantage of the method is a necessity to add some extra terms into a basis set , which looks like @xmath4 times regular solution .",
    "the major aim of a present work is to elaborate a universal method , which uses definition of the bethe logarithm in terms of dipole operators in the _ velocity gauge _ and still as efficient as the goldman - drake method in case of hydrogen and helium like atoms .",

    "the numerical results are confined to three - body systems while the theoretical expressions are valid for a general few - body case .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we consider a derivation of the leading order radiative corrections that allow us to define the bethe logarithm for a general few - body coulomb system as an integral over photon energy @xmath5 . next the asymptotic behaviour of the core integrand , @xmath6 , and its first order perturbation wave function @xmath7 ,",
    "are derived , the leading order terms are obtained as expectation values of some operators . a variational property of the integral over @xmath5 is discussed .",
    "it allows us to work out an efficient numerical scheme to calculate the bethe logarithm using optimal parameters , which are variationally chosen .    in section iii the numerical method , which is the main goal of our studies ,",
    "is describe in details . and finally , the results of the bethe logarithm calculation for the hydrogen , helium and @xmath8 molecular ion ground states are presented and compared with other available results .",
