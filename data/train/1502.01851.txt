    "further , in optical lattices the superfluid to mott - insulator transition in bosonic gases @xcite and the liquid to mott - insulator transition in fermionic gases @xcite have been realized . however , a lot of interesting quantum phases such as the antiferromagnet , d - wave superconductivity or spin liquids @xcite have not yet been reached due to the low temperature or more precisely low entropy per particle required @xcite . for bosons it has been shown that the temperature increases with ramping up an optical lattice and it can be minimized with tuning the trap frequency @xcite .",
    "thus , the detailed investigation of the loading procedure of a fermionic gas in three - dimension is of utmost importance .",
    "moreover , quantum gases have the advantage that they are only very weakly coupled to the environment and can be considered as almost isolated on relatively long time - scales .",
    "thus , quantum gases enable the investigation of the quantum dynamics of isolated systems .",
    "a high amount of attention have received so - called quantum quenches .",
    "a quantum quench is one specific way to set the system out of equilibrium : starting with a system prepared in an equilibrium state of a chosen initial hamiltonian , one or several of the system parameters are changed .",
    "the state evolves according to the new hamiltonian .",
    "such a change is either sudden or with a certain ramp speed .",
    "the quench velocity of the slow quench plays an important role and has been studied in gapped and gapless phases and across phase transitions relating to the kibble zurek mechanism @xcite .",
    "one of the fundamental questions related to a sudden quench is how fast correlations can be formed and whether the isolated system relaxes to a thermal equilibrium state .",

    "the additional remaining two spatial dimensions are subjected to a harmonic trap .",
    "we analyse in detail the loading procedure and suggest improvements for the experiments . starting from a prepared imbalanced quantum gas , we perform a fast and slow quantum quench and follow the relaxation dynamics of the fermionic gas in the trap .",

    "in contrast , during the slow quench , the odd - even contrast is much lower and the following oscillations have a much smaller amplitude which is quickly damped out .",

    "in this work we have studied theoretically the loading procedure of non - interacting fermions into a one - dimensional superlattice , the relaxation after an abrupt change of the superlattice , and the measurement procedure of the odd - even density contrast .",
    "our calculations have taken into account the full three dimensional and spatially inhomogeneous nature of the cloud subjected to an optical superlattice potential at the expense of considering non - interacting fermions .",
    "the findings we have obtained led to insights which can be used to improve the experimental loading and detection procedures . concerning the loading ramp of the fermions into the optical lattice , in our results a large mixing and the creation of excitations has been observed only in the very initial time of the loading procedure until the bloch bands become separated ( even in the presence of a trap ) .",
    "thus , the initial loading has to be optimized in an experiment , whereas after the opening of the gap a faster ramp can be applied without harm .",
    "additionally for fermionic atoms",
    "in contrast to bosonic atoms the number of atoms and the trap configurations plays an important role , since due to the pauli blocking each available energy level can only be occupied by one fermion ( or two for the spinful situation ) .",
    "starting from a certain density the higher bands have to contribute and a loading of these can not be avoided even by a locally adiabatic loading procedure . the solution to",
    "this problem is either to start with a low density or enough available levels in the directions perpendicular to the lattice direction .",
    "the trap has the additional problem that due to the lattice ramp up a change of the global density distribution is induced .",
    "another way of seeing the strong influence of the trap is the induced level crossing during the ramp . controlling the frequency of the trap",
    "this effect can be reduced .",
    "the redistribution of the density takes typically a long time .",
    "the redistribution at the boundaries can be almost blocked by bloch oscillations due to the local energy offset . in the considered case of non - interacting fermions",
    "this redistribution is even at infinite time prohibited by the conservation laws and it will never relax to its thermal equilibrium value . even though , this is an artefact of the integrable situation",
    ", some of these integrable features might also dominate the situation in which the integrability is slightly broken by a weak interaction .",
    "let us mention that a very slow redistribution had already been identified previously , for the interacting case . in the interacting model mott - insulating barriers can arise which can almost totally block the redistribution of the atoms @xcite .",
    "thus in experiments this is a crucial point which has to be considered .",
    "a corresponding adjustment of the trapping potential , as it is partially the case in red - detuned lattices , could cure this problem ( cf .",
    "also recent quasi - exact simulations for bosonic atoms in one - dimension which support this suggestion @xcite ) .",
    "the relaxation dynamics after a sudden and slow change of the bichromatic potential to a monochromatic potential has shown that locally a fast relaxation can occur for some observables , whereas the global relaxation takes place on a much longer time scale . due to the integrability of our system",
    ", the long - time steady state could show a structure of two superimposed peaks with different width , which clearly does not correspond to a thermal equilibrium state .",
    "we identified different important time - scales .",
    "the local relaxation has taken place on the time - scale of the tunneling time , here given by @xmath180ms .",
    "additionally , the global density redistribution occurs on a longer time scale .",
    "an impression of these give the breathing modes , which are approximately one to two orders of magnitudes larger .    in the detection procedure for the odd - even density contrast also",
    "the time - scales play a very important role .",
    "we have found that a fast switch off of the green lattice potential and dominantly a relatively long regulation step of the lattice potential influences the resulting contrast . whereas this change is negligible for a high contrast , in the situation of vanishing contrast",
