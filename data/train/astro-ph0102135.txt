    "the origin of hydrogen - deficient post - asymptotic - giant - branch ( post - agb ) stars has been a matter of debate since many years .",
    "although stars evolving through the agb phase stay hydrogen - rich at their surfaces , a considerable fraction of their descendants , the central stars of planetary nebulae ( cspne ) , show hydrogen - deficient compositions ( mendez 1991 ) .",
    "approximately 20% of the whole cspne population appears to be hydrogen deficient while the rest show solar - like compositions .",
    "whereas we believe to understand the structure and evolution of the latter with normal surface abundances reasonably well , the evolution of the former appeared to be still enigmatic .",
    "important constituents of the hydrogen - deficient population are the so - called wolf - rayet ( wr ) central stars and the hot pg1159 stars with typical surface abundances of ( he , c , o)=(33,50,17 ) by mass ( dreizler & heber 1998 , koesterke & hamann 1997 ) .",
    "in addition to their exotic abundances , wr cspne expose strong stellar winds of @xmath0m@xmath1/yr and higher pn outflow velocities but otherwise do not differ significantly from the rest of the central stars ( gorny & stasinska 1995 , tylenda 1996 ) and are expected to have the same mean mass of @xmath2m@xmath1 ( szczerba et al .",
    "standard stellar evolution calculations predict post - agb stars either to have hydrogen - rich surfaces ( e.g.  vassiliadis & wood 1994 , blcker 1995b ) or , if hydrogen - deficient , to expose only a few percent of oxygen in their photospheres ( iben & mcdonald 1995 ) , and thus appropriate models for wr cspne are still lacking .    three types of evolutionary scenarios have been invoked to explain the wolf - rayet central stars .",
    "the first assumes the wolf - rayet stars to be the products of binary evolution with a common envelope phase ( tylenda & gorny 1993 ) but appears to be unlikely because binarity is not observed .",
    "the other scenarios assume that they are either formed by a final thermal pulse during their post - agb evolution or directly emerge from the agb .",
    "stars with initial masses between 0.8 and 6@xmath3 evolve after completion of central hydrogen and helium burning through the agb phase consisting then of a compact carbon / oxygen core ( @xmath4 ) surrounded by a thin layer of some @xmath5m@xmath1 occupied by two shells burning helium and hydrogen , resp . , and a huge , almost fully convective envelope .",
    "although being short the agb phase is of essential importance since it is governed by a rich nucleosynthesis , various processes which mix up processed material from the interior to the surface , and strong stellar winds , which substanially erode the stellar surfaces thereby continuously enriching the interstellar medium with heavier elements .",
    "this concerns in particular the evolution on the upper agb which is dominated by continuously increasing mass loss ( see habing ( 1996 ) for a review ) .",
    "observations indicate rates of @xmath6m@xmath1/yr for small - period mira stars and up to @xmath7m@xmath1/yr for luminous long - period variables ( wood 1997 ) .",
    "these winds are most likely driven by dust and shocks ( winters 1998 ) leading at larger mass - loss rates to the complete obscuration of the star by a dusty circumstellar envelope .",
    "concerning mixing processes and nucleosynthesis , thermal instabilities of the helium burning shell ( thermal pulses ) and the possible penetration of the convective envelope into the hydrogen burning shell ( hot bottom burning , hbb ) are crucial for the evolution on the upper agb .",
    "hot bottom burning is restricted to more massive stars ( @xmath8m@xmath1 ) .",
    "temperatures in excess of @xmath9k can be reached at the base of the convective envelope and material burnt there is immediately mixed to the surface leading , for instance , to the formation of lithium - rich agb stars ( scalo et al .",
    "hbb models do not obey paczynski s ( 1970 ) classical core - mass luminosity relation but , instead , evolve rapidly to very high luminosities ( blcker & schnberner 1991 ) . due to cn cycling of the envelope @xmath10 can be transformed into @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "consequently , a low @xmath13c/@xmath14c ratio is a typical signature of hbb that can delay or even prevent agb stars from becoming carbon stars ( iben 1975 ; boothroyd et al .",
    "finally , when mass loss has substantially reduced the envelope mass , the envelope convection moves upwards again and hbb shuts down ( see blcker 1995a ) .",
    "planetary nebulae showing abundance patterns with the signature of former hbb are discussed in , e.g.  kaler & jacoby ( 1989 ) and clegg ( 1991 ) .    in the following we want to focus on thermal pulses due to their particular relevance for the origin and evolution of wolf - rayet central stars .",
    "a more general review of the agb evolution is given in blcker ( 1999 ) .",
    "on the upper agb the helium burning shell becomes recurrently unstable raising the so - called thermal pulses ( schwarzschild & hrm 1965 , weigert 1966 ) . during these instabilities",
    "the luminosity of the he shell increases rapidly for a short time of 100yr to @xmath15 to @xmath16l@xmath1 . the huge amount of energy produced forces the development of a pulse - driven convection zone which mixes products of he burning , i.e.  carbon and oxygen , into the intershell region . because the hydrogen shell is pushed concomitantly into cooler domains hydrogen burning ceases temporarily allowing the envelope convection to proceed downwards after the pulse , to penetrate those intershell regions formerly enriched with carbon ( and oxygen ) and to mix this material to the surface .",
    "this 3@xmath17 dredge up leads finally to the formation of carbon stars .",
    "after the pulse hydrogen burning re - ignites and provides again the main source of energy . typically , a thermal - pulse cycle last a few @xmath18yr for large core masses ( @xmath19m@xmath1 ) and @xmath20yr to @xmath21yr for smaller ones .",
    "[ ftp3 m ] shows the evolution of the luminosities of the hydrogen und helium burning shells during the thermal pulses of a 3 m@xmath1 agb sequence .",
    "= 0.8      the formation of carbon stars and its modelling by stellar evolution calculations has been a long - standing problem .",
    "early stellar evolution calculations predicted dredge up mostly for large core - masses , i.e. high luminosities , whereas most of the ( lmc ) carbon stars observed are found at low luminosities and , therefore , are of lower mass ( _ carbon star mystery _ , iben 1981 ) .",
    "moreover , various evolutionary calculations did not find dredge up at all or differ in the efficiency obtained ( e.g.  vassiliadis & wood 1993 , blcker 1995a , forestini & charbonnel 1997 ) .",
    "the lack of optically bright carbon stars can be explained in terms of hot bottom burning and mass loss .",
    "hbb counteracts the carbon star formation .",
    "however , since it ceases earlier than dredge up , final dredge - up episodes may still produce carbon stars in the end ( frost et al .",
    "due to mass loss such luminous carbon stars are expected to be heavily enshrouded by dust hiding them from optical surveys . indeed , infrared observations of van loon et al .",
    "( 1999 ) show evidence for the existence of luminous obscured ( mc ) carbon stars .",
    "the failure to obtain efficient dredge up , in particular for lower - mass agb models , is related to the only approximate description of stellar convection and accordingly to the treatment of convective boundaries .",
    "another question intimately linked to this problem is how to produce sufficient amounts of @xmath14c in the interior as the neutron source for the @xmath22-process nucleosynthesis .",
    "therefore , it is often concluded that mixing may take place outside the formally convective boundaries ( iben 1976 , dantona & mazzitelli 1996 , wood 1997 ) .    to overcome these problems herwig et al .",
    "( 1997 ) have considered diffusive overshoot for all convective boundaries during the complete evolution leading to a considerable change in the models .",
    "the overshoot prescription is based on the hydrodynamical calculations of freytag et al .",
    "( 1996 ) who showed that mixing takes place well beyond the classical schwarzschild border due to overshooting convective elements with an exponentially declining velocity field . in the overshoot region",
    "the corresponding diffusion coefficient is given by @xmath23 with @xmath24 : velocity of the convective elements immediately before the schwarzschild border ; @xmath25 : distance from the edge of the convective zone ; @xmath26 : the overshoot efficiency parameter .",
    "within the stellar evolution calculations the efficiency parameter was chosen to be @xmath27 as appropriate to match the observed width of the main sequence .",
    "this method provides for agb stars a sufficient amount of dredge up to form low - mass carbon stars as required by the observations .",
    "additionally it leads to the formation of @xmath14c as a neutron source to drive the @xmath22-process in these stars ( see also herwig et al .",
    "1999a ) .    on the one hand ,",
    "these calculations show that dredge up can easily be obtained if some envelope overshoot is present to overcome the h / he discontinuity by deepening the envelope convection . on the other hand , overshoot leads also to an enlargement of the pulse - driven convection zone and to enhanced mixing of core material from deep layers below the he shell to the intershell zone ( `` intershell dredge - up '' ) resulting in a considerable change of the intershell abundances .",
    "after intershell dredge up the abundances ( mass fractions ) of ( he , c , o ) amount typically to ( 40,40,16 ) instead of ( 70,25,2 ) as in non - overshoot sequences .",
    "it is important to note that the total amount of dredge up depends mainly on the strength of the former intershell dredge - up ( herwig et al .",
    "these modified intershell abundances are close to the observed surface abundances of wolf - rayet central stars ( koesterke , this volume ) and pg1159 stars ( werner , this volume ) and will turn out to be a key ingredient for the modelling of these objects .",
    "mass loss terminates the agb evolution when the envelope mass is reduced to @xmath28m@xmath1 . the star moves off the agb ( schnberner 1979 ) evolving towards the regime of central stars of planetary nebulae and finally reaches the stage of white dwarfs .",
    "[ fmenvall ] illustrates the evolution of an initially 3m@xmath1 star from the main sequence to the white dwarf stage .",
    "recent reviews on the strucure and evolution of central stars of planetary nebulae are given , e.g. , by iben ( 1995 ) and schnberner and blcker ( 1996 ) .",
    "= 1.0    = 0.83      one important aspect of the transformation of agb stars into white dwarfs is the treatment of mass loss on the agb and beyond . on the one hand ,",
    "the agb mass - loss history determines the star s internal structure reached at the tip of the agb and therefore the fading speed along the cooling part of the post - agb evolution ( blcker 1995a , b ) . on the other hand , the transition times from the agb to the central - star region depend sensitively on the mass - loss rates employed beyond the agb ( schnberner 1983 ) .",
    "observations indicate that mass - loss should decrease by order of magnitudes during this transition phase ( perinotto 1989 ) .",
    "however , up to now it is only poorly known how and at which temperature ( range ) this strong decrease takes place .",
    "the transition times should not be too long since the coolest post - agb stars known have effective temperatures of about 5000k ( schnberner & blcker 1993 ) , and kinematical ages of the youngest planetaries are only of the order of 1000 years . fig .",
    "[ fmenvall ] shows the envelope mass for different remnant masses as a function of the effective temperature .    in the pn region mass - loss",
    "can be described by the radiation - driven wind theory ( pauldrach et al .",
    "the respective mass - loss rates can be adapted like @xmath29 ( blcker 1995b ) , leading to rates of @xmath30 to @xmath31m@xmath1/yr for remants of 0.6 to 0.8m@xmath1 .",
    "the corresponding influence on the evolutionary speed depends on the respective ratio of the burning rate to mass - loss rate and is only important for massive remnants . for h burning objects",
    "the total crossing time of the lighter central stars is therefore uniquely given by the available fuel ( i.e.  the envelope mass ) divided by the hydrogen luminosity . because the envelope mass decreases and the luminosity increases with remnant mass , one obtains typical crossing times ( between 10000 k to the turn - around point in the hrd ) of @xmath32yr for 0.55 m@xmath1 , 4000yr for 0.6 m@xmath1 , and 50yr for 0.94 m@xmath1 .",
    "when hydrogen burning can not be sustained any longer because the envelope mass becomes too small , the surface luminosity must drop very fast by at least one order of magnitude until it can be covered by gravothermal energy releases .",
    "helium burning is unimportant for most phase angles and dies away as well .",
    "the fading time of agb remnants down to , for instance , 100 l@xmath1 is thus controlled by the gravothermal energy release and neutrino energy losses .",
    "both processes depend on the thermomechanical structure of the core , and thus on the complete evolutionary history .      the evolution off and beyond the agb depends also on the thermal - pulse cycle phase ( fraction of the time span between two subsequent pulses ) @xmath33 with which the star moves off the agb .",
    "the post - agb evolution is dominated by helium burning for @xmath34 . for @xmath35",
    "both nuclear shell sources contribute equal luminosity fractions , for @xmath36 hydrogen burning determines the nuclear energy production ( iben 1984 ) .",
    "if the thermal - pulse cycle - phase is sufficiently large , a last thermal pulse can occur during the post - agb evolution transforming a hydrogen burning into a helium burning model .",
    "the flash forces the star to expand rapidly to red giant dimensions , and the remnant quickly evolves back to the agb ( `` born again scenario '' ) .",
    "there , it starts its post - agb evolution again , but now as a helium burning object ( iben 1984 ) .",
    "the crossing timescale is now roughly three times larger than in the case of hydrogen burning objects . in principle",
    "we can distinguish three scenarios of final thermal pulses relevant for wolf - rayet cspne ( see also herwig , this volume ) :    * the `` agb final '' thermal pulse ( aftp ) , occurring immediately before the star moves off the agb . in this case",
    "the envelope mass is already very small ( @xmath37m@xmath1 , fig .",
    "[ fmenvall ] ) . if dredge up is able to operate even for such small envelope masses , a substantial fraction of the intershell region will be mixed with the tiny envelope leading to the dilution of hydrogen and enrichment with carbon and oxygen .",
    "however , standard evolutionary calculations predict a decreasing dredge - up efficiency for low envelope masses ( wood 1981 ) and lack a sufficiently high oxygen abundance in the intershell region . * the `` late '' thermal pulse ( ltp ) , occurring when the model evolves with roughly constant luminosity from the agb towards the white dwarf domain .",
    "this kind of thermal pulse is similar to those experienced by agb stars but the envelope mass is even smaller than for the aftp ( @xmath38m@xmath1 , fig .",
    "[ fmenvall ] ) .",
    "evolutionary calculations without overshoot ( e.g. blcker & schnberner 1997 ) predict only mild , if any , mixing",
    ". the envelope convection does not reach the layers enriched with carbon , and no 3@xmath17 dredge up occurs .",
    "therefore , this scenario has often been considered in connection with mass loss , which , however , can not expose the hydrogen - free layers before effective temperatures of 100000k are reached ( iben 1984 , schnberner & blcker 1992 ) . * the `` very late '' thermal pulse ( vltp ) , occurring when the model is already on the white dwarf cooling track , i.e.  after the cessation of h burning . in this case",
    "the pulse - driven convection zone of the he - burning shell may reach and penetrate the h shell causing a considerable or even total burning of hydrogen ( fujimoto 1977 , schnberner 1979 , iben 1984 , iben & mcdonald 1995 ) . due to mixing of the very tiny envelope ( @xmath39m@xmath1 , fig .",
    "[ fmenvall ] ) with substantial fractions of the 100 times more massive intershell region , the resulting surface abundances of carbon and oxygen are close to those of the intershell region .",
    "this scenario has been considered as the most promising one for wolf - rayet cspne although it failed to match the observed oxygen abundances .    in summary",
    "one may conclude that within standard evolutionary calculations neither the aftp nor the ltp or vltp appear to be well suited scenarios for wolf - rayet stars leaving these stars still enigmatic .",
    "however , the consideration of overshoot leads to a considerable change in the models making these scenarios much more promising .",
    "= 0.95      if overshoot is applied to all convective regions , agb models show efficient dredge up even for very low envelope masses ( see herwig , this volume ) .",
    "then , an aftp can lead to both a considerable enrichment with carbon and oxygen and to the dilution of hydrogen .",
    "the resulting surface abundances depend on the actual envelope mass at which the aftp occurs .",
    "for instance , herwig ( this volume ) found for m@xmath40m@xmath1 ( h , he , c , o)=(17,33,32,15 ) after the aftp .",
    "the smaller m@xmath41 , the closer are the final abundances to those observed in wr cspne .",
    "to obtain a sufficiently high probability for the aftp to occur at very small envelope masses ( i.e. at @xmath42 ) requires , however , a coupling of mass loss to the thermal pulse cycle .",
    "otherwise , the hydrogen abundance will be relatively high .",
    "this scenario predicts small kinematical ages for the pne of wr central stars which emerge here directly from the agb .",
    "the ltp , occurring for stars which leave the agb with @xmath43 , have only been considered in connection with mass loss to explain the exotic surface abundances of wr cspne since dredge up is lacking .",
    "in contrast to hydrogen burning objects where high mass loss leads to a strong acceleration of the evolution limiting the removable mass , the longer evolutionary timescales of helium burning objects allow to expose the h - free layers , although only for @xmath44 in excess of 100000k . to strip off enough mass to expose even the deep layers which match the observed carbon and oxygen abundances requires long lasting stellar winds",
    "although this scenario appears not to be applicable to wr cspne , it may have some relevance for the most exotic pg1159 star h1504 .",
    "h1504 populates the cooling branch and shows a photosphere containing only carbon and oxygen with 50% each ( see werner , this volume ) .",
    "an exploratory study of schnberner & blcker ( 1992 ) showed that the photospheric parameters ( @xmath44 , @xmath45 , surface abundances ) of h1504 can be matched with a @xmath46m@xmath1 ltp model suffering from a constant mass - loss rate of @xmath47m@xmath1/yr until the position of h1504 in the hrd is reached .",
    "it is an open question if such high mass - loss rates can be kept on the low luminosity part of the cooling branch .",

    "these new models show for the first time that the ltp scenario may serve as one possible channel for the wr cspne .",

    "this is hard to explain within the standard ltp scenario ( no overshoot ) but is completely in line with the predictions of the new models .",
