    "the molecular mass distribution ( mwd ) of systems of linear unbranched `` equilibrium polymers '' ( ep ) is essentially exponential @xcite . in ep systems polymerization takes place under condition of chemical equilibrium between polymer chains and their respective monomers .",
    "a classical example we will focus on is provided by systems of surfactants forming polydisperse solutions of long worm - like aggregates , called `` giant micelles '' ( gm ) , which combine with each other , or break into smaller fractions @xcite .    despite polydispersity , ep resemble in many aspects conventional quenched polymers where the polymerization reaction has been deliberately terminated .",
    "recently , the basic scaling predictions for ep @xcite based on classical polymer physics @xcite have been tested by two of us ( am , jpw ) @xcite by means of a lattice monte carlo simulation based on the widely used bond - fluctuation model ( bfm ) @xcite .",
    "this demonstrated excellent agreement with theory over a very broad range of density and temperature variation .",
    "specifically , it was shown that the mwd takes the form , @xmath0 the scaling parameter @xmath1 is the ratio of the chain mass @xmath2 and the mean mass ,  and  mark the mean mass and the density at the crossover from dilute to semi - dilute regimes at given scission energy @xmath3 , and @xmath4 is the susceptibility exponent of the @xmath5 vector model in 3d @xcite .",
    "the mean chain length  was confirmed to vary with density @xmath6 and the ( dimensionless ) scission energy @xmath3 as @xmath7 with exponents @xmath8 in the dilute and @xmath9 , @xmath10 in the semi - dilute regime .",
    "the exponent @xmath11 is the swollen chain ( self - avoiding walk ) exponent in 3d .",
    "recently , these results have been questioned in an interesting computational study where a reptation algorithm was used on a cubic lattice @xcite .",
    "it was suggested that the mwd becomes singular @xmath12 with @xmath13 at very high volume fractions of order unity .",
    "this finding , if corroborated , might be of some relevance in view of the alleged levy - flight dynamic behavior in system of gm @xcite .",
    "this claim prompted the present off - lattice monte carlo ( olmc ) approach to be applied to the high density limit which was not accessible within our previous approach .",
    "we stress that effects only occurring at volume fractions of order one are unlikely to be relevant for real gm , but would be interesting on more general theoretical grounds in that the mwd in fact probes the free energy of the dense packing of beads .",
    "as we are going to show , new physics ( i.e. additional terms in the system free energy ) intervenes indeed due to packing effects of the spherical beads .",
    "this increases effectively the growth exponent @xmath14 for , but does not effect the scaling form of the mwd .",
    "we do not observe any trace of singularity  in perfect agreement with the analytical predictions @xcite .",
    "the investigation of the high density limit is only one motivation for the off - lattice algorithm proposed .",
    "in addition to this an effective olmc for ep algorithm is highly warranted to overcome the usual shortcomings of lattice models and to serve in examining the role of polymers semi - flexibility .",
    "it is also a better tool in dynamic studies of a broader class of soft condensed matter systems where bifunctionality of the chemical bonds might be extended to polyfunctional bonds , as this is the case in gels and membranes .",
    "note that the olmc was already applied successfully to rheological properties of ep reported in @xcite and to systems of ep brushes @xcite .",
    "the scope of this paper is three - fold : we want to present the olmc scheme and to test it by comparing the new results with previous findings ( in the dilute and semi - dilute regime ) obtained by means of our lattice monte carlo approach described in @xcite .",
    "secondly , we wish to address the physics in the melt density regime .",
    "in addition , the olmc algorithm is tested in systems in which the formation of closed loops is allowed .",
    "we demonstrate for the first time in a computer experiment that there is a singularity of the ring mwd @xmath15 where @xmath16 in 3d @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . after presenting the algorithm in sec.[sec : algo ] we focus in sec.[sec : rn ] on the different density and chain length regimes reflected , e.g. , by the distribution of the radius of gyration @xmath17 versus mass @xmath2 and other conformational properties .",
    "we discuss subsequently the mwd in sec.[sec : mwd ] .",
    "there we compare our olmc results for mixed systems ( in which rings are also present ) with data obtained with the bfm and with a grand canonical lattice algorithm based on the mapping of the ep problem on a potts model .",
    "the scaling of the mean chain mass is considered in sec.[sec : nav ] .",
    "the theoretical concepts ( which have already been extensively considered elsewhere @xcite ) are briefly discussed _ en passant_.",
    "we show that agreement of the olmc with our previous work is excellent for small and moderate densities . for volume fractions larger",
    "@xmath18 we evidence a third molten regime . in the final section[sec : conclusion ] we summarize our findings .",
    "it is clear that in a system of ep where scission and recombination of bonds constantly take place the particular scheme of bookkeeping should be no trivial matter @xcite .",
    "since chains are only transient objects the data structure of the chains can only be based on the individual monomers , or , even better , on the saturated or unsaturated bonds @xcite .",
    "this idea is depicted in fig.[fig : algo](a ) .",
    "each bond is considered as a _ pointer _ , originating at a given monomer and pointing to the respective other bond with which the couple forms a nearest neighbor , or to @xmath19 ( nowhere ) , if the bond is free ( unsaturated ) .",
    "chains consists of symmetrically connected lists of bonds : @xmath20 .",
    "recombination of the two initially unsaturated bonds @xmath21 and @xmath22 connects the respective monomers @xmath23 and @xmath24 in fig.[fig : algo](a ) .",
    "note that only two pointers have to be changed and that the remaining chains behind both monomers are not involved . breaking a saturated bond @xmath25",
    "requires resetting the pointers of the two connected bonds @xmath25 and @xmath26 to @xmath19 .    as mentioned in the introduction this data structure has been incorporated @xcite within the widely used bfm algorithm @xcite . for the off - lattice version presented here",
    "we have now harnessed a very efficient bead - spring algorithm for polymer chains ( for technical details see @xcite ) and cast it onto the data structure described above .",
    "this off - lattice monte carlo ( olmc ) scheme is characterized by the bonded and the non - bonded interactions shown in fig.[fig : algo](b ) .",
    "each bond is described by a shifted fene potential where a bond of length @xmath27 has a maximum at @xmath28 @xmath29 - e.   \\label{eq : fene}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath3 corresponds to a constant scission energy .",
    "note that and that @xmath30 near its minimum at @xmath31 is harmonic , with @xmath32 being the spring constant , and the potential diverges logarithmically to infinity both when @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "thus the fene potential does not need to be truncated at @xmath35 and @xmath36 and discontinuities in the derivative of the potential are avoided .",
    "following ref.@xcite we choose the parameters @xmath37 and @xmath38 , @xmath39 being the absolute temperature .",
    "the units are such that the boltzmann s constant @xmath40 .",
    "the non - bonded interaction between effective monomers is described by a morse - type potential , @xmath27 being the distance between the beads @xmath41 - 2\\exp[-a(r - r_{min } ) ]   \\label{eq : morse}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with parameters @xmath42 and @xmath43 . the latter parameter sets",
    "roughly the sphere diameter .",
    "the @xmath44-temperature of the coil - globule transition for our model is @xmath45 so that at @xmath46 we work under good solvent conditions @xcite .",
    "the model can be simulated fairly efficiently with a dynamic mc algorithm , as described previously@xcite .",
    "the trial update involves choosing a monomeric unit at random and attempting to displace it randomly by displacements @xmath47 chosen uniformly from the interval @xmath48 .",
    "moves are then accepted according to the metropolis criterion and one monte carlo step ( mcs ) involves as many attempted moves as there are monomers in the system . in equilibrium polymers the bonds between neighbors along the backbone of a chain are constantly subject to scission and recombination events . in the present model",
    "only bonds , stretched a distance @xmath27 beyond some threshold value , @xmath49 , are attempted to break so that eventually an energy @xmath50 could be released if the bond breaks .",
    "since each monomer may have at most two bonds in the same time , all particles with unsaturated bonds ( two for single monomers and one for chain ends ) may form new bonds , once they approach each other within the same interval of distances @xmath51 where scissions take place .",
    "( note that recombination for @xmath52 would violate detailed balance . )",
    "we do not allow in the presented study for branching .",
    "however , more than two bonds per monomer are possible in principle and this feature may readily included in the algorithmic framework .",
    "the generalization on netted structures like membranes or sponges is evident .",
    "( note that this is less straightforward in the bfm scheme due to its lattice character which generates ergodicity problems . ) obviously , another big advantage of the off - lattice scheme compared to its lattice precursor is its applicability to rheological problems @xcite .",
    "in most parts of this paper we focus on systems where no formation of ring polymers is allowed .",
    "this condition has to be observed whenever an act of polymerization takes place . because there is no direct chain information in the data structure this has to be done by working up the list of pointers ( which adds only four lines to the source code ) . in physical time units",
    "the simulation becomes _ faster _ for higher @xmath3 : the number of recombinations per unit time goes like @xmath53 , but the chain mass only grows as @xmath54 .",
    "obviously , the algorithm becomes even faster for the mixed systems discussed in sec.[subsec : rings ] where the ring closure constraint has been dropped .",
    "the presented algorithm allows us to simulate a large number of particles at very modest expenses of operational memory .",
    "most of the results in the present study involve @xmath55 particles for number densities between @xmath56 up to @xmath57 .",
    "note that our highest densities correspond to very concentrated solutions .",
    "this can be better seen from the volume fractions which vary between @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "the latter value has to be compared with the ( only slightly larger ) hard - sphere freezing volume fraction (  alder transition \" ) of about one half @xcite  it correponds , in fact , to a relatively dense hard - sphere liquid .",
    "note also that dense globules of maximal @xmath60 are formed by quenched monodisperse polymers in bad solvent @xcite .",
    "the effective bead volume @xmath61 used above was estimated with the measured mean bond length @xmath62 from tab.[tab : phie ] .",
    "( note that @xmath63 is weakly decreasing with density @xcite and that it is slightly smaller than the  bead diameter \" given by the shifted morse parameter @xmath35 . ) a similar , marginally larger volume of @xmath64 may be obtained from the virial expansion for quenched polymers @xcite .",
    "the scission energy @xmath3 was varied in a similar range as in @xcite from @xmath65 up to @xmath66 to yield sufficiently strong chain mass variation .",
    "note that the  remains always two orders of magnitudes smaller than the total particle number within the box .",
    "hence , from our previous study @xcite one expects finite box - size effects to be small .",
    "this was indeed born out by finite - size test performed by varying the box sizes from @xmath67 over @xmath68 to @xmath69 . only the results from the largest boxes simulated for a configuration @xmath70",
    "are reported here .",
    "periodically the whole system is examined , the mwd @xmath71 ( discussed in the subsequent section ) and the distributions of the squared end - to - end distance @xmath72 and gyration radius , @xmath17 ( averaged over all chains of a _ particular _",
    "mass @xmath2 ) are counted and stored .",
    "( periodic boundary conditions are implemented and interactions between monomers follow the minimum image convention .",
    "the computation of the conformational properties of the chains then imply a restoration of _ absolute _ monomer coordinates from the periodic ones for each repeating unit of the chain . )",
    "moments obtained from these distributions are presented in tab.[tab : phie ] and tab.[tab : phi ] .",
    "the different simulational regimes are most easily demonstrated by the conformational changes with density and chain mass .",
    "we demonstrate that the conformational properties for ep follow the same universal functions as conventional quenched polymers . in fig.[fig : rn ] @xmath73 and @xmath74 are plotted versus @xmath2 .",
    "one configuration in the dilute regime and one in the concentrated limit ( both at same @xmath75 ) have been presented . in the first case one",
    "clearly sees the swollen coil exponent . from the upper dashed line",
    "the persistence length of swollen ep is estimated as @xmath76 . in the latter case only chains smaller than the excluded volume blob of size @xmath77 size are swollen .",
    "larger chains ( @xmath78 ) show gaussian behavior with @xmath79 .",
    "this slope was used to estimate the variation of the effective persistence length @xmath80 with @xmath81 . as can be seen from tab.[tab :",
    "phi ] @xmath82 decreases with increasing density , hence with decreasing blob size @xmath77 which we have estimated directly from the intercept of the two slopes at the radius of gyration .",
    "note that @xmath77 is relatively small for the densities computed .",
    "the averages over all chains of the mean - square end - to - end distance  and the radius of gyration  are plotted versus  in fig.[fig : ravnav ] .",
    "swollen and gaussian scaling behavior are again obtained for low and strong chain overlap respectively .",
    "note that , e.g. , the chains for @xmath83 are gaussian for @xmath84 .",
    "thus the position of a particular configuration @xmath85 with respect to the crossover from dilute to semi - dilute regime can be determined .",
    "this is consistent with the value @xmath86 given in table [ tab : phie ] where @xmath87 as usual .",
    "we focus first on systems without rings , as in the rest of the paper , and consider then the effects due to the ring closure constraint by allowing linear chains and rings to compete .",
    "[ fig : mwdhigh ] displays a typical mwd @xmath71 obtained with the olmc algorithm at high density ( @xmath57 ) .",

    "note that the free monomers are counted as chains of length @xmath89 .",
    "both curves display to high accuracy nice exponentials .",
    "this is a generic result for strongly overlapping chains  even at extremely high volume fractions .",
    "notably , at variance with a recent finding @xcite no sign of singularity is observed .    in order to corroborate this result",
    "we try to scale the mwd obtained for different densities and scission energies . in fig.[fig :",
    "mwdscal ] we have plotted the ( properly normalized ) mwd versus the natural scaling variable @xmath1 . in the high density limit ( main figure ) data from two densities at various scission energies @xmath3 ( as indicated in the figure ) collapses on a single master distribution @xmath90 . in the dilute limit ,",
    "i.e. for the non - overlapping chains shown in the inset , we find again a data collapse , but with slightly different slope in linear - log coordinates .",
    "( obviously , for large chain length the statistics deteriorates . )",
    "how can these results be rationalized ? within a standard flory - huggins mean - field approach @xcite",
    "one may write the total free energy density as @xmath91=\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty } c(n)\\left ( \\log ( c(n))+\\mu n+{\\mbox{$f_{chain}$}}(n,\\phi , e)\\right ) .   \\label{eq : mfhyp}\\ ] ] the first term on the right is the usual translational entropy . the second term entails a lagrange multiplier which fixes the total monomer density @xmath6 .",
    "the most crucial last term encodes the free energy of a reference chain of length @xmath2 in the field created by the surrounding chains and free monomers .",
    "will in general depend on the chain length @xmath2 , the density @xmath81 and the bonded and non - bonded interaction parameters of the model studied @xcite .",
    "we have not computed here irrelevant additive terms ( such as virial terms ) which are not conjugated to @xmath71 . by functional derivation with respect",
    "to @xmath71 one readily obtains the equilibrium mwd : @xmath92 we have defined here @xmath93 and absorbed all contributions to  linear in @xmath2 within the lagrange multiplier . hence , within the mean - field approximation eq.([eq : mfhyp ] ) the mwd discussed above probes directly the free energy of an ep chain ( besides the terms linear in @xmath2 mentioned above which are fixed by the imposed density ) which essentially  renormalizes \" the scission energy @xmath3 .",
    "we infer from fig.[fig : mwdhigh ] and fig.[fig : mwdscal ] that for our ep chains  is to very high accuracy mass independent .",
    "two classical examples where this is indeed rigorously true are non - interacting rigid rods and gaussian chains @xcite .",
    "( there  is even independent of @xmath81 . )",
    "if this is the case , the mwd becomes then a pure exponential @xmath94 where the scaling variable is @xmath1 , i.e. the inverse lagrange multiplier equals the mean - chain length , @xmath95 .",
    "this is in agreement with our scaling in the high density limit which implies that  is within numerical accuracy independent of @xmath2 .",
    "we have explicitly checked that here the mwd scales like @xmath96 where  only depends on @xmath81 .",
    "the slightly different slope found in the dilute regime suggests , however , a weak mass effect .",
    "it is relatively simple to understand these results from the standard theory of polymers in good solvent solutions @xcite .",
    "there the chemical potential of ends is given by @xmath97 where @xmath98 is size of the blob , i.e. the excluded volume correlation length for chains of length @xmath2 at density @xmath99 .",
    "in the semi - dilute limit we have @xmath100@xcite ( @xmath101 denotes the number of monomers within a blob ) , hence @xmath102 is independent of mass and scission energy .",
    "the constant reference density @xmath103 was introduced here for dimensional reasons .",
    "obviously , eq.([eq : fendhighdensity ] ) can strictly hold only in the asymptotic limit of large blob sizes ( @xmath104 ) .",
    "additionally , one can not exclude weak chain - length dependence of  at @xmath105 , but this becomes irrelevant in the scaling limit of @xmath106 @xcite .    in the opposite dilute limit",
    "the correlation length becomes density independent and is given by the size of the chain @xmath107 .",
    "hence , @xmath108 and the mwd becomes the schultz - zimm form given in the introduction ( eq.[eq : mwd_gm ] ) .",
    "note that the @xmath109-exponent in 3d is only slightly larger than its mean field value @xmath110 .",
    "hence , the predicted power law depletion in the mwd for small @xmath2 is very weak and requires a relatively large mean chain mass @xmath106 this is why within the range of the parameters accessible essentially only the slightly different exponential tail @xmath111 is visible .",
    "obviously , some of our simulations are in the intermediate regime ( @xmath112 ) between these limiting cases ( depicted by the two slopes in fig.[fig : mwdscal ] ) . in order to characterize all the mwd with one parameter we fitted the tail of @xmath113 with @xmath114 where both @xmath115 and  are fit parameters . in the dense limit",
    "naturally one finds @xmath116 .",
    "as soon as the overlap decreases @xmath117 . note that the -variation with @xmath3 for given @xmath81 is weak and we have only tabulated the value for the highest @xmath3 , i.e. for the most strongly overlapping chains .",
    "the values are given in tab.[tab : phi ] and are discussed in the subsequent section[sec : nav ] .",
    "first we briefly assess the importance of the ring closure constraint .",
    "we allow the formation of rings so that both linear chains and rings may coexist and compete for the monomers . in fig.[fig :",
    "mwdring ] we present the mwd of rings @xmath118 and of linear chains @xmath119 at density @xmath120 and @xmath75 .",
    "the linear chains appear to be unaffected by the presence of rings and scale , as before , @xmath121 where the slope @xmath122 is given by the inverse of the mean mass of the _ linear _ chains @xmath123 .",
    "this can be easily understood by generalizing the flory - huggins expression eq.([eq : mfhyp ] ) as a sum over the two different species @xmath124 .",
    "the two different mwd decouple and the functional derivation with respect to both yields simply @xmath125 for both species in analogy with eq.([eq : cn ] ) .",
    "the free energy of the linear chain is @xmath126  as before . in the strong overlap regime @xmath127",
    "becomes again independent of mass @xmath2 ( hence , the pure exponential seen for @xmath119 ) and , as a matter of fact , equals the density dependent value @xmath128 obtained for the purely linear systems which is tabulated in tab.[tab : phi ] .",
    "therefore the mean mass of linear chains determines once again the chemical potential @xmath122 .    however , our systems of _ flexible _ rings appear to be ring dominated , i.e. much more monomers are contained in closed loops than in linear chains , as expected .",
    "in contrast in systems of semi - flexible polymer chains the formation of rings is going to be strongly suppressed @xcite .",
    "the mwd of rings is not exponential , but rather shows a clearly pronounced power law behavior @xmath15 where @xmath129 .",
    "( this does not exclude , however , a final exponential cut - off , which can hardly be detected because of the dominating power law . )",
    "the exponent @xmath130 can be obtained by a simple argument due to porte @xcite .",
    "the ratio of both mwd gives the ratio of the two partition functions @xmath131",
    "@xmath132    the ratio @xmath133 is equal to the probability of opening a loop , which must be proportional to : ( i ) the boltzmann weight , @xmath53 , due to the constant scission energy , ( ii ) the number of places where the ring can break , @xmath2 , and ( iii ) the volume @xmath134 that two neighboring  segments can explore after being disconnected ( @xmath135 denotes the dimension and @xmath136 the relevant flory exponent at density @xmath6 ) .",
