    "the mystery of the ultra - high energy cosmic rays ( uhecrs ) with energies exceeding @xmath0  ev  the greisen - zatsepin - kuzmin ( gzk ) ` cutoff ' @xcite  continues to deepen .",
    "this energy sets the threshold for photomeson production on the cosmic microwave background so the observation of such uhecrs ( assumed to be protons or heavier nuclei ) would indicate that the sources are relatively nearby , within the local supercluster of galaxies @xcite .",
    "recent observations by the hires air fluorescence detector @xcite are however inconsistent with previously published data from the akeno giant air shower array ( agasa ) which ruled out such a cutoff with a significance @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "hires has reported only 1 event above @xmath2  ev , whereas about 20 would have been expected on the basis of the agasa spectrum .",
    "the two spectra can be made to agree _ below _ this energy , if the energies of the agasa events are systematically lowered by 20% ( within the quoted uncertainty ) , however 5 of them still remain above this energy @xcite .",
    "subsequently the agasa collaboration have carefully assessed their energy measurement uncertainties and reaffirmed that their observed spectrum does extend well beyond the gzk energy @xcite .",
    "to resolve this situation requires making simultaneous measurements using both the air shower and air fluorescence methods ; such measurements are underway at the pierre auger observatory being constructed in argentina @xcite .",
    "another development has been the agasa observation that the uhecr arrival directions , although consistent with isotropy overall , exhibit clustering on small angular scales @xcite . among the 59 agasa events above @xmath3  ev , there are 5 ` doublets ' and 1 ` triplet ' with separation angle less than the estimated angular resolution of @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "ev , 68% have a reconstructed arrival direction within @xmath5 of the true direction and 90% within @xmath6 ; the corresponding angles for all events above @xmath7  ev are @xmath8 and @xmath9 , keeping in mind that the energy resolution is @xmath10 @xcite . ] the probability for this to arise by chance from an isotropic distribution is less than 0.1% .",
    "however this probability is very sensitive to the assumed angular resolution @xcite , e.g. increasing to @xmath11 if the angular resolution is @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "moreover adding data from three other air shower experiments ( volcano ranch , haverah park , and yakutsk ) _ dilutes _ the significance . in an earlier such analysis @xcite , 8 doublets and 2 triplets",
    "were found in a dataset of 47 agasa plus 45 other events with @xmath12  ev , taking the effective angular resolution of the dataset to be @xmath13 .",
    "the chance probability for this to arise from an uniform distribution is @xmath14 , thus statistically not significant .",
    "nevertheless , the existence of such clusters has been linked to the possibility of ( repeating ) point sources of uhecr @xcite , specifically cosmologically distant bl lacertae @xcite  a sub - class of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) which have been long discussed as possible accelerators of uhecrs @xcite .",
    "however the expected deflections of uhecrs ( assumed to be charged particles ) by galactic and intergalactic magnetic fields ought to smear out such tight source correlations @xcite .",
    "contrary to these results , it has been claimed recently that the correlations with bl lacs are preserved , even improved , if the uhecrs are protons , after allowing for deflections by the galactic magnetic field @xcite .",
    "little is known about the intergalactic magnetic field @xcite ; requiring rectilinear propagation of protons over the attenuation length of @xmath15  mpc at @xmath12  ev ( decreasing to @xmath16  mpc at @xmath17  ev @xcite ) would imply that its homogeneous component on such scales is extremely weak : @xmath18  g @xcite .",
    "it has also been claimed @xcite that such clustering is predicted in a model where the uhecr arise from the decay of superheavy relic particles accumulated in the galactic halo @xcite , due to the expected clumping of halo dark matter .    in this paper",
    "we examine both these claims in detail , using as our basic statistical tool the two - point correlation function .",
    "our intention is to determine whether the claimed correlations are meaningful , given the present limited event statistics .",
    "it is natural to look for correlations between the observed uhecr arrival directions and plausible astrophysical sources , however it is essential to take care not to generate spurious correlations by introducing biases .",
    "for example it has been claimed that the 5 highest energy events with @xmath17  ev are all aligned with compact radio - loud quasars ( crqsos ) having redshifts between 0.3 and 2.2 , and the chance probability for this coincidence was estimated to be 0.5% @xcite .",
    "however this rises to 3% when the event used to formulate the hypothesis itself ( the previously noted @xcite alignment of the quasar 3c147 with the @xmath19  ev fly s eye event @xcite ) is excluded from the sample @xcite .",
    "a careful recent analysis @xcite based on an updated event list ( 5 agasa @xcite , 4 haverah park @xcite and 1 fly s eye @xcite ) demonstrates that there are _ no _ significant correlations between uhecrs and crqsos .",
    "these authors show also that another recent claim @xcite of significant correlations with crqsos is based on inadequate data , and , in addition , that there are _ no _ significant correlations with an interesting sub - group of these sources , viz .",
    "@xmath20-ray blazars @xcite .",
    "a correlation between events with @xmath12  ev and nearby galaxies likely to host quasar remnants ( qrs ) has also been found at the @xmath21 level , although this disappears if attention is restricted to events above @xmath2  ev @xcite .    what has revived",
    "interest in the possibility of such correlations is the claimed clustering in the arrival directions of uhecrs @xcite .",
    "this may arise for example if the sources are ` compact ' ( i.e. smaller than the experimental angular resolution ) with the clusters corresponding to more than one uhecr being received from the _ same _ source . since the number of events in such clusters is much smaller than the total number of events , the majority of such sources have clearly not been seen at all .",
    "however it is possible to estimate their number density using poisson statistics . allowing for the attenuation of uhecrs from distant sources due to gzk energy losses , the observed occurences of `",
    "triplets ' and ` doublets ' relative to the number of single events was used to estimate the spatial density of such sources to be @xmath22 mpc@xmath23 @xcite .",
    "this would obviously place stringent constraints on candidate astrophysical sources , e.g. @xmath20-ray bursts ( grbs ) have a spatial density of only @xmath24 mpc@xmath23 .",
    "however a more careful analysis @xcite shows that the uncertainties in this estimate are very large .",
    "the true number is @xmath25 mpc@xmath23 at the 68% ( 95% ) c.l . ;",
    "moreover relaxing the assumptions made , viz .",
    "that the sources all have the same luminosity and a spectrum @xmath26 , increases the allowed range even further , e.g. to @xmath27 mpc@xmath23 for a schechter luminosity function and a spectrum @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "clearly the present limited event numbers do _ not _ permit any candidate class of sources to be definitively excluded .",
    "note that the observed clustering may also arise because of a higher density of local sources in certain directions , e.g. due to the clumpiness of halo dark matter in the decaying dark matter model .",
    "the next step taken was the construction of the angular autocorrelation function of uhecrs @xcite .",
    "for the agasa data this displays a clear peak at separation angles less than @xmath4 , consistent with the point spread function @xcite . moreover the chance probability estimated by monte carlo to match or exceed the observed count in the first angular bin , when plotted versus energy , is seen to have a minimum at @xmath29 ; the peak in the autocorrelation function for @xmath12  ev is stated to have a significance of 4.6@xmath30 @xcite .",
    "an equally significant autocorrelation was claimed using a different method of analysing the data in which a ` triplet ' was taken to correspond to three or two ` doublets ' depending on whether the events are bunched together or linearly aligned @xcite .",
    "these authors found the probability for chance coincidences to be minimum for events above @xmath31  ev in the agasa data @xcite , and above @xmath32  ev in the yakutsk data @xcite . restricting attention to events above these energies , the chance probability for the observed clustering in the first angular bin was quoted as @xmath33 for agasa and @xmath34 for yakutsk , taking @xmath4 and @xmath13 respectively for the size of the first bin , corresponding to the respective experimental angular resolutions @xcite .      motivated by the results quoted above which implicate compact sources for uhecrs , tinyakov & tkachev @xcite",
    "have proposed that the sources are in fact bl lacs .",
    "the physical motivation they provided for this is that only agns in which the central jet points towards us  ` blazars '  are likely to be uhecr sources ( since particles accelerated in a relativistic jet are strongly beamed ) , and among all blazars , bl lacs in particular have few emission lines in their spectra , indicating low density of ambient matter and radiation , thus presumably more favorable conditions for particle acceleration .",
    "tinyakov & tkachev @xcite used a catalogue of agns and quasars containing 306 confirmed ( out of 462 listed ) bl lacs @xcite .",
    "they asserted that since the ability of bl lacs to accelerate uhecrs may be correlated with optical and radio emissions , it would be appropriate to select the most _ powerful _ bl lacs by imposing cuts on redshift , apparent magnitude and 6  cm radio flux .",
    "in fact the redshift is unknown for over half of all confirmed bl lacs but they assumed that all such bl lacs are at @xmath35 and included them in the sample anyway . by imposing the cuts @xmath36 ( or unknown ) , @xmath37 , and @xmath38  jy , they selected a sample of 22 bl lacs .",
    "they considered 39 agasa events with @xmath39  ev and 26 yakutsk events with @xmath40  ev , the energy cuts being motivated by their earlier autocorrelation analysis @xcite which had indicated that the small - angle clustering of uhecrs is most pronounced above these energies in the respective datasets . assuming that the event energies are not important for small angle correlations , they combined these into one set of 65 events .",
    "then they computed the correlation between the arrival directions of these uhecrs and the selected 22 bl lacs , finding a significant number of coincidences .",
    "eight uhecrs were found to be within @xmath4 of 5 bl lacs , the chance probability of which is only @xmath41 .",
    "note that these events are all _ below _ the gzk cutoff .",
    "moreover the uncertainty in the arrival direction of yakutsk events is @xmath13 at @xmath3  ev , and even higher at lower energies , so these close alignments are unlikely to be physically significant . ]",
    "the authors acknowledged that the imposition of the arbitrary cuts made on the bl lac catalogue can affect the significance of this result and estimated the ` penalty factor ' to be about 15 ; however the significance of the coincidences taking this into account was then quoted as @xmath42 ( implying a penalty factor of only 3 ) @xcite .",
    "this was the basis for their claim that bl lacs are the probable sources of uhecrs .",
    "since these are cosmologically distant sources , it is pertinent to ask how the uhecrs get to the earth .",
    "initially tinyakov & tkachev @xcite inferred that the primaries have to be neutral , i.e. photons or neutrinos ( unless the gzk effect is inoperative because of violation of lorentz invariance ) .",
    "however in subsequent work @xcite they found that the correlations are _ improved _ if the primaries are assumed to be protons , whose trajectories are modified by the galactic magnetic field ( gmf ) . in this work",
    "they used the full set of 57 agasa events with @xmath12  ev ( but no yakutsk events ) and allowed for deflections by the regular component of the gmf ( but ignored the fluctuating component which is in fact of comparable strength @xcite ) , while assuming that deflections by intergalactic magnetic fields ( igmf ) are _ negligible_. the same bl lac catalogue @xcite was used but this time no cuts were made on redshift or the 6  cm radio flux , only on the apparent magnitude ( @xmath37 ) since this maximised the correlations .",
    "it was found that 18 bl lacs then lie within @xmath4 of the reconstructed arrival directions of 22 uhecrs , if these mainly have charge + 1 ( however 8 might alternatively be neutral and 4 must be neutral ) .",
    "of these 18 bl lacs , only 6 have measured redshifts and these authors now proposed @xcite , contrary to their previous supposition , that the rest must in fact have redshifts _ less than _ 0.1 in order that the protons they emit can overcome the gzk losses and reach the earth . )",
    "is near enough to be a possible source of the @xmath43 ev event ( assumed to be charge + 1 ) it is associated with ; the other object ( txs  0806 + 315 , @xmath44 ) which is also closely aligned with this event is probably too far on the basis of uhecr propagation calculations @xcite .",
    "the remaining 4 pairings are also implausible  these are rx  j1058.6 + 5628 ( @xmath45 ) aligned with a ` doublet ' ( charge 0 ) having energies @xmath46 ev , tex  1428 + 370 ( @xmath47 ) aligned with an event ( charge + 1 ) of energy @xmath48 ev , 1es  1853 + 671 ( @xmath49 ) aligned with an event ( charge + 1 ) of energy @xmath50 ev , and exo  1118.0 + 4228 ( @xmath51 ) aligned with an event ( charge 0 or + 1 ) of energy @xmath52 ev .",
    "we have estimated distances from the redshifts using the mattig formula , @xmath53 $ ] , indicated by measurements of cosmological parameters .",
    "] they asserted further @xcite that their success at finding significant correlations between bl lacs and uhecrs in this manner confirmed that bl lacs are the sources , _ as well _ as validating their adopted model of the gmf , _ and _ their assumption that there are no significant deflections due to the igmf .",
    "moreover tinyakov & tkachev @xcite noted that many of these 22 bl lacs are x - ray sources . in subsequent work",
    "@xcite , an updated catalogue of qsos containing 350 confirmed bl lacs @xcite was examined for correlations with the third egret catalogue of @xmath20-ray sources @xcite and 14 were identified as strong @xmath20-ray emitters ( of which 8 were known to be so already ) .",
    "correlations between these 14 bl lacs and the set of 39 agasa plus 26 yakutsk events selected earlier @xcite were then studied , again allowing for deflections by the gmf modelled as in earlier work @xcite .",
    "it was found that there are 13 possible coincidences within @xmath54 ( for charge 0 or + 1 ) with a chance probability of @xmath55 @xcite . leaving out the 2 bl lacs that are invisible to the northern hemisphere cosmic ray experiments ,",
    "8 of the remaining 12 are found to be along the ( reconstructed ) arrival directions of uhecrs .",
    "it was concluded @xcite that @xmath20-ray emission is the physical criterion for a bl lac to be a uhecr source .",
    "however uhecrs are known _ not _ to correlate with @xmath20-ray blazars @xcite .",
    "it was stated that there is no contradiction because the bl lacs considered display a low degree of polarisation whereas @xmath20-ray blazars are highly polarised @xcite .",
    "given this set of interesting claims we wish to ascertain to what extent the strong correlations found depend on the selection criteria used .",
    "to do so we calculate the correlation function in the same manner as tinyakov & tkachev @xcite and use monte carlo simulations to determine the probability of chance coincidences .",
    "we consider four cases using the agasa data @xcite ; we do not consider the yakutsk data @xcite because the events which contribute dominantly to the correlations found earlier @xcite have energies _ below _ the gzk cutoff , where the uncertainty in the arrival directions exceeds @xmath13 , so the correlations found at smaller angles can not be meaningful .",
    "our 4 models correspond to considering :    \\(1 ) the 39 uhecr with @xmath39  ev @xcite and 22 bl lacs selected by the tinyakov & tkachev criteria @xcite ,    \\(2 ) the full set of 57 uhecr with @xmath12  ev @xcite , but retaining the cuts on the bl lacs @xcite ,    \\(3 ) the full set of 57 uhecr with @xmath12  ev @xcite and the full set of 306 bl lacs with no cuts @xcite ,    \\(4 ) the full set of 57 uhecr with @xmath12  ev @xcite and 915 grbs @xcite .",
    "the last case is a control to determine whether there are equally significant correlations with other suggested sources of uhecrs at cosmological distances , which are _ not _ expected to contribute events beyond the gzk cutoff @xcite .    in figure",
    "[ fig : skybl ] we plot the positions on the sky ( hammer - aitoff projections in equatorial coordinates ) of both the uhecrs and the selected objects in order to give a visual impression of how the coincidences arise , particularly for the ` doublets ' and ` triplet ' in the agasa data .",
    "the two - point correlation function for the four cases are shown in figure  [ fig:2pbl ] , calculated according to the tinyakov & tkachev prescription @xcite , adopting the same angular bin size of @xmath4 . to determine the significance of these correlations we run @xmath56 monte carlo simulations , as they did , to calculate the probability of chance coincidences .",
    "it is evident that while there is indeed a @xmath57 correlation between uhecrs and bl lacs if suitable cuts are employed @xcite , the significance weakens to @xmath58 if the energy cut is relaxed , and _ disappears _ if the cuts on bl lacs are also relaxed .",
    "thus there is _ no _ basis for the claim that bl lacs are the sources of uhecrs ; indeed cosmologically distant grbs correlate just as well with post - gzk uhecrs as do bl lacs",
    "!    c    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]      of the correlations.,width=283,height=245 ]    let us start by presenting different properties of the clump populations generated according to the recipes of blasi & sheth and ourselves . for a galaxy halo , we have typically the same numbers of clumps ( @xmath59 ) in both models . with our prescription ,",
    "the clumps tend to be smaller in extent which makes their detection more difficult . however , the main difference is in the distribution of clumps with galactocentric radius , as shown in figure  [ fig : histgc ] . in blasi &",
    "sheth s model , the peak in the radial distribution of the clumps occurs at @xmath60  kpc , which is close to the solar circle .",
    "this is of course optimum for causing visible consequences . in our model ,",
    "the peak occurs at 220 kpc , very much in the outer parts of the galaxy halo .",
    "let use remark that the numerical simulations clearly show that most of the surviving substructure _ is _ in the outer parts .",
    "both nfw and sis profiles are singular at the origin , so a small regularizing core radius must be included in the computations .",
    "for the nfw profiles , we take our cue from our earlier paper @xcite where the regularizing core @xmath61 was chosen as @xmath62 kpc ( the resolution limit ) for a halo of @xmath63  kpc extent . for the nfw clumps ,",
    "@xmath61 is scaled to be the same fraction of the extent . for the sis profiles ,",
    "we adopt @xmath64  kpc , as suggested by the limit imposed by particle dark matter self - annihilation @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : skyag ] shows the incoming uhecr flux in a hamer - aitoff projection in equatorial coordinates folded with the response of the agasa detector .",
    "the flux from the underlying smooth model is calculated by integrating the emissivity density along the line of sight ( see e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) . however , the angular size of clumps can be smaller than the angular resolution of the instrument , in which case the flux is computed by the volume integral of the emissivity over the clump , divided by the square of the distance of the clump from earth . there are four panels showing random arrival directions , a smooth nfw galactic halo , a smooth nfw halo plus nfw clumps and a smooth halo plus sis clumps .",
    "the grey region corresponds to no detection , as agasa is a northern hemisphere experiment .",
    "the lower right panel shows irregularities , caused by the sis clumps which are brighter than any contribution from the underlying smooth halo .",
    "the lower left panel corresponding to nfw clumps shows much less evidence for irregularities .",
    "the flux is much more uniform with less clustering .",
    "we can not verify the claim made by blasi & sheth that a smooth nfw halo alone is able to provide almost half the observed clustering @xcite .",
    "in fact , it is hard to see how a smooth halo can be responsible for small scale flux variations .    to quantify this",
    ", we use the 58 events in the agasa experiment above @xmath3ev as our dataset .",
    "the two point autocorrelation function for the four cases is shown in figure  [ fig : tp25 ]",
    ". samples of 58 uhecrs , with the agasa response function folded in , are generated , and the average autocorrelation is compared to the one found for the experimental data .",
    "the clustering in the experimental dataset is not well reproduced . even when sis clumps are present , the disagreement is at the @xmath65 level and it is beyond @xmath21 for the other models .",
    "we also note from panels ( a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) that the smooth nfw profile ( with or without clumps ) is almost indistinguishable from the isotropic model .",
    "table  [ table : probs ] gives the explicit probabilities deduced from @xmath56 monte carlo calculations .",
    "we see that in the first three models , we fall short of obtaining the 8 clusters required as less than 2 are expected on average .",
    "the probability of obtaining 8 or more clumps is of order @xmath66 .",
    "when sis clumps are introduced in the halo , however , the probability increases to 0.056 .",
    "note that , in every case , the discrepancy between model predictions and experiment is always less than @xmath67 .",
    "the angular width of each bin was taken to be @xmath4 in the calculations reported above .",
    "if this is enlarged to @xmath68 , then the discrepancies between model predictions and data are smaller .",
    "this is a reasonable angular size on which to look for correlations as it corresponds to the typical deflection of a @xmath3  ev proton in the galactic magnetic field @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : tp5 ] shows the autocorrelation functions for the cases of isotropic arrival directions and for a smooth nfw halo with nfw clumps .",
    "we expect typically 6 and 7 clusters for these two cases .",
    "the probability of obtaining as many clusters as the experimental data ( 11 ) rises to 0.06 and 0.07 respectively .",
    "note that , even for the isotropic model , the discrepancy is now at only the @xmath69 level .",
    "the dependence of the probability on the bin width is shown in figure  [ fig : bina ] for the model with nfw clumps in an nfw halo .",
    "it reaches a minimum around @xmath4 .",
    "this is where the discrepancy with the data is at a maximum .",
    "either decreasing or increasing @xmath70 gives model predictions in better agreement with the data .",
    "so , this figure shows how sensitive the clustering results are to the bin width .",
    "for example , changing @xmath4 to @xmath6 causes almost an order of magnitude change in the probability .    using the 92 events from the combined datasets of agasa , volcano ranch , haverah park and yakutsk",
    "@xcite , blasi & sheth estimated that the probability of attaining more doublets than the data from sis clumps is 12% ( for @xmath6 bin widths ) and and 47% ( for @xmath13 ) .",
    "these high numbers appear to be primarily a consequence of placing the sis clumps nearby . using our model for the mass and spatial distribution of the clumps",
    ", we obtain corresponding probabilities of 7% ( for @xmath6 ) and 29% ( for @xmath13 ) .",
    "if the clumps have an nfw profile as is more likely , these numbers are reduced further to 3.5% and 15% respectively .",
    "we conclude that clustering is _ not _ a generic prediction of the decaying dark matter model .",
    "even though clumps are indeed expected in the dark matter distributions in galaxy haloes , any clustering of uhecrs depends sensitively on the density profile of the clumps .",
    "in particular , nfw clumps do not give rise to much clustering , but sis clumps may do so .",
    "however , sis profiles are not very natural , and almost all the signal comes from the @xmath71 singularity .",
    "in fact , the self - similarity of the structure formation process suggests that nfw clumps are more natural .",
    "we note that the 10% of mass that we placed in clumps is already generous , and so it is not clear whether any real clustering of uhecrs can be expected from dark matter substructure .",
    "however , it is also not clear that there is any real clustering of the uhecrs at all , as the signal is less than @xmath72 at the most natural angular scale of @xmath73 .",
    "it has been a general expectation that it should be possible to identify the long - sought sources of cosmic rays at energies exceeding @xmath74  ev , when their arrival directions can no longer be randomised by galactic magnetic fields .",
    "however the sky distribution has remained consistent with isotropy up to the highest energies observed .",
    "it is clear that at such energies the sources can not be in the disk of the galaxy and all experiments indicate that the energy spectrum of such sources is significantly flatter than the component at lower energies .",
    "however it is not clear whether the isotropy of arrival directions implicates a relatively _ local _ population of sources in the galactic halo ( e.g. decaying supermassive dark matter ) or a cosmologically _ distant _ population of astrophysical accelerators ( e.g. active galaxies or @xmath20-ray bursts ) .",
    "support for the latter possibility has come from the new hires data which shows a cutoff in the spectrum beyond @xmath75  ev , as has long been expected for extragalactic sources .",
    "however the agasa collaboration has reaffirmed that there is no gzk cutoff in their data , which strongly favours the former possibility .",
    "given this confusing situation , the indication of small - angle clustering in the agasa data has naturally been seized upon as a possible further clue as to the nature of the sources .",
    "it has been argued both that the clusters coincide with a specific class of extragalactic objects , viz .",
    "bl lacs @xcite , and , alternatively , that such clustering might arise due to the expected clumping of halo dark matter @xcite .",
    "the bl lac hypthesis is in fact _ inconsistent _ with the absence of the gzk cutoff in the same agasa data since many of the identified objects are at very large distances .",
    "hence it appeared more plausible that the sources are clumps of dark matter in the galactic halo ( composed in part of supermassive decaying particles ) which would explain the absence of the gzk cutoff .",
    "we have shown that the correlations claimed between bl lacs and the observed clusters of uhecrs are spurious , being entirely due to selection effects .",
    "this is not the first time that such correlations with a particular class of astrophysical accelerators has been claimed ; the moral is clearly that care must be taken to not become intrigued by weak accidental correlations and then make arbitrary cuts on the dataset to emphasise them further .",
    "we have also found that the extent to which dark matter may be clumped in the halo is not sufficient to generate the observed small - angle clustering , if the uhecrs indeed arise from decaying dark matter . here",
    "the proponents have been misled due to the use of an unphysical density profile for the clumps , as well as a radial distribution in the galaxy which is inconsistent with the general expectations for hierarchical structure formation .",
    "the net result of our investigations is thus rather negative .",
    "the claimed small - angle clustering in the arrival directions of post - gzk uhecrs does not definitively implicate either extragalactic compact sources such as bl lacs , or decaying clumps of dark matter in the galactic halo . on the positive side , the forthcoming increase in statistics from the pierre auger observatory will enable us to identify the expected signal from dark matter decays if this is indeed the source of uhecrs .",
    "moreover auger will also definitively resolve the current contradiction between the air shower and atmospheric fluorescence methods for energy measurement , thus clarifying whether the spectrum does have a gzk cutoff .",
    "if so , searches for coincidences with cosmologically distant candidate sources such as active galaxies or @xmath20-ray bursts would be of interest . again",
    "the increased statistics provided by auger would enable the significance of such coincidences to be meaningfully assessed .",
    "we will soon know whether the mystery of uhecrs implicates astrophysical sources or new physics beyond the standard model .",
    "we are grateful to motohiko nagano and alan watson for discussions and for providing uhecr data sets , and to ben moore for clarifications of the results obtained in numerical simulations of halo substructure .",
    "we also thank pascuale blasi , ravi sheth and igor tkachev for helpful correspondance .",
    "1truecm note added in proof : while this paper was being refereed , a preprint ( astro - ph/0301336 ) by tinyakov and tkachev appeared claiming that our critique of their work is not justified .",
    "they calculate that the ` penalty ' for making a - posteriori cuts on the bl lac and uhecr catalogues reduces the significance of the coincidences they find by only a factor of 15 .",
    "however as our monte carlo simulations demonstrate directly , this is a vast underestimate and in fact the claimed coincidences are likely to have arisen just by chance .",
