    "this paper develops a new algorithm for graphical models based on the mathematical foundation for statistical models proposed in @xcite .",
    "its relevance for computational biology can be summarized as follows :    * ( a ) graphical models are a unifying statistical framework for biological sequence analysis .",
    "*    * ( b ) parametric inference is important for obtaining biologically meaningful results . *    * ( c ) the polytope propagation algorithm solves the parametric inference problem . *",
    ".1 cm    thesis ( a ) states that graphical models are good models for biological sequences .",
    "this emerging understanding is the result of practical success with probabilistic algorithms , and also the observation that inference algorithms for graphical models subsume many apparently non - statistical methods .",
    "a noteworthy example of the latter is the explanation of classic alignment algorithms such as needleman - wunsch and smith - waterman in terms of the viterbi algorithm for pair hidden markov models @xcite .",
    "graphical models are now used for many problems including motif detection , gene finding , alignment , phylogeny reconstruction and protein structure prediction .",
    "for example , most gene prediction methods are now hidden markov model ( hmm ) based , and previously non - probabilistic methods now have hmm based re - implementations .    in typical applications ,",
    "biological sequences are modeled as _ observed random variables _",
    "@xmath0 in a graphical model .",
    "the observed random variables may correspond to sequence elements such as nucleotides or amino acids . _",
    "hidden random variables _",
    "@xmath1 encode information of interest that is unknown , but which one would like to infer .",
    "for example , the information could be an annotation , alignment or ancestral sequence in a phylogenetic tree .",
    "one of the strengths of graphical models is that by virtue of being probabilistic , they can be combined into powerful models where the hidden variables are more complex .",
    "for example , hidden markov models can be combined with pair hidden markov models to simultaneously align and annotate sequences @xcite .",
    "one of the drawbacks of such approaches is that the models have more parameters and as a result inferences could be less robust .    for a fixed observed sequence @xmath2 and _ fixed parameters _ , the standard inference problems are :    1 .   the calculation of _ marginal probabilities _ : @xmath3 2 .   the calculation of _ maximum a posteriori log probabilities _ : @xmath4    where the @xmath5 range over all the possible assignments for the hidden random variables @xmath6 . in practice , it is the solution to problem 2 that is of interest , since it is the one that solves the problem of finding the genes in a genome or the `` best '' alignment for a pair of sequences .",
    "a shortcoming of this approach is that the solution @xmath7 may vary considerably with a change in parameters .",
    "thesis ( b ) suggests that a _ parametric _ solution to the inference problem can help in ascertaining the reliability , robustness and biological meaning of an inference result . by _",
    "parametric inference _ we mean the solution of problem 2 for all model parameters simultaneously . in this way we can decide",
    "if a solution obtained for particular parameters is an artifact or is largely independent of the chosen parameters .",
    "this approach has already been applied successfully to the problem of pairwise sequence alignment in which parameter choices are known to be crucial in obtaining good alignments @xcite .",
    "our aim is to develop this approach for arbitrary graphical models . in thesis ( c )",
    "we claim that the polytope propagation algorithm is efficient for solving the parametric inference problem , and , in certain cases is not much slower than solving problem 2 for fixed parameters .",
    "the algorithm is a geometric version of the sum - product algorithm , which is the standard tool for inference with graphical models .",
    "the mathematical setting for understanding the polytope propagation algorithm is _",
    "tropical geometry_. the connection between tropical geometry and parametric inference in statistical models is developed in the companion paper @xcite .",
    "here we describe the details of the polytope propagation algorithm ( section 3 ) in two familiar settings : the hidden markov model for annotation ( section 2 ) and the pair hidden markov model for alignment ( section 4 ) .",
    "finally , in section 5 , we discuss some practical aspects of parametric inference , such as specializing parameters , the construction of single cones which eliminates the need for identifying all possible maximum a posteriori explanations , and the relevance of our findings to bayesian computations .",
    "hidden markov models play a central role in sequence analysis , where they are widely used to annotate dna sequences @xcite .",
    "a simple example is the cpg island annotation problem @xcite .",
    "cpg sites are locations in dna sequences where the nucleotide cytosine ( c ) is situated next to a guanine ( g ) nucleotide ( the `` p '' comes from the fact that a phosphate links them together )",
    ". there are regions with many cpg sites in eukaryotic genomes , and these are of interest because of the action of dna methyltransferase , which recognizes cpg sites and converts the cytosine into 5-methylcytosine .",
    "spontaneous deamination causes the 5-methylcytosine to be converted into thymine ( t ) , and the mutation is not fixed by dna repair mechanisms .",
    "this results in a gradual erosion of cpg sites in the genome .",
    "_ cpg islands _ are regions of dna with many unmethylated cpg sites .",
    "spontaneous deamination of cytosine to thymine in these sites is repaired , resulting in a restored cpg site .",
    "the computational identification of cpg islands is important , because they are associated with promoter regions of genes , and are known to be involved in gene silencing .",
    "unfortunately , there is no sequence characterization of cpg islands .",
    "a generally accepted definition due to gardiner - garden and frommer @xcite is that a cpg island is a region of dna at least 200bp long with a g+c content of at least 50% , and with a ratio of observed to expected cpg sites of at least 0.6 .",
    "this arbitrary definition has since been refined ( e.g. @xcite ) , however even analysis of the complete sequence of the human genome @xcite has failed to reveal precise criteria for what constitutes a cpg island .",
    "hidden markov models can be used to predict cpg islands @xcite .",
    "we have selected this application of hmms in order to illustrate our approach to parametric inference in a mathematically simple setting .",
    "the cpg island hmm we consider has @xmath8 hidden binary random variables @xmath6 , and @xmath8 observed random variables @xmath9 that take on the values @xmath10 ( see figure 1 in @xcite ) . in general , an hmm can be characterized by the following conditional independence statements for @xmath11 : @xmath12 the cpg island hmm has twelve model parameters , namely , the entries of the transition matrices @xmath13 here the hidden state space has just two states non - cpg @xmath14 and cpg @xmath15 with transitions allowed between them , but in more complicated applications , such as gene finding , the state space is used to model numerous gene components ( such as introns and exons ) and the sparsity pattern of the matrix @xmath16 is crucial . in its algebraic representation @xcite , the hmm is given as the image of the polynomial map @xmath17 the inference problem 1 asks for an evaluation of one coordinate polynomial @xmath18 of the map @xmath19 .",
    "this can be done in linear time ( in @xmath8 ) using the _ forward algorithm _",
    "@xcite , which recursively evaluates the formula @xmath20 problem 2 is to identify the largest term in the expansion of @xmath18 .",
    "equivalently , if we write @xmath21 and @xmath22 then problem 2 is to evaluate the piecewise - linear function @xmath23 this formula can be efficiently evaluated by recursively computing the parenthesized expressions .",
    "this is known as the _ viterbi algorithm _ in the hmm literature .",
    "the viterbi and forward algorithms are instances of the more general _ sum - product algorithm _ @xcite .",
    "what we are proposing in this paper is to compute the collection of cones in @xmath24 on which the piecewise - linear function @xmath25 is linear .",
    "this may be feasible because the number of cones grows polynomially in @xmath8 . each cone",
    "is indexed by a binary sequence @xmath26 which represents the cpg islands found for any system of parameters @xmath27 in that cone .",
    "a binary sequence which arises in this manner is an _ explanation for @xmath28 _ in the sense of @xcite .",
    "our results in @xcite imply that the number of explanations scales polynomially with @xmath8 .",
    "for any given dna sequence @xmath28 of length @xmath8 , the number of bit strings @xmath29 which are explanations for the sequence @xmath28 in the cpg island hmm is bounded above by a constant times @xmath30 .",
    "there are a total of @xmath31 parameters which is the dimension of the ambient space .",
    "note , however , that for a fixed observed sequence the number of times the observation @xmath32 is made is fixed , and similarly for @xmath33 .",
    "furthermore , the total number of transitions in the hidden states must equal @xmath8 . together",
    ", these constraints remove five degrees of freedom .",
    "we can thus apply ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 7 ) with @xmath34 .",
    "this shows that the total number of vertices of the newton polytope of @xmath35 is @xmath36 .",
    "we explain the biological meaning of our parametric analysis with a very small example .",
    "let us consider the following special case of the cpg island hmm .",
    "first , assume that @xmath37 and that @xmath38 , i.e. , the output probability depends only on whether the nucleotide is a purine or pyrimidine .",
    "furthermore , assume that @xmath39 , which means that the probability of emitting a purine or a pyrimidine in the non - cpg island state is equal ( i.e. base composition is uniform in non - cpg islands ) .",
    "suppose that the observed sequence is @xmath40 .",
    "we ask for _ all _ the possible explanations for @xmath41 , that is , for all possible maximum a posteriori cpg island annotations for all parameters .",
    "a priori , the number of explanations is bounded by @xmath42 , the total number of binary strings of length eight . however , of the @xmath43 binary strings , only @xmath44 are explanations .",
    "figure 1 is a geometric representation of the solution to this problem : the newton polytope of @xmath18 is a @xmath45-dimensional polytope with @xmath44 vertices .",
    "the figure is a _ schlegel diagram _ of this polytope .",
    "it was drawn with the software polymake @xcite .",
    "the @xmath44 vertices in figure 1 correspond to the @xmath44 annotations , which are the explanations for @xmath28 as the parameters vary .",
    "two annotations are connected by an edge if and only if their parameter cones share a wall . from this geometric representation",
    ", we can determine all parameters which result in the same maximum a posteriori prediction .",
    "the evaluation of @xmath46 for fixed parameters using the formulation in ( [ ref : viterbi ] ) is known as the viterbi algorithm in the hmm literature .",
    "we begin by re - interpreting this algorithm as a convex optimization problem .",
    "the newton polytope of a polynomial @xmath47 is defined to be the convex hull of the lattice points in @xmath48 corresponding to the monomials in @xmath19 : @xmath49    recall that for a fixed observation there are natural polynomials associated with a graphical model , which we have been denoting by @xmath50 . in the cpg island example from section 2 , these polynomials are the coordinates @xmath18 of the polynomial map @xmath19 in ( [ polymap ] ) .",
    "each coordinate polynomial @xmath18 is the sum of @xmath51 monomials , where @xmath52 .",
    "the crucial observation is that even though the number of monomials grows exponentially with @xmath8 , the number of vertices of the newton polytope @xmath53 is much smaller .",
    "the newton polytope is important for us because its vertices represent the solutions to the inference problem 2 .",
    "[ polytopepropagation ] the maximum a posteriori log probabilities @xmath54 in problem 2 can be determined by minimizing a linear functional over the newton polytope of @xmath55 .",
    "this is nothing but a restatement of the fact that when passing to logarithms , monomials in the parameters become linear functions in the logarithms of the parameters .",
    "our main result in this section is an algorithm which we state in the form of a theorem .",
    "let @xmath50 be the polynomial associated to a fixed observation @xmath28 from a graphical model .",
    "the list of all vertices of the newton polytope of @xmath50 can be computed efficiently by recursive convex hull and minkowski sum computations on unions of polytopes .",
    "observe that if @xmath56 are polynomials then @xmath57 where the @xmath58 on the right hand side denotes the minkowski sum of the two polytopes .",
    "similarly , @xmath59 if @xmath60 and @xmath61 are polynomials with positive coefficients . the recursive description of @xmath62 given in ( [ sum - product ] ) can be used to evaluate the newton polytope efficiently .",
    "the necessary geometric primitives are precisely minkowski sum and convex hull of unions of convex polytopes .",
    "these primitives run in polynomial time since the dimension of the polytopes is fixed .",
    "this is the case in our situation since we consider graphical models with a fixed number of parameters .",
    "we can hence run the sum - product algorithm efficiently in the semiring known as the _ polytope algebra_. the size of the output scales polynomially by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* thm .  7 ) .",
    "figure 2 shows an example of the polytope propagation algorithm for a hidden markov model with all random variables binary and with the following transition and output matrices : @xmath63 here we specialized to only two parameters in order to simplify the diagram .",
    "when we run polytope propagation for long enough dna sequences @xmath28 in the cpg island hmm of section 2 with all @xmath64 free parameters , we get a diagram just like figure 2 , but with each polygon replaced by a seven - dimensional polytope .",
    "it is useful to note that for hmms , the minkowski sum operations are simply shifts of the polytopes , and therefore the only non - trivial geometric operations required are the convex hulls of unions of polytopes .",
    "the polytope in figure 1 was computed using polytope propagation .",
    "this polytope has dimension @xmath45 ( rather than @xmath65 ) because the sequence @xmath40 is so short .",
    "we wish to emphasize that the small size of our examples is only for clarity ; there is no practical or theoretical barrier to computing much larger instances .    for general graphical models ,",
    "the running time of the minkowski sum and convex hull computations depends on the number of parameters , and the number of vertices in each computation .",
    "these are clearly bounded by the total number of vertices of @xmath66 , which are bounded above by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 7 ) : @xmath67 here @xmath68 is the number of edges in the graphical model ( often linear in the number of vertices of the model ) .",
    "the dimension @xmath69 of the newton polytope @xmath53 is fixed because it is bounded above by the number of model parameters .",
    "the total running time of the polytope propagation algorithm can then be estimated by multiplying the running time for the geometric operations of minkowski sum and convex hull with the running time of the sum - product algorithm .",
    "in any case , the running time scales polynomially in @xmath68 .",
    "we have shown in @xcite that the vertices of @xmath66 correspond to explanations for the observation @xmath28 . in parametric inference",
    "we are interested in identifying the parameter regions that lead to the same explanations . since parameters can be identified with linear functionals , it is the case that the set of parameters that lead to the same explanation ( i.e. a vertex @xmath70 ) are those linear functionals that minimize on @xmath70 .",
    "the set of these linear functionals is the _ normal cone of @xmath53 at @xmath70_. the collection of all normal cones at the various vertices @xmath70 forms the _ normal fan _ of the polytope .",
    "putting this together with proposition [ polytopepropagation ] we obtain :    the normal fan of the newton polytope of @xmath50 solves the parametric inference problem for an observation @xmath28 in a graphical model .",

    "an important observation is that our formulation in problem 2 is equivalent to combinatorial `` scoring schemes '' or `` generalized edit distances '' which can be used to assign weights to alignments @xcite .",
    "for example , the simplest scoring scheme consists of two parameters : a mismatch score @xmath186 , and an indel score @xmath187 @xcite .",

    "therefore , for two parameters , our recursive approach to solving the parametric problem yields an @xmath198 algorithm , matching the running time of xparal and the conjecture of waterman , eggert and lander @xcite .        in order to demonstrate the practicality of our approach for higher - dimensional problems , we implemented a four parameter recursive parametric alignment solver .",
    "the more general alignment model includes different transition / transversion parameters ( instead of just one mismatch parameter ) , and separate parameters for opening gaps and extending gaps .",
    "a transition is mutation from one purine ( @xmath32 or @xmath199 ) to another , or from one pyrimidine ( @xmath200 or @xmath201 ) to another , and a transversion is a mutation from a purine to a pyrimidine or vice versa .",

    "unfortunately , these integrals may be difficult to compute .",
    "we propose the following simple monte carlo algorithm for computing a numerical approximation to the integral ( [ bayesian ] ) :    select @xmath210 parameter vectors @xmath211 according to the distribution @xmath206 , where @xmath210 is much larger than the number of vertices of the newton polytope @xmath212 .",

    "the study of newton polytopes can also complement the algebraic geometry approach to model selection proposed in @xcite .",

    "for example , in the case of the hidden markov model with output parameters specialized , the newton polytope of @xmath229 is the polytope associated with a markov chain .",
    "kuo @xcite shows that the size of these polytopes does not depend on the length of the chain .",
    "let @xmath230 be any explanation for @xmath28 in the original model and let @xmath231 be the vertex of the newton polytope of @xmath18 corresponding to that explanation .",
    "we abbreviate @xmath232 and @xmath233 .",
    "the assignment @xmath234 defines a map from the set of explanations of @xmath28 to the support @xmath235 .",
    "the convex hull of the image coincides with the newton polytope of @xmath236 . we define @xmath237 if the specialization is sufficiently generic",
    "then this maximum is attained uniquely , and , for simplicity , we will assume that this is the case .",
    "if a point @xmath238 is not the image of any explanation @xmath230 then we set @xmath239 .",
    "the assignment @xmath240 is a real valued function on the support of our polynomial @xmath241 , and it defines a _ regular polyhedral subdivision _",
    "@xmath242 of the newton polytope @xmath243 .",
    "namely , @xmath244 is the polyhedral complex consisting of all lower faces of the polytope gotten by taking the convex hull of the points @xmath245 in @xmath246 .",
    "see @xcite for details on regular triangulations and regular polyhedral subdivisions .",
    "the explanations for the observation @xmath28 in the specialized model are in bijection with the vertices of the regular polyhedral subdivision @xmath242 of the newton polytope of the specialized polynomial @xmath247 .",
    "the point @xmath245 is a vertex of @xmath244 if and only if the following open polyhedron is non - empty : @xmath248 if @xmath70 is a point in @xmath249 then we set @xmath250 for @xmath251 , and we consider the explanation @xmath230 which attains the minimum in ( [ fromhtoa ] ) . now all parameters have been specialized and @xmath230 is the solution to problem 2 .",
    "this argument is reversible : any explanation for @xmath28 in the specialized model arises from one of the non - empty polyhedra @xmath249 .",
    "we note that the collection of polyhedra @xmath249 defines a polyhedral subdivision of @xmath227 which is geometrically dual to the subdivision @xmath244 of the newton polytope of @xmath241 .    .1 cm    in practical applications of parametric inference , it may be of interest to compute only one normal cone of the newton polytope ( for example the cone containing some fixed parameters ) .",
    "we conclude this section by observing that the polytope propagation algorithm is suitable for this computation as well :    let @xmath70 be a vertex of a @xmath69-dimensional newton polytope of a hidden markov model .",
    "then the normal cone containing @xmath70 can be computed using a polytope propagation algorithm in dimension @xmath252 .",
    "we run the standard polytope propagation algorithm described in section 4 , but at each step we record only the minimizing vertex in the direction of the log parameters , together with its neighboring vertices in the edge graph of the newton polytope .",
    "it follows , by induction , that given this information at the @xmath8th step , we can use it to find the minimizing vertices and related neighbors in the @xmath253st step .",
    "we envision a number of biological applications for the polytope propagation algorithm , including :    * full parametric inference using the normal fan of the newton polytope of an observation when the graphical model under consideration has only few model parameters .",
    "* utilization of the edge graph of the polytope to identify stable parts of alignments and annotations . * construction of the normal cone containing a specific parameter vector when computation of the full newton polytope is infeasible .",
    "* computation of the posterior probability ( in the sense of bayesian statistics ) of an alignment or annotation .",
    "the regions for the relevant integrations are the normal cones of the newton polytope .",
    "as we have seen , the computation of newton polytopes for ( interesting ) graphical models is certainly feasible for a few free parameters , and we expect that further analysis of the computational geometry should yield efficient algorithms in higher dimensions . for example , the key operation , computation of convex hulls of unions of convex polytopes , is likely to be considerably easier than general convex hull computations even in high dimensions .",
    "fukuda , liebling and ltlof @xcite give a polynomial time algorithm for computing extended convex hulls ( convex hulls of unions of convex polytopes ) under the assumption that the polytopes are in general position .",
    "furthermore , it should be possible to optimize the geometric algorithms for specific models of interest , and combinatorial analysis of the newton polytopes arising in graphical models should yield better complexity estimates ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "michael joswig is currently working on a general polytope propagation implementation in polymake @xcite .",
    "in the case where computation of the newton polytope is impractical , it is still possible to identify the cone containing a specific parameter , and this can be used to quantitatively measure the robustness of the inference .",
    "parameters near a boundary are unlikely to lead to biologically meaningful results .",
    "furthermore , the edge graph can be used to identify common regions in the explanations corresponding to adjacent vertices . in the case of alignment",
    ", biologists might see a collection of alignments rather than just one optimal one , with common sub - alignments highlighted .",
    "this is quite different from returning the @xmath254 best alignments , since suboptimal alignments may not be vertices of the newton polytope .",
    "the solution we propose explicitly identifies all suboptimal alignments that can result from similar parameter choices .",
