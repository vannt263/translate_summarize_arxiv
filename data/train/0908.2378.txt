    "recently , within the framework of a coarse - grained nonlinear network model ( nnm ) , we have shown that dbs in proteins feature strongly site - modulated properties  @xcite .",
    "more precisely , we have shown that spatially localized band - edge normal modes ( nm ) can be continued from low energies to db solutions centered at the same sites as the corresponding nms ( the nm sites ) .",
    "note that the latters lie , as a rule , within the stiffest regions of a protein  @xcite .",
    "more generally , however , dbs display a gap in their excitation spectrum . as a consequence , they can `` jump '' to another site as their energy is varied , following spatial selection rules matching the pattern of dbs localized elsewhere  @xcite . as a matter of fact , such jumps realize efficient _ energy transfers_. hereafter , we show that events of this kind , connecting with high yields even widely separated locations , can be triggered by a localized excitation , so long as its energy @xmath4 lies above a given threshold .",

    "is kicked once , the most energetic nonlinear mode obtained is analyzed , and the site the most involved in this mode is recorded . when initial excitations are not imparted along the local stiffest direction , but are oriented at random , energy transfer towards val 177 is less likely ( open diamonds ) . ]    -5 mm",
    "fig .  [ ekept ] summarizes the outcome of one such experiment , where energy is initially either localized in nm ( m ) or in real ( r ) space .",
    "typically , the initial excitation is found to spark the formation of a discrete breather , pinning a variable amount of energy @xmath5 at a specific location . when less than 10 kcal / mole of kinetic energy is injected into the edge nm , nearly all this energy is kept by the db ,",
    "whose overlap with the edge nm is large at low energies .",
    "increasing @xmath4 further , the frequency of the excited mode detaches from the linear band , while the excitation efficiency @xmath6 is eroded .",
    "in fact , as db localization builds up with energy ( see lower left panel ) , the spatial overlap with the edge nm diminishes , thus reducing excitation efficiency  @xcite .",
    "the same db is also excited when the edge nm site is `` kicked '' along an _ appropriate _ direction , namely the maximum stiffness ( ms ) one  @xcite ( see data marked ( r ) in fig .  [ ekept ] ) . in this case",
    ", however , the excitation becomes more efficient as @xmath4 is increased , since the db asymptotically approaches a single - site vibration . for @xmath7 kcal / mole",
    ", the db looses its energy , which flows rapidly into the system .",
    "we find that the maximum strain direction invariably allows for the most efficient excitation of a nonlinear mode at a given site .",
    "[ eangle ] illustrates the efficiency of kicks given along the ms direction , with respect to kicks imparted along random directions .",
    "the correlation with the squared cosine of the angle between the kick and the ms unit vectors indicates that it is the amount of energy injected along the ms vector which is the dominant factor allowing for efficient excitation of a discrete breather .",
    "+ interestingly , kicking away from the ms direction can promote energy transfer to another site .",
    "for instance , while a kick along the ms unit vector at the nm site of the band - edge mode invariably results in a db sitting at the same site , when the direction of the kick is picked at random discrete breathers localized elsewhere are also observed ( see again fig .  [ eangle ] ) . in the following ,",
    "we take advantage of the fact that ms directions can be easily calculated at any site in any structure  @xcite in order to investigate energy transfer in a systematic manner .",
    "energy transfer as a function of distance from excitation site .",
    "the figure illustrates the outcome of an all - site kick experiment in myosin , a large 746 amino - acids enzyme involved in muscle contraction ( pdb code 1vom ) .",
    "the fraction of excitation energy found in the db is plotted versus the distance ( in units of links in the connectivity graph ) between the kicked site and the site where the nonlinear mode self - excites .",
    "the maximum amount of energy found in the db decreases with the number of links separating the feed and the target sites . for instance , when gln 246 is kicked , more than 40% of the energy ends up in a db localized at ala 125 ( the band - edge nm site ) .",
    "this amounts to four links , corresponding to a span of about 25   in real space . otherwise , when a kick is given to ile 351 , gln 246 or tyr 34 , 25 - 65% of the excitation energy flows either to ala 125 or leu 296 , the nm site of the third edge normal mode . in cases where more than 30% of the kick energy",
    "is transferred away , three sites turn out to be targeted half of the times , namely ala 125 ( 27% ) , leu 296 ( 13% ) and gly 451 ( 7% ) . when only long - range energy transfers are considered ( covering three or more links ) , the shares raise to 71 % and 18 % for ala 125 and leu 296 , respectively . in the remaining cases ,",
    "the db is found either at leu 516 ( 7% , 14@xmath8 mode ) or at arg 80 ( 4% , 10@xmath8 mode ) . ]",
    "-5 mm      when a given residue is kicked along the ms direction , a transfer event can occur when @xmath9 kcal / mol ( see an example in fig .  [ etrans ] ) . at peak transfer ,",
    "more than 75  % of such kicks excite a db localized at the band - edge nm site , while otherwise energy flows towards the nm site of another edge mode .",
    "conversely , when the kick is imparted along a random direction , energy transfer is found to be less efficient . + quite generally , a transfer event can be observed when almost any site is kicked , and in the majority of cases only a handful of well - defined sites are targeted .",
    "this means that energy transfer can occur between widely separated locations . indeed , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ elost ] for myosin , only about 5 % of 55 kcal / mole kicks result in a db localized at the same location . for all other kicked sites",
    ", a transfer occurs to a db pinning a decreasing fraction of the excitation energy , one to eleven links away .",
    "note that all high - yield and long - range energy transfers aim at the nm sites of one of the edge nms , the nm site of the bande - edge mode being the most likely target .",
    "thus , energy systematically flows toward the stiffest regions of the structure .",
    "interestingly , this is where functionally relevant residues tend to be located  @xcite . + in one occurrence ,",
    "more than 20% of the kick energy ends up in a nonlinear mode localized more than five links away : following a kick at tyr 34 a remarkable nine - link stretch is covered up to leu 296 , making a jump of more than 60  .",
    "however , cases of ultra long - range energy transfer like this are more rare and , at the same time , less efficient .",
    "in fact , as a consequence of the rather small amount of energy transferred ( nearly 14 kcal / mole ) , the db that self - excites at the target site is poorly localized ( like in fig .",
    "[ ekept ] ) .     site to site energy transfer in myosin .",
    "the local energies at sites ile 351 ( dotted line ) and leu 296 ( solid line ) are plotted as functions of time , after a 55 kcal / mole kick at ile 351 .",
    "the fluctuations occurring well before and after the transfer reflect the fact that the corresponding nonlinear modes are not perfectly localized on both sites . as a consequence ,",
    "they exchange significant amounts of energy with their _ environs_. ]    -5 mm    a more efficient transfer event , covering two links ( about 11  ) , is analyzed in fig .",
    "[ edet ] . at first",
    ", a db is excited at the kicked site . however , due to interactions with the background , its energy slowly but steadily flows into the system . after approximately 1 ns , about 65 % of the excitation energy is still there . at @xmath10",
    "ns , this amount of energy is rapidly and almost entirely transferred to leu 296 , marking the self - localization of another db .",
    "although the transfer itself is a quite complex process , involving several intermediate sites , it may well prove to be an example of _ targeted energy transfer _",
    "@xcite . indeed , as the energy of the db at the the initial site drops , its frequency diminishes as well .",
    "this may allow for a transfer to occur if a resonance condition with the frequency of another db is met .",
    "the transmission should be irreversible , as a consequence of both dbs frequency drifts during energy exchange  @xcite .",
    "note that , as the energy of the first db is eroded , the mode becomes also less and less localized  @xcite .",
    "this , in turn , is likely to increase the overlap between the two db displacement patterns , thus allowing for more efficient energy channelling  @xcite .    to gain further understanding on the transfer mechanism , we investigated energy circulation in a dimeric form of rhodopsin .",
    "very few high - yield and long - range energy transfers were recorded between sites belonging to different monomers , the vast majority of transfer events being confined within the same domain .",
    "indeed , in less than 1% of the instances more than 30% of the kick energy ( 55 kcal / mole ) injected at one monomer is transmitted to the other . here , at variance with most protein dimers ,",
    "the stiffest regions are located in monomer bulks , so that the edge nms are localized far away from the interface .",
    "this strongly suggests that energy transfers not only target stiff regions , but can couple any two sites efficiently only through rather stiff channeling pathways . on the other hand , when kicking one of the two ( almost ) equivalent sites of rhodopsin that are covalently linked to the retinal chromophore , up to about 50 % of the excitation energy ends up in a db localized at one of three specific sites , the targeted location depending upon where ( which monomer ) the kick is imparted and on the magnitude of the latter .",
    "interestingly , fig .",
    "[ k296 ] reveals that transfer efficiency is optimum in the narrow range 50 - 55 kcal / mole , _",
    "i.e. _ exactly the energy of photons that can be absorbed by the retinal chromophore when it is embedded within rhodopsin ( @xmath11 nm ) .",
    "interestingly , the preferentially targeted residue in this energy range ( glu 113 ) is known to be involved in the early stages of the signaling cascade following rhodopsin activation  @xcite .",

    "the fraction of energy @xmath6 found in the discrete breather when kicking the site attached to the retinal chromophore ( lys 296 ) of monomer b is plotted versus the excitation energy .",
    "symbols indicate at which site the db self - localizes : glu 113 ( black diamonds ) , cys 185 ( open diamonds ) , met 86 ( open circle ) or another one ( stars ) . ]    -5 mm",
    "in summary , despite its coarse - grained nature , the nnm framework is able to provide biologically sensible clues about energy circulation in proteins .",
    "high - yield and long - range energy transfers systematically pin energy at the sites the most involved in a small subset of band - edge linear modes , that is , within the stiffest parts of protein structures",
    ". these , in turn , are the regions preferentially hosting residues involved in catalytic mechanisms  @xcite .",
    "thus , what our study suggests is that protein structures may have been designed , during the course of evolution , so as to allow energy to flow where it is needed , _",
    "e.g. _ to , or close to catalytic sites , with the aim of lowering the energy barriers that have to be overcome during catalytic processes .",
    "interestingly , in view of the coarse - grained nature of the nnm scheme , the same site - specific , high - yield and long - range energy transfers observed in proteins are also likely to occur in other physical systems , possibly simpler to engineer and to handle , so long as they share with proteins both spatial and stiffness heterogeneity .",
    "proteins are modelled as networks of nodes of mass @xmath12 ( the @xmath13-carbons of their amino - acid residues ) linked by springs .",
    "specifically , in the nonlinear network model ( nnm )  @xcite , the potential energy of a protein , @xmath14 , has the following form : @xmath15   \\notag\\ ] ] where @xmath16 is the distance between particles @xmath17 and @xmath18 , @xmath19 their distance in the equilibrium structure ( as _ e.g. _ solved through x - ray crystallography ) and @xmath20 is a distance cutoff that specifies which pairs of nodes are interacting .",
    "note that @xmath21 corresponds to the widely used elastic network model ( enm )  @xcite , which has proven useful for quantitatively describing amino - acid fluctuations at room temperature  @xcite , as well as for predicting and characterizing large - amplitude functional motions of proteins  @xcite , in agreement with all - atom models  @xcite , paving the way for numerous applications in structural biology  @xcite , such as fitting atomic structures into low - resolution electron density maps  @xcite , or providing templates for molecular replacement techniques  @xcite .",
    "as in previous nnm studies  @xcite , we take @xmath2210  , @xmath23 kcal / mol / @xmath24 and fix @xmath25 so that the low - frequency part of the linear spectrum matches actual protein frequencies , as calculated using realistic force fields  @xcite . when @xmath26 a.m.u .",
