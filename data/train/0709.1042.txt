    "the achievement of bose  einstein condensation in trapped atomic gases at ultra - low temperatures has stimulated intense experimental and theoretical activity in modern physics , as seen by the award of the nobel prize in physics in 2001 @xcite .",
    "einstein condensate ( bec ) , a state of matter predicted by einstein in 1925 , is created by the condensation of a macroscopically large number of bosons into one of the eigenstates of the single - particle density matrix below the bose ",
    "einstein transition temperature .",
    "a remarkable consequence of the condensation is an extension of microscopic quantum phenomena into the macroscopic scale .",
    "this is an essential origin of superfluidity and superconductivity , in which macroscopically extended phase coherence allows a dissipationless current to flow .",
    "superfluidity is closely related to the existence of quantized vortices . for weakly interacting becs the superfluid velocity *",
    "v * is given by the gradient of the phase @xmath0 of a `` condensate wave function '' @xmath1 with the planck constant @xmath2 and particle mass @xmath3 .",
    "since the wave function remains single - valued , the change in the phase around a closed contour must be an integer multiple of @xmath4 .",
    "thus , the circulation @xmath5 around a closed contour is given by @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) , which shows that circulation of a vortex is  quantized \" in units of @xmath8 .",
    "realization of weakly - interacting atomic - gas becs has provided an ideal testing ground to study the physics of quantized vortices ; up to now , several experimental groups have reported many interesting results .",
    "this experimental work has been followed by considerable theoretical activity , leading to proposals and new problems to be tackled .",
    "( for a review of the early research stages of quantized vortices , see @xcite . )",
    "in this article , we review the physics of quantized vortices in atomic - gas becs , especially focusing on the progress of the experimental research .",
    "we restrict ourselves to arguments on _ trapped _ condensates with inhomogeneous density profiles .",
    "the aim of this review is to stimulate further developments of this field . by reflecting on the history of the current research and on unresolved problems ,",
    "we hope to encourage researchers in low temperature physics to investigate quantized vortices in this system .",
    "while quantized vortices have been extensively studied in the field of superfluid helium @xcite , there has been a resurgence of interest in vortices in atomic becs because of the following reasons .",
    "first , the diluteness of a gas yields a relatively large healing length that characterizes the vortex core size , thus enabling the visualization of vortex cores by imaging techniques characteristic of this system ( see sec.[imagingtech ] ) .",
    "because of this observational capability , the ability to manipulate a condensate wave function , and the tunability of the rotation over a wide range , these systems provide a unique approach to studying quantized vortices and their dynamics .",
    "second , the finite size effect due to the trapping potential causes novel properties of vortices .",
    "finally , multicomponent becs provide new possibilities for studying unconventional vortex states that have been studied in other fields of physics , such as superfluid @xmath9he , anisotropic superconductors , and theories in high - energy physics and cosmology @xcite .",
    "since this is the first time that the topic of atomic becs has appeared in the progress of low temperature physics , we start with a basic introduction to ultra - cold atomic systems , including how a condensate is formed and how they are manipulated . although it is desirable to refer to the experimental and theoretical studies of such systems in detail , we will only mention the basic ideas necessary to understand some important issues in experiment and theory because of space restrictions .",
    "these issues are described in sec .",
    "[ basic ] .",
    "more detailed accounts can be found in the comprehensive text books by pethick and smith @xcite , pitaevskii and s. stringari @xcite , and in the review paper by leggett @xcite . in sec .",
    "[ vortexbasic ] , we review the basic theory and experiments on quantized vortices in atomic becs , addressing how vortices are created in this system and how they are detected .",
    "we also show the intrinsic mechanism of vortex nuclation and lattice formation in a trapped bec .",
    "there are two interesting regimes classified by the rotation rate of the system : one at a slow rotation rate close to a critical rotation frequency where there is a single vortex , and another at high rotation rates for which a lattice of a large number of vortices is formed .",
    "the details of these two regimes are discussed in sec .",

    "further interesting topics that can not be explained sufficiently in this review and remaining future problems are presented in sec .",

    "we devote sec .",
    "[ conclusions ] to conclusions and outlook .",
    "while progress toward the achievement of bose  einstein condensation in a dilute atomic gas had proceeded for the past few decades , researchers succeeded in creating a condensate in 1995 @xcite .",
    "this realization brought great sensation in modern physics and opened a new research field combining condensed matter physics and atomic , molecular , optical ( amo ) physics . here , we briefly summarize the basic introduction about a system of ultra - cold atomic - gas becs , giving background information for understanding the experiments and theories of quantized vortices in the following sections .",
    "a typical system considered here is a collection of neutral atoms with particle number @xmath10 to @xmath11 , trapped by a potential created by a magnetic field or an optical laser field .",
    "the density of the atomic gas is of the order of @xmath12 @xmath13 , which is lower than that of air on the earth ( @xmath14 @xmath13 ) .",
    "the transition temperature to bose - einstein condensation can be estimated from a dimensional analysis of the relevant physical quantities ( @xmath3 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 ) as @xmath17 , which is in a range from @xmath18 nk to a few @xmath19k . at such low temperatures ,",
    "the gas phase can not be a stable thermodynamic state and could in principle collapse to the solid phase .",
    "however , this relaxation is dominated by a three - body recombination process , which is a rare event for dilute and cold gases ; the lifetime of the sample is thus long enough ( of the order of a few seconds to a few minutes ) to carry out experiments .    in typical experiments ,",
    "there are several steps toward the condensation of atoms .",
    "the first is laser cooling , achieved with three pairs of counter - propagating laser beams along three orthogonal axes .",
    "subsequently , the precooled gas is confined in a trapping potential , described typically by a harmonic potential . in this stage ,",
    "the temperature is of order 100 @xmath19k , with 10@xmath20 atoms . in the case of a trap created by a magnetic field ,",
    "the atoms are trapped by the zeeman interaction of the electron spin with an inhomogeneous magnetic field .",
    "thus , atoms with electron spins parallel to the magnetic field are attracted to the minimum of the magnetic field ( weak - field seeking state ) , while ones with electron spin antiparallel are repelled ( strong - field seeking state ) .",
    "laser cooling alone can not produce sufficiently high densities and low temperatures for condensation . the second step , evaporative cooling ( a process in some sense similar to blowing on coffee to cool it ) , allows the removal of more energetic atoms , thus further cooling the cloud .",
    "the evaporation is effected by applying a radio - frequency magnetic field which flips the electron spin of the most energetic atoms . at the end of the process , the final temperature is about 100 nk and about 10@xmath21 - 10@xmath22 atoms remain .",
    "experimentally , the atomic - gas systems are attractive , since they can be manipulated by the use of lasers and magnetic fields .",
    "the cold gas is confined in a trap without microscopic roughness , as it is an extremely clean system .",
    "in addition , interactions between atoms may be affected either by using different atomic species or by changing the strength of an applied magnetic or electric field for species that exhibit feshbach resonance .",
    "a further advantage is that , because of low density , the microscopic length scales are so large that the structure of the condensate wave function may be investigated by optical methods . finally , the mean collision time @xmath23 sec between atoms ( @xmath24 is the cross section and @xmath25 the speed of atom ) is comparable to the characteristic time of the collective mode , which prohibits a local equilibrium of the system .",
    "thus , this system is ideal for studying nonequilibrium relaxation dynamics .",
    "the characteristics of becs are mainly determined by atom  atom interactions , which depend crucially on the species of the condensed atoms .",
    "most bec experiments have been performed using alkali atoms because their ground state electronic structure is simple ; all electrons except one occupy closed shells and the remaining electron is in an @xmath26 orbital in a higher shell .",
    "this structure is well suited to laser - based manipulation because its optical transitions can be excited by available lasers and the internal energy - level structure is favorable for cooling to very low temperatures . since the first observation of bec in atomic gases",
    ", becs have been formed from nine different elements , including the alkali atoms @xmath27rb @xcite , @xmath28na @xcite , @xmath22li @xcite , h @xcite , @xmath29rb @xcite , @xmath30k @xcite , @xmath31cs @xcite , and @xmath32k @xcite , and the non - alkali atoms metastable he @xcite , @xmath33yb @xcite , and @xmath34cr @xcite . @xmath27rb and",
    "@xmath28na atoms are stable and have long lifetimes against inelastic collisional decay and are thus popular atomic species for bec experiments .",
    "once a bec has been created in a harmonic trap , it is probed for its properties .",
    "this can be achieved either _ in situ _ ,",
    "i.e. , with the condensate inside the trap , or using a time - of - flight ( tof ) technique . although _ in situ",
    "_ diagnostics , such as nondestructive phase - contrast imaging @xcite , are valuable tools for some applications , the tof technique is more often used in vortex experiments .",
    "the tof technique involves switching off the trapping field ( magnetic or optical ) at time @xmath35 and taking an image of the bec a few ( typically 5 to 25 ) milliseconds later . switching off the trap allows the sample to expand before applying the laser beam probe , because the probe is difficult to apply at high densities .",
    "images of the sample are most often taken by absorption , i.e. , shining a resonant laser beam into the atomic cloud and using a ccd camera to observe the shadow cast by the absorption of photons , from which can be determined the integrated atomic density .",
    "this method is inherently destructive since real absorption processes are involved by spontaneous radiation and the accompanying heating .",
    "\\(i ) _ laser created potential _    atoms in a laser field experience a force , due mainly to the interaction of the laser field with the electric dipole moment induced in the atoms .",
    "the force on atoms in a laser field is used in a variety of ways in bec experiments .",
    "the character of the force is determined by the detuning given by @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the laser frequency and @xmath38 ( @xmath39 ) the ground ( excited ) state energy of an atom .",
    "the force also depends on the laser - beam intensity @xmath40 , given by @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the dielectric constant , @xmath43 the speed of light , @xmath44 an appropriately defined dipole matrix element for the transition in question , and @xmath45 with the lifetime of the excited state @xmath46 . in the limit @xmath47 ,",
    "the change in energy of the atom in the laser field is @xmath48 .",
    "a region of high laser intensity thus provides an attractive potential for @xmath49 ( `` red detuning '' ) and a repulsive potential for @xmath50 ( `` blue detuning '' ) .",
    "a red - detuned potential has been used as an optical trap for atoms .",
    "a blue - detuned potential creates a potential barrier that separates a condensate and an impurity ( obstacle ) potential .",
    "the interference pattern created by counter - propagating laser beams yields a periodic potential for atoms , called an optical lattice .",
    "+ ( ii ) _ hyperfine state _",
    "atomic becs can have internal degrees of freedom , attributed to the hyperfine spin of atoms .",
    "a hyperfine - zeeman sublevel of an atom with total electronic angular momentum @xmath51 and nuclear spin @xmath52 may be labeled by the projection @xmath53 of total atomic spin @xmath54 on the axis of the field @xmath55 and by the value of total @xmath56 , which can take a value from @xmath57 to @xmath58 .",
    "this is because the hyperfine coupling , which is proportional to @xmath59 , is much larger than the typical temperature of an ultra - cold atomic system .",
    "the hyperfine state is denoted by @xmath60 with @xmath61 .",
    "the simultaneous trapping of atoms with different hyperfine sublevels makes it possible to create multicomponent ( often called `` spinor '' ) becs with internal degrees of freedom @xcite , characterized by multiple order parameters @xcite .",
    "an external field can couple the internal sublevels of the atom and cause coherent transition of the population .",
    "this coherent transition can be used to control the spatial variation of the condensate wave functions , resulting in an `` imprinting '' of a phase pattern onto the condensate . in most schemes , the spatial configuration of the field ,",
    "the intensity and detuning of the laser fields , and the phase relationship between the different fields need to be carefully controlled to create the right phase pattern , that takes full advantage of the complex internal dynamics .",
    "+ ( iii ) _ feshbach resonance _",
    "a salient feature of cold atom systems is that field - induced feshbach resonance can tune the scattering length between atoms @xcite , which determines the atom  atom interaction .",
    "a feshbach resonance occurs when a quasi - bound molecular state in a closed channel has energy equal to that of two colliding atoms in an open channel .",
    "such resonances can greatly effect elastic and inelastic collisions such as dipolar relaxation and three - body recombination .",
    "scattering near the resonance can be quantified by perturbation theory . to first order in the coupling between open and closed channels ,",
    "the scattering is unaltered , because there are no continuum states in the closed channels .",
    "however , two particles in an open channel can scatter to an intermediate state in a closed channel , which subsequently decays to give two particles in an open channel . considering such second - order processes ,",
    "we can obtain the contribution to the scattering length as @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is the energy of the particles in the open channel and @xmath64 is the energy of a state in the closed channels .",
    "consequently , there are large effects if the energy @xmath63 of the two particles in the entrance channel is close to the energy @xmath64 of a bound state in the closed channels .",
    "therefore , coupling between the channels yields a repulsive interaction if the energy of the scattering particles is greater than that of the bound state , and an attractive interaction if it is less .",
    "since the energies of the states depend on external parameters such as the magnetic field , the resonances can be used to control the interaction between atoms .        from a theoretical point of view ,",
    "a major advantage of weakly - interacting atomic - gas becs is that almost all the atoms in the system occupy the same quantum state and the condensate may be described very well in terms of mean - field theory .",
    "this is in contrast to liquid @xmath21he , for which a mean - field approach is inapplicable due to the strong correlations induced by the interactions between the atoms .",
    "bogoliubov s treatment of a uniform bose gas at zero temperature provides a useful mean - field description of a condensate .",
    "subsequently , gross and pitaevskii independently considered an inhomogeneous dilute bose gas , generalizing bogoliubov s approach to include nonuniform states , which includes quantized vortices .",
    "such nonuniform states of a dilute bose gas can be understood by considering the second - quantized many - body hamiltonian @xmath65 \\hat{\\psi}({\\bf r } ) , \\label{secondhamiltonian}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] expressed in terms of boson field operators @xmath66 and @xmath67 that obey bose ",

    "the interparticle potential @xmath71 is approximated by a short - range interaction @xmath72 , where @xmath73 is a coupling constant , characterized by the s - wave scattering length @xmath74 , because only binary collisions at low energy are relevant in a dilute cold gas and these collisions are independent of the details of the two - body potential .    in three dimentions ,",
    "a remarkable feature of a dilute bose gas at zero temperature is the existence of a macroscopic wave function @xmath75 ( an `` order parameter '' ) .",
    "the macroscopic occupation of condensed particles makes it natural to write the field operator as a sum @xmath76 of a classical field @xmath77 that characterizes the condensate and a quantum field @xmath78 representing the remaining noncondensed particles . in order to derive the equation of motion for the order parameter",

    "pitaevskii ( gp ) equation @xmath81 \\psi({\\bf r},t ) \\label{gpeq}\\ ] ] for the condensate wave function @xmath77 .",
    "the gp equation ( [ gpeq ] ) can be used to explore the dynamic behavior of the system , characterized by variations of the order parameter over distances larger than the mean distance between atoms .",
    "this equation is valid when the s - wave scattering length is much smaller than the average distance between atoms , and the number of atoms in the condensate is much larger than unity .",
    "the ground state of a trapped bec can be expressed within the formalism of the gp theory .",
    "we can write the condensate wave function as @xmath82 , where @xmath83 obeys the time - independent gp equation @xmath84 \\phi({\\bf r } ) = \\mu \\phi({\\bf r } ) ;   \\label{stagpeq}\\ ] ] @xmath85 is normalized to the number of condensed particles @xmath86 , which determines the chemical potenteial @xmath19 .",
    "typically , studies of trapped atomic gases involve the dilute limit ( the gas parameter @xmath87 is typically less than 10@xmath88 , where @xmath89 is the average density of the gas ) , so that depletion of the condensate is small with @xmath90 .",
    "hence , most of the particles remain in the condensate such that @xmath91 .",
    "the time - independent gp equation ( [ stagpeq ] ) is also derived by minimizing the gp energy functional @xmath92 = \\int d { \\bf r } \\psi^{\\ast } \\left ( -\\frac{\\hbar^{2 } \\nabla^{2}}{2 m }   + v_{\\rm ex } + \\frac{g}{2 } |\\psi|^{2 } \\right ) \\psi \\equiv e_{\\rm kin } + e_{\\rm tr } + e_{\\rm int } , \\label{hamilfunctional}\\ ] ] subject to the constraint of a fixed particle number @xmath93 .",

    "such systems offer an ideal testing ground for the study of unconventional topological defects ; similar structures appear in other condensed matter systems such as superfluid @xmath9he and unconventional superconductors , and theories in high - energy physics and cosmology .",
