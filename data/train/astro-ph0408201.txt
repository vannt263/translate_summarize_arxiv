    "the wide range of topics covered in this volume  _ from planets to cosmology _  bear testimony to the fact that the capabilities offered by hubble remain unique for many purposes , in spite of much recent progress in competing technologies such as ground - based adaptive optics . for studies of extragalactic stellar populations , the combination of relatively wide - field imaging at diffraction limited resolution even in the optical and near - uv offered by hst is invaluable , and will remain unsurpassed for the foreseeable future .",
    "hst has contributed much to our understanding of star formation in clusters , both in a galactic and extragalactic context . rather than attempting to cover everything",
    ", i will concentrate mainly on star clusters beyond the local group , partly because that is what i am most familiar with , and partly because local group galaxies are covered elsewhere in this volume ( grebel ) .",
    "much of the work on young clusters done in the first decade of hst s lifetime has been reviewed by @xcite , and although some overlap is unavoidable the main aim of this review is to discuss more recent results and try to look ahead .    hst has had a tremendous impact on the field of extragalactic star clusters almost since the day it was launched .",
    "some major ground - breaking discoveries were , in fact , made even prior to the 1993 repair mission .",
    "young star clusters had been identified in a few galaxies other than the milky way prior to hst , including most local group members and a few galaxies slightly beyond the local group . but with hst it became possible to undertake systematic surveys in larger samples of galaxies and better characterize the properties of young clusters in different environments .",
    "ground - based capabilities have also evolved during the lifetime of hst , of course .",
    "larger - format ccd detectors with excellent blue and uv quantum efficiency have become available , a better understanding of `` dome '' seeing has led to improved image quality , and 810 m ground - based telescopes have made it possible to obtain high - quality spectra of faint objects detected in hst images .",
    "while star clusters have been the subject of substantial interest for many years , it may be worth recalling some of the main motivations for studying them .",
    "first , there are a number of problems which make clusters interesting in their own right .",
    "these involve both their formation , subsequent dynamical evolution and ultimate fate . at first glance , clusters appear deceptively simple : they are aggregations of a few hundred to about a million individual stars , generally constituting a gravitationally bound system ( although the latter may not be true for some of the youngest systems ) . yet , constructing realistic models of their structure and dynamical evolution has proven to be a major challenge , and it is only now becoming possible to carry out reasonably realistic n - body simulations including the effects of stellar evolution , external gravitational fields , and the rapidly varying gravitational potential in the early phases of cluster evolution during which gas is expelled from the system ( ( * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* joshi et al .  2000 ; giersz 2001 ; kroupa & boily 2002 ) ) .",
    "the models must be tested observationally , and hst data currently represent the only way to reliably measure structural parameters for extragalactic star clusters .",
    "second , there is growing evidence that a significant fraction of all stars form within clusters , although only a small fraction of these stars eventually end up in _ bound",
    "_ clusters ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lada & lada 2003 ) ; ( * ? ? ?",
    "* fall 2004 ) ) .",
    "therefore , the problem of understanding _ star _",
    "formation is intimately linked to that of understanding _ cluster _ formation , and a theory of one can not be complete without the other .",
    "it is of interest to investigate how the properties of star clusters might depend on environment , as this might provide important clues to any differences in the star formation process itself . in particular , hst has made important contributions towards establishing the presence of `` young massive clusters '' ( ymcs ) in a variety of environments , which appear very similar to young versions of the old _ globular _ clusters which are ubiquitous around all major galaxies .",
    "globular cluster formation was once thought to be uniquely related to the physics of the early universe ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* e.g.  peebles & dicke 1968 ; fall & rees 1985 ) ) but it now seems to be an ongoing process which can be observed even at the present epoch .",
    "third , star clusters are potentially very useful as tracers of the stellar populations in their host galaxies .",
    "clusters can be identified and studied at much greater distances than individual stars . in most cases , they are composed of stars which , to a very good approximation , formed at the same time and have the same metallicity .",
    "this is in contrast to the integrated light from the galaxies , which may originate from an unknown mix of stellar populations with different ages and metallicities . although the effects of stellar evolution alone cause a cluster to fade by 5 - 6 magnitudes ( in @xmath2-band ) over 10 gyrs ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* bruzual & charlot 2003 ) ) , it is in principle possible to detect clusters which have formed during the entire lifetime of galaxies , out to distances of several mpc . in particular , _",
    "globular clusters _ have been used extensively in attempts to constrain the star formation histories of early - type galaxies .",
    "hst is almost ideally tailored for studies of extragalactic star clusters .",
    "three main reasons for this are :    * angular resolution : clusters typically have half - light radii of 24 pc ( see section  [ sec : env ] ) , and can thus be recognized as extended objects out to distances of 1020 mpc with the @xmath3 resolution offered by wfpc2 or acs . with careful modeling of the point spread function ( psf )",
    "this limit may be pushed even further . *",
    "field size : at 10 mpc , the acs @xmath4 field - of - view corresponds to about 10 kpc @xmath5 10 kpc , making it possible to cover a significant fraction of a typical galaxy in a single pointing . *",
    "spectral range : for studies of young stellar populations , optical and near - uv spectral coverage is essential , as discussed below .",
    "there is currently no alternative to hst on the horizon which offers a similar combination of capabilities .",
    "the _ james webb space telescope _ ( jwst ) , while offering vastly improved efficiency in the ir , will offer no significant gain in resolution over hst , and will be limited to longer wavelengths .",
    "ground - based adaptive optics ( ao ) can provide similar , or even better resolution than hst , but only within a small ( @xmath6 ) isoplanatic field of view .",
    "furthermore , ao lacks the stable psf of hst which is critical for many purposes ( e.g.  when measuring structural parameters for star clusters at the limit of the resolution ) , and is in any case limited to the ir ( at least for now ) .",
    "the galex mission offers wide - field uv imaging , but with a spatial resolution that is inferior by far to that of hst ( about 5@xmath7 ) .",
    "the need for optical and near - uv imaging in particular deserves some additional comments .",
    "figure  [ fig : col_age ] shows simple stellar population ( ssp ) model calculations ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* bruzual & charlot 2003 ) ) for the evolution of the ,  and  broad - band colors of a single - burst stellar population .",
    "the models are shown for metallicities @xmath8 ( solar ) and @xmath9 between ages of @xmath10 years and @xmath11 years .",
    "as seen from the figure , the  color is an excellent age indicator in the range from @xmath12 to a few times @xmath13 years , increasing by more than 0.5 mag and with little metallicity dependence over this age range .",
    "the  color , in contrast , remains nearly constant over the same age range , and offers little leverage for age determinations .",
    "in practice , there are complicating problems such as dust extinction , which in general will make it difficult to obtain accurate age estimates from a single color . using a combination of two colors , such as  and , will make it possible to constrain both age and reddening , while at the same time being relatively insensitive to metallicity effects .",
    "the relation between age and location of a cluster in the ( , ) two - color plane has been calibrated with clusters in the large magellanic cloud through the so - called ` s'-sequence ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* elson & fall 1985 ) ; ( * ? ? ?",
    "* girardi et al . 1995 ) ) . for ages younger than about @xmath12 years",
    ", line emission becomes important ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* anders & fritze - v .",
    "alvensleben 2003 ) ) , while the age - metallicity degeneracy ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* worthey 1994 ) ) becomes a difficulty at older ages .",
    "a more recent discussion of photometric age indicators , with emphasis on the importance of blue and uv data , is in @xcite .",
    "use of e.g.  the  color can help put further constraints on the metallicity and may also help constrain the ages of stellar populations in the range @xmath14 myr to @xmath15 myr ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* maraston et al .  2002 ) ) , although the models are more uncertain and depend strongly on the stellar evolutionary tracks used in the construction of the ssp models ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* girardi 2000 ) ) .",
    "high - resolution , wide - field imaging in the blue and/or @xmath16 will be especially important for attempts to constrain not only the luminosity function , but also the mass function of clusters . for a long time , wfpc2 was the `` workhorse '' on hst , and it remains the only wide - field imager on board hst with @xmath17-band imaging capability . however , the sensitivity of wfpc2 in the @xmath17-band is rather low and the detectors are steadily degrading .",
    "the _ wide field camera 3 _ , with its panchromatic coverage , would be an ideally suited instrument for such studies .",
    "even within the local group , it has long been known that the traditional distinction between open and globular clusters that can be applied fairly easily in the milky way breaks down in some other galaxies .",
    "the classical example is the `` blue globular '' clusters in the large magellanic cloud , which are not easily classified as either open or globular clusters .",
    "the most massive of these objects have masses up to @xmath18 ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* elson & fall 1985 ; fischer et al .",

    "similar clusters have been found in m33 ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* christian & schommer 1982,1988 ) ) .    a good indication of the status of research in extragalactic young star clusters shortly prior to hst is provided by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* kennicutt & chu ( 1988 ; hereafter kc88 ) ) .",
    "these authors compiled observations of what they refer to as `` young populous clusters '' ( pcs ) in 14 galaxies for which data was available at that time .",
    "half of the galaxies studied by kc88 were local group members ( milky way , lmc , smc , m33 , m31 , ngc  6822 and ic  1613 ) .",
    "as noted by kc88 , a severe difficulty in comparing observations of pcs in different galaxies , made by different authors , is the widely variable completeness of the surveys , and the different definitions of such clusters . kc88",
    "adopted a ( somewhat arbitrary ) definition of a young pc as an object with an estimated mass @xmath19 and a color @xmath20 .",
    "they noted a conspicuous deficiency of populous clusters in the milky way and m31 , the two only large sb / sbc - type spirals in the sample , and suggested that this might be linked to the deficiency of giant hii regions in the same two galaxies . by comparing the relative numbers of pcs and giant hii regions in their sample of galaxies , kc88 concluded that pcs may indeed form inside such regions , but not all giant hii regions produce bound clusters .",
    "this is very much in line with recent indications that only a small fraction of star clusters of _ any _ mass remain bound ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* fall 2004 ) ) .",
    "the galaxies which did contain pcs were all late - type , though not _ all _ late - type galaxies were found to contain pcs .",
    "a significant exception is the local group dwarf irregular ic  1613 , which contains few if any star clusters at all ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* van den bergh 1979 ; hodge 1980 ) ) in spite of some on - going star formation",
    ". the near - absence of star clusters in ic  1613 may be as important a clue to the nature of the cluster formation process as the abundant cluster systems in starbursts and merger galaxies ( section [ sec : env ] ) .    to a large extent ,",
    "research in old globular clusters ( gcs ) remained detached from that of ymcs until fairly recently .",
    "it was well - known that early - type galaxies typically have many more gcs per unit host galaxy luminosity ( ( * ? ? ? *",
    "harris & van den bergh 1981 ) ) than spirals and irregulars , a fact that was recognized as a problem for the idea that early - type galaxies form by mergers of gas - rich spirals ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* van den bergh 1982 ) ) .",
    "@xcite proposed that this problem might be solved if new gcs form _ during _ the merger .",
    "this idea was further explored by @xcite , who predicted that the resulting merger product should contain two distinct gc populations : one metal - poor population inherited from the progenitor galaxies , and a new metal - rich population formed in the merger . the two gc populations should be identifiable in the color distributions of the resulting gc systems .",
    "two highly influential discoveries soon followed : bimodal color distributions were discovered in several gc systems around early - type galaxies ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* zepf & ashman 1993 ; secker et al .  1995 ;",
    "whitmore et al .",
    "1995 ) ) , and highly luminous , compact young star clusters were found in ongoing or recent mergers like the antennae and ngc  7252 ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* whitmore et al .  1993 ; whitmore & schweizer 1995 ) ) .",
    "in retrospect , it had already been known for a long time that even the metallicity distribution of the milky way gc system is strongly bimodal ( ( * ? ? ? * zinn 1985 ) ) .",
    "the mean metallicities of the two modes in the milky way are in fact quite similar to those seen in early - type galaxies .",
    "the milky way is unlikely to be the result of a major merger , and there are also other indications that not all properties of gc systems in early - type galaxies can be explained by a naive application of the merger model .",
    "alternative scenarios have later been put forward to explain the presence of multiple gc populations ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* e.g.  forbes et al .",
    "1997 ; ct et al .",
    "1998 ) ) , but it is beyond the scope of this paper to discuss any of these in detail .",
    "comprehensive discussions can be found e.g.  in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the discovery of young globular cluster - like objects in ongoing mergers was a tantalizing hint that it might be possible to study the process of globular cluster formation close - up at the present epoch , and not just from the fossil record .",
    "tables  [ tab : nmsb][tab : sp ] are an attempt to collect a reasonably complete list of galaxies where ymcs have been identified ( until  @xmath21may 2004 ) , along with some pertinent references . for each galaxy ,",
    "the main facilities used for the observations are listed , although in many cases it is impossible to give a comprehensive listing .",
    "standard abbreviations ( acs , foc , ghrs , stis , nicmos , wfpc , wfpc2 ) are used for hst instruments .",

    "the level of detail provided in different studies varies enormously  in some cases , identifications of ymcs are only a byproduct of more general investigations of galaxy properties ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* e.g.  meurer et al .  1995 ;",
    "scoville et al .",
    "2000 ) ) while other studies are dedicated analyses of cluster systems in individual galaxies .",
    "galaxies marked with an asterisk ( @xmath22 ) are used later ( section  [ sec : size_sample ] ) when discussing luminosity functions . in the following",
    "i briefly discuss a few illustrative cases from each table and then move on to discuss more general properties of young cluster systems .",
    ".observations of young star clusters in starburst galaxies . [ cols= \" < , < , < \" , ]     most of the ymcs discussed in the preceding sections are located in environments that are peculiar in some way , or at least different from what we see in the solar neighborhood .",
    "thus , it is tempting to speculate that the absence of ymcs in the milky way indicates that their formation somehow requires special conditions",
    ". there is , however , increasing evidence that ymcs can form even in the disks of spiral galaxies .",
    "table  [ tab : sp ] lists a number of nearby spirals in which ymcs have been identified .",
    "a few ( e.g.  m51 ) are clearly involved in interactions , but none of them are disturbed to a degree where they are not clearly recognizable as spirals .",
    "the nuclear starburst in m  83 was already mentioned in section  [ sec : nmsb ] , but there is also a rich population of young star clusters throughout the disk ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* bohlin et al .  1990 ; larsen & richtler 1999 ) ) , the most massive of which have masses of several times @xmath23 .",

    ", @xcite detected a number of luminous young clusters in the inner lindblad resonance ring at 5 kpc .",
    "@xcite found rather large sizes for these clusters , with estimated half - light radii of about 11 pc .",
    "this is much larger than the typical sizes of milky way open and globular clusters and indeed of ymcs found in most other places , and raises the question whether these objects might be related to the `` faint fuzzy '' star clusters which are located in an annulus of similar radius in the lenticular galaxy ngc  1023 ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* larsen & brodie 2000 ; brodie & larsen 2002 ) ) , but have globular cluster - like ages .",
    "just how similar are the properties of star clusters in different environments , and what might they tell us about the star formation process ? objects like ngc1569-a appear extreme compared to milky way open clusters or even to young lmc clusters : @xcite estimate that ngc1569-a has a half - light surface brightness over 65 times higher than the r136 cluster in the lmc , and 1200 times higher than the mean rich lmc cluster after allowing for evolutionary fading .",
    "do such extreme objects constitute an altogether separate mode of star / cluster formation , or do they simply represent a tail of a distribution , extending down to the open clusters that we encounter locally ? and are ymcs really young analogs of the old gcs observed in the milky way and virtually all other major galaxies ?      one of the best tools to address these questions is the cluster mass function ( mf ) . in the milky way and the magellanic clouds , the mf of young star clusters is well approximated by a power - law @xmath25 where @xmath1 ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* elmegreen & efremov 1997 ; hunter et al .",
    "this is deceptively similar to the _ luminosity _ functions derived in many young cluster systems , but it is important to recognize that luminosity functions are not necessarily identical , or even similar to the underlying mfs ( unless the age distribution is a delta function ) .",
    "unfortunately , mfs are difficult to measure directly . the only practical way to obtain mass estimates for large samples of clusters is from photometry , but because the mass - to - light ratios are strongly age - dependent masses can not be estimated without reliable age information for each individual cluster . as discussed in section",
    "[ sec : hst_esc ] , this is best done by including @xmath17-band imaging , which is costly to obtain in terms of observing time .",
    "so far , mfs have only been constrained for a few , well - studied systems . in the antennae",
    ", @xcite found a power - law shape with exponent @xmath1 over the mass range @xmath26 to @xmath27 , similar to the mf of young lmc clusters .",
    "@xcite find @xmath28 over the range @xmath29 to @xmath23 for m51 , and @xcite find @xmath30 and @xmath31 in ngc  3310 and ngc  6745 .",
    "the many studies which have found similar power - law _ luminosity _",
    "functions are of course consistent with these results , but should not be taken as proof that the mf is as universal as the lf .",
    "conversely , any differences in the lfs observed in different systems would not necessarily imply that the mfs are different .",
    "there are some hints that slight lf variations may be present : @xcite find lf slopes of @xmath32 and @xmath33 in ngc  2207 and ic  2163 , while @xcite and @xcite find somewhat steeper slopes ( @xmath34 ) in several nearby spiral galaxies . while @xcite find @xmath35 for the full sample of antennae clusters , there is some evidence for a steepening at brighter magnitudes with @xmath36 brighter than @xmath37 .",
    "however , measurements of lf slopes are subject to many uncertainties , as completeness and contamination effects can be difficult to fully control , and it is not presently clear how significant these differences are . more data is needed .    another important question is how the mf evolves over time . while the evidence available so far indicates that the mf in most young cluster systems is well approximated by a uniform power - law with slope @xmath1 down to the detection limit",
    ", old gc systems show a quite different behavior . here , the luminosity function is well fit by a roughly log - normal distribution with a peak at @xmath38 ( about @xmath23 for an age of 1015 gyr ) and dispersion @xmath39 mag ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* e.g.  harris & van den bergh 1981 ) ) .",
    "thus , _ old _ globular clusters appear to have a characteristic mass of about @xmath40 , while there is no characteristic mass for _ young _ clusters .",
    "this difference might seem to imply fundamentally different formation mechanisms .",
    "however , model calculations for the milky way gc system by @xcite indicate that this difference can be accounted for by dynamical evolution of the cluster system , which makes the low - mass clusters disrupt more quickly and thereby causes an initial power - law mass distribution to eventually approach the bell - shaped mf seen in old gc systems .",
    "simulations by @xcite and @xcite suggest that an initial power - law mf can evolve towards a bell - shaped distribution also in ellipticals .",
    "it is puzzling , however , that the `` faint fuzzy '' star clusters in ngc  1023 do _ not _ show a turn - over in the mf at @xmath40 even though they appear as old as the normal gcs in ngc  1023 ( which do show the usual turn - over ) . instead",
    ", there is a steady increase in the number of faint fuzzies at least down to the detection limit at @xmath41 ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* larsen & brodie 2000 ) ) .",
    "it appears counter - intuitive that these diffuse objects should be more stable against disruption than compact gcs , although it may be significant that the faint fuzzies seem to be on roughly circular orbits in the disk of ngc  1023 ( burkert et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .    deriving a mf for an intermediate - age sample of clusters would provide an important observational constraint on models for dynamical evolution . in the @xmath42 gyr fossil starburst m82b",
    ", the analysis by @xcite indicates a turn - over in the mf at a mass of about @xmath23 , making the mf rather similar to that of old globular clusters .",
    "this would suggest that the erosion of the mf is already well advanced at an age of @xmath43 years in this system . on the other hand , @xcite find no turn - over in the mass distribution of 3gyr old clusters in the merger remnant ngc  1316 down to their completeness limit at @xmath44 , or about 1 mag below the mass corresponding to the turn - over observed in old gc systems ( accounting for evolutionary fading from 3 gyr to 10 gyrs ) .",
    "thus , while it appears plausible that the mf observed in old gc systems may indeed have evolved from an initial power - law distribution as seen in young cluster systems , more observational constrains would be highly desirable .",
    "here , observations with acs or wfc3 would play a crucial role , since high spatial resolution is required to detect the faintest clusters and separate them from stars and background galaxies .      because power - laws have no characteristic scale , it is hard to make a meaningful division between low - mass open clusters and higher - mass `` super '' clusters in cluster systems with a power - law mf .",
    "the lack of a characteristic mass suggests that there is no fundamental difference between the physical processes behind formation of clusters of various masses .",
    "nevertheless , there are evidently differences in the numbers of ymcs ( according to anyone s preferred definition ) from one galaxy to another . but how significant are these differences ? and in particular , is there an upper limit to the mass of a star cluster that can form in a given galaxy ?    size - of - sample effects may play an important role in explaining the apparent differences between cluster systems in different galaxies . as demonstrated by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "there is a strong correlation between the luminosity of the brightest cluster in a galaxy and the total number of young clusters down to some magnitude limit .",
    "moreover , this relation has the same form as one would expect if the luminosity function is a power - law where the maximum luminosity is simply dictated by sampling statistics ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* fig .  10 in whitmore 2003 ) ) .",
    "monte - carlo simulations indicate that the _ scatter _ around the expected relation ( about 1 mag ) is also consistent with sampling statistics ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* larsen 2002 ) ) .",
    "in other words , current data are consistent with a universal , power - law luminosity function for young clusters in most galaxies , with the brightest clusters simply forming the tail of a continuous distribution .",
    "a similar analysis has yet to be carried out for the _ mass _ distributions of star clusters in a significant sample of galaxies .",
    "while the comparison of maximum cluster luminosity versus total cluster population is suggestive , it has its difficulties . estimating the total cluster population to some magnitude limit is subject to uncertainties , due to the different completeness limits and detection criteria applied in various studies .",
    "@xcite attempted to circumvent this problem by assuming that the total cluster population scales with the galaxy sfr , but here the difficulty is to determine the proper normalization and account for the possibility that the scaling may not be linear ( ( * ? ? ?",

    "all three panels show some degree of correlation , emphasizing the difficulty of disentangling size - of - sample effects from physical effects .",
    "the most obvious interpretation of the correlation between @xmath45 and @xmath46 is a purely _ statistical _ one , i.e.  larger galaxies have more clusters on average , and therefore @xmath45 becomes brighter , by the size - of - sample effect .",
    "the @xmath47 vs.  @xmath45 relation , on the other hand , is suggestive of a _ physical _ explanation : @xmath47 correlates with the gas density , for example ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* kennicutt 1998 ) ) , and the higher gas densities and -pressures in galaxies with high @xmath47 might provide conditions which are conducive for ymc formation ( ( * ? ? ? * elmegreen & efremov 1997 ) ) . an important clue may lie in the fact that the third plot , sfr vs.  @xmath45 , shows the tightest correlation of all .",
    "this suggests that global galaxy properties ( sfr ) are more important than local ones ( @xmath47 ) for a galaxy s ability to form massive clusters .",
    "an alternative metric is to simply compare the luminosities of the two brightest clusters in galaxies .",
    "if the luminosity function is an untruncated power - law , this magnitude difference ( @xmath49mag ) should behave in a predictable way which can then be compared with observations . from an observational point of view",
    ", this approach has a number of attractive features : only the two brightest clusters in a galaxy need be detected , distance uncertainties are irrelevant , and heterogeneous data ( e.g.  use of different bandpasses in different galaxies ) do not constitute a problem .",
    "an obvious disadvantage is that this metric does not `` catch '' cases like ngc  1569 , where the magnitude difference between the two brightest clusters will not reveal the gap down to number 3 .",

    "[ fig : dmobs ] is qualitatively similar to that in fig .",
    "[ fig : dmag ] , peaked towards @xmath49mag=0 and with a tail extending up to larger @xmath49mag values .",
    "quantitatively , a kolmogov - smirnov test returns only a 3% probability that the distribution in fig .",
    "[ fig : dmobs ] is drawn from that in fig .",
    "[ fig : dmag ] , but the agreement improves greatly for a somewhat steeper power - law slope : for @xmath51 and @xmath52 , the k - s test returns a probability of 30% and 77% that the observed @xmath49mag distribution is consistent with the equivalent of fig .",
    "[ fig : dmag ] .",
    "since this comparison is only sensitive to the very upper end of the lf , it may indicate that the slope at the bright end of the lf is typically somewhat steeper than @xmath50 .",
    "one remaining issue is the apparently discontinuous luminosity function in some dwarf galaxies , where the brightest clusters are much _ too luminous _ for the total number of clusters .",
    "it has been suggested that these cases may represent a mode of star formation which is distinct from that operating in larger galaxies , possibly caused by transient high - pressure disturbances ( ( * ? ? ? * elmegreen 2004 ) ) .",
    "again , it may be worth asking how significant these exceptions are .",
    "the median @xmath49mag from fig .",
    "[ fig : dmag ] is 0.76 mag , but in 25% of the cases there is a difference of @xmath49 mag = 1.50 mag or more , and a @xmath49 mag @xmath53 2.5 mag is found in 10% of the cases .",
    "thus , it is not entirely unlikely to find a gap of 2 mag from the brightest to the second - brightest cluster",
    ".    one might argue that it does seem unlikely to form _ two _ or more very massive clusters by chance .",
    "however , the luminosity- ( or mass ) function is a statistical tool which may not apply within small regions , but only when averaged over an entire galaxy . a dwarf galaxy like ngc  1569 may be considered as essentially a single starburst region , whereas a larger galaxy contains a multitude of starforming regions of various sizes .",
    "the experiment on which fig .",
    "[ fig : dmag ] is based does not apply within a region that has been selected _ a priori _ to contain a massive cluster .",
    "for example , if one selects a small subregion around the brightest cluster in a large galaxy , it would be very unlikely to find the second - brightest cluster in the galaxy within that subregion by chance .",
    "a related question is whether the formation of massive clusters is correlated  is there an increased probability of finding one massive cluster forming next to another one ?",
    "the answer appears to be affirmative .",
    "in addition to the case of ngc  1569-a , there are several examples of binary clusters with roughly equal masses in the large magellanic cloud ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* dieball et al .",
    "closer to home , the famous `` double cluster '' @xmath54 and @xmath55 per is another example .",
    "the double cluster , incidentally , is also among the most luminous open clusters known in the milky way .",
    "another point hinting at a universal cluster formation mechanism is the observation that most star clusters seem to have about the same size .",
    "the initial wfpc data for young clusters in the antennae indicated a mean half - light radius of about 18 pc ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* whitmore & schweizer 1995 ) ) , rather large compared to the @xmath213 pc typical of old globular clusters .",
    "this was used as an argument against the idea that the young clusters in the antennae are young globular clusters ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* van den bergh 1995 ) ) , but with wfpc2 data the mean size was revised to @xmath56 pc ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* whitmore et al .  1999 ) ) .",
    "similar results have since been found for star clusters in many other galaxies ( see examples in preceding sections ) .",
    "the discrepancy between size measurements of antennae clusters carried out on wfpc and wfpc2 images illustrates the importance of having sufficient spatial resolution , however .",
    "naively , one might expect clusters to form with a constant density rather than a constant size , but intriguingly , there is little to suggest any significant size - mass correlation for star clusters .",
    "this has now been demonstrated both in young cluster systems in starburst regions ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* zepf et al .  1999 ;",
    "carlson & holtzman 2001 ) ) , in spiral galaxies ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* larsen 2004 ) ) , for old globular clusters in the milky way ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* van den bergh et al .",
    "1991 ) ) and elsewhere ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* kundu & whitmore 2001 ) ) , and even in nuclear star clusters ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* bker et al .  2004 ) ) . in the absence of any such relation ,",
    "it is clear that the most massive clusters will also tend to have very high densities , and explaining these high densities is therefore just a special case of the more general problem why star clusters form with a nearly constant size , rather than with a constant density .",
    "@xcite proposed that the lack of a size - mass relation may be related to a higher star formation efficiency in high - mass clusters , causing them to expand less than lower - mass clusters after the residual gas is blown away , but more work is required to obtain a deeper understanding of this issue .",
    "the lack of a size - mass relation is all the more puzzling because there _ are _ real variations in the sizes of star clusters .",
    "the half - light radii of old globular clusters correlate with galactocentric distance ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* van den bergh et al .  1991 ; mclaughlin 2000 ) ) , and some lenticular galaxies have `` faint fuzzy '' star clusters with much larger sizes than normal open and globular clusters ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* larsen & brodie 2000 ) ) .",
    "this issue clearly merits further investigation .",
    "many of the studies cited in section  [ sec : env ] have found that a high fraction of the luminosity in starburst regions is emitted by clusters or compact sources , although a direct intercomparison is difficult because of the different bandpasses used ( uv through ir ) and different detection limits .",
    "@xcite warn that some of their compact sources may not be individual star clusters , and similar caution applies in other systems , especially as observations are pushed to greater distances where the nature of cluster candidates can not be verified because of insufficient resolution .",
    "nevertheless , there are strong indications that most stars tend to form in groups or clusters , although only a small fraction of all stars eventually end up in _ bound _ clusters . in the milky way ,",
    "@xcite estimate that the vast majority ( 70%-90% ) of star formation in nearby molecular clouds takes place in embedded clusters , while only 4%7% of these embedded clusters survive to become bound clusters with ages similar to that of the pleiades ( @xmath57 years ) .",
    "similar results have been found in other galaxies : in ngc  5253 , @xcite found their data to be consistent with a scenario where all stars are initially born in clusters , of which most disperse on a short time scale ( @xmath58 myrs ) . in the antennae ,",
    "@xcite estimates that at least 20% , and possibly all star formation takes place in clusters , although he also concludes that most are unbound and short - lived .",
    "this also seems consistent with the finding by @xcite ( sec  [ sec : early ] ) that only a small fraction of giant hii regions in late - type galaxies form massive , bound clusters , while the rest are forming unbound associations .",
    "it is unclear how these findings relate to the apparent variations in specific cluster luminosity @xmath59 with host galaxy star formation rate ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* larsen & richtler 2000 ) ) .",
    "these authors found that the fraction of @xmath17-band light from star clusters relative to their host galaxies increases with the area - normalized sfr , from 0.1%1% for most normal spiral galaxies up to the very large fractions ( 20%50% ) found in starbursts .",
    "if nearly all stars initially form in clusters , @xmath59 may reflect a survival- rather than a formation efficiency .",
    "however , other factors such as dust extinction and the details of the star formation history of the host galaxy could also affect @xmath59 . within an on - going , strong starburst ,",
    "a large fraction of the light comes from clusters , leading to a high @xmath59 . after the burst ,",
    "fading alone would not affect @xmath59 ( since field stars and clusters will fade by the same amount ) but cluster disruption would cause @xmath59 to gradually decrease by an amount that depends on the disruption timescale ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* boutloukos & lamers 2003 ) ) .",
    "cluster disruption occurs on several timescales ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* whitmore 2004 ) ) .",
    "initially , the star formation efficiency ( sfe ) within the parent molecular cloud is a critical factor in determining whether or not a given embedded cluster remains bound . unless the sfe exceeds 30%50% ( ( *",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* hills 1980 ; boily & kroupa 2003 ) ) , the cluster is likely to become unbound once the gas is expelled .",
    "even when the sfe is high , a large fraction of the stars may be unbound and eventually disperse away ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* kroupa et al .  2001 ) ) . the high `` infant mortality '' for clusters may represent a combination of rapid disruption of clusters which are unbound altogether and clusters which retain a bound core containing only a small fraction of the initial mass , but interestingly",
    ", this effect appears to be largely independent of cluster mass ( ( * ? ? ? * fall 2004 ) ) . on longer timescales ,",
    "clusters continue to disrupt due to two - body relaxation , tidal shocks and other effects ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* boutloukos & lamers 2003 ) ) which may be instrumental in shaping the globular cluster mass function ( section  [ sec : lfmf ] ) .      a somewhat controverial question , which is related to the disruption timescales , concerns the universality of the stellar mass function ( smf ) in ymcs .",
    "note that the term `` imf '' ( initial mass function ) is deliberately avoided here , since the present - day mass function in a star cluster may differ from the initial one .",
    "if the smf is biased towards high - mass stars , compared e.g.  to a @xcite - type function , the clusters might be rapidly disrupted ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* goodwin 1997 ) ) .",
    "direct observations of individual stars in ymcs are usually beyond reach even with hst , especially at the low - mass end of the smf . however , by measuring structural parameters on hst images and using ground - based high - dispersion spectra to estimate the line - of - sight velocity dispersions of the cluster stars , dynamical mass estimates can be obtained by simple application of the virial theorem .",
    "if the cluster ages are known , the masses thus derived can be compared with ssp model calculations for various smfs .",
    "an increasing amount of such data is now becoming available , but the results remain ambiguous . based on observations by ( * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ho & filippenko ( 1996a,1996b ) ) , @xcite found some evidence for differences in the smf slopes of ngc1569-a ( smf at least as steep as a salpeter law down to 0.1@xmath60 ) and ngc1705 - 1 ( smf may be shallower than salpeter or truncated between @xmath61 and @xmath62 ) , and @xcite also concluded that m82-f has a top - heavy smf .",
    "however , @xcite found m / l ratios consistent with `` normal '' smfs for three clusters in ngc  1569 , @xcite reported `` excellent '' agreement between the dynamical mass of the w3 object in ngc  7252 and ssp model predictions , and @xcite and @xcite found standard kroupa ( 2002)-like smfs for 7 ymcs in a sample of dwarfs and spiral galaxies .",
    "other authors have found a mixture of normal and top - heavy smfs ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* mengel et al .  2002 ; mccrady et al . 2003 ) ) .",
    "at present , it is not clear to what extent these differences are real , or could be a result of different measurement techniques , crowding and resolution effects , as well as the inherent uncertainties in the analysis ( e.g.  assumption of virial equilibrium , effects of mass segregation , different macroturbulent velocities in the atmospheres of the cluster supergiants and the template stars ) .",
    "however , this aspect of ymc research would have been virtually impossible without the symbiosis between hst and high - dispersion spectrographs large ground - based telescopes .",
    "over the past decade , research in extragalactic young star clusters has evolved into a mature field .",
    "this is in no small part due to the complement of instruments available on hst , although the impact of parallel developments in ground - based instrumentation should not be underestimated .",
    "one major advance has been to establish the ubiquity of young massive , globular - like clusters in a wide variety of star - forming environments .",
    "these objects can have sizes and masses which make them virtually identical to the old globular clusters observed in the milky way and indeed around all major galaxies . with few exceptions ,",
    "the luminosity functions of young cluster systems are well approximated by a power - law with exponent @xmath63 .",
    "it appears that random sampling from such a luminosity function can account , to a large extent , for differences in the numbers of ymcs and in the luminosity of the brightest star clusters observed in different galaxies .",
    "so far , no case has been found in which the luminosity of the brightest cluster is limited by anything other than sampling statistics . in other words ,",
    "_ ymcs are present whenever clusters form in large numbers_. studies of the _ mass _ functions of young star clusters are more difficult , but the few studies that have been made seem to indicate that the mass functions are also well approximated by power - laws .",
    "it remains unclear to what extent dwarf galaxies like ngc  1569 and ngc  1705 , with only a few very bright clusters , pose a problem for the idea of a universal cluster luminosity ( or mass ) function and a universal cluster formation mechanism .",
    "@xcite noted that massive star clusters are rare even in actively star forming dwarfs , but when they do form they are accompanied by a high level of star formation activity .",
    "billett et al .",
    "suggested that large - scale flows and gravitational instabilities in the absence of shear may favor the formation of massive clusters in dwarf galaxies .    by focusing on the most extreme starburst environments",
    ", one naturally finds the most extreme cluster populations .",
    "however , a complete picture can only be formed by examining the whole range of environments , from very quiescent , over normal star - forming galaxies , to starbursts , and good progress is being made towards this goal .",
    "an example of the first extreme is ic  1613 , whose extremely low ( but non - vanishing ) star formation rate has produced only a very feeble cluster system . even among `` normal '' spiral galaxies",
    "there are substantial variations in the sfr , and this translates directly to corresponding differences in the richness of the cluster systems . at the other extreme are starbursts like the antennae and m82 , with their exceedingly rich young cluster systems .",
    "while special conditions may lead to the formation of a few massive clusters in some dwarfs , ymc formation apparently does not _ require _ special triggering mechanisms .",
    "this is supported by the study of young clusters in the antennae by @xcite , who found no correlation between strong gradients in the velocity field and the formation sites of star clusters , although it was noted that _",
    "some _ clusters might have been triggered by cloud - cloud collisions . by a slight extrapolation of this argumentation , globular clusters could also have formed by normal star formation processes in the early universe .    a large fraction , possibly the majority , of all stars form in star clusters .",
    "however , only a small fraction of these stars eventually end up as members of _ bound _ star clusters , due to an initially rapid disruption of clusters on timescales of @xmath12 years which appears to be largely independent of mass .",
    "clusters which survive the initial phase of rapid destruction continue to dissolve on longer timescales , and this process may cause an initial power - law mass function to evolve towards the approximately log - normal mf observed in old globular cluster systems .",
    "further progress is likely to come from multi - wavelength campaigns , which will allow detailed analyses of the age- and mass distributions of cluster systems .",
    "is there a universal cluster mass function , as hinted at by the many studies which have found similar power - law luminosity functions ? is the `` infant mortality '' rate everywhere the same ?",
    "can we see the signatures of dynamical evolution ?",
    "a good place to look for such signatures might be in galaxies with rich cluster systems formed over an extended period of time .",
    "also , what are the properties of young clusters in early - type ( sa / sb ) spirals and other environments ( e.  g.low surface brightness galaxies ) which remain poorly studied ? over its lifetime hst has been upgraded several times , each time essentially leaving us with a new , much more capable observatory .",
    "the wide field planetary camera 2 has now been in operation for more than 10 years , and has produced many spectacular results .",
    "we have only just started to see the potential of the _ advanced camera for surveys _ , and the _ wide field camera 3 _ with its panchromatic wavelength coverage from the near - ultraviolet to the infrared has the potential to once more boost the power of hubble by a significant factor .",
