    "polymer theory may serve as an archetype of an approach where the application of the path integral formalism leads both to a quantitative understanding of a whole range of physical , chemical , and biological phenomena as well as to their accurate quantitative description.@xcite most directly this is shown by the edwards model that describes a polymer chain in terms of a path integral and takes into account chain connectivity and self - avoiding interaction.@xcite a textbook derivation maps this simple two - parameter model to the @xmath0 de  gennes limit@xcite of the @xmath1 symmetric field theory .",
    "standard field theoretical tools explain the origin of the scaling laws that govern polymer structural behaviour and allow to calculate the exponents that govern these scaling laws with high accuracy .",
    "one of the generalizations of the above approach extends the theory to describe polymers of complex structure that form networks of interconnected polymer chains.@xcite the intrinsic exponents that govern the scaling of a polymer network are uniquely defined by those of its constituents , star - like subunits known as star polymers@xcite ( see fig . [ hol : fig1 ] ) .    * a. b. *    the exponents that govern the scaling of star polymers are universal in that they depend on space dimension @xmath2 and star functionality @xmath3 only ( the number of chains attached to a common center ) . a chain polymer is recovered . ] currently , star polymers are synthesized with high functionalities and form well - defined objects with interesting industrial , technological , and experimental applications.@xcite    in this paper we attract attention to another recent development in the analysis of the scaling properties of branched polymers.@xcite our analysis concerns the impact of structural disorder on the scaling of polymer stars and chains . for lattice models , where polymers are viewed as self - avoiding walks ( saw ) this type of disorder may be realized by forbidding the saw to visit certain lattice sites , which might be interpreted as lattice dilution . for real polymers in solvents , structural disorder may be implemented by filling a porous medium by a solvent with immersed polymers as shown in fig .",
    "[ hol : fig1 ] .",
    "as follows from our analysis sketched below , for long - range - correlated disorder the polymer behaviour displays a new universality , different from that of a saw on a regular ( undiluted ) lattice .",
    "a notable consequence is that star and chain polymers react in _ qualitatively _ different manner on the presence of disorder : the corresponding scaling exponents _ increase _ for the chains and _ decrease _ for the stars .",
    "we discuss to which physical consequences such a difference in behaviour may lead .",
    "the starting point of our analysis is the edwards continuous chain model , generalized to describe a branched polymer structure , a star polymer .",
    "we describe the conformation of each arm of the star by a path @xmath4 , parameterized by @xmath5 , @xmath6 ( @xmath7 , the gaussian surface of the @xmath8-th arm is related to the contour length of the chain ) , @xmath9 , corresponds to the central point .",
    "the partition function of the system is defined by the path integral:@xcite @xmath10   \\exp \\left [ -\\frac{h_f}{k_bt } \\right]\\prod_{a=2}^f\\delta^d({\\bf r}_a(0)-{\\bf r}_1(0)).\\ ] ] here , the product of @xmath11-functions ensures the star - like configuration of the set of @xmath3 polymer chains described by the hamiltonian : @xmath12 the first term in the r.h.s . of ( [ hol : eq2 ] ) presents chain connectivity whereas the second term describes an excluded volume interaction . instead of introducing structural disorder directly into eq .",
    "( [ hol : eq1 ] ) , we make use of its field theoretical representation .",
    "the corresponding derivations are described in details in refs.@xcite .",
    "the relevant steps read : ( * i * ) we map the continuous chain model ( [ hol : eq1 ] ) onto the @xmath0 limit of @xmath1 symmetric field theory by a familiar laplace transform@xcite in the gaussian surface variables @xmath7 to conjugated chemical potentials ( mass variables ) @xmath13 . in this procedure , the product of @xmath11-functions in ( [ hol : eq1 ] ) is represented by a composite operator of a product of @xmath3 @xmath14-component fields @xmath15 here , @xmath16 is a traceless tensor , @xmath17 is an @xmath18-th component of the @xmath14-vector field @xmath19 and in the sum over wave vectors @xmath20 is restricted by momentum conservation ;    ( * ii * ) we introduce quenched random - temperature - like disorder shifting @xmath21 by random variables @xmath22 .",
    "these have zero mean and correlations that decay at large distances as a power law:@xcite latexmath:[\\[\\label{hol : eq4 }   \\langle\\delta\\mu_a(x)\\delta\\mu_a(y)\\rangle \\sim    configurational average over spatially homogeneous and isotropic disorder and the exponent @xmath8 governs the correlation decay . as seen below",
    ", this leads to long range correlated disorder effects for @xmath24 ;    ( * iii * ) to perform the configurational average of the free energy , we make use of the replica method resulting in field theoretical lagrangean of two couplings @xmath25 , @xmath26 : @xmath27 note that the evaluation of the theory ( [ hol : eq5 ] ) involves a simultaneous polymer ( @xmath0 ) and replica ( @xmath28 ) limit .",
    "it is this anticipated double limit that allows us@xcite to write the lagrangean in terms of two coupling only . a third coupling appears@xcite for @xmath29 .",
    "we apply the field theoretical renormalization group ( rg ) approach to extract the universal content of ( [ hol : eq5 ] ) . in this approach",
    ", the change of the couplings @xmath30 under renormalization defines a flow in parametric space , governed by corresponding @xmath31-functions @xmath32 , @xmath33 .",
    "the fixed points ( fps ) @xmath34 of this flow are the solutions to the system of equations : @xmath35 .",
    "if a stable fp exists and is accessible , it determines the scaling behaviour of the polymer system .",
    "in particular , for a single polymer star of @xmath3 arms of equal length @xmath36 in a good solvent the partition sum ( number of possible configurations ) scales as @xmath37 with a non - universal fugacity @xmath38 and the universal star exponent @xmath39.@xcite the latter is uniquely defined by the stable fp value of the anomalous dimension associated with the composite operator ( [ hol : eq3 ] ) .",
    "we make use of two complementary perturbation theory expansions to calculate coordinates of the fps and values of the exponents . in a first approximation",
    "we apply an expansion in@xcite @xmath40 and @xmath41 which allows for a qualitative description of the phenomena . in a further approach",
    "we apply perturbation theory in the renormalized couplings @xmath42 and @xmath43 evaluated at fixed dimension @xmath44 for a series of fixed values of the correlation parameter @xmath8.@xcite in the latter case we proceed within a two - loop approximation refining the analysis by a resummation of the divergent rg series ( see ref.@xcite for details ) . the fp picture that arises from our calculations",
    "is shown qualitatively in fig .",
    "[ hol : fig2 ] .",
    "* a. b. *    both calculation schemes display a range @xmath45 , of values for @xmath8 where the long - range - correlated fp ( lr , @xmath46 , @xmath47 ) is stable and governs polymer scaling . for @xmath48 ,",
    "no stable fp is found .",
    "this has been interpreted@xcite as a collapse of a polymer coil for strongly correlated disorder . for @xmath49 the pure fp ( p , @xmath46 , @xmath50 ) is stable and polymer scaling",
    "is not perturbed by disorder . as far as power counting implies that the @xmath43-term in ( [ hol : eq5 ] ) is irrelevant in the rg sense for @xmath51 it is natural to identify @xmath52 .",
    "nonetheless , in first order approximation of the @xmath53-expansion one finds that the lr fp is stable in the unphysical region @xmath54 .",
    "our two - loop calculations at fixed @xmath55 for @xmath44 however result in @xmath56 , @xmath57 allowing for direct physical interpretations .",
    "qualitatively , the impact of disorder can be seen already from the first order @xmath53 results . comparing the @xmath39 exponent ( [ hol : eq6 ] ) for the cases when the structural disorder is absent ( or is short - range - correlated , fig .",
    "[ hol : fig1]a),@xcite @xmath58 , and when it is long - range - correlated ( fig .",
    "[ hol : fig1]b)@xcite , @xmath59 we find : @xmath60    as one can see from this estimate , the exponent difference changes sign at @xmath61 .",
    "the two - loop calculations slightly shift this result towards @xmath62 while otherwise confirming the overall picture with more accurate numerical values for the exponents.@xcite in fig .",
    "[ hol : fig3 ] we plot the first order @xmath53-curves for @xmath39 together with the resummed two - loop estimates for @xmath44 .",
    "a complete account of the numerical values of the exponents is given in ref.@xcite a prominent feature that follows from these results is that the effect of long - range - correlated disorder on polymer chains and polymer stars is qualitatively different .",
    "whereas correlated disorder leads to an _ increase _ of @xmath39 for chain polymers ( i.e. for @xmath63 , @xmath64 ) , the same type of disorder _ decreases _ the @xmath39 exponent for the proper star polymers ( @xmath65 ) . below",
    "we discuss some possible consequences of this difference .",
    "for @xmath66 we also observe that @xmath39 decreases monotonically as function of @xmath3 for any valid value of @xmath8 in the same way as it does for polymers in a good solvent : @xmath67 for @xmath68 .",
    "furthermore , within the accuracy the data confirms a convexity from below of this function for valid values of @xmath8 as well as for the @xmath53 expansion .",
    "the latter property ensures that polymer stars remain mutually repulsive in correlated disorder@xcite .",
    "it has been recognized by now that star exponents come into play for the qualitative description and quantitative of different phenomena , where statistics of branched self avoiding and random walks is involved .",
    "the examples of such phenomena include short - range interaction of branched polymers in a good solvent),@xcite diffusion - controlled reactions in the presence of polymers,@xcite and , more generally , they are part of a multifractal description of diffusion limited growth in a laplacian field.@xcite recently , star exponents have been used to estimate the thermal denaturation transition of dna.@xcite our analysis opens a way to consider the impact of long - range - correlated disorder on the above phenomena .    a somewhat surprising effect that results from our calculations concerns the static separation in a solution of diluted chains and star polymers of equal molecular weight inside a porous medium .",
    "following the estimates of the star exponents we predict that in a correlated medium star polymers will exert a higher osmotic pressure than chain polymers and in general higher branched star polymers will be expelled more strongly from the correlated porous medium . on the opposite",
    ", polymer chains will prefer a stronger correlated medium to a less or uncorrelated medium of the same density.@xcite    a generalization of our approach to the case of star polymers built from chains of different species@xcite will be presented elsewhere.@xcite",
