    "we present an answer to this intriguing question in our forthcoming paper @xcite .",
    "we have shown that the resolution of the initial singularity of the flat frw model with massless scalar field is due to the modification of the model at the _ classical _ level by making use of the loop geometry .",
    "the modification is parametrized by the _ continuous _ parameter @xmath159 .",

    "the former case ( big @xmath66 ) contradicts the data of observational cosmology ( there was no bb in the near past ! ) and leads to weakly controlled modification of the expression for the curvature @xmath18 , i.e. gravitational part of the hamiltonian ( see the appendix ) .",
    "the latter case ( small @xmath66 ) gives much better approximation for the classical hamiltonian ( see the appendix ) , but may easily lead to densities much higher than the planck scale density , where the classical formalism is believed to be inadequate . finding specific value of the parameter @xmath66 ,",

    "our approach is quite different from the so - called effective or polymerization method ( see , e.g. @xcite ) , where the replacement @xmath160 in the hamiltonian finishes the procedure of quantization . in our method this replacement has been done entirely at the _ classical _ level : eq .",

    "the elementary observables @xmath125 and @xmath126 constitute a complete set of constants of motion in the constraint surface .",
    "they are used to parametrize the physical phase space and are `` building blocks '' for the compound observables like the energy density of the scalar field and the geometrical operators .",
    "so they have deep physical meaning .",

    "it may happen , however , that the value of the parameter @xmath66 can not be determined , for some reason , theoretically .",
    "the story may turn out to be similar to the case of the short - range _ repulsive _ part of the potential of the nucleon - nucleon interaction introduced to explain the scattering data @xcite and the nuclear matter saturation of energy @xcite .",
    "in such a case @xmath66 will become a phenomenological variable parameterizing our ignorance of microscopic properties of the universe .",
    "an independent source of information on discreteness aspects of geometry is the observational cosmology .",

    "if we choose @xmath163 in the form of the square @xmath167 with sides length @xmath65 , the expression for a _ small _ value of @xmath168 has the form @xcite @xmath169 and we have @xmath170    in the standard lqc the @xmath171 holonomy corrections are ignored ( see , e.g. @xcite ) . it was found in @xcite that including higher order corrections leads to new curvature singularities different from the initial singularity and increases an ambiguity problem of loop cosmology .",
    "however , the holonomy corrections do not change the result that the big bounce is a consequence of the loopy nature of geometry @xcite .    taking only the first term of ( [ finite ] ) leads to the simplest modification of gravity , but may be insufficient for the description of the inflationary phase .",
