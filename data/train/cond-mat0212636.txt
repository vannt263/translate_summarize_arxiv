    "in two recent papers,@xcite hereafter denoted by i and ii , respectively , an effective field theory has been developed that describes the quantum ferromagnetic transition in disordered itinerant electron systems , and the exact critical behavior was determined for all spatial dimensions @xmath0 .",
    "soft modes in addition to the order parameter fluctuations , viz .",
    ", diffusive particle - hole excitations ( `` diffusons '' ) , were found to play a crucial role in the determination of the critical behavior .",
    "this theory studied the transition as it is approached from the paramagnetic phase .",
    "the critical behavior in the ferromagnetic phase , in particular the exponent @xmath1 , was obtained from scaling arguments .",
    "this raises the following question : in the ferromagnetic phase of a heisenberg magnet , the existence of spin waves , which are the goldstone modes that result from the spontaneous breaking of the rotational symmetry in spin space , changes the soft - mode spectrum compared to the paramagnetic phase . given the importance of the soft modes for the critical behavior , will the goldstone modes invalidate the scaling arguments based on a theory for the paramagnetic phase ?",
    "a related question follows from the fact that the goldstone modes , contrary to the soft particle - hole excitations , exist at nonzero temperature as well as at @xmath2 .",
    "therefore , if there were an observable whose leading critical behavior depended on the goldstone modes , then one would expect that observable to exhibit classical critical behavior on the ferromagnetic side of the phase transition , even at temperatures low enough for the system to otherwise exhibit quantum critical behavior .",
    "in such a case , the scaling arguments used in ii might still be formally correct , but their region of validity would vanish .    in the present paper",
    "we investigate the validity of the scaling arguments used before .",
    "we will find that they were correct , and the critical behavior obtained in ii was indeed exact , even on the ferromagnetic side of the transition . to this end",
    ", we develop the ferromagnetic analog of the theory described in i and ii . the general strategy is to derive a theory that expresses the system in terms of the order parameter fluctuations , and any other soft modes that couple to them .",
    "we then analyze the resulting theory to determine the critical behavior of the system as it approaches the transition from the ferromagnetic phase .",

    "we have shown that the presence of ferromagnetic goldstone modes , or spin waves , does not change the critical behavior compared to the one obtained by supplementing results from the paramagnetic phase with scaling arguments .",
    "we have also given a very simple generalized landau theory for this problem , which takes into accout the effects of soft fermionic modes independent of the order parameter , and which yields the correct critical behavior in all dimensions @xmath0 apart from logarithmic corrections to power - law scaling .",

    "the exact critical behavior is mean - field like .",
    "we finally come back to some of the points mentioned in the introduction .",
    "we have shown , by explicitly considering the ordered phase , that the scaling arguments used in i and ii to extract the critical behavior of the magnetization were correct , and can be justified by a rg analysis . in particular , the presence of magnetic goldstone modes does not invalidate these arguments since the transverse fermionic modes and the magnetic goldstone modes essentially just switch roles as one goes into the ferromagnetic phase .",
    "we mention , however , that we have not addressed the question of the size of the quantum scaling region for any particular observable .",
    "this question can only be answered by an explicit crossover calculation for the observable of interest , which follows the behavior of the observable through the entire critical region at @xmath131 .",
    "another point of interest is the relation between the theory developed here and ref .  .",
    "like hertz s theory , the latter was a pure landau - ginzburg - wilson theory , i.e. , a field theory formulated entirely in terms of the order parameter field ; the fermionic degrees of freedom had been integrated out .",
    "this integrating out of soft modes resulted in nonlocal vertices that made the theory unsuitable for explicit calculations , but the critical behavior could be extracted by a combination of power counting and scaling arguments .",
    "it is interesting to see that the current series of papers has completely vindicated this treatment . in particular , the equation of state derived in ref .",
    "( [ eq:2.9a ] ) expanded in powers of @xmath132 , and the critical behavior determined in the nonlocal theory was indeed exact except for the logarithmic corrections to scaling in @xmath117 that were discussed in ii .",
    "it is also interesting to see that the much simpler generalized landau theory of sec .",
    "[ subsec : ii.b ] , which is based on a gaussian approximation , reproduces the results of ref .  , and thus is also exact except for the logarithms .",
    "the reason is that , as we have seen , only two classes of non - gaussian terms ultimately contribute to the critical fixed point , namely , the terms of @xmath133 and those of @xmath129 , and both of these lead only to logarithmic corrections to the gaussian critical behavior .",
    "section [ sec : ii ] therefore provides a very simple way to obtain the essentially exact critical behavior , but of course this is clear only _ a posteriori _ once the rg analysis has been performed .",
