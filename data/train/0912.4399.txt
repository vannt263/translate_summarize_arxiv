    "in highly evolved giants , the pristine lithium has been already well depleted from the stellar atmosphere due to convective dilution with the internal layers where it has been burned . if lithium is observed , its abundance is ascribed to temporary production due to the action of the @xcite mechanism : @xmath4be is produced by fusion of @xmath5he with @xmath6he , and rapidly transported to stellar regions where it can be converted into @xmath4li by electron - capture .",
    "envelope models of asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars @xcite , in which the temperature at the bottom of their hot bottom convective envelopes ( t@xmath7 ) reaches the hydrogen burning layers , show that the @xmath5he(@xmath8be can act ( at t@xmath7@xmath040mk ) .",
    "these models were able to explain the high lithium abundances found in some luminous red giants , and the process took the name of hot bottom burning ( hbb ) .",
    "a different , slow mixing process named  cool bottom processing \" @xcite is instead at the basis of the lithium abundances seen in lower luminosity red giants ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the physical reasons of this process are not well studied , while the nucleosynthesis in hbb is simply based on time  dependent mixing in plain convection zones . apart from being a key process for the lithium production ,",
    "hbb is the key mechanism necessary to process to nitrogen the carbon present in the envelopes of carbon stars , that becomes active at slightly larger t@xmath7@xmath065mk .",
    "observationally , luminous agb stars lose their carbon star character when they are lithium rich , although a small luminosity interval may be characterized by stars that are both lithium and carbon rich @xcite , as in fact occurs in the most luminous fraction of the j stars @xcite . in the most massive agb stars , and especially in low metallicity agb stars , t@xmath7  becomes larger than @xmath080mk , and also the on chain of the cno cycle becomes active . in these envelopes , oxygen is cycled to nitrogen , and its abundance can be dramatically reduced .",
    "thus some models attribute the existence of anomalous stars in globular clusters ( gcs ) , having low oxygen and high sodium , to the formation of a second stellar generation ( sg ) including matter processed by hbb ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "other models attribute the formation of the sg to the ejecta of fast rotating massive stars ( frms , see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or even to pollution from gas expelled during highly non - conservative evolution of massive binaries @xcite , although this latter model in particular can not explain the very high fraction of sg stars present in most of the gcs so far examined @xcite .",
    "the lithium yield from agb stars of different mass may contribute to understand the role ( if any ) of these stars in the formation of the sg in gcs .",
    "it is commonly believed that the polluting matter must be diluted with pristine matter to explain the abundance patterns , such as the na  o anticorrelation ( prantzos & carbonnel 2005 , dantona & ventura 2007 ) . if the progenitors of the sg stars are massive stars , for sure they do not have any lithium left , and the lithium in the sg must be due to the mixing with pristine gas .",
    "if instead the progenitors are massive agb stars , they may have a non negligible lithium yield , that must be taken into account in the explanation of the sg abundances .     in halo stars and in scarcely evolved stars in three gcs .",

    "the data for three clusters are added , at their [ fe / h ] content , taken from @xcite scale .",
    "the references for the clusters data are in the figure label .",
    "notice that the three open triangles of ngc  6397 , at much lower @xmath9(li ) than the other points , refer to subgiants , in which lithium is reduced by mixing .",
    "although the data analysis is not homogeneous among the different samples , the figure shows interesting trends . the lithium spread in the field stars in the range of metallicities of the clusters",
    "ngc  6397 and ngc  6752 is very small around a plateau value log@xmath9(li)@xmath02.2 for the non lte abundances , and slightly larger for the lte determinations .",
    "in fact the triangles at log@xmath9(li)@xmath11  are lower mass stars for which depletion is expected @xcite . the wmap  big bang nucleosynthesis ",
    "standard \" abundance , log@xmath9(li)=2.72 @xcite is much larger than the plateau abundance .",
    "the lithium spread in the clusters appears a bit larger , although @xcite point out that in ngc  6397 it is consistent with the observational error .",
    "we should expect a larger lithium spread among gc stars if there are sg stars , even if the pollutors gas ( agb or massive stars envelopes ) has been diluted with pristine gas @xcite .",
    "the dilution is very plausible if there is a direct correlation between lithium and sodium abundances , as convincingly shown in ngc  6752 @xcite .",
    "a similar correlation in ngc  6397 is based only on the high sodium abundance of the three subgiants plotted as open triangles @xcite , and is not convincing among the stars of 47  tuc @xcite that may suffer from normal depletion mechanisms due to their larger iron content @xcite .",
    "in addition , according to @xcite , two stars in ngc  6397 differ by @xmath00.6dex in oxygen , but have  normal \" log@xmath9(li)@xmath02.3 : this is certainly not easily compatible with a simple dilution model , and may require that the pollutors are also important lithium producers .",
    "in fact , if the agb pollutors produce enough lithium , a dilution model must take it into account .",
    "notice that the dilution model is not so straightforward as we may think a priori : it will include a fraction @xmath12  of matter with pristine li , plus a fraction ( 1-@xmath12 ) having the li of the ejecta ( so , either the abundance of the agb ejecta in the agb mass range involved in the sg formation , or zero li for the frms model ) .",
    "the dilution required to explain a given range in observed li is different if we assign to the pristine li the value log@xmath9(li)=2.72 ( see above ) , or the atmospheric pop.ii value ( @xmath02.36 ) , or some intermediate value .",
    "in addition , if we are assuming that the uniform surface abundance of li in pop.ii is due to a depletion mechanism , also the abundance resulting from the dilution model must be decreased to take into account a similar depletion factor .    a different interesting problem is posed by the gcs in which a  blue \" main sequence ( ms ) has been revealed from precise hst photometry , namely @xmath13  cen@xcite and ngc  2808 .",
    "the blue ms can only be interpreted as a very high helium ( mass fraction y@xmath00.38 ) ms @xcite .",
    "actually , in ngc  2808 three ms well separated each other in color are present @xcite , corresponding to three main helium content values , and in agreement with the predictions made from the distribution of stars in the very extended and multimodal horizontal branch @xcite .",
    "as the blue mss are well detached in color , all their stars must have helium content in a very strict range of values practically a unique value of helium .",
    "this poses a problem for the frms model , in which the stars are formed in the discs ejected by the progenitors . in this model",
    ", the sg helium abundance will reflect the abundance in the disc , that will vary from one massive star to another , or even will be linked to the evolutionary stage at which the stellar envelope matter is lost @xcite .",
    "consequently , stars born out of such discs will show a spread in helium abundances , that will result in a broadened ms rather than in a well detached blue ms @xcite . on the contrary",
    ", @xcite noticed that the helium abundances of super  agb stars envelopes are within the small range 0.36@xmath14y@xmath140.38 @xcite , and @xcite have shown that a full chemo ",
    "hydrodynamical model of the cluster can provide a reasonable interpretation of the three mss of ngc  2808 , _ provided that the blue ms is formed directly by matter ejected from the super ",
    "agb range , undiluted with pristine gas_. in the future , spectroscopic observations of the blue ms in @xmath13  cen  and ngc  2808 will provide a falsification of this hypothesis , e.g. by means of the oxygen and sodium abundance revealed .",
    "in particular lithium can be an important test too , as it could provide an independent calibration of the mass loss rate in the super  agb phase .",
    "already some observations of lithium at the turnoff of @xmath13  cen  are available ( bonifacio et al . 2009 , in preparation ) , but it is not clear whether they contain stars belonging to the blue ms .",
    "our computations thus have two aims : 1 ) to compute the average lithium abundance in the envelopes of different evolving agb masses , and show its dependence on the mass loss formulation ; 2 ) to provide the first computation of the super  agb stars lithium yields , when using the  standard \" mass loss rate formulation adopted for the massive agb stars .",
    "the results presented here can be applied to model the lithium abundance in the sg of different gcs .",

    ".,width=264 ]    table 1 also includes the standard results with mass spacings of 0.5@xmath1 .",
    "the behaviour of the lithium average abundance is not perfectly monotonic , but there is a general trend ( decreasing abundances for increasing initial mass ) that is inverted as soon as we deal with the super ",
    "agb models . the physical conditions in super  agb stars are in fact more extreme : their luminosity is larger , so that we have to deal with larger mass loss rates , and they achieve a larger t@xmath7 , so that more extreme hbb nucleosynthesis is expected .",
    "hbb begins very early during the star evolution . increasing the mass ,",
    "the entire lithium production and destruction phase occurs before the onset of thermal pulses , as we show in figure [ f5 ] .",
    "given the chosen mass loss law , the 8@xmath1  evolution actually may not even reach the thermal pulse phase .",
    "the yield of the 8@xmath1  becomes enormous .",
    "of course , a different mass loss law may dramatically decrease the lithium average abundances .",
    "our results show that the lithium yield from massive agb stars is dramatically dependent on the adopted mass loss formulation .",
    "if we take our  standard \" results in table 1 at face value , ignoring the big question mark on mass loss , the yields can be used to predict the lithium expected in the sg , if the sg is a result of star formation from agb ejecta diluted with pristine gas .",
    "the abundances will depend mainly on the mass range of the agb progenitors : if the ejecta of masses in the range 4.5  6@xmath1  are involved , their abundance is log@xmath9(li)@xmath02 , 0.7dex smaller than the big bang abundance . in order to explain the abundances observed in ngc  6397 or in ngc  6752 , a dilution model including the ejecta of these agb stars will require only a slightly smaller percentage of pristine matter , with respect to a model including the lithium free frms , and we can not discriminate between the two models",
    "the situation is different for the cases in which super  agb ejecta may be involved .",
    "in fact the main result of these computations is that the lithium yield becomes very large in the super  agb evolution : it may become much larger than the population i abundance for progenitor masses of @xmath08@xmath1 .",
    "this star has an o  ne core of 1.36@xmath1 , so it is close to the mass limit of the super ",
    "agb range .",
    "of course , this very high lithium production is linked to our own modelling of the physics of massive agb stars and super  agb stars , and in particular to the choice of the mass loss law .",
    "more generally , these models predict that the stars belonging to the blue main sequence of @xmath13 cen and ngc  2808 can be richer in lithium than the other sg stars in gcs , if they were born directly from super ",
    "agb ejecta , as we propose to explain their high and uniform helium abundance .",
    "if this prediction will be demonstrated to be incorrect , the mass loss rates from super  agb stars ( and massive agb stars as well ) must be revised downwards . as a consequence , the lithium production from massive agb stars will not be significant , and both dilution models , either with agb stars or with frms matter , will not provide different informations for lithium .",
