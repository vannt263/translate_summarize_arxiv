    "implicitization is the problem of transforming a given parametric representation of an algebraic variety into its implicit representation as the zero set of polynomials .",
    "most algorithms for elimination and implicitization are based on multivariate resultants or grbner bases , but current implementations of these methods are often too slow",
    ". when the variety is a hypersurface , the coefficients of the implicit equation can also be computed by way of numerical linear algebra @xcite , provided the newton polytope of that implicit equation can be predicted a priori .",
    "the problem of predicting the newton polytope was recently solved independently by three sets of authors , namely , by emiris , konaxis and palios @xcite , esterov and khovanskii @xcite , and in our joint papers with tevelev @xcite .",
    "a main conclusion of these papers can be summarized as follows : _ the newton polytope of the implicit equation is a mixed fiber polytope_.    the first objective of the present article is to explain this conclusion and to present the software package trim for computing such mixed fiber polytopes .",
    "the name of our program stands for _ tropical implicitization _ , and it underlines our view that the prediction of newton polytopes is best understood within the larger context of tropical algebraic geometry . the general theory of tropical elimination developed in @xcite unifies earlier results on discriminants @xcite and on generic polynomial maps whose images can have any codimension @xcite .",
    "the second objective of this article is to explain the main results of tropical elimination theory and their implementation in trim .",
    "numerous hands - on examples will illustrate the use of the software . at various places we give precise pointers to @xcite and @xcite , so as to highlight similarities and differences among the different approaches to the subject .",
    "our presentation is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we start out with a quick guide to trim by showing some simple computations . in section 3",
    "we explain mixed fiber polytopes .",
    "that exposition is self - contained and may be of independent interest to combinatorialists . in section 4",
    "we discuss the computation of mixed fiber polytopes in the context of elimination theory , and in section 5 we show how the tropical implicitization problem is solved in trim .",
    "theorem 5.1 expresses the newton polytope of the implicit equation as a mixed fiber polytope . in section 6",
    "we present results in tropical geometry on which the development of trim is based , and we explain various details concerning our algorithms and their implementation .",
    "the first step is to download trim from the following website which contains information for installation in linux :    http://math.mit.edu/~jyu/trim    trim is a collection of c++ programs which are glued together and integrated with the external software polymake @xcite using perl scripts .",
    "the language perl was chosen for ease of interfacing between various programs .",
    "the fundamental problem in tropical implicitization is to compute the newton polytope of a hypersurface which is parametrized by laurent polynomials with sufficiently generic coefficients . as an example we consider the following three laurent polynomials in two unknowns @xmath0 and @xmath1 with sufficiently generic coefficients @xmath2 : @xmath3 we seek the unique ( up to scaling ) irreducible polynomial @xmath4 which vanishes on the image of the corresponding morphism @xmath5 . using our software trim ,",
    "the newton polytope of the polynomial @xmath4 can be computed as follows .",
    "we first create a file input with the contents    ....    [ x , y ] [ x^(-2)*y^(-2 ) + x + x*y ,    x^2 + y + x^(-1 ) ,",
    "y^2 + x^(-1)*y^(-1 ) + y^(-1 ) ] ....    here the coefficients are suppressed : they are tacitly assumed to be generic .",
    "we next run a perl script using the command ./trim.prl input .",
    "the output produced by this program call is quite long .",
    "it includes the lines    ....    vertices 1   9 2 0   1   0 9 2   1   0 9 0   1   0 0 9   1   6 6 0   1   2 2 8   1   0 6 6   1   2 8 2   1   6 0 6   1   0 0 0   1   9 0 0   1   2 0 9   1   8 2 2   ....    ignoring the initial 1 , this list consists of @xmath6 lattice points in @xmath7 , and these are precisely the vertices of the newton polytope of @xmath4 .",
    "the above output format is compatible with the polyhedral software polymake @xcite .",
    "we find that the newton polytope has @xmath8 facets , @xmath9 edges , and @xmath6 vertices .",
    "further down in the output , trim prints a list of all lattice points in the newton polytope , and it ends by telling us the number of lattice points :    ....    n_lattice_points 383 ....    each of the @xmath10 lattice points @xmath11 represents a monomial @xmath12 which might occur with non - zero coefficient in the expansion of @xmath4 .",
    "hence , to recover the coefficients of @xmath4 we must solve a linear system of @xmath13 equations with @xmath10 unknowns .",
    "interestingly , in this example , @xmath14 of the @xmath10 monomials always have coefficient zero in @xmath4 . even when @xmath15 are completely generic , the number of monomials in @xmath4 is only @xmath16 .",
    "the command ./trim.prl implements a certain algorithm , to be described in the next sections , whose input consists of @xmath17 lattice polytopes in @xmath18 and whose output consists of one lattice polytope in @xmath19 . in our example , with @xmath20 , the input consists of three triangles and the output consisted of a three - dimensional polytope .",
    "these are depicted in figure 1 .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     the program also works in higher dimensions but the running time quickly increases .",
    "for instance , consider the hypersurface in @xmath21 represented by the following four laurent polynomials in @xmath22 , written in trim format :    ....    [ x , y , z ] [ x*y + z + 1 ,   x*z + y + 1 ,   y*z + x + 1 ,   x^3 + y^5 + z^7 ] ....    it takes @xmath23 a few moments to inform us that the newton polytope of this hypersurface has @xmath24 vertices and contains precisely @xmath25 lattice points .",
    "the @xmath26-vector of this four - dimensional polytope equals @xmath27 .",
    "the examples above may serve as illustrations for the results in the papers @xcite and @xcite .",
    "emiris , konaxis and palios @xcite place the emphasis on computational complexity , they present a precise formula for plane parametric curves , and they allow for the map to given by rational functions . esterov and khovanskii develop a general theory of polyhedral elimination , which parallels the tropical approach in @xcite , and which includes implicitization as a very special case .",
    "a formula for the leading coefficients of the implicit equation is given in @xcite .",
    "this formula is currently not implemented in trim but it could be added in a future version .",
    "what distinguishes trim from the approaches in @xcite and @xcite is the command trci which computes the tropical variety of a generic complete intersection .",
    "the relevant mathematics will be reviewed in section 6 .",
    "this command is one of the ingredients in the implementation of tropical implicitization .",
    "the input again consists of @xmath28 laurent polynomials in @xmath17 variables whose coefficients are tacitly assumed to be generic , or , equivalently , of @xmath28 lattice polytopes in @xmath17-space .",
    "here it is assumed that @xmath29 .",
    "if equality holds then the program simply computes the mixed volume of the given polytopes . as an example , delete the last line from the previous input file :    ....    [ x , y , z ] [ x*y + z + 1 ,   x*z + y + 1 ,   y*z + x + 1 ]    ....    the command ./trci.prl input computes the mixed volume of the three given lattice polytopes in @xmath7 . here",
    "the given polytopes are triangles .",
    "the last line in the output shows that their mixed volume equals five .",
    "now repeat the experiment with the input file input as follows :    .... [ x , y , z ] [ x*y + z + 1 ,   x*z + y + 1 ] ....    the output is a one - dimensional tropical variety given by five rays in @xmath7 :    ....    dim 1    rays   0 -1 -1   0   0   1   1   0   0   0   1   0 -1   1   1    maximal_cones 0 1 2 3 4    multiplicities 2 1 1 1 1 ....",
    "note that the first ray , here indexed by 0 , has multiplicity two .",
    "this scaling ensures that the sum of the five rays equals the zero vector @xmath30 .    for a more interesting example , let us tropicalize the complete intersection of two generic hypersurfaces in @xmath31 .",
    "we prepare input as follows :    ....    [ a , b , c , d , e ] [ a*b + b*c + c*d + d*e + a*e + 1 ,   a*b*c + b*c*d + c*d*e + d*e*a + e*a*b ] ....    when applied to these two polynomials in five unknowns , the command ./trci.prl input produces a three - dimensional fan in @xmath32 .",
    "this fan has @xmath33 rays and it has @xmath34 maximal cones .",
    "each maximal cone is the cone over a triangle or a quadrangle , and it has multiplicity one .",
    "the rays are    ....    rays -1   1   0   0   1 -1   1   1 -1   3   0   1   0   0   1 -1   3 -1   1   1 ....",
    "@xmath35    the rays are labeled @xmath36 , in the order in which they were printed .",
    "the maximal ( three - dimensional ) cones appear output in the format    ....",
    "maximal_cones 0 1 2 3 0 1 7 10 0 1 12 0 3 4 7 0 3 12 0 7 12 ....",
    "@xmath37    it is instructive to compute the tropical intersection of two generic hypersurfaces with the same support .",
    "for example , consider the input file    ....    [ x , y , z ] [ 1 + x + y + z + x*y + x*z + y*z + x*y*z ,   1 + x + y + z + x*y + x*z + y*z + x*y*z ] ....    as before , the reader should imagine that the coefficients are generic rational numbers instead of one s .",
    "the tropical complete intersection determined by these two equations consists of the six rays normal to the six facets of the given three - dimensional cube .",
    "the same output would be produced by jensen s software gfan @xcite , which computes arbitrary tropical varieties , provided we input the two equations with generic coefficients .",
    "we now describe the construction of mixed fiber polytopes .",
    "these generalize ordinary fiber polytopes @xcite , and hence they generalize secondary polytopes @xcite .",
    "the existence of mixed fiber polytopes was predicted by mcdonald @xcite and michiels and cools @xcite in the context of polynomial systems solving .",
    "they were first constructed by mcmullen @xcite , and later independently by esterov and khovanskii @xcite .",
    "the presentation in this section is written entirely in the language of combinatorial geometry , and it should be of independent interest to some of the readers of ziegler s text book @xcite . there are no polynomials or varieties in this section , neither classical nor tropical .",
    "the connection to elimination and tropical geometry will be explained in subsequent sections .",
    "consider a linear map @xmath38 and a @xmath39-dimensional polytope @xmath40 whose image @xmath41 is a @xmath42-dimensional polytope in @xmath43 .",
    "if @xmath0 is any point in the interior of @xmath44 then its fiber @xmath45 is a polytope of dimension @xmath46 .",
    "the _ fiber polytope _ is defined as the minkowski integral @xmath47 it was shown in @xcite that this integral defines a polytope of dimension @xmath46 .",
    "the fiber polytope @xmath48 lies in an affine subspace of @xmath49 which is a parallel translate of @xmath50 .",
    "billera and sturmfels @xcite used the notation @xmath51 for the fiber polytope , and they showed that its faces are in bijection with the coherent polyhedral subdivisions of @xmath44 which are induced from the boundary of @xmath52 .",
    "we here prefer the notation @xmath48 over the notation @xmath51 , so as to highlight the dependence on @xmath53 for fixed @xmath52 and varying @xmath53 .",
    "[ 3cube ] let @xmath54 and take @xmath52 to be the standard @xmath55-cube @xmath56 we also set @xmath57 and we fix the linear map @xmath58 then @xmath41 is the line segment @xmath59 $ ] . for @xmath60 ,",
    "each fiber @xmath61 is either a triangle , a quadrangle or a pentagon .",
    "since the fibers have a fixed normal fan over each open segment @xmath62 , we find @xmath63 hence the fiber polygon is really just the minkowski sum of two triangles , two quadrangles and two pentagon , and this turns out to be a hexagon : @xmath64 in the next section we shall demonstrate how trim can be used to compute fiber polytopes .",
    "the output produced will be the planar hexagon which is gotten from the coordinates above by applying the linear map @xmath65 .",
    "hence trim produces the following coordinatization : @xmath66 it is no big news to polytope aficionados that the fiber polygon of the @xmath55-cube is a hexagon .",

    "we get the secondary polytopes .",
    "suppose that @xmath52 is a polytope with @xmath17 vertices in @xmath49 and let @xmath71 denote the standard @xmath72-simplex in @xmath19 .",
    "there exists a linear map @xmath73 such that @xmath74 , and this linear map is unique if we prescribe a bijection from the vertices of @xmath71 onto the vertices of @xmath52 .",
    "the polytope @xmath75 is called the _ secondary polytope _ of @xmath52 ; see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* definition 9.9 ) .",
    "secondary polytopes were first introduced in an algebraic context by gelfand , kapranov and zelevinsky @xcite .",
    "for example , if we take @xmath52 to be the @xmath55-dimensional cube as above , then the simplex @xmath71 is @xmath76-dimensional , and the secondary polytope @xmath75 is a @xmath77-dimensional polytope with @xmath78 vertices .",

    "a detailed introduction to triangulations and a range of methods for computing secondary polytopes can be found in the forthcoming book @xcite .",
    "we note that the computation of fiber polytopes can in principle be reduced to the computation of secondary polytopes , by means of the formula @xmath79 here @xmath80 is the composition of the following two linear maps of polytopes : @xmath81 the formula ( [ compose ] ) appears in ( * ? ? ?",

    "these data defines the morphism @xmath180 under mild hypotheses , the closure of the image of @xmath181 is a hypersurface @xmath143 in @xmath162 .",
    "our problem is to compute the newton polytope of this hypersurface .",
    "a first example of how this is done in trim was shown in the beginning of section 2 , and more examples will be featured in this section .",
    "the problem of implicitization is reduced to the elimination computation in the previous section as follows .",
    "we introduce @xmath17 new variables @xmath182 and we consider the following @xmath17 auxiliary laurent polynomials : @xmath183 here we set @xmath184 and @xmath185 so as to match the earlier notation .",

    "this shows that we can solve the implicitization problem by doing the same calculation as in the previous section .",
    "since that calculation is a main application of trim , we have hard - wired it in the command ./trim.prl .",
    "here is an example that illustrates the advantage of using tropical implicitization in analyzing parametric surfaces of high degree in three - space .",
    "consider the parametric surface specified by the input    ....

    "the expected number of monomials in the implicit equation equals    ....",
    "n_lattice_points 62778 ....    at this point the user can make an informed choice as to whether she wishes to attempt solving for the coefficients using numerical linear algebra .",
    "returning to our polyhedral discussion in section 3 , we next give a conceptual formula for the newton polytope of the implicit equation as a mixed fiber polytope .",

    "these are the newton polytopes of the equations @xmath200 in ( [ auxf ] ) .",
    "we now define @xmath53 to be the projection onto the first @xmath201 coordinates @xmath202 the following result is an immediate corollary to theorem [ tropelim ] .",

    "in ( [ morphismg ] ) we assumed that the @xmath209 are laurent polynomials but this hypothesis can be relaxed to other settings discussed in @xcite . in particular , the fundamental theorem of tropical implicitization extends to the case when the @xmath209 are rational functions . here",

    "intuitively , what we are doing in our software is the following .",
    "we wish to determine the coordinates of the extreme vertex @xmath237 of a polytope @xmath52 in a given direction @xmath221 .",

    "a systematic way to carry out the walk is to follow the edges whose inner normal cone intersect the ray @xmath235 .",
    "recall that the multiplicity of a codimension one normal cone is the lattice length of the corresponding edge . using this subroutine for computing extreme vertices ,",
    "the whole polytope is now constructed using the method of huggins @xcite .    to compute the tropical variety @xmath222 for an arbitrary ideal @xmath193",
    "one can use the grbner - based software gfan due to jensen @xcite .",
    "our polyhedral software trim performs the same computation faster when the generators of @xmath193 are laurent polynomials @xmath238 that are generic relative to their newton polytopes @xmath239 .",

    "[ mixedmixed ] the tropical variety @xmath222 is supported on a subfan of the normal fan of the minkowski sum @xmath240 .",

    "the output format is consistent with that of the current version of gfan @xcite and is intended to interface with the polyhedral software polymake @xcite when it supports polyhedral complexes and fans in the future .",

    "this is done by the following theorem which characterizes the multiplicities .",
    "[ superdupertheorem ] the tropical variety @xmath260 equals the image of @xmath222 under the linear map @xmath261 .",
    "if the monomial map @xmath175 induces a generically finite morphism of degree @xmath262 from the variety of @xmath193 onto the variety of @xmath259 then the multiplicity of @xmath260 at a regular point @xmath221 is computed by the formula @xmath263 the sum is over all points @xmath232 in @xmath222 with @xmath264 .",
    "we assume that the number of these points is finite .",
    "they are all regular in @xmath222 , and @xmath265 is the linear span of a neighborhood of @xmath232 in @xmath222 , and similarly for @xmath266 .    the formula ( [ superduperformula ] ) can be regarded as a push - forward formula in intersection theory on toric varieties , and it constitutes the workhorse inside the trim command project.prl .",
    "when the tropical variety @xmath260 has codimension one , then that tropical hypersurface determines the newton polytope of the generator of @xmath259 .",
    "the transformation from tropical hypersurface to mixed fiber polytope was behind all our earlier examples .",
    "that transformation was shown explicitly for an octahedron in example [ octahedron ] .    in all our examples so far , the ideal @xmath193 was tacitly assumed to be a generic complete intersection , and theorem [ mixedmixed ] was used to determine the tropical variety @xmath222 and the multiplicities @xmath267 . in other words , the command trci furnished the ingredients for the formula ( [ superduperformula ] ) .",
    "in particular , then @xmath193 is the ideal of the graph of a morphism , as in section 5 , then theorem [ superdupertheorem ] specializes to the formula for tropical implicitization given in @xcite .",
    "it is important to note , however , that theorem [ superdupertheorem ] applies to any ideal @xmath193 whose tropical variety happens to be known , even if @xmath193 is not a generic complete intersection .",
