    "due to the proliferation of devices such as smart phones , tablets , and personal digital assistants ( pdas ) and the exponential growth of the number of subscribers , the world has witnessed a dramatic increase in wireless traffic recently .",
    "the low - hanging fruit in terms of spectral efficiency gains of traditional point - to - point links has reached the theoretical limits",
    ". only incremental gains of spectral efficiency appears feasible at this point .",
    "thus , is it possible to significantly improve overall spectral efficiency of networks any further ?",
    "note that wireless nodes operate half - duplex in ( hd ) mode by separating the uplink and downlink channels into orthogonal signaling ( time or frequency ) slots .",
    "fd mode ( i.e. , both uplink and downlink on the same channel at the same time ) , if possible , has the potential to double the spectral efficiency instantly .",
    "the tremendous implications of fd wireless nodes will thus be not only to transform for cellular network designs radically and but also to double capacity , speed or number of subscribers of cellular networks  @xcite .    however , a key challenge in implementing a fd transceiver is the presence of loopback interference ( li )  @xcite . since the li is caused by the self - transmitted signal in the transceiver , up until recently fd radio was considered practically infeasible .",
    "this long - held pessimistic view has been challenged in the wake of recent advances in antenna design and introduction of analog / digital signal processing solutions .",
    "to this end , several single and multiple antenna fd implementations have been developed through new li cancellation techniques  @xcite .",
    "antenna separation / radio frequency ( rf ) shielding , analog / digital and hybrid analog - digital circuit domain approaches can achieve significant levels of li cancellation in single antenna fd systems .",
    "multiple antenna li suppression / cancellation techniques are largely based on the use of directional antennas and spatial domain cancellation algorithms .",
    "the implementation of single antenna fd technology with li cancellation was demonstrated in  @xcite .",
    "the authors in  @xcite and  @xcite characterized the spatial suppression of li at fd relaying system . a multiple - input multiple - output ( mimo ) fd implementation ( midu )",
    "was presented in  @xcite , while  @xcite reported design and implementation of an in - band wifi - phy based fd mimo system .",
    "fd systems find useful in several new applications that exploit their ability to transmit and receive simultaneously .",
    "some of these examples include one - way  @xcite and two - way fd relay transmission  @xcite , simultaneous sensing / operation in cognitive radio systems  @xcite and reception / jamming for enhanced physical layer security  @xcite .",
    "another possible advantageous use of fd communications is the simultaneous uplink ( ul)/downlink ( dl ) transmission in wireless systems such as wifi and cellular networks  @xcite .",
    "however , such transmissions introduce li and internode interference in the network as dl transmission will be affected by the li and the ul user will interfere with the dl reception .",
    "therefore , in the presence of li and internode interference , it is not clear whether fd applied to ul / dl user settings can harness performance gains . to this end ,",
    "several works in the literature have presented useful results considering topological randomness which is a main characteristic of wireless networks .",
    "a new modeling approach that captures topological randomness in the network geometry and is capable of producing tractable analytical results is based on stochastic geometry . in",
    "@xcite a fd cellular analytical model based on stochastic geometry was used to derive the sum capacity of the system .",
    "however ,  @xcite assumed perfect li cancellation and therefore , the effect of li is not included in the results .",
    "the application of fd radios for a single small cell scenario was considered in  @xcite . specifically in this work , the conditions where fd operation provides a throughput gain compared to hd and the corresponding throughput results using simulations were presented . in  @xcite ,",
    "the combination of fd and massive mimo was considered for simultaneous ul / dl cellular communication .",
    "the information theoretic study presented in  @xcite , has investigated the rate gain achievable in a fd ul / dl network with internode interference management techniques .    in  @xcite , joint precoder designs to optimize the spectral and energy efficiency of a fd multiuser mimo system were presented .",
    "however  @xcite considered fixed user settings for performance analysis and as such the effect of interference due to distance , particularly relevant for wireless networks with spatial randomness , is ignored .",
    "tools from stochastic geometry has been used to analyze the throughput of fd networks in  @xcite .",
    "specifically ,  @xcite studied the throughput of multi - tier heterogeneous networks with a mixture of access points ( aps ) operating either in fd or hd mode .",
    "the throughput gains of a wireless network of nodes with both fd and hd capabilities has been quantified in  @xcite , while  @xcite analyzed the mean network throughput gains due to fd transmissions in multi - cell wireless networks .    in this paper",
    ", we consider a wireless network scenario in which a fd ap is communicating with the single antenna spatially random user terminals to support simultaneous ul and dl transmissions . specifically we consider a poisson point process ( ppp ) for the dl users and assume that the scheduled ul user is located @xmath0 distance apart .",
    "the ap employs multiple antennas and therefore , precoding can be applied for proper weighting of the transmitted and received signals and spatial li mitigation / cancellation .",
    "we develop a performance analysis and characterize the network performance using ul and dl average sum rate as the metric .",
    "further , we present insightful expressions to show the effect of network parameters such as the user spatial density , the li and internode interference ( through ul / dl user distance parameter ) on the average sum rate .    our contributions are summarized as follows :    * we consider both li and internode interference and derive expressions for the ul and dl average sum rate when several precoding techniques are applied at the ap . specifically , precoding schemes based on the maximum ratio combining ( mrc)/ maximal ratio transmission ( mrt ) , zero - forcing ( zf ) for li cancellation and the optimal precoding scheme for sum rate maximization are investigated . in order to highlight the system behavior and shed insights into the performance , simple expressions for certain special cases are also presented .",
    "further , as an immediate byproduct , the derived cumulative density functions ( cdfs ) of the signal - to - interference noise ratios ( sinrs ) can be used to evaluate the system s ul and dl outage probability .",
    "* our findings reveal that for a fixed li power , when the internode interference is increased , the @xmath1 scheme achieves a better performance than the @xmath2 scheme . on the other hand , by keeping the amount of internode interference constant , while decreasing the li the @xmath2 scheme performs better than the @xmath1 scheme",
    ". moreover , in the presence of li , increasing the receive antenna number at the fd ap with the @xmath2 scheme , is more beneficial in terms of the average sum rate than increasing the number of transmit antennas at the ap .",
    "* we compare the sum rate performance of the system for fd and hd modes of operation at the ap to elucidate the snr regions where fd outperforms hd .",
    "our results reveal that , the choice of the linear processing play a critical role in determining the fd gains .",
    "specifically , optimal design can achieve up to @xmath3 average sum rate gain in comparison with hd scheme in all li regimes .",
    "however , at high li strength as well as high transmit power regime ( i.e. , @xmath4 db ) , fd mode with @xmath2 scheme becomes inferior as compared to the hd mode .",
    "moreover , our results indicate that different power levels at the ap and ul user have a significant adverse effect to decrease the average sum rate in the hd mode of operation than the fd counterpart .",

    "in this section , the ul and dl average sum rates provisioned under different transmit - receive precoding schemes are evaluated and new expressions are derived is zero . ] .",
    "we then consider the more general problem of joint transmit - receive precoder design at the ap for the sum - rate maximization problem .    before proceeding into the derivation of the average sum rates for the specific schemes , it is useful to note that for a nonnegative random variable @xmath84 , since @xmath85 , the average achievable rate can be written as @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the cdf of @xmath88 with @xmath89 , and @xmath90 . therefore , the average achievable rate can be calculated from the cdf of the corresponding sinr .",

    "[ fig : sum_rate_antenna config ] is that , increasing the receive antenna number at the fd ap is more beneficial to the ul and dl average sum rate than increasing the number of transmit antenna elements .",
    "for example , the relative performance gain of @xmath354 $ ] scheme over @xmath355 $ ] is more than that of @xmath356 $ ] scheme over @xmath355 $ ] , especially at high transmit power levels of @xmath357 db .",
    "as noted before , this can be explained by the fact that by doubling the number of transmit / receive antenna number at the ap , the numerator of @xmath96   and @xmath180   is increased in the same proportions .",
    "however , by doubling the @xmath22 , the li at ap is boosted , leading to a decrease in @xmath96 and consequently in the average sum rate .",
    "the performance of a wireless network scenario in which a multiple antenna equipped fd ap communicates with spatially random single - antenna user nodes in the ul and dl channels simultaneously has been analyzed .",
    "in particular , we considered precoding schemes based on the principles of mrc , mrt and zf and studied the system performance in terms of the ul and dl average sum rate .",
    "further , we have considered the problem of optimal precoding design for the ul and dl sum rate maximization and reformulated the problem as a sdp , which can be efficiently solved .",
    "analysis and simulation results demonstrated the superiority of the optimal precoding scheme over the mrc / mrt and mrc / zf schemes .",
    "we further studied the effect of resource allocation , li and internode interference , and antenna configuration on the system sum rate .",
    "we found that the mrc / mrt scheme can offer a higher ul and dl average sum rate compared to the mrc / zf scheme , when the li is significantly canceled or the internode interference is weak enough , and vice versa .",
    "furthermore , we observed that the performance gap between the fd and hd modes can be further increased by deploying more transmit / receive antennas at the ap .",
    "as for future research work , the performance gains due to fd transmission in setups such as heterogeneous network architectures with mixed fd / hd mode operation , cooperative relaying and mimo may be characterized to further establish the viability of the usage of fd terminals .",
