    "in point - source - point - lens ( pspl ) microlensing events , the light curve yields only one physically interesting parameter , the characteristic time scale of the event , @xmath6 , which is a combination of the mass of the lens and the source - lens relative parallax and proper motion . however , more varieties than pspl events have been observed in reality , and using deviations from the standard light curve , one can deduce more information about the lens and the source .",
    "the probing lensing anomalies network ( planet ) is an international collaboration that monitors events in search of such anomalous light curves using a network of telescopes in the southern hemisphere @xcite .",
    "one example of information that can be extracted from anomalous events is the surface brightness profile of the source star @xcite . in a binary or multiple lens system ,",
    "the caustic is an extended structure .",
    "if the source passes near or across the caustic , drastic changes in magnification near the caustics can reveal the finite size of the source @xcite , and one can even extract its surface - brightness profile @xcite .    the fall - off of the surface brightness near the edge of the stellar disk with respect to its center , known as limb darkening , has been extensively observed in the sun .",
    "theories of stellar atmospheres predict limb darkening as a general phenomenon and give models for different types of stars . therefore , measurement of limb darkening in distant stars other than the sun would provide important observational constraints on the study of stellar atmospheres . however , such measurements are very challenging with traditional techniques and have usually been restricted to relatively nearby stars or extremely large supergiants . as a result",
    ", only a few attempts have been made to measure limb darkening to date .",
    "the classical method of tracing the stellar surface brightness profile is the analysis of the light curves of eclipsing binaries @xcite .",
    "however , the current practice in eclipsing - binary studies usually takes the opposite approach to limb darkening @xcite  constructing models of light curves using theoretical predictions of limb darkening .",
    "this came to dominate after @xcite demonstrated that the uncertainty of limb darkening measurements from eclipsing binaries is substantially larger than the theoretical uncertainty . since the limb - darkening parameter is highly correlated with other parameters of the eclipsing binary , fitting for limb darkening could seriously degrade the measurement of these other parameters .",
    "multi - aperture interferometry and lunar occultation , which began as measurements of the angular sizes of stars , have also been used to resolve the surface structures of stars @xcite . in particular , a large wavelength dependence of the interferometric size of a stellar disk",
    "has been attributed to limb darkening , and higher order corrections to account for limb darkening have been widely adopted in the interferometric angular size measurement of stars .",
    "several recent investigations using optical interferometry extending beyond the first null of the visibility function have indeed confirmed that the observed patterns of the visibility function contradict a uniform stellar disk model and favor a limb - darkened disk @xcite although these investigations have used a model prediction of limb darkening inferred from the surface temperature rather than deriving the limb darkening from the observations .",
    "however , at least in one case , @xcite used interferometric imaging to measure the stellar surface brightness profile with coefficients beyond the simple linear model .",
    "in addition , developments of high resolution direct imaging in the last decade using space telescopes @xcite or speckle imaging @xcite have provided a more straightforward way of detecting stellar surface irregularities .",
    "however , most studies of this kind are still limited to a few extremely large supergiants , such as @xmath7 ori .",
    "furthermore , they seem to be more sensitive to asymmetric surface structures such as spotting than to limb darkening .",
    "by contrast , microlensing can produce limb - darkening measurements for distant stars with reasonable accuracy .",
    "to date , limb darkening ( more precisely , a set of coefficients of a parametrized limb - darkened profile ) has been measured for source stars in three events , two k giants in the galactic bulge and an a dwarf in the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) .",
    "macho 97-blg-28 was a cusp - crossing event of a k giant source with extremely good data , permitting @xcite to make a two - coefficient ( linear and square - root ) measurement of limb darkening .",
    "@xcite used data from five microlensing collaborations to measure linear limb darkening coefficients in five filter bandpasses for macho 98-smc-1 , a metal - poor a star in the smc .",
    "although the data for this event were also excellent , the measurement did not yield a two - parameter determination because the caustic crossing was a fold - caustic rather than a cusp , and these are less sensitive to the form of the stellar surface brightness profile .",
    "@xcite measured a linear limb - darkening coefficient for macho 97-blg-41 , a complex rotating - binary event with both a cusp crossing and a fold - caustic crossing . in principle , such an event could give very detailed information about the surface brightness profile .",
    "however , neither the cusp nor the fold - caustic crossing was densely sampled , so only a linear parameter could be extracted .    in this paper",
    ", we report a new limb - darkening measurement of a star in the galactic bulge by a fold - caustic crossing event , ogle-1999-bul-23 , based on the photometric monitoring of planet .",
    "ogle-1999-bul-23 was originally discovered towards the galactic bulge by the optical gravitational lensing experiment ( ogle ) @xcite .",
    "the planet collaboration observed the event as a part of our routine monitoring program after the initial alert , and detected a sudden increase in brightness on 12 june 1999 . following this anomalous behavior",
    ", we began dense ( typically one observation per hour ) photometric sampling of the event . since the source lies close to the ( northern ) winter solstice ( @xmath8 , @xmath9 ) , while the caustic crossing occurred nearly at the summer solstice ( 19 june 1999 ) , and since good weather at all four of our southern sites prevailed throughout , we were able to obtain nearly continuous coverage of the second caustic crossing without any significant gaps .",
    "visual inspection and initial analysis of the light curve revealed that the second crossing was due to a simple fold caustic crossing ( see  2.2 ) .",
    "we observed ogle-1999-bul-23 with i and v band filters at four participant telescopes : the elizabeth 1 m at south african astronomical observatory ( saao ) , sutherland , south africa ; the perth / lowell 0.6 m telescope at perth , western australia ; the canopus 1 m near hobart , tasmania , australia ; and the yale / aura / lisbon / osu 1 m at cerro tololo inter - american observatory ( ctio ) , la serena , chile .",
    "from june to august 1999 ( @xmath10 ) , planet obtained almost 600 images of the field of ogle-1999-bul-23 .",
    "in addition , baseline points were taken at saao ( @xmath11 ) and perth ( @xmath12 ; @xmath13 ) .",
    "here @xmath14 , where hjd is heliocentric julian date at center of exposure .",
    "the data reduction and photometric measurements of the event were performed relative to non - variable stars in the same field using dophot .",
    "after several re - reductions , we recovered the photometric measurements from a total of 476 frames .",
    "we assumed independent photometric systems for different observatories and thus explicitly included the determination of independent ( unlensed ) source and background fluxes for each different telescope and filter band in the analysis .",
    "this provides both determinations of the photometric offsets between different systems and independent estimates of the blending factors .",
    "the final results demonstrate satisfactory alignment among the data sets ( see  2.3 ) , and we therefore believe that we have reasonable relative calibrations .",
    "our previous studies have shown that the background flux ( or blending factors ) may correlate with the size of seeing disks in some cases @xcite . to check this , we introduced linear seeing corrections in addition to constant backgrounds .    from previous experience",
    ", it is expected that the formal errors reported by dophot underestimate the actual errors @xcite , and consequently that @xmath15 is overestimated .",
    "hence , we renormalize photometric errors to force the final reduced @xmath16 for our best fit model . here , @xmath17 is the number of degrees of freedom ( the number of data points less the number of parameters ) .",
    "we determine independent rescaling factors for the photometric uncertainties from the different observatories and filters .",
    "the process involves two steps : the elimination of bad data points and the determination of error normalization factors . in this as in all previous events that we have analyzed , there are outliers discrepant by many @xmath18 that can not be attributed to any specific cause even after we eliminate some points whose source of discrepancy is identifiable .",
    "although , in principle , whether particular data points are faulty or not should be determined without any reference to models , we find that the light curves of various models that yield reasonably good fits to the data are very similar to one another , and furthermore , there is no indication of temporal clumping of highly discrepant points .",
    "we , therefore , identify outlier points with respect to our best model and exclude them from the final analysis .",
    "for the determination of outliers , we follow an iterative approach using both steps of error normalization .",
    "first , we calculate the individual @xmath15 s of data sets from different observatories and filter bands with reference to our best model without any rejection or error scaling .",
    "then , the initial normalization factors are determined independently for each data set using those individual @xmath15 s and the number of data points in each set .",
    "if the deviation of the most discrepant outlier is larger than what is predicted based on the number of points and the assumption of a normal distribution , we classify the point as bad and calculate the new @xmath15 s and the normalization factors again .",
    "we repeat this procedure until the largest outlier is comparable with the prediction of a normal distribution .",
    "although the procedure appears somewhat arbitrary , the actual result indicates that there exist rather large decreases of @xmath18 between the last rejected and included data points .",
    "after rejection of bad points , 429 points remain ( see table  1 and fig .  1 ) .",
    "we use the method of ( * ? ? ? *",
    "hereafter paper  i ) , which was devised to fit the light curve of fold - caustic crossing binary - lens events , to analyze the light curve of this event and find an appropriate binary - lens solution .",
    "this method consists of three steps : ( 1 ) fitting of caustic - crossing data using an analytic approximation of the magnification , ( 2 ) searching for @xmath15 minima over the whole parameter space using the point - source approximation and restricted to the non - caustic crossing data , and ( 3 ) @xmath15 minimization using all data and the full binary - lens equation in the neighborhood of the minima found in the second step .",
    "for the first step , we fit the i - band caustic crossing data ( @xmath19 ) to the six - parameter analytic curve shown in equation ( 1 ) that characterizes the shape of the second caustic crossing ( paper  i ; afonso et al .",
    "2000 ) ,    @xmath20+f_{{{\\rm cc } } } + ( t - t_{{{\\rm cc}}})\\,\\tilde{\\omega}\\,,\\ ] ]    @xmath21    @xmath22    figure  2 shows the best - fit curve and the data points used for the fit .",
    "this caustic - crossing fit essentially constrains the search for a full solution to a four - dimensional hypersurface instead of the whole nine - dimensional parameter space ( paper  i ) .",
    "we construct a grid of point - source light curves with model parameters spanning a large subset of the hypersurface and calculate @xmath15 for each model using the i - band non - caustic crossing data .",
    "after an extensive search for @xmath15-minima over the four - dimensional hypersurface , we find positions of two apparent local minima , each in a local valley of the @xmath15-surface .",
    "the smaller @xmath15 of the two is found at @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the projected binary separation in units of the einstein ring radius , @xmath25 is the mass ratio of the binary system , and @xmath7 is the angle between the binary axis and the path of the source , defined so that the geometric center of the lens system lies on the right hand side of the moving source .",
    "the other local minimum is @xmath26 .",
    "the results appear to suggest a rough symmetry of @xmath27 and @xmath28 , as was found for macho 98-smc-1 ( paper i ; afonso et al .",
    "besides these two local minima , there are several isolated @xmath29-grid points at which @xmath15 is smaller than at neighboring grid points . however , on a finer grid they appear to be connected with one of the two local minima specified above .",
    "we include the two local minima and some of the apparently isolated minimum points as well as points in the local valley around the minima as starting points for the refined search of @xmath15-minimization in the next step .",
    "starting from the local minima found in  2.2 and the points in the local valleys around them , we perform a refined search for the @xmath15 minimum .",
    "the @xmath15 minimization includes all the i and v data points for successive fitting to the full expression for magnification , accounting for effects of a finite source size and limb darkening .",
    "as described in paper  i , the third step makes use of a variant of equation ( 1 ) to evaluate the magnified flux in the neighborhood of the caustic crossing .",
    "paper  i found that , for macho 98-smc-1 , this analytic expression was an extremely good approximation to the results of numerical integration and assumed that the same would be the case for any fold crossing .",
    "unfortunately , we find that , for ogle-1999-bul-23 , this approximation deviates from the true magnification as determined using the method of @xcite as much as 4% , which is larger than our typical photometric uncertainty in the region of caustic crossing .",
    "to maintain the computational efficiency of paper  i , we continue to use the analytic formula  ( 1 ) , but correct it by pre - tabulated amounts given by the fractional difference ( evaluated close to the best solution ) between this approximation and the values found by numerical integration .",
    "we find that this correction works quite well even at the local minimum for the other ( close - binary ) solution  the error is smaller than 1% , and in particular , the calculations agree within 0.2% for the region of primary interest .",
    "the typical ( median ) photometric uncertainties for the same region are 0.015 mag ( canopus after the error normalization ) and 0.020 mag ( perth ) . in addition , we test the correction by running the fitting program with the exact calculation at the minimum found using the corrected approximation , and find that the measured parameters change less than the precision of the measurement . in particular , the limb - darkening coefficients change by an order of magnitude less than the measurement uncertainty due to the photometric errors .",
    "the results of the refined @xmath15 minimization are listed in table  2 for three discrete `` solutions '' and in table  3 for grid points neighboring the best - fit solution whose @xmath30 is less than one .",
    "the first seven columns describe seven of the standard parameters of the binary - lens model ( the remaining two parameters are the source and background flux ) .",
    "the eighth column is the time of the second caustic crossing ( @xmath31 )  the time when the center of the source crossed the caustic .",
    "the limb darkening coefficients for i and v bands are shown in the next two columns . the final column is @xmath30 , @xmath32 as in paper  i. the light curve ( in magnification ) of the best - fit model is shown in figure  3 together with all the data points used in the analysis .      for typical binary - lens microlensing events ,",
    "more than one solution often fits the observations reasonably well .",
    "in particular , @xcite predicted a degeneracy between close and wide binary lenses resulting from a symmetry in the lens equation itself , and such a degeneracy was found empirically for macho 98-smc-1 ( paper  i ; afonso et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "we also find two distinct local @xmath15 minima (  2.2 ) that appear to be closely related to such degeneracies .",
    "however , in contrast to the case of macho 98-smc-1 , our close - binary model for ogle-1999-bul-23 has substantially higher @xmath15 than the wide - binary model ( @xmath33 ) .",
    "figure  4 shows the predicted light curves in saao instrumental i band .",
    "the overall geometries of these two models are shown in figures  5 and 6 .",
    "the similar morphologies of the caustics with respect to the path of the source is responsible for the degenerate light curves near the caustic crossing ( fig .",
    "however , the close - binary model requires a higher blending fraction and lower baseline flux than the wide - binary solution because the former displays a higher peak magnification ( @xmath34 vs.  @xmath35 ) .",
    "consequently , a precise determination of the baseline can significantly contribute to discrimination between the two models , and in fact , the actual data did constrain the baseline well enough to produce a large difference in @xmath15 .    a fair number of pre - event baseline measurements are available via ogle , and those data can further help discriminate between these two `` degenerate '' models .",
    "we fit ogle measurements to the two models with all the model parameters being fixed and allowing only the baseline and the blending fraction as free parameters .",
    "we find that the planet wide - binary model produces @xmath36 for 169 ogle points ( @xmath37 , compare table  1 ) while @xmath38 for the close - binary model for the same 169 points ( fig .",
    "that is , @xmath39 , so that the addition of ogle data by itself discriminates between the two models approximately as well as all the planet data combined .",
    "the largest contribution to this large @xmath30 appears to come from the period about a month before the first caustic crossing which is well covered by the ogle data but not by the planet data . in particular , the close - binary model predicts a bump in the light curve around @xmath40 due to a triangular caustic ( see fig .",
    "5 ) , but the data do not show any abnormal feature in the same region , although it is possible that rotation of the binary moved the caustic far from the source trajectory ( eg .",
    "afonso et al .",
    "2000 ) . in brief",
    ", the ogle data strongly favor the wide - binary model .",
    "the limb darkening of the source is parametrized using a normalized linear model of the source surface brightness profile , which was introduced in appendix b of paper i , @xmath41 = \\bar{s}_{\\lambda } \\left[(1-\\gamma_{\\lambda})+{3\\over2}\\,\\gamma_{\\lambda}\\cos\\vartheta\\right ] \\ , \\nonumber\\\\ { \\rm where}\\ \\sin\\vartheta\\equiv\\frac{\\theta}{\\theta_{\\ast } } \\ { \\rm and}\\ \\bar{s}_{\\lambda } \\equiv\\frac{f_{s,\\lambda}}{\\pi \\theta_{\\ast}^{2}}\\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] while linear limb darkening is usually parametrized by , @xmath42\\\\ = s_{\\lambda}(0)\\left[(1-c_{\\lambda})+c_{\\lambda}\\,\\cos\\vartheta\\,\\right]\\ .\\ ] ] the relationship between the two expressions of linear limb - darkening coefficients is @xmath43    amongst our six data sets , data from saao did not contain points that were affected by limb darkening , i.e.  caustic crossing points . since the filters used at different planet observatories do not differ significantly from one another , we use the same limb - darkening coefficient for the three remaining i - band data sets .",
    "the v - band coefficient is determined only from canopus data , so that a single coefficient is used automatically .    for the best - fit lens geometry ,",
    "the measured values of linear limb - darkening coefficients are @xmath44 and @xmath45 , where the errors include only uncertainties in the linear fit due to the photometric uncertainties at _ fixed _ binary - lens model parameters . however , these errors underestimate the actual uncertainties of the measurements because the measurements are correlated with the determination of the seven lens parameters shown in tables  2 and  3 . incorporating these additional uncertainties in the measurement ( see the next section for a detailed discussion of the error determination ) ,",
    "our final estimates are    @xmath46    @xmath47    this is consistent with the result of the caustic - crossing fit of  2.2 ( @xmath48 ) .",
    "our result suggests that the source is more limb - darkened in @xmath49 than in @xmath50 , which is generally expected by theories .",
    "figure  8 shows the i - band residuals ( in magnitudes ) at the second caustic crossing from our best - fit models for a linearly limb - darkened and a uniform disk model .",
    "it is clear that the uniform disk model exhibits larger systematic residuals near the peak than the linearly limb - darkened disk . from the residual patterns",
    " the uniform disk model produces a shallower slope for the most of the falling side of the second caustic crossing than the data require , one can infer that the source should be more centrally concentrated than the model predicts , and consequently the presence of limb darkening .",
    "the linearly limb - darkened disk reduces the systematic residuals by a factor of @xmath51 5 .",
    "formally , the difference of @xmath15 between the two models is 172.8 with two additional parameters for the limb - darkened disk model , i.e.  the data favor a limb - darkened disk over a uniform disk at very high confidence .",
    "due to the multi - parameter character of the fit , a measurement of any parameter is correlated with other parameters of the model .",
    "the limb - darkening coefficients obtained with the different model parameters shown in table  3 exhibit a considerable scatter , and in particular , for the i - band measurement , the scatter is larger than the uncertainties due to the photometric errors .",
    "this indicates that , in the measurement of the limb - darkening coefficients , we need to examine errors that correlate with the lens model parameters in addition to the uncertainties resulting from the photometric uncertainties at fixed lens parameters .",
    "this conclusion is reinforced by the fact that the error in the estimate of @xmath52 from the caustic - crossing fit ( see fig .",
    "2 ) , which includes the correlation with the parameters of the caustic - crossing , is substantially larger than the error in the linear fit , which does not .    since limb darkening manifests itself mainly around the caustic crossing , its measurement is most strongly correlated with @xmath53 and @xmath31 . to estimate the effects of these correlations",
    ", we fit the data to models with @xmath53 or @xmath31 fixed at several values near the best fit  the global geometry of the best fit ,",
    "i.e.  @xmath24 and @xmath25 being held fixed as well .",
    "the resulting distributions of @xmath30 have parabolic shapes as a function of the fit values of the limb - darkening coefficient and are centered at the measurement of the best fit .",
    "( both , @xmath53 fixed and @xmath31 fixed , produce essentially the same parabola , and therefore , we believe that the uncertainty related to each correlation with either @xmath53 or @xmath31 is , in fact , same in its nature . ) we interpret the half width of the parabola at @xmath54 ( @xmath55 ) as the uncertainty due to the correlation with the caustic - crossing parameters at a given global lens geometry of a fixed @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "although the global lens geometry should not _ directly _ affect the limb darkening measurement , the overall correlation between local and global parameters can contribute an additional uncertainty to the measurement .",
    "this turns out to be the dominant source of the scatter found in table  3 . to incorporate this into our final determination of errors , we examine the varying range of the measured coefficients over @xmath56 .",
    "the result is apparently asymmetric between the direction of increasing and decreasing the amounts of limb darkening .",
    "we believe that this is real , and thus we report asymmetric error bars for the limb - darkening measurements .",
    "the final errors of the measurements reported in  2.3.2 are determined by adding these two sources of error to the photometric uncertainty in quadrature .",
    "the dominant source of errors in the i - band coefficient measurement is the correlation between the global geometry and the local parameters whereas the photometric uncertainty is the largest contribution to the uncertainties in the v - band coefficient measurement .",
    "although the measurements of v and i band limb darkening at fixed model parameters are independent , the final estimates of two coefficients are not actually independent for the same reason discussed above .",
    "( the correlation between v and i limb - darkening coefficients is clearly demonstrated in table  3 . )",
    "hence , the complete description of the uncertainty requires a covariance matrix .",

    "we derive the correlation coefficient using each measurement of @xmath62 and @xmath63 , and the result indicates that two measurements are almost perfectly correlated @xmath64 . we accommodate asymmetry of the errors by making the error ellipse off - centered with respect to the best estimate .",

    "the quality of the linear parameterization has been investigated for most theoretical limb - darkening calculations , and the results seem to support this explanation . @xcite defined the quality factors ( q in his paper ) for his calculations of limb - darkening coefficients , and for 4000 k @xmath102 5000 k and 3.0 @xmath103 4.0 , his results indicate that the linear parameterization is a better approximation for v band than for i band . similarly , @xcite provided plots of summed residuals ( @xmath18 in his paper ) for his fits used to derive limb - darkening coefficients showing that the v - band linear limb - darkening has lower @xmath18 than i - band and is as good as the v - band square - root limb - darkening near the temperature range of our estimate for the source of ogle-1999-bul-23 . in fact",
    ", @xcite reported that the v - band limb darkening is closest to the linear law in the temperature range @xmath104 k. in summary , the source happens to be very close to the temperature at which the linear limb darkening is a very good approximation in @xmath49 , but is less good in @xmath50 .",
    "the actual value of the coefficient in the linear parameterization of a non - linear profile may vary depending on the method of calculation and sampling . in order to determine the linear coefficients , models (",
    "a ) and ( c ) used a least square fit to the theoretical ( non - parametric ) profile by sampling uniformly over @xmath105 ( see eq .",
    "[ 3 ] ) , while model ( b ) utilized the principle of total flux conservation between parametric and non - parametric profiles . on the other hand",
    ", a fold - caustic crossing event samples the stellar surface brightness by convolving it with a rather complicated magnification pattern @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is very likely that neither of the above samplings and calculations is entirely suitable for the representation of the limb - darkening measurement by microlensing unless the real intensity profile of the star is actually same as the assumed parametric form ( the linear parameterization , in this case ) .",
    "in fact , the most apropriate way to compare the measurement to the stellar atmospheric models would be a direct fit to the ( non - parametric ) theoretical profile after convolution with the magnification patterns near the caustics . in the present paper , this has not been done , but we hope to make such a direct comparison in the future .",
    "we thank a. udalski for re - reducing the ogle data on very short notice after we noticed an apparent discrepancy between the planet data and the original ogle reductions .",
