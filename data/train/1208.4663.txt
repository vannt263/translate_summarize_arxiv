    "active galactic nuclei ( agns ) are broadly classified into two types : type 1 agns , which display broad permitted emission lines in the optical spectrum ; and type 2 agns , which display both permitted and forbidden lines with narrow line widths .",
    "the detection of broad emission lines in polarized light from type 2 agns ( antonucci & miller 1985 ) present a clue to tie these two types together .",
    "the agn activity is powered by a supermassive black hole ( @xmath14@xmath15 @xmath16 ) and its accretion disk , which extends to @xmath171 pc .",
    "this central engine is surrounded by an optically and geometrically thick dusty torus , extending to @xmath6 1100 pc . in the `` unified model '' of agns ( e.g. , antonucci 1993 )",
    ", it is postulated that much of the variety in types of agns is not due to intrinsic differences between them , but is largely the result of their strongly non - spherical geometries and the different orientations of their central regions with respect to our lines of sight .",
    "specifically , in a type 1 agn the torus is observed face - on and the interior may be observed directly , while in a type 2 agn the torus is observed edge - on , which prevents a direct view of the nucleus .",
    "the obscuring torus around the central engine is the key element for the agn unified model , and the strongest verification of it would come from the detection of the molecular torus itself .",
    "recent observations at many wavelengths , for example the detection of silicate emission from type 1 agns ( e.g. , hao et al . ,",
    "2007 ) , surely show the presence of obscuring tori surrounding the nuclei . however , the physical conditions and structure of the torus have never been measured directly , and we have only a crude idea of them .",
    "the direct measurements of the physical conditions ( temperature and column density ) of the molecular torus and the determination of the gas kinematics within the torus are long awaited goals of extragalactic astronomy .",
    "carbon monoxide ( co ) is the most abundant interstellar molecule after hydrogen molecule ( @xmath9 ) . for the study of molecular clouds , pure rotational emission lines of co",
    "have been extensively observed in the millimeter and sub - millimeter wavelength regions .",
    "however , to date such observations have not been suitable for the detailed characterization of distant molecular clouds around the agns , because they have provided information on neither the detailed spatial structure ( due to the relatively large beam sizes of current millimeter telescopes ) nor the physical conditions ( due to the limited number of observable lines ) of the clouds .",
    "in addition , millimeter observations can be contaminated by large - scale co emission in the host galaxies on scales of 10100 kpc , which can make it difficult to clearly distinguish the molecular gas in close proximity to the agn , i.e. the putative molecular torus .",
    "the technique we employ in the current work is high - resolution spectroscopy of absorption lines of the co fundamental ( @xmath18=1@xmath190 ) ro - vibration band , whose center lies near 4.7 @xmath20 .",
    "continuum emission associated with the bright , compact central region of an agn is used as a background source and the foreground molecular clouds are to be observed in absorption .",
    "this technique achieves very high spatial resolution , since the resolution is determined by the size of the background continuum source .",
    "in addition , a large number of co lines covering a wide range of rotational levels can be observed simultaneously with the same instrument under the same conditions .",
    "this enables accurate determination of the physical conditions , such as temperatures and column densities of the absorbing molecular clouds .    in spite of these advantages , most previous ground - based observations of the 4.7 @xmath20 co absorption spectrum",
    "have been limited to galactic sources ( e.g. , scoville et al .",
    "1983 ; mitchell & maillard 1993 ; nakagawa et al . 1997 ; goto et al . 2003 ) , with only a few examples toward extragalactic objects ( spoon et al . 2003 ; geballe et al .",
    "this is mainly due to difficulties in achieving high sensitivities at the wavelength around 4.7 @xmath20 .",
    "8-m class telescopes with high sensitivity , now are making it possible to observe the co ro - vibrational absorption lines in molecular clouds around some agns .",
    "one class of agns whose central nuclei are obscured by gas and dust in our line of sight , the so - called seyfert 2 galaxies , would appear to be the most suitable for such observations .",
    "however , spectra of objects in this class have to date shown no significant absorption by the co fundamental ro - vibration band ( lutz et al .",
    "2004 ) , in some cases down to very low limits ( mason et al . 2006",
    "; geballe et al .",
    "2009 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the _ spitzer space telescope _ has detected a strong absorption by gaseous co toward the dusty ultra - luminous infrared galaxy ( ulirg ) , iras  f00183@xmath57111 ( spoon et al .",
    "observations at the vlt by risaliti et al .",
    "( 2006 ) and sani et al .",
    "( 2008 ) also have detected co fundamental band absorption toward some ulirgs whose central sources are heavily obscured .",
    "these results suggest that co absorption does not appear in typical seyfert 2 galaxies but can be found in at least some heavily obscured agns .",
    "the reasons for this are unclear , although in the case of the prototypical seyfert 2 galaxy , ngc  1068 , geballe et al .",
    "( 2009 ) have concluded that most of the gas in front of its agn is diffuse in nature and therefore contains little co. both classes of objects , seyfert 2 galaxies and ulirgs , appear to have considerable obscuring material near their agns .",
    "however , hard x - ray observations ( franceschini et al .",
    "2003 ; ptak et al .",
    "2003 ) suggested that agns in ulirgs are not necessarily the dominant source of nuclear luminosity and that nuclear star formation is a significant contributor .",
    "ongoing star formation in the nuclei of ulirgs implies the presence of large amounts of molecular gas there .",
    "ulirgs ( sanders & mirabel 1996 ) are galaxies whose extremely large , quasar - like luminosities ( @xmath21 ) emerge at least 90 percent in the form of infrared dust emission .",
    "they are associated with interacting or merging gas - rich galaxies ( armus et al .",
    "1987 ; sanders et al . 1988 ; leech et al . 1994 ; clements et al .",
    "1996 ; murphy et al .",
    "1996 ) , in which the collision produces either an extreme burst of star formation ( usually near the nucleus of one of the merging galaxies ) , a greatly increased rate of infall into the vicinity of an agn , or both . in many cases it is difficult to distinguish between the two phenomena , because the large amount of dust prevents direct observation of the energy source . however , ulirgs with bright pointlike nuclei at mid - infrared wavelengths , whose spectra show strong dust absorption , are generally thought to possess luminous buried agns ( imanishi , dudley & maloney 2006 ) . in the case of a ulirg - producing merger involving a galaxy that contains an agn ,",
    "the survival of the molecular torus in the agn is unclear .",
    "the torus could be disrupted by gas falling into the nucleus or by ejection of gas caused by the rapid increase in luminosity of the agn precipitated by such infall , or simply by intense heating by the agn alone .",
    "infrared spectroscopy of ulirgs is a possible way to investigate the energetic events in the central region of obscured agns . for such purpose ,",
    "the observations of the co fundamental band absorption toward ulirgs with space telescopes , spitzer and akari , are effective in providing some information ( spoon et al .",
    "2005 , imanishi et al . 2008 , imanishi et al .",
    "2010 ) . however , the spectral resolutions of those facilities are relatively low ( @xmath22 @xmath6 600 for the spitzer / irs , @xmath22 @xmath6 100 for the akari / irc ) and are insufficient to resolve molecular ro - vibrational bands into individual transitions , let alone resolve velocity structure .",
    "thus , in order to reveal the physical conditions of the circumnuclear region and the origin of the co absorption , we have obtained high - resolution spectra toward heavily obscured agns , using ground - based telescopes .    in this paper",
    "we report on the high resolution 4.905.13 @xmath20 spectrum toward the obscured agn iras  08572@xmath03915 nw , using the 8.2-m subaru telescope .",
    "the detection of co absorption lines in the fundamental band toward this galaxy was reported by geballe et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , using the united kingdom 3.8-m infrared telescope ( ukirt ) .",
    "although the signal - to - noise ratio of their spectrum is modest , they detected broad and complex absorption line profiles .",
    "their spectrum shows that the line profile are dominated by a very broad absorption feature , which extends from 0 to @xmath5400 km  s@xmath4 and peaking near @xmath5160 km  s@xmath4 relative to the systemic velocity .",
    "they also detected a second velocity component close to the systemic velocity , and marginally detected a third component that is redshifted .",
    "our new and improved spectrum covers a greater portion of the band and has a considerably higher signal - to - noise ratio . using it we can clearly separate the co absorption into the three components deduced from the earlier spectrum .",
    "the new spectrum can be used to better constrain the physical conditions in the absorbing molecular clouds .",
    "the characteristics of iras  08572@xmath03915 are reviewed in the next section .",

    "the spacings of lines of other isotopomers and other vibrational states of @xmath42 do not match those of the observed lines .",

    "the relative intensities , velocity extents , and degrees of overlap of these components with one another vary with rotational level .",
    "the component at the systemic velocity was detected in only the low-@xmath37 transitions ( @xmath43 ) , implying that the absorbing gas producing it has a relatively low temperature .",
    "the blueshifted component , the strongest of the three overall , was detected in all of the transitions including those at high-@xmath37 , which indicates a significant contribution from high - temperature gas .",
    "its line profiles are asymmetric and could consist of two or more velocity components .",
    "the redshifted component , which is weaker than the others , was detected only in high-@xmath37 transitions ( @xmath44 ) , indicating that the temperature of the gas producing this component is higher than that producing the blueshifted component .",
    "iras  08572@xmath03915 is the first extragalactic object in which the fundamental band of co has been resolved into individual lines , and where the lines themselves are velocity - resolved .",
    "in this and the following subsection we analyze the spectrum in order to derive column densities and temperatures of the warm and cold components . in this subsection",
    "we make the simple assumption that the area covering factor ( @xmath38 ) of the absorbing molecular gas is unity ; in other words that for all transitions and at all velocities at which the co absorbs , the absorbing gas completely covers the continuum source .    in order to measure the intensities of the absorption lines , it is critical to know the continuum level accurately . because the present spectrum is full of broad absorption lines , that level is difficult to be determined .",
    "we initially regard the local maxima of the continuum between each line as defining the continuum level . in that case",
    "the continuum flux density decreases gradually with increasing wavelength at wavelengths longer than 5.00 @xmath20 .",
    "we fit this portion of the continuum with a linear function .",
    "the apparent continuum on the short - wavelength side of the spectrum shows significant structure and is inconsistent with a linear dependence on wavelength .",
    "we attribute this to two emission lines : hi pf@xmath45 and @xmath46 @xmath18=0@xmath470 @xmath48(9 ) centered at 4.65378 @xmath20 and 4.69462 @xmath20 in the rest frame , respectively .",
    "goldader et al ( 1995 ) and higdon et al ( 2006 ) have reported the detection of hi and @xmath46 emission lines at near and mid - infrared wavelengths from this galaxy .",
    "the lower and upper level energies associated with the @xmath46 @xmath48(9 ) line are approximately 4,600  k and 7,200  k , respectively and hence it is not surprising that the line is observed in emission .",
    "we assume that each of hi pf@xmath45 and @xmath46 @xmath48(9 ) lines have gaussian profiles with the same velocity widths as hi br@xmath49 ( 241 km  s@xmath4 ) and @xmath46 @xmath18=1@xmath470 @xmath48(1 ) ( 430 km  s@xmath4 ) observed by goldader et al .",
    "the resulting best fit continuum spectrum synthesized from a straight line plus two gaussian profiles is also plotted in figure  [ fig : spectrum ] .",
    "our analysis of the few co lines coincident in wavelength with these emission lines assumes that the emission lines are behind the absorbing co. this appears to us to be the most likely situation for the pf@xmath45 line , which arises in ionized gas .",
    "the @xmath46 @xmath48(9 ) line occurs in molecular gas much hotter than the warm red- and blue - shifted gas producing co absorption .",
    "it is possible , however , that it is physically associated with some of that gas and is in the foreground .",
    "however , the line is weak relative to the continuum and the continuum placement has only a small effect on the column densities of the one or two coincident co lines and no effect on the principal results of this paper .",
    "the equivalent widths of the co absorption lines , measured against the continuum level discussed above , were used to calculate the co column density in the lower state of each transition . since we found it impossible to definitively assign specific velocity intervals to the three velocity components discussed earlier , only total line equivalent widths @xmath50 across the entire profile were determined by numerical integration of the optical depth @xmath51 , using @xmath52 where @xmath37 is the rotational quantum number of the lower state , @xmath53 is the continuum level , @xmath54 is the intensity of the spectrum , and @xmath55 and @xmath56 is are wavelength and frequency of the line profile ( but in the right portion of the equation @xmath55 is the wavelength of the line center ) . when stimulated emission is negligible compared to absorption , the column density in the lower state of a transition @xmath57 is related to the equivalent width by @xmath58 in the optically thin case , where @xmath59 cm , and @xmath60 is the oscillator strength of the transition .",

    "<S> the velocity profiles reveal three distinct components , the strongest and broadest ( @xmath2 @xmath3 200 km  s@xmath4 ) of which is due to blueshifted ( @xmath5160 km  s@xmath4 ) gas at a temperature of @xmath6 270 k absorbing at velocities as high as @xmath5400 km  s@xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> a much weaker but even warmer ( @xmath6 700 k ) component , which is highly redshifted ( @xmath0100 km  s@xmath4 ) , is also detected , in addition to a cold ( @xmath6 20 k ) component centered at the systemic velocity of the galaxy . on the assumption of local thermodynamic equilibrium , the column density of co in the 270 k component is @xmath7 @xmath8 , which in fully molecular gas corresponds to a @xmath9 column density of @xmath10 @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> the thermal excitation of co up to the observed high rotational levels requires a density greater than @xmath11 @xmath12 , implying that the thickness of the warm absorbing layer is extremely small ( @xmath13 pc ) even if it is highly clumped . </S>",
    "<S> the large column densities and high radial velocities associated with these warm components , as well as their temperatures , indicate that they originate in molecular clouds near the central engine of the agn . </S>"
