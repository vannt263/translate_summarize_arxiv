    "gigahertz peaked spectrum radio sources are a class of powerful ( @xmath0  erg  s@xmath1 ) radio sources , defined by a simple convex spectrum peaking near 1 ghz .",
    "they represent @xmath210% of the 5  ghz selected sources , _",
    "i.e. _ a significant fraction of the powerful radio sources in the universe .",
    "they are characterized by compact radio cores , most likely not extending beyond the narrow - line regions ( nlrs ; @xmath31 kpc ) .",
    "some of them exhibit very faint extended radio emission on scales larger than the host galaxy ( baum et al .",
    "1990 ; stanghellini et al . 1990 ; fanti et al .",
    "2001 ) , but rarely on mpc scales ( schoenmakers et al .",
    "their radio morphologies and host galaxies are generally consistent with classical 3cr doubles .",
    "emission - lines optical spectra suggest interaction between the radio source and emission - line gas , as well as dust obscuration .",
    "mid - ir measurements suggest the existence of a powerful hidden active nucleus ( heckman et al .",

    "1998 and fanti et al .",
    "2000 for a different point of view ) .",
    "two scenarios are currently proposed to explain the nature of gps sources :    1 .",
    "the _ young scenario _ : gps could be young versions of large scale radio galaxies at an earlier stage of their formation ( carvalho 1985 : mutel & philips 1988 ; fanti et al . 1995 ; readhead et al .",
    "1996 : odea & baum 1997 ) . in this scenario ,",
    "objects which are @xmath4100 pc in size are about 10@xmath5  years old , which is consistent with proper motion measurements on about 10 of them ( fanti 2000 ) 2 .",
    "the _ frustrated scenario _ : gps may represent `` aborted '' classical doubles , which will never reach their full maturity because they are embedded in a dense and turbulent medium , able to confine and trap the radio - emitting region on the scale - length of the nlrs ( van brueghel et al . 1984 ; odea et al .",
    "1991 )    x - ray observations can provide an important contribution to elucidate the nature of this class of objects . in facts",
    ":    * measurements of hot gas , through its optically thin emission peaking in the soft x - rays , may provide indication for the presence of hot confining medium ( odea et al .",
    "constraints on the presence of such a gas phase from other wavelengths are not conclusive ( kameno et al .",
    "2000 ; marr et al . 2001 ) * measurements of heavy x - ray absorption ( in the most extreme case compton - thick , @xmath6  @xmath7 ) may indicate the presence of cold confining matter , to be compared with hydrodynamical models ( de young 1993 ; carvalho 1994 , 1998 ) to identify possible mechanisms responsible for the confinement of the jet * the detection of large - scale x - ray jets may challenge one or more of our current assumptions on the nature of gps sources ( siemiginowska et al .",
    "2002 )    the properties of the cold and hot phases , that one can derive from the x - ray spectral fitting may therefore provide a test for the `` frustration '' scenario .",
    "unfortunately , gps sources are x - ray weak : only 3 out of 9 gps sources observed in the soft x - rays have been detected .",
    "hints that this low rate may be due to absorption were put forward by elvis et al .",
    "( 1994 ) and zhang & marscher ( 1994 ) .",
    "odea et al .",
    "( 1996 ) report the detection of a luminous ( @xmath8  erg  s@xmath1 ) and highly absorbed ( @xmath9  @xmath7 ) hard x - ray source in 1314 + 125 ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "siemiginowska et al .",

    "chandra _ a prominent x - ray jet on scales @xmath11 in pks  1127 - 145 ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "we present in this paper results of the january 1999 asca observation of the gps radio galaxy oq+208 ( 1404 + 286 ; @xmath13 ) .",
    "the    inverted x - ray spectrum ( see fig .  [ fig1 ] ; energy index @xmath14 ) and the remarkably strong ( equivalent width , ew , @xmath15  ev ) k@xmath16 fluorescent neutral iron line ( @xmath17  kev ) are best explained if the x - ray emission is dominated by the compton - reflection of an otherwise invisible continuum .",
    "the column density covering the agn is likely to be as large as @xmath18  @xmath7 .",
    "if this explanation is correct , 1404 + 286 would be _ the first radio - loud compton - thick agn ever observed_. the alternative possibility of a compton - thin absorber ( still with @xmath19  @xmath7 ) is equally viable from the statistical point of view , although in this scenario there is no clear explanation for the extreme intensity of the iron line ( leighly & creighton 1993 ) . in both cases ,",
    "a soft excess below 3kev is present , which can be explained as thermal emission from an optically thin hot gas , whose temperature is , however , loosely constrained ( @xmath20  k ; cf .",
    "the right panel of fig.[fig1 ] ) .",
    "again , the quality of the asca data is not good enough to rule out alternative explanations for the soft x - ray emission , as electron scattering of the primary nuclear emission .",
    "the observed fluxes are 0.7 and @xmath21  erg  @xmath7  s@xmath1 in the 0.52  kev and 210  kev bands , respectively .",
    "they correspond to rest - frame unabsorbed luminosities of @xmath22 and @xmath23  erg  s@xmath1 in the same energy bands .",
    "however , if the bulk of the hard x - ray emission is indeed due to compton - reflection , the true intrinsic 210  kev luminosity of 1404 + 286 is likely to be at least one order of magnitude higher ( guainazzi et al .",
    "1999 ; awaki et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "although the measurement of the iron line is robust , and points unambiguously to a reflection - dominated spectrum , the overall spectral deconvolution is still ambiguous .",
    "time has been allocated for the xmm - newton 2@xmath24 observational cycle ( january - september 2003 ) to reobserve this target .",
    "the unprecedented collecting power of xmm - newton in the hard x - rays ( jansen et al . 2001 ) will allow us to unambiguously characterize all the spectral components in this intriguing source .",
    "only with xeus one can get spectroscopic information on gps sources at cosmological redshifts , where most of them are located ( cf . fig .  [ fig3 ] ) .",
    "simulations have been done , placing at redshift of @xmath25 ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ; _ upper _ and _ central _ panels ) and @xmath26 ( _ lower _ panels ) the two gps sources for which hard x - ray measurements are available ( see above ) .",
    "an exposure time of 50  ks has been assumed throughout , and the cis superconducting tunnelling junctions detectors response matrices employed . in each spectral plot , the lower curve corresponds to the initial configuration , the upper curve corresponds to the final configuration one .",
