    "evidence for supersolar abundance ratios of @xmath0-elements to iron ( @xmath3 ) in the intracluster medium ( icm ) of the virgo , perseus , and abell 576 galaxy clusters has been available in the literature since the mid-1980s ( canizares 1982 , canizares , markert & donahue 1988 , and rothenflug 1984 ) , although these measurements were heavily weighted towards thermally - complex cooling flow regions .",
    "much debate in the subsequent years has centred on the robustness of these results , in light of the difficulty in obtaining accurate abundances for the @xmath0-elements .",
    "taking advantage of the unique characteristics of the _ advanced satellite for cosmology and astrophysics ( asca ) , mushotzky ( 1996 ) determined the icm abundance ratios for four clusters and found , using the solar photospheric abundance scale , the following unweighted mean ( sis ) values : [ o / fe]@xmath4 + 0.18 , [ si / fe]@xmath4 + 0.31 , [ ne / fe]@xmath4 + 0.29 , [ s / fe]@xmath4 - 0.11 , and [ mg / fe]@xmath4 + 0.07 .",
    "scaling to the meteoritic abundances , ishimaru & arimoto ( 1997 ) revised these values to : [ o / fe]@xmath4 + 0.01 , [ si / fe]@xmath4 + 0.14 , [ ne / fe]@xmath4 + 0.12 , [ s / fe]@xmath4 - 0.32 , and [ mg / fe]@xmath4 - 0.10 .",
    "similar results are becoming available for @xmath5 additional clusters .",
    "both `` scalings '' were based upon table 1 of anders & grevesse ( 1989 ) .",
    "_    the abundance ratio pattern in the icm provides a unique tool with which to probe the origin of these heavy elements . while the favoured mechanism for enriching the icm is supernovae ( sne)-driven winds from elliptical galaxies ( gibson 1997 , and references therein ) , there is still no consensus as to whether these winds are dominated by the ejecta of type ii sne ( either via initial mass functions heavily - weighted towards their progenitors or via an early wind relatively unpolluted by the longer - lived progenitors to type ia sne ) or type ia sne . since _",
    "a priori galactic wind models can be constructed to satisfy either scenario ( matteucci & vettolani 1988 ; gibson & matteucci 1997 ) , it was recognised that accurate cluster icm abundance determinations might allow discrimination between these two competing scenarios ( simply by comparing with the abundance ratio pattern for any type ii or type ia sne predominance ) .",
    "_    recently ishimaru & arimoto ( 1997 ) , utilizing the meteoritic abundance scaling and type ii sn yields from tsujimoto ( 1995 ) , concluded that @xmath1% of the icm fe originated from type ia sne .",
    "loewenstein & mushotzky ( 1996 ) , using self - consistent arguments independent of the assumed solar abundance scaling ( despite implications to the contrary in ishimaru & arimoto 1997 ) , showed that models where all of the enrichment was due to type ii sn were consistent with the asca data  although they took care to note that a significant type ia sne contribution to the fe enrichment could not be ruled out .",
    "the important difference in their models was the adoption of type ii sn yields from woosley & weaver ( 1995 ) .",
    "it is our goal herein to more fully and systematically examine how these type ia versus type ii icm iron contribution arguments are _ crucially dependent upon the adopted theoretical type ii sne yields .",
    "such an appreciation was not apparent in ishimaru & arimoto ( 1997 ) , who erroneously attributed their relatively high inferred type ia sne contribution to the icm fe enrichment to their rescaling of the original mushotzky ( 1996 ) abundance ratio determinations ; in fact their conclusions were tied inexorably to the tsujimoto ( 1995 ) yields .",
    "_    in section [ analysis ] , we present the basic framework necessary to replicate the ishimaru & arimoto ( 1997 ) analysis . instead of restricting ourselves to a single type ii sne yield compilation , though , we consider several competitors .",
    "we list their inherent differences ( differing treatments of convection , mass - loss , reaction rates ) and concentrate on their effects upon the predicted icm elemental abundance ratios . in what follows ,",
    "we are solely interested in abundance _ ratio questions , and thus for simplicity s sake we shall simply adopt the salpeter ( 1955 ) imf used by ishimaru & arimoto .",
    "arguments pertaining to _ absolute abundance masses favour an imf biased toward massive stars ( loewenstein & mushotzky 1996 ; gibson & matteucci 1997 ) , but these are not particularly relevant to the analysis that follows . _ _    will we have a definitive answer to the question of type ia versus type ii icm iron origin at the conclusion of this paper ? to anticipate our conclusions , no .",
    "what we hope to leave with the reader is a better appreciation of the uncertainties involved , and in particular , how a definitive answer _ can not _ be reached until further convergence of type ii sne models is achieved .",
    "our results are summarised in section [ summary ] .",
    "in order to quantify the roles played by sne types ia and ii in contributing to the icm heavy element abundances , we make use of the formalism presented in ishimaru & arimoto ( 1997 ) .",
    "let us restrict ourselves , for the time being , to the question of the icm iron origins .",
    "we write the fractional contribution of sne type ia to the icm iron as @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the frequency of type ia relative to type ii sne .",
    "the iron yield averaged over the type ii sn progenitor imf , @xmath8 , is written @xmath9 the bounds for type ii sne progenitors are taken to be @xmath10 m@xmath11 and @xmath12 m@xmath11 , respectively , and an imf slope @xmath13 ( salpeter 1955 ) is adopted throughout .",
    "we have purposefully avoided considering @xmath14 as an additional free parameter in the analysis . while this slope is of prime importance for arguments concerning the absolute mass of elements in the icm ( loewenstein & mushotzky 1996 ) , it is less so for abundance _ ratios . _",
    "the primary ingredients in the analysis that follows are the adopted nucleosynthesis sources . for type ia sne",
    ", the yield appears to be independent of progenitor model , and hence we adopt the updated model w7 yields of thielemann , nomoto & hashimoto ( 1993 )  the lower portion of table 1 lists the type ia yields @xmath15 .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     @xmath16__no mixture of type ia and ii sne can recover the observed icm ratios , for the yield source in question .",
    "_ _    from the solid curves in the top two panels of figure 1 ( or the corresponding entries in table 3 ) , we can see that ishimaru & arimoto ( 1997 ) favour a type ia iron fractional contribution to the icm of @xmath17% and @xmath18% , based upon oxygen and silicon , respectively , because of their use of the tsujimoto ( 1995 ) yields .",
    ", as opposed to the salpeter ( 1955 ) value of @xmath19 , then the implied icm m@xmath20m@xmath21 ratios for oxygen and silicon would be reduced from @xmath22 and @xmath23 , respectively , to @xmath24 and @xmath25 , respectively , thereby strengthening the support for a @xmath26 type ii - to - type ia predominance ratio . ]",
    "simply replacing the tsujimoto yields with those of woosley & weaver ( 1995 ) would allow anything in the range of @xmath27% , depending upon assumed sne energetics ( an important consideration in determining the amount of si , s , and fe , for example , that fall back onto the collapsed remnant ) and progenitor metallicity .    of particular interest",
    "is the behaviour of the [ o / fe ] models when the effects of maeder ( 1992)-style mass - loss or arnett ( 1996)-style convection are taken into account .",
    "here we are somewhat restricted in that both these grids only consider hydrostatic evolution ; the effects of explosive nucleosynthesis upon the yields are not included , and these can be profound for si , s , and fe .",
    "thusly , we simply examine o ( for the maeder grid ) and o , mg , and ne ( for the arnett grid ) , adopting reasonable assumptions for the fe for each grid  tsujimoto 1995 , for maeder ( because of some convection - treatment similarities ) , and arnett 1991 , for arnett ( for obvious reasons ) .",
    "perhaps the most important result to take away from our study is the behaviour of these arnett ( 1996 ) and maeder ( 1992 ) models ( a96 and t95+m92 , respectively ) in figure 1 ( and table 3 ) . for these type ii sne yield sources , any model that includes an icm type ia iron fractional contribution",
    "@xmath28% is at odds with the mean of the asca sis cluster data.this appears to be a fairly robust conclusion  the most modern treatments of convection and mass - loss _ both act in the direction of favouring a dominant type ii origin to the icm iron abundance .",
    "_    unfortunately , while oxygen may be pointing toward a type ii sne origin to the icm abundances , the situation with silicon ( the other element that ishimaru & arimoto 1997 considered as the most important in their analysis ) is not so obvious .",
    "an icm type ia iron fractional contribution in the range @xmath27% is allowed by the current grid of type ii sne models , but we can not , as of yet , quantify accurately the effects of mass - loss and other convection treatments ( a la maeder 1992 and arnett 1996 ) on the silicon yields , as both these models only considered hydrostatic evolution .",
    "explosive nucleosynthesis computations for these grids are eagerly anticipated .    while mg , ne , and s are usually given less weight in these icm abundance analyses ( see mushotzky 1996 for a discussion of the inherent difficulties in accurately determining their respective abundances ) ,",
    "their behaviour in the @xmath29-{\\rm m}_{\\rm fe , snia}/{\\rm m}_{\\rm fe , total}$ ] plane ( figure 1 ) is nonetheless interesting .",
    "( i ) the tsujimoto ( 1995 ) [ mg / fe ] ratios are significantly higher than those of woosley & weaver ( 1995 ) and , to a lesser extent , arnett ( 1996 ) . while adopting the latter would lead one to conclude that type ia sne contribute @xmath30% of the icm fe , ishimaru & arimoto ( 1997 ) , because they followed tsujimoto , favour @xmath31% .",
    "( ii ) there is an apparent dichotomy between the neon and sulphur results .",
    "one must be cautious against putting too much weight on the neon observations , due to potential systematic problems ( mushotzky 1996 ) .",
    "on the other hand , as already commented upon in mushotzky ( 1996 ) and loewenstein & mushotzky ( 1996 ) , there would appear to be no escape from the fact that the sulphur abundances are at odds with a type ii - dominated origin to the icm iron abundance ( although the uncertainties are large ) .",
    "this appears to be entirely independent of adopted type ii sne yields .    finally ,",
    "while many arguments still remain unresolved as far as the icm type ia sne iron fraction goes , it should be readily apparent from inspection of table 3 that regardless of type ii yield compilation assumed , @xmath32% of the icm oxygen , silicon , magnesium , and neon originated from type ii sne .",
    "moreover , since type ia and type ii sn kinetic energies are similar but the average fe yield 5 - 10 times higher for type ia , type ii sne must dominate the energetics of early galactic winds  even if half of the fe originates in type i sne .",
    "ishimaru & arimoto ( 1997 ) recently put the four mushotzky ( 1996 ) asca icm determinations onto the meteoritic abundance scale and concluded that @xmath1% of the icm iron must have originated from type ia sne .",
    "this fractional value is linked inexorably to the adopted type ii sne yields used in their analysis  those of tsujimoto ( 1995 ) .",
    "we have re - examined the ishimaru & arimoto results , adopting a range of the type ii sne models available in the literature .",
    "these models sample a wide variety of input physics ( pre - sn stellar winds , convective overshooting , reaction rates ) and provide , for the first time , a better appreciation for the dependence of type ia versus type ii arguments on the adopted yields .",
    "specifically , we have demonstrated that the most recent treatments of convection ( arnet 1996 ) and mass - loss ( maeder 1992 and langer & henkel 1995 ) _ both reduce the icm type ia iron fractional contribution from @xmath1% to @xmath33% . this is a preliminary result that needs confirmation once full grids of type ii sne yields are published that include self - consistent treatments of mass - loss , explosive nucleosynthesis , fall - back onto the remnant , and large atomic networks .",
    "_    several further caveats should be expressed  (",
    "i ) there is no _ a priori reason why the type ii progenitors need follow an @xmath13 imf power - law slope ; as noted earlier , if the slope more closely resembles a scalo ( 1986 ) imf ( @xmath34 ) , then the icm type ia iron fraction is reduced a further @xmath35% . ( ii )",
    "we have not been concerned with cluster - to - cluster differences in the effective type ia versus type ii contributions , only the unweighted mean .",
    "( iii ) there are still fairly large statistical uncertainties in the abundance determinations ( uncertainties of @xmath36% , @xmath37% , @xmath37% , @xmath2% , and @xmath2% , for si / fe , o / fe , ne / fe , mg / fe , and s / fe , respectively ) .",
    "( iv ) all type ia yields are tied exclusively to the w7 model of thielemann ( 1993 ) .",
    "( v ) the @xmath38 m@xmath11 yields are essentially unknown ; we have extrapolated from the lower - mass limits in the various grids , but there is no reason to suspect that this is entirely satisfactory .",
    "for the imfs discussed in this paper , @xmath39% of the mass in a stellar generation is locked up in this uncertain regime . _    in conclusion , while our model predictions for the icm [ o / fe ] appear to favour a highly dominant type ii sne origin to the icm iron , especially when coupled with the maeder ( 1992 ) , or arnett ( 1996 ) oxygen yields , we can not unequivocally state that this is the case  there still exists much uncertainty in the massive star models ( in particular , convection mass - loss , reaction rates , location of the iron `` cut '' , and fall - back onto the remnant ) .",
    "regardless of the lack of a definitive answer as to the type ia versus type ii icm iron origin , this study does illustrate its underappreciated sensitivity to the adopted type ii sne yields .",
