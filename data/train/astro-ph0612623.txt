    "based on the standard afterglow model ( e.g. sari , piran and narayan 1998 ) , an optical light curve can be expected to consist of a combination of four power - law segments , with connections at certain break frequencies .",
    "the break frequencies are the self - absorption frequency ( @xmath4 ) , the typical frequency ( @xmath5 ) and the cooling frequency ( @xmath6 ) . before the _ hete-2 _ era , almost all grb light curves showed only the @xmath7 segment characterized by a single declining or achromatic break .",
    "note that the standard afterglow model predicts the existence of a peak at an early time when the typical synchrotron @xmath8 frequency crosses into the optical frequency .",
    "before the peak time @xmath9 , the luminosity increases proportional to @xmath10 , until reaching the maximum flux @xmath11 at @xmath12 ; the subsequent decay of the luminosity is proportional to @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the index of the power - law distribution of energetic electrons accelerated at the shock . since the break time varies with the frequency ,",
    "multi - color observations of the very early afterglow are required , so as to catch @xmath8 in the optical wavelength . up to now",
    ", there have only been a few cases ( such as grb 021004 ; urata et al 2005a ) for which early time multi - color data are available .",
    "grb 041006 was detected with _ hete-2 _ at 12:18:08 ut on 2004 october 06 .",
    "the wide - field x - ray monitor ( wxm ; shirasaki et al 2003 ) localized the burst in real time , resulting in a gcn alert 42 seconds after the burst trigger .",
    "the flight error region was a circle with a @xmath15 radius ( 90% confidence level ) centered at @xmath16 , @xmath17 .",
    "spectral analysis showed the 2 - 30 kev fluence of this event to be @xmath18 and the 30 - 400 kev fluence to be @xmath19 : the ratio between these two values means that it can be classified as an `` x - ray rich grb '' .",
    "the light curve shape of the gamma - ray pulse of grb 041006 is very similar to that of grb 030329 but , its spectral characteristics are 20 times fainter .",
    "grb 041006 shows a soft precursor before the main gamma - ray pulse ( galassi et al .",
    "2004 ) . at 1.4 hours after the burst",
    ", the optical afterglow was found within the @xmath15-radius error circle at the following coordinates : @xmath20 , @xmath21 ( da costa et al .",

    "the follow - up observations of the grb 041006 optical afterglow at the kiso , lulin and xinglong observatories were carried out within the framework of the east asia follow - up observation network ( eafon , urata et al .",
    "the 1.05 m schmidt telescope and a @xmath23 ccd camera at the kiso observatory were used to make 300 sec exposure @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 band imaging observations , starting at 12:51 ut on 2004 october 6 ( 0.009 days after the burst ) .",
    "the field of view is @xmath24 , and the pixel size is @xmath25 square . before receiving",
    "the report by da costa et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , we had attempted to cover the entire _",
    "_ error region .",
    "we made @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 band imaging observations of 300 sec exposure each .",
    "the afterglow was clearly detected in all bands . in order to image simultaneously the optical afterglow and several landolt standard stars in sa92 ( landolt 1992 ) , we pointed the telescope 5 arcmin to the east ( figure [ grb041006image ] ) .",
    "the @xmath2 band observations were performed using the 0.6 m telescope at the xinglong observatory , starting at 2004 october 6 ( 14:33 ut ; 0.094 days after the burst ) .",
    "the filed of view is @xmath26 , and the pixel size is @xmath27 square .",
    "the @xmath0 and @xmath2 band observation of the afterglow was also performed with the lulin - one - meter - telescope @xcite on the night of october 6 ( @xmath28 days after the burst ) .",
    "additional @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath29 band observations were made by the maidnak 1.5 m telescope on october 6 .",
    "the time coverage of the observations was from 0.149 to 0.188 days after the burst .",
    "the data reduction was carried out using the standard package noao iraf package .",
    "we performed the bias - subtraction and flat - fielding correction using the appropriate calibration data .",
    "we calibrated the flux zero - point of our images through a comparison with the sa92 standard star field .",
    "we also performed cross calibrations of our photometric results using several field stars for which the magnitudes have been calibrated by henden ( 2004 ) .",
    "the difference of photometric zero points between our sa92 and henden s filed photometry is within 0.04 mag .",
    "aperture photometry for all the data was performed using the apphot package of iraf .",
    "the photometric results are summarized in table [ grb041006obs ] .",
    "the multi - band light curves of the grb 041006 afterglow are shown in figure [ grb041006lc ] .",
    "in addition to our @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 band data , there are several unfiltered observations , the @xmath2 band data points reported in the gcn circulars ( yost et al .",
    "2004 ; ayani & yamaoka 2004 ; fugazza et al . 2004 ; monfardini et al . 2004",
    "; misra & pandey 2004 ; kahharov et al . 2004 ; kinugasa & torii 2004 ) , and a number of published @xmath2 and @xmath1 band data points ( soderberg et al .",
    "2005 ; stanek et al . 2005 ) were included in figure 2 .",
    "the @xmath0-band light curve showed a clear plateau at around 0.03 days after the burst , although its behavior in earlier epochs remains unknown .",
    "interestingly , the @xmath2 band light curve shows a hint of a plateau , or a possible slope change , around 0.1 days after the burst .",
    "these observational results indicate that the @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 band photometric points obtained by eafon play an important role in characterizing the temporal evolution of the afterglow .    as is obvious in the figure [ grb041006lc ] , the single power law fit ( @xmath30 , @xmath31 with @xmath32=56 ) of the @xmath2 band light curve is poorly described .",
    "it is also unlikely that the @xmath1 band light curve can be described with the single power law ( @xmath33 , @xmath34 with @xmath32=9 ) . on the other hand , the data subsets at @xmath35 days and @xmath36 days can be described successfully by two separate single power - law models . for the @xmath2 band",
    ", we have obtained @xmath37 with @xmath38 for @xmath39 before 0.04 days , and @xmath40 with @xmath41 for @xmath42 after 0.15 days ; for the @xmath1 band @xmath43 with @xmath44 for @xmath45 before 0.04 day , and @xmath46 with @xmath47 for @xmath48 after 0.15 days from this point of view , the overall behavior of these multi band light curves may then be understood as the sum of two separate components , one showing a monotonic decay with the other having a rising and a falling phase .",
    "the photometric results were corrected for galactic reddening , using the reddening map of schlegel , finkbeiner , & davis ( 1998 ) .",
    "the galactic reddening toward the burst is @xmath49)= 0.022 , which implies a galactic extinction of @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "although the light curves in figure [ grb041006lc ] suggest a significant color change within @xmath52 days , our data coverage is insufficient to make a conclusion about such a possibility .",
    "accordingly , for simplicity s sake we assume that at @xmath36 days the power - law spectrum of the afterglow has a constant index . the observed color , @xmath53 mag , then indicates a spectral index of @xmath54 in terms of @xmath55 .",
    "this is close to the value of @xmath56 , which is predicted by the spherically symmetric model of sari , piran , & halpern ( 1999 ) in the regime of @xmath57 in combination with the measured @xmath58 .",
    "we observed the grb 041006 optical afterglow from the very early phase ( @xmath59 days after the burst ) in three bands .",
    "although the relatively early phase of a dozen afterglows such as grb 990123 @xcite , multi - color observations of very early optical afterglow are still rare . in the grb 021004 case , the very early optical afterglow shows a clear achromatic re - brightening phase which peaks was at around @xmath60 days @xcite . on the other hand , the afterglow behavior of grb 041006 depends on its color .",
    "the @xmath0 band light curve shows a clear plateau at around 0.03 days after the burst , although its behavior in earlier epochs remains unknown .",
    "the @xmath2 band light curve shows the hint of a plateau , or a possible slope change , around 0.1 days after the burst .",
    "several models , based on the standard afterglow model , can be used to explain the variability in the light curve , such as the variable external density ( e.g. lazati et al . 2002 ) , refreshed shock ( rees & mszros 1998 ; kumar & piran 2000a ; sari & mszros 2000 ) , and patchy shell models ( kumar & piran 2000b ) . to explain the present multi - band light curves , these models require similar temporal behavior in each band . if the light curve of grb 041006 does not show a color change , it should have two bumps with almost the same amplitudes .",
    "the patchy shell model is not suitable to explain current light curves in this case .",
    "this is because the model predicts that the amplitude of the fluctuations in the afterglow light cure is expected to decrease with time proportional to the lorentz factor .",
    "the suggested second component may be identified with the brightening phase of sari et al s standard afterglow model ( 1998 ) which predicts the evolution to consist of four phases involving a convex - shaped period ; the brightening phase can be expressed with a power - law index of 0.5 . to describe the plateau phase together with the monotonically decreasing first component , we use the single power law , plus a smoothly broken power law function expressed as @xmath61},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath62 fixed at 0.5 after sari et al .",
    "we obtain an acceptable fit for the @xmath2 band light curve with @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 ( @xmath66 with @xmath67 ) .",
    "we also fit the @xmath0 and @xmath1 band light curves with the same function . for better constraints",
    ", we fix the @xmath68 for @xmath0 band and @xmath69 of the @xmath1 band . due to the lack of data points for the first components in the @xmath0 band , and the former components in the @xmath1 band .",
    ", these vales come from the result of @xmath2 band fitting . for the @xmath0 band , we obtained @xmath70 and @xmath71 ( @xmath72 with @xmath73 ) ; for the @xmath1 band , @xmath74 and @xmath75 ( @xmath76 with @xmath77 ) . in figure",
    "[ grb041006lc ] , these best fit functions are superposed on the @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 band data points . based on the equation ( sari et al",
    ". 1998 )    @xmath78    we can estimate the strength parameter of the magnetic field @xmath79 and/or the injected electrons parameter @xmath80 as follows ; @xmath81 .",
    "this value is consistent with the result of panaitescu & kumar ( 2001 , 2002 ) which was estimated from late - time multi - frequency afterglow observations .    about the first component ,",
    "the decay index is @xmath82 and the back - extrapolated power - law function can successfully account for the point at 14.4 min after the burst observed by rotse - iii @xcite .",
    "the temporal index is considered to be directly related to the prompt emission , as observed in the case of grb 990123 @xcite or grb 030418 @xcite .",
    "however , the temporal index is inconsistent with the values ( @xmath83 or @xmath84 ) predicted by a reverse shock model @xcite .",
    "thus the first component is not likely to be an optical flash , such as is the case for grb 990123 . considering the above discussions one of possible explanation is that these emissions come from multiple jets and/or sub - jets ( nakamura 2000 , yamazaki et al .",
    "2004 ) . in the multiple jet case ,",
    "the former emissions and the latter components are caused by narrower and wider jets , respectively .",
    "thanks to our eafon observations , we have obtained early b , v and r band possible re - brightening episode for grb 041006 . while there are several other afterglows similar to grb 050319 ( wozniak et al 2005 ; huang et al 2006 ) and grb 050525a @xcite for which the early optical behaviors may possibly be similar to that of grb 041006 , their physical mechanism is not clear , due to the general lack of color / spectrum information on the early optical afterglows . the present work has provided some hints for the current shallow decaying of the x - ray and optical behaviors .",
