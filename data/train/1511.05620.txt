    "protoplanetary disks form around low mass stars as a consequence of stellar formation when collapse of a slowly spinning molecular cloud core transforms it into a rapidly rotating star - disk system .",
    "once formed , the disk undergoes viscous evolution via shearing stresses that are set up through differential rotation of its gas and dust constituents .",
    "much of the disk mass flows inward and accretes onto the star , while simultaneously a portion of its mass is transported far outward ( to conserve angular momentum ) , causing the disk to continuously spread outwards throughout its @xmath9 10 myr evolution ( pringle 1981 ) .",
    "planetesimals and planetary cores form via coagulation and accretion of the remaining dust and gas on timescales of a few myr or less , before the disk is dissipated .",
    "all of these processes , and the mass available for planet formation , rely on the details of how matter is moved through protoplanetary disks .",
    "the surface density profile @xmath10 - or mass per area of disk as a function of distance from the star @xmath11 - determines how much of mass might have been available in the feeding regions of the planets ; its evolution over time determines how mass moves in the disk and also how the planetary masses grow .",
    "theoretical models of disk evolution are based on the canonical equations by lynden - bell & pringle ( 1974 ; hereafter lbp ) .",
    "these models assume that the disk evolves via shearing stresses mediated by a turbulent viscosity @xmath1 that varies as @xmath1 @xmath12 @xmath13 where @xmath14 @xmath9",
    "they predict that @xmath15 should approximate a power law @xmath16 across much of the disk , with slope @xmath17 @xmath9 1 .",
    "model predictions of disk integrated properties appear consistent with observations of disks in low mass star forming regions such as taurus ( hartmann et al .",
    "observations of resolved disks , on the other hand , can provide direct estimates of @xmath18 .",
    "recent work with millimeter wavelength surveys of disks in another low - mass star forming region , ophiuchus ( andrews et al .  2009 ; andrews et al .  2010 ) , fit @xmath18 to a profile @xmath19 @xmath20 $ ] ( @xmath21 is the characteristic radius where the shape of the @xmath19 profile changes from the power - law to the exponential taper ) which is similar to the lbp similarity solutions , and find @xmath14 to be within the range 0.4 - 1.1 , with a median value of about 0.9 .",
    "this seems to be consistent with theoretical predictions of @xmath18 of viscously evolving disks .",
    "despite this tentative match , one must use caution when inferring the distribution of mass from such observations .",
    "it is not even certain that all the mass is being observed , as several factors may lead to the disk mass in any annulus being underestimated .",
    "the millimeter opacity of solids is sensitive to changes in grain size and composition ( beckwith et al .  1990 ,",
    "beckwith & sargent 1991 ) . converting a solids mass to a mass of gas requires knowledge of the uncertain dust - to - gas mass ratio .",
    "also , some massive disks may still be optically thick in the sub - mm regime , hence shadowing some of the disk mass ( andrews & williams 2005 ) .",
    "sub - mm observations are also not sensitive to @xmath22mm - sized dust grains , and hence may not account for mass locked up in larger grains , or even planets that have already formed , as they will remain undetectable for several myr .",
    "thus it is difficult to definitively derive @xmath18 from astronomical observations .",
    "although the sun s protoplanetary disk has long ago dissipated , an estimate of @xmath18 ( in a snapshot or time - averaged sense ) can be obtained from the known masses and compositions of the planets .",
    "weidenschilling ( 1977b ) and later , hayashi ( 1981 ) developed the so - called minimum mass solar nebula ( mmsn ) model in which an estimate of the surface density profile of the solar nebula is found by augmenting the known mass of each planet ( located in its present day orbit ) with h@xmath23/he gas to bring it to solar composition , and then dividing this augmented mass by the area of the annulus in which it orbits .",
    "an estimate of @xmath18 is found at each planet s radial location @xmath11 , and a power law can be fit to these points .",
    "a widely used equation for the mmsn model put forward by hayashi ( 1981 ) is : @xmath24 later , this model was extended to extrasolar planetary systems as the minimum mass extrasolar nebula ( mmen ) model ( kuchner 2004 ; chiang & laughlin 2013 ; and raymond & cossou 2014 ) , using some of the @xmath22 470 known multiple planet systems . for such close - in planetary systems ,",
    "@xmath18 can only be inferred up to a few au .",
    "chiang & laughlin ( 2013 ) find the slope of @xmath10 to be @xmath17 @xmath9 1.6 - 1.8 , while raymond & cossou ( 2014 ) argue that @xmath18 varies wildly amongst planetary systems and @xmath9 1.6 is only a median value . with future data from more",
    "widely separated planetary systems , any universal or median mmen will provide for much better comparison with the mmsn model than current data .",
    "the slopes for @xmath18 inferred from the mmsn and mmen models , @xmath17 @xmath25 1.5 - 1.6 , are steeper than the slope of the profile measured from observations or predicted by theory .",
    "however , the mmsn and mmen models suffer from many shortcomings . for the mmen model ,",
    "there are large uncertainties or lack of data on mass , radii and the composition of planets , and drawing out a surface density profile mandates assuming a uniform ( usually chondritic ) composition , and usually a mass from a known radius assuming a mass - radius relation ( chiang & laughlin 2013 ) .",
    "it also inherently assumes that the planets were formed where they are now observed . as for the mmsn , while it offers a direct reference measurement of @xmath18 from our own solar system , it only accounts for the minimum amount of mass in the solar nebula that was sequestered into the final planets .",
    "it assumes that no solids were lost from the nebula throughout its evolution and also only samples the disk at one given point in nebular history , i.e. , after the outer planets assumed their final positions in their current orbits .",
    "both the mmsn and the mmen models do not account for the migration of planets in the disk , when numerous observations of close - in hot massive planets in exoplanetary systems suggest significant planetary migration driven by exchange of angular momentum with the disk gas as well as planetesimals ( armitage 2007 ; crida 2007 ; walsh et al .  2011 ; kley & nelson 2012 ) . planetary migration , if present , can later dramatically modify the initial surface density profile that was available for planet formation .",
    "it was in this context that desch ( 2007 ) argued that the dynamical constraints from the nice model ( tsiganis et al .",
    "2005 ; gomes et al .  2005 ; morbidelli et al .",
    "2005 ) at @xmath9 880 myr after the formation of the disk provide for an mmsn model better suited for studying the structure of the early disk .",
    "the nice model argues that the giant planets are likely to have formed from a more compact configuration , at 5.45 , 8.18 , 11.5 and 14.2 au for jupiter , saturn , neptune and uranus respectively ( in which the two ice giants likely swapped places ) .",
    "substantial migration of outer planets eventually led to their final positions today , spread across 5 - 30 au . with this configuration",
    ", the nice model successfully explains many dynamical constraints of the solar system including the observed orbital parameters of the giant planets , as well as the halt of neptune s migration , dynamical classes of the kuiper belt , origin of the jovian trojan asteroids and the late heavy bombardment .",
    "desch ( 2007 ) used these updated positions of the giant planets in the mmsn model to find a @xmath18 profile that was steeper than the mmsn model with a slope of @xmath26 : @xmath27 where @xmath28 is a factor describing the fraction of solids in dust at the end of planet formation .",
    "this compact architecture results in a higher @xmath18 throughout the disk and also in a steeper @xmath19 profile .",
    "desch ( 2007 ) found that such a steep profile matches very well with the solution of a steady - state _ decretion disk _",
    "( lee et al .  1991 ) i.e. , a disk which is losing mass radially _ outward_. he argued that this disk mass loss process can be explained very well by photoevaporation due to intense far ultraviolet ( fuv ) radiation from a nearby massive star .",
    "photoevaporation is an efficient mechanism for disk dispersal , in which the disk is impinged by external extreme - ultraviolet ( euv ) or fuv radiation that causes the gas in the upper atmosphere of the disk to heat to @xmath9 @xmath29 and escape the gravitational potential of the star .",
    "it was directly observed in the trapezium cluster of the orion nebula where disks close to @xmath30 ori c ( the o star in the orion nebula ) were not only found to be truncated ( mccaughrean & o@xmath31dell 1996 ) but also were observed to be losing mass steadily with mass - loss rates of up to @xmath32 @xmath33 ( henney & o@xmath31dell 1999 ) .",
    "recent atacama large millimeter array ( alma ) observations by mann et al .",
    "( 2014 ) rule out any observational bias and confirm a distinct lack of massive disks close to the o star ( @xmath9 0.03 pc ) .",
    "disks born in low - mass star forming regions ( like taurus or ophiuchus ) however , viscously spread to large radii @xmath9 300 au ( hartmann et al .",
    "1998 ; andrews & williams 2007 ; andrews et al .",
    "2009 , 2010 ) , in contrast to truncated photoevaporated disks .",
    "it is very likely that the sun s protoplanetary disk experienced photoevaporation . from observations of nearby clusters",
    ", it is expected that roughly 50% of all disks are likely to be present in intensely irradiated birth environments with sufficient fuv flux to cause significant mass loss via external photoevaporation ( lada & lada 2003 ) .",
    "the abundances of short - lived radionuclides that are more likely to have been created in nearby supernovae ( wadhwa et al .",
    "2007 ) and then injected into the solar nebula ( ouellette et al .  2010 ; pan et al .",
    "2012 ) very likely betray the presence of nearby massive stars .",
    "the orbit of sedna also suggests that it is likely to have been perturbed inward into the solar system due to a nearby passing star ( kenyon & bromley 2004 ) . the edge of the kuiper belt at @xmath947 au is also consistent with a disk that is seemingly truncated in a clustered environment , which could be attributed to either cluster dynamics where a passing star strips material off of the disk ( clarke & pringle 1993 ; kobayashi & ida 2001 ; adams 2010 ) or truncation due to photoevaporation ( trujillo & brown 2001 ; hollenbach & adams 2004 ) .",
    "finally , the oxygen isotope anomalies found in ca - al inclusions in meteorites is likely resolved by an isotopically selective fractionation caused by the self - shielding of co against photodissociation by external fuv radiation ( lyons et al .",
    "it has also been argued that external fuv radiation is also likely to create enormous quantities of amorphous ice in the cold outer disk ( ciesla 2014 ; monga & desch 2015 ) that will be able to trap noble gases , which upon radially migrating inward lead to the noble gas abundances measured by the galileo mission in jupiter s atmosphere ( monga & desch 2015 ) .",
    "external photoevaporation therefore very likely affected the structure and dynamics within our protoplanetary disk .",
    "if external photoevaporation affected the surface density profile of our protoplanetary disk in the manner predicted by desch ( 2007 ) , the outer parts of the solar nebula would be described as a steady - state decretion disk .",
    "mass would flow from a reservoir in the inner disk , outward with a constant mass decretion rate @xmath34 through the outer disk , to an outer edge where it is lost by photoevaporation .",
    "in the 5 - 30 au region of the disk , a slope @xmath17 @xmath25 2.2 is predicted .",
    "more recently , mitchell & stewart ( 2010 ) performed numerical simulations of disks subjected to external photoevaporation to test whether the steady - state decretion disk solution of desch ( 2007 ) applied . from their simulations , they report quasi - steady state disks with less steep profiles having slopes @xmath17 @xmath9 1.6 - 1.8 .",
    "this is not as steep as the profile inferred by desch ( 2007 ) , but the discrepancy may have to do with the way viscosity is handled .",
    "the viscosity of mitchell & stewart ( 2010 ) was parameterized in the usual way , with the fiducial @xmath0 scaling relation from shakura & sunyaev ( 1973 ) in which @xmath1 = @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the speed of sound , which denotes the maximum velocity scale of turbulence ; @xmath37 is the scale height of the disk , which denotes the maximum size scale of turbulence assumed ; and @xmath0 is the dimensionless scaling factor for turbulent viscosity that represents the efficiency for angular momentum transport .",
    "it is important to note that mitchell & stewart ( 2010 ) assumed a uniform value for @xmath0 throughout the radial extent of the disk .",
    "we assert that this is an ad hoc assumption unless an actual mechanism for angular momentum transport is identified .",
    "likely mechanisms do not predict uniform @xmath0 .",
    "for example , one mechanism that has often been proposed for angular momentum transport - at least early in the evolution of the disk , while it is still massive - is the gravitational instability ( gi ) in which @xmath0 depends on the toomre parameter @xmath38 ( here @xmath39 is the orbital frequency ) as given by the following prescription from lin & pringle ( 1990 ) : @xmath40 ^ 2 - 1 \\right ) , \\ ] ] where @xmath41 is the minimum value of @xmath42 at which the disk becomes gravitationally unstable . since @xmath42 is clearly dependent on @xmath11 , @xmath0 can be expected to be variable through the radius of the disk , if disk viscosity originated due to gi .",
    "the most widely accepted mechanism attributed to the transport of mass and angular momentum across the disk is the magnetorotational instability , or mri ( balbus & hawley 1998 ; gammie 1996 ) , whose operation is dominant in regions of the disk where gas with a sufficiently high ionization fraction is coupled to the magnetic field .",
    "a disk with a varying density profile across radius and height , ionized mainly by stellar x rays and cosmic radiation , would have an ionization fraction varying by several orders of magnitude .",
    "such variation in ionization levels is also apparently observed in the tw hya disk by cleeves et al .",
    "( 2015 ) , which is possibly due to the spatially varying ability of stellar wind to repel cosmic rays ( cleeves et al .",
    "a varying ion fraction would also result in a variable @xmath0 across the disk .",
    "dense gas and dust - rich protoplanetary disks are only partially ionized systems , and hence it is important to consider the effects of non - ideal magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) in the operation of the mri .",
    "ambipolar diffusion takes particular importance as it operates in the highly ionized and low density regime which primarily constitutes the disk atmosphere and large portions of the outer disk ( bai & stone 2011 ) .",
    "we begin our simulations with disk mass @xmath43 = 0.1 @xmath44 - the expected upper threshold for a gravitationally stable disk , and incorporate the formulation of bai & stone ( 2011 ) for deriving mri - viscosity from ionization state by including the non - ideal mhd effects of ambipolar diffusion , to estimate the value of @xmath0 across the radial and vertical extent of the disk .",
    "a similar effort of including mri derived viscosity with non - ideal mhd effects in ppd simulations was also undertaken by landry et al .",
    "they perform simulations where they include ambipolar diffusion using the prescription of bai & stone ( 2011 ) as well as ohmic resistivity , but do not discuss photoevaporation that can also significantly affect disk behavior . in this work ,",
    "we argue and show that considering a variable value for @xmath0 in disk models can significantly affect the steepness of the disk profile .",
    "we also simultaneously incorporate external photoevaporation ( important for the sun s disk ) in our models and show how disk structure and evolution are dramatically altered by considering both non - uniform @xmath0 and external photoevaporation .    finally , gas and dust grain chemistry play a vital role in determining the ionization fraction in each region of the disk .",
    "previous works have employed : i ) simple dust models that include only a single ion - based chemistry ( molecular ion- or metal ion - based ) adapting work from oppenheimer & dalgarno ( 1974 ) ( e.g. fromang et al .",
    "2002 ) ; ii ) more complex chemical networks that account for multiple interacting species ( e.g. sano et al .",

    "ilgner & nelson ( 2006 ) present a comprehensive comparison between different models that are commonly used for dust chemistry in disks .",

    ", it is important to include the effects of external photoevaporation into a non - uniform @xmath0 viscosity disk evolution model .",
    "our ` 1.5-d ' disk evolution code employs the fiducial equations of viscous disk evolution from lbp where the rate of change of surface density @xmath18 is related to @xmath46 , the rate of inward mass flow through an annulus of the disk : @xmath47 where @xmath48 here @xmath49 refers to an inward mass flow toward the star , while @xmath50 refers to an outward flow towards the disk edge .",

    "we assume the mass of the host star is 1 @xmath44 .",
    "the ratio of stellar mass to disk mass of 0.1 represents the typical value of a most massive disk that is likely gravitationally stable .",

    "the boundary is fixed to be close to the stellar radius , although magnetospheric truncation of the disk ( bouvier et al .",

    "cosmic ray exclusion , however , causes steep profiles in the mid - regions of the disk that are important for giant planet formation . changing the disk chemistry",
    "also results in wildly varying slopes of the @xmath19 profile with time .",
    "our results show that the disk evolves very differently from previous disk models such as the self - similar viscous evolution models ( lbp ; hartmann et .",
    "al 1998 ) under the combined action of both non - uniform viscosity with dust and external photoevaporation , each of which contributes toward steepening of the disk profile . here ,",
    "we highlight some of the most important implications due to the variation of the structure and evolution of the non - uniform @xmath0-disk subject to photoevaporation .",
    "we find that the presence of dust dictates two distinct evolutionary tracks for non - uniform @xmath0 disks subject to external photoevaporation .",
    "we describe each case separately as follows :    in the case without dust , the structure of the disk is significantly altered due to the difference in mass flow between the inner dense disk and the outer tenuous disk . in a dust - free disk , @xmath0 is an increasing function with @xmath11 for several myr , due to the differing ion fractions between the inner and outer disk , creating an initial steep surface density profile as seen in fig .",
    "@xmath0 ranges over 2 - 3 orders of magnitude ( @xmath9 few @xmath178 10@xmath214 in the inner disk to @xmath9 10@xmath194 in the outer disk ) .",
    "this difference in magnitude is eventually reduced with time and the profile flattens out as the inner disk is cleared out by accretion onto the star , increasing the ion fraction in the interior and thus @xmath0 . determining the viscous timescale @xmath215 across the disk can lend a quantitative insight into the timescale of this mass transport process , for which the following expression is useful : @xmath216 assuming the disk is flaring slightly , using @xmath217 ( from the parameterization of shakura & sunyaev ( 1973 ) , as well as @xmath36 = @xmath218 ) , if @xmath0 is a constant , then @xmath215 @xmath12 @xmath219 . when we assume a non - uniform value of @xmath0 , in a disk with little or no dust , we find @xmath0 varies as @xmath0 @xmath12 @xmath11 between 2 - 20 au at @xmath220 .",
    "this leads to an initial value of @xmath215 @xmath12 @xmath221 .",
    "later at @xmath222 myr , as the @xmath0 profile steepens to @xmath9 @xmath223 , @xmath215 @xmath12 @xmath224 .",
    "the overall steady shape of the disk profile is maintained throughout the simulation as the rates of mass loss @xmath225 and @xmath226 match each other throughout the duration of 7.5 myr .    in the case with dust , as seen in fig .",
    "14 , the presence of dust exaggerates the already - increasing @xmath0 profile as dust absorbs and removes charges from the inner disk . in a dusty disk ,",
    "the @xmath0 slope is steeper , i.e. , @xmath0 @xmath12 @xmath227 at @xmath220 from 1 - 50 au and later increases to @xmath9 @xmath228 at @xmath229 myr within a 2 - 20 au region .",
    "this leads to @xmath215 @xmath12 @xmath230 at @xmath220 , increasing to @xmath231 at 5 myr .",
    "the @xmath215 effectively seems to decrease with radius through a large portion of the outer disk .",
    "mass is therefore transported very rapidly from the outer disk into the inner disk ( within a few au ) .",
    "this is a robust result as this results from the initial steep profile that arises from the non - uniform @xmath0 .",
    "this can also be seen in fig .",
    "16 where @xmath232 @xmath22 @xmath233 .",
    "the disk initially loses more mass to photoevaporation than accretion , and it takes several myr for accretion rates to catch up to photoevaporative rates , steepening the already steep surface density profile in the outer disk . from the results of our simulations ,",
    "we find that until grain growth is efficient , inner disk evolution is stalled and the disk develops a steep profile across the planet formation region ( 5 - 30 au ) .",
    "if the disk evolves in this manner , while jupiter may have sufficient @xmath19 in its formation region to reach isolation mass , the other outer planets may be likely left with too little mass to grow , as the disk gas is likely to be dissipated out of the outer disk very quickly .",
    "our results show that disks are more likely to evolve with steeper profiles than the mmsn profile ( with slope @xmath234 ) .",
    "desch ( 2007 ) had updated the mmsn profile with the positions of the giant planets in the compact configuration of the nice model ( tsiganis et al .",
    "2005 ) , and had found @xmath17 @xmath9 2.2 .",
    "desch ( 2007 ) had attributed this steeper slope to be due to mass removal by external photoevaporation . in this study",
    ", we investigated the evolution of the protoplanetary disks subject to photoevaporation , and a non - uniform mri viscosity .",
    "we find that while variable @xmath0 steepens the disk dramatically , external photoevaporation also steepens it but by not as much .",
    "the presence of dust also significantly steepens disk structure , the extent of which is uncertain as grain growth has not been included in this study",
    ". it would be useful to compare our model disk profiles to mmen surface density profiles derived from kepler data , but these are pertinent only to the innermost 0.5 au of the disk , where our models are potentially uncertain due to the assumed inner boundary condition .",
    "nevertheless , we find in our models without dust , the inner disks ( 0.2 to 5 au ) evolve to a state similar to the mmen profile of chiang & laughlin ( 2013 ) with @xmath19 profile slope p @xmath9 1.6 in the first 3 myr ( until the disk dissipates ) . in our models with dust , the innermost regions ( 0.2 to 5 au ) have steeper slopes p @xmath9 2.0 - 2.2 , although not as steep as in their outer regions .      in order to determine how long it takes for planet cores to grow within the surface density profiles predicted for photoevaporated non - uniform @xmath0 dusty disks",
    ", we use the planetary growth model employed by desch ( 2007 ) [ see equations 30 - 34 in desch ( 2007 ) ] that implements the growth rate equations of ida & makimo ( 1993 ) .",
    "the eccentricity of the planetesimals is derived assuming an equilibrium between the effect of gas drag and gravitational stirring of the planet cores as given in kokubo & ida ( 2002 ) , and the gas drag evaluated from the reynolds number ( re ) using the prescriptions from weidenschilling ( 1977a ) . a uniform initial size of planetesimals is assumed to be 100 m , similar to desch ( 2007 ) . desch ( 2007 )",
    "had considered a uniform non - varying surface density as well as a viscously evolving disk to calculate the growth timescales .",
    "we improve this model by taking a self - consistently decreasing solid surface density accompanying core growth with time .    assuming that each core only accretes planetesimals from its own feeding region",
    ", we obtain the growth profiles as shown in fig .  23 for our canonical photoevaporated dusty disk case .    from the growth profiles",
    ", we note that the cores of jupiter and saturn grow until 0.5 myr , while neptune and uranus take up to 2 myr to accrete all the planetesimals in their feeding regions .",
    "we also note that while photoevaporation does not affect the growth of jupiter s core , which rapidly accretes @xmath9 90 @xmath235 in 0.5 myr due to higher local @xmath19 , higher fuv fluxes are able to significantly stunt the growth of saturn s core .",
    "fuv fluxes corresponding to @xmath158 @xmath22 1000 may not allow saturn to accrete sufficient solid mass matching the predicted present - day value of 9 - 22 @xmath235 ( desch 2007 ) .",
    "neptune and uranus grow negligibly even without photoevaporation as they are not able to accrete mass quickly enough before the disk dissipates .",
    "more rapid growth timescales or migration of large planetesimals into the outer disk may be needed to explain their core growth .",
    "however , our models do not include grain growth , which could potentially make the @xmath19 profile more shallower allowing for more mass transported to the feeding regions of the outer ice giants , potentially leading to more core growth .",
    "lastly , we also argue that photoevaporation also dramatically affects radial transport of volatiles .",
    "takeuchi & lin ( 2002 ) have argued that if the sum of the slope @xmath17 of the surface density profile and the slope @xmath236 of the temperature profile ( equation 8) is @xmath22 2 , then the volatiles are transported radially outward in the nebula . in our work , we assume a typical temperature profile with @xmath237 , and we find steep surface density profiles with slope @xmath17 @xmath22 2 .",
    "thus , in our disks , the sum of the slopes @xmath238 , supporting outward volatile transport . from our simulations , we predict that photoevaporation is able to remove volatiles ( such as h@xmath239o ) efficiently through the disk outer edge even from as far in as the inner disk .",
    "this is a result from our simulations that in a photoevaporated disk , the transition radius @xmath166 can move inward with time as opposed to a non - photoevaporated viscously spreading disk , where @xmath166 increases with time ( hartmann et al .",
    "1998 ) as @xmath240 .",
    "this results in more and more mass being removed from the inner disk , the region of terrestrial planet formation .",
    "indeed , @xmath166 in some disks go as far inward as @xmath9 3 au .",
    "significant loss of volatiles from the inner disk material can severely affect the potential for future habitability of planets that form in the volatile - depleted inner disk .",
    "an important caveat of our models is that we do not yet include grain growth . in the absence of grain growth",
    ", dust efficiently stagnates inner disk evolution .",
    "accretion is very slow and mass transported from the highly ionized outer disk just accumulates in the middle and inner disk .",
    "we predict that with grain growth , the inner disk will be able to accrete onto the star after grain growth proceeds efficiently in 1 - 2 myr , and increase accretion rates such that disk evolution is quickened . this way , the steep profile erected by the initial stagnation of the disk will gradually flatten with time .",
    "such a disk may then have enough mass and time for the growth of the four giant planets across 5 - 30 au .",
    "however , it is also likely to be dissipated quickly with time ( as seen in g / d=10000 case in fig .  19 , where a higher g / d can be considered as a more advanced stage of grain growth ) .      in this work ,",
    "we have performed simulations of protoplanetary disk evolution where we have included the effects of i ) external photoevaporation ii ) mri - derived non - uniform viscosity , and iii ) a simple gas - grain chemical network to calculate ionization equilibrium state in the disk . from our simulations",
    ", we argue that it is important to consider both external photoevaporation and non - uniform viscosity in disk models as each contributes strongly in altering the disk profile in a unique manner .",
    "models incorporating external photoevaporation and a realistic prescription of viscosity and angular momentum transport may bring us closer to the behavior and evolution of the physical processes that transpired in the solar nebula that shaped the structure of the sun s protoplanetary disk and determined the composition of the terrestrial and the giant planets .",
