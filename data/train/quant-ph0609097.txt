    "the manipulation of coherent atomic and molecular dynamics often utilizes shaped electromagnetic fields as the control .",
    "this topic is the focus of extensive theoretical and experimental research  @xcite which relies on tailoring constructive and destructive interferences between different dynamical pathways of a quantum system .",
    "many laboratory implementations of quantum control with lasers use adaptive feedback learning techniques  @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we consider the manipulation of atomic and molecular dynamics with the control being a tailored non - equilibrium , and generally time - dependent , state of the surrounding environment .",
    "different non - equilibrium states of the environment can induce correspondingly unique dynamical responses in the physical system being controlled .",
    "incoherent control by the environment ( ice ) is distinct from operations with coherent control .",
    "control by ice affects a system through dissipative dynamics and can be used to steer the system from a pure or a mixed state into mixed and in some cases pure states .",
    "control by lasers normally affects the system through hamiltonian evolution and transforms pure states into the pure states . in practice limitations",
    "will exist on laser controls and the capabilities of ice as well .",
    "thus , in the most general circumstance a shaped laser pulse and a tailored non - equilibrium environment could be combined into an overall tool to simultaneously best perform control by hamiltonian and dissipative dynamics .",
    "this paper explicitly considers ice implemented by two types of environments : incoherent radiation ( i.e. , a gas of photons ) and gas of particles ( i.e. , electrons , atoms , or molecules ) .",
    "the particles of an environment ( i.e. , photons or matter ) are characterized by their momenta @xmath0 and internal degrees of freedom indexed by @xmath1 . for photons",
    "@xmath1 denotes polarization while for atoms or molecules it denotes their internal energy levels .",
    "the environment is described by the distribution of mean occupation numbers @xmath2 of its microscopic states @xmath3 at time @xmath4 .",
    "thermal equilibrium states are characterized by only a few parameters , such as temperature and chemical potential , which uniquely determine the corresponding equilibrium distribution .",
    "non - equilibrium states are characterized by occupation numbers of all microscopic states and have much richer structure . _",
    "the control considered with ice is the generally time dependent distribution function @xmath2_. the shape of this function ( i.e. , its dependence on @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath4 ) together with the interaction hamiltonian determines the dynamics of the system under control .",
    "although operation with ice does not induce coherent dynamics , nevertheless the shaping of @xmath2 over @xmath5 , and @xmath4 provides considerable flexibility for system manipulation .",
    "many control objectives can be expressed in terms of creating specific mixed states of a system , which should be amenable to utilizing non - equilibrium environmental states for their preparation .",
    "certain pure states can also be reached with ice .",
    "for example , incoherent radiation can steer a three - level @xmath6-atom from the ground state to the intermediate excited state , a gas can steer a two - level atom through collisions to the excited state , etc .    the practical creation of controls for implementing ice is important to consider .",
    "first , incoherent non - equilibrium radiation as a control includes monochromatic incoherent light , thermal radiation propagating in a medium with frequency sensitive absorbtion ( i.e. , filters ) , and radiation from luminescent emission . in the simplest case monochromatic radiation can be either coherent or incoherent , and in both circumstances it is composed of waves with the same wavelength . in the second formulation of ice , a non - equilibrium gas , or more generally a surrounding fluid or solid medium , of particles is described by its distribution over momenta and internal degrees of freedom ( e.g. , vibrational and rotational modes of molecules or atomic energy levels ) . a non - equilibrium state of a gas may be generated in a number of ways , including through a sudden change in its thermodynamic parameters .",
    "for example , if a lower energy level of a molecule relaxes to equilibrium faster than an upper level , then a sudden temperature drop can create a non - equilibrium state with population inversion",
    ". a non - equilibrium particle momentum distribution can be created using selective excitation of the internal degrees of freedom by a laser with subsequent collisional transfer of the excitations into momentum modes .",
    "lasers can have dual roles in this general circumstance of ( a ) directly addressing the system hamiltonian for control as well as ( b ) first addressing the environment for its subsequent controlled manipulation of the system .",
    "the main impediments to designing coherent optimal control fields are the required detailed knowledge of the system hamiltonian and the need to solve the generally high dimensional schrdinger equation .",
    "the difficulties in handling these two issues inevitably lead to significant errors in the field designs which would likely result in ineffective control in laboratory experiments . to overcome these difficulties optimal learning control in the laboratory is proving to be very successful  @xcite . in this fashion",
    "the system subjected to control is used as an analog computer which solves its own schrdinger equation exactly in real time and with the true laser field and system hamiltonian .",
    "the capabilities of high duty cycle laser pulse shaping along with fast observation of the controlled outcome allows for efficient pattern recognition algorithms ( e.g. , genetic algorithms  @xcite ) to guide a sequence of experiments to home in on the specified system control objective .",
    "the same logic is proposed for ice to find an optimal non - equilibrium environment as a control , either alone or possibly in conjunction with determining a coherent control field .",
    "this paper considers the following control problem : for a given target state of the system @xmath7 , find a distribution function of the environment @xmath2 such that the corresponding induced non - unitary system dynamics is steered from some initial state @xmath8 as close as possible to the state @xmath7 .",
    "the corresponding objective function can be chosen as @xmath9=[\\sum_{nm}(\\rho_{nm}-\\rho_{nm}^{\\rm t})^2]^{1/2}$ ] , where @xmath10 is an element of the density matrix @xmath11 at some final time @xmath12 evolved from @xmath8 under the action of the environment with distribution function @xmath2 .",
    "the problem of creating an effective control based on significant environmental interactions generally requires an adaptive learning control procedure . the advantage of learning control lies in its ability to find an optimal distribution @xmath2 even if the details of the system , environment and their interactions are not known . in the laboratory ,",
    "practical feedback signals would be of the form @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is an observable operator , and the goal would be to steer @xmath13 towards the desired value @xmath15 . in the more general case , expectation values of several possibly noncommutative observable operators @xmath16",
    "could be used for feedback , and the goal would be to steer the expectation value of each @xmath16 towards its desired value .",
    "other observable properties of the system , the environment , or the means of generating its non - equilibrium state also can be incorporated into the objective function .",
    "learning control driven by a ga is employed in the present paper in simulations of the potential effectiveness of ice using either incoherent radiation or a gas as controls . in these cases",
    "there is a markovian regime ( i.e. , weak coupling and low density ) for the reduced dynamics of the controlled system  @xcite .",
    "master equations with appropriate dissipative terms are reasonable models in this regime . these equations are used here to simulate evolution of the system s density matrix towards the target under the influence of a non - equilibrium environment .",
    "the general ice concept is not limited to the models used here , and in the laboratory fully non - markovian dynamics naturally would be included as required .",
    "an environment prepared impulsively in a non - equilibrium state will evolve to equilibrium . in the simulations below we consider control by stationary non - equilibrium environments . in practice",
    "this requires keeping the environment in a non - equilibrium state for a time which is sufficiently long to perform the control . in the simulations",
    "the master equations will be followed temporally until a steady state is reached for the control outcome .",
    "a stationary non - equilibrium state for incoherent radiation can easily be maintained using steady sources .",
    "in addition , a non - equilibrium state of a stationary gas can be maintained by controlling the gas with a suitable external field .",
    "an example of such control is preparation of population inversion in the he  ne gas - discharge laser . in this case",
    "we may consider the gas of he atoms as the control environment and the ne atoms as the controlled system .",
    "an electric discharge is passed through the he  ne gas to bring the he atoms into a non - equilibrium state .",
    "then he  ne collisions transfer the energy of the non - equilibrium state of the he atoms into the high energy levels of the ne atoms .",
    "this process creates a population inversion in the ne atoms and subsequent lasing .",
    "a steady electric discharge can be used to keep the gas of helium atoms in a non - equilibrium state to produce a cw he  ne laser . in the present simulations the actual nature of the external control creating the non - equilibrium steady distribution @xmath17 will not be explicitly described . rather in keeping with exploring the ice concept ,",
    "@xmath17 will be treated directly as the control for optimization as a function of @xmath0 . in the laboratory",
    "the external control settings would be guided by the learning algorithm using the system observations as a feedback signal .",
    "control by several lasers with incoherent relative phases was considered in  @xcite . in this approach the interference between different channels",
    "is manipulated by changing the relative frequencies and intensities of the lasers .",
    "although the relative phases between the lasers are incoherent , each of the lasers is a source of coherent radiation which affects the system through induced hamiltonian dynamics .",
    "the present paper , in its part devoted to control by radiation , uses as the control totally incoherent radiation which affects the system through induced dissipative evolution .",
    "there is a relation between ice and recently proposed measurement - assisted  @xcite and dual material - photonic reagent control  @xcite . in all these situations control",
    "is implemented , at least partially , through induced dissipative dynamics .",
    "the ice proposal directly exploits the influence of an optimally shaped environmental distribution function upon the dynamics of the controlled system .",
    "measurement - assisted control exploits the back action of decoherence induced by measurements .",
    "material - photonic reagent control utilizes dynamics driven by a laser as well as identification of an optimal material for the system and/or the environment .",
    "all these approaches to molecular or condensed phase system manipulation can be considered as different branches of the general perspective of introducing control through same aspects of dissipative dynamics .",
    "sections  ii and  iii present simple illustrations of ice using incoherent radiation and a gaseous medium , respectively .",
    "the formulations will be developed in the general context of a coherent field being present for directly addressing the system along with a time - dependent environmental control distribution function @xmath18 .",
    "the test simulations will be performed with steady distributions and without a coherent control field to serve as a simple demonstration of the basic closed - loop ice concept .",

    "brief concluding remarks are given in section  iv .",
    "this section considers control by non - equilibrium incoherent radiation described by a distribution @xmath17 of the photon momenta . in general , the polarization dependence of the incoherent radiation also can be exploited as an additional control along with the propagation direction in cases where spatial anisotropy is important ( e.g. , a system consisting of oriented molecules bound to a surface ) .    the thermal ( i.e. , equilibrium )",
