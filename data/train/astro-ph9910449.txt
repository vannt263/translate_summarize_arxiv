    "@xmath7 is a dimensionless number of the order of @xmath8 and represents the power law exponent of the distribution function of line strengths of the thousands of spectral lines driving the wind .",
    "( for a simplified derivation of eq.[wlreq ] , see kudritzki @xcite , or kudritzki @xcite ) .",
    "analyzing h@xmath9 line profiles of o - stars in the galaxy and in the magellanic clouds puls et al .",
    "( @xcite ) were able to demonstrate that such a relationship does indeed exist for the most luminous o - stars ranging over 1 dex in stellar luminosity .",
    "in addition , kudritzki _ et al . _",
    "( @xcite ) found that central stars of planetary nebulae being equally hot or hotter than o - stars but two orders of magnitudes less luminous show wind momenta corresponding to the relationship for o - stars extrapolated towards lower luminosities .",
    "the existence of such a relationship introduces a variety of new and interesting aspects .",
    "first of all , if reliably calibrated , it can be used to determine distances by purely spectroscopic means with mass - loss rates and terminal velocities obtained directly from line profiles yielding absolute stellar luminosities .",
    "second , together with the well known proportionality of v@xmath10 to the escape velocity v@xmath11 from the stellar surface ( abbott @xcite ) it provides a simple way to predict stellar wind energy and momentum input into the interstellar medium from clusters and associations of hot stars .",
    "third , it may be used to estimate mass - loss rates , wind energies and momentum along sequences of stellar evolutionary tracks ( for a more detailed discussion of these aspects , see kudritzki @xcite ) .    with this in mind",
    ", we have started to investigate whether the winds of luminous blue supergiants of spectral types later than o also follow a relationship as described by eq.[wlreq ] . from the viewpoint of theory",
    "this is clearly to be expected , although it is very likely that the proportionality constant and the exponent @xmath7 will be different , since the winds of a- and b - supergiants are driven by lines of different ionization stages .",
    "however , our hope is that a similarily tight relationship may exist .",
    "this would allow to extend the simple description of stellar wind strengths towards later stages of stellar evolution .",
    "even more important , it would render the possibility to use the optically brightest `` normal '' stars , super- and hypergiants of spectral type a and b , as new primary extragalactic distances indicators for galaxies far beyond the local group . in a first pragmatic step , kudritzki et al .",
    "( @xcite ) used mass - loss rates obtained by barlow & cohen ( @xcite ) from ir - photometry and first estimates of terminal velocities to find indeed an indication for such a relationship at later spectral types .    in this paper , we present the first results of our spectroscopic attempt to establish the wind momentum ",
    "luminosity relationship ( wlr ) of galactic supergiants of spectral type a and b. we concentrate on a small number of objects with reasonably well determined distances .",
    "optical spectra are used to obtain the stellar parameters of @xmath12 .",
    "then , h@xmath9 - line profiles are analyzed in detail to determine the stellar wind properties , in particular the mass - loss rates .",
    "together with terminal velocities measured from from uv - resonance lines and h@xmath9 ( for a - supergiants ) this yields stellar wind momenta as function of the stellar luminosities .",
    "the determination of stellar wind parameters from the balmer lines of blue supergiants requires the sophisticated effort of using nlte unified model atmospheres with stellar winds and spherical extension , as originally introduced by gabler et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "these new types of model atmospheres provide a smooth transition from the subsonic , quasi - hydrostatic photosphere to the supersonic stellar wind and allow to deal simultaneously with wind contaminated absorption lines like h@xmath13 and pronounced stellar wind emission lines such as h@xmath9 .",
    "they are also essential for stars with weak winds , when h@xmath9 turns into an almost photospheric absorption line , a situation impossible to deal with quantitatively by treating photosphere and wind as separated entities . for our work",
    ", we use the new unified model code developed recently by santolaya - rey et al .",
    "( @xcite , hereafter sph ) .",
    "this new code is extremely fast and produces a unified model in few minutes on a work station , which is crucial for a project aiming at the analysis of many stars with different stellar parameters and different wind properties .",
    "in addition , it has the advantage of being numerically stable over the entire domain of o- , b- and a - stars in the hrd , independent of the adopted stellar wind strengths .",
    "the code can deal with extreme emission lines produced by very strong winds as well as with an entire absorption spectrum for extremely weak winds . in these latter cases it re - produces perfectly the line profile results of plane - parallel , hydrostatic nlte model atmosphere codes .",
    "as sph have shown , this is only possible because the sobolev approximation is avoided and the nlte multilevel radiative transfer is treated in the comoving frame of the stellar wind outflow velocity field . in addition , incoherent electron scattering can be included in the final formal integral to calculate the line profiles .",
    "this is important for low gravity a - supergiants , where _ photospheric _ electron - scattering produces shallow and wide emission wings ( see sph and mccarthy et al .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    ".adopted distance moduli [ cols=\"<,>,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     adopting a wlr of the form    @xmath14    we can determine the coefficients log @xmath15 and x by linear regression ( see fig.[fig : wlrgal1 ] and table[tab : wlrgal1 ] ) .",
    "the reciprocal value of the slope x may be interpreted as the effective exponent @xmath7 describing the depth dependence of the radiative line force . in the theory of line",
    "driven winds @xmath7 can be expressed as the difference of two dimensionless numbers , @xmath16 and @xmath17 , the usual force multiplier parameters of the radiative line force .",
    "@xmath16 corresponds to the power law exponent of the line strengths distribution function controlling the relative contribution of strong and weak lines to the radiatiative acceleration , whereas @xmath17 describes the depth variation induced by ionization changes of the total number of lines contributing ( see abbott @xcite , kudritzki et al .",
    "@xcite , puls et al .",
    "@xcite , kudritzki @xcite , kudritzki _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , puls et al .",
    "@xcite for a more detailed discussion ) .",
    "typical values for o - stars are @xmath16 = 0.7 to 0.6 and @xmath17 = 0.1 to 0.0 .",
    "@xmath18    changes in the slope x of the wlr as function of spectral type are therefore an additional indication that the winds are driven by different sets of ions . from table[tab : wlrgal1 ] ( see also fig.[fig : wlrgal1 ] ) we infer that the wlr is definitely steeper for the spectral types mid b and a than for o - supergiants ( although the value for the a - supergiants is uncertain because of the small number of objects ) .",
    "this is exactly what one expects , if spectral lines of the iron group at lower ionization stages ( iii and ii ) absorb the photon momentum and drive the wind ( puls et al .",
    "the slope of the early b wlr depends on the uncertain distance of the low luminosity object hd 38771 and would become steeper , if the hipparcos parallax is too large because of the effects of the lutz - kelker bias ( see reid @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , the difference to the o - supergiants in table[tab : wlrgal1 ] is very likely not significant .",
    "the variation of height @xmath15 of the wlr is a more complex matter , since this quantity depends on the _ flux weighted _ total number of spectral lines as well as on @xmath7 and @xmath16 itself ( puls _ et al . _",
    "@xcite ) . only in cases of similar slopes",
    "a comparison of @xmath15 gives direct insight into the _ absolute _ number of effectively driving lines , whereas in all other cases their _ distribution _ with respect to line - strength ( @xmath16 ) has a significant influence on the offset .",
    "due to its ( partial ) dependence on flux - weighted line number , @xmath15 varies between spectral types not only because of ionization changes but also because of the different spectral locations of the lines with regard to the flux maximum and absorption edges such as the hydrogen lyman - and balmer - edges . at least with respect to the observed differences in @xmath15 between o - type and a - type supergiants ( accounting for the changes in @xmath7 ) , this interpretation seems to be correct , as demonstrated by puls et al .",
    "however , to predict the variation of @xmath15 over the whole range of effective temperatures and thus to check whether our present interpretation is generally valid will require more detailed calculations of radiation driven wind models in the future .",
    "we feel that especially the pronounced drop in @xmath15 between effective temperatures of 23500  k and 22500  k ( on our temperature scale of unblanketed models ) will provide a challenge for the theory .",
    "a detailed spectroscopic study of a larger sample of objects in this transition range of temperatures to disentagle stellar wind properties in more detail will certainly be extremely valuable .",
    "in addition , a careful re - investigation whether systematic effects ( for instance , deviations of the helium abundances from the normal value or metal line blanketing and blocking in this temperature range ) may have influenced the results of the spectroscopic analysis will be important .",
    "the observed wlr of `` normal '' supergiants of mid b spectral type allows a comparison with more extreme objects of comparable spectral type .",
    "very recently , figer et al .",
    "( @xcite ) have investigated the physical properties of the spectacular `` pistol star '' in the galactic centre . in their detailed spectroscopic study using high quality ir spectra and unified nlte model atmospheres with winds they have found that this object has a luminosity of @xmath19 = 6.6 and is one of the most luminous and - therefore - most massive stars known so far . however , despite of the extreme luminosity the stellar wind of this object is surprisingly weak .",
    "figer et al .",
    "( @xcite ) obtain @xmath20 @xmath21m@xmath22/yr , @xmath23  km / s and @xmath24 for mass - loss rate , terminal velocity and modified wind momentum , respectively .",
    "this is roughly 1.0 dex less than one would expect for an o - star of the same luminosity . ignoring the spectral type dependence of the wlr",
    "one would be tempted to conclude that the pistol star is probably an unresolved multiple system of less luminous objects , although the careful investigation by figer et al .",
    "( @xcite ) does not give any indication in this direction .",
    "however , the effective temperature obtained for this object in their nlte analysis is @xmath25 = 14100 k and it is , therefore , more appropriate to compare with the our new wlr of mid b spectral types .",
    "this is done in fig.[fig : wlrgalpistpcyg ] .",
    "given the uncertainties of the complex analysis of the galactic centre ir - data and the fact that the pistol star is somewhat cooler than b3 ia - supergiants , we conclude from a comparison of wind momenta that this object may indeed be a single object of extreme luminosity but with a `` normal '' stellar wind .",
    "on the other hand , we note from figer et al .",
    "( @xcite ) that the pistol star is located in a `` sparsely populated zone in the hrd beyond the humphreys - davidson - limit where unstable stars of the luminous blue variable type are found '' .",
    "it is quite surprising that such a star exhibits just a normal stellar wind .",
    "this becomes more evident , if we add the proto - type luminous blue variable p cygni to fig.[fig : wlrgalpistpcyg ] .",
    "this object has been studied by lamers et al .",
    "( @xcite ) and najarro et al .",
    "( @xcite ) ( see also pauldrach & puls @xcite , langer et al .",
    "@xcite ) and has an effective temperature of @xmath25 = 18100 k corresponding to our specral types b2 and b3 . with log @xmath26 = 5.75",
    "its luminosity is only slightly higher than the one of hd 41117 the most luminous `` normal '' mid b - supergiant in our sample .",
    "however , with @xmath27 @xmath28m@xmath22/yr , @xmath29  km / s and @xmath30 the wind momentum of p cygni is 1.2 dex larger than expected from our regression relation for this spectral type .",
    "the explanation for this behaviour has already been worked out by lamers et al .",
    "( @xcite ) in their discussion of the `` bi - stability of b - supergiant winds '' .",
    "p cygni is very likely an object that has undergone substantial mass - loss in its evolutionary history and is therefore rather close to the eddington limit ( see langer et al .",
    "it is definitely helium enriched and the rather small terminal velocity leads to the conclusion that the gravity ( and therefore the mass ) must be very small .",
    "langer et al .",
    "( @xcite ) estimate @xmath31 = 2.0 from their wind models which are also able to reproduce the observed high wind momentum .",
    "our `` normal '' objects have significantly higher gravities and are more distant from the eddington limit . however , as pauldrach & puls ( @xcite ) and lamers & pauldrach ( @xcite ) have shown for the temperature range of b1.5 to b3 supergiants , the distance to the eddington limit  below a critical threshold  is crucial for the strengths of stellar winds .",
    "closer to the eddinton limit the radiation driven wind becomes slower and denser which increases the stellar wind optical thickness in the lyman continuum and  in the temperature range between b1.5 and b3 spectral types  suddenly affects the ionization of iron group elements , which can lead to a strong increase of stellar wind momentum .",
    "we therefore assume that the difference in gravity ( or stellar mass ) is the reason for the difference between the `` normal '' supergiants and the extreme object p cygni . in this sense",
    ", the pistol star must either be a `` normal '' object sufficiently away from the eddington limit or the reduced flux in the lyman continuum at @xmath25 = 14000 k ( relative to 22000 to 18000 k ) leads to a more moderate stellar wind .",
    "of course , this whole scenario will have to be confirmed by a comprehensive calculation of stellar wind models in the appropriate range of stellar parameters .",
    "it has long been a dream of stellar astronomers to use the most luminous blue stars as individuals to determine the distances to other galaxies .",
    "evidently , the existence of the wlr provides a unique opportunity to obtain information about absolute magnitudes from a purely spectroscopic analysis of the stellar wind lines . to illustrate the situation we show the modified wind momenta of our a - supergiants as function of absolute visual magnitude in fig.[fig : gaia2 ] .",
    "we have included the two a - supergiants in m31 studied recently by mccarthy et al .",
    "( @xcite ) in their analysis of keck hires spectra .",
    "the diagram is exciting for several reasons .",
    "it demonstrates that the galactic objects agree well with objects in another galaxy to form a nice wlr with only a small scatter around the mean relationship ( the fact that the use of absolute magnitude on the abscissa instead of luminosity leads to a similarily well defined relationship reflects only that the bolometric corrections are small ) .",
    "in addition , the relationship holds to absolute magnitudes up to m@xmath32 , i.e. , objects of tremendous intrinsic brightness easily to detect and to investigate spectroscopically in distant galaxies .    however , for the use of the wlr as a distance indicator fig.[fig : gaia2 ] is somewhat misleading , since the determination of a mass - loss rate from an h@xmath9 profile requires already the a priori assumption about the stellar radius and therefore the distance . changing the distance @xmath33 or the distance modulus @xmath34 of an object in fig.[fig : gaia2 ] by    @xmath35    @xmath36    results in in a shift of the ordinate by    @xmath37    since one can show analytically ( puls et al .",
    "@xcite ) that the quantity    @xmath38    is an invariant of the profile fitting process , i.e. the strength of h@xmath9 as a stellar wind line scales exactly with this quantity . for instance , assuming a larger distance ( and therefore radius ) for an observed object one would have to increase @xmath4 so that @xmath39 remains constant to obtain a similar fit of the h@xmath9 profile .",
    "the above equations allow to use the scatter around the regression curve of fig.[fig : gaia2 ] for an estimate of the accuracy in distance modulus @xmath34 which can be obtained . with the regression fit    @xmath40    ( @xmath41 ) we can calculate residuals @xmath42 from the regression for each individual object @xmath43    @xmath44    a change in distance modulus of ( see eq .",
    "( 7),(8),(11 ) )    @xmath45    would shift each object @xmath43 exactly on the regression .",
    "hence , these values of @xmath46 can used as an estimate of the accuracy in distance modulus ( see fig.[fig : sigmaa ] ) . the standard deviation obtained from these",
    "residua is @xmath47 = 0@xmath4830 .",
    "we can apply a similar procedure for the mid b - supergiants .",
    "since bolometric corrections are larger than for a - supergiants , we use the original wlr with @xmath19 on the abscissa and ( @xmath49 , @xmath50 )    @xmath51    @xmath52    @xmath53    the corresponding residua @xmath46 are shown in fig.[fig : sigmab ] .",
    "the standard deviation is @xmath54 = 0@xmath4837 .",
    "this confirms the estimate by mccarthy et al .",
    "( @xcite ) that with ten to twenty objects per galaxy , distance moduli as accurate as 0@xmath481 should be achievable .",
    "the idea is to carry out multi - object spectroscopy with 8m - class telescopes combined with hst photometry to obtain stellar parameters ( @xmath25 , @xmath31 , abundances ) and reddening in a first step",
    ". then determination of @xmath39 from h@xmath9 ( for a - supergiants one would also obtain @xmath5 from h@xmath9 ) and the application of a properly calibrated wlr would yield the absolute magnitude .",
    "comparison with the de - reddened apparent magnitude would , finally , allow to determine the distance .",
    "the uncertainties in wlr distance moduli appear to be comparable to those obtainable from cepheids in galaxies .",
    "the advantage of the wlr - method , however , is that individual reddening ( and therefore extinction ) as well as metallicity ( see discussion below ) can be derived directly from the spectrum of every object .",
    "moreover , it is a new independent primary method for distance determination and can contribute to the investigation of systematic errors of extragalactic distances .",
    "however , the crucial question is out to which distances will the method be applicable .",
    "the best spectroscopic targets at large distances are certainly a - supergiants such as shown in fig.[fig : gaia2 ] .",
    "since massive stars evolve at almost constant luminosity towards the red , a - supergiants are the optically brightest `` normal '' stellar objects because of the effects of wien s law on the bolometric correction .",
    "in addition , we can determine the wind momenta of these objects solely by optical spectroscopy at h@xmath9 ( without need of the uv ) .",
    "this means that we can use ground - based telescopes of the 8 m class for spectroscopy rather than the `` tiny '' hst ( which is then needed for accurate photometry only ) .    from fig.[fig :",
    "gaia2 ] we see that the brightest a - supergiants have absolute magnitudes between -9@xmath55 and -8@xmath55 .",
    "such objects would be of apparent magnitude between @xmath56 and @xmath57 in galaxies @xmath58mpc away , certainly not a problem for medium ( @xmath59 ) resolution spectroscopy with @xmath60 m class telescopes . even in a galaxy like m100 at a distance of @xmath61mpc ( freedman et al .",
    "@xcite ; ferrarese et al .",
    "@xcite ) these objects would still be accessible at magnitudes around @xmath62 and would yield wind momentum distances . indeed , the hst colour magnitude diagram published by freedman et al .",
    "( @xcite ) may show the presence of such objects in m100 .",
    "one might ask , of course , whether a medium resolution of @xmath59  would still allow a sufficiently accurate determination of effective temperature , surface gravity , abundances , and wind momentum .",
    "we note that the rotational velocities of a - supergiants are typically on the order of @xmath63kms@xmath64 , a broadening which is matched by a spectral resolution of roughly @xmath65  at h@xmath66 .",
    "therefore we expect that the medium resolution situation will not be dramatically worse , provided sufficient s / n can be achieved and accurate sky- , galaxy- , and hii region background subtraction can be performed at very faint magnitudes .",
    "experiments with observed spectra degraded with regard to s / n , resolution and sky emission indicate that such observations are challenging but feasible .",
    "in summary of the previous sections it is certainly fair to conclude that the concept of the spectral dependend wlr appears to be an excellent tool to discuss the strengths of stellar winds and to use the most luminous `` normal '' blue supergiants as extragalactic distance indicators . however , it became also clear that what has been presented here can only be regarded as a first step .",
    "investigations in many directions will be neccessary to establish the wlr - concept reliably . in the following",
    "we discuss the most important next steps .",
    "so far the galactic wlr - calibration is based only on a small number of objects with reliable distances per spectral type group .",
    "the numbers are particularily small for early b - supergiants and a - supergiants . in the near future before the next astrometric space projects become reality , the only possibility to improve the situation is the careful re - investigation of existing catalogues with regard to cluster and association membership and improved reddening corrections . in addition",
    ", one might use the progress obtained with alternative distance indicators such as eclipsing binaries ( clausen @xcite ) , cepheids using the ir - baade - wesselink - method ( gieren @xcite ) etc . to use local group galaxies like m31 and m33 as additional calibrators .",
    "it is well known that h@xmath9-profiles of a- and b - supergiants vary as a function of time ( see , for instance , kaufer et al .",
    "this does , of course , mean that wind momenta derived in the way as described above will also vary and , therefore , affect the wlr .",
    "very recently , kudritzki ( @xcite ) has discussed the problem for the case of the a - supergiant hd 92207 and found that the uncertainty in wind momentum introduced by the spectral variability of this object is smaller than 0.15 dex .",
    "he concluded that part of the intrinsic scatter of the wlr might be caused by variability but that the concept of the wlr is not affected by uncertainties of this magnitude , in particular , if many objects are investigated per galaxy .",
    "however , so far this conclusion is based on the investigation of one object only .",
    "many others studies will have to be carried out as function of spectral type and luminosity class to confirm or to disprove this conclusion .",
    "since the winds of blue supergiants are driven by absorption of photon momentum through metal lines , stellar wind momenta must depend on metallicity in a sense that wind momenta become weaker with decreasing metallicity . for normal o - stars",
    ", this metallicity dependence has been discussed carefully by abbott ( @xcite ) , kudritzki et al .",
    "@xcite , puls et al .",
    "( @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "observations of o - stars in the magellanic clouds with hst have led to a general confirmation of the theory ( see puls et al .",
    "however , for supergiants of spectral type a and mid b only little work has been done so far . observing two a - supergiants in m33 with keck and hires and making use of the strong metallicity gradient in this galaxy , mccarthy _ et al . _",
    "( @xcite ) were able to demonstrate that drastic metallicity effects are encountered , if the metallicity drops below the smc value .",
    "in addition , a few b - supergiants have been studied in the magellanic clouds ( kudritzki @xcite ) . however , a systematic survey in the magellanic clouds , ngc 6822 , m31 and m33 is now under way by the authors of this paper and their collaborators to close this gap and to provide an empirical calibration of wlr metallicity dependence . in addition , theoretical work will be carried out for these spectral types as well .",
    "this is the final goal of the project . as discussed above , quantitative spectroscopy of blue supergiants beyond the local group to determine the strengths of stellar winds and wind momenta is feasible with 8m - class telescopes and medium resolution spectrographs .",
    "whether or not this will lead to a new , independent determination of extragalactic distances is open until the prove is made by the appropriate analysis of the first set of spectroscopic multi - object observations in a galaxy clearly beyond the local group .",
    "these observations will become available soon .",
