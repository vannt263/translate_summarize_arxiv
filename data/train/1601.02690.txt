    "laboratory measurements of very weak atomic transitions that violate the usual parity selection rules are a means of determining the weak force at low collision energies  @xcite .",
    "the component of this electric dipole transition moment @xmath0 that is induced by the weak - force coupling between nucleons has become of great interest in recent years  @xcite . these nuclear spin dependent ( nsd ) contributions to @xmath0 are expected to result from the nuclear anapole moment of the nucleus , with additional smaller contributions from the weak neutral axial - vector nucleon vector electron ( @xmath1,@xmath2 ) current , and the combined effect of the hyperfine interaction and the ( @xmath3,@xmath4 ) current  @xcite . to date , the only non - zero determination of nsd contributions to @xmath0 in _ any _ element was based upon the difference between measurements of @xmath5 in atomic cesium  @xcite , where @xmath6 is the vector polarizability for the transition , on two different hyperfine components of the @xmath7 transition ; the @xmath8 and the @xmath9 lines .",
    "@xmath5 on these lines differed by @xmath105% of their average value .",
    "this nsd factor was much larger than was expected , and theoretical efforts  @xcite to understand this result have not been successful .",
    "meson exchange coupling constants of the so - called ddh model  @xcite derived from this result do not agree well with results derived from measurements of the asymmetry in the high - energy scattering of light nuclei  @xcite . while the applicability of the ddh model to such a large atom is questionable",
    ", there is none - the - less strong interest in understanding the nsd of large nuclei , as evidenced by the many efforts underway worldwide in a variety of systems .",
    "laboratory efforts have sought , or are currently underway , to determine the anapole moment of other nuclei , including tl  @xcite , yb  @xcite , fr  @xcite , ba@xmath11  @xcite , ra@xmath11  @xcite , and yb@xmath11  @xcite , and several molecular systems as well  @xcite . differences between @xmath0 on various hyperfine lines for these systems could reveal the nuclear anapole moment of these systems . comparison between different isotopes of the same species could remove the dependence of the determination on precise atomic theory , subject to the ability to correct for variations in the nuclear structure among the isotopes  @xcite .",
    "measurements performed on a hyperfine transition between components of an atomic ground state present an attractive alternative to the above schemes for determining the nsd contributions to @xmath0 .",
    "this moment contains only the nsd contribution , simplifying the measurement , and in many cases , the value of @xmath0 on ground state transitions is predicted to be larger than the weak amplitude between different electronic states  @xcite . of particular interest is a large program on francium  @xcite , one goal of which is to measure @xmath0 on transitions between hyperfine levels of the ground state of this unstable heavy element at triumf . to carry out these measurements , development of techniques for cooling and trapping these species in a magneto - optical trap ( mot ) and carrying out the measurements in this restricted space",

    "atomic cesium offers several benefits over the francium system that are derived from an atomic beam geometry : that is , a greater atomic density , the capability of sequential preparation , interaction , and detection , and a less restrictive experimental environment .",
    "furthermore , the beam geometry allow us to spatially separate the interaction regions for the different coherent fields , and to highly suppress the magnetic dipole contributions to the atomic signal , a primary challenge in ground - state measurements of weak signals . in this work , we discuss how the two - pathway interference method can be used to determine the ratio of the pnc amplitude to the stark vector polarizability @xmath6 .",
    "while our primary interest is in atomic cesium , the technique is generally applicable in any of the stable alkali metal species .",
    "we describe in detail the measurement requirements , and the capability of our technique .",
    "the optimal arrangement uses r.f .  and static electric fields that are oriented in perpendicular directions , and the r.f .",
    "field should be confined to a space within which the static field is uniform .",
    "these requirements can be satisfied by a parallel plate transmission line ( pptl ) configuration to which cylindrical reflectors ( to form an r.f .",
    "resonant cavity ) and isolated conducting pads ( for application of the orthogonal d.c .",
    "field ) have been added .",

    "we have analyzed this reduction of signal by numerically averaging @xmath333 over the velocity distribution shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : vel_dist_at_beam ] , and find that this reduction is @xmath1023% . since the stark and pnc amplitudes are affected in the same way , the only effect is a reduction of the signal magnitude ; it does not otherwise affect the accuracy of the measurement .",
    "the distribution of atomic velocities also reduces the signal through the variation in the flight time of atoms from the interaction region to the detection region in the measurement apparatus .",
    "this effect is much less significant in our apparatus , for the parameters of our measurement . in our system , this distance from the interaction region to the detection region is @xmath1013 cm , so the average time required to reach the detection region is only 0.5 ms . due to the width of the velocity distribution ,",
    "the spread in arrival times is @xmath334 ms .",
    "this satisfies the requirement that this @xmath335 is much smaller than the inverse of the modulation frequency modulation of the signal , which in our previous measurements was 150 hz , and the loss of signal is a few percent . once again",
    ", this loss only affects the signal size , but does not affect the accuracy of the measurement .",
    "finally , we examine the effect of the gaussian intensity distribution of the laser beams that drive the raman transition in the atoms .",
    "since for an optimized measurement , the interaction angle @xmath88 is adjusted to a value of @xmath336 , if we set the raman beam amplitudes to this value on the axis , the angle for any off - axis atoms is less , decreasing our signal . to ensure that all atoms experience the same field amplitude to within 10% of the peak value , an atom beam diameter of 1 mm requires a beam radius of the raman beam of 7 mm .",
    "( this dimension is consistent with the value of @xmath121 that we used in our simulation shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cevstime ] , since the raman interaction scales as the product of the laser field amplitudes @xmath77 and @xmath78 . )",
    "in this paper , we have reported our design of an experimental configuration for the measurement of the weak - force induced transition moment on the ground - state hyperfine transition of atomic cesium , or any of the alkali metal species , in an atomic beam configuration .",
    "we have introduced an r.f .",
    "resonant cavity based upon a parallel - plate transmission line structure that allows one to generate the very uniform , well - characterized , high - amplitude r.f .  and static fields required for this measurement .",
    "this cavity design could be applied to any measurement that requires similar levels of controlled fields .",
    "we have carried out detailed numerical simulations of the various field amplitudes of the standing wave , and used these results to estimate the magnitude of the magnetic dipole contributions to the atomic signal .",
    "the atomic beam geometry is especially well - suited to these purposes , allowing suppression of all magnetic dipole contributions , and we estimate that a precision measurement of @xmath0 on the ground state hyperfine transition can be achieved within an integration time of a few tens of seconds .",
