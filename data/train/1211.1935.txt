    "momentum tensor for the field in a dielectric has been at the center of the century - long abraham - minkowski momentum controversy @xcite .",
    "the tensor that was proposed by minkowski @xcite in 1908 is not symmetric and consequently does not conserve angular momentum @xcite .",
    "abraham @xcite subsequently proposed a symmetric tensor at the expense of a phenomenological force .",
    "the original point of contention of the abraham  minkowski momentum controversy was whether the abraham momentum density @xmath1 or the minkowski momentum density @xmath2 provides the correct description of the momentum of light in a linear medium .",
    "the absence of an experimental decision allowed the debate to persist until the 1960s , when resolution of the abraham  minkowski dilemma was provided by penfield and haus @xcite , based on earlier work by mller @xcite , who showed that the issue is undecidable because neither the spatial integral of the abraham momentum density nor the spatial integral of the minkowski momentum density is the total momentum of the closed system .",
    "likewise , the total energy  momentum tensor of the closed system is not the abraham energy  momentum tensor and it is not the minkowski energy  momentum tensor .    what , then , is the total momentum and the total energy ",
    "momentum tensor ? here",
    ", we adopt the definition of the total momentum as the momentum quantity that is conserved in a thermodynamically closed system .",
    "this approach has the advantage of obtaining the total momentum directly from global conservation principles and neatly avoids any issues regarding the ill - defined roles of the abraham and minkowski momentums .",
    "we construct a thermodynamically closed system consisting of a homogeneous dielectric block illuminated by a quasimonochromatic field at normal incidence through an antireflection - coating . in this closed system ,",
    "the total energy and total momentum are conserved quantities and are well - defined by virtue of being conserved .",
    "we find that the total energy is the spatial integral of the electromagnetic energy density @xmath3 and that the total momentum is the spatial integral of the gordon @xcite momentum density @xmath4 the four - momentum density is therefore @xmath5 .",
    "we then show that the elements of the first row of the energy ",
    "momentum tensor can be chosen to be energy and momentum densities that satisfy the requirement for conservation of the components of the four - momentum . by doing so , the four - divergence of the energy ",
    "momentum tensor produces an energy continuity equation that is incompatible with poynting s theorem . retaining the conservation properties of the total energy ",
    "momentum tensor , we derive new electromagnetic continuity equations .",
    "we define a material four - divergence operator in which the temporal differentiation is performed with respect to @xmath0 and obtain a traceless symmetric energy  momentum tensor . the first - row and first - column components of the tensor are the densities of conserved energy and momentum quantities and the material four - divergence of the tensor generates the new electromagnetic continuity equations in terms of the electromagnetic energy density and the gordon total momentum density .",
    "the first step toward obtaining the total energy and total momentum is to define a thermodynamically closed free - body system .",
    "we consider a stationary dielectric block illuminated at normal incidence from vacuum by a plane quasimonochromatic field .",
    "the dielectric has a gradient - index antireflection coating that allows radiation pressure on the vacuum / dielectric interface to be neglected .",
    "then the refractive index @xmath6 for a linear , isotropic , transparent dispersion - negligible dielectric is real and time - independent .",
    "the dielectric is homogeneous and occupies a finite region of 3-dimensional space so spatial variation of the refractive index , @xmath7 , is limited to the transition region of the coating .",
    "the quasimonochromatic electromagnetic field is represented by the vector potential @xmath8 where @xmath9 is a slowly varying function of @xmath10 and @xmath11 , @xmath12 is the center frequency of the field , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 is a unit vector in the direction of propagation .",
    "figure 1 shows the envelope of the incident field @xmath15 about to enter the dielectric through a gradient - index antireflection coating .",
    "figure 2 shows a time - domain numerical solution of the wave equation at a later time when the refracted field @xmath16 is entirely inside the dielectric .",
    "as shown in fig.2 , the amplitude of the refracted field is @xmath17 and the spatial extent of the refracted pulse is @xmath18 in terms of the width @xmath19 of the incident pulse .",
    "it can be shown that this linear result is quite general in terms of the refractive index , as well as the width and amplitude of the field .    for a stationary dielectric ,",
    "the electromagnetic energy is @xmath20 where the integration extends over all space @xmath21 . for the example shown in figs . 1 and 2",
    ", there is no significant field outside the rectangular pulse .",
    "then , the incident energy at @xmath22 , @xmath23 is equal to the refracted energy at @xmath24 , @xmath25 the field has been averaged on a scale that is long compared to an optical period , but short compared to @xmath26 , accounting for a factor of one - half .",
    "it can be demonstrated , in a similar manner , that the electromagnetic energy at any time @xmath27 is equal to the incident energy .",
    "the temporal invariance of the electromagnetic energy makes @xmath28 , eq .",
    "( [ eqq2.02 ] ) , the conserved energy of the closed system .",
    "conservation of the electromagnetic energy is all that is needed to show that the gordon momentum @xmath29 obtained by spatially integrating the gordon momentum density @xcite , eq .",
    "( [ eqq1.04 ] ) , is the total momentum of our closed system . for monochromatic radiation , where @xmath30 , we can write the momentum as @xmath31 in the direction of the propagation unit vector @xmath32 . if the total energy @xmath28 is temporally invariant , and therefore conserved , then so is @xmath33 .",
    "alternately , we can show that the momentum balance @xmath34 is temporally invariant @xcite .",
    "the momentum formula , eq .",
    "( [ eqq2.05 ] ) , was originally derived in 1973 by gordon @xcite .",
    "although there are some issues with gordon s derivation , temporal invariance is decisive .",

    "the energy and momentum continuity equations of a thermodynamically closed system can be combined to form a tensor differential equation and the energy ",
    "momentum tensor is the central element of this formalism . while the energy  momentum tensor formalism is straightforward , it has not been successful in application to classical continuum electrodynamics . now that we have identified the total momentum by global conservation principles @xcite",

    "momentum tensor formulation of classical continuum electrodynamics .",

    "momentum tensor can be chosen such that the four - divergence of the first row is the poynting theorem or they can be chosen to satisfy conservation of the components of the four - momentum , but not both .    in order to fully resolve the abraham ",
