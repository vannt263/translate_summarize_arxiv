    "+ @xmath213 in both non - interacting and interacting two - fluid scenario , it is observed that such de models are also in good harmony with current observations .",
    "thus , the solutions demonstrated in this paper may be useful for better understanding of the characteristic of anisotropic de in the evolution of the universe within the framework of bianchi type - iii space - time .",
    "+ @xmath213 the statefinder pair @xmath204 enable the behaviour of different stages of the evolution of the universe i.e. the universe starts from asymptotic einstein static era ( @xmath214 ) and goes to @xmath3 cdm model ( @xmath211 ) .",
    "+ finally , the solutions presented in this work can be one of the potential candidates to describe the observed universe .",
