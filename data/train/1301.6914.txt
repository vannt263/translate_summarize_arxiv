    "any process in a @xmath35-proton collision is different from the pure deep inelastic scattering process as a result of two distinctive experimental features .",
    "namely , the first feature is the quasireal photons emitted from the proton have a low virtuality and are scattered with small angles from the beam pipe in the framework of epa , and for this reason photon - emitting intact protons get away from the central detector without being detected .",

    "if a lower cut is applied on the transverse momentum of scattered protons emitting photons in a photoproduction process , such a cut helps us to discern a photoproduction process deduced from the usual @xmath29 backgrounds , since the transverse momenta of the scattered protons are typically @xmath77 gev @xcite .",
    "therefore , the transverse momentum of an outgoing proton to be @xmath78 gev within the photon spectrum is applied .    according to these restrictions ,",

    "the background cross section is diminished by 2.1% .",
    "then , the sensitivity of our bounds are spoiled by about a factor of 1.75 . to illustrate , the bounds on @xmath60 and @xmath84 became ( -0.000069,0.000069 ) and ( -0.00013,0.00013 ) for @xmath25=100 fb@xmath26 , respectively . besides , the other source of backgrounds is the instrumental background arising from the calorimeter noise . the calorimeter noise can be prohibited with a suitable cut on the transverse energy of jets ( e.g. @xmath85 40 gev ) .",
    "when comparing these limits with the experimental bounds given in table [ limits ] , we can see that the bounds on @xmath57 in the unitarity violation scheme obtained from atlas , d0 , and cdf are of the same order as our bounds , while the @xmath3 limits are 1 order weaker than our limits .",

    "we have examined the model - independent parametrization of anomalous @xmath0 and @xmath1 vertex couplings @xmath90 and @xmath91 within the effective operator approach via the subprocess @xmath34 of the main reaction @xmath5 at the lhc with a center of mass energy of 14 tev .",
    "the potential of the lhc to probe anomalous @xmath0 and @xmath1 couplings is analyzed via hadronic @xmath7 production at @xmath64=14 tev with the integrated luminosity of 10 and 100 fb@xmath26 @xcite .",
    "the limits obtained via the @xmath92 process in ref.@xcite are @xmath93 and @xmath94 at the lhc with @xmath25=100 ( 10 ) fb@xmath26 .",
    "our results on @xmath91 are of the same order with those of ref.@xcite at @xmath25=100 fb@xmath26 , while the limits on @xmath90 remains one order lower .",
    "however , a photoproduction process at hadron colliders provides a rather clean channel compared to the pure deep inelastic process due to the detection of scattered protons emitting photons by the forward detectors .",
    "furthermore , the obtained results being related to the anomalous @xmath0 and @xmath1 vertex couplings from a photoproduction process are complementary to traditional @xmath29 studies . nevertheless , if we compare the current experimental limits with the results determined from this work , our limits on the couplings @xmath91 with @xmath25=30 @xmath95 are one order better than the experimental limits obtained from lhc and tevatron as given in table [ limits ] , while the @xmath90 couplings are of the same order as the current experimental limits .      99 k.  hagiwara , r.  d.  peccei , d.  zeppenfeld and k.  hikasa , nucl .",
