    "a key goal of next generation ground and space - based telescopes is to detect the objects responsible for reionizing the universe at @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "few such objects have been observed up till now , and hence their detailed physical properties remain poorly constrained . for optimal design and usage of future telescopes and instruments , it is important to understand the nature of these early galaxies .    simulations of galaxy formation can provide insights into the expected properties of these systems within the context of a well - established framework for hierarchical structure formation .",
    "while the properties of dark matter halo assembly are relatively well understood owing to precisely determined cosmological parameters @xcite , the properties of the gas clouds that condense to form observable stars remain subject to a large range of theoretical uncertainty .",
    "it is possible that galaxy formation in the pre - reionization universe proceeds much differently than today or in the recent past , owing to high densities , short cooling times , low metallicities , and a flat power spectrum on mildly nonlinear scales .",
    "furthermore , the process of reionization itself may have large effects on the galaxy population , either in terms of suppressing star formation and stimulating it , as is detailed in various contributions to these proceedings . in short ,",
    "it is possible that our recipes and models for galaxy formation tuned to today s observations may have little relevance at these early epochs .",
    "however , this view is debatable .",
    "it is worth remembering that galaxies that are most likely to be observable in the near future are among the largest and/or most vigorously star forming galaxies at those epochs , and that such galaxies are unlikely to be forming their very first generation of stars .",
    "furthermore , these systems may be relatively unaffected by the global reionization process occuring in the universe at large , because by virtue of their high bias they reside in a portion of the universe that reionizes earlier .",
    "in these proceedings we study the observable and physical properties of reionization epoch galaxies in cosmological hydrodynamic simulations of galaxy and structure formation .",
    "we include a subset of relevant physical processes such as kinetic feedback with accompanying metal injection and metal - line cooling , in addition to the usual processes required for galaxy formation .",
    "these models are known to work reasonably well in predicting the post - reionization galaxy population @xcite , but it remains unclear if they are truly applicable in the pre - reionization universe .",
    "hence this work is preliminary in that it does not include the effects of radiative transfer that may be an important driver for how star formation proceeds in these systems .",
    "we also do not explicitly account for possible variations in the stellar initial mass function due to the presence of low - metallicity stars .",
    "nevertheless , we will show that the objects that are likely to be actually observable at these epochs tend to be the ones for which such reionization epoch processes are expected to be comparatively less relevant .",
    "we employ the parallel n - body+sph code gadget-2 @xcite in this study .",
    "this code uses an entropy - conservative formulation of smoothed particle hydrodynamics along with a tree - particle - mesh code for handling gravity .",
    "it includes the effects of radiative cooling assuming ionization equilibrium , which we have extended to include metal - line cooling based on sutherland & dopita @xcite .",
    "the metal cooling function is interpolated to the gas metallicity as tracked self - consistently by gadget-2 .",
    "stars are formed using a recipe that reproduces the kennicutt relation @xcite , using a subgrid multi - phase model that tracks condensation and evaporation in the interstellar medium following @xcite .",
    "stars inherit the metallicity of the parent gas particle , and from then on can not be further enriched .",
    "gadget-2 has an observationally - motivated prescription for driving superwinds out of star forming galaxies , which is tuned to produce agreement with the global star formation history of the universe @xcite . in @xcite",
    "we describe modifications on this scheme designed to better match certain observations ; in this work , we will only employ two superwind schemes : a  constant wind \" model where all the particles entering into superwinds are expelled at 484  km / s out of star forming regions and a constant mass loading factor of 2 is assumed @xcite , and a  momentum wind \" model where the imparted velocity is proportional to the local velocity dispersion ( computed from the potential ) and the mass loading factor is inversely proportional to the velocity dispersion , as expected in momentum - driven wind scenarios @xcite .",
    "using larger simulations evolved to low redshift , we have verified that both models broadly reproduce the star formation history of the universe .",
    "these two models are meant to illustrate the sensitivity of our results to the somewhat ad hoc feedback prescription .",
    "gadget-2 implements heating due to a photoionizing background , taken from the 2001 cuba model @xcite which assumes a 10% escape fraction of ionizing radiation from galaxies in addition to the contribution from observed quasars , and results in reionization occurring at @xmath6 .",
    "spatial uniformity is assumed , which is obviously incorrect in detail during reionization , but may nevertheless be a passable approximation if the galaxies of interest reionize their surroundings earlier and their masses are significantly above that which would be suppressed by photoionization .",
    "our two simulations with different superwind models each have a comoving volume of @xmath7 , with an equivalent plummer softening of @xmath8 ( i.e. better than 100  pc physical at @xmath5 ) .",
    "a wmap - concordant cosmology is assumed , with @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 .",
    "these models were run with @xmath14 dark matter and @xmath14 gas particles , from @xmath15 to @xmath4 .",
    "the mass resolution is @xmath16 for gas particles and @xmath17 for dark matter .",
    "given the canonical value of 64 particles for robust identification of halos , this means we are resolving halos above @xmath18 , which means that primordial atomic gas should be the dominant coolant in all resolved systems .",
    "note that we do not include h@xmath19 cooling .",
    "we identify galaxies using spline kernel interpolative denmax @xcite , and consider only galaxies with stellar masses exceeding 64 star particles @xcite .",
    "we use bruzual & charlot population synthesis models @xcite to convert the simulated star formation history of each galaxy into broad band colors in a variety of infrared filters , including @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and the spitzer @xmath22 $ ] and @xmath23 $ ] bands ( quoted in ab magnitudes ) .",
    "we have examined other bands as well but all the relevant trends can be gleaned from this set . we account for dust using a prescription based on the galaxy s metallicity and a locally - calibrated metallicity - extinction relation , as described in @xcite .",
    "we also predict ly@xmath3  emission line properties based on the instantaneous star formation rates in each galaxy as output by gadget-2 ; we describe this in more detail later .",
    "here we show some basic physical properties of reionization - epoch galaxies in our simulations .",
    "mass functions at @xmath2 and @xmath4 are shown in the left panels of figure  [ fig : mfcomp ] , for the two superwind models . in either model , a significant number of galaxies with stellar masses exceeding @xmath1 are already in place by @xmath2 , even within our rather small @xmath7 box .",
    "by @xmath4 , there are several galaxies exceeding @xmath24 .",
    "the discovery of a @xmath24 system at @xmath25 by @xcite is therefore not unexpected .",
    "note that the superwind feedback prescription has a significant effect on the stellar mass function , producing nearly half a dex reduction in the mass function for the momentum wind model as compared with the constant wind model .",
    "nevertheless , at the bright end the different wind models converge , as might be expected since the winds will have a smaller effect on larger systems .",
    "there is less of a difference due to winds for the total baryonic mass function ( bottom left panel ) .",
    "metal pollution has a large effect on the reionization epoch , both in terms of the cooling curve that strongly affects the jeans mass in star forming regions ( see e.g. schneider , these proceedings ) , as well as enabling the formation of dust that can strongly affect the detectability of systems , particularly in the ly@xmath3  emission line . in the upper right panel of figure  [ fig : mfcomp ]",
    "we show the gas - phase metallicity of galaxies in the constant ( green crosses ) and momentum ( red circles ) wind models at @xmath2 , and the lower right panel shows metallicities in the momentum wind model at @xmath4 ( green crosses ) and @xmath2 ( red circles ) . in all cases ,",
    "the metallicities of the galaxies exceed about one - thirtieth solar . while small , this is still far above the metallicity purported to enact the transition to a population ii stellar population from a population iii one @xcite .",
    "the stellar metallicities are similar to the gas , typically lower by less than a factor of two .",
    "the feedback mechanism has a significant effect on the metallicity , as might be expected because feedback carries metals out of galaxies .",
    "there is little redshift evolution in the mass - metallicity relation , with the exception of an increase in low - mass metal rich galaxies that have been polluted by the winds from nearby larger systems .",
    "while feedback processes are poorly constrained even at @xmath26 and could therefore operate in a completely different fashion than assumed in our simulations at these epochs , it is nevertheless interesting that massive galaxies at these epoch already have metallicities that approach one - tenth solar or more .",
    "indeed , by @xmath27 these same massive systems grow to have near solar metallicities @xcite , in agreement with observations . hence at face value",
    ", these high redshift systems should already have little if any contribution from population iii stars , and may contain a significant amount of dust depending on the timescale for dust formation .",
    "we now examine some basic observable properties of these high - redshift systems .",
    "we present luminosity functions ( lfs ) of simulated galaxies in the left panels of figure  [ fig : lumfcnz ] .",
    "the top panel shows the @xmath2 lf in various bands , for the momentum wind ( mw ) model .",
    "the bands @xmath28 $ ] correspond approximately to rest - frame 1500to k - band .",
    "as might be expected for these young galaxies , they are quite blue , with the rest - uv being typically one magnitude brighter than rest - k .",
    "the bottom panel shows the lf in the @xmath20 band for our two superwind models at two redshifts : @xmath2 and @xmath4 .",
    "the momentum wind model suppresses low - mass galaxy formation more effectively , and so the majority of the evolution is in the bright end .",
    "the constant wind model , conversely , has a steep faint - end slope due to the comparatively low mass loading factor in small galaxies , and shows mostly luminosity evolution between the two redshifts .",
    "the turnover at faint magnitudes is due to our 64 star particles resolution limit for galaxy stellar masses .    from these lfs",
    "we predict that a future @xmath29 lyman break survey using a @xmath30-dropout technique and selecting down to 30th magnitude in @xmath20 would find @xmath31 galaxies per square arcminute per unit @xmath32 , plus or minus half a dex depending on model assumptions . even down to 29th magnitude",
    "such a survey would find a few of galaxies per square arcminute per @xmath32 .",
    "note that due to our small simulation volume , we are probably underestimating the bright end of the lf , but these values are unlikely to increase by more than a factor of a couple .",
    "these numbers suggest that detecting significant samples of reionization - epoch galaxies using dropout techniques is not too far removed from current technology .    turning to ly@xmath3  emission galaxies",
    ", it may be possible to detect such systems using narrow - band surveys , and indeed such surveys are underway ( see various contributions in these proceedings , including smith , willis , jensen , and stark ) . as discussed in @xcite , there are large uncertainties regarding the detectability of ly@xmath3  emission from star formation . scattering due to the surrounding igm including the damping wing may make ly@xmath3  emission more diffuse and difficult to detect . as we showed in ",
    "[ sec : phys ] , significant metals are expected to be present in the most rapid star formers , so dust extinction may be considerable .",
    "on the other hand , if the initial mass function is more top - heavy in the early universe owing to the lower metallicities , then perhaps ly@xmath3  emission is boosted @xcite .    in figure",
    "[ fig : lumfcnz ] ( right panel ) , we present a comparison of the ly@xmath3  luminosity function to observations compiled by @xcite . their data is best fit by a faint - end slope that is somewhere between @xmath33 and @xmath34 ; those best fits are shown as the dashed lines . to obtain ly@xmath3  luminosity functions , we can convert the instantaneous star formation rate of a galaxy as given by gadget-2 into a ly@xmath3  luminosity using a factor given by the models of @xcite : for 1/20th solar ( typical for our galaxies ) and a salpeter imf , the ly@xmath3  luminosity is @xmath35  erg / s/@xmath36 . of course , not all the ly@xmath3  emitted by young stars will actually reach us ; there is an escape fraction ( defined here as the fraction of ly@xmath3  photons we can observe , not the fraction that escapes from the star forming region or galaxy itself ) that is highly uncertain .",
    "we constrain this escape fraction by comparing our @xmath4 predicted ly@xmath3  luminosity function with the observations shown .",
    "as is evident from figure  [ fig : lumfcnz ] , an escape fraction of 0.5% produces an amplitude that is broadly in agreement with observations .",
    "if we assume that this escape fraction does not evolve with redshift , then the predictions for the @xmath2 luminosity functions are as shown . with this assumption",
    ", there is relatively little evolution predicted from @xmath0 , though the bright end does evolve somewhat .",
    "however , the ly@xmath3  escape fraction may evolve rapidly either up or down with redshift at these epochs @xcite , making these predictions uncertain . as there have been several ly@xmath3  emitters seen at @xmath37",
    ", it seems unlikely that all ly@xmath3  emitters are made undetectable by neutral hydrogen in the igm .",
    "however , beyond this , it is difficult to make concrete statements about the expected observability of ly@xmath3  emitters at @xmath38 .",
    "the results of observational programs such as those described at this meeting as well as dazle @xcite will be critical for constraining models .",
    "we have presented results for the physical and observable properties of reionization epoch galaxies from cosmological hydrodynamic simulations .",
    "our simulations show that high - redshift galaxies can already contain sufficient stellar mass to be in agreement with the available observations ; masses of @xmath1 and above are common by @xmath29 .",
    "the large masses also imply significant metal enrichment in these systems ; while they are far below solar and comparable to the lowest metallicity dwarfs today such as i  zw  18 , their metallicities are still well above the putative threshold for ushering in a more normal imf as compared with an extremely top - heavy imf proposed for population iii stars",
    ". hence it may be unwise to expect significant populations of near metal - free stars in these systems .",
    "these galaxies may be observable using broad - band selection techniques or via their ly@xmath3  emission .",
    "the broad - band properties are probably a more robust prediction of these models , and suggest that surveys down to 30th magnitude ( ab ) in @xmath20 or @xmath39 , or even [ 3.6@xmath40 , would yield a dense sampling of at least tens of objects per square arcminute",
    ". the numbers may be higher by up to @xmath41  dex depending on which of our feedback models turns out to be closer to reality .",
    "predictions of ly@xmath3  emitters are less robust because of large uncertainties in ly@xmath3  transfer out of these systems , but if their properties are similar to ly@xmath3  emitters observed at @xmath42 , then surveys will have to below @xmath43  ergs / s over sizeable areas to achieve a significant sample of objects .",
    "the outlook for detecting these systems is promising .",
    "current nicmos data can achieve depths of 28.5 in near - ir bands @xcite , albeit in small fields .",
    "in addition to jwst , several future space - based telescopes have been proposed that will do large - area near infrared surveys , including some versions of jdem ( joint dark energy mission ) , as well as the proposed galaxy evolution origins probe ( r. thompson , pi ) .",
    "though these missions remain firmly in the distant and uncertain future , the scientific richness of deep wide nir surveys ensures that they are likely to be accomplished at some point . on the ly@xmath3  emitter side , dazle will be the premier instrument for such surveys in the immediate future , but given their sensitivity it would be surprising if they found more than a handful of @xmath38 systems .",
    "narrow band filters in nir night sky windows on future 2030 m class telescopes seems the best option for achieving significant samples of these objects @xcite .",
    "the timescales for such facilities is of the same order as the space - based nir ones , so it will be an interesting race to see which technique matures first .",
