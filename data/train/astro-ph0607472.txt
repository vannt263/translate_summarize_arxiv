    "a generic prediction of cold dark matter ( cdm ) cosmology is the existence of copious sub - structure in gravitationally collapsed structures such as galaxy clusters , galaxy halos and even dwarf galaxies @xcite . on the scale of large spiral galaxies like the milky way and the andromeda galaxy ( m31 ) , upwards of 500 dense dwarf galaxy - mass clumps are expected to orbit in the halo .",
    "these structures have very dense cores , with a very steep radial profile @xcite , which renders them essentially impervious to galactic tides .",
    "however , more than two orders of magnitude fewer luminous dwarf galaxies have so far been found in the local group .",
    "several studies have investigated the effect of reionization on the early evolution of small structures ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "any gas that is not in deep potential wells is lost from the protogalaxies as the first ionizing sources turn on .",
    "this `` squelching '' of star - formation could solve the cdm satellite over - production problem by rendering low - mass galaxies invisible , or at least very dark , depending on the gas fraction that managed to cool to dense molecular form before reionization .",
    "generally , the observed distribution of dwarf satellites can be brought into agreement with cdm if dwarf galaxies reside in large dark matter halos @xcite , but it opens up the possibility that lower mass dwarfs are being missed",
    ".    the recent discoveries of faint dwarf galaxies around both the andromeda galaxy and our own milky way could be the first step in uncovering such satellites .",
    "andromeda  ix ( and  ix , @xcite ) , andromeda  x ( and  x , @xcite ) , ursa major ( uma , @xcite ) , canes venatici ( cvn , @xcite ) and bootes ( boo , @xcite ) are all fainter than @xmath18 but show characteristics typical of dwarf galaxies .",
    "radial velocity measurements show that at least and  ix @xcite , uma @xcite and boo @xcite appear to be highly dark matter dominated and could correspond to the dark matter sub - structures that are found in the cdm models .",
    "the discovery of all these faint dwarf galaxies within wide - field surveys ( the sloan digital sky survey and the int wide field camera survey of the inner halo of m31 ; @xcite and @xcite ) revealed the need to conduct systematic surveys of large regions of the halos of the milky way or the andromeda galaxy in order to properly constrain the low luminosity end of their satellite distribution with adequate statistics .    even though the m31 galaxy is located at @xmath19 @xcite from the sun , surveying the andromeda galaxy halo has the advantage of requiring to map a much smaller area to have a panoramic view of its halo compared to the milky way within which we sit and whose disk and bulge significantly hamper observations at low latitude .",
    "hence we undertook a systematic survey of the outer part of the m31 halo that extends the inner halo survey conducted by our team , which has revealed a flurry of substructures @xcite .",
    "the new survey was conducted with the wide field camera megacam mounted on the canada - france - hawaii telescope and spans the whole southern quadrant of the m31 halo .",
    "covering 57 square degrees , it extends from a projected distance of @xmath20 to @xmath21 at the distance of m31 .    in this paper",
    ", we present the discovery of the three new faint dwarf galaxies that appear in this survey , revealed by an overdensity of stars on the sky that follow red giant branch ( rgb ) tracks at the distance of m31 . the farthest globular cluster in the halo of m31 is also reported .",

    "the camera is mounted on the 3.6 m canada - france - hawaii telescope on mauna kea , ensuring excellent image quality .",
    "each of the 63 fields of the survey was observed in the @xmath24 and @xmath25 bands with an exposure time of 1450s per filter in seeing better than @xmath26 .",
    "this yielded limiting magnitudes of @xmath27 and @xmath28 in the @xmath24 and @xmath25 bands , respectively .",
    "the raw images were pre - processed by the cfht team using the elixir system in order to correct for the instrumental signature across the whole mosaic .",

    "the absence of a clear horizontal branch in the megacam data conspires to prevent a proper determination of the distance ( even though the group of stars at @xmath58 and @xmath59 could represent such a horizontal branch ) .",

    "the megacam dataset can also be used to determine a lower limit on the absolute magnitude of the dwarf from the top three magnitudes of the rgb .",

    "the fit with @xmath104 produces the best results and even though an age of 17.8  gyr is of course improbable , younger isochrones can not reproduce the extent of the horizontal branch , meaning the cluster contains a very old population , as is expected for a globular cluster .    to derive the absolute magnitude of the cluster , we assume most of the luminosity comes from the integrated light in the inner regions .",

    "the half - light radius of the cluster is derived at the same time as @xmath117 which converts to @xmath118 at @xmath3 .",

    "although the globular cluster gc is clearly visible in the megacam images , it is not the case for the three dwarf galaxies so it is natural to wonder if the corresponding overdensities could be only random associations of stars . to test this possibility , we generate @xmath119 square degrees of artificial survey with the photometric characteristics of the 9 megacam fields in the outer regions of the m31 halo where no stream and/or structure is apparent .",
    "these fields have an average density of 3050 stars in the cmd region that corresponds to m31 rgb stars .",

    "figure  [ m31dwarf_fig08 ] shows that the smaller of these two overdensities , and  xii , is expected to be found randomly less than @xmath120 times in a square - degree of the survey .",
    "so even in the whole 57 square - degrees of the megacam survey , only @xmath121 such structures are expected .",
    "moreover , this quick simulation does not take into account the clustering of stars along rgbs which means that randomly finding an and  xii - like structure in the survey is even less probable .",

    "a detailed comparison of these dwarf galaxies with the other m31 satellites is premature and requires deeper observations .",
    "however , a few interesting points can already be discussed here .",
    "firstly , the three dwarfs do not seem to extend the @xmath122 relation that is followed by the andromeda satellites ( figure  [ m31dwarf_fig09 ] , left panel ) .",
    "the lack of other faint m31 satellites as well as the sparse rgb of the new dwarfs and the different techniques used to derive the metallicities of the various dwarfs make it hard to ascertain the extent of this offset or if it is due to a flattening of the relation .",
    "nonetheless , at least for the milky way where the faint boo and cvn dwarfs have recently been found @xcite , fainter dwarfs show more metal - poor populations .",
    "alternatively , if as proposed by @xcite , these objects correspond to `` true fossil '' galaxies for which star formation was mainly suppressed after reionization , their simulations show that such objects are expected to have a wide metallicity spread of about 1.0dex at the luminosity of and  xi ,  xii and  xiii ( a few @xmath123 ) .",
    "this could explain their high metallicity compared to other andromeda satellites they tag as `` true fossils '' ( e.g. and  i ,  ii ,  iii ,  v or  vi ) but deeper observations are required in order to ascertain this classification by comparison with the other parameters they determine in their simulations ( surface brightness , core radius , central luminosity density ) .",
    "a significant difference between the new dwarfs and the other m31 satellites is their small size .",
    "indeed , as can be seen on the right panel of figure  [ m31dwarf_fig09 ] , they are two to three times smaller than the smallest previously - known andromeda dwarfs .",
    "although the values we derive here and recall in table  [ tablesat ] have high uncertainties , these can not account for this difference . a similar difference is observed between andromeda and milky way satellites and has been proposed by @xcite to be due to differences in the formation and/or evolution of the dwarfs .",
    "in particular , @xcite showed that a dwarf galaxy , of mass @xmath124 and on an orbit with semi - major axis @xmath125 , and that lies in the logarithmic potential of its host has a tidal radius @xmath126 that is proportional to @xmath127 where @xmath128 is the mass of the host halo within @xmath125 also depends on the eccentricity of the orbit of the dwarf but this dependency is weak . ] .",
    "even though a precise determination of the tidal radius of the new dwarfs requires deeper observations , the measured @xmath129 can be used as an indicator of the size of the objects . indeed",
    ", dwarf galaxies with a small half - light radius tend to have a small tidal radius ( see e.g. figure  5 of @xcite ) .",
    "if and  xi ,  xii and  xiii have been lying in the m31 halo along with the other andromeda satellites , their projected distance from m31 ( @xmath130 ) makes their semi - major axis at least @xmath131 which is of the order of the semi - major axis of the other m31 dwarfs , implying that the observed difference in @xmath129 would be related to a difference in mass that should be about 10 to 30 times smaller than the other andromeda dwarfs .",
    "while this could be due to their faintness , it has to be noted that measurements of the mass of the faint and  ix @xcite and uma @xcite does not make them much less massive than brighter dwarfs ( @xmath132 ) .",
    "alternatively , the small size of and  xi ,  xii and  xiii could be the telltale sign of different formation and/or evolution compared to the other m31 satellites .",
    "for instance , they could have been brought into the m31 halo as satellites of a recently merged or accreted galaxy .",
    "this scenario is all the more interesting since the new dwarfs all lie within only @xmath2 of one another which could be an indication that they form a linked sub - group .",
    "the presence of a newly found diffuse stellar stream with @xmath9 not far from the three dwarfs in the m31 halo ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) also lends weight to this scenario , although the question of the survival of the dwarfs in such a merger remains open .",
    "the radial velocity of the dwarfs is obviously required to determine if they are linked but their faintness makes them very challenging even for spectrographs on the largest current telescopes .     and @xmath133 . the luminosity function of the rgbs ( the region between the two dashed line ) is also shown on the right with the two arrows corresponding to the two determinations of the trgb .",
    "the megacam magnitudes have been converted to landolt magnitudes using the @xcite color equations . ]",
    "if we assume that the galaxies are indeed linked , they should be at about the same distance . under this assumption",
    "we sum up their cmds and measure the rgb tip .",
    "this is done on figure  [ m31dwarf_fig10 ] where the megacam magnitudes have been converted to landolt magnitudes .",
    "the three rgbs follow strikingly indistinguishable tracks , suggesting that these three dwarfs , apart from their luminosities , are very similar .",
    "the trgb remains approximative but it can be determined to be within @xmath134 and @xmath135 depending on whether the four stars ( 3 and  xi stars and one and  xiii star ) between the two values are considered to belong to the dwarfs or not . assuming @xmath136 as before , this yields a distance of 740 to 955 . in any case",
    ", this puts the dwarfs well within the virial radius of m31 . fitting the @xcite isochrones with the two values derived for the tip yields metallicities of @xmath37 and @xmath36 respectively .",
    "the uncertainty on the distance modulus ( @xmath137 ) will of course add to the uncertainties on the absolute magnitude and half - light radius of the dwarfs but that will not change the general conclusions presented here .    finally , the panoramic view of the megacam survey can be used to provide some constraints on the missing satellite problem .",
    "five dwarf galaxies with luminosity @xmath138 are found in the survey ( and  ii , and  iii , and  xi , and  xii and and  xiii ) . assuming a poissonian distribution , the survey would therefore contains @xmath139 satellites within the given magnitude limit .",
    "moreover , the integration of a nfw profile along the line of sight using suitable parameters for m31 ( concentration of @xmath140 and virial radius of 313 ; @xcite ) shows that the survey covers 11% of the total m31 halo .",
    "since satellites in the central regions of the halo tend to be harassed by tidal interaction and are more easily destroyed , the maximum number of satellites of the andromeda galaxy with @xmath138 can therefore be estimated to be @xmath14 .",
    "even if we assume these objects reside in massive dark matter halos of @xmath132 as has been measured for ursa major @xcite , and  ix @xcite and boo @xcite , this number is still one order of magnitude smaller than the number of cdm satellites ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "thus , it seems faint dwarf galaxies can not alone account for the so - called missing satellites except if their currently measured masses are underestimated by a factor of @xmath141 , for instance if they have dark matter halos that extend beyond their luminous counterpart .",
    "it has to be noted however , that larger and more diffuse structures could be missed by the visual inspection that led to the discovery of the new dwarfs .",
    "a search for these sub - structures is under way and will be presented in an up - coming paper ( martin et al .",
    ", in prep . )",
    "the inspection of the 57 square - degrees of our megacam survey of a quadrant of the m31 halo , from a projected distance of 50  to 150 , reveals the presence of four new satellites of the andromeda galaxy down to @xmath142 .",
    "one of these is the farthest m31 globular cluster currently known .",
    "the other three satellites are faint dwarf galaxies that all lie within two degrees of one another , have a similar metallicity and are two to three times smaller than the smallest of previously - known m31 satellite galaxies",
    ". all these characteristics may indicate that they are linked together , have a common origin and were brought in the m31 halo by the same mechanism .",
    "radial velocity measurements are necessary to confirm that they are kinematically associated and could also be used to determine if they exhibit the same high mass - to - light ratio that is found for the faint and  ix @xcite , uma @xcite and boo @xcite .",
    "the sparsely populated rgbs of these new dwarfs will however prove a challenge for current telescopes .",
    "deeper photometric observations are also required to better characterize the new structures , constrain their parameters and their stellar populations and search for tidal features in their outskirts .",
    "their relation to the asymmetric distribution of m31 satellites @xcite would also be very interesting to study .",
    "the megacam survey also gives the first opportunity to study a significant portion of a galactic halo in search of substructures without any of the bias , such as projection effects and foreground contamination , that plague milky way studies . from the surveyed area",
    ", we estimate that a maximum of @xmath14 satellites with @xmath138 orbit around the andromeda galaxy , which is one order of magnitude smaller than the number of substructures expected from cdm models , except if they reside in more massive halos than currently measured .",
    "the missing satellites thus do not seem to be highly dark matter dominated dwarf galaxies unless many are even fainter or more extended than those found here .",
    "we wish to thank the cfht staff for performing the megacam observations in queue mode .",
