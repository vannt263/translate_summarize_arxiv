    "the lack of understanding of the quantum behavior of the gravitational field , and therefore the lack of understanding of quantum geometry , remains a major open problem in fundamental physics .",
    "there are tentative theories which are presently intensively investigated .",
    "for instance , there is perturbative string theory , and non - perturbative string theory , much studied in these days . a less ambitious attempt to solve the problem is nonperturbative quantum gravity , or `` loop quantum gravity . ''",
    "this is the project of taking the conceptual novelties introduced in physics by general relativity very seriously , and trying to make sense of quantum general relativity ( or any other high energy extension of general relativity ) nonperturbatively .",
    "the program is based on the hypothesis that perturbative approaches fail to describe planck scale physics because at the planck scale the separation between a background metric and a quantum field is not physically justified . at short scale , spacetime is not minkoskian .",
    "a posteriori , loop quantum gravity supports the hypothesis , since the short structure of the geometry turns out to be strongly non - minkoskian in the nonperturbative theory @xcite .",
    "`` man shall not separate what einstein put together '' _ : we should not separate the gravitational field from the metric .    if this idea is correct , then the quantum gravitational field can not be described as a quantum field over a metric manifold , because there is no background field to provide the metric structure . therefore we have to learn how to construct a quantum field theory living over a structure weaker than a metric manifold : namely over a differential manifold .",
    "the aim of nonperturbative quantum gravity is to understand what is quantum field theory ( qft ) on differential manifolds ( as opposed to qft on metric spaces ) . in other words ,",
    "we want a qft which is formulated in a diffeomorphism invariant way , and therefore may incorporate the essential physical content of general relativity ( gr ) , which i am convinced is encoded in its active diffemorphism invariance .",
    "in such a context , most of the techniques of qft that we like and love become useless .",
    "therefore a qft on a manifold turns out to have a structure profoundly different from usual qft s .",
    "the manifold itself is `` washed away '' by diffeomorphism invariance , and therefore the excitations of the quantum field do not live `` over a space '' ; they live `` nowhere '' , since they _",
    "are  _ the space over which physics happens . in other words",
    ", qft must undergo the same deep transformation that classical field theory had to undergo in the evolution from pre - general relativistic physics to general relativistic physics : in general relativistic physics , the `` location '' of physical objects and physical fields is not determined with respect to a preexisting space .",
    "rather , physical quantities ( which include the gravitational field ) are only `` located '' with respect to each other @xcite .",
    "the challenge of quantum gravity is to incorporate this relational notion of localization , introduced by general relativity , into qft .",
    "as we shall see , the physical elementary excitations of the quantum gravitational field are described in loop quantum gravity by abstract objects ( s - knots ) , which do not live `` inside a given space '' .",
    "rather , they _ are  _ physical space , at the quantum level .",
    "the resulting theory fails to satisfy even the simplest assumptions on which conventional local qft is based .",
    "the theory is hard to analyze ; it often contradicts our intuition and some of our accepted believes , developed in the context of local qft s .",
    "this is a fact which unfortunately often complicates the communication between quantum gravity and other sectors of theoretical physics .",
    "the idea of exploring quantum gr nonperturbatively is old .",
    "but during the last decade , the research program has developed intensely , prompted by two technical advances .",
    "one is the reformulation of classical general relativity due to ashtekar @xcite , which has substantially simplified the formalism .",
    "the second is the introduction of the loop representation for quantum gravity @xcite .",
    "the loop representation is a technique for defining a nonperturbative quantum theory on a manifold .",
    "the idea is to replace creation and annihilation operators , which are the essential ingredients of conventional qft and which make sense only if there is a background metric , with a different set of operators : the loop operators .",
    "the loop operators do not require a background metric to be defined .",
    "the theory defined by a representation of the creation and annihilation operator algebra is naturally in the fock , or particle , basis .",
    "the theory defined by the loop operators is naturally in a basis , denoted the loop basis , or more precisely the spin network basis , which turns out to be particularly suitable for dealing with the quantum kinematics and dynamics of the theory , as well as for analising the nonperturbative aspects of quantum geometry .",
    "the loop approach to nonperturbative quantum gravity has now developed in many directions .",
    "here , i present a brief overview of the main ideas , techniques and results , and i focus on a particularly interesting result : the explicit computation of the spectrum of the area @xcite .    a traditional problem in quantum gravity",
    "is the difficulty of testing ideas and results @xcite .",
    "this is due not only to the lack of direct experimental or observational access to planck scale physics ; but also to the intrinsic difficulty of extracting results from the theory that could be tested indirectly .",
    "however , there is an area of theoretical physics that gives us indirect information on quantum gravity : black hole thermodynamics .",
    "the great power of thermodynamics to put constraints on theoretical constructions , and even provide precise quantitative indications on microscopic theories is well known : quantum mechanics itself was born to a large extent in order to satisfy thermodynamical consistency requirements ( planck s spectrum , solid state ... ) .",
    "now , black hole thermodynamics derives a surprising set of simple laws just from classical general relativity and quantum field theory in curved spacetime ( for an introduction , see @xcite ) .",
    "these laws have not been experimentally tested , but are very well motivated .",
    "however , they are thermodynamical `` phenomenological '' laws , and their derivation from first principles requires a quantum theory of gravity , and , at present , is lacking .",
    "this state of affairs provides the ideal testing ground for loop quantum gravity .",
    "the study of the applications of loop quantum gravity to black hole thermodynamics has just begun .",
    "here , i describe two of these applications . the first @xcite is a discussion of the bekenstein mukhanov effect @xcite .",
    "the second @xcite and more important application is a derivation of the bekenstein - hawking black hole entropy formula @xcite from first principles . in some parts of this lecture",
    "i will follow , and sometimes expand , references @xcite .",
    "classical general relativity can be formulated in phase space form as follows @xcite .",
    "we fix a three - dimensional manifold @xmath0 and consider two real ( smooth ) @xmath1 fields @xmath2 and @xmath3 on  @xmath0 .",
    "we use @xmath4 for ( abstract ) spatial indices and @xmath5 for internal @xmath1 indices .",
    "we indicate coordinates on @xmath0 with  @xmath6 .",
    "the relation between these fields and conventional metric gravitational variables is as follows : @xmath3 is the ( densitized ) inverse triad , related to the three - dimensional metric @xmath7 of the constant - time surface by @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the determinant of @xmath10 ; and @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the @xmath13 spin connection associated to the triad and @xmath14 is the extrinsic curvature of the three surface ( up to indices position ) .",
    "notice the absence of the @xmath15 in ( [ real ] ) , which yields the _ real _ ashtekar connection .    the spinorial version of the ashtekar variables is given in terms of the pauli matrices @xmath16 , or the @xmath17 generators @xmath18 , by @xmath19 @xmath20 and @xmath21 are @xmath22 complex matrices .",
    "the theory is invariant under local @xmath1 gauge , three - dimensional diffeomorphisms of the manifold on which the fields are defined , as well as under ( coordinate ) time translations generated by the lorentzian hamiltonian constraint .",
    "the full dynamical content of gr is captured by the three constraints that generate these gauge invariances @xcite .",
    "the lorentzian hamiltonian constraint does not have a simple polynomial form if we use the real connection ( [ real ] ) . for a while",
    ", this fact was considered an obstacle defining the quantum hamiltonian constraint ; therefore the complex version of the connection was mostly used .",
    "however , thiemann has recently succeded in constructing a satisfactory lorentzian quantum hamiltonian constraint @xcite in spite of the non - polynomiality of the classical expression .",
    "this is the reason we use here the real connection .",
    "this choice has the advantage of greatly simplifying the `` reality conditions '' problem .    to construct the quantum theory",
    ", we have to promote the fields to operators on a hilbert space .",
    "one possibility is to consider the positive and negative frequencies of a and e , and define a fock representation .",
    "the definition of positive and negative frequencies requires a metric .",
    "thus , one may consider an unperturbed background field around which expanding a and e , and use the unperturbed field as background metric .",
    "the problem is that the expansion becomes unsuitable precisely at the planck scale , which is the scale we are interested in .",
    "the loop representation is based on the choice of other quantities to be promoted as basic operators .",
    "these are : the trace of the holonomy of the ashtekar connection , which is labeled by loops on the three manifold ; and the higher order loop variables , obtained inserting the @xmath23 field ( in @xmath24 distinct points , or `` hands '' of the loop variable ) into the holonomy trace .",
    "more precisely , given a loop @xmath25 and the points @xmath26 we define : @xmath27           & = & - { \\rm tr } [ u_\\alpha ] , \\label{t0 }   \\\\    { \\cal t}^a[\\alpha](s )             & = & - { \\rm tr } [ u_\\alpha(s , s ) \\tilde{e}^a(s ) ] \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and , in general @xmath28(s_1,s_2 ) & = &     - { \\rm tr } [ u_\\alpha(s_1,s_2 ) \\tilde{e}^{a_2}(s_2 )                   u_\\alpha(s_2,s_1 ) \\tilde{e}^{a_1}(s_1 ) ] , \\\\",

    "( see @xcite for more details . )",
    "these are the loop observables .",
    "they coordinatize the phase space and have a closed poisson algebra .",
    "thus , we may pick a unitary representation of this algebra as the definition of the kinematic of the quantum theory .",
    "a representations of the loop algebra can be defined as follows ( the first introduction of the loop representation , in the context of yang mills theory , is in @xcite ) .",
    "we consider the free algebra @xmath32 $ ] over the set of the loops in the three manifold , namely the set of objects @xmath33 which are ( finite ) formal linear combinations of formal products of loops : @xmath34 + \\sum_{jk } c_{jk }                       ~[\\alpha_j][\\alpha_k]~ + \\ldots ~~ , \\label{fla}\\ ] ] where the @xmath35 s are arbitrary complex number and the @xmath25 s are loops ( see also @xcite ) . the loop observable ( [ t0 ] ) has an immediate extension to this algebra as factor in the first term .",

    "there is natural basis in this linear space , denoted the spin network basis , which was introduced in @xcite , and developed in @xcite .",
    "this is defined as follows .",
    "a spin network @xmath42 is here a graph imbedded in the three dimensional space @xmath0 , with a `` color '' ( a positive integer ) assigned to each link of the graph",
    ". vertices with valence higher than three are ( arbitrarily ) expanded in tree - like `` virtual '' trivalent graphs and the  `",
    "virtual' edges are colored as well ( see @xcite ) .",
    "colors satisfy a condition at the vertices : in a trivalent vertex , each color is not larger than the sum of the other two ( clebsh - gordon condition ) , and the sum of the three colors is even .",
    "there exists a procedure to associate a linear combination of formal products of loops , and therefore an element of the quantum state space @xmath43 , to each such spin network .",
    "the procedure ( introduced by penrose @xcite ) consists in replacing each ( real and virtual ) edge colored @xmath44 with @xmath44 overlapping lines , joining these lines at the vertices and then anti - symmetrizing the lines in each ( real and virtual ) edge .",
    "one can then prove that the quantum states @xmath45 obtained in this way form a basis in @xmath46 .    finally , a scalar product is naturally defined over @xmath46 ( see @xcite , and below ) .",
    "we can complete in the hilbert norm , obtaining the ( `` unconstrained '' or `` kinematical '' ) hilbert space of the quantum theory , which we denote as @xmath47 .",
    "the hilbert space @xmath47 has a rich structure that has been extensively explored .",
    "first of all , the spin network states satisfy the kauffman axioms of the tangle theoretical version of recoupling theory @xcite ( in the `` classical '' case @xmath48 ) at all the points ( in 3d space ) in which they meet .",
    "for instance , weave consider a 4-valent intersection of four edges colored @xmath49 .",
    "the color of the vertex is determined by expanding the 4-valent intersection into a trivalent tree ; in this case , we have a single internal edge .",
    "the expansion can be done in different ways ( by pairing edges differently ) .",
    "these are related to each other by the recoupling theorem of pg .",
    "60 in ref .",
    "@xcite @xmath50 where the quantities @xmath51 are @xmath17 six - j symbols ( normalized as in @xcite ) . equation ( [ rec ] ) follows just from the definitions given above .",
    "recoupling theory provides a powerful computational tool in this context .",
    "since spin network states satisfy recoupling theory , they form a temperley - lieb algebra @xcite . the scalar product in @xmath47 is given by the temperley - lieb trace of the spin networks , or , equivalently by the kauffman brackets , or , equivalently , by the chromatic evaluation of the spin network .",
    "spin network states form an orthogonal base .",
    "see ref .",
    "@xcite for an extensive discussion of these relations .",
    "next , the space @xmath47 can be constructed as the projective limit of a ( projective ) family of hilbert spaces @xmath52 of @xmath13 lattice gauge theories defined over arbitrary lattices @xmath53 in three - space @xcite .",
    "the space @xmath52 naturally sits into the space @xmath54 when the graph @xmath53 is a subgraph of @xmath55 , and , correspondingly , the spaces @xmath52 form a projective family .",
    "next , @xmath47 can be viewed as the space of gauge - invariant functions over ( the closure in a suitable norm of ) the space @xmath56 of the @xmath13 gauge connections , which are square integrable under the ashtekar - lewandowski - baez measure @xmath57 $ ] @xcite .",
    "@xmath56 can be thought as a space of `` distributional connections '' .",
    "the ashtekar - lewandowski - baez measure is a diffeomorphism invariant measure over such space .",
    "( or , equivalently , a `` generalized measure '' over the space of smooth connection @xcite . )",
    "the cylindrical functions over which the measure is constructed correspond precisely to the spin network states defined above .    the relation is as follows . when restricted to the ( dense ) subspace of @xmath56 formed by smooth connections , the cylindrical function @xmath58=\\langle a| s\\rangle$ ] corresponding to a given spin network state @xmath45 is formed by parallel propagators of the @xmath13 connection along the edges of @xmath42 , in the representation @xmath59 , where @xmath44 is the color of the edge , contracted at the vertices by means of invariant tensors in the tensor product of the representations associated to the edges joining at the vertex .",
    "the colors of the vertex ( namely the colors of the internal edges ) label the independent invariant tensors tensor on the tensor product of a finite number of irreps .",
    "is obtained by progressively decomposing tensor products or irreps . into irreps .",
    ", two by two . ] .",
    "this construction gives a rigorous meaning to the loop transform , which was used as an heuristic devise to build the loop representation in @xcite .",

    "for a recent discussion of the unitary equivalence between loop and connection representations see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the relation between the two representations is also an implementation of the well known duality between @xmath13 representation theory and the combinatorics of planar loops .",
    "this duality has been much exploited in physical applications , and underlies all graphical methods for dealing with @xmath13 representation theory @xcite .",
    "it was penrose who first had the intuition that this mathematics could be relevant for describing the quantum properties of the geometry , and who gave the first version of spin network theory @xcite .",
    "finally , ashtekar and isham @xcite have recovered the representation of the loop algebra by using c*-algebra representation theory : the space @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is the group of local @xmath13 transformations , is precisely the guelfand spectrum of the abelian part of the loop algebra .",
    "one can show that this is a suitable norm closure of the space of smooth @xmath13 connections over physical space , modulo gauge transformations .",
    "thus , a number of powerful mathematical tools are at hand for dealing with nonperturbative quantum gravity .",
    "some of these have already been extensively used in this context .",
    "these include : penrose s spin network theory , @xmath13 representation theory , kauffman tangle theoretical recoupling theory , temperly - liebb algebras , gelfand s @xmath65algebra spectral representation theory , infinite dimensional measure theory and differential geometry over infinite dimensional spaces .",
    "we now define the quantum operators , corresponding to the @xmath66-variables , as linear operators on @xmath47 .",
    "these form a representation of the loop variables poisson algebra .",
    "the operator @xmath67 $ ] , acting on a state @xmath68 simply adds a loop to @xmath69 : @xmath70    + \\sum_{ij } c_{ij } ~[\\alpha_i][\\alpha_j]~    + \\ldots}\\bigg|\\ \\   { \\hat{\\cal t}}[\\alpha ]",

    "higher order loop operators act similarly .",
    "one can verify that these operators provide a representation of the classical poisson loop algebra .",
    "all the operators in the theory are then constructed in terms of these basics loop operators , in the same way in which in conventional qft one constructs all operators , including the hamiltonian , in terms of creation and annihilation operators .",
    "the construction of the composite operators requires the development of regularization techniques that can be used in the absence of a background metric .",
    "these have been introduced in @xcite and developed in @xcite .",
    "i will illustrate these techniques below .",
    "the next step in the construction of the theory is to factor away diffeomorphism invariance .",
    "this is a key step for two reasons .",
    "first of all , @xmath47 is a `` huge '' non separable space .",
    "it is far `` too large '' for a quantum field theory .",
    "however , most of this redundancy is all gauge , and disappears when one solves the diffeomorphism constraint , defining the physical hilbert space @xmath77 .",
    "this is the reason for which the loop representation , as defined here , is of great value in diffeomorphism invariant theories only .",
    "the second reason is that @xmath77 turns out to have a natural basis labeled by knots .",
    "more precisely by `` s - knots '' .",
    "an s - knot @xmath60 is an equivalence classes of spin networks @xmath42 under diffeomorphisms .",
    "an s - knot is characterized by its `` abstract '' graph ( defined only by the adjecency relations between edges and vertices ) , by the coloring , and by its knotting and linking properties , as in knot - theory .",
    "thus , the physical quantum states of the gravitational field turn out to be essentially classified by knot theory .    there are various equivalent way of obtaining @xmath77 from @xmath78 . one can use regularization techniques for defining the quantum operator corresponding to the classical diffeomorphism constraint in terms of elementary loop operators , and then find the kernel of such operator .",
    "equivalently , one can factor @xmath79 by the natural action of the diffeomorphism group that it carries .",
    "namely @xmath80 for a rigorous way for defining such a quotient of an hilbert space by an infinite dimensional group , see @xcite and references therein .      finally , the definition of the theory is completed by giving the hamiltonian constraint .",
    "a number of approaches to the definition of a hamiltonian constraint have been attempted in the past , with various degrees of success .",
    "recently , however , thiemann has succeded in providing a regularization of the hamiltonian constraint that yields a well defined , finite operator in @xmath77 .",
    "thiemann s construction @xcite is based on several clever ideas .",
    "i will not describe it here .",
    "rather , i will sketch below the final form of the constraint ( for the lapse=1 case ) , following @xcite .",
    "i begin with the euclidean hamiltonian constraint @xmath81 .",
    "we have @xmath82 here @xmath15 labels the vertices of the s - knot @xmath60 ; @xmath83 labels couples of ( distinct ) edges emerging from @xmath15 .",

    "what are the microscopical degrees of freedom responsible for ( [ uno ] ) ? can one derive ( [ uno ] ) from first principles ?",
    "clearly a complete answer of these questions requires a quantum theory of gravity .",
    "recently , bekenstein and mukhanov @xcite have suggested that the thermal nature of hawking s radiation may be affected by quantum properties of gravity ( for a review of earlier suggestions in this direction , see @xcite ) .",
    "bekenstein and mukhanov observe that in most approaches to quantum gravity the area can take only quantized values @xcite .",
    "since the area of the black hole surface is connected to the black hole mass , black hole mass is likely to be quantized as well .",
    "the mass of the black hole decreases when radiation is emitted .",
    "therefore emission happens when the black hole makes a quantum leap from one quantized value of the mass ( energy ) to a lower quantized value , very much as atoms do .",
    "a consequence of this picture is that radiation is emitted at quantized frequencies , corresponding to the differences between energy levels .",
    "thus , quantum gravity implies a discretized emission spectrum for the black hole radiation .    by itself , this result is not physically in contradiction with hawking s prediction of a continuous thermal spectrum . to understand this ,",
    "consider the black body radiation of a gas in a cavity , at high temperature .",
    "this radiation has a thermal planckian emission spectrum , essentially continuous .",
    "however , radiation is emitted by elementary quantum emission processes yielding a discrete spectrum .",
    "the solution of the apparent contradiction is that the spectral lines are so dense in the range of frequencies of interest , that they give rise effectively to a continuous spectrum .",
    "does the same happen for a black hole ?    in order to answer this question , we need to know the energy spectrum of the black hole , which is to say , the spectrum of the area . bekenstein and mukhanov",
    "pick up a simple ansatz : they assume that the area is quantized in multiple integers of an elementary area @xmath161 .",
    "namely , that the area can take the values @xmath162 where @xmath24 is a positive integer , and @xmath161 is an elementary area of the order of the planck area @xmath163 where @xmath25 is a number of the order of unity ( @xmath164 is newton s constant and @xmath165 ) .",
    "ansatz ( [ ansatz ] ) is reasonable ; it agrees , for instance , with the partial results on eigenvalues of the area in the loop representation given in @xcite , and with the idea of a quantum picture of a geometry made by elementary `` quanta of area '' .",
    "since the black hole mass is related to the area by ( [ ma ] ) , it follows from this relation and the ansatz ( [ ansatz ] ) that the energy spectrum of the black hole is given by @xmath166 consider an emission process in which the emitted energy is much smaller than the mass @xmath0 of the black hole . from ( [ mass ] ) , the spacing between the energy levels is @xmath167 from the quantum mechanical relation @xmath168 we conclude that energy is emitted in frequencies that are integer multiple of the fundamental emission frequency @xmath169 this is the fundamental emission frequency of bekenstein and mukhanov @xcite ( they assume @xmath170 ) .",
    "bekenstein and mukhanov proceed in @xcite by showing that the emission amplitude remains the same as the one in hawking s thermal spectrum , so that the full emission spectrum is given by spectral lines at frequencies multiple of @xmath171 , whose envelope is hawking s thermal spectrum .    as emphasized by smolin in @xcite , however , the bekenstein - mukhanov spectrum is drastically different than the hawking spectrum .",
    "indeed , the maximum of the planckian emission spectrum of hawking s thermal radiation is around @xmath172 that is : the fundamental emission frequency @xmath171 is of the same order as the maximum of the planck distribution of the emitted radiation .",
    "it follows that there are only a few spectral lines in the regions where emission is appreciable .",
    "therefore the bekenstein - mukhanov spectrum is drastically different than the hawking spectrum : the two have the same envelope , but while hawking spectrum is continuous , the bekenstein - mukhanov spectrum is formed by just a few lines in the interval of frequencies where emission is appreciable .",
    "notice that such a discretization of the emission spectrum is derived by bekenstein and mukhanov on purely kinematical grounds , that is using only the ( assumed ) spectral properties of the area .",
    "to emphasize this fact , we will denote it as the kinematical bekenstein - mukhanov effect .",
    "this result is of great interest because , in spite of its weakness , black hole radiation is still much closer to the possibility of ( indirect ) investigation than any quantum gravitational effect of which we can think .",
    "thus , a clear quantum gravitational signature on the hawking spectrum is a very interesting effect .",
    "is this bekenstein - mukhanov effect credible ?    as first suggested in @xcite , and , independently , by brgmann , one may use loop quantum gravity to check the bekenstein - mukhanov result , by replacing the naive ansatz ( [ ansatz ] ) with the precise spectrum computed in loop quantum gravity .    consider a surface",
    "@xmath98 in the present case , the event horizon of the black hole. the area of @xmath98 can take only a set of quantized values .",
    "these quantized values are labeled by unordered n - tuples of positive integers @xmath173 of arbitrary length @xmath24 . the spectrum is given in ( [ spec ] ) .",
    "if we disregard for a moment the term @xmath174 under the square root in ( [ spec ] ) , we obtain immediately the ansatz ( [ ansatz ] ) , and thus the bekenstein - mukhanov result .",
    "however , the @xmath174 is there .",
    "let us study the consequences of its presence .",
    "first , let us estimate the number of area eigenvalues between the value @xmath175 and the value @xmath176 of the area , where we take @xmath177 much smaller than @xmath153 but still much larger than @xmath72 . since the @xmath174 in ( [ spec ] ) affects in a considerable way only the terms with low @xmath178 , we can neglect it for a rough estimate .",
    "thus , we must estimate the number of unordered strings of integers @xmath179 such that @xmath180 this is a well known problem in number theory .",
    "it is called the partition problem .",
    "it is the problem of computing the number @xmath121 of ways in which an integer @xmath87 can be written as a sum of other integers .",
    "the solution for large @xmath87 is a classic result by hardy and ramanujan @xcite . according to the hardy - ramanujan formula",
    ", @xmath121 grows as the exponent of the square root of @xmath87 .",
    "more precisely , we have for large @xmath87 that @xmath181 applying this result in our case we have that the number of eigenvalues between @xmath153 and @xmath176 is @xmath182 now , because of the presence of the @xmath174 term , eigenvalues will overlap only accidentally : generically all eigenvalues will be distinct .",
    "therefore , the average spacing between eigenvalues decreases exponentially with the inverse of the square of the area .",
    "this result is to be contrasted with the fact that this spacing is constant and of the order of the planck area in the case of the naive ansatz ( [ ansatz ] ) .",
    "this conclusion empties the bekenstein - mukhanov argument .",
    "indeed , the density of the energy levels becomes @xmath183 and therefore the spacing of the energy levels decreases _ exponentially  _ with @xmath0 .",
    "it follows that for a macroscopical black hole the spacing between energy levels is infinitesimal , and thus the spectral lines are virtually dense in frequency .",
    "we effectively recover in this way hawking s thermal spectrum ( except , of course , in the case of a planck scale black hole ) .",
    "a weaker but rigorous lower bound on the density of eigenvalues , consistent with the argumented given here , is given in @xcite .",
    "the conclusion is that the bekenstein - mukhanov effect disappears if we replace the naive ansatz ( [ ansatz ] ) with the spectrum ( [ spec ] ) computed from loop quantum gravity . more generally , the kinematical bekenstein - mukhanov effect is strongly dependent on the peculiar form of the naive ansatz ( [ ansatz ] ) , and it is not robust . in a sense",
    ", this is a pity , because we loose a possible window on quantum geometry .",
    "mukhanov and , independently , smolin have noticed that the possibility is still open for the existence of a `` dynamical '' bekenstein - mukhanov effect @xcite .",
    "for instance , transitions in which a single planck unit of area is lost could be strongly favored by the dynamics . to explore",
    "if this is the case , one should make use of the full machinery of quantum gravity , for instance by computing transition probabilities between horizon s area eigenstates induced in a first order perturbation expansion by the coupling between the area of the horizon and a surrounding radiation field .",
    "this could perhaps be done following the lines of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the conclusion is that the argument for the discretization of the black hole emission spectrum given by bekenstein and mukhanov is not valid , if we use quantitative result from loop quantum gravity . as emphasized by mukhanov",
    ", this fact does not prove that the spectrum is indeed continuous , since a discretization could be still be consequence of other ( dynamical ) reasons .      finally , i present a derivation @xcite of the bekenstein - hawking expression ( [ uno ] ) for the entropy of a schwarzschild black hole of surface area @xmath153 via a statistical mechanical computation @xcite . the strategy i follow",
    "is based on the idea that the entropy of the hole originates from the microstates of the horizon that correspond to a given macroscopic configuration .",
    "this idea was first suggested in a seminal work by york @xcite .",
    "york notices that the hole s radiance implies that the ( macroscopic ) event horizon is located slightly inside the quasistatic timelike limit - surface , leaving a thin shell between the two , which he proposes to interpret as the region over which the microscopic horizon fluctuates .",
    "he interprets these fluctuations as zero point quantum fluctuations of the horizon s quasinormal modes , and , by identifying the thermal energy of these oscillations with the shell s ( `` irreducible '' ) mass , he is able to recover hawking s temperature .",
    "i take two essential ideas from york s work : that the source of the hole entropy is in the degrees of freedom associated with the fluctuations of the shape of the ( microscopic ) horizon ; and that the quasilocal measure of mass - energy governing energetic exchanges between the horizon and its surroundings can be taken as the christodoulou - ruffini @xcite `` irreducible mass '' @xmath184 can we replace york s perturbative semiclassical approach with a direct calculation within nonperturbative quantum gravity ?    the relevance of horizon s surface degrees of freedom for the entropy has been recently explored from various perspectives @xcite .",
    "( see also @xcite for an attempt to use the `` membrane paradigm '' @xcite : interactions of a black hole with its surroundings can be described in terms of a fictitious physical membrane located close to the horizon ) .",
    "an approach strictly related to the one i am going to describe has been suggested in refs .",
    "@xcite , where it is argued that a physical split of a gauge system gives rise to boundary degrees of freedom , since the boundary breaks the gauge group .",
    "using this idea the bekenstein - hawking formula can be derived , by counting boundary states , in 3-d gravity .",
    "the relation is the following . in gr , the broken component of the gauge group includes diffeomorphisms that move the surface , and the boundary degrees of freedom",
    "can probably be viewed as fluctuations of the horizon .",
    "consider a physical system containing a non - rotating and non - charged black hole ( say a collapsed star ) as well as other physical components such as dust , gas or radiation , which we denote collectively ( improperly ) as `` matter '' .",
    "we are interested in the statistical thermodynamics of such a system .",
    "a key observation is that because of einstein s equations the microscopic time - dependent inhomogeneities of the matter distribution generate time - dependent `` microscopic '' inhomogeneities in the gravitational field as well .",
    "one usually safely disregards these ripples of the geometry .",
    "for instance , we say that the geometry over the earth s surface is minkowski ( or schwarzschild , due to the earth gravitational field ) , disregarding the inhomogeneous time - dependent gravitational field generated by each individual fast moving air molecule .",
    "the minkowski geometry is therefore a `` macroscopic '' coarse - grained average of the microscopic gravitational field surrounding us .",
    "however , in a statistical - thermodynamical treatment , these fluctuations should not be disregarded , because they are precisely the sources of the thermal behavior .",
    "statistical thermodynamics is based on the distinction between the macroscopic state of a system , determined by coarse - grained averaged physical quantities , and its macroscopic state determined by a ( hypothetical ) complete description of the system s dynamics .",
    "a system in equilibrium at a finite temperature @xmath185 is macroscopically stationary .",
    "however , its microstate fluctuates over microscopic non - stationary configurations .",
    "the family of the microstates over which the system fluctuates when in a given macrostate form the statistical `` ensemble '' associated to the given macrostate .",
    "for instance , the macrostate of a gas in thermal equilibrium in a box is time - independent and spatially homogeneous , while the microstates in the corresponding ensemble are individually time dependent and non - homogeneous .",
    "thus , we must have _ two descriptions  _ of a physical black hole interacting with surrounding matter at finite temperature .",
    "the macroscopic description is a stationary coarse grained description in which inhomogeneities are smoothed out .",
    "the microscopic description does not neglect the minute thermal motions .",
    "macroscopically , a non - charged and non - rotating hole is described by a stationary metric with non - charged and non - rotating event horizon .",
    "there is only a one - parameter family of solutions of einstein equations with such properties : schwarzschild with mass @xmath0 , and corresponding event - horizon area @xmath186 .",
    "therefore in a thermal context the schwarzschild metric represents the coarse grained description of a microscopically fluctuating geometry .",
    "microscopically the gravitational field is non - stationary ( because it interacts with non - stationary matter ) and non - spherically symmetric ( because matter distribution is spherically symmetric on average only , and not on individual microstates ) .",
    "its microstate , therefore is _ not _ given by the schwarzschild metric , but by some complicated time - dependent non - symmetric metric .    i am convinced that taking such time - dependent non - symmetric microstates of the geometry into account is essential for a statistical understanding of the thermal behavior of black holes  as it is in understanding the thermal properties of any other system .",
    "searching for a derivation of black hole thermodynamics from properties of stationary or symmetric metrics alone is like trying to derive the thermodynamics of an ideal gas in a spherical box just from spherically symmetric motions of the molecules .    thus , consider the microstate of our system .",
    "let us foliate spacetime with a family of spacelike surfaces @xmath187 , labeled by a time coordinate @xmath115 .",
    "the intersection @xmath188 between the surface @xmath187 and the future boundary of the past of future null - infinity defines the instantaneous ( microscopic ) configuration of the event horizon at time @xmath115 .",
    "thus , @xmath188 is a closed 2-d surface immersed in @xmath187 . for most times , this microscopic configuration of the event horizon is not spherically symmetric .",
    "let us denote by @xmath189 the intrinsic and extrinsic geometry of the horizon @xmath188 .",
    "let @xmath190 be the space of all possible ( intrinsic and extrinsic ) geometries of a 2-d surface . as @xmath115 changes , the ( microscopic ) geometry of the horizon changes .",
    "thus , @xmath189 wanders in @xmath190 as @xmath115 changes .",
    "i now recall some standard techniques in statistical mechanics in a form that can be applied to our system .",
    "consider a thermodynamical system @xmath191 , say an ideal gas in a isolated box .",
    "consider an equilibrium macrostate of @xmath191 .",
    "under suitable ergodicity conditions , the microstate of the system changes freely subjected to global conservation laws only .",
    "if the system is conservative and energy is the only conserved quantity , then the system will wander in the entire region of its phase space defined by a given total energy .",
    "next , we can ideally split @xmath192 into two subsystems @xmath193 and @xmath194 , say two regions of the box , separated by a thin film .",
    "we are interested in studying the thermal interactions between the two subsystems .",
    "one approach is provided by the microcanonical point of view .",
    "ideally  _ isolate the subsystem @xmath193 .",
    "namely let us momentarily assume that it can not exchange heat .",
    "let @xmath195 be its energy , and @xmath196 its entropy , defined as the number of microstates that have energy @xmath195 .",
    "we now relax the assumption that heat can not be exchanged , and consider the full system @xmath191 .",
    "if a small amount of heat @xmath197 is transferred from @xmath193 to @xmath194 the number of states available to @xmath193 decreases by an amount @xmath198 and the number of microstates available to @xmath194 increases by an amount @xmath199 . the total number of microstates available to @xmath191 changes by @xmath200 from the assumption that the equilibrium macroscopical configuration is the one to which most microstates correspond , it follows that at equilibrium no small heat transfer @xmath197 may increase the total number of available microstates , and therefore @xmath201 namely , the temperatures of the two systems are equal .",
    "let us apply these ideas to our system .",
    "consider our system as formed by two sub - systems : the black hole and the rest .",
    "we want to associate an entropy @xmath42 to the black hole , where @xmath42 counts the number of microstates over which the hole may fluctuate in an ideal situation in which no heat ( energy ) is exchanged between the hole and its surroundings .",
    "the precise specification of this ensemble of microstates is crucial , and i now discuss it in detail .",
    "first of all , as already noticed microscopic configurations do not need to be individually spherically symmetric .",
    "second , only configurations of the hole itself , and not the configurations of the surrounding geometry , should affect the hole s entropy .",
    "thus , we must focus on the state of the hole alone .",
    "next , we are considering the thermodynamic behavior of a system containing the hole .",
    "this behavior can not be affected by the hole s interior .",
    "the black hole interior may be in one of an infinite number of states indistinguishable from the outside .",
    "for instance , the black hole interior may ( in principle ) be given by a kruskal spacetime ; so that on the other side of the hole there is another `` universe '' ( say spatially compact , if not for the hole ) possibly with billions of galaxies .",
    "this potentially infinite number of such internal states does not affect the interaction of the hole with its surroundings and is irrelevant here , because it can not affect the energetic exchanges between the hole and the outside , which are the ones that determine the entropy .",
    "therefore we are only interested in configurations of the hole _ that have ( microscopically ) distinct effects on exterior of the hole_. from the exterior , the hole is completely determined by the geometrical properties of its surface .",
    "thus , the entropy relevant for the thermodynamical description of the thermal interaction of the hole with its surroundings is entirely determined by the state of the gravitational field ( of the geometry ) on the black hole surface , namely by @xmath189 .",
    "next , we have to determine the `` ensemble '' of the microstates @xmath189 over which the hole may fluctuates under the ideal hypothesis of no heat exchange . in conventional statistical thermodynamics",
    ", one assumes that the only conserved quantity is energy , and the microcanonical ensemble is determined by fixing energy . here",
    ", however , there is no obvious candidate for a notion of a conserved energy that could be used .",
    "a physical observation that leads us to the solution of this problem is that if energy flows into the black hole then its area increases , while if the black hole radiates away energy ( via hawking s radiation ) , then its area decreases .",
    "therefore we are lead to the idea that the ( ideal ) situation of no heat ( energy ) exchange is the evolution at fixed horizon s area .",
    "thus , following york , we take the christodoulou - ruffini quasi - local `` irreducible mass '' ( [ cr ] ) as the relevant energy in this context ( here @xmath153 is the area of @xmath188 ) ; and we define the ensemble as the set of @xmath189 in @xmath190 with the same @xmath202 , namely with the same area @xmath153 .",
    "there is a number of reasons supporting the choice of this ensemble .",
    "first , @xmath202 is geometrically well defined , governs the hole s energy exchanges , and agrees with the macroscopic black hole energy .",
    "second , the ensemble must contain reversible paths only . in the classical theory these conserve area ( hawking theorem @xcite ) .",
    "quantum theory allows classically forbidden energy exchanges with the exterior ( hawking radiance ) , but it is unlikely , we believe , that it would allow a nonreversible evolution of the horizon to become reversible without energy exchange with the exterior .",
    "third , we may reason backward and let the thermodynamics indicate us the correct ensemble ( which is how classical ensembles were first found ) . in this context , it perhaps worthwhile recalling that difficulties to rigorously justifying a priori the choice of the ensemble plague conventional thermodynamics anyway .",
    "summarizing , we are interested in counting the number @xmath203 of states of the geometry @xmath189 of a surface @xmath188 of area @xmath153 , where different regions of @xmath188 are distinguishable from each other .",
    "the above discussion indicates then that @xmath204 is the entropy we should associate to the horizon in order to describe its thermal interactions with its surroundings .",
    "this `` number '' @xmath203 meaningless in the classical theory .",
    "it is a this point only that we resort to the quantum theory . as the entropy of the electromagnetic field in a cavity",
    "is well defined only if we take quantum theory into account , similarly we may expect that the number of states @xmath203 will be well defined in a quantum theory of gravity .",
    "the problem is thus to count the number of ( orthogonal ) quantum states of the geometry of a two dimensional surface , having total area @xmath153 .",
    "the problem is now well defined , and can be translated into a direct computation .",
    "if a surface @xmath98 is given , its geometry is determined by its intersections with the s - knot .",
    "intersections are of three types : ( a ) an edge crosses the surface ; ( b ) a vertex lies on the surface ; ( c ) a finite part of the s - knot lies on the surface .",
    "intuitively , type ( a ) is the only `` generic '' case , and we should disregard states of type ( b ) and ( c ) .",
    "ashtekar has suggested a argument for neglecting type ( b ) and ( c ) intersections @xcite : we wish to describe the geometry of a fluctuating surface @xmath98 as observed from the exterior , and we expect the state of its geometry to be stable under infinitesimal deformations of @xmath98 .",
    "we may thus consider the surface as the limit of a sequence of surfaces @xmath109 , and its state as the ( hilbert norm ) limit of the states of @xmath109 .",
    "clearly , states of type ( b ) and ( c ) can not appear in this way , and therefore we have to restrict our computation to states having intersections of type ( a ) only @xcite . the quantum geometry on the surface",
    "is then determined by the _ ordered  _ n - tuples of integers @xmath205 that form the colors of the edges of type ( a ) intersections .",
    "notice that in the previous section we were interested in counting the density of the eigenvalues of the area ( because these determine the density of the lines in the emission spectrum ) . while here we are interested in counting the density of the eigenstates .",
    "thus , we must take the degeneracy of each eigenspace into account .",
    "n - tuples that differ from each other in the ordering yield of course the same total area .",
    "therefore they should be considered indistinguishable in counting eigenvalues . on the other side they label distinct states .",
    "one may be tempted to observe that such states can be transformed into each other by diffeomorphisms , and therefore should not be considered distinguishable . however , this observation is not correct .",
    "the point is that physical states are defined as equivalence classes under diffeomorphism of the full space , not the surface alone . to understand this point ,",
    "let us consider a simplified analogy : consider a set @xmath153 , a set @xmath206 , and a group @xmath164 that acts ( freely ) on @xmath153 and on @xmath206 .",
    "then @xmath164 acts on @xmath207 . what is the space @xmath208 ?",
    "one may be tempted to say that it is ( isomorphic to ) @xmath209 , but a moment of reflection shows that this is not correct and the correct answer is @xmath210 if @xmath164 does not act freely over @xmath153 , we have to divide @xmath206 by the stability groups of the elements of @xmath153 .",
    "now , imagine that @xmath153 is the space of the states of the exterior of the black hole , @xmath206 the space of the states of the black hole , and @xmath164 the diffeomorphism group of the horizon .",
    "then we see that we must not divide @xmath206 by the diffeomorphisms of the surface , but only by those diffeomorphisms that leave the rest of the spin network invariant .",
    "as far as the state on the surface is concerned , this amounts to restrict to diffeomorphisms that do not mix the intersections between the spin network and the surface .",
    "therefore n - tuples with different ordering must be considered as distinct .",
    "physically , this correspond to the fact that different locations in which the spin network punctures the surface can be distinguished from each other in terms of the external state of the gravitational field . for a more precise version of these remarks ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "thus , our task is reduced to the task of counting the ordered n - tuples of integers @xmath211 such that ( [ area ] ) .",
    "more precisely , we are interested in the number of microstates ( n - tuples @xmath211 ) such that the l.h.s of ( [ area ] ) is between @xmath153 and @xmath176 , where @xmath212 and @xmath177 is much smaller than @xmath153 , but still macroscopic .",
    "let @xmath213 , and let @xmath214 be the number of ordered n - tuples @xmath211 , with arbitrary @xmath24 , such that @xmath215 first , we over - estimate @xmath216 by approximating the l.h.s . of ( [ part ] ) dropping the @xmath217 term under the square root .",
    "thus , we want to compute the number @xmath218 of ordered n - tuples such that @xmath219 the problem is an exercise in combinatorics",
    ". it can be solved , for instance , by noticing that if @xmath220 is a partition of @xmath0 ( that is , it solves ( [ piu ] ) ) , then @xmath221 and @xmath222 are partitions of @xmath223 .",
    "since all partitions of @xmath223 can be obtained in this manner , we have @xmath224 therefore @xmath225 where @xmath226 is a constant . in the limit of large @xmath0",
    "we have @xmath227 next , we under - estimate @xmath216 by approximating ( [ part ] ) as @xmath228 thus , we wish to compute the number @xmath229 of ordered n - tuples such that @xmath230 namely , we have to count the partitions of @xmath0 in parts with 2 or more elements",
    ". this problem can be solved by noticing that if @xmath231 is one such partition of @xmath0 and @xmath232 is one such partition of @xmath233 , then @xmath222 and @xmath234 are partitions of @xmath223 .",
    "all partitions of @xmath223 in parts with 2 or more elements can be obtained in this manner , therefore @xmath235 it follows that @xmath236 where @xmath237 and @xmath23 are constants and @xmath238 ( obtained by inserting ( [ apm ] ) in ( [ mmm ] ) ) are the two roots of the equation @xmath239 in the limit of large @xmath0 the term with the highest root dominates , and we have @xmath240 by combining the information from the two estimates , we conclude that @xmath241 where @xmath242 or @xmath243 since the integers @xmath0 are equally spaced , our computation yields immediately the density of microstates .",
    "the number @xmath203 of microstates with area @xmath153 grows for large @xmath153 as @xmath244 this gives immediately @xmath245 which is the bekenstein - hawking formula . for a different ( and very elegant ) derivation , see @xcite .",
    "the constant of proportionality that we have obtained is @xmath246 which is roughly @xmath247 times smaller than hawking s value @xmath248 .    in summary :",
    "i have argued that the black hole entropy relevant for the hole s thermodynamical interaction with its surroundings is the number of the quantum microstates of the hole which have microscopically distinct effects on the exterior of the hole .",
    "i have argued that these states are given by the quantum state of the horizon with the same area .",
    "i have counted such microstates using loop quantum gravity .",
    "i have obtained that the entropy is proportional to the area , as in the bekenstein - hawking formula .",
    "several issues remain open .",
    "i have worked in the simplified setting of a hole interacting with a given geometry , instead of working within a fully generally covariant statistical mechanics @xcite .",
    "also , it would be nice to have a direct characterization of the event horizon in the quantum theory : this could perhaps be given along the following lines .",
    "consider a weave @xcite state @xmath249 which solves the hamiltonian constraint and represents a physical black hole .",
    "this can be expanded in the s - knot basis @xmath250 consider the observables @xmath251 representing measurement at future null infinity ( for instance , see @xcite ) . for every @xmath252 , and all @xmath251 , define as `` internal '' the edges @xmath253 of @xmath252 such that the expectation values @xmath254 satisfy @xmath255 meaning that @xmath256 is not affected if we change the color of @xmath253 .",
    "a similar definition can be given for `` internal vertices '' .",
    "denote edges and vertices that are not internal as external .",
    "now the quantum event horizon can be defined as the set of external edges that are nor surrounded by external edges or external vertices only .",
    "clearly this captures the idea of the boundary between the region that `` affects future null infinity '' and the regions that does nt .",
    "notice that under this definition the quantum event horizon is just a collection of edges ( pictorially : the edges cut by the horizon ) .",
    "this approach might clarify the issue of the type ( b ) and ( c ) intersections , and , i believe , deserves to be investigated .    finally , the numerical discrepancy with the hawking s value indicates that something is still poorly understood .",
    "jacobson @xcite has suggested that finite renormalization effects of the newton constant might account for this discrepancy and has begun to explore how the presence of matter might affect it .",
