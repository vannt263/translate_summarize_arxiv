    "atomic bose - einstein condensates ( bec ) are now generated almost routinely in the laboratory , and are resulting in numerous applications in fundamental and applied science . a key element of this research is the ability to coherently engineer and control the state of the condensate and its dynamics .",
    "this is for example the case in the generation of atomic solitons @xcite , which requires that a precise phase be imprinted on the condensate ; atomic four - wave mixing , which involves the splitting of a condensate into three momentum groups @xcite ; the mixing of optical and matter waves @xcite , which again requires the splitting of a condensate ; mode - locked atom lasers @xcite , where a condensate wave function is spatially modulated by a periodic optical potential , etc .",
    "it can be expected that the preparation of condensate states of increasing sophistication will be required in future applications , including atom lithography @xcite and atom holography @xcite .",
    "the coherent manipulation and control of quantum states has been the subject of considerable work in many other areas of physics . for example",
    ", it is now possible to precisely carve the electronic wave function of atoms or to excite vibrational modes of molecules @xcite , using precisely engineered optical pulses .",
    "similar techniques have lead to spectacular advances in nonlinear optics .",
    "a common tool to many of these developments is the use of genetic algorithms .",
    "these multi - dimensional optimization techniques proceed by parametrizing a control function in terms of a finite set of coefficients , or `` genes '' , a particular set of genes being called a `` chromosome . ''",
    "the genetic algorithm operates on a set of chromosomes , the `` population . ''",
    "its success in achieving a design goal is quantified by a `` fitness function , '' a measure of how close the action of a particular chromosome is to the desired state .",
    "the algorithm proceeds by replacing an ill - fitted fraction of the population by new chromosomes , the `` offsprings '' , that result from the mating of two parent chromosomes according to some set of rules ; see e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite for details .",
    "in addition to that controlled combination of chromosomes , random mutations on single genes prevent the algorithm from getting trapped in local extrema .",
    "the process is iterated until one chromosome reaches a prescribed fitness value .",
    "because of collisions , the dynamics of atomic bec is intrinsically nonlinear . hence , it is difficult in general to precisely predict the effects of control fields on the condensate properties .",
    "indeed , condensates are emerging as excellent test systems to study quantum chaos @xcite .",
    "this is a clear indication that straightforward analytical tools are generally unlikely to be sufficient in the coherent manipulation and control of bec .",
    "it is therefore natural to turn instead to the use of genetic algorithms .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to illustrate how they can be applied to the design of specific momentum states of condensates .",
    "we specifically consider two examples , the acceleration of a condensate , and the preparation of a bec in a coherent superposition of two momentum states with a prescribed phase difference .",
    "the external control is provided by two counterpropagating laser fields of adjustable frequency that provide a time - dependent optical lattice interacting with the condensate via bragg scattering .",
    "this is a natural choice , since bragg scattering is a well - established tool of atom optics : it has been used in many applications such as the determination of the coherence properties of condensates @xcite , the implementation of mach ",
    "zehnder interferometers to image the condensate phase @xcite , the splitting of condensates @xcite , and the creation of initial states appropriate for nonlinear mixing processes @xcite .",
    "optical lattices have also been used to investigate physical effects such as atomic landau ",
    "zener tunneling@xcite , bloch oscillations @xcite , and the acceleration of becs @xcite .",
    "also , a josephson junction array was experimentally realized with a bec in an optical standing wave @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : section [ sec : model ] discusses the model , establishes our notation , and introduces the `` quasi - modes '' of the condensate used in the subsequent analysis .",
    "section [ sec : ga ] briefly reviews important aspects of genetic algorithms .",
    "the main results are presented in section [ sec : results ] , which illustrates the usefulness of genetic algorithms in condensate acceleration and in the preparation of macroscopically separated momentum states of prescribed relative phase . finally , section [ sec : summary ] is a summary and conclusion .",
    "appendix [ sec : appendix ] gives further details of the genetic algorithm .",
    "we consider a condensate consisting of @xmath0 atoms of mass @xmath1 at temperature @xmath2 , and placed in a frequency - chirped optical lattice formed by two counterpropagating laser beams of wave vector @xmath3 and central frequency @xmath4 .",

    "dependent frequency difference between the two beams .",
    "we define the detuning @xmath7 from the atomic resonance as @xmath8 , with @xmath9 being the atomic transition frequency . in order to avoid spontaneous emission we use far  off resonance light , so that @xmath10 , with @xmath11 the spontaneous decay rate of the excited atomic level .",
    "we assume that the coupling of the light field from eq .",
    "( [ equ : efield ] ) to the atomic system is characterized by a rabi frequency @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the dipole matrix element of the transition .",
    "if the rabi frequency is small compared to the detuning , @xmath14 , we can adiabatically eliminate the excited atomic level , which evolves on a much faster time scale than the lower level . making use of the rotating wave approximation which neglects terms varying at twice the optical frequency @xmath4 , the resulting time - dependent optical potential for the lower atomic level",
    "is then given by @xmath15,\\ ] ] where @xmath16 is the lattice depth ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite for details ) . in order not to violate the adiabatic approximation ,",

    "( [ equ : potential ] ) , @xmath18}{\\partial t},\\ ] ] must remain much smaller than the speed of light at all times in order to neglect any time  dependence of the wavenumber @xmath3 , as discussed in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the control of the state of the bec is achieved by imposing a time dependence on the detuning @xmath6 between the counterpropagating laser beams .",
    "it is this time dependence that is to be determined by the genetic algorithm .",
    "we assume that the condensate is tightly confined in the transverse direction , so that the system can be described semiclassically by a one - dimensional time - dependent gross - pitaevskii equation ( gpe ) .",
    "the condensate evolution in the optical lattice of eq .",

    "@xcite investigates this problem , predicting the onset of fragmentation when the lattice potential depths are in excess of 5 - 10 lattice recoil energies .",
    "here we consider only situations where the lattice potential is shallow enough that such fragmentation does not occur .",
    "superfluid effects can likewise be ignored , since the critical velocity for typical bose ",
    "einstein condensates was recently experimentally determined to lie in the @xmath24 regime @xcite and as we show shortly , bragg diffraction only populates momentum side modes of the condensate , spaced by momenta @xmath25 , corresponding to velocities far exceeding the critial velocity .",
    "our goal in this paper is to manipulate the momentum of the condensate .",
    "it is therefore convenient to introduce the momentum space condensate wave function @xmath26 substituting these into eq .",

    "ground state collisions lead to a broadening of these peaks , but for small enough particle numbers @xmath0 , it can be expected that this broadening remains small compared to @xmath32 .",

    ", we review for completeness some important aspects of this optimization technique .",
    "genetic algorithms proceed by parametrizing a control function in terms of a finite set of genes , a particular set of genes being called a chromosome .",
    "the genetic algorithm operates on a set of chromosomes , the population , whose action on the system to be controlled is quantified in terms of a fitness function . in the situation at hand ,",
    "the control is achieved by the time - dependent detuning @xmath6 , expressed by a truncated fourier series @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the recoil frequency .",
    "each detuning @xmath43 is encoded in a chromosome @xmath44 consisting of @xmath45 genes @xmath46 , each gene corresponding to one particular fourier coefficient , @xmath47 the index @xmath48 labels a specific chromosome , and the size of the chromosome population is @xmath49 .",
    "starting from a randomly initialized population , the genetic algorithm uses a set of mating rules , mutations , and a problem - specific fitness function @xmath50 to create new generations of chromosomes , as illustrated in fig.[fig : ga_scheme ] .     according to the gpe from eq .",
    "( [ equ : gpe ] ) for a time @xmath51 , the dynamics of the optical lattice being determined by the detuning @xmath52 .",
    "the final wavefunction is then compared to the optimization goal .",
    "[ fig : ga_scheme ] ]    the first step consists in selecting parent chromosomes that are to be combined by mating operators .",
    "this is achieved by ranking the initial @xmath49 chromosomes according to their fitness and using the so - called `` roulette wheel '' method @xcite to preferentially select parent chromosomes with a high fitness .    in the next step mating operators",
    "are selected that generate a group of `` offspring '' chromosomes @xmath53 from the `` parent '' population @xmath44 .",
    "as such , these operators are at the heart of the genetic algorithm .",
    "several mating operators may be considered : the `` one - point - crossover '' operator cuts the two parent chromosomes at a randomly chosen position @xmath54 and swaps the genes according to @xmath55 with @xmath56 .",
    "a slightly modified version of this operator is the `` two - point - crossover '' operator that cuts the two parent chromosomes at two random positions @xmath57 and @xmath58 and then exchanges the genes between these two positions : @xmath59 with @xmath60 .",
    "another type of mating operator , the `` average - crossover '' operator , produces just one offspring from the two parent chromosomes by averaging the genes between two randomly chosen positions @xmath57 and @xmath58 : @xmath61 with @xmath60 and @xmath62 .",
    "except for the random location at which the splicing of the chromosome occurs , the mating algorithms discussed so far are deterministic .",
    "in addition , genetic algorithms also require the use of `` mutation '' and `` creep . ''",
    "these are random operators that produce one offspring from one parent by altering any gene of the parent chromosome with a given probability called the mutation rate , respectively the creep rate : @xmath63 the mutation operator chooses @xmath64 randomly within some bounds , whereas the creep operator shifts the old value @xmath65 by a random amount , @xmath66 . here",
    "@xmath67 is a parameter that controls the range of the shift and @xmath68 a random number .",
    "the operators discussed in this section are the only ones used in our analysis . when it comes to selecting a specific mating operator ,",
    "there are basically two possibilities : the first one consists of assigning fixed weights to the available operators and then choosing randomly among them .",
    "this is a straightforward approach , but it suffers from the problem of not discriminating against mating operators that do not perform well for the optimization problem at hand .",
    "thus , a second possibility is to dynamically adjust the operator weights over the course of the optimization @xcite .",
    "this guarantees that the best suited operators are applied and allows one to test the performance of new mating operators .",
    "this is done by assigning an adjustable `` operator fitness '' to each mating operator under consideration . as such",
    ", the mating operators are selected according to their fitness the same way as the parent chromosomes are picked .",
    "the details of the procedure used in our simulations are discussed in the next section and also in the appendix .",
    "we now apply the genetic algorithm approach to the manipulation of the state of a bec in a chirped optical lattice . as a first example",
    ", we consider the coherent transfer of a condensate population between the adjacent quasi - modes @xmath69 and @xmath70 . our motivation here is the need to find efficient ways to accelerate condensates for atom optics applications .",
    "this problem was theoretically analyzed in refs . @xcite and",
    "experimentally demonstrated in ref .",
    "@xcite for the case of a linear dependence of @xmath6 , @xmath71 .",
    "while this chirping of the lattice detuning does lead to a large mean acceleration of the condensate , it unfortunately leaves a substantial fraction of the condensate in lower quasi - modes .",
    "this translates into a loss in coherence that is unacceptable , e.g. , in interferometric applications .",
    "the question , then , is whether an optimized time - dependent detuning determined by a genetic algorithm can eliminate this problem .    for the sake of illustration",
    ", we assume that the condensate is initially in the zero - momentum quasi - mode , @xmath72 , and seek a time - dependent detuning such that @xmath73 after some predetermined time @xmath51 . in that case",
    ", the algorithm fitness has the simple form @xmath74 with an optimal value of unity .",
    "[ fig : pop_figure ] summarizes the results of the optimization procedure .",
    "it compares the optimized population transfer of a fairly large condensate consisting of @xmath75 atoms to the case of the same condensate subject to on  resonance bragg scattering . in this example , the genetic algorithm involved a one - point - crossover , a two - point - crossover and an average cross - over mating operator .",
    "in addition , it included two mutation operators with mutation rates of 0.8 and 0.4 , and two creep operators , both at a rate of 0.9 , but different creep parameters , a `` coarse '' creep with @xmath76 and a `` finer '' creep operator with @xmath77 . more details of the simulations are given in the appendix .     and transverse width @xmath78 ; @xmath79 and @xmath80 , @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",

    "the vertical dotted line denotes the time it takes to resonantly transfer all population to the quasi - mode @xmath70 in a linear two - mode system .",
    "[ fig : pop_figure ] ]    while it can be expected that resonant bragg scattering at the appropriate frequency transfers perfectly the population of a small condensate from mode @xmath69 to mode @xmath70 , such is not the case for the large condensate we investigated ( dashed line in fig.[fig : pop_figure ] ) . in this case , the mean - field nonlinearity of the condensate is no longer negligible .",
    "it dynamically shifts the bragg resonance @xcite so that the transfer efficiency drops to barely over @xmath85 and the maximum transfer occurs later in time .",
    "it is in such nontrivial situations that genetic algorithms are expected to be useful .",
    "indeed , the optimal time - dependent detuning @xmath6 found by the genetic algorithm is highly non - trivial .",
    "the temporal dependence of the detuning @xmath6 , which transfers more than @xmath86 of the population to the quasi - mode @xmath70 , reveals that while it is initially advantageous to remain close to the bragg resonance frequency , as indicated by the rather flat portion of the detuning , it eventually becomes necessary to drastically couple the condensate atoms to higher momentum modes so as to drag the remaining population to the final state @xmath70 @xcite .    the effect of the mean - field energy is further illustrated in fig .",

    "in contrast to the previous example , we now want to control two properties of the quantum state , the relative phase as well as the population in each state .",
    "the fitness function to be optimized is therefore more complicated .",
    "we choose to employ a so - called `` penalty function ''",
    "@xmath96 for the optimization of the quasi - mode populations @xcite .",
    "the goal of @xmath96 is to decrease the fitness of chromosomes that do not fulfill the desired requirements , thereby steering the population towards the target values .",
    "a prototype penalty function is @xmath97 the fitness function for this optimization problem is then given by @xmath98 where , as we recall , @xmath44 corresponds to a specific realization of the time - dependent detuning @xmath6 and @xmath99 is the relative phase corresponding to this realization .",
    "this fitness function reaches its maximum , unity in this case , when the populations are within the specified range and the phase difference is exactly as prescribed . the results for the optimization for the two cases @xmath100 and @xmath101 are shown in fig .",

    "in summary , we have demonstrated the usefulness of genetic algorithms in the control and manipulation of the quantum states of bose - einstein condensates .",

    ". the more credit an operator accumulates the higher will be its new fitness and the more likely it is that it will be chosen in future mating processes .",
