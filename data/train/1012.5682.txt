    "chemical reactors are of fundamental importance in a large array of scientific fields , spanning applications in chemistry and chemical engineering @xcite , mechanical and aerospace engineering @xcite , atmospheric and oceanic sciences @xcite , astronomy and plasma physics @xcite ; as well as generally in any numbers of biologically related fields ( _ viz . _",
    "@xcite for example ) .",
    "more fundamentally it is the basic prevalence of these dynamic reactive chemical systems in nature that makes the ability to effectively model them so essential",
    ".    from a theoretical point of view , much of the underlying theory for reactor systems may be found in @xcite , where generally reactor systems may be derived using kinetic theory by way of a chapman  enskog or hilbert type perturbative expansion , which immediately raises a set of important concerns that are far beyond the present scope of this paper ( see for example @xcite for an example of the formal complications that may arise in rigorous treatments ) .",
    "here we rather restrict ourselves to the study of a set of simplifications leading to a generalized system of reaction - diffusion equations , that may be referred to collectively as _",
    "quiescent reactors_.    the foundational theory provides that _ quiescent reactor systems _ may be derived explicitly from fluid particle systems ( _ i.e. _ the boltzmann equation ) , where the _ reaction diffusion multivariate master equation _",
    "@xcite serves as the rigorous justification underlying the model . from the point of view of the experimental sciences",
    ", a quiescent reactor may be defined as a chemical reactor system where no explicit stirring is either present or plays a significant role in the dynamic behavior of the medium .",
    "it must be noted however , that often in these quiescent experimental systems , as seen in @xcite , heat gradients may be utilized for chemical catalysis .",
    "because of the complicated formal coupling between state variables , in particular those of density @xmath8 , temperature @xmath9 and internal energy @xmath10 , all of which may have the effect of imparting local velocity gradients on fluids elements , we restrict ourselves in this paper to isothermal systems , and define a quiescent reactor as one which , up to the transport properties of the system , is diffusion dominated in the sense of the fickian regime ( which we expand upon below ) ; or , more precisely , may be modeled up to an implicit stochasticity as a system of reaction - diffusion equations @xcite .",
    "more clearly , from the point of view of the simplified mathematics of the system , such a restriction to the quiescent regime may be presented as any flow system obeying ( [ quiescent ] ) which satisfies the following approximate bound : @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the flow velocity of the system , and where when the formal inequality holds ( _ i.e. _ for @xmath13 in [ bound1 ] ) , the quiescent approximation is particularly strong",
    ". formally we can say that if the concentration and velocity gradients are comparable @xmath14 for each constituent @xmath15 and each component @xmath16 , or even more strongly whenever @xmath17 , then if the velocity components are bounded from above by @xmath18 , then ( [ bound1 ] ) is satisfied , and strictly satisfied when the bounds are precise ( _ i.e. _ @xmath19 ) . in the case of , for example",
    ", the chapman - enskog expansion of @xmath20 as developed in , this merely suggests that for a bounded concentration gradient @xmath21 the diffusive gradient @xmath22 is controlled from below such that @xmath23 for @xmath24 having only functional dependencies on the fractional weighting of the other constituents of the fluid .",
    "by contrast , when the diffusion coefficient is taken to be constant such that @xmath25 , it follows that in local areas of appreciable concentration , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath26 , the advection must scale with diffusive collisions , and similarly in areas of measurable velocities it is the concentration gradient which must scale with the collisional motions .",
    "from the point of view of the physics and chemistry of the system , a diffusion dominated flow regime is merely one in which the random collisional molecular motion of the fluid dominates the advective flow characteristic .",
    "such systems are frequently used as approximate models to restrict to systems that implicitly contain substantially more complicated dynamics ( _ e.g. _ such as in combustion models @xcite ) .",
    "in fact , it is remarkable the number of complicated and important physical phenomena that are understood merely by way of modeling coupled reaction - diffusion equations .",
    "for example , the spatially distributed fitzhugh - nagumo model is a reaction - diffusion system of primary importance in tracking the formation , propagation and recovery of action potentials in biological and artificial neural networks @xcite .",
    "in fact the nagumo formulation @xcite ( of which the fitzhugh - nagumo model may viewed as a special case ) for single component reaction - diffusion models comprises the core of the underlying mathematics responsible for the chemical basis of morphogenesis in biological processes ( _ e.g. _ the kolmogorov - petrovsky - piskunov ( kpp ) equation ) @xcite .",
    "fisher s equation is also a biologically relevant reaction - diffusion system , and is used for modeling the propagation of genetic variation over sample populations @xcite , while in plasma physics the modeling of multicomponent reactive hot plasmas are often reduced down to systems of coupled reaction - diffusion equations @xcite . additionally , reaction - diffusion models are of central importance in the study of phase - field models @xcite and nonequilibrium thermodynamics ( we provide a detailed discussion of the latter in ) , just to mention a very sparse few .    one important and emergent feature of coupled reaction - diffusion systems is the nuance that arises in understanding that a _ diffusion dominated _ regime is not necessarily a _ diffusion limited _ regime  _",
    "e.g. _ in the sense of the standard parlance of analytic chemistry @xcite .",
    "that is , the diffusion rates ( or diffusion `` velocity '' ) will limit the reaction front in a reaction whose",
    "kinetics occur on shorter timescales than the particles diffuse ( which is a _ diffusion limited _ process ) , but in a reaction with timescales that are appreciably longer than the timescales of the diffusion rates of the systems components , the chemical reaction rate can becomes the limiting process ( _ i.e. _ a _ reaction limited _ process ) , and the diffusion regime switches from a _ diffusion limited _ process to a fully _ diffusion dominated _ process .",
    "in contrast , when the reaction rates occur much faster than the diffusion rates , and when the domain is for example homogenized , then we see a fully _ reaction dominated process_. notice that different parts of the domain may be characterizes by different regimes .",
    "it should further be noted , as discussed for example in @xcite and @xcite , that frequently one encounters a full decoupling between the reactive and elastic regimes when the reactive time scales are much slower than those of the dissipative time scales .",
    "this does not , however , account for the popular engineering trend towards multiscale applications @xcite , where substantial differences in reaction and diffusing timescales may be present and yet still coupled through a standard reactor regime .",
    "in fact , it is precisely this difference in relative timescales between the diffusion processes of the system and the reaction processes of the system which makes developing a general numerical scheme difficult .",
    "one generally finds , when solving a parabolic system , that the stability condition on the timestep @xmath27 makes formulating an explicit solution unattractive , and implicit methods are favoured .",
    "however , in generalized quiescent reactor systems the timescales of the reactive components of the system may vary wildly in the effective scaling ( _ viz .",
    "_ reactions rates on the order of @xmath28 to @xmath29 in standard units ) , while the diffusion scaling may demonstrate substantially less variation .",
    "because of this , the time - stepping limitations in quiescent reactor models may be either strongly reaction limited , or strongly diffusion limited , or both  in the sense of oscillating between the regimes , or being split across the regimes .",
    "that is , in reactor systems , where many different reactions may be occurring simultaneously , the depletion of a certain constituent @xmath3 at time @xmath30 may cause a local in time transition from a _ reaction dominated _ time - stepping regime to a _ diffusion dominated _ or _ diffusion limited _ time - stepping regime , and _ vice verse _ ( in the sense of the operator - splitting regimes of @xcite ) . or , as may occur , parts of the domain may be dominated by constituents which are inert with respect to each other , are uncoupled , and which consequently operate with respect to fundamentally different regimes ( _ i.e. _ _ diffusion _ versus _ reaction limited _ regimes ) .",
    "it must be additionally noted here that this distinction is in many ways a simplification of what can be a very subtle interplay between the reactive and diffusive modes present in complicated reactive mixtures .",
    "for example , it is well known that fick s law of diffusion is in some cases ill - suited for describing the behavior of some hysteretic mixtures , or diffusion regimes with memory ( _ e.g. _ such as the electrochemistry induced near an active electrolytic cell @xcite ) . in these cases , the local propagation speed caused by the gradient of the concentration forces the fick s component of the diffusion to obey a telegraph equation , which may often reduce to an integro  differential equation over all time @xmath31 $ ] coupled to a mass transport equation in the reactive components .",
    "these complications arise in systems that demonstrate large variations in concentrations over short time frames , though a large class of reactions demonstrate even more complicated and subtle behavior that might require the inclusion of quantum effects , such as in @xcite . as a general rule we will not directly address these complications below , as we uniformly make the assumption that the reaction  diffusion system of equations employed is an appropriate approximate model for the system in question .    nevertheless , it is because of both the time - stepping nuance mentioned above , as well as the fact that some systems require maximal resolution of highly localized fluctuations in the concentration in order to be well - suited to the particular model system , that we choose to model our quiescent reactor systems by way of an explicit ldg numerical scheme .",
    "we also note that this particular numerical scheme has the advantage of being relatively easily generalized to advection dominated compressible regimes , in which case capturing numerical shock profiles becomes a concern , and is often more easily dealt with in the explicit formulations .",
    "more specifically , we introduce a generalized approach to modeling quiescent reactor systems , the theory of which is largely inspired by ref .  @xcite . in",
    "we provide a formulation of the model problem , then develop the temporal discretization and numerical method for performing a predictor multi - corrector over the chemical modes of the system .",
    "we proceed by showing a fairly standard discontinuous galerkin spatial discretization , and discuss in some detail the iterative methods used along with the temporal mode splitting .",
    "let us also note here that a number of very nice numerical approaches to reaction - diffusion systems already exist in the literature .",
    "in addition to the very nice operator splitting methods in the temporal space that employ the strang method formalism @xcite and its _ entropic structure _ , petrov - galerkin ( supg ) residual methods have been applied @xcite , fully adaptive finite volume ( multiresolution ) methods have been proposed @xcite , in addition to compact implicit integration factor ( ciff , iff , ciff2,etd ) methods over adaptive spatial meshes @xcite , and particle trajectory based methods @xcite , in addition to the stochastic methods dealing with substantially more complicated molecular scale data @xcite . moreover ,",
    "exponential convergence results have been shown for @xmath5-adaptive reaction - diffusion systems @xcite where boundary layer data must be retained in order to achieve full convergence . in this context",
    "we introduce the first  to our knowledge  spatially dimension independent @xmath5-adaptive operator splitting ssp rkdg predictor multi - corrector scheme for fully generalized reaction  diffusion systems of equations with functionally dependent parameters ( _ e.g. _ @xmath32 ) .    in",
    "we derive the exact entropy relation satisfied by the system , which is borrowed and extended from the regularity analysis of @xcite , then applying this entropy functional in order to develop an @xmath5-adaptive scheme that is fully entropy - consistent  which is to say entropy - preserving and bounded  relying only on the global @xmath33 and local @xmath34 entropy densities , as well as the local change in the density of the entropic jump @xmath35 .",
    "finally , in we present some example applications ( that were developed in part using a c++ finite element library @xcite ) .",
    "we address the complication arising from reactive / diffusion dominated / limited regimes explicitly , where we provide four example applications , one which is strongly _ reaction dominated _ in some areas and _ diffusion limited _ in others ( a set of fast hypergolic combustion reactions ) , one which is strongly _ diffusion dominated _ in some areas and _ reaction limited _ in others ( a set of gas - phase alkyl halide atomic transition metal reactions ) , and one that oscillates between all four regimes ( autocatalysis in excitable media across oscillating reactions ) .",
    "finally we utilize an equilibrium system in order to demonstrate the standard and expected error convergence results for the method .",
    "consider the stationary reaction - diffusion system , which in chemistry and chemical engineering contexts generalizes our notion of a quiescent reactor , comprised of @xmath36 , species in @xmath37 or @xmath1 spatial dimensions , satisfying the system of equations : @xmath38 with initial - boundary data given by @xmath39 taking arbitrary functions @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 restricted to the boundary , where @xmath43 is the unit outward normal and @xmath44 the unit tangent vector at the boundary @xmath45 .",
    "here @xmath3 is the concentration of the @xmath15-th chemical constituent , the @xmath46 are the inter - species diffusion coefficients which form an @xmath47 tensor that characterizes the directional dependence on the concentration and its gradient , while @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the forward and backward stoichiometric coefficients of elementary reaction @xmath50 ( if @xmath51 is not elementary then @xmath52 ) , and @xmath53 are the respective forward and backward reactions rates of reaction @xmath51 .    more precisely , we are interested in systems comprised of @xmath54 distinct chemical species @xmath55 ( recalling that each constituent s corresponding concentration is given by @xmath3 ) indexed by @xmath56 elementary chemical reactions , for @xmath57 where @xmath58[{$\\ \\ k_{b , r } \\ \\ $ } ] } \\sum_{k\\in\\mathscr{p}^{r}}\\nu_{k , r}^{b } \\mathfrak{m}_{k},\\quad \\mathrm{for } \\",
    "r\\in\\mathfrak{r},\\ ] ] and where @xmath59 characterizes the forward rate of reaction @xmath51 , and @xmath60 the backward rate of reaction @xmath51 .",
    "the indexing sets @xmath61 and @xmath62 are the reactant and product sets @xmath63 for reaction @xmath51 , respectively .",
    "the @xmath64 s are the stoichiometric coefficients @xmath65 of the products and reagents , and for elementary ( or fully reduced form ) chemical reactions are positive integers @xmath66 when @xmath67 or @xmath68 , since in elementary reactions atoms may only react as absolute entities ( which is to say in whole number quantities ) .",
    "furthermore , all chemical constituents of the flow are either reactants or products , where inert species may be viewed as the product of a unimolecular reaction denoted @xmath69 , where @xmath70 for all @xmath71 and @xmath72 , such that we may view @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "let us proceed by introducing the following @xmath54 dimensional state vectors : @xmath75 and additionally defining the `` auxiliary variable '' @xmath76 , such that using @xmath77 we may recast ( [ quiescent ] ) as the coupled system , @xmath78 where we denote the spatial gradient as , @xmath79    then we solve ( [ quiescentaux ] ) by employing a predictor multi - corrector method coupled to an rkdg scheme which is solved over a reaction mode time - splitting .",
    "let us first describe the solution vaguely in terms of three basic steps .",
    "in the first step , we use a predictor multi - corrector method to solve ( [ quiescentaux ] ) , where we exploit the fact that a partially decoupled version of the reaction source term may be solved analytically in order to generate a prediction of the concentrations ( @xmath3 s ) at each timestep . this predictor",
    "is then corrected by way of a fixed point iteration . in the second step ,",
    "we solve the components of ( [ quiescent ] ) in the usual dg formulation , by integrating against test functions in space and determining local approximations for each of those terms , respectively , were we use an arbitrary order time integrator .",
    "finally , the third step simply requires determining the `` fast '' and `` slow '' modes with respect to the reactivity of the system , such that for some smallest positive @xmath2 we may iterate our solution until @xmath80 , where we then proceed with the same procedure over all the reacting modes ( _ i.e. _ for each @xmath81 ) .",
    "the following sections are devoted to deriving this methodology .",
    "first notice that the reaction term @xmath82 may be viewed as the source of a proliferating set of nontrivial numerical difficulties .",
    "that is , not only is it well known that @xmath83 may cause numerical instabilities due to the varying `` fast '' and `` slow '' timescales discussed above , but due to the presence of nonlinearities arising from the stoichiometric coefficients @xmath84 , the @xmath85 term is responsible for generating a coupled system of @xmath54 highly nonlinear first order ordinary differential equations .",
    "thus , in order to formulate a computationally realistic numerical method for solving our system ( [ quiescentt ] ) over some modest ( yet realistic ) number of constituents @xmath54 , we find it necessary to employ the following linearization .",
    "let us first denote the vector @xmath86 as @xmath87 where @xmath88 is treated as constant for all @xmath89 .",
    "in other words , we wish to think of @xmath86 as the mass action vector such that all but @xmath90 is treated as temporally inert .    then using this notation , we proceed by considering the system of equations ( [ quiescentaux ] ) and discretizing in time , such that at time @xmath91 we are interested in solving the semi - implicit system of equations : @xmath92    the predictor term @xmath93 is predicated on the notion that we may `` predict '' the approximate value of the coupled reaction rate of each species @xmath55 at time @xmath91 by decoupling the @xmath54-th order system of first order ordinary differential equations containing the nonlinear @xmath94 and @xmath95 factors ( as seen in ( [ quiescent ] ) ) by simply using an analytic rate law derived with respect to the value at the previous timestep @xmath30 .    that is , for the @xmath15-th molecular constituent @xmath55 we predict its concentration @xmath3 at time @xmath91 , in either the reactant or product well ( _ i.e. _ in the reaction coordinate representation ) , by analytically solving the following first order ordinary differential equation , @xmath96 we solve the integrated rate law in time over a discrete timestep @xmath97 , such that we obtain an analytic form for each @xmath98 in terms of the solution at the previous timestep @xmath30 treated as constants ( again as denoted @xmath88 in the term @xmath99 for all species of index @xmath89 ) .",
    "we refer to these solutions ( of ( [ fir ] ) ) as the `` predicted values '' of @xmath100 and denote them either componentwise by @xmath98 or in vector form by @xmath101 .",
    "now , of course , the term @xmath93 abstractly represents the rate of change of the concentrations @xmath3 s at time @xmath91 , while the vector @xmath102 will be an averaged form of the predicted total concentration at time @xmath91 .",
    "thus , in order to find the rate of change predictor in the residual representation @xmath93 we simply find the formal difference , @xmath103    next we implement a fixed point iteration corrector over @xmath104 iterates in order to provide convergence in the solution @xmath105 .",
    "that is , for fixed timestep @xmath106 we denote the @xmath15-th corrector of ( [ quiescentt ] ) , implementing our predictor to find a corrector over each iterate @xmath107 , via : @xmath108 it is important here to recall that the @xmath109 s are explicitly determined by the derived analytic solutions to ( [ fir ] ) , which depend on the specific reaction system .",
    "it is also worth noting that ( [ fir ] ) is solved iteratively in the sense that @xmath110 is integrated over @xmath106 to form what is the analytic rate law of the new predictor at the @xmath111-st iterate of timestep @xmath91 .",
    "note here that we have chosen a splitting between the explicit diffusion terms and the semi - implicit reaction terms , which we have found ( by trial and error ) to be the correct splitting to maximize the robustness of our method , with respect to both fast and complicated multistable reaction regimes ( see for examples ) .",
    "the endpoint of the iteration @xmath112 is chosen in tandem with the following bound on the `` relative change '' of the iterated corrector componentwise in @xmath16 , ( _ i.e. _ the component @xmath113 ) : @xmath114 for a judicially chosen constant @xmath115 ( _ e.g. _ see where @xmath116 ) .",
    "in fact , we set a slightly stronger condition than ( [ converge ] ) , after spatial discretization in the discontinuous galerkin setting , as we provide componentwise convergence in the above sense with respect to each quadrature point .",
    "note that we must converge componentwise in each chemical species @xmath117 , since the relative orders of concentrations over @xmath7 may substantially vary , such that while the rate limiting products may readily converge , the coupled ancillary products may oscillate wildly , and _ vice versa_. in order to circumvent this pathology , we demand convergence componentwise globally in space for each timestep .",
    "now let use discretize in space .",
    "take an open @xmath118 with boundary @xmath119 , given @xmath120 such that @xmath121 .",
    "let @xmath122 denote the partition of the closure of the polygonal triangulation of @xmath123 , which we denote @xmath124 , into a finite number of polygonal elements denoted @xmath125 , such that @xmath126 , for @xmath127 the number of elements in @xmath124 . in this work",
    "we define the mesh diameter @xmath128 to satisfy @xmath129 for the distance function @xmath130 and elementwise edge vertices @xmath131 when the mesh is structured and regular . for unstructured meshes",
    "we mean the average value of @xmath128 over the mesh .    now , let @xmath132 denote the edge shared by two neighboring elements @xmath133 and @xmath134 , and for @xmath135 define the indexing set @xmath136 is a neighbor of @xmath137 . let us denote all boundary edges of @xmath133 contained in @xmath138 by @xmath139 and letting @xmath140 define @xmath141 is an edge of @xmath137 such that @xmath142 for @xmath143 when @xmath144 , @xmath145 . then for @xmath146 , we have @xmath147    we are interested in obtaining an approximate solution to @xmath148 at time @xmath149 on the finite dimensional space of discontinuous piecewise polynomial functions over @xmath123 restricted to @xmath122 , given as @xmath150 for @xmath151 the space of degree @xmath152 polynomials over @xmath133 .",
    "choosing a set of degree @xmath153 polynomial basis functions @xmath154 for @xmath155 we can denote the state vector at time @xmath149 over @xmath124 , by @xmath156 where the @xmath157 s are the finite element shape functions in the dg setting , and the @xmath158 s correspond to the nodal unknowns .",
    "the finite dimensional test functions @xmath159 are characterized by @xmath160 where @xmath161 and @xmath162 are the nodal values of the test functions in each @xmath133 , and with the broken sobolev space over the partition @xmath122 defined by @xmath163    we thus multiply ( [ quiescentpred ] ) by the test functions @xmath164 and @xmath165 and then integrate locally over elements @xmath133 in space , defining global scalar products , @xmath166 , such that we obtain the system : @xmath167    we proceed by approximating each term of ( [ dgsteady ] ) in the usual dg sense .",
    "that is , we approximate the first term on the left in the first equation in ( [ dgsteady ] ) by , @xmath168    now , let @xmath169 be the unit outward normal to @xmath170 on @xmath132 , and let @xmath171 and @xmath172 denote the values of @xmath173 on @xmath132 considered from the interior and the exterior of @xmath133 , respectively .",
    "then the second term of the first equation in ( [ dgsteady ] ) , after an integration by parts , yields , @xmath174 such that we approximate the first term on the right in ( [ diffusion ] ) using a generalized viscous flux @xmath175 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) across the boundary , where upon setting @xmath176 , we approximate @xmath177 while the second term in ( [ diffusion ] ) is approximated by : @xmath178    the reaction term in ( [ dgsteady ] ) , which is dealt with using the predictor multi - corrector , is projecting into the basis in the obvious way , @xmath179 where the second and third equations in ( [ dgsteady ] ) are approximated componentwise in the usual sense , simply setting : @xmath180    finally , for the fourth equation in ( [ dgsteady ] ) a numerical flux is chosen which satisfies : @xmath181      combining ( [ timeterm ] ) , and ( [ viscousreact1])([penaltyreact1 ] ) while setting @xmath182 , we formulate our approximate solution to ( [ quiescent ] ) via ( [ quiescentpred ] ) which by construction may be stated as : for each @xmath183 , @xmath184 $ ] and @xmath185 , find the pair @xmath186 such that :    @xmath187    here , @xmath188 is a projection operator onto the space of discontinuous piecewise polynomials @xmath189 , and where below we always utilize a standard @xmath190projection , given for a function @xmath191 such that our approximate projection @xmath192 is obtained by solving , @xmath193    the gradient projection @xmath194 merely approximates the initial gradients using numerical difference quotients , for example below we frequently employ the approximate fourth order scheme : @xmath195    now , it follows that ( [ aproxreact ] ) is a solution for any reaction scheme of arbitrary order satisfying the _ law of mass action _ ( [ quiescent ] ) , whether or not the reactions in @xmath196 are elementary , and regardless of the reaction order ( _ e.g. _ mixed reaction orders of arbitrary type that change order during the course of the reaction , and fractional order reactions , _",
    "etc_. )    we conclude using a standard time discretization for ( [ aproxreact ] ) , where we employ a family of ssp ( strong stability preserving ) runge - kutta schemes as discussed in @xcite . that is , we may abstractly represent our ode in ( [ aproxreact ] ) by @xmath197 , such that previously the first order forward euler time discretization was assumed ( equation b in ( [ aproxreact ] ) ) .",
    "however , to generalize to a @xmath198 stage ssp runge - kutta method of order @xmath199 ( which we denote @xmath200 ) , we simply augment the second equation in ( [ aproxreact ] ) in the diffusion terms by : @xmath201 where @xmath202 can be viewed as the abstract diffusion operator , and the solution at the @xmath54th timestep is given as @xmath203 and at the @xmath54th plus first timestep by @xmath204 , where @xmath205 .",
    "the order @xmath199 of the method is fully determined by the choice of the coefficients @xmath206 and @xmath207 in the butcher tableau .",
    "more clearly , the abstract operator @xmath208 does not alter the mass action term containing @xmath209 in ( [ aproxreact ] ) .",
    "that is , as already explained in the predictor multi - corrector scheme provides an approximate solution chosen with respect to a distinct temporal integrator which is strongly dependent on the exact solution of a partially decoupled system of odes ; and is thus taken outside the runge - kutta loop .",
    "it remains to identify the `` fast '' @xmath210 and `` slow '' @xmath211 modes of the system with respect to the form of the equations ( [ quiescentaux ] often occurring on substantially different time scales , as illustrated in @xcite .",
    "however , the fast modes and the slow modes separate not only with respect to the reaction coordinate ( as determined by @xmath212 ) , but also separate with respect to the interspecies diffusion as determined by fick s law , which may also be decomposed into fast and slow moving modes . to account for this complication",
    "we simply decompose the concentration over `` fast '' @xmath213 and `` slow '' @xmath214 variables , using @xmath215 .",
    "such an operator splitting into fast and slow modes has been thoroughly presented in @xcite , and is known to lead to a fully well - posed system of reaction - diffusion equations , providing the existence of an _ entropic structure _ and a partial equilibrium manifold .",
    "the _ entropic structure _ discussed in @xcite is quite strong however , requiring for example the existence of a @xmath216 monotone entropy functional .",
    "clearly in the context of our approximate variational solution ( [ aproxreact ] ) this constraint is too restrictive ( esp .",
    "with respect to a discontinuous polynomial basis and with an eye towards generalizing in order to easily extend our formalism to the reactive multicomponent navier  stokes regimes , for example ) .    thus in order to stabilize our method we introduce an exact entropic restriction as outlined in below , based on the analytic well - posedness results of a.  vasseur , t.  goudon and c.  caputo @xcite , which depends strongly on an explicit analytic entropy functional @xmath6 .",
    "we enforce entropy consistency on our solution , which provides for the usual monotonicity constraint on the systems entropy , but we further expand this constraint and then utilize the entropy consistent scheme as a foundation for a dynamic @xmath5-adaptive strategy as fully derived in .",
    "we further note that the notion of `` fast '' and `` slow '' modes here is made to highlight a qualitative choice , where the physics of the system may , of course , be substantially more complicated .",
    "that is , for simplicity in our derivation , we have assumed that the rate laws split into no more than two distinct sets , of `` fast '' and `` slow ; '' while there may of course be @xmath217 arbitrary such sets representing @xmath217 grouped rates each of a quantitatively different order of magnitude . while in some physical systems it is essential to neglect the chemical kinetics of reactions occurring on substantially different timescales ( _ e.g. _ neutrino production rates in atmospheric chemistry , _",
    "etc_. ) , in many settings ( such as in environmental science , for example ) it is important to include reactions occurring in a number of different phases ( _ i.e. _ ice , water , water vapour , _ etc . _ ) , which can have a large array of different timescales for their coupled rates laws . more explicitly , in standard units",
    ", common chemical reaction rates can differ in a particular setting and choice of units up to some twenty orders of magnitude .",
    "thus the solution obtained from ( [ aproxreact ] ) trivially lends itself to these split time discretizations ( @xmath218 , and thus we numerically integrate over the `` faster '' variables ( _ i.e. _ the @xmath219 ) in @xmath210 .",
    "that is , for some smallest positive @xmath2 we recurse our solution until @xmath80 ( thus slightly restricting the permissible choice of @xmath210 ) , where we proceed with the same procedure over all the reacting modes ( _ i.e. _ @xmath220 ) . in this way",
    "we easily acquire the approximate solution over the time split modes .",
    "we are now concerned with an entropy based @xmath5-adaptive methodology which does not depend on the powerful , though often computationally prohibitive , adjoint problem formulation which relies upon the calculation of _ a posteriori _ error estimates and minimization techniques ( _ e.g. _ see @xcite ) .",
    "that is , our method is potentially cheaper computationally , while still maintaining a rigorous foundation based on satisfying _ a priori _ entropy bounds .",
    "we use a formal entropy inequality discovered in @xcite in order to develop a stability analysis of our approximate solutions .    let us derive the entropy of the system @xmath6 over each reaction @xmath56 in the quiescent reactor .",
    "first define the mass action term reactionwise , such that we have @xmath221 now notice that @xmath222 such that in addition to multiplying ( [ quiescent ] ) by @xmath223 and summing , after integration in @xmath224 we obtain the relation : @xmath225 now we use the observation employed in @xcite , which notes that regardless of the form of the @xmath3 s , in a system of elementary reactions there always exist reaction dependent constants @xmath226 for @xmath227 such that the stoichiometry satisfies the following linear relation : @xmath228 and thus yielding formally upon integration of ( [ quiescent ] ) that @xmath229 .",
    "now , we rescale the last term by a constant ( @xmath230 ) which corresponds ( as we show below ) to the standard gibb s free energy of the reaction @xmath231 , such that integrating by parts and passing to the weak form we obtain the inequality : @xmath232 which we rewrite as : @xmath233    that is , the reaction term @xmath234 corresponds to the isothermal gibbs free energy of the reaction , since @xmath235 with reaction quotient @xmath236 given by : @xmath237 and where @xmath238 is simply a rate - scaled prefactor coefficient .",
    "thus , for spontaneous reactions at constant temperature @xmath239 ( the only interesting case for the quiescent reactor systems of the form ( [ quiescent ] ) ) , it follows that @xmath240 .",
    "more precisely notice that we may rewrite ( [ reactiongibbs ] ) as : @xmath241 since it is clear that we have a term of the form @xmath242 such that the product is always positive .    as a consequence",
    "we obtain the scalar entropy @xmath243 over the reaction space @xmath7 .",
    "that is , given bounded initial reaction state density @xmath244 satisfying @xmath245 where @xmath246 is the initial condition , then summing over all reactions @xmath56 we obtain the following inequality on the system for any fixed @xmath54 number of constituents over an unbounded domain : @xmath247 where the first term corresponds to the entropy contribution from the density of states , the second to the contribution from chemical energy production in the reactor , and the third to the entropy contribution due to the random motion of the system .",
    "the entropy relation derived above may be used to generate a local smoothness estimator on the solution of each cell s interior . moreover ,",
    "the entropy @xmath6 is a particularly attractive functional due to the fact that first , it is globally monotonic and convex ( or concave up to the sign convention ) , and also that it is a functional which approximates the local internal energy of the entire solution space in a totally coupled sense . in this way , the entropy functional @xmath6 provides for an easy test of whether the full approximate solution ( [ aproxreact ] ) is entropy consistent in a fully coupled sense , and then , if it is , where inside of @xmath123 the entropy is most variable . in the setting presented in ,",
    "we have assumed a noncompact domain , and thus @xmath6 applies globally in the numerical setting to periodic boundaries , or those employing fully transmissive ( or radiative ) boundary conditions ( _ e.g. _ no forcings on the bcs up to the differential order of the numerical solution ) .",
    "that is , in order to derive the global discrete total entropy @xmath248 at any particular timestep @xmath249 , we may simply integrate in time such that for any discrete @xmath250 $ ] we have : @xmath251 where as above @xmath252 .",
    "generally , we solve ( [ discreteentropy ] ) when @xmath46 is any ( possibly nontrivial ) matrix ( _ e.g. _ see ) , such that in the numerical setting we must compute the following approximation to ( [ entropy ] ) via : @xmath253 given a small positive constant @xmath254 where @xmath255 is the indicator function over the set containing @xmath256 .",
    "similarly , to find an approximation of the discrete local in @xmath257 entropy @xmath258 we simply integrate over an element @xmath133 restricted to @xmath249 , such that we obtain : @xmath259 such that @xmath260 , again with @xmath254 a small positive constant . then we proceed by defining the local in time change in entropy density over @xmath261 as satisfying : @xmath262 where the cell density is taken as @xmath263",
    ".    we use equation ( [ entchange ] ) as an approximate measure of the variation in the local _ internal energy _ with respect to a fixed volume elements ( at timestep @xmath249 ) interior , @xmath261 at constant temperature @xmath239 .",
    "more explicitly , we use ( [ entchange ] ) as a local smoothness estimator over the interior of @xmath133 in order to develop a @xmath264-enrichment functional @xmath265 which estimates the local internal energy of the element as an approximate measure of the smoothness of the solution , such that for @xmath266 the maximum polynomial order allowed on any @xmath133 , and @xmath267 the present polynomial order , we define : @xmath268 where the change in the average global entropy density @xmath269 at @xmath249 is given by @xmath270    the global entropy @xmath271 at timestep @xmath272 is defined fully in , and the global density is simply taken as @xmath273 .",
    "the adjustable parameter @xmath274 is a composite of the range of the entropy change at time @xmath272 and a weight @xmath275 .",
    "that is the function may be written @xmath276 over the midpoint of the range @xmath277 of the change in entropy density @xmath278 clearly ( [ smoothest ] ) has the effect of using the variation in the entropy change locally to weight some fraction of the cells for @xmath264-enrichment and the rest for @xmath264-coarsening , depending only on how far their relative local change in entropy lies from the median of the range .",
    "in contrast to alternative choices for @xmath264-enrichment , this scheme provides for a cogent physical interpretation that serves as buttress for the enrichment strategy .",
    "namely , we see that in areas in which the relative disorder ( _ i.e. _ the relative entropy ) of a cell exceeds a specified allowed variation within the cell itself , then we coarsen our solution , thus avoiding cfl instabilities , _",
    "etc_. likewise in areas of relative order ( or stable smoother regions ) we readily enrich our solution .",
    "we have also tested enrichment strategies based on slightly more abstract principles .",
    "for example , one may simply choose a fraction of elements with respect to the magnitude of their relative change in entropy density , or with respect to @xmath279 by cell .",
    "likewise , when using a hierarchical basis one may use the scheme described in @xcite to measure the perturbative variation in the higher terms with respect to the @xmath280norm .",
    "many of these alternative strategies can lead to stable schemes that effectively `` sense '' relative energy fluctuations with respect the @xmath106 .",
    "however , it should be noted as a word of caution that ( [ smoothest ] ) is particularly well - suited for naturally avoiding the observed phenomenon of _ bunching _ in the local variational space .",
    "this _ bunching _ of the solution often leads to a _ flickering _ of enrichment / coarsening of a substantial number of elements taking values close to the `` center '' of the chosen discriminating parameter ( _ e.g. _ @xmath281 in ( [ smoothest ] ) ) .",
    "this behavior is a potential source of debilitating inefficiency in the scheme , and can be difficult to isolate without recourse to an entropy formalism , or similar .",
    "as already discussed , the global entropy formulation from is predicated on noncompactness of the space @xmath123 , while in general we are interested in more complicated boundary formulations ; in particular any boundary condition satisfying ( [ robin ] ) . in this more general",
    "setting we see that equation ( [ entropy ] ) by way of the divergence theorem becomes : @xmath282 thus , as before , the discrete approximation to ( [ entropybound ] ) simply yields : @xmath283 further , notice that for the appropriate choice of boundary conditions both @xmath284 and @xmath285    now , in the local approximation it is clear enough how to reformulate ( [ discreteentropybound ] ) over cells such that we obtain a local approximation to the entropy in the neighborhood of the cell .",
    "however , for the case of @xmath128-adaptivity we are more directly concerned with the local jump in entropy across the neighboring cells , since it is these jumps which serve as a proper diagnostic probe for stable @xmath5-adaptivity ( _ e.g. _ see @xcite ) .",
    "thus we define the local entropic jump @xmath286 at time @xmath249 by @xmath287 such that the density of the change in the entropic jump @xmath288 is given to satisfy @xmath289    we proceed by estimating the approximate flux of the internal energy of the system by constructing the @xmath128-adaptivity functional @xmath290 where the mesh triangulation @xmath122 at time @xmath291 given by @xmath292 is refined to level @xmath293  that is , we isotropically refine to @xmath294 in each spatial dimension  over cell @xmath133 at time @xmath249 .",
    "similarly we may unrefine @xmath295 to level @xmath296  that is , we isotropically coarsen to @xmath297 in each spatial dimension .",
    "for example , in dimension @xmath298 the refinement would take a quadrilateral parent cell @xmath133 and split it into four child cells @xmath299 , while a coarsening would take four child cells denoted @xmath299 and merge them into a single parent element @xmath133 . thus depending on the evaluation of @xmath300",
    ", we obtain the full @xmath128-adaptivity functional : @xmath301 where @xmath302 correspond to the maximum and minimum refinement levels , respectively . here again , the density of the global change in the entropic jump is given such that : @xmath303 where @xmath304 is the same as in .",
    "also as in , the adjustable parameter @xmath305 is again defined over the range of the change in the entropic jump @xmath306 , and is given by @xmath307 such that @xmath308 and @xmath309 .",
    "it is further interesting to note that the local change in the entropic jump @xmath310 is independent of the reaction entropy at time level @xmath291 , and ends up depending only on the reaction coupling from the earlier timesteps as well as on the present states diffusivity .",
    "that being said , it is clear that just as ( [ smoothest ] ) in effectively @xmath264-enriches the solution based on the local physics of the system , here , we find that ( [ sharpest ] ) has the effect of flagging elements with a high relative change in their entropic jumps for @xmath128-refinement , and those with low relative change in their entropic jumps for @xmath128-coarsening .",
    "that is , in areas where the entropy is changing dramatically across the elements boundary , we refine .",
    "however , when coarsening , we are presented with the additional constraint denoted : @xmath311 .",
    "that is , by @xmath311 we simply mean that in order to actually coarsen a parent element @xmath133 comprised of @xmath16 children elements @xmath312 , each child @xmath299 must be independently flagged for coarsening . in other words ,",
    "all children of an isotropically refined element @xmath133 must contain a coarsen flag at time level @xmath272 in order for the parent cell to ultimately be refined at time level @xmath272 . for more details on this isotropic refinement strategy",
    "we direct the reader to @xcite .",
    "finally , we couple the @xmath128-adaptivity functional @xmath313 to the @xmath264-enrichment functional @xmath314 such that @xmath128-adaptivity is always preferentially chosen over @xmath264-enrichment .",
    "that is , clearly the cell localized entropy @xmath258 and its corresponding entropic jump @xmath286 are strongly coupled by virtue of ( [ quiescent ] ) , but in order to avoid numerical instabilities caused by erroneously @xmath264-enriching relatively inert cells experiencing high entropic fluxes entering through its neighbors , we evaluate the simple kinetic switch functional @xmath315 determined by evaluating : @xmath316 whereby we are able to stabilize these spurious quiescent instabilities , and yet still maintain the entropy consistency of the scheme .",
    "we address several example applications below , and note that all examples in this sections were given reflecting wall boundary conditions , which is just to say that scalar boundary values are determined by their values on the interior at the boundary @xmath317 , and the gradients are reflected with respect to the normal direction @xmath318 , where @xmath319 .",
