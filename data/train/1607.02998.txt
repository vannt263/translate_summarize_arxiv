    "consider a system whose state at time @xmath0 is represented by a vector @xmath1 in @xmath2 . in applications the dynamics of such a system are often described by specifying how @xmath1 changes as a function of the current state @xmath1 . in a deterministic setup",
    "this is typically expressed in terms of an ordinary differential equation .",
    "if , on the other hand , @xmath1 is random , it may be viewed as a markov process whose local dynamics can be specified in terms of a stochastic differential equation , its infinitesimal generator , its local semimartingale characteristics , or its symbol . as in the deterministic case",
    ", this immediately leads to the question of existence and uniqueness of a stochastic process exhibiting the given local dynamics .",
    "this can be rephrased in terms of existence and uniqueness of the solution to a corresponding martingale problem .",
    "existence is known to hold under relatively weak continuity conditions , cf .",

    "e.g.  @xcite .",
    "the situation is less obvious for processes with jumps .",
    "lipschitz conditions only help for generators which have a natural representation as an sde , which often is not the case .",
    "ellipticity , on the other hand , requires a continuous martingale part to be present , which often is not the case either .",
    "this piece of research is motivated by the desire to come up with a general uniqueness result for markov processes that may not have a continuous martingale part or a natural representation as a sde . in this context",
    "we share the point of view of @xcite that it is natural to study markov processes through their symbol .",
    "indeed , e.g.  weak convergence of a sequence of levy processes corresponds to pointwise convergence of their symbols .    from the analogy to ode s",
    "one may expect uniqueness to hold if the symbol of the process depends smoothly on the state @xmath1 .",
    "unfortunately , smoothness alone does not seem to suffice in order to warrant uniqueness . in section [ s : examples ] we present two examples of even analytic symbols where uniqueness in law of the corresponding markov process does not hold .",
    "this is the first main result of this paper .",
    "these examples also show that the law of a polynomial process in the sense of @xcite is not in general uniquely determined by its generator .",
    "section [ s : exuni ] contains a positive result , which is the second main contribution of this paper .",
    "it is shown that the combination of sufficient smoothness and ellipticity warrants uniqueness in law .",
    "in contrast to ( * ? ? ? * theorem 4.3 ) and related results , the continuous martingale part may vanish .",
    "the probably closest relative to our theorem [ satz : eindeutigkeit unter elliptizitaet neu ] below is ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 2.8 ) which also relies on smoothness and ellipticity of the symbol .",
    "however , bttcher requires a certain boundedness for derivatives of any order while we need this condition only for finitely many derivatives .",
    "nevertheless , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 2.8 ) is not a special case of our theorem [ satz : eindeutigkeit unter elliptizitaet neu ] below .",
    "another closely related result is ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 5.24 ) which , however , requires the symbol to be real .",
    "uniqueness results have been obtained by a number of different approaches , cf .",
    "@xcite for an overview . from a very rough perspective ,",
    "the most commonly used techniques are    * sde methods where uniqueness is often obtained from fixed - point arguments , * construction of a solution to the backward equation , i.e.  construction of solutions for the associated abstract cauchy problem , and * so - called interlacing techniques which allow to add finitely many jumps .",
    "by contrast , our approach is based on establishing stability of the univariate marginals relative to a properly chosen distance .",
    "this kind of reasoning seems to be new and it constitutes the third main contribution of this paper .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in section [",
    "s : symbol ] we recall various notions and properties concerning symbols and martingale problems .",
    "moreover , we state an existence result which follows from ( * ? ? ?",
