    "experimental data about elastic , inelastic and total cross - sections of @xmath1-scattering at energy @xmath2 tev will be obtained at the lhc .",
    "the most interesting objects of study in this energy region are the asymptotic behaviour of cross - sections at high energy , approaching of the froissart limit and the behaviour of the ratio @xmath3 at @xmath4 .",
    "also the mechanism of a possible deviation of that ratio from the value @xmath5 ( black disk model ) is of interest .",
    "the theoretical considerations to these problems are closely related to the unitarization of the elastic scattering amplitude @xcite , @xcite . as a rule , for the unitarization of an amplitude one uses the eikonal approximation .",
    "it is well known that the eikonal approximation complies with the unitarity equation for the elastic amplitude only in a region of small scattering angles and large impact parameters .    in this paper",
    ", we obtain a solution of the unitarity equation in terms of expansion coefficients of the elastic amplitude as a function on the @xmath0 group , introduced in @xcite-@xcite .",
    "this approach allows us to generalize the eikonal formalism of the impact parameter to the large angle region and the small phase system volume of collided particles .",
    "at first , we note the main points of solution of the unitarity equation in terms of the partial waves .",
    "let us consider two particle elastic process @xmath6 , fig .",
    "[ unitarnost_1 ] .",
    "the unitarity equation is a consequence of @xmath7 matrix unitarity ",
    "@xmath8 : @xmath9 using the expansion of the unity operator in fock space and the translation invariance of the operator @xmath10 , as a result of standard operations @xcite one obtains the equation on the elastic amplitude @xmath11 : @xmath12 here @xmath13 @xmath14 is the sign of the projection of scattered particle momenta on the z - axis , @xmath15 .",
    "the first term on the righthand side of equation ( [ vid_perepisi ] ) describes a two - particle contribution to the spectral density of the elastic amplitude , fig .",
    "[ unitarnost_1 ] .",
    "the second term corresponds to inelastic intermediate states . for derivation of ( [ vid_perepisi ] )",
    "we use an integral relation which is valid for an arbitrary function @xmath16 : @xmath17    due to the momentum conservation we have @xmath18 .",
    "the matrix element of the @xmath19-operator is related to the matrix element of the @xmath10-operator in the following way : @xmath20 the first and the second arguments of @xmath21 correspond to the final and the initial momenta of the scattered particle in the center - of - mass system ( c.m.s . ) respectively .",
    "the factor @xmath22 is related to the relative velocity in c.m.s . by a relation : @xmath23 , @xmath24 are the energies of colliding particles in c.m.s .",
    "assuming @xmath25 in the initial equation ( [ vid_perepisi ] ) , it is easy to obtain the optical theorem : @xmath26 where @xmath27 @xmath28    _ _ ]    presently , only one consistent method of solving equation ( [ vid_perepisi ] ) is known .",
    "this method is based on the expansion of the amplitude @xmath21 over the representation of the group @xmath29 , which is realized by legendre polynomials @xmath30 : @xmath31    substituting expansion ( [ fotri ] ) into the unitarity equation ( [ vid_perepisi ] ) , one obtains that @xmath32 satisfies the following @xmath33 here @xmath34 @xmath35 solving equation ( [ al ] ) one obtains the following representation for the partial amplitude @xmath32 : @xmath36 where @xmath37 is an arbitrary real phase .",
    "this is a well known result of the elastic amplitude unitarization in terms of coefficients of its expansion on the @xmath29 group . such description of scattering in terms of partial waves @xmath32 is effective in low energy region , since the amplitude @xmath38 is saturated by the lowest terms of expansion ( [ fotri ] ) .",
    "but , in a high energy region all terms in the sum ( [ fotri ] ) become important , and the use of integration instead of summation is needed . the procedure of changeover to",
    "the integration corresponds to the eikonal quasi - classic approach : @xmath39 where @xmath40 has to be understood as an impact parameter , @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "hence , the expression for the amplitude ( [ fotri ] ) changes to the eikonal representation : @xmath43 here @xmath44 in that case ( [ econal ] ) , @xmath45 would satisfy condition ( [ al ] ) .    however , here one has a problem : the eikonal amplitude ( [ econal ] ) with the profile function ( [ abp ] ) does not satisfy the initial unitarity equation ( [ vid_perepisi ] ) .",
    "the reason for that is that bessel functions @xmath46 do not form an orthogonal system in the physical interval of values @xmath47 i.e. @xmath48    in this paper , we attempt to solve the above mentioned problem in the context of the theoretical - group generalization of the impact parameter and obtain the unitarity equation in terms of profile functions @xmath49 . in our formalism , the impact parameter @xmath40 is interpreted as a vector of the maximal approach between two particles in c.m.s .",
    "let us point the main steps of our formalism .",
    "first , we construct a quantum analog of the impact parameter . as a basis",
    "we take the expression for components of the vector of maximal approach @xcite : @xmath50 where @xmath51 is a relative momentum of two particles , @xmath52 is a relative orbital moment in c.m.s ..",
    "we take the expression ( [ 8 ] ) as a basis for the construction of a quantum analog of the impact parameter .",
    "the canonical commutation relation between a relative momentum and a relative coordinate lies in the basis of quantanization ( here and later @xmath53 ) : @xmath54=i\\delta _ { ij}~.\\ ] ] then we perform the transition to the quantum description that consists in the standard procedure of the substitution of the @xmath55-numbers by the corresponding operators in the relation ( [ 8 ] ) and in the reduction of it to hermitian form .",
    "this leads us to the following system of the commutation relations : @xmath56=0 , \\quad [ l_{i}d_{j}]=i\\varepsilon_{ijk}d_{k}~,\\\\ & [ l_{i}l_{j}]=i\\varepsilon_{ijk}l_{k } , \\quad [ d_{i}d_{j}]=\\frac{-i}{q^{2}}\\varepsilon_{ijk}l_{k}~.   \\end{split}\\ ] ] the additial term in @xmath57 operator appears due to the requirement of hermisity . the relations ( [ algebra1 ] ) show that operators @xmath58 and @xmath59 form an algebra @xmath60 on the sphere @xmath61 .",
    "the casimir operator of this algebra is a pure number : @xmath62 therefore we can not use the full algebra ( [ algebra1 ] ) for the construction of a wave function with defined impact parameter .",
    "one way to build a wave function with defined impact parameter consists in a selection of a nontrivial subalgebra of ( [ algebra1 ] ) @xcite .",
    "the natural choice is @xmath63 operators .",
    "they form the following algebra : @xmath64&=-\\frac{i}{q^2 } l_3 \\\\ [ d_1 l_3]&=-i d_2 \\\\ [ d_2 l_3]&=i d_1   \\end{split}\\ ] ] this is the algebra of @xmath65 group .",
    "the properties of the @xmath65 group are studied in detail in the monograph of n.j.vilenkin @xcite , and also in @xcite .",
    "this group is noncompact and has the basic continued family of the unitary representation and the discrete finite - dimensional family of the nonunitary representation in the space of quadratically integrable function .",
    "the casimir operator of algebra ( [ algebra2 ] ) is @xmath66=0\\ , \\",
    "[ d_{3}\\hat{k}]\\neq 0~.\\ ] ]    as the next step , let us consider the following system of equations @xmath67 in this equation we interpret the eigenvalue of the casimir operator @xmath68 as a squared impact parameter or as a squared transverse component of the maximal approach vector of two colliding particles .",
    "using the explicit form of operators @xmath69 in the momentum space we obtain the particular solution at @xmath70 : @xmath71 where @xmath72 is an azimuth angle of momentum @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , and @xmath76 so , @xmath77 represents the wave function of two - particle state in the momentum space with the defined value of the squared impact parameter @xmath68 .",
    "the spectrum restriction @xmath78 reflects the uncertainty relation for the phase space of two - particle system .",
    "it limits small @xmath68 region at fixed value of momentum @xmath73 .    the connection between @xmath77 and the eikonal representation kernel ( [ fotri ] ) follows from the fock expansion of the cone function @xcite : @xmath79    as it was shown in @xcite , @xcite , the system of functions @xmath80 forms an orthogonal and complete basis independently for each of the two parts of the momentum space @xmath81 and @xmath82 ( so called forward and backward semi - spheres ) : @xmath83 @xmath84    the analog of the legendre expansion ( [ fotri ] ) is the expansion of amplitude @xmath85 as a function on the group @xmath0 over the basis of @xmath86 : @xmath87 where we introduce the cone variables : @xmath88 we call the expansion coefficient @xmath89 in ( [ amplituda_vvide ] ) the profile function on the group @xmath0 .",
    "substituting the expansion ( [ amplituda_vvide ] ) into the initial equation ( [ vid_perepisi ] ) , we obtain the unitarity condition for the profile functions @xmath89 on the group @xmath90 : @xmath91 where @xmath92    the equation ( [ localunitarn ] ) is the main result of this article .",
    "it differs from the unitarity relation for @xmath32 ( [ al ] ) by a presence of the signature @xmath14 .",
    "the appearance of signature @xmath14 allows us to consider scattering amplitudes independently in forward and backward semi - sphere .    in course of the derivation of ( [ localunitarn ] ) we used the summation theorem for spherical legendre functions @xcite , @xcite : @xmath93    for convinience we rewrite @xmath94 from ( [ ginel ] ) in the following parametric form : @xmath95 the parameter @xmath96 plays the role of a standard inelastic coefficient and it varies within bounds @xmath97 .",
    "the expression for cross - sections in terms of the profile functions @xmath98 follows from the optical theorem ( [ optt ] ) and the relation ( [ localunitarn ] ) . @xmath99",
    "as an application we discuss the simplest phenomenological models for the profile function @xmath98 , which is consistent with unitarity condition ( [ localunitarn ] ) .",
    "let us divide the interval of the impact parameter @xmath40 values in three parts :    * @xmath100 - the interval of forbidden @xmath40-values due to the condition @xmath101 , * @xmath102 - the interval of full reflection , * @xmath103 - the interval of full absorption .",
    "first we assume that @xmath104 , which corresponds to the full absorption target .",
    "in that case we have @xmath105 in the whole area of the disk @xmath106 . the unitarity condition ( [ localunitarn ] )",
    "takes the form @xmath107 the solution of the equation ( [ localunit ] ) is @xmath108 hence , for the cross - sections @xmath109 and @xmath110 we obtain : @xmath111 for the case of @xmath112 we find @xmath113 thus , using ( [ localunitarn ] ) we obtain well known results for the black disk model .",
    "now we consider the model of the full reflection disk , or in other words let @xmath114 be equal @xmath115 .",
    "in this case we have @xmath116 the unitarity relation ( [ localunitarn ] ) takes the form @xmath117 we rewrite this relation as follows @xmath118 where @xmath119    the solution of equation ( [ perepis ] ) is @xmath120 where @xmath121 is an arbitrary real phase .",
    "so , we see that the amplitude of scattering into a backward semi - sphere @xmath122 plays a role of the effective absorption coefficient for the scattering amplitude into forward semi - sphere @xmath123",
    ".    let us define the absolute elastic scattering on a disk with radius @xmath124 as the scattering with parameters @xmath125 in this case we have : @xmath126 then for the elastic scattering we obtain @xmath127 and for the cross - section ratio we have @xmath128      the integration interval for @xmath129 in cross - sections @xmath109 and @xmath110 is divided into the interval of full reflection ( @xmath130 ) and the interval of full absorption ( @xmath131 ) as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ structura ] . here",
    "@xmath132 using obtained in the sections * iii.a * and * iii.b * expressions for @xmath123 , @xmath122 , @xmath133 and the expression for cross - section ( [ ssigma ] ) , it is easy to find that @xmath134 thus , for the cross - section ratio we obtain @xmath135 where @xmath136 the values of @xmath137 lie within the range @xmath138 . the limit value @xmath139 is reached for @xmath140 , which corresponds to the case of the full reflection .",
    "the limit value @xmath141 is reached for @xmath142 , which corresponds to the case of the full absorption . in the region of the phase valume @xmath143",
    ", we can obtain : @xmath144     from @xmath145 _ _ ]    the results of the numerical calculations of integrals ( [ chastotn ] ) at @xmath2 tev and @xmath146f are shown in fig .",
    "[ otnoshenies ] .",
    "one can see that the deviation of the ratio @xmath3 from the value of @xmath147 starts in the region , where @xmath145 is of order @xmath124 . in the region of @xmath148",
    "the value of @xmath3 changes sharply and converges to 1 .",
    "thus , the unitarity saturation takes place on an object with a very narrow full absorption periphery , @xmath149 . in other words ,",
    "the unitarity saturation results from the processes of scattering to backward semi - sphere ( also called reflective scattering ) .",
    "there is a prediction for the ratio of cross - section @xmath3 reaching the value of @xmath150 at lhc energies @xmath2 tev @xcite . for these values , from relation ( [ chastotn ] ) we have @xmath151f .",
    "thus , we conclude that , for the energies @xmath2 tev , the size of the full reflection region is almost of the same order as the size of the full absorption region .",
    "in the present paper , we have shown that the unitarity equation for the elastic processes can be rewritten in terms of the profile functions @xmath152 , where @xmath40 is the generalization of the impact parameter in the context of the group - theoretical approach @xcite . in such terms",
