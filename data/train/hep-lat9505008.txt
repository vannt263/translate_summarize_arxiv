    "the possibility of restoration of spontaneously broken symmetry in the electroweak theory at high temperature has recently led to a renewed interest in the electroweak phase transition @xcite .    since the seminal and pioneering paper by kirzhnits and linde @xcite , considerable effort has been devoted to describe the rather involved processes occurring very close to the critical temperature .",
    "the effective potential has shown great usefulness .",
    "it gives the free energy as a function of the magnetization .",
    "there are perturbative computations combined with @xmath1 expansions for the effective potential @xcite , and also numerical results based on monte carlo simulations and on three dimensional reduced actions @xcite .",
    "nevertheless the perturbative calculations have shown to be plagued with problems which are to a large extent due to infrared divergences and are manifested in the appearance of spurious complex terms in the expansion for the effective potential .",
    "a great amount of work has been done to obtain meaningful expressions very close to the critical surface .",
    "most of these attempts are related to the resummation of an infinite number of daisy and superdaisy diagrams which have to be taken into account in a consistent perturbative expansion , because they are of the same order of magnitude in the coupling constants @xcite .",
    "another very successful approach was proposed by buchmller et al .",
    "@xcite , who use an improved perturbation expansion for the effective potential , where the dynamically generated plasma masses are already included in the corresponding expressions from the beginning .",
    "these plasma masses are computed up to one loop order by self - consistent gap - equations , and have the effect of damping the infrared divergences . in this context , in @xcite the absence of linear terms in the scalar field of the effective potential was explicitly verified for the abelian higgs model , up to the order @xmath2 and @xmath3 , and proved to remain valid at higher orders .",
    "such a linear term contains spurious infrared divergent contributions .    despite the important and promising contributions to the understanding of the nature of the phase transition that have already been made , there are still ambiguities to be explained and higher order corrections to be included consistently to ensure the survival of the predictions to all orders .",
    "we propose an alternative variational two - step method to study phase transitions at finite temperature in the electroweak theory , and in related models .",
    "it consists first in the calculation of a coarse grained free energy by perturbative methods , obtaining a 3-dimensional perfect lattice action as a function of a block spin field .",
    "their coefficients depend explicitly on the temperature . in a second step",
    ", the feynman - bogoliubov method can be used with this 3-dimensional lattice action to obtain the best quadratic approximation to the perfect action , and therefore the best split into a free part and an interaction . using this , the constraint effective potential can be computed .",
    "to lowest order , the masses are obtained in this way as solutions of a gap equation whose formal solution is the sum of superdaisy diagrams for the 3-dimensional lattice theory .",
    "they depend on temperature .",
    "higher order corrections can be computed in principle .",
    "these masses are to be inserted into the expression for the constraint effective potential .",
    "this procedure separates the uv- and ir - problems in a clean way .",
    "it allows to study the perfect 3-dimensional lattice action directly by numerical simulations .",
    "one could for instance compute the constraint effective potential numerically .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 3 the block spin transformation for the scalar fields at zero temperature",
    "is discussed .",
    "the evaluation of the perfect scalar action at t=0 is explained and the extension to finite temperature is outlined . an explicit computation of the leading terms of the perfect action for the @xmath4theory is shown here as well . in section 4",
    "the feynman - bogoliubov method is applied to the lattice action of the previous section and a comparison with other approaches is performed here and in appendix [ dimred ] . in section 5",
    "we extend the procedure to the maxwell theory at zero temperature .",
    "in particular , the averaging operator for abelian gauge fields , the perfect lattice action , the gauge fixing and the interpolation kernel are discussed .",
    "the block spin of baaban and jaffe for the abelian gauge field is used @xcite . in section 6 the procedure",
    "is extended to scalar electrodynamics . here the main features of the extension of the perfect lattice action to finite temperature are outlined and some quantities which are needed for perturbative calculations are exhibited .",
    "a short version of the results of this paper was presented at lattice 94 in bielefeld @xcite .",
    "to prepare for the block spin transformation at finite temperature , we recall first the well known relation between free propagators at zero temperature and at finite temperature @xmath5    because of translation invariance , the standard free propagators in euclidian space time depend on a single variable @xmath6 . the zero temperature propagator has the form @xmath7 } ^{-1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    a finite temperature field theory lives on a euclidean space time which is periodic in time direction with period @xmath8 , i.e. on a tube .",
    "propagators admit a well known random walk representation .",
    "the difference between zero and finite temperature stems from the possibility that these random walks may wind around the tube several times .",
    "accordingly , the finite temperature propagator @xmath9 is obtained from @xmath10 by periodizing in time .",

    "to introduce our method we start with a theory with scalar fields only .",
    "we consider first the @xmath16 case and define the blockspin , the effective action , the interpolation operator and the fluctuation field propagator",
    ". then we deal with the @xmath17 case i.e. with the generalizations of the above mentioned entities . as an illustration",

    "@xmath60 and @xmath61 in coordinate space @xmath62    following gawedzki and kupiainen @xcite one splits the field @xmath63 into a low frequency part , which is determined by the block spin @xmath47 , and a high frequency or fluctuation field @xmath64 which has vanishing block average .",
    "@xmath65 because of the extremality property of @xmath66 , the kinetic energy splits @xmath67 from this one sees that the free massless propagator for the block spin @xmath56 equals @xmath68 .",
    "since @xmath69 , we have @xmath70    the measure splits @xmath71 the @xmath64-dependent factor is proportional to a gaussian measure with covariance ( free propagator ) @xmath72 @xmath73 the limit @xmath74 can be taken if desired , and results in @xcite @xmath75 the interpolation kernel @xmath76 of @xmath77 has a fourier expansion like @xmath28 in eq .",

    "our 3-dimensional fields still have the same dimension as the original 4-dimensional ones .",
    "this could be remedied by a rescaling by @xmath96 .",
    "we prefer not to do so because eq.([leffsc ] ) below looks very natural .",
    "since we do not rescale the block spin @xmath56 in position space the appropriate 3-dimensional integration measure contains a factor @xmath97 and the 3-dimensional @xmath98-functions a corresponding factor @xmath99 , as follows .",
    "@xmath100    in momentum space it is correspondingly .",
    "to adjust to the finite temperature situation , we need to periodize the @xmath16 quantities in time in the manner described in section 2 .",
