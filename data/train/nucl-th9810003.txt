    "an essential but also a very complex and complicated problem of modern physics is the structure of matter under extreme conditions of temperature and/or density .",
    "the equation of state of hot dense matter is a key ingredient for many branches of modern physics . to mention in this respect are , for instance , the understanding of the physics of the early universe , supernova explosions and protoneutron stars , respectively .",
    "a further important example are high - energy heavy - ion collisions , which provide , at present , the only laboratory means to study the behaviour of hot and dense matter . in the literature",
    "one can roughly distinguish between two theoretical attempts to investigate the equation of state , namly the non - relativistic and relativistic approaches .",
    "the majority of the relativistic treatments are performed in the framework of the relativistic hartree approximation and only a few investigations use the relativistic hartree - fock or relativistic brckner - hartree - fock approximation ( see , for instance , refs .",
    "@xcite-@xcite ) .",
    "the majority of the theoretical treatments utilize the non - relativistic scheme , using either effective density dependent interactions or the brckner approach @xcite-@xcite .    in this investigation",
    "we are going to extend a recent modern thomas - fermi approach of myers and wiatecki @xcite-@xcite to the equation of state at finite temperatures ( see also ref .",
    "furthermore we will briefly discuss the question of neutron star matter and the equation of state for higher asymmetries , respectively .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : first , we recapitulate fore the sake of completeness in section  [ sec2 ] the basic structure of the thomas - fermi model @xcite for density and momentum dependent interactions .",
    "the extension of the model to finite temperatures is given in section  [ sec3 ] .",
    "section  [ sec4 ] deals with the results of the model and the last section is a summary of the results with conclusions .",
    "we shall not recapitulate the basic assumptions and limitations of the thomas - fermi model in nuclear physics , since they are described in greater detail in the pioneering work of myers and wiatecki @xcite . in the modern version they use an effective interaction of the following structure (",
    "@xmath1 denotes the isospin ) : @xmath2 with the following definition : @xmath3 here , @xmath4 , @xmath5 denote the ( proton or neutron ) density at the locations @xmath6 and @xmath7 , respectively .",
    "the density at equilibrium is @xmath8 , and the fermi momentum and the fermi kinetic energies are given by [ @xmath9 : @xmath10 @xmath11 @xmath12 by means of the parameters @xmath13 and @xmath14 the interaction distinguishes the forces between nucleons of the same kind ( upper sign ) and of different kind ( lower sign ) . with the parameter @xmath15 one",
    "adjusts mainly the binding properties of nuclear matter .",
    "the repulsion is described by the momentum dependent term @xmath16 .",
    "since this repulsion turns out to be too strong for higher relative momenta , one corrects this deficit by the term @xmath17 . in order to obtain better values for higher asymmetries ,",
    "the authors have chosen @xmath18 in contrast to former structures of seyler and blanchard @xcite .",
    "the term proportional to @xmath19 takes care for a better agreement with the nuclear optical potential ( for more details , see refs .",
    "@xcite-@xcite ) .",
    "fore our task the model contains six free parameters ( in the expression for the energy the parameters @xmath20 and @xmath21 enter only in the combination @xmath22 ) and they are given in table  i. for the space dependence the standard yukawa form is employed , i.e. : @xmath23 the energy per nucleon in the thomas - fermi model is given by : @xmath24 with the single - particle potential : @xmath25 or more explicitly : @xmath26 .",

    "the results of this model for cold matter are described in more detail in refs .",
    "@xcite-@xcite and agree rather well with the values of the semiempirical droplet mass formula .",
    "interesting is also the equation of state ( eos ) for cold neutron star matter , which is characterized by the generalized @xmath20-equilibrium between nucleons and leptons , i.e. electrons and muons ( for more details , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . one has to obbey in this case the additional constraint for the chemical potentials , i.e. : @xmath43 and charge neutrality between the protons and the leptons : @xmath44 the eos for this case is contained in figs .  1 and 2 .",
    "the generalization of the thomas - fermi model for finite temperatures is formally more or less staightforward , since one has mainly to incorporate the fermi distribution functions into the scheme for zero temperature .",
    "one obtains then for the energy per nucleon : @xmath46 with the temperature dependent single particle potential : @xmath47 and the density is now given by : @xmath48 the fermi distribution function , @xmath49 , is defined as ( @xmath50 ) : @xmath51 where @xmath52 denotes the single - particle energy : @xmath53 with the single particle energy one can rewrite the energy per nucleon as : @xmath54 due to the momentum dependence of the single particle potential one can also introduce an effective mass via : @xmath55 for finite temperatures one needs the free energy in order to obtain the pressure and the chemical potentials .",
    "the free energy per baryon is given by : @xmath56 with the entropy per baryon , @xmath57 : @xmath58 the expressions for the chemical potentials and the pressure are : @xmath59 ( @xmath60 in eq . [ fermi ] is different to @xmath61 , since the interaction is density dependent , see appendix a of ref .",
    "@xcite ) and @xmath62 more explicit expressions are given in ref . @xcite .",
    "first we show in figs .  1 and 2 for the sake of completeness the eos for cold nuclear matter with different asymmetries [ @xmath63 and neutron star matter . in figs .  3 and 4",
    "the eos for symmetric nuclear matter ( @xmath64 ) and pure neutron matter ( @xmath65 ) is displayed for different temperatures . for small densities , below @xmath66 @xmath67 , one obtains as expected , the behaviour of a free fermi gas with a linear temperature dependence , since the nucleon - nucleon force has a small range .",
    "for increasing density the eos exhibits a quadratic temperature dependence , since in the temperature range smaller than the fermi temperature a quadratic temperature dependence @xmath68 holds ( see refs .",
    "the chemical potential @xmath69 , the pressure , the free energy per baryon and the entropy per baryon for symmetric matter are exhibited in figs .  5 , 6 , 7 and 8 for different temperatures .",
    "the values of the entropy per baryon are in good agreement with experimental results ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , this is important , since the entropy per baryon is also a nessesary ingredient for the calculation of protoneutron stars ( see e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite ) .    due to the non - monotonic behaviour of the isotherms",
    "one can infer that these systems undergo a liquid - gas phase transition .",
    "such a transition , which may occur in warm matter produced in heavy - ion collisions , is one of the most interesting problems in modern nuclear physics .",
    "several groups are investigating this problem by studying multifragmentation , where the coexistence of nuclear fragments and free nucleons could be considered as a signal for the transition phase ( see , for instance , refs .",
    "the critical temperature can be obtained by a maxwell construction .",
    "the situation can be either viewed in the @xmath70-@xmath71-diagram or in the @xmath69-@xmath70-diagram , respectively .",
    "both views are given for symmetric nuclear matter in figs .",
    "9 and 10 , respectively .",
    "gibbs condition of phase equilibrium demands that pressure , temperature and chemical potential are equal in the two phases .    as can be seen from the eoss the nuclear matter incompressibility decreases with increasing temperature . as a consequence one should exspect a limiting temperature , at wich",
    "a self - bound system can still exist in hydrostatic equilibrium ( @xmath72 ) .",
    "beyond this temperature , the so - called flash temperature @xmath73 , the unbound system starts expanding @xcite .",
    "the isothermal incompressibility is defined as : @xmath74 and is zero at the point where the minimum pressure reaches the zero pressure line ( here at a density of @xmath75 @xmath67 ) .",
    "we obtain for the flash temperature the value 15.61 mev which is , as expected , smaller than the critical temperature @xmath76 , because at @xmath76 the pressure is already positive ( see fig .",
    "if one increases the asymmetry of the system the critical temperature and the critical density decrease .",
    "these dependencies are depicted in figs .",
    "11 and 12 . for asymmetries larger than 0.853",
    "the liquid - gas phase coexistence disappears in our model .",
    "we have calculated the eos for cold and warm nuclear matter for different asymmetries using the approach of myers and wiatecki .",
    "almost all non - relativistic calculations give critical temperatures in the range of 14 - 22 mev and critical densities of approximately @xmath77 of the saturation density @xcite , which is in accordance with our results .",
    "investigations for finite temperatures are relatively scare and the model seems to provide a simple theoretical tool for investigating the nuclear eos in such ranges , which seems to be of greater interest , since it becomes now possible by means of the heavy - ion physics to study the behaviour of matter different from the saturation point , which is an essential ingredient in the theory of neutron stars and supernova explosions and also in the interpolation of heavy - ion collisions @xcite .    in our opinion , it seems worthwhile , due to its simplizity and exellent agreement with nuclear data , to use this model with possible improvements in the further non - relativistic investigations of the eos .",
    "also the properties of neutron stars seem to be in accordance with this approach @xcite .",
