    "since the achievement of bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) with a sample of @xmath0cr - atoms @xcite the interest in dipolar quantum gases has strongly increased @xcite . recently , the progress towards quantum degenerate polar molecules has pushed this interest even further because they possess electric dipole moments of the order of one debye and , therefore , are potential candidates to make dipolar effects more accessible to experiments @xcite .",
    "concerning dipolar bosonic particles , the field is relatively well understood and has seen a robust development with a remarkable quantitative agreement between experiment and theory . starting point was the construction of a pseudopotential by yi and you @xcite . in the thomas - fermi regime , where the kinetic energy can be neglected in comparison with the interaction energy , exact solutions of the gross - pitaevskii equation have been found for axially symmetric harmonic traps @xcite .",
    "further generalizations to triaxially anisotropic traps even provided the first clear experimental signature of the dipole - dipole interaction ( ddi ) in the data for the expansion dynamics @xcite . in the meantime , collisional control of chromium has been fully demonstrated by using feshbach resonances to increase the relative importance of the ddi with respect to the contact interaction . as a result , strong dipolar effects have been observed in becs like the suppression of the characteristic inversion of the aspect ratio during the expansion @xcite .",
    "in addition , the trap configuration could be manipulated to stabilize a purely dipolar bec @xcite and a new type of bose - nova experiment beautifully revealed a d - wave symmetry in a dipolar bec @xcite . besides that , the anisotropic nature of the ddi is predicted to shift the bose - einstein condensation temperature in a characteristic way @xcite , and considering spinorial degrees of freedom might provide an atomic realization of the einstein - de haas effect @xcite .    in view of fermionic dipolar quantum gases ,",
    "amazing predictions have been made . in the case of homogeneous gases , interesting properties like zero sound @xcite , berezinskii - kosterlitz - thouless phase transition @xcite , and nematic phases",
    "@xcite have been considered , while studies of trapped dipolar gases focus on anisotropic superfluidity in three dimensions @xcite , fractional quantum hall states @xcite , and wigner crystallization in rotating two - dimensional systems @xcite .",
    "from the experimental point of view there are different possibilities of realizing dipolar fermi gases .",
    "one of them is to use atoms which have large permanent magnetic dipole moments @xmath1 , such as the isotope @xmath2cr of chromium , which has a dipole moment of six bohr magnetons @xmath3 and has already been magneto - optically trapped @xcite or the isotope @xmath4yb of ytterbium , which has @xmath5 in the @xmath6-state and has already been cooled down to quantum degeneracy @xcite . in addition , recent developments in laser cooling of the isotope @xmath7dy of dysprosium , with a magnetic dipole moment of the order @xmath8 , promises to increase the variety of highly magnetic atomic gases in the quantum degenerate regime @xcite . a further exciting possibility is displayed by samples of heteronuclear polar molecules . for them ,",
    "prospects for collisional control through applied electric fields @xcite indicate that dipolar gases could be explored all the way from the weak- ( collisionless ) to the strong - interaction ( hydrodynamic ) regime , since this may lead to interaction strengths changing by orders of magnitude depending on the applied electric field @xcite .",
    "this is in close analogy to the use of feshbach resonances to tune the contact interaction to unitarity as has been carried out with success to observe hydrodynamic behavior in the normal phase of atomic fermi gases @xcite .",
    "experimentally this is very promising and , recently , @xmath9 fermionic @xmath10k@xmath11rb molecules with an electric dipole moment of about @xmath12 debye have been brought close to quantum degeneracy by using stimulated raman adiabatic passage to efficiently convert the molecules into the rovibrational ground state @xcite .",
    "after that , further progress towards probing quantum degeneracy has been made , by bringing this system into the hyperfine ground state as well @xcite . in the meantime , krb - samples at the temperature @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the fermi temperature , have become available , in which thermodynamic measurements led to observation of the anisotropy characteristic of the ddi @xcite .",
    "the first theoretical investigations of such a system were carried out under the assumption of a gaussian density profile , which is able to capture some of the important features as the aspect ratio , but misses the correct weak - interaction , collisionless limit @xcite . on top of that",
    ", other approaches have been pursued including @xcite or neglecting @xcite the possibility of a deformation of the momentum distribution .",
    "however , quantum degenerate heteronuclear polar molecules possess strong dipolar interactions which might lead to a collisional regime combined with an anisotropic momentum distribution .",
    "for this reason , we have recently developed a complete theory for normal dipolar fermi gases in the hydrodynamic regime in the presence of a cylinder - symmetric harmonic trap @xcite . in the present paper",
    "we extend our theory to the general case of a triaxial trap , which allows to study important aspects of the physics of dipolar fermi gases such as the radial quadrupole excitation as well as to sort out the anisotropic effects of the ddi .    in the following",
    "we treat one - component fermionic dipolar quantum gases semi - analytically and tacitly assume that the gas is in the hydrodynamic regime . by adapting a variational time - dependent hartree - fock method , which was originally developed to study nuclear hydrodynamics @xcite , we are able to obtain a complete description of strongly interacting normal dipolar fermi gases which encompasses their static as well as dynamic properties . the paper is organized as follows . in section [ tdvhf ] ,",
    "we outline the variational formalism of hydrodynamics applied throughout the paper . in section [ eom ] , we derive the action governing the dynamics of the system in the case of three different trapping frequencies and extremize it with respect to the widths in spatial and momentum distributions , obtaining , thus , the corresponding equations of motion .",
    "section [ dless_v ] provides the dimensionless variables which make the physical interpretation of the results more enlightening .",
    "then , in section [ stat_prop ] , we derive the equilibrium properties such as the momentum and real space aspect ratios as functions of the dipolar strength and the trap anisotropies .",
    "section [ ll_excit ] is devoted to the low - lying excitations , where we study the oscillations around the equilibrium .",
    "following that , we address in section [ tof_exp ] time - of - flight experiments which represent another fundamental issue in cold atoms physics . in section [ conc ]",

    "@xmath31 is rather irrelevant and polarization leads to a degenerate non - interacting gas . for polar molecules , however , this is no longer valid : moderate electric fields induce dipole moments which render the ddi ( [ ha3 ] ) a prominent contribution to the hamiltonian in eq .",

    "of course , the true exchange correlation is a function of the density alone , as a consequence of the kohn theorem @xcite , and circulation is conserved .",
    "thus , due the presence of the fock exchange term , the hydrodynamic treatment commonly used for dipolar becs @xcite can not immediately be applied to degenerate dipolar fermi gases . for this reason",

    "nevertheless , the equations ( [ conti_0 ] ) and ( [ euler_2nd ] ) are not yet closed due to the lack of knowledge of the non - diagonal terms of the density matrix .",
    "therefore , we resort to a simpler procedure : we extremize action ( [ action_rho0 ] ) with respect to appropriate variational quantities , which bear information on both the diagonal as well as the non - diagonal part of the interaction .",
    "of course , we do loose information in this process because our variational approach may not be as precise as the solution of the complicated equations ( [ hf_eqmot ] ) , but , on the other hand , it gives access to both the statical and dynamical properties of dipolar fermi gases beyond the perturbative regime in a quite simple and clear way .    in order to calculate each of the terms in the action ( [ action_rho0 ] ) , we change to the wigner representation of the time - even one - body density matrix , which is defined according to @xmath90 the inverse transformation reads @xmath91 in the wigner representation all quantities of interest can be expressed in terms of the wigner function ( [ wig_def ] ) .",
    "for example , the particle density is given by @xmath92 and the momentum distribution is obtained via @xmath93 with the help of these quantities , the kinetic energy ( [ kin_0 ] ) and the trapping ( [ trap_0 ] ) energy can be written as @xmath94 respectively .",

    "in contrast , the exchange interaction term ( [ exchang_0 ] ) , given by @xmath96 is rather linked to the momentum distribution ( [ mom_dist ] ) and vanishes if it is isotropic .",
    "the importance of this term in dipolar fermi gases was only recently recognized in ref .",
    "@xcite , where it was shown to lead to a deformed momentum distribution . following this important investigation ,",
    "further effects have been studied by taking this term into account , like its influence on the dynamical properties of cylindrically trapped systems in the collisionless regime @xcite . for homogeneous gases , zero - sound dynamics @xcite as well as quantum phase transitions in two dimensions",
    "@xcite have been investigated by considering also this exchange contribution ( [ int_exc ] ) .    in the following",
    "we extend the static , semi - classical theory of dipolar fermi gases to a dynamical theory in the hydrodynamic regime by including the fock exchange term in a natural way .",
    "actually , as is clear from its derivation , this theory can also be successfully applied to fermionic systems with other types of long - range interactions .",

    "furthermore , we use an ansatz for the wigner function which resembles that of a non - interacting fermi gas in the semiclassical approximation . with this",
    "we cope with the main effect of the ddi that the gas is stretched in the direction of the polarization .",

    "this shift of the level - crossing can be traced back to the fock exchange interaction , which is absent in dipolar bose - einstein condensates .",
    "time - of - flight expansion experiments are a key diagnostic tool in the field of ultracold quantum gases . in bec s , for example , the effects of the magnetic ddi were observed for the first time in @xmath0cr by measuring the time dependence of the aspect ratios for two different polarization directions after release from a triaxial trap @xcite . in this section ,",
    "we explore the corresponding problem for a strong dipolar normal fermi gas .",
    "dipolar effects are expected to be observed in polar molecules , due to their large electric dipole moment .",
    "trapping and cooling these molecules requires a strong confinement in the polarization axes , to assure robustness against collapse .",
    "therefore , the suppression of the attractive part of the ddi indicates that this system is better described by normal hydrodynamics .",
    "initial estimates of the relaxation time for polar molecules suggest that this reasoning remains valid during the whole tof expansion @xcite .",
    "thus , we expect the dynamics of the dipolar fermi gas to be described by the equations @xmath271 together with the conditions for number conservation ( [ dim_less_part_num_conse ] ) and momentum deformation ( [ dim_less_mom_def ] ) .",
    "notice that equation ( [ eqn : dim_less_tf_eqs_tof ] ) differs from ( [ eqn : dim_less_tf_eqs ] ) only due to the absent term @xmath272 , which is responsible for the trapping potential . in the following ,",
    "we discuss the results obtained by solving these equation numerically , using the static values of section [ stat_prop ] for the initial conditions of the parameters @xmath273 and @xmath274 as well as @xmath275 and @xmath276 .    until now",
    ", only axial symmetric traps were involved in experimental investigations of dipolar fermi gases .",
    "nevertheless , we have learned from studies of dipolar becs how useful triaxial traps can be , for instance in the context of time - of - flight experiments .    concerning the momentum space , we obtain in the triaxial case similar results as for the cylinder - symmetric one @xcite , where the aspect ratio @xmath203 becomes asymptotically unity as a result of local equilibrium in the absence of the trap .",
    "the anisotropic aspect ratios @xmath197 and @xmath198 are plotted as functions of time in fig .",
    "[ tof1 ] for @xmath277 and @xmath278 . in the upper and lower graphs we have set @xmath279 and @xmath280 ,",
    "respectively , and we find that both aspect ratios become smaller than @xmath107 in the course of time . also for traps with @xmath281 or @xmath282 , an inversion of the corresponding aspect ratio takes place , but in the opposite direction . such an inversion is typical for the hydrodynamic regime and was already observed for a two - component , normal fermi gas with strong contact interaction @xcite .     while the red ( light grey ) and blue ( dark grey ) curves correspond to the real - space aspect ratios @xmath198 and @xmath197 , respectively .",

    "the trap is characterized by @xmath277 and @xmath278 .",
    "the top curves correspond to @xmath283 while the bottom ones are for @xmath284 . ]",
    "the value @xmath280 , chosen above , corresponds to @xmath285 krb - molecules , with a dipole moment of @xmath286 debye induced by an applied electric field and with trap frequencies characterized by @xmath287 , @xmath277 , and @xmath278 .",
    "simple arguments like the ones given in ref .",
    "@xcite , show that the hydrodynamic character of the expansion holds , at least , for @xmath288 .",
    "given that the trapping frequencies can be changed at will over a wide range , the prospects for observing hydrodynamic expansion in dipolar gases of heteronuclear molecules out of triaxial traps are quite promising .    a further important quantity of the tof - analysis of dipolar fermi gases is the asymptotic values of the aspect ratios . after the expansion the gas becomes more and more dilute and the interaction becomes less and less important , even in the case of long - range ones .",
    "nevertheless , studying the asymptotics in time of the aspect ratios may still be useful because they are approached very fast .",
    "this is particularly relevant for strong pancake traps , where this happens just a few @xmath289 seconds after release of the trap , as is shown in fig .",
    "[ tof1 ] . although we are aware of the inaccuracy of the hydrodynamic approach for small dipole moments , we plot the long - time aspect ratios in fig .  [ tof1_asymp ] for the whole @xmath155 range .",
    "there , we can identify the tendency of the ddi to stretch the gas in the direction of the applied field in real space , whereas the momentum distribution remains always asymptotically spherical .",
    "we would like to remark that the results presented here are in overall disagreement with those obtained by sogo et al . in ref .",
    "@xcite . translating their findings into our notation",
    ", the ballistic formalism predicts an inversion of the aspect ratio only for @xmath290 .",
    "in addition , the aspect ratio in real space @xmath291 asymptotically approaches the one in momentum space @xmath203 for every value of @xmath212 and @xmath155 .",
    "this disagreement stems from the difference in nature of both approaches : while hydrodynamics assumes local equilibrium provided by collisions , the ballistic approach relies on the assumption of no interaction during the expansion .",
    "while the latter might be true for weak interactions , the former seems to be more adequate for strongly interacting gases like the one made out of krb molecules .",
    "after release from the trap .",
    "the dashed curve corresponds to the aspect ratio in momentum space @xmath203 while the red ( light grey ) and blue ( dark grey ) curves correspond to the real - space aspect ratios @xmath198 and @xmath197 , respectively . ]",
    "we have studied both equilibrium and dynamical properties of a normal dipolar fermi gas in a triaxial harmonic trap . using a convenient ansatz for the wigner phase - space function of a normal fermi gas at very low temperatures",
    ", we were able to derive equations of motion which govern the momentum and particle distributions as functions of time , as the trap is shaken or even turned off .",
    "the dynamical theory developed here allows , as a special case , to study equilibrium properties starting from the aspect ratios in real and in momentum space and including the stability diagram .",
    "apart from that , the hydrodynamic low - lying excitations were investigated and a level crossing was found in the spectrum , which corresponds to the spherically symmetric limit of a cylinder - symmetric trap . in the case of a triaxial trap with an external field along one of the axes ,",
    "momentum oscillations were found to be two - dimensional and in - phase , just as for cylinder - symmetric configurations .",
    "in addition , we also considered the expansion of the gas after release from the trap , by solving the equations of motion in the absence of the harmonic trap .",
    "we found that the characteristic inversion of the aspect ratio in the course of time after release from the trap is also present for dipolar fermions and that the fast experimental development of ultracold heteronuclear krb - molecules makes them quite promising candidates for observing these effects .",
    "we shall like to remark that the theory presented here fills an important empty space in the study of normal , strong dipolar fermi gases .",
    "namely , it is applicable in the hydrodynamic regime , where collisions provide local equilibrium .",
    "though the prospects for achieving this regime with heteronuclear molecules are quite exciting , a further gap remains to be filled : due to the possibility of continuously tuning the interaction strength through an applied electric field , a theory capable of interpolating between the collisionless theory of ref .",
    "@xcite and the present hydrodynamic one might be needed in a certain range of the parameter space",
    ".    a couple of applications of the present hydrodynamic theory for dipolar fermi gases could be thought of which would be useful to provide a deeper understanding of these systems .",
    "studying the scissors mode , for example , could shed light on the detection of anisotropic superfluidity .",
    "the response of the system to a rotational field @xmath292 is a further interesting possibility , which allows to investigate the moment of inertia of a dipolar gas relative to different axes .",
