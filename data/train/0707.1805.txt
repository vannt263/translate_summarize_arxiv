    "in the last years , condensed - matter architectures based on josephson - junction qubits have appeared to be promising candidates for quantum information processors.@xcite these solid - state systems can be scaled up to a large number of qubits and satisfy divincenzo s requirements for quantum computing,@xcite i.e.  state preparation , manipulation , and readout . among them , qubits on the basis of the superconducting quantum interference devices ( squid ) offer the possibility of realizing switchable ( inductive ) interbit couplings @xcite and therefore provide promising platforms to generate multipartite entanglements among `` macroscopic '' quantum systems in deterministic ways .",
    "remarkable experimental achievements with flux qubits include the realization of complex single - qubit operation schemes,@xcite the generation of entangled states @xcite in systems of coupled flux qubits,@xcite while the direct measurement of the entanglement in josephson architectures has been performed via state tomography @xcite for two superconducting phase qubits .    within such frameworks",
    ", we proposed a scheme for the generation of a w entangled state in a chain of @xmath1 spatially separated flux qubits by exploiting their sequential couplings with one of them playing the role of an entanglement mediator.@xcite we remind that the @xmath1-partite w entangled state is a natural generalization to @xmath1-qubit state of the tripartite w state @xmath2 , i.e. , the totally symmetric ( apart from possible phase factors ) quantum superposition of @xmath1 two - state systems where only one of them is in its excited state . in ref .",
    ", the success of this scheme relies on the possibilities of both preparing the initial state of the qubits and tuning the coupling energy and/or the interaction time between each qubit and the mediator , provided the time necessary for the desired quantum processes is short enough with respect to the decoherence time .",
    "the protection against noise is evidently one of the central issues in quantum information technology and the reduction of the duration spent for specific quantum operations is important for it . in this paper",
    ", we improve the scheme proposed in ref . by analyzing the dynamics of an _ array _ of flux qubits , which can be selectively coupled in pairs for instance by exploiting the tunable flux transformer proposed by castellano _",
    "et  al._,@xcite and demonstrate how it is possible to _ diffuse _ a w state prepared in one row to two or more rows with a few steps .",
    "such a scheme helps to reduce the time for the generation of multipartite entanglement .",
    "furthermore , we show that the same protocol also provides us with a way to shift , or _",
    ", the w state from row to row .",
    "we emphasize that w states are promising candidates for the experimental realization of quantum information processing in multiparticle systems since they possess entanglement robustness against local operation even under qubit loss .",
    "the idea presented in this paper is based on the theoretical proposal in ref .   to generate a w state in a chain of rf - squid or persistent current ( 3jj ) qubits .",
    "we first recapitulate its essential idea within the present setup illustrated in fig .",

    "this parameter may be adjusted for instance by substituting the third junction with a dc - squid behaving as an effective jj with tunable josephson energy , @xmath7 , @xmath8 being an additional control flux threading the dc - squid loop . in such conditions , by applying an external flux @xmath9 close to a half - integer number of flux quanta , @xmath10 , and choosing @xmath11 the potential energy of the total system forms a double well which permits two stable configurations of minimum energy corresponding to two persistent currents @xmath12 in the loop .",
    "this fact allows to engineer a two - state quantum system ( qubit ) whose effective hamiltonian , in the basis of the two energy eigenstates @xmath13 and @xmath14 of the @xmath15 qubit of the array ( which at @xmath16 , are maximal superpositions of the two persistent - current states @xmath17 and @xmath18 ) , reads @xmath19 where @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 is a pauli operator for the @xmath15th qubit .",
    "the energy spacing , corresponding to a transition frequency @xmath23 typically in the range of microwaves , can be tuned by properly selecting both the tunneling frequency , @xmath24 , between @xmath17 and @xmath18 and @xmath25 both depending on the system parameters .    in the following discussion , we assume that all the qubits have a common energy gap @xmath26 , @xmath27 .",

    "it is possible to control the flux - transfer function , and therefore the inductive - coupling constant , by modulating the critical current of the inner dc - squid of each transformer via an externally applied magnetic flux @xmath29 .",
    "each individual coupling between a pair of qubits is effectively turned on by adjusting the control fluxes of the relevant `` switches '' with all the other `` switches '' kept off .",

    "the coupling constants @xmath35 ( @xmath36 ) between the first and the @xmath37th qubit in the first row can be turned on and off via controlling the magnetic fluxes @xmath29 externally applied to the @xmath15 qubit as shown in fig .",

    "it is therefore possible to generate an @xmath1-partite w state in the first row , among qubits @xmath48 , as follows :    * we prepare the initial state @xmath49 , with only the qubit @xmath50 in the excited state and the rest of the qubits of the array in their own ground state . *",

    "we underline that rapid - single - flux - quantum ( rsfq ) josephson - junction based logic circuits@xcite make it possible to produce flux pulses characterized by rise / fall times @xmath65 of the order of @xmath66 .",
    "therefore we are able to obtain switching times much smaller than the duration of any step in our scheme , typically less than or of the order of the inverse of coupling energy @xmath67 .",
    "let us now discuss schemes for spreading the w state ( [ initial ] ) prepared in the first row of the array to other rows , as well as for transferring it from row to row , by making use of the switchable inductive coupling @xmath68 between each qubit of the @xmath41th row ( @xmath39 ) and the corresponding one in the @xmath69th row . to this end , we consider the following `` collective '' step by step scheme :    * each of the @xmath1 qubits in the first row , already prepared in the w state , is put in inductive interaction with the corresponding one in the second row during @xmath70 , by turning on the couplings @xmath71 , while other qubits evolve freely .",

    "another choice @xmath95 generates @xmath96 transferring the w state ( [ initial ] ) in the first row to the third .",
    "in summary , we have extended the theoretical scheme for the generation of a w entangled state proposed in ref .   to a scheme for an @xmath0 array of qubits .",
    "a remarkable feature is that an entanglement realized as a w state in one row of the array is diffused to two rows and the number of qubits involved in the w state is doubled after a single step .",
    "the entanglement is further diffused all over the array by repeating similar processes to yield an @xmath97-qubit w state .",
    "this procedure would facilitate the generation of a large - scale multipartite w state with fewer steps , and as a result , would help to save time for its generation .",
    "furthermore , we have demonstrated the possibility of transferring the w state prepared in one row to another at will .",
    "we have illustrated these schemes in the context of the inductively coupled flux qubits , but they are also applicable to other systems , provided the qubit - qubit couplings are controllable .",
    "the experimental realization of our proposal is possible , although it has to face various technological challenges .",
    "the fabrication of the proposed circuit is not difficult . moreover , to exploit tunable qubits and flux transformers allows both to strongly reduce the single - qubit parameter disorder and at the same time to select common energy gaps with a disorder of a few percent@xcite and to control the duration of interqubit couplings .",
    "in addition , state preparation can be accurately realized with well - defined procedures including relaxation and single qubit rotations .",
    "a delicate point concerns the system time scales against undesired effects due to the coupling of each qubit with bosonic baths , traceable back to the presence of many unavoidable noise sources .",
    "for instance , the effective impedance characterizing the dissipative electronic circuitry coupled to the single qubit progressively degrades its coherent evolution . the consequent impact on the single qubit decoherence rates and on the performance of a gate of two inductively coupled qubit",
    "have been studied bringing to light that , by carefully engineering the environmental impedances , the bipartite systems is characterized by rates in the range @xmath98@xmath99.@xcite since the observed relaxation and decoherence times for a single flux qubit are in the range @xmath100@xmath101@xcite the passage to a bipartite system speeds up the decoherence process .",
    "thus the present scheme , shortening significantly the generation time of a multipartite w state , provides an effective way to anticipate the occurrence of coherence loss effects .",
    "we assume that the eigenfrequency @xmath102 of a josephson qubit is of the order of @xmath103 and that the inductive qubit - qubit coupling constant is of the order of @xmath104.@xcite under these conditions , the length of a generic step ( during which only a fraction of a rabi oscillation takes place ) is of the order of @xmath105 .",
    "this means that the w state for the @xmath76 array is generated approximately after @xmath106 , which is much shorter than @xmath107 required for the generation of a 9-partite w state by the scheme discussed in ref .  .",
    "extending this argument to a larger array ( for instance , to a @xmath108 array ) , we find that the generation of an entangled state of @xmath109 qubits ( which requires 8 steps ) is roughly compatible with the currently observed relaxation times , @xmath110 , characterizing two coupled qubits .",
    "we wish to emphasize that this estimation is suitable in our case , since during each step we deal with non interacting bipartite systems of inductively coupled qubits .",
    "if we access only one qubit at a step to entangle multiple qubits , such a large - scale entanglement can not be established within such limited time .",
