    "radio studies of supernovae ( sne ) can provide valuable information about the density structure of the circumstellar medium , the late stages of stellar mass - loss , and independent distance estimates for the host galaxies @xcite .",
    "furthermore , with the growing realisation that some gamma - ray bursts may be intimately linked with sne [ e.g. , grb980425 and sn  1998bw @xcite ; grb011121 and sn  2001ke @xcite ; grb030329 and sn  2003dh @xcite ] , such studies are crucial to understanding grb environments . to date , radio emission has only ever been detected from core - collapse sne of type ii and type ib / c [ for a recent review of supernova taxonomy , see @xcite ] , and not at all from thermonuclear type  ia sne .",
    "supernova  2001ig was discovered visually by @xcite on 2001 dec 10.43 ut in the outskirts of the nearby late - type spiral galaxy ngc  7424 ( @xmath0  mpc ; @xcite ) .",
    "no supernovae have been recorded previously in this galaxy .",
    "initial optical spectroscopy of sn  2001ig from las campanas observatory @xcite revealed similarities to the type  iib sn  1987k @xcite , while spectra from the european southern observatory over the following month @xcite showed a similar behaviour to that of the type  iib sn  1993j , by transitioning from type  ii to type ib / c as the h recombination lines weakened . by october 2002 , the transition to a type ib / c in the nebular phase was well and truly complete @xcite .",
    "sn  2001ig was also detected by the acis - s instrument on board the _ chandra _ x - ray observatory on 2002 may  22 ut with a 0.2 - 10.0  kev luminosity @xmath1  erg  s@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "a second observation three weeks later showed that the x - ray luminosity had halved in that time @xcite .",
    "radio monitoring of sn  2001ig with the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) commenced within a week of its discovery , and has continued on a regular basis . in section  [",
    "s : data ] , we present multi - frequency radio flux data from the first 700  days .",
    "we describe our attempts to fit the radio ` light curves ' with a circumstellar interaction model in section  [ s : model ] , and discuss the deviations from this model in more detail in section  [ s : disc ] .",
    "our conclusions are presented in section  [ s : conc ] .",
    "table  [ t : fluxes ] contains the complete log of radio flux measurements from the atca .",
    "column  2 lists the days elapsed since explosion , which is derived from the model fitting in section  [ s : model ] .",
    "total time on - source ranged from as little as 2  hours , up to a full 12  hour synthesis , but was typically 46 hours . since the atca is capable of observing in 2 frequency bands simultaneously , determining fluxes in 4 frequency bands on the same day required time - sharing .",
    "dual - frequency observations centered on 18.75 and 18.88  ghz and bandwidths of 128  mhz were carried out using a prototype receiver system on just three atca antennas .",
    "the central frequencies of the other bands are 8.640 , 4.790 , 2.496 , and 1.376  ghz , and the bandwidth is 128  mhz . from 2002",
    "july  11 onwards , the s - band central frequency was changed from 2.496 to 2.368  ghz , to reduce the amount of in - band interference .",
    "the atca primary flux calibrator , pks  b1934 - 638 has been observed once per run , while observations of the nearby source pks  b2310 - 417 allow us to monitor and correct for variations in gain and phase during each run .",
    "[ cols=\"<,>,>,>,>,>,^ \" , ]     the spectral index @xmath3 of sn  2001ig is virtually identical to sn  1993j , but less steep than sn  2001gd .",
    "however , the rate of decline @xmath4 is much steeper in sn  2001ig than in either of the other type iib s , and the time to reach peak 5  ghz flux is also much shorter . in this respect ,",
    "sn  2001ig has behaved more like a type ib / c sn than most `` normal '' type  ii sne .",
    "the interpolated peak 5  ghz luminosity would be about twice that attained by sn  1993j , though in practice sn  2001ig was near a local minimum in the flux at that time , and the actual peak was not reached for another 40  days .    using the methodology outlined in @xcite and @xcite",
    ", we can derive an estimate of the progenitor s mass - loss rate , based on its radio absorption properties .",
    "substituting our model fit results above into their equation  11 , and assuming both @xmath5 and @xmath6 contribute to the absorption , then @xmath7 in equation  13 , and not @xmath8 .",
    "we prefer the term `` homogeneous '' here over `` uniform '' , since the latter could give the misleading impression of no density gradient at all , whereas an @xmath9 dependence of density is implicit . ] , we find that    @xmath10    where @xmath11 is the mass - loss wind velocity , and the ejecta velocity as measured from the earliest optical spectra @xcite is in the range 15,000  20,000  km  s@xmath2 . clearly , this is only an average value , subject to major variations discussed in the next section , but is in the same domain as the mass - loss rates derived similarly for sn  1993j and sn  2001gd ( table  [ t : fits ] ) .",
    "though generally less well - constrained , mass - loss rates may also be estimated directly from the radio emission properties , relying only on the peak 5  ghz luminosity , and the time taken to reach that peak .",
    "equations 17 and 18 of @xcite give @xmath12 and @xmath13 for the average type  ib / c sn and type ii sn , respectively . thus , the mass - loss rate calculations are in good agreement , with sn  2001ig intermediate between the expected rates for type ib / c and type ii sne , consistent with its type iib classification .",
    "in figure  [ f : devs ] we have plotted the deviations of the observed flux density , from the best - fit model curves as shown in figure  [ f : kurt ] .",
    "the solid line in this figure is a 4-point boxcar average of the mean deviation over all frequencies at each epoch , which serves to emphasise the quasi - damped harmonic nature of the deviations , having a period near 150  days , and peak intensity declining with time ( i.e. , with increasing distance from the star ) .",
    "the r.m.s .",
    "deviation of the actual data from the smoothed interpolation is less than 1/3 of the amplitude of the observed modulation .",
    "since the fractional amplitude of these deviations is virtually identical at each frequency , the evolution of the spectral index ( fig  [ f : spix ] ) in the optically - thin phase appears relatively unaffected .",
    "we take this as evidence that the bumps and dips in the radio light curve primarily reflect abrupt modulations in the csm density structure , rather than optical depth effects ( though optical depth is tied to csm density to some degree ) .",
    "we now consider ways in which such a structured csm may have been laid down late in the life of the progenitor of sn  2001ig .    before doing so",
    ", we need to examine the effects of a change in csm density on the velocity of the expansion , as well as on the radio emission .",
    "the blastwave radius increases with time as @xmath14 , where @xmath15 for no deceleration . since @xmath16 in the @xcite model , then @xmath17 for sn  2001ig , implying significant deceleration in the surrounding csm .",
    "the radio luminosity is related to the average csm density ( @xmath18 ) via    @xmath19    @xcite so that for sn  2001ig , @xmath20 .",
    "consequently , a doubling in the csm density will cause the radio emission to rise by a factor of three .",
    "the observed transition in sn  2001ig from a type  ii optical spectrum with h lines , to a type ib / c spectrum without , argues for the ejection of a significant fraction of the red - giant envelope .",
    "[ f : devs ] indicates strong excesses of observed flux at @xmath21  days , and @xmath22  days ( with a net flux excess still at 500600  days ) , hinting at a possible periodicity of 150  days in csm density enhancements .",
    "if these density enhancements ( by factors of 30% and 15% respectively ) correspond to discrete shells of material expelled by the red supergiant , then the spacing between these shells is given by @xmath23 .",
    "given an initial ejecta expansion velocity @xmath24 of 15,000  20,000  km  s@xmath2 @xcite , an elapsed time @xmath25 of 150  days , and deceleration given above , then @xmath26  pc .",
    "assuming the shells have been expanding at the wind velocity @xmath27  km  s@xmath2 , then the period between successive mass - loss episodes is @xmath28  years .",
    "this is significantly longer than the timescales normally associated with stellar pulsations ( @xmath29 few hundred days ) in asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars , but is comparable with the expected @xmath30  yr intervals between thermal pulses ( c / he shell flashes ) in @xmath31  m@xmath32 agb stars @xcite .",
    "computations by @xcite predict an interflash period of 40  yrs when the ( hydrogen - exhausted ) core mass is nearly 1.3  m@xmath32 .",
    "this is close to the maximum core mass possible ( depending on composition ; @xcite ) in stars which will finish up as a white dwarf , rather than undergo a supernova explosion .",
    "put another way , sn  2001ig may span the gap between the most extreme mass - losing agb stars , and the least - massive supernova progenitors .",
    "such a massive agb star would also be expected to undergo multiple convective `` dredge - up '' phases leading to modified surface abundances , with n enhanced primarily at the expense of c @xcite .",
    "such changes may be apparent in the optical spectra @xcite .",
    "there are already several good examples within our own galaxy for this type of quasi - periodic mass - loss from agb and post - agb / proto - planetary nebula objects .",
    "the nearby carbon star irc@xmath33 shows multiple nested shells spaced @xmath34  arcsec apart , corresponding to ejection timescales of @xmath35  years @xcite .",
    "the `` egg nebula '' ( crl2688 ; @xcite ) and iras  17103224 @xcite are two bipolar proto - planetary nebulae which display concentric arcs with spacings on similar timescales .      among the other rsne studied to date , only sn  1979c shows anywhere near as much systematic variation in its optically - thin decline phase as sn  2001ig",
    ". indeed , for the first decade or so , the late - time radio light curve of sn  1979c could be quite well represented by a sinusoidal modulation of the flux , with a period of 1575  days @xcite .",
    "more recently however , these regular variations in sn  1979c have ceased , and the light curve has flattened out @xcite .",
    "the implied modulation period of the mass - loss rate is @xmath36  years , a factor of 100 longer than that computed above for sn  2001ig . on the basis of evidence that the progenitor of sn  1979c had an initial mass of at least 16  m@xmath32",
    ", @xcite argued against the thermal pulse scenario described in section  [ s : tp ] , as the interflash period for such a massive star and its resulting core would be @xmath37  years .",
    "instead , they proposed modulation of the progenitor wind due to eccentric orbital motion about a massive binary companion as the cause of the periodicity in the radio light curve of sn  1979c .",
    "the particular binary scenario they presented had the red supergiant progenitor and a 10  m@xmath32 b1 dwarf orbiting their common barycentre , with a 4000  year period .",
    "for a purely circular orbit , the progenitor s orbital motion is a sizable fraction of the wind velocity , resulting in a spiral ( or pinwheel - like ) density structure being imprinted on the ( otherwise uniform ) mass - loss csm in the orbital plane .",
    "this by itself would not lead to any periodic variation in the csm density swept up by the sn shock wave .",
    "if instead the orbit was eccentric ( @xmath38 say ) , the acceleration of the progenitor near periastron every 4000  years would cause an additional pile - up of wind material which may then account for the observed periodicity in the radio emission .",
    "@xcite performed full hydrodynamical simulations of this , taking into account shocks generated in the wind , the gravitational influence of the companion on the wind , and light - travel time effects .",
    "their simulations produced pronounced , but asymmetric spiral shock patterns , particularly when a polytropic equation of state is assumed .",
    "they also demonstrated that the amplitude of the modulations in the radio light curve tend to decrease as our view of the orbital plane goes from edge - on , to face - on .",
    "this may partly explain why such periodic variations as seen in sn  1979c and in sn  2001ig are comparatively rare , since not only must the mass - loss rate be modulated by the right kind of binary orbit parameters , but we must also then be fortunate enough to view it from close to edge - on .    similar hydrodynamical simulations , but in three dimensions , of detached binary systems comprising a 1.5  m@xmath32 agb star and a secondary of @xmath39  m@xmath32 were presented by @xcite , specifically targeted at reproducing the observed structures in irc@xmath33 , crl2688 , etc .",
    ", mentioned in section  [ s : tp ] .",
    "interestingly , for sufficiently large binary separations ( @xmath4010  au ) and wind velocities ( @xmath41  km  s@xmath2 ) , the spiral shock structure extends to high latitudes , and the resulting `` spiral onion shell '' structure seen in cross - section could resemble the shells seen in ppne , and implied in sn  2001ig .",
    "in an alternative binary scenario , @xcite postulate that it is the close passage of the secondary star effectively `` choking off '' uniform mass - loss from an agb star having an extended atmosphere , rather than any enhancements in the mass - loss rate itself , which gives rise to these shells .",
    "perhaps the best direct evidence for the existence of binary - generated spiral shocks comes from high - resolution observations of dusty wolf - rayet ( w - r ) stars . @xcite and @xcite used the technique of aperture - masking interferometry on the keck  i telescope to image structure at better than 50  mas resolution in the @xmath42-band around wr  104 and wr  98a .",
    "in both cases , they found pinwheel - shaped nebulae wrapping almost entirely around the central source out to distances of 150300  au .",
    "their model has an ob - type companion orbiting the w - r star , with dust formation taking place in the wake of the interface region between their colliding stellar winds .",
    "the combination of orbital motion and wind - driven radial motion results in a `` lawn sprinkler '' effect , and the resultant dusty spirals .",
    "hydrodynamic models in 3d of these colliding wind binary systems by @xcite show the effects of varying the orbital eccentricity .",
    "remarkably , the characteristic radial scale for density enhancements implied by sn  2001ig s radio light curve ( @xmath43  pc ; sect .",
    "[ s : tp ] ) is an almost perfect match to the typical scale of one full rotation of these pinwheel nebulae : 50100  milliarcsec at @xmath44  pc .",
    "thus , sn  2001ig may represent the obliteration of just such a pinwheel nebula .",
    "further support for this scenario comes from the flux excess ( at least 60% , though this is a lower limit due to optical depth effects ) in the first 50  days over that expected from a simple @xmath9 csm density profile , as shown in fig .",
    "[ f : devs ] . coupled with the deceleration mentioned previously ,",
    "this would tend to favour a centrally - condensed additional csm component such as a pinwheel nebula , rather than concentric mass - loss shells .",
    "it is interesting to note that the apparent requirements to produce such a pinwheel nebula , i.e. , a close binary system composed of two massive stars in which the primary is a w - r star , are similar to those invoked by stellar evolution theory to explain the origin of type ib / c sne . the peculiar spectral evolution and optical light curve behaviour of sn  1993j and sn  1987k ( sect .",
    "[ s : intro ] ) has been attributed to the explosion of a hydrogen - poor , helium - rich progenitor @xcite . a large fraction of the progenitor s original hydrogen envelope must have been shed prior to core collapse , either through a strong stellar wind from a single massive ( 2530  m@xmath32 ) star @xcite ; or more likely , via mass transfer from an intermediate - mass ( 1015  m@xmath32 ) star in a binary system @xcite .",
    "models for the evolution of massive stars in close binaries ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) produce helium stars .",
    "the suggestion is that stars which have lost some or all of their hydrogen would be the wn class of w - r stars , and explode as type  ib sne ; while those which lose their helium layer as well would be the wc or wo classes of w - r stars , and explode as type  ic sne ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "at least 40% of solar neighbourhood w - r stars are in binary systems with hot companions @xcite , and the fraction may be even higher in low - metallicity environments @xcite , such as the outskirts of ngc  7424 .",
    "the extent of mass transfer , and thus the end - products of the binary system , depends on the evolutionary stage of the primary at the time mass transfer commences .",
    "as shown by @xcite and @xcite , case  c mass transfer ( which takes place after the core helium - burning phase ) in systems with large eccentricity and orbital periods of a few years can be episodic , occurring mainly near periastron , just as outlined in sect .",
    "[ s : binary ] .",
    "we propose that sn  2001ig may well have undergone just such a phase , without actually sharing a common envelope with a companion .",
    "the implied orbital period is given by one complete winding of the pinwheel nebula , which is simply the ratio of @xmath45  pc divided by the terminal wind velocity of a wn star ( @xmath46  km  s@xmath2 ; @xcite ) , or @xmath47  days , consistent with this scenario .",
    "in this context , the highly - modulated radio light curves for sn  2001ig may represent some of the best evidence yet for a link between sne of type  iib and type  ib / c , in that sn  2001ig evolved optically like a type  iib , but has the radio characteristics that should be expected for a type  ib / c sn originating in a w - r + ob binary system viewed nearly edge - on .",
    "a testable prediction from this scenario is that the companion star ( which by virtue of mass accretion may be even brighter than the w - r progenitor of sn  2001ig ) should eventually become visible against the fading optical remnant , as has been postulated but not yet observed for sn  1993j @xcite .",
    "besides its apparent association with the gamma - ray burst grb  980425 , sn  1998bw is also notable for showing bumps and dips in its radio light curves not dissimilar to those seen in sn  2001ig @xcite . these deviations , while exhibiting no clear periodicity in the first 1000  days , were less conspicuous at low frequencies , just as in sn  2001ig .",
    "this kind of behaviour is likely due to the csm still being optically thick to low frequencies at relatively late times , and therefore only emission originating in the near - side of the csm can be seen ; whereas at high frequencies , emission from the entire csm is visible .",
    "sn  1998bw had the spectral characteristics primarily of a type  ic event , with a probable w - r progenitor @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , barely a half - dozen type ib / c sne have been detected or studied in the radio , so it is too early to tell whether such modulated radio light curves may be the clue to a common massive - binary origin for type iib and type  ib / c  sne , and possibly some grbs .",
    "by compiling one of the most complete multi - frequency radio datasets ever collected for any supernova , we have been fortunate to witness regular modulations in the radio light curves of the type iib supernova  2001ig . the time taken to reach peak luminosity at 5  ghz , the rate of decline since then , and the derived mass - loss rates prior to explosion are all intermediate between those of type",
    "ib / c and `` normal '' type  ii sne .",
    "we find the light curve modulations to recur on a timescale of @xmath48 days , and have shown them to be true density modulations in the csm , and not optical depth effects .",
    "allowing for the deceleration of the ejecta , these density enhancements are spaced 0.6  milli - parsecs ( or 130  au ) apart .",
    "while we can not totally exclude the possibility that these density enhancements represent mass - loss shells from the thermal - pulsing phase of a single agb star progenitor , we find the weight of evidence supports a stellar wind , modulated by motion in an eccentric binary system , as their source . as had been suggested previously for sn  1979c , the combination of a massive binary companion causing a pile - up of mass - loss during periastron , and a favourable viewing angle , can result in just the kind of periodic density variations observed in sn  2001ig .",
    "recent near - ir interferometric observations of the anticipated `` pinwheel '' dust nebulae in systems comprising a wolf - rayet star and a hot massive companion lend weight to this scenario , especially as the observed size scales match those required for sn  2001ig . finally , as optical spectroscopy",
    "has recently been leading to the conclusion that type ib / c sne are the product of a core - collapse event in the w - r component of such systems ( and type iib sne being those caught early enough to reveal the last traces of their lost hydrogen envelope ) , we believe these radio observations of sn  2001ig provide the `` missing link '' between the pinwheel nebulae observed in galactic w - r binary systems , and their eventual fate in type iib or type ib / c supernovae .",
    "we are grateful to the staff of the paul wild observatory , including numerous volunteer duty astronomers , for assisting us in carrying out the majority of these observations remotely from atnf epping .",

    "<S> we describe the radio evolution of sn  2001ig in ngc 7424 , from 700  days of multi - frequency monitoring with the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) and the very large array ( vla ) . </S>",
    "<S> we find that deviations of the radio light curves at each frequency from the standard `` minishell '' model are consistent with density modulations in the circumstellar medium ( csm ) , which seem to recur with a period near 150  days . </S>",
    "<S> one possibility is that these are due to enhanced mass - loss from thermal pulses in an agb star progenitor . </S>",
    "<S> a more likely scenario however is that the progenitor was a wolf - rayet star , whose stellar wind collided with that from a massive hot companion on an eccentric 100  day orbit , leading to a regular build - up of csm material on the required time and spatial scales . </S>",
    "<S> recent observations of `` dusty pinwheels '' in wolf - rayet binary systems lend credibility to this model . </S>",
    "<S> since such binary systems are also thought to provide the necessary conditions for envelope - stripping which would cause the wolf - rayet star to appear as a type  ib / c supernova event rather than a type  ii , these radio observations of sn  2001ig may provide the key to linking type  ib / c sne to type  iib events , and even to some types of gamma - ray bursts .    </S>",
