    "bipartite quantum states can be divided into separable states and entangled states @xcite .",
    "entangled states have been shown as a resource for certain tasks in quantum information @xcite .",
    "entangled states are nonclassical because they can not be prepared using local operations and classical communication ( locc ) .",
    "recently , it was found that there are some quantum correlations namely quantum discord different than entanglement which are also nonclassical and offer some advantage over classical states , for example , quantum non - locality without entanglement @xcite , and broadcasting of quantum states @xcite .",
    "in addition , it was shown theoretically @xcite , and later experimentally @xcite , that quantum discord is useful for quantum computation @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is desirable to investigate , characterize , and quantify quantum discord and other correlations to have a unified view of quantum and classical correlations @xcite .",
    "quantum discord is defined only for bipartite systems as this concept relies on definition of quantum mutual information which is defined only for bipartite systems .",
    "quantum mutual information captures the total amount of correlations , both classical and quantum correlation in a given quantum state .",
    "it is an information - theoretic measure of the total correlation in a bipartite quantum state @xcite .",
    "in particular , if @xmath2 denotes the density operator of a composite bipartite system @xmath3 , and @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) the density operator of part @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) , respectively , then the quantum mutual information is defined as @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the von neumann entropy .",
    "moreover , it was shown that quantum mutual information is the maximum amount of information that a(lice ) can send securely to b(ob ) if a composite correlated quantum state is used as the key for a _ one - time pad cryptographic system _ @xcite .",
    "recently it was suggested that correlations in a given quantum state can be split into two parts , that is as a sum of classical correlation @xmath10 and quantum correlation @xmath11 , that is , @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "the quantum part @xmath13 has been called quantum discord @xcite .",
    "quantum discord is not identical to entanglement because separable mixed states ( that is , with no entanglement ) can have non - zero quantum discord .",
    "quantum discord reflects the nonclassicality of quantum states . despite its practical applications and importance in understanding the fundamental questions in quantum physics",
    ", quantum discord has only been evaluated for the simplest case of qubit - qubit systems and even for restricted but larger class of quantum states @xcite .",
    "the main reason is the difficulty of complicated extremization procedure which becomes intractable with growing number of parameters both in von neumann measurements and the parameters involved with quantum states .",
    "for pure states and , surprisingly , for a mixture of bell states , quantum correlation is exactly equal to entanglement whereas classical correlation attains its maximum value @xmath14 .",
    "however , for general two - qubit mixed states , the situation is more complicated .",
    "qubit - qubit entanglement has been characterized and quantified completely whereas quantum discord only for particular cases @xcite .",
    "we slightly extend and generalize some of the previous studies to analytically compute the classical correlation and quantum discord for a two - parameter class of states in @xmath0 quantum systems with @xmath1 .",
    "this class of states can be obtained from an arbitrary state by means of locc and these states are invariant under all bilateral operations on a @xmath0 quantum system .",
    "we show that classical correlation and quantum discord can be calculated straight forwardly due to the fact that the eigenvalues of the measurement ensemble do not depend on the parameters of the von neumann measurements .",
    "this fact is due to the reason that these states are highly symmetric and this symmetry brings sufficient simplicity in handling the corresponding maximization / minimization procedure . as an example , we study the qubit - qutrit system and compare the classical correlation , quantum discord , and entanglement for various initial states .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ discord ]",
    "we discuss quantum discord .",
    "we describe the two - parameter class of states in section [ tp - states ] and calculate the classical correlation and quantum discord for them . in section",
    "[ relation ] , we apply the results for various initial states of qubit - qutrit system and study the relation between the classical correlation , quantum discord , and entanglement .",
    "we conclude our work in section [ conclusion ] .",
    "an appendix present the details of transforming an arbitrary state in @xmath0 quantum systems by local operation and classical communication ( locc ) to two - parameter class of quantum states discussed in this paper .",
    "in order to quantify quantum discord , ollivier and zurek @xcite suggested the use of von neumann type measurements which consist of one - dimensional projectors that sum to the identity operator .",
    "let the projection operators @xmath15 describe a von neumann measurement for subsystem @xmath7 only , then the conditional density operator @xmath16 associated with the measurement result @xmath17 is @xmath18 where the probability @xmath19 equals @xmath20 $ ] .",
    "the quantum conditional entropy with respect to this measurement is given by @xcite @xmath21 and the associated quantum mutual information of this measurement is defined as @xmath22 a measure of the resulting classical correlations is provided @xcite by @xmath23    the real obstacle to compute quantum discord lies in this complicated maximization procedure for calculating the classical correlation because the maximization is to be done over all possible von neumann measurements of @xmath7 .",
    "now , the quantities @xmath24 and @xmath25 may differ , and the difference @xmath26 is called quantum discord .    the above definition of quantum discord is not symmetric with respect to parties @xmath6 and @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , one can swap the role of @xmath6 and @xmath7 and get another expression @xcite for quantum discord as @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 describe the von neumann measurements for subsystem @xmath6 only . for a given mixed state @xmath30",
    ", however it is known that @xmath31 . for pure states , quantum discord coincides with the von neumann entropy of entanglement . for two - qubit quantum states ,",
    "the quantification of quantum discord is only available for certain states @xcite .",
    "it is known that if @xmath32 , then @xmath33 is diagonal in the product basis @xmath34 , and @xmath35 can be represented by the classical joint probability distribution @xmath36 .",
    "recently , it was shown @xcite that if @xmath37 , then @xmath38 = 0.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this necessary condition ensures that if @xmath33 does not commute with @xmath39 , then its quantum discord is strictly positive , and @xmath33 is nonclassically correlated .",
    "however , the reverse is not true , means that if @xmath33 commutes with @xmath39 , then its quantum discord may be greater than zero .",
    "recently the states having zero quantum discord were discussed in detail @xcite . however , despite this progress , it is still not known how to compute quantum discord for a general bipartite quantum state due to the complicated maximization procedure .",
    "we provide the analytical results to compute the classical correlation and quantum discord for a two - parameter class of states in @xmath0 quantum systems with @xmath1 .",
    "this two - parameter class of states is special in the sense that an arbitrary quantum state @xmath33 in @xmath0 can be reduced to this class provided local operations and classical communication ( locc ) is allowed .",
    "this class includes the maximally entangled bell states , ` werner ' states @xcite which include both separable and nonseparable states , as well as others .",
    "we have evaluated the analytical expressions for the classical correlation and quantum discord .",
    "we have also examined the relation between classical correlation , quantum discord , and entanglement for qubit - qutrit systems .",
    "the class of states with two real parameters @xmath40 and @xmath41 in a @xmath0 quantum system @xcite is given as @xmath42 where @xmath43 is an orthonormal basis for @xmath0 quantum system and @xmath44 is dependent on @xmath40 and @xmath41 by the unit trace condition , @xmath45 from eq .",
    "( [ eq : rhoag ] ) one can easily obtain the range of parameters as @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "we note that the states of the form @xmath48 are equivalent to werner states @xcite in a @xmath49 quantum systems .",
    "moreover , the states @xmath50 have the property that their ppt ( positive partial transpose ) region is always separable @xcite .",
    "the [ app ] describes the procedure of transforming an arbitrary quantum state @xmath33 in @xmath0 to @xmath51 with the help of local operations and classical communication ( locc ) .",
    "now we calculate the quantum discord for this family of quantum states .",
    "it is known that any von neumann measurement for subsystem @xmath6 can be written as ref .",
    "@xcite @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the projector for subsystem @xmath6 along the computational base @xmath54 and @xmath55 is a unitary operator with unit determinant .",
    "after the measurement , the state @xmath56 will change to the ensemble @xmath57 , where @xmath58 and @xmath59 $ ] .",
    "the @xmath57 , with @xmath60 are of subsystem @xmath7 and thus @xmath61 density matrices .",
    "we may write any @xmath55 as @xmath62 with @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "this implies that these parameters , three among them independent , assume their values in the interval @xmath65 $ ] , i.e. @xmath66 $ ] for @xmath67 .",
    "the ensemble @xmath68 can be characterized by their eigenvalues @xcite .",
    "interestingly , it turns out that the eigenvalues of the measurement ensemble do not depend on the parameters of @xmath69 for any @xmath70 . in a previous study",
    ", we have already observed this peculiarity for certain quantum states in @xmath49 quantum systems where for example the eigenvalues of the measurement ensemble for werner states do not depend on @xmath69 parameters @xcite . as",
    "werner states are special case of these states , so we have identified a whole class of quantum states in @xmath0 quantum systems which have this property .",
    "the main reason for this behaviour is the highly symmetric nature of these states that is , @xmath71-invariance ( see [ app ] ) .",
    "therefore , as a result there is no complicated extremization or minimization procedure involved over von neumann measurements for these states and we can easily obtain the analytical expressions for classical correlation and quantum discord .",
    "the quantum conditional entropy in eq .",
    "( [ eq : qce ] ) is given as @xmath72 it turns out that @xmath73 and hence , the quantum conditional entropy becomes @xmath74    as per eq .",
    "( [ eq : cc ] ) , the classical correlation is obtained as @xmath75 \\nonumber \\\\ & = & s(\\rho_{\\alpha , \\gamma}^b ) - \\min_{\\{a_i\\ } } \\ , [ \\ , s ( \\rho_{\\alpha , \\gamma}|\\{a_i\\})\\ , ] \\ , .",
    "\\label{eq : qmimtaux}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] therefore , to calculate the classical correlation and consequently quantum discord , we have to minimize eq .",
    "( [ eq : qcetx2 ] ) .",
    "however , as it is shown below that the eigenvalues of @xmath76 do not depend on the parameters of von neumann measurements , therefore the minimization procedure is not required .",
    "the reduced density matrix @xmath77 is @xmath61 diagonal matrix and hence have @xmath70 eigenvalues .",
    "the spectrum of @xmath77 is given as @xmath78 the entropy of @xmath77 is given as @xmath79 where all logrithms in this paper are taken to base @xmath80 .",
    "similarly , the expression for @xmath81 is given as @xmath82 the classical correlation is given as @xmath83 the quantum mutual information for @xmath84 is given as @xmath85 and quantum discord is simply given as @xmath86    we note that the reduced density matrix @xmath87 is always equal to maximally mixed state irrespective of the dimension of second hilbert space , that is , @xmath88 , whereas @xmath89 is equal to maximally mixed state only for @xmath90 , that is , for qubit - qubit system . for @xmath1 , qubit marginal is maximally mixed and qudit marginal is not .",
    "thus , we have obtained analytically the classical correlation and thereby quantum discord for two - parameter class of states in qubit - qudit systems .",
    "for the special case of two - qubit x - states @xcite with restrictions @xmath91 , @xmath92 , and with real off - diagonal elements , we recover the results of refs .",
    "hence our study is generalization of some of the results obtained earlier and the extension of all previous studies on quantum discord to qubit - qudit quantum systems .",
    "in this section , we study the relation between the classical correlation , quantum discord , and entanglement for initial qubit - qutrit states .",
    "the two - parameter states for this dimension of hilbert space are give as @xmath93    the negativity @xcite is a measure of entanglement which completely characterizes and quantifies the set of entangled states for @xmath49 and @xmath94 systems @xcite .",
    "however , the negativity completely characterizes and quantifies the entanglement of this family of quantum states in all dimensions of hilbert space because it was shown @xcite that the ppt region of these states is always separable and there is no possibility of bound entangled states @xcite in this family .",
    "the negativity for @xmath50 is given as @xcite @xmath95 for qubit - qutrit system negativity would be @xmath96 .",
    "let us consider few initial states as examples to study classical correlation , entanglement and quantum discord .",
    "@xmath97 as a trivial example we consider the initial state eq.([eq : rhoag23 ] ) with @xmath98 , and @xmath99 .",
    "eqs.([eq : cc23 ] ) , ( [ eq : mi23 ] ) , and ( [ eq : qd23 ] ) predict that @xmath100 which is obviously the case for maximally entangled bell state @xcite , where entanglement and quantum discord also coincide and are identical .",
    "@xmath101 as a second example consider the initial states eq.([eq : rhoag23 ] ) with @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",
    "clearly the negativity of @xmath104 is zero , that is @xmath105 and the states have positive partial transpose ( ppt ) and hence separable .",
    "although there is no entanglement in these states for this choice of two parameters , nevertheless , the states were constructed by a fraction of maximally entangled state @xmath106 and we expect some nonclassical correlation in it . the classical correlation and quantum discord",
    "are given as @xmath107 respectively .",
    "hence , both classical correlation and quantum discord are strictly positive .",
    "@xmath108 consider the initial states eq.([eq : rhoag23 ] ) with @xmath109 . again",
    "the negativity for @xmath110 is zero , that is , @xmath111 and hence the states are ppt and separable .",
    "nevertheless , the classical correlation is given as @xmath112 and quantum discord is given as @xmath113    figure [ fig:1 ] displays the classical correlation and quantum discord for @xmath110 against the parameter @xmath40 .",
    "the solid line presents classical correlation , whereas the dashed line is for quantum discord .",
    "it can be seen that for this particular initial state , quantum discord is always greater than classical correlation .",
    "@xmath114 let us consider the initial state with parameter @xmath115 .",
    "it can be seen easily that initial states consist of maximally entangled state mixed with noisy component , that is , for @xmath99 , the state is maximally entangled and it is separable only for @xmath109 .",
    "it turns out that the negativity , classical correlation , and quantum discord are equal for this state and given as @xmath116 as @xmath117 $ ] , hence for @xmath118 , these correlations achieve their maximum value equal to @xmath14 and they are zero for @xmath119 which corresponds to value of parameter @xmath109 .",
    "@xmath120 finally , we consider the initial states with @xmath121 .",
    "the classical correlation , quantum discord , and negativity have been plotted in figure [ fig:2 ] for @xmath56 for a particular value of the parameter @xmath122 .",
    "the solid line is for classical correlation , the dotted - dashed line is for negativity , and the dashed line for quantum discord . for this particular initial state ,",
    "the classical correlation is always smaller than quantum discord , however it is larger than entanglement only for a particular range and then becomes always smaller than negativity .",
    "similarly , quantum discord is also larger than negativity for some range of parameter @xmath41 and then becomes smaller .",
    "we note that both classical correlation and quantum discord vanishes for a particular value of @xmath41 as shown in figure [ fig:2 ] .",
    "we show the plot for this range of values in figure [ fig:3 ] . it can be seen that for @xmath123 , classical correlation , quantum discord , and entanglement vanishes .",
    "it might appear as surprising , however it is obvious that the initial states with @xmath123 are completely uncorrelated states and therefore we expect that all correlation measures must be zero .",
    "we have derived analytical expressions for the classical correlation and quantum discord for two - parameter class of states in @xmath0 quantum systems . this class has a peculiarity that the eigenvalues of its measurement ensemble do not depend on the parameters of von neumann measurements .",
    "these highly symmetric quantum states enable us to calculate the corresponding expressions for classical correlation and quantum discord without any complicated maximization / minimization procedure .",
    "another important aspect is the fact an arbitrary state in @xmath0 quantum system can be transformed into this class of two - parameters states by locc .",
    "hence , if locc are allowed then one can find the classical correlation and quantum discord for qubit - qudit quantum systems for any arbitrary quantum state .",
    "these results also generalizes some of the results previously available only for a single and three - parameter subsets of such states in qubit - qubit hilbert space .",
    "various correlations such as the classical correlation , quantum discord , and entanglement can now be examined for a larger class of bipartite quantum states that includes maximally or partially entangled states , and mixed states that are separable or non - separable .",
    "perhaps the investigations on quantum discord or other quantum correlation may reveal the true nature of nonlocality and nonclassicality in a more clear way .",
    "we conclude that entanglement and quantum discord are not identical correlation and quantum discord is a fundamentally different resource than entanglement .",
    "more rigorous studies on unified view of classical and quantum correlation is desired .    during the completion of this work",
    ", i have learned that similarly studies are in progress @xcite on evaluating quantum discord for qubit - qudit quantum systems in a totally different way and for more general class of quantum states .",
    "i thank prof .",
    "a. r. p. rau for reading the manuscript and giving useful suggestions .",
    "i am also thankful to prof .",
    "gernot alber for his comments and his kind hospitality at technische universitt darmstadt where the final part of this work is done .",
    "now we briefly describe the process of transforming an arbitrary state in @xmath0 quantum system to a state of the form @xmath56 .",
    "all the subsequent discussion has been described in ref .",
    "we reproduce the arguments here for the convenience of readers .",
    "it was shown that an arbitrary state in a @xmath0 quantum system can be transformed to a state of the form @xmath51 ( eq.([eq : rhoag ] ) ) by locc .",
    "the states @xmath51 are invariant under all unitary operations of the form @xmath71 on a @xmath0 quantum system .",
    "let @xmath124 be the group of all unitary operators on a @xmath17-dimentional hilbert space , and @xmath125 and @xmath126 be bases of @xmath127 and @xmath128 , respectively . for ease , we identify a unitary operator @xmath129 with @xmath130 if for @xmath131 @xmath132 and @xmath133 . for @xmath134 ,",
    "we let @xmath135 where @xmath136 is a subspace of @xmath128 generated by @xmath137 , and @xmath138 is the orthogonal complement of @xmath136 in @xmath128 .",
    "then @xmath139 is a subgroup of @xmath140 , and if @xmath141 is a unitary operator in @xmath139 then it is compatible to write a unitary operator of the form @xmath71 on a @xmath0 quantum system .",
    "the technique of transforming an arbitrary state @xmath33 to @xmath56 by using local operations and classical communication ( locc ) is similar to that presented by bennet _",
    "et al _ @xcite and dr _ et al _ @xcite .",
    "we outline here the main arguement from ref .",
    "it was shown that there exist unitary operators @xmath142 and probabilities @xmath19 such that @xmath143    define the operation @xmath144 as @xmath145 , where @xmath146 .",

    "now perform @xmath154 with probability @xmath148 as in eq.([eq : op1 ] ) and then perform the swap operator @xmath155 for @xmath156 with probability @xmath148 .",
    "after these operations , a state of the following form is obtained @xmath157 let @xmath158 be the unitary operator defined as @xmath159 , @xmath160 , @xmath161 , @xmath162 , @xmath163 , @xmath164 and @xmath165 .",
    "now perform the operation : @xmath166 here , @xmath167 for any @xmath168 . as a result a state in eq.([eq : op2 ] ) becomes @xmath169 let @xmath170 be the unitary operator ( hadamard operator ) defined as @xmath171 , @xmath172 and @xmath173 for @xmath174 .",
