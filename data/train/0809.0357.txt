    "in physics of strong nuclear interactions , the observed hadrons at low energies can be described in terms of meson and baryon degrees of freedom , while at high energies the description is formulated in terms of quarks and gluons .",
    "quark - hadron duality is an intriguing phenomenon which , by connecting the two energy regimes , provides a dual description of hadronic variables .",
    "its understanding , however , still represents a fundamental challenge .    in ref .",
    "@xcite we present a novel new approach to study quark - hadron duality using truncated moments of structure functions , or the integrals of structure functions over restricted regions of bjorken variable @xmath0 .",
    "in particular , by studying the @xmath1 evolution of structure functions integrated over specific nucleon resonance regions , where @xmath1 is the virtuality of the exchanged photon , we determine the degree to which individual resonance regions are dominated by leading twist , and hence quantify their higher twist content .",
    "the phenomenon of quark - hadron duality was first observed in inclusive electron - nucleon scattering at slac by bloom and gilman in 1970 @xcite .",
    "it reflects the similarity between structure functions averaged over the resonance region and the scaling , or leading twist function .",
    "the former is characterized by hadronic bound states , whereas the latter describes the high energy deep inelastic continuum , in other words , scattering from free quarks @xcite .",
    "the oscillation of nucleon resonances around the scaling curve shows that hadrons follow the qcd scaling behavior .",
    "the only rigorous interpretation of the so - called bloom - gilman duality within the theoretical framework has been done in terms of the moments of structure functions .",
    "they were analyzed within the qcd operator product ( or twist ) expansion . here the leading term in @xmath2 expansion is given by matrix elements of leading twist quark - gluon bilocal operators , and is associated with free quark scattering .",
    "furthermore , higher terms in the expansion correspond to nonperturbative ( higher twist ) quark - gluon interactions . in this language duality",
    "is explained as the suppression of higher twist contributions to the moments @xcite .",
    "experimental data from recent years @xcite suggest that quark - hadron duality not only exists over the whole resonance region but also locally .",
    "it holds over restricted regions of hadronic final state mass @xmath3 , or even for individual resonances .",
    "nevertheless , any insight about workings of local duality has been confined to qcd - inspired models of the nucleon . as such our understanding of quark - hadron duality in nucleon structure functions within qcd is incomplete .",
    "many earlier analyses of duality within a qcd context have used full moments of structure functions and hence quantified the higher twist content over all region of @xmath0 .",
    "our approach , on the other hand , allows one to study for the first time the distribution of higher twist corrections over various regions in @xmath0 ( or @xmath3 ) in a well - defined systematic way .",
    "in analogy with full moments , e.g. of a parton distribution function ( pdf ) @xmath4 , @xmath5 truncated moments are defined as : @xmath6 where the integration over the bjorken @xmath0 variable is restricted to @xmath7 . by truncating the integration region to some minimum value @xmath8",
    ", one avoids the problem of extrapolating parton distributions into unmeasured regions at small @xmath0 . several years ago",
    "this original idea was introduced to study structure function moments for which small-@xmath0 data were not available @xcite .",
    "note that @xmath0 is related to the invariant mass squared @xmath9 of the virtual photon - hadron system through @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the nucleon mass .",
    "thus an infinite energy is required to reach the @xmath12 limit , and accordingly some extrapolation to @xmath13 is always needed in practice to evaluate the moment . unlike full moments , truncated moments satisfy the evolution equations , which mix the lower moments with the higher ones .",
    "an alternative approach , the so - called diagonal formulation of truncated moments , was later developed to avoid the complication of mixing @xcite . it was shown that truncated moments obey the dglap evolution with a modified splitting function in the mellin convolution .",
    "namely , @xmath14 where @xmath15 plays the role of the splitting function for the truncated moments .",
    "moreover , by introducing the doubly - truncated moment of @xmath4 , @xmath16 the evolution equations for truncated moments can be generalized to any subset in the @xmath0-region , @xmath17 .    in our work",
    "we partially follow the latter approach and apply it to the study of the proton structure function @xmath18 in the large-@xmath0 region , populated by nucleon resonances .",
    "we use recent high - precision data from jefferson lab experiment e91 - 110 @xcite , and quantify the size of the higher twists for the lowest three moments in various regions of @xmath19  gev . by dividing the data into the three traditional resonance regions we extract the leading and higher twist content of each region .",
    "in order to determine the degree to which nucleon structure function data in specific regions in @xmath0 ( or @xmath3 ) are dominated by leading twist we first evolve the structure functions by brute - force using a suitable numerical integration routine , apply the target mass corrections ( tmcs ) , and finally calculate their corresponding truncated moments over the integration range @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the inelastic threshold .",
    "deviations of the evolved moments , computed to next - to - leading order ( nlo ) accuracy , from the experimental data at the new @xmath1 then reveal any higher twist contributions in the original data .",
    "in particular , we analyze recent data on @xmath18 from jefferson lab covering a range in @xmath1 from @xmath22  gev@xmath23 to @xmath24  6  gev@xmath23 .",
    "the evolution of the measured truncated moments requires the structure function to be decomposed into its nonsinglet and singlet components , which are a priori unknown .",
    "we shall assume that in our region of interest ( i.e. at moderate to large @xmath0 ) the structure function @xmath18 is well approximated by its nonsinglet component , and hence will evolve the truncated moments as nonsinglets .",
    "to test the accuracy of the nonsinglet ( ns ) evolution versus the full or exact evolution we use the trial function , whose decomposition into its nonsinglet and singlet components is known . in our case",
    "this is the leading twist proton @xmath25 structure function computed from the mrst2004 pdf fit @xcite .",
    "first we evolve its nonsinglet and singlet components separately and then construct the full function , and secondly we evolve the trial function under the assumption that the total function can be treated as a nonsinglet .",
    "the comparison between the truncated moments calculated from the two evolutions gives the accuracy of the ns evolution of the various moments with respect to the exact results using both singlet and nonsinglet evolution .",
    "the ratios of these are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] as a function of the truncation point @xmath26 . in the traditional nucleon resonance region ,",
    "@xmath27  gev , the differences between the full and ns evolution are of the order 24% and increase with increasing @xmath28 .",
    "the @xmath29 moment is most sensitive to singlet evolution .",
    "as expected , the differences are smaller for the higher moments .",
    "thus in the region relevant for our study one can therefore conclude that the evolution error , or the uncertainty introduced by evolving the @xmath18 truncated moments as nonsinglets , is less than 4% , which will be included in the errors in our final results",
    ".     evolved from @xmath30 to 1  gev@xmath23 , using ns and full evolution , versus the truncation point @xmath28 for the @xmath29 ( solid ) , 4 ( dotted ) and 6 ( dashed ) moments . ]    in the analysis we assume that the @xmath18 data beyond some large value of @xmath1 ( in our case @xmath31  gev@xmath23 ) are dominated by twist-2 contributions , which is consistent with most global analyses of pdfs .",
    "for example , a comparison of the dis data fit shows the excellent agreement between the leading twist structure function , after correcting for tmcs , and the data at this scale .",
    "moreover , we observe that the inclusion of tmcs has to be properly accounted for before drawing any conclusions about higher twists from data . to quantify the higher twist content of the specific resonance regions , and at different values of @xmath1",
    ", we consider several intervals in @xmath3 : @xmath32  1.9  gev@xmath23 , corresponding to the traditional @xmath33 ( or first ) resonance region ; @xmath34  gev@xmath23 for the @xmath35 ( or second ) resonance region ; and @xmath36  gev@xmath23 for the @xmath37 ( or third ) resonance region .",
