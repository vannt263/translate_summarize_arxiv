    "in the study of networks and dynamical processes therein , one important issue is the identification of the most influential nodes , i.e. those with the higher ability to drive the others towards a desired state .",
    "the issue depends on the process and the control objective : consequently , it has been addressed in several contexts , from the seminal paper  @xcite on maximizing the spreading of influence , to several leader selection problems recently considered , such as  @xcite . in this work",
    ", we assume that a leader has to compete against an external field of influence in order to win the opinions of the other individuals in a social network . following a consolidated research line  @xcite",
    ", we shall postulate that the opinions of the nodes follow a linear dynamics with fixed confidence weights .",
    "more precisely , the leader node has a fixed opinion , whereas the remaining `` regular '' agents update their opinions , in synchronous rounds , to a weighted average between the opinions of their neighbors and the external field .",
    "the opinions converge asymptotically to values that depend on the interaction strength , on the opinion field , on the leader location and opinion , but not on the initial opinion of the regular agents .",
    "assuming for simplicity that the leader has opinion one and the external field has opinion zero , we define the _ influence _ of the leader as the sum of the asymptotic opinions reached by the agents in the social network .",
    "the influence of a node is the influence obtained if that node was the leader .",
    "as we will discuss in details later , this definition is very close to the definition of _ harmonic influence centrality _ introduced in  @xcite and implicitly in  @xcite .    if the interaction strengths satisfy a `` reciprocity '' assumption ( essentially , the reversibility of the update matrix ) , then the asymptotic opinions of the non - leader agents can be computed as the _ harmonic _ electrical potential in an electrical network obtained from the social graph",
    "consequently , the harmonic influences of the nodes can be computed exactly by solving an array of @xmath0 linear systems defined by the laplacian of the graph , `` grounded '' in each of the @xmath0 nodes  @xcite .",
    "this straightforward approach proposed already in  @xcite has some drawbacks .",
    "firstly , global knowledge of the graph and update matrix is required by most solution methods , with the exception of some distributed ( i.e. non - global ) methods like  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "secondly , solving @xmath0 systems is computationally expensive , even if one can resort to state - of - the - art algorithms that are tailored to laplacian systems : these methods can solve each system in a time proportional to the number of edges but are not distributed  @xcite .",
    "moreover , since the @xmath0 systems are obtained by grounding the same original laplacian , solving them separately seems to produce wasteful redundancies in the computations .    along the lines of  @xcite ,",
    "in this paper we take an approach that overcomes all these issues by studying a _ message passing algorithm _ ( mpa ) able to concurrently compute the influence of all nodes .",
    "our algorithm is _ distributed _ , that is , does not require any global knowledge of the graph or of the parameters of the opinion dynamics : moreover , it computes the harmonic influence of all nodes at the same time .    if the graph is a tree , then the algorithm computes the nodes influence in a number of steps equal to the diameter of the graph . on general graphs",
    ", the algorithm converges asymptotically .",
    "the main result of this paper is indeed this proof of convergence , which subsumes the available results for regular graphs  @xcite and for unicyclic graphs  @xcite .",
    "it must be stressed that in general the algorithm , even though it converges , does not converge to the exact values of the influence . in order to explore the magnitude of this error",
    ", we conclude the paper by simulating the mpa on synthetic graphs .",
    "we observe that when the number of cycles increases , the algorithm becomes slower and less accurate , but nevertheless provides a useful approximation of the harmonic influence .",
    "our paper contributes to the literature on message passing algorithms , by providing an interesting example of algorithm that converges on _ any _ graph  @xcite . on the contrary ,",
    "proofs of convergence of message passing algorithms are often limited to tree graphs or to locally - tree - like graphs .    in this field ,",
    "a closely related paper is  @xcite , which reformulates the problem of solving a linear systems @xmath1 , where the matrix @xmath2 is full rank and symmetric , in a probabilistic inference problem .",
    "then , it develops a gaussian belief propagation method , that involves two kinds of messages .",
    "the authors prove that if @xmath2 is strictly diagonally dominant , or if the matrix @xmath3 ( where @xmath4 is the identity matrix ) has spectral radius strictly smaller than one , then the algorithm converges to the exact solution . on trees ,",
    "the algorithm coincides with the direct gaussian elimination method .",
    "our work also shares some ideas with  @xcite , which proposes a _ consensus propagation _ protocol based on two kinds of messages to solve the consensus problem : one contains a partial estimate of the consensus value and the other contains the number of nodes involved in such partial estimate .",
    "a suitable attenuation parameter makes the protocol  @xcite convergent on general graphs .",
