    "* ? ? ? * section 4.3.1 ) , the authors of @xcite conjectured that every convex semialgebraic set is the projection of a spectrahedron . on figure",
    "[ fig : spectrahedron ] is represented a spectrahedron ( for @xmath23 and @xmath24 ) together with its real determinantal variety .",
    "the minimization of a given function , for example a polynomial , over real convex sets is a central problem in optimization theory .",
    "if the function is linear and the set is a spectrahedron , this is exactly the aim of _ semidefinite programming _ ( sdp ) , see @xcite .",
    "if the input data of a semidefinite program are defined over @xmath6 , the solutions are algebraic numbers , and the authors in @xcite investigated their algebraic degree : giving explicit formulas or bounds for this value is a measure of the complexity of the given program .",
    "convex lmis and sdp are also widely used for solving nonconvex polynomial optimization problems .",
    "indeed , these optimization problems are linearized in the space of moments of nonnegative measures ( which is infinite - dimensional ) and a suitable sequence of lmi relaxations , or truncations ( the so - called _ lasserre hierarchy _ ) , that can be solved via sdp , provides the solution to the original problem .",
    "the feasible set of every truncated problem is a spectrahedron in the space of moments , for more details see @xcite and references therein .",
    "so far , the problem of ( deciding the existence and ) computing such solutions has been addressed via several numerical methods , the most successful of which are primal - dual interior - point algorithms @xcite implemented in _ floating - point arithmetic _ in different sdp solvers @xcite .    in this paper ,",
    "the problem of computing points on spectrahedra is linked to polynomial systems solving over the reals .",

    "we mean that we do not content ourselves with approximate floating - point computations .",
    "our main motivation starts from the geometrical aspects of sdp as explained above : boundaries of spectrahedra are subsets of determinantal hypersurfaces , and so solving this problem _ efficiently _ is a necessary step to address the associated positivity problem @xmath21 , since the rank of the matrix @xmath8 at a point in the boundary of the spectrahedron @xmath25 drops at least by one , while a point in the interior corresponds to a positive definite matrix .",

    "modern computer algebra algorithms for solving our problem require at most @xmath3 arithmetic operations in @xmath6 , see ( * ? ? ?",

    "the core idea is to reduce the input problem to a polynomial optimization problem whose set of optimizers is expected to be finite and to meet every connected component of the solution set under study .",
    "such a reduction must be done carefully , especially for unbounded sets or singular situations .",
    "so far , it is an open problem to get a competitive implementation of the algorithms in @xcite : unbounded and singular cases imply algebraic manipulations that have no impact on the complexity class but require to work over puiseux series fields , and this increases the constant hidden by the big-@xmath26 notation in the exponent .    during the past decade",

    "the goal is to get an implementation that reflects the theoretical complexity gains .",
    "most of these algorithms are probabilistic : some random choices independent of the input are performed to ensure genericity properties .",
    "our contribution shares these features and it is inspired by some geometric ideas in @xcite .",
    "a main limitation is that the algorithms in @xcite are dedicated to the smooth case . in our case , it turns out that @xmath28 is in general a singular variety ",
    "see e.g. @xcite and recall figure [ fig : spectrahedron ]  which makes our problem more difficult from a geometric point of view .",
    "algorithms in @xcite deal with singular situations but do not return sample points in the connected components that are contained in the singular locus of the variety . as a consequence , one can not use them to decide the emptiness of @xmath29 .",
    "the algorithm in @xcite may be used but it suffers from an extra - cost , since it requires essentially @xmath30 arithmetic operations .",
    "moreover , in @xcite , the authors have developed algorithms and complexity estimates to isolate the real solutions of determinantal systems ( see also @xcite for related works on a bilinear setting ) . beyond the interest of solving our problem for the aforementioned applications ,",
    "it is of interest to extend these works to the real and positive dimensional case .    in practice",
