    "at very low temperatures , the thermal motion of the @xmath0he atoms in the liquid becomes very small as the de broglie wavelength becomes comparable with the distance between the atoms and so quantum effects become significant enough to dictate the macroscopic properties of the liquid . in a recent paper@xcite ,",
    "one of us noted that degenerate dilute solutions of @xmath0he in liquid @xmath1he might be cooled by flow through an array of nano - channels whose diameters are comparable to the de broglie wave length of the channel . aligning the fermi energy of a container of fermions with the lowest allowed band in the channel would allow only the hot gases through the channel , thereby cooling the remaining gas in the container .",
    "the presence of such separated bands in a channel immediately suggests further possible unusual behavior . for fluids confined over such small scales , one may legitimately ask whether or not the physics of the system , for example , the flow properties , are still the same as at larger scale , or if perhaps a breakdown of the fluid mechanics might occur .",
    "indeed recently sato et al@xcite considered the feasibility of seeing quantized conductance in dilute solutions when there was pure ballistic flow .",
    "recent advances in materials research have opened up the possibilities to design and engineer single , or arrays of pores with diameters of tens of nanometer in ceramic membranes@xcite , and down to only @xmath31 nm in tailor - made carbon nanotubes membranes@xcite .",
    "these materials provide a radial length scale small enough to quantize the transverse motion of the helium atoms so that a realization of quantum - limited ballistic flow of helium , similar to that observed in the electronic transport of quantum wires@xcite , truly seems within experimental reach .",
    "we consider here possible experiments on pure @xmath0he as well as dilute solutions .",
    "we first examine the temperature dependence of the conductance quantization for pure ballistic flow .",
    "we then investigate the effect of disorder and how wall scattering in diffusive flow causes the onset of `` universal '' conductance fluctuations in the mass flow . in the ultra - low temperature limit @xmath4",
    ", we also argue that one - dimensional quantum fluids should crossover to an entirely new exotic type of quantum matter known theoretically as a luttinger liquid@xcite .",
    "such liquid should possess entirely different flow properties and excitation spectra owing to its ` spin - mass ' separated ground state@xcite .",
    "this study presented here constitutes only a preliminary analysis to illustrate the richness of flow properties that one might expect in experiments on helium in nanoscaled cylindrical pores .",
    "more thorough investigations at the theoretical and experimental level are in progress .",
    "the de broglie wave length @xmath5 gives the scale of the diameters of the nanochannels necessary for seeing unusual quantum effects ; the fermi temperature @xmath6 tells us what temperature we need for degeneracy . for pure @xmath0he @xmath7 nm , @xmath8 k while for a 1% solution of @xmath0he in liquid @xmath1he , @xmath9 nm and @xmath10 mk .",
    "moreover , the interparticle mean free path is in the micron range because it contains the factor @xmath11 in each case a dilution refrigerator is able to produce adequate degeneracy .",
    "@xcite considered the possibility of using such arrays of channels to see the quantization of the conductance .",
    "unfortunately dispersion in the channel size can smooth out the quantization steps . in the present study we will ignore this problem and assume that technology will soon provide the feasibility of detecting flow from a single channel or a very small number of channels .",
    "initially we will neglect any interparticle scattering and many - body interaction ; the only scattering we will consider is that from the walls .",
    "a natural definition of the mass conductance , analogous to that used in the case of an electric current , is given by@xcite @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the mass current , @xmath14 the particle mass , and @xmath15 the difference in chemical potential between the ends of the channel .",
    "the mass current is taken to be @xmath16 \\mathcal{t}(\\epsilon _ { z } )   \\label{land1}\\ ] ] where @xmath17 is the longitudinal momentum , and we have written the energy in the channel as a longitudinal part @xmath18 plus @xmath19 the discrete transverse energies in the channel .",
    "the fermi distribution is @xmath20 the quantity @xmath21 is the transition probability for the scatterers in the channel , and @xmath22 . in eq .",
    "( [ land1 ] ) we have assumed the temperature in the channel to be uniform ; any gradient can easily be incorporated into the formula .",
    "( [ land1 ] ) is just the landauer formula@xcite for the conductance .",
    "we have assumed @xmath23 for each band is just a function of @xmath24 expanding the fermi distributions in small @xmath15 we find @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 @xmath28 note that if @xmath29 the transmission probability vanishes .    for extremely low temperature",
    "the derivative of the fermi distribution is sharply peaked around @xmath30 so we can write @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the fermi energy .",
    "the states in a cylindrical nano - channel are denoted by @xmath33 where @xmath34 and @xmath14 are the radial and azimuthal quantum numbers and @xmath35 is the longitudinal wave number .",
    "we assume that the states of different @xmath14 are all degenerate and that a band is characterized by @xmath36 and a degeneracy factor .",
    "if an atom of energy @xmath37 enters a channel from a reservoir whose fermi energy matches a state in the @xmath38th band , then it can be in a superposition of bands @xmath39to @xmath40 such that @xmath41 .",
    "if there is no scattering ( that is , there is only specular scattering at the walls and the latter simply provide boundary conditions for the wave functions ) , then particles in each @xmath35 state stay there and do not exchange from one band to another .",
    "the transmission probability for any band is just a step function @xmath42 the conductance is then simply @xmath43 this function is plotted in fig .",
    "the conductance is clearly quantized in units of 2@xmath44 double steps occur because of a two - fold degeneracy of some states .",
    "( where @xmath45 is the lowest band edge ) for pure ballistic flow at @xmath46.,width=334 ]    suppose now we turn up the temperature while still assuming that particles in the channel maintain their @xmath35 values and do not elastically scatter to other bands .",
    "( [ land1 ] ) can be written as @xmath47 the states at the fermi energy feeding into the channel are not sharp and the steps are rounded as shown in figs .",
    "[ g05 ] and [ g1 ] .",
    "the steps are already reduced substantially at @xmath48 .",
    "the steps are completely gone by @xmath49     at @xmath50 for ballistic flow.,width=334 ]     at @xmath48 for ballistic flow.,width=334 ]",
    "the above analysis considered only ballistic flow .",
    "however wall scattering can cause diffusive flow .",
    "we return here to the @xmath46 situation .",
    "an atom entering the channel is in a superposition of bands @xmath39to @xmath51 as above .",
    "backscattering is possible so that the state at the entrance ( left end ) to the channel is @xmath52",
    "where @xmath53 and @xmath54 that is , @xmath55 is a @xmath56 dimensional vector .",
    "this state has @xmath38 scattering channels .",
    "an elastic scattering of the particle from @xmath36 can be to any of the @xmath38 bands as long as energy remains the same . if @xmath57 @xmath58 only one channel is available and we have simple 1d scattering .    the landauer formula@xcite for multichannel conductance is @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the transmission coefficient for scattering from channel @xmath61 to channel @xmath62    if we assume that a scattering center on the wall has random position and strength then a method that simply uses a series of completely random scattering matrices gives a suitable simulation .",
    "such random matrix theory has been used extensively to treat conductance in electron systems.@xcite .",
    "if the state after a scattering event is    @xmath63    then the transfer matrix @xmath64 satisfies @xmath65 or @xmath66 where each @xmath67 is an @xmath68 matrix . the @xmath69 matrix , also a @xmath70 matrix that we write as @xmath71 connects outgoing ( on the left of the equation ) and incoming waves ( on the right of the equation ) according to @xmath72 where @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , and @xmath74 are @xmath68 matrices .",
    "suppose we have a two - channel system with just one scattering site so that the final state has @xmath76 .",
    "that is , after the scattering one has only the transmitted wave .",
    "then we have @xmath77 and @xmath78 @xmath75 represents reflection and @xmath73 transmission . in detail for the two - channel system we have @xmath79 if a particle starts in channel 1 ( @xmath80 , the probability of scattering to final channel 1 is @xmath81 and the probability of scattering to final channel 2 is @xmath82 the total probability of scattering out of channel 1 is @xmath83 the total conductance for an incoherent mixture of all incoming states is then @xmath84.\\ ] ] the same result holds for many channels .    the @xmath69 matrix is unitary and symmetric if we impose current conservation and time - reversal invariance , which also impose conditions on the @xmath64 matrix .",
    "we want a whole series of randomly chosen transfer matrices because the transfer matrix for @xmath85 consecutive scatterings satisfies @xmath86 because @xmath69 and @xmath64 both connect @xmath87 and @xmath88 we can relate the elements of one to the other to find @xmath64 .",
    "we then use @xmath89    it is not difficult to construct these random matrices . some results are shown in the figures . in fig .",
    "[ gr1 ] , there is only a single scattering .",
    "steps are clearly established depending on the number of channels . on the other hand",
    ", there are fluctuations in the conductance having amplitude close to one conductance unit ; these are the `` universal conductance fluctuations '' observed in electron systems.@xcite     for one scatterer .",
    "the regular stepped line is the conductance with pure ballistic flow.,width=334 ]    in fig .",
    "[ gr3 ] and fig .",
    "[ gr10 ] we increase the number of scatterers to three and ten , respectively .",
    "the step sizes are reduced in each case , as one might expect from an increase in backscattering .",
    "all steps maintain the one unit fluctuation value except the single - channel case , which is strongly reduced for three scatterers and has disappeared for ten .",
    "one - dimensional motion has reached full localization for 10 scatterers . in that case",
    "the step structure has almost disappeared as well .     for 3 scatterers.,width=334 ]     for ten scatterers.,width=334 ]    this random matrix method seems to capture many of the effects we expect experimentally .",
    "however this method is so generic that it says nothing specific , for example , about the scattering being just at the walls of the channels .",
    "alternative techniques more specific to helium are being investigated .",
    "based on simple estimates of the transverse quantum zero - point motion , we argue that in the regime of nanometric pore size and at sufficiently low temperatures , the quantum flow properties may not be described by a fluid with independent particles , as used above , but can enter a new kind of low - dimensional @xmath0he ground state with experimentally unknown excitation spectra and transport properties . in this regime , the @xmath0he fermi system should reach the strongly interacting one - dimensional limit for which a breakdown of the landau fermi liquid picture is expected@xcite and the system becomes a luttinger liquid .",
    "this expected crossover to the one - dimensional regime should be considered in a theory describing the transport of @xmath0he particles inside very narrow channels .",
    "the ideal gas approximation is no longer valid in this situation and interactions are vital to the existence of this phase .    as an idealized case ,",
    "let s consider the transport of pure @xmath0he inside a nanochannel with a diameter @xmath90 nm and of length @xmath91 such that @xmath92 .",
    "if the fluid is effectively confined _ radially _ in a cylindrical nanochannel , the fluid will be in the one - dimensional limit when the occupied states are all in the lowest band .",
    "the degree of occupation is measured by the one - dimensional fermi energy , given by @xmath93 where the number density @xmath94 is the reciprocal of the interatomic distance .",
    "a characteristic temperature measuring the separation between bands is of order @xmath95 we expect a crossover to the one - dimensional regime in nanochannels to require @xmath96 .",
    "assuming an interatomic distance of @xmath97 nm , we estimate @xmath98 mk and @xmath99 mk for @xmath100 nm . with @xmath101 and @xmath102",
    "comparable , reaching the 1d liquid in the pure case is a possiblity if the temperature is low enough .",
    "in addition , a new unidimensional state of matter will arise only when the @xmath0he atoms are in the strongly correlated regime attained at temperature @xmath103 , say , at @xmath104 mk .",
    "the conditions needed may be within experimental reach for a few nanometer hole in the pure case .    for a 1% concentration of isotopic solution the one - dimensional fermi temperature is of order 10 mk , and @xmath105 mk for @xmath106 nm .",
    "the crossover around @xmath97 mk is within the regime of the cooling technique by filtering discussed by ref .",
    "the use of isotopic helium solutions may allow one to adjust the parameters into the needed ranges .",
    "the excitation spectrum of the one - dimensional fermionic system differs entirely from a fermi liquid , and , for electrons , this state has also been known to give rise to interesting power law transport behaviour .",
    "depending on whether the interactions are attractive or repulsive , the 1d - quenched @xmath0he system could lead to interesting new physics analogous to that of one - dimensional electronic system such as , for example , the highly sought - after spin - charge separation for which there are now important experimental hints@xcite . having both pure @xmath0he and dilute solutions available",
    "allows the possibility of a considerable alteration of the interatomic interactions leading to differing physical properties .",
    "we have shown that many of the interesting effects known for electron systems can be studied experimentally and theoretically in @xmath0he in nanochannels . we have provided examples of quantum - limited mass flow giving rise to a quantization of the conductance .",
    "we have also calculated its temperature dependence and have shown the appearance of conductance fluctuations when diffusive scattering takes place . we have also argued that a very interesting new state of matter , a luttinger liquid , which may have quite new transport properties and excitations , could perhaps form in @xmath0he confined to nano - channels . while this theoretical study has been of a preliminary nature , we present it in the hopes of stimulating further discussion of this interesting system .",
    "we would like to acknowledge helpful discussions with i. affleck .",
