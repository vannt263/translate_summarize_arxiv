    "<S> cms and atlas have searched for a doubly - charged boson @xmath0 which may arise from type ii seesaw in the 7 tev run at the lhc by considering pair or associated production of doubly - charged bosons under the assumption of degenerate triplet scalars . in this work , </S>",
    "<S> we consider non - degenerate triplet components with the mass gap @xmath1 gev which leads to enhanced pair - production cross - sections of @xmath0 added by the gauge decays of the heavier neutral and singly - charged bosons . </S>",
    "<S> we reevaluate the constraints in the @xmath2 plane depending on the triplet vacuum expectation value @xmath3 in the type ii seesaw model which are much more stringent than the current search limits . </S>",
