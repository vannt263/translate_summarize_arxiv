    "the purpose of this letter is to describe the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) in f - theory .",
    "string theory provides self - consistent ultraviolet completion of the gauge theory .",
    "for example , the constraint of anomaly freedom in the low energy theory originates from the finiteness of string one - loop amplitude .",
    "f - theory is defined by identifying @xmath2-duality of iib theory with the symmetry of a torus , lifting the gauge symmetry to geometry @xcite . to have four dimensional theory with @xmath3 supersymmetry , we compactify f - theory on calabi  yau fourfold that is elliptic fibered .",
    "gauge bosons are localized on a complex surface @xmath2 , along which the fiber is singular .",
    "the structure of the singularities has correspondence to that of the corresponding group , so that the symmetry breaking and enhancement are described by geometric transition @xcite .",
    "analogous to the bifundamental representations at d - brane intersections , matter fermions come from the ` off - diagonal ' components under branching of the gaugino of @xmath1 @xcite , localized along matter curves @xcite .",
    "so far there have been constructions of grand unified theories ( guts ) mainly based on the simple group @xmath4 , and further attention has been paid on the flavor sector @xcite . compared to field theoretic gut , presumably its best merit is that we do not need adjoint higgses for breaking down to sm .",
    "instead , we can turn on a flux in the hypercharge @xmath5 direction , evading complicated gut vacuum configuration .",
    "this flux does not break hypercharge interaction , if a certain topological condition is satisfied @xcite .",
    "however , further breaking down to sm can potentially lead to chiral multiplet containing @xmath6-boson , the off - diagonal component of the adjoint of @xmath4 , by the above mechanism localizing light matters .",
    "another obvious approach that we take here is to start with the group @xmath7 .",
    "the sm group lies along the series of exceptional groups of @xmath8-type , and we take @xmath9 group inside @xmath1 , shown in fig .",
    "[ f : e3 ] , guaranteeing the correct field contents and quantum numbers .",
    "such @xmath8-series is naturally predicted by f - theory and heterotic string .",
    "for this we need a description on semisimple groups @xcite . if @xmath5 is constructed via geometry and there is no flux along this part , embeddability to @xmath4 gut singularity guarantees anomaly free spectrum and we do not worry about its breaking by green  schwarz mechanism .",
    "background in @xmath1.,height=37 ]",
    "a gauge group is described by a singular fiber sharing the same name , which is read off from tate s table @xcite .",
    "we claim that the singularity describing the sm group is @xmath10 for the total space to be calabi ",
    "yau , the equation should satisfy topological conditions : @xmath11 are respectively sections of @xmath12 in the base @xmath13 of elliptic fibration , and @xmath14 is its canonical bundle",
    ". the surface @xmath2 is located at @xmath15 , since the vanishing discriminant of ( [ weieq ] ) @xmath16 signals a singular fiber .",
    "we need globally defined sections in @xmath13 , since the simple group components would be laid away from @xmath2 .",
    "( [ weieq ] ) is a deformation of @xmath1 singularity .",
    "surveying the degrees of the coefficients in ( [ weieq ] ) , tate s table shows it is generically an @xmath17 singularity .",
    "however the parameters are specially tuned , so the actual symmetry is larger @xcite .",
    "vanishing of each coefficient factor triggers gauge symmetry enhancement , implying matter localization @xcite .",
    "we see shortly that the parameters @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 are respectively related to @xmath6-boson and subscripted quarks , which are all the charged fields under @xmath17 .",
    "we can see , neither @xmath22 nor @xmath23 is proportional to @xmath24 or @xmath25 , hence @xmath26 and @xmath27 respectively enhance the symmetry to @xmath28 and @xmath4 .    to see it contains also @xmath29",
    ", we change the variable @xmath30 , in which ( [ smdisc ] ) becomes @xmath31 here @xmath32 is related to the lepton doublet .",
    "since neither of @xmath33,@xmath34 nor @xmath35 is proportional to @xmath24 or @xmath25 , vanishing @xmath32 and @xmath36 respectively enhances the gauge symmetry respectively to @xmath17 and @xmath4 .",
    "the position @xmath37 is off from the position of @xmath2 , as a ` back - reaction ' under the symmetry breaking from @xmath4 , but it is still linearly equivalent to @xmath2 .",
    "we can see , to make the embracing @xmath4 truly traceless , we need also a backreaction @xmath38 to make the center of mass of the total brane lie on @xmath2 .",
    "the factorization structure of @xmath39 and @xmath40 hints the existence of an additional @xmath5 , otherwise we have only single factors for colored singlet and colored doublet , respectively . however to guarantee the existence of such @xmath5",
    "we should check the global factorization structure of ( [ weieq ] ) @xcite .",
    "above all , the most general deformation is by @xmath41 , implying the embedding of our symmetry to a general @xmath4 gut singularity in the literature @xcite . being its deformation , the factorization structure of @xmath42 is stably preserved against higher order perturbation in @xmath43 .",
    "lying along the @xmath8 unification series @xmath44 , this sm group is the only possibility .",
    "the broken symmetry is @xmath45 ` structure group ' whose commutant in @xmath1 is the standard model group @xcite .",
    "the spectral cover geometrically describes it ( or the dual to gauge bundle ) satisfying supersymmetry conditions @xcite .",
    "roughly , it generalizes the notion of branes whose symmetry broken by recombination , so sometimes called by flavor brane stack , intersecting @xmath2 along the matter curves .",
    "it is described by factorized spectral cover @xmath46 @xmath47 where @xmath48 transforms as @xmath49 , the canonical bundle of @xmath2 .",
    "we also define @xmath50 as the normal bundle to @xmath2 in @xmath13 .",
    "( [ su5xu1cover ] ) is embedded in a compact threefold , , with the trivial bundle @xmath51 and the canonical bundle @xmath52 . ]",
    "whose projection to @xmath2 we denote @xmath53 .",
    "the parameters are the ones used in ( [ weieq ] ) projected on @xmath2 : using adjunction formula @xmath54 are sections of @xmath55 and the combination @xmath56 is a section of @xmath57 , with which the full equation for @xmath58 has no @xmath59 term showing the embeddability to a @xmath60 structure group . is the @xmath5 degree of freedom , it is sometimes called @xmath61 $ ] . ] using this embedding structure , one can be convinced that the parameters in ( [ weieq ] ) are the only possible combinations .",
    "we can recover the conventional @xmath4 gut by @xmath41 in ( [ smdisc ] ) , making its structure group traceless , reducing the above @xmath62 exactly to the standard one used in @xmath4 gut .",
    "the fields charged under two groups satisfy the green  schwarz relations @xcite , fixing @xmath63 to be trivial section .",
    "we get the matter spectrum from the decomposition of the adjoint @xmath64 of @xmath1 @xmath65 up to hermitian conjugates .",
    "matter fields are obtained as ` off - diagonal ' components of the branching @xcite .",
    "they are further identified by local gauge symmetry enhancement directions . for this , we parameterize their localizing curves using parameters @xmath66 having one - to - one correspondence with the five weights of @xmath67 of @xmath68 and @xmath69 with @xmath5 .",
    "for example , the @xmath6-boson appears from a local symmetry enhancement to @xmath4 , controlled by @xmath70 , agreeing with the above .",
    "however the physical parameters are only the coefficients in the spectral cover ( [ su5xu1cover ] ) : @xmath71 are the elementary symmetric polynomials of degree @xmath72 , of @xmath73 , and @xmath74 @xcite .",
    "@xmath75 is localized along the curve @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "the counting of @xmath78 and @xmath79 agrees thanks to the relation @xmath80 it is easy to see that the parameters @xmath81 , here calculated from group theory , agree with those in ( [ smdisc ] ) and ( [ su2disc ] ) .",
    "again @xmath82 reduces the matter curves to those of @xmath4 , so the @xmath4 gut structure is preserved .    in the perturbative picture , parallel d - branes do not intersect . here , the base of elliptic fibration has a similar structure generalizing hirzeburch surface , where the zero section of the fiber has nonzero ` self - intersection ' .",
    "thus @xmath17 and @xmath29 components intersect yielding chiral fermions @xmath6 and @xmath83 . in the sense of regarding the intersecting branes as connected cycles @xcite , this is not so different .    by dimensional reduction , we obtain yukawa coupling from covariant derivatives of gaugino of an enhanced group , as usual @xcite .",
    "so the gauge invariance guarantees the presence of yukawa couplings .",
    "they are @xmath84 where all the indices run from 1 to 5 , and all different .    due to the relation ( [ lepindex ] ) , lhs s of ( [ lhe ] ) vanish , and in each relation , we have two or more ways of writing _ the same _ coupling .",
    "for example in the last line , the first relation reduces the same relation to that of @xmath4 gut , in the limit @xmath82 .",
    "the second relates the matter curves for all @xmath83 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "we may track this from the left - right symmetric models and their extension ( pati  salam and trinification ) which relates up and down sectors by @xmath89 .",
    "we can switch between up - type and down - type fermions , like doing between georgi ",
    "glashow @xmath4 and flipped @xmath4 .",
    "for a general spectral cover , we have monodromy condition for connecting different matter curves @xcite . in our case",
    ", the @xmath68 has @xmath90 monodromy as reflected in the symmetric polynomial relations of the coefficients : the connected ones form an orbit and are treated as the identical surface .",
    "it leads to just one kind of lepton doublet , without distinguishing @xmath91 , @xmath85 or @xmath92 .    to remedy this",
    ", we further mod out the others by @xmath93 monodromy generated by the cyclic permutation of @xmath94 .",
    "it follows that , for instance , @xmath83 is distinguished by different orbits @xmath95 and @xmath96 , whereas @xmath6 is still @xmath97 .",
    "there are distinct candidates for the matters .",
    "for example lepton or higgs belongs to one of the following @xmath93 orbit @xmath98 with @xmath99 . to have lepton yukawa coupling",
    "( [ lhe ] ) , @xmath85 and @xmath91 must not share @xmath100 , therefore essentially we have two allowed cases for choosing @xmath29 doublets .",
    "we choose the fields as in table [ t : mcurve41 ] .",
    "we named the colored exotics as colored higgses @xmath101 and @xmath102 .",
    "note also that , by @xmath4 unification structure the fields belonging to a single multiplet has homologous curves .",
    "we identify two abelian symmetries generated by @xmath103 in the basis @xmath104 .",
    "the first is @xmath5 and the second is the famous ` @xmath105 ' symmetry , commutant to @xmath4 inside @xmath106 , providing continuous version of matter parity .",
    "since both @xmath87 and @xmath107 have even @xmath108 charges , we can forbid lepton or baryon number violating operators @xmath109 we may also have operators @xmath110 it turns out that neither @xmath6 nor @xmath111 exists in four dimensions , for later choice of the flux ( see ( [ zeromul ] ) below ) , so there will be no problem .",
    ".matter curves with @xmath93 monodromy .",
    "all the indices take value in @xmath112 and are different .",
    "the primed ones , charged exotics , have always odd @xmath113 charges . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "the resulting spectral cover is further factorized @xmath114 , thus ( [ su5xu1cover ] ) becomes @xmath115 with ` traceless condition ' @xmath116 .",
    "the new covers are for @xmath117 , and @xmath118 will be again related to elementary symmetry polynomials of degree @xmath119 out of @xmath120 . only @xmath121 and @xmath122 are nontrivially @xmath93 closed .",
    "we have additional degree of freedom to choose @xmath123 , a section @xmath124 .",
    "it follows @xmath125 are sections @xmath126 .    as discussed around ( [ lhe ] )",
    ", there are fields related by nonvanishing yukawa couplings .",
    "they originate from the same spectral cover .",
    "since the defining conditions @xmath127 are stronger than @xmath128 , we can derive all associated matter curves from the ` fundamental ' spectral covers @xmath127 for @xmath129 @xcite .",
    "for example the matter curve for @xmath86 is the common intersection between @xmath130 and @xmath131 , extracting the redundant component .    from the symmetry enhancement directions , as shown in table [",
    "t : mcurve41 ] , we can find the following classes of the matter curves : @xmath132 where we omitted pullback .",
    "the associated matter curves have @xmath133-independent components that lie outside @xmath2 but on the spectral cover . since @xmath134 is trivial section , thus @xmath135 and the matter curve with and without @xmath69 are homologous , for @xmath83 , @xmath88 , @xmath136 for example .",
    "again this exhibits the unification relations to @xmath4 gut .",
    "more detailed calculation is to be found elsewhere @xcite .",
    "to obtain four dimensional chiral spectrum , we should turn on a magnetic flux @xmath137 on the spectral cover @xmath138 @xcite . with above factorization",
    "we turn on the universal flux only on @xmath139 and @xmath140 parts , so we can turn off fluxes on them , and the even ( fourfold ) cover of @xmath139 allows that integral @xmath141 corresponds to integral spectral line bundle @xcite . ]",
    "@xmath142 we can show it has integral cohomology and traceless @xmath143 inside @xmath45 , where @xmath144 .",
    "it follows that @xmath111 , @xmath6 and the associated matters are all neutral to have zero multiplicity @xmath145 we calculate the net number of fields , or the differences @xmath146 between the numbers of fermions @xmath147 and antifermions @xmath148 by riemann  roch  hirzebruch index theorem .",
    "it assumes the same form for associated matter curves , namely the product of @xmath149 with the curves in ( [ curves ] ) , letting @xmath150 the projection @xmath151 @xcite .",
    "for example , we obtain @xmath152 where the dot product @xmath153 means the intersection between the divisors on @xmath2 and we used the poincar dual flux . in fact , kodaira vanishing theorem states that either chiral or antichiral fermion has exclusively nonzero in most cases @xcite . the anomaly cancellation condition for @xmath17 , @xmath154 ,",
    "requires also @xmath155 we choose @xmath156 to have the spectrum @xmath157 given the base @xmath13 of elliptic fibration , @xmath158 are determined purely by the property of @xmath2 .",
    "choosing @xmath2 such that @xmath159 , we get three generations of sm fermions , plus six pairs of doublet higgses and six pairs of colored higgses . since we make use of the section @xmath160 for @xmath5 we need @xmath161 .",
    "however it might imply the sm adjoint higgses unless @xmath2 is torsion - free .",
    "we obtained the sm gauge group and three generations of quarks and leptons _ without _ resorting to an intermediate unification .",
    "for the vectorlike electroweak and colored higgses , we have the standard doublet - triplet splitting problem , also tightly related to the @xmath162-problem .",
    "we can further elaborate the model employing different factorization and/or flux .",
    "already this model has desirable symmetries to shed light on a dynamical resolution .",
    "because of gauge invariance ( [ lhe ] ) and the vanishing theorem , bare mass terms of f - theory scale , close to the planck scale , are forbidden . however below some intermediate scale @xmath163 where the global symmetries and @xmath108 are broken , mass terms would be _ dynamically _ generated @xmath164 we expect some ` standard solution ' would generate the mass matrix @xmath165 and @xmath166 at the scale @xmath163 .",
    "we again emphasize the corresponding fields are distinguished by @xmath108 charges in table [ t : mcurve41 ] .",
    "we expect it would be broken down to @xmath167 symmetry , becoming _ matter parity _ @xcite",
    ". then still the terms ( [ rviolating ] ) are forbidden in the low energy .",
    "also this structure can be related to dynamical supersymmetry breaking @xcite .",
