    "the lattice dynamics of crystals composed of colloidal particles is entirely different from that of atoms .",
    "being immersed in a viscous solvent , colloids experience friction which strongly dampens their motion . as a result , phonons in colloidal systems  characterized by the polarization index @xmath1 and the wave - vector @xmath0  show an overdamped dynamics and decay exponentially with decay times @xmath2 .",
    "these times are related to the eigenvalues @xmath3 of the dynamical matrix which are refered to as the elastic bandstructure in the following .",
    "these eigenvalues may be pictured as the `` spring - constant '' associated with the phonon @xmath4 . in overdamped systems ,",
    "the relation between @xmath2 and @xmath3 is the phonon dispersion curve which replaces the relation between the frequency of the propagating phonons and the bandstructure @xmath3 in atomic systems .",
    "the phonon dispersion curve quantifies the response of a crystal to perturbations of a given wavelength ; as such it is _ the _ central relation of every crystal , characterizing both its static and dynamical properties .",
    "contrary to atomic systems , where the phonon dispersion curve is entirely determined by interparticle forces , in colloidal systems hydrodynamic interactions have to be considered .",
    "these interactions arise when moving colloids exchange momentum through the solvent .",
    "because of their long - ranged nature these interactions are difficult to treat theoretically , especially in crystals @xcite .",
    "it has been demonstrated by hurd et al .",
    "@xcite that along certain high symmetry directions within the colloidal crystal hydrodynamic interactions can be taken into account through the wavelength dependence of the friction coefficients @xmath5 .",
    "these coefficients connect the phonon decay times and the bandstructure such that in the limit of strong damping ( @xmath6 ) the phonon dispersion relation becomes @xmath7 .",
    "hence , with the wavelength dependence of the friction coefficients one obtains detailed information also on the hydrodynamic forces acting within colloidal crystals .    the purpose of this paper is to report measurements of colloidal crystal dispersion curves of thermally excited overdamped phonons , and , more specifically , measurements of the @xmath0-dependence of the friction coefficients involved .",
    "we will compare the experimental data with langevin simulations where the friction is taken into account only by the constant stokes friction .",
    "this comparison will demonstrate what effect the wavelength dependence of the friction can have on correlations in real space .",
    "the simulations also serve to check for the consistency of the evaluation procedure , for finite size effects as well as possible sampling errors .",
    "measuring @xmath0-dependent friction coefficients in colloidal crystals is experimentally demanding , and such experiments have  to our knowledge  never been attempted .",
    "such studies require the simultaneous measurement of both the decay times and the bandstructure . while decay times are experimentally accessible with dynamic light scattering techniques @xcite or brillouin scattering @xcite , the experimental determination of @xmath3 requires real space positional information .",
    "due to the mesoscopic time- and length scales , such information is accessible in colloidal systems with digital video microscopy which allows to follow particle positions with a resolution of a few nm at video rates as high as 25 hz .",
    "the literature on phonon dynamics in overdamped systems is still manageable .",
    "of central importance to the present paper is the work of hurd et al .",
    "@xcite who starting from @xcite not only present a theory of hydrodynamic interaction in colloidal crystals but also performed photon - correlation spectroscopy measurements to study the dispersion of lattice waves .",
    "early studies of single - particle dynamics within colloidal crystals employed scattering techniques @xcite , while the first video - microscopy experiments relevant for our question were presented by bongers and versmold @xcite who measured the particle mean square displacement as a function of time , later theoretically analysed within the framework of the langevin model in @xcite .",
    "hydrodynamics within colloidal systems that are not in the crystalline state , is the subject of a large number of papers .",
    "digital video microscopy has been used to investigate dynamic properties ( dynamic structure factor , the hydrodynamic function , hydrodynamic diffusion coefficients ) in colloidal suspensions confined between two parallel glass plates @xcite .",
    "colloidal friction has also been a major issue in recent optical tweezer measurements of the hydrodynamic interaction between two colloidal particles @xcite .",
    "the time - independent hydrodynamic forces as well as the cross - correlation function of the colloid position have been interpreted in terms of two - body hydrodynamic interactions , embodied by the oseen tensor . however , a two - body description of hydrodynamics in crystals is inadequat because of the neglect of many - body effects which dominate the hydrodynamic interaction in regular arrays of particles @xcite .",
    "when at long wavelengths the frictional force vanishes , damping can become so weak that even in colloidal systems phonons should be able to propagate .",
    "hurd et al . predicted a switch to such propagating modes for transverse modes but were not able to observe them , probably because of the finite - cell geometry and hydrodynamic wall effects  a conclusion that has later been corroborated by derksen et al . @xcite",
    "who carefully reconsidered the hurd experiment . an alternative explanation offered by felderhof and jones @xcite in terms of additional damping through retarded counterions",
    "was challenged by derksen et al .",
    "@xcite and hoppenbrouwers et al .",
    "evidence for overdamped transverse modes turning propagative at long wavelengths has later been produced by tata et al .",
    "@xcite in finite size millimeter crystals .",
    "we here completely ignore such propagating modes , returning to a brief discussion of their possible existence only in the last section .",
    "the paper starts with a short presentation of the overdamped langevin model of a colloidal crystal , which forms the basis of our simulations .",
    "then , the experimental setup is described , followed by a section in which we outline how bandstructures , friction coefficients and correlation functions are obtained from particle configurations . we proceed with the coefficients and the particle auto - correlation functions to show the differences between systems with and without wavelength - dependent friction , i.e. , the differences between simulation and experiment .",

    "these values are well above the ones observed in our experiments ; however , the band structure scales with @xmath21 as has been shown in [ 25 ] and , therefore , our simulations allow for a meaningful analysis of the experimental results .",
    "experiments were performed with an aqueous suspension of highly charged polystyrene spheres with @xmath54 diameter and a polydispersity below 4% .",
    "the particles interact via a screened coulomb potential , eq .  ( [ eq1 ] ) , with a renormalized surface charge of about @xmath55 @xcite and a screening length @xmath56 , determined as described further below .",
    "as sample cell we used a cuvette made of fused silica with @xmath57 spacing between top and bottom plate which was connected to a standard closed deionization circuit to maintain stable ionic conditions during the measurements . an argon - ion laser beam ( wave length = @xmath58 ) was scanned around the central region of the sample to create a boundary box whose size could be continuously adjusted by a pair of computer - controlled galvanostatically driven mirrors .",
    "this allowed us to adjust precisely the particle area density @xcite . at sufficiently high particle densities",
    "the particles form a hexagonal 2d colloidal crystal ( @xmath59 ) close to the bottom plate ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "out - of - plane fluctuations are reduced by pushing the particles down towards the bottom plate with a normal incident laser beam . due to the interplay of the electrostatic particle - wall repulsion and the light pressure from above , this results in a mean particle - wall distance of about @xmath60 and normal fluctuations of an amplitude of less than @xmath61 . by systematic variation of the light pressure",
    "we have verified that within our parameters it does not influence the results discussed below .",
    "it is known that 2d crystals can not have perfect long - ranged translational order because low-@xmath0 phonons destabilize the system .",
    "this would considerably reduce the quality of our measured particle configurations and the correlation functions generated from it .",

    "finite size effects would show up in strong variations of @xmath5 near the center of the bz - something we do not observe in fig .",

    "the different @xmath93 behavior of the friction coefficients can then be traced back to the decay times in this limit being considerably longer in the simulation than in reality , implying that experimentally the long wavelength phonons are decaying much faster than the langevin simulation with its constant friction assumption suggests .",

    "the friction coefficients then follow from multiplying both quantities .",
    "such a measurement is possible only with video - microscopy data  a technique whose most appealing property is that it allows us to directly `` see '' the overdamped dynamics of the colloids , in the form of the exponential decay of the phonon auto - correlation function in fig .",

    "our main finding is that in the long - wavelength limit , the friction coefficient vanishes , i.e. , @xmath107 for @xmath108 .",
    "this is clearly the case for the longitudinal modes while the extrapolated curves for the transversal modes show a small offset at @xmath95 which however is probably not a meaningful extrapolation .",
    "the vanishing of friction of long wavelength phonons is a very reasonable result .",
    "hurd et al . pointed out that in 3d colloidal crystals back flow will give an extra damping to longitudinal modes such that for @xmath109 the damping is even larger than the stokes friction coefficient .",
    "transverse modes , on the other hand , have been shown not to be affected by a backflow damping ; the flow induced by the collective motions of the spheres now adds constructively , leading to vanishing friction coefficients at long wavelengths .",
    "quite the same mechanism can be postulated to work for our 2d system : the transverse modes in the limit @xmath94 will also induce constructive interference of the flow , an overall flow field occurs going in the same direction than the moving colloids and , as a result , the colloidal particle show no longer motion relative to the surrounding fluid , leading to a vanishing of the friction and thus a faster decay of the overdamped phonons . for longitudinal modes ,",
    "our 2d system differs from the 3d system in that the 2d layer of particles is coupled to a third spatial dimension into which the flow is free to move .",
    "this third dimension prevents the back - flow damping , and a favorable interference of the flow into the third dimension should again be the reason for the vanishing of the friction coefficient for @xmath94 .",
    "however , a more detailed explanation  as well as a theoretical reproduction of @xmath5 in fig .  [ fig3 ]  has to wait for a proper hydrodynamic theory describing our system .",
    "such a theory must also account for hydrodynamic effects resulting from the walls confining our systems @xcite .",
    "our results might also be interesting to be reproduced applying more advanced simulation techniques @xcite taking into account many - particle hydrodynamics .    with these results in mind ,",
    "it is clear that taking a constant friction coefficient is a rather gross assumption of the overdamped langevin model .",
    "in addition , this model ignores that vanishing friction coefficients in the long wavelength limit necessarily permits phonons to start propagating ( though being still damped , but not overdamped ) .",
    "systematic deviations from the exponentials in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] might be seen as a first indication for the existence of such modes .",
    "however , it is also evident from fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] that given these deviations indeed signalize the onset of propagating phonons , they are still rather weak and far from being able to dominate the overall dynamics of the system .",

    "[ fig5 ] showing a particle auto - correlation function @xmath80 that agrees to the langevin prediction only within the first few seconds . beyond that time ,",
    "clear devations towards negative values in @xmath80 ( anti - correlated behavior ) can be observed , a feature which according to our previous remarks must be due to the combined effect of the wave - length dependence of the friction coefficient and , possibly , propagating modes .",
    "such a time - delayed anticorrelation has also been observed in the two - particle experiments and has been interpreted in terms of the standard oseen tensor hydrodynamic coupling @xcite .",
    "zahn et al . also showed that the oseen term in 2d colloidal suspensions can lead to an increase of the self - diffusion @xcite . again : how these results connect to our findings and how exactly hydrodynamics produces the anticorrelation , can only be clarified with an elaborate hydrodynamical theory .",
    "it is our hope that the present paper can stimulate the interest in such theoretical work .    as well as motivating research on hydrodynamics",
    "our work might open novel perspectives in studying crystals which exhibit non - overdamped particle dynamics .",
    "such crystals can be already realized using a dusty plasma @xcite where the micron - sized dust particles can be observed with videomicroscopy similar to colloidal crystals .",
    "this project received financial support from the austrian science foundation ( fwf ) under project title p18762 .",

    "<S> digital video - microscopy measurements are reported of both elastic bandstructures and overdamped phonon decay times in two - dimensional colloidal crystals . </S>",
    "<S> both quantities together allow to determine the friction coefficients along various high symmetry directions in @xmath0-space . </S>",
    "<S> these coefficients contain valuable information on the hydrodynamic forces acting between the colloidal particles . </S>",
    "<S> we find stokes - like friction for phonons near the edge of the first brillouin zone and vanishing friction coefficients for long wavelength phonons . </S>",
    "<S> the effect of this wavelength dependence in real - space is further investigated by simulating a crystal with constant friction ( langevin simulation ) and comparing experimentally measured and simulated particle auto - correlation functions . </S>"
