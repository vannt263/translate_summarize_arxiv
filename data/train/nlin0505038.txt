    "chaotic synchronization is one of the fundamental phenomena actively studied last time  @xcite , having important both theoretical and applied significance ( e.g. , for the information transmission by means of deterministic chaotic signals @xcite , in biological  @xcite and physiological  @xcite tasks , etc . ) .",
    "several different types of chaotic synchronization of coupled oscillators , i.e. generalized synchronization @xcite , phase synchronization @xcite , lag synchronization @xcite and complete synchronization @xcite are traditionally distinguished .",
    "there are also attempts to find a unifying framework for chaotic synchronization of coupled dynamical systems .    in our works",
    "@xcite it was shown that phase , generalized , lag and complete synchronization are closely connected with each other and , as a matter of fact , they are different manifestations of one type of synchronous oscillations behavior of coupled chaotic oscillators called time scale synchronization .",
    "synchronous regime character ( phase , generalized , lag or complete synchronization ) is defined by the presence of synchronous time scales @xmath0 , introduced by means of continuous wavelet transform   with molrlet mother wavelet function .",
    "each of time scales can be characterized by the phase @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the complex wavelet surface . in this case , the phenomenon of chaotic synchronization of coupled systems is manifested by a synchronous behavior of the phases of coupled chaotic oscillators @xmath3 observed on certain synchronized time scales range @xmath4 , for time scales @xmath0 from which the phase locking condition @xmath5 is satisfied , and the part of the wavelet spectrum energy being fallen on this range does not equal zero ( see  @xcite for detail ) .",
    "the range of synchronized time scales @xmath6 $ ] expands when the coupling parameter between systems increases .",
    "if the coupling type between oscillators is defined in such a way that the lag synchronization appearance is possible then all time scales become synchronized with further coupling parameter increasing , while the coinciding states of interacting oscillators are shifted in time relative to each other : @xmath7 .",
    "further coupling parameter increasing leads to a decrease of the time shift @xmath8 .",
    "the oscillators tend to the regime of complete synchronization , @xmath9 and the phase difference @xmath10 tends to be zero on all time scales .",
    "the time scale @xmath0 introduced into consideration by means of continuous wavelet transform can be considered as a quantity which is inversely proportional to the frequency @xmath11 defined with the help of fourier transformation . for the morlet mother wavelet function",
    "@xcite with parameter @xmath12 the relationship between the frequency @xmath11 and the time scale is quite simple : @xmath13 .",
    "therefore , the time scale synchronization should also manifest in the appearance of the phase relation between frequency components @xmath11 of corresponding fourier spectra @xmath14 of interacting oscillators .",
    "in this paper we consider the synchronization of spectral components of fourier spectra of coupled oscillators .",
    "we discuss the mechanism of chaotic synchronization regime manifestation in coupled dynamical systems based on the appearance of the phase relation between frequency components of fourier spectra of interacting chaotic oscillators ( see also  @xcite ) .",
    "one can also consider the obtained results as a criterion of existence ( or otherwise , an impossibility of existence ) of lag synchronization regime in coupled dynamical systems .",
    "the structure of this paper is the following . in section  [ sct : spectralcomponents ] we discuss the synchronization of spectral components of fourier spectra .",
    "we illustrate our approach with the help of two coupled rssler systems in sec .",
    "[ sct : resslers ] .",
    "the quantitative measure of synchronization is described in section  [ sct : measure ] .",
    "the universal power law taking place in the presence of time scale synchronization regime is discussed in sections  [ sct : vdp ] and [ sct : orbits ] .",
    "the final conclusion is presented in section  [ sct : conclusion ] .",
    "it should be noted that the continuous wavelet transform is characterized by the frequency resolution lower than the fourier transformation ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "the continuous wavelet transform appears as smoothing of the fourier spectrum , whereby the dynamics on a time scale @xmath0 is determined not only by the spectral component @xmath15 of the fourier spectrum .",
    "this dynamics is also influenced by the neighboring components as well , the degree of this influence depends both on their positions in the fourier spectrum and on their intensities .",
    "thus , the fact that coupled chaotic oscillators exhibit synchronization on a time scale @xmath0 of the wavelet spectrum by no means implies that the corresponding components @xmath15 of the fourier spectrum of these systems are also synchronized .",
    "let @xmath16 and @xmath17 be the time series generated by the first and the second coupled chaotic oscillators , respectively .",
    "the corresponding fourier spectra are determined by the relations @xmath18 accordingly , each spectral component @xmath11 of the fourier spectrum @xmath14 can be characterized by an instantaneous phase @xmath19 , where @xmath20 . however , since the phase @xmath21 corresponding to the frequency @xmath11 of the fourier spectrum @xmath14 increases with the time linearly , the phase difference of the interacting oscillators at this frequency @xmath22 is always bounded and , hence , the traditional condition of phase entrainment ( used for detection of the phase synchronization regime ) @xmath23 is useless .",
    "apparently , a different criterion should be used to detect the synchronization of coupled oscillators at a given frequency @xmath11 .    in the regime of lag synchronization ,",
    "the behavior of coupled oscillators is synchronized on all time scales @xmath0 of the wavelet transform ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , one can expect that all frequency components of the fourier spectra of the systems under consideration should be synchronized as well . in this case ,",
    "@xmath24 and , hence , taking into account ( [ eq : fouriertransform ] ) one has to obtain @xmath25 thus , in the case of coupled chaotic oscillators occurring in the regime of lag synchronization their instantaneous phases corresponding to the spectral component @xmath11 of the fourier spectra @xmath26 will be related to each other as @xmath27 and , hence , the phase difference @xmath28 of coupled oscillators on the frequency @xmath11 must obey the relation @xmath29 accordingly , the points corresponding to the phase difference @xmath30 of the spectral components of chaotic oscillators in the regime of lag synchronization on the @xmath31 plane must fit a straight line with slope @xmath32 . in the case of complete synchronization of two coupled identical oscillators the slope of this line",
    "@xmath33 is equal to zero ( see also  @xcite ) .",
    "the destroying of the lag synchronization regime ( e.g. , as a result of decrease of the coupling strength between oscillators ) and transition to the regime of phase synchronization ( in the case when the instantaneous phase of chaotic signal can be introduced correctly @xcite ) results in the loss of synchronism for a part of time scales @xmath0 of the wavelet spectra  @xcite .",
    "accordingly , one can expect that a part of spectral components of the fourier spectra in the phase synchronization regime will also lose synchronism and the points on the @xmath31 plane will deviate from the straight line ( [ eq : phasedifcondition ] ) mentioned above  .",
    "it is reasonable to assume that synchronism will be lost primarily for the spectral components @xmath11 characterized by a small fraction of energy in the fourier spectra @xmath26 , while the components corresponding to a greater energy fraction will remain synchronized and the corresponding points on the @xmath31 plane will be located at the straight line as before . as the lag synchronization regime does not occur in the system any more , the time shift @xmath8 can be determined by the delay of the most energetic frequency component @xmath34 in the fourier spectra @xmath35 .",
    "as the coupling parameter decreases further , an increasing part of the spectral components will deviate from synchronism .",
    "however , as long as the most `` energetic '' components remain synchronized , the coupled systems will exhibit the regime of time scale synchronization .",
    "obviously , that for the synchronized spectral component the phase difference @xmath30 is located after the transient finished independently on initial conditions .    to describe the synchronization of spectral components ,",
    "let us introduce a quantitative characteristic of a number of spectral components of the fourier spectra @xmath26 occurring in the regime of synchronism ,    @xmath36    where @xmath37 is the heaviside function , @xmath38 is the threshold power level ( in db ) above which the spectral components are taken into account , and @xmath8 is determined by the time shift of the most energetic frequency component ( @xmath34 ) in the fourier spectra , @xmath35 .",
    "the quantity @xmath39 tends to be zero in the regimes of complete and lag synchronization .",
    "after the lag synchronization regime destroying caused by the decrease of the coupling strength the value of @xmath39 increases with the number of desynchronized spectral component of the fourier spectra @xmath26 of coupled oscillators .",
    "real data are usually represented by discrete time series of a finite length . in such cases ,",
    "the continuous fourier transform ( [ eq : fouriertransform ] ) has to be replaced by its discrete analog ( as it was done in  @xcite ) , and the integral ( [ eq : sigma_l_int ] ) , by the sum @xmath40 taken over all spectral components of the fourier spectra @xmath26 with the power above @xmath38 . in calculating @xmath39",
    ", it is expedient to perform averaging over a set of time series @xmath41 .",
    "the phase shift @xmath30 can be calculated either in the way as it was done in  @xcite or by means of cross spectrum  @xcite .",
    "in order to illustrate the approach proposed above , let us consider two coupled rssler systems @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the coupling parameter , @xmath44 , @xmath45 . by analogy with the case studied in  @xcite ,",
    "the values of control parameters have been selected as follows : @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",

    "there are no synchronous spectral components for such coupling strength and dots are scattered randomly over the @xmath31 plane . the weak phase synchronization ( @xmath49 ) after the regime occurence is shown in the fig .",
    "1,_c_. there are a few synchronized spectral components the phase shift @xmath30 of which satisfies the condition ( [ eq : phasedifcondition ] ) .",

    "accordingly , in this case all points on the @xmath31 plane are at the line ( [ eq : phasedifcondition ] ) with slope @xmath32 .",
    "with coupling strength @xmath43 increasing , the value of @xmath39 decreases monotonically that verifies the assumption that when two coupled chaotic systems undergo transition from asynchronous dynamics to lag synchronization , more and more spectral components become synchronized . when all spectral components @xmath11 are synchronized , the phase shift @xmath30 for them is @xmath63 , therefore the points on the @xmath31 plane lie on the straight line  ( [ eq : phasedifcondition ] ) and the value of @xmath39 is equal to zero .    another important question is which spectral components of the fourier spectra of interacting chaotic oscillators are synchronized first and which do it last .",
    "figure  2,_a _ shows a plot of the @xmath39 value for the coupling strength @xmath49 ( corresponding to the weak phase synchronization ) versus power @xmath38 at which the spectral components @xmath57 of the fourier spectra @xmath26 are taken into account in equation  ( [ eq : sigma_l ] ) .",
    "one can see that the `` truncation '' of the spectral components with small energy leads to a decrease of the @xmath39 value .",
    "figures 1,_b_1,_e _ illustrate the distribution of the phase difference @xmath30 of the spectral components @xmath11 with the power exceeding the preset level @xmath38 . the data in fig .",
    "2 show that the most `` energetic '' spectral components are first synchronized upon the onset of time scale synchronization . on the contrary ,",
    "the components with low energies are the first to go out from synchronism upon destroying of the lag synchronization regime .",
    "let us briefly discuss a criterion of spectral components synchronization .",
    "obviously , the relation ( [ eq : phasedifcondition ] ) is quite convenient as a criterion of synchronism in case of lag synchronization destroying in the way considered above .",
    "if the type of coupling between systems has been defined in such a manner that the lag synchronization regime can not appear , the relation ( [ eq : phasedifcondition ] ) can not be the criterion of spectral components synchronization .",
    "so , as a general criterion of synchronism of identical spectral components @xmath11 of coupled systems we have to select the different condition rather than ( [ eq : phasedifcondition ] ) .",
    "as such a criterion we have chosen the establishment of the phase shift @xmath64 which must not depend on initial conditions . to illustrate it let us consider the distribution of phase difference @xmath30 obtained from the series of @xmath65 experiments for rssler systems  ( [ eq : roessler ] ) .",
    "fig.3,_a _ corresponds to the asynchronous dynamics of coupled oscillators when the coupling parameter @xmath51 is below the threshold of chaotic synchronization appearance ( see also fig .",
    "one can see , that the phase difference @xmath30 for the spectral components @xmath11 of fourier spectra @xmath66 in this case is distributed randomly over all interval from @xmath67 to @xmath68 .",
    "it means that the phase shift between spectral components @xmath11 is different for each experiment ( i.e. , for different initial conditions ) and , therefore , there is no synchronism whereas the considered frequency @xmath11 is the same for both spectra @xmath26 .",
    "the similar distributions are observed for all spectral components @xmath11 in the case of asynchronous regime ( see also fig .",
    "1,_a _ and fig .",

    "compare with fig .  1 ]",
    "when the systems demonstrate synchronous behavior the distributions @xmath71 of phase shift @xmath72 are quite different . in this case",
    "one can distinguish both synchronized and non - synchronized spectral components characterized by distributions of phase shift of different types . in fig .",
    "3,_c _ the distribution of @xmath72 for synchronous spectral component @xmath30 is shown .",
    "one can see that it looks like @xmath73-function that means the phase shift @xmath72 is always the same after transient finished .",
    "obviously , this phase shift @xmath72 does not depend on initial conditions .",
    "for the non - synchronized spectral components the distributions @xmath71 are different ( see fig .",
    "evidently , in this case the phase shift @xmath72 is varied from experiment to experiment . at the same time , the tendency to the synchronization of these spectral components can be observed .",
    "the distribution @xmath71 looks like gaussian . with the coupling parameter increasing",
    "the dispersion of it decreases and the spectral components @xmath11 of considered fourier spectra @xmath26 tend to be synchronized .",
    "the same effect can be observed in fig  1,_b - f_. with coupling parameter @xmath43 increasing , the points on the @xmath31 plane tend to fit a straight line with slope @xmath32 and their scattering decreases .",
    "so , the general criterion of synchronism of identical spectral components @xmath11 of coupled systems is the establishment of the phase shift ( [ eq : phasedifcondition_2 ] ) after transient finished .",
    "it is important to note that the case of classical synchronization of periodical oscillations also obeys to considered criterion ( [ eq : phasedifcondition_2 ] ) ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "let us consider now the quantitative characteristic of synchronization . in  @xcite",
    "the measure of synchronization based on the normalized energy of synchronous time scales has been introduced .",
    "the analogous quantity @xmath74 may be defined for fourier spectra @xmath14 as @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the set of synchronized spectral components and @xmath77 is the full energy of chaotic oscillations .",
    "in fact , the value of @xmath74 is the part of the full system energy corresponding to synchronized fourier components .",
    "this measure @xmath74 is 0 for the nonsynchronized oscillations and 1 for the case of complete and lag synchronization regimes as well as the quantity introduced in  @xcite .",
    "when the systems undergo transition from asynchronous behavior to the lag synchronization regime the measure of synchronism takes the value between 0 and 1 that corresponds to the case when there are both synchronized and nonsynchronized spectral components in fourier spectra @xmath26 .     for the first rssler system ( [ eq : roessler ] ) on coupling parameter @xmath43 ]    for the real data represented by discrete time series of a finite length one have to use the discrete analog of fourier transform while the integrals in the relation  ( [ eq : rho ] ) should be replaced by the sums @xmath79 where @xmath80 while the sum in the equation ( [ eq : rho_sum ] ) is being calculated only synchronized spectral components @xmath81 should be taken into account .",
    "figure  4 presents the dependence of the synchronization measure @xmath74 for the first rssler oscillator of system  ( [ eq : roessler ] ) on the coupling parameter @xmath43 .",
    "it is clear that the part of the energy corresponding to the synchronized spectral components grows with the coupling strength increasing .",
    "let us now consider how the closed frequency components of two coupled oscillators behave with increase of the coupling strength @xmath43 . as a model of such situation let us select two mutually coupled van - der - pol oscillators @xmath82 where @xmath83 are slightly mismatched natural cyclic frequencies , @xmath84 are the variables , describing the behavior of the first and the second self - sustained oscillators , respectively .",
    "the parameter @xmath43 characterizes the coupling strength between oscillators .",
    "nonlinearity parameter @xmath85 has been chosen small enough in order to make oscillations of self  sustained generators close to the single frequency ones .",
    "asymmetrical type of coupling in system  ( [ eq : vdp ] ) ensures the appearance of the synchronous regime which is similar to the lag synchronization in chaotic systems . for such type of coupling the oscillations in the synchronous regime",
    "are characterized by one frequency @xmath86 while small phase shift @xmath30 between time series @xmath41 , decreasing when coupling strength increases , takes place .    using the method of complex amplitudes",

    "evidently , if the type of coupling between oscillators is selected in such manner that the phase shift @xmath30 of synchronized spectral components satisfies the condition  ( [ eq : deltaphi ] ) , the appearance of the lag synchronization regime is possible for the large enough values of the coupling strength .",
    "otherwise , if the established phase shift does not satisfy the condition  ( [ eq : deltaphi ] ) , the realization of the lag synchronization regime in the system is not possible for such kind of coupling .",
    "so , the relation  ( [ eq : deltaphi ] ) can be considered as the criterion of the possibility of the existence ( or , otherwise , impossibility of existence ) of lag synchronization regime in coupled dynamical systems .",

    "starting from the certain coupling parameter value the synchronization of the main spectral components of fourier spectra of interacting chaotic oscillators takes place .",
    "therefore , for these spectral components @xmath11 the condition ( [ eq : phasedifcondition_2 ] ) is satisfied . in this case",
    "one can detect the presence of the time scale synchronization regime ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "if for the considered systems one can introduce correctly the instantaneous phase of chaotic signal  @xcite , one will also detect easily the phase synchronization by means of traditional approach ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .    with further coupling parameter increasing ,",
    "more spectral components become synchronized .",
    "if the coupling between interacting systems is selected in a such way that the lag synchronization regime can be realized then the time shift between synchronized spectral components obeys the power law  ( [ eq : tau ] ) .",
    "the spectral components characterized by the large value of energy become synchronized first .",
    "accordingly , the part of energy being fallen on the synchronized spectral components increases from @xmath135 ( asynchronous dynamics ) to 1 ( the lag synchronization regime ) .",
    "synchronization of all frequency components corresponds to the appearance of the lag synchronization regime .",
    "with further coupling strength increase , the time lag @xmath8 obeying the relation  ( [ eq : tau ] ) tends to be zero , and related oscillations tend to demonstrate the complete synchronization regime . in this case",
    "the time shift @xmath8 between synchronized components does not depend on frequency @xmath11 of considered components ( it is the same for all synchronized components ) and obeys the power law  ( [ eq : tau ] ) with the exponent @xmath122 . the time shift between synchronized `` in  phase '' upos embedded in chaotic attractors also obeys the same power law .",
    "so , in the present paper the mechanism of chaotic synchronization regime appearance in coupled dynamical systems , based on the arising of the phase relation between frequency components of fourier spectra of interacting chaotic oscillators has been discussed .",
    "the obtained results concerning the power law  ( [ eq : tau ] ) may be also considered as the criterion of possible existence ( or , otherwise , impossibility of existence ) of lag synchronization regime in coupled dynamical systems ( i.e. , the lag synchronization regime can not be observed in the coupled chaotic oscillators system unless the time shift between synchronized components obeys the power law  ( [ eq : tau ] ) ) .",
