    "the main thrust of this work is to understand the undulation phenomena in smectic a liquid crystals caused by a strong magnetic field .",
    "the mathematical framework for our study is the model introduced by de gennes @xcite .",
    "the landau de gennes energy describes the state of the liquid crystal in terms of a director @xmath1 and a complex order parameter @xmath2 for the layered structure .",
    "the molecular mass density is defined by @xmath3 where @xmath4 is a locally uniform mass density , @xmath5 is the mass density of the smectic layers , and @xmath6 parametrizes the layers so that @xmath7 is the direction of the layer normal . also , @xmath8 is the wave number and @xmath9 is the layer thickness .",
    "the state @xmath10 corresponds to no layered structure ( the sample is in a nematic phase ) .",
    "if @xmath11 is a nonzero constant , then the sample is in a smectic state throughout .",
    "the contribution to the energy due to the external magnetic field is accounted for by the magnetic free energy density@xmath12 where @xmath13 is the magnetic anisotropy , @xmath14 is the magnitude of the magnetic field and @xmath15 is a unit vector representing the direction of the field .",
    "we assume that @xmath16 . as a consequence",
    ", the director has a preferred orientation perpendicular to the direction of the applied magnetic field .",
    "is assumed to be positive ; in that case the preferred orientation for the director is parallel to the field which fully specifies the orientation in that @xmath17 setting . ]    in the one constant approximation case for the oseen - frank nematic energy , the total free energy for smectic a is given by , @xmath18 where the material parameters @xmath19 and temperature dependent parameter @xmath20 are fixed positive constants and @xmath21 is a rectangular box .",
    "this models a smectic a liquid crystal with smectic layers parallel to the top and bottom boundaries .",
    "in our study we assume that the magnetic field is applied in the @xmath22-direction , perpendicular to the layers , that is @xmath23with the director constraint @xmath24 , we rewrite the magnetic energy density @xmath25 by omitting the constant term .",
    "we define the dimensionless order parameter , @xmath26 , and do the change of variables @xmath27 with @xmath28 , and obtain the following nondimensionalized energy @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 with @xmath32 and @xmath33 . the values @xmath34 and @xmath35",
    "are employed in @xcite .",
    "the dimensionless parameter @xmath36 is in fact the ratio of the layer thickness to the sample thickness .",
    "the case @xmath37 corresponds to a lower dimensional approximation and this is the point of view in the works @xcite where the emergence of interesting structures is captured in minimizers via a @xmath38-convergence approach .",
    "we point out that his kind of variational dimension reduction has already been considered in the analysis of the related ginzburg - landau model @xcite .",
    "one strength of our approach is that we do not require @xmath36 to be small but just that it avoids values at which resonances occur .",
    "the other advantage is that the branches we find do not only start near the lowest critical field but at higher bifurcation values as well , so that metastable bifurcations are also obtained .",
    "we are interested in studying the stability of the uniformly layered state : @xmath39 to that end , we impose periodic boundary conditions for @xmath40 and @xmath41 in the @xmath42 and @xmath43 directions , while we assume dirichlet boundary conditions for @xmath40 and @xmath41 on the boundary plates : @xmath44 for all @xmath45\\times\\lbrack-\\pi / b,\\pi / b]$ ] . with this boundary condition",
    ", we assume that @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the two torus identified with @xmath48\\times\\lbrack-\\pi / b,\\pi / b]$ ] and @xmath49 $ ] .",
    "it is known that the application of an electric or magnetic field of large enough strength , or bare mechanical tension @xcite , can trigger the emergence of undulations in the smectic layers : this is called the helfrich - hurault effect @xcite . in @xcite , the effect of a magnetic field on a @xmath17 smectic a liquid crystal was considered ; a threshold value of the intensity , above which periodic layer undulations are observed , was estimated and a nontrivial solution curve was found .",
    "the proof relied on crandall - rabinowitz bifurcation theory for simple eigenvalues and thus the solution curve branches off of the lowest eigenvalue .",
    "in our situation , the spectral analysis of the linearized operator about the uniformly layered state gives a lowest eigenvalue which is not simple and so we can not follow the same route to study the instability of the undeformed state at the critical magnetic field . instead , we work in a space of maximal symmetries where the resonances are avoided ; this is akin to the palais principle of symmetric criticality @xcite .",
    "the previous analysis yields the existence of branches stemming from the critical magnetic field with the symmetries of these one dimensional fixed point subspaces of irreducible representations(see section [ bifurcation ] for more details ) .",
    "a similar approach has been used to obtain multi - pole periodic solutions to the gross - pitaevskii equation in the plane @xcite ; these solutions arise as global bifurcations of a nonlinear schrdinger equation .",
    "our main result is the following .",
    "[ tmain]there exists a critical magnetic field @xmath50 such that the uniformly layered state has two bifurcating solutions starting from @xmath51 except for a finite union of hypersurfaces in the set of parameters @xmath52 one of these branches is stable .    in section [ bifurcation ] we give more precise information about these branches , in particular we find their symmetries and in [ localestimates ] we provide their local asymptotic profile .",
    "we are also able to retrieve other bifurcation branches not covered by theorem [ tmain ] , namely for the resonant case @xmath53 ( see proposition [ propab ] for more details ) .",
    "next , we investigate what happens at each cross section of the domain under the assumption that the magnetic field is large enough to render a planar configuration .",
    "we find this reduced model bears strong resemblance with the one for micromagnetics considered in @xcite and from this we derive important qualitative information about minimizers in the limit @xmath54 including a general compactness statement and a sharp lower bound that allows us to compare between natural candidates for the optimal pattern .",
    "finally , we provide some numerical evidence in support of our findings .",
    "we now give an outline of the paper . in the next section",
    "we introduce notation and the functional setting where our bifurcation problem is posed .",
    "we then proceed to study the spectral problem of the linearized operator at the undeformed state and derive the critical field in section [ spectrum ] . in section [ bifurcation ]",
    "we study the irreducible representations associated to @xmath55 and the corresponding isotropy groups ; from these we obtain two fixed one dimensional subspaces were we find the aforementioned bifurcation branches .",
    "we move to the @xmath17 dimensional problem in section [ planar ] and deduce the periodicity of minimizers . in the final section we present the numerical simulations depicting the @xmath17 planar configurations and layers at the onset of undulations , confirming that the estimate of the critical field from our theory is consistent with the numerical results .",
    "we start by introducing some notation which is going to be essential for the bifurcation analysis .",
    "let @xmath56 be a group .",
    "we recall that a hilbert space @xmath57 is a @xmath56-*representation * , if there is a morphism of groups given by the map @xmath58 .",

    "therefore , the eigenvalue @xmath230 crosses zero at @xmath169 .",
    "the solution to ( [ equation - g ] ) is given by @xmath231 which leads to the eigenfunction @xmath232    moreover , we would like to choose the eigenfunctions such that the condition @xmath233 becomes @xmath234 . then , the eigenfunction @xmath189 such that @xmath235 are@xmath236 thus the eigenvalue problem ( [ euler ] ) has eigenvalues @xmath230 which is zero at the critical value @xmath147 and corresponding eigenfunctions @xmath189 .    we have considered the domain with sides @xmath59 in order to simplify the spectrum , as it appears in terms of @xmath237 , @xmath238 and @xmath239.we conclude :    for all @xmath181 we have @xmath240 and @xmath241    [ remark : critical - field]in order to find the critical value of @xmath147 , we minimize ( [ linearfunctional ] ) over functions satisfying @xmath242 . therefore , one can see that the first critical field is the minimum of the @xmath243@xmath244 following the proof of proposition [ prop : linear ] , one can see that @xmath243 can be achieved from the system ( [ equation - f])-([equation - h ] ) with @xmath224 .",

    "in particular , theorem 4 of @xcite proves that the first eigenvalue is estimated as @xmath248 when the interval for @xmath22 is @xmath249 .",
    "since the scaling used in this paper gives the interval @xmath250 for @xmath22 , it is easy to see that the first eigenvalue is estimated @xmath251",
    "as anticipated , the first step is to identify the irreducible representations associated to @xmath252 due to schur s lemma , all eigenvalues @xmath230 of @xmath146 corresponding to this representation are the same , and then , if one does not consider the symmetries the resonances make the proof of the bifurcation difficult or impossible .    in the second step ,",
    "the strategy is to identify the isotropy groups that have a fixed point space of dimension one in the irreducible representation , and then , using the implicit function theorem in the restricted point space of this isotropy groups , we can obtain simple bifurcation , that is without resonances .",
    "however , we do not claim to find them all , although the two we find are enough to characterize the loss of stability of the uniform state to a preferred branch while at the same time shows the emergence of other interesting solutions satisfying different symmetries , as soon as one crosses the critical field @xmath253    the symmetries of the bifurcation solutions are given by the isotropy groups with these properties .",

    "there are at least two kind of isotropy groups that have fixed point spaces of dimension one .",
