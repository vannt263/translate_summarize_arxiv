    "one of the remarkable discoveries from x - ray observations of the galactic center ( gc ) region is the galactic center diffuse x - ray emission ( gcdx ) extending over @xmath5300 pc ( @xmath6 ) , and that the gcdx has a prominent highly ionized iron line at 6.7 kev @xcite .",
    "asca detected fe and fe emission lines from the gcdx , and its spectrum could interpreted to be emitted from a hot plasma of @xmath7 kev @xcite .",
    "chandra , with an extremely high spatial resolution of @xmath8 , has detected many x - ray point sources in the gc region .",
    "the total flux of the detected point sources is not enough to explain all of the gcdx @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , @xcite indicate that the x - ray emission can be completely explained by integration of point sources .",
    "suzaku revealed that the origin of the iron lines is not the charge - exchange of cosmic - rays with molecular clouds , but collisional ionization of hot plasma with a temperature of @xmath9 kev @xcite .",
    "moreover , the spatial distribution is different from that of point sources observed by chandra , suggesting that the main part of the emission is from truly diffuse plasma in @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "where the hot plasma has extended is not yet clear .",
    "in addition , the origin of the huge thermal energy ( @xmath11 ergs ) of the hot diffuse plasma is a serious mystery .",
    "one hypothesis is a multiple supernova explosions scenario in which the dynamical timescale of @xmath12 years for the hot plasma requires tens of supernova explosions during a period of ten thousand years .",
    "since a few supernova remnants ( snrs ) have been detected so far , there would exist many undiscovered snrs .",
    "another remarkable discovery is diffuse emission of fe at 6.4  kev .",
    "it was firstly detected by asca .",
    "in particular , bright emission regions of the 6.4  kev line have consistent positions of the giant molecular clouds of sgr  b2 , sgr  c , and the radio arc @xcite . their x - ray spectra exhibit a large equivalent width ( @xmath13 kev ) for the fe emission line and deep absorption column ( @xmath14 @xmath15 ) .",
    "this suggests that those molecular clouds were irradiated with hard x - rays from an external source and `` reflected '' them as the 6.4 kev x - rays ( x - ray reflection nebulae ; xrne ) .",
    "there is no irradiating source with a luminosity of @xmath16 ergs s@xmath17 to explain those 6.4  kev x - rays in the gc region .",
    "@xcite proposed a scenario of a past x - ray outburst of the supermassive black hole at sgr  a*. since its present luminosity is @xmath18 ergs s@xmath17 @xcite , it would have been @xmath19 times brighter than now 300 years ago .",
    "on the other hand , @xcite suggest that the 6.4 kev x - rays are due to collision of low - energy cosmic - ray electrons with this molecular gas because of a correlation between non - thermal radio filaments and the x - ray features .",
    "the scenario explains not only the fe k@xmath2 emission , but also the cosmic - ray heating of molecular gas and diffuse tev emission from the galactic molecular clouds .",
    "the radio complex sgr  b1 , located to the west , or to the negative galactic longitude of the sgr  b2 giant molecular cloud consists of a h region surrounded by a molecular loop @xcite .",
    "the expansion of the molecular loop is explained by past activity of the h region @xcite .",
    "a 6.4  kev clump was discovered in this region by @xcite .",
    "oh and h@xmath20o masers have been found , and many intermediate and/or low - mass stars are formed @xcite .",
    "the x - ray imaging spectrometers ( xis ) aboard suzaku have characteristic features of a large effective area and a low / stable background .",
    "the xis are instruments suitable to observe diffuse and faint objects , such as xrne and snrs .",
    "we had observed the sgr  b1 region for about 100 ksec with suzaku in order to obtain a good spectrum of the new 6.4  kev cloud detected by @xcite",
    ". we report on results of the observation .",
    "we observed the sgr  b1 region with suzaku on 2006 march 2729 . though the suzaku observation was performed with the hard x - ray detector @xcite and the xis , we concentrate on the xis data in this paper .",
    "the xis system consists of four sets of ccd cameras ( designated as xis0 , 1 , 2 , and 3 ) placed on the focal planes of the four x - ray telescopes ( xrt ) , whose half - power diameters are @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "xis0 , 2 , and 3 have front - illuminated ( fi ) ccds , while xis1 contains a backside - illuminated ( bi ) ccd .",
    "the energy resolution of the xis was @xmath22 ev at 5.9 kev ( calibration source of @xmath23fe ) when this observation was performed .",
    "the details of suzaku , xis , and xrt are given in @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , respectively .",
    "the xis data were taken in the normal mode .",
    "the xis pulse - height data for each x - ray event were converted to pulse invariant ( pi ) channels using the xispi software version 2006 - 12 - 26 , and the calibration database version 2006 - 05 - 22 . after removing the epoch of low - earth elevation angles less than 5 degrees ( elv@xmath24 ) , the day earth elevation angle less than 10 degrees ( dye_elv@xmath25 ) and the south atlantic anomaly ( saa ) , the effective exposure time was about 95 ks .",
    "we performed the data reduction and the analysis using headas software 6.1.2 and xspec  11.3.2 .",
    "in spectral fittings , we used the xis response files released on 2006 - 08 - 01 by the suzaku xis team , and generated auxiliary files with xissimarfgen in headas software 6.1.2 .",
    "since the relative gains among fi sensors are well calibrated and the response functions are essentially the same , we co - added their data .",
    "we also applied non - x - ray background ( nxbg ) data from the night - earth data released by the suzaku xis team .",
    "the nxbg data were sorted with the geomagnetic cut - off rigidity ( cor ) because of the variation of the nxbg corresponding to the cor values .",

    "we made the same profiles for the sgr  b1 region of @xmath30 , and compared them with the results of @xcite .",
    "first , we divided the sgr  b1 region into 4 @xmath31 4 small regions , excluding the four corners illuminated by the built - in calibration sources , as shown in figure  [ fig:3maps]d .",
    "next , we obtained the co - added spectrum of the 3 fis ( xis0 , 2 , and 3 ) for each small region .",
    "we finally obtained 6.7  kev and 6.9  kev line fluxes and their ratio for each small region by fitting the spectrum with a continuum ( thermal bremsstrahlung ) , fe lines , which are fe k@xmath2 and k@xmath32 ( 6.4 and 7.05 kev ) , fe k@xmath2 ( 6.7 kev ) , and fe ly@xmath2 ( 6.9 kev ) , and the cosmic x - ray background ( cxb ) .",
    "@xcite suggested that the 6.7  kev emission smoothly extends to the sgr  b2 region ( @xmath33 ) with almost the same temperature .",

    "we note that the three data points indicated with filled circles in the sgr  b2 region , having high 6.7  kev fluxes and low flux ratios between the 6.7  kev and 6.9  kev lines , correspond to snr g0.61 + 0.01 , which @xcite recently discovered with suzaku .",
    "the plasma temperature of g0.61 + 0.01 is @xmath35 kev @xcite , which is significantly lower than that of the gcdx ( @xmath3667 kev : @xcite ) .",
    "we can see that the 6.7 kev intensity of the small region [ 32 ] is rather higher than expected from the whole tendency , and that the ratio of [ fe]/[fe ] is lower than the average of the gcdx .",
    "g0.61 + 0.01 is located to the east of the small region [ 32 ] ( see figure  [ fig : gc - sgrb2 ] ) .",

    "the x - ray flux from the gcdx is rather different from position to position .",
    "we thus selected the dashed region in figure [ fig:3maps]a for the background region , so that the average line flux of the 6.7  kev line ( the reference of the gcdx ) is almost the same between the region for the g0.42@xmath10.04 ( the small region [ 21 ] ) and the one for the background ( the small regions [ 10 ] and [ 11 ] ) .",
    "figure [ fig : g0.4spectra ] shows no residuals at the iron emission lines of 6.7 and 6.9  kev .",
    "it is thus confirmed that background emission from the gcdx was successfully subtracted .",
    "additionally , the nxbg and cxb are also thought to be subtracted .    since there",
    "exist many x - ray point sources in the gc region , we next checked the contribution from point sources .",

    "1e 1743.1@xmath12843 is reported to be a neutron star or a black - hole low - mass x - ray binary in the gc region , or toward the gc region , but beyond there @xcite .    in the case that 1e 1743.1@xmath12843 is located in the gc region , the projected distance to the m0.51@xmath10.10 xrn",
    "is @xmath143 . since the power - law slope for the x - ray spectrum of 1e 1743.1@xmath12843",
    "is reported to be @xmath144 by @xcite , we obtained that a luminosity of @xmath145 is required for the 6.4  kev line flux of m0.51@xmath10.10 . however , 1e 1743.1@xmath12843 persistently has a luminosity of @xmath146 ergs s@xmath17 ( e.g. , @xcite ) , which is 2-orders lower than the required luminosity .",
    "in addition , no bursts have been observed from 1e 1743.1@xmath12843 in extensive observations over the last 20 years . in the case that 1e 1743.1@xmath12843 would be beyond the gc region , it is too far to account for the 6.4  kev line flux of m0.51@xmath10.10 .",
    "thus , 1e 1743.1@xmath12843 is unlikely to be the irradiating source of m0.51@xmath10.10 .",
    "the total luminosity of all cataloged bright point sources within 50 pc ( @xmath147 ) from m0.51@xmath10.10 is @xmath148 ergs s@xmath17 , which is far lower than the required luminosity of @xmath149 .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , and @xcite have proposed a gc supermassive black hole , sgr  a * , as the irradiating source of other x - ray reflection nebulae , sgr b2 and sgr c. sgr  a * is then thought to have been @xmath150 times brighter about 300 years ago , the light traveling time between sgr  b2 and sgr  a*.    we applied the xrn scenario by past activity of sgr a * to m0.51@xmath10.10 .",
    "the sgr  b molecular complex , consisting of sgr b1 ( @xmath151 ) and b2 ( @xmath152 ) , belongs to the `` galactic - center molecular arm '' surrounding sgr  a * @xcite .",
    "sgr  b1 and sgr  b2 are located at the same three - dimensional distance from sgr  a * ( @xmath153 pc ) though the projected distances are different . the photon index for sgr a *",
    "is reported to be @xmath154 by @xcite , which is not consistent with that of m0.51@xmath10.10 ( @xmath155 ) .",
    "however , @xcite reported that the photon index became hard ( @xmath156 ) when sgr a * was in a flare - up state .",
    "@xcite and @xcite assumed that the photon index is 2.0 for the power - law spectrum of sgr a * , and reported that the required luminosity for sgr b2 xrn is @xmath157 ergs s@xmath17 . with the same assumption , we estimated the required luminosity for m0.51@xmath10.10 to be @xmath158 ergs s@xmath17 .",
    "thus , it is consistent with the required luminosity for sgr  b2 .",
    "therefore , the xrn scenario by the past activity of sgr a * , which was successfully applied to sgr b2 , may also be applied to m0.51@xmath10.10 .",
    "taking into account that sgr  b1 and sgr  b2 have the same three - dimensional distance from sgr  a * , we presume that both of the two xrne originated in the identical past activity of sgr  a * about 300 years ago .",
    "with suzaku , we observed of the sgr  b1 region with an exposure time of about 100 ksec in march 2006 .",
    "thanks to the excellent energy resolution of the xis aboard suzaku , the large effective area and a long exposure , we successfully revealed the distribution of the gcdx , and discovered a new diffuse faint source , `` g0.42@xmath10.04 '' , and obtained an excellent spectrum from the 6.4  kev cloud , `` m0.51@xmath10.10 '' .    *",
    "the line - flux ratio [ fe]/[fe ] of the sgr  b1 and b2 regions ( @xmath159 ) is consistent with that of the region at @xmath160 .",
    "the fe line flux exponentially decreases from the gc center to the sgr  b1 and b2 regions .",
    "this result suggests that the gcdx extends at least up to the sgr  b1 and b2 regions with a constant temperature of @xmath161 kev .",
    "* the large absorption column of @xmath162 @xmath15 toward g0.42@xmath10.04 suggests that the source is located in the gc region .",
    "the spectra of g0.42@xmath10.04 are well fitted with a thin thermal - plasma model of @xmath104 kev . in consideration of the large absorption column toward the gc region ,",
    "the observational results are consistent with the idea that g0.42@xmath10.04 might be a part of an snr . on the other hand ,",
    "g0.42@xmath10.04 is unlikely to be a stellar cluster , since no infrared stellar cluster has been reported at the position of g0.42@xmath10.04 .",
    "* m0.51@xmath10.10 is identified with the 6.4  kev cloud `` sgr  b1 '' detected by @xcite .",
    "the x - ray spectra of m0.51@xmath10.10 exhibit a absorption column of @xmath163 @xmath15 and a large equivalent width of @xmath71 kev for the fe k@xmath2 fluorescence emission line .",
    "this suggests that the 6.4  kev x - ray emission is unlikely to be due to the collision of low - energy cosmic - ray electrons , but due to the reflection of external hard x - rays , and hence m0.51@xmath10.10 is thought to be an x - ray reflection nebula .",
    "the bright x - ray point source 1e  1743.1@xmath12843 , or the collection of fainter point sources near m0.51@xmath10.10 does not explain the luminosity of @xmath164ergs s@xmath17 required for the 6.4 kev x - rays from m0.51@xmath10.10 .",
    "the xrn scenario based on the past activity of sgr  a * , which was successfully applied to sgr b2 , may also be applied to m0.51@xmath10.10 .",
