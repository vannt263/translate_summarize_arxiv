    "recently , the quantum compass model was introduced to describe some mott insulators with orbit degeneracy by a pseudospin@xcite , where the coupling along one of bonds is an ising type , but different spin components are active along other bond directions .",
    "the disorder effect in this model was also examined@xcite .",
    "the protected qubit is formed if it is separated from the low - energy excitations by a pseudo - spin excited gap .",
    "so a high quality factor , scalable and error - free scheme of quantum computation can be designed@xcite .",
    "the symmetry of pseudo - spin hamiltonians is usually much lower than su(2)@xcite , and the result of numerical calculation has been shown that its eigenstates are at least twofold degenerate or highly degenerate and disordered@xcite .",

    "in addition , the 1d quantum compass model is exactly the same as the 1d reduced kitaev model@xcite .",
    "the analytic eigenspectra in the latter model have been obtained , and it was shown that this model has one gapless phase .",
    "but the characters of the quantum phase transition have never been well studied previously .",
    "the realistic models of the orbital degeneracy are more complicated .    for the compass model",
    ", the pseudo - spins may lead to enhanced quantum fluctuations near the quantum phase transitions ( qpts ) and to entangled spin - orbital ground states .",
    "the numerical results have indicated that a first - order qpt occurs at @xmath1 between two different states with spin ordering along either x or z directions@xcite .",

    "it is necessary to know the exact gs wave function .",
    "the derivatives of the gs energy are intrinsically related to the gs fidelity@xcite , both can be used to identify the qpts .",
    "for the special case of two spin @xmath2 system , the entanglement is given by the concurrence .",
    "quantum entanglement is one of the most striking consequences of quantum correlation in many - body systems , shows a deep relation with the qpt@xcite . therefore understanding the entanglement is very important in qpts@xcite . in the context of qpts ,",
    "the quantum entanglement have been the subject of considerable interests in the dicke model @xcite and the xy model @xcite .",

    "a gap is found in the curve of nnc versus @xmath92 at the qpt point @xmath98 in our calculation of the pseudo - spin concurrence .",
    "if the pseudo - spin chain goes to infinite , the gap has the critical behavior with @xmath99 , as shown in the inset of fig.4 . obviously , it is the finite - size effect .",
    "the question then arises : what is the origin of the concurrence gap ?",
    "the answer is the symmetry of system which has been assumed by the ferromagnetic even - pseudo - spin chains with periodic boundary condition in this paper .",
    "the qpt in the 1d compass model is of first - order@xcite , the scaling behaviors at the critical point should be absent .",
    "but the discontinuousness of the concurrence at the qtp may exhibit the finite - size scaling behavior @xmath100@xcite , consistent with the present observation . due to the concurrence gap ,",
    "the value of @xmath93 becomes minimum at the critical point .",
    "however , the maximum value of the concurrence occurs below @xmath98 is not related to the critical point .",
    "the present results for the concurrence are similar to those in the periodic quantum ising chain model@xcite .",

    "the curves of spin correlations versus @xmath92 are asymmetric .",

    "this correlator is positive for all @xmath112 , indicating that there is the long - range ferromagnetic order .",
    "it is interesting to find that the oscillation occurs for @xmath113 , i.e. for period - two chain , which can be attributed to the different coupling coefficients of odd and even bonds .",
    "however , the similar trend appears in both cases , as shown in fig .",
    "by using the pseudo - spin transformation method and the trace map method , we obtain the exact solution of one - dimensional compass model with periodic boundary condition .",
    "the parameter @xmath69 determines the symmetries of finite pseudo - spin excitation gap @xmath67 , but the phase transition point is still fixed at @xmath94 . the quantum critical point separates the disorder phase .",
    "the pseudo - spin liquid disordered ground state is the universal features in the 1d compass model .",
