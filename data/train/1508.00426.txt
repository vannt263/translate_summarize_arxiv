    "@xcite becomes large , collisions become scarce , the distribution function can not be considered as maxwellian anymore and , gradually , the trajectories of particles are essentially determined by the gravitation and radiation pressure by the sun .",
    "the trajectories of particles , subject to the gravitational force , are completely solved with the equations of motion , but it is not the case with the radiation pressure @xcite .",
    "the radiation pressure disturbs the conics ( ellipses or hyperbolas ) described by the particles under the influence of gravity .",
    "the resonant scattering of solar photons leads to a total momentum transfer from the photon to the atom or molecule @xcite . in the non - relativistic case , assuming an isotropic reemission of the solar photon , this one is absorbed in the sun direction and scattered with the same probability in all directions .",
    "for a sufficient flux of photons in the absorption wavelength range , the reemission in average does not induce any momentum transfer from the atom / molecule to the photon .",
    "the momentum variation , each second , between before and after the scattering imparts a force , the radiation pressure .",
    "@xcite analyzed its effect on the structure of planetary exospheres .",
    "nevertheless , their work was limited only to the sun - planet axis , with a null component assumed for the angular momentum around the sun - planet axis .",
    "we thus generalize here their work to a full 3d calculation , in order to investigate the influence of the radiation pressure on the trajectories @xcite , as well as the density profiles @xcite and escape flux ( future work ) .    in this paper , we propose to investigate the influence of the radiation pressure on the stability of planetary exospheres , based on dynamical effects of the radiation pressure .",
    "in particular , we study the validity of our approach ( see . @xcite(@xcite ,",
    "@xcite ) for the specific case of hot jupiters , which needs to consider the circular restricted three body problem ( cr3bp ) combined with the radiation pressure i.e. the photogravitational three body problem . we will also derive a new expression of the hill s sphere radius ( the limit of the gravitationnal influence of the central body ) that includes the effect of the radiation pressure , before we discuss the impact of the radiation pressure force on the stability of the hot jupiters atmospheres ( with a case study on hd 209458b ) .",
    "these may be indeed be bounded or not to the planet depending on the radiation pressure intensity .    in the section [ formalism ] ,",
    "we develop our approach to study the photogravitational cr3bp . then , in the section [ results ] , we will present the topology of equipotentials , derive a new expression of the hill s sphere and then discuss the possible consequence for the planetary atmosphere stability and the escaping flux .",
    "finally , the conclusions will be reported in the section [ conclusions ] .",
    "we investigate here the combined effects of the external forces on planetary neutral exospheres : the planetary gravity , the stellar gravity , the centrifugal force and the radiation pressure .",
    "as we know , the radiation pressure is directly proportional to the flux of photons . neglecting relativistic effects such as the doppler shift or the poynting - robertson effect",
    ", the radiation pressure then depends only on the square of the distance from the star as the stellar gravity .",
    "we define the @xmath0 parameter as the ratio between the acceleration induced by the radiation pressure and by the stellar gravity , this parameter being a constant in the planetary system .",
    "indeed , the radiation pressure effect without relativistic effects depends only on the flux and thus the square of the stellar distance as the stellar gravity .",
    "each neutral is then subject to the dimensionless effective potential @xmath1 in the rotating coordinate system defined as :    @xmath2    and @xmath3 with @xmath4 , @xmath5 the mass of the planet , @xmath6 the mass of the star , @xmath7 the position of the star and @xmath8 the one of the planet .",
    "the axis are oriented such as the @xmath9-axis is the star - planet axis , the @xmath10-axis is perpendicular to the planetary motion and the @xmath11-axis so that the @xmath12 frame is a direct orthonormal basis .",
    "the notations are similar to the ones used in @xcite .",
    "the first term of @xmath13 describes the potential energy associated to the centrifugal force , the second one corresponds to the stellar gravity and the radiation pressure effect @xmath0 and the last one the planetary gravity .",
    "this problem was previously studied concerning the positions and the stability of equilibrium points by @xcite ( @xcite,@xcite ) and @xcite .",
    "@xcite determined the position of the lagrange points @xmath14 , @xmath15 , then investigated the equipotentials and the @xmath0 values for which the roche lobe of the planet is connected to the stellar one through @xmath16 as a function of @xmath17 and @xmath0 . for very small @xmath0 values , both are not connected at all ( cf .",
    "@xcite , figure 4 ) . on another hand , @xcite investigated the general case of a binary star system , where each star has its own radiation pressure .",
    "they gave a complete review about the lagrange points @xmath16 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 with the numerical derivation of their positions and their stability , whereas @xmath14 and @xmath15 were mostly studied by @xcite .",
    "the link between the stability of a planetary atmosphere and the cr3bp was tackled by @xcite about the strong escape rate observed on hd 209458b and widely covered in the literature ( @xcite,@xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "they modelled with different densities and temperatures estimations the upper atmosphere of hd 209458b . for high thermospheric temperatures ,",
    "the thermosphere could extend so far that the exobase could reach the roche lobe limit , located at only @xmath20 planetary radii .",
    "thus , in this case the requisite kinetic energy to escape from the exobase ( or critical radius @xmath21 ) is smaller than the common gravitational potential @xmath22 .",
    "several papers dedicated to hd 209458b investigated this issue , focusing on the mass loss rate and the conversion of the euv flux into kinetic energy for hydrogen so that it can escape .",
    "however , most of the previous studies did not take into account the additional effect of the radiation pressure ( i.e. @xmath23 ) which acts as a repulsive force from the star .    in this paper",
    ", we will discuss on the positions of the equilibrium points compared with the size of the extended planetary atmospheres and show how the radiation pressure will influence the stability of the atmospheres of hot jupiters , with using hd 209458b as a case study .",
    "in this section [ results ] , we present our results on the topology ( [ topology ] ) and on the decreasing size of the roche lobe due to the radiation pressure . we derive an analytical formula to approximate the hill s sphere size depending on the radiation pressure intensity ( [ hill1 ] ) .",
    "we will then discuss the implications of the modified hill s sphere on the planetary atmosphere stability ( [ stability ] ) .",
    "this modification will significantly affect the giant planets close to their host star such as the hot jupiters .",
    "this section will provide quantitative results for specific situations including the case of hd 209458b ( and for hydrogen atoms ) , but both the approach and the results can be essentially applied to any planetary atmosphere .      in this first part , we study the topology of equipotentials ( or zvc curves ) modified by the radiation pressure with the example of hd 209458b .     for @xmath23 ( pure cr3bp , upper panels ) , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 for hd 209458b .",

    "we propose here to investigate the influence of the radiation pressure on the roche lobe radius .",

    "is also quite interesting : according to @xcite , the @xmath0 value for hd 209458b should be @xmath77 , neglecting relativistic effects , and thus the hill s sphere radius should be below the surface according to our study .",
    "we can also investigate the conditions encountered by the early solar system .",
    "the lyman-@xmath78 intensity was 20 times higher for the one million year old sun than at present @xcite , leading to an estimated @xmath0 for hydrogen of about 40 .",
    "if we assume the planets were in the same place as today , the sphere of influence should be much closer to the planetary surface , at only a few planetary radii",
    ".    the consequences on the atmospheric stability and escape flux , in particular for the case study hd 209458b , will be more detailed in the next sections [ stability ] and [ casestudy ] .",
    "regarding the example of the hot jupiter hd 209458b , @xcite proposed that the exobase of the planet is shaped by the roche lobe proximity , since the @xmath16 lagrange point is expected to be close to the planet due to the close host star .",
    "this then induces a geometrical blow - off : the exospheric particles need much less kinetic / thermal energy to escape by reaching the close roche lobe .",
    "based on our analysis , we agree in this case with the geometrical blow - off of hd 209458b proposed by @xcite but for a different reason : as can be seen in figure [ figure ] , the radiation pressure pushes the position of the roche lobe ( i.e. @xmath16 ) much closer to the star and thus much further from the planet , but the @xmath18 point is pushed closer to the planet below the expected exobase location ( and even below the  surface \" ) , so that , no kinetic / thermal energy is needed for exospheric particles to escape even for a low exospheric temperature .",
    "( blue ) , @xmath27 ( green ) and @xmath79 ( red ) .",
    "the corresponding hill s sphere is the circle in dotted line .",
    "the filled centered circle corresponds to the solid part of the planet and the surrounding circle to the exobase as proposed by @xcite.[figure ] ]    as mentioned above the early solar system planetary atmospheres encountered a lyman-@xmath78 flux about 20 times higher than today @xcite and leading to a @xmath0 value of @xmath80 instead of @xmath81 .",
    "consequently , assuming the distance of venus , earth and mars were the same as today , the sphere of influence for hydrogen should be of the order of @xmath79 and @xmath82 planetary radii .",
    "the radiation pressure thus strongly limited the possible extension of the atmosphere : above this limit , the hydrogen ( and species with similar @xmath0 ) could not be bounded to the planet by the gravity and easily escaped to the interplanetary medium .",
    "this radiation pressure effect is a new constraint for understanding the planetary atmospheres evolution in the solar or exoplanetary systems as well as for their modelling : the size of the simulation box should thus be at least larger than the hill s sphere radius of each species to appropriately take into account the radiation pressure effect .    in the aim to have a complete picture of the atmospheric evolution of planets , which includes the influence of the radiation pressure , one should not only take into account the evolution of the stellar euv - xuv fluxes that drive the heating / expansion of the atmospheres , but also the part of the flux spectrum that drives the radiation pressure . depending on the flux spectrum of the host star",
    ", the species inside the atmosphere will be more or less affected by the radiation pressure based on their specific @xmath0 value .",
    "for example , if we refer to @xcite for the solar system conditions , the @xmath0 parameter of helium can be between @xmath62 or very small values ( e.g. @xmath83 for he ii ) and @xmath84 depending on the wavelength .",
    "if several species are not equally sensitive to the stellar radiation pressure , this could then affect the dynamic of each species above the exobase and yield to a differential drag of the species in the upper atmosphere , or to a protection of ( radiation pressure ) sensitive species such as hydrogen by less sensitive ones through collisions .",
    "this last process could help understanding how hydrogen rich atmospheres can remain stable for long periods despite a blow - off type escape regime expected .",
    "these questions will be investigated in a future work .",
    "moreover , it can be reasonably assumed that the radiation pressure will have a different effect on planetary atmospheres according to the knudsen number _ kn _ :    * for low _ kn _ ( collisional regime ) , i.e. the scale height is greater than the mean free path , the radiation pressure will increase the mechanical energy of each hydrogen atom on short distances similar to the mean free path .",
    "then , through collisions , this increase will be redistributed quickly to other species and transformed into heat .",
    "the escaping flux will be a function of the incoming uv flux and its heating efficiency , * for high _ kn _ ( non collisional regime ) , i.e. the mean free path is higher than the scale height , the radiation pressure will affect only the dynamics of each individual species on time scale shorter than @xmath85 , @xmath86 the collisional frequency .",
    "the escaping flux will be function of the radiation pressure and the local thermal speed .      as detailed above ( and seen in table [ summary ] ) , the hot jupiter hd 209458b has its hill s sphere radius ( or exopause ) below the exobase and even below the surface due to the strong radiation pressure of the host star . since the exopause is below the exobase , all particles at the exobase thus escape ( see @xcite ) .",
    "this means the escape velocity is  virtually \" reduced to @xmath62 and thus the jeans parameter @xmath87 ( @xmath88 and @xmath89 being the escape and thermal speed ) tends to @xmath62 .",
    "the critical jeans parameter for the hydrodynamical blow - off regime proposed by @xcite is @xmath90 , but with the additional effect of the radiation pressure , @xmath91 will reach even lower values . the thermal escape flux",
    "may then be given by the jeans escape formula applied to the whole exobase with @xmath92 , which leads for hydrogen at hd 209458b to the following mass loss rate : @xmath93 for a temperature @xmath94 of @xmath95 k , an exobase at a distance of @xmath96 planetary radii and a density at the exobase of the order of @xmath97 m@xmath98 ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "this loss rate is in agreement with the estimates by @xcite , i.e. above @xmath99 g.s@xmath100 , and of the same order as recent models which predict a range of loss rates between @xmath101 and @xmath102 g.s@xmath100 ( @xcite ) . however ,",
    "the exobase temperature is poorly known and could be much lower than the one used by @xcite to match their model with the spectroscopic observations . then , we have performed as well the same calculation with the effective temperature of hd 209458b which is @xmath103 k ( @xcite,@xcite ) . assuming the same order of magnitude for the density at the exobase than previously assumed , we obtain @xmath104 , to be compared with the jeans escape , which is here of about @xmath105 .",
    "we thus obtain similar escape rates to previous models , but with a different process , i.e. with a geometrical  blow - off \" due to the radiation pressure influence and not due to the roche lobe proximity .",
    "furthermore , for hot jupiters , the thermal escape or jeans escape is in the literature neglected but our study shows that the radiation pressure acceleration modifies the gravitational potential in such a way that the exospheric particles are not bounded any more and/or the jeans parameter tends to @xmath62 .",
    "thus , the thermal escape is strongly enhanced by the stellar radiation pressure .",
    "finally , our study shows that extreme temperatures , compared with @xmath106 , are not required to be in agreement with the expected mass loss rates for hd 209458b .",
    "in this paper , we show the effect of the radiation pressure on the circular restricted three body problem ( cr3bp ) .",
    "this problem was previously tackled for celestial mechanics purposes but rarely in the context of planetary science .",
    "we first discuss the influence of the radiation pressure on the positions of the lagrange points , before we derive for the first time an analytical formula to approximate the hill s sphere radius with the additional effect of the radiation pressure .",
    "we highlight the strong interest of this derivation for the case studies of exoplanets and in particular hot jupiters .",
    "most of the papers dealing with the hill s sphere ( or roche lobe ) and the stability of hot jupiters atmospheres do not take account the effect of the radiation pressure on the cr3bp .",
    "we show in extreme cases such as for hot jupiters like hd 209458b that the hill s sphere radius could be drastically reduced and even be located below the surface .",
    "the components of the upper atmosphere , which are sensitive to the radiation pressure , are thus not  bounded \" to the planet any more and then escape to the interplanetary medium .",
    "the resulting increased escape calculated for hd 209458b is in agreement with the observations .",
    "moreover , we show that this hot jupiter is in a  blow - off \" type escape regime due to the radiation pressure of the host star , in contradiction with previous works that considered a blow - off regime due to the proximity of the roche lobe ( the roche lobe being actually pushed toward the star by the radiation pressure ) .",
    "thus , the radiation pressure can modify the planetary escape flux and strongly affect the atmospheric evolution of hot jupiters atmospheres from their early age , depending on the evolution of the host star as well .    in a future work",
    ", we will investigate how the intense radiation pressure of the young sun may have influenced the atmospheric escape and evolution of the inner solar system planets , whose hill s sphere radius was significantly reduced .",
