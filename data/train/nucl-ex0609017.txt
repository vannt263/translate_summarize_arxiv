    "two - particle jet - like azimuthal correlations have revealed significant modification in central heavy - ion collisions at rhic  @xcite .",
    "the away - side particles associated with and opposite to a high transverse momentum ( @xmath0 ) trigger particle are found to be broadly distributed about @xmath1 in azimuth from the trigger particle , in contrast to observations from @xmath2 and @xmath3+au collisions .",
    "the shape of the broad away - side distribution varies with the associated particle @xmath0 . for @xmath4  gev/@xmath5 ,",
    "for instance , the away - side distribution may even be double - humped with a dip at @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "the away - side associated particles are also found to be not much harder than the bulk medium particles  @xcite .",
    "the particles at @xmath1 are found to be softer than those in the angular regions where the humps appear  @xcite , again in contrast to observations in @xmath2 and @xmath3+au collisions or jet fragmentation in vacuum .",
    "several physical scenarios are possible to explain the observations .",
    "one is that jets may be deflected by radial transverse flow of the bulk medium or by the larger survival probability of jet particles moving outwards than inwards due to energy loss  @xcite .",
    "such a scenario would have jet particles narrowly clustered in individual events but the cluster is randomly distributed about @xmath1 over many events .",
    "the second is large angle gluon radiation  @xcite .",
    "this scenario would have qualitatively similar structure as for deflected jets .",
    "the third is conical flow from sound shock - waves generated by large energy deposition of high momentum partons and its strong pressure disturbance in the medium  @xcite .",
    "such shock - waves result in a distinctive mach - cone type structure where particles are preferentially emitted at a mach angle determined by the speed of sound in the medium , independent of the particle @xmath0 .",
    "if mach - cone type conical flow is indeed responsible for the observation , then the extraction of the speed of sound may be possible , thereby the equation of state of the created medium .",
    "the fourth is @xmath6erenkov gluon radiation generated by interactions of fast moving particles with the medium  @xcite .",
    "such a scenario would have a similar structure as for the mach - cone conical flow , but the @xmath6erenkov angle will likely depend on the associated particle @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "two - particle correlation can not distinguish these scenarios because they give qualitatively the same two - particle correlation .",
    "such ambiguity is lifted in three - particle correlation and its @xmath0 dependence .",
    "if the broad two - particle correlation is due to deflected jets or large angle gluon radiation , the two associated particles will be narrowly clustered in angle but the cluster will swing over a wide range in azimuth on the away side . if the mach - cone or @xmath6erenkov radiation is responsible for the broad two - particle correlation , then the two associated particles will have equal probability being opposite away from @xmath1 as being clustered together . a three - particle correlation signal with opposite azimuthal angles from @xmath1 for the two associated particles",
    "is , therefore , a distinctive signature of mach - cone conical flow or @xmath6erenkov radiation .",
    "the @xmath0 dependence of the cone angle may further discriminate between the two scenarios of mach - cone conical flow and @xmath6erenkov gluon radiation  @xcite .",
    "three - particle jet - like azimuthal correlations have been studied in star  @xcite .",
    "the results show evidence of conical emission .",
    "the emission angle is independent of associated particle @xmath0 and is consistent with mach - cone shock waves  @xcite , but not with simple @xmath6erenkov gluon radiation  @xcite .",
    "the analysis followed the jet - correlation method commonly used in two - particle azimuthal correlation studies at rhic  @xcite , but extended to three particles .",
    "hereon we will refer to this method as the _ jet - correlation method_. recently another analysis method , the three - particle cumulant method with azimuthal angle defined in the laboratory frame  @xcite , has been proposed .",
    "the method follows the mathematically well - defined cumulant concept .",
    "hereon we will refer to this method as the _ lab - frame cumulant method_. the two methods give different results and may confuse the general reader . in this paper",

    "we then compare the two methods and discuss their differences , using a simple analytical model for jets .",
    "finally we draw our conclusions .",
    "the objectives of the two analysis methods , the jet - correlation method and the cumulant method , are both to study jet structures . due to the large particle multiplicity in relativistic heavy - ion collisions ,",
    "event - by - event reconstruction of jets is impossible ; one often resorts to two- and three - particle azimuthal correlations of charged hadrons with high @xmath0 trigger particles that have a relatively large probability to originate from dijets .",
    "the obtained correlation functions , thus , yield information on dijets . in this section",
    ", we briefly describe the two analysis methods for three - particle azimuthal correlation studies .",
    "the three - particle jet - correlation method is described in  @xcite .",
    "the method is extended from the commonly used two - particle jet - correlation method to three particles .",
    "combinatorial backgrounds are obtained from event - mixing technique ; they include background from three `` random '' particles as well as background from a correlated trigger - associated particle pair with a `` random '' associated particle .",
    "the `` random '' particles we refer to here ( and hereafter without the quotes ) may include other correlations that are not related to the trigger particle , such as those due to anisotropic flow .",
    "the jet - like correlation method has the jet model in mind .",
    "the difficulty is that the underlying background is unknown a priori .",
    "one has to make ad hoc working assumptions about the background level .",
    "the common assumptions made in data analysis are zya1  @xcite and zyam  @xcite .",
    "the correlation measured at rhic is the lowest around @xmath7 .",
    "the star experiment makes the assumption that the jet signal is zero within the fixed range of @xmath8 ( zya1 )  @xcite , while the phenix experiment uses the so - called zero - yield - at - minimum ( zyam ) method in which the @xmath9 region where the signal minimum resides is determined by the data itself  @xcite .",

    "( [ eq6a ] ) and ( [ eq6b ] ) are the other background , the combinatorial background of a correlated trigger - associated pair with a random associated particle .",
    "it is given by the product of the two - particle jet - correlation signal @xmath16 with the underlying background @xmath17 .",
    "in data analysis  @xcite , the dihadron background @xmath12 is often obtained from the mixed - event technique , mixing a trigger particle from one event with an associated particle from another event , and then scaling the result by a normalization factor , @xmath18 , using the zya1 or zyam scheme .",
    "the @xmath15 background is obtained from the mixed - event technique using three different events , with a proper normalization scale , @xmath19 , where @xmath20 quantifies the difference in the degrees of deviation from poisson statistics in the background associated particle multiplicity and that from mixed - events  @xcite . in this paper , for simplicity we shall constrain ourselves to @xmath21 .",
    "the advantage of the jet - correlation method is that , once the assumption about the background is made and the level of background is determined , the resultant three - particle jet - like correlation signal is easy to interpret and can be used to discriminate different physics scenarios .",
    "the disadvantage is of course the difficulty of the analysis .",
    "the lab - frame three - particle cumulant method is described in detail in  @xcite .",
    "given a high @xmath0 trigger particle to preferentially select a dijet , the two - particle cumulant is defined as _",
    "2(,)=_2(,)-_1()_1(),[eq1]where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are azimuthal angles of the trigger and associated particles in the _ laboratory frame _ , respectively .",

    "@xmath24 is the azimuthal angle of the @xmath25th associated particle ( @xmath26 ) in the laboratory frame . in eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) , @xmath27 is the average single particle density , @xmath28 is the average two - particle density , and @xmath29 is the average three - particle density .",
    "cumulants are normally computed on a per event basis . since our goal here is to identify jet - correlation structure , we normalize the cumulants by the number of trigger particles . the two normalizations differ simply by a constant factor which is the average number of trigger particles per event .",
    "it is worth to note here that @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 are all event - wise average quantities .",
    "they depend on what event sample is used in the analysis .",
    "consider for example two event samples within a given centrality bin : minimum bias event sample and only events containing a trigger particle ( triggered events ) .",
    "the quantities related to a trigger particle , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 are all zero in the nontriggered events , and thus remain the same between the two event samples if normalized per trigger particle ( or differ by a constant if normalized per event ) . the other quantities , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 are generally different between triggered events and nontriggered events due to trigger bias .",
    "thus the cumulants analyzed using two different event samples differ , and this is beyond the simple normalization factor between per trigger and per event normalizations mentioned above . in other words , the cumulant analyzed using only the triggered events yields @xmath40(triggered events ) , the cumulant analyzed using only the nontriggered events would yield zero by definition , and the cumulant analyzed using both the triggered and nontriggered events together yields @xmath40(all events ) , and @xmath40(triggered events ) @xmath41 @xmath40(all events ) .",
    "moreover , @xmath40(all events ) depends on the relative numbers of nontriggered events ( for which @xmath42 ) and triggered events . in this paper",
    ", we shall constrain ourselves to using triggered events only .",
    "the per trigger normalized two - particle cumulant is _ 2()=_2()-_1(),[eq3]and the three - particle cumulant is _",
    "3(_1,_2)&=&_3(_1,_2)-_2(_1,_2 ) + & & -_2(_1)_1(_2)-_2(_2)_1(_1 ) + & & + 2_1(_1)_1(_2),[eq4a ] or alternatively _ 3(_1,_2)=&_3(_1,_2)-_2(_1,_2 ) + & -_2(_1)_1(_2)-_2(_2)_1(_1).[eq4b ] in eqs .

    "in addition , @xmath46 is the two - particle density but expressed in the azimuth differences of the particles from a random trigger particle .",
    "because the azimuthal angles are defined in the laboratory frame , the single particle density @xmath47 is constant and we shall just use @xmath30 : _ 1()=_1()=_1=const .",
    "the reason that @xmath48 is also constant is because the product @xmath49 is taken after the @xmath30 s have been already averaged over the event sample .",
    "cumulants are well defined mathematically .",
    "the data analysis of cumulants is straightforward .",
    "one calculates the cumulants for each event and accumulates them over a event sample ; the cumulants can be binned in fixed - multiplicity bins .",
    "the shortcoming , as we will see , is the difficulty in the interpretation of the obtained results : the cumulants are mathematically well defined and thus do not depend on the underlying physics of the events ; their interpretations , therefore , have to depend on the model for the underlying physics .",
    "reaction plane direction in nucleus - nucleus collisions is random .",
    "the natural azimuthal angle to use is that defined relative to reaction plane , @xmath50 .",

    "rather are functions of @xmath50 and @xmath9 , respectively .",
    "the lab - frame cumulant and the reaction - plane - frame cumulant are clearly different .",
    "this is because the cumulant is a mathematical construction , and an event sample expressed in lab - frame azimuthal angle and the same event sample expressed in azimuthal angle relative to reaction plane are different mathematical identities .",
    "however , the event sample contains obviously the same physics , whether expressed in the laboratory frame or in the reaction plane frame . in other words , the same physics yields two different cumulant results .",

    "5 .   with both anisotropic flow and jet correlation present",
