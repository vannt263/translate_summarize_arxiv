    "the transmission capacity , which determines to the coupling strength , is decided based on the physical conditions such as the air temperature , the length of transmission line , and the amount of transmitting electricity .",
    "when the amount of electricity transmitted exceeds the transmission capacity , it may cause the breakdown of a large part of the system .",
    "therefore , it is important to understand the functional dependence of basin stability on the coupling strength , not only its behavior at a fixed and intermediate coupling strength .",
    "we use the real electric power grid in chile as our prime example , but also discuss how the results generalize . to be more specific , we investigate the network - structural factors  @xcite behind a node s basin stability as a function of the coupling strength . based on the chilean case study , we argue that there is a connection between the coupling strength dependence and community structure  the way the network can be decomposed into communities that are densely connected within and sparsely connected between each other  @xcite .",

    "we find this phenomenon for the small example network too ( not shown ) .",

    "as previous works focus on the stability for specific coupling strength values , our approach complements these .",
    "while a narrow transition window implies a sudden change in the stability , a wide transition window can provide an early signal of danger when the coupling strength is gradually weakened . by comparing the mesoscopic network property of community consistency with the transition window , we found that the former is a good predictor of the latter ( or vice versa ) , signifying the importance of community structures on the synchronization dynamics again .    on a practical side ,",
    "such community - consistency based predictions provide a proxy of the actual time - consuming simulations of calculating basin stability , especially for very large systems .",

    "<S> the synchrony of electric power systems is important in order to maintain stable electricity supply . </S>",
    "<S> recently , the measure _ basin stability _ was introduced to quantify a node s ability to recover its synchronization when perturbed . in this work , </S>",
    "<S> we focus on how basin stability depends on the coupling strength between nodes . </S>",
    "<S> we use the chilean power grid as a case study . in general </S>",
    "<S> , basin stability goes from zero to one as coupling strength increases . </S>",
    "<S> however , this transition does not happen at the same value for different nodes . by understanding the transition for individual nodes </S>",
    "<S> , we can further characterize their role in the power - transmission dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> we find that nodes with an exceptionally large transition window also have a low community consistency . </S>",
    "<S> in other words , they are hard to classify to one community when applying a community detection algorithm . </S>",
    "<S> this also gives an efficient way to identify nodes with a long transition window ( which is computationally time consuming ) . </S>",
    "<S> finally , to corroborate these results , we present a stylized example network with prescribed community structures that captures the mentioned characteristics of basin stability transition and recreates our observations . </S>"
