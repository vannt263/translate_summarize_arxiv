    "<S> the algebraic tails of the pdf of the return times with @xmath89 imply that the dynamics in phase space is with high probability getting trapped in some parts of phase space for long times , whose average is finite , but whose variance diverges . </S>",
    "<S> we conjecture that these trapping events are due to the trajectory visiting regions of the phase space which are substantially close to some regular ( time - periodic or even quasiperiodic ) orbits . in order to verify this conjecture , we compute the averages of the mode energies over a given return event : @xmath90 in fig.[fig3 ] we plot the event - averaged mode energies for two trapping events .    </S>",
    "<S> we clearly observe a highly inhomogeneous distribution , with high - frequency ( large @xmath91 ) modes being strongly excited on a background of many weakly excited modes .    to further substantiate our observation </S>",

    "<S> ( left plot ) , we observe that large return times @xmath94 imply large values of @xmath95 , signalling a tendency towards high frequency excitations . </S>",
    "<S> this is further supported by the corresponding computation of the participation number @xmath26 of the event - averaged mode energy distributions in fig.[fig5 ] ( right plot ) which show that large return times imply smaller values of @xmath26 , a typical case of a strongly inhomogeneous distributions . </S>",

    "<S> the first moments of @xmath98 ( the averages of the return times ) become comparable to the variance , indicating the absence of any long - time specific events of sticking . for smaller energy densities , the exponent @xmath89 , signaling a divergence of the variance of @xmath99 . </S>",
    "<S> this appears to be a fingerprint of highly probable sticky events - the trajectory can get frequently trapped by regular structures in phase space for substantial times . as follows from the inset in fig.[fig4 ] </S>",
    "<S> , the exponent appears to saturate at a value 2.2 for the smallest probed energy densities . </S>",
    "<S> it remains to be understood , whether that saturation holds for even smaller energy densities .    </S>",
    "<S> algebraic tails in correlation functions or distributions of trapping times have been previously studied for low - dimensional dynamical systems with a mixed phase space @xcite , and related to the hierarchic fractal structure of the phase space at regular island boundaries . </S>",
    "<S> however higher phase space dimensions destroy the simple mixed phase space picture , preventing the use of this simple argument for the observation of algebraic tails @xcite . in the present work we derive a well - defined sectioning at equilibrium , and a clear interpretation of the presence of algebraic tails in terms of temporal excitation of coherent states , like time - periodic q - breathers .    </S>",
    "<S> we arrived at a general method to analyze the relaxation from non - equilibrium states and the equilibrium fluctuations of interacting many - body systems . </S>",
    "<S> the essence is to identify the relevant coherent excitations which will be the cause of stickiness , and to choose a proper observable @xmath0 which can detect these events . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding equilibrium value @xmath100 defines the co - dimension 1 equilibrium manifolds , and the subsequent statistical analysis of the equilibrium fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> when algebraic tails are observed in contrast to exponential cutoffs , the divergence of suitably high moments of the distribution indicates sticky dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> when the exponent @xmath89 , the non - equilibrium excursions into sticky events start to dominate the dynamics . finally when @xmath86 the first moment diverges indicating the loss of ergodicity altogether . </S>",
    "<S> we expect therefore that our method can be used for a broad set of other cases where nonergodic fluctuations affect the dynamics of many - body systems , such as ultracold atomic gases in optical potentials approximated by the discrete gross - pitaevsky equation , or networks of weakly interacting superconducting grains , among others .    </S>",
