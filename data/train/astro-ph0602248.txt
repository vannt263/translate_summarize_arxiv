    "the formation of early - type galaxies is one of the ongoing riddles of modern extragalactic astrophysics . according to the leading models ,",
    "massive early - type galaxies have been assembled hierarchically , from the merging of less massive structures . because such mergers are seen locally to be accompanied by star formation ( e.g. , schweizer & seitzer 1992 ) , one of the best ways to test the hierarchical formation paradigm is by determining the star formation history of early - type galaxies .",
    "this can be achieved by estimating the ages of stars in galaxies from their integrated light , through comparison with stellar population synthesis models .",
    "several groups have attempted to achieve this goal from observations of massive galaxies in a range of redshifts ( e.g. , le borgne 2006 , treu 2005 , daddi 2005 , longhetti 2005 , and references therein ) .",
    "however , spectroscopic dating of stellar populations older than @xmath5 1 gyr is best achieved by simultaneously matching the strengths of balmer and metal lines in their integrated spectra , in order to avoid spurious effects due to the age - metallicity degeneracy .",
    "so far , observational difficulties have prevented such detailed studies for all but local samples ( e.g. , gonzlez 1993 , trager 2000 , kuntschner 2000 , caldwell 2003 , eisenstein 2003 , thomas 2005 , schiavon 2006 , and references therein ) .    in this _",
    "we present the analysis of absorption line strengths measured in stacked integrated keck / deimos spectra of red galaxies with redshifts between 0.7 and 1 , as part of the deep2 survey ( davis 2003 ) .",
    "we find that the stars in these galaxies have mean light - weighted single stellar population ( ssp ) ages of order only 1 gyr , and their metallicities are at least solar .",
    "since these objects are observed several billion years after the big bang , this result suggests that stars inhabiting red galaxies were formed during an extended period of time .",
    "the data used in this _ letter _",
    "consist of k - corrected absolute magnitudes in the vega system and 1-hour exposure keck / deimos ( faber 2003 ) spectra from deep2 ( davis 2003 ) .",
    "redshift determinations are described in davis ( 2003 ) , and restframe @xmath6 magnitudes and u ",
    "b colors were derived from cfht _ bri _ photometry and redshifts by willmer ( 2006 ) . the s / n of each 1-hour exposure spectrum is not high enough for accurate measurement of absorption line indices , so we stack spectra of hundreds of galaxies , selected in bins of color , luminosity , and redshift .",
    "further details can be found in schiavon ( in preparation ) .",
    "our goal is to study the evolution of red - sequence early - types , so we first select galaxies by color .",
    "this selection criterion is illustrated in the left panel of figure  [ fig1 ] , where data for 17,745 deep2 galaxies with @xmath7 were used to produce a contour plot on the restframe color - magnitude space .",
    "red - sequence galaxies ( rsgs ) are chosen to be those with u ",
    "b @xmath8 0.25 , making up a total of 1941 objects .",
    "ideally , we would also like to select galaxies on the basis of morphology , but we unfortunately lack that information for the sample under analysis . therefore , in order to minimize contamination by strongly reddened late - type galaxies we impose another cut , based on the equivalent width ( ew ) of [ oii ] 3727 ( see definition by fisher 1998 ) .",
    "this is illustrated in the right panel of figure  [ fig1 ] , where a histogram of [ oii ] ews is shown for all rsgs in our sample .",
    "strong emission - line rsgs have very negative values of ew[oii ] while the zero of [ oii ] emission is at @xmath5 3.7 @xmath9 ( konidaris in preparation ) .",
    "the distribution is strongly peaked at very low [ oii ] emission values with a long tail towards galaxies with strong [ oii ] emission .",
    "contamination by reddened late - type galaxies is likely to be more important in the strong - emission line regime , so that we remove from our sample all galaxies with [ oii ] ew @xmath10 5 @xmath9 .",
    "this emission - line cut admittedly leaves in our sample a large number of galaxies in the low - emission line regime .",
    "these are mostly agn on the basis of the ratios between [ oii ] and residual balmer line emission ( schiavon in preparation , konidaris in preparation ) , as has been also found for low redshift rsgs ( phillips 1986 , rampazzo 2005 , and yan 2006 ) .",
    "the color and emission - line cuts leave us with a sample of 1160 galaxies .",
    "we create six subsamples out of this set of galaxies , three with varying colors but the same redshift range , and three with varying redshifts , but consistent colors and luminosities",
    ". the color and redshift limits of each bin are listed in table  [ tbl1 ] . in an attempt to compare objects with similar masses , galaxies in the color and redshift sub - samples",
    "were further selected within 1 mag - wide @xmath6 intervals where the central magnitude was chosen to be consistent with passive evolution from the age and metallicity of the high-@xmath2 sample . however , adopting the exact same @xmath6 interval for each @xmath2 bin does not change the results .",
    "the numbers of galaxies in each bin are listed in table  [ tbl1 ] .",

    "a rough relative fluxing was achieved by dividing each spectrum by the normalized throughput of the deimos spectrograph with the 1200 l / mm grating .",
    "before coaddition , the spectra were brought to restframe and then normalized through division by the average ( @xmath12-clipped ) counts within the @xmath13 39004100 @xmath9 interval .",
    "coaddition was performed adopting a @xmath12-clipping procedure to eliminate sky - subtraction residuals , zero - count pixels due to ccd gaps , and other spectral blemishes .",
    "after several tests the best results were obtained when a single 3-@xmath12 clipping iteration was adopted . on average more than 90% of all galaxies in a given bin contribute to the stacked spectrum at any given wavelength .",
    "no clipping was performed in the region of the [ oii ] @xmath14 3727 @xmath9 line . in figure",
    "[ fig2]a we compare one of our stacked spectra with a ssp model from schiavon ( 2006 ) . in order to match the overall flux distribution of the theoretical spectrum , the observed spectrum was dereddened by e(b  v)=0.2 .",
    "since the observations were not properly flux - calibrated , this e(b - v ) value does not reflect the average reddening in the sample galaxies and this correction has the sole purpose of bringing observations and theory to a common relative scale so as to highlight the outstanding agreement between line strengths in the observed and synthetic spectra .",
    "all lick indices in the @xmath13 40004500 @xmath9 region were measured in the stacked spectra , but we focus here on the @xmath15 and fe4383 indices , which are chiefly sensitive to age and [ fe / h ] , respectively .",
    "the spectra were first broadened to the lick resolution as given by worthey & ottaviani ( 1997 ) , and the indices were measured following definitions by those authors and by worthey ( 1994 ) .",
    "velocity dispersions ( @xmath12 ) were measured in the stacked spectra through fourier cross correlation using the iraf rv.fxcor routine .",
    "the template adopted was a model spectrum from schiavon ( 2006 ) for a ssp with solar metallicity and an age of 2 gyr .",
    "the same model spectrum was used to infer corrections to the line indices for the effect of @xmath12-broadening .",
    "the indices were all corrected to @xmath16 km / s using the @xmath12 determined for each stacked spectrum .",
    "the latter are listed in table  [ tbl1 ] .",
    "we do not attempt to convert the line indices to the lick system , aside from smoothing them to the lick / ids resolution .",
    "however , zero - point differences should be very small , given that the schiavon ( 2006 ) models are based on fluxed spectra and the deep2 spectra are corrected from instrumental throughput .",
    "finally , balmer lines were corrected for emission - line in - fill , which was estimated from ew[oii ] , adopting ew[oii]/ew(@xmath17 ) = 6 ( yan 2006 ) and ew(@xmath4 ) = 0.13 ew(@xmath17 ) .",
    "the correction to @xmath15 is smaller than 0.2 @xmath9 , corresponding to less than 1 gyr in age .",
    "galaxy evolution is better assessed when distant and local samples of similar objects are contrasted using evolutionary models .",
    "moreover , it is vital that the nearby and distant samples are defined as consistently as possible , to ensure that the two samples represent objects of the same class . for a local counterpart to the distant deep2 sample we use the sdss data from eisenstein ( 2003 ) , who provide stacked flux - calibrated spectra of rsgs , binned by absolute magnitude , environment , and redshift .",
    "because the deep2 stacked spectra include galaxies from all environments , we chose to use stacked spectra from a similarly defined sample from eisenstein ( their `` all '' sample ) .",
    "furthermore , in order to match the relative position of our absolute magnitude bins along the red sequence , we chose to exclude both the lowest and highest magnitude bins of the eisenstein sample from our analysis .",
    "the spectra were downloaded from d. eisenstein s website and submitted to the same treatment as described above for the deep2 spectra .",
    "key data for the eisenstein ( 2003 ) sample are listed in table  [ tbl1 ]",
    "lick indices measured in the stacked spectra are compared with ssp models in figure  [ fig2]b . shown",
    "are the indices measured in eisenstein ( 2003 ) spectra and those from the color - selected deep2 sub - samples .",
    "symbol size for the eisenstein galaxies is proportional to luminosity .",
    "the data are compared to models computed adopting [ @xmath18/fe ] = + 0.4 , [ c / fe]=+0.15 , and [ n / fe]=+0.3 ( see schiavon in preparation for details ) .",
    "the main result of this _ letter _ is immediately apparent in figure  [ fig2]b .",
    "the stellar populations of field rsgs at @xmath19 0.9 are young , with a mean luminosity - weighted age of only @xmath5 1.2 gyr .",
    "adoption of solar - scaled models would imply older ages by roughly 0.5 gyr .",
    "iron abundances range from [ fe / h ] @xmath5 0 to @xmath5 + 0.3 .",
    "as expected , the stellar populations in the local sdss galaxies are older than those at @xmath1 , with mean ages ranging between 3 and 6 gyr , with above solar [ fe / h ] .",
    "the time difference from the characteristic redshifts of deep2 to sdss samples is over 5 gyr , so the expected mean ages of sdss galaxies under passive evolution should be over 6 gyr .",
    "we note that the schiavon ( 2006 ) models match the same data for galactic globular clusters and  most importantly for this study  those for the open cluster m  67 ( 3.5 gyr , [ fe / h]=0 ) , to within 1 gyr in age and 0.1 dex in [ fe / h ]",
    ".    another interesting way of viewing this result is illustrated in figure  [ fig2]c , where deep2 and sdss galaxies are compared with passively evolving ssp models in a redshift vs.  @xmath15 plot .",
    "the deep2 data plotted in this case come from the redshift - selected sub - sample ( see table  [ tbl1 ] ) .",
    "the lines correspond to model predictions for ssp evolution assuming various redshifts of formation ( @xmath20 ) and adopting a concordance wmap cosmology ( spergel 2003 ) .",
    "dashed ( solid ) lines represent models with [ @xmath18/fe ] = 0.0 ( + 0.4 ) and super - solar [ fe / h ] .",
    "figure  [ fig2]c shows that the data for field rsgs require @xmath21 1.11.3 , when they are modeled using ssps with super - solar metallicity .",
    "moreover , the distant and local samples are not connected by lines of passive evolution , which indicates the occurrence of star formation between @xmath19 0.9 to @xmath5 0.1 ( see also gebhardt 2003 ) .",
    "this could be due either to _ in situ _ star formation or to the incorporation in the red sequence of new galaxies coming from the blue cloud after cessation of star formation .",
    "figure  [ fig2]c also makes clear that these results are valid regardless of the [ @xmath18/fe ] ratio of the models adopted",
    ". the results also remain qualitatively unchanged when models with lower metallicity are used .",
    "adoption of solar metallicity models ( not shown ) would result in slightly higher redshifts of star formation , @xmath21 1.31.5 .",
    "the results presented in this _ letter _",
    "need to be interpreted with caution .",
    "ages and metallicities inferred from comparison of integrated galaxy spectra with ssp models are luminosity - weighted averages , whereas the real stellar populations doubtless consist of stars with a range of ages .",
    "therefore , we are not claiming that the stars in the deep2 galaxies plotted in figure  [ fig2]b are uniformly @xmath5 1.2 gyr old .",
    "likewise , we are not proposing that the mean galaxies plotted in figure  [ fig2]c sprang into existence at @xmath22 .",
    "but the strength of @xmath4 in the stacked integrated spectra of field rsgs indicates that they harbour young and/or intermediate - age stars both locally and at @xmath23 .",
    "since the universe was roughly 6 gyr old at @xmath1 , this result can not be reconciled with models in which all the stars in these galaxies were formed at very high redshifts ( @xmath24 ) and evolved passively ever since .",
    "in fact , it appears that star formation in these galaxies was prolonged , and that it continued , in small amounts , between @xmath1 and 0.1 .",
    "the fact that we see no evolution in [ fe / h ] seems to indicate that the bulk of star formation has occurred before @xmath1 .",
    "the presence of young / intermediate - age stars in early - type galaxies can be accounted for by at least two scenarios .",
    "the so - called _ frosting _ models ( e.g. , trager 2000 ) propose small amounts of recent _ in situ _ star formation originated these stars . on the other hand ,",
    "_ quenching _ models ( e.g. , bell 2004 , faber 2005 ) suggest that blue galaxies migrate to the red sequence after cessation of star formation , possibly associated with a merger event and/or enhanced agn activity . in a separate study ( harker in preparation ) we make an exploration in that direction , by showing that quenching models provide a good match to the data analyzed in this _",
    "letter_. quenching models were also shown by faber ( 2005 ) to provide a good match to the evolution of the luminosity function of red galaxies from @xmath25 to the present day .",
    "an estimate of the fraction of the total stellar mass allocated in these young / intermediate - age stars ( e.g. , leonardi & rose 1996 ) might help discriminate between the different scenarios .",
    "a few important caveats must be kept in mind when considering these results . of most importance",
    ", our sample is not yet selected on the basis of morphology .",
    "although contamination by late - type , star - forming galaxies is low ( konidaris 2005 in preparation ) , a stronger statement on the history of star formation of early - type galaxies awaits an analysis of a morphologically selected sample of distant objects ( e.g. , treu 2005 ) .",
    "it is also important to keep in mind that we are dealing with a field sample .",
    "previous studies of cluster samples at comparable redshifts tell a different story , with cluster rsgs being compatible with high @xmath20 ( e.g. , kelson 2001 ) .",
    "lastly , the local sdss sample used here does not match perfectly the selection criteria adopted for our deep2 sample .",
    "work aimed at producing more adequate local counterparts to our distant deep2 sample is currently under way ( graves 2005 in preparation ) .",
