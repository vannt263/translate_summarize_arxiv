    "thus the length of the modified horizontal sides is not greater than @xmath503 .",
    "we see that the polygon obtained as the result of this last adjustment is the desired in the proposition [ polygon ] polynomial @xmath277 : every side now contains a point of @xmath389 , and the lengthes of the sides are no more than @xmath503 , thus @xmath328 .",
