    "according to the agn unification models  @xcite , all agn are intrinsically similar , and the observational differences among various types are due to the geometry and orientation with respect to the line of sight of obscuring matter surrounding the central super - massive black hole ( smbh ) . according to this model , obscuring matter is ubiquitous in agn , but the effects of absorption are only seen when the line of sight intercepts it .",
    "alternative models attribute the presence of obscuration to a stage in the early phases of agn evolution during a merger  @xcite .",
    "mergers of large disk galaxies hosting a smbh induce the growth of the smbh and of the host galaxy spheroid throughout vigorous star - formation episodes . during this phase the agn",
    "is surrounded by large amounts of gas and dust , thus it appears as heavily obscured .",
    "as the agn reaches a certain luminosity , its radiation can cause the expulsion and destruction of the surrounding material and the system appears as an unobscured agn  @xcite .    since agn that are not affected by obscuration are relatively easy to detect and identify across the entire wavelength spectrum , they have been well sampled up to high redshifts and their properties , space density , luminosity function and redshift distributions are well measured  @xcite . on the other hand , agn obscured by even only moderate column densities ( @xmath710@xmath8 2 )  @xcite ,",
    "are routinely missed in observations at various wavelengths because of the difficulty of detecting and identifying them , and , therefore , they are not as well understood .",
    "there is evidence that obscured agn are numerous and might even outnumber unobscured agn , however optically and x - ray selected samples of agn are still dominated by unobscured agn and large and complete samples of obscured agn are still missing providing only few observables to constrain models .      in the local universe and for moderate ( seyfert - like ) nuclear luminosities ( @xmath9 ) , the observed ratio between obscured ( @xmath410@xmath82 ) and unobscured ( @xmath1010@xmath82 ) agn is 4:1  @xcite and @xmath3 45% of the obscured ones are compton - thick ( column density larger than @xmath11 2 )  @xcite .",
    "large column densities ( @xmath122 ) have been directly measured only in a few , @xmath310 , sources ( e.g. ngc1068 , circinus , ngc4945 ) . for most of the known compton - thick agn ,",
    "@xmath340  @xcite , only indirect evidence to their extreme column densities is available  @xcite , such as the flatness of the hard x - ray continuum , a large equivalent width ( ew ) of the k@xmath136.4 kev iron fluorescent emission line , or lower than expected values of the ratio between the flux in the x - rays and in other wavelengths . at higher - redshift ( @xmath41 ) and luminosities ( @xmath14 ) ,",
    "the distribution of absorption in agn is not as well constrained with only a few examples of confirmed obscured quasars .",
    "there is evidence that the fraction of obscured agn decreases with higher intrinsic luminosities  @xcite , and possibly increases with redshift  @xcite .",
    "other indications for the existence of numerous obscured agn have been provided by agn studies at wavelengths less affected by obscuration , such as infrared ( ir ) and radio .",
    "@xcite compared the surface density of an ir - selected sample of agn ( @xmath15 ) with that of an optically - selected ( r - mag@xmath1021 )  @xcite sample of agn and found 2.8 times more agn in the ir than in the optical sample .",
    "since the ratio between the limiting fluxes of the two samples corresponds to the typical r - band/8  flux ratio of unobscured agn , the higher density of ir - selected agn is attributed to an excess of obscured agn .",
    "similar results were obtained from an ir and radio selected sample of agn  @xcite in which the fraction of obscured sources at high - redshift ( @xmath162 ) is estimated to be 50% ( obscured : unobscured=1:1 ) or as high as 87%(obscured : unobscured=2.6:1 ) if sources which are not confirmed spectroscopically are also taken into account . an obscured : unobscured ratio of 2:1 was also derived from a sample of agn selected at 24  @xcite .",
    "the existence of a large population of obscured agn is also suggested by the shape of the x - ray background at high energies .",
    "more than 85%  of the 210 kev cosmic x - ray background has been resolved by sources detected in deep x - ray surveys  @xcite . however , the resolved fraction decreases at higher energies , e.g. in the 4 - 6 kev energy range the resolved fraction is about 7090% , whilst in the 812 kev band no more than 50%is resolved .",
    "less than 30% is resolved above 10 kev , where the bulk of the cxrb energy density is produced  @xcite .",
    "the spectral shape of the residual background can not be produced by a simple superposition of unobscured agn spectra , but by an x - ray population with faint low - energy x - ray fluxes and hard x - ray spectra , as in obscured agn  @xcite .      in spite of the difficulty of finding and identifying highly obscured agn , several searches have been conducted combining multiwavelength data  @xcite , performing very deep observations  @xcite or surveying large areas of the sky  @xcite .",
    "obscured agn candidates have been selected among x - ray sources with hard x - ray spectra or with high ( @xmath410 ) x - ray over optical flux ratios  @xcite , with radio emission in excess compared to the ir  @xcite or with narrow emission lines in their optical spectra  @xcite .",
    "these sources are predominantly characterized by column densities of the order of 10@xmath82 and by various types of optical spectra , with narrow emission lines as expected in type 2 agn , but also with broad emission lines , as in unobscured agn , or typical of normal , early and late - type , galaxies  @xcite .",
    "all these studies aimed at finding the obscured agn population predicted by models and indirect observations have been successful to varying degrees . however , most of these sample are affected by selection effects and characterized by properties too broad to constrain models , and the measured column densities are only moderate ( = 10@xmath172 ) .",
    "a common property of these moderately obscured agn is the variety of optical / near - ir spectral energy distributions ( seds ) , with only a minority of sources showing typical agn signatures  @xcite .",
    "consequently , any search in a specific wavelength range will provide incomplete samples of obscured agn .    in this work",
    ", we aim at identifying and characterizing only the most obscured agn , with columns densities of the order of 10@xmath18 2 , the so - called compton - thick agn . by looking at the most obscured agn which are also the hardest to find because of their elusive properties ,",
    "we hope to provide useful constraints on agn models .",
    "our analysis is based on the sources detected by  and  in a wide area ( 0.6 ) multi - wavelength ( from radio to x - ray ) survey performed in the lockman hole , the /swire survey .",
    "this field was selected for deep follow - up observations within the  wide - area infrared extragalactic survey ( swire )  @xcite legacy project . by comparing samples selected independently in the x - rays and in the ir ,",
    "the incompleteness level of each selection method can be estimated .",

    "indicate that the source is heavily obscured . however , the observed optical continuum is blue and the spectrum shows emission lines with broad components . a plausible explanation for the observed optical spectrum could be scattering .",

    "the fraction of scattered radiation can be estimated by comparing the observed and the intrinsic ( unabsorbed ) optical flux .",
    "since the observed optical spectrum is similar to that observed in optically selected quasars and scattering does not modify the spectral shape of the intrinsic spectrum , we estimated the intrinsic optical flux by assuming that the intrinsic , before absorption , sed of sw104409 is similar to that of an unobscured qso normalized at the observed mid - ir observed flux . in figure",

    ", sw104409 resembles an optically selected quasar whose light is reddened by an extinction a@xmath106=4 mag and , therefore , completely suppressed at the observed optical wavelengths ( ultraviolet in the rest - frame ) and reddened in the near - ir ( optical in the rest - frame ) .",
    "assuming that the observed optical blue spectrum is due to scattering , the scattered fraction corresponds to 0.6%  of the intrinsic optical emission .",
    "note that throughout this work , we apply reddening as prescribed in  @xcite .",
    "we also investigated the use of the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) extinction curve  @xcite that well reproduces the optical spectra of dust reddened quasars in sdss  @xcite .",
    "the two prescriptions produce similar reddening at @xmath1075000 , but the smc law produces redder spectra at shorter wavelengths for the same amount of extinction .",
    "different geometries of the obscuring material were investigated by comparing the observed sed of sw104409 with predictions from radiative transfer models within the agn unification scenarios .",
    "the models assume that the absorbing material is distributed in a toroidal shape around the central heating source .",
    "two geometries were taken into account , flared and tapered disks , as described in detail in  @xcite . in flared disks the thickness of the disk increases linearly with distance from the central source . in tapered disks",
    "the thickness of the disk in the inner part also increases linearly with distance from the source but stays constant in the outer part .",
    "we find that a good fit to the rest - frame ultraviolet to mid - ir spectrum of sw104409 can be obtained with a tapered disk with an opening angle of 60 degrees .",
    "the predicted sed for this model is shown in figure  [ ae_model ] and compared to the observed sed of sw104409 .",
    "the predicted inclination of the line of sight with respect to the disk axis ( 61 degrees ) implies that it is almost grazing the boundaries of the torus .",
    "the line of sight optical depth at 1000   rest - frame through the torus is 700 which corresponds to an optical depth @xmath108=129 or a@xmath106=140 .",
    "the best - fit model also assumes that the emission from the torus suffers additional extinction of 0.5 magnitudes by dust which is located at some distance from the nucleus ; e.g. in the host galaxy .",
    "the predicted optical emission , which well agrees with the observed optical data , is produced by light scattered by the torus .",
    "due to the high optical depth to the central source , the optical emission must be scattered light . according to this model",
    ", scattering takes place in the inner walls of the disk and its surface , therefore , in order to observe scattered light the inclination must be slightly larger than the opening angle of the disk . in case of larger inclination angles , the disk would obscure the scattered light . for inclination angles smaller than the opening angle , the scattered light would still be visible , however this geometry would be inconsistent with the obscured nature of this source .",
    "the similarity between the inclination and opening angles is also suggested by the observed 110  sed , characteristic of emission from hot dust . since the scattering region and the hot dust region",
    "are almost co - spatial , the inclination must be similar to the opening angle , otherwise the disk would obscure the emission from this region .",
    "an alternative to this model is scattering produced by electrons or dust in the opening cone of the accretion disk , instead than from the walls of the disk . in this case",
    "the similarity between the opening and inclination angles is not required , however it would still be required to explain the shape of the near- to mid - ir continuum .",
    "this model is consistent with the simple scenario described above .",
    "the large difference in the amount of extinction is likely due to the different assumptions made for the dust distribution . in the simple model of scattering+obscured qso , we assume a foreground screen of dust absorbing the emitted radiation .",
    "this assumption does not take into account re - emission from dust and produces an underestimation of the dust opacity .",
    "radiative transfer models are more accurate in estimating the dust opacity since they take into account the transmission of the intrinsic radiation through the dusty material . according to the results from the radiative transfer model and assuming a galactic dust to gas ratio ,",
    "the estimated gas column density surrounding the central regions is @xmath32.6@xmath3110@xmath81 2 , consistent with what is observed in the x - ray .",
    "however , since the x - ray emission is produced in the nucleus and the optical and near - ir radiation are emitted in the outer regions , the absorbing gas intercepted by the x - ray photons is expected to be closer to the disk plane and have a larger column density than the material intercepted by the optical / near - ir radiation . in spite of its simplicity , the proposed picture reconciles the multiwavelength observations of sw104409 and agrees well with the unification model .",
    "the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of sw104406 is shown in figure  [ figsed2 ] .",
    "the optical spectrum is characterized by a blue continuum as in the case of sw104409 with no indication for intrinsic reddening . as in the case of sw104409 ,",
    "the optical data are characterized by a u - band drop - out which is probably caused by igm attenuation .",
    "sw104406 also fits within the conventional definition of eros with an observed -@xmath30=4.82 ( vega ) .",
    "its sed is very similar to the sed of mrk 231 after applying an additional extinction of a@xmath109=0.2 as shown in figure  [ figlum2 ] .",
    "the optical spectrum can be fitted with this reddened template and an additional component , as scattered light , is not required by the data .",

    "in summary , both sources show seds where the agn dominates at all observed wavelengths and any contribution from other energy source is negligible .",
    "the observed sed are both consistent with a scenario in which the optical and near - ir sources are obscured . in the x - rays ,",
    "the observed spectrum is likely due to the transmitted direct component seen through compton - thick matter .",

    "we also notice a discrepancy in the column density estimates , their values being on average 2.5 times larger than what we would predict with our method .",
    "although this would yield larger luminosities , their correction factor due to the different spectral model is much smaller than ours , thus their absorption - corrected rest - frame luminosities are lower that what we would estimate .",

    "their smaller x - ray luminosities imply smaller agn bolometric luminosities , black - hole masses and accretion rates by the same factors .",
    "a third difference between our methods is in the derivation of bolometric luminosity .",
    "they assume a constant factor between the absorption - corrected rest - frame x - ray luminosity and the bolometric luminosity of 6% , while we add the luminosity measured throughout the whole spectrum ( 30%  for sw104409 and 1%  for sw104406 ; see section  [ lum_mbh ] ) . even after correcting by the factors described above",
    ", the differences in agn luminosity , smbh mass and accretion rate between the two quasars presented in this work and the sample in  @xcite are still significant , more than one order of magnitude compared to almost two order of magnitude initially measured .",

    "the number of compton - thick agn detectable in the /swire field is of at least 25 sources deg@xmath2 and only 33% of them are detected in the x - ray down to a flux limit of 10@xmath52s .",
    "the x - ray over optical flux ratios of the selected obscured agn cover a similar range as the rest of the x - ray sample and well overlap with those observed for `` classical '' agn , indicating that searches for heavily obscured agn among x - ray sources with extreme x - ray over optical flux ratios might miss a large fraction of these sources .    the complete sample of agn selected on the basis of a red power - law like ir sed contains 181 sources , of which 61 show seds similar to those of unobscured agn , and 120 are obscured agn candidates .",
    "the complete sample corresponds to only about 20%  of the total number of agn expected to be detected in the mid - ir at our sensitivity .",
    "the observed ratio between obscured and unobscured agn is 2:1 , still lower than the models predictions , @xmath33:1 .",
    "the estimated surface density of compton - thick agn is only 10% the expected value .",
    "these results suggest that even in the mid - ir , heavily obscured agn are elusive .",
    "optical spectroscopy of two obscured agn candidates confirmed that they are high redshift , sw104409 at @xmath6=2.54 and sw104406 at @xmath6=2.43 , compton - thick qsos .",
    "these sources , characterized by type 2 agn spectra , very red optical - ir seds and high x - ray luminosities ( @xmath146 ) , have properties ( seds , luminosities and smbh masses ) similar to those observed in the high-@xmath6 compton - thick quasars cxo-52 ( @xmath6=3.288 ;  @xcite ) , and cdfs-202 ( @xmath6=3.700 ;  @xcite ) . however , they differ from sub - millimeter selected compton - thick agn  @xcite where emission from a starburst dominates at most wavelengths and black - hole masses and accretion rates are one order of magnitude lower .",
    "sw104409 represents the most luminous ( @xmath147 ) compton - thick qsos at high-@xmath6 currently known with a smbh mass comparable to the most massive local smbh ( @xmath33@xmath148 ) .",
    "such a rare object can be found when large volumes are sampled as in the swire/  field ( @xmath30.6 ) .",
