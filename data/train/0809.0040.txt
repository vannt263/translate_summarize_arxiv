    "the experimental realization of multi - component condensate systems in the late-90s @xcite has renewed the interest in the subject of miscibility of two distinguishable condensates in a binary mixture @xcite . whether two condensates coexist in the same spatial volume ( miscibility ) or  repel each other into separate spatial regions ( immiscibility or phase separation ) or even collapse when they are brought together",
    "is largely determined by the relative strength between inter- and intra - species s - wave scattering lengths . the ability to change the two - body interactions by tuning",
    "the magnetic field across the feshbach resonance in atomic systems has enabled the observation of phase separations , that are otherwise impossible with traditional condensed matter environments , to be accessed experimentally .",
    "the recent experimental demonstration of rich phase structure including the phase separation in an unbalanced fermionic superfluidity system ketterle06,hulet06 serves as a great testament to the remarkable controllability that the technique of feshbach resonance can bring to the atomic system .    in this paper",
    ", we consider a model where bosonic atoms of two different species are coupled to a bound heteronuclear molecular state via the interspecies feshbach resonance ( we will simply refer to it as the heteronuclear model in this paper ) .",
    "chiefly due to their large permanent electric dipole moments , ultracold heteronuclear molecules are thought to hold great promise in applications such as quantum computing and simulation @xcite , and precision measurement of fundamental symmetry @xcite and constants flambaum07,zelevinsky08,demille081 . as such",
    ", the study of cold heteronuclear molecules has evolved into one of the most hotly pursued researches in the field of atomic , molecular and optical physics hutson06 .",
    "the recent experimental efforts both in achieving the tunable interaction between @xmath0k and @xmath1rb @xcite and in demonstrating the ability of the feshbach resonance to control the miscibility of a @xmath2rb-@xmath1rb dual - species bec @xcite have further stimulated our interest in the proposed model .    in an earlier paper @xcite ,",
    "we have concentrated on the coherent creation of heteronuclear molecular condensates ( similar studies can also be found in reference @xcite**)**. in this paper , we will focus on constructing zero - temperature phase diagrams , paying particular attentions to phase separation and collapse .  in models with a broad feshbach resonance ,",
    "the molecular component can be adiabatically eliminated ; this approximation leads to an effective binary condensate system , whose properties were investigated extensively in the past  ho96,ao98,bohn97,pu98,timmermans98 . in general , we must treat the molecular component as an independent degree of freedom , regarding our model as a genuine three - species condensate system . however , our system is fundamentally different from the independent gas model @xcite , where no interspecies conversions can take place .",
    "the conversion between atoms and molecules can lead to phenomena unconventional to the independent gas model , as has been pointed out by radzihovsky _",

    "the surprise , that the homonuclear model admits the molecular superfluid ( msf ) but not the pure atomic superfluid ( asf ) , was traced to the _ intraspecies _",
    "feshbach  process which takes _ two _ atoms from the same species to form _ one _ molecule .",
    "this is no longer the case for the _ interspecies _ feshbach process which requires only _ one _ atom from each species to produce _ one _ molecule .",
    "but , it creates a new surprise - the doubly mixed phases with two nonvanishing order parameters which are ubiquitous in the independent gas model are completely absent from our system .",
    "for the same reason , not only the pure molecular phase but also the pure atomic superfluids can exist in the heteronuclear model .",
    "this along with the possibility of simultaneously tuning the feshbach energy and the atomic population imbalance ( an extra control knob  unique to the heteronuclear model ) makes the number of experimentally accessible phase separations ( summarized in sec .",

    "the same section also presents the nonlinear coupled equation governing the mixed atom - molecule superfluid phase , and generalize the stability conditions to our three - component system . in sec .",
    "v , we provide numerical examples that showcase the ability of our system to support a rich set of phase separation possibilities while at the same time elucidate the effects of the feshbach coupling and the particle collisions on the miscibility property of our system .",

    "we first note that our model allows the existence of both msf and asf , in contrast to the homonuclear model , which supports msf but not asf . in our model ,",
    "the energy density due to the feshbach coupling is @xmath76 , which is symmetric with respect to the exchange of any pair of states and hence does not favor the formation of one pure phase to another .  in the homonuclear model , on the other hand , the energy density due to the feshbach coupling is in the asymmetric form of @xmath77 .",
    "with such a form , condensation of atoms will inevitably lead to the formation of the molecular condensate while condensation of molecules can take place in the absence of the atomic population .",
    "we emphasize that this classification holds only in the presence of the feshbach coupling @xmath78 . in a typical three interacting gas system",
    "where @xmath79 , the system supports , besides all the phases listed above , doubly mixed phases , for example , asf1-msf in which @xmath80 @xmath81 , @xmath75 , and @xmath82 .",
    "the absence of the doubly mixed phases can again be attributed to the unique form of the feshbach coupling , @xmath83 , in the heteronuclear model .",
    "this term dictates that the existence of condensate population in any pair of states will lead to the condensation in the third component , which precludes the possibility of forming the doubly mixed phases where the population in the third component is zero .",
    "we also comment that for a given set of chemical potentials , while asf1 , asf2 , and msf are unique , amsf , due to the highly nonlinear nature of eq .",
    "( [ psi123 ] ) , may itself be divided into different types depending on the density distribution among three species .",
    "such an example will be given in sec .",
    "[ sec : twoamsfs ] . finally ,  this classification ,",
    "although obtained under the condition of zero temperature , can provide a useful road map for understanding the phase diagrams at finite temperature . at finite temperature , state ( i )",
    "becomes the so - called normal state where the gas mixture does not possess any order , and other states become mixed in the sense that superfluidities and thermal densities are both present .",
    "lowering temperature reduces the entropy and restores the order to the gas system , thereby giving rise to a hierarchy of critical temperatures associated with phase transitions that break symmetries at various levels .",
    "the subject of finite temperature phase diagrams will be left as a future study .      from eq .",
    "( [ psi123 ] ) we have determined the possible phases , which correspond to the critical points ( extrema or saddle points ) of the free energy density @xmath48 .",
    "we now turn our attention to studying their stability properties by identifying the local minimum of the function @xmath84 . for this purpose ,",
    "we first introduce the hessian matrix @xmath85where the matrix element is defined as @xmath86 , which , with the help of eq .",
    "( [ ka ] ) , are shown to have the form@xmath87note that we have defined the partial derivatives in the hessian matrix to be taken with respect to @xmath34 instead of @xmath88 so that we can carry out the stability analysis of both pure and mixed phases in a unified manner .",
    "a state ( phase ) is thermodynamically stable if it is a local minimum of the function @xmath48 for a given set of chemical potentials .",
    "this requires the hessian matrix to be positive semidefinite , which , for a symmetric matrix as in eq .",
    "( [ hessian ] ) , is possible if and only if all the principal minors of hessian matrix are nonnegative .",
    "this leads to a hierarchy of stability conditions    [ stability ] @xmath89which reflects the underling philosophy that for a three - component miscible system to be stable , all the subsets with single , double , and triple components must also independently satisfy the relevant stability conditions @xcite .",
    "in this section , we construct phase diagrams and discuss phase separations under a variety of conditions .  in all the numerical examples , we use two quantities , @xmath90 with the dimension of the density and @xmath91 with the dimension of the energy , to define a scaling which consists of the following set of dimensionless variables : @xmath92/@xmath93 @xmath94 @xmath95 @xmath96 , @xmath97 , and @xmath98 .  to gain a familiarity with the parameters , we consider the interspecies feshbach resonance around @xmath99 @xmath100 in the @xmath101-@xmath102 mixture , which is characterized with a magnetic field width @xmath103 @xmath100 , a magnetic moment difference @xmath104 ( @xmath105 being the bohr magneton ) , and a background scattering length @xmath106 ( @xmath107 being the bohr radius ) @xcite .  for a typical density @xmath108 @xmath109 ,",

    "this includes solving eqs .",
    "( [ psi123 ] ) to obtain different phases and to perform stability analysis according to the criteria ( [ stability ] ) .",
    "these diagrams enable us to identify the regions where different phases overlap and hence help to answer the question of into which phases an unstable homogeneous system will separate .",
    "however , from the experimental point of view , more useful are the phase diagrams in the @xmath120-@xmath121 ( @xmath122 space , which are directly accessible to experiments via two control `` knobs '' , the feshbach detuning @xmath6 and the two species atomic condensate population difference @xmath121 .      in order to identify the roles of collisions more clearly in later sections ,",
    "we first consider a situations where we artificially turn off all the @xmath123-wave scatterings .  for pedagogical reasons , here we only present the phase diagrams in the @xmath6-@xmath121 space , which are in practice translated from the phase diagrams in the chemical potential space ( see the example in sec .",

    "we have shown that the molecule - molecule collision can stabilize the amsf on the molecular side of the feshbach resonance .",
    "we have identified the interspecies feshbach interaction to be the cause for the absence of the doubly mixed phases , as well as the reason for the presence of both pure atom and pure molecule phases in our model .",
    "this provides the opportunity , as we have indeed verified numerically , for observing the phase separation not only between amsf and msf but also those between amsf and pure asfs .",
    "we have also studied the collapse or partial collapse of the amsf as special phase separations where one of the separated components is the vacuum . under certain conditions , we have even found that our system is able to phase separate into two distinct amsfs , which , we speculate , is a property unique to the heteronuclear model .",
