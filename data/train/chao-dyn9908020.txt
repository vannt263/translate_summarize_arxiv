    "several authors have enquired recently about the relationship between phase space dynamics of a dynamical system and thermodynamics @xcite .",
    "the question acquires a special relevance for the dissipative system when the phase space volume contracts by virtue of possessing the attractors and also when the system is nonlinear and comprises a few - degrees - of - freedom .",
    "thus even when these systems are not truly statistical in the thermodynamic sense , it is possible that chaotic diffusion due to intrinsic deterministic chaos or stochasticity plays a significant role in the dynamics .",
    "it is therefore worthwhile to enquire about the relationship between _ chaotic diffusion _ in a dynamical system and the _ thermodynamically - inspired quantities like entropy production and entropy flux_. our purpose in this paper is to address this specific issue .    in what follows we",
    "shall be concerned with the nonlinear dynamical systems which are chaotic and dissipative .",
    "we do not consider any stochasticity due to thermal environment or external nonthermal noise .",
    "the `` deterministic stochasticity '' ( i.e , chaos ) has a purely dynamical basis and its emergence in nonlinear dynamical system is essentially due to loss of correlation of initially nearby trajectories .",
    "this is reflected in the linear stability matrix or jacobian of the system @xcite .",
    "when chaos has fully set in , the time dependence of this matrix can be described as a stochastic process , since the phase space variables behave as stochastic variables @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that this fluctuation is amenable to a theoretical description in terms of the theory of multiplicative noise @xcite .",
    "based on this consideration a number of important results of nonequilibrium statistical mechanics , like kubo relations , fluctuation - decoherence relation , fluctuation - dissipation relation and exponential divergence of quantum fluctuations have been realized in chaotic dynamics of a few - degree - of - freedom system @xcite . in the present paper",
    "we make use of this stochastic description of chaotic dynamics to formulate a fokker - planck equation of probability density function for the relevant dynamical variables , the `` stochasticity '' ( i.e , chaoticity ) being incorporated through the fluctuations of the time - dependent linear stability matrix .",
    "once the drift and chaotic diffusion terms are appropriately identified the thermodynamic - like quantities can be derived with the help of the suitable information entropy balance equation .",
    "the outlay of the paper is as follows : in sec .",
    "ii we introduce a fokker - planck description of the dynamical system and identify the chaotic drift and diffusion terms .",
    "this is followed by setting up of an information entropy balance equation in sec .",
    "we then look for the entropy flux and entropy production - like terms in the steady state .",
    "the shift of stationary state due to additional external forcing and the associated change in entropy production is considered in sec .",
    "we illustrate the theory in detail with the help of an example in sec . v. the paper",
    "is concluded in sec .",
    "we are concerned here with a general n - degree - of - freedom system whose hamiltonian is given by @xmath0 where @xmath1 are the co - ordinate and momentum of the i - th degree - of - freedom , respectively , which satisfy the generic form of equations    @xmath2    we now make the hamiltonian system dissipative by introducing @xmath3 on the right hand side of the second of eqs.(2 ) .",

    "@xmath8 is an @xmath7 null matrix , the equation of motion for the dissipative system can be written as @xmath9    we now consider two nearby trajectories , @xmath10 and @xmath11 , @xmath12 at the same time @xmath13 in @xmath14 dimensional phase space .",
    "the time evolution of separation of these trajectories is then determined by @xmath15 in the tangent space or separation co - ordinate space @xmath16 , where @xmath17 therefore the @xmath18 linear stability matrix @xmath19 assumes the following form @xmath20 \\label{e6}\\ ] ] where m is an @xmath7 matrix .",
    "note that the time dependence of stability matrix @xmath21 is due to the second derivative @xmath22 which is determined by the equation of motion ( 3 ) .",
    "the procedure for calculation of @xmath23 and the related quantities like lyapunov exponents is to solve the trajectory equation ( 3 ) simultaneously with eq.(4 ) .",
    "thus when the dissipative system described by ( 3 ) is chaotic , ( t ) becomes ( `` deterministically '' ) stochastic phase space due to the fact that @xmath24-s behave as stochastic phase space variables and the equation of motion ( [ e4 ] ) in the tangent space can be interpreted as a stochastic equation @xcite .    in the next step",
    "we shall be concerned with a stochastic description of @xmath21 or @xmath25 . for convenience",
    "we split up m into two parts as @xmath26 where @xmath27 is independent of variables @xmath28 and therefore behaves a constant part and @xmath29 is determined by the variables @xmath28 for @xmath30 .",
    "@xmath29 refers to the fluctuating part .",
    "we now rewrite the equation of motion ( 4 ) in the tangent space as @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the vectors with @xmath14 components .",
    "corresponding to ( [ e7 ] ) @xmath33 in ( [ e8 ] ) can be split up again to yield    @xmath34    eq.([e4 ] ) indicates that eq.([e8 ] ) is linear in @xmath35 .",
    "eqs.([e4 ] ) , ( [ e5 ] ) and ( [ e6 ] ) express the fact the first @xmath36 components of @xmath37 are zero and the last @xmath36 components of @xmath37 are the functions of @xmath35 for @xmath38 only .",

    "( explicitly @xmath42 for @xmath38 and @xmath43 for @xmath44 ) and since @xmath45 for @xmath46 and @xmath47 for @xmath48 we have @xmath49 .",
    "this allows us to write the following relation ( which will be used later on ) , @xmath50 where @xmath51 ) is any function of @xmath35 .",
    "note that eq.([e9 ] ) by virtue of ( [ e8 ] ) is a linear differential equation with multiplicative `` noise '' due to @xmath28 determined by equation of motion ( [ e3 ] ) .",
    "this is the starting point of our further analysis .",

    "@xmath61 is a parameter introduced from outside to keep track of the order of fluctuations in the calculations .",
    "at the end we put @xmath62 .",
    "one of the main results for the linear equations of the form ( [ e13 ] ) with multiplicative noise may now be in order @xcite .",
    "the average equation of @xmath63 obeys [ @xmath64 , @xmath65    the above result is based on second order cumulant expansion and is valid when fluctuations are small but rapid and the correlation time @xmath66 is short but finite or more precisely    @xmath67    we have , in general , @xmath68 . here @xmath69 implies @xmath70 .",
    "the eq.([e14 ] ) is exact in that limit @xmath71 .",
    "making use of relation ( [ e12 ] ) in ( [ e11 ] ) we obtain @xmath72 the above equation can be transformed into the following fokker - planck equation ( @xmath73 ) for probability density function @xmath74 , ( the details are given in the appendix a ) ; @xmath75 where , @xmath76 and @xmath77 is a @xmath14-dimensional vector whose components are defined by @xmath78 here the determinants @xmath79 , @xmath80 and @xmath81 are given by @xmath82    it is easy to recognize @xmath83 as an evolution operator . because of the dissipative perturbation we note that div @xmath84 .    the diffusion coefficient @xmath85 in eq.([e17 ] )",
    "is defined as @xmath86 we have followed closely van kampen s approach @xcite to generalized fokker - planck equation ( [ e17 ] ) . before concluding this section several critical remarks regarding this derivation need attention :    first",
    ", the process @xmath87 determined by @xmath28 is obtained _ exactly _ by solving equations of motion ( [ e3 ] ) for the chaotic motion of the system .",
    "it is therefore necessary to emphasize that we have _ not assumed _ any special property of noise , such as , @xmath87 is gaussian or @xmath88-correlated . we reiterate van kampen s emphasis in this approach .",
    "second , the only assumption made about the noise is that its correlation time @xmath66 is short but finite compared to the coarse - grained timescale over which the average quantities evolve . or in other words the velocity changes should be small , smooth and uncorreleted after short times .",
    "this assumption , however , puts a restriction on the applicability of the present theory to certain class of systems , e. g. , systems subjected to ` hard ' collisions such as billiards and molecular systems also in certain non - dissipative hamiltonian systems like standard map for which the usual assumptions about the rapid decay of correlations and fluctuations are not valid and entropy production does not occur .",
    "the special reference may be made in this connection to the work of zaslavsky and collaborators @xcite to demonstrate that in many real systems the decay of correlation exhibits power law dependence , distributions admit of infinite moments and the fluctuations become long - lasting . since the mathematical difficulties of dealing with finite arbitrary correlation time of noise in a chaotic system is quite formidable",
    "we confine ourselves in the present discussion to chaotic systems with short but finite noise correlation time .",
    "third , we take care of fluctuations upto second order which implies that the deterministic noise is not too strong .",
    "eq.([e17 ] ) is the required fokker - planck equation in the tangent space @xmath35 .",
    "however the important point is to note that the drift and diffusion terms are determined by the phase space @xmath28 properties of the chaotic system and directly depend on the correlation function of the fluctuations of the second derivatives of the hamiltonian ( [ e5 ] ) .",
    "we shall now consider the well - known relation between probability density function @xmath74 and information entropy @xmath89 as given by    @xmath90    note that in the above definition of entropy we use @xmath91 , the probability distribution function in the tangent space since one is concerned here with the expansion of the phase space in terms of a tangent space and dialation coefficients of the dynamical system for which the expanding and contracting manifolds can be defined . on the other hand",
    "it is worthwhile to recall the dynamic entropy of a dynamical system ( kolmogorov entropy ) defined in terms of the properties of evolution in the tangent space .",
    "a remark on the connection between entropy and expansion by sinai @xcite is noteworthy in this context ; `` it already seems clear that positiveness of the entropy and presence of mixing is related to extreme instability of the motion of the system : trajectories emanating from the nearby points must , generally speaking , diverge with exponential velocity .",
    "thus entropy is characterized here by the speed of approach of the asymptotic trajectories '' which is formalized by defining the expansion coefficient as logarithm of the relative increase under the flow of a volume element in the expanding manifold .",
    "our definition of information entropy ( 22 ) makes use of the tangent space description of the systems in terms of logarithm of the probability of expansion in the tangent space , keeping in mind that @xmath92 is `` a measure of unexpectedness of an event ( the amount of information ) and the information entropy is a mean value of this unexpectedness for the entire system '' @xcite .",
    "the definition ( 22 ) is therefore different from kolmogorov entropy .",
    "we emphasize that even in absence of any direct formal connection between @xmath91 and the phase space distribution function it is possible to use the distribution function @xmath91 defined in the tangent space to have an explicit expression for entropy production - like quantity as a function of the properties of phase space variables @xmath28 of the dynamical system ( i. e. , in terms of drift and diffusion coefficients of the fokker - planck equation ) .    the above definition of an information entropy like quantity allows us to have an evolution equation for entropy . to this end",
    "we observe from eqs.([e17 ] ) and ( [ e22 ] ) that @xcite    @xmath93 \\ln p \\ ; \\ ; \\;. \\label{e23}\\ ] ]    note that the probability density function p(x , t ) is defined in tangent space @xmath35 . @xmath94 and @xmath83 as expressed in eqs.([e21 ] ) and ( [ e18 ] ) , respectively , are determined by the correlation functions of fluctuations of second derivative of the hamiltonian of the system .",
    "eq.([e23 ] ) therefore suggests that the entropy production - like term originating from eq.([e23 ] ) is likely to bear the signature of the chaotic dynamics .",
    "the relation is direct and general as it is evident from the following equation [ obtained after partial integration of eq.([e23 ] ) with the natural boundary condition on @xmath74 that it vanishes as @xmath95 and assuming the @xmath32-dependence of @xmath85 to be weak ( as a first approximation ) ] ;    @xmath96    the first term in ( [ e24 ] ) has no definite sign while the second term is positive definite because of positive definiteness of @xmath85 .",
    "therefore the second one can be identified @xcite as the entropy production @xmath97 in the steady state .",
    "the subscript @xmath98 of @xmath99 refers to steady state .",
    "it is evident from eq.([e24 ] ) that    @xmath100    note that since the chaotic system is dissipative @xmath101 is negative [ see eq.([e18 ] ) ] .",
    "it is thus evident that the relations ( [ e25 ] ) , ( [ e26 ] ) illustrate the dynamical origin of entropy production like quantity in a chaotic dissipative system .",
    "the dynamical signature is manifested through the drift term @xmath83 and the chaotic diffusion terms in @xmath85 .",
    "it must be emphasized that the notion of diffusion has nothing to do with any external reservoir .",
    "rather it pertains to intrinsic diffusion in phase space of the chaotic system itself .",
    "we shall now examine the entropy production when the dissipative chaotic system is thrown away from the steady state due to an additional weak applied force . to this end",
    "we consider the drift @xmath102 due to external force so that the total drift @xmath83 has now two contributions    @xmath103    when @xmath104 , @xmath105 .",
    "the deviation of @xmath106 from @xmath99 in presence of nonzero small @xmath107 can be explicitly taken into account once we make use of the identity for the diffusion term @xcite    @xmath108 + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_i}\\left [ p_s \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_j}\\frac{p}{p_s}\\right ]   \\ ; \\ ; . \\label{e28}\\ ] ]    when @xmath105 the second term in ( [ e28 ] ) vanishes . in presence of additional forcing the eq.([e17 ] ) becomes , @xmath109 where @xmath110 is defined as @xmath111 here we have assumed for simplicity that @xmath85 is not affected by the additional forcing .",
    "the leading order influence is taken into account by the additional drift term in eq.([e29 ] ) .    under steady state condition @xmath112 and @xmath104 , the second and the third terms in ( [ e29 ] ) vanish yielding    @xmath113    it is immediately apparent that @xmath114 refers to a current @xmath115 where @xmath116 .",
    "the steady state condition therefore reduces to an equilibrium condition ( @xmath117 ) if @xmath118 ( in sec .",
    "v we shall consider an explicit example to show that @xmath119 ) .",
    "this suggests a formal relation between @xmath120 and @xmath85 as @xmath121 where @xmath99 may now be referred to as the _ equilibrium _ density function in separation co - ordinate space .",
    "@xmath122 contains dissipation constant @xmath4 and the diffusion matrix @xmath85 is a function of correlation function of fluctuations of the second derivative of the hamiltonian .    to consider the information entropy balance equation in presence of external forcing we first differentiate eq.([e22 ] ) with respect to time and use eq.([e29 ] ) to obtain @xmath123 \\",
    "; \\;. \\label{e34}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    it is apparent that as @xmath106 deviates from @xmath99 , @xmath124 differs from unity and the entire second integral within the parenthesis @xcite is of the second order . note that @xmath125 in the first integral in eq.([e34 ] ) is a constant of motion and the integral denotes its average .",
    "the first term vanishes because it is of higher order as it involves @xmath126 and others .",
    "( moreover since in the discussion that follows we consider the steady state , this term does not contribute to the subsequent calculations ) . to compute the contribution @xmath127 to entropy balance due to the external forcing only we perform integration of the second , third and fourth terms by parts .",
    "we thus obtain ,    @xmath128    where we have put @xmath129 . in the new steady state ( in presence of @xmath130 ) , the entropy production and the flux like terms balance each other as follows : @xmath131 with @xmath132 and @xmath133    in the following section we shall work out a specific example to provide explicit expressions for the entropy production and some related quantities due to external forcing .",
    "to illustrate the theory developed above , we now choose a driven double - well oscillator system with hamiltonian @xmath134 where @xmath135 and @xmath136 are the momentum and position variables of the system . @xmath137 and @xmath138 are the constants characterizing the potential .",
    "@xmath139 includes the effect of coupling constant and the driving strength of the external field with frequency @xmath140 . this model ( [ e39 ] )",
    "has been extensively used in recent years for the study of chaotic dynamics @xcite .",
    "the dissipative equations of motion for the tangent space variables @xmath141 and @xmath142 corresponding to @xmath136 and @xmath135 ( eq.8 ) read as follows : @xmath143 = \\underline{j } \\left [ \\begin{array}{c } x_1 \\\\ x_2 \\end{array } \\right ] \\ ; \\ ; , \\ ; \\ ; \\left \\ { \\begin{array}{c } \\delta q_1 = x_1 \\\\ \\delta p_1 = x_2 \\end{array } \\right \\ } \\ ; \\ ; , \\label{e40}\\ ] ] where @xmath19 as expressed in our earlier notation @xmath144 is given by @xmath145 therefore @xmath19 reduces to @xmath146 where @xmath147 .",
    "thus we have @xmath148 eq.([e40 ] ) is thus rewritten as @xmath149 with @xmath150 where @xmath151 and @xmath37 are the constant and the fluctuating parts , respectively . the fluctuations in @xmath37 , i.e. , in @xmath152 is due to stochasticity of the following chaotic dissipative dynamical equations of motion ; @xmath153 now for the constant part and the fluctuating part we write @xmath154 we may then apply the result of eq.([a5 ] ) .",
    "the mapping @xmath155 is found by solving the ` unperturbed ' equations @xmath156 comparison with eq.([a7 ] ) shows that @xmath157 is free from @xmath142 .    as a short time approximation",

    "we also emphasize that for actual theoretical estimate of the entropy production in terms of the formulae ( 26 ) or ( 58 ) explicit evaluation of the diffusion coefficients is not required ( see the next section )",
    ". a straightforward calculation of drift is sufficient for the purpose .",
    "this point will be clarified in greater detail in the next sec.vb .    then the fokker - planck equation ( 17 ) for the dissipative driven double - well oscillator assumes the following form : @xmath170 where @xmath171 with @xmath172    the similarity of the equation ( 50 ) to generalized kramers equation can not be overlooked .",
    "this suggests a clear interplay of chaotic diffusive motion and dissipation in the dynamics .",
    "we now let @xmath173 where @xmath174 is a constant to be determined .    then under steady state condition eq.(50 ) reduces to the following form : @xmath175    where @xmath176 and @xmath177 here @xmath178 is again a constant to be determined . putting ( 52 ) in @xmath179 as given above and comparing the coefficients of @xmath141 and @xmath142 we obtain @xmath180 the physically allowed solutions for @xmath174 and @xmath178 are as follows ; @xmath181 the stationary solution of ( 53 ) @xmath99 is given by @xmath182 here @xmath36 is the normalization constant . by virtue of ( 55 ) @xmath110 corresponding to eq.(30 ) is therefore @xmath183 since @xmath114 defines a current , @xmath99 defines a zero current situation or an equilibrium condition .",
    "the equilibrium solution @xmath99 from ( 55 ) can now be used to calculate the steady state entropy production as given by eq.(25 ) .",

    "the entropy production in a truly thermodynamic system and in the present case are therefore distinct .",
    "to verify the above theoretical analysis in terms of numerical experiments we now concentrate on the following two points .",

    "e . , the probability density function @xmath186 attains a steady state distribution @xmath187 in the long time limit .",
    "second , the entropy production in the steady state calculated by the formula ( 58 ) needs to be verified numerically . to address the first issue we now proceed as follows ;    the dissipative chaotic dynamics corresponding to the model hamiltonian ( 39 ) is governed by eqs.(40 ) and ( 42 ) .",
    "we choose the following values of the parameters @xcite @xmath188 , @xmath189 , @xmath190 and @xmath191 .",

    "@xmath197 is determined by solving numerically eqs.(40 ) and ( 42 ) , simultaneously for the initial conditions of @xmath199 and @xmath200 corresponding to eq.(42 ) . to follow the evolution of @xmath141 numerically in time , i .",
    "e . , in going from j - th to ( j+1)-th step of iteration , say , @xmath141 has to be initialized as @xmath201 .",
    "( the time evolution of the other components of @xmath32 can be followed similarly ) .",

    "we refer to fig . 1 of ref",
    "j - th term of iteration means @xmath203 @xmath204 , where @xmath205 is the characteristic time which corresponds to the shortest ensemble averaged period of nonlinear dynamical system .    having obtained the time series in @xmath141 ( it may be noted that the series in @xmath23-s are also required for calculation of the largest lyapunov exponent as defined by @xmath206 for the chaotic system ) the stationary probability density function @xmath194 is computed as follows : the @xmath141 axis ranging from -2 to + 2 is divided into small intervals @xmath207 of size 0.025 .",
    "the time series in @xmath141 is computed over the time intervals of 1000 - 10000 times of the time period @xmath205 . for each time interval",
    "@xmath207 a counter is maintained and is initially set to zero before the simulation is started .",
    "the respective counter is incremented whenever @xmath141 falls within the given interval .",
    "finally the steady state probability distribution function @xmath194 is obtained by normalizing the counts .",
    "the result is shown in fig.1 for @xmath208 .",
    "our numerical analysis shows that the distribution function attains stationarity at around @xmath209 , beyond which no perceptible change in the distribution is obtained .",
    "we now turn to the second issue . in what follows we",
    "shall be concerned with the steady state entropy production ( 58 ) and its numerical verification .",
    "this quantity can be calculated in two different ways .",
    "first , it may be noted that the determination of @xmath210 ( eq.(57 ) ) rests on two quantities defined in the tangent space ; the steady state probability distribution function @xmath211 and the diffusion coefficient @xmath212 in @xmath213-space .",
    "once the procedure for calculation of the distribution function as illustrated above is known from the time series in @xmath141 or @xmath142 the evaluation of @xmath211 is quite straightforward since @xmath213 is expressed as @xmath214 according to ( 52 ) . here",
    "@xmath174 is given by ( 54 ) with @xmath215 and the average @xmath216 and the integral over the correlation function , @xmath217 are as defined in ( 51 ) .",
    "to calculate the correlation function @xmath218 and the average @xmath219 it is necessary to determine long time series in @xmath152 ( @xmath220 ) by numerically solving the classical equation of motion ( 42 ) in phase space followed by averaging over the time series . for further details of numerical analysis of correlation functions we refer to the earlier work @xcite .",
    "the diffusion coefficient @xmath212 can be numerically determined from the time series in @xmath213 .",
    "having known @xmath211 and @xmath212 one can make use of the formula ( 57 ) to obtain the entropy production in the steady state .",
    "@xmath210 is thus numerically calculated .",
    "the second procedure of calculation of @xmath210 is the direct theoretical evaluation of @xmath178 from the expression ( 54 ) .",
    "since the value of @xmath178 rests again on @xmath221 and @xmath4 and the dependence of @xmath221 on the averages and the correlation functions are already known from the numerical analysis of phase space , @xmath178 can be calculated in the usual way . in fig.2",
    "we compare the values of steady state entropy production thus obtained by the two different ways for several values of coupling - cum - field strength @xmath139 . here",
    "it should be noted that the curve connecting the squares ( theoretically calculated entropy production in the steady state ) corresponds to the negetive of entropy flux ( @xmath222 ) since for the given example @xmath222 in @xmath213 space is @xmath223 ( @xmath224 , from eq .",
    "( 26 ) ) for normalised probability distribution function @xmath225 .",
    "thus fig.2 is a numerical proof of @xmath226 .",
    "the agreement is found to be quite satisfactory .",
    "we therefore conclude that at least for the model studied here and for the similar class of models the correspondence between the formulae of steady state entropy production and the numerical computation is fairly general .",
    "we now introduce an additional weak forcing in the dynamics .",
    "this is achieved by subjecting the dissipative chaotic system to a weak magnetic field ( @xmath227 ) through a velocity ( @xmath228 ) dependent force term @xmath229 where @xmath230 and @xmath231 are the electric charge and the velocity of light .",
    "for simplicity we apply the constant field @xmath232 which is perpendicular to @xmath136-direction [ see eq.39 ] . in presence of this force field the motion of the particle",
    "will not be restricted to @xmath232 and @xmath136 only .",
    "we shall have to consider the other direction @xmath233 which is perpendicular to both @xmath136 and @xmath232 .    to make the notation consistent with eq.(8 ) we would now like to correspond @xmath234 and @xmath235 to @xmath236 and @xmath237 , respectively .",
    "the relevant equations of motion are therefore as follows ; @xmath238 here @xmath239 is the ratio of electric charge to the velocity of light used to put the equation in appropriate dimension .",
    "then the non - equilibrium situation ( due to additional forcing , @xmath240 ) corresponding to eq.(59 ) is governed by @xmath241 where @xmath242 or more explicitly , @xmath243    proceeding as before we make use of the transformation of variables using @xmath244 so that eq.(61 ) becomes @xmath245    where @xmath246    @xmath247 and @xmath248 in four dimension correspond to @xmath249 and @xmath250 in two dimension , respectively and    @xmath251    using ( 62 ) in ( 65 ) and comparing the coefficients of @xmath23-s we obtain @xmath252 where @xmath253 is a solution of the cubic algebraic equation @xmath254    we now seek for a perturbative solution of the algebraic equation ( 67 ) which is given by ( h as a small parameter ) ; @xmath255 where @xmath256 is the solution of ( 67 ) for @xmath257 ; @xmath258 this is identical to @xmath178 ( eq.54 ) . therefore by virtue of eqs.(66 - 69 ) all the constants in ( 62 ) , i.e. , @xmath259 are now known .",
    "the stationary solution of ( 63 ) is now given by , @xmath260 where @xmath261 is the normalization constant .",
    "we are now in a position to calculate the steady state entropy flux @xmath262 due to external forcing ( @xmath130 ) from eq.(38 ) @xmath263 where the components of @xmath102 can be identified as @xmath264 and @xmath265 denotes the deviation from the initial equilibrium state due to external forcing . for normalized probability functions @xmath266 and @xmath99 the first integral in ( 71 ) vanishes .",
    "since @xmath99 is given by ( 55 ) with @xmath213 as defined in ( 52 ) , the expression for ( 71 ) reduces to @xmath267 we now use the following transformations of variables @xmath268 to calculate the integrals , @xmath269 which yield @xmath270 \\ ; \\;.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    for numerical verification of the above theoretical result ( 76 ) one can calculate entropy production ( @xmath271 ) numerically in the steady state in presence of weak forcing from eq .",
    "( 37 ) as in the previous subsection .",
    "( 37 ) for the present example reduces to the following form in the steady state ,    @xmath272    to calculate numerically @xmath271 @xmath273 @xmath274 and @xmath99 can be determined by directly using the procedure mentioned in the subsection vb and by simultaneously solving eqs .",
    "( 41 ) and ( 42 ) .",
    "similarly one can calculate @xmath275 from eqs .",
    "( 42 ) and ( 59 ) . finally making use of all these quantities in eq .",
    "( 77 ) @xmath271 can be obtained .",
    "thus the numerically evaluated @xmath271 should correspond to the results of eq .",
    "( 76 ) since our numerical verification in fig.2 shows good agreement between numerical and theoretical results , @xmath274 being very close to @xmath249 and @xmath250 , respectively , since @xmath107 is very small .    in the limit @xmath107 and @xmath4 small the above expression ( 76 ) can be simplified further . to this end",
    "we first note that @xmath276 this reduces @xmath94 further as follows ; @xmath277 thus we have @xmath278 making use of ( 78 - 80 ) , expression ( 76 ) can be approximated as @xmath279 this expression is due to average of the work per unit time of the external force @xmath232 acting on the chaotic system .",
    "note that the quadratic dependence on the magnetic field @xmath232 in eq .",
    "( 81 ) is characteristic of an expression for entropy production in the steady state .",
    "since the system is not thermostated this is independent of temperature .",
    "although the leading order expression ( 81 ) is apparently free from diffusion coefficients , a close look into the more exact expression ( 76 ) reveals that their influence is quite significant in the higher order .",
    "ever since the development of the theory of chaos , the dynamical variables in the strong chaotic regime have been interpreted as stochastic variables .",
    "one of the earliest well - known examples in this connection was set by demonstrating @xcite the linear divergence of mean - square momentum in time in standard map , mimicking the brownian motion . in the present paper",
    "we have tried to relate this chaotic diffusion to thermodynamic - like quantities by establishing a generalized fokker - planck equation pertaining to the tangent space .",
    "the explicit dependence of drift and diffusion terms on the dynamical characteristics of the phase space of the system is demonstrated .",
    "the main conclusions of our study are ;    \\(i ) we analyze the nature of chaotic diffusion in terms of the properties of the phase space of chaotic systems .",
    "the drift and diffusion terms are dependent on the correlation of fluctuations of the linear stability matrix of the equation of motion . since the later is the key point for understanding the stability of motion in a dynamical system , we emphasize that the thermodynamic - like quantities as discussed here have a deeper root in the intrinsic nature of motion of a few - degree - of - freedom system .",
    "\\(ii ) we identify the information entropy flux and production - like terms in the steady state which explicitly reveal their connection to dynamics through drift and diffusion term , in presence and absence of the external force field .",
    "\\(iii ) the connection between the thermodynamically - inspired quantities and chaos are fairly general for the n - degree - of - freedom systems .",
    "the theory developed in this paper is based on the derivation of the fokker - planck equation for chaotic systems pertaining to the processes with correlation time which is short but finite ( i. e. , for the systems with hard chaos ) .",
    "the suitable generalization of the approach to more general cases , where one encounters long correlation time is worthwhile for further investigation in this direction .",
    "b. c. bag is indebted to the council of scientific and industrial research for a fellowship .",
    "we first note that the operator @xmath280 provides the solution of the equation [ eq.([e13 ] ) , @xmath281 @xmath282 @xmath283 signifies the `` unperturbed '' part of @xmath106 which can be found explicitly in terms of characteristic curves .",
    "the equation @xmath284 determines for a fixed @xmath13 a mapping from @xmath285 to @xmath286 , i. e. , @xmath287 with inverse @xmath288 .",
    "the solution of ( [ a1 ] ) is @xmath289   f(x , 0 ) .",

    "we may rewrite `` unperturbed '' eq.([a2 ] ) as @xmath297 here @xmath298 are the functions of @xmath35 with @xmath38 only .",
