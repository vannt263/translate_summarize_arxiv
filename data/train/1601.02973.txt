    "here we discuss basic properties of the andreev - wilson loop operators defined by eqs .",
    "( 2)-(3 ) of the main text .",
    "the goal of this part is to clarify the details of the semiclassical construction schematically drawn on fig.1 in the article .",
    "our starting point is the semiclassical bogoliubov - degennes ( bdg ) equations ( also known as andreev approximation of the bdg equations ) @xmath131 for the spinor @xmath20 of the electron - like excitation and the spinor @xmath21 for a hole - like excitation , with @xmath67 being the superconducting gap ( assumed to be zero in the normal region ) , @xmath26 a magnetic texture which depends on the fermi velocity @xmath132 and position @xmath3 , and @xmath133 the excitation energy . here",
    ", we assume that the system is translational invariant in the transversal direction and therefore @xmath134 , where the velocity @xmath135 is parametrized by the angle between the semiclassical trajectory and the @xmath3-axis perpendicular to the s / n interfaces .",
    "note that the equations correspond to the leading order of the semi - classic expansion of the bdg equations in the presence of any spin texture ( spin splitting field plus spin - orbit coupling ) .",
    "the operator @xmath136 defined in the main text is the spin propagator that connects the values of the electron - like spinor at two different points : @xmath137 . from the bdg equations we find that @xmath136 satisfies the following equations ( in the n - region ) @xmath138 with the boundary condition @xmath139 , and verifies the group property @xmath140 .",
    "the solution to these equations is given by the path - ordered exponential @xmath141 which is the eq.(4 ) of the main text .",
    "the spin propagator for the hole - like spinor is defined similarly as @xmath142 .",
    "it follows from the bdg equations that operators @xmath143 and @xmath33 are related via the time - reversal operation : @xmath144 .",
    "explicitly the path - ordered exponential representation for @xmath145 reads @xmath146 note that @xmath143 can be also obtained from @xmath33 by simply reversing the velocity @xmath147 , which reflects the electron - hole symmetry .    from the spin propagators @xmath143 and @xmath33 we construct the andreev - wilson loop operators [ eqs.(2 ) and ( 3 ) of the main text ] @xmath148 these operators propagate electron - like and hole - like spinors in the particle - hole @xmath36 position space along an andreev loop between the two superconducting electrodes at locations @xmath149 and @xmath150",
    "[ see fig.1 , main text ] .",
    "for example the operator @xmath151 propagates the electron spinor from a point @xmath3 to the right interface at @xmath150 , then the hole spinor from @xmath150 to the left interface at @xmath149 , and finally it transfers the electron spinor from @xmath149 back to the original point @xmath152@xmath3 .",
    "since the above defined andreev - wilson loop operators are @xmath153 rotation matrices we can represent them in the following form @xmath154\\label{eq : w - phi - n-1}\\\\   & = \\cos\\phi+\\mathbf{i}\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\mathfrak{n}}_{e , h}\\left(x\\right)\\boldsymbol{\\cdot\\sigma}\\right)\\sin\\phi\\,,\\label{eq : w - cos - sin}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath78 and @xmath155 are unit vectors . using the group property of the propagators @xmath156 and @xmath157",
    "we find the relation @xmath158 which shows that the parameter @xmath2 is @xmath3-independent and the same for the electron- and hole - like loop operators .",
    "in contrast to that the vectors @xmath78 and @xmath155 are in general different and @xmath3-dependent .",
    "the physical significance of the parametrization is the following . when the expectation values of the electron @xmath159 and hole @xmath160 spin vectors are propagated around the andreev - wilson loops based at the point @xmath3 , they rotate by the angle @xmath2 about the directions of @xmath78 and @xmath155 , respectively .    using and the definitions",
    "- we find the equations of motion for the andreev - wilson loop operators , @xmath161\\label{eq : heisenberg - w}\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] and similarly for @xmath162 : @xmath163\\,.\\ ] ] by substituting the representation into the relation and recalling the property , one gets @xmath164\\ ] ] next , using the identity @xmath165 for @xmath166 and @xmath26 in @xmath167 to evaluate the commutator , we eventually arrive at the following classical equations of precession of the vectors @xmath7 around the effective magnetic field @xmath26 : @xmath168 this corresponds to eq.(6 ) of the main text .    to establish the boundary conditions for eqs .",
    "we evaluate the loop operators - at the interface points @xmath169 @xmath170 these relations imply that @xmath6 at the interfaces with the superconducting electrodes , since @xmath2 is position independent , see . therefore , despite the bogoliubov quasiparticles bouncing back at the s / n interfaces , @xmath171 and transmuting there ( electron - like excitation becomes a hole - like excitation and vice - versa by the andreev reflection ) , the local precession vectors @xmath4 and @xmath5 are equal at the interfaces , hence the propagation of the spinors @xmath20 and @xmath21 can be defined continuously along an andreev loop .",
    "obviously the electron @xmath159 and hole spin vector @xmath160 , also satisfy the precession equations similar to eqs .. hence one naturally expects that the scalar product @xmath172 should be preserved along the loop .",
    "indeed , using the bdg equations and the relation one has @xmath173 here we have used that @xmath165 for @xmath166 and @xmath26 in @xmath167 .",
    "similarly we find that @xmath174 is also space independent .",
    "thus the projection of the expectation value @xmath51 of the electron / hole spin on the local axis @xmath41 remains constant in the course of propagation along the closed andreev trajectory .",
    "in other words , the spin dynamics can be viewed as a precession at a constant latitude about a local axis that itself changes along the trajectories according to eq .. all this confirms the picture illustrated in fig.1 in the main text .",
    "finally we note that , mathematically speaking , the constancy of the projection of the spin vector @xmath51 on the local axis @xmath41 means the existence of an extra integral of motion in the classical spin dynamics .",
    "this additional integral of motion allows to reduce the su(2 ) holonomy ( expected in the spin-1/2 problem ) to an u(1 ) holomony parametrized by a single scalar parameter @xmath2 .",
    "a similar property has been identified by keppeler in the context of semilassical quantization of spinning electrons described by pauli or dirac equations @xcite .",
    "our results in fact show that the closed andreev trajectory can be interpreted as a special case of the generalized invariant torus introduced in refs.@xcite .",
    "the important difference is however that in our case @xmath2 is the holonomy associated to the equations along the path shown in fig.1 ( main text ) mixing electron and hole trajectories .",
    "the non - integrable loop so formed exists in the particle - hole @xmath36 position space .",
    "as discussed above , the andreev - wilson loop operators describe the spin dependency of the bdg bispinor as they move along the normal region .",
    "the loop can not be defined only in the position space since this one is purely 1d along a quasi - classic trajectory , but in the particle - hole @xmath36 position space .",
    "it is clear that without a time - reversal breaking field in the normal region , one has trivial operators @xmath175 and no @xmath2-holonomy .",
    "there is in fact no loop in this case .",
    "so the surface of the loop is described by the amplitude of the time - reversal breaking field ( which gives the difference between @xmath143 and @xmath33 ) and the length of the junction . to recall this subtlety",
    ", we coined @xmath35 the _ andreev_-wilson loop operators .",
    "they are _ not _ wilson loop in the usual sense .",
    "as described in the previous section of this supplemental materials , the andreev - wilson loop operators follow the usual equation of motion for the quantum state , providing we replace the usual time evolution  the schrdinger equation  by the transport equation for the evolution / displacement operator @xmath143 .",
    "an important problem for quantum information is to understand the time evolution of the qubit state .",
    "this evolution is defined as a time - ordered dyson series , which usually require heavy computational power to be calculated , even in a perturbative way .",
    "we have shown in the main text that a josephson junction with magnetic interaction is an analog computer for such complicated mathematical objects .",
    "in fact , the andreev - wilson operator can be completely described by the two parameters @xmath2 and @xmath7 , and one can access these two parameters by measuring the current - phase relation and/or the density of state and the spin polarized density of states , see the main text . extracting @xmath2 and @xmath7 from such measurements , one can measure the result of the dyson equations in an analog fashion .",
    "the josephson devices might be versatile enough , since either the spin - orbit or the spin - splitting interaction could be tuned via external gates voltages , mutual inductances , etc .",
    "in addition , the quantity @xmath176 plays in the spinor propagation of the s / n / s junction the role of the time in the usual schrdinger equation ; @xmath176 can be tuned as well ( though with more difficulties than the magnetic texture itself ) .",
    "note finally that the expression for the quasiclassical green s function ( eqs.(9 - 10 ) of the main text ) is pretty generic : if instead of a spin field , one considers any other lie group structure associated to the generator of the lie algebra @xmath177 , the generator will simply appear by the replacement @xmath178 in the expression for the green function , as long as this algebra will commute with the nambu structure .",
    "in particular , a generalization to the recently proposed su(n ) cold atomic gas is straightforward @xcite .",
    "thus , in certain sense our study is just a first step toward a possible understanding of the complete analogy between the transport of electron spin in coherent structures and the time evolution of complex quantum systems .",
    "in this section , we demonstrate the general expression ( 16 ) of the main text for the spectrum of the andreev bound states when the junction has some barriers .",
    "we first consider the scattering of particles and holes with @xmath10 at a single interface between a normal metal ( left half space ) and a superconductor ( right half space ) .",
    "then we discuss the case of two interfaces in order to get the spectrum of the andreev bound states .",
    "all this analysis is done for a single - channel junction .",
    "notice there are other approaches to avoid discussing pure ballistic transport in josephson junction .",
    "perhaps the simplest one we could think of would be to adopt a diffusive equation approach @xcite .",
    "this is let for future study .",
    "other ways are to add a scattering region in the normal part of the junction @xcite , or to add a barrier in the middle of the junction @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , these approaches are not easy to handle in our case , since one would like to preserve the andreev - wilson loop .",
    "so we adopt the method of adding impurities only at the s / n and n / s interfaces .",
    "let us thus model a finite transparency interface by a potential barrier in the normal region at the distance from the interface @xmath179 smaller than the coherence length .",
    "the reason is due to the impossibility to treat a microscopic barrier in the semi - classic approximation .",
    "one has to add a normal region at the distance @xmath179 where microscopic theory should be prefered , and recover the semi - classic limit at large scale @xmath180 .",
    "the bdg bispinor reads @xmath181 where the slowly varying functions @xmath182 and @xmath183 are the electron and hole spinors for two fermi points labeled by the indexes @xmath184 and @xmath185 .",
    "note that the states @xmath186 and @xmath187 correspond to the right moving quasiparticles ( positive velocity ) , while @xmath188 and @xmath189 describe the left movers ( negative velocity ) .",
    "the barrier in the n - region is parametrized by the transmission @xmath190 and the reflection @xmath191 coefficients , which satisfy the following identities @xmath192 it is convenient to introduce the electron and hole bispinors @xmath193 and the transmission and reflection matrices @xmath194 which satisfy the relations @xmath195 importantly , the barrier scattering is the same for the electrons and holes as this is a fermi surface property related to the fast oscillating parts of the bdg bispinors .",
    "then the scattering relation between the states on the right ( labeled @xmath196 ) and on the left ( labeled @xmath197 ) sides of the barrier can be written as follows .",
    "@xmath198 from these relations we can construct the left - to - right transfer matrix defined as @xmath199 @xmath200 using the matrix identities . therefore the transfer matrix is identified as @xmath201 using eqs.([eq : matrix - ident ] ) and ( [ eq : transfer - matrix ] ) one can check that @xmath202 . therefore the right - to - left transfer is described by @xmath203 that is @xmath204 .",
    "the scattering of the states located between the barrier and the s - region ( the states @xmath205 and @xmath206 in our case ) is the pure andreev scattering at the ideal fully transparent n / s interface @xmath207 where @xmath1 is the sc phase and @xmath208 , see e.g. @xcite .    in the presence of the barrier the generalized andreev scattering from the electrons to the holes on the left - hand - side of the barrier , @xmath209 ,",
    "is composed from the two transfers across the barrier ( forward l - to - r for electrons , and back r - to - l for holes ) and a pure andreev scattering in between : @xmath210 .",
    "this process is described as follows @xmath211 explicitly for the generalized andreev scattering matrix we get @xmath212 the matrix @xmath213 connects the electron and hole states scattered by a non ideal n / s interface modeled by the barrier and an ideal n / s interface . in the following",
    "we will skip the index @xmath197 , since the solutions are now all in the left / normal region , thus we have : @xmath214 as the final step one can construct the interface scattering matrix @xmath215 which connects the right moving incident ( electron and hole in the n region ) states to the left moving reflected ( electron and hole in the n region ) states : @xmath216 the elements of the interface @xmath215 matrix are constructed from eqs.([andreev-3 ] ) by expressing @xmath188 and @xmath189 in terms of @xmath186 and @xmath187 .",
    "the resulting scattering matrix takes the form @xmath217 where we introduced the notations @xmath218 , @xmath219 for the electron and hole normal reflection coefficients and @xmath220 for the andreev ( electron - hole ) reflection coefficient @xmath221 one can verify that @xmath222 , and the interface @xmath215-matrix is unitary @xmath223    it seems to be quite obvious that in the case of an s / n interface ( s on the left , n on the right ) , the same s - matrix ( [ s - result ] ) connects the left moving ( incoming ) states @xmath188 and @xmath189 to the right moving ( reflected ) states @xmath186 and @xmath187 ( the incoming and outgoing are interchanged for s /",
    "n with respect to n / s ) .",
    "in the andreev bound states problem we have two interfaces ( l and r ) with @xmath215-matrices @xmath224 and @xmath225 given by eq.([s - result ] ) where the barrier transmission / reflection and the sc phases are in general different for l and r interfaces .",
    "the propagation between interfaces is diagonal in the electron - hole space ( the same for either left movers and time - conjugated for right movers ) and can be diagonalized locally in the spin space . as a result",
    "the single - valuedness condition ( for the loop starting at the left boundary ) reduces to the following simple form : @xmath226 thus the problem reduces to a simple @xmath227 system ( for each spin projection @xmath54 ) with a very clear physical meaning ",
    "the phase accumulated in the free closed loop propagation should be compensated by the combined scattering on two interfaces .",
    "the matrix in the r.h.s .",
    "is the generalization of our andreev - wilson loop to the case of general interfaces with finite transparency .    to obtain the spectrum of the andreev bound states",
    ", one should thus resolve the condition @xmath228 in order to get non - trivial solution verifying .",
    "after a straightforward calculation of the determinant and some algebra one obtains eq.(16 ) of the main text .",
    "eq.(16 ) is quite generic since it is valid for any interface with all properties encoded in the expressions for @xmath191 and @xmath190 and any spin texture , encoded in the @xmath2-holonomy .",
    "eq.(16 ) thus generalizes many results scattered in the existing literature about single - channel josephson junction , either for the s / n / s or the s / f / s problems .",
