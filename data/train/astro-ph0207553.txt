    "after a long period of experimental work , large erenkov detectors for high energy neutrinos are going to open a new observational window to the sky .",
    "their main goal is to extend the volume of the explored universe by neutrinos , to obtain a complementary view of astronomical objects and to learn about the origin of high energy cosmic rays .",
    "they are the successors of underground neutrino detectors which have turned out to be too small to detect the faint fluxes of neutrinos from cosmic accelerators .",
    "the new detectors are large , expandable arrays of photomultipliers constructed in open water or ice .",
    "the photomultipliers span a three - dimensional coarse grid and map the erenkov light of secondary particles produced in neutrino interactions .",
    "actually , the basic idea for this detection method goes back to the early 60 s @xcite .",
    "pioneering attempts towards its realization have been made in the course of the dumand project @xcite . in 1993 ,",
    "the baikal collaboration @xcite succeeded to built the first deep underwater erenkov neutrino detector , which has been stepwise upgraded to its present stage , nt-200 .",
    "the amanda collaboration @xcite has built a erenkov detector in the south pole ice .",
    "other collaborations ( antares @xcite , nestor @xcite ) are constructing underwater neutrino detectors of similar size .",
    "since a few years , the nemo collaboration @xcite is performing an intensive r&d program aiming at the construction of a km@xmath0 erenkov neutrino telescope in the mediterranean sea .",
    "another cubic kilometer detector , icecube @xcite is planned at the south pole .",
    "the cubic kilometer scale is set by various predictions on the extremely low fluxes of high energy neutrinos expected from astrophysical sources .    in underwater erenkov neutrino telescopes",
    ", water acts not only as a target but also as radiator of erenkov photons produced by relativistic charged particles .",
    "the detection volume , as well as the angular and energy resolutions strongly depend on the water transparency .    the transparency of water as a function of photon wavelength @xmath1 , is described by the so called inherent optical properties , like the coefficients for absorption @xmath2 , for scattering @xmath3 , for attenuation @xmath4 , and by the phase scattering function @xmath5 ( also referred to as volume scattering function ) which represents , for a photon , the probability to be diffused at an angle @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "another parameter commonly used in literature is the effective scattering coefficient @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the average cosine of the phase scattering function at a given @xmath1 .",
    "the optical properties of natural water have to be measured _ in - situ _ in order to allow an unbiased knowledge of light transmission properties in the medium .",
    "the baikal collaboration has been investigating the fresh water deep in lake baikal since 1980 .",
    "the inherent optical properties have been measured with a series of specially designed devices .",
    "it was shown that the water transparency at depths between 900 m and 1200 m is adequate to operate a neutrino telescope .",
    "put into operation at april 6@xmath9 , 1998 , the neutrino telescope nt-200 incorporates a long - term monitoring system which performs continuous measurements of the water parameters .",
    "this information serves as input for monte - carlo simulations of the detector response to atmospheric muons which represent a well - known calibration source for neutrino telescopes .",
    "the muon fluxes measured with nt-200 are in very good agreement with simulation results .",
    "this fact confirms that the custom - made devices and the methods to extract the relevant information on optical parameters yield reliable results .",
    "the nemo collaboration has been investigating oceanographic and optical properties of several deep sea marine sites close to the italian coast , with the aim to select the optimal site for the construction of a km@xmath0 detector in the mediterranean sea .",
    "absorption and attenuation coefficients for light in the wavelength region between 412@xmath10715 nm @xcite have been measured with a set - up based on commercial devices .",
    "optical measurements in deep water are extremely difficult , and possible systematic errors related to these measurements suggest careful cross checks of results by complementary methods . for these reasons , during march - april 2001 , the nemo and baikal collaborations have started a joint campaign to measure the optical properties of deep water in lake baikal using two different devices .",
    "one set - up is based on the transmissometer _",
    "ac9 _ , operated by the nemo group , the other device , _",
    "( absorption , scattering and phase function meter ) , was developed and operated by the baikal collaboration .",
    "the cross check of experimental results has been crucial for both devices , since both have an excellent sensitivity in measuring water optical properties , however , they can be affected by different sources of systematic errors which could deteriorate the absolute accuracy .",
    "the measurements reported in the following sections have been carried out during march - april 2001 , from the ice camp above the neutrino telescope nt-200 .",
    "the _ ac9 _ , manufactured by _ wetlabs _ @xcite , is a transmissometer capable to measure absorption and attenuation coefficients at nine different wavelengths in the range @xmath11 nm . using an accurate calibration procedure ,",
    "the nemo collaboration has achieved an accuracy of about @xmath12 m@xmath13 in @xmath14 and @xmath15 measurements @xcite .     and @xmath16 ) , as functions of depth , obtained by two measurements ( red and black dots ) with the _ ac9_-ctd set - up in lake baikal during march 2001 .",
    "the nt-200 telescope is located between 1100 m and 1170 m depth.,width=302 ]    during the measurements in lake baikal , the _",
    "ac9 _ device and a ctd ( a probe that measures water conductivity , temperature and pressure ) were operated through an electro - mechanical cable . with this set - up",
    "we have obtained two vertical profiles of the water column ( 50 m@xmath17 depth @xmath171100 m ) , collecting about ten data - sets per meter of depth .",
    "each data - set consists of a measurement of temperature and optical properties , @xmath2 and @xmath18 , over the nine wavelengths .    in figure",
    "[ fig : tempacbaikal ] we show , as a function of depth , the water temperature together with the values for absorption and attenuation coefficient at @xmath19 nm measured during the first and the second deployment in lake baikal ( for discussion see section [ sec : results ] ) .",
    "the _ asp-15 _ device ( see figure [ fig : asp-15 ] ) has two receiving channels : one with a wide aperture to measure @xmath14 and @xmath20 and another one with a rotating mirror and a narrow angle collimator to measure the phase scattering function .",
    "two photomultipliers ( type feu-130 ) and 15 interference light filters are assembled in a cylindrical container .",
    "the filters wavelengths are ranged from 369 nm to 691 nm .",
    "both photomultipliers operate in photon counting mode .",
    "two isotropic point - like light sources and two screens are assembled on a frame , which can be moved by a stepping motor over distances ranging from 0.4 to 15 meters with respect to the milk glass window .",
    "measurements were carried out separately for each source and controlled via cable by a computer on shore or at the ice camp .",
    "the device is described in detail in @xcite .",
    "the principle of the @xmath14 measurement with _",
    "_ is described in @xcite .",
    "we measure the dependence of the luminosity @xmath21 on the distance @xmath22 between source and receiver with each of the 15 light filters and approximate the absorption coefficient by    @xmath23    where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the luminosity at distances @xmath26 and @xmath27 , respectively .",
    "monte - carlo simulations @xcite have shown that for an isotropic or a lambertian ( cosine ) light source in water , the difference between approximation ( [ abs ] ) ( which is an exact definition of @xmath14 in a case of a medium without scattering and isotropic point like source ) and the exact value of @xmath14 is less than @xmath28 , provided a strongly anisotropic phase scattering function , low scattering and @xmath29 .",
    "the scattering coefficient @xmath20 is approximated @xcite by    @xmath30    where @xmath31 and @xmath21 are the luminosity at distance @xmath22 from the screened and unscreened source , respectively .",
    "our estimation of the total uncertainties due to approximations ( 1,2 ) and systematic errors is : @xmath32 5% for @xmath33 m@xmath13 and @xmath34 10 % for @xmath35 m@xmath13 . in all figures below ,",
    "only statistical errors are shown for the _ asp-15 _ data .",
    "in this section we discuss the results of light absorption measurements performed with both devices _ ac9 _ and _ asp-15_. in table [ tab : abcoeff200 ] and figure [ fig : ablength200 ] we present respectively the absorption coefficients and absorption lengths ( @xmath36 ) as a function of wavelength .",
    "_ asp-15 _ data have been taken at a depth of 200 m , the _ ac9 _ values are the average of data collected at depths between 180 m and 220 m.    .absorption coefficients measured during two deployments of _ ac9 _ ( march 28@xmath9 ) and during one deployment of _",

    "figure [ fig : scatt1000 ] shows good agreement between results obtained with _ ac9 _ and _ asp-15 _ at 1000 m depth . at 200 m depth ( figure [ fig : scatt200 ] ) there are discrepancies which confirm the different optical properties of the water layers measured by _ ac9 _ and _ asp-15 _ , already indicated by the results of the absorption measurements at the same depth ( see section [ sec : absorption ] ) .    given the strong water currents at shallow depth and inhomogeneous distribution of biologically active substances , a strong variation of optical parameters within one day appears to be realistic .",
