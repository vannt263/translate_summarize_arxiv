    "the thermodynamics of self - gravitating systems is a fascinating subject .",
    "it started with antonov ( 1962 ) s discovery that , when a self - gravitating system is confined within a box of radius @xmath2 , no maximum entropy state can exist below a certain critical energy @xmath3 .",
    "this intriguing result was further discussed by lynden - bell & wood ( 1968 ) who conjectured that for @xmath4 the system would collapse and overheat .",
    "this is called `` gravothermal catastrophe '' or `` antonov instability '' .",
    "lynden - bell & wood have related this phenomenon to the very particular property of self - gravitating systems to possess _ negative _ specific heats .",
    "the gravothermal catastrophe picture has been confirmed by sophisticated numerical simulations ( larson 1970 , cohn 1980 , lynden - bell & eggleton 1980 ) and is expected to play a crucial role in the evolution of globular clusters .",
    "it is found that the collapse proceeds self - similarly ( with power law behaviors ) and that the central density becomes infinite in a finite time .",
    "this instability has been known as `` core collapse '' and many globular clusters have probably experienced core collapse ( binney & tremaine 1987 ) . in the case of dense clusters of compact stars ( neutron stars or stellar mass black holes ) ,",
    "the gravothermal catastrophe can lead to the formation of supermassive black holes of the right size to explain quasars and agns ( shapiro & teukolsky 1995 ) .",
    "statistical mechanics is also relevant for collisionless stellar systems ( e.g. , elliptical galaxies , dark matter , ... ) undergoing a violent relaxation ( lynden - bell 1967 , chavanis _ et al .",
    "_ 1996 , chavanis & sommeria 1998 , chavanis 1998a,2001a ) .",
    "in particular , the inner regions of elliptical galaxies are close to isothermal and this is an important ingredient to understand de vaucouleurs @xmath5 law ( hjorth & madsen 1993 ) .    on a theoretical point of view , the stability of isothermal spheres has been first investigated by katz ( 1978 ) with a very powerful method extending poincar s theory of linear series of equilibrium .",
    "he found that instability sets in precisely at the point of minimum energy .",
    "this stability analysis was reconsidered by padmanabhan ( 1989 ) who studied the sign of the second variations of entropy and reduced the problem of stability to an eigenvalue equation .",
    "this leads to the same stability limit as katz but the method of padmanabhan provides in addition the form of the perturbation that induces instability at the critical point .",
    "it is found that this perturbation presents a `` core - halo '' structure .",
    "the analysis of padmanabhan ( 1989 ) was performed in the microcanonical ensemble in which the energy is fixed .",
    "the microcanonical ensemble is probably the most relevant for studying stellar systems like elliptical galaxies or globular clusters ( binney & tremaine 1987 ) .",
    "indeed , apart from a slow evaporation , these systems can be assumed isolated so the evolution conserves energy @xmath6 and mass @xmath7 .",
    "in addition , from the viewpoint of statistical mechanics , only the microcanonical ensemble is rigorously justified for non extensive systems , as discussed in the review of padmanabhan ( 1990 ) . however , it is always possible to define formally a canonical ensemble or a grand canonical ensemble in which the temperature is fixed instead of the energy . as suggested by de vega _",
    "( 1996a , 1996b ) these ensembles may be suitable for describing the cold interstellar medium where the temperature is imposed by the cosmic background radiation at @xmath8 in the outer parts of galaxies , devoid of any star and heating sources ( pfenninger _ et al .",
    "_ 1994 , pfenninger & combes 1994 ) .",
    "in particular , by working out the statistical mechanics of the self - gravitating gas , de vega _ et al . _",
    "( 1996a , 1996b ) have shown that self - gravity can provide a dynamical mechanism to produce the fractal structure of the interstellar medium .",
    "they used the same approach to explain the fractal structure of the universe ( de vega _ et al .",
    "_ 1998 ) , assuming that galaxies have reached a quasi - thermodynamical equilibrium like in the early work of saslaw & hamilton ( 1984 ) .    for self - gravitating systems",
    ", it is well known that the thermodynamical ensembles do not coincide in the whole range of parameters ( padmanabhan 1990 ) . using toy models ,",
    "lynden - bell & lynden - bell ( 1977 ) and padmanabhan ( 1990 ) demonstrated that the region of negative specific heats allowed in the microcanonical ensemble is replaced by a phase transition in the canonical ensemble .",
    "this phase transition separates a dilute `` gaseous '' phase from a dense `` collapsed '' phase .",
    "since these toy models are not very realistic , the self - gravitating gas was also studied in a meanfield approximation . in this viewpoint ,",
    "an isothermal sphere is stable if and only if it is a local maximum of an appropriate thermodynamical potential ( the entropy in the microcanonical ensemble and the free energy in the canonical ensemble ) . as expected from physical grounds ,",
    "phase transition occurs when the gaseous sphere ceases to be a local maximum of this potential and becomes a saddle point . in this paper",
    ", we investigate the stability of isothermal gaseous spheres in the canonical ensemble by studying the sign of the second variations of the free energy .",
    "our analysis is a direct extension of padmanabhan ( 1989 ) s approach in the microcanonical ensemble .",
    "the two studies therefore provide a unified description of the stability of isothermal spheres in the meanfield approximation in terms of thermodynamical potentials .    for a long time , the thermodynamics of self - gravitating systems was considered exclusively in a meanfield approach ( or with toy models ) .",
    "however , recently , de vega & sanchez ( 2001a , b ) have developed a rigorous statistical mechanics of self - gravitating systems by using field theoretical methods . in particular , they evidenced the existence of a thermodynamic limit in which the number of particles @xmath9 and the volume @xmath10 go to infinity keeping @xmath11 fixed .",
    "this very unusual thermodynamic limit proves to be appropriate to non extensive systems . by using monte carlo simulations and analytical calculations",
    ", they showed that the meanfield approximation correctly describes the thermodynamic limit except near the critical points where a phase transition occurs .",
    "they also _ derived _ the equation of state of a self - gravitating gas instead of assuming it , as is done in the meanfield treatments .",
    "therefore , their work fully justifies the studies of previous authors and specifies their range of validity .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec_thermo ]",
    ", we introduce a meanfield description of the system in the canonical ensemble and show that critical points of free energy @xmath12 at fixed temperature @xmath13 and mass @xmath7 correspond to isothermal spheres like those studied in the context of stellar structure ( chandraskhar 1942 ) .",
    "we show that there is no global maximum of free energy .",
    "there is not even a local maximum of free energy in an unbounded domain : unbounded isothermal spheres have an infinite mass !",
    "we restrict therefore our analysis to the case of self - gravitating systems confined within a spherical box of radius @xmath2 . in this case",
    ", there exists _ local _ maxima of @xmath12 ( metastable states ) if the normalized temperature @xmath14 is less than @xmath15 and the density contrast @xmath16 .",
    "critical points of free energy with density contrast @xmath17 are unstable saddle points . for @xmath18 , there are not even critical points of free energy : in that case , the system is expected to undergo a phase transition and collapse .",
    "this `` isothermal collapse '' is the counterpart of the `` gravothermal catastrophe '' in the microcanonical ensemble ( see figs .",
    "[ gravotherme]-[isocollapse ] ) .    in section [ sec_pad ]",
    ", we study the sign of the second variations of free energy by using the methods of padmanabhan ( 1989 ) introduced in the microcanonical ensemble .",
    "we show analytically that instability sets in precisely at the point of minimum temperature in agreement with the theorem of katz ( 1978 ) .",
    "the perturbation that induces instability at this point is calculated explicitly ; it has _ not _ a `` core - halo '' structure contrary to what happens in the microcanonical ensemble .    in section [ sec_dyn ] , we study jeans type gravitational instability of isothermal gaseous spheres described by navier - stokes equations .",
    "the introduction of a container removes the problems associated with an infinite homogeneous medium and avoids the jeans swindle .",
    "we show analytically the equivalence between dynamical stability and thermodynamical stability and the fact that the stability of isothermal gas spheres does not depend on the viscosity .",
    "this confirms the findings of semelin _",
    "( 2001 ) who used numerical methods or approximations .",
    "we also give a simpler derivation of the geometric hierarchy of scales inducing instability discovered by these authors using sophisticated renormalization group technics ( semelin _ et al .",
    "this provides a more illuminating interpretation of their results .    in section [ sec_frag ] ,",
    "we make speculations about the fragmentation and the fractal structure of an isothermal self - gravitating gas .",
    "we distinguish between the jeans length @xmath19 defined with the mean density and the king s length @xmath20 defined with the central density .",
    "if we fix the jeans length , instability occurs for @xmath21 and is marked by the _ absence _ of critical point of free energy ( i.e. , hydrostatic equilibrium ) above this threshhold . in that case",
    "the system is expected to collapse without fragmenting .",
    "if we fix the king s length ( or core size ) , a first instability occurs for @xmath22 . above this threshold",
    "critical points of free energy _ still _ exist but they are unstable saddle points .",
    "secondary instabilities occur at larger box radii that asymptotically follow a geometric progression @xmath23^{n } l_{k}$ ] .",
    "the density profiles that trigger these high order modes of instability are calculated analytically .",
    "they present more and more oscillations whose zeros also follow a geometric progression @xmath24^{n}r$ ] .",
    "the profile that destabilizes the singular isothermal sphere has an infinite number of nodes !",
    "each oscillation can be interpreted as a ` germ ' in the langage of phase transition and the above picture suggests that the system will fragment into a series of ` clumps ' .",
    "it is expected that these ` clumps ' will evolve by achieving higher and higher density contrasts , and finally fragment in turn into substructures .",
    "this yields a hierarchy of structures fitting one into each other in a self - similar way .",
    "this picture is given further support by the fact that _ both _ the domain sizes inducing instability and the zeros of the perturbation profile in each domain follow a geometric progression with the same ratio .",
    "this double - geometric progression may explain in a natural way the fractal structure of a self - gravitating gas like the interstellar medium and the large scale structures of the universe .",
    "this gives further support to the interpretation of de vega _ et al . _",
    "( 1996a , 1996b , 1998 ) who first realized the importance played by self - gravity in building a fractal distribution of matter .",
    "consider a system of @xmath9 particles , each of mass @xmath25 , interacting via newtonian gravity .",
    "the particles can be galaxies , stars , atoms , etc ... we assume that the system is non rotating and non expanding . let @xmath26 denote the distribution function of the system , i.e. @xmath27 gives the mass of particles whose position and velocity are in the cell @xmath28 at time @xmath29 .",
    "the integral of @xmath30 over the velocity determines the spatial density @xmath31 on the other hand , in the meanfield approximation , the total mass and the total energy of the system can be expressed as @xmath32 @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the kinetic energy and @xmath35 the potential energy .",
    "the gravitational potential @xmath36 is related to the star density by the newton - poisson equation @xmath37 finally , the boltzmann entropy is given by the standard formula @xmath38 which can be obtained by counting the number of microstates corresponding to a given macrostate and taking the logarithm of this number ( ogorodnikov 1965 ) .",
    "we shall work in the canonical ensemble in which the temperature is fixed , allowing the energy to fluctuate . in that case ,",
    "the relevant thermodynamical potential is the massieu function related to the helmholtz free energy @xmath39 by @xmath40 .",
    "hence @xmath41 at equilibrium , the system is expected to be in a state that maximizes the massieu function ( [ j ] ) for a fixed total mass @xmath7 ( in the following we shall call @xmath12 the free energy , although this is only the free energy up to a negative proportionality factor ) .",
    "following padmanabhan ( 1989 ) s procedure , we start to maximize the free energy @xmath12 for a given density field @xmath42 .",
    "this yields the maxwell - boltzmann distribution @xmath43 which is a _",
    "global _ maximum of @xmath12 with the previous constraint . substituting this optimal distribution function in eqs .",
    "( [ e])-([bentropy ] ) , we can express the energy and the entropy in terms of the spatial density in the form @xmath44 @xmath45 we can now determine the variations of @xmath12 around a given density profile @xmath42 . to second order in the expansion",
    "we get @xmath46    introducing a lagrange multiplier @xmath47 to satisfy the conservation of mass , the condition that @xmath12 is an extremum is written ( to first order ) @xmath48 this condition must be satisfied for any variations @xmath49 .",
    "this yields the boltzmann distribution @xmath50 where we have set @xmath51 therefore , the boltzmann distribution ( [ rhob ] ) is a _",
    "critical _ point of free energy .",
    "this does not insure , however , that it is a _",
    "maximum _ of @xmath12 .",
    "it is not even clear that the extremum problem leading to eq .",
    "( [ rhob ] ) has a solution .",
    "indeed , the gravitational potential that appears in eq .",
    "( [ rhob ] ) must be determined self - consistently by solving the mean field equation @xmath52 obtained by substituting the density ( [ rhob ] ) in the poisson equation ( [ poisson ] ) , and relating the lagrange multiplier @xmath53 to the constraint @xmath7 .",
    "as we shall see , this problem does not always have a solution .",
    "when a solution exists , we must consider the sign of the second order variations @xmath54 to determine whether it is a maximum or not .",
    "it is easy to show that there is no global maximum of free energy . to prove this result",
    ", we just need to consider a homogeneous sphere of mass @xmath7 and radius @xmath2 .",
    "the total energy of this sphere is @xmath55 and its free energy @xmath56 from the above formula it is clear that @xmath12 goes to @xmath57 when we spread the density to infinity ( @xmath58 ) or when we contract the system to a point ( @xmath59 ) .",
    "since the mass is conserved in this process no global maximum of free energy can exist .",
    "in addition , there is not even a local maximum of free energy in an unbounded domain : unbounded isothermal spheres have an infinite mass .",
    "for non rotating systems , the equilibrium states are expected to be spherically symmetric . in that case , the boltzmann - poisson equation ( [ mf ] ) can be rewritten @xmath60 this equation has been studied extensively in the context of isothermal gaseous spheres ( chandrasekhar 1942 ) .",
    "we can check by direct substitution that the distribution @xmath61 is an exact solution of eq .",
    "( [ mfr ] ) known as the _ singular isothermal sphere _ ( binney & tremaine 1987 ) . since @xmath62 at large distances , the total mass of the system @xmath63 is infinite !",
    "more generally , we can show that any solution of the meanfield equation ( [ mfr ] ) behaves like the singular sphere as @xmath64 and has therefore an infinite mass ( chandrasekhar 1942 ) .",
    "we shall avoid the infinite mass problem by confining artificially the system within a spherical box of radius @xmath2 .",
    "it is only under this simplifying assumption that a rigorous thermodynamics of self - gravitating systems can be carried out .",
    "physically , the maximum cut - off determines the scale at which other processes intervene to limitate the spatial extent of the system .",
    "it is clear from eq .",
    "( [ jmax ] ) that the introduction of an upper cut - off does not remove the absence of global maximum of free energy ( the system can always increase @xmath12 by collapsing to a point ) .",
    "however , the presence of a wall at radius @xmath2 allows the existence of _ local _ maxima of free energy ( metastable states ) .",
    "the microcanonical and canonical ensembles yield the same critical points , i.e. the critical points of entropy at fixed mass and energy and the critical points of free energy at fixed mass and temperature coincide .",
    "only the onset of instability will differ from one ensemble to the other .",
    "the thermodynamical parameters for bounded isothermal spheres in the meanfield approximation have been calculated by lynden - bell & wood ( 1968 ) and we shall directly use their results .    to that purpose , we introduce the function @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the gravitational potential at @xmath67 .",

    "quite remarkably , we have provided an elegant analytical solution of this more general problem without making any approximation .",

    "the collapse of isothermal gas spheres has been investigated by penston ( 1969 ) using navier - stokes equations ( without viscosity ) .",

    "this only _ partially _ answers the above question .",
    "indeed , his solution is just a particular solution of the fluid equations and other solutions ( e.g. , fragmentation ) may be possible . in particular , it is not clear whether his solution is stable with respect to non spherically symmetric perturbations . in addition , penston ( 1969 ) works in an infinite domain for which the isothermal spheres have infinite mass and are always unstable .",
    "therefore , he could not evidence a phase transition between an equilibrium `` gaseous '' state and a `` collapsed '' state , depending on the value of the temperature .",
    "the thermodynamics of self - gravitating systems is so intriguing that we have been tempted to explore this problem anew from a dynamical point of view ( chavanis _ et al .",

    "we have also checked that the number of oscillations in the perturbation profile increases when we start from unstable isothermal spheres with high density contrasts . with this algorithm ,",
    "we have explored the `` bassin of attraction '' of the stable isothermal spheres .",
    "since they only are _ local _ maxima of entropy or free energy , an initial condition can either relax towards a metastable equilibrium state or collapse , depending on its _",
    "topology_. hence , the control parameter @xmath145 or @xmath144 is not sufficient to characterize completely the final state of the system even in the case when an equilibrium exist .",
    "this depends whether the initial condition lies in the `` bassin of attraction '' of the equilibrium solution or not .",
    "the complete characterization of this bassin of attraction is difficult but we have given some examples . with our numerical algorithm , it will be possible to include rotation in order to compute entropy maxima that are not spherically symmetric and determine the influence of angular momentum conservation on the collapse of a rotating self - gravitating system ( chavanis & rosier , in preparation ) .",
    "some interesting works have been done in that direction ( lagoute & longaretti 1996 , laliena 1999 , fliegans & gross 2001 and lynden - bell 2000 ) but the complete description of rotating isothermal gaseous spheres is still in its infancy stage .",
    "it is also of first interest to test numerically the speculations that we have made concerning the development of the instability , i.e. if the system will collapse as a whole or if it will fragment and break into substructures .",
    "these two regimes are clearly separated , at least in the theoretical model that we have considered here ( antonov model ) . we have suggested that if we start from a solution of the emden equation with a high density contrast , it should break in a series of ` clumps ' associated with the oscillations of the density perturbation that we have calculated in the linear regime . obviously ,",
    "if we want to follow the nonlinear evolution correctly , we must relax the hypothesis of spherical symmetry .    in this paper",
    ", we have assumed that the particles can be treated by classical mechanics and that they are point - like .",
    "the extension of our work to general relativity ( for , e.g. , neutron stars ) is almost straightforward ( chavanis 2001b ) .",
    "we find that there is no hydrostatic equilibrium if the system size is smaller than a multiple of the schwarzschild radius .",
    "we also show analytically that the point of smallest radius corresponds precisely to the point at which the series of equilibrium becomes unstable .",

    ", there can be a `` gravothermal catastrophe '' at @xmath3 but the core ceases to shrink when it becomes degenerate . considering a classical gas with a short distance cut - off",
    "@xmath302 essentially leads to the same results ( see , e.g. , padmanabhan 1990 , follana & laliena 2000 ) .    for astrophysical purposes",
    ", it is still a matter of debate to decide whether collisionless stellar systems like elliptical galaxies are degenerate ( in the sense of lynden - bell ) or not .",
    "since degeneracy can stabilize the system without changing its overall structure at large radii , we have suggested that degeneracy could play a role in galactic nuclei ( chavanis & sommeria 1998 ) .",
    "the recent simulations of leeuwin and athanassoula ( 2000 ) and the theoretical model of stiavelli ( 1998 ) seem to go in that direction : if the nucleus of elliptical galaxies contains a ( primordial ) black hole , degeneracy must be taken into account and can explain the cusps observed in the center of galaxies .",
    "this form of degeneracy is also relevant for massive neutrinos in dark matter models where it competes with quantum degeneracy ( kull _ et al .",
    "_ 1996 ) .",
    "all together , these results suggest that the statistical mechanics and the thermodynamics of self - gravitating systems can have quite relevant astrophysical applications at different scales of the universe : stars ( chandraskhar 1959 ) , interstellar medium ( de vega _ et al .",

    "1998) ... the same ideas of statistical mechanics have been introduced in two - dimensional turbulence to explain the formation and maintenance of coherent vortices , like jupiter s great red spot , which are common features of large - scale geophysical and astrophysical flows ( see bouchet & sommeria 2000 , bouchet _ et al .",
    "_ 2001 and references therein ) .",
    "the analogy between the statistical mechanics of two - dimensional vortices and stellar systems has been described extensively by chavanis ( 1996 , 1998b , 2001c ) .",
    "this analogy concerns not only the equilibrium state ( the formation of large - scale structures ) but also the relaxation towards equilibrium ( chavanis _ et al .",
    "_ 1996 , chavanis 2001d ) and the statistics of fluctuations ( chavanis & sire 2000 ) .",
    "these ideas may also have applications in the context of planet formation where large - scale vortices present in the solar nebula could efficiently trap dust particles to form the planetesimals and the planets ( barge & sommeria 1995 , tanga _ et al .",
