    "although many dwarf galaxies are actively forming stars , detecting molecular gas in these objects has frequently proven difficult . , the brightest and most abundant tracer of molecular hydrogen ,",
    "is generally not seen in dwarfs ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "since stars form out of molecular gas , this lack of  emission is puzzling .",
    "does the faintness of  reflect genuine scarcity of molecular hydrogen ( h@xmath7 ) , or does  become a poor tracer of h@xmath7 in the low metallicity interstellar medium ( ism ) of dwarf galaxies ? several authors have argued for the latter interpretation based on measurements of the virial and dust masses of giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) @xcite .",
    "however , recent high resolution studies of gmc virial masses in nearby galaxies have found little evidence for changes in the -to - h@xmath7 ratio between dwarf and large galaxies or as a function of metallicity @xcite .",
    "these measurements suggest that co remains a good tracer of dense molecular gas down to metallicities of @xmath9 .    molecular gas in dwarf galaxies",
    "is of particular interest because these systems are characterized by lower metallicities , stronger radiation fields , and shallower potential wells than large star - forming galaxies .",
    "these conditions resemble those in the early universe and may affect the properties of gmcs in these objects .",
    "indeed , the gmc mass spectrum appears to vary among local group galaxies @xcite and some data suggest that several nearby galaxies contain clouds that obey a different size - linewidth - luminosity relation than the milky way ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* though differences in resolution leave this matter still open ) .",
    "are such variations common ?",
    "if so , what is their impact on galaxy evolution ?",
    "gmc properties may affect a cloud s star formation rate ( sfr ) or the initial mass function ( imf ) . in this case",
    ", we would expect galaxies with systematically different gmc populations to show different relationships between sf tracers and the molecular gas .    as a step towards resolving these questions , we have carried out a large  survey of 121 nearby , infrared - bright dwarf galaxies .",
    "we detect or marginally detect @xmath10 of these galaxies , a higher success rate than was achieved by previous surveys ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "thus , we find that although  is faint in dwarf galaxies , it is detected when observations reach sufficient sensitivity . combining these data with results from the literature yields a sample of @xmath11 nearby dwarf galaxies with known molecular emission",
    ". this large sample of -emitting dwarfs allows us to investigate how the amount of molecular gas relates to other galaxy properties .",
    "we determine the h@xmath7-to - sfr relation for this sample and compare it to that found in large galaxies .",
    "we also use the sample in conjunction with our nondetections to examine which properties of a galaxy are the best predictors of  emission .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in  2 ,",
    "we describe our survey , including our method for classifying galaxies as detections or nondetections . in  3 , we examine the results of our survey in some detail and discuss what galaxy properties are most closely related to  emission . in  4 , we study the relationship between  and sfr on @xmath12 kpc scales , and in  5 we present our conclusions .",
    "the original goal of this survey was to identify dwarf galaxies with @xmath13co @xmath14 emission suitable for high resolution follow - up with the bima interferometer .",
    "thus , the sample was constructed to maximize the chances of detecting molecular emission .",
    "we considered nearby ( @xmath15 ) , northern ( @xmath16 ) , compact ( optical diameter of @xmath17 ) galaxies from the ngc , ugc , ugca , ic , and ddo catalogs .",
    "we included only galaxies that show signs of ongoing star formation as indicated by iras - detected 60 or 100 @xmath18 m emission .",
    "we observed only dwarf galaxies , which we defined as galaxies with an  linewidth @xmath19 km s@xmath20 . applying the tully - fisher relation to an edge - on galaxy",
    ", this definition of dwarf corresponds to @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ; * ? ? ?",
    "finally , we removed galaxies that appeared tidally disrupted or were obviously interacting with other galaxies . to increase the observing efficiency",
    ", we added @xmath23 galaxies with no iras emission to the target list in otherwise sparsely populated lst ranges .",
    "these criteria produced a set of @xmath24 galaxies .",
    "of these , @xmath0 had no prior published  detections .",
    "these @xmath0 galaxies constitute our sample of targets .",
    "distributions of several key properties of the target galaxies are displayed in figure [ samplefig ] .",
    "the sample consists mostly of late - type spiral and irregular galaxies at distances between 2 and 20 mpc with typical linear diameters @xmath25 kpc and typical dynamical masses @xmath26 m@xmath27 ( where @xmath28 is the inclination - corrected maximum rotation velocity obtained from  observations and taken from the hyperleda catalog and @xmath29 is the optical radius at the 25 mag arcsec@xmath30 isophote assuming the virgocentric - flow corrected hubble flow distances ) .",
    "we observed our sample with the arizona radio observatory ( aro ) 12 m telescope at kitt peak .",
    "this telescope has a @xmath31 half - power beam - width at 115.27 ghz .",
    "we pointed toward the optical center of our galaxies , obtained from the nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) .",
    "the data were acquired over the course of three observing runs ( 2001 february 1 - 7 , 2002 january 21 - 25 , and 2002 may 8 - 16 ) and several nights of remote observing ( 2001 november 27 - 30 , 2001 december 3 , 2002 may 30-june 1 ) . whenever possible , we observed both polarizations with the 1 mhz and 2 mhz filter banks in parallel mode , providing redundant data on each polarization . for several runs",
    "this was not an option due to hardware difficulties , and we used only one set of filter banks .",
    "we observed each source for a minimum of one hour , divided into six - minute integrations ( scans ) .",
    "we allocated more time to sources that showed some indication of emission after the first hour , sources observed during poor weather , and those observed with only one polarization .",
    "the observing mode was usually position switching , with an offset of 2 - 3@xmath32 in azimuth . in no case",
    "did we see evidence of significant emission in the reference position close to the source velocity , except for galactic emission .",
    "every six hours , after sunset , and sunrise , a planet or other strong continuum source was observed to optimize the pointing and focus of the telescope .",
    "the median system temperature taken over all runs was 345 k.    we reduced the spectrum for each six - minute scan in the following manner .",
    "we removed noise spikes and bad channels by flagging all channels with absolute values above the @xmath33 level ( none of our sources were this bright in a single scan ) .",
    "several channels were known to be bad _ a priori _ and we flagged these as well .",
    "we then subtracted a linear baseline from the spectrum and binned it to our final resolution of @xmath34 .",
    "finally , we averaged both polarizations and all scans to produce the final spectrum for each source . in very few ( @xmath35 ) cases this procedure was not sufficient to produce a useful final spectrum , and scans with very poor baselines were either discarded or fit with a higher order polynomial .",
    "we classified each galaxy as `` detected , '' `` marginally detected , '' or `` not detected '' based on the region of the spectrum containing the most statistically significant emission .",
    "we selected this region by applying the following simple algorithm to each of the final spectra .",
    "each channel ( 10  velocity bin ) within half of the  linewidth , @xmath36 , of the systemic velocity was used as the center of a series of spectral windows ranging from 30 to 190 in width ( in 20  increments ) . for each of these spectral windows , we calculated the signal  to  noise ratio of the integrated intensity as    @xmath37    where @xmath38 is the brightness temperature ( intensity ) in the @xmath39th channel within the window",
    ", @xmath40 is the number of spectral channels in the window , and @xmath41 is the root mean square intensity of the spectrum per channel measured in the ( assumed ) signal - free areas outside @xmath42  of the systemic velocity . for each spectrum , we calculated @xmath43 for all of the spectral windows that met the above criteria . with 9 spectral windows ( widths of 3 , 5 , 7 , ... 17 , and 19 channels ) centered on each channel within @xmath44 ( typically @xmath45 ) of the systemic velocity , we examined @xmath46 spectral windows per spectrum .",
    "of these 135 values , we selected the one with the maximum signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "we refer to the snr of this spectral window as the @xmath47 of the spectrum .",
    "we used a monte carlo technique to estimate the false positive rate of this algorithm  i.e. , the probability of randomly generating a @xmath47 higher than a given value from spectra containing only gaussian noise .",
    "we generated a large number of artificial spectra filled with normally distributed values and containing the same number of velocity channels as our real spectra .",
    "we found that our algorithm extracted @xmath47 values of @xmath48 or higher from these artificial spectra @xmath49 of the time , indicating @xmath50 confidence that @xmath51 corresponds to real emission .",
    "based on our monte carlo results , we classified all spectra for which we found a @xmath47 of @xmath48 or higher as `` detections . ''",
    "further , we found that our algorithm extracted a @xmath47 of @xmath52 or higher from the artificial spectra 5% of the time .",
    "we labeled spectra with a @xmath47 higher than @xmath52 but less than @xmath48 `` marginal detections . ''",
    "these thresholds , @xmath52 and @xmath48 , are dependent on the number of independent channels in a spectrum and are therefore specific to our data . given our sample of @xmath0 galaxies , we expect @xmath53 false detection and @xmath54 false marginal detections . in total",
    ", we find @xmath1 detections ( none of which we expect are false ) and @xmath2 marginal detections ( @xmath54 of which we expect are false ) .",
    "note that we omit the marginal detections from the analysis presented in  3 and 4 .",
    "however , we consider the majority of these galaxies likely to be detected in  by future studies .",
    "we also estimated our false negative rate  i.e. , the probability that our algorithm will fail to identify a spectrum known to contain signal as a detection .",
    "we added signal with the median characteristics of our typical detections ( @xmath55 , @xmath56 k ) to an average noise spectrum ( @xmath57 k in a 10  channel ) .",
    "our algorithm recovered this signal as a detection @xmath58 of the time , as a marginal detection @xmath59 of the time , and not at all @xmath60 of the time . under the simplifying assumption that detected",
    "galaxies represent a uniform population , our recovery rate and our @xmath1 detections imply a total population of @xmath61 `` detectable '' galaxies in our sample .",
    "we calculated the integrated intensity of each galaxy in the following manner . for detections and marginal detections we considered the spectral window that produced the maximum signal - to - noise value . when this region was bordered by channels containing emission , we extended the window to include all contiguous channels with positive intensities .",
    "the integrated intensity of the galaxy in  was taken to be the sum over this spectral window , and the quoted error is the statistical uncertainty over the same region . for non - detections , we measured the statistical uncertainty in the integrated intensity over a 120  window ( the  velocity width of a typical nondetection ) centered on the radio lsr velocity of the galaxy .",
    "table [ dettable ] summarizes the survey results .",
    "column ( 1 ) lists the name of the galaxy ; columns ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) give the center position from ned ; column ( 4 ) gives the lsr velocity of the galaxy ( usually derived from the ) ; column ( 5 ) lists the extinction - corrected absolute @xmath5 magnitude of the galaxy , derived as described below ; column ( 6 ) contains the @xmath62 of the fir luminosity of the galaxy ( for galaxies that lack either 60 @xmath18 m or 100 @xmath18 m emission , we do not report @xmath63 ) ; column ( 7 ) gives the 1.4 ghz flux associated with the central  pointing ; column ( 8) lists the inclination - corrected rotation velocity of the galaxy ; column ( 9 ) gives the integrated intensity corrected for the main beam efficiency ( @xmath64 ) derived from the  spectrum , along with @xmath65 error bars ( for detected galaxies ) , or a @xmath66 upper limit ( for nondetections ) ; finally , column ( 10 ) indicates whether we detected  in that galaxy  `` y '' for yes , `` n '' for no , and `` m '' indicates a marginal detection . figure [ detfig ]",
    "shows the spectra of detections and marginal detections , with the selected spectral window shaded . the optical- and radio - derived systemic velocities",
    "are shown as vertical lines and the horizontal lines show the rms noise derived from the signal - free regions of the spectrum . beneath the spectrum the  velocity width , @xmath36 , is indicated by a dark bar . for the convenience of the reader ,",
    "we note the following conversion factors : at 115 ghz with a @xmath67 ( half power ) beam , 1  corresponds to a flux of 32.9 jy . assuming a galactic -to - h@xmath7 conversion factor ( @xmath68 , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , this flux is equivalent to a molecular surface density of 4.4 @xmath69 m@xmath27 pc@xmath30 ( including helium ) , where @xmath39 is the inclination of the galaxy in question .",
    "we shall consider variations in the conversion factor in  4 .      to create a dataset that could be used to relate  to other galaxy properties , we supplemented our survey with data from the literature .",
    "the  data came from four sources : the observations and compilation of @xcite ( using the aro 12 m telescope ) , the fcrao extragalactic  survey ( * ? ? ? * using the fcrao 14 m telescope ) , the survey of late - type spirals by @xcite ( using the iram 30 m telescope ) , and the survey of @xcite ( using the sest 15 m telescope and the onsala 20 m telescope ) .",
    "we refer to this set of additional  observations as the `` supplemental sample . ''",
    "note that the supplemental sample , in particular the fcrao survey but also the other surveys , contains a number of galaxies that do not meet our definition of dwarf galaxy ( i.e. , for which @xmath70 ) .",
    "these galaxies make up the sample of large galaxies used for comparison in  3 and  4 .",
    "we pared the literature sample slightly , removing galaxies with hubble types earlier than s0 and galaxies with inferred molecular masses greater than their dynamical masses .",
    "we consider either the molecular mass or the supplementary galaxy properties of such galaxies unreliable .",
    "we obtained systemic and rotational velocities , optical magnitudes , 21-cm fluxes , inclinations , diameters , and hubble types from the hyperleda catalog .",
    "to these data , we added 1.4 ghz radio continuum measurements ( rc ) , far infrared ( fir ) fluxes , and @xmath4-band magnitudes from other sources .",
    "the rc measurements are measured from the nrao vla sky survey ( nvss ) images @xcite , which have a resolution of @xmath71 ( well matched to the @xmath67 12 m beam ) and a sensitivity of @xmath72 mjy beam@xmath20 . for each galaxy we calculated the rc flux integrated over the entire disk of the galaxy , which is used as a global property in  3 .",
    "we also calculated the rc flux associated with the  observation from the nvss convolved to the resolution of that  observation ( when possible ) for use in  4 .",
    "we computed the fir flux @xcite ,    @xmath73 \\times 10^{-14 } \\mbox { w m}^{-2 } \\mbox{,}\\ ] ]    using iras 60 and 100 @xmath18 m flux densities ( in janskys ) from the iras faint source catalog @xcite .",
    "@xmath74 approximates the flux in a bandpass with uniform response 80 @xmath18 m wide centered at 82.5 @xmath18 m . since thermal emission from a galaxy usually peaks between 50 and 100 @xmath18 m , @xmath74 is a good indicator of its total infrared flux ( usually about 50% , see * ? ? ?",
    "the @xmath5-band measurements used in this paper begin as apparent , uncorrected @xmath5 magnitudes from the hyperleda catalog .",
    "we correct for internal extinction following @xcite , and for galactic extinction using @xcite .",
    "we use the virgocentric - flow corrected hubble flow distance with @xmath75 mpc@xmath20 @xcite .",
    "one galaxy in our sample , ngc  4396 , has a negative distance using this method and we assigned it a distance of 20 mpc ( under the assumption that it is a member of virgo cluster ) .",
    "we took @xmath4-band measurements from the 2mass extended source catalog ( xsc ) @xcite .",
    "we used the magnitudes obtained by extrapolating the surface brightness profile to the extrapolated k - band radius of the galaxy ( @xmath76 in the 2mass xsc ) because they better recover the extended flux of low surface brightness objects .",
    "in several cases the extrapolated k - band radius of the galaxy was smaller than @xmath77 , which prompted us to discard the @xmath4-band magnitude for that galaxy as unreliable .",
    "in this section we examine the relationship between  emission and other galaxy properties .",
    "we find that the strongest correlations are between the  and the fir , rc , @xmath4-band , and @xmath5-band luminosities .",
    "the correlation between , fir , and rc presumably results from the well established association between molecular gas and star formation , but the strong correlation between  and stellar light is somewhat surprising .",
    "it suggests that dwarf galaxies are small versions of large galaxies and that differences in the content among galaxies are primarily a result of scaling  a galaxy s mass seems to be the main factor in setting its molecular gas content .",
    "we argue below that this strong correlation between molecular gas content and stellar luminosity arises from the crucial role played by the gravity of the stars in setting the midplane gas pressure and thus the local density of atomic gas  which governs the rate of h@xmath7 formation .",
    "we estimate the strength of the relationship between  content and other galaxy properties using the rank correlation coefficient .",
    "the magnitude of the rank correlation coefficient gives a robust , unbiased measure of how strongly two variables are correlated but no indication of the specifics of that relationship beyond the sense ( obtained from the sign ) .",
    "it is calculated in a manner analogous to the linear correlation coefficient , but it uses the rank of a data point within the sorted data in place of the actual value of the data point ( for more details see * ? ? ?",
    "the rank correlation coefficient can therefore be used to distinguish whether an association exists between two galaxy properties , but contains no information on the physics of that association . to estimate the uncertainties in the coefficients we use bootstrapping methods .",
    "we create an uncorrelated dataset out of our data by randomly pairing @xmath78 and @xmath79 data values , and then we calculate the @xmath65 deviation of the rank correlation coefficient around zero from many repetitions of the experiment .    throughout this discussion",
    "we refer to the molecular mass , @xmath80 , rather than the observable @xmath3 , as the molecular mass is the physical quantity of interest .",
    "we calculate @xmath80 by applying a galactic co - to - h@xmath7 conversion factor ( @xmath81 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to the  luminosity . to accurately account for the mass associated with molecular gas",
    ", we apply an additional factor of 1.36 to include the effect of helium ( see the discussion in  4 for more details ) .",
    "note that even if @xmath82 varies from galaxy to galaxy ( see  4.3 for more discussion of this issue ) , our results will still hold for the relationship between @xmath3 and other galaxy properties .    in some cases drawn from the literature , there are observations of several fields in one galaxy . in these cases , we sum all of the emission from the galaxy to derive @xmath80 .",
    "we removed galaxies with angular sizes greater than @xmath83 but without observations of multiple fields from the analysis because we considered the  in the central @xmath84 an unreliable predictor of the total @xmath3 .",
    "although @xmath80 is strictly a lower limit ( because our observations cover only the central few kpc of each galaxy ) , it is likely that in dwarf galaxies the central @xmath85  kpc ( diameter ) encompassed by our survey beam contains most of the co emission .",
    "the detections taken from the literature are , on average , farther away and therefore do an even better job of including most of the emission .",
    "what properties of a galaxy are most important in setting its content ?",
    "are the same properties relevant in both dwarfs and large spirals ?",
    "how much of the difference in the molecular gas content between dwarfs and large spirals is a result of simple scaling with galaxy size or mass ? in table [ corrtab ] we present the answers to some of these questions by showing rank correlation coefficients between  content  both normalized and total  and other galaxy properties .",
    "the values shown make use of _ all _ galaxies in our sample  large spirals and dwarfs . by including both types of galaxies",
    "we significantly extend the dynamic range over which we look for variation ( e.g. , see figure [ cotolkvssize ] ) .",
    "typical @xmath65 uncertainties in the rank correlation coefficients are @xmath86 and only values with greater than @xmath66 significance are shown in the table ; other entries are left blank .",
    "we also indicate in table [ corrtab ] whether two quantities are significantly correlated within the sample of dwarfs alone .",
    "entries in boldface indicate that the two quantities are correlated at @xmath66 significance or greater in the subset of dwarf galaxies .",
    "typical uncertainties in the rank correlation coefficients among the dwarfs are @xmath87 , so that boldfaced entries have rank correlation coefficients @xmath88 within the dwarf subset alone ( and none exceed @xmath89 ) . in only one case , the correlation between @xmath90 and @xmath91 , do two quantities correlate significantly within the dwarfs but not in the larger sample .",
    "the second column in table [ corrtab ] shows that @xmath80 is correlated with a number of other galaxy properties at a very high significance  including hubble type , dynamical mass , @xmath4-band luminosity , @xmath5-band luminosity , fir luminosity , rc luminosity , linear diameter , and atomic hydrogen content .",
    "figure [ covssize ] illustrates several of these correlations graphically , with dwarf galaxies plotted as black circles and large galaxies as gray circles .",
    "all of the correlations are in the same sense , namely that more massive galaxies with earlier hubble types and redder colors have more molecular gas . in order to investigate the question of whether dwarf galaxies are merely smaller version of large spirals",
    ", we must look past scaling effects and examine how the _ normalized _ co content of a galaxy changes with its other properties .",
    "columns ( 3 ) through ( 5 ) of table [ corrtab ] show that many of the strong correlations between co content and other galaxy properties are removed when the co content is normalized by the stellar or dynamical mass of the galaxy .",
    "in particular the quantity @xmath92 ( column 3 ) shows very little systematic variation with other galaxy properties ( also see figure [ cotolkvssize ] ) .",
    "the median @xmath80/@xmath6 is @xmath93 for large spirals and @xmath94 for dwarf galaxies , identical within the uncertainties  figure [ cotolkvssize ] shows this constancy .",
    "we find that similar results are achieved when normalizing @xmath80 by the dynamical mass , @xmath95 ( see column 4 of table [ corrtab ] )  @xmath96 for large spirals and @xmath97 for dwarfs , again virtually identical .",
    "the difference in @xmath80/@xmath98 , which is @xmath99 for large spirals and @xmath100 for dwarf galaxies , is also not significant .",
    "the weak , but significant , correlations between @xmath80/@xmath98 and @xmath6 , @xmath101 , @xmath102 , and @xmath103 may reflect the fact that large galaxies tend to have redder stellar populations than small galaxies . also note that , although we apply an extinction correction to the @xmath5-band luminosity that varies with galaxy size @xcite , extinction effects may still be important .",
    "these same results hold for a sample consisting of only dwarf galaxies .",
    "@xmath80 in dwarfs correlates strongly with @xmath6 , @xmath98 , and linear diameter . as in the larger sample ,",
    "the @xmath66 correlations found within the dwarf galaxies disappear if the content is normalized by galaxy ( stellar ) mass .",
    "thus we find little evidence for systematic variations in the quantities @xmath92 , @xmath104 , and @xmath105 with galaxy mass .",
    "this suggests that dwarf galaxies are indeed `` small versions '' of large galaxies and that differences in the  content among galaxies are primarily a result of scaling  a galaxy s mass seems to be the main factor in setting its molecular gas content and ( stellar ) mass alone can explain most of the correlations seen in column ( 2 ) of table [ corrtab ] .",
    "the ratio of molecular to atomic gas , on the other hand , _ is _ a strong function of other galaxy properties .",
    "table [ corrtab ] and figure [ molfracvssize ] show the well - established trend of decreasing @xmath91 with later hubble type and decreasing galaxy mass ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "the dwarf galaxies in our sample tend to be low mass systems with late hubble types and therefore have lower @xmath91 than large spirals  @xmath106 compared to @xmath107 .",
    "although dwarf galaxies tend to have roughly the same amount of molecular gas per unit stellar mass , their isms are dominated by large reservoirs of atomic gas and the molecular gas makes up only a small fraction of the total gas mass .",
    "co and fir emission trace the amount of molecular gas and ongoing star formation , respectively .",
    "therefore the quantity @xmath108 is a proxy for the depletion time , the time it will take for a galaxy to consume its reservoir of molecular gas at its present rate of star formation . columns ( 7 ) and ( 8) of table [ corrtab ] and figure [ sfevssize ] show that @xmath109 varies systematically with galaxy mass .",
    "figure [ sfevssize ] shows that there is an anticorrelation between galaxy mass and the depletion time within our sample of dwarfs .",
    "figure [ sfevssize ] also shows that there is a positive correlation between mass and depletion time for large galaxies .",
    "this latter result has been noted previously in a careful study of face - on undisturbed galaxies by @xcite .",
    "she found that galaxies with diameters of @xmath110 kpc had the longest depletion times in her sample ( which did not include dwarfs ) , and that the depletion times in larger galaxies increased with increasing diameter .",
    "here we find that below masses of @xmath111 and diameters of @xmath112 kpc the depletion time tends to rise with decreasing galaxy mass / size , so that galaxies with masses of @xmath113 seem to be maximally efficient at turning molecular gas into stars .",
    "later in this paper , we find that molecular gas depletion time decreases with increasing surface density of molecular gas .",
    "that is , the higher the surface density of molecular gas the more quickly it will be consumed by star formation .",
    "we suggest that this effect drives the behavior in the dwarfs shown figure [ sfevssize ] .",
    "galaxies of @xmath111 have higher average surface densities of molecular gas than do smaller galaxies and therefore they display slightly lower depletion times ( i.e. higher star formation efficiencies ) .    based on our examination of the normalized molecular gas content we find that the amount of molecular gas per unit stellar mass or dynamical mass is roughly constant across more than two orders of magnitude in galaxy mass . over this same range ,",
    "the molecular gas depletion time does vary , but not particularly strongly . on the other hand ,",
    "smaller galaxies tend to be _ much _ richer in atomic gas than large galaxies and therefore have much smaller fractions of their total gas mass in molecular form than large galaxies .",
    "these results suggest that the dwarf galaxies in our sample do look very much like scaled down versions of large galaxies , with the major difference being the presence of a reservoir of atomic gas in smaller systems  gas that is apparently irrelevant to star formation .",
    "table [ slopetab ] shows the power law exponents derived from fits of @xmath80 to several galaxy mass and star formation tracers . that the slopes are all very close to unity reinforces the conclusion that variations in @xmath80 may be just the result of mass scaling .      the strongest correlations in our sample ( both considering the dwarfs alone and the combined set of dwarfs and large spirals ) are between the molecular gas content , @xmath80 , the @xmath4-band luminosity , @xmath6 , the @xmath5-band luminosity , @xmath98 , and the fir luminosity , @xmath63 , of galaxies . the correlation between @xmath80 and @xmath63",
    "is well known in large spiral galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : @xmath63 is dust - reprocessed light from young stars , which have recently formed out of the molecular gas .",
    "the relationship between @xmath80 and the @xmath4-band luminosity ( dominated by k - giants and other old stars  a proxy for the total stellar mass of a galaxy ) , is more puzzling .",
    "a power law fit of @xmath80 to @xmath6 predicts the  content of a dwarf with less scatter ( @xmath114 dex ) than a similar fit to @xmath98 ( @xmath115 dex ) or @xmath95 ( @xmath116 dex ) .",
    "further , the slope of the best fit power law is nearly unity @xmath117 and normalization by @xmath6 removes almost all correlation between @xmath80 and other galaxy properties  unlike normalization by @xmath98 , which leaves weak but significant correlation with @xmath6 ( see tables [ corrtab ] and [ slopetab ] ) .    why should the correlation between molecular gas content and the mass of old disk stars be as strong as that between molecular gas content and the light of the young stars that form directly out of that gas ? further",
    ", why should the correlation between molecular gas content and the old disk stars be so much stronger than that between the molecular gas mass and the mass of the atomic gas from which it forms ?",
    "we suggest that this correlation arises because the hydrostatic pressure in the galactic disk regulates the rate at which h@xmath7 forms out of , and that the stellar surface density drives the midplane hydrostatic pressure .",
    "recently , @xcite and @xcite suggested that the hydrostatic gas pressure plays a dominant role in setting the ratio of atomic to molecular gas in disk galaxies .",
    "they show that the midplane hydrostatic gas pressure , @xmath118 , in a stellar - dominated galactic disk can be written :    @xmath119    where @xmath120 is the surface density of gas in the disk , @xmath121 is the gas velocity dispersion , @xmath122 is the surface density of the stars , and @xmath123 is the stellar scale height . there is good evidence that @xmath121 and @xmath123 are nearly constant within and among disk galaxies and that radial variations in the surface density of atomic gas , @xmath124 , are small compared to radial variations in @xmath122 ( see references in * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , in the atomic - dominated regions of large disk galaxies , the portions of these galaxies most similar to the dwarf galaxies in this paper , the dominant variable setting the midplane gas pressure is @xmath122 .",
    "indeed , in a sample of spiral galaxies , @xcite found that the transition from a molecule - dominated ism to an atomic - dominated ism comes at a nearly constant stellar surface density , @xmath125 m@xmath27 pc@xmath30 .",
    "if @xmath118 is set largely by @xmath122 and the molecular gas abundance is determined by @xmath118 , this would explain the good correlation between @xmath80 and @xmath6 within our sample .",
    "why should @xmath118 control the conversion of  into h@xmath7 ?",
    "the gas pressure is given by @xmath126 , so in a medium with constant velocity dispersion , @xmath121 , @xmath118 is directly proportional to the local gas density , @xmath127 .",
    "the local gas density sets the rate of h@xmath7 formation , with formation @xmath128 @xcite . in practice ,",
    "the equilibrium abundance of h@xmath7 may depend more weakly on the local gas density , because the strength of the dissociating radiation field is likely to be higher in regions of high gas density .    indeed",
    ", several observations suggest that lower @xmath4-band luminosities of dwarf galaxies should correspond to lower average gas densities .",
    "the average  surface density in the centers of dwarf galaxies correlates well with their central stellar surface brightness @xcite , and the central stellar surface brightness increases with increasing luminosity ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . therefore we expect higher gas surface densities , @xmath120 , in higher luminosity systems . furthermore , shallower stellar potentials yield larger gas scale heights , @xmath129 , which translate into a further decrease in the mean gas density @xmath130 . despite their large reservoirs of atomic gas ,",
    "smaller galaxies with less developed disks and shallower stellar potential wells lack the gas densities necessary to efficiently convert  into h@xmath7 .",
    "thus , we suggest that the link between the @xmath4-band luminosity and the molecular gas mass @xmath80 is the hydrostatic gas pressure , or equivalently the local gas density . because higher @xmath4-band luminosities correspond to larger stellar surface densities , higher values of @xmath6 lead to larger midplane pressures and correspondingly higher gas densities , making the @xmath131h@xmath7 conversion more efficient .",
    "this effect translates into a greater abundance of molecular gas in more luminous @xmath4-band galaxies , resulting in more star formation ( see  4 for a discussion of the relationship between  and star formation ) and the young , massive stars thus produced will fuel the fir luminosity of the galaxy .    while consistent with our data , this picture is not the only possible interpretation .",
    "an alternative conclusion might be that in dwarf galaxies ( or actively star forming galaxies ) the @xmath4-band light is a good tracer of the star formation rate .",
    "for instance , @xcite , in a near - ir study of m  33 ( a galaxy that is intermediate between our dwarfs and the large spirals ) found that ob stars may affect the near - ir emission of a galaxy by as much as @xmath132 .",
    "two observations lead us to prefer the stellar potential well explanation offered above .",
    "first , the @xmath4-band light appears to be a better predictor of  content than the @xmath5-band light , which should be even more sensitive to the population of young stars than the @xmath4-band light .",
    "second , the ratio of @xmath92 remains constant across a range of morphologies ( see figure [ cotolkvssize]c ) and stellar populations  in earlier - type galaxies the @xmath4-band light is certainly not dominated by young stars and @xmath92 seems to be constant among these systems and late - type , lower mass dwarfs .",
    "this suggests that @xmath6 traces an older stellar population throughout our sample .      how does this picture mesh with the properties of our nondections ?",
    "here we restrict our investigation to our survey , a well defined sample including detections and nondetections .",
    "we looked for statistical differences between selected properties of galaxies classified as detections and those of nondetections .",
    "table [ medtab ] gives median values for nondetections and detections for each property and table [ difftab ] summarizes the significance of these differences .",
    "figures [ comphist1 ] and [ comphist2 ] show the populations of detections and nondetections for a number of properties of interest .",
    "we calculated the significance of the differences in table [ medtab ] in the following manner . for each property , we used two statistics to test the hypothesis that the samples of detected and nondetected galaxies were drawn from the same parent population .",
    "first , we used a two - sided kolmogorov - smirnov ( ks ) test , which considers the maximum difference between the cumulative probability distributions of the two populations .",
    "second , we applied the student s @xmath133 test , which considers the difference between the means of the two distributions . to estimate the significance of the results we used a monte carlo approach , where we applied the tests to randomly selected subsamples of the observed galaxies .",
    "significant measures of the differences between detected and nondetected galaxies are those that are unlikely to be obtained from randomly selected subsamples .",
    "the numbers listed in table [ difftab ] are the fraction of randomly generated pairs of populations that produce a greater ( more significant ) difference than we observe between the detected and nondetected galaxies under the ks and student s @xmath133 test , so that very small numbers indicate very significant differences between the detections and nondetections for that property .",
    "table [ difftab ] shows that , not surprisingly , the distributions of most of the galaxy properties seen to be strongly correlated to in table [ corrtab ] also differ quite significantly between detections and nondetections  the most notable exception being the linear diameter , which fails to distinguish between detections and nondetections .",
    "the populations of absolute k magnitudes and absolute b magnitudes differ between the detections and nondetections at greater than @xmath134 significance in the sense that brighter galaxies are more likely to be  detections .",
    "our two tracers of global star formation rate , fir luminosity and radio continuum luminosity , show the same trend  higher sfr increases the chances of detecting co ( although this effect is of only marginal significance for @xmath135 ) . as in table",
    "[ corrtab ] , the total  mass associated with the system seems to be a relatively poor indicator of content .",
    "nondetections and detections have approximately the same amount of atomic hydrogen , so that the nondetections are , in fact , more gas rich ( measured by @xmath136 ) than the detections .",
    "thus , the picture outlined in the previous subsection appears to apply to the  nondetections in our survey .",
    "galaxies with low stellar masses ( traced by the @xmath4-band and @xmath5-band luminosities ) tend to be nondetections even though they have comparable reservoirs of atomic gas to the  detections .",
    "we suggest that this is because the lower surface density in the stellar disks of the nondetections leads to a more diffuse , low - pressure distribution of atomic gas , one that is consequently less suitable for converting atomic gas into molecular gas .",
    "there is considerable latitude within the classification of a galaxy as a `` dwarf , '' so here we paint a rough picture of the types of galaxies that we detect in our survey and the types of galaxies that remain beyond our detection limits .",
    "our detections tend to be dwarf spirals similar in luminosity and mass to the lmc , though typically richer in  and forming stars somewhat less vigorously .",
    "their median dynamical mass and b - magnitudes ( @xmath137 m@xmath27 and @xmath138 ) are comparable to those of the lmc ( which has @xmath139 m@xmath27 and @xmath140 ; * ? ? ?",
    "most of our detections an order of magnitude greater  luminosity than the lmc ( @xmath141 k km s@xmath20 pc@xmath142 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) within our @xmath85  kpc beam .",
    "although most of the  emission in the lmc is concentrated within a @xmath12 kpc area , this area is not at the optical center of the galaxy .",
    "therefore this luminosity is actually an upper limit to what we would expect to detect if an lmc analog were included in our sample , and about a fifth of detected galaxies show  luminosities similar to or less than this value . assuming a galactic co - to - h@xmath7 conversion factor , the median co mass for a detection is @xmath143 m@xmath27 , about 10% of the median  mass .",
    "this molecular fraction is about order of magnitude lower than what is typical in large spirals .",
    "most of our galaxies have earlier hubble types ( median sc ) than the lmc ( sm ) .",
    "the median fir luminosity of a detection is @xmath144 , about half that of the lmc .",
    "the nondetections are typically less massive and less luminous than the detections and have later hubble types .",
    "both their median dynamical mass and their median optical luminosity ( @xmath145 and @xmath146 ) are similar to that of the smc ( @xmath147 m@xmath27 @xcite and @xmath148 ) and the local group galaxy ic  10 ( @xmath149 ) .",
    "the median fir luminosity of a nondetection is @xmath150 , which is several times higher than that of the smc ( @xmath151 ) or ic  10 ( @xmath152 * ? ? ?",
    "this should not be surprising , since we required a galaxy to be detected by iras in order to be included in our sample .",
    "the galaxies that we do not detect , then , are dwarf irregulars with stellar masses similar to the smc though with significantly more vigorous star formation .",
    "thus , the molecular gas in very primitive systems , the distant cousins to the smc , remains tantalizingly out of reach .",
    "@xcite found a  luminosity of @xmath153 k km@xmath20 pc@xmath142 for the smc ( though they did not survey the entire galaxy ) .",
    "if all of this gas were concentrated within the 12 m beam , it would yield an intensity ( averaged over the beam ) of @xmath154 k km s@xmath20 at 1 mpc , slightly lower than the median intensity of one of our detections ( @xmath155 k km s@xmath20 ) . at the distance of our nearest nondetection ( 2.2 mpc ) , the smc drops to @xmath156 k km",

    "affect the emission from a galaxy ?",
    "dust helps to shield the gas from dissociating uv radiation and is believed to provide the sites for h@xmath7 formation .",
    "variations in either the size distribution or temperature of the dust in a galaxy might have an important effect on the molecular gas content of that galaxy , especially since the range of temperatures at which molecular gas can form on dust grains may be quite small .",
    "using the iras measurements at 12 , 25 , 60 , and 100 @xmath18 m we looked for systematic variations in the fir colors of our galaxies that might be correlated with molecular gas content .",
    "galaxies detected in  are also detected by iras at 12@xmath18 m and 25@xmath18 m at a much higher rate than  nondetections ( 2 of the 74 nondetected galaxies have associated iras 12@xmath18 m emission and only 11 are detected at 25@xmath18 m ; by comparison , 10 of the 28 detected galaxies show 12@xmath18 m emission and 11 show 25@xmath18 m emission ) .",
    "it is tempting to interpret this comparative lack of 12@xmath18 m emission among the nondetected galaxies as arising from a preferential depletion of small grains analogous to that seen in the smc @xcite .",
    "however , the upper limits associated with the 12@xmath18 m emission in the  nondetections are high enough that these galaxies could have the same @xmath159/@xmath160 ratio as the detections and still not appear in the 12 @xmath18 m catalog .",
    "thus a deficiency of small grains is not ruled out , but there is no strong evidence for it .",
    "in addition ,  nondetections in which 25 @xmath18 m emission is seen have the same median @xmath161/@xmath160 ratio as the  detections ( @xmath162 ) .",
    "the @xmath163/@xmath160 ratio , an indicator of the temperature of dust in these galaxies , also shows no significant variation between detections and nondetections ( @xmath163/@xmath164 for nondetected galaxies and @xmath165 for detected galaxies ) .",
    "further , column ( 2 ) in table [ corrtab ] shows that there is no significant correlation between fir color and total molecular gas content . within the combined sample of dwarfs and large spirals , @xmath163/@xmath160 _",
    "does _ correlate with the normalized molecular gas content of a galaxy .",
    "galaxies with higher @xmath163/@xmath160 ratio tend to have more molecular gas per unit mass / luminosity than less `` infrared - blue '' galaxies .",
    "columns ( 7 ) and ( 8) also show that such galaxies also have shorter depletion times .",
    "this is a result of the fact that @xmath163/@xmath160 is an excellent predictor of @xmath63 for a given @xmath6 ( or other mass indicator )  @xmath163/@xmath160 and @xmath166 are correlated at @xmath167 , hardly surprising given the definition of @xmath63 ( see equation [ firdef ] ) . since there is not even a suggestion of these trends within the dwarf population alone , the usefulness of the far infrared color as a predictor of co emission _ within dwarfs _ appears to be negligible .",
    "if a trend is present , the scatter among galaxies is too large for it to be useful .",
    "it has long been thought that the abundance of heavy elements in a galaxy may be closely linked to its  emission @xcite .",
    "here we look for such an effect in our sample .",
    "however , the number of well - determined metallicities for dwarf galaxies remains small .",
    "fortunately , within galaxies which do have known metallicities there is a strong correlation between the @xmath5-band luminosity of a dwarf galaxy and its metallicity @xcite .",
    "in fact , in dwarf irregulars the @xmath5-band luminosity is a better predictor of metallicity than the central surface brightness ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "the fit ,    @xmath168    is derived from local group dwarf irregulars @xcite but also describes sculptor group dwarf irregulars well @xcite and the slope agrees within the uncertainties with that found for dwarf galaxies using the best quality data in the 2df galaxy redshift survey @xcite . for luminosities fainter than @xmath169 there is significant scatter , usually towards higher than predicted abundances , but only a few of our galaxies  all nondetections  are this faint .",
    "figure [ zfig ] shows that there is significant difference in the @xmath5-band derived metallicities of the detections and nondetections in our survey . above @xmath170 , 21 of the 52 galaxies in our sample",
    "are detected ( a further 3 are marginally detected ) .",
    "below that value only 6 of the 62 galaxies were detected ( and 9 are marginally detected ) .",
    "this drop in detection rate is difficult to conclusively attribute to metallicity effects .",
    "metallicity is strongly correlated with other galaxy properties  indeed , we are using b magnitude as a proxy for metallicity here  and it is not clear whether a drop in detection rates at low metallicities is caused by lower metallicities or by the effects of other parameters that are covariant with metallicity .",
    "regardless , we do find agreement with @xcite who found that detections of galaxies with metallicities of @xmath171 or less are quite rare .",
    "it remains to be determined whether this is simply because such systems have less molecular mass or because they form less  per unit molecular mass .",
    "we have already seen ( in table [ corrtab ] and the previous section ) that there is a strong association between molecular gas and star formation  traced by fir and rc emission  in our sample . here",
    "we investigate whether that association is the same in dwarf galaxies and large spiral galaxies .",
    "specifically , we ask : do dwarf galaxies differ from large spiral galaxies in their mode of star formation , as measured by the relationship between the surface density of molecular gas , @xmath172 , and the surface density of star formation , @xmath173",
    "? there is reason to think that this might be the case .",
    "dwarfs differ from large spirals in a number of important respects : luminosity , mass , metallicity , large scale dynamical effects ( such as spiral density waves and supernova - driven shocks ) , dust properties , uv radiation field , and possibly magnetic field strength .",
    "each of these differences could conceivably change the properties of molecular clouds in a manner that affects the rate at which stars form out of molecular gas .",
    "any such difference should manifest itself as a different large scale relationship between @xmath172 and @xmath173 .",
    "radio continuum offers two major advantages over other star formation tracers for the work in this section : 1 ) rc data are free of extinction and 2 ) the entire sky is available in the nvss at @xmath71 resolution ( comparable to the @xmath67 12 m beam ) .",
    "this latter advantage allows us to measure @xmath173 with the same resolution that we use to measure @xmath172 ( @xmath12 kpc for a typical dwarf galaxy ) .",
    "figure [ rcvsico ] shows the rc brightness ( flux density , in mjy , per @xmath71 beam ) , @xmath174 , and the integrated intensity , @xmath175 ( in k ) , associated with  pointings from our survey and the supplemental sample ( only galaxies with both  and rc detected at @xmath176 significance are included ) .",
    "figure [ rcvsico ] shows that @xmath174 and @xmath175 are highly correlated in both large spirals and dwarfs .",
    "this association has long been known in large spirals @xcite and we see here that it extends seamlessly to dwarf galaxies . indeed , we find that the power laws that best describe the two datasets independently ,    @xmath177    and    @xmath178    agree within the uncertainties . _",
    "the simplest interpretation for this agreement is that dwarfs and large spirals show the same relationship between molecular gas and star formation and that the  and rc trace these physical quantities in the same way in all galaxies_. in this context , dwarf galaxies appear to be simple low mass mass versions of large spirals .",

    "our  dataset is composed of observations with resolutions that range from @xmath183 to @xmath31 .",
    "for  pointings observed with a beam larger than @xmath71 , we measured the radio continuum brightness from the nvss over an area matching the  beam ( i.e. , we convolved the nvss to the resolution of the  observation ) . for galaxies observed in  with a beam smaller than @xmath71 , we used the brightness in a single nvss beam pointed at the center of the galaxy ( with a @xmath71 area ) .",
    "the nvss noise level is @xmath72 mjy beam@xmath20 , which translates into @xmath184 m@xmath27  yr@xmath20  kpc@xmath30 for a face - on galaxy .    to create a homogeneous subsample free from spurious bulge contributions or inclination effects , we discarded all galaxies with hubble types earlier than sb , inclinations @xmath185 and angular diameters @xmath186 .",
    "we labeled galaxies with inclination - corrected @xmath187  dwarf galaxies and all others as large spirals .",
    "the results below are fairly insensitive to this sample selection .",

    "using this subsample we determined that a `` schmidt law '' law of the form    @xmath190    is a good description of the data ( figure [ sfrvsh2 ] ) . to quantify the underlying relationship between @xmath173 and @xmath172 , we followed the suggestion of @xcite and used the ordinary least squares ( ols ) bisector method ( the geometric mean of the ols fit of @xmath78 to @xmath79 and that of @xmath79 to @xmath78 ) .",
    "we applied bootstrapping techniques to estimate the robustness of the ols bisector fits .",
    "that is , we randomly drew a number of points from our data equal to the number in the original sample , allowing points to repeat and calculated the ols bisector fit from each sample .",
    "we repeated this process many times and estimated the uncertainty in each parameter from the variation of fitted values . from these tests , we conclude that the galaxies ( large and dwarf combined ) in our sample are best described by the following power law :    @xmath191    a relationship that agrees within the errors with that derived by ( * ? ? ?",

    "strongly molecule - dominated galaxies , where @xmath199 m@xmath27 pc@xmath30 , have @xmath200 years .    the star formation efficiency ( sfe ) is often used to characterize star formation .",
    "the sfe can be defined as the fraction of molecular gas turned into stars over @xmath201 years . in this case",

    "thus , although the two types of galaxy appear to obey the same underlying relationships , this does not imply that they exhibit the same sfe or @xmath109 .",
    "because dwarf galaxies tend to have lower average @xmath172 than large spirals , they exhibit slightly lower sfe and slightly larger @xmath109 than more massive systems .",

    "the conversion between rc and sfr relies on an empirical calibration of the nonthermal synchrotron emission to the supernova rate .",
    "alternatively , the rc - to - sfr conversion can be calibrated via the fir - to - rc correlation , since the fir luminosity of a galaxy can be directly converted into a star formation rate once the amount of uv light reprocessed by dust is known .",
    "both of these methods will break down when applied to sufficiently small objects .",
    "the fraction of relativistic electrons that escape from a galaxy is not well known , but cosmic rays may be more likely to escape from a small galaxy by diffusion or convection ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * and references therein ) . therefore , a given amount of star formation could lead to less rc emission in dwarfs than in large galaxies .",
    "similarly , small galaxies , with their shorter path lengths to escape and lower dust abundances , are likely to reprocess less of the uv photons emitted by young stars into fir emission . since the fir and rc are strongly correlated down to luminosities of @xmath208 or lower , if fir traces sfr nonlinearly then rc must also trace sfr nonlinearly @xcite .",
    "although a thorough calibration effort of the rc - to - sfr relation for small systems has yet to be undertaken , this reasoning suggests that applying the rc - to - sfr calibration derived in the milky way or other large galaxies to smaller systems would yield sfrs that are too low .    to investigate the effects of possible changes in the co - to - h@xmath7 and rc - to - sfr calibrations in our derived star formation laws we apply to our sample some of the corrections suggested in the literature .",
    "we modified equation [ rctosfr ] to include a luminosity correction , as suggested by @xcite ,    @xmath209    here @xmath210 w hz@xmath20 , the approximate rc luminosity of an @xmath211 galaxy , and the correction applies only to galaxies with radio luminosities below @xmath212 .",
    "this correction is obtained by comparing the rc to the infrared luminosity of a galaxy , which is in turn calibrated against its uv emission .",
    "because smaller galaxies reprocess less of their uv light into infrared light , they have more star formation per unit infrared luminosity , thus the correction factor increases with decreasing galaxy luminosity ( the connection to the rc is via the empirical fir - to - rc correlation ) . to correct  by metallicity effects we employ the dependence found by @xcite    @xmath213 \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where we have estimated metallicities from the absolute b magnitudes of the dwarf galaxies using the relationship found by @xcite given in equation [ rmzeq ] above .",
    "we find that the power law that best describes the relationship between the adjusted @xmath173 and @xmath172 is    @xmath214    which agrees , within the uncertainties , with the uncorrected results .    after applying reasonable corrections to equations",
    "[ rctosfr ] and [ cotomol ] , the actual values of both @xmath172 and @xmath173 have both increased by factors of @xmath12 for each dwarf galaxy , so that we derive the same underlying relationship between these two quantities .",
    "if we apply either correction without the other to the dwarf galaxies , we get a difference in the coefficients with no change in the exponent @xmath215 within the uncertainties ( @xmath216 for only the  correction , and @xmath217 for only the rc correction ) .",
    "thus , if only one correction holds , dwarf galaxies form a different mass of stars per unit molecular gas than large galaxies  less if only  is a strong function of metallicity , more if only the sfr .",
    "therefore , we find that the power law index relating @xmath172 to @xmath173 appears to be roughly the same , @xmath218 , irrespective of mild changes in the assumed -to - h@xmath7 and rc - to - sfr conversions .",
    "plausible corrections to both the sfr and h@xmath7 estimates based on the rc and the co yields a schmidt law coefficient that is identical to that found with no corrections , implying that dwarf and large galaxies show the same star formation surface density for a given h@xmath7 surface density .",
    "this result breaks down if only one of the sfr or the h@xmath7 estimates are corrected .",
    "we do note that the majority of dwarf galaxies considered here are dwarf spirals .",
    "an extension of this analysis to dimmer dwarf irregular galaxies would probe a yet more extreme set of physical conditions and be of considerable interest , but this will require millimeter wave telescopes with increased sensitivity .",
    "we report the detection of molecular gas in @xmath1 dwarf galaxies with no previously published  detections and the marginal detection of @xmath2 more .",
    "we also present upper limits for @xmath219 dwarf galaxies that we did not detect .",
    "these data increase by more than 50% the number of published  detections of dwarf galaxies .",
    "most detections are late type spirals ( hubble type @xmath220sc ) , of about the same stellar and dynamical mass of the large magellanic cloud , with considerably brighter co emission but somewhat lower star formation activity , and located at a distance of @xmath221 mpc .",
    "nondetected galaxies tend to be smaller than detections , with slightly later hubble types ( usually irr ) .",
    "the most significant differences between the detections and the nondetections appear to be the stellar mass , traced by @xmath4- and @xmath5-band luminosities , and high mass star formation rate , traced by their fir emission and ( less significantly ) radio continuum luminosities .",
    "the correlations we observe between the presence of emission and other galaxy parameters , such as hubble type or mass to light ratio can largely be ascribed to the fact that these properties are also correlated with luminosity .",
    "the tight correlation between the molecular gas mass and the @xmath4-band luminosity may result from the dominant role played by the stellar disk in setting the midplane pressure or equivalently local density of the atomic gas .",
    "thus , dwarf galaxies tend to have roughly the same amount of molecular gas per unit stellar mass as large spirals , although their isms are dominated by large reservoirs of atomic gas and the molecular gas makes up only a small fraction of the total gas mass .",
    "given the distances to our targets and the sensitivity of our survey , we would not expect to detect galaxies with much less  emission than the lmc .",
    "thus , we do not know if these correlations hold for lower mass galaxies , but we see no evidence that we have `` hit a wall '' in our attempt to detect  in small galaxies .",
    "both our detections and the upper limits associated with our nondetections are consistent with a nearly constant @xmath222 throughout our sample .",
    "because the nondetections include the most `` primeval '' ( metal poor , low mass , and dynamically simple ) galaxies in the sample , achieving the order of magnitude increase in sensitivity necessary to ( perhaps ) detect them in  would be useful .",
    "if a change in  properties exists , it may well be at very low metallicities where co ceases to trace h@xmath7 .",
    "for instance , @xcite suggested a sharp increase in the co - to - h@xmath7 conversion factor , below @xmath223 .",
    "though we see a drop in detection rates with decreasing metallicity ( traced by b - magnitude ) within our own sample , the metallicity is covariant with many other galaxy properties and we find no evidence for substantial changes in between @xmath224 .    combining our data with that of several previous  surveys and the nvss",
    ", we find that dwarf galaxies with detected  emission show the same relationship between  and the 1.4 ghz radio continuum as large galaxies .",
    "this result suggests that there is a constant star formation efficiency among dwarfs and large galaxies at a given @xmath182 .",
    "this conclusion is insensitive to the application of small corrections to both the co - to - h@xmath7 and rc - to - sfr conversions , although not to either conversion factor alone .",
    "apparently , changes of factors of @xmath225 in metallicity and galaxy stellar mass are not enough to markedly alter the @xmath173-to-@xmath172 relation .",

    "<S> the galaxies we detect are comparable in stellar and dynamical mass to the large magellanic cloud , although somewhat brighter in co and fainter in the fir . within dwarfs , we find that the co luminosity , @xmath3 , is most strongly correlated with the @xmath4-band and the far infrared luminosities . </S>",

    "<S> we suggest that @xmath3 and @xmath6 correlate well because the stellar component of a galaxy dominates the midplane gravitational field and thus sets the pressure and density of the atomic gas , which control the formation of h@xmath7 from . </S>",
    "<S> we compare our sample with more massive galaxies and find that dwarfs and large galaxies obey the same relationship between and the 1.4 ghz radio continuum ( rc ) surface brightness . </S>",
    "<S> this relationship is well described by a schmidt law with @xmath8 . </S>",
