    "the structure of vacuum of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) is one of the most important subject in hadronic physics and has been intensively studied for decades . in particular , it is impossible to understand the phase structure of qcd and the hadron spectrum without good understanding of the qcd vacuum .",
    "for example , it has been well known that the spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking ( s@xmath1sb ) of the qcd vacuum plays the crucial role in the qcd phenomenology in the low energy regime .",
    "the most important consequence of s@xmath1sb is the existence of the massless modes generated via the nambu - goldstone mechanism identified as the pseudo - scalar ( ps ) mesons in the hadron spectrum .",
    "furthermore their masses can be explained by the small but finite current quark masses @xmath19 mev which break the chiral symmetry explicitly .",
    "the kaons are heavier than the pions because that the @xmath2 flavor symmetry is explicitly broken by the much heavier strange quark mass @xmath20 mev .",
    "s@xmath1sb also explains the absence of the mass degeneracy between the parity partners such as @xmath21 and @xmath22 which is a consequence of the chiral symmetry of qcd hamiltonian .",
    "moreover one can construct the chiral effective lagrangian to calculate the interactions between hadrons in the low energy regime .",
    "although most of the mass spectrum of the light ps mesons can be understood by the spontaneous and explicit chiral symmetry breaking , the large mass splitting between the @xmath9 and @xmath10 mesons in the flavor @xmath23 nonet had remained a puzzle . even including the current quark masses effect ,",
    "the mass of @xmath10 should satisfy @xmath24 , if @xmath25 is spontaneously broken  @xcite .",
    "this puzzle was later resolved by the @xmath25 anomaly  @xcite , namely @xmath25 symmetry is already broken at quantum level . thooft first suggested that the _ instanton _ breaks the @xmath25 symmetry explicitly  @xcite and constructed a dilute instanton gas model which is a semi - classic approximation of the topological charge distribution of yang - mills theory to explain @xmath25 problem .",
    "however the approximation itself breakdowns in the infrared regime such that it can not provide the estimation of the @xmath10 mass .",
    "the strength of this anomaly is characterized by the topological susceptibility @xmath0 defined by the following two - point correlation at zero - momentum transfer : @xmath26 where @xmath4 indicates the topological charge density operator and @xmath27 stands for the four - dimensional volume in euclidean space . thooft",
    "first suggested that the _ instanton _ breaks the @xmath25 symmetry explicitly  @xcite and constructed a dilute instanton gas model which is a semi - classic approximation of the topological charge distribution of yang - mills theory to explain @xmath25 problem .",
    "however the approximation itself breakdowns in the infrared regime such that he can not provide the estimate of the @xmath10 mass . on the other hand ,",
    "the first estimation of @xmath10 mass was given by the witten - veneziano formula in the pure yang - mills ( ym ) qcd in the large @xmath28 limit .",
    "it is derived from the ward identity of the flavor singlet chiral current  @xcite : @xmath29 empirically , using eq .",
    "( [ eq : chpt ] ) by plugging in the physical masses of the ps mesons one has @xmath30  @xcite .",
    "this value has been confirmed by the lattice simulation  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the dilute gas model of thooft and witten - veneziano approach differ from each other in the ratio @xmath31 and the numerical result seems to prefer the latter .  @xcite .",
    "since the topological susceptibility @xmath0 plays such an important role in qcd , naturally there have been many theoretical approaches to compute @xmath0 including many lattice qcd ( lqcd ) simulations  @xcite , effective qcd - like models  @xcite , qcd sum rule  @xcite , @xmath0 at finite temperature  @xcite , ads / qcd approach  @xcite , and so on .    in the present work ,",
    "we employ the nonlocal chiral quark model ( nl@xmath1qm ) to compute @xmath0 .",
    "the present model is based on the liquid instanton qcd - vacuum configuration .",
    "after the bosonization , the effective partition function of the instanton model becomes a partition function with quarks ( @xmath32 ) and pseudo - scalar ( ps ) mesons ( @xmath33 ) with the nonlocal interactions between them .",
    "therefore it is called the nonlocal chiral quark model ( nl@xmath1qm , ) . to identify the topological charge operator @xmath4 within nl@xmath1qm , we need calculate the four divergence of the flavor singlet current derived by the infinitesimal @xmath25 rotation of the partition function . from it",
    "one can figure out the topological charge operator .",
    "we also consider the small but finite difference @xmath34 between the numbers of the instantons @xmath35 and the anti - instantons @xmath36 in order to derive the appropriate expression of @xmath0 in the chiral limit . by computing the two - point correlation defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ts ] ) by using @xmath4 of our own model , we obtain basically three distinctive contributions for @xmath0 for the leading order ( lo ) in the @xmath6 expansion : 1 ) the contribution with the dynamical quarks @xmath37 , which contains the quark loops and the ps - meson propagator .",
    "2 ) that consists of the ps - meson propagator without the quark loops @xmath38 .",
    "3 ) a constant contribution from the @xmath39 effect , i.e. @xmath40 , which survives only in the chiral limit @xmath41 where @xmath42 stands for the current quark mass with its flavor @xmath43 . furthermore",
    ", we verify that nl@xmath1qm reproduces the witten - veneziano and leutwyler - smilga formulae analytically .",
    "after fixing the average ( anti)instanton size @xmath7 fm and inter-(anti)instanton distance @xmath8 fm , we generate all the physical quantities needed for computing @xmath0 self - consistently in nl@xmath1qm .",
    "our values of the masses and weak decay constants of the ps mesons are in a good agreement with the experimental values .",
    "our numerical value of @xmath13 whereas @xmath44 in the quenched limit .",
    "in other words , we find that the inclusion of the dynamical quarks reduces @xmath0 by @xmath45 in nl@xmath1qm .",
    "it is consistent with the lqcd data  @xcite .",
    "our result is also comparable with other theoretical results and the empirical value @xmath46 .",
    "the present work is organized as follows : in section ii , we briefly introduce our theoretical framework including the details of nl@xmath1qm and the derivation of the expression of @xmath0 within nl@xmath1qm .",
    "our numerical results and related discussions are given in section iii .",
    "the last section is devoted to the conclusion and future perspective .",

    "a non - zero topological charge implies that the tunneling occurs between the qcd vacua related to each other by the homotopy of the su(3 ) color - gauge symmetry .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the _ instanton _ is one of the semi - classical solutions to explain this novel qcd phenomenon  @xcite .",
    "moreover , a non - zero topological charge also indicates that the flavor - singlet axial current of qcd is not conserved because of the @xmath25 anomaly .",

    "we note that topological susceptibility @xmath0 is deeply related to the axion potential as a function of temperature ( @xmath182 )  @xcite .",
    "moreover , @xmath0 reveals rich information on the qcd phase diagram as an order parameter of @xmath25 symmetry and its relation with s@xmath1sb is also studied  @xcite .",
    "as already explored in our previous works  @xcite , the present model has provided successful descriptions for various qcd properties at finite @xmath182 as well as quark chemical potential @xmath183 .",
    "it is based on the instanton qcd - vacuum configuration which is responsible for the nontrivial mechanisms of s@xmath1sb and its ( partial ) restoration .",
    "hence , we expect that the careful studies on @xmath0 in medium within the current theoretical framework will shed light on understanding of the strongly - interacting systems at finite @xmath182 and/or @xmath183 .",
    "related works are under progress and will appear elsewhere .",
