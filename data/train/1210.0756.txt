    "to find time evolution of the number of citations of physics papers we used the thomson - reuters isi web of science .",
    "we chose a certain publishing year ( 1984 ) that on the one hand is distant enough from now , while on another hand , the contents of the most part of the papers published in this year is available now in the electronic format .",
    "we considered the fields of physics , astrophysics , optics , crystallography , and material science and excluded popular science and review journals .",
    "we performed the search using 82 journals with the highest annual number of publications @xmath59 and considered only articles , letters and notes while the editorial material , comments , and reviews were excluded . to find physics papers in the multidisciplinary nature and science journals we looked through the titles of all publications in 1984 and chose only those that by our opinion fall under physics category .",
    "how representative is this list of journals ? to answer this question we invoke bradford s law @xcite stating that few largest journals contain the dominant part of papers in the field .",
    "figure [ fig : bradford ] shows that the rank - size distribution for the set of largest 82 journals exhibits the power - law dependence with cut - off .",

    "the homogeneity of our data set with respect to citations is ensured by the fact that the papers in different physics subdisciplines are published in the same journals .",
    "these journals impose a certain standard of the reference list length that provides a natural scale for citations in this scientific discipline .",
    "indeed , assume the cohort of all papers that were published in the same year and consider citation distribution for this cohort after many years . since all these papers will be cited predominantly by the papers in the same discipline , and neglecting the @xmath62 annual growth of the number of publications , the mean number of citations would be equal to the average length of the reference list .",
    "this condition of stationarity was the rationale for our choice of the whole physics discipline rather than a single subdiscipline .",
    "this homogeneity of physics with respect to citations is also revealed from the inspection of the cumulative citation distributions for the papers published in different physics journals .",
    "indeed , in the researcher s perception the theoretical and experimental papers could have different citation pattern . to find out to what extent this is true we chose three large physics journals that do not have page limitation- physical review b ( prb ) , journal of aplied physics ( jap ) , and review of scientific instruments ( rsi ) . as seen from the reader / author s perspective",

    "this means that the growth model for citations of the papers published in these three journals is actually the same and only the scale ( initial conditions , namely , the number of citations garnered by a paper during first 2 - 3 years after publication ) is different .",
    "the homogeneity of the physics discipline with respect to citations becomes evident also from the consideration of the list of the most cited physics papers .",

    "notably , the list below is not dominated by a single subdiscipline .",
    "although the theoretical papers prevail , the experimental papers are represented fairly well ( 26.6@xmath56 ) . ( the absence of several nobel prize - winning papers that appeared during this period is explained by the fact that they quickly became common knowledge ) .    *",

    "<S> citation dynamics of these papers is the aftereffect of their initial hit and is more or less predictable since the impact of these papers is probably limited to several research groups and does not propagate further . </S>",
    "<S> however , citation rate of @xmath57 of the papers that overcome the tipping point @xcite of @xmath58 citations is determined more by their recent citation history . </S>",
    "<S> it seems that these papers have a continuing impact @xcitewhich propagates from one research group to another in a cascade process like in epidemics @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this diffusion of scientific knowledge @xcite extends the paper longevity to much more than 10 - 15 years .    in summary , </S>",
    "<S> our measurements indicate that the mechanism that generates complex networks may be more sophisticated than the memoryless linear preferential attachment assumed so far . </S>",
    "<S> we propose a stochastic growth model that considers the evolution of the node degree as an inhomogeneous self - exciting point process . in the context of citations , </S>",
    "<S> the model is fully verified by our microscopic and macroscopic measurements and can serve for prognostication of the future citation behavior of a paper , group of papers , or of a journal impact factor .    </S>",
