    "the recent discovery of superconductivity in iron - based arsenide with the critical temperature ( @xmath4 ) higher than mcmillan limit of 39 k ( the theoretical maximum predicted by bcs theory)@xcite has generated great excitement since the superconductivity is clearly unconventional similar to the cuprate superconductors .",
    "the iron - based arsenide superconductors have a quasi - two dimensional structure , in which fe@xmath5as@xmath5 layers are separated by different charge reservior , such as lno ( ln = la , sm , pr , ce , gd etc.)and ae ( ae = ba , ca , sr etc . ) .    to attempt new iron - based superconductor with higher critical temperature , more and more new iron - based compounds with different structures have been found and superconductivity was also found in these system , such as lifeas , fese etc@xcite .",
    "however , superconductivity was not reported for the attempts to replace old charge reservior with thicker ones , such as sr@xmath6sc@xmath5o@xmath7fe@xmath5as@xmath5@xcite .",
    "increasing the thickness of charge reservior can make the system more two - dimensional and enhance the spin fluctuation and density of state at fermi surface , consequently the superconducting transition temperature can be pushed to higher .",
    "recently , a similar attempt was successful in fep materials@xcite .",
    "ogino et al .",
    "found that the sr@xmath8 is superconducting below 17k , which is higher than laofep with t@xmath9 @xmath10 5k@xcite .",
    "this new material has a similar structure with sr@xmath11 , which has been reported earlier@xcite . in this new fep material ,",
    "the charge reservior is thicker than the one of laofep , so that distance between the conducting fep layers is much increased .",
    "it indicates that an increase in the thickness of charge reservior should enhance the superconducting critical temperature .",
    "in the other hand , the critical transition temperature of doped feas systems are much higher than the one of fep system with similar structure@xcite . above findings",
    "shed light for finding new superconductor with higher critical transition temperature by searching new feas / fep compounds with thicker charge reservior .    in our paper , we successfully prepared new layered oxypnictides @xmath0 ( m = fe and co ) .",
    "the two materials adopt the same crystalline structure with sr@xmath8 .",
    "their transport and magnetic properties have been systematically studied .",
    "the temperature dependence of hall coefficient and thermoelectric powder for @xmath2 compound show complicated behavior , similar to that of iron - based parent compounds lnofeas and @xmath3 .",
    "it suggests that the @xmath2 could be considered a new parent compound as iron - based superconductors .",
    "polycrystalline samples of sr@xmath12sc@xmath5o@xmath13m@xmath5as@xmath5 ( m = fe and co)were synthesized by solid state reaction method using sras , fe@xmath5as , co@xmath5as , sro and sc@xmath5o@xmath6 as starting materials .",
    "fe@xmath5as and co@xmath5as was pre - synthesized by heating the mixture of fe and as powder at 900@xmath14 for 24 hours .",
    "sras was prepared by the reaction of sr lumps and as powder at 800@xmath14 for 24 hours .",
    "the raw materials were accurately weighed according to the stoichiometric ratio of sr@xmath12sc@xmath5o@xmath13m@xmath5as@xmath5 ( m = fe and co ) , then thoroughly grounded and pressed into pellets .",
    "the pellets were wrapped with ta foil and sealed in evacuated quartz tube .",
    "the sealed tubes were sintered at 900@xmath14 for 10 hours and 1200@xmath14 for 50 hours . the sample preparation process except for annealing",
    "was carried out in glove box in which high pure argon atmosphere is filled .",
    "x - ray diffraction was carried out on an 18 kw mxpahf x - ray diffractometer with high - intensity cu ka radiation .",
    "structural refinement was performed using the analysis program gsas .",
    "the resistance was measured by an ac resistance bridge(lr-700 , linear research ) .",
    "magnetic susceptibility measurements were performed with a supercondcucting quantum interference device magnetometer ( quantum design mpms-7 )",
    "x - ray powder diffraction patterns are shown in fig.1(a ) for the polycrystalline samples : sr@xmath12sc@xmath5o@xmath13fe@xmath5as@xmath5 and sr@xmath12sc@xmath5o@xmath13co@xmath5as@xmath5 , respectively .",
    "nearly all diffraction peaks in the patterns of both samples can be indexed by the tetragonal with the space group p4/nmm , indicating that the samples are almost single phase .",
    "the lattice parameters are a = 0.4045 nm and c = 1.5802 nm for the sample sr@xmath12sc@xmath5o@xmath13fe@xmath5as@xmath5 and a = 0.4045 nm and c = 1.5695 nm for the sample sr@xmath12sc@xmath5o@xmath13co@xmath5as@xmath5 , respectively . the crystal structure for both of samples",
    "is shown in fig.1(b ) , being similar to the sc-22426 compound with fep layer.@xcite new layered oxypnictides @xmath0 ( m = fe and co ) consist of stacking of antifluorite - type m@xmath5as@xmath5 layer and perovskite type sr@xmath12sc@xmath5o@xmath13 layer , and the distance between anti - fluorite m@xmath5as@xmath5 layers is about 15.7@xmath15    figure 2 shows temperature dependence of resistivity for the samples sr@xmath12sc@xmath5o@xmath13m@xmath5as@xmath5 ( m = fe and co ) . as shown in fig.2 ,",
    "the resistivity of sr@xmath12sc@xmath5o@xmath13fe@xmath5as@xmath5 exhibits a complicated temperature dependent behavior .",
    "a slightly metallic behavior shows up above 200 k , and a weak semiconducting - like behavior is observed with decreasing temperature down to about 50 k. below 50 k , the resistivity sharply increases with decreasing temperature . for the sample sr@xmath12sc@xmath5o@xmath13co@xmath5as@xmath5 ,",
    "the resistivity show a metallic behavior above about 100 k , and a weak semiconducting - like behavior below 100 k.    the temperature dependent susceptibility for sr@xmath12sc@xmath5o@xmath13m@xmath5as@xmath5(m= co , fe ) is shown in fig.3 . for sr@xmath12sc@xmath5o@xmath13fe@xmath5as@xmath5 , a well defined curie - weiss behavior was observed in the whole temperature region from 4 k to 300 k , and no obvious magnetic transition was observed down to 4k , which is different from iron - based parent compounds of 1111-type and 122-type@xcite , but similar with sr@xmath6sc@xmath5o@xmath7fe@xmath5as@xmath5@xcite .",
    "it seems to be that increasing thickness of charge reservior is harmful for the formation of spin density wave transition .",
    "this maybe ascribed to strong magnetic fluctuation in these more two - dimensional structures .",
    "for sr@xmath12sc@xmath5o@xmath13co@xmath5as@xmath5 , a ferromagnetic - like behavior was observed , but the curie temperature maybe higher than measurable temperature range .",
    "it is similar with laocoas and laocop@xcite , in which an itinerant ferromagnetism was also observed .",
    "it is possible that the curie temperature for sr@xmath12sc@xmath5o@xmath13co@xmath5as@xmath5 is much higher than laocoas ( t@xmath9 @xmath10 66k ) .    in order to identify carrier - type for sr@xmath12sc@xmath5o@xmath13fe@xmath5as@xmath5 , its hall effect and the thermoelectric power ( tep )",
    "are systematically measured .",
    "figure 4a shows the temperature dependence of thermoelectric power .",
    "tep of the sample sr@xmath12sc@xmath5o@xmath13fe@xmath5as@xmath5 is negative at room temperature , and decreases with decreasing temperature , and show an anomaly peak at about 180 k. such anomalous peaks in tep coincides with the occurrence of the crossover from metallic to semiconducting behavior in resistivity as shown in fig.2 . with further decreasing temperature below 180 k , the tep increases and",
    "the change of tep sign happens at about 95 k. such tep behavior is very similar to that of @xmath16 ( m = ba , ca ) and lnofeas.@xcite figure 4b shows the temperature dependence of the hall coefficient r@xmath17 .",
    "one can see that r@xmath17 remains negative in the whole temperature range from 5 k to 300 k. the absolute value of r@xmath17 increases rapidly below about 50 k at which the resistivity starts to increase sharply with decreasing temperature .",
    "such behavior is similar to that observed in smofeas in which sdw ordering leads to rapid increase of hall coefficient.@xcite .",
    "negative hall coefficient and tep indicate that electron - type charge carriers dominate the conduction in the sample .",
    "the different sign of hall coefficient and tep implies that the system is multiband , being similar to the case of lnofeas(1111 ) and bafe@xmath5as@xmath5(122 ) parent compounds .",
    "new layered oxypnictides @xmath0 ( m = fe and co ) are successfully discovered .",
    "they adopt the tetragonal structure , being the same as that of @xmath1 .",
    "their transport and magnetic properties have been systematically studied .",
    "the temperature dependence of hall coefficient and thermoelectric powder for @xmath2 compound show complicated behavior , similar to that of iron - based parent compounds lnofeas and @xmath3 .",
    "our studies suggest that sr@xmath12sc@xmath5fe@xmath5as@xmath5o@xmath13 maybe a new parent compound for iron - based superconductor .",
