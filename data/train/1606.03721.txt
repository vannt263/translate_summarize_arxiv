    "while such an impurity effectively behaves as a free particle , renormalization effects due to interactions between the impurity and the bath are known to be significant .",
    "the polaron problem had been discussed originally in the context of solid state physics , where an electron interacts with a bath of phonons , that is , bosons @xcite .",
    "recently , experiments with ultracold atoms have allowed us to consider a similar problem with fermions : an impurity immersed in a bath of fermions @xcite .",
    "experiments using a mixture of two different hyperfine states as well as a hetero - nuclear mixture have been performed in two and three dimensions @xcite .",

    "this opens up a way to realize a novel strongly - coupled impurity system , whose understanding requires a non - perturbative analysis .    a number of different techniques in quantum many - body physics have been applied to the analysis of the polaron problem .",

    "their approach yields accurate results at imaginary time , but it comes at a high computational cost .    in this paper , we study the fermi polaron problem using frg based on the derivative expansion , which is numerically much less expensive than the bmw approach .",
    "while the derivative expansion of the scale - dependent effective action is able to capture critical phenomena accurately @xcite , it is inadequate to describe spectral properties of quasiparticles because it fails to capture higher excited states and a continuum incoherent background .",
    "recently , however , schemes to circumvent such difficulties of the derivative expansion on the basis of analytic continuation of flow equations to real time has been developed and tested in nuclear physics @xcite . in this work",
    ", we apply this scheme to the polaron problem at zero temperature , and reveal not only thermodynamic properties of the system but also spectral properties of quasiparticles including highly excited states , thus going far beyond the conventional realm of a derivative expansion .",

    ", the flow equation itself depends on the choice of the regulator function , resultant physical properties in the ir limit are expected to be unaltered . in this paper , we choose the so - called 3d sharp cutoff regulator : in the case of bosons , @xmath25 for @xmath26 and @xmath27 for @xmath28 . in the case of finite - density fermions",

    "solving is a challenging numerical problem . instead of solving these integro - differential equations by brute force",
    "we shall proceed in two steps as follows @xcite : in the first step , we solve in the leading - order derivative expansion . in the second step ,",
