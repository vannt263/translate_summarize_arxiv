    "in order to controllably and reproducibly induce strain , graphene layers , prepared by micromechanical cleavage of graphite , are deposited on two different flexible substrates .",
    "one is a 720 @xmath107 thick , 23 mm long polyethylene terephthalate ( pet ) film .",
    "the other is a 3 mm thick , 10 cm long , 1 cm wide clear acrylic ( perspex ) . in both cases",
    "the large length - to - width ratio is chosen to allow uniform bending and reversibility . prior to graphene deposition",
    ", the substrates are spin coated with su8 2000.5 ( microchem ) photoresist@xcite of carefully chosen thickness ( 400 nm ) , which is then cross - linked .",
    "this ensures optimal visible contrast for graphene identification@xcite . to achieve maximum strain ,",
    "the length of the substrate is altered in order to have the flake at its center , fig .",
    "1 . note that the size of the graphene layers is orders of magnitude smaller than the substrate length ( @xmath108 and @xmath109 times smaller , respectively ) .",
    "this ensures a uniform strain in the section measured by raman spectroscopy .",
    "the first substrate is used in two point bending experiments , whilst the second in four point bending , fig .",
    "raman spectra are measured with a 100x objective at 514 nm excitation with a renishaw micro - raman spectrometer , having 1800 grooves / mm grating and spectral resolution of @xmath42@xmath6 .",
    "the polarization of the incident light can be controlled by a fresnel rhomb , while an analyzer can be placed before the grating .",
    "the power on the samples is well below 2mw , so that no shift , nor change in width of the raman peaks is observed for a fixed strain , thus ensuring no damage , nor heating .",
    "a cycle of loading , unloading and loading is followed to ensure reproducibility for both experiments .",
    "a total of 80 raman spectra are measured for an average strain increment of 0.05% .",
    "the maximum strain applied to the sample is less than @xmath41.2% .",
    "in the two point measurements , the spectra do not change until a nominal strain of @xmath40.55% is applied to the substrate .",
    "afterwards they evolve linearly with strain .",
    "thus , we assume this point as the reference zero strain for the sample . in the four point ,",
    "the spectra evolve linearly from zero strain .",
    "the two set of data are fully overlapping , further confirming the strain measurements .",
    "the data are fully reproducible over three strain cycles between maximum and minimum , as shown in fig .",
    "3 . only when suddenly applying large strains or large strain increments we observe sample slippage , indicated by an upshift , or smaller downshift or no shift at all of the raman parameters . indeed , for samples suddenly bent to large strain values of a few %",
    "we often observe no change in the raman peaks , indicating a general loss of contact between the graphene and the substrate .",
    "_ it is thus extremely important to apply the strain in the most controlled way in order to ensure reproducibility and no slippage_. a further set of 36 measurements is done for a fixed value of strain , by rotating the incident polarization in 10@xmath102 steps with respect to the strain axis , and analyzing the scattered light in the plane parallel to the strain axis .",
    "all carbons show common features in their raman spectra in the 800 - 2000 @xmath6 region , the so - called g and d peaks , which lie at around 1580 and 1350 @xmath6 respectively@xcite .",
    "the g peak corresponds to the doubly degenerate @xmath10 phonon at the brillouin zone center .",
    "the d peak is due to the breathing modes of sp@xmath27 rings and requires a defect for its activation@xcite .",
    "it comes from to phonons around the * k * point of the brillouin zone@xcite , is active by double resonance ( dr)@xcite and is strongly dispersive with excitation energy due to a kohn anomaly at * * k**@xcite .",
    "the activation process for the d peak is an inter - valley process as follows :",
    "i ) a laser induced excitation of an electron / hole pair ; ii ) electron - phonon scattering with an exchanged momentum @xmath110 ; iii ) defect scattering ; iv ) electron / hole recombination . the d peak intensity is not related to the number of graphene layers , but only to the amount of disorder@xcite .",
    "dr can also happen as intra - valley process i.e. connecting two points belonging to the same cone around @xmath111 ( or @xmath112 ) .",
    "this gives rise to the so - called dpeak , which can be seen around 1620 @xmath6 in defected graphite @xcite .",
    "the 2d peak is the second order of the d peak .",
    "this is a single peak in monolayer graphene , whereas it splits in four bands in bilayer graphene , reflecting the evolution of the band structure@xcite .",
    "the 2d peak is the second order of the d peak .",
    "since 2d and 2d peaks originate from a process where momentum conservation is obtained by the participation of two phonons with opposite wavevectors ( @xmath113 and @xmath114 ) , they do not require the presence of defects for their activation , and are thus always present .",
    "indeed , high quality graphene shows the g , 2d and 2d peaks , but not d and d@xcite .",
    "we use density - functional theory ( dft ) and density - functional perturbation theory ( dfpt )  @xcite as implemented in the pwscf package of the quantum - espresso distribution  @xcite , within the local - density approximation  @xcite , with norm - conserving pseudopotentials  @xcite and a plane - wave expansion up to 55  ry cut - off .",

    "<S> the observed behavior can be explained by considering the effect of uniaxial strain on the optical modes responsible for the g , and d and d peaks , respectively .    </S>",
    "<S> the grneisen parameter for the doubly - degenerate , in - plane , raman active @xmath10 phonon , @xmath11 , is@xcite : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the hydrostatic component of the applied uniaxial strain , @xmath14 is the longitudinal direction , parallel to the strain , and @xmath15 is the direction transverse to it ; @xmath16 is the g peak position at zero strain . </S>",

    "<S> this is analogous to the effect of curvature on the g peak of carbon nanotubes . </S>",
    "<S> the g peak splitting in nanotubes is the combined result of electron confinement and curvature@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> pure curvature splits the graphene e@xmath0 mode in a component parallel to the tube axis and one perpendicular . </S>",
    "<S> when the sp@xmath27 bonds of graphene are deformed by rolling it in a tube , they lengthen and soften in the direction perpendicular to the axis , in order for the @xmath28 electrons to be perpendicular to it . </S>",
    "<S> this is proportional to curvature , so it is minimum parallel to the axis , and maximum along the circumference , increasing with decreasing diameter@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , by curvature only , nanotubes will have a to g@xmath2 peak and a lo g@xmath1 , with the former softer than the latter , and more sensitive to diameter changes . </S>",
    "<S> this simple picture is reasonable for semiconducting nanotubes@xcite , while in metallic , a further significant softening of the lo mode takes place due to the enhanced kohn anomaly resulting from electron confinement@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , this further effect must be absent in `` unrolled '' tubes , i.e. graphene . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of the g@xmath1 and g@xmath2 peaks in graphene is roughly constant as a function of strain at @xmath29 , whereas fwhm(g@xmath2 ) in metallic nanotubes becomes much larger , due to the increased electron - phonon coupling contribution@xcite .    by fitting the trends in fig . 3 to eqs . </S>",
    "<S> 1,2 , 3 we can experimentally determine the gruneisen parameters for graphene . </S>",
    "<S> under uniaxial strain@xcite @xmath30 and @xmath31 . where @xmath32 is the poisson s ratio . </S>",
    "<S> if one could strain free - hanging graphene samples , the poisson s ratio for graphene itself should be used . </S>",
    "<S> this can be taken as the in - plane poisson s ratio of graphite @xmath40.13  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , the lack of loading - unloading hysteresis for our results implies good adhesion between graphene and our substrates for the whole range of applied strains . </S>",
    "<S> su8 is a transversely isotropic material with a 0.33 in plane poisson s ratio@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> pet and perspex have also poisson s ratios between 0.3 - 0.35 . </S>",
    "<S> we thus use @xmath32=0.33 . </S>",
    "<S> this corresponds to the case of ideal contact between graphene and substrate . </S>",
    "<S> eq . </S>",
    "<S> 3 is now rewritten as : @xmath33 yielding : @xmath34 @xmath35 from the data in fig.3a we get @xmath11=1.99 ; @xmath17=0.99 . </S>",
    "<S> these experimental parameters can now be used to estimate the trends for free - hanging graphene under uniaxial strain . </S>",
    "<S> inserting @xmath11=1.99 , @xmath17=0.99 , @xmath32=0.13 in eq . 4 </S>",
    "<S> , we get @xmath5 - 18.6 @xmath6/ % ; @xmath36 - 36.4 @xmath6/% . </S>",
    "<S> note that the effect of the substrate higher poisson s ratio is to significantly decrease the slope of the g@xmath1 peak . </S>",
    "<S> these results are also in excellent agreement with our first - principles calculations ( see later ) .    </S>",
    "<S> we can now use our fitted @xmath11 to deduce the expected peak variations for graphene under biaxial strain . in this case </S>",
    "<S> @xmath37 and , from eq . </S>",
    "<S> 3 , @xmath38 , since the shear deformation term cancels . this means , as expected , that the g peak does not split . </S>",
    "<S> also , no difference is expected between free - hanging graphene and graphene on a substrate . </S>",
    "<S> thus , for biaxial strain : @xmath39 - 63 @xmath6/ % .    to the best of our knowledge , no data exist in literature for uniaxial strain on graphite . however , several authors applied hydrostatic pressure on graphite@xcite finding @xmath404.4 - 4.8@xmath6/gpa , where @xmath41 is the hydrostatic pressure ( stress ) . </S>",
    "<S> the in - plane biaxial strain under hydrostatic pressure is @xmath42 . since for graphite in - plane @xmath43@xcite , </S>",
    "<S> the data in refs.@xcite correspond to an in - plane gruneisen parameter @xmath441.72 - 1.90 , in very good agreement with our results . </S>",
    "<S> many groups have considered hydrostatic pressure on nanotubes ( see , e.g.,@xcite ) . generally it is found @xmath45 , in good agreement with graphene and graphite </S>",
    "<S> . however , electron confinement and other effects in nanotubes warrant a more detailed comparison of our results on graphene with the trends for the individual lo and to g bands in nanotubes , which will be presented elsewhere .    </S>",
    "<S> several experiments exist for uniaxial strain on graphite fibres@xcite </S>",
    "<S> . these could be the best approximation of uniaxial strain along the graphite plane , since their very large diameter compared to single wall nanotubes ensures other possible effects due to electron confinement will be negligible@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> extensive work on carbon fibres of different moduli has shown that the peaks shift is directly related to axial stress rather than strain@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , one can assume that in uniaxial experiments the applied stress is the known parameter , and the strain applied to the atomic bonds can be derived from @xmath46 , where s@xmath47=1/e is the fibre elastic compliance , e the young s modulus and @xmath48 the applied longitudinal stress . </S>",
    "<S> thus , in order to correctly estimate the strain , it is necessary to know the fibre e , which , in general , is significantly lower than the in - plane young s modulus of graphite@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> then , if we extend the universal relation between raman peak shift and uniaxial stress to graphene , the following should hold : @xmath49=@xmath50 . </S>",
    "<S> most fibres show a uniaxial stress sensitivity of @xmath51/gpa  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , pan - based carbon fibres with `` onion skin '' morphology ( i.e. those most similar to large multi - wall nanotubes ) have @xmath52=-2.3 @xmath6/gpa  @xcite . note that , due to disorder , the g peak of carbon fibres is very broad and not resolved in two subbands . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the fitted g represents the average shift of the two subbands . </S>",
    "<S> our average shift , using the in - plane graphite poisson s ratio , as needed in order to compare with fibres , is @xmath53 - 27@xmath54 . if we scale the uniaxial strain sensitivity of pan fibres by the in plane young s modulus of graphite@xmath41090gpa  @xcite , this would imply a value of @xmath4 - 25@xmath54 , in excellent agreement with our average value . </S>",
    "<S> this also validates the assumption that the graphene young s modulus is similar to the in plane young s modulus of graphite , in agreement with recent measurements@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a notable discrepancy exists only with ref.@xcite for uniaxial measurements on fibres . however , their data imply @xmath442.87 , in disagreement with both our measurements and with all graphite literature@xcite </S>",
    "<S> . we also note that our results disagree with recent raman experiments on uniaxial strain in graphene@xcite , which report much smaller @xmath55 , implying much smaller gruneisen parameters . </S>",
    "<S> it is difficult to see how the gruneisen parameters of graphene should be much smaller than those measured in - plane for graphite . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , no g peak splitting was observed for uniaxial strain@xcite , again in contrast with both our observation and general expectations .    </S>",
    "<S> we now consider the case of the singly degenerate phonon modes corresponding to the d and d peaks . </S>",
    "<S> the d peak is a breathing mode similar to the to a@xmath56 phonon at k@xcite ( see methods ) . for a pure a@xmath56 symmetry and small strains , </S>",
    "<S> the uniaxial stress shift @xmath57 is given only by the hydrostatic component of the stress : @xmath58 on the other hand , the d phonon is of e symmetry@xcite and we could expect in principle splitting , and a relation similar to eq . </S>",
    "<S> 4 . however , experimentally this peak is very weak and we can not resolve any splitting in the strain range we have considered . </S>",
    "<S> thus , for small strains , we write for both raman peaks @xmath59    combining our experimental data with eq . </S>",
    "<S> 8 we get @xmath603.55 ; @xmath611.61 . for free - hanging graphene , </S>",
    "<S> these give  @xmath62 - 83@xmath6/% ;  @xmath63 - 45@xmath6/%    in the case of graphene under biaxial strain @xmath37 and @xmath64 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , using our fitted gruneisen parameters , the expected 2d and 2d variation as a function of biaxial strain are : @xmath65 - 191 @xmath6/ % and @xmath66 - 104 @xmath6/ % .    </S>",
    "<S> to the best of our knowledge no data exist for the 2d or 2d peak dependence in graphite as a function of uniaxial strain . </S>",
    "<S> however , ref.@xcite measured @xmath67/gpa for pan carbon fibres . </S>",
    "<S> this scales to @xmath68 in graphene , in agreement with our predicted uniaxial trend , when using the in plane possion s ratio of graphite , as needed for comparison with fibres . for graphite under hydrostatic pressure ref.@xcite </S>",
    "<S> reported @xmath6912.3 @xmath6/gpa , and @xmath709 @xmath6/gpa . </S>",
    "<S> this corresponds to an in - plane biaxial strain @xmath42 . from @xmath71  @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> we get @xmath72/% ; @xmath73= 2.84 ; @xmath74/% ; @xmath75= 1.74 , in broad agreement with our predictions for biaxial strain .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , we note that , in any case , the 2d peak is extremely sensitive to strain . with a typical spectrometer resolution of @xmath42@xmath6 , a remarkable sensitivity of @xmath40.01% and </S>",
    "<S> 0.03% can be achieved for biaxial and uniaxial strain , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> we also note that a combined analysis of g and 2d fwhm and shifts should allow to distinguish between effects of strain , doping or disorder@xcite .     and g@xmath2 modes as determined by density - functional perturbation theory . </S>",
    "<S> note that these are perpendicular to each other , with g@xmath2 polarized along the strain axis , as expected , width=321 ]    to further understand our findings we perform first - principles calculations on free - standing graphene as described in methods@xcite , for small strains up to @xmath41% , to compare with experiments . </S>",
    "<S> the effects on electron and phonon bands of larger strains will be reported elsewhere . </S>",
    "<S> fig.4 plots the resulting g@xmath1/g@xmath2 eigenvectors . </S>",
    "<S> these are perpendicular to each other , with the g@xmath2 eigenvector oriented along the strain direction , as expected . for small strains </S>",
    "<S> we find @xmath76 - 34 @xmath6/ % and @xmath77 - 17 @xmath6/% , independent on the strain direction , as expected from symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> we also get @xmath11=1.87 ; @xmath17=0.92 , in excellent agreement with our measured parameters . </S>",
    "<S> note that , in order to compare the calculated trends for g@xmath1 and g@xmath2 with our measurements , we need to insert the theoretical parameters in eq . </S>",
    "<S> 4 together with the substrate poisson s ratio . this gives @xmath78 - 30@xmath6/ % ; @xmath79 - 10.3@xmath6/% , in excellent agreement with the fits in fig.3a . </S>",
    "<S> we also calculate the biaxial strain variation for the g peak . </S>",
    "<S> we find @xmath39 - 58 @xmath6/% ;  @xmath11=1.8 , again in excellent agreement with the biaxial values based on our experimental gruneisen .    </S>",
    "<S> we then calculate the uniaxial and biaxial strain variation for the 2d peak . </S>",
    "<S> we find @xmath80 - 60 @xmath6% for uniaxial , and @xmath81 - 144 @xmath6/ % ; for biaxial and @xmath822.7 for both . </S>",
    "<S> these are in excellent agreement with the results of hydrostatic pressure experiments on graphite , and in broad agreement with our experimental data for uniaxial strain ( and the consequent biaxial predictions ) , being @xmath425/% smaller . </S>",
    "<S> it is important to consider that , while for the raman active g mode we are probing the same centre - zone phonon when measuring the raman spectrum on a strained sample , the raman d and d peaks are zone boundary phonons activated by double resonance ( see methods ) . </S>",
    "<S> any change in the double resonance condition during the strain experiments will vary the actual phonon probed in the raman measurements , as well as inducing a change in the phonon frequencies . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the relationship between phonon gruneisen parameters and the variation of the raman peaks with applied strain is in principle more complex than the case of the g peak and what implied by eqs  7,8 . indeed , while biaxial strain does not move the relative positions of the dirac cones , uniaxial strain changes them  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> note that this does not open any gap , in contrast with the conclusions of ref.@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> still , it can have a significant influence in the double resonance process . as explained in methods , while the d is intra - valley , i.e. connecting two points belonging to the same cone around * k * or * k * , the d peak phonon requires scattering from the cone around * k * to that around * * k**@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , its wavevector is determined by the relative distance of the dirac cones and by the laser excitation energy . </S>",
    "<S> our experiments are performed for a fixed excitation . </S>",
    "<S> then , what we measure in raman spectroscopy of uniaxially strained graphene is the combination of the 2d phonon shift due to strain , and a possible additional shift due to the fact that the relative movement of the dirac cones changes the phonon wavevector . for an asymmetric movement </S>",
    "<S> this could lead to peak broadening and splitting . indeed </S>",
    "<S> the experimental fwhm(2d ) significantly increases with strain . in the case of the 2d </S>",

    "<S> however , for both d and d , other effects could be given by the renormalisation of fermi velocity and phonon group velocity with strain . </S>",
    "<S> thus , especially for the d peak , our measured @xmath83 has to be taken as an upper boundary , and a more general expression to evaluate it can be @xmath84 , with @xmath85 encompassing the corrections due to the changes in the phonon selected in double resonance , as a function of strain . </S>",
    "<S> we note that , in the case of biaxial strain , at least the effects due to the relative movement of the dirac cones are absent . </S>",
    "<S> thus , raman experiments on graphene under biaxial strain would be more suited to measure the d mode gruneisen parameter , and this explains why our calculations are in excellent agreement with the hydrostatic pressure experiments on graphite . thus , given the peculiar nature of electron - phonon and electron - electron interactions around the k point in graphene@xcite , combined with the relative movement of the k , k points under uniaxial strain@xcite , and the possible re - normalizations of electron and phonon bands , the full theoretical description of the 2d peak under uniaxial strain needs further investigation , and will be reported elsewhere .     </S>",
