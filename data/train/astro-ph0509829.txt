    "the main aim of this paper is to produce chemical evolution models of the irregular galaxy ngc 6822 .",
    "these models will be used to look for consistency with the cosmological context of galaxy formation as well as to study the possible presence of outflows from this object to the intergalactic medium .    in the field of chemical evolution",
    "often it is argued that a model for a given galaxy is far from being unique . in this paper",
    "we use as many observational constraints as possible to try to obtain a robust model with the idea of getting closer to a unique solution .",
    "the constraints used include : gas mass , chemical abundances , integrated colors , and a star formation history derived from observations . on the other hand the models used a gas infall history derived from the hierarchical standard @xmath0cdm cosmology .",
    "the models also used the imf and the yields that reproduce the chemical evolution of the solar neighborhood and the galactic disk @xcite .",
    "ngc  6822 is particularly suited for chemical evolution models because its star formation history is well known @xcite , its present chemical composition might permit to decide if outflows to the intergalactic medium have been produced by this galaxy .",
    "ngc  6822 , unlike the magellanic clouds , has not lost a significant amount of mass due to tidal effects .",
    "ngc  6822 is a member of the local group that apparently has not been affected by tidal effects from the milky way or m31 @xcite .",
    "there has been no recent interaction between ngc 6822 and these two galaxies because : i ) ngc 6822 is located 495 kpc away from our galaxy and is receding from it at a radial velocity of 44 km s@xmath1 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and ii ) ngc 6822 is also located at 880 kpc from m31 , it is separated from m31 by more than 90 degrees in the sky , and m31 is approaching our galaxy at 121 km s@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "an open problem in the study of the chemical evolution of irregular galaxies is the cause of the difference between the observed effective oxygen yield and the oxygen yield predicted by closed box chemical evolution models .",
    "one solution to this problem might be due to the presence of o - rich galactic outflows ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "several lines of reasoning indicate that o - rich outflows produced by gas rich irregular galaxies are unlikely .",
    "carigi et al .",
    "( 1995 , 1999 ) , based on the c / o and o / h values for nearby irregular galaxies , have found that o - rich outflows have not played an important role in their evolution .",
    "a similar result has been obtained by @xcite , based on the n / o versus o / h relationship .",
    "these results indicate that o - rich outflows do not play a major role in the evolution of irregular galaxies .",
    "another solution to the o yield problem might be due to the presence of dark matter ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the importance of outflows to the intergalactic medium from nearby irregular galaxies depends on many factors , like their total mass , the distribution in time and space of their star formation , and the presence of tidal effects ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .    in most galaxy chemical evolution models the infall of gas of primordial composition",
    "is modeled assuming a parametric form @xcite . here",
    "we will take a cosmological approach : the rate at which gas is accreted by the galaxy will depend on how the mass , dark and baryonic , falls into the galaxy ( the mass assembly history , mah ) , and the reionization history of the universe .",
    "the mah in turn depends on the assumed cosmology and the total mass of the galaxy @xcite . for a halo of a given mass",
    ", there is an ensamble of possible mahs . in this paper",
    "we will take the mean mah ( defined in section 3.3 ) as representative of the mah of ngc  6822 . before the epoch of reionization",
    ", the history of the infalling gas is simply related by a constant to the mah , afterwards the amount of gas accreted by the galaxy will depend on how fast the mass of the dark halo and the filtering mass grow with time @xcite .",
    "we will assume also that the gas infalling history is not altered by processes such as ram pressure or tidal striping .",
    "these assumptions are supported by the absence of warm - hot gas associated to the local group and by the fact that this galaxy is isolated .    in section 2",
    "we define different masses present in an irregular galaxy and their role in chemical evolution models .",
    "the total mass and the halo mass assembly history within a @xmath0cdm cosmology are derived in sections 3.1  3.3 . in section 3.4",
    "we discuss two scenarios for the baryonic mass building of the galaxy , one in which the reionization of the universe reduces the galaxy baryon fraction , below the universal one ; and another in which in addition to reionization the galaxy baryon fraction is also reduced by large - scale shock heating . in section 4",
    "we estimate the gaseous mass and discuss the present day chemical composition to be fitted by the models . in section 5",
    "we determine the variation of the star formation rate and the luminosity with time . in section 6",
    "we discuss the evidence in favor of gas outflows . in section 7",
    "we present the general characteristics of the chemical evolution models . in section 7.1",
    "we discuss the large infall models , hereinafter l models , where the effect of gas shock heating is not considered . in section 7.2 we discuss the small infall models , hereinafter s models , where the effect of gas shock heating is considered , this effect prevents a substantial fraction of baryons from reaching the galaxy . in sections 8 and 9 we present the discussion and the conclusions",
    "we can define the total mass , @xmath2 , as    @xmath3    where @xmath4 is the baryonic mass , and @xmath5 is the non - baryonic mass .",
    "@xmath4 can be expressed as    @xmath6    where @xmath7 is the mass in substellar objects ( with stellar mass , @xmath8 , lower than 0.1 ) , and has also been called the baryonic dark matter , @xmath9 is the mass of objects with @xmath10 , and @xmath11 is the mass in compact stellar remnants .",
    "@xmath12 can be approximated by    @xmath13    where we have neglected the ionized and the heavy element components .",
    "@xmath12 is also given by    @xmath14    where @xmath4(accreted ) is the baryonic mass accreted from the intergalactic medium during the galaxy formation , @xmath12(outflow ) is the baryonic mass ejected to the intergalactic medium during the galactic evolution , and @xmath15 is the mass returned to the ism by the evolution of the stars .",
    "we define the ratio of the baryonic mass accreted by the galaxy to the total mass as    @xmath16    and the ratio of the baryonic mass that remains in the galaxy to the total mass as    @xmath17    in this paper , galaxy and halo are synonymous .",
    "a high - resolution rotation curve that extends to 5 kpc has been determined for this galaxy by @xcite using the australian telescope compact array . inside this radius , @xmath18 ,",
    "the mass of the galaxy given by @xmath19 is @xmath20 , where we are assuming that the circular velocity , @xmath21 , is equal to the _ rotational _ velocity determined observationally from the gaseous component of the disk and amounts to 55 km s@xmath1 . with an observed baryonic mass of @xmath22 ( see sections 4 and 7 ) we find that ngc  6822 is a galaxy dominated by dark matter with @xmath23 , inside @xmath24 kpc .      the total mass of a galaxy is a model dependent quantity . here we will use a cosmologically motivated model to estimate the mass of the galaxy in question .",
    "cosmological collisionless n - body simulations show that density profiles of dark matter ( dm ) halos can be described well by the nfw profile @xcite @xmath25 the characteristic radius @xmath26 is the radius where the logarithmic derivative of @xmath27 is @xmath28 , while the characteristic density @xmath29 is given by @xmath30 .",
    "the nfw profile can also be characterized by a concentration parameter , @xmath31 , and by the virial circular velocity @xmath32 , where @xmath2 is the virial mass of the galaxy .",
    "the virial radius , @xmath33 , can be defined as the radius where the average halo density is @xmath34 times the mean density of the universe according to the spherical top - hat model . here",
    "@xmath34 is a number that depends on epoch and cosmological parameters ( , ) ; for a flat ( 0.3,0.7 )  model @xmath35 at the present epoch . in practice ,",
    "we use cosmology to infer a relationship between the maximum circular velocity , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 , that is given by @xmath38 @xcite , where @xmath39 .",
    "we thus can estimate the total mass of the halo once @xmath36 and @xmath40 are given .",
    "we use as @xmath36 the rotational velocity at the outermost measured point .",
    "the mass of the halo may be underestimated because : i ) the rotation curve for this galaxy may still rise beyond this radius and ii ) we are neglecting any contribution from the gas velocity dispersion .",
    "the concentration of a dm halo depends on many parameters such as nature of the dark matter , halo mass , epoch , normalization of the power spectrum , etc . here",
    "we will assume the `` concordance ''  model ( @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 ) where @xmath45 is the hubble constant in units of @xmath46 and  is the rms of the mass fluctuations computed with the top - hat window of radius @xmath47 .",
    "if we take the median concentration estimated using the model by @xcite and @xmath48 km s@xmath1 from @xcite we find @xmath49 .",
    "this is the total mass that we will assign to ngc  6822 that implies an @xmath50 kpc and @xmath51 .",
    "the adopted @xmath2 implies that baryons at present contribute to the galaxy mass budget with only 1.65% , such small values seem to be typical of dwarf galaxies .      within",
    "the cdm galaxy formation paradigm a halo grows in a hierarchical fashion : self - bound structures form from bottom to top through the accretion and merging of smaller structures .",
    "a halo of a given mass today can arise from one of many possible mass aggregation histories .",
    "we use the recipe described in appendix a of @xcite , which is based on the extended press - schechter formalism @xcite , to derive the mean mah for our given particular cosmological model and halo mass .",
    "@xcite finds , after experimenting with a variety of fitting functions , that the mahs are well fitted by the following parametric form : @xmath52 = -0.301 \\left [ \\frac{\\log(1+z ) } { \\log(1+z_f ) } \\right]^\\nu,\\ ] ] where @xmath53 and @xmath54 are the mass of the halo at @xmath55 and @xmath56 , respectively , and @xmath57 and @xmath58 are free parameters . according to this expression , @xmath57 is defined as the redshift where half of the mass of the halo is acquired , and it is 1.50 for the total mass and cosmological context assumed in this paper .",
    "based on figure 6 of van den bosch we took two additional models with extreme values of @xmath57 , given by @xmath59 , to cover the scatter in the mass assembly histories .",
    "the mean mah is computed assuming @xmath60 , the slow and fast mahs are those computed adopting @xmath61 and @xmath62 , respectively .",
    "figure 1 shows the mahs of these models ( solid for mean and dotted lines for slow and fast ) .",
    "a high fraction of baryons @xmath63% in the present - day universe do not reside in galaxies , the missing baryons @xcite .",
    "they can be in virialized regions of halos ( hot gas in hydrostatic equilibrium ) , in a diffuse phase with overdensities @xmath64 ( @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is the mean density of the universe ) , or in a warm - hot phase with @xmath67 @xcite .",
    "this gas could have been expelled out of halos by strong winds or never became bound to halos in the first place .",
    "photoionization of the igm by quasars or early star formation is an efficient mechanism that impedes gas to fall into small galaxies .",
    "below we estimate the effect that the reionization of the universe could have had on the gas infalling history of ngc  6822 .",
    "we use the formulas b1-b3 of appendix b of @xcite to estimate the effect of reionization on the structure of ngc  6822 . the formula b3 given below",
    "@xmath68 ^ 3},\\ ] ] is an expression for the fraction of cold gas left in the halo of mass @xmath69 @xcite and @xmath70 is the universal baryon fraction and amounts to 0.14 .",
    "the filtering mass , @xmath71 , defined as the mass of a halo which would retain 50% of its gas mass , is an increasing function of cosmic time and depends on when reionization starts , @xmath72 ( see , for example , fig .",
    "b10 of kravtsov et al . ) .",
    "we use the mass assembly history @xmath53 of section 3.3 and equation ( 10 ) to compute the fraction of baryonic matter accreted by the galaxy at any given redshift , that is given by @xmath73 where the prime denotes derivative with respect to redshift .    in figure 2",
    "we plot @xmath74 as a function of time for the mean mah ( solid line ) .",
    "the formula above is formally valid for @xmath75 , but it is clear that for redshifts greater than @xmath76 this fraction is just given by @xmath70 . once the epoch of reionization begins the amount of baryons in the galaxy at any time will depend on how @xmath77 evolves .",
    "@xmath77 varies by about a factor 2 from @xmath78 ( @xmath79 gyr ) to @xmath80 ( @xmath81 gyr , the present time ) for the mah model .",
    "its rapid increase from @xmath72 to @xmath82 ( @xmath83 gyr ) makes @xmath74 decrease after @xmath72 . as time goes on , the drop in @xmath74",
    "is stopped because @xmath77 decreases .    yet",
    ", there is a second mechanism that might reduce the amount of baryons in galaxies : assume that a significant fraction of baryons was never incorporated into the galaxy",
    ". primordial gas could have been shock - heated by the collapse of non - linear structures of mild overdensities ( pancakes and filaments ) , raising the entropy floor @xcite and thus increasing the cooling time above the hubble time .",
    "although simulations with higher numerical resolution are needed to confirm this prediction @xcite , present - day simulations seem to support this idea .",
    "numerical simulations by @xcite show that about 40% of the gas at present is in a warm - hot phase ( 25% with @xmath84 and 15% with @xmath85 ) .",
    "we will model this phenomena by simply assuming that this increase in temperature in the intergalactic medium occurs suddenly , when the mass of the gas in the galaxy reaches 60% of its present - day value ( in the absence of large - scale shock heating ) . from this epoch , @xmath86 ( @xmath87 gyr ) , to the present the amount of accreted baryons in the galaxy does not increase . the second drop in @xmath74",
    "( see figure 2 , dotted line ) is due to this effect .",
    "it should be clear by now that the evolution of @xmath74 as well as its present - day value depend on the mah .",
    "for the mahs considered for ngc  6822 and in the absence of large - scale shock heating , @xmath88 takes the following values : 0.033 ( slow , @xmath61 ) , 0.045 ( mean , @xmath89 ) , and 0.066 ( fast , @xmath90 ) . for completeness",
    "we also show in figure 3 the evolution of the total ( dashed line ) and baryonic ( solid line ) mass for the mean mah model , time is cosmic time . as in figure 2 , the dotted line represents the model where the large - scale shock heating of the gas is incorporated .    at this time it may be convenient to summarize the steps we have taken to produce the gas mass accretion history .",
    "the infall of gas is proportional to that of the dark matter _ until the onset _ of the reionization epoch which we have taken to be @xmath91 . once the reionization starts the accretion rate of gas is no longer proportional to that of the dark matter .",
    "in fact , in some models , models with shock heating , the fall of gas is stopped while the accretion of dark matter continues . in this sense ,",
    "the baryonic buildup of the galaxy is not certainly hierarchically .",
    "we will see later that the model favored by the observed chemical abundances requires an early galactic wind which in turn makes even less hierarchical the baryonic buildup of ngc  6822 .",
    "this non hierarchical scenario has been called the downsizing problem and has been discussed elsewhere ( e.g. arnouts et al . 2005 , cowie et al . 1996 ) .    in section 7",
    "we will describe two families of models for the increase of @xmath12 _ versus _ time .",
    "those models that accrete a relatively large @xmath12 and consider the effects of reionization only , will be called _ large infall models _ ( l models ) , and their chemical evolution will be discussed in section 7.1 .",
    "those models that accrete a relatively small @xmath12 and that in addition to reionization consider the effect of shock heating will be called _ small infall models _ ( s models ) and will be discussed in section 7.2 .",
    "as observational constraints of the evolution models we will use the present chemical composition of the interstellar medium of ngc 6822 . to this effect we will combine the abundances of the supergiant stars and the regions .",
    "the supergiant stars were formed a few million years ago , therefore we expect them to have the same abundances than the regions .    in table",
    "[ tta ] we present the adopted ngc 6822 abundances . with the exception of the fe abundance all the abundances for ngc 6822",
    "are those derived by @xcite for hubble v , the brightest region of the galaxy .",
    "the fe abundance was derived by @xcite from two a supergiants and is in excellent agreement with the value derived by @xcite from three b supergiants . the gaseous fe abundance derived from the regions",
    "can not be used as a constraint because most of the fe atoms are trapped in dust grains .",
    "the o abundance is in very good agreement with the o / h values derived by @xcite for the two a supergiants mentioned before that amount to 12 + log o / h = 8.36 .",
    "there has been some discussion about the possible presence of abundance gradients in irregular galaxies , for example pagel et al .",
    "( 1978 ) state that a spatial abundance gradient , an analogous to those found in spiral galaxies , is small or absent in the lmc and conspicuously absent in the smc .",
    "the accuracy of the data on regions and supergiant stars for ngc 6822 is not yet good enough to establish the presence of a gradient .",
    "works by @xcite and @xcite are not conclusive , but seem to indicate that the o / h gradient is small or absent .",
    "ngc 6822 v is located about 1 kpc away from the galactic center and according to gottesman & weliachew ( 1977 ) about 70 % of the gaseous mass ( @xmath92 ) is located within 2.6 kpc . in what follows we will consider that the chemical composition of ngc 6822 v is representative of the gaseous component of ngc 6822",
    ".    also in table  [ tta ] we present the orion and solar abundances for comparison . for orion : fe comes from b stars @xcite and the other elements from the region @xcite .",
    "the solar abundances come from @xcite , with the exception of the he abundance that corresponds to the initial value computed by @xcite .",
    "the orion nebula is more representative of the present chemical composition of the solar vicinity than the sun for two main reasons : i ) the sun appears deficient by roughly 0.1 dex in o , si , ca , sc , ti , y , ce , nd and eu , compared with its immediate neighbors with similar iron abundances @xcite , the probable reason for this difference is that the sun is somewhat older than the comparison stars , and ii ) all the chemical evolution models of the galaxy predict a steady increase of the o / h ratio in the solar vicinity with time , for example the chemical evolution model of the solar vicinity presented by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite indicates that the o / h value in the solar vicinity has increased by 0.13  dex since the sun was formed .",

    "@xcite based on data obtained with the hst has derived the star formation rate ( @xmath118 ) of eight fields in ngc 6822 . since these 8 fields correspond to regions of the galaxy with different luminosities and taken together amount to 20% of the total luminosity of the object ( see bellow )",

    "a common hypothesis in chemical evolution models of dwarf galaxies is to assume that these galaxies expelled part of their gas during their lifetime : a galactic wind is mostly introduced in the modelling to explain the low chemical abundances found in these type of galaxies and ngc  6822 seems to be no exception . from an observational point of view",
    "the amount of evidence of outflows in star forming galaxies is increasing with time and we refer the reader to @xcite for an updated discussion of galactic winds . on the other hand , from a theoretical point of view , numerical simulations show that a blow - away outflow situation is not rather uncommon phenomenon in low - mass galaxies ( e.g * ? ? ?",
    "in order to see if ngc 6822 could have had a galactic wind during its lifetime , specially at high redshift , we have computed its present date binding energy as well as the thermal energy history of the gas . in figure 7",

    "see carigi , hernndez & gilmore ( 2002 ) .    also in fig .",
    "7 we show the binding energy of ngc 6822 for the present gas content based on the following equation :    @xmath164    as can be seen from figure 7 the thermal energy available , released during the lifetime of the galaxy , is higher than the present binding energy of the gaseous content of the galaxy , which implies that part of the thermal energy was lost by the galaxy in the past .",
    "this result is in agreement with the chemical evolution models that require a substantial gas outflow to match the present gaseous content with the observed o / h value ( see section 7 ) .",
    "as we mention above , the computation of the thermal energy content of ngc 6822 is based on the cooling scheme by cox ( 1972 ) .",

    "the outflows needed to explain the excess thermal energy predicted by the observed @xmath116 and by the chemical evolution model presented in section 6 very likely occurred in the first few gyr of evolution ( @xmath165 gyr ) because : i ) to propitiate an efficient blow away process strong bursts of star formation are needed @xcite , from the @xmath116 it is not possible to rule out the presence of several outburst processes at early times ( @xmath165 gyr ) , because the @xmath116 has been averaged at long time intervals ( @xmath166 2.5 gyr ) , and it is possible for one or two large bursts of star formation , to go unnoticed in the derived @xmath116 , on the other hand , at later times the @xmath116 has been averaged for shorter time intervals ( @xmath166 0.5 gyr ) , and it is more difficult for a high @xmath116 to go unnoticed ; ii ) in the past , in a hierarchical cosmology , the potential wells of galaxies , for a given present - day mass , are shallower ; iii ) strong star formation events are expected to occur because of the higher galaxy merger rate ( e.g. , maller et al . 2005 ) ; iv ) after an outflow occurs , @xmath12 gets diminished and the possibility of a second outflow due to a burst of star formation increases because there is a lower amount of gas in the ism to reduce the velocity of the sn ejecta , and v ) the low metallicity at early times increases the cooling time relative to the classical cox ( 1972 ) value , and therefore increases the thermal energy available propitiating the advent of galactic winds . as can be seen from our chemical evolution models , for example models 7l and 8s ( see section 7 ) the @xmath109 value for @xmath167 gyr is about 0.001 , thirteen times smaller than solar .",

    "the @xmath12 and the o / h values are the most critical observational constraints for ngc 6822 , therefore a model that fits the c / o , n / o and fe / o observed values , but that does not fit the observed o / h value , is a poor model because it does not fit the c / h , n / h , and fe / h observed values .    in model 1l",
    "we assume that all the baryons available after the reionization fall into the galaxy and remain in the galaxy during its whole evolution . in figure 8",

    "consequently , we consider model 2l to be unlikely .",
    "model 3l is built to reproduce the o / h observed value under the assumption of a well mixed outflow that starts at the same time than the star formation ( @xmath183 gyr ) . to reproduce the observed o / h value the model needs the outflow phase to last 4.0 gyr . during the outflow phase",

    "moreover , we think that it is unlikely that the material ejected by every sne in the last gyr escapes to the igm .",
    "in model 7l we have reduced the imf mass upper limit , @xmath189 , from 80  to 60 .",

    "it can be shown that the use of the salpeter imf would imply a smaller @xmath189 than that required by ktg imf to fit the observed o / h value .",
    "consequently , since all of the o is produced by massive stars and only a fraction of the c is produced by them , the c / o value would become considerably larger than observed ( e.g. see model 7s ) .    in table 4",
    "we present two carbon budgets : the stellar production one , and the interstellar medium one for l models .",

    "7l the contribution of massive stars to the c abundances in the ism is smaller than the stellar production due to outflows to the igm .",
    "since for models 4l and 6l the imf and the @xmath116 are the same , the higher contribution of ms to the c budget is due to the dependence of the c yields in the o / h ratio , which is higher for model 4l than for model 6l . for ms the c yields increase with metallicity due to stellar winds , while for lims the c yields decrease with metallicity ( carigi et al . 2005 ) . since for models 6l and 7l the @xmath116 and the o / h values are the same , the higher contribution of ms to the c budget is due to the difference in the imfs , while for model 6l @xmath189 amounts to 80  for model 7l it only amounts to 60 .",
    "finally the larger contribution of ms to the c budget in the solar vicinity than in model 1l is due to the evolution of the o / h values , and as mentioned before the higher o / h values produce higher c yields for ms and lower ones for lims .",

    "therefore , its predicted o / h value is higher than that obtained by model 4l because the chemical elements produced by the stars after t= 2.8 gyr are ejected into an ism which is no longer diluted by primordial infalling gas . to lower the o / h value of model 4s we have produced models 5s  7s that require even more extreme extra assumptions than those needed for models 5l  7l .",
    "in model 5s in order to reproduce the o / h value with the least massive cloud we have assumed that 0.5 gyr ago a primordial gaseous cloud of 1.2 @xmath180  was captured by ngc 6822 . with this extra infall , the model can reproduce all the observational constraints related to chemical abundances with the exception of n / o , but the predicted @xmath12 is higher by a factor of 1.6 ( see table 5 ) . the accretion of a huge gaseous cloud of primordial material recently is more unlikely than at earlier times .",
    "if we assume an accretion of a primordial cloud at @xmath204 gyr , with the same @xmath116 ( important at recent times ) , the model will require a more massive cloud producing a larger disagreement with the observed @xmath12 .",
    "we consider model 5s more unlikely than model 5l because the mass of the infalling cloud has to be larger and the disagreement with the observed @xmath12 becomes also larger .    for model 6s",
    "we have assumed a second outflow of the selective type during the last 2.5 gyr , when the @xmath116 is most important . in this outflow ,",
    "100 % of the material ejected by all snii and snia is lost to the igm .",
    "this model predicts higher c / o and n / o values ( see table 5 ) because the galaxy keeps the c and n produced by lims .",
    "model 6s is unlikely because between 11.0 and 13.5 gyr the @xmath116 does not indicate the presence of a major starburst ( see figure 4 ) needed to drive the outflow , and the potential gravitational well is largest .",
    "moreover , model 6s is more unlikely than model 6l because it requires a recent rich outflow of longer duration .",

    "this fact produces an increase of the c / o and n / o predicted values to -0.12 dex and -0.93 dex , respectively , more than 1.5 @xmath136 away from the observed values ( see table 5 ) .",
    "the fe / o value is adjusted because we have assumed a lower fraction of binary systems that become snia ( @xmath205 ) .",
    "this model does not reproduce the c / o and n / o values because with this imf there are more lims that are the main producers of c and n , at these metallicities . for model 7s the values of @xmath7 , @xmath9 , and @xmath11 ,",
    "amount to @xmath206 , @xmath207 , and @xmath208 , respectively .",

    "in particular , those models that match @xmath12 , predict higher o / h values than observed .",
    "the extra assumptions included in the models produce a rise in the c / o value , higher than observed .",
    "consequently , we have computed model 8s in order to reproduce @xmath12 , o / h , and c / o .    one way to reduce the o / h and c / h values , maintaining the c / o ratio , is with a well mixed outflow of longer duration . in model 8s , we assume a well mixed outflow during the first 4 gyr of star formation and the @xmath189 of imf and the @xmath176 of model 7l , the best of the l series models . model 8s reproduces marginally all observational constraints with the exception of n / o ( see table 5 and figure 12 ) .",
    "the c budget for model 8s is practically the same than for model 7l ( see table 4 ) because both models have the same @xmath116 , imf , @xmath176 and similar o / h .    during the wind phase the outflow rate of model 8s",
    "is equal to 3.13 times the @xmath116 .",
    "the gas mass lost is 7.2 @xmath209 , 3.5 times the mass of stars formed during the first 4.0 gyr of the star formation .",
    "martin ( 1999 ) estimates outflow rates from 1.7 to 4.8 times the @xmath116 for nearby irregular galaxies with the smallest maximum h i rotation speed of her sample .",
    "while these values are similar to those required by model 8s , they are smaller than those required by model 7l .",
    "the observed outflow rates for outbursting nearby irregular galaxies seem to support model 8s over model 7l , but probably at the time of the formation of the galaxy the accretion and merging of smaller structures also propitiated larger outflow rates , it is beyond the scope of this paper to carry this discussion further .      all our models fail to fit the n / o ratio , this could be due to problems with observations and with the adopted n yields . in what follows",
    "we will discuss this problem .",
    "@xcite obtained an excellent agreement between the present time n / o value predicted by the solar vicinity model and the n / o values derived from observations of h ii regions of the solar vicinity .",
    "alternatively , the n / o values predicted by all our models are higher than those observed in ngc 6822 by @xcite .",
    "moreover the n / o values derived from metal poor stars are in agreement with the model by @xcite but not for metal rich stars , these authors suggest that the disagreement is due to the n yields adopted in the chemical evolution models .",
    "we consider the m92 yields for c and o for @xmath210 as the best in the literature and we have used them in this paper . unfortunately m92 did not compute the n yields . in this paper",
    "we have adopted the n yields for @xmath210 by mm02 .",
    "the n yield is not self consistent with the c and o yields .",
    "furthermore since the n abundance is considerably smaller than that of c and o , the predictions for these two elements are robust , but the n results for massive stars should be taken with caution .",
    "romano , tosi , & matteucci ( 2005 ) using n yields for lims by van der hoek & groenewegen ( 1997 ) , different to those adopted by us , can not reproduce the n / o values of ngc 1705 , a late type dwarf galaxy . on the other hand , gaviln , moll , & buell ( 2005 )",
    "using their own n yields are able to match the present - day n / o value of the solar vicinity , but not the n / o evolution .",
    "this problem should be studied further .",
    "a possible explanation for the low n / o values in h ii regions of ngc 6822 could be due to the escape of an important fraction of the ionizing photons .",
    "if such were the case , the ionization correction factor ( @xmath211 ) for n becomes considerably larger than the usual @xmath211 adopted @xcite .",
    "the chemical evolution of ngc 6822 depends on @xmath2 , the mah , the baryonic infall as a function of time , and the importance of outflows . in what follows",
    "we will discuss these parameters and how they affect the different models that we have computed .      from the cosmological model adopted we have found an @xmath49 .",
    "in what follows we will discuss possible upper and lower limits for @xmath2 . in figure 13",
    "we present @xmath74 as a function of time for the minimum , adopted , and maximum @xmath2 values .",
    "the minimum @xmath2 for the l models is obtained when there are no outflows present . for the mean mah and without outflows",
    "we obtain @xmath212 , for a smaller mass the cosmological context predicts a smaller accreted mass than the baryonic mass observed . we have computed a chemical evolution model for this total mass and find that 12 + log o / h = 8.66 and c / o = - 0.29 dex .",
    "the o / h value is considerably higher than the observed one . to fit the observed o / h value we need an o - rich outflow or to reduce @xmath189 . in both cases",
    "the c / o value becomes considerably larger than observed .",
    "for example a model with @xmath189 of 45 gives 12 + log o / h = 8.42 in agreement with observations , but it also gives a c / o = -0.13 dex , 1.5 @xmath136 higher than the observed value .",
    "therefore the minimum @xmath2 model can be discarded by the chemical evolution models . for the s models the minimum @xmath2 is smaller than @xmath213 but larger than @xmath214 .",
    "the upper limit to @xmath2 considered by us is @xmath215 .",
    "the mass of this model is 1.54 times higher than the mass derived in section 3.2 . for this model",
    "the accreted gaseous mass amounts to @xmath216  and the ejected mass to @xmath217 .",
    "the ejected gaseous mass is about a factor of three larger than that of model 7l and implies that the efficiency and the duration of the outflows have to be considerably larger than for model 7l . if we assume a wind phase of 5.1 gyr duration , like that of model 7l , the outflow phase required amounts to 20.1 times the @xmath116 .",
    "this value is about an order of magnitude larger than that derived by martin ( 1999 ) for nearby irregular galaxies .",
    "the star formation history , that drives the outflow , is observationally fixed , and does not change with the increase of the adopted @xmath2 .",
    "moreover the larger @xmath2 provides a larger gravitational field that reduces the possibility of extended outflows . from these arguments we consider the adopted upper limit for @xmath2 a generous one .",
    "based on the models by van den bosch ( 2003 ) , that predict the virial masses of disk galaxies , we can also derive the masses for ngc 6822 for the cases with and without outflows .",
    "we have two observational constraints to derive @xmath2 , the maximum rotational velocity , that amounts to 55 km s@xmath1 , and the @xmath218 luminosity that amounts to log@xmath219 .",
    "the @xmath220 ratio is obtained from the ngc 6822 and the solar @xmath144 magnitudes that amount to -17.91 and 3.33 respectively ( see table 2 , campins et al .",
    "1985 , and hayes 1985 ) .",
    "from the two observational constraints and the models by van den bosch with @xmath221 and no outflows we obtain @xmath222 , while for the models with @xmath221 and outflow we obtain @xmath223 ; these values are somewhat smaller but in good agreement with those derived by us .",
    "valenzuela et al .",
    "( 2005 ) find @xmath2 @xmath224  and @xmath225 for their two favored models of ngc 6822 in good agreement with with our determination .    from the computed chemical evolution models we consider that the @xmath2 adopted by us is reasonable .",
    "but if @xmath2 were very different from our adopted value , new chemical evolution models must be computed .      in figure 1",
    "we have presented three mahs , the slow , the mean , and the fast . in the models presented in this paper",
    "we have adopted the mean mah .",
    "we will discuss why the other mahs were not considered . in figure 14",
    "we show the @xmath74 for the l models as a function of time for the three mahs under discussion and under the assumption that @xmath49 . due to the effects of reionization",
    "the amount of gas accreted by the galaxy reaches @xmath226 , @xmath227 , and @xmath228  for the slow , the mean , and the fast mahs respectively .",
    "the difference between the accreted mass and the observed baryonic mass , that amounts to @xmath229 , has to be ejected by outflows .",
    "the infall of gas produced by the slow mah at early times is not enough to form the older stars observed in ngc 6822 .",
    "therefore , based on our models , we discard the slow mah .    from figures 1 and 14",
    "it follows that we require to lose a larger amount of mass due to outflows for the fast than for the mean mah models .",
    "therefore the fast mah models would require an early outflow of longer duration than the mean mah models , typically of about 8 gyr . furthermore the gravitational field becomes larger at earlier times for the fast mah than for the mean mah models making it harder for outflows to occur , and the relative large initial gas content combined with the observed star formation history",
    "also prevent the presence of large outflow rates .",
    "these considerations made us discard the fast mah models .",
    "as mentioned in section 3.4 several authors have suggested that a significant fraction of baryons is not accreted by the galaxies due to large - scale shock heating of the gas . to consider this possibility we have computed a series of s models assuming that the evolution up to @xmath230 gyr is the same as for the l models , but after this time accretion stops for the s models .",
    "the s models accrete only 60% of the mass accreted by the l models ( see figures 2 and 3 ) .",
    "the total mass accreted by the s models amounts to @xmath231 , and since the baryonic mass at present is @xmath229 , these models only require to lose @xmath232 . in figure 15 we present @xmath233 , the ratio of the mass in baryons that remains in the galaxy to the total mass as a function of time .",
    "in general the s models predict higher enrichments in o / h and c / h than the l models ( see tables 3 and 5 ) .",
    "model 8s , the best model of the s series , requires a well mixed outflow with a duration of 4.0 gyr at the beginning of the @xmath116 ; its o / h , c / h , and @xmath12 values are 1.25@xmath136 , @xmath234 and @xmath235 higher than observed . based on the chemical evolution models we favor the large - infall series over the small - infall one ,",
    "particularly we prefer model 7l over model 8s .",
    "if the effect of large - scale shock heating on gas accretion involves a fraction of baryonic matter smaller than that taken into account by the s series models , it will be possible to build successful galactic chemical evolution models , intermediate between models 7l and 8s .",
    "we have derived the @xmath116 fort ngc 6822 based on observations and photometric evolution models .",
    "our photometric models based on the adopted @xmath116 , the salpeter imf , the ktg imfs , and three @xmath125 functions ( those predicted by our best chemical evolution models , 7l and 8s , and that by wyder ) predict absolute magnitudes and colors that agree with the observed ones at the one @xmath136 level .",
    "this result implies that our derived @xmath116 is robust and can be used for different applications related to ngc 6822 .",
    "based on the adopted @xmath116 we present 15 chemical evolution models for ngc 6822 .",
    "all models evolve according to the mass assembly history of non baryonic mass predicted by a cosmological context . to distinguish among them",
    "we have used five additional observational constraints : @xmath12 , o / h , c / o , n / o , and fe / o .",
    "from the cosmological context adopted and our chemical and photometric evolution models for ngc 6822 we find that @xmath236 .",
    "the adopted mass for the 15 models presented in tables 3 and 5 is @xmath213 .",
    "based on similar arguments , of the three mahs considered , we adopt the mean mah for all our models .    for the models of the large infall series",
    ", we have assumed that during accretion the universal baryon fraction is only reduced by reionization .",
    "for the models of the small infall series , we have assumed that accretion of baryonic matter is further reduced by large - scale gas shock heating .",
    "the best models of each series , models 7l and 8s , produce a reasonable fit to the observational constraints , but model 7l is somewhat better .",
    "models without well mixed outflows are not successful in reproducing the observational constraints because the amount of baryonic gas accreted by the galaxy is higher than the amount of baryonic matter derived from observations . moreover based on our adopted @xmath116",
    "the thermal heating produced by sne , under the assumption of no outflows , is considerably larger than the binding energy of the observed gas content .",
    "these two results imply that the presence of outflows of well mixed material is needed .",
    "we argue that these outflows most likely occurred early on in the history of the galaxy .    in order to comply with the presence of an early outflow , and the observed o / h and c / h values , we have computed our best models ( model 7l and 8s ) that have a ktg imf with @xmath189 of 60  while for the solar vicinity @xmath189 amounts to 80 . that is the number of sn of type ii per generation of stars has to be smaller in ngc 6822 than in the solar vicinity .",
    "a lower value of @xmath189 for ngc 6822 than for the solar vicinity is in agreement with recent results on dwarf galaxies by others authors .",
    "the fractions of c produced by ms ( @xmath237 8) , lims ( @xmath238 8) , and snia amount to 60  63% , 38  36% , and 1 2% respectively .",
    "on the other hand , in the solar vicinity , these values amount to 48% , 50% , and 2% , respectively .",
    "the n / o values predicted by all our models are higher than observed , the discrepancy could be due to the n ionization correction factor adopted to derive the n abundance in h ii regions and to the n stellar yields adopted by our chemical evolution models .",
