    "since the first experiments on atomic contacts , the `` atmospheric '' surroundings are known to have a strong effect on their charge transport properties.@xcite thus , studying the influence of adsorbed gas molecules is of great importance for the design of functional molecular - scale electronic components",
    ". it also shows some promise for the future development of gas sensors for `` electronic noses '' .",
    "however , the systematic experimental investigation of the influence of single gas molecules on charge transport through metallic atomic contacts started only a few years ago with hydrogen in atomic platinum contacts.@xcite it was found that the zero - bias conductance through such platinum - hydrogen contacts tends to be close to the quantum of conductance @xmath2 .",
    "in addition , this conductance value is due to a single , almost fully transparent channel.@xcite theoretical work has mostly confirmed these findings.@xcite    even so , one of the main problems in experiments of this type is to know if and in which configuration gas molecules are present in the contact region .",
    "a definite identification of the presence and the type of gas can be based on statistical techniques , such as the measurement of conductance histograms.@xcite for individual contacts , this becomes much harder . in the experiments of refs .",
    "the identification of a single hydrogen molecule was based on the so - called inelastic point contact spectroscopy , where the local vibrational modes can be seen in the current - voltage ( @xmath3-@xmath4 ) characteristics as abrupt features at bias voltages corresponding to the energies of the vibrations.@xcite the evolution of these features with stretching of the contacts can then be compared to calculations of the vibrational modes for given configurations of the molecule.@xcite in fact , theoretical methods have recently been developed that enable a direct comparison between the full experimental and theoretical @xmath3-@xmath4 characteristics , including the inelastic signatures of the vibrational modes .",
    "@xcite    for this purpose , namely to identify small molecules in atomic metal contacts through transport measurements , we study the general properties of oxygen ( o ) in atomic aluminum ( al ) contacts . in this paper",
    "we concentrate on the behavior of the zero - bias transport characteristics when the atomic contacts are stretched . in the spirit of refs .",
    ", we also study the evolution and character of the vibrational modes .",
    "aluminum was chosen , because it becomes superconducting below temperatures of 1 k. as a result , in addition to measurements of the total zero - bias conductance , it is possible to determine experimentally the transmission eigenvalues of the individual channels from the @xmath3-@xmath4 characteristics in the superconducting state.@xcite as particular examples , we study single oxygen atoms ( o ) , oxygen dimers ( o@xmath5 ) , and ozone ( o@xmath6 ) .",
    "these molecules ( we also refer to the oxygen atom as a molecule ) are placed initially in the middle of the contact between two aluminum electrodes , since their effect on the transport properties is then at its largest .",
    "we describe our contacts at the level of density - functional theory ( dft ) .",
    "in particular , the dft electronic structure is employed to determine the charge transport properties by means of green s function techniques .    in the following we present stable structures of the three types of contacts , where oxygen molecules bridge the gap between two idealized aluminum electrodes . for them , we calculate the vibrational modes and the low - temperature transport properties , including the characterization of the individual transmission channels . we find that both the energies of the vibrational modes , as well as the evolution of the conductance with increasing electrode distance show qualitatively comparable characteristics for the three investigated molecules .",
    "in contrast to pure al , the conductances of the al - o@xmath7-al contacts are always well below @xmath8 , and for an increasing number of o atoms , the conductance decreases .",
    "moreover , the exponential decay lengths in the tunneling regime are different in the presence and in the absence of oxygen .",

    "this trend can be understood by re - examining the evolution of the energy dependence of the transmission upon stretching ( fig .",
    "[ fig : transmissionox ] ) .",
    "thus for instance , the increase of the conductance originates from the fact that the highest occupied molecular orbitals move close to the fermi energy .",
    "quantitatively the conductance depends on the number of oxygen atoms in the molecule .",

    "physically , the value of @xmath54 is determined by the shape of the potential barrier between the tips , especially its apparent height with respect to @xmath24 ( ref .  ) .",
    "the barrier depends sensitively on the electronic structure of the junction , including the charge - transfer effects between the different atoms close to the tips . in terms of the local - basis picture ,",
    "all this information is contained in the spectral functions of the tips and the hopping matrix elements connecting them .",
    "the mathematical details of this interpretation are discussed further in app .",
    "[ app.a ] . in this picture , an important role",
    "is played by the radial decay properties of the orbitals of the tip atoms that are relevant for transport .",
    "roughly speaking , for o these orbitals are the 2@xmath51 ones , while for al they are of the 3@xmath58 and 3@xmath51 type .",
    "the former orbitals decay faster and thus it is reasonable that inverse decay length @xmath54 is larger in the presence of oxygen .",
