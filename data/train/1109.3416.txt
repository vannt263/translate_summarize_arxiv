    "the fenna - matthews - olson ( fmo ) protein is one of the simplest and most well - studied light harvesting systems .",
    "the protein complex exists as a trimer of three identical subunits whose function is to link the chlorosome antenna complex , where light - harvesting takes place , with the reaction center , where charge separation occurs .",
    "fmo is also one of the earliest light harvesting systems for which a high resolution crystal structure has been obtained.@xcite this early crystal structure indicated that each of the three fmo subunits contains seven bacteriochlorophyll ( bchl ) chromophores which serve as the primary energy transfer pathway between the chlorosome and the reaction center.@xcite recently , however , a more careful crystallographic analysis of of fmo has been performed which demonstrates that the individual subunits contain eight bchls , not seven.@xcite the eighth bchl resides on the surface of the protein complex and it has been suggested that this additional chromophore is often lost during sample preparation .    from an energy transfer perspective , the presence of an additional chromophore may challenge current understanding of how exciton transfer occurs in fmo .",
    "for example , in many previous studies on the seven bchl complex , it is thought that two nearly independent energy transfer pathways exist.@xcite sites one and six are approximately equidistant from the antenna complex and both are assumed to be possible locations for accepting the excitation from the chlorosome . from there , the energy is subsequently funneled either from site one to two ( pathway 1 ) or from site six to sites seven , five , and four ( pathway 2 ) . the terminal point through either route",
    "is site three where the exciton is then transferred to the reaction center ( see  fig .  [",
    "fig : energy_diagram](a ) ) .",
    "the couplings within each of the pathways are much larger than the couplings between the two which implies that the two routes are nearly independent.@xcite in the second paper of this series , the two pathways and the respective probability of traversing each have been quantified using a flux analysis.@xcite    however , this two pathway picture is not entirely consistent with the recent experimental data .",
    "the new crystal structure indicates that the eighth chromophore resides roughly midway between the baseplate and the bchl at site one.@xcite additionally , renger and coworkers argued in ref .   that the eighth bchl provides the most efficient path for exciton injection into fmo as a result of its position and orientation with respect to the chlorosome .",
    "if this is correct and site eight serves as the primary acceptor of excitation energy from the chlorosome , then a preferential energy transfer route emerges through pathway 1 . due to the weak inter - pathway couplings , the secondary channel involving the remaining four chromophores in pathway 2 is largely bypassed in this scheme .",
    "this observation may have a significant impact on the efficiency and robustness of the energy transfer process .",
    "the main objective of this work is to address this issue by exploring how the dynamics and the energy transfer efficiency in fmo are affected by the presence of the eighth site and a realistic environment .",
    "the first major conclusion of the present study is related to the population dynamics in fmo . in many of the the previous studies of the seven site model of fmo ,",
    "the population relaxation dynamics are modeled with site one or site six initially populated.@xcite under either of these initial conditions , pronounced oscillations in the short - time dynamics are observed .",
    "however when site eight is initially excited,@xcite then the oscillations in the populations are completely suppressed .",
    "this lack of oscillations has been independently observed in the dynamics recently reported in refs .  .",
    "here , we provide a simple explanation for this behavior .",
    "the eighth bchl maintains a large energy gap with the other seven sites in fmo in order to facilitate efficient directed energy transport .",
    "however , it is also rather weakly coupled to the remaining bchls .",
    "this leads to a slow incoherent decay of the initial population at site eight , and hence a broad distribution of initial conditions at the dimer .",
    "the consequence of this result is that the population oscillations generally observed between sites one and two are completely suppressed which illustrates the importance of the initial conditions on the dynamics of the dimer .",
    "the second key result of this work demonstrates that if the eighth bchl is the primary acceptor of excitation energy from the chlorosome as recently proposed then a primary energy transfer pathway in fmo does indeed emerge.@xcite note that this situation is substantially different from the previous interpretations of the energy flow in the seven site models where two independent pathways are generally assumed to exist . the extent of this effect and its impact on the energy transfer efficiency is quantified by introducing reduced models of fmo that consist of only a subset of the sites in the full system .",
    "it is demonstrated that sites eight , one , two and three which constitute pathway 1 provide the largest contribution to the dynamics of the full system .",
    "the remaining four sites of pathway 2 are seen to play a relatively small role . despite the fact that only a single pathway dominates the energy transfer process",
    ", we also show that the presence of the extra bchl does not significantly impact the efficiency or robustness of fmo .",
    "the eight site model leads to only a slight increase in the transfer time as compared with the seven site system , and thus maintains the same high efficiency as observed in previous studies of fmo .    based upon energetic arguments",
    ", it has been suggested that the presence of the eighth bchl leads to optimal energy transfer in fmo.@xcite that is , its location near the chlorosome allows for a large coupling to the antenna complex as well as substantial overlap of the absorption spectrum of the eighth bchl with the fluorescence spectrum of the chlorosome .",
    "these factors result in efficient transfer of the excitation energy into fmo while simultaneously allowing the eighth chromophore to maintain a large energy gap with the remaining bchls and hence a favorable energy transport landscape .",
    "these features implicitly suggest that there should be an optimal value of the site energy of the eighth bchl .",
    "here it is demonstrated that this observation is correct .",
    "however , in this case , the behavior is independent of the presence of the chlorosome , and can be understood by considering a further reduction pathway 1 to only three sites .",
    "the result of this procedure is a downhill configuration of three equally spaced sites ( see  fig .",
    "[ fig : energy_diagram](c ) ) which is known to allow for highly efficient energy transfer.@xcite    recently , several studies have shown that the environment does not have an entirely destructive role in the energy transport properties of excitonic systems.@xcite instead , the environment can serve to enhance both the efficiency and robustness of the energy transfer process .",
    "optimal values have been shown to exist for the temperature as well as other bath parameters which maximize the energy transfer efficiency in several light harvesting systems . moreover , the experimentally fitted model parameters for fmo are near optimal in many cases .",
    "an extensive search for the optimal environmental parameters has been recently presented in refs .   and  .",
    "in addition to the above findings , we also explore the effect of the eighth bchl on the environmentally assisted energy transport properties in fmo .",
    "it is found that the optimal values of the bath parameters are similar to those found in the seven site model , but are closer to the experimental values in general . as has been observed before",
    ", the energy transfer efficiency is relatively stable over a broad range parameters illustrating the robustness of the network.@xcite    in the next section , we present the average trapping time formalism which is used in the remainder of the discussion as a measure of the energy transfer efficiency.@xcite this is followed by a brief outline of the generalized bloch - redfield ( gbr ) approach and the model hamiltonian for the eight site fmo complex used in the numerical calculations .",

    "[ sec : results ] .",

    "effectively this results in the addition of traps at sites one and two and thus leads to the population decay of the dimer . without this decay ,",
    "the two - site dynamics reproduce those of ref .  .",
    "as has been alluded to previously , the lack of oscillations in the dimer when the initial population is located at site eight may be explained by creating a distribution of initial conditions at site one .",

    "assuming that site eight decays only into site one , then the population of the latter is given by @xmath59 , and the corresponding transition rate is @xmath60 .",
    "the influence of site eight on the oscillatory behavior of the dimer can then be captured by convoluting the dynamics given in  fig .",

    "[ fig : p_site ] and those of ref .",

    "regardless of the presence or absence of oscillations , it is readily seen from  fig .",
    "[ fig : p_site](a )  and  ( b ) that the population primarily flows through pathway 1 . among the sites in pathway 2 , only site four ever accumulates more than ten percent of the population . particularly for times less",
    "than @xmath65 fs , the sites from pathway 2 are scarcely populated . similar behavior of the population dynamics has been seen in many other simulations of the seven site model for fmo.@xcite these observations lead to the first reduced model for fmo which consists of only the four sites in pathway one shown in  fig .  [ fig : energy_diagram](b ) . as demonstrated below",
    ", this model is able to accurately capture the key features of the energy transfer process .",
    "one may proceed further by noting that sites one and two are coupled more strongly than the energy difference between the two .",
    "additionally , sites eight and three are widely separated from either site in the dimer .",
    "the couplings between the distant sites and dimer are also rather weak ( see values in the model hamiltonian in eq .  [",
    "eq : ham ] and  fig .",
    "[ fig : energy_diagram](b ) ) . as a result",
    ", there can be rapid coherent energy transfer between sites one and two , whereas the transfer to sites eight or three will be comparatively slow . therefore",
    ", when the initial population is located at site eight we may simply assume that these two sites of the dimer behave as one effective site with an energy that is the average of the two ( @xmath66 @xmath41 ) .",
    "a similar `` mean state '' idea for developing this type of reduced model has been suggested in ref .   which explores the behavior of a dimer embedded in the pc645 photosynthetic network .",
    "furthermore , the coupling between site eight and the terminal site , three , is negligibly small .",

    "of the remaining sites in  fig .",
    "[ fig : p_site ] , site four was seen to have the largest impact on the population relaxation .",

    "<S> first , it is shown that the oscillations that are often observed in the population relaxation of the dimer composed of sites one and two may be completely suppressed in the eight site model . </S>",
    "<S> the presence of the coherent oscillations is shown to depend upon the particular initial preparation of the dimer state . </S>",
    "<S> secondly it is demonstrated that while the presence of the eighth chromophore does not cause a dramatic change in the energy transfer efficiency , it does however lead to a dominant energy transfer pathway which can be characterized by an effective three site system arranged in an equally - spaced downhill configuration . </S>",
    "<S> such a configuration leads to an optimal value of the site energy of the eighth chromophore which is shown to be near to its suggested value . </S>",
    "<S> finally we confirm that the energy transfer process in the eight site fmo complex remains efficient and robust . </S>",
