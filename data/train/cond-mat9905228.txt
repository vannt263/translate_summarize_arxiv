    "the discovery of the first inorganic spin - peierls ( sp ) compound cugeo@xmath3 ( ref .  ) has triggered subsequent studies of the impurity - substitution effect on the spin - singlet states , @xcite and the existence of the disorder - induced transition into three - dimensional antiferromagnetic ( 3d - af ) state has been established .",
    "@xcite since the relevant exchange energies , i.e. , intra- and interchain coupling @xmath6 and @xmath7 , do not change with doping except at the impurity sites , it is difficult to understand the impurity - induced transition from the sp to 3d - af state in the framework of the conventional \" competition between dimensionalities ( where @xmath8 is an essential parameter @xcite ) and therefore such impurity - substitution effect is a matter of current interest .    in cugeo@xmath3 , a small amount of impurity leads to an exotic low - temperature phase where the lattice dimerization and antiferromagnetic staggered moments simultaneously appear [ dimerized af ( d - af ) phase ] .",
    "@xcite moreover , when the impurity concentration @xmath9 exceeds a critical concentration @xmath10 , the sp transition measured by dc susceptibility disappears @xcite and a uniform af ( u - af ) phase appears below the nel temperature @xmath11 @xmath12 4  k. @xcite the d - af ground state can be understood as a state of spatially modulated staggered moments accompanied with the lattice distortion .",
    "@xcite however , the mechanism of the depression of the sp phase and the establishment of the disorder - induced antiferromagnetism are still to be elucitated .",
    "a transport measurement could be a desirable tool in dealing with such a problem , because the mobility of spin excitations or spin diffusivity is often sensitive to the impurities .",
    "nevertheless , even a crude estimation of the mobility has not been carried out for the spin excitations so far .",
    "recently , we reported intriguing behaviors of the thermal conductivity @xmath0 of pure cugeo@xmath3 .",
    "@xcite in ref .  , the existence of the spin heat channel ( @xmath13 ) was suggested .",
    "however , we can not separate @xmath13 and the phonon thermal conductivity @xmath14 with the measurement of the pure sample only . in this work",
    ", we have resolved this problem with mg - doped crystals .",
    "it turned out that the spin diffusion length , which can be calculated from @xmath13 , is much larger than the distance between adjacent spins for the pure cugeo@xmath3 , indicating coherent heat transport due to the spin excitations .",
    "since the spin heat transport almost disappears for the heavily doped samples in which the long - range sp ordering is absent , it is suggested that the large mobility of the spin excitations plays an important role in the sp ordering .",
    "the spin heat transport is also a probe of the spin gap .",
    "it is found that local spin - gap opening is robust against the impurity doping , though the temperature of the long - range ordering is strongly suppressed with @xmath9 .",
    "phonon heat channel ( @xmath14 ) provides an unusual thermal conductivity peak in the sp state , which was one of the topics of our previous report.@xcite the peak is drastically suppressed with both magnetic field and mg - doping , indicating that the spin - gap opening has produced the peak in @xmath14 via strong phonon - spin interaction .",
    "the single crystals of cu@xmath1mg@xmath2geo@xmath3 were grown with a floating - zone method .",
    "the mg concentration is determined by inductively coupled plasma - atomic emission spectroscopy ( icp - aes ) .",
    "@xcite the critical concentration @xmath10 was carefully determined by masuda _",
    "et al . _ for the same series of crystals that we have used . @xcite",
    "they found that the nel temperature @xmath11 jumps at the impurity - driven transition from d - af to u - af phase and that phase is separated in the transition range of @xmath15 , indicating that the transition is of first order.@xcite we used six samples with @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 for the thermal conductivity measurement .",
    "they were originally prepared for the neutron and the synchrotron x - ray experiments , and thus the sample homogeneity has been confirmed in detail which is described elsewhere.@xcite typical sample size is 0.2 @xmath19 2 @xmath19 7 mm@xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) . since our interest is thermal conductivity along the 1d spin chain , we need the sample with a longer dimension along the @xmath22 axis .",
    "thus we payed particular attention to the mg homogeneity along the @xmath22 axis for this study , and the best way is to use the samples prepared for the neutron experiments .",
    "the fundamental magnetic properties of the samples used already appeared in another paper.@xcite    the thermal conductivity is measured using a one heater , two thermometers \" method as the previous measurement.@xcite the base of the sample is anchored to a copper block held at desired temperatures .",
    "a strain - gauge heater is used to heat the sample . a matched pair of microchip cernox thermometers are carefully calibrated and then mounted on the sample .",
    "the maximum temperature difference between the sample and the block is 0.2  k. typical temperature difference between the two thermometers is @xmath120.5  k above 20  k and 0.2  k below 20  k. the temperature - controlled block is covered with a metal shield so that heat loss through radiation becomes negligible .",
    "magnetic field is applied parallel to the @xmath22-axis direction .",
    "the measured temperature range is below 30  k , which is well below the temperature scale of the intra - chain coupling @xmath23 ( @xmath12  120  k according to neutron scattering measurement @xcite ) , and therefore , the one - dimensional quantum spin liquid ( 1d - qsl ) is realized above the transition temperatures .",
    "figure  1 shows the temperature dependence of @xmath0 for samples with and without mg substitution : 1(a)-1(f ) are for @xmath24 , 0.0216 , 0.0244 , 0.032 and 0.040 , respectively .",

    "the transition temperatures @xmath30 for the @xmath31 samples and @xmath11 for the @xmath18 samples , which were determined by susceptibility measurement , @xcite are indicated by arrows in the figures .",
    "a sharp drop is observed just below @xmath30 for the pure cugeo@xmath3 as presented in the inset of fig .",

    "1(e ) and 1(f ) , a slight change in the curvature is observed at @xmath11 and the field dependence in the nel state is opposite to that above @xmath11 ; @xmath0 decreases with field below @xmath11 while @xmath0 increases with field above @xmath11 .",
    "the three - dimensional magnon excitations , which appear in the nel state , are responsible for this behavior .",
    "the thermal conductivity in u - af phase will be further discussed elsewhere.@xcite although the nel transition ( to d - af phase ) should be present also for the @xmath31 samples , we can not identify the corresponding feature at the transition , because @xmath11 ( @xmath33  k ) @xcite is too close to the lower temperature limit of our measurement , @xmath12  2  k.    taking a look at the full scale of each figure , one can notice that @xmath0 is strongly suppressed with mg substitution in the whole temperature range .",
    "two thermal conductivity peaks are present in the zero - field curve of fig .",
    "1(a ) ; one is in the sp phase and the other is in the 1d - qsl state .",
    "the broad shape of the high - temperature peak is maintained with doping . on the other hand ,",
    "the low - temperature peak ( sp peak ) diminishes with @xmath34 , and disappears for the @xmath18 samples .",
    "the sp peak is suppressed also in magnetic fields [ figs .",
    "1(a)-1(d ) ] .",
    "in order to see the field dependence in more detail , the thermal conductivity at the sp peak is plotted as a function of magnetic field in fig .  2 for the @xmath16 sample .",
    "@xmath0 is suppressed with magnetic field and suddenly drops at the threshold field , @xmath35 , at which the system makes a transition to the incommensurate phase .",
    "the same features were observed in our previous measurement with the crystal grown by the laser - heated pedestal growth technique.@xcite also , the typical value of @xmath0 , for example at the high - temperature peak , is almost the same as that of the previous result .",
    "we thus believe that the above features are intrinsic in this material regardless of the growth method of the crystal , as long as high quality single crystal is used.@xcite    , demonstrating the suppression of the low - temperature peak with field application . ]    in a temperature range close to @xmath30 , @xmath0 _ increases _ with field for the mg - doped samples , while little field dependence is seen in the pure sample [ figs .",
    "1(a)-1(d ) ] .",
    "note that the field dependence extends even above @xmath30 for the mg - doped samples .",
    "the variation in the field dependence implies qualitative difference of the sp transition between pure cugeo@xmath3 and doped cugeo@xmath3 . this field dependence is apparent also in the @xmath28 sample , which is above @xmath10 [ fig .",
    "1(e ) ] , but rapidly diminishes in the heavily doped sample [ fig .",
    "cugeo@xmath3 is an insulator and heat conduction by electrons or holes is absent unlike metals . instead",
    ", low - energy spin excitations@xcite can carry heat . in the 1d - qsl state , total @xmath0",
    "is given by a sum of @xmath13 and @xmath14 as , @xmath36 in contrast , @xmath13 is suppressed at the lowest temperature region in sp phase because few spin excitations are present due to the spin gap , and the total @xmath0 represents a phonon contribution only , @xmath37 the field and impurity dependence of @xmath14 below @xmath4 will be discussed in subsection a. the value of @xmath13 in 1d - qsl will be crudely estimated in subsection b. finally , the problem of local spin - gap formation will be dealt with in subsection c , using this @xmath13 as a probe .",
    "since the low - temperature peak is drastically suppressed with the application of field as shown in figs .  1 and 2 , the feature should be related to the spin - excitation spectrum .",
    "we have proposed the following explanation for this peak.@xcite at temperatures well below @xmath4 , where low - energy spin excitations are negligible , heat is carried mostly by phonons and @xmath14 increases with temperature because of the growing population of phonons like usual insulating crystals . with increasing temperature , the increasing number of thermally excited spin excitations scatter phonons , and @xmath14 diminishes . as a result",
    ", the thermal conductivity peak shows a peak .",
    "although the thermal spin excitations begin to carry heat , the increase in @xmath13 appears only in the temperature region slightly below @xmath4 [ see inset in fig .",
    "1(a ) ] .    in order to confirm the above understanding , the impurity substitution is helpful because the spin gap is absent in heavily substituted samples .",
    "we normalized the size of the peak for each sample as @xmath0(5  k)/@xmath0(15  k ) , and plotted it against @xmath9 in fig .",
    "one can see the suppression of the peak with @xmath9 similarly to the case of field application ( fig .  2 ) .",
    "moreover , the peak disappears at the concentration @xmath18 where the long - range sp order no longer exists , as shown in figs .",
    "1(e ) and 1(f ) .",
    "we have thus confirmed the correlation between spin gap and the peak also by mg substitution , giving the additional evidence for the scenario described in the previous paragraph .",
    "( 5  k)/@xmath0(15  k ) , is plotted against mg - concentration . a suppression of the peak with",
    "mg doping is evident . ]    the @xmath27 sample , which is on the border from sp ( d - af ) to u - af demonstrates enhancement of @xmath0 below @xmath38 , as observed in fig .",
    "since the enhancement is suppressed in magnetic fields , the existence of a well - defined spin gap is suggested even at @xmath39 .",
    "we can notice the rapid change in @xmath13 in the ( low - temperature ) vicinity of @xmath4 , which is another sign of the spin - gap opening , for the @xmath16 and 0.016 samples [ figs .",
    "1(a ) and 1(b ) ] .",
    "however , this feature is absent for the @xmath26 and 0.0244 samples [ figs .",
    "1(c ) and 1(d ) ] , since @xmath13 is significantly reduced with @xmath9 because of impurity scattering .    figure",
    "4(a ) shows the zero - field thermal conductivity of all the samples .",
    "the thermal conductivity is strongly suppressed with mg - substitution in the whole measured temperature range .",
    "the @xmath9 dependence of @xmath0 below @xmath12  4  k can be understood as the difference in the scattering rate of phonons . since we showed in ref .",
    "that the scattering by planer defects is dominant for the @xmath16 sample , difference in the number of planer defects may cause the variation of @xmath14 in our series of samples .",
    "the number of planer defects does not necessarily increase with increasing @xmath9 ; note that @xmath0 in the @xmath28 sample is smaller than that in the @xmath29 sample below @xmath12  5  k.    mg@xmath2geo@xmath3 single crystals .",
    "( b ) the thermal conductivity at 17.5 k as a function of mg concentration .",
    "the spin - peierls temperatures measured by dc susceptibility are plotted together . ]      remembering the origin of the low-@xmath40 thermal conductivity peak , we can notice that scattering by the spin excitations , in turn , becomes dominant in @xmath14 above the peak temperature for the @xmath31 samples .",
    "noting that all the @xmath41 curves looks parallel to one another above @xmath12  15  k , @xmath14 in the @xmath18 samples should probably have a temperature dependence similar to that in the @xmath25 , 0.0216 and 0.0244 samples above @xmath12  15  k. therefore , it is expected that phonon heat transport is governed by the spin - scattering also for the @xmath18 samples , at least above @xmath12  15  k.    in contrast to rather complicated temperature dependence below @xmath4 , @xmath42 in the 1d - qsl region is simpler , which is an advantage of discussing @xmath9 dependence in the region . as a crude approximation , it is assumed that the phonon part is not so much @xmath9 dependent and that most of the @xmath9-dependence comes from @xmath13 , because the detailed characterization @xcite guarantees good homogeneity in both pure and mg - doped crystals and the direct modification in the phonon modes due to the mg substitution can be estimated to be negligible .",
    "the scattering rate of phonons due to the point defects is more than two orders of magnitude smaller than the total scattering rate.@xcite one may notice that the robustness of @xmath14 to the mg - doping is natural , considering that phonons are mainly scattered by spin excitations above @xmath12  15  k , which is the conclusion of the previous paragraph . since the population of both phonons and spin excitations does not change so much with @xmath9 in the temperature range above @xmath4 , as has been reported in specific heat results , @xcite @xmath9 dependence of @xmath14 is expected to be small in the 1d - qsl state.@xcite    figure  4(b ) shows the @xmath9 dependence of @xmath0 at 17.5 k. @xmath0 rapidly decreases with @xmath9 up to @xmath10 , and it saturates when @xmath9 exceeds @xmath10 .",
    "therefore , it is naturally assumed that @xmath13 is close to zero in the heavily doped samples with @xmath9 @xmath43 @xmath10 .",
    "this result suggests some correlation between the mobility of the spin excitations and the sp ordering .",
    "following the above interpretation , it is possible to estimate @xmath13 by subtracting @xmath0 of the @xmath29 sample from the measured @xmath0 for each sample .",
    "the result indicates that most part of the @xmath0 of pure cugeo@xmath3 is due to @xmath13 , which is approximately 0.4  w / cm k at 17.5  k. this gives the diffusivity of the spin excitations @xmath44 of @xmath121.6@xmath1910@xmath45  m@xmath46/s , if we assume @xmath47 @xmath121.8  j / mol k.@xcite @xmath44 in 1d systems can be written as @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the velocity of the spin excitations and @xmath50 is the mean free path , in other words , the spin diffusion length . assuming the spin - wave like dispersion given by des cloizeaux and pearson @xcite @xmath51=(@xmath52)@xmath53 and @xmath23 @xmath12 120  k , @xcite one can evaluate @xmath49 @xmath12 ( @xmath54)@xmath55/@xmath56= 1.3@xmath1910@xmath57  m / s and @xmath50 @xmath12 130  nm ( @xmath51 is the energy of the spin excitations",
    ", @xmath58 is the wave vector and @xmath22 ( @xmath12 0.3  nm ) is the distance between adjacent spins ) .",
    "note that the spin diffusion length of the same order of magnitude was obtained from the nmr relaxation measurement for another 1d spin system , agvp@xmath59s@xmath60.@xcite    since @xmath61  430 is much larger than unity , we can conclude that the spin heat transport for the pure cugeo@xmath3 is coherent .",
    "if the same estimation is applied also to the mg - doped samples , @xmath61 100 for the @xmath25 ( @xmath62 ) and @xmath61 50 even for @xmath39 at this temperature .",
    "since @xmath63 is approximately calculated as 40 , the above estimation indicates that the spin diffusion length in the 1d - qsl state exceeds the mean impurity distance @xmath64 , as long as @xmath9 is less than @xmath10 . whereas , the spin excitations are not so mobile when @xmath18 .",
    "figure  5 shows @xmath65 ( @xmath66 @xmath67 ) of the three mg - doped samples which have sp transition .",
    "one can find that @xmath67 is almost temperature independent above @xmath5 @xmath12 15  k and that @xmath67 of all the samples deviates from this temperature - independent value below @xmath5 .",
    "since @xmath5 is close to @xmath4 of the pure cugeo@xmath3 , the deviation can be attributed to a precursor of the sp transition .",
    "note that similar behavior is observed in the raman scattering measurement on zn- and si - dopd cugeo@xmath3 .",

    "@xcite the authors claimed that the long - range order takes place only below @xmath69 and that lattice dimerization is short - range just below @xmath38.@xcite the gap - like feature in @xmath0 is also to be explained along the idea of the short - range order ( sro ) .",

    "5 suggests that sro grows from @xmath5 @xmath12 15  k , which is even above @xmath70 .",
    "the field dependence of @xmath0 is a strong indication of the presence of the sro below @xmath5 .",

    "the results are consistent with the notion that the reduction of @xmath67 below @xmath5 is due to the development of the local spin gap . since the magnetic field",

    "magnetic fields are applied along the chain direction . ]",
    "it should be emphasized that the heat transport by spin excitations is very sensitive to the spin - peierls sro .",

    "@xcite for the @xmath29 sample , however , there was no evidence that sp - sro actually develops .",

    "we think that the difference of a length scale of probed area between the two measurement techniques causes such discrepancy .",
    "the above results tell us that the impurity - substitution modifies the ground state and suppresses the spin - peierls ordering in cugeo@xmath3 system through different mechanisms . the importance of the inter - chain coupling and the tendency to the 3d - antiferromagnetism increases below @xmath73 . as a result",

    "examining the @xmath9 dependence of the spin - gap features , it turned out that the local spin gap opens at a temperature ( @xmath5 ) independent of @xmath9 , suggesting that the suppression of sp ordering is attributed to the reduction of the spin diffusion due to the impurity scattering .",
    "it is expected that the above analysis of the impurity - substitution effect on the thermal conductivity is applicable to other one - dimensional spin systems and that thus obtained transport properties may reveal new aspects on such materials .",
    "we thank a. kapitulnik for helpful advices both on the experimental techniques and in understanding the results in the early stage of this project .",

    "considering the fact that the absolute value of @xmath0 is smaller compared to our result , the absence of the peak is probably because of larger defect - scattering of phonons in their crystals",

    "<S> the thermal conductivity @xmath0 is measured in a series of cu@xmath1mg@xmath2geo@xmath3 single crystals in magnetic fields up to 16  t. it has turned out that heat transport by spin excitations is coherent for lightly doped samples , in which the spin - peierls ( sp ) transition exists , at temperatures well above the sp transition temperature @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> depression of this spin heat transport appears below @xmath5 , at which the spin gap _ locally _ opens . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath5 is not modified with mg - doping and that @xmath5 for each mg - doped sample remains as high as @xmath4 of pure cugeo@xmath3 , in contrast to @xmath4 which is strongly suppressed with mg - doping . </S>",
    "<S> the spin - gap opening enhances phonon part of the heat transport because of reduced scattering by the spin excitations , producing an unusual peak . </S>",
    "<S> this peak diminishes when the spin gap is suppressed both in magnetic fields and with the mg - doping .    2 </S>"
