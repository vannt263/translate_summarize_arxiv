    "the quest for the origin of galaxies has been one of the main themes of observational cosmology for many years .",
    "a key aspect of this search is the identification of ` primeval ' galaxies  a somewhat lose concept given that we do nt know how galaxies form , but generally taken to mean the progenitors of galaxies like the milky way at the time when they first assembled a significant fraction of their mass and began forming their first generations of stars .",
    "until recently the search for primeval galaxies had been a highly frustrating affair with only a handful of objects , mostly discovered serendipitously or through gravitational lensing , as the meagre return for the investment of many months of observing time on large telescopes .",
    "this , we now realize , was due less to a lack of adequate instrumentation than to the fact that we did not know how to recognise what we were looking for .",
    "a typical deep ccd image obtained at the prime focus of a 4 m telescope shows some 3000 galaxies which are at distances stretching from the vicinity of the milky way to the most distant reaches of the universe , corresponding to look - back times of 90% of the age of the universe .",
    "thus , such a ccd image in principle contains much of the information required to identify the origin of galaxies and follow their evolution over most of the hubble time .",
    "the challenge until now has been to devise an efficient way to sort this multitude of galaxies according to their redshifts and ages and thereby identify the young counterparts of present day luminous galaxies .",
    "the situation has improved dramatically in the last two years and objects which conform closely to our ideas of a primeval galaxy are now being discovered routinely and in large numbers . in this conference contribution",
    "we give an account of these recent exciting developments .",
    "we first describe the method which has proved to be most profitable for identifying star forming galaxies at high redshifts .",
    "we then review some of the most significant properties of this population of objects , deduced from the analysis of their redshift distribution and their spectra .",
    "we end with some comments on future prospects , focussing in particular on the infrared spectral region and on the key role which the _ next generation space telescope _ will play in pushing this field of research to the earliest epochs .    before proceeding just one word of clarification .",
    "when dealing with distant galaxies astronomers normally refer to their redshift , because this is the quantity which is directly measured from the spectra .",
    "redshift , however , is only a proxy for look - back time ",
    "we are interested in how far in the past we observe a particular galaxy at redshift @xmath9 .",
    "the mapping of redshift to look - back time is not yet as accurate as we would like , although the precision in the measurement of the hubble constant has improved in the last few years . for reference ,",
    "table 1 gives the look - back times corresponding to values of redshift used most often in this review , adopting a hubble constant @xmath10  km  s@xmath11  mpc@xmath11 and a deceleration parameter for the expansion of the universe @xmath12 ( unless otherwise stated , these values are assumed throughout this article ) .",

    "the galaxies we see around us today exhibit a wide variety of shapes and sizes .",
    "approximately half the stars in the present day universe are found in ` old ' systems , elliptical galaxies and the bulges of spirals , which are collectively referred to as the spheroidal component of the galaxy population .",
    "the conventional view has been that these galaxies formed a long time ago , probably before @xmath16 , and relatively rapidly , whereas the assembly of the more fragile disks of spiral galaxies such as the milky way was presumably a slower and more protracted process . in this scenario",
    "one would expect the formation of ellipticals and bulges to be a period of intense star formation activity .",
    "star forming galaxies in our vicinity have very characteristic visible spectra . between 3500 and 7500   the spectra are dominated by strong , narrow emission lines of hydrogen , oxygen and nitrogen produced in the nebulae associated with newly formed massive stars .",
    "compared with these strong emission lines the underlying blue continuum radiation from the stars themselves is relatively faint . at redshift @xmath1 however , the portion of the spectrum recorded by an optical telescope is the rest - frame ultraviolet , between 1000 and 2000  .",
    "it was only natural that the first searches for galaxies at high redshift should have targeted , either spectroscopically or by narrow - band imaging , what was expected to be the strongest nebular emission line in the ultraviolet , the ly@xmath2  line of neutral hydrogen at a rest wavelength of 1215.67   . despite massive efforts , searches for ly@xmath2  emission at high redshift",
    "have generally been disappointing ( e.g. thompson , djorgovski , & trauger 1995 ) .",
    "it is only with the benefit of hindsight that we now fully appreciate how difficult it is for ly@xmath2  photons to escape the galaxy where they are produced , given the large cross - section for absorption and subsequent scattering by h  i atoms ( meier & terlevich 1981 ; neufeld 1991 ; charlot & fall 1993 ; valls - gabaud 1993 ) .",
    "the method which has turned out to be successful in finding normal galaxies at @xmath1 was developed by steidel & hamilton ( 1992 , 1993 ) and is based on the realization that the limit of the lyman series near 912   , the wavelength of photons with sufficient energy to ionise hydrogen , produces an obvious discontinuity in the far - uv spectrum of _ any _ star forming galaxy .",
    "this lyman ` break ' has a three - fold origin : the intrinsic drop in the spectra of hot o and b type stars which dominate the integrated spectrum at ultraviolet wavelengths ( e.g. cassinelli et al . 1995 ) ; the absorption by the neutral interstellar medium within a star forming galaxy ( leitherer et al .",
    "1995a ; gonzlez delgado et al .",
    "1997 ) ; and the opacity of the intervening intergalactic medium .",
    "this last effect , which has been quantified by madau ( 1995 ) from the well known statistics of qso absorption line spectra , turns out to be the overriding factor which determines the colour of high redshift galaxies .",
    "steidel & hamilton devised a three filter system optimised for selecting lyman break galaxies .",
    "two of the filters , @xmath17 and @xmath18 in their notation , have passbands respectively below and above the lyman limit at @xmath1 , while the third filter , @xmath19 , is further to the red . in deep images of the sky taken through these three filters @xmath1",
    "galaxies are readily distinguished from the bulk of lower redshift objects by their red @xmath20 and blue @xmath21 colours .",
    "as can be seen from figure 1 , high redshift galaxies fall in a well - defined region of the colour - colour plot , irrespective of their spectroscopic type . in the survey which followed the initial observations by steidel & hamilton ( 1992 ) , we designated objects with @xmath22 and @xmath23 ( that is with colours within the dotted lines in figure 1 ) as ` robust ' candidates for high redshift galaxies . in order to explore the boundary for high-@xmath9 galaxies in the two colour plane we also selected a number of ` marginal ' candidates , defined to be objects with @xmath22 and @xmath24 , that is objects falling in a strip half a magnitude wide in @xmath20 below the sloping line in figure 1 .",
    "follow - up spectroscopy with the keck telescopes has confirmed the efficiency of this photometric selection technique ( steidel et al .",
    "approximately 95% of the robust candidates are indeed high redshift galaxies , the remainder being mainly faint galactic stars . at the time of this conference ( may 1997 ) we have imaged approximately 800 square arcminutes of sky in a dozen fields .",
    "some of the fields are centred on high redshift qsos with known intervening lyman limit systems , while others are random pointings in areas which in some cases have also been imaged with the _ hubble space telescope_. at a limiting magnitude @xmath25 , which roughly corresponds to the magnitude of a galaxy like the milky way ( an @xmath26 galaxy ) at @xmath1 , the density of lyman break galaxies on the plane of the sky is @xmath27",
    "arcmin@xmath28 ( steidel , pettini , & hamilton 1995 ) , only @xmath29 of the surface density of _ all _ galaxies brighter than this limit .",
    "even so , a deep @xmath30 pixel ccd image recorded at the prime focus of the 5 m hale telescope at palomar will yield @xmath31 robust candidates , a vast improvement over the dearth of _ bona fide _ high redshift galaxies which persisted until a few years ago !",
    "figure 2 shows the redshift histogram of all the spectroscopically confirmed galaxies in our sample . clearly , the @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 filter system is most effective at selecting galaxies at redshifts @xmath32 . as described by piero madau",
    "( see figure 4 of his article in this volume ) the same lyman break technique has been applied to the @xmath33 images of the _ hubble deep field _ to identify galaxies at redshifts @xmath34 ( the @xmath35 drop - outs ) and @xmath36 ( @xmath37 drop - outs ) .",
    "an immediate bonus of an efficient photometric selection method is the ability to probe with the minimum of effort the three - dimensional distribution of the objects of interest . for lyman break galaxies at @xmath38",
    "there is the added advantage that the angular scales sampled map to comoving scales which are sufficiently large to be of interest .",
    "this is generally not the case for ` pencil beam ' surveys at lower redshifts which essentially give a one - dimensional view of clustering along the line of sight .",
    "the anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background tells us that seed fluctuations were present at the earliest times ; the extent to which these have grown after the first 15% of the age of the universe depends sensitively on the cosmological parameters and can therefore be used to discriminate between different world models .",
    "the first application of the lyman break technique to the study of large scale structure at high redshift has produced very exciting results and led to the discovery of a large concentration of galaxies at @xmath39 in one of our fields ( see figure 3 ) .",
    "our survey suggests that such ` spikes ' in redshift space were already common at these epochs and may well be examples of today s rich clusters of galaxies caught early in their evolution , when they were beginning to break away from the hubble expansion .",
    "one of our best observed regions of sky consists of two adjacent @xmath40  arcminute fields which we have imaged very deeply ( to a limiting @xmath41 surface brightness of 29  mag  arcsec@xmath28 in all three @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 passbands ) with the cosmic prime focus camera of the 5  m hale telescope at palomar observatory .",
    "the strip includes one of the hawaii deep fields designated ssa22 by cowie et al .",
    "( 1996 ) and overlaps with one of the canada - france redshift survey fields ( lilly et al .",
    "we find a total of 181 lyman break candidates ( robust and marginal ) brighter than @xmath42 in this area ; their distribution on the plane of the sky is shown in the right - hand panel of figure 4 .",
    "subsequent keck spectroscopy of a subset of the candidates confirmed that 67 of them are at @xmath43 ; of these , 15 galaxies and 1 qso fall within a redshift interval @xmath44 centred at @xmath45 .",
    "the comoving dimensions of this structure in an einstein - de sitter universe ( @xmath46 ) are at least @xmath47 by @xmath48  mpc in the transverse direction and @xmath49  mpc along the line of sight . on the basis of our sampling frequency",
    "we estimate that the concentration contains in excess of @xmath50 galaxies brighter than @xmath26 .",
    "the implications of having found such a strong clustering signal at @xmath1 are considered in detail by steidel et al .",
    "( 1997 ) in the context of cold dark matter theories for the growth of structure in the universe ( see david weinberg s review at this conference ) . after correcting for the effect of peculiar velocities ,",
    "the spike in the redshift histogram corresponds to an overdensity @xmath51 relative to the background distribution of mass on the scale of the structure ( @xmath52 is the fractional excess of galaxies which an observer in one of the galaxies in the spike would measure relative to the average of many such volumes ) .",
    "the probability of finding such an overdensity approaches unity only if galaxies are very biased tracers of mass ; we deduce values of the bias parameter @xmath53 for @xmath54 and as high as @xmath55 if @xmath46 .",
    "in cdm models of galaxy formation ( e.g. baugh et al . 1997 ) the first galaxies do indeed form in the highest density peaks and a high bias parameter is not unexpected at @xmath1 . since the more massive halos are more heavily biased ( mo & white 1996 ) , the characteristic mass associated with the lyman break galaxies can be deduced from the observed bias parameter ; the above values of @xmath56 point to dark halo masses @xmath6  @xmath7 .",
    "this is strong evidence in support of the view that in the lyman break objects we see the progenitors of today s luminous galaxies ( @xmath26 and brighter ) , rather than smaller fragments undergoing an intense and short - lived burst of star formation .",
    "one of the two qsos we have identified in our observations of the ssa22 , at redshift @xmath57 , lies _ behind _ the concentration of galaxies giving rise to the spike ( see figure 4 ) .",
    "it is very interesting to find that the spectrum of this qso shows absorption systems at the redshifts of the three most significant features in the histogram in figure 3 , @xmath58 , 3.09 , and 3.28 .",
    "the implication seems to be that diffuse gas with near - unity covering factor is associated with the structures we see in the large scale distribution of galaxies",
    ". the combination of absorption and emission techniques will be very powerful for studying the high redshift progenitors of rich clusters of galaxies .",
    "the sample of more than 200 ultraviolet spectra which we have assembled in our survey is a rich source of information on the physical properties of star forming galaxies at high redshift .",
    "the spectra show many similarities with those of nearby starburst galaxies ; accordingly our analysis draws extensively on the detailed studies of local starbursts carried out with the _ hst _ and described in tim heckman s article in this volume . here",
    "we focus in particular on : _ ( a ) _ the uv luminosities and implied star formation rates ; _ ( b ) _ evidence for the presence of dust and the corresponding uv extinction ; and _ ( c ) _",
    "ly@xmath2  emission and large - scale velocity fields in the interstellar medium . the signal - to - noise ratio of most of our spectra , although relatively modest , is nevertheless adequate for addressing all three topics . in addition , we have begun to study in detail a number of individual objects ( generally among the more luminous in the sample ) to which we have devoted long exposure times at moderately high spectral resolution .",
    "the best case is the @xmath59 galaxy 1512-cb58 ( yee et al .",
    "this spectrum ( reproduced in figure 5 ) is of comparable quality with the best _ hst _ spectra of local starburst galaxies and is a veritable mine of information .",
    "it now seems highly likely that cb58 , which is @xmath60 magnitudes brighter than the typical @xmath1 galaxy in our survey , is not extraordinarily luminous but gravitationally lensed ( williams & lewis 1997 ; seitz et al .",
    "1997 ) and therefore presumably provides us with an unusually clear view of a normal galaxy at high redshift .",
    "the typical high-@xmath9 galaxy in our survey , with @xmath61 , ( @xmath62 ) = 0.5 , and @xmath1 , has a far - uv luminosity @xmath63 erg  s@xmath11  @xmath11 at 1500   .",
    "it is instructive to compare this value with those measured in nearby starbursts .",
    "the uv luminosities we find at @xmath1 are @xmath64 times greater than that of the brightest star cluster in the irregular galaxy ngc  4214 studied with _",
    "hst _ by leitherer et al .",

    "( 16.5,16.5 ) = 16.5 cm    -9 cm    the ultraviolet spectra , in which we see the integrated continuum of o and early b stars , can in principle be used to estimate the star formation rate in a more direct way than the balmer lines , which are produced by the reprocessed ionizing radiation of the stars at the very tip of the imf . adopting a continuous star formation model with an age greater than @xmath67  years and a salpeter imf from 0.1 to 100  @xmath7(bruzual & charlot 1996 ; leitherer , robert , & heckman 1995b )",
    ", the typical @xmath63 erg  s@xmath11  @xmath11 corresponds to a star formation rate _ sfr _",
    "@xmath68  @xmath7  yr@xmath11 . this is probably a lower limit , since dust extinction ( see below ) and a lower age would both raise this value ( for an age of @xmath69  years the implied _ sfr _ is greater by a factor of @xmath70 ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that even the brightest objects in our sample fall well within the surface brightness distribution of local starbursts .",
    "the highest values of @xmath71 which we have found are @xmath72 times higher than the median . adopting a typical extinction correction of a factor of @xmath73 at 1500    ( see below ) and a typical half - light radius @xmath74  kpc ( giavalisco , steidel , & macchetto 1996 ) , we arrive at a star formation intensity ( _ sfr _ per unit area ) @xmath75  @xmath7  yr@xmath11  kpc@xmath28 .",
    "this value compares well with the upper envelope of the ultraviolet sample considered by meurer et al .",
    "thus , the star forming galaxies which we are finding at high redshift appear to be spatially more extended versions of the local starburst phenomenon . the same physical processes which limit the maximum star formation intensity in nearby starbursts , as discussed by meurer et al .",
    ", also seem to be at play in young galaxies at high redshift which may well be undergoing their first episodes of star formation .",
    "dust is a ubiquitous component of the interstellar medium ; given that galaxies at @xmath1 are obviously already enriched in heavy elements , it is likely that some dust is mixed with the gas and stars we observe .",
    "unfortunately , even relatively small amounts of dust can have a significant effect in the rest - frame ultraviolet and thereby alter our view of high-@xmath9 galaxies .",
    "in particular , dust will : _ ( a ) _ extinguish resonantly scattered emission lines , most notably ly@xmath2 ; _ ( b ) _ attenuate the uv continuum leading to underestimates of the star formation rate ; and _ ( c ) _ redden the broad spectral energy distribution so that it resembles that of an older stellar population .",
    "to some extent we have to learn to live with these problems because of the inherent uncertainties of any dust corrections which arise mostly from the unknown shape of the extinction law .",
    "the intrinsic slope of the integrated uv continuum of a star forming galaxy is a robust quantity which , as explained for example by calzetti ( 1997a ) , varies little with the exact shape of the imf or the age of the starburst .",
    "spectral synthesis models show that the continuum between 1200 and 1800   is well approximated by a power law of the form @xmath76 with @xmath2 between @xmath77 and 0 .",
    "similarly , the empirical template starburst spectrum constructed by calzetti ( 1997b ) has @xmath78 .",
    "in contrast , the galaxies we observe generally have uv spectral slopes between 0 and @xmath79 ; the spectrum of cb58 reproduced in figure 5 , for example , can be clearly seen to be redder than flat spectrum and has @xmath80 .",
    "such ( relatively ) red spectra can result from an aging starburst or from an imf lacking in massive stars , but we regard both possibilities as unlikely because with sufficiently high s / n we see directly the spectral signatures of o stars .",
    "the most straightforward interpretation , in analogy with local starbursts , is that the spectra are reddened by dust extinction",
    ".    in figure 6 , reproduced from dickinson et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , we use the ( @xmath62 ) colours of the entire sample of spectroscopically confirmed galaxies to estimate dust corrections to the star formation rates at high redshift . assuming an intrinsic spectral slope @xmath81 , as is the case for a bruzual & charlot ( 1996 ) model with 1  gyr old continuous star formation and salpeter imf , the curves labelled with different values of @xmath82 at the top of the figure show the predicted ( @xmath62 ) colour as a function of redshift , if the spectra of high-@xmath9 galaxies are reddened with an extinction law similar to that which applies to stars in the small magellanic cloud .",
    "the curves all rise to redder ( @xmath62 ) colour with redshift due to the increasing line blanketing by the ly@xmath2  forest ( madau 1995 ) .",
    "the difference between the observed and predicted ( @xmath62 ) colour yields the extinction at 1500   , @xmath83 , appropriate to each galaxy ; by adding together the individual values for all the galaxies in the sample dickinson et al .",

    "colours _ bluer _ than the @xmath69 year curve in figure 6 .",
    "ly@xmath2  emission line contamination may play a role for some , particularly for the most deviant object labelled `` g2 '' which is an agn with strong line emission .",
    "differences by @xmath87  mag can easily be explained by photometric errors and the stochastic nature of the ly@xmath2  forest blanketing . ] adopting the @xmath69 year model as the unreddened template leads to corrections to the global star formation rate by factors of 3.5 and 6.3 , for the smc and calzetti et al .",
    "extinction laws respectively . however , we consider it very unlikely that _ most _ lyman break galaxies are @xmath88 year old bursts , given that their number density and their masses are roughly comparable to those of present day @xmath26 galaxies ( steidel et al .",
    "1995 , 1997 ) .",
    "we conclude that the likely dust correction to the integrated ultraviolet luminosity of lyman break galaxies at @xmath1 amounts to a factor of @xmath5",
    ". the correction could be as low as @xmath89 and as high as @xmath90 , depending on the age of the stellar population and on the wavelength dependence of the ultraviolet extinction . as discussed in section 5 below , in the few cases where we have detected the redshifted h@xmath3  emission line in lyman break galaxies , the line flux we measure confirms the relatively low values of ultraviolet extinction deduced by dickinson et al .",

    "the plot in figure 7 is generally taken to indicate a peak in star formation between @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "this conclusion probably still holds once dust is taken into account , although the corrections appropriate to galaxies in the _ cfrs _ ( lilly et al .",
    "1995b ) have yet to be determined .",
    "since the values of @xmath91 from the _ cfrs _ survey are based on galaxy luminosities in the near - uv ( 2800   ) , the same amount of dust as we deduced for the lyman break galaxies would result in an upward correction by a factor of @xmath89 ( open circles in figure 7 )",

    "there are strong indications that the main reason for the weakness of ly@xmath2  emission is resonant scattering in an outflowing interstellar medium . when detected , the emission line is generally redshifted by up to several hundred km  s@xmath11 relative to the interstellar absorption lines and , in the best observed cases , its profile is clearly asymmetric .",

    "this is comparable to the mass of the milky way bulge ( dwek et al .",
    "1995 ) and to the dynamical mass within the central @xmath112  kpc of an @xmath26 elliptical galaxy .",
    "however , the total masses involved are likely to be substantially greater , given that the present ir observations sample only the innermost cores of the galaxies , where the star formation rates are presumably highest . as we discussed in  3 above",

    "estimates of the star formation rate from h@xmath2  emission and the uv continuum do not normally agree to better than a factor of @xmath89 in local starbursts ( e.g. meurer et al .",
    "1995 ) ; the agreement in 0201-c6 is further improved when account is taken of the small amount of reddening ( @xmath120 ) implied by the slope of the uv continuum ( @xmath121 ) using the prescription by calzetti ( 1997a ) .",
    "we reach similar conclusions in 0000-d6 and cb58 ; in all three cases ultraviolet extinctions by factors of @xmath122 are indicated by the comparison between uv and h@xmath3  luminosities .",

    "ngst_. there is therefore a strong motivation to provide _ ngst _ with at least a moderately high spectral resolution capability ( @xmath123 ) , adequate to resolve the emission lines from star forming galaxies .",

    "star forming galaxies with spectra broadly similar to those of present day starbursts have now been detected up to redshift @xmath124 ( franx et al .",
    "it is remarkable that at such an early epoch , only 1.5  gyr after the big bang , many of the characteristics of the present day universe were already in place .",
    "the intergalactic medium was fully ionised , galaxies were enriched in a wide variety of chemical elements ( albeit in lower proportions than today ) , and structures on the scale of rich clusters were already evident . as we learn more about the time when the luminous galaxies of today were beginning to form , already the next goal in our _ ` origins ' _ quest is coming into focus : identifying the time when the first stars formed , produced the first generation of heavy elements and ionised the universe which had remained neutral since the cosmic microwave background was emitted at @xmath125 .",
    "our first steps in this unfamiliar territory are guided , as it is often the case , by theoretical considerations .",
    "the lowest metallicities measured at @xmath126 are @xmath127 of solar ( pettini et al .",

    "the ionising photons associated with the production of even such trace amounts of heavy elements outnumber the baryons by 10 to 1 ( this is a rather straightforward calculation , because the same massive stars are the source of heavy elements and ionising photons ) .",
    "thus , if this initial enrichment took place when the universe was mainly neutral , the associated lyman continuum radiation was sufficient to reionise all the diffuse gas .",
    "recently miralda - escud & rees ( 1997 ) and rees & miralda - escud ( 1997 ) have explored some of the consequences of this scenario .",
    "they point out that the physics of the galaxy formation process is different depending on whether galaxies form by accreting neutral or photoionised gas , mainly because the cooling efficiency is different in the two cases .",
    "they speculate that the first objects to collapse during the ` dark ages ' of the universe are likely to be on very small scales , with velocity dispersions @xmath128  km  s@xmath11 and masses @xmath129  @xmath7 . under these circumstances",
    "the brightest sources at very high redshifts are likely to be type ii supernovae . at @xmath130",
    "such population iii supernovae may reach an infrared magnitude @xmath131 and may be as numerous as one supernova per square arcminute per year .",
    "while it is just conceivable that an event of this kind may be within reach of current instrumentation if gravitationally lensed by a foreground cluster of galaxies , testing these bold new ideas will be the mission of the _ next generation space telescope_."
