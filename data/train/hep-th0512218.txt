    "in four dimensions the twin requirements of general covariance and the lorentz - invariance of the vacuum imply that the vacuum energy inevitably appears to gravity like a 4d cosmological constant , with a vacuum energy , @xmath7 , corresponding to a cosmological constant of order @xmath8 ( where @xmath9 here denotes newton s constant ) .",
    "the cosmological constant problem @xcite refers to the huge mismatch between the large vacuum energy expected from the known quantum zero - point fluctuations and the very small upper limit on ( or the observed value for ) the cosmological constant coming from cosmology .",
    "higher dimensional theories are of interest for the cosmological constant problem because they offer the possibility that the gravitational influence of a 4d vacuum energy need not be a 4d cosmological constant . in particular , within a higher - dimensional context the possibility exists that the gravitational response of a large 4d vacuum energy might be to curve the extra dimensions rather than the observable four , raising the hope that a large vacuum energy need not lead to a large 4d cosmological constant .",
    "the introduction of branes into the picture considerably sharpens this hope , since solutions exist to the higher - dimensional field equations for which the effective 4d cosmological constant vanishes even though they are sourced by large 4d energy configurations ( typically large brane tensions ) .    in recent years",
    "these observations have stimulated several proposals to realize this possibility in a concrete way @xcite , all with the theme that large 4d energy densities need not imply a strongly - curved 4d geometry within a brane - world picture .",
    "although this is arguably a step forward , it is not the end of the story since the mere existence of such solutions does not directly address the issues of fine - tuning which underly the cosmological constant problem .",
    "these issues come in several forms , either to do with the stability of the solution under the quantum renormalization of the underlying parameters , or to do with stability of the time evolution of the solutions against perturbations in the initial conditions ( for a review of some of these concerns see @xcite ) .",
    "one of the key questions underlying these naturalness issues asks : what conditions must be required of the various source brane configurations in order to make the observed 4 dimensions flat ?",
    "this question is crucial for addressing the fine - tuning issue because one must always be on guard against hidden fine tunings . in particular , if the properties of various branes must be carefully adjusted ( or adjusted relative to one another )",
    "then it is the stability of _ this _ particular adjustment ( against renormalization , say ) which must be established in order to solve the cosmological constant problem . indeed",
    "the main criticisms to proposals @xcite fall into this category @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "it is our purpose in this paper to provide a general answer to this question for a scalar - tensor - flux field equations arising in @xmath2-dimensional supergravity theories , for solutions having @xmath3 maximally - symmetric dimensions that are sourced by branes having co - dimension @xmath0 .",
    "( the case of co - dimension 1  as appropriate for randall - sundrum models @xcite , for instance  differs from other co - dimensions and is presently better understood @xcite . )",
    "we defer to a later paper the discussion of the naturalness issues associated with the quantum corrections to , and the stability of , the solutions presented here .    for these systems we obtain the following results :    * we derive a general expression , eq .  , which relates ( a particular average over the extra dimensions of ) the curvature of the maximally - symmetric @xmath3 dimensions to the asymptotic form taken by the bulk metric very close to the source branes",
    "our expression generalizes similar expressions which have been derived , either for 6d supergravities in the co - dimension 2 case @xcite or for higher - dimensional non - supersymmetric gravity @xcite .",
    "our result also applies to frw - like time - dependent geometries for which the @xmath3 maximally - symmetric dimensions are spatial , in which case the spatial curvature is related to both the near - brane asymptotic forms and to contributions from spatial slices in the remote past and future . * we provide a very general classification of the near - brane form taken by the bulk fields near their sources .",
    "using arguments in the spirit of the bkl analysis of time - dependence near singularities @xcite we show that in the near - brane limit the higher - dimensional supergravity fields have a power - law dependence on the proper distance , @xmath10 , from the branes .",
    "we show that the bulk fields are very generically singular near the branes , and that the bulk field equations impose kasner - like relations , eqs .   and , amongst these powers , which strongly restrict the kinds of powers ( and so also the singularities ) which arise .",
    "* combining the above two points allows an identification of how the curvature of the large @xmath3 dimensions depends on the asymptotic powers which govern the asymptotic near - brane behaviour of the bulk fields .",
    "this relation shows that the large @xmath3 dimensions must be flat in the absence of singularities within the extra dimensions ( or if these singularities are only conical ) . in the more generic case of singular configurations",
    "we find that a flat @xmath3 dimensions requires either the extra - dimensional warp factor , @xmath11 , or the dilaton , @xmath12 , must grow like an inverse power of @xmath10 as the brane is approached ( _ i.e. _ as @xmath13 ) .",
    "( in our conventions @xmath14 corresponds to weak coupling in string theory . ) * as an application we specialize the above results to the case of 6d supergravity compactified to 4 dimensions , and use them to show the existence of a new class of solutions for which the maximally - symmetric 4 dimensions are de sitter - like ( or anti - de sitter - like ) , unlike all of those which are presently known .    our presentation is organized in the following way .",
    "the next section sets up the supergravity equations of interest and their compactification to @xmath3 maximally - symmetric dimensions .",
    "it is here that we derive the key relationship , eq .  , relating the @xmath3-dimensional curvature to the asymptotics of bulk fields near the source - brane singularities .",
    "section iii then examines the relevant near - brane asymptotic forms for the bulk fields , and derives the power - law behaviour which the bulk equations dictate .",
    "these are then used in the results of section ii to more directly relate the @xmath3-dimensional curvature to the power - law dependence of the bulk fields in the near - brane limit .",
    "finally , section iv specializes to 6d supergravity compactified to 4 maximally - symmetric dimensions , and shows how to use the previous two sections to generalize the class of 6d solutions to include those having de sitter - like and anti - de sitter - like 4-dimensional slices .",
    "in this section we summarize the field equations of interest , which are the bosonic parts of the equations of motion for many higher - dimensional supergravities .",
    "we also here specialize the fields appearing in these equations to the most general configurations which are maximally symmetric in ( 3 + 1 ) non - compact dimensions , as is appropriate for describing the warped compactifications of interest .",
    "we allow these solutions to have singularities ( more about which below ) at various points within the extra dimensions corresponding to the positions of various branes having co - dimension @xmath0 .",
    "our goal in so doing is to establish a general connection , eq .",
    ", between the curvature of the noncompact 4d geometry and the asymptotic behaviour of the bulk fields in the vicinity of the various branes .",
    "our starting point is the following action in @xmath2 spacetime dimensions [ ddaction ] s = -^dx , where @xmath15 denotes the higher - dimensional newton constant and @xmath16 is a dimensional constant .",
    "the fields @xmath17 are the @xmath18-form field strengths for a collection of @xmath19-form gauge potentials , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 . when @xmath22 this is sufficiently general to encompass the bosonic parts of a variety of higher - dimensional , ungauged supergravity lagrangian densities @xcite . when @xmath23 the dilaton potential has the form found in chiral 6d supergravity @xcite .",
    "the field equations obtained from this action are : [ einstein ] & & - ^2 e^ + ^2_r e^-p_r f_r^2 = 0 + & & _ m ( e^ -p_r f_r^mn  q ) + ( ) = 0 + & & r_mn + _ m _",
    "n + ^2_r e^-p_r _ mn + ( ) g_mn = 0 , where ` ( cs terms ) ' denotes terms arising from any chern - simons terms within the definition of @xmath24 , and we define _ mn = f^ p  r_m f_np  r .",
    "the ability to write the term proportional to @xmath25 in the einstein equation in terms of @xmath26 is a consequence of the particular powers of @xmath12 which pre - multiply each of the terms in the action , .",
    "this choice corresponds to the existence of a scaling symmetry of the classical field equations , according to which g_mn g_mn e^^-1 e^ , with constant @xmath27 and the field strengths , @xmath28 , not transforming .",
    "although this is not a symmetry of the action , which transforms as @xmath29 , it does take solutions of the classical equations into one another .",
    "we seek solutions to these equations for which @xmath3 dimensions are maximally symmetric and @xmath30 are not . in most applications we have in mind @xmath5 , corresponding to having 3 + 1 maximally - symmetric directions and @xmath31 static , compact euclidean dimensions .",
    "but our analysis is general enough also to include ( with minor modifications ) situations of interest to cosmology for which there are @xmath32 maximally - symmetric spatial dimensions and @xmath31 time - dependent , compact dimensions .    to this end",
    "divide the @xmath2 coordinates @xmath33 , @xmath34 , into @xmath3 maximally - symmetric coordinates , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and the remaining @xmath30 coordinates , @xmath37 , @xmath38 .",

    "this last equation represents the main result of this section , and is a generalization to arbitrary dimensions of a similar result in 6 dimensions derived in ref .",

    "( if time is one of the @xmath1 dimensions then the surface terms must include spacelike surfaces in the remote future and past , for which @xmath49 . ) if there are no singularities or boundaries in the dimensions being integrated then the right - hand side vanishes , leading to the conclusion that the product @xmath50 integrates to zero . since @xmath51 is constant and @xmath52",
    "is strictly positive , this immediately implies @xmath53 , as concluded for 6d in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "our interest in what follows is the case where the right - hand side of eq .",
    "have singularities corresponding to the presence of various source branes situated throughout the extra dimensions . in this case",
    ".   still carries content provided we excise a small volume about the positions of each singularity , thereby leaving a co - dimension-1 boundary , @xmath54 , which surrounds each of the various brane positions . in this case",
    ".   directly relates the curvature of the maximally - symmetric @xmath1 dimensions to the sum over the contributions to the right - hand side of the boundary contributions from each surface @xmath54 .",
    "since these surfaces are chosen to be close to the source branes , these surface contributions can be simplified using the asymptotic forms taken by the bulk fields in the immediate vicinity of these sources .",
    "after a brief digression concerning the possible existence of horizons in these geometries , we return in the next section to identify what these asymptotic forms must be .",
    "it is possible that for certain choices of brane sources horizons form at some finite proper distance from the branes @xcite .",
    "we investigate here the situations for when this can occur , since such horizons could have implications for the crucial sum rule , eq .",
    "( [ integratedcba ] ) .",
    "we consider three possible cases :    1 .",
    "if @xmath55 and one of the @xmath56 coordinates is time , then the assumption of maximal symmetry implies the metric , @xmath39 , has either an @xmath57 , @xmath58 or @xmath59 isometry group .",
    "such a symmetry group precludes the formation of horizons .",
    "2 .   if @xmath55 and one of the @xmath60 coordinates is time , then a horizon could be present in the bulk , but this does not in itself interfere with the validity of the above formula ( [ integratedcba ] ) .",
    "rather , it might instead imply that both spacelike and timelike boundaries will contribute on its rhs .",
    "3 .   in the special case @xmath61 we have @xmath53 trivially , leading to the stronger statement that the divergence on the rhs of vanishes . in this case",
    "the sum rule ( [ integratedcba ] ) breaks down in the presence of a horizon because the signature of the @xmath62 metric changes at the horizon and so gauss law is no longer well defined .",
    "in this section we identify the general asymptotic form taken by the bulk fields in the immediate vicinity of any source branes , with an eye to its use in eq .   of the previous section .",
    "we are able to keep our analysis quite general by arguing that these asymptotic forms are given by powers of the distance from the source for co - dimension @xmath63 ( or possibly logs for co - dimension 2 ) with the powers determined by explicitly solving the bulk equations . assuming these equations are dominated near the branes by the contributions of the kinetic terms they may be integrated quite generally , leading to solutions corresponding to kasner - like @xcite near - brane geometries . given these solutions the validity of the assumption that kinetic terms dominate can be checked _ a posteori_.",
    "our arguments closely resemble similar arguments used long ago @xcite to identify the time - dependence of spacetimes in the vicinity of space - like singularities .      to this end",
    "we assume that the dilaton field , @xmath64 , and the metric near the brane have the form [ dilatonandmetricform ] q r s^2 r^2w g_(x ) x^ x^+ r^2 + r^2 f_ab(z ) z^a z^b , where @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 are constants .",
    "with respect to our initial metric , eq .  , we see that this corresponds to the choices [ wform ] w(y ) = r^w _ ij y^i y^j = r^2 + r^2 f_ab z^a z^b , where @xmath68 .",
    "if the supergravity of interest is regarded as describing the low - energy limit of a perturbative string theory then our conventions are such that @xmath69 represents the limit of weak string coupling .",
    "we see that if @xmath70 then the region of small @xmath10 lies beyond the domain of the weak - coupling approximation .",
    "we imagine the brane location to be given by @xmath71 and the coordinate @xmath10 is then seen to represent the proper distance away from the brane . with this choice a surface having proper radius @xmath10",
    "has an area which varies with @xmath10 like @xmath72 , and so this area only _ grows _ with increasing @xmath10 if @xmath73 . the geometry in general has a curvature singularity at @xmath74 , except for the special case @xmath75 for which the singularity can be smooth ( or purely conical ) .",
    "finally , we specialize for simplicity to the case where there is only one non - vanishing gauge flux which we take to be for a @xmath76-form potential whose field strength is @xmath77 . with a freund - rubin  @xcite in mind",
    "we also specialize to @xmath78 and take @xmath77 proportional to the volume form of the @xmath1-dimensional metric @xmath40 . near @xmath79 , we assume [ fform ] f^r a_1 ",
    "~r^.    with these assumptions , we now determine the powers @xmath66 , @xmath65 , @xmath67 and @xmath80 by solving the field equations in the region @xmath81 .",
    "we do so by neglecting the contributions of fluxes or the dilaton potential in the dilaton and einstein equations , and by neglecting any chern - simons contributions to the equations for the background @xmath76-form gauge potential . once we find the solutions we return to verify that the neglect of these terms is indeed justified .",
    "the @xmath76-form equation gives the condition 0 = _ r ( e^-p f^r z_1 ",
    "z_p ) ~_r which leads ( when @xmath82 ) to the condition @xmath83 , and so f^2 ~r^2q(d-1)-2wn .    consider next the dilaton equation .",
    "we first note that [ boxphi ] = _ m ( ^mn _",
    "n ) ~q [ nw+(d-1)-1 ] r^-2 . for comparison ,",
    "the other terms in the dilaton equation of motion depend on @xmath10 as follows : e^-p f^2 ~r^q(d-1)-2wn e^ ~r^q .",
    "thus , provided @xmath84 and @xmath85 ( whose domains of validity we explore below ) all of the terms in the dilaton equation are subdominant to @xmath86 , and so may be neglected .",
    "the dilaton therefore effectively satisfies @xmath87 near @xmath79 , and so from eq .",
    "we see that this requires [ constraint1 ] nw+(d-1)=1 .",
    "next consider the @xmath88-component of the einstein equation .",
    "given the assumed asymptotic form for the metric , we calculate _ rr & = & [ -wn + nw^2 + ( ^2-)(d-1 ) ] r^-2 + & = & [ n w^2 + ^2(d-1 ) -1 ] r^-2 . as before , we find that the @xmath89 term is subdominant if @xmath90 . the @xmath88-einstein equation therefore gives the additional constraint [ constraint2 ] n w^2+^2(d-1)+q^2=1 .",
    "notice that this equation restricts the ranges of @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 to be [ paramranges ] - w , - -1 q 1 .",
    "in particular it allows a regular solution ( or one having a conical singularity )  _",
    "i.e. _ one having @xmath91  only if @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "the einstein equations in the maximally symmetric dimensions can be similarly evaluated using the assumed asymptotic form for the metric .",
    "the contribution of the induced @xmath3-dimensional curvature tensor contributes to this equation subdominantly in @xmath10 , and so is not constrained to leading order .",
    "( in general , evaluating this equation to subdominant order in @xmath10 relates the @xmath3-dimensional curvature to the time - evolution of the exponents @xmath66 , @xmath65 and @xmath67 . )",
    "the leading term vanishes as a consequence of eq .  , and",
    "so does not impose any new conditions .",
    "neither do the einstein equations in the @xmath94 directions .",
    "the net summary of the bulk field equations on the parameters @xmath66 , @xmath65 and @xmath67 is therefore given by the two kasner - like conditions and .",
    "these two conditions therefore allow a one - parameter family ( parameterized , say , by @xmath67 ) of solutions in the vicinity of any given singularity .",
    "notice that the symmetry of these conditions under @xmath95 implies that for any given asymptotic solution there is a new one which can be obtained from the first through the weak - to - strong - coupling replacement @xmath96 .",
    "regarding these singularities as brane sources , the one - parameter set of asymptotic bulk configurations presumably corresponds to a one - parameter choice which is possible for the couplings of the brane to bulk fields .",
    "for instance , at the lowest - derivative level considered here this is plausibly related to the choice of dilaton coupling , such as if the brane action were to take the @xmath2-brane form s_b = - t ^n e^ , [ dilatoncoupling ] where @xmath97 represent coordinates on the brane world - volume , @xmath98 is the brane tension , @xmath99 is the induced metric on the brane . here",
    "the choice for @xmath100 ( which is a known function of brane dimension for @xmath2-branes ) plausibly determines the value of @xmath67 , and so the value of this parameter is not determined purely from the bulk equations of motion .",
    "we must now go back to ask whether the kasner - like conditions and are consistent with the requirements @xmath101 and @xmath85 .",
    "the first inequality clearly follows from the last of eqs .  , and",
    "so is automatic for the solutions of interest .",
    "by contrast , constraints and are _ not _ sufficient to ensure that the second inequality is satisfied , however , as is seen by using eq .   to rewrite it as @xmath102 .",
    "this is clearly not satisfied by the choices @xmath103 , @xmath104 and @xmath105 .",
    "since its violation requires either @xmath66 or @xmath67 to be negative , it necessarily involves either surfaces , @xmath54 , whose area does not grow with their radius ( @xmath106 ) or the breakdown of the perturbative supergravity approximation ( @xmath107 ) .",
    "we exclude such solutions in what follows .",
    "while the requirement @xmath84 is on solid ground , one might wonder about the other inequality : @xmath108 .",
    "in fact , by the equations of motion and the assumed asymptotic form for the various fields , the choice @xmath109 is not consistent with the requirement that there be a nonvanishing flux in the extra dimensions .",
    "similarly , the choice @xmath110 is also inconsistent if , as before , we require that @xmath111 .",
    "we now use the above expressions to evaluate the combination of bulk fields which appears on the right - hand side of eq .  .",
    "the surface quantity which appears there is [ icba - rhs ] f_- _ _ d^d-1 y .",
    "n_i | _ _ , and so evaluating this using @xmath112 ( since the outward - pointing normal points towards the brane at @xmath79 ) and the asymptotic forms given above we find [ icba - rhs - powers ] _ f_~__r 0 ( w_+ ) c _ r^_(d-1 ) + nw_- 1",

    "we have been unable to obtain analytic solutions to these equations , but there is no obstruction to their integration .",
    "they can be solved numerically leading to numerical profiles such as those given in figures ( [ yplot ] ) and ( [ zplot ] ) .",
    "in this paper our focus has been on solutions to the field equations of the coupled dilaton/@xmath76-form / einstein equations of some @xmath2-dimensional supergravities , for which @xmath3 of the dimensions are maximally symmetric .",
    "such solutions could arise , for instance , in compactifications from @xmath2 to @xmath3 dimensions within a kaluza - klein scenario .",
    "our main result in this paper is to provide a fairly general relation between the curvature of the maximally symmetric @xmath3 dimensions in terms of the ( potentially singular ) asymptotic behaviour of the various fields in the vicinity of any brane sources which may be situated about the internal @xmath189 dimensions .",
    "this relationship allows an explicit connection to be made between this curvature and the properties of the branes which source the geometry .",
    "it is only once this connection is made explicit that it becomes possible to address whether the existence of flat solutions requires a technically unnatural fine - tuning of brane properties .",
    "in particular , we use this connection in chiral 6d gauged supergravity to show the existence of compactifications to 4d de sitter and anti - de sitter geometries having arbitrary curvature . since the curvature can be arbitrary it can in particular be small , implying that these new solutions can be obtained by small perturbations from the previously - known flat solutions . since many of the flat solutions , such as those described by the rugby ball of ref .",
    "@xcite , are known to have positive tensions it follows that at least some of these new solutions can also be sourced by branes having physically reasonable properties .",
    "the existence of such solutions certainly complicates a self - tuning solution of the cosmological constant problem along the lines of ref .",
    "@xcite in several ways because it shows that maximal symmetry in 4 dimensions is insufficient to guarantee these dimensions must be flat .",
    "this means that there are now _ two _ ways in which perturbations on a brane might destabilize a flat solution : either by starting a time - dependent runaway or by generating a maximally - symmetric but curved 4 dimensions .",
    "the key issue which remains is whether the choices of brane properties which exclude these two options are stable under renormalization .",
    "the results of this paper provide the prerequisite for answering this issue , because they show that the magnitude of the effective cosmological constant problem is determined by the asymptotic form of the bulk fields , which are in turn fixed by the properties of the brane action which we renormalize .",
    "for instance , let us suppose that the branes do not couple to the dilaton , so that @xmath190 in equation ( [ dilatoncoupling ] ) , and suppose that this condition were preserved under quantum corrections ( something which must be explicitly checked ) .",
    "in this case we anticipate that the boundary condition for the dilaton near each brane should be @xmath191 , and so @xmath192 .",
    "however in such a case the 6d kasner conditions demand that the only allowed solutions are those describing conical branes , and for these our sum - rule implies the only maximally symmetric solution is minkowski .",
    "thus if we start out in one of the conical ggp solutions and perturbation ( like renormalization or a phase transition on one brane ) changes the effective brane tension without growing a dilaton coupling , then the de sitter and anti - de sitter minima discovered here can not be reached .",
    "furthermore the system can not evolve to one of the other non - conical ggp solutions unless some nontrivial dilaton coupling develops .",
    "in such a case it is likely that the system evolves towards an as - yet - undiscovered time - dependent runaway solution .",
    "if so , the central question would become how fast the runaway is , and can it successfully describe the observed dark energy ? we intend to return to these questions in a subsequent publication .",
