    "we consider solutions to the ricci flow @xmath3 an evolution equation for a smooth family of riemannian metrics @xmath4 .",

    "the strict code for membership in the class of of solutions with nonnegative curvature operator may lead one to wonder what possibilities there are for a solution @xmath1 that attains @xmath17 everywhere only after some elapsed time @xmath18 .",
    "the condition @xmath7 will be preserved for @xmath19 , and a solution that splits locally for @xmath20 must likewise split at @xmath21 , but we have no information on the properties of the solution prior to @xmath22 . in particular , we can not dismiss the possibility that such a solution could split spontaneously at @xmath22 .",
    "one may wonder , more generally , whether it is possible for any solution ( on a manifold with compatible topology ) to acquire a novel local metric splitting within finite time . here , one s intuitive picture of the ricci flow as a `` heat equation '' for riemannian metrics seems at odds with such a phenomenon .",
    "surely it must violate some principle of unique continuation .",
    "the basic question this paper seeks to answer is : which one ?",
    "our main result is the following theorem .",

    "[ thm : holonomy ] suppose @xmath1 is a smooth complete solution to on @xmath24 $ ] of uniformly bounded curvature .",
    "then @xmath25 for all @xmath26 .",
    "theorem [ thm : holonomy ] is the `` backwards - time '' analog of the observation of hamilton ( cf .",
    "@xcite , @xcite ) that the holonomy group of a smooth solution to the ricci flow can not expand within its lifetime .",
    "thus one actually has @xmath27 along the flow .",
    "one consequence is an affirmation of the expectation above that locally product metrics are , in a sense , rigid within the class of solutions to ricci flow .",

    "moreover , @xmath49 for all @xmath50 $ ] .",
    "we divide the proof of theorem [ thm : rangerm ] into several steps . in section [ sec : ncasuc ] , we reduce it to a problem of unique continuation for a certain system ; this is theorem [ thm : rangermredux ] . in section [ sec : pdeode ] we embed this system in a larger ( closed ) system of coupled partial- and ordinary - differential inequalities .",
    "the bulk of the work is the verification that this larger system is indeed closed ; for this we must perform a rather careful analysis of the evolution equations of the components of our system . for the unique continuation",
    ", we ultimately appeal to a special case of an earlier result of the author @xcite for parabolic pde - ode systems .",
    "the approach in that reference was inspired by work of alexakis @xcite on weakly - hyperbolic systems arising in the study of the vacuum einstein equations .",
    "we remark that , although we restrict our attention to the ricci flow in the present paper , the basic method can be applied to study the holonomy of families of metrics arising from other geometric evolution equations .",
    "for example , a result analogous to theorem [ thm : holonomy ] holds for the metrics induced by the mean curvature flow of hypersurfaces in euclidean space ( and , with additional conditions , in more general ambient spaces ) ; we intend to address this in a future note .",
    "as we mentioned above , it is a result of hamilton ( cf .",
    "@xcite , @xcite ) that a solution to ricci flow with holonomy initially restricted to some subgroup of @xmath51 will continue to have its holonomy so restricted . for this paper ,",

    "theorems [ thm : holonomy ] and [ thm : holonomynonex ] are statements about the backwards- and forwards - time behavior of a solution to a ( weakly- ) parabolic system , and , despite their apparent symmetry , require rather different methods of proof . for the purpose of comparison , we will discuss two proofs of theorem [ thm : holonomynonex ] in detail .",
    "the first is an elementary combination of berger s classification @xcite , de rham s splitting theorem @xcite , and the uniqueness of solutions for the ricci flow @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the second , which we defer to the appendix , is essentially self - contained and closer to the argument suggested in @xcite .",

    "all of the ingredients of the proof below can be found , for example , in the combination of the references @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the argument can be summarized very succinctly . in the category of complete solutions to the ricci flow with bounded curvature ,",
    "any initial isometries are preserved , and product , khler , and einstein initial data extend uniquely to solutions of the same type . with the splitting theorem @xcite and the classification theorem @xcite as it is now understood ,",
    "this is enough to conclude that any restriction of the initial holonomy is shared by the solution at later times .",
    "we will refer to the following modern version of berger s theorem ( cf . ,",

    ", we may as well assume that @xmath110 is irreducible .",
    "now we consider each case of theorem [ thm : berger ] in turn .",
    "suppose first that @xmath110 is symmetric .",
    "the uniqueness of solutions and the diffeomorphism invariance of the equation imply that @xmath128 . for",
    "a general metric @xmath90 , denote by @xmath129 the set of isometries @xmath130 .",
    "since the composition law of @xmath131 and the set of any isometry s fixed points are independent of the metric , the preservation of initial isometries also implies @xmath132 .",
    "in particular , @xmath1 remains symmetric for @xmath16 .",
    "but for a symmetric metric @xmath90 , each fixed representative @xmath133 of the isomorphism class of @xmath134 can be described explicitly as the subgroup of squares of involutive isometries fixing @xmath135 ( cf . proposition 3.35 of @xcite ) .",
    "symbolically , @xmath136 then @xmath132 implies @xmath137 and , since @xmath1 is symmetric , that @xmath138    therefore we are left with the seven alternatives on berger s list .",
    "the first of these is uninteresting , of course , as @xmath139 for any metric @xmath90 .",
    "the second , @xmath140 , implies @xmath110 is khler , and it is well - known that from a khler initial metric of bounded curvature one can construct a khler solution of bounded curvature by the solution of an appropriate parabolic monge - ampere equation for the potential .",
    "this solution may , a priori , only exist for a short time , but for this period we must have @xmath126 by uniqueness ( and hence @xmath141 ) .",
    "we may then iterate as before to conclude the same on the entire interval of existence for @xmath1 .",
    "this leaves five cases .",
    "however , in each of these , @xmath110 is necessarily einstein ( cf .",
    "53 - 55 of @xcite ) .",
    "( in fact , in the cases @xmath142 , @xmath143 , @xmath144 , or @xmath145 , the metric must be ricci - flat . ) but , associated to einstein initial data @xmath146 , one can construct the einstein solution @xmath147 which moves only by homothetical scaling .",
    "the holonomy is obviously unchanged for this solution and it is unique among ( at least ) those of uniformly bounded curvature .",
    "thus @xmath148 and @xmath149 .",
    "it is natural to ask whether one can fashion an analogous argument along for theorem [ thm : holonomy ] .",
    "the answer seems to be `` only partially . ''",
    "the failure of this argument to extend to all cases was , in fact , the starting point for the work in the present paper .",
    "of the three primary components of the preceding proof , we nevertheless retain at least two . the classification component ,",
    "coming from berger s and de rham s theorems and their consequences , is as applicable to @xmath150 as it was to @xmath151 . from @xcite",
    ", we also have a counterpart to the uniqueness component : two complete solutions @xmath1 , @xmath152 to of uniformly bounded curvature that agree at @xmath153 must agree at times @xmath154 . from this",
    ", it follows that any isometries of @xmath150 are shared by @xmath1 for @xmath154 , and that @xmath150 is einstein only if @xmath1 is as well for @xmath154 .",
    "what we lack , rather , is the ability to construct by hand the special `` competitor '' solutions to extend the data @xmath150 to a solution of the same type for times @xmath154 . of course",
    ", if @xmath150 is einstein , we may still construct an extension by homothetical scaling of @xmath150 .",
    "however , when @xmath150 is khler , we can not simply construct a khler extension @xmath152 for @xmath155 by the method above , since we must now specify instead the data for the potential at time @xmath156 .",
    "such `` terminal - value '' parabolic problems are _ ill - posed _ and lack solutions in general .",
    "the analogous terminal - value problems for the ricci ( or ricci - de turck ) flows are also ill - posed , and this is an impediment , in particular , to the construction of a product extension @xmath157 for @xmath154 from product data @xmath158 on @xmath159 .",
    "the trouble is that , while the product metric @xmath160 belongs to @xmath161  the `` image '' of the time-@xmath156 ricci flow operator on @xmath107 , we do not know whether either of the factors @xmath114 belong to @xmath162 for _ any _ @xmath8 .",
    "while theorem [ thm : holonomy ] is not simply reducible to the backwards - uniqueness of solutions to , we will show , nevertheless , that it is equivalent to the backwards - uniqueness of a certain larger , mixed parabolic and ordinary - differential , system .",
    "the argument we will describe in the next section ( and carry out in those following ) will be essentially self - contained and , in particular , independent of the theorems of berger and de rham .",
    "our basic strategy is to interpret restricted holonomy as a condition on the operator @xmath163 .",
    "( this is also the basis of hamilton s approach to non - expansion of holonomy in @xcite ) .",
    "this characterization is natural since the curvature effectively determines the holonomy lie algebra ( in a manner we will review below ) , but it offers an additional advantage for our purposes in that the curvature operator , unlike the metric , satisfies a strictly parabolic equation .",

    "the image of the curvature operator is contained in @xmath164 and , as @xmath167 is self - adjoint , its kernel at each @xmath135 therefore contains @xmath168 . the bundle @xmath169 is likewise closed under parallel translation , though not in general under the lie bracket .",
    "the following observation shows that ( as in theorem [ thm : rangerm ] ) we may as well consider any parallel subalgebra @xmath48 containing @xmath167 , @xmath164 being , in a sense , the minimal such @xmath48 .",
