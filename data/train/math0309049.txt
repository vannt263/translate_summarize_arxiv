    "since rubinstein s announcement of an algorithm to recognize the 3-sphere in 1993 @xcite , almost normal surfaces , the main technical innovation of that work , have received wide attention . in 1994",
    "thompson @xcite reworked rubinstein s proof of the existence of an almost normal 2-sphere in @xmath7 using gabai s language of _ thin position _",
    "@xcite . also in 1993 rubinstein announced that any strongly irreducible heegaard spliting could be made almost normal .",
    "this result , combined with his later work with william jaco @xcite , implies that any non - haken 3-manifold admits at most finitely many heegaard splittings of a given genus . in 1996",
    "stocking @xcite provided a new proof of the fact that strongly irreducible heegaard splittings can be made almost normal , by following thompson s use of thin position type arguments .",
    "more recently the author @xcite and , independently , rieck and sedgwick @xcite used almost normal surfaces to prove that for any orientable 3-manifold with torus boundary , @xmath8 , in all but finitely many dehn fillings of @xmath8 the core of the attached solid torus can be isotoped onto every strongly irreducible heegaard splitting .",
    "saul schleimer @xcite has used almost normal surfaces to show that the set of distances of the heegaard splittings of a given 3-manifold is finite .",
    "the main result of this paper is that one may isotope a _",
    "heegaard - scharlemann - thompson _ ( hst ) splitting into an appropriate normal form . roughly speaking ,",
    "an hst splitting of a 3-manifold is a sequence of surfaces such that each consecutive pair cobounds a compression body , and if @xmath9 is such compression body then the subindex of @xmath10 is odd ( a more precise definition is given in section [ s : hst ] ) . for each odd @xmath2 the surface @xmath3",
    "is referred to as a _ thick level _ , and for each even @xmath2 , @xmath3 is a _",
    "thin level_. just as for classical heegaard splittings , the concept of _ strong irreducibility _ is a useful notion of non - triviality for an hst splitting .",
    "the precise statement of our main result is the following :    * theorem [ t : main ] * _ suppose @xmath0 ( @xmath6 or @xmath7 ) is an irreducible submanifold of a triangulated 3-manifold which is bounded by a normal or almost normal surface , and contains at most one maximal normal 2-sphere . if @xmath1 is a strongly irreducible hst splitting of @xmath0 then each thin level is isotopic to a normal surface , and each thick level is isotopic to an almost normal surface . _    consequences of theorem [ t : main ] include many of aforementioned results on the existence of almost normal surfaces .",
    "we also show that several new results follow that may be of independent interest .    * theorem [ nonsep ] * _ if a triangulated 3-manifold contains a non - separating surface then it contains a non - separating almost normal surface . _    * theorem [ compressible ] * _ suppose @xmath0 is a submanifold of a triangulated irreducible 3-manifold which is bounded by a connected normal surface , and contains at most one maximal normal 2-sphere . if @xmath11 is compressible in @xmath0 then there is an almost normal surface in @xmath0 which is topologically parallel to @xmath11 , and normalizes monotonically to @xmath11 .",
    "_    a result similar to theorem [ compressible ] has been independently obtained by culler , dunfield , jaco and shalen in their program to solve the weak lopez conjecture .",
    "an immediate corollary is the following :    * corollary [ normalheegaard ] * _ if @xmath12 is a heegaard surface for a 3-manifold which is isotopic to a normal surface in the complement of a maximal normal 2-sphere then @xmath12 is isotopic to two , topologically parallel , almost normal surfaces .",
    "_    we conclude the paper by proving a result similar to theorem [ t : main ] , which gives an exact characterization of handlebodies in terms of the existence of certain normal and almost normal surfaces .",
    "we hope to use this result in subsequent work to give a new algorithm to determine when an almost normal surface is a heegaard surface .",
    "the techniques used to prove theorem [ t : main ] may be of independent interest . while in this paper we make crucial use of ideas from such earlier papers as @xcite , our arguments differ from those of previous authors in several key respects .",
    "we outline these differences here .",
    "* for the existence of almost normal strongly irreducible heegaard splittings both rubinstein and stocking produce a sequence of surfaces which eventually converge to the desired one . for example , in rubinstein s  iterated \" sweepout approach he shows that almost normal surfaces occur at the maximum of a sweepout which is in some way  minimal \" .",
    "but the first sweepout which he chooses may not have the desired surface as a maximum .",
    "so a sequence of sweepouts of smaller and smaller submanifolds is chosen in which the maximum is eventually the desired surface . in the approach here",
    "we show that if the right concept of  minimal \" is chosen for the initial sweepout then all _ local _ maxima are almost normal , and the desired surface must be one of these . *",
    "several results are used here to streamline the argument which were not available to rubinstein or stocking .",
    "for example , we appeal to scharlemann s _ local detection of strongly irreducible heegaard splittings _ @xcite to classify the intersection of certain surfaces with the interior of a 3-simplex . * rather than using sweepouts ( as does rubinstein ) or thin position ( as do thompson and stocking ) we use the general framework of _ relative _ hst splittings ( see section [ s : relhst ] ) .",
    "we find that this general framework provides a much cleaner approach and further streamlines some of the arguments .",
    "* we deal with 2-sphere components that may be  pinched off \" in the formation of an almost normal surface in an entirely different way than previous authors .",
