    "this so called even - odd effect on charge distribution was interpreted as an indicator of an intrinsic excitation of the system during the descent from saddle to scission . in 1980 , w. lang _ et al . _",
    "reported that the mentioned even - odd effect increases with kinetic energy of fragments from thermal neutron induced fission of @xmath1u @xcite .",
    "contrary to expected , in 1981 , c. signarbieux _ et al .",
    "_ obtained experimental evidence that in the region of highest kinetic energy of fragments from @xmath0u(n@xmath5 , f ) and @xmath1u(n@xmath5 , f ) , respectively , there is no evidence of even - odd effects on mass yield @xcite .",

    "_ present the charge and mass distribution as a function of excitation energy of fragments from @xmath2cf(sf ) @xcite .",
    "they reported the observation of a preference for odd over even charge fragments in the region of low values of total excitation energy .",
    "the question that emerges from these results is the following : what happens in the case of minimal value of total excitation energy of fragments ?",
    "do the odd charge fragments reach lower minimal total excitation energy than the even charge fragments do ? if that is the case , what is the physical cause ?",
    "in the scission configuration , the equation of energy balance is the following : @xmath6 where @xmath3 is the available energy , @xmath7 is the potential energy , @xmath8 is the total intrinsic excitation energy , @xmath9 is the total free pre - scission kinetic energy .",
    "the potential energy is given by @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the energy of coulomb interaction energy between fragments , @xmath12 is the total deformation energy and @xmath13 represents the elongation of the scission configuration , which may be defined as : @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the ellipsoidal semi axis referred to heavy ( h ) and light ( l ) fragments , respectively .",
    "it is assumed that for both light and heavy fragments",
    "@xmath17 = @xmath15 .",
    "see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1.jpg ] .",
    "the aim of this work is to study how the components of that equation influence the even - odd effects on the minimal excitation energy .",
    "let s assume that the minimal excitation energy is reached by the initially most compact scission configuration with null pre - scission kinetic energy and null intrinsic excitation energy .",
    "then the minimal total deformation energy which will correspond to the minimal excitation deformation , obeys the relation @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the maximal value of coulomb interaction energy and @xmath20 is the minimal value of deformation energy reached by the scission configuration .",
    "+ lets define : @xmath21 @xmath22 and @xmath23 therefore the difference between total deformation energies corresponding to even / even and odd / odd charge splits , respectively , will be : @xmath24 + let s assume that @xmath12 increases with elongation of the scission configuration",
    ". then @xmath25 the amplitude of @xmath26 will increase with the configuration hardness .",
    "in other words the tendency will be in the sense that even / even charge splits will have lower minimal deformation energy than the corresponding to odd / odd charge splits .",
    "+ in cases of soft scission cold configurations , i.e. the deformation energy does not change with deformation in cold fission region , there will be not even - odd effects on @xmath20 , i.e. @xmath27 in this case the even - odd effect on @xmath3 value will be expressed on @xmath19 , i.e. @xmath28 therefore on @xmath29 .",
    "the previous section was dedicated to analyse even - odd effect considering that for the same deformation coulomb energy does not change with fragment charge . however , when two neighboring fragment charge are compared , the coulomb effect must be taken into account @xcite . in a scission point model ,",
    "the potential energy ( @xmath7 ) of a scission configuration corresponding to a light fragment charge @xmath30 is given by the relation @xmath31 see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2.jpg ] .",
    "+ one assumes that the most compact configuration obeys the relations @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "then @xmath34 after the coulomb effect it is expected that between two isobaric splits having similar @xmath3-values , the more asymmetric charge split will reach a more compact configuration , which corresponds to a lower deformation energy @xcite . because coulomb effect may involve more than 3 mev , for experimental results that can not be interpreted with coulomb effect hypothesis an eventual dramatic change of deformation properties for neighboring charge",
    "isobaric fragments may be explored .",
    "+ in cases of soft scission configurations , i.e. the deformation energy does not vary with deformation , there will be not coulomb effect on @xmath20 , i.e. @xmath35",

    "@xcite , in 2013 f. gnnenwein presents the yield of charge as a function of total kinetic energy ( @xmath36 ) of isobaric fragmentations @xmath37 from @xmath1u(n@xmath5 , f ) .",

    "f. gnnenwein interprets those results as a consequence of the higher density of low energy levels in odd charge fragments .",

    "[ fig : fig7.jpg ] . in this case",
    "the even / even and more asymmetric charge split reaches lower excitation energy , result which also agrees with coulomb effect hypothesis .",
    "+ in a global view , even - odd effects on measured fragment charge referred to maximal value of total kinetic energy are observed in isobaric fragmentations from @xmath1u(n@xmath5,f ) reported by c. signarbieux @xcite .",
    "between the 29 cases of isobaric fragmentations , in 25 cases the highest values of total kinetic energy correspond to even / even charge splits .",
    "nevertheless , when two isobaric charge splits with similar @xmath3-value are compared , the more asymmetric split reaches their corresponding maximal @xmath36-values .",
    "several experimental results presented by other authors seem to show that odd / odd charge splits reach lower minimal excitation energy than the even / even charge splits do .",
    "however the presented cases correspond to odd / odd charge splits more asymmetric than the even / even charges splits .",
    "therefore those results may be interpreted by the coulomb effect hypothesis .",
    "after this hypothesis the more asymmetric charge split will reach the lower minimal deformation energy .",
    "moreover , there are case of even / even charge splits with higher minimal excitation energy than the odd / odd charge splits , but they also correspond to more asymmetric charge splits . is short coulomb effect seems to overshadow even - odd effects on minimal value of excitation energy .",
