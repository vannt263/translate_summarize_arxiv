    "the unique features of the lear ( low - energy antiproton ring ) facility at cern made recently possible the synthesis of few antihydrogen atoms @xcite . this effort would be pursued with the antiproton deccelerator ( ad ) project @xcite and would make possible the storage of sensible amounts of antihydrogen .",
    "this project reinforces the already active interest to investigate several theoretical and experimental problems in the physics of antimatter @xcite .    in view of storing antimatter in traps",
    ", it would be interesting to have some theoretical calculations of the rate at which antiprotons ( @xmath4 ) and antihydrogen ( @xmath5 ) annihilate with the residual gas .",
    "this process should be evaluated at subkelvin temperatures , the optimal energy domain for an effective synthesis and trapping of antimatter .    from a theoretical standpoint ,",
    "a specific feature of systems like @xmath6 or @xmath7 , containing pairs of unlike charged heavy particles ( @xmath8 and @xmath4 ) , is the possibility of rearrangement followed by protonium ( pn ) formation .",
    "indeed even at zero p kinetic energy protonium can be produced in states with principal quantum number @xmath9 .    since the pioneer work of e. fermi and e. teller @xcite in 1947",
    ", this problem has been treated by several authors @xcite in the energy range going from a fraction to tens a.u .. the usual approach is based on the following two assumptions : i ) the separation of electronic and nuclear motion and ii ) the classical treatment of the antiproton dynamics .",
    "the aim of the present work is to provide a correct description of the ultra - low energy limit , i.e. @xmath10 a.u . , an energy domain in which the above mentioned assumptions are no longer valid . as a consequence",
    "we are definitely faced to a quantum three- or four - body problem .",
    "we will consider in what follows the annihilation of ultra slow antiprotons with atomic hydrogen in the framework of an unitary coupled channel approach .",
    "this process will be identified to the free pn formation : @xmath11 as far as the direct annihilation at such low energies can be neglected and that the further evolution of pn states will result into annihilation . in our treatment",
    "the protonium formation as well as the virtual rearrangement process , i.e. the inverse reaction of ( [ react ] ) : @xmath12 will be properly taken into account .",
    "we will show that the energy dependence of the inelastic reaction probability is determined by a rich spectrum of nearthreshold s - matrix singularities , corresponding to @xmath13 nearthreshold metastable states generated by the long range charge - dipole interaction .",
    "finally we will give an estimation of the @xmath14 annihilation cross - section in the energy range from @xmath15 to @xmath16 a.u .",
    "the adequate formalism for the three - body problem are the faddeev equations @xcite , according to which three possible asymptotic clusters have to be explicitly described . in the case of slow antiprotons scattering on",
    "hydrogen only two of them are physically important .",
    "the first one is the @xmath17 cluster , which corresponds to the elastic channel @xmath18 .",
    "the second one is the @xmath19 cluster , corresponding to the protonium formation channels @xmath20 .    a direct solution of the faddeev equations for such a problem is made difficult by the big number of open channels containing fast oscillating asymptotics . in this section",
    "we will develop a formalism which enables to take into account the correct behavior of the three - body wavefunction in both mentioned asymptotic clusters and benefit from the small value of the electron - antiproton mass ratio .",
    "we will show that this approach gives the scattering observables with an accuracy of the order of @xmath21 by using a very limited number of channels . in the same time it provides a transparent physical understanding of the low energy three - body dynamics in the @xmath2 reaction , which was the main aim of our study .",
    "the jacobi coordinates for the 3-body problem are connected with the possible different asymptotic clusters .",
    "the coordinates corresponding to the elastic channel are defined by @xmath22 where @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 are respectively the electron , proton and antiproton coordinates , and @xmath26 @xmath27 are the electron and proton mass .",
    "it turns out that this frame is also convenient for describing the protonium production channels .",
    "indeed , the @xmath8-@xmath28 distance @xmath29 , coincides within @xmath30 with @xmath31 in equation ( [ jfr ] ) .",
    "we will show that knowing the three - body wavefunction at @xmath32 is enough to get a good approximation of the scattering observables .",
    "thus we can substitute @xmath33 by @xmath31 and take into account , if necessary , the difference between @xmath33 and @xmath31 in a perturbative way .",
    "we will use hereafter the unique coordinate system ( [ jfr ] ) .",
    "the three - body wavefunction is represented as a sum of two components , corresponding to the two considered clusters : @xmath34    component @xmath35 is supposed to describe the elastic channel and can be written as @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the set of quantum numbers labeling the hydrogen atomic states @xmath38 as well as the corresponding antiproton wavefunction @xmath39 .",
    "we will denote from now by channel each term in the three - body wavefunction expansion like ( [ phi10 ] ) .    for incident antiproton energy much smaller than the first hydrogen excitation threshold",
    ", it is convenient to select from ( [ phi10 ] ) only the contributions which do not vanish in the asymptotics .",
    "this gives the simple form : @xmath40 it is useful to introduce a projection operator @xmath41 , which acts in the three - body states space and projects on the subspace of hydrogen states corresponding to open channels : @xmath42 in our case the sum is limited to the 1s state only .",
    "component @xmath43 is then written as : @xmath44 the second component @xmath45 describes all the remaining channels and can be written in the form : @xmath46 this means that all the electron states except 1s contribute into @xmath45 ensuring the orthogonality of both components .",
    "the @xmath45 component contains terms which correspond to the protonium formation channels . in order to explicitly take into account the asymptotic behavior of the cluster @xmath47",
    ", @xmath45 is expanded in a complete set of the @xmath48 eigenfunctions @xmath49 : @xmath50 where @xmath51 are unknown expansion coefficients representing the electron wavefunctions in the channels characterized by protonium quantum numbers @xmath52 .",
    "let us remark here that at this level no approximation has been done .",
    "in particular the truncation done in the choice ( [ phi1 ] ) of @xmath53 is balanced in the functions @xmath54 of the second component .",
    "the schrodinger equation for a three - body vector state @xmath55 reads : @xmath56 with : @xmath57 the hydrogen hamiltonian , @xmath58 the protonium hamiltonian and @xmath59 the electron - antiproton interaction potential .",
    "@xmath60 is the @xmath2 reduced mass which , neglecting @xmath61 terms , will be hereafter approximated by the protonium reduced mass @xmath62 , @xmath63 the total energy , @xmath64 the hydrogen ground state energy and @xmath65 the center of mass energy of incident antiproton .",
    "note that all the spin degrees of freedom are neglected .",
    "we will first neglect the term @xmath66 and substitute the exact @xmath67 and @xmath68 by the approximations : @xmath69 using ( [ phi1proj ] ) and ( [ phi2proj ] ) we obtain the following coupled equations for the components @xmath70 : @xmath71 we used here the fact that @xmath41 commutes with @xmath72 and @xmath73 .    the corresponding equations for the antiproton @xmath74 and electron wave - functions @xmath75 could be obtained by substituting ( [ phi1 ] ) and ( [ phi2exp ] ) into ( [ eqsf ] ) . due to the choice of the wavefunction components the solution of such a coupled equations system",
    "will correctly describe the asymptotic behavior of the three - body system .",
    "this procedure will however remain formal , for it leads to an infinite set of coupled channels , including the closed ones , characterized by a continuous @xmath76 momentum variable . to construct an equation system suitable for practical calculations",
    ", we should first analyze the contribution of different channels in the expansion ( [ phi2exp ] ) .",
    "in particular , the one coming from the continuous spectrum .",
    "for such a purpose we represent @xmath45 as a sum of two components : @xmath77 where @xmath78 @xmath79 and @xmath80 @xmath81 is a certain set of coulomb quantum numbers chosen in such a way , that @xmath82 contains all the open channels and , eventually , a limited number of closed ones .",
    "the sum from @xmath81 to infinity includes also the integration over the continuous @xmath28 momentum .",
    "the @xmath82 component describes the dynamics of protonium formation and includes the corresponding asymptotics of the three - body wavefunction : @xmath83 here @xmath84 are the s - matrix elements for the protonium formation and @xmath85 are the outgoing electron waves in the channel with quantum numbers @xmath86 .",
    "the component @xmath87 contains only closed channels .    at big @xmath88 the component @xmath82 vanishes due to the coulomb bound state wave functions @xmath89 . on the contrary ,",
    "the contribution from @xmath90 is essential as far as it contains non vanishing terms coming from the pp states in the continuum corresponding to the virtual excitations and break - up .",
    "it is shown in appendix that @xmath90 actually describes the effect of the long - range polarization which can be taken into account by introducing in the elastic channel the local potential @xmath91 with @xmath92 ensuring that for @xmath93 ( h - bohr radius ) @xmath94 the h dipole polarizability .",
    "the following approximation @xcite for @xmath92 was found to be suitable in practical calculations : @xmath95    it is qualitatively shown in appendix and proved by numerical calculations that at distances @xmath96 , @xmath82 dominates and the main contribution to the wavefunction comes from the channels with n=26 - 40 , thus we can choose @xmath97    we will first consider the case of total @xmath98 angular momentum @xmath99 equal zero .",
    "the characteristic incident @xmath4 energy , below which s - wave dominates in the elastic channel will be determined later .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that in the @xmath100 case , protonium is primarily produced in states with angular momentum @xmath101 and @xmath102 .",
    "the physical reason is that for the open channels with n=26 - 30 , which dominate the reaction amplitude , the electron is ejected with rather small momentum @xmath103 , and the centrifugal barrier reduces the probability to find a slow electron ( and consequently protonium ) with high angular momentum .",
    "the preceding results enable us to construct a model which , including a limited number of channels , correctly describes the asymptotic behavior of the three - body wavefunction .",
    "these channels dominate the reaction amplitude , while closed channels corresponding to the continuous spectrum of protonium states , are taken into account by means of the polarization potential ( [ vpol ] ) . in practical calculations",
    "we have included the protonium channels with principal quantum number n=10 - 40 and angular momentum @xmath104 .",
    "numerical checks showed the stability of the results when increasing the number of included channels .",
    "the considered equation system has the form : @xmath105 @xmath106 g_{n^{\\prime } , l^{\\prime } } ( r ) & + &   \\nonumber",

    "this approach turned to be an efficient tool for both a qualitative understanding and precise numerical treatment of the problem .",
    "the @xmath111 scattering observables are given by the first equation for antiproton wavefunction @xmath112 ( [ first ] ) .",
    "the effects of the remaining coupled equations ( [ second ] ) are taken into account by transforming the system ( [ first]-[second ] ) into one equation for @xmath112 which contains a complex nonlocal effective potential : @xmath113 with @xmath114    here @xmath115 is the green - matrix of coupled equation system for electron wave - functions : @xmath116 the whole problem is then splitted into two parts : to calculate the effective potential and to solve the one - channel problem for antiproton scattering in a complex nonlocal potential .",
    "the benefits of such an approach are several . on one hand the green function ( [ k ] ) is calculated by solving a coupled equation system for smooth electron wavefunctions , while the fast oscillating @xmath76 wavefunctions are explicitly introduced by the well - known coulomb states . on the other hand the effective potential  ( [ veff ] ) practically does not depend on the @xmath117 incident energy in the domain @xmath118 a.u .",
    "the minimum energy of the ejected electron ( from pn state with n=30 ) is about @xmath119 a.u . and for @xmath4 energies less than this value , the green - matrix ( [ k ] ) is not sensitive to incident antiproton energy .",
    "this means that , once calculated for @xmath120 , the effective potential can be used in the whole energy range of interest and this radically simplifies the calculations .    from a physical point of view",
    "it seems also more natural to analyze the properties of the hp system in terms of a modified one channel problem .",
    "the main features of the effective potential as they appear from our calculations are the following :    1 .",
    "the imaginary part of @xmath121 vanishes at distance @xmath122 , which corresponds to the mean radius of the last protonium open channel ( n=30 ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] @xmath123(r , r^{\\prime } ) $ ] for @xmath124 is plotted as a function of r. 2 .",
    "the imaginary part of @xmath125 is sharply peaked around its diagonal @xmath124 .",
    "nevertheless for @xmath126 , the nonlocality range is of the same order as the antiproton wavefunction @xmath127 oscillation period .",
    "the profile of @xmath123(r , r^{% \\prime } ) $ ] for @xmath128 is shown on fig .",
    "the profile of the real part of @xmath121 is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] . its nonlocality range is bigger than for the imaginary part .",
    "it vanishes at @xmath129 and dominates over the polarization @xmath130 and the coulomb screened @xmath131 potentials in the range @xmath132",
    "in this section we will present the main results obtained in the coupled - channels model and discuss the physical reasons of certain scattering observables behavior .",
    "the @xmath98 complex scattering length is found to be : @xmath133 the corresponding elastic cross - section at zero energy is : @xmath134 we remark the relatively big value , in the atomic scale , of the scattering length imaginary part .",
    "such value is a consequence of the long range polarization forces . by switching off @xmath130 in ( [ eqeff ] ) the value obtained",
    "is substantially reduced to @xmath135 .",
    "the capital role of the polarization forces in the low energy hp dynamics will be discussed in the next subsection .",
    "we have calculated the energy dependence of the inelasticity @xmath136 for several partial waves .",
    "the results are shown on fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] for @xmath4 incident energies in the range from 0 to @xmath137 a.u .. the inelasticity turns to be less than 0.1 for @xmath138 a.u . and does not become greater than @xmath139 in the energy domain of interest .",
    "one can also see in this figure that the scattering length approximation is valid for energies less than @xmath140 the results for @xmath141 have been calculated under the assumption that the effective potential ( [ veff ] ) weakly depends on total angular momentum l in the energy range of interest .",
    "as one can see , s - wave dominates for @xmath142 .",
    "the total annihilation cross - section is shown on fig .",
    "it follows the @xmath143-law for @xmath144 a.u .",
    "and decreases nonmonotonously for @xmath145 a.u .",
    "such nonmonotonic behavior is originated by the contribution of nonzero angular momentum partial waves , which is explicitly seen on fig .",
    "it is interesting to compare this cross - section with a semi - classical calculation @xcite obtained under the following assumptions : i ) the @xmath4 motion can be treated classically and ii ) the annihilation takes place with unit probability as soon as the @xmath146 distance is smaller than a critical radius @xmath147 .",
    "the semi - classical cross - section , shown on fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , is approximately 2.5 times bigger than our values for @xmath144 a.u . .",
    "this indicates that the low - energy @xmath148 annihilation is sensitive to the quantum dynamics of protonium formation and could hardly be reproduced with models in which the details of such dynamics are not taken into account .",
    "the population of different protonium states , calculated for energies @xmath149 is shown on fig .",
    "protonium is produced primary in the s - states with principal quantum number @xmath150 .",
    "the p - states population does not exceed 15% of the whole captured fraction of antiprotons .",
    "these results confirm our qualitative estimation concerning the channels which give the main contribution into the reaction amplitude in the low - energy limit .",
    "it is worth to mention that protonium s - states population dominates only for @xmath28 energies less than @xmath15 a.u . , while the population of states with higher @xmath151 should increase with increasing energy @xcite .",
    "we conclude this paragraph by emphasizing that the @xmath111 scattering observables significantly change their behavior at @xmath152 a.u .",
    ", a characteristic energy for the reaction . we will demonstrate that this behavior is determined by the presence of nearthreshold @xmath111 bound and virtual states generated by the polarization potential .",
    "the polarization potential is known to significantly modify the low energy cross - sections of atomic reactions .",
    "it plays an essential role in the @xmath153 scattering .",
    "this potential produces a rich spectrum of @xmath98 weakly - bound and virtual states @xcite , which results from the long range character of the polarization forces and the heavy ( in atomic scale ) antiproton mass .",
    "such states , being nearthreshold s - matrix singularities , determine the energy dependence of the @xmath98 scattering cross - section .",
    "the main properties of such states and their relation with the observables are discussed in this subsection .",
    "we first remark that the polarization potential @xmath130 alone generates several @xmath4 weakly - bound states .",
    "the energy levels and mean radii of several nearest to the threshold s - states produced by @xmath130 alone are shown in table [ table1 ] ( values marked by subscript ii ) .",
    "these states are extremely prolonged and have very small binding energies . by switching on the short range part of the interaction , i.e. the complex nonlocal effective potential @xmath121 and the screened coulomb @xmath154 ,",
    "the spectrum is modified and inelastic widths appear .",
    "nevertheless , the main features , small binding energy ( @xmath155 a.u . ) and big radius ( @xmath156 ) @xmath157 , remain .    in the threshold vicinity the elastic s - matrix for l=0 is dominated by its singularities and can be written in the form : @xmath158 due to @xmath159 . in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] are shown the trajectories of several s - matrix poles ( @xmath160 ) and corresponding zeros ( @xmath161 ) as a function of the strength of the @xmath121 imaginary part . as it can be seen , the presence of the negative imaginary part in the effective potential results in shifting the s - matrix zeros to the right into the iv and i quadrants , with the corresponding symmetrical shift of s - matrix poles into the ii and iii ones . the position of",
    "the nearest to the origin s - matrix zero ( and pole ) corresponds to an energy of @xmath162 a.u . and plays a role of characteristic energy for the reaction  ( [ react ] ) .",
    "we notice however that this nearest to the threshold s - matrix singularity lies on the non - physical sheet , i.e. re(k)@xmath163 and im(k)@xmath163 , and corresponds to a virtual state .",
    "its wave function has an exponentially incresing asymptotic and does not represent a physical state .",
    "as far as the usual definition of effective range can not be applied to the @xmath164 polarization potential @xcite , we introduce the characteristic range of @xmath98 interaction as : @xmath165 , where @xmath166 corresponds to the position of the nearest to the threshold s - matrix singularity .",
    "one can see , that for @xmath167 the scattering length approximation is no longer valid and higher order terms in the scattering amplitude expansion should be taken into account . with the result on table",
    "i one gets @xmath168 a.u . .",
    "it is seen from  ( [ smatr ] ) that for antiproton incident energies @xmath169 a.u .",
    ", @xmath170 and so @xmath171 .",
    "this explains why the inelasticity @xmath136 for @xmath172 a.u .",
    "turns to be much less than unit . for @xmath173 a.u . , and because there are several s - matrix zeros situated to the right from @xmath174 , one has @xmath175 and the reaction probability increases .    to illustrate how the position of the nearthreshold s - matrix singularities determines the low energy scattering ,",
    "we have calculated the inelasticity as a function of the dipole polarizability @xmath176 for a fixed energy ( @xmath177 and @xmath178 a.u . ) .",
    "this function is plotted on fig .",
    "the strong oscillations between its maximum and minimum values with decreasing @xmath176 correspond to the motion of an s - matrix pole from the ii to the iii k - plane quadrant , while the symmetric s - matrix zero moves from the iv to the i quadrant .",
    "this means , that a weakly bound state becomes virtual .",
    "as it is seen from  ( [ smatr ] ) , the inelasticity reaches its maximum value when an s - matrix zero crosses the real k - axis .",
    "this last result shows that sufficiently high accuracy of calculations is required to obtain the scattering length value . in the same time the reaction amplitude for energies @xmath179 a.u .",
    "is less sensitive to the exact position of the nearthreshold singularities and can be more easily calculated .",
    "we estimate our accuracy in the scattering length results to be about 30% .",
    "this uncertainty appears mainly from approximation used for @xmath130 at short distances . to get more precise results one should increase the number of accounted closed channels and take into account the difference between @xmath33 and @xmath31 in ( [ jfr ] ) .",
    "such corrections seem not to be important for understanding the physics of the treated process and are beyond the scope of present paper .",
    "we would like to emphasize that the nearthreshold character of mentioned s - matrix poles and zeros is determined by the long - range polarization potential .",
    "in the same time their exact position in complex k - plane can not be obtained without a proper treatment of the protonium formation dynamics .",
    "in particular , the semiclassical black sphere condition does not hold in the energy domain @xmath180 a.u . .",
    "in terms of s - matrix analytical properties the coupling with protonium production channels produces comparatively big ( for the energy domain of interest ) shifts of the real part of the s - matrix zeros and reduces the inelasticity .",
    "it was shown that the energy dependence of the reaction probability is determined by the existence of several nearthreshold states generated mainly by the long range polarization forces .",
    "this suggests the possibility to obtain a local complex potential which would be equivalent to the full @xmath111 interaction in the energy range of interest . by equivalent we mean not only to reproduce the same reaction probabilities but to support the same nearthreshold spectral structure as well .",
    "we search for such equivalent local complex potential as a sum of three different terms @xmath181 @xmath182 and @xmath183 being respectively the coulomb screened and polarization potential used in the previous section and @xmath184 a local short rang part to be determined .",
    "it was assumed to have the form : @xmath185 and a satisfactory fit is obtained with the following parameter values : @xmath186 , @xmath187 , @xmath188 , @xmath189 and @xmath190 .    in table",
    "[ table2 ] the results of calculations in nonlocal effective potential and mentioned above local approximation are compared .",
    "they agree within few percent accuracy in the energy range @xmath191 a.u .",
    "the results obtained for @xmath98 interaction can be used for a qualitative treatment of different atom - antiproton ( ap ) and atom - antiatom ( a ) system .",
    "it is of particular interest to estimate the @xmath192 annihilation cross - section , and thus to examine the reaction : @xmath193 the @xmath192 system interacts at long distances via a dipole - dipole potential @xmath194 .",
    "this potential also generates a spectrum of nearthreshold states .",
    "some of them with l=0 are shown in table [ table3 ] . in analogy with the ( [ react ] ) case",
    "one can expect that the corresponding s - matrix singularities will determine the ( [ hbar ] ) reaction dynamics .",
    "a qualitative estimation of the @xmath3 potential can be obtained by adding to the same short - range part as in @xmath98 case the dipole - dipole long - range tail @xmath195 .",
    "the reaction  ( [ hbar ] ) cross - section calculated in such a way is shown on fig .",
    "the characteristic energy for this reaction was found to be @xmath196 a.u .",
    ", corresponding to the position of the nearest to the threshold s - matrix singularity ( virtual state with energy @xmath197 a.u . )",
    "a similar treatment can be used to estimate the inelasticity energy dependence for different ap or a systems in the low energy limit .",
    "for such a purpose one has to find the nearest to the threshold s - matrix singularity , generated by polarization potential . the necessary condition for the validity of such a qualitative approach",
    "is that the characteristic range @xmath198 of the ap or a long - range interaction should be much greater than the inelastic range @xmath199 .",
    "as it is seen from ( [ veff ] ) the inelastic range is mainly determined by the mean radius of the last protonium state open channel and thus given by : @xmath200 where @xmath201 and @xmath202 are the ap reduced mass and the first ionization potential respectively ,",
    "n is the principal quantum number of the last open channel .",
    "a similar estimation for the a inelastic range @xmath203 can be obtained , if we take into account that positronium is produced in this collision : @xmath204 here @xmath205 is the reduced mass of the a system , @xmath206 is the positronium ground state energy .    like in the @xmath111 case",
    ", the presence of nearthreshold virtual states may considerably increase the characteristic range of ap or a interaction .",
    "however it can be interesting to have a simple approximation of this range in the aim of comparison with preliminary estimations ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "this is provided by the semiclassical condition for the number n of states : @xmath207 this condition may be rewritten as follows : @xmath208 for the ap case we obtain : @xmath209 while for a one has : @xmath210{2m_{a\\bar a}c_6^a } & \\mbox{if } & l=0 \\\\",

    "the ratios ( [ ap]-[aa ] ) , calculated for a wide range of different atoms , turns to be much smaller than unit in case l=0 . in particular , for he , the less polarizable atom , they are @xmath215 for @xmath216@xmath4 , and @xmath217 for @xmath218 .",
    "the polarization range dominates over the inelastic one in the partial waves up to @xmath219 for @xmath220 , and @xmath221 for @xmath218 .",
    "these values of @xmath99 characterize the maximum angular momentum , which makes possible the existence of extended polarization states .",
    "a coupled channels model describing the @xmath111 system at energies less than @xmath137 a.u . has been developed .",
    "the results thus obtained substantially differ from the low energy extrapolations of the black sphere model and other classical or semiclassical approaches .",

    "the inelasticity turned to be much smaller than the black sphere model predictions .",
    "the protonium formation spectrum for the energies less than @xmath15 a.u . has been calculated .",
    "we have shown that the population of s - states with principal quantum number from 26 to 30 acounts for 75% of the total captured fraction .",
    "the reaction dynamics is found to be determined by the existence of several nearthreshold states .",
    "such states are produced by the long - range polarization potential and are shifted in the complex momentum plane by the coupling with protonium formation channels .",
    "the @xmath98 scattering length appears to be very sensitive to the position of the mentioned singularities and requires accurate calculations .",
    "a local approximation of the effective potential has been proposed for further applications .",
    "it reproduces the scattering observables in the considered energy range and has the same nearthreshold spectral properties .    a qualitative extension of this approach to more general systems ( atom-@xmath226 and atom - antiatom ) has been discussed .",
    "the results discussed in this work have been obtained within an approximate model . in view of them and motivated by the futur project of storing antimater at cern it would be interesting to check the validity of the different approximations by developing more accurate treatments including an exact solution of the three body problem .",

    "the aim of this appendix is to find the dominant channels in the expansion ( [ phi2exp ] ) of the three - body wavefunction .",
    "we first analyze the behavior of the component @xmath90 at distances @xmath227 .",
    "the equations system for @xmath228 and @xmath87 , in terms of the projection operators @xmath41 ( [ hatp ] ) and @xmath229 reads : ( [ hatf ] ) : @xmath230 @xmath231 @xmath232 by taking into account that at big @xmath88 the projection operator @xmath229 vanishes , equations ( [ c1]-[c2p ] ) simplify into the following system , valid for @xmath233 : @xmath234    this system can be solved with respect to @xmath87 and gives for the component @xmath53 : @xmath235 in which @xmath236 the last term in equation ( [ e1 ] ) is the polarization long - range interaction : @xmath237 the asymptotics of the green - function @xmath238 at @xmath239 is : @xmath240 where @xmath241 and @xmath242 is a set of spherical coulomb quantum numbers . if we take into account that at big r , @xmath243 acts on the very slowly changing function @xmath74 ( the oscillation period of @xmath109 for @xmath233 is indeed much greater than @xmath157 ) we can substitute @xmath244 in ( [ vp ] ) by the following expression : @xmath245    by keeping terms up to @xmath164 we obtain the well - known charge - dipole potential asymptotic behavior : @xmath246 @xmath247 here @xmath248 stands for the dipole momentum operator .",
    "one recognizes in ( [ alphad ] ) the expression for the hydrogen dipole polarizability , @xmath249 .",
    "we can thus conclude that the contribution of @xmath87 at big distances @xmath88 can be taken into account by introducing in the elastic channel the polarization charge - dipole potential .    to qualitatively estimate the contribution of different channels at distances",
    "@xmath96 we first obtain the solution of ( [ c1 ] ) in the distorted wave approximation .",
    "component @xmath250 , obtained by neglecting the coupling to other components , is @xmath251 with @xmath252 satisfying the equation : @xmath253 the contributions of components @xmath82 and @xmath90 are characterized by the integrals : @xmath254    an estimation of integrals ( [ int ] ) can be obtained if we take into account the semiclassical character of the wavefunction @xmath252 and the coulomb wavefunctions at @xmath96 in expansions ( [ d ] ) and ( [ p ] ) .",
    "we are dealing with an integral of fast - oscillating functions which has significant values only if there exist stationary phase points inside the integration region .",
    "the equation for such stationary phase points is : @xmath255 it can be shown that there are no stationary phase points for @xmath90 , while the contribution of @xmath82 at the distance @xmath96 is mainly exhausted by protonium states with principal quantum number @xmath256 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we have , in conclusion , that in the energy domain of interest and large internucleon distances the contribution of @xmath90 is the only important one and can be taken into account by introducing the polarization potential ( [ vp ] ) , while at the distances @xmath96 the component @xmath82 dominates , and can be described by a limited number of channels .",
