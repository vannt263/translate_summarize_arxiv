    "the production of particles from classical backgrounds has become a very active area of research in the last years .",
    "we can find it in numerous and disconnected fields of physics such as cosmology @xcite , heavy - ion collision or even plasma physics @xcite .",
    "the pioneer work of schwinger @xcite mainly focused on the production of electron - positron pairs by strong electrostatic fields .",
    "since then many other sources of particles creation have been studied in the literature .",
    "thus for example we can mention , time dependent gravitational fields @xcite , varying planck mass models @xcite , compactification of extra dimensions @xcite , dilaton field @xcite , inflaton field , etc .",
    "the original schwinger s work was based on the proper - time technique for the evaluation of the effective action .",
    "this method allowed him to obtain an exact non - perturbative result for the total number of particles produced .",
    "however , although some other electromagnetic configurations have been studied @xcite and some particular cases have also been solved @xcite , in general the number of models for which exact results can be obtained is very limited .    in spite of its generalized use , it is probably in cosmology where",
    "particle production has been applied more extensively .",
    "thus for instance , it is believed that the presence of any small anisotropy in the early universe could have been erased very effectively by particle emssion processes @xcite .",
    "the theory of reheating after inflation is also based on the resonant production of particles due to the oscillations of the inflaton field @xcite .",
    "the reheating of fermions has been considered in @xcite .",
    "in addition , the formation of large scale structures in the early universe is closely related to the generation from vacuum fluctuation of small seed density inhomogeneities that due to the gravitational instability grew to give rise to the current galactic structure .",
    "the generation of the vacuum fluctuations can be studied in much the same way as the production of scalar particles in a robertson - walker background @xcite .",
    "recently the problem of particle production has also been extended to the area of the string cosmology in which , apart from the gravitational background , there is also an additional scalar field , the dilaton , that can also give rise to the generation of particles @xcite .",
    "in general , the problem of calculating particle production can be approached in two different ways . on one hand , the bogolyubov technique @xcite that allows the calculation of the spectrum of the particle produced .",
    "it is based on the resolution of the harmonic - oscillator equation with variable frequency and only in some particular cases permits the derivation of exact results . on the other hand we have the already mentioned effective action technique that allows to obtain the total number of particles produced in a much simpler way @xcite , although the difficulties in finding exact results are also present .",
    "most of the existing works about the creation of particles from vacuum fluctuations concentrate in the production of boson fields in the presence of scalar , vector or gravitational backgrounds . in this paper",
    "we will study a different source for the production of fermions , it is the presence of general vector and axial - vector backgrounds .",
    "we will thus extend the schwinger s work by including the effects of a non - vanishing axial field .",
    "classical axial backgrounds appear naturally in modern theories of gravity such as supergravity @xcite or in low - energy string effective actions @xcite .",
    "both theories contain torsion ( or axion ) fields as a fundamental ingredient and , in fact , recently several solutions with non - vanishing axial fields have been found in the context of string cosmology @xcite . on the other hand , the idea of modifying general relativity by introducing an arbitrary metric connection with torsion is an old one @xcite , and in some sense quite natural from the point of view of the gauge theories of gravity @xcite .",
    "this torsion field is coupled minimally to fermions by means of its pseudotrace , thus providing a new mechanism for the production of particles .",
    "in fact in this gravitational theories , torsion would be the dominant mechanism for the production of massless fermions in cosmological robertson - walker backgrounds .",
    "this is due to the fact that when gravity is minimally coupled to masless fermions , the theory is conformally invariant .",
    "this implies the well known result of absence of particle production .",
    "however , the presence of additional fields , such as torsion or metric anisotropies breaks that invariance . our work will be based on the effective action method , first from a perturbative point of view and then we will study a particular case in which a non - perturbative calculation is viable .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 we introduce the lagrangian for the model and also give a brief introduction to the effective action technique . in section 3 , we perform the perturbative calculation and compare the result with the pure vector case .",
    "section 4 is devoted to the particular case with constant electric and axial field and a non - perturbative result is obtained in the limit of small axial fields and in section 5 we give the main conclusions of the work .",
    "finally we have included an appendix with some useful formalae of standard perturbation theory in quantum mechanics .",
    "we will consider the following interaction lagrangian for massive fermions minimally coupled to abelian vector and axial - vector fields . for simplicity we will use the left - right notation and at the end we will recover the vector - axial fields : @xmath0 where @xmath1 . as usual the @xmath2 factor is introduced to ensure the convergence of the path integral and the left and right projectors are defined as : @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "we will use the chiral representation for the dirac matrices in which @xmath5 is diagonal .",
    "the coupling constants are included in the own fields .",
    "let us now introduce the effective action ( ea ) for the @xmath6 and @xmath7 fields that is obtained after integrating the fermions out : @xmath8=e^{iw[a , b]}=n\\int d\\psi d\\overline\\psi e^{i\\int d^4x { \\cal l}}\\nonumber \\\\   & = & n\\det ( i{\\not{\\!{\\!d}}}-m + i\\epsilon ) \\label{ea}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , @xmath9 denote the initial and final vacuum states that in general will be different due to the presence of the external sources .",
    "@xmath10 is a normalization constant that is taken as usual in such a way that @xmath11=1 $ ] , this will allow to discard the vacuum divergences as shown below .",
    "the ea will be in general a complex non - local functional in the external fields .",
    "its real part will contain the divergences that will be renormalized by adding suitable local counterterms to the action . the imaginary part will be finite and",
    "will contain the information about the particle production probabilities .",
    "in fact , the probability that the vacuum remains stable is given by @xmath12 .",
    "therefore the probability that the vacuum decays by particle emission will be given by : @xmath13}\\simeq 2\\;{\\mbox{im}}w[a , b]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] when we only have a vector field such that its corresponding electric field is constant , the probability density per unit time and unit volume @xmath14 can be obtained exactly and the result is given by @xcite : @xmath15 however for non - constant electromagnetic fields or when the axial part is switched on , the computation becomes very involved and it is neccessary to rely on some perturbative method .    before concluding this section",
    "we will mention that although the notion of torsion appears in strings and supergravity in slightly different ways , both can be interpreted as the antisymmetric part of the affine connection in pseudo - riemannian geometry @xcite .",
    "thus , if the components of the metric connection are : @xmath16 , its antisymmetric part : @xmath17 is known as the torsion tensor . by means of the einstein equivalence principle",
    ", it is now possible to minimally couple torsion to fermion fields @xcite , one gets : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the torsion pseudotrace and @xmath20 the spin - connection .",
    "in this section we present the evaluation of the ea in ( [ ea ] ) as an expansion in the external fields , i.e an expansion in coupling constants .",
    "let us start by writting : @xmath21=i{\\mbox{tr}}\\;\\log\\left(i{\\not{\\!{\\!d}}}-m+i\\epsilon\\right)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] that can formally be expanded as : @xmath21=i\\sum_{k=1}\\frac{(-1)^k}{k}{\\mbox{tr}}\\left((i{\\not{\\!\\partial}}-m)^{-1 } ( { \\not{\\!{\\!a}}}p_l+{\\not{\\!{\\!b}}}p_r)\\right)^k\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the dirac propagator is defined as usual by : @xmath22 the functional traces @xmath23 are evaluated in dimensional regularization with @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "the lowest order contribution in the expansion is given by the two - point terms , i.e : @xmath21^{(2)}=\\frac{i}{2}\\int d^4x d^4y d\\tilde p d\\tilde q\\frac{{\\not{\\!q}}+m}{q^2-m^2 } e^{-iq(x - y)}({\\not{\\!{\\!a}}}_yp_l+{\\not{\\!{\\!b}}}_yp_r)\\frac{{\\not{\\!p}}+m}{p^2-m^2 } e^{-ip(y - x)}({\\not{\\!{\\!a}}}_xp_l+{\\not{\\!{\\!b}}}_xp_r)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] expanding these terms and defining @xmath26 , we obtain the following expression : @xmath21^{(2)}&=&2i\\int d^4x d^4y d\\tilde k d\\tilde q \\frac{e^{-ik(x - y)}}{(q^2-m^2)((q - k)^2-m^2)}\\left(q^\\mu a_\\mu^y\\frac{(q - k)^\\rho } { 2}a_\\rho^x \\right.\\nonumber \\\\ & -&\\left.q^\\mu\\frac{(q - k)_\\mu}{2}a^\\nu_y a^x_\\nu+q^\\mu a_\\mu^x a_\\nu^y \\frac{(q - k)^\\nu}{2}+\\frac{m^2}{2}g^{\\mu\\nu}a_\\mu^y b_\\nu^x + ( a\\rightarrow b ) \\right)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] all the integrals , except for that involved in the term proportional to @xmath27 , can now be reduced to a common form that is evaluated in dimensional regularization : @xmath28 with @xmath29 .",
    "the integral proportional to @xmath27 is nothing but : @xmath30 the imaginary part of @xmath31 $ ] can be easily extracted from the integrals in the feynman parameter @xmath32 .",
    "they give rise to : @xmath33 and in a similar fashion we obtain : @xmath34 and @xmath35 putting all the contributions together and changing to the vector and axial - vector fields defined by @xmath36 and @xmath37 respectively , we obtain the final result for the imaginary part in terms of the fourier transformed fields : @xmath38&=&\\frac{1}{8\\pi^2}\\int d\\tilde k \\theta(k^2 - 4m^2 ) \\sqrt{1-\\frac{4m^2}{k^2}}\\left(-\\frac{1}{6}\\left(1+\\frac{2m^2}{k^2}\\right ) ( f_{\\mu\\nu}(k)f^{\\mu\\nu}(-k)\\right.\\nonumber \\\\ & + & \\left.s_{\\mu\\nu}(k)s^{\\mu\\nu}(-k))+2m^2 s_\\mu(k ) s^\\mu(-k)\\right ) \\label{pert}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we see that unlike the vector case , the axial contribution to the imaginary part has an additional term proportional to @xmath39 .",
    "this term is prohibited by gauge invariance in the vector case , however as it is well - known it may appear in axial theories with massive fermions since those theories violate the corresponding gauge invariance .",
    "in fact studying the divergences that appear in the model we see that they are proportional to the following operators : @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 @xcite . the @xmath43 operator although having the same dimension does not contribute to the divergent part .",
    "therefore it is only neccesary to introduce a kinetic and a mass counterterms for the axial field in order to render the theory finite .    since the integrand of imaginary part has to be understood as a probability density , it is important to verify that it is always positive . as far as @xmath44 , due to the step function present in ( [ pert ] ) it is possible to find a reference frame in which @xmath45",
    ". then we have : @xmath46 from this expression we can extract some of the different features of the production from vector and axial fields .",
    "first we see that if the axial field is purely spatial in the above reference frame , i.e. , @xmath47 and we choose @xmath48 , then the production from pure axial fields is always supressed with respect to the pure vector case .",
    "however when @xmath49 and @xmath50 then , whereas there is no production in the vector case , it is possible to create particles in the axial one . in the massless case",
    "both fields give rise to the same amount of particles .",
    "in the previous section we have obtained the particle production probabilities up to second order in perturbation theory .",
    "this is in general a good approximation for small background fileds , however even in those cases , it does not contain all the information about the particle production processes . in this section",
    "we will study a particular configuration of vector and axial fields for which it is possible to find an expression for the imaginary part which is non - perturbative in the electric field , in the limit @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "let us start by introducing the operators @xmath53 and @xmath54 acting on states @xmath55 and @xmath56 in the usual form : @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",

    "the problem of evaluating the effective action is thus reduced to the calculation of the spectrum of the @xmath88 operator . however , since we can not obtain such spectrum in an exact form , we will consider @xmath89 as a small perturbation . with that purpose , we will assume that the contributions to the spectrum coming from the perturbation are smaller than the eigenvalues of @xmath90 , i.e , @xmath91 .",
    "we can then apply the standard kato theory for time - independent perturbations in quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "the @xmath90 operator is made out of two shifted harmonic - oscillator hamiltonians with mass @xmath92 , frequency @xmath93 and a new coupling to the magnetic field .",

    "notice the different functional form of these two functions , it reflects the fact that the two harmonic oscillators in ( [ h0 ] ) are displaced in different ways .",
    "we will express the spectrum and the eigenfuntions of the complete hamiltonian @xmath88 as perturbative series : @xmath101 and @xmath102 .",
    "to first order in the perturbation , the spectrum is given by the solutions of the equation @xcite : @xmath103 the solution imply @xmath104 , i.e. there is no first order correction to the energies .",
    "the second order contributions are given by : @xmath105 although , the @xmath90 spectrum is double degenerated , it is possible to use the above expression valid for non - degenerated spectra , since there is no contribution from states in the same multiplet . in any case , the explicit calculation using kato theory yields the same results .",
    "the values of the second order perturbation can be evaluated in a straightforward way , we get : @xmath106 where @xmath107 with @xmath108 the laguerre polinomials .",
    "these polynomials are bounded as @xmath109 grows , in fact asymptotically we have @xcite : @xmath110 for @xmath111 and therefore @xmath112 is bounded .",
    "in fact for @xmath113 , we can expand : @xmath114 .",
    "therefore , as expected for small values of the axial field with respect to the magnetic one , @xmath115 is a good approximation . notice that , although the first correction grows like @xmath109 , the growth must be controlled by higher order terms since the function is bounded .",
    "let us stress that we have two different parameters in our problem : on one hand @xmath116 that we assume to be very small and our perturbative parameter @xmath117 .    using ( [ wave ] ) we can obtain the first correction to the eigenfunctions , we get : @xmath118 evaluating now the third order corrections in perturbation theory from ( [ easy ] ) they again turn out to be zero .",
    "this is also the case of the second order corrections to the eigenfuntions , i.e. from ( [ wave ] ) we get @xmath119 .",

    "in addition , the integral in @xmath125 is divergent in the ultraviolet limit @xmath126 . as usual",
    "these divergencies has to be removed by adding suitable counterterms . in order to obtain them ,",
    "let us expand the part of the integrand in brackets around @xmath127 , we have : @xmath128 the @xmath129 give rise to finite contributions when integrated . the first term is exactly cancelled by the @xmath130 substraction .",
    "but we will have to include new counterterms proportional to @xmath131 .",
    "notice that these are exactly the same operators that we found in the perturbative calculation in section 3 .",
    "in fact there is no contribution from @xmath43 operators due to an exact cancellation of the different cuartic terms in the expansion in ( [ exp ] ) .",
    "since the theory is renormalizable , it is neccessary that the same kind of cancellation operates on the higher order terms in the r.h.s .",
    "of the above expression .",
    "the presence of the axial field is known that does not introduce any gauge anomaly in the electromagnetic current @xcite , therefore the effective action will be gauge invariant . as a consequence it should be built out of scalar and gauge invariant functions . in our case , with constant magnetic and torsion fields , the only possibilities are : @xmath132 and @xmath133 . since the second term vanishes in our case with constant magnetic or electric fields ,",

    "notice that in the absence of electric field there is no particle production even with non - vanishing axial field .",

    "1 the upper curve represent the probability density @xmath14 as a function of @xmath74 for @xmath139 , this value for the electric field ensures that the condition @xmath140 is satisfied for all the values of @xmath74 in the plot .",
    "we can try to extend further the above result by means of the following observation .",
    "since the only possible divergences in our model are those mentioned before , it is neccessary that , when expanding the @xmath141 function in ( [ exp ] ) , the higher order terms in @xmath74 cancel , this implies : @xmath142 therefore we can obtain the complete result for the effective action to all orders in perturbation theory in the limit @xmath143 .",
    "performing the rotation to electric fields , the result is given by : @xmath137=\\frac{1}{4\\pi^3}e^2\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty\\frac{(-1)^n}{n^2 } \\cos\\left(n\\pi\\sqrt{1-\\frac{m^2s^2}{e^2}}\\right)e^{-\\frac{m^2n\\pi}{e}}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in figure.1 , this probability is represented by the lower curve .",
    "we see that the effect of the axial field is to suppress particle production .",
    "eventually it could make it to vanish .",
    "the point of vanishing @xmath14 should indicate the breakdown of the perturbative approximation since the probabilities should be positive . in order to check",
    "whether the perturbative calculation is valid up to the point in which @xmath144 vansihes , we will study the convergence of the perturbative series .",
    "in particular , there is a general result due to kato @xcite that states that if there are two non - negative constants @xmath145 and @xmath146 such that : @xmath147 for all @xmath148 and if the operator @xmath89 is bounded then the eigenvalues perturbative series is absolutely convergent if @xmath149 . with @xmath150 being the distance from @xmath151 to the rest of the spectrum of @xmath90 . in our case , we take @xmath152 and provided @xmath153 is a complete set of eigenfunction we can expand @xmath154 .",
    "it is then easy to show that : @xmath155 .",
    "therefore if we take @xmath156 , since @xmath89 is bounded ( it is constant ) and in our case @xmath157 , we have that the series is absolutely convergent for @xmath158 . transforming to the electrostatic case , if we look at the plot we can realize that for those particular values , the point in which the curve crosses the axis is in fact approximately signalling the breakdown of the perturbative series .",
    "in this work we have studied the production of massive fermions from a classical vector and axial - vector background . using a perturbative evaluation of the effective action",
    "we have obtained the contributions to the imaginary part of the effective action up to second order in the external fields .",
    "we have shown that in the reference frame for which @xmath45 , the production from purely spatial axial fields is suppressed with respect to the that of the vector background .",
    "in addition , for purely temporal axial fields it is possible to create particles whereas this is not the case for vector fields .    in the particular case of a small constant axial field and a constant electric field , it is shown that a non - perturbative calculation can be carried out when those fields are orthogonal . in this case , it is shown that in the massless limit the axial field does not affect the production from the electric field . however , in the massive case , the presence of the axial background inhibits such production .    finally , let us compare these result with the anisotropy damping phenomenon at the planck era .",
    "as is well - known , the presence of small anisotropies in the early universe can be damped in a few planck times due to the backreaction of the particles produced on the geometry .",
    "an interesting possibility is that a similar mechanism could take place in the presence of some primordial torsion field . in this case , since torsion can be generated by the initrinsic spin , this could happen when the fermions are produced in some configuration such that the total spin angular momentum of the system did not vanish .",
    "the use of effective action methods for fermions could be extended to the production of higher spin fields , such as gravitinos in a straightforward way .",
    "in addition , it is also interesting to study not only the particle production rate derived from the effective action , but also the spectra and angular distribution of fermions produced . this could be approached by means of the traditional bogolyubov technique .",
    "work is in progress in this direction @xcite .",
    "in this appendix we summarize the main formulae of the standard perturbation theory used in the text .",
    "let us assume that the hamiltonian of theory can be decomposed in : @xmath159 as shown in the text , we denote by @xmath160 and @xmath161 the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of @xmath90 , which are assummed to be known .",
    "the unperturbed spectrum is assumed to be non - degenerated and discrete .",
    "the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of the complete hamiltonian @xmath88 are expanded in series : @xmath101 and @xmath162 where : @xmath163 and @xmath164 with @xmath165 some simplified formulae for the lowest order terms in the spectrum are given by : @xmath166    * acknowledgements : * i thank ed .",
