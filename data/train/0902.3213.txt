    "<S> remaining qubits ( still in the storage states ) are unaffected by both the mapping process and the subsequent control operation on the selected qubit . </S>",
    "<S> one can then map the selected qubit back to storage states , resulting in a qubit register with the addressed qubit in a new arbitrary superposition of storage states . </S>",

    "<S> in addition , dynamical decoupling techniques have been shown to be useful in reducing the effects of inhomogeneous broadening  @xcite . a simple spin - echo pulse sequence , which rephases time - independent inhomogeneous dephasing , gives a residual coherence time @xmath25 in excess of 300  ms . in an analogous measurement , </S>",

    "<S> we measure this timescale using the standard ramsey method on the field - sensitive transition @xmath27 , giving @xmath31 @xmath17s , roughly 100 times shorter than that of the clock states . while the ramsey dephasing is linearly sensitive to weak field inhomogeneity , the transfer efficiencies of the @xmath32-pulses in our mapping sequence are only quadratically sensitive . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that the mapping is less sensitive to field inhomogeneities than simply given by @xmath33 . </S>",
    "<S> to directly determine the impact of this field sensitivity on the mapping from storage to working states , we developed a modified ramsey sequence that is sensitive to decoherence in the mapping process . </S>",
    "<S> this sequence is composed of the standard opening @xmath18-pulse on the storage transition , followed by @xmath32-pulses mapping storage states to working states , and closed by a final @xmath18-pulse on the working transition . while the standard ramsey sequence depends only on the relative phase of the two ( equal - frequency ) @xmath18-pulses , our modified sequence requires phase control of four different microwave signals , including the two mapping @xmath32-pulses . because all our pulses have different frequencies , the meaning and control of the relative phases involved is more subtle .    </S>",
    "<S> in particular , each modified ramsey sequence ( performed at time @xmath34 relative to a fixed origin ) involves four signals of the form @xmath35 , and the observed fringe depends on the relative phase @xmath36 , where @xmath37 if the four frequencies are phase - locked and satisfy the energy - conserving condition @xmath38 , the ramsey output is insensitive to the starting time @xmath34 of the sequence , depending only on @xmath39 . </S>",
    "<S> we observe ramsey fringes by adjusting the phase of any of the microwave fields by a variable offset @xmath40 , with the @xmath41 and @xmath42 fringes out of phase with the @xmath43 and @xmath44 fringes . </S>",
    "<S> a fringe resulting from varying @xmath42 is shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2(c ) . </S>",
    "<S> despite the fact that the total duration of the mapping process ( 200 @xmath17s ) is comparable to the dephasing time of the sensitive transitions , the fringe has high contrast , confirming that the qubit coherence is largely unaffected by the mapping process .    </S>",

    "<S> to verify the site - selective mapping of the a - site atoms to the working states , we a ) measure the state population in the a sites after closing the ramsey sequence with a @xmath18-pulse on the working transition , and b ) measure the state population in the b sites after a @xmath18 pulse on the storage transition . </S>",
    "<S> the data shown in fig .  [ precision ] proves the coherence and isolation of the transfer process and also demonstrates controlled single - qubit rotation performed on only one site of the register . </S>",
    "<S> the high contrast of the resulting fringes confirms that the process is coherent , and that state pollution from imperfect a  b isolation or intra - site leakage to undesired states is at most 3% ( comparable to our measurement uncertainty of about 3% ) .    </S>",
    "<S> any control scheme incorporating field - sensitive transitions ( as ours does ) is vulnerable to imperfections in the quality of the control , due to fluctuating or inhomogeneous background or control fields . while our observed global ramsey fringe contrasts are consistent with unity , scalable quantum computing places stringent limits on required control fidelities </S>",
